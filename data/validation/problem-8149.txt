a murderer. Ross doesn't need him."
"I miss having two arms." Bucky said, breaking their silence. Steve couldn't help but let out a small chuckle at that, earning a smile from Bucky.
And don’t ask him if it was worth it. Here, in the loneliness of Vormir, where Natasha had willingly traded herself to give them their chance, only for them to turn around and lose Tony in the ultimate sacrifice, this is where Steve hit his knees. Kneeling next to the edge of the chasm he let tears fall for hours.
One by one, those who were still in the Compound make their way into the kitchen, the smell of bacon, pancakes, and eggs filling the space.
“FRI, unlock the door!” He called to the AI.
Warning for references to past abuse and drug use in the chapter.
Steve thought he might just die. Not only did he have a conversation with Tony in private, and it had gone well, but they had even engaged in some of the once familiar banter that they used to. He turned to go back down the stairs to the gym, smiling the whole way.
Steve didn’t think it was possible for the kid’s face to go any redder, but at the question from Bruce his face flushed impossibly darker. Tony’s smile only grew though as he watched Peter squirm and mumble, “Jus’ a research paper…”
Bucky slid back into the co-pilots chair and Steve watched as he leaned across and whispered something to Rhodes. Whatever was said, Rhodes only answered with a small bark of laughter and a shake of his head.
Everyone began to quickly clean up all traces that anyone other than Tony had just been in the room, and jumped into the elevator to clear the floor. Nat and Pepper each gave Tony a kiss on the cheek, while the rest of them gave supportive looks or pat him on the shoulder. James turned around, “Tones, are you going to be okay?” Tony nodded at him as he used the hand that wasn’t still stuck to Steve’s to mess up his hair a little. James gave him a last supportive smile as he joined everyone else in the elevator.
Moments later, excitement at the announcement that Tony Stark's car was pulling up to the Gala broke and Sam heard Steve take a large breath and grip the couch cushions they were sitting on.
T'Challa followed Tony to the elevator, standing in silence for a moment while the doors closed. Leaning against the wall he crossed his arms and surveyed the man next to him.
Convincing Steve Rogers that Tony Stark would not harm Barnes was a war that had taken far too long to win, and even when it was settled, it wasn't that he had truly won anything at all. They had argued about it for days, going back and forth.
T'Challa placed himself between them both, his hand holding Tony back from getting any closer to Ross. When Tony glanced at his face, he read concern and apprehension in T'Challa's eyes, though his face remained outwardly fairly calm.
"While I wouldn't choose that word exactly, I wont say he's wrong. I would say pathetic is better suited, Tony! You looked pathetic! Are you happy now?" Natasha almost screamed at him.
"Please," She held up her hand, "don't. I'm too tired for this." She began to walk past them down the hallway to the bedrooms until she came to a stop in front of Clint.
"No Stark, enough! You are out of control and it stops now. You clearly don't know to control yourself like you should and I am done playing babysitter. In the past month in the field you and your team have continuously pushed boundaries, making stupid mistakes and forcing me to cover your ass. Do you have any idea how much the UN has been fucking around with the Accords because of the shit you and your left over Avengers have caused?"
." Came her reply. Steve nearly choked on his coffee as he spluttered. "He's
He came walking back into the communal area and took in the sight around him. Everyone was still gathered in the kitchen and television areas. Clint was on the couch, Nate perched happily on his knee, Laura hovering nearby. She may not have forgiven Clint for everything the family had been put through, but she seemed happy to see her kids and their father together again. Steve really hoped that she and Clint could work it out. He hoped they could find happiness together again.
It took everything he had to tear his eyes away and raise his gaze to look into Tony’s eyes. When he did, he found those dark pools swirling dangerously, knowing exactly what Steve had been staring at. The muscle in Tony’s jaw jumped as he clenched his jaw hard. With a last look at Clint, Tony retreated from the room, following Natasha’s steps until he reached the elevator.
Tony cleared his throat and said to Nate, “Where are your blanket and toys, huh? Did we leave them in the other room? Let’s go find them.” Balancing the baby on his hip he bounced him a little as he walked back to the empty guest room that Nate had taken his nap in earlier.
Steve would be embarrassed at what James was about to do, but to hell with it. Steve could thank him later, after he and Tony finally got together and came up for some air.
Unless… suddenly an idea hit him full force in the chest. As he rode the elevator to his floor to change for the Gala his mind started running with possibilities.
They knew Tony had come home, Steve had watched his car pull into the garage of the Compound from his bedroom window. He had immediately excused himself after the press conference broadcast ended, going to his room and locking the door. Every time he left a room he had people follow him and tried to talk to him. While he usually appreciated it, he couldn’t help but feel the need for some alone time.
Once they were standing in front of Steve, he looked up, his blue eyes so soft and bright Tony had to physically take a step back. He disguised it by letting Lila and Cassie stand in front of him with their plate of cupcakes. Lila picked up the one in the middle of the plate and held it out to Steve, who’s infuriatingly perfect smile only grew as he took in the red, white, and blue frosting that made the cupcake a messy replica of his shield.
After paying, they loaded up the groceries back into their cart and made their way out to the car, loading the groceries into the trunk and back seat next to James. Tony was about to get into the driver’s seat when he stopped and tilted his head at Sam, considering. Sam froze and said, “What? Do I have something on my face?” Tony only tilted his head a little more before he threw the keys at Sam, who caught them easily.
As they prepared some breakfast, many of the others started to make their way in as well.
“I told you that you made the damage worse.” She bit out as she glanced at him and pretended to be more interested in the controls of the ship.
“Gaahhhh,
Tony moved slowly, but eventually lifted his good hand and took Scott's outstretched palm. Scott have him a firm handshake and looked him in the eyes as he said, "Thank you, Mr. Stark. I appreciate everything you've done for my family."
They both stared, horrified at the sight in front of them.
would he kill his favorite daughter? Because she mattered to so many others? Because she had finally found some kind of happiness? It wasn’t fair. Nebula was no stranger to pain or to the idea that life wasn’t fair, but this, this was wrong and this was different because this wasn’t her, it was someone else. Someone she loved. The only someone she had ever loved. Her sister. Pain she had felt, but only her own pain. Now, this loss, this anguish, and this helplessness to change it, that was new.
Peter huffed and gave him a stiff nod which Steve returned before turning to follow the others. He was stopped again by Peter’s whisper. “He still loves you.” Steve turned again to look at Peter as the kid said, “Don’t let him down again. Please.”
“I do not wish to keep you; I know you are a busy man. I would like to ask you a favor, before you go, if I may?”
"What does that mean, Stark?" Clint snapped, suddenly appearing on the ground next to Steve and James.
T’Challa had watched from the kitchen as Pepper and Rhodes spoke to Steve and Sam across the room. Pepper looked like she was seconds away from tearing into Steve, and the King didn’t even know what was being said, but he wasn’t sure who’s side he would take in a fight.
“Fuck you.” Tony spat blood on Ross’ face, earning him another punch to the gut. Silence reigned for a while, broken only by Tony's harsh breathing.
On the plane back to Wakanda, T'Challa sat with his eyes closed massaging his temples. The migraine that had formed the first day he proposed the treatment plan for James Barnes to the UN had stayed with him throughout the entire week of proceedings on the motion. After the days of pushing back and forth, the motion had carried.

Natasha turned her face upwards towards him and planted a small kiss on his jaw. He drew back, surprised. She only gave him a sad smile and said, "Things have been difficult for us lately. We are left here in this broken empty home and neither of us are very good at showing emotions. But Tony, I have
The shattering of one of the floor’s large glass window panes behind them all stopped the guards in their tracks, everyone flinching and trying to shield themselves from the shards flying in all directions. The sound of the Iron Man repulsors was music to his ears. From his position on the floor on his knees he heard the heavy metal footsteps of the suit land behind him and walk forward until they were standing next to him.
Finally, Ross stepped back, his face still twisted darkly, but he seemed at least to be placated with the hate that Tony radiated in waves.
. Zemo's voice came over the speakers and I thought,
Throwing the automatic piloting on she stood up and stalked over to his chair, towering over him and glaring down at him as his fierce gaze looked up at her.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a smirk he changed directions. And since he had the car keys in his pockets, the team would either have to walk home or wait for him. That was fair punishment as far as he was concerned.
“King T’Challa.” he greeted as cool and relaxed as he could manage in the moment. He gathered himself and pushed off the sink to stand up from his hunched position. By the time he had fully turned to face the African King he again assumed the Tony Stark image of calm and confidence. “What an interesting place for a meeting. I do believe I answered all of the questions the panel had for me for the day, however if you have more you can speak to my people about setting up another time to drill me for more useless information.”
“Hi there, thanks for making it out today, I know our weather isn’t ideal.” Tony drawled into the microphones as he glanced up at the sky. “Unfortunately, this isn’t the doing of our favorite God of Thunder, so we’ll just have to put up with it.” The crowd predictably chuckled at his joke. “So, lets get on with this, shall we? Alright. I’m here to confirm that yes, the Avengers are back together and currently living and training under my roof. There is no precedent for what we are facing and what we will surely face in the future. Since the events that took Captain Rogers and several members of the Avengers out of commission and into hiding, the members who remained were left striving to protect and serve in every way possible. You’ve no doubt seen the clean up efforts around the globe, spearheaded by Stark Industries, in the capable hands of my CEO, Miss Virginia Potts. However, it is not enough. There are, simply put, too few of us. Which is why, starting very soon, the entire team of Avengers will be on active duty again.” There were murmurs and questions from the crowd, but Tony hushed them by raising a finger and removing his sunglasses.
Tony pretended to look hurt at the King's obvious siding with the angry women. "And to think I invited you into my home tonight."
.” She answered. That made Steve a little worried. “Tony?” he questioned. Tony was breathing hard, obviously upset, pushing a palm to the middle of his chest for a moment before dropping it and composing himself. As he unscrewed the cap of the bottle he said, “Listen to me, Rogers, not a word, got it. Don’t even move. I don’t care what you see or what you hear, you aren’t here, got it?”
After a few beats of silence, she realized her mistake. Dreading what she would find she turned to look at him. He was gazing at her with cautious interest and apprehension.
Tony smiled a bit as T'Challa's surprised gaze snapped back to his. "Might this have anything to do with the proposal I made to you this morning?"
He turned to Queen Ramonda and Princess Shuri, kissing both of their hands as he bowed. The Queen had stood tall, laying a gentle hand on his cheek and leaning down to whisper to him, "We always think we have more time than we truly do. Don't let time get the best of you, Captain." He nodded and politely answered her with a "Yes ma'am."
“Don’t patronize me Tony. I just saw the news and while I am very upset with you right now, I think I’ll let Rhodey handle that. Please tell me that you got my memo so you remember you have a Stark Industries meeting today?”
He knew he had done well when Tony’s eyes softened further, looking nearly liquid, and he nodded at him. “Yes, please.” He breathed, bracing himself to stand from the chair. Steve placed gentle hands on him and assisted him, relishing in the warmth he felt radiating off of Tony even through his clothing. He walked Tony to the elevator in order to take him to his room in the Penthouse and once inside he felt Tony slump a bit against the wall and breathe heavily, lifting a hand to press against his chest and rub. “Hey, everything alright?” He asked.
Thor laid a large but gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder. “It is good to see you, my friend. I feared we had lost you. I am glad to find otherwise.”
Sam gave a stiff nod before exhaling a long breath and slumping his shoulders, losing the tension they had held. "You saw and heard him, then?" T'Challa nodded affirmatively.
Once the doors closed they all rushed to the large screen on the wall and James flipped the channel to the security feed for the compound. Tony was pushed roughly in front of the reporters and cameras, his face remaining calm and collected in the face of the flashes, before being hauled into one of the black SUVs. They watched the caravan pull out of the compound.
Peter also wasn’t blind or deaf. He knew before Steve Rogers ever arrived that there had been something between the two of them, something that had been broken during the fight at the airport and in Siberia. He watched the same news everyone else did, but he also got to see deeper into Tony’s private life, moments that he had come to treasure. Tony wasn’t just hurt or betrayed, he was heartbroken. And Steve Rogers is the one who broke that heart.
As he exited the room and closed the door behind him, he asked, “Anybody seen Stevie lately?” Wanda grumbled at the game of chess she and Natasha were playing on their tablet in response. Natasha smirked at her before turning to James to answer, “I think that he needed a break to think. He walked down the hall and turned left into the stairwell.” James smiled at her answer, always the spy with the details, and headed off in that direction.
"Wait," Steve called, holding up a hand. "So if he lashes out during his treatment and hurts someone, even accidentally, this guardian will pay the price?"
She had pushed Tony for information on Pepper and he had given it freely. When she had questioned him about Steve Rogers though, she felt his walls come back up, hard. Even with the amount of alcohol in his system, he was tight lipped about everything that had to do with Captain America. Interesting, she thought, and filed the information away for later.
Tony raised his eyes to meet James’ inquiring look. “Are you seriously gonna tell me that you aren’t sure if that idiot is in love with you? Cause, boy, I’ve known him nearly all his life, and I ain’t never seen him do any of this adorable shit.”
His reveal was met by stunned silence.
"Do you trust yourself to help the Winter Solider, after what happened last time you and he were in a room together?"
“The bracelets on his wrists, take them off.” Ross instructed with his infuriating smirk in place. One of the guards did so and threw them on the floor at Natasha’s feet. Another guard did a security pat down and checked Tony for any more weapons.
The whole thing was ridiculous. The simulations were absolutely insane. Fun to watch, but not so funny once it was your turn. Peter was attacked by a horde of spiders the sizes of small dogs. Clint was chased all over a small city by a robot armed with a bow and arrow complete with a quiver holding ten times the amount of arrows Clint himself had. T’Challa was set upon by what looked like a pack of household cats, but turned out to be more like gremlins after someone was dumb enough to feed them after midnight.
to partner with you?” Tony suddenly felt a swell of emotions he had been trying to desperately to contain. This man next to him was honestly asking this of him? Did he understand what he was asking Tony to
Sam shook his head. "Steve, I didn't follow you because I thought Tony wasn't a good man. I followed you because I wanted to, the end. I need to take the responsibility that I was trying to avoid, I think we all do. We followed you, no matter what reasons we had, we did it. And now we are here and that's just life. Now, I don't know how we move forward, but I know that we can't sit here forever. I think that things will change, maybe that change is something we shape, maybe it's something we wait for, I don't know, man. I know that you and Tony, you have some seriously messed up shit between you, but that doesn't mean it has to stay that way. I'm guessing that the dinosaur phone you hold on to has a twin?"
He felt paralyzed. He was standing nearly shoulder to shoulder with the King, though they faced opposite directions. His hand stayed on the heavy wood of the bathroom door, almost ready to push it open, but he unable to do so. His mind was running a mile per minute.
Any remaining tension left them as they chuckled at her impression before she opened her blanket and used her grip on Tony's hand to pull him on to the couch beside her. He wrapped his arm around her shoulders and instinctively pulled her to his chest before wrapping them both back up in her cocoon of blankets. She laid her head on his chest and he rested his chin on top of her head as they watched the rain continue to pour outside. It was…surreal, to say the least. He had half expected her to kick his ass.
“Wait!” Tony yelled. He pushed a surprised Steve into Sam and Clint’s arms and stepped in front of Wanda. Steve reached out to pull him back but James put his hand on his arm and prevented him from doing so.
The all nodded in understanding. He turned to Shuri and Peter. “Peter, mask on, and don’t take it off no matter what, understand? The Accords give you that right.” Peter nodded as he pulled the mask from his pocket and slid it on. They all stood together and waited while the elevator indicator showed it move from the first floor upwards until it landed on their own.
“I’m not looking for a room, I like mine.” Steve answered. Tony made a noncommittal sound in return.  Having Steve watch him like this was making Tony more uncomfortable by the second. This was bound to come to some kind of confrontation and he would be damned if he let his emotions get the better of him while he was holding Nathaniel. Suddenly, Tony opened his big mouth.
She replied smugly. At that he laughed and began to plan out how he wanted to work on getting to know his teammates.
Why? Why him? Why the hell did it always have to be him that lost people. He had tried his best each time, done what he truly believed was right, wasn't that what everyone said would lead to happiness? It just wasn't fair that no matter what, he lost those that he loved. He knew it was self pity and he didn't care. He let himself sit on that mat and cry for what seemed to be the thousandth time in the last month. Honestly, he was surprised he still had any tears left.
“Is that all you’ve got Rambo?” Tony wheezed. “I went toe to toe with two super soldiers. That felt like a love tap.” The guard struck out at Tony’s stomach again snapping the gun upward and connecting with Tony’s nose, which the implant reported was now pouring blood.
low rumble that Steve somehow felt reverberate deep in his own chest.
Ross gave him a last sneer as he turned on his heel and walked to the elevator and disappeared.
She made it there in record time anyways, pulling into the underground garage and into her parking spot. After getting out of the car she simply stood in the space, feeling angry at everything she could think of. The world, the UN, Tony, Steve, everything was an absolute mess. She hated it and she hated feeling so powerless to do anything about it.
"Actually," Steve said, his voice channeling the voice they all knew so well as his "Cap Voice", "I think I would like a play by play. The whole story."
Although they didn’t have sound, it was clear that Vision started to mildly panic and started calling Wanda’s name. Wanda, really showing just what an actress she could be, looked at Vision with stunning innocence, asking him what in the world he was freaking out about.
Sam opened his mouth to speak but T'Challa pressed on.
Just then, Cooper, Lila, and Cassie all came back in. The girls were each holding plates full of assorted cupcakes in their small hands and Cooper was proudly clutching his archery trophy.
In the corner, Bruce was standing next to an electric box, his hand clutching wires he had pulled out, effectively ended the simulation. His skin had a green tint to it as he shook from head to toe trying to contain the Hulk and center his thoughts.
“I did it! Look for yourself Mr.-I mean- Tony, look!” He chattered excitedly.
They all sat together, gathered around Tony’s bed and talked, asking questions and clarifying the events of the past few years they were together and apart. Throughout the entire thing, Steve continued to hold Tony’s perfect hand, his finger resting on Tony’s pulse point in his wrist as reassurance.
"Uncle Tony!" At least three chorus of voices yelled out as they stepped off the elevator.
Sam laughed and with a good natured slap on Bucky's arm he moved his gaze past Bucky to the pilot seat. Steve felt his anxiety level rise again before the occupant stood up and faced the group.
Tony’s eye quirked as his smile grew. “Isn’t that guy on your team?”
Over and over, Tony kept having him come at him, coaching him with every step, giving him pointers and telling him where he was lacking his concentration. Finally, after successfully blocking one of Tony’s uppercuts, Peter saw a very brief second where Tony left himself open. Without further thought, he jabbed, his glove connecting squarely with Tony’s left cheek, making him stagger for a fraction of a second. He barely registered the cheers coming from the other side of the room before Tony pulled Peter’s still extended arm and trapped him in a headlock. He struggled, but Tony’s grip was as iron as his suit. Tony’s heavy breathing and a chuckle surprised him as he suddenly was released from the hold. Looking up, Tony was smiling at him brightly. He nodded as he held out a glove for Peter to bump. Tiredly, Peter bumped his blue glove against Tony’s red one and let himself be pulled into a quick hug. Above him he heard Tony say, “That’s what I like to see, kid.”
“Great, thanks FRI. Compile all my locked files on Ross and put them up on the screen. Let’s add what Bruce has for us and go from there. It’s time to hang Ross with his own rope.”
Suddenly, the moment is broken as FRIDAY interrupted the fragile peace.
thought you were a good man and a trusted ally. I know you may not believe me, since we have never been close, but I consider you my friend. I can turn my back on you knowing you have my six, and that's, well, a big deal for me. I am not sorry that I signed the Accords and I am not sorry I am here with you and Vis."
“What?” James said absently, before a horrible realization of what he just said dawned on him. “Oh shit. Sam. Sam listen to me.” James turned and put a hand on Sam’s shoulder, making Sam face him. “Sam, you cannot say anything about that. I wasn’t supposed to know and when I found out Tony was livid and made me swear not to say anything. You can’t tell the others. Do you understand?” Sam’s gaze flickered down the isle to Tony who was on the phone with Peter.
Leave a comment and let me know what you think! :)
At the mention of Siberia Bucky flinched slightly. "N-no, of course not. Sorry. Listen, Stark- "
"Tony, Peter, thanks for joining us." Rhodes called to him.
. They needed to start work on Bucky if the man was going to ever recover. The one thing that Tony was adamant about was secrecy. T'Challa would not tell any of his house guests that Tony was involved in what has happening in any way, other than being ordered to help Barnes with his technology.
Clint scowled in his direction. "Natasha and I have been friends for a lot longer than any of you have known her, Colonel."
Peter fell hard onto the training mat at Tony’s feet, having been knocked down yet again after going in too hard while they were boxing. Above him he heard Tony say, “Good Peter, again.” He huffed from his spot face down on the boxing ring mat before pushing himself up on his gloved hands and knees and standing up once again to take the defensive position he had been taught. “Keep your gloves up Peter, don’t put them down just because you think you see a shot. The second that defensive glove comes down, you give me an open floor.”
Tony shrugged one shoulder as they started to pile their items on the register check out belt.
"King T'Challa! King T'Challa!" The reporter called to the King, gaining his attention as they ascended the stairs. "Your Highness, it is wonderful to see you here tonight, how are you feeling?"
Sounds from the kitchen, including the slamming of the refrigerator, drew their attention.
. Come into my house and accuse me of wanting to do anything that might bring that shit back into my life. I will never."
Silence followed his inquiry. "Yeah, I thought not. Honey, I love you, you know that, but you've got to talk to him at some point. The man is living a few floors under his wife and children and he can't see them. That's torture and you know it."
Clint's anger only seemed to grow. "And no one bothered to tell us? T'Challa said he looked for them and couldn't find them. Do you know how worried I've been?"
They sat in the lab for a while more going over details of the plan that T'Challa would propose to the UN Counsel after the reveal of
She gave him a small smile and said, "You, Steve, you are not alright. Your thoughts and emotions are so loud it's like you are screaming. You have been in pain since we left and it has been getting worse, but just now in there, it was like I felt something break. These are your emotions, Steve."
Tony stood back up slowly and leaned on the counter, a hand still pressed to the middle of his chest. Seeing that Clint was eyeing the movement, he dropped his hand and straightened abruptly, turning back toward the coffee maker.
“Don’t you think they should be rounded up or identified?”
"Sooo…," Sam broke the silence, "Wanna tell me when this whole 'being in love with Stark' thing started?"
Ross left a still cursing Tony behind with a glass vase smashing into the door as it closed behind his back.
Bucky tried to keep his face open and calm for Tony. "Steve Rogers isn't here. He's back in Wakanda, remember? It's just you and I. We're friends." He tired not to let the last part sound too much like a question. He thought they were friends, he considered Tony a friend, but he wasn't actually sure Tony felt the same.
what did you say, oh yes,
(See the end of the chapter for
“What the fuck did you just say to me?”
Steve’s jaw snapped shut and his cheeks turned red as his wide eyes turned to Peter, incredibly embarrassed at being not only caught, but called out by a teenager. Peter smirked at him as he removed his gloves. Remembering the words that Steve had said in one of the last simulations they had run, he decided to echo them back to him.
Clint thought.
"Whoa, what's wrong Snowflake, is it not working like it should? You feel pain?"
Steve again felt a pull at his heart, he had missed Natasha dearly. He glanced across the isle at Clint who's face was both hurt and annoyed. "She didn't even say hello. Nothing." He said sadly.
Tony rolled his eyes and reached into the next bin, pulling out a bow and quiver with arrows. Clint stared at them in wonder. "Those aren't the ones that were confiscated from me." He stated carefully. Tony simply gazed back and answered, "No, they are not. They are the new and improved models. The bow is Vibranium, care of our new friends in Wakanda. As for the arrows I believe I drunkenly promised you some updates some time ago, like heat-seeking, trackers in the tips, grapping hooks, all that jazz." Tony shrugged like it was nothing and used his good hand to toss the bow to Clint, followed by the quiver. Clint caught them and ran his fingers over the bow in wonder.
"Where are Scott and Wanda?" Rhodes called up to him.
Steve kept his gaze level. He knew he was blushing but to hell with it, he had said it and he had meant it. It’s not like Tony didn’t know that he was attracted to him. “I-” He cleared his throat. “I did. I mean- I do. I do like the view. Its uh…It’s a very nice view.” Oh god. Very smooth Steve.
Wanda finally spoke up from her chair. "And who, is the guardian?"
"I am insinuating that tonight is very important and you'd better be at your most dashing for your guests." Her smile faltered a bit as she continued, "Tony. Honey, there are going to be a lot of press here, and even more snobbish, selfish, rude people with nothing better to do than stick their noses in each others business."
After extending pleasantries inquiring into each others welfare, Tony finally came walking back down the hallway and immediately raised both hands in what he clearly hoped was a calming gesture as he came into the room.
They were actually going home. Steve could hardly believe it. As he looked at those gathered around them he could see it in everyone else's eyes as well, the almost unsure belief that this was real, paired with shining hope.
He was nervous, sitting here with the others, in the furthest chairs in the darkest corner. The room was full of important business men and woman from various companies. To be completely honest, Steve had no idea what they were all here for – some kind of deal that was to be put on the table and the company that could meet the demands set by Stark Industries would end up as the partner in the endeavor. Natasha had said it was a brilliant business strategy; Pepper and Tony were making the other companies sell to them, putting them in the higher position of power.
Tony’s mouth snapped shut at that, and Steve’s heart nearly burst with happiness at the familiar fire he saw blazing in Tony’s eyes. It wasn’t anger, or pain, it was
As soon as the elevator doors began to open they all poured out and ran towards the lab doors. The lab was on blackout. James tried the door but it was locked.
“Hey, that’s an improvement from the 30 last week!” James called from the kitchen.
At the mention of Sam's name, Tony visibly relaxed a bit. "Dear Sammy, huh? Let me guess, something about not being the friend he asked me to be?"
He spat that word out like it left a bitter taste in his mouth. "My life was lie, after lie, after lie, and standing next to me were both of the people who had caused them." Tony's chest was heaving now as he stepped closer to Steve. "So, did I lose my shit?
As Tony turned to the crowd he raised an arm in greeting and gave the best "
He continued to nuzzle his way up Tony’s neck, his mouth barely ghosting over the skin, and pressed his nose into Tony’s soft hair just above his ear. Steve had taken his time, making sure Tony could have easily stopped him by now if he’d wanted to. With no protest so far, Steve felt a bit bolder, and continued on by pressing a kiss to the shell of Tony’s ear, dipping his head again and placing soft kisses down Tony’s neck. As his lips traveled over the skin Tony tilted his head slightly, giving Steve access to more skin. Steve moved his right hand that was still on the counter to rest on Tony’s hip, just above the waistband of his pants. He let his thumb rub small circles there for a moment before hooking his fingers through one of the belt loops and gently tugging on them, turning Tony around to face him in the space between his arms. Never once did he break from the slow feather-light kisses he was now peppering back up Tony’s neck along his adams apple and under his jaw. He let both of his hands now rest solidly on Tony’s hips.
If you have any questions, FRIDAY is linked into the entire building and available to you at all times. Everyone is to be civil with each other, regardless of ideological or moral differences. Sergeant Barnes and I will be your main points of contact, should you need anything that FRIDAY cannot provide you with. My next point I cannot stress enough, you will not, under any circumstance, lay your hands on another member of the compound in a threatening manner. You will not be participating on any missions until we have established trust with the public and with one another. There will be mandatory team training sessions to try and accomplish this. You will find that there are many changes to the Compound, mostly its inhabitants. Once we get inside you are free to make yourselves comfortable. Does everyone understand?"
After the door closed Tony turned back to meet the outraged Clint and puzzled Scott.
“Whatever you used to heal yourself, it isn’t doing a very good job. You need actual medical care.”
“Why didn’t you tell me that you were going to take on Ross by yourself
Steve had to bite his tongue in order to stay quiet now. He wanted more than anything to stand up and beat Ross to a pulp. Tony must have sensed Steve stiffen next to him, that or he guessed that this new line of interrogation would set Steve off. Either way, Tony pulled their connected hands off of the counter and under it, setting it on Tony’s knee and Tony clasping Steve’s hand tightly in his own.
Steve felt himself freeze for a moment as all eyes turned on him. Cassie continued past his discomfort however and said, “We are going to play Frisbee together!” She looked at Steve, waiting for him to confirm her story for her.
Tony sighed. "Peter, I need you to be able to trust the others. Captain Rogers will be leading this team. Spend some time with him, okay? I know he seems insufferable but after you get to know him he's really just unbearable." Peter smiled at him and nodded, heading towards the elevator.
Suddenly, everything faded. They were all standing in the middle of the large empty floor again.
“You are going to hurt yourself again, Stark.” Nebula said in a tight voice as she watched the exchange. Tony pulled back from Steve slightly before offering her a small smile. “I’m alright, Stardust.” Steve couldn’t hide his shock at their exchange, especially the endearment Tony used, but she only rolled her eyes at the name and turned to the group at large.
Bucky shook his head vehemently, "No Tony, you'll be great. The kid is lucky to have you!"
Laura Barton stood from the kitchen chair and walked over to where Tony had made it back to the largest couch before he had collapsed onto it with the three children hanging off his body. Tony's hands reached out with grabby hands as he said "Oh yes, gimme that little butterball!" and reached for the chubby baby she had in her arms. She lowered Nathaniel onto his lap and Tony's arms circled around the child protectively. After doing so she stepped back and immediately put her hands on her hips.
Tony’s heartrate picked up again. “Actually, it’s Spider-Man. He’s very sensitive about that.” He spoke through the blood.
“FRIDAY, are Laura and Maggie still out with the kids?” He asked.
“Well, I guess we should be going, let you get on with your meetings. You’ve got them all in the palm of your hands, I’m sure you know.” Natasha said with a smile and a wink.
Tony gave a last smile, but it didn’t meet his eyes. The reporters rushed forward like a pack of hungry wolves, shouting to have their questions answered.
Bucky's voice was gentle. "Hey bud. Widow filled us in on the situation. Tony's okay, alright? He's okay. Everything will be fine, is he still in with the doctors?"
Everyone snapped to attention at that. “The Guardians?” Natasha questioned. Rocket’s face fell as he shook his head negatively and said, “Not exactly. It’s Nebula.”
In frames along the wall were montages of photographs full of smiles. Lila and Cassie with the easy bake oven, smears of frosting on their cheeks as they threw their arms around each other and smiled for the camera. Tony and Cooper trying to fit as many cake pops as possible into their mouths. Laura, Maggie, and Natasha relaxing in deck chairs with sunglasses holding up glasses of lemonade. Tony in his workshop, eyes crinkling with laughter looking over at DUM-E who just spilled a smoothie all over Rhodes. Tony standing next to Peter with his arm around the boy’s shoulder, practically glowing with pride as Peter held his science fair ribbon up for the camera. Nathaniel, his chubby hands holding Tony’s fingers, trying to walk-stumble into Vision’s outstretched arms. Nathaniel drooling on Tony’s Armani clad shoulder- Tony doing his best to look annoyed- and failing miserably. Peter taking a selfie with all of them squished together on the couch with bowls of popcorn for what must be movie night. Barnes, complete with bedhead, in the kitchen attempting to flip pancakes in the air with a skillet. Tony with Lila sitting on his shoulders and and Barnes with Cassie perched on his, standing in front of a gigantic fish tank. A few cut outs from newspapers and magazines of the Avengers posing together after New York. So many more.
Steve stood there, feeling at a loss as Wanda pushed a tray of drinks into his arms. "Come on, Captain, lets go watch Tony Stark work the Gala in that suit you'll be dreaming of later." She smiled over her shoulder as Steve felt his face flush, but followed Wanda back into their room with the drinks.
Tony sighed, "No, no, I think it's alright. Uh for the last few months the Compound has been home to Clint Barton and Scott Lang's families. Clint's wife, Laura, and their kids; Cooper, Lila, and Nathaniel. Scott's ex-wife Maggie and his daughter Cassie."
The camera panned across the Grand Ballroom and focused on various celebrities, heads of states, government officials, etc. before coming to again land on the man of the hour. Tony stood tall in the middle of a circle of at least twenty people, holding an empty tumbler in one hand, using his other to make gestures while commanding the center of attention with his story. His face still held his trademark grin as the crowd laughed at his punchline. A tall handsome man came forward from the crowd with two drinks in hand and stepped right up to Tony, far closer than necessary, his eyes raking up the genius with obvious intention.
Needing his rest, Tony was only awake for short periods of time over the next two days. When he was awake, he had small amounts of painkiller in his system in order to cope with the pain. Dianne tried to make sure he got some peace, but with all of those who loved and cared for Tony, that was hard to do. After the initial gathering, the doctor had insisted on limiting the amount of people in the room at a time.
"I truly thought he was such a selfish prick at first," Steve continued, "I treated him like he was a soldier who wasn't preforming his duty. I expected his father when we met and even though there are some similarities, they couldn't be more different. I made assumptions about him and he proved me wrong. He's a good man, Sam, I hope that I never called that into question for anyone else."
“We fought Thanos.” She replied and with a shrug added, “We lost.”
Tears welled up in her eyes as she stood breathless.
"FRI, a little help locating King Cat?"
The sparring continued and both Peter and Tony were so immersed in it that neither of them noticed that many of the other Compound’s occupants had filtered in to stand or sit and watch quietly.
Trying to swallow his apprehension he met Tony’s guardedly curious gaze. He nodded slightly stiffly and cleared his throat. “O-Oh, yes. We are.”
Steve made a swift decision. Sinking to his knees, he kept his gaze locked on Tony’s the whole time. Tony’s eyes widened, his breath catching in his throat at the sight of Steve on his knees in front of him. “Tony, you know me. You know I don’t beg often. But I am on my knees here, asking you,” his voice dropped low, “begging you.” Tony’s eyes were wild, he looked trapped as he said, “Please don’t do this.”
Tony's next words froze him to the spot.
. On defensive in an instant she felt for her knife in the strap attached to her thigh and as she turned she threw it by the hilt into the shadows. The shape barely moved in time to escape the sharp plunge of the blade.
"I know Tones," He used the nickname he had heard Rhodey use frequently, "I know you are. You're doing too much for everyone else. You gotta do somethin' for you sometimes, punk."
"What the fuck, Laura?" Clint said.
He made his way over to the King and spread his arms wide calling, "King T'Challa, finally, I have a friend downstairs who has been asking me to make introductions all night!"
“Friday. It’s good to hear from you baby girl. No doctor right now, we are here for a quick tune up and repair.” Tony smiled tiredly as he heard the voice of his AI once again. A short explanation as they made their way down to his lab made Nebula relax slightly, though she was still wary.
“I honestly have no idea, but if anyone was going to do it, it would be him, wouldn’t it?” Tony shrugged. They laughed as they stepped into the Penthouse.
“I… I can’t leave. House arrest kind of deal, remember?”
“No more questioning why I didn’t leave you behind and no more asking me to do it in the future. Deal, Stardust?”
"FRIDAY?"
He moved to take the cupcake, but then looked at the small child in his arms, unsure how to go about possessing both. Tony contained his eye roll as he leaned forward and held his hands out to receive the baby. Steve lifted Nate easily and maneuvered the boy into Tony’s outstretched arms, their hands brushing against each other. Steve was surprised when Tony didn’t flinch or pull away from his touch, simply taking the child and bouncing him on his hip. Steve tore his eyes away from the sight and returned his focus to the cupcake being offered to him. He thanked the two girls and praised their artistic skills, telling them it looked just like his shield. Tony winced as Lila said, “Uncle Tony said you would like it!” Steve turned his smile back up to Tony, who was glaring at the little girls for spilling his secret. “Well, as usual, Uncle Tony was right.” Tony’s eyes widened at that and the girls giggled as they turned to run away.
“This is how you’re still running things, huh Stark? This is so pathetic its impressive.” He sneered.  Tony raised his unoccupied hand and waved him off, acting flippantly drunk as he replied “Well, what can I say, I’m an impressive guy.” Ross narrowed his eyes. “You know; the Counsel didn’t approve this so that you could fuck it up for us.” Tony scoffed at that. “The Counsel had to approve this and you know it, Ross. You never wanted this.”
His wink had been tired but his smile was genuine.
Another warning about slight sexual content.
“After what happened, after what everyone else just got front row seats to, I don’t think I can have this conversation with you today.”
"What did I look like Nat, huh? Tell me." She shook her head. "Tell me what I looked like on that stairwell, say it. Come on, I know you want to say it so do it, spit it out, I looked…?" He goaded her on, poking at her, knowing she was already nearly angry enough to break.
"Hmm. Does it help?"
T'Challa turned his gaze to her, seeing in her face the suspicion. Turning back to Barnes he kept his gaze level as he answered, "Your guardian, Sergeant Barnes, is Tony Stark."
Upon the elevator doors sliding open, he had stood gaping unattractively at the open floor of the Compound Penthouse. Well, this chaos explained why Tony and Natasha fell asleep on the lower floor instead of the Penthouse. A massive blanket fort made up of at least ten different large quilts stood in the middle of the room, in front of gigantic television screen mounted on the wall. The surrounding couches cushions had been stripped off to be used in the fort building process. An unfinished princess puzzle was scattered on the surface of a large coffee table that had been pushed to the side to make room for the fort. There were various toys and stuffed animals positioned outside the fort, as if guarding the perimeter. Inside the fort was a nest of even more blankets and pillows.
The reporter was back saying, "We have word that Tony Stark is pulling up now, again, this will be his first public event in months since the "Civil War" incident."
Steve shook his head from his place on the frozen floor, tears streaming down his face.
The light on the door turned green and James wrenched the door open forcefully and they all followed. The rest of them stood for a moment, their eyes adapting to the darkness, but the serum meant Steve and James didn’t need it. Steve followed James as he ran to the door on the far wall.
“What the hell is your problem, Barton?” Her hands on her hips, every muscle taut as she held herself back from decking Clint right then and there.
"Buck, you look great, how do you feel?"
“Uh huh.” Was Tony’s eloquent response. Steve raised his gaze back to Tony’s. “I’m trying.” He whispered. “I don’t want to be team leader by myself, Tony. I don’t feel comfortable or confident enough yet to lead alone. I’d like to suggest to the Counsel that the Avengers be lead by two members, not one.”
Tony inclined his head slightly in acceptance and Ross turned away to take a few steps closer to the elevator behind the guards.
“Jesus, Barnes, you have the biggest mouth. Someone actually let you be a spy?”
Bucky laughed as Rhodes scoffed at that. "Shocking."
"So," T'Challa addressed Bucky with a smile of his own, "It seems things there are going quite well?"
It was too dark to see and the wind whipped around him as the toes of his boots hung just over the stone edge of the landing. He wasn’t sure what he was trying to see through the thick layers of swirling mist below if anything. Proof? Maybe if she was there he could bury her, she deserved that. But as he stood precariously at the edge and the mist began to clear he caught a fleeting glimpse of the bottom.
“You- I told you I was compromised. You were supposed to leave!”
T'Challa eyed Tony strangely, his eyes darting down towards his collar and back up to his face. Tony realized he had seen the hickey that had started to form under his suit.
Steve felt like his smile was too big for his face as he put an arm around Bucky and they shared a smile. Sam gave him an overly hardy thumping pat on the back which Bucky answered with a side eye.
"I think we both deserve that Oscar."
"Dude." Scott said. "This is so sweet. If my prison had looked like this before, I never would have wanted to leave." Wanda's eyes narrowed at his back as he continued further into the room to explore.
No body. No blood. Nothing.
Shocked, all she can say is, “Why are you here?” Her voice is raspy and broken. She realizes she had yet to hear him speak since Titan, until now.
“Uncle Tony said that they were bringing home treats and we were going to have guests, like a party! They said they would be here soon. Mommy and Auntie Laura said that if we were having guests we needed to clean up down here.”
“I have no idea man, other than the fact that he’s all you ever think about.” James returned. They sat together a little longer as the smile slowly faded off of Steve’s face. “You’ve both pretty much admitted it now, I don’t know what you’re waitin’ on. Get in there and kiss your man.”
Tony’s jaw clenched at that and he gave a short nod as he tipped the bottle back and took a large swig, his face pulling as it burned down his throat.
Steve backtracked a little, confused on what Tony was talking about, “I said you’ve done so much-”
"The Spider Kid?! That juvenile little shit laid me out and stuck my arms to the floor!"
They had talked for hours. Stayed up as long as they could before they both drifted off still huddled together on the couch. Since that night they spoke often. If he felt out of control he would call or text her, if she felt alone or out of sorts she would reach out to him. Slowly they tried to do more, they trained and watched a few movies together with Vision, ate together as a group in the kitchen, and generally tried to regain some semblance of the team they had lost. They became close, so much so that Tony would say Natasha was on the very short list of people he truly trusted and would trust with his life.
For a split second Peter thought about slapping him for so openly ogling Tony, but he saw Shuri leaning against the wall with a sly grin on her face watching the scene. Instead, he leaned on the ropes next to Rogers and whispered lowly, “Do you see something you like,
Sam gave him a friendly shove forward and joked, "I bet it feels even better once you're actually inside man, but if you'd like to stay out here and stare we could send out a sleeping bag." Steve returned his smile and adjusted his duffle bag on his shoulder.
He had never been in Tony's bedroom, and he had never heard Tony's AI sound so nervous. "What's going on FRIDAY, you sound worried?"
Bruce looked apprehensive at the mere thought. “Do I have to be?” He sighed, already standing up and shuffling over to the elevator. “Don’t be like that Green Machine, I need someone to help me keep and eye on these two.” Bruce shook his head, “We both know I’m going to be supervising the three of you, don’t pretend we are in this together.” Bruce’s long suffering tone was betrayed by his face though, as he couldn’t quite keep the smile out of his eyes. As they all stepped into the elevator the sound of instant chatter started, the doors closing them off in their own little world.
Steve considered this. “I didn’t mean to tell him what to do-” James nodded but cut him off, “But you still did, Stevie. You gotta look at the bigger picture, you can’t keep getting stuck like this. You’re so worried about what you meant to do and your intentions that you completely overlook what actually happens. Stop trying tell to grown ass adults how to live their life. When they called you all up for New York, you were different kinds of people, not a seamlessly integrated team. Who says we need to be? This isn’t the army, where you leave your baggage and individuality at the door to become a unit. This is different, so let it be different.”
His large brown eyes opened and connected with her dark ones.
"So don't you ever.
Tony scoffed as he tried to stand up from the counter, “Come on, we’re going to the lab to get this shit off so I can get away from you.”
"Come on, Wilson, we don't have all day, come reunite with your little pet." Tony said flippantly.
Their moment was broken before Steve could answer as the door opened and their joyful teammates rushed in to express their love and happiness that Tony was finally awake. Tony looked tired, but was happy to see all of them, sitting through Natasha’s angry demands that he never does something so stupid again before she dissolved into tears and gave him a gentle hug. Throughout the entire thing Steve’s kept playing Tony’s words over and over again in his mind. He sat and watched the rest of them with a smile and a breathless feeling whenever Tony would glance over at him with a soft look.
Scott turned an angry and guilty eye on both Steve and Tony. "Because the bad guys were still in there."
Steve felt his stomach clench again. “Do I get to ask why?” Tony stared at the countertop in front of them. “I’m a very busy and important man, if you read the news at all. My company and my projects need my attention. When I know that the team has enough players and can work together and handle everything, I’ll retire so I can do those other things.” Steve shook his head vehemently. “No amount of people who join the team can take Iron Man’s place.”
Ross couldn't look more please with himself if he tried.
Ross' gaze turned on the King for a moment before he seemed to gather himself and turned back to Tony with a cruel gaze.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony turned away from him and resumed walking up the stairs, which to be completely honest, wasn’t a bad view for Steve, though he missed their proximity. “You heard what Ross said. You know what I asked for.”
"My name is Jaqueline De'Varo and we are reporting live from the Stark Charity Gala, held in beautiful New York City, where everyone who is anyone is going to be tonight. We are all hoping to specifically catch a glimpse of the man this entire affair is named for, the famous Tony Stark. He has been mostly absent from the public eyes for the last few months, ever since the event that is now being referred to as "Civil War", where a difference of personality, opinion, and politics is thought to have torn apart the once great team of "The Avengers". Rumors that Mr. Stark has not taken the split of the team well have persisted and grown the longer he has stayed out of the public eye. However, it is confirmed that he and Pepper Potts are not back together, and likely never will be, despite signs that they are still close. In a comment obtained from Ms. Potts herself only a few weeks after the reported split, she had said that while they loved each other dearly, they are better off as friends."
“Tony!” Steve yelled as he skidded to a halt in the middle of one of the hallways. “Sir, can I help you?” A perturbed older nurse asked, just as James and Sam came jogging up to the scene. “I’m so sorry ma’am, we are looking for our friend, he arrived here by ambulance about half an hour ago.” Sam tried to soothe her. She gave him a very unimpressed look. “Sir, I watch the news, I should hope I recognize the Avengers. I’ve also worked at this hospital for 30 years, Mr. Stark and I are on a first name basis considering how much time he has spent here over that span. He has been treated and is currently unconscious, so no amount of yelling is going to help.” She finished, pointedly narrowing her eyes at Steve.
“Peter?” he managed to cough. “Yeah Tony, he’s here. Kid, come here.” Peter’s masked face swam into Tony’s vision. “He-Hey Mr. Stark.” His voice cracked. Tony coughed but gave the kid his best smile and said, “We gotta stop meeting like this.” Peter’s relieved laugh was shaky, but it did the job. Tony coughed again and asked, “Steve?”
to. I want to be able to support you in the field. In order to do that, its important to know each other’s capabilities. I’ve been out of it for a while, so I’m sure I’ve missed some upgrades. Sometime, when you aren’t busy, would you mind showing me?” Steve finished with an apprehensive air.
.” She teased.
“Dear God.” He whispered.
Every night they all sit down to watch a different movie, complete with popcorn and candy. Nathaniel sleeps in his arms while Cassie lays down, using Tony's thigh as a pillow. He spends hours playing Mario Kart with Cooper and Lila, doing his best to keep his cursing to a minimum every time he gets hit with one of the damned shells. By the end of each session, the Swear Jar has at least $20 more in it.
Pepper looked aghast as she said, “FRIDAY, Ross wasn’t supposed to be here until tomorrow!” Tony shook his head, “That son of a bitch just loves dropping in unannounced. Alright, quick, everyone clear out, up to the Penthouse. FRI, take the floor restraints off of the specific parties. Laura, I need an almost empty bottle of alcohol, something strong, don’t bother with a glass.”
Tony's eyes softened at the sight of the children. "Hey Cassie-Bug. 'm okay, honey. Maggie, Laura, it's alright."
"I thought I saw movement down one of the passages, I went to investigate." She explained.
They all went to the kitchen and deposited Clint on one of the counter stools. Laura gave him a very disapproving look which Clint looked slightly guilty receiving but sent her a tiny smile anyways. Steve thought it was sweet when she rolled her eyes and suppressed smiling back at her husband.
“Let’s go Stark, we’ve got the press waiting for us outside. I know how much you like showing off, let’s see what they think of you in handcuffs.” Ross said as he stepped into the elevator. The guards flanked Tony and surrounded him as they retreated to split some of them in elevator and the rest taking the stairwell to prevent the Avengers from cutting them off.
They stop to refuel at a small backwater planet that Nebula warns him is a hot spot for all kinds of illegal activity and the worst kind of criminals. Here, they should be able to get what they need and mostly go unnoticed and get out. All that matters on this planet is currency and the shady business that earns it.
He could actually
Laura had returned.
They all greeted Natasha and Bruce as they stepped off the elevator. Nat laughed at him, his mouth hanging open at the sight. "Doing alright there, Dr. Banner?"
Wanda and Vision were tucked into a corner together, speaking quietly. Steve’s feelings were more than a little conflicted about her. He had protected her for a long time, but after what he witnessed this afternoon, he felt a little bit sick looking at her. There was no way that Tony had actually forgiven her as easily as he had made it seem. The woman had gotten into his head, stoked his greatest fears and lit the flame into a blaze. Tony didn’t trust people as it was. Steve felt like he was on the edge of an unsteady cliff and he didn’t know which way to step.
They were so engrossed with their work that they didn’t notice Peter and Shuri sitting on a beanbag and watching them with wide grins. “They have improved very much.” Shuri whispered. Peter hummed in agreement and laced his hands behind his head as he reclined and watched.
He snagged one of the mini cupcakes Lila had made earlier as he waited for Tony.
He stepped around Steve and said, “This team needs a leader who trusts the ones he leads. That won’t be me, we both know it. So it needs to be you. Use your teammates. Use your
Steve continued to stare at the other man as he opened up to them all about his and Tony’s relationship. “The first time I met Tony was at MIT. We were roommates and he was 15.” He smiled at Tony as he remembered the young boy. “Everywhere he went he was the smartest in the room. Everyone knew who he was because of his family, and everyone thought they would be able to use him. Of course, just like any other 15-year-old kid, Tony wanted to be liked. He partied hard and fast but it never affected his school work, he passed with flying colors, so no one caught on that he was burning himself out. We weren’t close so I didn’t even realize what was going on with him until one night he came stumbling into our room at 3 in the morning. Immediately I knew something was wrong, he was so strung out I don’t know how he even found the dorm. His breathing was erratic and his eyes were glassy. I did what I thought was best, I shoved him into the car and drove him to the hospital where they told me he had overdosed. His parents showed up a while later. Maria was frantic for her son, but Howard…” Rhodes shook his head. “Howard wasn’t thrilled when the doctor told him about the drugs but he was just plain livid when the doctor asked how long Tony had been sexually active with other men. They took him from the hospital that night and I didn’t see Tony again for a week. When I did, he was sporting one of the worst black eyes I’d ever seen. He didn’t blame me for taking him to the hospital that night, but he asked me to never do it again. I began to realize that after every visit home, Tony would come back with some kind of injury. Eventually, Tony nearly refused to go home at all, even though it broke his mom’s heart.”
The smaller man was still surprisingly light on his feet as he twisted away from a flying fist and returned with a hard blow to the back of the thugs knees. With a quick movement, Stark produced one of her knives in his hand, which he buried in the thug’s chest with a grunt.
"And the smoking?"
"I have compiled footage for you to view before your flight back to New York. It is footage of the current team in action. They have only been on a handful of smaller missions, kept very low profile, but you will be able to see the team dynamic and evaluate where each of your own skills will fall in and be the most valuable." He surveyed the individuals on the couches in front of him.
The feeling inside the Compound wasn’t much better. After he showered and changed into sweats and a warm sweatshirt, Steve sat at the table waited for the others to wake up and make their way into the kitchen. He found himself staring at the rain drops falling on the windows and leaving trails as they ran down the glass. Shaking himself, he stood and tried to distract himself by starting breakfast for everyone.
call them my friends." He hissed with as much venom as he could possibly put into his voice. "Don't you ever saying anything like that in my fucking presence again."
Suddenly a blast rocked the ground and a few buildings in the distance teetered and fell. Dust and pieces of glass, concrete, and metal flew in all different directions.
T'Challa had enough. "Gentleman, please, this will solve nothing. Mr. Secretary, it seems that we have the answer we came here for. Mr. Stark does not seem to harbor any positive feelings towards his old teammates. I suggest we carry on to productive negotiations."
Steve’s face heated up again as he pushed the stop button on the elevator and left them all inside, hearing a last, “His office is on the 89
Steve took in Tony’s appearance as his chest rose and fell under the hospital sheets. His face was a bit pale and he had bruises and cuts on his body, but nothing looked overly concerning until he saw the multitude of bruises forming a ring around each of Tony’s wrists. The sight of the bruising caused by the handcuffs brought his anger back to the forefront of his mind and he felt his hands start to shake.
James was tense, but his voice was under control as he said, “Tony isn’t safe with him. Since Tony did it publicly, everyone knows it was him that gave the evidence. Ross knows he is going down and if we don’t do something he will take Tony down with him.” Sam followed Clint’s lead with his own outburst, saying, “Somebody better explain something right now. Why were they even allowed to take any of us? They wanted Wanda, why did they take Tony instead?”
"I tried to ask Steve about it but… he wouldn't, maybe couldn't, get it out. He just said that it was complicated and that they had both made so many mistakes. I have tried to be patient, really I have, but its been 4 months and we all lost people too, family and friends. Tony and I, we were becoming friends. I liked- no I like, the man, even now. And I am so confused if that is right or not. I don't know what happened, so how can I know how I should feel about it?"
"Nat-" he tried.
“I believe I can help answer that.” Wong says, resigned. “Stephen contacted me with his magic from space before he was cut off.  Stark was able to save the boy from the atmosphere with an Iron Man design of the Spider Suit. He tried to send the kid home but he stowed away and didn’t reveal himself until it was too late. Together, they rescued Stephen and killed his captor. Stephen said they argued and Stark insisted that they take the fight to Thanos, away from Earth. If they failed, we were to stand and defend.”
Steve gave him a small tender smile “I have to. Help me understand why the Accords were able to tear us apart.”
“I didn’t know you. I hated you. I…” She shook her head again. “I blamed you for my losses. I punished you by showing you yours.”
She didn’t want to have this conversation. It was an old wound that shouldn’t effect her like it still managed to do each time.
So he was laying on the couch, head hanging off upside down, reading the leather-bound copy of "Treasure Island" Tony had lent him to pass the time. He had never been much of a reader before, but he found it a wonderful escape these days. Safe in Tony's lab, he could still go on amazing adventures.
The kids had some racing game up on the television and the girls were laughing at Cooper’s frustration as Peter was winning.
Once alone she turned immediately and put her arms around him. Confused, Steve returned the hug before pulling away and holding her by the shoulders. "Is everything alright Wanda, did something upset you?"
He had thought Vision had been the only one to see him like that. Tony had only fleeting memories of Vision speaking to him, telling him that he would be alright and other platitudes, before picking him up off the freezing ground to carry him into the aircraft he had hidden in the valley of the mountain. T’Challa must have sent a message to Vision.
“Tony, listen to me, I’m here, okay? We’re all here. The ambulance is coming and the rest of the team will meet us at the hospital. Tony. Stay with me, look at me.” James’ face was swimming and his voice sounded like they were underwater. Tony squinted his eyes, trying to clear his vision to focus on the words James was saying.
About ten minutes later Tony emerged from the door to the stairwell. He was smoothing down his suit and trying to put his disheveled hair back into place. His lips were red and his face slightly flushed, a small bruise starting to form just peeking out from under the collar of his shirt.
"This is where you come in, Bruce. Right as this whole thing is coming together, you and I take Ross down, hard. You have the evidence to do it. T'Challa has the pull within the UN to make sure that he goes down in front of the leaders of the world. After revealing his past with the blunders he made during "Civil War", no one will want to touch him, they will wash their hands of him and everything he stood for. The Olive Branch will have already been extended to the Rouge Avengers. At that time, we stress the importance of having the Avengers back to fight the growing threats in the world. It puts public opinion back into our court. We push through the last changes to the Accords and bam, you all have your family back and the world has the Avengers together where it needs them."
James laughed as he gave Tony a soft pat on the shoulder before exiting the room under the pretense of going to collect his winnings.
Sam shot up after his friend, calling out to him, "Steve, wait man, hold up!"
"I didn't want them to get away with it!"
Nat and Tony fall asleep snuggling on the couch after watching a movie in the middle of the night. Steve and Clint found them stretched out on the couch, Nat laying spread across Tony, her leg hiked up across his stomach, his arm holding her to his chest, his hand dangerously close to her ass. She was wearing a tank top and short shorts; Tony was wearing only sweats.
“Rogers, come on, stand up. If I miss this prank because I was saving your ass, I am going to be pissed at you for the rest of your life.” Tony said, trying to get to the door. Apparently, Steve hated himself, because he said, “As if you aren’t already set on doing that anyways?” Tony stopped for a second and turned his gaze on him. Steve felt like slapping himself. Why the hell did he always make everything so much worse? He was hyper aware of how close Tony was now, and the feel of their palms pushed together, Tony’s hand just a bit smaller than his own. He could feel each callus from Tony’s work in his lab and tinkering, flat against his own palm.
He winced and glanced at her before returning, "Are we talking weed or the cigarettes?"
If Steve had felt like the world had crashed down on him before, it was nothing compared to the feeling that now held his soul in it's shattering grip.
“I-I know?” Steve answered, unsure of what Tony was saying. “Stark men are made of iron.” Tony said quietly. “What does that mean? Tony, do you not want my help? I can send for Nat or… or maybe James? I know you two are close. FRIDAY wou-”
James was out of his seat in an instant and running for the elevator. "Alright FRI, show me the way."
Tony’s action was immediate. “FRIDAY, send out mission acceptance. Alert local law enforcement that we are on our way, tell them to contain the area but to stay off the scene for their own safety.”
Natasha and Rhodes shook their heads. They were all knocked down to their knees by a blast coming from the building Ant-Man had been trying to rescue the hostages from. Glass from the 5th floor shot out in all directions.
In the middle of their argument, Tony’s phone began to ring. He pulled it out of his pocket and his face lit up at whatever he saw on the screen, swiping to answer the call.
Tony sighed and drew a breath, buying him more time to sort out his conflicted muddled thoughts as he considered his answer. “Yes, it is. Man, I still can’t believe that you were able to draw me into this.”
"You look like you could use a refill, Mr. Stark." Tony turned toward him, if he was caught off guard by how close the man was, he didn't show it, his eyes returning the appraisal and stepping even closer, taking the offered drink. His answer was too low to be picked up by the microphones, as was the conversation that followed, though it wasn't long before Tony stepped back, his smile large.
“Is that a threat, King T’Challa?” Ross growled. T’Challa looked every bit the powerful King as he answered, “It is a promise.”
Sam knows this was a bad idea. A horrible, terrible, awful idea. And yet, here they were, the exiled Avengers gathered on the chairs and couches around the large television screen in their living area.
What might have once been an easy bake oven, but now had Stark-like modifications added to it, had taken residence on what would have once been a mini bar. It was now covered in a rainbow of frosting and sprinkles, with mini cupcakes in their brightly colored wrapping stacked up in a tier.
Sam's mouth fell open as Peter unlocked and opened up one of the bins on the large cart and pulled out the Falcon pack and RedWing.
Vision lent a supportive arm to Scott, who still looked sick, and helped him follow Natasha and Clint out of the lab.
“Quill discovered Thanos had killed Gamora to obtain the Soul Stone.” Here she paused for a moment. “He… he lost it. When he lost it, we lost our hold, and Thanos snapped out of it. He beat us down.” She again turned and looked directly into Steve’s eyes as she said, “When the rest of us could no longer get up, Stark pushed himself and took on Thanos on his own.”
Steve felt his heart sink. He knew of course Tony wouldn't want to be around them. Part of him couldn't help but be disappointed, though. If they were going to be a team Tony would need to be with them, just as they had been before.
Passing a shelf full of electronics, Tony grabbed a pair of wireless headphones and tossed them into the cart as well.
“Oh, I know you didn’t just storm into the Avenger’s Compound and assault my senior citizen.” Came Tony’s beautifully smooth voice above him. There was the sound of mechanical whirring before Steve felt a very human hand on his shoulder. Tony stepped out of the suit and crouched down next to him.
“Take Tony Stark into custody.” He grinned.
A small sniff came over the comm before a trembling voice said, "I'm here." As the face of a young male teenager moved into the camera sight. His eyes were red and watery, a few small cuts on his temple and a bruise on his cheekbone.
Tony was hauled from the wall back in front of them next to Ross. He gave them all one of his signature smiles before calling, “FRIDAY, activate protocol Air Force One.”
A sudden warmth flooded her chest at his words. “Daughter?” She choked out harshly.
"Tell me what happened in Siberia."
“I saw the whole thing, you know. The video. Mission report, December 16, 1991.”
Ross sneered in displeasure at seeing Tony. “How was Chicago?”
Clint leaned forward as well and keeping his voice so only they could hear it said, "I'm pretty sure he did kick your ass, Wilson." Sam flipped him off.
Her laugh rang clear over the speakers. "I'm sure no one would mind a little bit of rattling. So listen, we got a call from Ross while you guys were on the ground. It seems there was a little problem with that terrorist cell we cleared out last month."
exploding. Torture came next, followed by horror at a piece of metal imbedded in skin without consent (this one she was familiar with, though the torture and parts were different than her own memories.) Anger, and refusal to lie down and die, strength to get back up and continue fighting. Betrayal of someone who was supposed to have loved her, before finding a hope in a possible new family, only to watch it all fall apart.
He smiled. “That sounds perfect, FRIDAY. Could I get some of those books as well?”
Sam tried to bite his tongue, he really did, but he couldn’t just let that slide. “She seemed to take her new gloves without much of a thought.”
As they all filed into the elevator Steve looked up to find everyone grinning at him.
"You are going to have to give them time. Laura and the kids went through a lot- "
"Rogers." He only nodded in acknowledgment, making no move to take Steve's outstretched hand.
“We had a plan. Stark’s plan.” She said, her eyes again finding Steve when he took a sharp breath at the mention of Tony’s name. She ignored him though and continued, “We would do whatever it took to keep Thanos from closing his fist, and while we each took turns trying to hit him, we would attempt to take the Gauntlet from his hand. Strange used his magic and portals to aid us. Together, we beat him down while Mantis tried to calm his mind. Stark and P- the boy - pulled off the Gauntlet, they almost had it…but…”
Next to Steve, Sam watched her lead T’Challa into the kitchen. “So, I think it’s safe to say he’s been here before, huh?” Steve nodded dumbly. “Yeah. Probably safe to assume that.” Sam hummed in agreement before he leaned over even closer to Steve and said, “He and Tony seem awfully close as well.” Steve snapped his head to the side and gave Sam his best glare. “What?” Sam shrugged. “Don’t bother telling me you didn’t notice that. I thought for sure I was going to hear Captain America growl.” Steve did his best to darken his glare, but only had the effect of making Sam’s smile widen.
“I’m sorry my friend, I would have been right behind you but I was detained by Ross.” Tony laid back into the cushions and covered his face with his hand. T’Challa called out, “Miss FRIDAY, would you request Doctor Banner’s presence?” Tony quirked an eyebrow as she answered,
The week the video comes out to the public, Tony doesn't leave the Avengers Compound.
The others looked at him and no one bothered to even try and tell him it wouldn’t work. They were all hoping it would.
Tony called out, “Okay FRI, give Wanda the green light!” FRIDAY answered, “
Steve looked alarmed. “I mean, start with a kiss, you can move up to the rest from there. Though, I’d be a little careful with him, since he’s hurt. Choose a good position where you gotta do most of the work.” Steve’s face was deep red now and he was spluttering.
"These, were my mother's. She loved them dearly and only took them out for the most special of occasions. I've never known anyone else who could wear them and honor her in the way they deserve, until you." Hot tears gathered in her eyes at his words.
, Steve ended up outside of Tony’s hospital room door without any idea of what to say or plan on how he would act. He hesitated, staring blankly at the door.
“I am sorry boss; I have no way of knowing. The majority of the fighting took place in Wakanda. I have not heard anything much since. I know that survivors are rebuilding, but I do not know who is among them.”
Next up, Science Squad!
If Steve's eyes got any wider they might pop out of his head. "It's fine man, I'm not judging anything, I need you to know that right now. You are my friend and I want you to be happy, and right now man, happy is the last thing you are. I know its because of him, I know it's because of what happened. The issue is that I don't actually know what happened."
"Let's go, Ant-Guy, come get the suit." Tony called, setting aside his tablet and pulling out the suit, looking almost bored.
Emerging from the cabinet he turned towards Tony and James. From the look on his face as his eyes landed on Tony, he was obviously expecting literally anyone else.
The night before, after he had finished packing, Bucky had confronted Steve about his feelings for Tony, calling him a punk and saying he shouldn't have tried to hide them from him, especially since Steve's outburst the night of the Gala had made his thoughts on Tony Stark embarrassingly obvious to everyone else.
In the elevator Tony and James both were still smiling at the look on Sam’s face.
"Now, I must go get ready for my trip. I have heard these parties are quite a spectacle, I need to consult with Shuri about my wardrobe, since she seems to have many opinions on my footwear, especially." He chuckled at the memory of this little sister seeing his ceremonial sandals. "I will trust you to keep and eye on things here, Sam."
He and Tony had worked well together, despite what everyone else seemed to think. They carried the weight of the team together. Steve had been shocked when Tony had casually fallen into step behind him, deferring to his judgement to lead the team. Tony had pretended that it was easy, that it wasn't a big deal. They both knew differently and it had been touching for Steve to know that a man like Tony had trusted him enough to be led. Not that he led blindly, and God knows Tony would never follow without question, but it was those qualities that pushed Steve to be better. They made each other better.
“Stevie has been outta his mind with worry, ya know.” James said from the chair at Tony’s bedside. The chair was tipped back on its hind legs and James’ feet were crossed at the ankle on the bed next to Tony, who was propped up by pillows in a sitting position.
************************************
His team said their goodbyes to the people who had given them so much and Steve was last to step forward to do the same. Hugging those around him, Steve thanked them for everything they had done for them.
It's almost enough that Tony forgets the storm coming his way. He's ducked Ross and every phone call for much longer than he thought he would get away with, but he knew that Ross wouldn't let it stay that way for long.
Tony did his best to look suspicious as Ross continued.
“He’s that kind of a guy. When we finally found some at a tiny store in the middle of a podunk dirt town, he bought all of the stock they had. I still have some, I’ll let you try it. I think Tony still has a bag stashed away somewhere too.”
Finally, after what seemed like forever listening to endless gossip, the reporters began to excitedly announce that King T'Challa of Wakanda was arriving. It was clear that his entrance into the public spotlight after his father's death had left a lasting effect on people.
Steve narrowed his eyes but thought of Tony and didn’t rise to the bait. “Why are you here?” He asked instead.
They become especially close one Wednesday morning when Bucky is the only one home, eating cereal in the communal kitchen. He was startled out of his thoughts when FRIDAY's voice suddenly rang out.
Maggie and Laura immediately started to pull out bowls and spoons from the cupboard. Vision and Wanda went to the freezer and began pulling out the assortment of ice cream piled inside.
Tony looked up into her eyes as the tears fell down her cheeks at the use of the nickname he had given her when they had moved into the Compound with him. Shakily, she sat back down and leaned into the Maggie's embrace.
Again, nothing.
to, huh, I
“I was never enough for him.” She whispered. “All I ever wanted was for him to be proud of me, just once.”
