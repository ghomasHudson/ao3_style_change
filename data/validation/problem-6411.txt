Steve snorts. "If that's out of practice, I'm not sure I'd survive you in top form. It was goddamn fantastic."
"I'm sorry." Steve had looked miserable and tragic. He was crying again, and it figured that Tony's own eyes remained dry. "I was wrong. I didn't want you to hurt for nothing if it was a lie. And then when all signs pointed that it was indeed true, I didn't know how to tell you. I know I should have—"
She then walked on him, her claws digging in his side expressly to tickle. Her eyes were bright as she reveled in making him squirm. Two could play that game, so Tony moved fast and caught her legs, then used his other hand to dig his fingers at the juncture of wing and body. Cora squawked in outrage, flapping her wings as she tried to get away.
He's pleased that Tony likes what he sees. The praise makes Steve wish to preen, but there's unfairness afoot right now.
He watches with attention when Wanda steps through Steve. She frowns for a second, rubbing her upper arm, but then continues on her way. She's arm in arm with Vision, and they seem happy and relaxed. Good for them if they could find each other in this universe, too. Steve and he are walking against the flow, and at one point Steve looks back, then stops in his tracks with a bewildered expression. Curious, Tony turns around.
"Nick!" Carol cries out joyously, hurrying to go hug him, which makes Fury grin as he returns the embrace.
They bump against each other one morning, Tony turning the corner to go into the kitchen while Steve is leaving it. It's an actual collision and it feels like bouncing off a rock, but Steve catches Tony's upper arms so he doesn't ricochet into the door frame or the wall.
"Yes, dinner," Steve says, struggling to keep eye contact with Tony, who on the contrary is making evasive maneuvers, trying to wiggle out of his arms. 'What did you think we were talking about?"
"No you don't," Tony replies. "You knew brainwashed-me, who was incredibly naïve and trusted you. You lied to me, and if there's one thing I hate, it's that."
Well, that's another shock. He can't help but to turn around, and Steve, in a small group circling this year's co-chairs, glances towards the bar at the same time. Their eyes meet and Steve immediately smiles, which lights up his face. It's very sweet to feel his regard following something as simple as a brief eye contact. There's a waver in Tony's soul in return that he swiftly tamps down. Tony's own expression must be off because Steve's smile dims and his face morphs into a concerned frown.
Tony huffs in amusement. "I thought it wasn't long enough. Didn't figure I'd have to climb back up there eleven gazillion times in a row. But believe me, I will."
Tony swallows. This is not just a kiss-under-the-mistletoe-for-tradition, it's a declaration of intent.
Frankly, Tony hates the Sovereign immediately, a sentiment that his companions seem to share. Steve, who is ever gracious in official functions, can barely muster a smile. Not to say that the Sovereign are warm and cuddly. On the contrary, they’re condescending and cold but also scrupulously polite. After a quick assessment, Tony decides to play the obsequious game. They think they're the bee's knees? Then he’ll give them what they think they deserve.
A voice on speaker startles them. "If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. Did you really think I wanted more of you?"
Grief over his mother again. The horror of seeing her being choked to death on the tape, and the red mist that took over when Steve confessed that
"Definitely too late, Lang," Rhodey says. Said Lang looks at him with wariness, which prompts him to add, "Yes, I know about you, Ant-Man."
It's 8 o'clock, but he's been out of bed for three hours already, including a complete thirty-mile run. Steve crashed right after they got home the previous afternoon, but he woke up ten hours later with his mind racing. Now that he's back, and they’ve earned several days of downtime to compensate for two weeks of absolute madness, how can he manage to go back to the Tower? Hopefully, he'll find an angle through this call, maybe even for today.
DUM-E is in on the party as the music booms in the workshop. Tony grins when he rolls backwards, bopping in time to the beat.
There's suddenly a newcomer at Steve's side with a maroon, black, and light gray suit, who opens his metallic helmet with red eyes to gape. Tony doesn't know where he came from.
"He found him first, too, but just barely. With the help of T'Challa—that's T'Chaka's son who is also the Black Panther—we arrested Steve, Sam, and Barnes."
"Really?" Tony stretches out the word for emphasis, intrigued by the gossip. Rhodey likes his women headstrong, so it's not surprising.
"I think… I think we need to talk," Steve says, taking his cowl off. He's absolutely lovely with his tousled hair and bright pink cheeks from the icy wind on the trip back.
The problem is that Tony is soon out of earshot of the camp, but he still hasn't crossed the big trail he'd followed while entering the forest, before hearing the voices. Tony stops, confused, and scans his surroundings. Not knowing these woods, there are no markers to assure him he's going in the right direction. Or any sign of the forest's edge, or sounds from the official Army barracks, or the village where Tony has rented a house.
He's close now, but Tony doesn't dare look at Steve. Yes, this was an idiotic idea. His heart is racing, and he's considering re-opening the rear hatch and flying away (sans suit, more cathartic).
This is excellent news. In fact, it's life changing, but Tony is so confused. "But you never stayed! The night, I mean. You always left."
"Yeah," she says with a smile. "I miss it sometimes, in all of its backyard and fucked up glory. Fast cars, rock-and-roll, and cheeseburgers, baby. There's no place like home."
"That would be stupid, and we're trying to not be idiots, Steve, at least when we’re dealing with aliens," Tony says, putting on his clothes from the night before. It's not ideal, with the smell of sweat mixed with something sweet, but they can't go to breakfast in borrowed pajamas. He should have put them in the sonic shower.
"Right." Tony winces. He hadn't thought of it like that, but he would have worried too. "But that's what happened. I had this fight with Steve-"
"Jeez," Tony says gruffly, squeezing Steve's hand in reassurance. "Of course. I'd never want you dead, Cap, and I'd be grateful to find you again too."
"I've got you," Steve says, wiping a mix of spit, precome, and lube off his chin with the back of his hand. He sits on his haunches, and that magnificent cock is just as hard as when they started, flushed red and enticing. He looks so wet too.
A direct contact feels amazing and Steve moans, swaying forward. It won't take much, that's for certain. If Tony moved his hand, as he's just holding Steve's cock right now.
Before the space tour, as Tony calls it, the Avengers and Fury devised a strategy for what information could be shared about Earth and their fights. Tony agrees with the basic principles Steve relayed: there will be no discussion of the Time Heist, as they call it, with anyone. Mastering time travel is a powerful advantage, one they don't wish to disclose. So they built a separate cover story since no one but the Avengers knows that Thanos destroyed the stones and then died by Thor's hand right after the Decimation. There had been a ripple in the universe, but nothing more than rumors about the cause of it.
In what he hopes conveys his gratitude, Tony taps Steve's palm with his wing, then adds a cheek rub for good measure.
"I'm working on it! It won't happen again, I swear. I will make a backup power source with emergency thrusters that will have a shielding against electronic disruption so secure that they'll want it for Fort Knox. Metaphorically."
"Don't mention it. Oh, and after, I'm taking you out. There's a nice little Greek place on 7th Street, you'll love their Pastitsio."
Upon hearing Tony, Snowball leaves her noodle and swims back towards him. She even manages to meow doing so, which is hilarious.
"Everything you do is amazing." Steve kisses his neck. "Is this a good time to stop? You should sleep."
Steve proves that he warrants his master strategist and tactician reputation by sliding a large hand between them and pushing down underwear until he's holding both their cocks in his fist. Fuck, but it feels amazing, and Tony happily thrusts into the snug fit.
Steve's phone is ringing when he gets out of his shower the morning after they get back to the compound. It's a thrill to see 'Tony' on the caller ID as he picks it up.
"That's an interesting look on your face," Natasha says. She's refueling herself, but seems to be more interested in analyzing her coworkers.
He finally pushes in his finger to the first knuckle and yeah, that's more like it. Tony is ready to plead again—he needs more—but Steve kisses down his body, intent clear.
to count cards; it's that his brain does it naturally. Calculating the odds is as automatic as breathing, and he's really, really good at tracking who has what and the cards that are put aside. Or, in this game's case, tiles flipped over and moving between players.
Fine. Tony walks towards the fields and forest just outside of the village on purpose. If a certain unit decided to camp by themselves, it would make sense they'd go there. Hopefully.
Lo and behold, the nanites pour out to cover Steve's hand until the reactor itself has disappeared and changed into a functional gauntlet, repulsor included.
After looking around the small kitchenette, Tony found the fridge—and a juice box!—and is now trying to work out the coffee maker. He located it by smell, honed by decades of caffeine addiction. Steve guesses his goal and kindly shows him how to prepare a cup.
"It's a date then, big guy! Can't wait!" Tony says, before getting tacked by an enthusiastic Thor who hasn't read or noticed The Moment at all.
Tony almost yelps in surprise when Steve rises from the bed as if he doesn't have a grown man on his lap. He's so incredibly strong that it looks effortless. Steve then turns sideways to climb back on the cot on his knees and gently deposits Tony on his back.
What caught Steve's attention is the Fantastic Four, hanging together as they often do at events like this.
"Our girls, you mean," Tony says, stretching to peer inside the box. The declaration makes Steve's heart soar. He thinks of the cats as Tony's, he's so protective of them, and so being included is a big deal.
And that, more than anything, makes Tony pause. Maybe there's more potential in starting something with Steve than he first thought.
Drunk on sex, love, and maybe still a bit of whiskey, Steve resolutely chases his—and Tony's—happy ending.
"Or slumbering, anyway. But they need to eat in a few." Tony has set a countdown that shows fourteen minutes and something seconds. "Do you think they'll wake up on their own?"
Carol seems perfectly at ease as she leads them deeper into the room. Tony wonders if she's an actual regular or if she's just faking it well. Steve follows, then Tony, while Nebula closes their ranks. There's a maturity in Steve's stance and walk that Tony hadn't noticed until now. He looks good, his steps wide and powerful, and it speaks to his experience and confidence. It's very sexy, and for the first time since Iantus, Tony lets himself openly admire the man. He'd despair that his libido is the first part of himself to get over the hurt, but he's self-aware enough not to be surprised. Frankly, Steve's strut wouldn't be out of place on a catwalk. When Tony averts his eyes from Steve's amazing ass, he notes that they've caught many patrons' attention.
"No," he declares passionately. "You dared take him once and I promise that you'll never do that again. Tony Stark isn't a pawn for your empire. He's an Avenger. He's mine. And you can't have him!"
The instructions are simple, firm, and Steve happily obliges, pulling Tony's erection out of his pants—no underwear, look at that!—through the gap left by the open zipper. He's leaning in to lick when Tony grabs his hair again, though he doesn't pull. Steve is now torn between annoyance and anticipation.
"Cute idea, but I'm thinking about something simpler. A wagon that self propels, basically." Tony is tracing lines on the tabletop with his fingers as if he's drawing it, filling Steve with curiosity. He gets up again and fetches paper and a pencil.
Bucky doesn't even turn to look at her. He's still staring forward, holding each side of the table he's sitting on while Mechanic-Tony continues to work. "Sharon's a time-management wizard."
"Great." Tony straddles Steve's thighs, who is enticingly hard in his pajama pants. He kisses him again with all the passion he feels too. "It's a shame I don't have the time to make love to you like you deserve, gorgeous," he says when he breaks the kiss, caressing the side of Steve's face.
"The things I'll do to you," Tony promises intently, and he's delighted when he feels a shudder go through Steve.
He can feel there’s something between them, but he has no idea what it is. She cares in her own way, and Steve did say she was protective of him. Tony experienced it firsthand when she firmly put him to bed. It's definitely not a physical attraction, which he would recognize. Friendship, surely, but there’s a little extra that he can’t put his finger on and it's unnerving.
"I think you're laying it on thick," Steve says. He and Nebula are sitting stiffly, scanning the crowd for any fools who would rise to the bait.
Tony taps his head. "It unlocked the floodgates. Carol and I realized we had a friend in common, and she brought me back. Tah dah!"
"No, wait a second. Where are my little ones?" Tony calls out, then does kissing noises. "Come on out, gremlins!"
"Oh no, it's not a problem. I need to get my men, anyway." Steve then perks up, looking in the distance. "Speaking of the devil…" Steve curls his palms around his mouth and shouts. "I'm fine, coming to you now."
He doesn't make excuses, even if he could, and Tony appreciates it. He acknowledges the apology with a nod.
Oh, yeah, that's pretty basic. Tony approaches the security panel and puts his hand on the sensor pad. It's not the same model from when he left for Asgard, and he wonders if it's a good or a bad thing.
If touching a person's daemon indicates to Asgardian that people are in a relationship, it explains several of Thor's remarks, and the single bed.
"Yes, but lots of people know you. You're famous. Very rich, your father has this huge company. Weapon manufacturing."
"Powers." Steve is clearly curious, but also hard in his pants, and he groans when Tony, admittedly unfairly, grinds the heel of his hand on his erection. "Okay, we'll talk later."
"I do," Steve interrupts. "Don't worry, I'm fine. I know it seems like forever, but it's only been three and a half years."
Steve's untouched dick jumps at that, totally on board with the idea. He's careful not to knee Tony anywhere by accident as he moves up his body, but is soon in position. He helps Tony prop his head and shoulders up a bit with his pillow and is still unprepared when Tony grabs his cock. Steve moans at the touch, stuttering forward to seek more friction. God, Tony's hand is perfect, the callouses the exact amount of rough to make pleasure spike.
This is not how Tony had planned on going to Steve's home in Brooklyn for the first time, but beggars can't be choosers and he's stuck. Literally.
. Holy shit. That's… even more unbelievable than the fact that he has a daughter, but there it is. Wow. It explains why Pepper was on the battlefield in the last battle with Thanos then.
Thor spoke of his home planet with such pride and fondness. Tony is disappointed that he never got to see Asgard. Or maybe he did. He should ask at one point.
"It's my ship, and I'll explain what we've been working on to increase her speed once you’ve taken a nap." Clearly she knows him enough to anticipate his requests.
Both the kittens are making little movements with their paws, and Steve gives a thought to their mother.
Steve lights up a bundle of dry Sage, does a few passes over Tony, and says the counterspell out loud in fluent Latin. There's no time to marvel about it: the air immediately crackles as Victor's spell breaks. The tension that kept Tony shifted disappears, and he pushes outwards.
Tony cackles, proud as a peacock that his five year old is dishing out physics lessons. Of course Morgan is a genius, and Steve couldn't love them more.
"That I want you? Of course. That I won't fuck it up? Not so much," Tony says, his smile faltering. It's understandable that he's nervous; the end of his relationship with Pepper wasn’t easy.
Still reeling, Tony leaves the photo roll to look at picture albums only to get another whiplash: he sees his and Pepper's wedding pictures. She's a stunning bride in a simple dress made of white lace while Tony is in a classic tuxedo. He can't stop looking at his own face, the way he’s beaming. He looks so happy. The date says September 2018, so it was before Morgan was born. But what the hell happened for Steve to say that Tony didn't have anyone at home? Tony checks his left hand and there's no wedding band on his ring finger—he would have noticed that immediately anyway—but no mark either. Playing detective in the camera roll again, Tony sees that it disappeared in the last six months. Divorced, then, or at least separated. It leaves a bitter taste in his mouth that he and Pepper didn't make it work, even with a kid.
"She drank it all?" the vet says. "Okay. Now we have to clean her mouth so the hair doesn't get sticky and stiff, and help her with a bathroom break. She won't be able to use a litter tray for several weeks."
Nat is aware of the danger, and she's thrown a few times at first to keep Rumlow from taking too much of a lead. She and Bucky haven't caught him wrongfooted, though. Eventually, she focuses back on the batter, her fox ears twitching in ascent at Thor's request for her next pitch. Thor has a powerful arm in Half State because of his kodiak anima, and he's more than able to beat Rumlow at second base if he tries to steal it.
Four heads swivel towards him and the joy on everyone's face as they wave at him is heartwarming. He enthusiastically waves back.
"Yeah. We finally made up. And since we were together, as we should have been, we won this time." Steve looks so earnest about it, so glad that they pushed past the bad blood between them, that it soothes Tony a bit.
Tony could hear his voice climbing as he went from hurt to angry. He was getting worked up, and he jumped to his feet to pace. Well, that explained why Steve had been so weird. And why he didn't want Tony to look into Hydra too much.
Tony uses the flight aids on his back and winglets to aid the boots as he lifts off, holding his two teammates. With FRIDAY's help, he makes a beeline as cleanly as he can manage to the Blaze where Carol is waiting for them. Thankfully, it goes great, and Tony doesn't even have to worry about the landing near the loading ramp.
"Everything about you is amazing," Steve whispers before leaning down for the privilege of finally kissing Tony.
"Buck-" Steve protests. Now's not the time to tease since Tony is in earshot, but when has that stopped his best friend?
"You couldn't have known," Tony says. He's calmed down enough to go sit back on the bed. "Tell me they didn’t manage to make more super soldiers with Howard's formula."
It's both sweet and electric, in a way that makes Steve's stomach flip with a sensation of freefall. The good kind: not a controlled descent, but one you know it will be great and thrilling, anyway.
When Tony woke up from his earlier nap, he opened his eyes to Cora perched on Steve's chest. She had a wing completely extended, and Steve was reverently touching her feathers.
Oh God, his mom. Grief is a strange beast. It has the capacity to submerge you as deeply and strongly as when you've just experienced a loss, out of nowhere. And this is a tidal wave that makes Tony feel as if he's going to choke on it. He brings his knees up to curl forward and lean his forehead on them, breathing slowly through clenched teeth, hugging his shins.
A bright future is shimmering in front of Tony, promising companionship, love, and happiness. With Steve, of course, and hopefully they'll work out in the long term. But Tony is starting to accept that Cora will always be with him, too. Whether or not he sees her, he'll never be truly alone, and never was.
They’re silent for a long while after that, Tony still holding Steve's wrist. The strong beat of his pulse is calming, but everything Tony learned is playing on a loop in his head and he hates it. He needs to process all of this information and hurt again. Which is definitely shitty even if he can’t remember the first time.
"So fierce," Tony says with an amused huff. "Shush, you, keep your strength. It's going to be okay."
He presses the left arrow button again, and the portal window appears… with a view of suburbia. There's a white cottage, with a double driveway and garage, complete with a well mowed lawn and trees in the back.
After a moment of hesitation, Tony detaches the device from his chest. He'd feel safer with it, but the direct link to his brain is probably more than he should take on for the moment.
Tony can only watch in awe as the nanites morph to create all the hydraulics, wiring, electronics, and eventually the plating that make up the armor. It starts from his chest and expands, and in less than a minute he's completely encased. The HUD lights up, and there it is: all the usual readings of a functional suit. Tony's heart is racing because it's a huge development. He's so, so far from this technology at the moment, and eleven years seems like a ridiculously short amount of time to get there.
Humming, Tony leans up for a repeat. This time the kiss is more heated from the getgo, turning hot and wet, full of passion. This is going to be good, so good. He's walking back towards the bed, pulling Steve with him, when Cora interrupts.
"I'm sorry, love," Tony says. His goal isn't to hurt Steve's pride, but to keep him safe. "You're not ready yet."
"That's it, come on," Steve encourages, fucking in with strong but shallow thrusts. "Please, Tony, please, let go for me."
He thinks Steve understands as more kisses follow. Then there's the uncomfortable uncoupling—Tony knows he’ll be sore tomorrow—and the hassle of cleaning up, including changing the sheets because the bed's a mess. But at last they cuddle, interlocking like puzzle pieces, and Tony’s convinced that's where he belongs. He's almost certain that he has all of his memories back, and he can't remember feeling this content before.
Steve blinks and lets go of Tony's arm with one hand to take out his phone, but the fool doesn't let go with the other. It's infuriating. And even though Tony is doing his best to pull back from the portal too, the endgame feels inevitable: he's going in. Meanwhile, it's like being in a tug-o-war between two immense forces, and the strain on his shoulder is excruciating. He never should have stepped out of the armor to investigate the console; now there's only his squishy human body taking all of this pressure and being almost quartered.
Tony scratches, and he scratches, and even tries an uneven pattern when Steve is oblivious and continues to turn the pages on his book.
"Okay, okay," Steve says indulgently, following him. "I can't dance, not really, but this looks like something I can do."
Using Tony coming back, Carol's presence, Zemo and the Siberia super soldiers, and Steve's cooperation as leverage, as well as Fury's influence, Rhodey negotiated with the United Nations. It led to the creation of a committee dedicated to an extensive rework of the Sokovia Accords. Even better, they took their responsibility away from Thaddeus Ross to give it to T'Challa, which made the former spitting mad (a nice bonus).
"Maybe you should think the nanites back into the case." Steve bites his lip, looking guilty. "I shouldn't have pushed you to use it yet."
Tony looks even more concerned now. "Are you alright? I'm sorry we haven't found Barnes yet, but I thought you felt as if you fit in better—"
Meeting the Sovereign is indeed a grand affair. And yes, they take themselves very seriously. Tony has often boasted his own importance, mostly as a deflection, but these people bring it to the next level. Not only do they look down at them all as if they're nothing but evolved apes, but they're also putting on a show to hammer home their alleged superiority.
"Fan mail had multiple invites from middle school students enrolled in Thomas Jefferson's University Saturday Academy, in Philadelphia. Their science fair is this afternoon."  FRIDAY puts the colorful advertisement on the screen, then switches to a slick and polished flyer. "And the Unicef Snowflake Ball, eight-thirty tonight at Cipriani Wall Street. Optional since Ms Romanov and Captain Rogers already confirmed."
"He asked his gang to finish and humiliate us, then said the public should see that the Avengers are all too-human. I inferred his own ego was his weakness."
"Where is it, anyway? The armor?" He wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands. It must be in the spaceship with their alien friends. How is that for an unexpected sentence?
In Leipzig, they concluded that they needed to set the trap away from New York City and possible civilian casualties. Therefore, Avengers Tower was out. Tony suggested building a new compound for the Avengers in upstate New York, but the timeline was too uncertain to make sure there are enough defenses in time. Instead, after negotiating with the Air Force and NASA—Rhodey is a super-star at that—they go back to the rebuilt Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility in the Mojave desert. It's where they used to keep the Tesseract before Loki stole it in 2012. It's also a nod to Dr. Lawson's participation in the P.E.G.A.S.U.S. project, and where Carol relearned her history with Fury. As for Carol herself, she stays on Talos' ship that is cloaked behind the moon; they're worried that her presence, if obvious, would be too much of a deterrent for the Kree.
He approaches and sits on the edge, feet and calves in the water. Callie, now on his lap, is side-eyeing the pool, and doesn't look like she wants to jump in at all.
It goes on for a maybe a minute or two until Tony's thirst is quenched. When he's had enough, he leans back instead of forward and Steve immediately gets the message.
He's staring at the floor, jaw clenched tight. "You went away because I hurt you. And then, and then—"
They are distracted when a blond woman enters the garage from the house, a drink in hand that looks like ice tea. She reminds Tony of someone, but he can't place her.
That's not much. Whatever happened, it's bound to upset him. It’ll be a distraction from the visit itself, which isn’t the best idea considering he’s already at a disadvantage with his memory loss.
"Only if you want to?" Steve can't help but voice it as a question, now overcome with doubt. What did he do? He's itching to flee so badly, and then pretend this conversation never happened. When Tony keeps staring at him, as if poleaxed, Steve tries to smile (it feels like a grimace). "Never mind, don't worry about it. I'll go back to the cleanup, yeah? Bye."
"The best hand is an uninterrupted series, with all different colors," he says, leaning into Tony. "The higher the value, the better."
He still can't believe that Tony forged a literal suit of armor, almost like the old knights. And used it to help free Timely from Fisk and his gang, too. Steve wishes he could have seen that, the recounting he heard was epic.
Cora draws a lot of attention as they follow Thor through the large dining room on their way to the head table. Tony notices hushed conversation, and there are several people staring. It could be the Iron Man armor—it stands out—but he's certain it's only part of it. Being observed isn't new for him, but Tony is hyper aware of it now. Every Asgardian daemon they've seen until now, may it be from the ruling class or the common folks, are mythical or fantastical creatures. Hell, there's an unicorn and what looks like a small dragon just ahead of them right this moment. But the dinner guests look blasé about it and are fixating on Tony's crow instead. It's positive attention, though, mostly curiosity and respect. It makes Tony keep his head high, and Cora does the same. She's pretty badass-looking, her feathers gleaming with an indigo sheen under the dining room's lighting. Frigga has risen from her seat and is waiting for them with a welcoming smile.
As for the notes and blueprints… Well, they lost those in the explosion. But Tony has an excellent memory, especially if it's something he's built once. Combine that with Talos' machine, and Tony recreated the plans for the core of the light-speed engine pretty easily. It's meant as bait for the Kree, but it's also just as fascinating and a game changer as it was two years ago. Tony has to restrain himself sometimes not to fall into the rabbit hole of concentrating on that project alone.
She leaves the shelter of Steve’s hand and climbs on Tony’s armored thigh, then sits back on her haunches, body raised and front paws curled on her white chest. There’s also a judging expression on Lilly’s little face that is so very Steve. She’s precious, and Tony retracts a gauntlet to reach out with one finger, petting her small head and then scratching under her jaw. Lilly’s fur is soft, and when Tony glances at Steve he’s looking fondly at their interaction.
"That's it, run!" Tony yells, then powers down the core with the remote and makes eye contact with Wanda.
Tony wets his lower lips and Steve's blue eyes follow the movement, making desire flare up in Tony's gut. Steve looks like a man parched and in reach of an oasis, or maybe more appropriately like a wolf ready to pounce on a prey. Tony still voices a warning, just in case.
"Do you plan or just looking, or—" Tony trails off. He opens his legs a tad, just enough to be suggestive, and then grabs his cock to give it a slow stroke. It makes a pearly drop of pre-come appear at the tip, that Tony spreads around with his thumb with a visible shudder of pleasure.
"Excellent, and I'm not surprised. You take such great care of them," Steve says. Callie is wiggling in his hand and is probably hungry (when is she not, though?) He puts her down for the moment and pets Snowball, who is irate at not getting attention. "Those kittens are damn lucky, for sure."
. Responsible or not, if Barnes was here right now, Tony isn’t sure that he could stop himself from going after him. There’s something dark and violent churning in Tony's gut that mixed with the pain, makes him want to hurt someone back.
But then again, of course Steve's childhood friend is more important than him, he thinks snidely at himself. There was no way he could ever match up to that, and he just projected his feelings like the lovesick idiot he was.
"Give her over," Tony says, and it's with something very close to a pout that Steve lets him take the kitten and her syringe.
The porch that wraps around the house makes it easy to reach the side that faces the lake. There's a small slope towards its iced surface, not very steep but angled enough to allow sliding down. That's where he finds Morgan, Peter, Rhodes and Tony, busy playing together. They're all bundled up in ski suits, hats, scarfs and mittens, and even from afar Steve can see their reddened cheeks.
"Hopefully he learned from his mistakes," Steve says, back to being serious. "And doesn't take you for granted anymore."
God, he's close friends with Captain America, who thinks the world of him. It's hard to believe, but it sure feels wonderful.
"The same holds true for me," she says, squeezing his hand. "Take good care of your little princess."
"I think so. If not, I'm pretty sure we need to wake them," Steve says, rolling a chair next to Tony's to gaze at the babies too.
Steve gets up and walks a few steps away to call Fury, not wanting to wake the boy. He explains the situation as best he can, and Fury tells him they're sending someone over. When he turns towards Tony again, Steve's heart thuds at the new scene. Tony has now tipped the kid sideways into a classic cradling position and is gazing down at him with a soft look on his face.
Tony can't even imagine the magnitude of the catastrophe if he had shot the actual Tesseract on Asgard, and not just the core with parts of its power inside. That would have done more than destroy the room Tony was using and give him powers; the blast would have annihilated him—along with Yon-Rogg and the rest of his Starforce team. Thankfully, he'd been working on Mar-Vell's design with a similar amount of energy that was in the core during Carol's accident, another similarity in their stories. With the Tesseract safe in the Asgardian's vault, Tony can now try again.
Maybe. Tony's not totally convinced; maybe lying low and playing stupid like they did with the Sovereign would be best. But they're here now, and they agreed to this mission before he lost his memories, so there’s little to do about Tony's doubts.
Inexplicably, tears had begun rolling down Steve's cheeks and Tony hadn't known what to do but to pull him into a hug.
Steve has to close his eyes from the dual attack of the perfect suction and the devastating beauty of Tony sucking his cock. It almost makes him lose control right there and then. The problem is that not looking exacerbates everything else that Tony's doing perfectly with his mouth, but also his possessive grip on Steve's hips, the sinful wet noises and the intoxicating smell of arousal.
Over the last years, Tony has tried to keep his vanity in check, but so much of his identity used to be about his image that it's hard to let go. Steve's words are more of a reassurance than he knows. But even so, he looks like an old man!
"You're weird." Steve has crossed his forearms on the ledge and is observing him with amusement now.
The press conference that was arranged to explain those developments also served as a showcase for Tony's return. Tony waited a block away as Rhodey, on a stage filled with all of their superhero friends, explained their position.
Spotting no visible furballs, he crouches near their box and opens up the lid. Snowball has flopped right on top of Callie, but they are both fast asleep. Steve takes a picture to add to his growing collection, and closes the lid.
"You? You didn't—" He stops and grimaces, and yeah, Tony won't believe that this isn’t his fault. "It's nothing
"Got it," Steve says. He's sure he has the right bag, the tiny sound clear this time when it's jostled.
Steve frowns as he looks up at Tony's face, then something clicks and he smiles. "No. I mean yes, of course, very, very nice. But you've always been handsome. I meant you're hot to the touch."
"I only have eyes for you, honeybunch," Tony teases, kissing the tip of his nose. He still remembers Steve's delight at first, though. "And I'll try to get to know him, if he wants. I was mostly mad at Bucky because you chose him over me." Tony grimaces at his own words, knowing it may appear silly. "I realize how childish it sounds."
"In conclusion, we've heard the 117 nations that signed the Sokovia Accords," Rhodey had said. "The superhero community believes in accountability. But we also believe in responsibility. Nations have borders and sovereignty, that's not in question. But more and more we face global and even extraterrestrial threats that do not look at lines on a map. The rules that many wish to be put in place need to account for exceptional situations where there might not be time to follow a set procedure. The notion of super hero evaluations and registration also raises concerns among our ranks. But we stand before you as a united front in our commitment to draft a new version of the Accords, under King T'Challa's leadership, that we can all agree on. I thank you for your attention today. I'll open questions for 15 minutes, and then we have a surprise for you," Rhodey concluded.
They should bring in as much evidence of the man's duplicity as they can to help their cause. Unfortunately, that means the dreaded VHS tape, which seems intact under the still fuming monitor when Tony goes to retrieve it. Just touching it makes Tony's skin crawl, and it must show on his face.
He leans in for a kiss that is more emotional than lustful this time, and it's very sweet. Enough for Tony to risk going too strong too fast, but that's always been his M.O. in everything.
"Of course!" Tony says. "Can't have them loose if there's no one to hold them." He wouldn't put the kittens’ safety in jeopardy, as careless as he often is with himself.
"To make a long story short, the Krees wanted the engine's core. They made my plane crash, killing Dr. Lawson. When they came for the core, I shot it and it exploded, giving me powers." She makes her fists glow at that, which has Rhodey tense a bit. Tony taps his thigh in reassurance and he relaxes. "Yon-Rogg—"
Tony's orgasm unfolds so forcefully that he spasms and shakes as it rips through him and makes his entire body sing. Even better, when he opens his eyes, he does so in time to see release hit Steve just as strongly. Even his "O" face is beautiful. That's how gorgeous Steve is. He fucks in a couple more times, chasing the aftershocks, but soon he lowers himself to lie on top of Tony, without his full weight as he's balancing on forearms planted by Tony's head. He's still holding Tony's right hand, but when he's wiped his other hand on the sheets, Tony’s free to trace up and down Steve's spine with his left hand.
"It's such an honor, Mister Stark! I am so happy you are back. I'm Peter. Peter Parker. Well Spider-Man, too, of course. Oh wow."
The blowjob is a little sloppy because of Steve's enthusiasm, but he gets nothing but compliments and revels in it. To avoid jerking off since Tony asked him not to, Steve grabs the back of Tony's thighs with two fistfuls of his perfectly cut dress pants. The contrast of Tony being fully dressed with just his cock out while Steve services him almost naked is hot as hell. It's that power play Tony was talking about, expressed differently, and yes, Steve likes it too. He might be a submissive, after all. This is a nice day for self-discoveries.
Att-Lass shoots first, but it bounces harmlessly off the shield. Steve throws it again, and Tony fires photon blasts too, forcing the Krees to duck out of the room and into the corridor. The goal is to push them outside and hope that the Starforce calls the rest of the Krees for reinforcement, thinking they can overpower them. For now, it seems to go according to plan. Steve stalks forward, full of barely contained fury, and Att-Lass must see it in his expression because he gestures for the others to retreat.
"Daemons," Thor repeats, scratching the lioness's flank. "A companion that is the physical embodiment of your soul."
"Which is why you wanted the rest of the Avengers here in full force," Tony says with a huff. "Not cool. I'm not even back for 12 hours, and supposed friends are trying to steal the Quinjet from my other friends instead of talking to each other."
Unfortunately, Zemo doesn't comply. He takes out a handgun and checks if it's loaded. Tony is certain he's going to blow his brain out. He wants to do something on his phone first though, as he touches a few keys and brings it to his ear, turning his chair around. If they want to catch him alive and make it easier to untangle everything, there is a small window of opportunity. Tony can try, at the very least. He puts his hands on the wall, but stops when he sees the gold of his new ring. How will it react to his powers? Clothes don't burn, but this is metal. He doesn't want to take any chances until he has done a few tests.
Tony shuts the computer and core down for the day, and soon they're going to their room. One room, singular, which has been a very welcome evolution in their relationship. Now that they finally talked instead of trying to read each other's mind, there's no sneaking out after sex, and Tony is blissfully happy. They've rarely been apart since their reunion, to a point that it might not be healthy, but he doesn't care. Steve insists on staying in the lab with Tony whenever he can, and Tony doesn't have the heart to refuse him anything.
"Neither." He's not surprised that Tony thought of the girls on the team; it's not like Steve’s ever came out to anyone. This century, at least. He feels suddenly brave enough to do so, which might be a way of testing the waters at the same time. "Not a girl, in fact."
Inside, Steve is in bed, but sitting against his headboard and reading. An actual book and not on his phone, too. Tony can't help a wave of deep fondness for the man, he's adorable. But now's not the time to admire Steve's beauty, Tony needs help. Crying out is out of the question—he doesn't have the voice for it—so he settles for scratching the window that was clearly warded, too. It's not very loud, but hopefully, it's enough. After all, Steve's senses are better than a baseline human.
"It's a bit early to talk about these things, sweetheart," Tony says, cupping Steve's cheek. "We're just learning about each other and what works for us. Plenty of time to see if kink is part of it or not."
For a moment, everything is wonderful. Steve pushes into the touch and brings up a large hand to delicately cradle Tony's neck. He kisses back and groans, low and sexy, which makes a shiver go down Tony's spine. But just as Tony teases the seam of Steve's plush mouth with his tongue, Steve rears back violently. He gets away so fast that he stumbles off the bed.
They take a short flight—or leap—to land next to Rhodey's side. Steve, who'd been resolute but still amicable, now looks enraged. He barely spares a look at Carol and Peter, eyes fixed on the Iron Man armor, before he turns towards Rhodey and sneers.
It's such a Tony thing to do, to name a black cat Snowball, and not the white one. He looks so proud of himself, eyes dancing in amusement, that Steve falls in love all over again.
"Okay, fair, but I'm sure I can do it," Tony argues. "I have little to do at the moment, honestly. If you tell me exactly what to do, I swear I'll follow the instructions. Just until you find good people for them."
She smiles outright at that, and Tony is utterly charmed by the joy on her face. It's a lovely look on her. He might lose on purpose, just to see more of it.
"He's doing well, though busy with setting things right with everyone coming back," Nebula says before she freezes for a second, lowering her hand. "It's true, you don't remember—"
That's exactly what they hoped for. She'll wait for them to engage, and then light them up. When Tony catches up to Steve, they're almost out of the facility and Nat and Clint join them. It's together that they push the three Kree out… only to encounter several more units, including a familiar face.
"No worries, I thought that too, before I turned the first time. It's a common misconception," Tony reassures. "Not in your books, huh?"
"Sure," Viv says. Now that the surprise has passed, she doesn't seem to care one way or the other. "I'll let you in consulting room two, Doctor Martin will be with you shortly."
Frankly, the whole thing is a mess, and Tony is wishing for the Krees to get here already so he can burn out some frustration in a good fight. Kicking ass always makes him feel better.
"Morgan is the most important person in your life," Steve starts. "We thought that if there was one thing that might surface by itself, it was her. Until now, telling you things that happened didn't jog your memory. We thought cramming too much info at once might not be good, as the doctor said. We’d answer any questions you asked, though."
"If they like us? We're covering our collective asses like you wouldn't believe," Carol said. "The Iantusians won't give their technology or weapons if they deem us less developed than they are. But they'll look out for us."
Tony smiles. "Yeah, the fire chick. Captain Carol Danvers, US Air Force before the Krees grabbed her 27 years ago. She's known as Captain Marvel now, out there." He makes a gesture to point upwards, meaning the rest of the universe. "She, too, was kidnapped, brainwashed, and used as a weapon. See a pattern here?"
"Yeah, but this one is Snowball," Rhodey says, lowering the black kitten onto Wanda's lap, much to her delight.
"Fine," Tony says. "Come here, DUM-E. But do not, and I cannot stress this enough, do NOT touch the box or the kittens."
Snowball still has her harness and leash, and Wanda doesn't quite know what to do with her end. It doesn't prevent the impromptu bath at all, it seems. Steve has never seen a cat in water like that, and frankly Snowball looks like she is having a good time.
"We're going as fast as we can, princess!" Rhodes cries out. "Braces, remember? And your old man is, you know, showing his age!"
"The secret is to let it all out. Let the energy buildup get as powerful as it wants to become, and then push it harder," Carol says.
"We wouldn't!" Morgan says, but her smile is huge as she looks up at Peter and giggles. The teenager winks down at her, unrepentant.
Tony grins. "Definitely likes you back, dear heart. More than you realize. But as much as I'd love to stay to recite the sonnets I composed in your honor, I have to take care of a problem."
It's a low number in blue, though, so Tal doesn't know what he's talking about. The card is perfect for Kol, who is squirming in envy and will therefore leave Tony's hidden cards alone.
"I'm fine," Tony gurgles. He inelegantly crawls backwards to avoid the touch anyway and puts much needed space between them.
"Anyway, I can take care of myself, thank you," Tony says, almost as an aside. He tracks what the two players before him do and times his next remark for when it's his turn. "I killed Thanos and his army, after all."
Good, Steve thinks, but having Tony in his space frays his own nerves so he pours himself a few fingers worth and tosses it back. He almost chokes on the burn, he hasn’t had a drink in a while.
"I know." He squeezes Tony's hand and brings it from sternum to his mouth to kiss his knuckles. It makes Tony's heart flip in his chest, though he's confused by what it means. "You're back. God, Tony…"
"As fascinating as this is, and best of luck to alternate me in tapping that," Tony says, inclining his head towards everything that is well and good in Sheriff-Steve, "I hope this remote works or else we're screwed."
Cora hops onto Tony’s shoulder as Lilly returns to Steve, and they rise too. Frigga extends her hands to them both, and they clasp them lightly in their own and bow. She’s smiling fondly at them.
It's late and Tony somehow ends up sprawled in a lounge chair, looking at the night sky. There are a few stars, but what he can't get enough of are the three moons that he can see without even turning his head. It's
"Well, that depends on the guy," Tony says, tapping a finger on his lower lip. "I'd need more details on what he likes."
"I know, but we were desperate. Where Loki comes in is when we went to New York in 2012 to get three stones. Our Loki died before the Decimation, but that one escaped with the Tesseract so he’s out there somewhere in his own time."
"But—" Tony saw the pictures. Hell, he insisted on inspecting the car. He wanted to know if there was a mechanical defect that could explain the crash (there wasn't). He's always blamed an inebriated Howard for the accident, even if his BAC was relatively low and not over the limit. So it wasn't Howard at all, and it shakes up decades of resentment. But Hydra didn't just kill Howard for politics or whatever it was. "My mom?" he asks, hearing his voice crack.
"Who the hell would—" Tony pauses when he pushes a newspaper aside and finds two minuscule kittens, the black one wriggling and screaming, "Oh my God."
"You are welcome. We are grateful that order was restored, and if we can be of assistance…" The delivery lacks conviction, but it’s a definite win nonetheless. The Sovereign are so prideful, they wouldn't go back on their word, once given, without losing face.
What a wretched lover he makes, taking his pleasure without making sure that Tony was comfortable! He should have been more careful.
"I’m certain." Tony lets go of Steve's shirt to cup his cheek. Steve leans into the touch, so trusting and sweet. "One hundred percent, darling."
Peter's eyes widen and Tony stretches to put a hand over Steve's ear and whisper. "Psychological warfare, nice!"
isn't far, but it isn't harsh either. She provides a towel for Snowball that Tony accepts with a smile, wrapping the kitten up.
The man smiles back, and Tony notes that his teeth are very white but now perfectly normal, no hint of elongated canines.
"I don't know what to do!" Tony says. He turns back to the baby, grabbing one of his feet and then coos at the child with a big smile. "But it's okay, isn't it, sweetheart? We'll figure it out, don't worry!"
"Please tell me they let me fiddle with it," he says with some desperation. He really hopes Steve says yes, because being unable to learn about all of this tech would be torture.
Tony cranes his neck back, and sees Steve hovering in between the kitchen and the lounge, eyes glued to the TV. He's probably on his way to the gym.
What kind of father leaves his daughter to go on a space road trip? God, the pictures seem to show a nice and loving relationship, but if he ditched her like that... A shiver of unease goes down Tony's spine. He really, really hopes that he hasn’t fallen into the trap of being an absent parent. What was he thinking, having a child? Maybe she was an accident, but as soon as he thinks that, Tony chastises himself. Who cares if she was. Morgan is perfect.
The Supreme Intelligence put several Kree top operatives on this, which is flattering. Also, Att-Lass and Van-Igha were part of Tony's team for over a year and he considered them friends. Maybe it's a ploy to make him more reluctant to hurt them.
"I wish," Steve says, looking at Tony's arm. It's true that he might have healed. "I'm sorry you got hurt."
Frigga is right; taking a quiet moment to relax will do Tony some good. Even though the source of his current inner turmoil, also known as the crow that is supposedly the embodiment of his soul, is right here in his face.
A second later strings of web smack against their tube, and Peter yanks in a way that rapidly closes the gap between them. He then secures the two tubes together as they continue their joy ride on the lake's surface, powered by Tony's repulsor. Steve hasn't had this much fun in years.
Maybe it had gotten too much for him… Tony had gone through a lot of hard blows these last few years, not even counting the times he almost died. After reading the Winter Soldier file Natasha gave him, Steve had immediately told Tony his suspicions, that Bucky had probably assassinated his parents.  It had been heart-wrenchingly painful to watch. Tony was furious, yelling about how unfair it was that his mother had paid for his father's obsession with supersoldiers, how he'd spent his life working on them only to be killed by one. Steve had worried he'd lost a dear friend just as he learned Bucky was alive. Tony, being Tony, had disappeared for a week, but resurfaced with a plan to find
"That is the spirit!" Thor gets to his feet and claps his hands. "I will bring you to my mother. She will explain better than me."
Remembering Pepper and their wedding but also their marriage falling apart. Working hard on believing it wasn't his fault. Remembering Pepper being a superhero.
"Hum, if I may, what's a Kree?" a voice says from the balcony, making them all whip their heads around to look at the newcomer. A slight man in a tight red and blue costume with a black spider etched on his chest is standing by the door, just outside. A full cowl covers his face, with two big oblong white eyes. Carol lights up her fists, but Rhodey is already up.
As she grew up, Callie's fur has turned into a mid-long coat of very fine hair that puffs her up. It makes the joke and the contrast with her black – and very sleek – sister who sports the name Snowball even funnier in retrospect.
Tony belatedly wonders if she's self-conscious about the mechanical parts that make up her body. "Do
"Holy shit! You son of a bitch!" Rhodey says, before pushing him back to look at Tony's face, who blinks back his excess emotions and can't stop grinning in return. God, he missed him.
After a last squeeze, Steve had stepped back, then pulled Tony to the workshop's couch where they sat side by side. His face was puffy and red, but at least he'd stopped crying.
A sleeping Steve Rogers is devastatingly beautiful. He's on his side facing Tony, and the light sheet has pooled down to his waist during the night, leaving his upper body on display.  That man is a marvel, and Tony is glad he has a rare opportunity to stare to his heart's content. Steve looks so young when sleeping too, without the furrow between his brow and his world-weary eyes. Definitely not almost forty years old. Then again, they've known for a while that Steve doesn't age as fast as normal people.
The entire scene is vivid in Tony's head now, talking with Thor and Frigga about how touching a daemon only feels good when it's a lover. For sure there wasn't one contact between him and Lilly or Steve and Cora that felt repulsive in the slightest. Right at this moment, Lilly being against his thigh is a balm.
That's not what happened at all, but the actual story—that he got himself stuck and they found them by total accident—is embarrassing. Tony hates looking stupid, especially in front of Richards. He throws a warning look at Steve, who surprises him with a smooth lie of omission.
The screen explodes with a sharp memory: there is a lanky man with a staff in his hand, wearing a green and gold suit of armor, including a cape and a helmet with curved golden horns. He's fighting a well-built man in a red, white, and blue uniform and cowl who holds a round shield in the same colors featuring a star. This person makes Anthony's heart race as much in the memory—as evidenced by a counter in the display before his eyes—than in the present. Anthony is seeing the scene through an interface that analyzes every source of potential danger, zeroing in on the man with the horns. He's flying while blasting loud music, firing a double shot from his hands towards the threat and making him fall to the ground. After landing with one knee and one fist down, Memory-Anthony rises to his feet. He then aims his red and gold armored arms palms up toward the man, and deploys an array of other weapons.
God, there's no turning back; Steve's so gone on this man. Limbs still shaky from his breathtaking orgasm, Steve shuffles down the bed to reposition himself between Tony's legs. Tony's still hard, the sight generating a renewed bolt of lust in Steve's groin, and he'll take care of him in an instant. First, though, Steve takes the time to brush a few curls off Tony's brow, chest full to bursting with affection when Tony sweetly leans into the touch. Clearly he reciprocates Steve's feelings, to a degree at least, which makes his heart soar. He catches Tony's mouth in a deep and thorough kiss, trying to demonstrate the words that he hopes they'll be able to say soon.
Rhodey, flanked by Natasha and T'Challa, walks on the runway to meet the others, all geared up. Steve meets him with Clint and the Maximov twins. It's hard for Tony to take his eyes off Steve in full Captain America regalia. God, he's hot, always has been. But the regular attraction is mixed with a definite longing—Tony has missed him so much— but also sharp sadness and unease about how they left things. Plus a healthy dose of residual frustration.
You've got to give points to Kol that once he's over his shock, he isn’t intimidated at all and throws a punch with his free hand. Once Tony dodges and pushes him away, Kol roars and immediately comes for Tony again. Tal tries to stop him, circling his cousin's torso with his arms, but he's a lot slimmer and it's not very effective.
"Understood, Sir." The armor closes up, and it strides to the first super soldier pod, stops, before walking to the next to repeat its scans. "Of note, as is protocol when the suit is deployed, I have recorded everything from the moment we left Avengers Tower. Including Helmut Zemo's earlier indirect insinuation that he was responsible for Vienna and Berlin in a ploy to ultimately bring you here."
The reality is probably a mix of that and Tony's experience with multiple partners. Steve appreciates reaping the benefits of it, but doesn't want to think about Tony with anyone else.
"Hello, Mister Stark," she says. "It's fantastic to see you awake. I'm Dina, and I'll do a quick exam if you don't mind."
That frankly throws Tony off balance. Yes, he was pissed, and he thinks it was rightly so. But he'd thought a lot about the situation on Asgard before the accident, and since getting his memories back with a new perspective of having been brainwashed, he'd come to realize that Steve had not been in the best headspace at the time. With Hydra rearing up, Bucky reappearing, the guilt at knowing his BFF suffered for years, plus learning about Tony's parents… (Howard was Steve's friend, after all). It was a lot. Tony believes Steve wanted to spare him some pain, as misguided as it was. To see him so torn up about it hurts Tony too.
"Fine," Tony says, climbing in. The mattress is the perfect firmness, and he groans in contentment as he lies down.
"Fucking me?" Tony interrupts with an eyebrow raise. "Yes, and it's been fantastic. I'm pretty sure you're a born Service Top. Meaning you'd be happy to do whatever I ask you to do, including fucking me through the mattress," Tony adds, tightening his hold in Steve's hair sharply.
ancient now—and winces. Not his best comeback. A sudden alarm and red glare on the HUD refocus his attention, but he's a fraction of a second too late. A concussive energy beam hits him directly in the helmet, and he's thrown violently against a wall.
Tony laughs at the joke, but then focuses on Steve, who hasn't moved since Tony exited the suit. He might not have even breathed, eyes wide.
"I'm aware," the Sheriff replies drily. They're making their way to a building marked as STARK INDUSTRIES with a sign advertising shoeings. This reality's him is at least in part blacksmith, then. It makes a hell of a lot of sense as an occupation for a Tony living in the Wild West.
"I did." Rhodey grows serious. "When Thor told us about the accident, because that's what they thought happened, I didn't want to believe it. You wouldn't die in a lab accident."
"Yes, of course," Chancellor Almar says. "We prepared accommodations for you, so you need not travel all the way back to your ship at this hour. Mister Stark, if I may." She extends an arm in invitation to follow her.
Tony looks at him with surprise and smiles. "Yeah? That's great. See, Doc? I think two superheroes can take care of two kittens."
Daring, Steve brings a hand up to cup Tony's cheek, thrilled when he rolls into the touch. "For a while, yes. I find brains sexy, too, so I didn't stand a chance upon meeting you."
"Look, Anthony, we only want the core," Att-Lass says. "Give it over, and we'll leave. If not, we'll need to take it by force, and believe me, your little backward planet isn't ready for it."
"That's... shit!" Tony said, aghast. "Don't worry, we'll find him and give him all the treatment he needs."
It's Tony, he's sure, and Steve raises his head so fast he almost gives himself whiplash. Tony is indeed here, in a black tank-top-and-shorts duo, always such a fantastic look on him. The nice arms on display distract Steve before he remembers that he shouldn't be staring.
"Never happy when you get hurt," Steve says. He looks heartbreakingly sincere. "You scared me—us—again."
Kol's accusations and attacks sparked a brawl, first around the Navive table, but it quickly spread out through the casino. On Tony's left, someone insulted Nebula by calling her Thanos's automaton, which made her snarl and attack. Tony's not surprised to see she excels at hand-to-hand combat. She’s wiping the floor with the asshole in no time.
Tony goes over the letter again. It's dated from today, and Phillips had to censor it before giving it to Tony. It's a stroke of luck that they did not transfer the letters to film and V-mail, as then Tony would have never realized there was something relevant in the correspondence.
"Yeah, so to minimize the changes, we went back in time again after we were done and replaced the stones at the same moment we took it."
"From there, it's about finding somewhere stable to set them up. We've been doing a lot in the Midwest, initially. Cities I can get to in a couple of hours, tops, in case old lives come back."
"I haven't been fucked in, like, fifteen years, but I need that monster cock in me ASAP," Tony says, grinding forward against said dick. He wants it bad.
Steve's grinning, though, as he squirts a big dollop of lube directly onto his own cock. He quickly spreads it and can't seem to resist fucking his own fist a few times. He's been focusing on Tony for a long time, after all.
"That's all I want too, sweetheart," he says, kissing Steve slowly and sweetly. When they break for air, Steve starts nipping and sucking at Tony's jaw and neck, which sends shivers down his spine. "That's—yeah, that's it. I'm easy to please; you'll learn that soon enough. If it feels good, and it's fun for the both of us, I'm down for almost anything."
After a lull in the conversation that stretched to a minute or two, Steve fills the silence once more.
"Yikes," Tony says with a grimace. Visibly hitting Yon-Rogg in the face didn't assuage Steve's anger. "When Captain America advocates for your death, you know you've fucked up."
"She's a Krylorian," Steve says, looking at him strangely like Tony’s the one not making sense instead of the other way around.
"I'm just good with games, pal," Tony says with a shrug, though he gets up too. He won't let the asshat loom over him.
"Wow," Tony says, mesmerized by how gracefully she moves and the destruction she can cause by herself.
Steve hears the other side of the conversation, due to his enhanced hearing. A woman; Viv from the reception, if Steve's not mistaken.
"If your interjection was for us two being screwed," Tony adds. "We're non-corporeal. So I can't jury rig anything from this side of the portal."
"You're such a weirdo," Tony says with a grin when she reaches the side of the pool again and he fishes her out.
They came to Knowhere, and this casino in particular, to pick a fight and cause a big splash. The story of Tony pulling off the best hand possible at Navive to everyone's surprise? It’ll make the rounds. Gossips will speculate about if it was or wasn't Tony's first time playing, for one. If he’s a newbie, heck, even a more experienced player, it shows he's smart and cunning. Many people, like Kol, will accuse Tony of cheating. That's a no-go for many, at least getting caught doing it. But what Tony is doing right now? Talking to Kol as if he's a child and offering a little fortune as if it's nothing to him? That’ll piss off so many people in a world like this. It works with Kol, whose eyes are now bugging out of his skull. He's so enraged that he's vibrating.
She's not wrong, and he's definitely getting old for this. Plus they don’t have Helen Cho's cradle or that alien hospital's tech around to smooth the consequences.
Tony knows that the omission doesn't solely rest on Steve, even though he's been the one catching up Tony until now.
He even reaches towards Tony, who slithers out of the other side of the pilot seat to avoid it because he's too jittery. One reason being currently in the back of the plane, and Tony figures he'll feel better if he faces that first, head on.
to enjoy a beautiful summer day, which would be easier if his rowdy teammates could keep quiet for once. But no; Sam, Rhodes and Thor are having a cannonball competition on the other side of the pool. The goal, as far as Steve can understand, is to get water on him. Not that he asked about it, or even moved from where he’s laying face-down on his chair, willing his back to pick up at least a bit of a tan. Steve pretends to ignore Sam and Jim, so they leave him alone. There's another big splash, which sends droplets on Steve's feet and has the peanut gallery cheering. Wanda is laughing and Steve smiles, hidden in the crook of his elbow where he's resting his head. He'll take getting wet if it makes them this happy.
"Come on, Love Bug, you trust J!" Tony pouts, then tilts his head to the side. "Or maybe you need identification stories too? Like that time we went to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and you decided you could speak perfect Cajun French—"
He's even happier when the game picks up once more, albeit almost silently, and there's only Orange Lady's turn left. She ignores Tony's tiles, which is great. Heck, no one but Tony and Kol seem interested in gambling anymore. Jarons closes the game when the last turn is over, picking up all the tiles that are faceup.
He's surprised that several teams are jetting down from the warship almost immediately. At least three of them, and a count of seventeen space pods in total. Not the most subtle approach.
"I'm so very sorry about that. But I told you, I'm fine. And I wasn't bullshitting earlier, I don't blame Bucky for my parents." Tony takes a deep breath. "So, if we can clear all of that mess up, about Vienna and how he's not responsible for his actions as the Winter Soldier, in Berlin and otherwise, then I don't see why he couldn't come and live with you in the tower."
"Right. So Thanos, Nebula’s dad, was the guy leading the alien army we fought in New York. Loki was working for him. Thanos collected six gems called Infinity Stones that made him all powerful. He used them to cull half of all living beings throughout the universe. Humans, aliens, plants, animals, you name it."
Okay, now is not the time to think about that. Steve's here as a concerned friend, with no ulterior motive. And the first part of Steve's plan is working like a charm; Tony all but inhales his first burger and helping of fries, and is still going strong with the second sandwich.
He's never doubted it. It was written in the way Steve moves, all grace and power, that he'd fuck like a champion. And with how they've consistently gotten under each other's skin? Yeah, it was a given.
"I never told you enough how much I appreciate you," Steve says, being even more disarmingly genuine. Tony both eats it up and wants it to stop; he's growing deeply uncomfortable now, unsure what to do with a Steve who’s so open like this. "I'm trying to do it more, but you won't let me, most times."
"It's fine," Not-Chewie says after shaking his gigantic head. He has a big, booming voice instead of a shrill Wookiee chant. Disappointing, if Tony is honest, but it may be because of the universal translator they had implanted. "You're not here to cause trouble, are you, Captain?"
But Steve doesn't, at least for now. He simply turns towards the television after eating another handful and they watch the movie together in easy companionship.
"You think?" Steve's amused as he sits to take off his boots. "This bed is bigger than my entire bedroom was when I was growing up."
He looks as if he means it. But as much as Steve hated the distance of the last few months, he knows that it's best that Tony took some time for himself. Now that he's closed the door on Pepper, has processed the tragedy with his parents – though eventually they'll find Bucky, and that won't be easy – and he got some rest away from Iron Man. Better to jump back in, hopefully, but Steve can wait until Tony's ready.
"Really," Steve confirms. When the silence stretches (Tony's jaw isn't hanging open, but it's close), panic creeps in and Steve begins to backtrack. "It's fine if you're not interested--"
"Perfect," Doctor Martin says. "This is a 3 cc syringe, and a meal for a small one like this is 2 or 3 millimeters. If she turns her head away, she's had enough."
Tony has one of the smoothest transformations from Half State to Full Shift that Steve has ever seen, and he's an 18 year old freshman. He's a rarely recorded cheetah, and perhaps to defy expectations - or to annoy Dean Fury, also very possible - he forwent track to join the baseball team. He fits right into their infield at shortstop, with panther-T'Challa on third and lioness-Carol on second. Wolf-Bucky on first is the odd one out, but he can keep up.
His cosmic energy absorption and manipulation abilities make him ten times more powerful than any other Kree fighters, and they still won't let Anthony go on a meaningful mission with Starforce. He's supposedly not ready, or at least that’s what Yon-Rogg keeps saying, which gets on Anthony's last nerve.
The more the evening advanced, the more he's been encroaching on Tony's personal space. A slightly inebriated Steve is a touchy-feely one, it seems. Not that it's been unpleasant, far from it.
"Look at this sweetheart," Tony croons. He's convinced he should know her, and it's frustrating when there's nothing in his mind to back it up.
Steve links their fingers together and then brings their hands up next to Tony's ear. Steve's bottomed out, and Tony wonders if his gut will ever be the same. He feels stuffed to the gills; it's borderline overwhelming.
"Yes, there's a rush," Tony interrupts. "You don't want me to die, do you, Steve? Because that's what will happen."
"I wanted—" Tony starts, then squeezes his bicep. "Thank you. For saving them, but also for helping out. I couldn't have done it without you."
Tony steps back and lets the cosmic energy flow through him in order to go binary, the flames erupting on his body. He's keeping an eye on Yon-Rogg, and he's not surprised to see him touch the control panel on his wrist. When it does nothing and Yon-Rogg's brow furrows in confusion, Tony grins at him.
"It's fine." She's obviously learning about the rules at the same time as him and Steve. "I'm okay. As long as you don't leave," he whispers.
"Exactly!" Tony agrees. "Plus, the notes were in another language. It was fascinating! Fury had partial blueprints too, and the tech was
The croupier—he introduces himself as Jarons—takes the time to align a series of tiles in the correct ascending order. He names them for Tony, who reassigns the symbols a value from one to twelve in his head. He'd memorized the order already, but he thanks the man who then dumps all the tiles in a drawer on the side of the distributing machine. After a minute of noisy mechanical shuffling, they’re on and Jarons distributes the first tiles.
Until now they've called them ‘the babies’ and other endearments like ‘darling’ and ‘sweetheart’, but there’s been no semblance of names apart from ‘the white one’ and ‘the black one’.
"No, she mostly flies just by herself," Steve says, moving his hand, palm down, from right to left. "Zipping through the universe."
"He's great and a good kid. Extremely strong—probably the strongest of us all. Science whiz. He has web shooters he made himself and uses them to trap people or grab things, and he swings like Tarzan between buildings in New York."
At two balls and no strike, it's no surprise when Natasha brings the heat and throws her fastball. Ward is ready for it too, and the crack of the ball against the bat (that splinters) is sharp, the hit solid. It's a foul ball though, and Steve doesn't even budge from his spot in left field, following its arc as it falls in section 121 on his right.
"Oh fuck! A fast learner, aren't you? Made for this. So good." Tony has buried his fingers in Steve's hair again and begins pulling it harder and harder as he nears his orgasm. Steve moans his agreement, speeding his hand on Tony's dick.
"It's okay," Tony says. "Steve just explained what happened. What did he call it… the Decimation? And then bringing half the universe back. Frankly, I'm still wrapping my head around that."
Unsurprisingly, it's an appreciated sentiment, and cheers and applause break out again. They sit down and the food is brought in, plentiful in variety and sheer quantity. Curious, Tony doesn't take more than a few bites from each dish but samples everything. There is very little that he doesn't like, but he's never been picky. Traveling all over the world from a young age helped with that, he supposes. Tony avoids drinking too much, sticking to wine when the mead proves to be potent. By his side, Steve is less careful, and as he drinks his posture relaxes, his smile widens, and he talks and laughs louder. He's almost inhaling the food placed before him, which everyone around them rejoices in, Thor in particular. Tony will have to ask for a sample—or a barrel—of the mead. He'd love to analyze it with Bruce: a tipsy Steve is fun, but maybe there's something in there that could lead to a relaxant or a painkiller that beats the serum, too.
Gosh, this cannot be happening. Tony hopes that Steve doesn't push him off the ledge. So he keeps crying out, hoping that the situation is unusual enough for Steve to think outside the box. Steve's a wizard, for God's sake, Tony was sure that he'd clue up that the bat at his window is not a regular animal.
Not only does Steve see half-circles caused by his fancy keyboard imprinted on his cheek, Tony's hair is flat on one side and spiked-up on the other. He's so adorable that Steve's smile stretches.
"Well, I'm not surprised it does," Tony declares. He climbs back onto his hospital bed, leaning on the pillows. The enormity of the situation, everything he's missing, is solidifying. "Eleven years," he says out loud, to test how it sounds again. If there's someone who can relate, it's Steve. "It's nothing compared to your seventy, but…"
"Yeah. We went to you because we knew if someone could figure out time travel, it was Tony Stark." Steve offers him a small smile. "And you did, of course."
"Thank you so much," Tony says as they gather everything they need to leave with the kittens. Steve's not surprised that he immediately goes for the box.
The plan was for JARVIS to run all of his armors, but maybe that's not how it turned out. Tony's gut warns him not to ask too many questions, especially with the worry on Steve's face at the moment. Something happened to JARVIS, most likely. It's best that he doesn't learn about it right this second to avoid another anxiety attack. Tony will pretend, for now, that JARVIS just isn’t in this suit but is safely back on Earth.
"I've missed you too. So much," Tony says, kissing his cheek. "Everyone seems okay with the cats, right?" Tony asks, looking towards the patio door.
"What do you want? It's late." He knows his words are harsh, and Steve's disappointment must show because Tony's smile stiffens and his eyes turn guarded.
To be fair, now that Tony can observe it, there are very few buttons, and none that scream "stop whatever is going on" at first glance.
Seeing Carol use her powers is a work of art, as always. He thought as much even when she was supposedly the enemy. She's insanely powerful, that's a given, but she destroys with an enthusiasm and efficiency that is inspiring. Tony joins her as they first hobble the ships, then make sure they can't bomb their friends (or Earth, really). Of course they get fired at, but apart from a missile that explodes almost in Tony's face, which destabilizes him for a second, it's basically a walk in the park.
"One day, I'll stop being surprised at how much of an asshole your father was," Steve says, crossing his arms on his chest.
Steve finally lets Tony's hand go, but it's to move into a full, and very tight, body hug that is just perfect. Tony holds him back just as strongly, making shushing noises and hoping it's a comfort. If he plays with Steve's hair some more, it's as much for him as it is for Steve.
Steve watches with fondness as the robot approaches with utmost care, his head blocking the kittens from view. He makes an interrogative noise.
"Rest now, my sweet wizard," Tony says as he reluctantly breaks the kiss and gets off Steve and the bed. It's one of the hardest things he's done; Tony would happily give everything he owns to lie beside him instead. But he has to make sure to squish the menace of Victor's attempted coup, ultimately for Steve's safety.
The melted wall is still too hot to be a safe exit—to Zemo, at least. They walk to the room's actual door, then double down to the main chamber where Steve and Bucky are waiting.
They rekindled their friendship with an ease that makes Steve grateful every day. In fact, they're closer now than they've ever been. Steve spent a lot of time with Tony at the hospital, in the month he was treated by Helen Cho for his severe burns. They'd play chess, of all things, and eventually started talking about anything and everything for hours.
There's not time to be disappointed because Tony, who is looking straight at Steve and knows he overheard, winks cheekily and grins. It nearly takes Steve's breath away, how beautiful Tony is like this, happy and smiling. It's been so long that he hasn't had the chance to see it in person, too. The scars on the right side of Tony's face are hardly detectable now, and he looks rested and healthy. The only glaring sign that he didn't escape unscathed from the battle with Thanos is his red and gold right hand.
"I've been trying to find the nerves to ask you out for months," Steve says with a half-smile. "Intimate works for me."
"Let me add my congratulations, but I also need to be that person and break up the party," Everett Ross says. The guy might be CIA, but he has an earnest and no-nonsense veneer that Tony likes. "I've—"
"Oh boy." Rhodey shakes his head, but he's repressing a smile. "You two can play in the lab later. For now, we have to plan on how to convince Cap and friends."
"I think so." Tony's heart rate is coming down, so there's that. He's still slightly out of breath, but the stabbing feeling in his gut is definitely gone.
The palace, as everything else in Asgard they’ve seen, is impressive and regal, the opulence present everywhere. Thor leads them to a set of double doors he pushes open, gesturing for them to enter.
Steve flashes him a smirk, then licks around the head of Tony's cock like a lollipop. It's a bolt of instant pleasure, almost too much, and Tony groans, throwing his head back. Fuck, he doesn't want to come right as they start. He takes in a shaky breath, then looks down again because he can't miss the perfect picture of Steve's pretty mouth circling his dick. And what an image it is. Who knew Steve Rogers sucked cock so well?
"If we turn it solid instead of energy-based, yes. But you'll have less nanites for the armor, so less protection.”
When he’s in his shop, it's the same. Tony has, on average, five to ten projects in various stages of completion and evolving at the same time. Plus the regular odds and ends for his private projects: armor improvement, bot maintenance, and like it or not, personal preoccupations dealing with people or emotions. They all use a portion of his brain and progress at their own rhythm, unless he focuses on something in particular. But what isn’t at the forefront of his attention advances too. If he gets stuck on a battery issue for the new Stark Phone, he'll move on to something else. And then, in the middle of writing code for a new sensor for his gauntlet, suddenly the solution for the phone battery will come to him, almost fully formed.
"Steve?" he asks, bewildered. He also cuts the music with a gesture at the ceiling, a notable relief.
"You know what we should do?" Natasha says, who seems to be still documenting everything that has to do with the kittens on her phone. "Make an Avengers and Cats Instagram."
Right behind her is another… woman? Or android, maybe, since she clearly has mechanical parts. She's dressed in burgundy leather, but the most remarkable thing is that her skin is at least two shades of deep blue. She has no hair, and her intense black eyes are now fixated on Tony.
"We're still ironing out the kinks, but right now it's request driven," Bucky says. "People stuck in dangerous lives, who are looking to start over, reach out through a—what's it called?"
Curious, Tony glances behind himself and it's his turn to gape. A man who looks just like Steve, though with longer hair and a sheriff's star, is approaching with long strides. Not that he's paying them any mind.
The wolf has lost consciousness now, massive head lolling to the side. What Tony said is true, the last two Hydra soldiers fled… but maybe they went to get reinforcements, which would be unfortunate. First thing first, Tony retrieves his gun. There's a fraction of a second where the idea to put the wolf down as it sleeps passes through his mind—it would be the safest option—but the thought vanishes as soon as it appears. Before the puppy routine, Tony would have done it without hesitation, but there's something about the animal that is too precious to waste. It's highly intelligent for one, and very sweet once it has vanquished its enemies.
"A good question," Tony agrees. "Maybe he's afraid of cats. I think the super soldier threat is credible, and Cap is right, it needs to be acted on immediately. I'll take the Quinjet and go with Rogers and Barnes to sort it out. I'll bring them back, I promise. The rest of you stay here and start clearing things up, JARVIS can help. Rhodey, you stall Ross so that everyone stays out of prison and with heads unseasoned with lead until we're back."
The honest truth is that Tony has a huge crush on Steve too. It bloomed the moment he saw Steve's smile when he came to after falling from the wormhole in New York. The man is absolutely gorgeous; anyone with eyes can attest to that. But he's also admirable in so many ways. Tony is convinced that everyone who gets to know Steve falls in love with him, at least a little.
"Tony! We need help!" she cries out from the bathroom. She doesn't sound worried or hurt, and Tony closes his eyes, asking for patience.
"Hey there, sweetheart," Sam says, slowly approaching nearer, then reaching a wet hand towards her. As soon as she gets a droplet on her nose, by accident, Callie recoils.
Steve laughs at his misery, too. This is one of the most humiliating moments of Tony's very, very long life. At least he'll go after having made this beautiful man happy, even for a moment.
Curious, Steve leans in, and sees a picture of Tony with a big grin, holding the two kittens under his chin. Sam meant the cats were cute – and they are, the two of them with their blue eyes opened now – but Tony is gorgeous.
And by that, he means everything from the last two years, including their fight. He doesn't know how to start talking about it now that it's been so long and life has moved on.
They try to kiss, but they're both smiling widely and Tony giggles. He has never felt this effervescent, this in love with anybody else. It makes him bold.
"Physical resemblance aside, the energy signature is wrong. Please provide more information, but know that your presence triggered an alert, and that automated defenses will engage in 30 seconds."
text. Saying, and I quote, 'fought with Steve, need space, I'll be back when I'll be back'. And since you were then on another planet, that's all I got. You call that telling me about it?"
"I figure it's too late to pretend that I wasn't here at all, right?" the man in the red and black uniform who popped up earlier asks.
"Thank you," Tony says. "I appreciate it. Also, tell me about any supplies I'll need, formula and all. I'll take it."
"I know you are. Just six days ago, I was still brainwashed and being groomed to be a weapon against Carol who you saw back there."
"Yes, I'd like that." Steve has to consciously stop bobbing his head. Even so, he made a vow, and he needs to act before he loses his courage. "Another time, though, if you want, I'd love to take you out."
Tony rolls his eyes. "No. I drink coffee, too." He grins when Steve opens his mouth to protest. "It's a joke. I'm fine, and besides, my smoothes, power bars and blueberries, as you say, would be absolutely fine. I ran the numbers."
What is for sure is that if Tony opens the door, he has to be certain. Steve deserves an honest and genuine shot, and not just a roll in the hay.
The exchange is easy; they must have known each other for years. It also tells Tony that Carol is not alien.
But Carol, though. Carol taking care of the Kree ship once she has it where she wants it is a thing of beauty. She’s lit up in an aura of flames, bright in the night sky, so powerful she's cutting into the little vessel like a hot knife through butter.
"Probably not. I haven't been there in 21 years, and just a bit at that." She pauses, scrutinizing his face. "But then again, maybe. The Krees really did a number on my head. You do look familiar."
As Tony speaks, he follows Carol in the sky. She’s flying around the Kree fighter plane, not concerned at all that she’s being shot at as she weaves in between the blasts. She's slowly luring them away from the casino, probably to a place with fewer civilians.
"No." Tony raises a palm up to stop Steve's words, which makes him close his mouth with a click. He can't believe that these supposed friends of his talked about a talking raccoon before they mentioned he was a father. He doesn't want to learn what else he missed in the last eleven years.
be this sorry. Oh, he's still angry. So angry. But seeing Steve this miserable also breaks his heart. He’s in over his head. Stupid of him to think this was just a little crush.
At this moment in time, Tony feels as if all that he can offer is a one-night stand, and he can’t offer that to Steve. So he will take Cherie to a chic hotel, or maybe to her place, and have fun with no promises or expectations on either side. No messing his own bed or the bed of someone he cares about.
With a contented warmth suffusing his chest, Tony lets his eyes slip shut. He just needs to rest for a few minutes.
"I don't know," Tony says slowly, because neither of them said that exactly. Do you break up when you're fuckbuddies, anyway? Or does the arrangement just stop? "He waited four months to tell me his buddy Bucky had assassinated my parents while under Hydra's influence."
Rhodey smiles back and Steve has to admit that he might miss Tony a lot, but he's definitely not the only one.
"I'm fine, honest," Tony pats Steve's arm in reassurance. He's so hot to the touch, even through his shirt. "I was a fool and walked into a trap."
A heavy silence falls in the cockpit. Tony's not surprised by Natasha's sacrifice, not one bit. She always acted as if she had to repent for her past, even if she tried to appear unflappable. Tony can't imagine how much Clint must be hurting. Fuck. He must be racked with guilt, despite the fact that what she did allowed the Avengers to undo the Decimation. The more he learns about the battles with Thanos, the more Tony realizes how huge and complicated it was. He also hates how Steve visibly blames himself too, as he does every time a mission goes wrong.
