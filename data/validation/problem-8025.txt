“Oh, Peter,” Wade fluttered his eyelashes. “You’re such a romantic.” He grinned before pushing down the handle and swinging the door open.
Bruce and Clint jumped out of their skin as Thor loudly broadcasted, typing away on his keyboard with his fingers dancing so quickly across it they were like a blur.
“Stupid dinosaur.” Loki mumbled, kicking the nearest thing, which happened to be a bin.
Just as he yelled there came a loud roar for about the millionth time, followed by Wade screaming like a girl, Peter kicking the back of his uncle’s chair manically and Steve trying to decide if one measly bullet would do anything to the gigantic dinosaur on their tail. Tony didn’t let his foot off the gas pedal, the jeep jumped and skidded across the dirt, feeling more like a roller coaster than a car ride.
The couple stopped by the security line and turned to Aunt May, who started tearing up a little as she looked up at her nephew. Peter sighed, groaning at her sudden emotional breakout.
“Well, I need the walks, honey bear.” Wade said, planting a sloppy kiss on Peter’s cheek. “Hey,” he began, nudging Peter on the arm. “Why didn’t your rich as fuck uncle come pick us up?”
Steve stared at the long scratch marks that decorated the wall. They were dug deep into the barricade, starting from the bottom and making their way right to the very top. There was only one thing that could have done it.
“Steve?” he whispered, earning the other man’s attention. “You alright?”
“Hey,” Wade grinned cheekily. “Aunty May May’s snoring is way louder than mine.”
“Yeah.” Steve admitted, meeting the engineer’s gaze. “I’ve missed being with you.”
Then, out of nowhere, they all heard a noise. A distinct, deep growling.
“Good,” Carol huffed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Everyone’s on top of everything here, Bruce is sorting stuff out down in the main hall, but I’ve got a bit of bad news.”
Tony, being cautious, took unhurried steps in Steve’s direction, sitting himself down beside him just as slow. Steve didn’t even flinch, eyes stuck on what was happening on the screen.
“What?” Tony asked in confusion as he was pulled along. “Where are you going, Steve? We have to find them!”
“We are.” Steve answered calmly. “Look on the ground, Tony.”
Steve shook his head, eyes staring at the ground, feeling like his words were going in one ear and coming out the other. They we’re preparing to walk to their deaths.
The scientist looked up, guilt etched across his face. “Was there any other reptile genes in her?” Steve asked, already dreading the answer.
Tony chuckled, helping Steve all the way up the steps. “Steve, honey, have you seen her in the mornings?”
Tony saw the look of shock and alarm on Clint’s face before he whirled around as another pained cry came from Steve, and his heart skipped in dread as he eyed the scene before him. Steve was on the ground on his back, rifle thrown metres away, as a pterodactyl stood above him and pecked at him like he were the animal’s dinner. Steve had his arms up, trying to protect himself from the onslaught, thrashing and kicking out in an attempt to get the creature to move away.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, dear?”
“They’ll get out.” Peter finished, eyes wide in fear.
Steve shouted sternly. He was stood on a metal bridge above an enclosure, holding out a dead rat in his hand as he looked down at his four Raptors who stood waiting, eyes wide and teeth showing.
!” she said.
Voices nattered through the coms from the control room.
He had no idea how far behind the dinosaur was, but he didn’t take any chances and as he got to the tree Wade practically threw him inside. Peter landed painfully on his side inside the gigantic tree trunk, Wade falling not so gracefully beside him seconds later.
“Matt, what is it?” Natasha spoke in a hushed tone from a few metres away. “Matt?”
“It’s because I make excellent pancakes.”
“Tony,” Steve cut in, bringing Tony in closer by the neck, and smiling. “It’s okay,” he said softly, wiping away the single tear that had fallen down the engineer’s cheek. “I love you too, you idiot.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair and chewed on his bottom lip, deciding that the best way to do it was to just let it all slip out. “The dinosaur’s escaped, the one you and Hank created, it killed Jessica and Luke and Shield went after it, the whole team was killed, including Natasha and Matt. We’re currently trying to track it down and come up with a solution to get everyone off the island safely.” He heaved a sigh.
“Old building?”
“We’re going to die, we’re going to die, holy fuck my gravestone is going to say eaten by a dinosaur!” Wade shrieked.
“No.” Steve said certainly. “Look at their wounds, Tony. They haven’t had parts of them torn out like the other one, they’re just… just bite marks and claw marks.”
“Jesus fucking Christ!” Wade squeaked as the four of them stopped dead at the bottom of the street.
“MATT!” Natasha yelled, grip tightening on her gun, her anger boiling inside her. “Son of a bitch!” she shrieked.
Everyone in the room followed his gaze and there were gasps, eyes widening in terror, as the Foniassaurus moved around on the spot. But that’s not what caught their attention, as right next to the Foniassaurus were two other dots in the shape of people, evidently struggling for their lives.
Peter grinned. “Good to see you too! This is Wade by the way.” He said, pointing to his boyfriend who was currently trying to hide from Tony’s glare. “Wade, this is Steve.”
Tony hung up the phone.
Steve felt his blood boil, having no choice but to look at the stern faced man. “Don’t start this again, Schmidt. I’ve told you once before, they’re not safe to take out of their confinements, they never will be used as weapons in war.”
“Please don’t.” Peter sighed and tipped his head back, looking up at the cloudy sky. “What’s Loki doing? Is he still standing by the water fountain?”
“Go!” Luke yelled at her, her steps quickening.
“Shouldn’t you be minding your own business?” Schmidt retaliated, giving Clint a once over before taking a few steps back. “Well then Steven, I guess we’ll have to cut this short. I will see you soon.”
A smile tugged at the edge of the blonde’s lips. “Yeah, nothing’s changed, has it?”
“How about jackass?” Clint suggested.
Wade’s jaw dropped. “No?” he gasped, placing a hand on his heart. “What a selfish prick. Did you take the Ipad?”
“Steve.” Tony practically whispered. “I am sorry.”
to do
Loki sighed. “What are you talking about?”
“Uncle Tony!”
“What do you mean Loki’s not even there?” Tony yelled, feeling his blood boil.
“My god.” Tony hurriedly took out his phone and dialled Thor’s number. “We need to get everyone off this damned island.”
“As soon as every guest and employee is together, we need to make an announcement over the speakers.” Tony began, starting to pace. “We do not tell them there’s an escaped dinosaur or like Steve said there’ll be mass panic, we have to stick to the electrical fault story.”
“Jesus, fuck!”
So, onto the story, and cross your fingers for Loki...
Tony sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Steve, let me take you, I don’t want this to be awkward between us.”
“Oh, come on, don’t be like that.” Tony said as he put his phone back in his pocket. “We’ll have fun later, right? Say six o’clock?” he tapped a finger to his lips. “No wait, I’ve got another Skype thing, say eight? When’s your bed time?”
Peter grinned, moseying over to help him dig out his shoe. “At least there’s no dinosaur on our trail.”
Tony looked at her, then at Thor, then to Steve, and nodded. “We start by putting up defences around the park and finding the Fon… whatever it’s called, everyone get a different camera angle up on your screens and find that damn dinosaur. Thor, you do the search through infrared. We can’t waste any more time.”
,” Her voice suddenly changed, happy to finally hear from her nephew.
“What the hell are
Peter glared at him, wishing he hadn’t pointed out the glass building between the trees. “I hate you.” Peter mumbled as the crowd began disembarking.
“It’s got to be them.” Steve said, and before Tony could say another word, the dinosaur expert was already taking off at a sprint through the woods.
Steve called.
Matt just laughed quietly to himself as he gave Steve a pat on the back, disappearing through the double doors. Natasha stopped in front of the blonde, putting a hand on his shoulder and giving him a slight shake.
“What’s the plan?” Carol pipped in, crossing her arms over her chest and looking like she was ready for a fight.
Peter sat up in shock and grimaced. “Ew, Wade!”
“Tony!”
Peter smiled to himself, stepping over the thick vines sprawled across the marble floor, making his way over to one of the doors on the right. It was different to the other doors, made from metal and a bit smaller, with a square sign stuck in the middle. Peter couldn’t read it from the thick layer of dirt plastered across it, so with his sleeve he began to wipe the filth away, revealing blocked letters.
Steve nodded in agreement. “We can say there’s a chance the power could shut down.”
Tony stood there mouth agape, wishing he had a good comeback but nothing seemed to be coming to mind. Meanwhile Wade was desperately trying not to laugh in Tony’s face.
“No!” Tony shouted back, opening his car door.
“Okay.” Tony sighed, hands on hips. “Right, good.” He said, striking up an idea as quickly as humanly possible. “I’ve got a plan, and it’s going to involve a lot of help from the employees and a lot of patience from the visitors. Let’s hope there’s no angry customers out there.”
Jessica and Luke looked at each other as if they both thought Steve had lost it. Luke laughed out loud, shaking his head. “Don’t be ridiculous, the evidence is right there.” He said, as Steve pulled out his phone.
“TONY!” Peter just about screamed down the receiver. “HELP! WE NEED HELP! WE DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO! TONY WHAT DO WE DO? THERE’S A FUCKING DINOSAUR-,”
But Tony just laughed, as Clint ran past him and jokingly punched his arm, before finding a new position on top of a wall of all places. Tony and Steve shared a smile, knowing Clint was right at home.
Luckily for Loki, his brother was there to catch him as he fell. Thor caught him in his arms like he weighed nothing, just after he threw his riffle to the ground, the one that had shot the creature that had almost killed his brother. Thor dropped to his knees, gently placing Loki down, but his little brother wouldn’t let go, arms tight around his neck as he wept into his shoulder.
“Please don’t.” Bruce slipped his glasses back up his nose. “You should be focusing on these sponsors that we’re about to meet.”
“Thank fuck!” Peter yelped, eyes wide in terror as he watched the dinosaur lose stamina behind them.
Steve nodded slowly. “I know.” He breathed out. “I understand, she can be stubborn as hell.”
“Back inside, ladies and gents.” Tony told them. “Get some rest whilst we decide what to do next.”
“I’m eighteen, asshole!” Peter punched him on the shoulder.
Tony was about to reply, but was swiftly cut off by Steve suddenly bolting upright in his seat, yanking his hand away from Tony’s to grip at the dashboard.
Steve put a hand to his heart, feeling his chest start to hurt. “I know that now.” Steve chuckled, turning his head to Bobby who was leaning against the cage looking like he’d seen a ghost. “You okay, Bobby?”
?” Came Thor’s confused tone.
“Well done, Steve!” one of the workers called Charles yelled his way.
Logan laughed deeply. “Good idea, Rogers. We’ll work on that.”
“Hopefully not.” Steve deadpanned.
Hearing all this Bruce put his head in his hands. “I can’t believe this is happening.” He mumbled into his lap. “God, this is all my fault.”
In a flash every person in the room went straight to it, and the noise grew. As the workers got themselves prepared for Shield’s mission, Tony, feeling like he was about to get a dirty look, turned and was startled to see Steve sitting on the floor, staring up at the large screen at the front of the room. His eyes darted across it, watching as the Shield militias got their weapons ready at the back of their van as it sped through the wilderness.
New York and never come back. “So, you need the cage to be checked encase she tries to escape again?”
“Have they always been there?” Steve practically whispered.
Steve didn’t even hesitate. “I know she will, Tony.” He said. “I have a funny feeling the glass holding those Pterodactyls inside won’t hold her, and if she smashes that thing open…”
“Shouldn’t you be getting back home, you’ve been working since five this morning.”
“Good.” Tony sighed, eyes never leaving the shape on screen. “I think it’s about time we evacuated.”
” Thor answered, mumbling to another as Tony waited anxiously.
Aunt May rolled her eyes, leaning in for a quick hug with Wade. “You’d better look after him, or I’ll slice your balls off.”
“PIG ON THE LOOSE! GET IT BACK NOW!”
Steve’s insides hurt, they hurt so bad he’d felt like he’d been booted in the gut. His head began to spin from the whole situation, and all he could think about was his two dead friends behind those grey walls. He didn’t have much time to think before he heard the Foniassaurus give out another ear-piercing growl, and that’s when the ground began to shake from its heavy footsteps.
Wade gasped. “What if we get eaten?”
“We’ll have to come up with a better plane than last time,” Clint added, thinking of what happened to his friends hours ago. “Get the team together.” Tony and Steve nodded in agreement.
Peter really did roll his eyes this time. “When it bites down on the tree again, we make a run for it, okay?”
Steve and I tell you, okay?”
.” May said, sounding sincere. “
“Loki!” Thor breathed in relief, holding him close. “It’s alright little brother, you’re safe now. You’re safe.”
Tony was nervous. Extremely nervous. Heck he hadn’t felt butterflies in his stomach like this since, well, a long time. He felt so tense that he had the radio on full blast in the car, and sped down the dirt track a little bit faster than was legal, which made him feel just a tad better but not by much.
“Hi.” Bruce said to the pair as he approached them, the two sending him a small wave in return. “Sorry uh… sorry about the um…”
And Steve. Tony sucked in a breath, he didn’t want to turn around and have to face him. Too afraid that Steve would hate him even more, hate him for letting this happen, for not listening to him and stopping the Shield team from leaving the building. It was all his fault, all of this, he should have never agreed to have this dinosaur created.
“Not the time, Wade!”
Steve caught him by the arm before he could get in, holding him in place. “Tony, think about this first, please!” Steve practically begged. “You can’t just go out there and look for them, you need weapons, a plan, she’s dangerous!”
“Clint!”
is after him, I… God, I don’t even know if Peter’s still alive!”
Loki sighed and crossed his arms over his chest, glaring a hole into anyone who made eye contact. He especially wished he could make one child disappear, who was staring at him from across the way, as if he had snakes coming out of his head.
“Bruce did.” Tony shrugged, suddenly interested in the dinosaur at the other’s words, putting aside their awkwardness for a moment. “How is it so stupid?”
Opening its mouth wide, the Foniassaurus let out an ear-splitting cry, before picking up its feet and beginning the chase.
“Let’s try the doors.” Peter said as they went in. “Maybe we’ll find a map or something, find out where we are.”
Peter thought about it. Wade was right, he didn’t exactly care if Tony shouted at him for abandoning their so called babysitter. It wasn’t like Loki was paying any attention to anything they were doing anyway.
“Oh, will we?” Jessica raised her brows in question, hands on hips. “It’s not exactly easy to fix, Stark.”
doing here?”
They’d been strolling through the woodland now for what felt like hours, and they had no idea where they were going. It just felt like they were going in one straight line which led to nowhere, and there wasn’t any sign of civilization, not even any dinosaurs were roaming around the area. Which, really, Wade was more than happy about. But being absolutely stinking from their roll around in the mud earlier, and freezing cold after their dip in the pond, they felt miserable and tired, wanting to get back to their comfy beds in the hotel as soon as possible.
“Kill the dinosaur, right?” Matt asked as he typed into his phone, looking up as he stuffed it into his back pocket. “We’re on it.”
“Peter’s smart, he would lead them back up West,” Steve went on, trying to think back to when he was showed a map of the old park. “I think there’s a couple of buildings still standing around there, on the way to the new park. It’s a long walk but they could have found a place along the way, or we might be able to catch them on their way back.”
“Me neither.” Peter sighed. “Typical, he’s either late or decided to abandon us.”
However, before Steve could even open his mouth the giant opened its enormous jaws, and gave out an ear-splitting roar. The sound was so powerful it sent the three stumbling backwards, and not one of them wasted any time in making a move.
“Shut it, we’re the adults, you’re the kid. We know the way. Move it!”
“Oh,” Wade chortled. “They don’t eat extremely good looking humans do they?”
“You’re braver than most, Rogers.” Another worker named Logan patted him on the shoulder as three of them crowded around him, shaking his hand and their heads in disbelief. “Don’t think any of these men would have the balls to do what you do you crazy fucker!”
“Bruce.” Tony said, as he joined Steve on the floor. The scientist scrubbed at his eyes before looking down at his friend, feeling like his whole world had just come crumbling down on top of him. “Listen, we haven’t got time to waste, we haven’t got time to mourn, okay? I know that sounds harsh but there’s thousands of people out there in danger, and they’re our main priority right now. It’s what our friends would want.”
“Hmm,” Wade held out two jackets, one red and one green. “I don’t know, Shnookums. Which one matches my eyes best?” he said, holding them both to his face.
Tony sighed deeply, gripping the steering wheel in his hands tightly. Just when he was feeling anxious and wanted to hide under a rock, his sister just had to go and blab on and on about Steve like talking about him would make Tony feel so much better. It had the opposite effect of course.
“Oh?” Tony asked confused.
They swam to the edge of the river, clutching at the mucky ridge and dragging themselves up weakly. Peter was the one to collapse into the mud first, not giving a damn that he practically face planted into the dirt, his chest hurting too much to care about anything at the moment.
They were so close, Steve could practically count their steps to freedom. But what happened next had Jessica halt abruptly, Steve having that sickly feeling in his stomach. The two turned as they heard Luke scream at the top of his voice, the first thing they see is the Foniassaurus’s teeth clamming around Luke’s body, lifting him into the air.
Peter couldn’t help but laugh, and nodded in agreement. He stopped abruptly when he noticed something in front of them, Wade too who pointed a finger in its direction. There stood a man in a green apron who seemed no older than thirty, with pitch black hair and a thin frame, looking like he’d been forced to stand there holding up the sign with Peter and Wade’s names on. Peter rolled his eyes, before yanking on Wade’s hand and leading him over to the stranger.
“Keep your eyes peeled, try not to make a sound.” Steve began, as they didn’t waste another second and started to follow the trail. “Keep your rifle up.”
She heard Tony shout at her over the coms.
Peter began to panic as the dinosaur let out another piercing roar, he could feel Wade’s hand on his back giving him a push, his own panic evident as he began cursing the high heavens with every breath he took. Peter was starting to lose hope the further they ran, nowhere for them to go except straight forward, and the Foniassaurus was nowhere near giving up on its hunt. The younger man was about to pull Wade to hide behind a tree and hope for the best until luck would have it, just metres in front of them was a dense, hollow tree tilted on its side. Without a second thought Peter took a hold of Wade’s hand and led him right to it.
“Peter?! Where are you?”
“Why?” Tony looked out to see if he could see what Steve was staring at as he slowed the vehicle, apparently it was something straight up ahead and out in the fields. “What’s wrong?”
Steve didn’t have to say anything, as he reached out a hand and pointed down at the muddy ground. Tony gazed at the spot where he was pointing, and he felt his blood run cold. Laying in the mud was a torn up, enormous tree trunk, bits and pieces of the wood strewn all around the path, and right alongside it was a phone. Tony bent down to retrieve it, and knew immediately that it belonged to his nephew.
Carol bobbled, before sprinting back to her station to get on it.
Bruce nodded, suddenly feeling a bit overwhelmed at the responsibility of it all. “I’ll get it sorted.” he mumbled, sending them a short farewell before practically sprinting for the door.
?” Thor said.
Tony sighed. “Me too.” he said, as Matt took out his phone. “I was going to ask you something.”
“It’s uh… creepy.” Tony said honestly, seeing a tree move.
“So,” Wade chirped in. “Pterodactyls. Which ones are they again?”
“They have to try,” Tony said just as quiet. “We can’t put all those people in danger.”
” Aunt May’s voice rose even higher if possible. “
.” Aunt May sounded outraged, like she was about to breathe fire and burn down some villages. “
Thor led him to safety as quickly as he could. They walked past Shield security workers and Clint, shooting at the creatures still flying around them, shouting at patrons to take cover, to find somewhere safe as they took out the threat. That’s where Steve, Tony, Peter and Wade ran to the scene, not believing the sight that was before them.
Peter was more interested in the view from the balcony when he opened the double doors. Right in front of them stood the entire park itself, they could literally see every inch of it. From the museum centre, to the laboratories at the back, and the main street where all the cafes, shops and restaurants mounted amongst the thousands of guests and staff. Peter watched in wonder, taking it all in, goose bumps adorning his skin as the sound of a dinosaur’s roar echoed across the island.
Peter looked at him liked he’d grown two heads.
Tony snorted, earning a glare from the bigger man.
Steve turned to Bruce who knew something wasn’t right just by his change of expressions. “The tree frog,” Steve began, Tony listening in closely. “It has the ability to hide its own thermal temperature, right?” Bruce nodded slowly, already knowing what was coming. “We couldn’t find the Foniassaurus on the infrared, but she was right there in front of our eyes.”
“Go.” She said one last time as she turned back to face the colossal monster. She wasn’t going anywhere.
“Damn, Steve, don’t say that, it’s not your fault.” Tony exhaled, realising he was starting to sound just like Steve. “We’re both as bad as each other, huh?”
He’d thought at first that maybe he was seeing things, or that it might have been from bark or an injured bird. But as his gaze flicked through the trees above him he didn’t see anything but the leaves swaying in the wind, no birds in sight. Matt started feeling anxious when another drop fell onto his chin, followed by another on his shoulder, like the blood was falling from someone, or something that was wounded.
“Whatever you say, baby boy.” Wade sing-songed as he began dodging people, and hiding behind whatever he could to get a good spot next to Loki without him realising.
“Clint?” Steve called calmly to his friend, who he knew was still standing close by. “When I get to three you shut that gate.”
“Jumped?” Tony sighed, running his free hand through his unruly hair. “Who in their right mind would jump down there?”
I'm so sorry for the extremely late update! Been a busy year and all that!
“Have you seen these cool goggle thingies?” Wade shrieked in excitement from the other side of the room, next to a stack of shelves covered in old devices Peter was pretty sure he shouldn’t be touching. He then noticed Wade was wearing one on his head. “Everything’s green!”
touch anything!”
It was seconds before he was dragged out of his sleepy state by Wade’s loud gasp. Peter sighed and opened his eyes once again expecting to see a couple of rabbits hoping along the grass, but as he followed Wade’s gaze his eyes landed on something that was a whole lot bigger than a bunny. Peter jumped up in his seat, leaning across the seat and practically sitting in Wade’s lap to get a glance at the dinosaur moving close to the fence.
Luckily for them, the dinosaur didn’t take long before it gave up, and its head disappeared from their view. Feeling their chests tighten, Peter and Wade urgently swam to the top, breaking the surface with gasping breaths.
As he said it, there came the sound of an engine again, which sounded like it was just around the corner. Steve and Tony shared a look of awareness, before the pair practically dashed around the building to where they had an incline of where the noise was coming from. As they rounded the corner to where the garage of the block stood, they could see that the metal door was fully open, but the jeep that should have been sitting inside was gone.
It’s slow and whisper-soft, and so tender, Tony feels chills running down his arms. He feels Steve’s hand cup his cheek, closes his eyes against the lurch his heart gives, and knows he’s never been happier than he is at this moment.
“You bet I will. So you’re at the campus station?”
When the Avengers alarm rings during lunch the next day, the team is up and running in minutes. But every single one of them spots the suitcases by the elevator, and the short flight out to Queens is a tense one.
“You can’t ignore everything that’s going on,” Steve explains, and steps closer to him. “The bright, the black– the good and the bad, it’ll always be there. But so will everything you did.”
Steve laughs. “You sure move fast, Mister...”
“Buck,” Steve sighs, and bless his heart, he isn’t even trying to hide his amusement. “What happened?”
Sad one here, folks. I had to. :(
“No thanks,” Tony says, and hears Ty step closer.
“Wussit taste wike?”
Now it’s Steve’s turn to shrug. “I’m itchin’ to get back to you. Shouldn’t be more than a week ‘till we’re cleared.”
“Hi,” Tony replies, and if he sounds a little breathless, he doesn’t think anyone could blame him because
Steve rolls his eyes, comfortably ensconced in their familiar banter. "This isn't a contest, Tony."
Stony Christmas prompt #24: "How'd you get in here?"
Steve finally pushes himself off the bike, and lets go of Tony’s wrist to wrap his arm around Tony’s shoulders. “I’ll take care of ya,” he says, mouth brushing Tony’s temple as they make their way to the school’s entrance. “Promise.”
Warnings: NONE.
“So you
It’s nothing either of them doesn’t already know, but Steve still feels disappointment wash over him like a wave, and when he turns back to face Tony, he knows he’s not the only one. “Thank you, ma’am,” he tells the doctor, sighing as she nods before leaving the room.
“All that whining and moping and pathetic beeping... it’s nightmare, Cap.”
But Barnes just shakes his head knowingly. “You two are a piece of work, I can’t believe you don’t see it– actually, scratch that, I
Pepper laughs again at the excited cheers she can clearly hear him getting in return. “I just need to clear some things over with Cary, but I’ll be right over after that. Give me fifteen, alright?”
“Distracting,” he finally says. “How am I– how is anyone supposed to pay attention to your speech when you look like
“That’s what you said last time.”
“Rhodey–”
Steve looks down. “And now I feel like...”
,” she sighs, walking carefully towards them. “Antonio, what’s-- what’s going on? They... Oh, they told me, and I just couldn’t believe it. The future?”
“I heard jet skis,” Barnes’ head pops up from inside, and both he and Sam are running off the patio seconds later.
“I’ll do it enough for the both of us, if I have to. You’re my best friend, you idiot.”
“Any fries?”
“In the flesh,” Tony grins.
Civil Union Fest Prompt #21: “I think we need to talk.”
“I think I’d know if I was getting any from this,” Tony points at the blond, who blushes and hides his head in Tony’s shoulder.
“You good,
“Sure. You’re tiny, anyway,” Steve smirks. His eyes are already closed, and he looks so comfortable in the empty space of their new living room that Tony forces his body to relax as he wriggles in to join him.
“Sweetheart--”
“Promise?”
Tony rolls his eyes, but he's at the door in seconds. A girl giggles behind him, but she’s not the one passing notes with Hottie McHottie, so, really.
“This is, without a doubt, the stupidest plan you’ve ever had.”
“What were you thinkin’, coming up with those names, huh? Silly boy!”
Civil Union Fest Prompt #6: “Fancy seeing you here.”
,” he groans.
“Aw, you do love me!”
Prompt: The first time Tony says I love you.
“Tony–”
“It means that you’re the best kind of best friends. That you’re close like family, even though you’re not related. You understand?” Steve asks, but going by the bright smile on his brother’s face, he didn’t need to.
“Well, is he going to hide in there all day, or are you going to introduce us?”
“Why not, Mister 'PhD number three'?”
Tony looks around. “Is this... do you even go here?”
“Ha! Not so smug now, are ya?” Tony teases, sliding effortlessly across the ice in lazy swirls and graceful figure eights, and Steve finds himself suddenly holding his breath as moves inch by inch. He’s aware that most of his team is now looking his way, so he looks up from his skates to give them a friendly smile.
“It’s two in the mornin’, Tony.”
“What...”
Mr. Rogers, all six feet two of blond, muscled perfection, is weaving through the crowd of easels where his students are all primly seated, engrossed in their paintings. He moves in time with the rhythm, smiling and offering comments of encouragement-- at least that's what Tony thinks, from the way each kid smiles after he passes. It’s such a contrast to the sort of organized chaos in his room that Tony can’t help but be impressed.
“Is he?” Sam grins. “Well you know you’re sittin’ on his lap right now, yeah?”
” Tony prods.
“Sit down,” he says, but Steve shakes his head.
, his mind reminds him giddily, and Tony barely manages to stop his face from breaking out into a pathetically sappy little grin. “It’s a tree, Rogers,” he finally says.
“‘S why I love ya, Cap,” Tony grins, and feels his heart skip a beat at the smile he gets in return.
Steve nods around the faint wave of dread that comes over him at the question-- his studio’s going to be a mess, and he’ll be lucky to find it salvageable after. Still, he can’t find himself regretting his decision. “I sure do.”
“I’m sorry–”
“How come
Pepper almost slams into them, grabbing Steve’s arm to steady herself as she crowds Tony’s space. “Oh my god,” she breathes, bright green eyes blurry with emotion. “She’s absolutely
thing to do that it makes Tony smile until his cheeks start hurting.
“Thank you for giving us this, Tony.”
This one’s sad, guys. Which is exactly why it's the shortest of my drabbles. :(((
“Oh,” Steve says, and Tony wants to kiss that look of awe right off his face. “Well, just you wait till the lights go on.”
“What’d you do, bud, inhale it?”
Steve looks unimpressed. “Really.”
“I am.”
Tony just nods.
“Speak for yourself,” Steve teases. “You’re not the one with the limpet on top of ya.”
“Believe me,” Tony winks, “I’ve got plenty saved up for that, too.”
“I hate this.”
So, references here for Starbucks drink sizes, cuz they’re stupid and don’t make sense but that’s the way it is, and I used ‘em here-- their small is ‘tall’, medium is ‘grande’, and large is ‘venti’.
Steve’s hand leaves warm caresses down his back, and his laughter is just as soft. “Alright, alright. Go back to sleep, beautiful--”
She has Steve’s eyes.
“Know what?” she asks, blue eyes earnest and
Tony shrugs. “Such is my curse. Gotta have something to balance out my good looks.”
“I’m always right,” Tony humphs, and rolls his hips into his husband’s.
Tony can barely hear himself talk over the rush of blood in his ears. “I h-had a-- I had a plan, and-- and a speech,” he stutters, and god, he can’t believe he’s actually saying this. “With some, uh, fireworks. And...other shit.”
“Fine,” Tony sighs, “ I’ll give you this one. But only because you’ve given me an excuse to never leave my lab again.”
“I swear to God, Cap, if you don’t tell me what’s going on--”
“You’re ridiculous,” he mutters, feeling his own cheeks grow warm. “You don’t have to-- honey, it’s fine.”
’– a personal favorite of mine, hope you all enjoyed it. A big thank you, by the way, to everyone out there tuning in to our Golden Oldies hour here on SHIELD-U’s 98.5. I, uh, know it might be a little strange listening to big band when it’s almost midnight, but obviously there’s more than one or two of you listening, otherwise the school would’ve shut me down in a jiffy,” Steve chuckles, and then looks up to see Natasha making a phone sign across the glass.
“Yeah?” Tony asks, voice small and brittle, and Steve wants to hurt every person who’s ever made him feel that way.
“You take good care of my boy,” she says, and it feels like an order but goddamn it, he’s more happy to follow it.
“Watch that beak, Barton,” he replies, eyebrow raised in warning. “Wouldn’t want your share of dinner ending up in the trash.”
“Hit us with your best shot, kid,” Tony says, and almost startles at the nickname as it falls from his lips. The woman obviously catches it too, because her eyes turn soft and fond, and distant. “Hey, come on, clock’s ticking.”
“Su’pwise!” Clint cheers from the bottom half of the bed.
“That was my Ma.”
Tony feels love rush through him like a wave, warm and heady and almost overwhelming. He wants to lean over the table and kiss Steve again until they’re breathless and hungry for something far more important than food. But those blue eyes across the table from him are gleaming with so much hope, that Tony finds it easy to put aside his thoughts and focus on the obscenely delicious smells all around him, and the gorgeous man responsible for them. “ Sure it is.”
She has Steve’s eyes, big and blue like the sky Tony loves so much. Like the man he loves more than he’s ever loved anything.
“Tater tot’s a p'tato!” Steve giggles.
He gets two identical noises of disgust in return. “Nothin’ wrong with blueberry.”
“That’s two days too long.”
“Steeb…” Barnes buries his head in the pillow next to Tony’s, and narrows his eyes. “Steeb?”
Red raises an eyebrow. “Grazie mille.”
“You shouldn’t be,” Tony shakes his head. “Past is in the past, big guy.”
“And I appreciate it, honest. Not that I particularly care how big our bed is, though, as long as you’re the only one in it with me.”
Barnes looks away from the Twister spinner in his hand. “What.”
“Oh, yeah, okay. Let’s, uh, go find you something?” Tony replies, lips brushing bright blond hair as he hoists baby Steve further up in his arms, and tries not to make them tense. "You like, um... cookies?”
“You can’t leave me on my wedding day,” Tony scoffs. “So just calm down and look pretty. I promise I’ll behave–”
,” Tony rasps, blinking before the sudden sting in his eyes can turn into tears, and breathes through the wave of love that fills his chest until he can barely breathe. “How could I not have a good time, huh? You’ll be there.”
“No surprise,” Bucky mutters beside Steve, viciously stabbing at a chicken nugget with his spork. “Fucking assholes.”
"If you say so,” Steve says, and Tony doesn’t have to look up to know that he’s grinning again. “And don’t snore, okay?”
(Except that one time, when his class is blessedly quiet for once— he should give them tests more often-- until Steve shows up at the window with two of his students’ painted portraits in hand: one of a long strip of cliffs bordering the sea— ‘Chopin’ labeled in a yellow sticky— and the other with what looked like a hundred different colored splatters, ‘AC/DC’ tacked on in a blue note. Tony has to leave the room so that his laughs don’t disrupt the kids.)
It’s only when everything’s quiet that Tony realizes he can hear the soft keys of Nocturne No. 2 from the other room, and he almost laughs because of course this would end with Chopin, after everything that’s happened.
“What the fuck does that even mean?”
“I said
“So do I, y’know,” Tony whispers, eyes glassy and bright. “And if I have to take the hit so that you don’t have to, I’ll do it every fucking time.”
Tony doesn’t cuddle into Steve’s chest. He doesn’t. “You could’ve blinded me, you lug.”
Tony looks down to hide his smile. “Just don’t go blabbing about it, okay?”
– rubs the back of his neck shyly. There’s a delicious blush on his cheeks, and Tony feels his heart skip a beat. “Um…”
“That outta teach ya,” Steve laughs, bright and playful. He’s all but straddling Tony where he lies, and god, now’s not the time to think about keeping the view to memory. “Y’know what, I might just eat the leftovers myself.”
“Fuck that,” Tony groans, and Steve’s face freezes for a second before it just
” he coos, voice suddenly gone soft with concern. “
“That doesn’t work,” Tony whines, and Steve barely resists the urge to lean over and kiss the pout off his face. “I’ve tried
“No no no, don’t leave me,” he whines.
“But I...” Tony bites his lip, and takes a deep breath to gather his courage. “I waited all day to talk to you.”
“Only a couple, okay? I promise,” Steve buts his head softly against Tony’s in thanks. “Just to refresh my memory later.”
“Okay, try this,” Steve sighs. “Close your eyes.”
“We should go,” he says, and Tony wraps his arms around his blond’s neck.
She moves away looking somewhere between annoyed and apologetic, leaving Tony alone with Steve.
"I'm asking you to stay.”
- - - - -
“Well, I’ve gotta do
"Tony."
“Mhmm, very good morning,” he gasps, when Steve pulls away with one final, wickedly sharp nip at Tony’s bottom lip.
“I don’t--“ Tony starts, but a sudden bout of laughter from outside Pepper’s office makes him stop, and his heart skips a beat when he registers whose it is.
“Really?”
Bucky disappears without another word, and then, seconds later–
“I not sleepy, Daddy,” their daughter repeats, but she yawns again and rubs her eyes a second later.
Aristotle said that a friend is a single soul in two bodies, yeah? He’s the other half of mine. [
he’s smiling. “No compliments whatsoever. Wouldn’t want that head of yours to get any bigger.”
Bark!
“You’re welcome,” Tony finally says, and revels in the sounds of his family’s happiness for the rest of the morning.
“...I’m not.”
Only to be doused by the rough, slurred voice that fills the living room a second later.
“Uh, I think I
"I woulda waited," Steve says, willing himself to not fidget. "I don't want ya to miss class--"
Barnes leans toward the bag Steve put in the corner of the couch. “I’m kinda curiou--
Summer of Stony prompt #8: “I cannot believe you just did that.”
Steve takes a deep breath, and reaches into his pocket. “And I just… I want you to know that every day I spend with you is-- it’s the best day of my life.”
“I’m getting a little disturbed.” Red finally blinks.
“Gimme a minute, I just…” he trails off, running to their baby’s room to find what he’s looking for.
It’s ironic, really, because everyone’s at the Tower that night, settled into the living room and debating on what movie to pick.
"Don't say that,” Rhodey scowls.
Steve doesn’t say anything, and he’s still holding the sketchbook so hard, his knuckles are white. “He’s always wanted one,” he says, and Tony grins because just like that, he knows he’s won.
,” he mumbles against Steve’s lips, against his cheek, his nose, his eyes, every part of his face he can reach. Steve’s arms are tight around his waist, holding Tony to that muscled chest he loves so much. He palms the skin over Steve’s heart and revels in the strong, sure beat he can feel beneath. “I love you,” he whispers.
“Learned from the best,” Steve says.
“Oh my god, why are you doing this to me?” Tony groans, wiping his tears. “This is your fault, y’know– I’m a fucking mess because of you.”
It starts when Bucky comes home after the first day of school, stands in front of Steve with his tiny, five-year old hands on his tiny, five-year old waist, and tells him:
“Slow down, I don’t want you to choke.”
Like home.
"I know what you mean, sweetheart," Steve says.
“Who are you?” His neighbor interrupts, those gorgeous baby blues narrowed in confusion.
“Give us a warnin’ next time, will ya, Stark?”
“It suits you. Makes me wanna draw you just like this.”
,” Tony gasps, and pulls him even closer. “Shut up,
"What?"
“That’ll be better than anything I’ve had all week, so I’ll take it,” Tony says, thumb rubbing Steve’s bicep absentmindedly, and for all that his touch is whisper-soft, Steve feels it all over his body.
, Cap! If she wakes up--”
Steve doesn’t leave the bed like Tony’d been expecting. He doesn’t move at all, except to turn his body sideways until he’s facing Tony. “I need to say something first.”
, babe. I’m sure as hell not the nonagenarian.”
“Sounds good,” Rhodey nods, and leaves Tony with a wink and a thumbs up over Steve’s shoulder.
“Does it matter?”
“So when’s a good time for Steve to leave for our trip?”
“Yes, that’s your name,” Steve nods, stepping further into the room as he reaches for his penlight.
“I thought so,” Steve’s voice sounds breathless, and Tony revels in it.
Tony nods, and lets his body relax against the solid, steady presence of his Captain. “I’m surprised they managed to keep their grabby little paws to themselves. Alright,” he waves lazily in the direction of the tree. “Go nuts.”
“…wanted to know if he could buy you a drink.”
, Steve thinks, and reaches out to pat the pug’s paw with a finger. “She seems calm.”
"Figured what out?"
Steve rolls his eyes fondly. “Made it for twenty-five years,” he replies. “What’s a couple of hours, right?”
Warnings: NONE.
“Yeah, no,” Tony shakes his head. “Let’s call it a day, babe.“
The brunet just nods.
“Hi, handsome.”
"Okay, and what about the time Peggy Carter wanted to go out with him? You remember what you did?"
“Any particular reason why you’re spoiling me today?”
“Baby videos!” Clint screeches, holding up a handful of VHS tapes and waving them in front of him. “
“Can I hold you?”
Which is damn good, in case it’s not clear.
“Finish your pizza first,” Tony replies. “And you don’t need to hide everyone’s crust in your pocket, kid. We can just order more later.”
“I thought I’d, uh, do some body parts. I have Nat in her ballet slippers, and, um, Clint’s arms. And Buck’s smile, and... everyone else.”
March Prompt #19: “Please, just- stay. Please.”
“The sexiest?”
“Wow.”
“Comin’ right up,” Steve nods, and moves to the back room. He wants nothing more than to ask him who it’s for– who the lucky soul is, to get a gift like that from Tony Stark– but he stays silent as he picks out the freshest, most vibrant sunflower from the bunch, and takes it back to the brunet with a smile.
“Yes,
“What did you do?” Steve asks, without looking up from the pan bubbling over the stove.
tickets?”
- - - - -
Steve’s smile is the last thing he sees before the screen goes black, and when Tony throws the blankets over his head, he knows there’ll be no nightmares tonight.
Because it’s not Jarvis waiting with Pepper next morning. It’s a tan, lean man in a fitted suit-- that obviously costs more than Steve makes in half a year-- with tousled hair, big brown eyes, and the most beautiful smile Steve’s ever seen.
“Huh. Good to know. Now I can just scrimp on the fancy shit and just roll out the barbecue from now on, huh?”
"I need you here."
” she coos, as she presumably crouches down to bring baby Tony further into view. “
“And I love you, baby, so damn much. I love your mind– every razor sharp, lightning fast bit of it. And I love your heart. God, it…. it
, he remembers Steve telling him, hours before they’d kissed each other goodbye beside the Quinjet.
Tony swallows the lump in his throat, and nods. “Good.”
“Gonna tie me up, gorgeous?” he asks, and then his brain catches up and,
“I’m an ass all the time. I get it,” Tony says, and then lets out a hiss when the ice pack digs into the bruised skin around his eye.
“God bless Captain America,” Pepper hears Tony crow. “Always thinkin’ about the people.”
“Tony,” a pint-sized Rhodey squeals, tugging on Tony’s jeans enthusiastically. “I not s’eepy!”
“Come
“Antonio, is it... is it really you?”
“And don’t run off, please. Walk right next to me and Daddy.”
Tony burrows closer into him. “Dunno. Don’t wanna think about it.”
“Shut up,” is all Tony says, but hours later, when the tree stands complete in the Stark Tower living room, he can’t help the pathetically giddy grin at the sight of Captain America and Iron Man hanging side by side for all to see.
“No you’re not. You love me.”
“Look at them,” he nods in the direction of their daughter, who’s now strapping the leash to her wrist with that familiar furrow of determination on her tiny brow. She looks so much like Steve, it almost hurts.
“Yeah,” he admits. “I am. But if I see you moping around the new digs anytime soon, Rogers, I swear--”
“And don’t you forget it, Agent. Now can you get me outta these things please?” She jiggles the cuffs again, sighing in relief when Coulson obeys, and then hugs the briefcase to her chest. “So, last time this happened–”
“No Santa,” she shakes her head, arms still curled beside Tony’s heart.
,” he hears Natasha whisper into his ear, red curls ticking his cheek as she plops down by his head.
“Tony–”
Warnigns: NONE (might be a little nsfw, though).
“Yes, baby?”
“You are absolute impossible, aren’t you?” Steve sighs, unable to keep the fondness from his voice. “Here,” he slides a tray table beside the bed closer. “Have a pudding cup in the meantime. ”
too small for the birthday boy to get a piece.”
,” he stutters. The living room is suddenly more silent than he can ever remember it being, and he runs to the elevator before anyone can say a word. Pepper hurries after him, and he slams the close button so she can’t reach him.
. Y’like Cat, Papa?”
“Except it is,” Steve says. “Because you don’t.”
“Jesus Christ, why are you like this? It’s disgusting,” Tony groans, stretching out languidly, and Steve just barely keeps them from flipping over. “Y’know, this is why I flew us out here-- vacation, change of scenery, all that jazz. You should try it sometime.”
“I love you, too.”
There’s a gentle smile on Bruce’s face as he runs curious fingers down the side of the little green Hulk. “I didn’t even know they had these.”
“Not if your mom has a sweet tooth,” Tony replies, voice slightly rougher than it’d been moments before. “Does she?”
A muscle in his jaw jumps out when he grinds his teeth, even as his face and ears flush the most attractive shade of pink Tony’s ever had the pleasure of getting to see.
“Can’t fool me, mister,” Steve says softly, and when he pulls his hand away, Tony’s pretty sure he imagines the way it lingers just a little bit as a finger traces his jawline. “I see right through ya.”
“You came up here to tell me that?”
“But you’re too mature for that, aren’t you?” Tony smirks.
“Yeah?” is all Tony can breathe out, heart suddenly thudding a little harder against his chest.
“Fine, I’ll do it myself,” he nods, and hides a smile when Natasha sighs and takes his arm to help him leave the bed. The floor is only a little cold, and Tony spares a glance at his feet to find bright red fuzzy socks covering them. “Smart.”
But Steve’s favorite part of the night is when he asks Tony about what he does, because the brunet’s eyes go wide and bright as he goes off about robotics and engineering and other things Steve couldn’t even begin to understand. He can only stand there and take in the way Tony just
“I’m pretty sure you’d fall on your ass if you tried to walk,” Steve answers, “no matter how good you think you feel. It’s a safety precaution, Tony.”
- - - - -
Tony rolls his eyes. “Oh my god, don’t be a kiss-ass.”
“You’re an idiot.”
Tony looks ready to argue, but Steve bops his nose before he can, chuckling when Tony wrinkles it a second later. “What was that for?”
Neither of them say anything as Steve settles them both into the couch, pulling Tony close as they lie from end to end. He splays one hand on the small of Tony’s back, runs the other up and down his spine, and presses his lips against the other man’s temple.
“Yes, dear,” Steve sighs exaggeratedly, and Tony wraps his arms around the blond’s neck as they giggle like idiots.
Then--
The car is silent when Steve speaks, and Tony looks away from the gray, tree-filled view beyond the window to meet baby blue eyes.
, is all Tony can think.
“No, it’s--” Tony licks his lips. “It’s, y’know, fine. Makes me look roguish, actually,” he waggles his eyebrows, and feels a thrill of victorious pleasure when the blond honest to God
“Cap’s got a big stomach, honey bear. Gotta keep him satisfied.”
“Give me fifteen minutes,” Pepper tells him, “and you will. But in the meantime, take care of that boy.”
“My shift ends at five, so anytime after that, if you wouldn’t mind.”
“That was nice of her,” Steve tells him, and this time, when Bucky nods again, he’s grinning. “We should make more cookies then, don’t you think?”
“No you’re not. And neither am I,” Tony scoffs, grinning when both she and Steve glare at him. “What?”
“Yeah?”
“That too.”
, all wide blue eyes and deliciously pink cheeks. “
"I did," Tony says, and grins. "Marry me, baby? Make me the happiest son of a bitch in the world?"
Steve’s laughter warms him down to his toes. “
It’s sudden and clumsy and more than a little salty from his tears, but Tony pours every bit of his scarred and broken heart into it. And when he finally pulls away, it’s only to rest his forehead against Steve’s.
- - - - -
“Gotcha.”
"Lucky for us, you don’t have to.”
Which he does. With pleasure.
He’s tired of feeling hurt.
Steve chuckles lowly. “You’re not the one holding the leash.”
“Yes, sir,” Steve gives him a lazy salute, smile brighter than any star. “Right away, sir.”
“I know!”
“At least we’re both here,” Steve says, a happy smile lighting up his face, and Tony feels a familiar warmth rush through him.
“I’m never tellin’ you anything, ever again.”
- - - - -
“Meatball,” Tony mutters when he looks up from the note, but he can feel the smile on his face when he gives DUM-E’s claw a pat.
Summer of Stony prompt #7: “Please don’t do this.”
” Tony almost whimpers. “Oh my god, okay, you’re perfect. It’s settled-- destiny, two thumbs up. Is it Thursday already?”
The words are as natural as everything in his brain has always come-- as natural as thinking and creating and breathing-- so he doesn’t notice he's said them out loud until Steve's pencil falls from his fingers, and that's when his brain catches up to him and
“Tony Stark,” he manages to say.
"...Oh my god, you did
“I used to dream about driving the plane into the ocean, about seeing Bucky fall, over and over again. And it’d keep me up at night, every time. But now… Now I dream about you.”
“I don’t know what to say.”
took you guys so long? Training session my a–”
“Hey, Cap,” he says, helpless to the smile that settles on his face.
“This was a good idea.”
“Oh god, Tony.”
“Good enough for me, Captain,” Tony nods, and finally leans in to taste the smile on Steve’s lips.
“I try,” Steve chuckles.
Wade shook his head, poking at the dinosaur’s leg. “Don’t think you mentioned it.”
“My car’s that way.” Tony pointed out.
Steve then laughed, coming as a surprise to Tony. “Oh.”
Steve chuckled, shaking his head. “Yeah, but you’re my idiot.”
Most of them nodded, many of them sighing in relief that they were finally going to be able to put their feet up for five.
“Tony, don’t start panicking.”
Steve said, sounding worried. “
Tony groaned, rubbing a hand down his face. “Right, right,” he said, taking a deep breath. “We need to uh… we need to get those people as far away from the outskirts as we can, the Foni-…mabob is most probably still a way away from the main park right?”
Thor groaned, putting his head in his hands. “I forgot he was second in command.”
“Anyway, gentlemen,” Steve began, grabbing his motorbike keys out of his pocket. “I’d best be off home, I’ve been hanging out with my lizards for a little too lo-,”
“Bless you.” Wade chortled, pressing his face into the glass. “Can we go pet it?”
At least five minutes later Wade whooped in victory at finally being able to put on his shoe. Peter by this point had almost fallen into a deep sleep against a tree, but was rudely interrupted as Wade yanked him off the floor and got them on their way again.
Peter sighed heavily, sitting back in his seat and looking up at the sky through the glass roof. If he was being honest, and he wasn’t going to tell Wade, it wasn’t exactly what he’d pictured either. Before they’d hopped into the jeep the young employer, who spoke like he was high on helium, had blabbed on enthusiastically about the gigantic dinosaurs they’d be able to see on the ride. So far, there’d been zilch dinosaurs.
In his own thoughts as he drove Tony didn’t even hear his phone ringing, until the call was diverted to the car’s radio, courtesy of his own design. Tony looked down for a second to see who it was and groaned as he saw his sister’s name pop up. He supposed he’d have to get it over and done with.
“What?” Peter almost shrieked, pulling Wade back before he could take another step. “We are
He forgot they’d had a bet, and Loki most definitely screamed like a girl.
Tony nodded and hid a smile, as he heard his phone vibrate he was more focused on figuring out a way to get it out of his friend’s pocket than the so called sponsors waiting for them. He had no choice but to stand up straight when Bruce hit him on the arm to get his attention. The engineer straightened his tie and flattened his hair, turning to Bruce with a grin, extending his arms out so he could get a good look at him. Bruce just rolled his eyes, facing forward quickly as the elevator pinged and the doors opened.
Wade glimpsed over, just as the dinosaur went out of their sight. He immediately knew what Peter was talking about, because with a second glance the older man could see that on the other side of the fence it didn’t exactly look alluring. It was dark for one thing, like all the trees had closed in on each other and created a spooky tunnel, and not to mention the fog floating across the ground and the creepy sounds of birds or whatever it was reaching their ears.
“Seatbelts on!” Tony said, starting up the engine.
“What are you looking at?” He called over, gaining the mother’s attention who didn’t look pleased, and was pulling her child far away from Loki without question. Loki smirked, mission accomplished.
Tony felt his heart skip a beat at Thor’s words, he let out a heavy breath he’d been holding, feeling like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. “Fuck.” He cursed, holding a hand to his heart, one stray tear falling down his cheek. “Jesus, fucking Christ!” before he could stop himself he felt his knees give way, thankfully Thor was quick enough to guide him into a chair.
“Tony, I’ve seen that thing a couple of times, hiding behind the trees in its old enclosure.” Steve said in all seriousness. “It’s not
Everyone watched as the Pterodactyls flew above them, and thankfully turning the other way. They couldn’t believe how many there were, there must have been over a hundred, from fully grown ones to babies the size of a small child. But the group could sigh in relief, as the last Pterodactyl made their way through the sky, in the opposite direction to the jeep.
Wade and Peter were sitting up against a tree in the darkened woodland, far enough from two Ankylosaurs they’d come across not long after they’d stepped between the gate. They were quietly discussing what outfits would look best on them, a suit or a ballerina dress, before they heard a loud, thunderous rumble, the ground shaking underneath them.
driving.”
After Thor had called him and reassured him that the boy and his dumb boyfriend had been found, and he didn’t have to worry anymore, Loki was seconds away from throwing his phone into the nearest dinosaur cage. But instead he’d decided to stuff his phone in his pocket and take a walk, far away from people. It felt like hours before he’d gone back to Main Street.
The pair were met by four others, standing in suits and ties with briefcases held tight in their hands. Bruce smiled politely. “Welcome to Jurassic Island.”
“It wasn’t your fault.” Natasha answered for him, expression serious. “That dinosaur should have been put down as soon as she tried to escape the first time.”
“Wait a minute!”
Turning around, ready to get the hell out of the dinosaur’s space, Steve answered his phone. “Tony?”
“Did you hear that?” Steve looked behind him and the sound grew louder before it faded.
“Exactly.” Steve sighed. “There’s no way I’m letting Schmidt get his hands on my raptors, he’s obviously up to something bigger than just seeing how powerful these dinosaurs are.”
“NO!” Jessica yelled back, pushing Steve away towards the gate. “Get out of here! Just go!” she said, face contorted in anger.
Peter smiled, secretly relieved as hell that there were no buttons and leavers his boyfriend could mess around with. God only knew the trouble he’d get them in if there were. But within minutes Wade was practically bouncing up and down in his seat, steering wheel be damned. The jeep had taken off slowly into the open field just in front of the small building, and was soon entering the dinosaur’s territory through the massive, brown gate.
And without another word Peter was tugging on Wade’s hand, and practically skipping towards the information centre, knowing that’s probably where they were going to go next anyway. Tony and Steve followed behind them, gesturing to the Shield workers who were waiting patiently for their next orders.
It felt like hours before he got a reply from Thor, but in reality it only took a few minutes to get the dinosaur up on screen. By then he was five minutes from the building, but he needed to know now.
“You must be Wade?”
The teenager stopped laughing when he heard his name being called, looking around in confusion he soon saw the source of the voice. Strutting down a flight of steps to their right was his uncle Tony, wearing his usual suit and tie with his phone clutched in his hand as always. Peter sent him a wave as the engineer walked towards them.
It was true. They kneeled in the grass for almost five minutes watching the dinosaur eat grass and swing its enormous tail back and forth, and not once did it seemed bothered by the fact that the two were so close by. It became apparent that the dinosaur wasn’t going to be going anywhere anytime soon either, by the way it was chomping down on every tiny grain of the green stuff, and Wade was getting bored by just watching it.
Logan nodded. “You’ll be hand feeding them soon enough.”
By this point Bruce had realised that the other two weren’t laughing. In fact, Steve looked even gloomier than he had minutes before, and Tony, well, by now he’d have been laughing along at the ridiculous joke, but his face was more serious than it had ever been.
“Stop the car.”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded in agreement. “I’ll have a look when we’re on our way, we should go now.”
“Sorry, Aunt May, Wade just did something crazy.” He said with a grin, sending Wade a wave as he ran past, Loki hot on his tail.
“No,” Peter said, feeling the ground tremble some more. “They’re vegetarians.”
Steve sighed as he jammed his inhaler back into his pocket, observing the raptors as their gaze tore from him, their forms retreating into the trees and out of sight. Incidents like that always made him realise just how hard he’d have to work to get his raptors to trust him.
Loki kept crying, the fear of almost getting killed by one of those creatures still at the back of his mind. Thor helped him to stand, as the younger of the two still clung to him like his life depended on it, eyes scanning the area anxiously, fearing another Pterodactyl would swoop down and take him again. But Thor tucked him close to his side, as he led him down Main Street.
It felt like slow motion as the three lifted their feet off the ground and made a sprint for the open gate. Steve kept his eyes on the exit, trying his damn hardest to tune out the thunderous thumping of the dinosaur’s feet on the ground. He tugged Jessica along as she began to falter from not having her husband beside her, Luke running at the back like a barrier between them and the meat eater.
Tony whistled under his teeth as he started to descend the ladder, because maybe Steve had a point. "That would be worse than a case of stache rash, that's for sure."
he had secrets, and this was an excellent way to find out things, but when Tony looked down at himself, he was looking a little… more translucent than he had, in the med lab.
Tony blinked once, twice, slower than Steve was happy with. "Yes. Right. Yeah. Can you move either of your hands?"
"I checked, his jet came in ten minutes ago, I'm sure he'll be here soon," Robbie responded.
Steve grins. There's nothing like a good fight to get his brain back on course, and sparring with Iron Man always counts as a good fight.
"You’re not making much sense, Shell-Head.”
"What can I say," Tony said. "I was in a good mood. Can't think of any particular reason why."
Steve moves his gaze from her to Tony, a clear question on his face:
"Whoever you are," Steve called out, and Tony glanced up from the drawer he was working on to see Steve had put Sarah down and had a hockey stick outstretched in both hands. Huh. Tony could have sworn Steve was more of a baseball kind of guy.
″We weren't going to die,” Steve said. He felt like he had to protest that. He wasn’t a fan of Tony talking about his death. “It wasn't that close.″
managed to hallucinate a disappointed expression on Steve's face.

"You shouldn't give me anything," Steve said, surprising both Tony and Carol by the venom in his tone. Steve's face clenched weirdly and then he relaxed and shook his head a little. "I'm sorry. I'm just—I should have stayed behind and fought the Elves," Steve muttered. His eyes were locked on Tony's unconscious body. He looked miserable, but then, he was currently vocally beating himself up for making the wrong call on the battlefield. Steve was right; he
″I think you're romanticizing the past.″
Once back at the mansion, the Avengers all vocally swear off space adventures for a while, and pull Doctor Strange in to check Steve and Tony over. Steve's sour when he overhears Strange telling the others that Tony and Steve didn't invent the impossible room—traces of time magic are all over them, apparently— but the sourness fades when he hears Strange adding instruction to be careful with them. Steve doesn't wait for them to give the all-clear announcement—he drags Tony upstairs instead.
In another life, Steve might have screamed at him, but he's just so glad that he has Tony back that he just tells Tony where they're up to, and they both pretend Steve's voice isn't shaking.
panic and yell at him later.
Tony got to his feet; he didn't want Steve to finish that sentence. "I installed a temperature guard on your water heater so it can't go above 120 degrees Fahrenheit, too." Tony nodded across at a wall with a phone outlet. "Once you get your phone line hooked up, make sure you get a wired landline phone. If the power goes out, you want to know you've got a phone working in an emergency. Y'know I'd come in a second, but even Iron Man can't get here faster than an ambulance."
"Oh, Steve," Carol breathed. Her voice was unusually soft, kinder than Tony had heard it in a long time. She didn't know Tony was there, he supposed. "How long?"
Okoye's smile was brief, rueful. "Not doing so well. I had to file a formal complaint against him this morning." At T'Challa's obvious confusion, and Tony's matching invisible bafflement, Okoye explained, "Gorilla-Man. Kevin wanted to take the Christmas tree down; according to his statement, Rogers went feral, almost ripped his head off. If She-Hulk hadn't been there to restrain him—"
Steve's shoulders sagged, the only visible proof he'd listened to her. Carol stepped closer to him, leaning against him, letting him know he had support.

"This is ridiculous," Tony said, narrowing his eyes at Strange, waving his hands in front of Strange's face. "I'm right here. Hello!"
"First," Steve said, after putting Sarah down for a nap in an adjacent room, "I have to apologize for slamming the door in your face. You startled me."
When Steve had returned to life, Tony had just been so desperate. He'd spent so long pleading and begging helplessly to the void for Steve to come back. Just him being

Tony closed his eyes and sank into the sensations. His body was alight, feverish. The world had narrowed down into a universe of sensation, stars being born in the slide of Steve's tongue in his mouth.
"Funny story. Turns out the magic those damn elves hit me with just separated my consciousness from my body. Strange said something about an unusual fourteenth plane – it sounded like bullshit to me – needless to say… I was here the whole time." Tony spread his hands wide. "Ta-da?"
"Oh, I’m well aware of how screwed I am, Cap,” Iron Man’s voice hitched awkwardly midway, but he didn’t balk from finishing the sentence. "I mean, there’s no one to tell."
"He remembered me," Happy hissed to Tony. Okay, so, maybe Happy was still a
Iron Man made a soft murmur of agreement. “So, we’ll be completely fine."
"You've heard of me?" Isaac sounded pleased.
"Um," Tony said, loudly. Maybe he could sit there frozen and stare at the door and not shift his gaze to the right back to where Steve was sitting and probably staring at him in horror and oh god, Tony hated everything.
Tony would have enjoyed the drive if he wasn't so worried. What was Steve running from? What

"Sure." Steve beams. "Um."
Steve huffed quietly. "You always say things in the nicest of ways."
"Thanks for asking."
What the heck? Steve frowns.
He won't let himself think about it. He knows Tony is Iron Man and he doesn't have Tony's

"Iron Man might have, once or twice," Steve says.
Her next words weren't what Steve expected at all.
"So are you.”
"Oh. Oh, I'll ask him to put them in his bedroom or something." Steve's cheeks go a little pink. "I'm sure he wouldn't deliberately make you uncomfortable, Iron Man. You should tell him when things bother you."
"Steve," Tony says, slowly. "I've had a nice time. But it seems to me that—"
Tony readied himself to pull back from the kiss, reluctant because each one was as dizzyingly good as the first, and—
"I need to take a look at the site of the attack," Strange said, straightening up and backing away from Tony's body.
to Steve's
"What do you mean by
"Ah, no," Steve said. Tony glanced over to where Steve was staring at a china figurine that looked particularly small and fragile in his large hands. It was an amusing figurine—a replica of Thor but with angel wings and a halo, somewhere there was a matching Loki with devil horns and a tail and an inexplicable Santa hat to complete the ensemble—but Steve stared at it like it was invisible to the naked eye. "Not this year."
″You're a terrible nurse,″ Tony finally wheezed, and maybe Steve's mouth
″Your heart troubles. And your company's liability.″
Tony did the math on their first day there. Two hundred dials, each with fifty potential numbers. Tony tried to figure out just one dial at first like each was an individual safe to crack; it took them four reset days to figure out that each dial just needed to be set to one number. That still meant there is….a lot of possible permutations. On day 6, Tony spoke a number out loud which had approximately 47 zeroes.
That was—that was awful. Horrifying. "You have more than Jarvis. You have to. It doesn't make sense. You’re too—" Words were failing him. Maybe he was more hurt than he thought he was. His confusion was profound and perplexing and bewildering all at once. "You’re
Problem, trouble,
There was something oppressive about the homogeneous gray space. It wasn’t just the uniformity and the low ceilings; everything screamed carefully curated artifice. Even the air was stiff, false somehow. When Steve voiced that thought, Iron Man cheerfully rambled on about how mechanical ventilation provided a fresh airflow, which in normal conditions, would disperse all the car exhaust fumes.
" He hummed under his breath. She didn't settle until he started singing AC/DC. There was probably something wrong with Steve's baby, especially when she fell asleep to Tony singing about being on a doomed kind of road.
″It doesn't have to mean anything.″ Steve's face felt hot. Well, at least that meant he had some spare blood and it wasn't all seeping out of his body. ″I mean it as a compliment. I won't—jump you, or anything, it's just—it is what it is. I'm not the kind of coward who retracts a statement just because it's awkward, or unwanted—″
Van Dyne probably sent her to make sure he wasn't trying to run away. It figured.
"How can you know that?" Steve asked, his eyes scraping over Tony's limp hand, clasped between both of his own.
see what was right in front of him.
"Oh, I know the man well enough," Tony said, which was playing it down, but he was getting used to talking about Steve casually. He had to. Like much of Tony, it was a carefully controlled performance. His crush on Captain America when he was a teenager had been embarrassing; to be crushing on the man
"So…you don't just step out of the armor at the end of the day?" Sam is asking as Steve listens in.
"Steve," Tony breathed. This was agony. Where the fuck was Strange? Why had everyone but Steve given up on him? Why wasn't someone hauling Steve's dumb ass out of the med lab? What good was it doing
"Oh," Steve said. "Well. I'm still glad you're back."
as true as romantic." She wrinkled her nose. "It was worth a try."
Steve huffs a laugh into Tony's hair. "Took you long enough."
"Great," Steve says. "Watch out: Bombshell!" He holds up his shield and protects both of them from one of Bombshell's grenades.
"Unless your sensors are damaged."
what happened next, really.
"Not me."
me?" Steve's voice was harsher than he meant it to be. Steve was aware that he was the villain of this piece, and yet, he couldn't help himself. Tony had been his best friend for the last five and a half years; being apart from him all the time
"—your heart isn't really in it. Do you want to tell me what's wrong?"
"Sometimes Shell-Head is a real know-it-all," Steve agrees. "I like to think I can still surprise him, once or twice, though."
"But should I take him flowers or something? On our date, I mean?"
There's a moment of dismay, that Tony hadn't trusted him to keep the secret, but that's quickly swept away, because Steve gets it. It's important that Tony and Iron Man are separate identities; Iron Man can do things that Tony Stark could never do. And Steve can feel it now, the thrill of being someone
Happy was astutely staring at him. "You're a trial-and-error kind of guy, boss," Happy gestured at the glass. "Try it and see?"
sort of thing. Well. That was probably a good thing.
"It's basically soft. You just pull it on, snap the connections, polarize it, and bam, it's solid." Iron Man actually shrugs this time. "It means I'm not exactly having to heave it on the subway."
So there Steve was, immediately Sarah's primary and sole guardian. A social worker that had suggested that Steve could put Sarah into foster care, as Dino had no other living relatives left who could try and make a claim for custody, but Steve couldn't bear the idea. The idea of letting Sarah go into the system had been too much. Steve knew he would never forgive himself for
Tony rolls over with a questioning expression that melts when he sees the panic on Steve's face. Steve shakes his head furiously because pity isn't what he needs, the panic is still whiting out the edges of his vision, he can't do this alone, he can't—

that Steve was hiding, that ironically made it easier for Tony to find him. Because he knew how Steve thought. Most of the time, anyway. They'd talked about it once, on one of their irregular but frequent picnics; dozing under the sun on a blanket, pleasantly full and satisfied after another successful supervillain skirmish; Steve had waxed lyrically about what he thought his life might be like. There was a little town in Maine that his mother had taken him to, just once; the only vacation of Steve's childhood that he could recall with any clarity. Steve spoke about it fondly. It had been the only place he remembered his mom being truly happy.
Aged twenty two and fresh out of university, Steve had his dream job and loved every second of it. Two years into it and he was still running around with the dinosaurs.
“Tony,” Steve said, slipping the last of the bullets into his pocket. “Everything will be fine. We’ll get Peter back, we’ll get everyone off this island, and kill the Foniassaurus. Don’t worry.”
“Don’t ‘but Tony’ me!”
Peter didn’t waste any time in getting them the hell out of there. “Run!” he screeched, seizing Wade’s jacket and pulling him along.
“Bigger problem?” Bruce repeated.
“It’s why you love me.” Wade grinned, leaning down to catch Peter’s lips between his own.
Wade looked puzzled at the question but answered anyway. “Twenty seven.”
*****
Tony wished there was an easy answer, a way to just snap his fingers and make the problem disappear, bring back his friends. But life was cruel and there was only one thing they could do.
Ever since he was a kid Steve’s only wish was to work at Jurassic Island. Being the biggest fan of dinosaurs he’d begged his mother to take him to the park just once, and that had him determined to do anything to make his wish come true. When his mother had passed away she’d left him enough money to get into university, meaning he could study dinosaurs and learn all about their behaviour and the world they lived in. Four years of studying hard and passing all his exams with flying colours had paid off as he’d been snatched up by Jurassic Island, who wanted him to start as soon as he’d left his school.
“They were here!” Tony declared as he noticed the door open.
“What?” Tony squealed in disbelief. “Steve, we have to get back to base, we are not following the damn dinosaur!”
Steve’s eyes widened, his phone dropping onto the dirt as he came face to face with the Foniassaurus, Jessica and Luke standing even closer to it. Steve could feel his heart begin to race, his palms were sweaty, and his legs began to shake as fear started to take over at the size of the thing standing before them, forty feet tall with jaws bigger than a T-rex. But he didn’t have time to be scared, he knew that if he didn’t act now they’d all be done for. Measuring the distance in his mind from where they were to the gate, Steve knew they’d have a chance, they just needed to run as fast as their legs could take them.
“What a waste of perfectly good butt warmers.”
Tony wanted to cry in relief. “Thor! This is an emergency, you hear me?”
They weren’t exactly sure what to expect on the other side of the door, and what they got was pretty anticlimactic. It was just a long, dirty, dark hall with one door to the left and one to the right, with an emergency exit door at the end. Wade groaned, as if disappointed that he didn’t find a room full of skittles and marshmallows.
As Steve settled back in his seat, Tony pulled away his hand and stared at the blonde like a deer caught in headlights. He’d come this far to want to talk to Steve, and now he didn’t know how to start.
“Bet you a hundred bucks he wants to use them to take over the world.”
“I’m sure Natasha can be swayed.” Schmidt said as he began walking around the place. “She’s up for anything that one.”
“Well,” Tony shrugged. “Can’t you put in a new one?”
******
Steve practically yelled over the lines.
Tony laughed, eyes widening as Steve stepped through to the other side of the wall, into the not so inviting dark woods. He didn’t really have a choice but to follow. “You’re starting to sound like me.”
Just like that the peace was broken. Steve and his group of friends looked up and found chaos across the metal bridge that Steve had been on minutes ago, workers running across it and around the enclosure, some yelling whilst some stood there staring into the cage looking deathly pale.
“That’s my boy.”
Bobby bobbed his head fast. “I’m good. I’m good. Thanks. Thank you.”
“What?” Wade got up and looked down at the younger man all sweet and innocent. “You know you love my wet, dribble kisses!”
“We’ll talk later.”
“I needed that,” Steve said, sighing softly before looking up again at the engineer, a small smile still on his lips. “Was good to forget things even for only a few seconds. Thanks, Tony.”
“Good.” Natasha said, crossing her arms over her chest. “I’m glad he’s alright.”
Thor roared with delight. “Wonderful! I am glad he has found some fun.”
His voice came out so brash he’d put a halt to the pairs yelling match, their attention brought to him instead. Jessica even looked up, computer forgotten as she followed Steve’s line of sight.
“Oh, come on, sugar dumpling!” Wade whined at the top of his voice, earning quite a few funny looks from the other tourists. “I swear I won’t touch any big red buttons.”
“Come on!” Steve wasn’t giving up that easily, and noticing the tyre tracks on the ground he pushed Tony forward the same way. “Let’s go!”
“Here!” Thor ran over, handing her an electronic device. “Carol’s at the front row, she’s getting the cameras up, connecting your team to our computers.”
Once their bus had come to a stop at the docks, Wade grabbed their bags and practically ran excitedly onto the boat, Peter passing the other passengers with a mortified look on his face. It was bad enough Wade was wearing a kid’s hat with a green dinosaur on the front. Peter’s embarrassment soon died away when the boat took off and they were on their way to the island, standing at the front of the vessel looking out into the wide, open sea. Dolphins jumped up beside the boat as it sped through the water, as birds flew high above them, and in the distance a huge, green mountain grew even bigger the closer they got.
The soldier didn’t answer, instead, he focused on the dim, flashing light he’d spotted out of the corner of his eye. Hastily he got down on his knees in the dirt, reaching over he used one hand to dig through the leaves and mud to get to it, the feeling of dread weighing heavy in the pit of his stomach.
“It’s her tracker.” Matt confirmed, tossing it onto the ground in anger. “Shit!”
“What are the employees going to tell them if they ask why, Tony?” Steve inquired from behind the man. “You can’t say there’s a dangerous dinosaur on the loose.”
“Right,” Tony heaved a heavy sigh, clapping his hands together. “Let’s do this.” He said, as he came to stand next to Thor. “Carol, keep the cameras of every soldier up on screen, Thor, get the Foniassaurus’s tracker up and everyone else, be ready for whatever comes next.”
following that thing in there, Wade!”
“Tony?” Steve said, as they were about to ascend the steps. “You made that way too easy. Are you sure it’s a good idea to let Peter and Wade stay?”
Schmidt grinned maliciously, staring Steve down. “Well then, let’s hope she’s not around for much longer.”
Thor had a feeling he wasn’t going to like what was coming next.
“Are you okay?” he began babbling. “What happened? How long have you been here? I don’t even want to know how you’re here, you’re here and that’s all that matters! You’ve lessened my life by at least ten years, Peter!”
The control room was located near the other end of the structure, right on the top floor, away from the hustle and bustle of the park. Tony always liked going there to get away from all the people on the outside, it was a lot quieter and the employees there were always either sitting noiselessly at their stations or communicating calmly through radios and intercoms.
With another whistle and a wave of his hands the Raptors all gave out a screech and took off into the trees, leaving scratch marks in the dirt as they went. Steve sighed in relief. The other employees watching through the steel gates gave him a clap and some cheers as Steve picked up his now empty bucket and made his way back over the bridge, descending some steps and checking the gate as he closed it behind him.
Within seconds Steve felt the warm air of the dinosaur’s breath ghost across his skin, the foul smell of it making him want to heave. There came a low snuffle, a quiet sniff, then just as quickly as it had happened Steve heard her move around and back away. He opened his eyes, and let out a huge sigh of relief as the dinosaur’s footsteps walked away, heading into the trees at the side of her old arena.
?” Thor squeaked over the phone, sounding like he didn’t believe it. “
Natasha took the time to start running, shouting orders at the others to keep going.
“She’s not here.” Matt said to the others, keeping his voice down. There was no way the tracker would be wrong.
As he got out he could see people running for cover, some standing there in sheer shock, Steve started bawling at them to hide without a second thought. Then, from inside the enclosure, gunshots could be heard firing off one after the other. Steve felt his stomach do a funny turn, the image of Luke being eaten alive still on his mind and before he knew it he was on his knees in the middle of the dirt path, bringing up the contents of his stomach.
“Where do you think they’ve gone?” Tony asked, as he wrung out more water from his shirt.
“Tony.” Steve called him softly and put a hand in his, before lifting a finger to point at the large screen.
“We need to kill this thing,” Matt said, putting an arm around Natasha. “If it gets bad out there, we’ll turn back. But we have to try before someone else gets hurt or worse.”
The engineer broke out of his thoughts when he heard Steve’s low voice from behind him. He expected to see him upset, angry, anything that showed how he was feeling at that moment. Steve had lost his friends too, Natasha was like a sister to him. But what he got was a blank stare, Steve looked at him with wide, watery eyes like he’d just seen a ghost, the colour drained from his skin and hands visibly shaking by his sides.
Steve looked in at what everyone else was gazing at, and his heart stopped. There, on his back inside the enclosure was their newest recruit Bobby, and in front of him the four Raptors lined up and slowly crept towards him with hunger in their eyes. Steve knew those movements, they were preparing to attack and eat the man alive.
“Yep!” Wade grinned brightly. “The one and only.”
“What if it’s dangerous?” Peter said, thinking about all the different things that could be behind the door. “Could be the electrics room or something.”
Back in the control room, Thor typed away frantically on his keyboard. His eyes scanned the screen in front of him, as he shut down each ride around the park, rechecked the electric fences and did anything else he could to try and keep the main street safe from any intruders, or gigantic, man-eating dinosaurs.
Peter nodded, taking small steps into the room and staring in awe. They were in a high ceilinged hall that reached up into a glass rooftop, one door to their left another to their right as one enormous, timber door stood to their front, all covered in dirt and dust. What caught their eye the most was the life-size skeleton of a T-Rex that practically took up most of the room, taking its stance in the middle. Every wall was decorated with old, decaying dinosaur patterned wallpaper, whilst posters and flyers of the creatures lay strewn on the ground underneath growing weeds and grass.
done something like that before.”
“Steve?” he whispered.
So he gave it all he got, digging his nails into the dinosaur’s skin, jolting frantically in its grasp. Loki let out a sob as they neared the pool, feeling like it was almost over. But, suddenly, there was shouting and gun shots going off down below, and the sound of something zipping past Loki. The Pterodactyl was hit by a bullet as it let out a piercing shriek, and its claws opened up, releasing Loki from its hold as it fell to the ground with a big thump.
Tony didn’t need to be told twice. Fumbling with his car keys it took him way too long to jab them into the lock and get inside the car, once in the driver’s seat he started the engine and sped off onto the dirt road, leaving a large cloud of dust behind.
If they were in any other situation Peter would have rolled his eyes, but instead he used his free hand to grab onto his boyfriends, squeezing it tight as they rocked back and forth. Peter shut his eyes as the ringing on his phone went on, before there was a click and suddenly Tony’s voice was shouting at him on the other end.
“What’s Stark going to do over the phone, Petey? Send you a new iPad to clout the thing over the head?”
The last thing he’d heard over his phone was Steve shouting, Steve’s obvious panic, before the sound of a dinosaur’s ear-splitting roar echoed through the line. He could still hear it now, as if mocking him. Tony had no idea what had happened, if the three had gotten out of there in time, if Steve was alright or even alive. His pace hastened as his thoughts swirled around in his mind, hoping to God that the nauseating pictures in his mind weren’t about to come true.
“Uh, Tony?”
It kept ringing and ringing, the high pitched drone making Tony want to fling the device at the wall the longer it went on. He growled loudly before hanging up, jabbing his fingers on the screen to try again.
“No,” Steve gasped, as there came another crash from the enclosure. All four members of the jeep held their breath, as out of a newly formed breach in the globe, a group of Pterodactyls flew out. “Oh, God.”
“I have no idea.” Peter answered Wade. “Maybe it’s a Brachiosaurus?”
Peter punched the air in victory, dancing around like an idiot as the engine of the jeep juddered and rumbled to life. It took him longer than expected to figure out exactly what was wrong with the vehicle, but eventually he’d stuck some wires in the right places, filled it up with oil, gave it a little kick and it had woken up with a jump.
Steve chuckled to himself, leading the way in front. “It was only a quick dip.”
“What do you think I’m doing?” Peter yelled, ducking under a thick branch that almost whacked him in the face.
There must have been hundreds of Pterodactyls flying towards the street, screeching and squawking as they came closer and closer, obviously aiming right for the large mass of people running around frantically. Loki felt fear take over as he dropped his phone without thinking, and his entire body froze as one of the dinosaurs swooped down, right on top of a man who screamed in agony as the creature began tearing his skin apart.
“Hiding.” Tony breathed in deeply, starting to put the puzzle together. “Holy shit, she was blending in and watching the fucking team!”
“Then get them off this island.” Steve’s gaze turned to him again, voice becoming agitated. “Send out an alarm to get them out, before the thing reaches them.”
Inside was another disappointment, and Wade pouted. The room had a large, round table sitting in the middle, surrounded by rotting chairs, and stacks of more wooden seats down one side of the wall.
It didn’t take long for them to arrive. Wade jumped up and down like a hyperactive child beside Peter, as the younger of the two stared in wonderment at the gigantic island in front of them. A wide spread of trees covered the mountains that almost touched the sky, mist streaming like a waterfall at their peaks, a long stretch of beach laid out at their end. It was like looking at something off of a postcard, another world where only nature existed.
Tony gasped. “Are you threatening me, Peter?”
“Where’s that blood coming from?” Natasha whispered, as she noticed the red stains appearing on her husband’s skin.
“I’m sure we won’t,” Peter said as he kept on walking, Wade trailing beside him. “I bet we taste gross, like coffee with too much sugar.”
“Hold on tight, Mr. Stark!” Danny shouted enthusiastically.
“Just what you do.” He said, as Jessica nodded along. “This dinosaur should never have been made, if it can break this glass then it’s not safe.”
“Oh yeah,” Wade sing-songed, lifting his foot up to reveal his wet, dirty socked foot. “Especially when my shoe decides to drown in the mud!”
“They’d kill smaller dinosaurs.” Steve answered, smiling as Thor chuckled away.
” Thor began. “
Tony ignored him, mind already boggled. “So, so that doesn’t explain how we couldn’t find her, Steve.”
Tony gasped. “Language!”
“Luke!”
“Do you think she’ll scare the children?” Luke asked beside him.
“Bruce,” Steve kneeled in front of the older man, placing a hand on his knee gently for support. “It’s not your fault, none of it. It’s nobody’s fault.”
Thor nodded, growling at his computer as it froze. “Damn you technology.” He gave the keyboard a whack, and almost jumped out of his skin when his phone began to ring. He picked up the device and saw Tony’s name flash across the screen. “Anthony?”
“How’s it going?”
“Not until we’ve got a solid plan for the Foniassaurus, Thor.” Clint said in all seriousness, as he sat on the edge of the desk. “We can’t have people going inside until we know where she is, and how we’re going to take her down.”
“I…” Tony inhaled deeply, yelling at himself in his head to just stop being a scaredy-cat and face it. “I just needed time to think, Steve.”
And that was that. With a quick goodbye and a see you later Tony was back up the steps, making his way into the technology department.
They didn’t waste another second. The two clutched onto their riffles and made their way outside, both feeling anxious and afraid for what they were about to do. They hoped and prayed they’d be alone out there.
“Fuck!” Wade screeched as the Foniassaurus let out an unhappy growl. “What do we do? What do we do? We’re gonna be dinosaur chow!”
“This is where we saw Peter and Wade?”
“If we don’t get out of here, Wade, there’s more of a chance of us getting eaten! We’re trapped!”
All of a sudden Wade came to an abrupt stop, letting go of Peter’s hand to clutch at his chest. “Shit, I’m getting old.” He panted. “And since when do you care what Uncle Starky thinks?”
“I’d be able to help more if I knew what dinosaur’s genes are in her.” Steve said.
He could practically hear her roll her eyes over the phone. “
Steve didn’t want to hear anymore. It seemed like Jessica was in the same boat as she shared a look with him before sauntering off to use the touch screen, Steve going the opposite direction. The researcher drowned out the sounds of the two bickering like a pair of teenagers by gazing through the glass, taking in every detail of the enclosure that he could.
“Uh… Anthony?”
The researcher turned to the two, feeling his phone begin to vibrate in his pocket. “What if it didn’t escape?”
.” Tony said over the com, trying to break the tension. It only made everyone roll their eyes as per usual.
Steve grinned. “Well, you were cranky, and I knew the only way to get you to cheer up was to have your favourite pretzels.”
“Did you just call me an idiot?” Tony joked with a grin.
“Jesus Christ!” Tony yelled, as Peter and Wade started panicking, flailing their arms around like a couple of monkeys. It wasn’t the Foniassaurus that was on their tail now, but a big crowd of Pterodactyls that were flying right towards them. “Let’s get the fuck out of here!”
Peter had never really needed the skills Tony had taught him before, only once when Wade’s car had broken down on the side of the road, and that was only because of the radiator overheating. He remembered most of what he’d learnt, so he pulled off his hoodie, threw it to the side and asked Wade to find him a box of tools. First things first, he needed to find the problem.
Steve said, and Natasha could tell by his voice that he wasn’t happy in the slightest. “
“Tony.” Steve warned, giving his hand a tight squeeze. “Please, just stop.”
Clint shook his head at Steve. “What a fucking asshole.”
“Sir!” he shouted, gaining everyone’s attention. “The Foniassaurus!”
“Any electrical faults?” Bruce said, doing his own investigation of the cameras on the screen. Everything looking normal, except for the mass of people cramped into Main Street. “At least we’ve got everyone into one place now.”
The first thing Loki heard was screams, loud, deafening screams from half of the people in Main Street, and he quickly jumped out of his seat and turned around in the direction of the shouting. Loki’s eyes widened in horror as he looked down Main Street. Not only were people running for their lives, and finding spots to hide, but up in the sky was a sight Loki thought he’d never see.
“Really?” Tony feigns shock. “The football team? Who’d’ve thunk it, hmm? Color me surprised.”
“I’m sorry.”
He loves vanilla with a passion. I don’t get it.
“You’re... s-serious?”
Tony shrugs. “Not sure people in my building go for these types of things,” he says.
“Did I... say all of that out loud?” Tony asks.
The blond looks completely blindside for a second, and then another, before the most delicious blush appears on his cheeks, spreading down his neck and below the collar of his tight, wet t-shirt.
Only the smallest glimmer of recognition lights those baby blues, but Steve just smiles. “Guess you were one of the smart ones, huh, stayin’ in here?”
“He does, doesn’t he?” Steve asks, feeling his lips curl up into a soft smile when he remembers the bright sounds of laughter filling the room not two days ago, as Tony corralled their team into the living room after an afternoon out of the Tower. They’d been wild with energy and almost unbearably loud, but the rest of the day had left Steve feeling joyful and relaxed, contentment settling in his stomach like a warm blanket.
“Tony--”
Warnings: NONE.
Tony’s smile turns wicked. “Oh
Look… There’s no one I trust more than my team. Every mission, every fight, they’re the ones I will always place my bets on. And this guy– [
SPOILER: Happy tells Peter that Tony sold Stark Tower and is moving upstate (presumably to the new Avengers facility).
He ignores the lone nurse taking vitals, and when she leaves, he doesn’t hesitate to climb on the bed and lay down beside Steve, timing his breathing to the soft rise and fall of Steve’s chest.
Steve spares his friends one last glance, then squares his shoulders and leans in to the mic. “
“Wittle.”
God, he loves art.
“Can I have some?” Bucky plops down on the chair next to him, and smiles affectionately when Steve pushes his bowl at him. “Thanks, bud.”
“Well,” the man says, leaning against a stack of moving boxes, “that sure boosted my ego.”
“You need to stop calling them that,” Natasha sighs.
– seems like a good reason t–
Well, except for the fading flush in his cheeks and the unruly tousle of hair on the back of his head. Natasha’s fingers itch to smooth it back into place.
– Buck, get me some towels! Shit,“ he bends down, gingerly gathering the broken pieces of the plate into a pile. There’s bacon grease smearing on the floor and on his fingers, but he has most of it together by the time Tony bends down and picks up a wayward bacon slice.
“I believe you,
“I know I--” Steve swallows, and bites his lip as they start another turn. “Sometimes I wonder if you know how much I love you.”
“Hoodies are hardly ‘grandpa garbs’. This one’s even got your face on it.”
Warnings: NONE.
“You with him?” the paramedic asks.
My workshop.
“Okay, mission accomplished.”
“Simmer down, Shellhead,” Steve rolls his eyes as he flings himself at Tony, dumping his water gun to wrap his arms around him. “Youd’a done the same thing and you know it.”
There’s a faint snickering coming from the corner of the room, but Tony doesn’t even bother looking away from the most beautiful human being he’s ever seen. Even sitting down, Tony can tell that the man is easily six feet plus, with broad, muscled shoulders he suddenly wants to run his mouth over.
. This is just-- this is somethin’ else, Rogers.”
Why does his body hurt?
“This is…”
Between their classrooms is a door that stands at the back of Tony’s and opens right next to the other room’s whiteboard, and thank god for the glass window that takes up the top half of the door— the one that neither of them has tried to cover— because nothing makes his day better than catching a glimpse of those shoulders.
All three of them straighten their back just a little bit. “Mr. Coulson.”
“Nah, I’ll just enjoy the view. I think I’ve earned it,” Tony waggles his eyebrows playfully.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Okay, dial it back on the hysterics, Rogers--”
“No such thing as a normal sleeping schedule for me, Capsicle,” he says. “You’ll get used to it.”
- - - - -
-- lips brushing Steve’s with every word.
“Yeah,” is all Steve says. “Wouldn’t matter if they didn’t, though. You’re the one I wanna do this with.”
Tony tosses his controller aside, glaring at the confetti flying all around on the screen in front of them. “Shoulda known you’d end up like this,” he huffs, but doesn’t struggle when the blond reaches out to pull him close.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Always spoiling for a fight, aren’t you, Cap?”
“Obviously he was wrong about that, huh?”
- - - - -
“Yeah,” he says without thinking, but then Steve gasps and–
“Almost as much as I like you, Shellhead.”
“Do you wanna see ‘em?” Steve says, but when he starts to sit up, Tony’s quick to pull him down.
“You’re welcome. I know it’s... it’s probably not much, but--”
“Please,” Steve reminds her with a nudge.
“Not even close. We’ve got a pretty great defense.”
Tony looks down at the cookies, and then sneaks a glance over at him. “I just… want her to, uh. Y’know…”
Tony grins. “To be fair, I alway wanna get you out of your clothes.”
“I’ll treat you to some hot chocolate if you do.”
From the corner of his eye, he sees Bucky and Sam bump fists, but the relief he feels in his chest almost drowns out everything else. “
“You wish. You two deserve each other,” he says, and when the curve of Tony’s lips turns up into a tiny, hopeful smile, Bucky welcomes the happy warmth that blooms in his chest.
“God knows why,” Steve mutters, but his hand is soft in Tony’s as they leave the room. And if it lingers a second or two longer than usual, well, nobody’s complaining.
“Tony.”
Steve closes his eyes, resting his hand on his husband’s chest, “I love you, sweetheart.”
“I sure hope so, handsome,” Tony replies, and revels in the warm of Steve’s skin as it touches his.
“...we’re having a Christmas party?” Tony asks.
“I’m sorry too,” Steve stands up, shoulders hunched in trepidation. “Look, I know it might not mean anythin’--”
“I’m sorry?”
“Aren’t you supposed to be in Physics right now?” Steve asks, but he’s smiling back at him, and Tony just leans his chair back until his head meets his best friend’s stomach.
“You cannot be serious,” Steve jumps up, eyes suddenly blazing with fury. “Tell me you don’t mean that.”
“But the fact remains-- oh, hold on a sec,” she presses a hand to the bluetooth.  “Chris? No, we’re still here. Yes, all of us...”
“Well that’s a relief. Thanks for the help, Avengers!” Steve grins, herding their little group into the kitchen with a victorious smile.
Tony meets Steve’s eye, and smirks. “Still on the leash, baby. Don’t see why we had to get up at the crack of dawn to walk him, though.”
,” Tony insists, almost stumbling over the weight of the blond as they walk towards the rest of the team.
“No, no, you’re okay, I hope,” the man whispers, and Tony wants to ask him if he’s sure he’s not an angel because even in the pain and haziness he’s in, Tony’s definitely conscious enough to just
you. Future you– put security measures in place in case it ever happened again. It hasn’t even been two hours, here.”
“I hadn’t even finished my glass yet--”
Warnings: NONE.
“I told you,” Steve says. “Stubborn.”
“Anytime, Spangles.”
But Steve thinks it’s high time for his genius to learn a lesson or two.
“I’d tell him that you gave me a
Tony glares at Steve, and in one lightning quick move, reaches out to snatch the tiny black box from his boyfriend’s trembling hand. “Good luck finding it again!”
- - - - -
Well, that and Steve’s smile.
“This is Tony,” Pepper announces, and oh, right. Her brother, Steve remembers.
“So you decided to paint the kitchen with the food instead? I was gone for less than a minute!”
“I’ll keep you warm,” he says, mouth brushing Tony’s temple with every word.
Every time Tony’s over at his apartment, Steve doesn’t bother hiding any of the sketchbooks scattered around the place, and there’s an easel propped up by the window that’s definitely seen its share of use. And it’s the moments that Steve shows him his art that Tony likes the best-- the man’s got talent in
Stony Christmas prompt #4: "It was supposed to be your present!”
“Not good? Should I stick to ‘Cappy bear’?”
“So, uh,” Tony rasps. “That– that was kind of a heavy talk for a honeymoon, cupcake.”
“I know you’re a fucking idiot,” he says, his voice as bored and careless as he can make it, “but clearly you’re dumber than I thought if you can’t tell where your seat is.”
“You’re a fucking idiot, Jesus Christ,” Barnes sighs, just as Steve steps in front of Clint’s drawn bow.
“Hey, Steve,” Pepper waves over Tony’s shoulder. Rhodey’s grin is knowing all over again, but Tony ignores him to turn and meet Steve’s eyes.
“I’m on the naughty list this year for sure.”
“What?”
…Next question, please.
Warnings: NONE.
“Merry Christmas,” Steve responds, and revels in the peace that fills his lungs when he feels Tony’s hand find his.
Tony looks over at his Captain. “He got that from you, y’know.”
!” Pepper hisses, hair flying out behind her as she whips around to glare at him. “Speak a little louder, why don’t you.”
“Can I ask you something?” he asks.
-- and other times, it’ll be a story about the one time when
He doesn’t, however, hold back the curse he half mumbles into his pillow. “How’d you get in here?”
“You know exactly what they ‘get up to over there’,” Pepper says, rolling her eyes even as she stands from her desk and picks up her purse from her coatrack. The files on her table, not for the first time that day, suddenly don’t seem as compelling as they’d been before.
Natasha eyes him skeptically, green eyes soft and more than a little groggy from sleep. “Nap?”
Steve feels a wicked grin settle on his face. “Let me remind you, then,” he growls, and pulls his husband in again.
“Said she wanted to give me a turn for my birthday.”
“Takes one to know one, right?”
His breathing is slow and deep-- the way it always is, the way Tony always wants it to be-- but it’s also louder, and certainly more nasally than it has any business being. It’s not long before Tony abandons the movie and lets his eyes rest on a far more beautiful sight.
The man barely takes a step inside-- and even with his heart currently attempting to beat it’s way out of his chest from the adrenaline, Tony feels his breath hitching even further at the sight of the tall, blond Adonis that greets him-- before Tony all but yells, “I swear I’m not a burglar, but you’re kind of an idiot for leaving your doors and windows open.”
“Worry about that later, alright?” Sharon says, as the truck doors open and Tony is wheeled out. “And you,” she lowers her voice and points at Steve, “don’t let him get away.” A breathy
“Five minutes,” he kisses Tony’s temple, and leaves the room.
“I’m checking up on my residents, Red.”
“I will. Still want to find out if I can shake you all night long?”
“I don’t rummage, Tony-- they’re socks! I go in there every day!”
“Body heat’s important, big guy. Gotta keep it for as long as possible.”
“But it’s… you know it’s the best one.”
“Because your mom loves me.”
The ride up to Steve’s floor feels longer than usual, and Tony spends every moment trying to quell down the surge of irrational panic.
“Pleasure’s all mine, believe me.”
“Never thought of him as a crybaby,” Stone says lazily, leaning on Brock’s meaty shoulder as he rises to his feet. “But I guess now that Mommy dearest is gone–”
“Both.”
Which is probably the only reason he doesn’t fall apart the second they enter the room and meet bright green eyes.
Summer of Stony prompt #3: “Let’s get out of here.”
“You’ve already been there,” Tony says. “I remember SHIELD freaking the fuck out the entire time.”
"No you don’t."
“‘Course I would,” he whispers. “We make a kick-ass team.”
It doesn’t help that Bucky still talks about Pepper every day, only now he starts to mention how Tony’s been dropping her off a lot more these days, and how he’s always nice to Bucky when he sees him. He tells Steve about the
“You sure
“Yeah,” Tony says, breathless as he so often is when it comes to this man.
“Tony?”
"Jesus..." Tony whispers.
Tony closes his eyes, and breathes it in. “I think you’re doing just fine.”
“Ma’am,” Steve nods, stepping out from behind Tony to hold out his hand, as steady as the look in his eyes.
“Not yet,” Steve smiles, and Tony can’t help leaning in to kiss him again.
Steve just runs a hand through his hair, and Tony breathes through the pang of longing. “I can’t wait to wrap my arms around you and keep you in bed for days.”
“Yeah,
Tony blinks back the stinging in his eyes, and smiles through the wave of fear that runs through him. “Guess there’s no point in putting it off, huh?”
“Obviously,” Tony grins, with more aplomb than he feels. “Your mom loves me.”
Tony can only nod, helpless to the keep his eyes from stinging.
“What’re ya talkin’ about-- you’re gorgeous.”
“Bruce, toss me yours! Nat, you too-- oh my god, send a pic to Rhodes, I’m-- hey, where’s Cap’s and Stark’s? Barnes, check under the couch...”
“Papa,” Bella sobs, rubbing tiny fists against her eyes. “Papa, dun f-feel well–”
Oh Christ, he looked fucking mind-boggled the first time he tried it.
“What the hell were you thinking?”
“Oh god,” he grunts, desire rushing through him like lightning. “Steve, hon, let’s–”
“Don’t do that.”
“At least we’re not
“You’d never know, with abs like those,” Tony pokes Steve’s stomach. “You’re literally unfair, y’know.”
Prompt: "I run the night slot on campus radio and some jackass keeps calling in to insult my music taste and request high school musical songs instead."
“Probably,” Tony chuckles, and Steve turns to face him just in time to see the gleam in his eyes turn wicked. “But can you blame them, gorgeous? You’re fucking unreal.”
“Are you okay with us watchin’? Did he even ask? I don’t… the last thing we want is for you to feel uncomfortable. I can go catch him and tell him–”
“You wanna join ‘em?” Tony asks.

“Yes sir. Sorry, sir.”
How is she just seeing it?
“How is that good news?” Steve asks.
“Don’t be smug, you ass,” Tony growls at him.
“Please, I’ll make it up to you, Pep, I swear-- I’ll buy you an island, or a cat--”
idea."
“Really?”
“Nope, no,” Tony shakes his head. “Don’t ruin the moment, Rogers. Let me enjoy this.”
“Th-thanks,” Steve stammers, cheeks flaming at the fondness in those brown eyes, and the faint scent of strawberry on Tony’s breath as he pulls away.
“I’ll find you a good one,” Steve says.
Steve shakes his head as he jumps up from his chair, and really, Tony thinks, no one should look so gorgeous with such a ridiculously giddy grin. “Okay, we’re gonna-- it’s... three o’clock, we can leave in an hour, do you need help packing? I can help--”
said it’s not all my fault, Tony.”
did he close them?– she’s gone.
“I’m sorry I punched you in the face.”
“Please,” Steve pleads, “I’m the one who hit him, I feel so horrible.”
“Not as smart as you.”
“Tony, you almost
Tony feels an unexpected rush of fondness at all the mumbling because, really, it shouldn't be as attractive as it is.
The sun’s gone down by the time they all leave the hospital, and now that Tony’s walking all by himself-- he’s so proud-- he can finally appreciate just how tall Steve is.
“Shit, I could
,” Natasha hisses.
“I should be down there, but I can’t...” Steve shakes his head. “I just n-need a-- a minute... I’m sorry--”
“I know!” Tony cuts him off loudly, but the gleam of amusement in his eyes tells Steve he’s not as bothered as he sounds. “Stand down, soldier.”
Steve rolls his eyes even as Tony can see his cheeks grow even warmer. “You ready? I’ll stand still, if it helps.”
“I would’ve done it gladly, I can do it now, I’m already in your bed--”
Well I wouldn’t know, now, would I?
“Shut up!” Tony growls. “I swear to God, if you don’t tell me what you were doing out there--”
“He got assigned to me, but Mrs. Parker just freaked out during her MRI, so I need to go calm her down.”
“Yeah? That’s the word around town.”
There’s a muffled voice coming from the other end, along with a rustle of papers, before Steve speaks again. “
March Prompt #24: “I am so lucky to love you.”
“Uh huh,” she nods, and holds up her finished product shyly. It’s covered in every shade of pink he owns, and although the skill is obviously child’s-level, it’s also very carefully made; every pink border and heart sticks on the card with little traces of glue peeking out.
“Yeah?”
“I’m not kidding.”
HAPPY NEW YEARS, EVERYONE! :D Thank you for making this year so wonderful for me! <3<3<3
“Nope, not right now,” Tony tuts, curling further into him. “I’m freezing my ass off, and you’re just about the warmest thing in here.”
“Yeah?”
"Why is all my furniture on the roof?”
"Objection! Mommies can be tall and big too," Tony points out gently; their team, as always, just barrels on.

“We’ve got a new owner’s checklist at the counter,” Steve tells him. “Ask my friend Bucky, he’ll help you out.”
“Hey, Cap,” Tony grins again, “I know you’re twenty-six going on ninety, but you don’t have to walk around like it. We’ve only been waiting
Margaret Carter Elementary School is a bustle of parents and children when Happy pulls up to the curb, and as Peter’s hand holds tightly onto Tony’s, Tony knows he’s not the only one feeling uncharacteristically hesitant. His son’s eyes are wide as he looks around his surroundings and the other children being dropped off, but he keeps pace with Tony as they make their way through the thinning crowds to room 3A.
“Didn’t think you felt that way about me.”
“I can’t believe you talked me into this.”
“Natasha?” Bruce asks softly, as concerned as the concerned looks Steve and Tony turn her way. “You okay?”
,” she says, “
“I’m so sorry.”
“G’tta call Pep,” he tells them. “Don’t know any’a my info.”
“What the fuck is that?” he blurts, feeling his heart skip a beat when Steve starts laughing.
“Tony, what’s wrong, what is it? Tony, hey…”
“You love me anyway.”
Even now, he still doesn't know how it happened, but one moment they're finishing up the latest battle with Doom-- without Iron Man, no less-- and the next moment, Clint’s losing his shit because
Tony looks over the blond's shoulder to peek at his pet. “Jarvis jumped in again.”
"No."
Tony doesn’t even know how he ends up with the stupid thing.
The blonde comes back to with a jerk, and then takes a deep breath, squaring her shoulder. “I’m from the future–”
“I can’t just do that, Buck,” he says, and turns away to hide his blush at the thought of Tony’s face if he did.
“Well, no matter what happens today, at least we have that, right?”
“I thought I told you to zip it,” he says.
“Fine,” is all she says, chuckling as she unclips the cord in front of the line, and Steve doesn’t even have time to take a deep, readying breath before Tony’s suddenly right there in front of him.
Steve’s cheeks flush yet again. “Yeah, I-- I feel awful about it.”
Tony sighs, but looks back down at his work. “What do you want, Ty?”
“I think I needed that,”Tony mumble. “I needed… God, I just needed to come home.” His voice breaks on the last word, and just like that, the silence sobers up again.
“Thank you,” Steve replies.
“And Thor!” Rhodey adds, swinging his sister up into his arms. “And Loki. Who told Barnes.”
“So fucking smug,
“Daddy, look! Cat, cat, cat, cat! Cat, cat, cat,” she sings, golden curls bouncing with every excited step she takes. The sight warms Steve’s heart like few things ever have, and when he sneaks a glance at his husband, the bright, happy look in his eyes tells Steve he feels the same too.
“No, she’s not, because that’d be crazy–”
“Sorry, didn’t mean to spring things on you-- I know I fucking hate it when they do it to me,” he smiles, ignoring the glares he gets from other parents at his language.
“Ready for the next group?”
“Alright,” Steve announces, rising from his seat without breaking his hold on Barnes. There’s a determined set to his jaw that Tony knows all too well, and he mentally bids goodbye to any work for the next couple of days. “Permission to return to the tower, sir?”
“Yeah, okay, look, if you’re just going to stand there all,” he waves his hand around vaguely, “scary hot, I’m gonna have to take a rain check. I have things to do, and like I said, I’m not looking forward to Pep tearing me a new one. I was having such a good day—”
“Jesus,” Bucky swears, but Tony can barely hear him-- Steve’s a pretty fucking
“Does everything have to be sexy?” Steve asks, but he can’t stop blushing, and Tony’s eyes really are so much more beautiful when he’s smiling, all bright and crinkled at the corners.
“Doesn’t matter, since we’ll be having Indian,” Tony smirks, chest warm with contentment.
“Well, I like
“And with that, you can go get dolled up while I put Red down and really get this party started. You hungry?”
get a card? What do the people who did all the work get, hmm?”
Tony nods. “Not gonna work, though. We’re staying here if I have to tie you to the bed-- and not in the fun way,” he adds, wrapping his arms and legs around as much of Steve as he can.
“Why not?”
(He never told Pepper that. But he knows he’s never had to, because now she spends at least half of every lunch they meet up for telling him how good he looks, and he spends the other half rolling his eyes and telling her to stop stating the obvious.)
Tony’s cheeks flush evens as he scoffs. “Not everyone
“Where are you?” Steve asks, already walking to the door. “Tony, tell me where you are, I’m already on my way--”
.” He vaguely registers Rhodey bumping into him softly from behind, barely remembers how to breathe when he turns the aisle and catches sight of the most beautiful human being he’s ever seen.
Tony feels his lips quirk up into a smile. “You’re going to spoil me, gorgeous.”
"We can always just blow them off and, y’know..." Tony leers, sneaking a hand down past Steve's belt and relishing the gorgeous blush his actions produce.
From the corner of his eye, he spots Natasha’s red curls, and the glint of Barnes’ metal arm as he stands beside the glass windows, but everything falls away the moment he sees Steve.
“Papa?”
Obviously.
“Do you?”
Steve bumps his shoulder against Tony’s. “Walked right into that one, didn’t I?”
“Point is, though,” he says a moment later, and pretends he doesn’t hear Steve’s sigh. “I weigh a hell of a lot more than our TV.”
“Your accomplices?” Tony asks, but Steve just rolls his eyes.
“I like you with a little gray,” Steve reaches up to trace Tony’s temples with two fingers, his touch as soft as the gleam in his eyes is fond.
Natasha’s lips quirk up into something that could almost be half a smile. “We’re actually fourth in the district.”
So the doubts start coming; Steve tries to remember if he did something wrong, if he stopped paying attention to Tony or stopped reminding him that Steve loves him more than he’s ever loved anyone. But he can’t come up with anything, and that’s when he starts to wonder if maybe it’s not something he did.
“Asshole.”
Steve looks up from the sinkful of dishes at Tony’s question, and finds him staring down at the cards spread out on the kitchen island. “I really didn’t. What, you don’t believe me?”
He lasts about two weeks of torture before he breaks, and goes to find Rhodey.
———————–
“-- or if you even wear any--”
He ends up playing half the album for the next hour, because even though Tony only requests one song, they get six more callers requesting the rest of them.
“I know it.”
Half the class breaks into knowing whispers, and the other look his way with thinly veiled curiosity, but then they all go silent when Mr. Rogers appears at the window. He’s already grinning, and even though his eyes are quick to meet Tony’s, he still makes a show of swiping the note above the old one, tapping the glass, and walking away.
"We took th' bastard's chair."
"Tony," Steve sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose, and he's still hunched at the edge of the bed.
“You’re going to do it,” Barnes continues, voice rising to drown out Tony’s words, “because it took Sam, Thor, Barton, and Rhodes– all of them– to hold him down after you ran off. You’re going to do it because none of us can take any more of seeing you and Steve act like the sun shines out of each of your asses. You’re going to do it because you are a lot of things, but a coward ain’t one of ‘em.”
“I call Stone,” Sam nods purposefully, and returns Clint’s fist bump with a feral grin.
“Sounds like you’re, uh... having a nice time.”
,” Tony laughs, finally digging through a drawer for his pajama pants. “And I didn’t hear you complaining a single minute of it.”
“Bet you’d taste sweeter.”
“No worries,” he waves his hand around casually. “Least I could do.”
Steve frowns adorably. “No, there’s no way you’re finished.”
“It’s like you’ve forgotten who you’re friends with.”
“No,” Tony replies truthfully, and doesn’t pull away. “But I’m done just standing around.”
"Of the icing part?"
,” Tony breathes, and Steve lets out a shaky, breathy laugh that somehow seems to fill the room.
Prompt: "The avengers find videos that end up being Tony's home videos from when he was young and in one of them it's young Tony playing with a cap toy or just having fun and then Howard yells at him."
Steve's pretty sure he's still blushing something fierce, but he tries not to let any more of his arousal show. "Alright," he whispers, and Tony turns half lidded eyes back up to him.
“Buck–”
“Not right now, you’re not.”
He walks the short distance to their daughter’s room, expecting to hear her energetic little chatter as she picks out her clothes for the day. So when he’s greeted with the sight of Bella still lying in bed, covers pulled all the way up until only the tip of her little blond head is showing, he frowns in concern.
“Fuck you,” Tony hisses, and pushes Hammer off his desk with trembling hands. He sinks into his seat and stares at the empty whiteboard ahead, willing the burning in his eyes away. Dimly, he hears whispers and more laughter, but then they fade as the crowd dissipates. He takes a breath to compose himself, and squares his shoulders when he hears Howard’s cold, hard voice in his head:
“Don’t apologize, honey bunny. Now tuck those gorgeous arms back under the covers and go the fuck to sleep, okay?”
“Crisis averted, Captain,” Tony gives a jaunty salute, only to fall quiet a second later. “I, uh-- I did something like this once. I remember.”
“JARVIS, don’t you dare–”
“Tony says his paintings look like crap,” she giggles, and the old man-- maybe he’s this Tony, or her dad?-- clears his throat.
Steve flushes all the way down to his neck but doesn’t look away. “Tiramisu from Bertinelli’s.”
“Nothing is ‘just’ anything with celebrities, big guy.”
Tony grins. “Uh huh. And I’d sell it, too-- ‘m a great actor.”
Tony doesn’t say a word as Clint leaves the room, muttering as he goes, but looks up when Sam pats his shoulder as he follows.
kind of sense.”
thinking voice.
“No, I-- hey, I do, yeah, sure. It’s-- it’s... cute,” he stammers, pressing his fluffy gift to his chest, and breathes in relief when Steve’s eyes suddenly brighten in happiness.
Stony Christmas prompt #17: "I'm asking you to stay."
“Don’t even think about it,” Steve says, and Tony feels so dizzy with relief, it’s almost pathetic. “Whenever you want, just let me know and I’m with you. Hear me? I’m with you, Tony.”
“That’s the plan, ain’t it?” Steve says quietly, shy and hesitant all of a sudden. “You and me, forever?”
“He’s lyin’,” Steve points to Clint. “You’re not s’pposed t’be naughty! Ma said y’should be good
“What about your Mom--”
Steve’s voice as he says goodbye follows him long after they’ve lost sight of each other, but Tony’s not even a block away before his phone dings in his hand.
"No, I’m... Shit," Tony breathes, but Rhodey holds up his hand.
“Ass.”
“Well, that’s-- that’s...not the point. I’m not gonna keep a fucking cat.”
“I’m going to fucking kill him.”
“I didn’t know what that felt like,” Tony says softly. “Until I met you. I don’t give a damn what our place looks like– okay, no, wait, I do. Kind of. I’m not particular about it, but it matters. A little. But baby, I would stick with you even if we lived in a shit hole in Hell’s Kitchen. If all we had was each other, I’d still be the luckiest son of a bitch alive, ‘cause wherever you are? You bet your sweet ass I’m gonna be right there with ya. You’re my home.”
Steve wraps his arms around him-- like he did the night of their promise, like he’s done countless times since they were six-- and twirls him around as everyone crows and whoops and cheers their congratulations.
Steve’s laughing so hard he can’t say anything in response, and Tony’s gonna need to learn how to calm his heart because Jesus Christ, this man is going to kill him.
“Tony?”
“What about ‘em?” Tony asks, glancing down to look at them just as Steve replies.
“God bless those All-American genes.”
“Shut up,” Tony grumbles, even as his eyes are drawn back to what he’s been trying to ignore all lunch. Fucking Steve and his fucking gorgeous smile…
Steve nods. “I know you’ve had a long day at work, so...”
Three weeks after the first time, Steve finally breaks.
“Oh.”
“Don’t wear out my name, big guy.”
“Charmer,” Steve sighs. “Still your fault.”
“Can I take you out sometime, then?” Tony smiles. “When you’ve got a free day and I’m not half dead?”
“I’m kidding,” he says, holding the blond’s eyes until he sees them go bright again. “I’ve got money coming out of my ass--”
“But he also said Captain America would be disappointed in me.”
“Only when I see something I want.”
"I can do that," he nods, moving around the kitchen island and into Steve's welcoming arms. "What'll this get me?" He reaches up on his tiptoes to peck Steve's jaw.
“Because I’ve always wanted to do it?” Steve’s smile is smug but genuine, and bright as the fucking sun.
“Not my boyfriend,” Tony raises an eyebrow pointedly, and just like that, Steve feels the rush of heat that’s so familiar when Tony’s involved.
... going dark for God knows how long.
But he’s enjoying this sort of anonymity more than he probably should, even though Tony doesn’t hold back on mocking Steve’s enthusiasm for big band records. He’s not bothered by anything Tony says, and there’s always something fond and playful in his voice when he talks to Steve.
“She doesn’t need to,” Steve chuckles, and leans over to brush a slow, lazy kiss to his husband’s lips. “But you’re perfect, anyhow.”
“Total
Slow and warm, it comes, and Steve feels it brush his skin with every sway of the hammock.
Tony shakes his head. “Steve…” he breathes the name, and closes his eyes when they start burning– partly out of shame, but mostly because he’s
“Tony–”
“To what? You haven’t asked me anything yet,” Steve says, and god, he knows this is absolutely crazy– he’s on duty, they’ve barely met, and he’s never done something like this before. But Tony’s eyes are awfully beautiful, and the feeling in Steve’s chest every time he sees them is as warm as it is unfamiliar.
“Tony Stark, I’ve been yours from the second we screamed out insults at each other in that Hellicarrier, and I’m gonna be yours till my dying breath. But in the meantime, I’m kinda hopin’ you’ll say yes.”
But now, Tony thinks his heart might be breaking as he hears Steve’s broken plea, as he feels those warm, gentle hands gripping his own. He inches closer to the blond until their foreheads touch. “If you think I’d actually leave you right now,” he says, his own voice rough and shaky. “You’re so fucking wrong. You-- God, Steve, you don’t even have to ask.”
“Yours!” He hears Rhodey say, right before they disappear into the throng of people on the dance floor.
Steve nods, and catches Thor’s eyes widening from across the island as the others hide their giggles into their lunch.
“So... when’s bath time?”
“Well, you got us, you charmer.”
“Hi.”
“Uh huh,” Tony nods. “Yummy grub, whaddya say?”
March Prompt #31: “I’m in this for life.”
“Ten hours!” Their daughter squeals, lifting her head up to face Tony with large, familiarly blue eyes, and Tony’s heart gives a happy lurch when Steve leans over to kiss her cheek with a laugh.
“Sorry, hon,” he says, closing the space between them to give Steve’s chin a lazy peck. “Y’were saying…”
“I’ll keep a look out,” he assures Tony, but the next half hour is still spent in a permanent state of dread– for the memories to strike back with a vengeance, for his bones to finally give up on him, for someone to come find him and tell him it’s all over.
“I’m asking you,
“Egg?”
“Fucking SHIELD," Stark mutters, but takes his suit jacket off and throws it on the couch next to Bucky. "Alright, Cap-- up you go."
“‘s j-just like th’ ice.”
“Steve?” is the only thing he says.
“Wait, hold on, let me just…” Tony reaches to his back pocket and pulls out his phone, holding it out in front of him as he grins. “Say cheese!”
“Doesn’t seem very nice to name a robot Dummy.”
” There’s the sound of a scrambling hands, and then a dark lock of hair comes into view, followed by the rest of his mother’s face as she turns the camera to her, and Tony can’t hold back the low, pathetic noise he makes from the back of this throat.
“I think I might,” Steve replies, tightening his arms almost imperceptibly. “But maybe...” he drawls, pulling back. “Maybe I can just... give you my number?”
He can’t believe he almost missed this.
Or breakfast.
“Remind me to send ‘em a thank you card.”
“Yeah?”
“Awesome,” Tony replies, just barely holding back the urge to coo at those wide baby blues. “Want to try?”
“Hardly. You deserve a hell of a lot more than this.”
“A little while.”
- - - - -
“Tony?”
,” Steve’s voice breaks on the last word, as soft as the hand that gently takes Tony’s. “So as far as I’m concerned, Tony Stark is so much more deserving than his father could ever be. Then I’d tell him he could shove all his bullshit right up his ass.”
“Tony?”
He wakes to those same fingers digging into his cheek.
“It’s Golden Oldies hour, Mr. Stark.”
Tony shakes his head, and when he looks up, Steve pretends he can’t see how his eyes are just the slightest bit wet. “Dinner on me?”
Tony’s eyes flit over to the painting before meeting bright blue ones again. “This is yours?” he asks, reaching out to return the greeting.
“You and Steve, Tony?”
“‘kay.”
Because a month passes, and then another, and Steve’s life quickly becomes a whirlwind of morning chats in his kitchen and late night talks in Tony’s. He meets Pepper and Natasha and Rhodey for a Saturday night dinner, and then brings Bucky, Clint and Sam over to meet Tony for brunch on Sunday.
Tony beamed. "You're very welcome."

"Mostly from the beard," Iron Man says. "And, I'm sad to say, the ass."

"His basement?

should be so lucky." He dusted his hands on his pants and ushered for Steve to fold up the ladder; he took it from him as he grinned up at his handiwork. Anyone coming into this room would be surprised by it. It was an excellent placement. When he glanced across at Steve to gloat at how great this idea was, Steve was frowning. Captain Killjoy, Tony thought, carrying the ladder back over the tree so he could hang the higher ornaments more easily.
"You can understand things and they can still suck," Tony said, magnanimously swallowing back the impulse he had to tag

Tony thought those words on their own would be enough to end him, but then Steve added, in a soft and tender whisper, "Shell-head,
"You said that—" Steve started, struggling to keep his voice even because his eyes were stinging. The truth hurt, but not in the way Tony was probably dreading. The words he had said before implied Tony was expecting
"I don't know what to do anymore." Steve shook his head, staring down at Tony's body. "Why won't you wake up?"
"No. It’s a deduction. I’ve seen how slowly you recover from some hits. You get bashed up in that tin can of yours. Has to be hell on the human beneath the armor. You always disappear into the mansion after a mission, and I’ve been on every floor of the mansion but the third sub-basement, where you’ve said he stores the submarine. So, unless Mr. Stark has a hospital somehow squeezed into the space—"
Steve's eyes felt hot. He'd just been angry, that was all, that Tony had dragged them all into this war. It didn't have to be that way. Tony should have just—
Steve clapped his hands together and headed to the fridge, pulling out a water carafe. He shot Tony an amused look over his shoulder as he effortlessly poured himself a glass of water without looking. "Was it supposed to be a secret? Same eyes, same height, same build?"
Besides, Tony's misunderstanding had caused the desired outcome, even if Steve regretted the cost.
"A cheese board?" Happy suggested, after a long pause.

"But on the plus side, no lions," Steve says.

Tony beams. "It's important not to lose who we really are. I know that now."
"Spring," Tony agrees.
Steve turned on his heel and stared. There was a whole town behind him. It looked like a movie set. Steve was already half-expecting Clint Eastwood to stride out of one of the wooden buildings, a gun on his hip, a golden star glinting on his chest.
"Disappointed?"
″Best I can do,″ Steve said when he was done, lowering himself back down with a wince. The squelching noise as he did so was not encouraging.

look Steve in the eye, his blue eyes shining with a different kind of pain. One Steve felt the echo of. It was different to the pain of being physically impaled, but it felt like being stabbed through regardless.

"Sort of," Iron Man says.
Steve looks over at the Tony-shaped lump on the bed. Day 542. Day 30 without a moving, speaking Tony. Steve's itching to implode, or maybe to lie beside Tony and become a statue next to him. The Avengers could find them. They'd be trying to find them, surely? He pictures the Avengers breaking into this impossible room and finding Steve and Tony on the bed. Paperweight humans. Broken pieces that just

Tony blinked that thought away. It was a dangerous line of thinking. "Jan's easy to buy for," Tony said, realizing that he needed to give Steve an answer. He'd been hoping to get Jan for the Secret Santa himself, because he knew what to get her in a heartbeat.
There was something dabbing at his face and Tony tried to open his eyes again and—

″I'm saner than you.″
Of course Pepper would ignore Tony's "no interruptions" mandate for Captain America.

"Ha." Steve's exhaled laugh was bitter. He wasn't amused by that, but then, neither was Tony, that their dynamic would be boiled down to something that didn't feel true.
"Ehh, this and that," Tony takes a deep drag from his mug. "The thing keeping me up tonight shouldn't even be that difficult, I'm just distracted."
I should have picked up on that!"
Steve wouldn't let Tony stay.
big tumble," the man laughed. "Must have hit your head there. Must have been a mighty big spell to do that to you."
There's no alcohol in the room. Steve keeps count of all the patterns they've tried and he counts the number of days they've been there, but he doesn't count the number of times he's been grateful that Tony hasn't had to face that particular temptation on top of everything else.
He knew he had to. This was important. This felt important. This moment felt the same way as it had the first time Tony put his armor on to save people. Fundamental. Everything was about to change again and Tony couldn't proceed on damaged foundations.
Steve let out a quiet sigh of relief beside him. “That’s the best thing you’ve said all day.”
“Uh… Bruce, I um… I think we’d better go out into the hall.” Tony said to his friend, who didn’t like the tone of Tony’s voice one little bit.
“Hold on!” Tony warned, as he changed gear to the highest it would go.
Minutes later Tony was staggering out of the helicopter and fell onto his knees on the nearest patch of grass, throwing up his food. “Fuck.” He groaned, accepting a bottle of water from Danny who came out of nowhere. “Thanks, Rand.”
Peter smiled in relief as he walked over to the two jeeps that were parked inside the room, which had obviously been a garage at some point. The vehicles were almost identical to the ones they’d been travelling in on the ride earlier, minus the roof and the bright, ridiculous dinosaurs painted on the side. Peter didn’t waste any time in checking one out, finding the lock on the bonnet and popping it open.
Tony felt his heart swell at the words, and couldn’t help but smirk a little. “You were worried about little, old me?”
“You guys alright?” Logan came rushing back over, the other workers in tow. “That was a bloody close one!”
That must have done it, as the next thing they knew the sound of the vehicle didn’t sound like it was getting further away, but closer. Within seconds Tony and Steve came to an abrupt halt as a jeep sped down the path right in front of them, coming to a standstill beside them, Peter and Wade looking over at them in surprise.
“Okay, fine!” he said, as Peter punched the air in victory and Steve didn’t look too certain about it. Wade, well, he was looking like he was about to throw up. “You can tag along, but you
.” She sounded disappointed even from that one word. “
Tony shared a smile with Steve as they followed the IT whiz, their hands slipping apart.
Wade frowned and thought hard. “How? I’d already be dead.”
“That all depends on what she’s made of.” Steve mumbled under his breath, sighing heavily as he walked to the back of the room.
“How do you know?” Tony whispered, feeling his own flesh shiver at the spooky atmosphere. “But that could be further down, we didn’t exactly pay much attention because I may have panicked a little.”
“Just start the damn car, Wilson!”
.” Thor said over the com.
Thor’s eyes widened, like a lightbulb had just gone off in his head. “Jesus, Tony, I’m so sorry!” he said quickly, putting a hand on the man’s shoulder. “No, no, Steve, he’s fine! He’s alright! A workers bringing him in as we speak.”
Loki instinctively pulled his knees up, wrapping his arms around his legs and tried to get as close to the bin as possible, as if that would camouflage him from the creatures in the sky. He watched in pure terror as one Pterodactyl after the other dived down into the crowd of people, jumping on top of women and children, lunging at people and biting into them, gripping them in their humongous claws and flinging them into the air.
Steve laughed lightly, making Tony’s smile widen at the sight. “They’re called Triceratops, Tony, and you were throwing the food at their mouth.”
“Are you seriously trying to ask me out, right now?”
“All I see is trees, dirt and some kind of weird looking rock.” Wade said. “That is one weird rock.”
“What’s going on?” Bruce asked quietly.
“Yeah.” Tony cut in, his eyes on the slightly large gap in the fence. “That’s the emergency exit we saw on the infrared earlier.”
.” Natasha heard Steve sigh before he turned his attention on her. “
Suddenly, all the colour in Tony’s face drained. The engineer gazed over at Steve who looked at the scientist with saddened eyes. Bruce didn’t know what had happened minutes ago, he didn’t even know that the Foniassaurus had escaped. He’d made sure that the only people who knew about everything were the ones at the scene, Shield, and the employers locked away in the control room. Tony’s heart sank once more.
“Fine,” Peter said with a shrug of the shoulders. “But you get to go first and be my shield.”
“PETER!” Tony yelled down the phone, making Steve jump away from the wall. “Jesus, Mary and Joseph, don’t you kids answer your God damn phones anymore? Not even Loki’s answering his phone and he’s glued to the damn thing!” he squealed, voice rising higher and higher with each word.
“Because Schmidt is a conniving, evil, little rat.”
Peter snorted. “No we can’t go pet it, Wade.”
“I…” Thor sighed, shaking his head. “They’re gone.”
(Just a quick reminder that my Tony is based off comic Tony, and he and Steve are the same height! Loki is young Loki also based off the comics. And my Spidey is Andrew Garfield because, well, he and Ryan Reynolds would have kicked ass together :P)
“Or maybe we can just get Peter’s boyfriend to scare them onto the boats.” He joked, finally starting to feel like there was some kind of plan coming together, before that red dot on the screen got any closer to a very large buffet.
Tony spun around in his chair, not really surprised when he came face to face with the leaders of Shield themselves. Natasha Murdock and Matt Murdock stood there looking grim, obviously they’d heard about what had gone down, and were there to put a stop to it.
about dinosaurs.”
“Tony.” Steve warned, earning a grin from the other man. He couldn’t help but smile back, although he shouldn’t have.
Tony’s car sped along the dirt road under the tall, swaying trees that stretched over like a hand grasping at the air. The wheels skidded against the mud, covering the vehicle in splodges of filth and grime, something Tony would be appalled at if he weren’t on his way to save his nephew and nephew’s other half from being eaten alive by a vicious dinosaur.
“Shit, sorry!” Tony called back, noticing what had happened.
“Tony?”
Peter didn’t have time to ask what Wade was talking about, as the next thing he knew the older man was taking his hand in his and urging him to run faster. As he looked ahead he saw the reason why, and his stomach dropped at the thought of what lay right in front of them. Straight up ahead there was an opening through the trees, light just about shining through, but what made it that tad bit scary was the fact that it was the end of a cliff and they could just about see the waterfall on the other side of it.
“Then get a move on, once Steve’s taken a look you can hop to it!”
Steve shrugged. “If she’s exploring I suppose she still would be, she’s new to this place so I’d say there’s a high chance. She’ll definitely see some other dinosaurs around so that might slow her down. Hopefully the electric fences will help a lot too.”
Thor stopped typing. “Please tell me it’s just the slushy machine again?”
Steve ran a hand through his hair, taking deep breaths as he felt his chest begin to pain. He couldn’t get over how close he’d been to becoming the Foniassaurus’s next prey, how easy it was for her to get to him, to anyone. How smart she’d been to lure them into her home, to trap them, to kill two of his friends. And now she was free, roaming the island like a wild animal, a creature that was born in captivity able to hunt whatever she came across. There were over twenty thousand people at the park, every single one of those lives were in danger.
Peter rolled his eyes. “Wade, they’re night vision goggles.” He said impatiently. “Now get them off and find me a key for the jeep!”
As Steve said this he reached out a hand, guardedly placing his hand on the other man’s hand that was anxiously tapping away on his thigh. Tony jumped a little at the sudden touch, taking a quick glance at Steve who smiled softly back, before he turned his hand around to entwine their fingers. Steve didn’t pull his hand away, and Tony was glad for it, because having his hand in his again just felt right and made him feel at ease within seconds.
“I feel left out here!” Tony joined in, aiming and firing. “Don’t I get a nickname?”
“But Anthony, you said…”
“It’s fine,” Tony began. “We’ll find them, I’m sure Thor’s still busy trying to get over twenty thousand people into one place.” he sighed, hoping beyond hope that the plan was going well.
“Right.” Peter droned, sharing a bewildered look with Wade. “So, um… what’s the plan?”
“Jesus fucking Christmas!” Wade wheezed, as Peter grabbed him and pushed him towards the embankment.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony agreed, noticing that Thor was already writing up a speech on his computer. “Carol could you ring the boats? Get every single one to come into the port for pickups.”
Tony wasted no time in putting a bullet in the creature’s head, and adding another two just encase. He felt himself shake from the adrenaline, and stared at the pool of blood that formed around the dead dinosaur, satisfied that it was in no way getting back up. He was soon snapped out of it when he heard a groan from behind him, quickly turning around to see Steve sit up and rub the back of his head.
"Yeah, you can have all the icing for that."
“I know, honey.” The word falls from his lips without thought, but Tony can’t focus on anything else but the stillness of the man next to him. “But we gotta keep moving, Steve, gotta stay warm,” he says, even as he feels his own body grow colder by the second.
Warnings: NONE.
, and Tony suddenly feels as though she’s looking right through him, as if she’s saying a million things without speaking a word.
“Clint, don’t be an ass,” Steve says calmly, but Tony doesn’t miss the faint blush on his cheeks. “And you,” he pulls Tony’s sleeve, “sit back down before they throw us out again–”
His eyes are wild and bright, and the only reason Steve’s heart isn’t breaking is because behind the veil of terror in those brown depths, he’s pretty sure he sees something like hope. “Tony--”
“It’s okay,” he shakes his head. “I’m– I’m not jealous.”
“I love you too.”
“Didn’t think you needed it.”
He needs Pepper.
Baby Tony shakes his head. “
"No regrets, though, right?" Steve asks.
By the time Coulson enters the room with a sleek, red metal briefcase, Tony’s lost count of how many time’s he’s found himself staring unashamedly. Steve’s not much better, to be honest, but their daughter just seems to drink all the attention up happily, even if she doesn’t say anything else about herself.
“After all of that,” the blond continues, “you changed. It’s no secret that you’re set on helping as many people as you can; your company, and your charities, everything… You’ve already done so much. And I remembered your name— my godfather, Abraham Erskine? He, uh, mentioned meeting you once or twice. I’m hoping you can help—”
March Prompt #23: “I can’t lose you.”
“What?”
Barnes shakes his head as he sips his beer. “You’re ridiculous, punk,” he says, and then laughs when Steve flips him off without lifting his head.
CHAPTER 100!! *throws confetti at everyone* :') I just wanted to say a quick thank you to all of you guys, for all the hits and the kudos and the comments. It means a lot to me, and ILY ALL! :D
“Second top!”
Steve just finds Tony’s hand, and intertwines their fingers. “I’d rather just do this.”
“Yes, sir!”
“The point remains,” Tony mumbles, pausing to stretch like a cat and then flopping over on top of the blond, “that you’re not making sense, dew drop.”
“Wike Dummy?”
Tony smiles, and kisses him under the stars.
Steve’s eyes snap up to his, bright with hope and sincerity. “Yeah.”
Tony’s heart skips a beat. “What?”
cute.”
“That so?”
“I don’t mind,” Blondie shrugs. “It’s up to them. And to be honest, after the last girl tried to grope me... well, I’m looking forward to going home just a little bit more.”
The scent of
had grime.
Tony looks up from the sight of their intertwined hands lying atop the soft, white duvet cover. The rain’s kept its steady rhythm outside the cottage, but the sky has turned considerably darker, and Tony knows it’s been hours since they’ve done anything but lie in bed and hold each other. He can’t remember the last time they had a chance to do this, and he’s determined to not let it go to waste.
Because this is still his Steve-- the beautiful, stubborn, sarcastic love of Tony’s life-- but now he’s adorable and affectionate, and free in a way that Tony doesn’t think the blond lets himself be. He decides not to think about that bit too much, as he settles further down on the couch with his blond charge lying atop his chest.
“Okay, fine... I’d have shot you too, you meatball,” Tony grumbles, even as his smile grows to match Steve’s.
“Rhodey,” Tony grits, just as Rhodey pulls him into the elevator. “Jay, skip the common floor, take us all the way down–”
” Howard screams, and the screen trembles just as a whimper is heard.
“In the meantime, won’t you take care of yourself?”
Tony shakes his head. “I just…”
Steve can’t even meet his eyes when he pulls away. “Thanks.”
“Even when the world keeps spinning without me?” Steve whispers. “It’s so hard sometimes. Everything’s so loud, and fast, and bright. And I can’t keep up. I don’t know if I want to.”
“You’re a dork and I love you,” Steve whispers, leaning over the pile of their daughter’s gifts to press a quick kiss to Tony’s lips.
“I don’t know how to, I’m not... not cut out for this, but I just...” Tony shakes his head, and just closes his eyes when Steve leans in to press their foreheads together. “I just keep-- I keep thinking,
, Rhodey?"
There’s silence for a couple of seconds, and then–
“Jus’ m’head,” he says, and he’s trying to ignore the brooding man next to him, he really is. But that face...
That was a definite pass, guys. Congrats!
So when he wearily makes his way through the door of his suite at the end of the day, it takes him an embarrassingly long amount of time to register the familiar, mouthwatering scent of grilled meat wafting from the suite kitchen. He takes off his suit and tie, rolls up his sleeves, turns the corner--
Pepper looks down at the cover, and barely manages to keep from rolling her eyes. “Thank you, Daisy. I’m heading out for lunch,” she says, even though both of them know she’s not, “but can you go over right now, please, and tell them-- actually, remind them that I’m the CEO, and next time they want to tell me something, they should do it themselves instead of hiding behind their secretaries’ shoulders, no matter how broad and pretty they are?”
“How is he?”
“But just... just try to take it easy, okay?”
Steve’s grin is all teeth as he turns to the banker. “Ma’am?”
“Downstairs,” Tony nods. “So’s Nat and Barton, Sam, and Pep... they’re taking care of everything.”
“You’re a menace,” Steve sighs, but doesn’t pull away when the brunet lowers his head onto his shoulders. “I’m going to miss you, y’know…”
“--’n then I wen’ up t’him, an’...” he narrows his eyes as his lips thin into a menacing line. “He--”
Then Steve made the mistake of asking about
"I suppose."
It shouldn't feel so good, for something that was just kissing. Steve seemed content to hold him there and maul him with his mouth, and it felt so
"You know Mr. Stark really well, don't you?" Steve asks. "To know about him not having any food allergies, I mean."
allergies have to do with me giving flowers to Tony Stark?"
He was… invisible? Stuck outside his own body, somehow?
Tony opened his mouth to protest, but stumbled, a rush of something washing through him. When he looked up, Okoye and T'Challa were gone again. Dammit. And Steve – he had a beard now?
"Eh, just—the holidays, you know. Not always the best memories for Gabe. I wanted to give him a good time, but—I dunno what to do, he's been so down recently." Robbie shook his head. "I'll figure it out."
“I will lick every fucking apple slice, Stark.”
not you.”
” Steve chuckles, “
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “I love it, I want it, but I’m paying for it. And you’re taking my money; if not for you, then for your friends. Everyone. Don’t be stubborn, baby blue– Tony Stark always gets his way.”
Steve grinds his jaw. “That doesn’t make me feel better.”
“No, ask him in one of these sticky note thingies, it’ll be adorable!”
“Nonsense, then.”
,” he throws open the door, and thinks he might cry when he sees Steve grinning back, phone still pressed against his ear.
“How did you even–” Tony starts, then shakes his head at the unimpressed look he gets in return. “Never mind. I give up. What’d you find?”
“So, um,” Tony lets out a chuckle as bitter and fucked up as he is, “turns out... turns out dear ol’ dad really doesn’t like being reminded his kid’s smarter than him.” He doesn’t care that the last word comes out as a sob, doesn’t care about anything except the sudden feeling of Steve’s warm, skinny arms around him.
Cap shakes his head again. He looks over his shoulder before speaking, and when Tony does the same, he can barely see Red and Buck huddled and whispering in the corner.
There’s no writing, but Steve smiles at the simply drawn ballerina smack in the middle, bright red bun high on her head.
“It’s fine,” Steve tells him. “I just don’t... I wouldn’t want to bother you.”
“Tony,” Pepper warns, when Steve’s smile wavers again.
He sees Natasha first, perched on the group table and whispering to Barton, who’s leaning back on a chair next to her. Sam and Barnes are arm wrestling, and their quiet grunts are just loud enough to break the silence around them. And right in the middle of the group, is Steve, smiling softly as he brushes a pencil against the notebook in front of him. Just the sight of him makes Tony’s heart skip a beat, and he lets out a sigh before he can smother it.
“What about that time in Queens–”
” He yells. Little Tony’s cries grow fainter with every step. “
“Fuck yes-- get down here.”
?” Natasha calls out.
Steve blushes prettily, and then bites his lip. “Tony?”
“Bullshit, she gets all of it from you– the eyes, the smile, this ‘up before the sun’ schtick. All your fault, Rogers. Can’t say no to either one of you.”
“You didn’t–”
Steve picks up the ring with his thumb and forefinger. “Will you marry me?”
Warnings: NONE.
Steve hums, eyes the softest shade of blue Tony’s ever seen. “
Almost.
“--Tony, this is ridiculous, stop it. Why is this elevator so damn slow--”
“Hello, gorgeous, do I know you?”
“...I like it.”
“I would never--”
He wants it more than he’s wanted anything in a long time. But until he can have that, he knows his place is here, knows it as much as he knows that Tony does too. “The team would fall apart with both of us gone, though,” he continues, and feels Tony’s sigh echo down both their chests.
“Don’t get used to it, it’s never been a habit,” Tony replies, when Steve comments on how nice it is to see him at the same time as everyone else. “I live to surprise.”
