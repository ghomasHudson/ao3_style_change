“Do me a favor,” Steve said.  “Take a box with you.  Any box.  Because sooner or later, Clint’s going to realize there are unattended pastries down here, and that’s when we’ll be in for it.”  Steve frowned down at the lists of figures.  He was smarter than this.  He knew he was smarter than this.  “I have enough headaches.”
“Didn't you?”  He didn't even think, it was just instinct, his hand reaching out, his fingers stroking over DJ's hair.  But DJ leaned into the contact, his eyes closing for an instant.  “Well, that's disappointing.”
“Is it?” Tony asked.  He sounded amused.  “Just how bad was city hall back in your day, old man?”
Tony pinched the bridged of his nose.  “Jarvis...”
“You don’t have to-” Steve started, but Jess was already waving a hand in the air.
The old lady chortled, and Tony’s lips twitched.  “And how long are you planning on holding that against me?”
Tony gave the reporter a serious amount of side-eye.  "Number one, because everyone knows how deeply I treasure my privacy," he said, setting off a round of laughter from the room at large.  Tony's lips kicked up on one side, a wry, lopsided smile.  "And two, as much as we would've wanted to have everyone here come and celebrate our joyous day with us, there were a lot of people who we were not so eager to have join us."  He braced an elbow on the podium.  "Mostly people with tactical nukes and, you know-” He wobbled a hand in mid-air.  “Homicidal robot underlings."
Jarvis smiled.  “Very good, sir,” he said, continuing to the door.
“Nothing,” Steve and Tony said at the same time, and Tony pushed away from the counter.
“It’s outweighed by that secret sense of pride you feel when your child outsmarts you.” Steve pressed a kiss to the back of Tony’s shoulder.
“Still?” Steve asked, before slurping the soup from his spoon.
“Going to waste my life playing video games,” DJ said.
"Tony!"
“Hahahhaha no,” Tony said, and he heaved himself to his feet.  He was barely upright before the world seemed to drop out from around him, sending him stumbling backwards.  Steve caught him before he could end up on his ass.  “Okay.  That's.”  He swallowed.  “Good, that's good, thank you, can we go downstairs now?”
In comparison, Ellen was pretty sure she looked like she'd been dead a week or so.  Of gangrene.
“It's easier to follow Val's advice when it comes to, like, engines, than adult stuff,” Franklin said.  He smiled at DJ.  “But she's usually right.”
“You know what?” Carol said.  “Fair.”  She stood up.  “C’mon, Nat and Thor are sharpening weapons in front of the fire, let’s go distract Clint before he gets stabbed.”
“Because you refuse to give up on any of the many lost causes in your life,” Tony said.  “DJ, do you want to-”
She stopped.  “In any case, he made the offer, turned on his heel and was gone.  Miss Potts gave me a card, and said she’d call on me the following day, after I’d had time to think about it.”  She shook her head.  “What was there to think about?  I had no desire to enter service, but I also had precious little choice.”
"Yeah, well, that should probably be our company's new motto," Tony said. He reached for his coffee cup. "StarkIndustries: We've got a problem. It's catchy. Get me some workups, let's see what we can do with that."
Ellen grabbed her arms.  “I love you,” she said, and she meant it, more than she'd ever meant anything she'd ever said in her life.
Fifteen minutes later, Steve was stretched out on the gym floor, leaning over his legs with Jan's foot planted firmly in the middle of his back, pushing him forward.  "I'm not sure this is correct stretching procedure," he muttered into his knees.
“Right,” Clint said.  He dusted his hands on his thighs and pushed himself upright, heading for the icebox.  “Tell you what, Rogers, I'm just going to start cooking, and you can eat what you want.”
“Well, that was unfortunate.”
Rhodey shifted, his hands folded neatly on his flat stomach.  "Stop being lazy.  Fix the kid's kite."
Darcy took the map away from Clint.  “Because once you left, Georgie mentioned that she really loved your costume.”
“It’s a convention churro,” the girl said, tugging on Clint’s sleeve.  “It’s…  It’s gonna be bad.  All the food here is bad.  And over priced.”
“Congratulations,” he said.  He stopped, his lips twitching.  “Have you told Mr. Stark?”
Happy, who was hovering at the candy counter with the boys, looked up. “Coming, boss.” He slipped a few coins to one of the boys, setting of a round of cheers, then came jogging over to Tony. “Whatcha need?”
“I didn't get the goddamn water,” Tony agreed.  He struggled into a sitting position.  “I hate-”
“Thor,” Thor repeated, slapping Steve on the back again.  This time, Steve braced himself for it, managing to hold his ground.  “Now, Jarvis, where is our host.”
“Which sounds like good advice, but it's harder to do for some people,” Jan said.  She smiled at Steve.  “I prefer to punch 'em.”  She smacked one little fist into her other hand.  “Or get Jessica to punch 'em for you.”
Love, for Steve, was an incoming tide.
Tony's fingers stilled, his palm cupping the back of Steve's head.  “I don't know,” he said at last.  “The most heroic I ever felt in my life was a time Happy and I came across this old car broken down on a coastal highway.”  He stared, unseeing at the wall.  “It was dark and cold, like a hundred plus miles from anywhere, and they had, like, four kids in the backseat.” His fingers flexed, the callouses on his fingers scraping against his own palms.  “It wasn't even a hard fix, you know?  Just needed the know how and a couple of tools.”
“I try.  What's your counter offer?”
She nodded.  “I know, I know, but-”  Her head tipped back, a gentle smile sliding across her features.  “Our work knows no hours, Mr. Rhodes.”
Jarvis stilled in the act of collecting his tray, his brow furrowing.  “Sir?”
“As I see it, you have two choices.  To blindly uphold unjust laws made by men of no conscience and no compassion, or to pick and choose which laws you will enforce.”  Tony rocked back in his chair.  “Is that the long short of it?  Is that your existence?  To determine, on a knife’s edge, who deserves justice and who doesn’t?  Who is the victim of men with money and power, men who hold your leash and make you do the dirty work of running a city they way they want it to be run, no matter the human cost of their laws and their decisions?”
“I lose keys, they’re small and unimportant, but so were you,  the point is, you should have been polite enough to stay where you were put and not ended up wandering around the house and touching things, touching everything, it’s just unconscionable, your fingerprints are on-” Tony waved a wild hand at the library.  “Everything.”
“Let him work,” Natasha said, her eyes never leaving the gun in front of her.  Clint subsided.  “Thank you.”
Tony stared down at his bowl, the porridge suddenly too thick to swallow.  “Yes, sir.”
“It is magic,” Tony agreed, reclaiming the sequence of digits from her and setting them back to rights.  “What’s magic?”
“The urge to slap that out of your hand is almost overwhelming,” Harris said.
Natasha refilled Stark's coffee.  "We have potatoes," she said to Stark.  "Thanks to Officer Rogers.  And I'm sure the chef would be pleased to poach you an egg."
"Not to my knowledge, but he's pulled weirder stunts for less publicity," he said, grinning.  "But if this was his fault, he should be paying for at least half of this reception."
“In a box,” DJ explained.  “When dad was moving.  I was...  Damaged.” His toes flexed against the floor.  “And new.  I had been packed up.  And the box was, it was lost.” The words came out faster than he'd expected, as if he'd been practicing without realizing it.  “I waited, until my battery ran down.  Then, I went to sleep.”
"At least tonight," Steve said.  He blinked at Tony, his blue eyes guileless behind the slight magnification of the lenses.  "Want me to take them off?"  There was a faint note of amusement to his voice.
“Good to know where your loyalty lies,” Tony groused as he stepped onto the elevator.
Harris nodded.  “Right,” he said, giving Agatha a wary look.  “DJ, can we go back to the you’re an AI thing?”
Steve’s mouth twitched.  “And-”
Rhodey winced.  “Ah.”
“Waffles,” DJ said, his voice reverent, and Steve started to laugh.
“I was promised ice cream,” Steve said, rolling to his feet.  “Let's go.”
“Still me,” he said, and his eyes were almost painfully blue.  “Come on.”
“I was here before you.”
“A cursory scan shows it is unstable on the molecular level,” Jarvis said.  “I would strongly suggest that you not attempt to consume it.”  He paused.  “Or jostle it.”
"I tried that," he said, his lips twitching.  "Didn't work out for me.  Not going back."
Clint rubbed his chin.  Steve was almost certain he was trying to hide a smile. “In a manner of speaking.”
“I’m warning everyone, right now,” Clint said, as they all clambered to their feet, “That I’m going to get a corn dog from the regular buffet, and I’m going to put it straight into the chocolate fountain.”
“Right,” Steve said.  A muscle twitched beside his eye, and he pressed a finger there.  “I mean.  Right.”
“Uh-huh.”  Steve opened up one of the storage bins above the seats.  “I’m not sure you’re going to be able to collect on that.”
Sam winced.  “Right.  Gotcha.”  He pulled a box away from Steve.  “This one's done, get another one.”
Even knowing he was there, Steve could barely make him out.  “How’d you get up there?”
“Yeah, it ate it,” Bucky interrupted.  “Now it’s just sitting there.  Looking at me.”
“Ready?” she asked, giving a smile and a nod to the young women behind the counter.
He should go out tonight.
But the robot had already turned away from him, stepping around Tony's hovering form and continuing up the street.  “Don't worry, Cap.  It's not interested in me,” Tony said.  He flipped around, darting around the robot's shoulder, trying for a better lock on the power source.  “I'm having a hard time not taking that personally.”
“How do you deal with this?” Steve asked Eli.  “How do you deal with the guilt trips?”
Halfway through filling the filter with grounds, the doorbell chimed, and he tossed the pot into place.  “That was a quick ten minutes,” he mumbled, but headed for the door.  “Did you run?” he asked, throwing the door open and coming to a dead stop.
Sue blinked, thrown for a moment, then she realized he wasn't talking to her.  She turned, following his gaze, and yes, that absolutely was a little boy standing right next to her.
Trip nodded.  “Okay?” she prompted, because it seemed he’d run out of words.
DJ sighed. “Maybe?”
"Yeah.”  Sam braced his hands on his hips. “Steve?  Remember after you took that life drawing class?  And you were working on your anatomy?  You had a sketchbook full of nudes?”
Steve took another step back, confusion sweeping over him. “Ma'am-”
Aunt May switched her gimlet glare in Jarvis’ direction, but Peter ducked back into his room, scanning desperately for his shoes.  They weren’t where they should’ve been and he had no idea where he’d left them.  “I won’t leave the house, Aunt May, I’ll just go and check on DJ and if he’s awake, I’ll bring him back up here and if he’s not I’ll wait there until you or Mr. Jarvis come and I can do this, right?” Giving up on the shoes, he darted back into the sitting room.  “Aunt May.  I can do this.”
“Everyone,” Jarvis said, without a single sign of regret, and if there had been something in reach, Tony would’ve thrown it in the direction of the nearest camera.
Steve watched as she filled the bowl, cradling the well worn china in the hollow of one hand.  “But were they here?” he asked, as she set it in front of him.  “Once?”
“Stand DOWN,” Gyrich said, and Thor had zero interest in listening to him, which was nice, because he had diplomatic immunity, and Tony hadn't managed to get that.  Not yet.
He couldn't breathe.
“Might as well be,” Harris said.
Jarvis stepped back onto the patio, a tray balanced easily between his hands.  Peter was right behind him, holding a bushel basket in one hand and a hunk of pastry in the other.  Tony arched an eyebrow at him.  “You're going to ruin your dinner,” he said.
“If we go back to my place, you're making it worth my while,” Tony said, and Steve's teeth flashed in a sharp, beautiful smile.
This Tony, still and quiet, was one he'd seldom met, but he was familiar, for all of that.
“Call her,” Steve said, giving up.  “I'm going to bring some sketchbooks up to the penthouse.”
“Right behind you,” Tony said, laughing.
The old man opened the bible, his fingers smoothing the delicate pages.  He smiled first at Tony, then at Steve, and Tony was suddenly very, very sober.
“It's less that I want to dance,” Steve admitted, “and more that Tony can dance, and dancing, in general, is expected, and I really would like to be able to dance with him, without making a fool of myself or creating an international incident.”
“This is as far from the ‘middle of the damn lawn’ as we can get and still be outside the house,” Tony pointed out.  His hand twisted around, catching Steve’s and bringing it up.  He brushed his lips against Steve’s knuckles, against the back of his hand, against the inside of his wrist, his breath ghosting over the skin there.  “No one can see us.  You made sure of that.”  His eyes tipped up, dark and dangerous in the pale light of the moon.  “All sorts of things I could do to you, without anyone being the wiser.”
“Wait, ‘we?’” Harris asked, but she’d already hung up.  He glanced out at the living room, where DJ was offering Slink a piece of Trix.  Harris tossed his phone at the counter and lunged across the room, scooping Slink up before he could eat it.  “No, no, no,” he said to DJ.  “He’s already got a Dorito problem and a Sour Patch Kids problem, we are not acquiring a taste for breakfast cereal.”
“No, but you’re paying for it,” Peter said, struggling to separate his chopsticks.  Clint reached out, took them from him, snapped them apart with a quick twist of his fingers, and handed them back.
“Let's get you some wheat cakes.”
He just wanted to talk to Tony.
Jan huffed out a breath, crossing her arms over her chest.  "He wasn't really good at reading people.  He also didn't have a lot of stable, healthy relationships to base his expectations on?  So when Rhodey befriended him at school, but didn't have a family or a social reason to do so, he just liked Tony and, well, Tony needed all the help he could get?  But he was kind to Tony, and they were inseparable, and-"  She stopped, her teeth digging into her lower lip.  "Tony read more into it than he should've, that's all."
“Because there is no other choice,” Nicholas said.  He downed the rest of his beer in a long swallow, then dropped the tankard back to the table.  “I took the throne, because the alternative was not one I could stomach.  And you’ll do the same.”  He stood.  “If I die, and I have every reason to believe that a conspiracy within the walls of my own palace is already too established for me to stop, then it will be war.  There are three noble houses with their eyes on the throne, and each of the three is primed to take on the others.  I’ve held them in check, in a sort of balance, since I took the throne.  Kept all three of them as advisers.  It limits their ability to work in the shadows, but it also gives them far more access than I’d like.
“Neither is life,” Tony mused.
DJ's face scrunched up in an expression of disgust, and Sue reached for her purse.  "Come here," she said, digging into one of the interior pockets.  DJ looked up at Tony, who shrugged.
Tony looked back at Pepper. "Why?" he asked, and Obie stepped in front of him.
“It's a serious concern!  It stings!” Tony pointed out.
Harris spread his hands wide.  His well-tailored black suit jacket shifted easily with the movement, hugging the lines of his body without pulling as his shoulders rose.  “Does it look like I want a waffle?” he asked.
Tony pushed himself to his feet.  “You can’t stay here,” he said, because that was true.  That was one thing that was true, that he could understand.  That he could believe.  “We can’t stay here.  This is a fantasy, a fairyland.  We can’t-”
The blonde man in front of the reception desk blinked.  “Uh, no.” He shifted in place.  “Or yes.  But not far that far in the future.”
He might be going down, but he was going to go down swinging.
“Are you going to spend all day down here?”
He felt, as much as heard, Steve laugh against his throat and thumped at his shoulder with one closed fist.  “Sex now, mocking later,” he said.
Hulk paused, his eyes narrowing.  Then, he gave a very serious nod, and scrambled to his feet.  "Swim," he rumbled.
"No, wait, did anyone have Steve in the pool?"  Jan leaned back in her chair.  "Natasha?  Did anyone really-"  Natasha held up one finger, and everyone groaned.  Jan gave up on sitting like an adult, hopping up to kneel on the chair, her arms folded on the back.  "Who?"
Tony rubbed a hand over his face.  “Yeah.  Yeah, that… Sounds like me,” he admitted.  “So then-”
“No, pretty sure that's what you just said,” she pointed out, her voice sharp.  “That I'm a good reporter, but that my gaydar needs some re-calibration.”
“Could I make up something that makes me look that bad?” he managed.  “I mean, I could, but why would I?”  He glanced up, his eyes dancing.  “Nope, that’s word for word what she said, cool as anything.
“He remains in bed,” Jarvis said.  “But I suspect he is awake, judging by his respiration.”
Steve stared at him.  “It’s not me,” he said.
“We’ll talk after dinner,” Pepper said in a stage whisper.  Laughing, Natasha handed her the pen back.
Clint took a deep, broad bow.  “The circus,” he agreed.  “The perfect place for a runaway from Iowa to pick up a bit of everything.  A bit of wire walking.  A bit of trapeze artistry.  A bit of juggling, and knife throwing and animal training and contortion work.”
Tony looked at Peter, who was nearly hugging his danish now.  Next to him, Carol had a hand clapped over her mouth, her shoulders shaking with laughter.  Jess was just slowly nodding, her expression kind of pitying.  Tony looked back at Okoye.  “I had a really good idea,” he said.
“She’s not wrong,” Natasha said, walking past with a stack of dishes balanced on one hand.  She hooked Clint’s collar with one finger and turned him around.  “Look on the positive side, Chef, if he breaks it completely, you’ll get a fancy new one to play with.”
“It’s my house, I can go where I please,” Tony said, trying for dignity despite the giggling child on his back.  He handed the empty glass to Jarvis as he passed.  “We got tired of waiting.”
“Desperation,” Steve told her. “I mean, I'm hell to live with. I've been reliably informed that last week I went into a twenty-three minute rant about food waste in New York restaurants. I probably would've gone on longer, except Tony distracted me with a SHIELD briefing.” He smiled. “Which was probably the right choice.”
“Makes sense,” Bucky said, nodding.  “He’s tough.  Probably would’ve made it.”
“I suspect he does not.”  Jarvis took Steve's bag.  “However, she has been his assistant for many years now.  He is seldom surprised by her actions at this point.”  He smiled.  “He might not always approve, but he acknowledges that she has a better grasp on certain situations than he might.”
"Egg salad and a disrespectful, heartless butler pried me out of the workshop, the small ball of trouble was just his excuse," Tony said.  He took a step forward, towards the stone stairs that lead down to the gardens, and then immediately reversed direction, his feet skipping over the stone as he turned.  "He was just-"
They looped around the top floor first, the carpet muffling the sound of their steps, and Furbro padding along behind them.  DJ trailed his fingers along the polished wood of the bannister, and Steve kept a careful eye on the gallery below them.  For once, the house seemed quiet and still, and there was no movement outside.
“I'm going to put my laundry away,” he said, hefting the basket up onto his hip.  “I'm going to go upstairs and put this on my bureau.”  He arched his eyebrows.  “Can I trust you to stay still for the three minutes that will take?”
“Theft,” Mrs. Arbogast said.  “There used to be a lot more staff, I should know.  But one of the maids tried to steal from him, and after that-” She snapped her fingers.  “All of them.  Gone.”
The door rattled, and Steve managed to get out of the way before it opened.  Bucky leaned in, his face a thundercloud.  “You-”
He refused to open his eyes, because he didn’t want to see.
"The difference is,” Steve said, with a grin, “I stopped eating MREs once that was no longer necessary.” He ripped the package of pasta open, dumping the tortellini into the boiling water.  “There's bread, too, over on the-” He waved a hand towards the counter.  “If you want it?”
Bruce hid a smile behind the rim of his coffee cup, and tried to cover it up with a cough.  "Bobbi said they found it in one of the trees.  But I've seen it around the garden before; it's been taking care of the mice around my greenhouse," he said, giving Tony a lopsided smile.  He balanced his cup on his knee, a bad choice based on the way his leg was twitching.  "So, whatever it is, my, uh, my opinion is that it's-"  He paused, his head bobbing a bit as he considered.  "Useful."
“He won’t leave,” Harris said, even as he turned, looking back in the opposite direction.  “He’s got to be here somewhere, the room isn’t that big.”
“Sorry,” he said, his eyebrows arching.  “This is swing time.  Properly scheduled and very important to the smooth functioning of the household.”  He reached out, patting Rogers lightly on the chest.  “You understand, old sport.”
“We're going to assume it's a metaphor here, too,” Pepper said.
"Seen this coming?" Tony asked, bracing his cheek on one hand.  "Wanda'd be upset if you start muscling in on her territory."
“Rogers?” she snapped, sliding into the driver’s seat despite Tony’s objections.
"It isn't," Steve said.  And he was tempted to leave it at that, but somehow, he doubted that Stark would be persuaded to let it drop.  "I went to art school.  Drafting might not be particularly exciting, but it's steady work."
“Because this is going to happen,” she said, her voice flat.  “So I'd like to...”  Her lips pursed.  “Minimize the damage.”  She shifted in her seat, just a little, her fingers flexing on her bag.  “My intent is to try to do right by the child, to see if we can't find him a permanent home with one Mr. Stark's employees.”
“Why is he-” Steve started forward in a quick-paced jog, needing to do SOMETHING.  “I told him that I wasn’t interested in you.”  He stopped, his mouth going tight.  “Sorry, that’s-  That’s rude.”
And behind them, Tony was looking down at his phone, his thumbs bouncing over the surface. Steve's phone vibrated, and he looked down. “Say nice things about my ass,” the text said. “Should put that in prenup. During media appearances, you have to compliment my ass.”
'Safe' was a concept he wasn't quite sure of anymore.
Tony’s head came up.  “Someone got in the house,” he said, and Steve stopped breathing.  “They took DJ.”
“I like a man who knows his limits,” Sam said, grinning.
Bucky did not seem concerned.  “Yeah, I'd, I'd be worried about that, except your partner's a real soft touch, and everyone else thinks I'm cute.”
“Don’t get us wrong, Cap, we love you,” she said, leaning her head on his shoulder.  “But you’re not a good choice for love advice.”
“Yeah, how do you get funding for a serious psychological study of ‘have you had sex dreams about Tony Stark?’”
Happy nodded.  “Question we should be asking is, where was he last night?” he asked, shoveling a spoonful of jam into his mouth.  “Cause he said he was out, covering for someone else on the beat, but he wasn't.”
Rhodey pushed away from the wall.  "I'm going to go make sure that the car isn't stripped for parts, Miss Potts," he said.  "Our escort, while pleasant, doesn't seem to have things under control down there."
“Sure, when will you-”
He stepped inside, and closed the door behind him.  “Did you order pizza?”
Tony exhaled.  “Can't I just blow you?” he asked, and Steve muffled his laughter against his shoulder.  “No.  Seriously, I'm good at that, I'm really good at that, and I'm not-”
“I do,” he said.  He smiled.  “Do you trust me?”
"Right.  Our story."  Steve let his head fall back, looking up at the lacy pattern of the leaves above him.  "So the knight has traveled a long way.  He's met many people, people he's helped, and people who've helped him."
She nodded.  "You got a place to stay?"
Steve ran after him.  “I cannot wait.”
This was a bad idea.  He knew it was.  But Tony was grinning at him, his eyes bright, his cheeks flushed, and Steve had always liked a good, honest protest. "Fine," he said, and when Tony let go of his sleeve, moving away, Steve made a grab for him.  "Oh, no.  You're not losing me in this."
Happy looked over his shoulder at the wall.  Steve stared, his mouth falling open.  The cigar was pinned to the wall by an arrow.  Happy chuckled. “Now, that’s what I mean.”
Steve looked up and found Stark standing directly across the table from him, his expression unreadable.  "I already caught it and I'm compensating for it," Stark said.  His head tipped to the side.  "But then again, I'm used to catching mathematical errors."
“Oh, I’m sure you can, sir, it’s just that you never have, and so-”
“I love you so much,” Tony said, on the verge of tears.  “I just.  I love you so much.”
“Right, with what?” he ducked around her, taking a step onto the stairs.  He preferred not to linger on the stone floor of the basement.  It made his chest ache.
He wasn’t, not really, but DJ took a seat, one hand tugging the sushi closer to him.  “You’re here.”
“Does it matter?” Rhodey asked, setting her delicately back on the ground.
“Do you really want to start up the 'food feud' coverage again?” Pepper asked.  Tony considered that.  “Because if you enjoyed that coverage, you were the only one who did.  No one else did.  No one.”
“No, no,” Darcy said, balancing her tray on one hand like a carhop.  “He’s like, you know, a hurricane.  Chaos on the edges, draws a bunch of trash into his general vicinity, but here in the center?  The people who are snug right up against him?”  She fluttered her eyes in Harris’ direction.  “Peace in the eye of the storm.”
Pepper got there first, handing them over with a flick of her fingers.  “It's not an average day,” she said.  “In that my boss is determined to throw a party and somehow that has become my problem.”
Bruce leaned around one of the bulkheads.  He looked exhausted.  “Back here,” he said, waving Steve over.  “He’s fine.”  He smiled.  “Cold.  But fine.”
It took a lifetime, an eternity, but finally, Iron Man caught up to the boy, the movements of the armor graceful and easy.  For an instant, the two of them just fell together, their heads bent forward until they were nearly touching, their arms spread wide like a pair of skydivers cutting through the air.  Then, Iron Man twisted to the side, one arm coming out and wrapping around DJ’s chest.  The repulsors fired, a flicker of light that left sparks in their wake.
“I’m sorry,” Harris said to the girl.  “He’s usually very kind, he’s just under a lot of stress, there’s like, there’s things going on and magic freaks him out.  Usually, he’s one of the nicest people I’ve ever met.”
“Repairs,” DJ agreed.  He turned the gauntlet over in his hand.  “It IS broken.”
Clea folded her hands in her lap.  “He’s trying to grow into his potential, and that is holding him back.  He won’t risk losing you.  But there is a problem, when a child feels that they must hide who they are.  That they must pretend to be something else.  Conditional love is just that.  Conditional.
Steve folded his arms on his knees.  “Cross my heart,” he said, his lips twitching.
Steve fended him off with one hand.  “Off.  I can order a cake, Tony.  Even I’m capable of that.”  He glanced over as they headed out of the room.  “You’re coming, aren’t you?” Tony looked at him, his face puzzled, and Steve cleared his throat. “To the party, I mean?”
“It’s the perfect solution,” Tony pointed out.  “I’ll pay for it.  Of course.  That’s only fair.”
"You moved in," Sam said, his voice flat.  "I think the ship has sailed on 'privacy.'"
“As I said, very discerning guests,” Jarvis agreed.  “I shall let you know when dinner is expected, in the meantime, perhaps you can make yourself useful and being opening some boxes, sir, Happy and Bobbi will be back soon with the tree, and a bit of prep work would be appreciated.”
He felt Steve's hand cup his cheek, felt his thumb slide across the line of his cheekbone.  “Knock 'em dead, Stark,” Steve whispered, and Tony felt his face heat.
“So I need pants and he needs to-” Steve gave him a once over. Naked was a good look on Tony. Naked was a very, very good look on him. He sucked in a breath. “Tony needs to keep his pants.”
As the car rolled to a stop, reached for the door handle, catching Tony’s eye.  “Stay here.”
“I gotta-” Clint waved a hand in their direction.  “Go.”
Bruce closed his book.  “You needed it,” he said.  “I’m usually not in favor of sleeping pills, Tony, but working yourself into complete collapse isn’t, it isn’t a good idea.  It’s certainly not healthy.”
“Prohibitively expensive,” Jesse told her.  “And even though the parliament approved the bill and the King signed it into law, like, in six hourse, the locals are worried, as you might imagine, about legal challenges.  So a lot of people who've been together for years wanted to get the deed done before someone tried to turn back the clock.”
“So we're in a hole,” he said, into the horrible, still silence of his communit.  “We might be in the sewers.” He managed to take a breath and then another, choking on the sediment in the air.  “Smells more like the G-Line, to be honest.  So.  We might be in the subway line.  In the dark.  If someone could check on that.  You know.  Before a train comes.  That'd be awesome.”
“Let’s go, we’re missing all the good parts.”
Tony's head rolled in Jan's direction.  She gave him a bright smile and hopped up on the corner of his desk, one leg swinging back and forth.  “She feeds on praise,” Tony said to Pepper.  “It makes her stronger.  Almost-” He gestured at Jan.  “Unnaturally powerful.”
“GET IN THE CAR, YOU IDIOTS,” she roared.
“Right,” Pepper said.  “Tony, can we-”
Steve paused, his fingers tight on the strap of the shield.  “You came here.”
Fury didn't even look up from the tablet in his hand. “Huh” he said, tapping a finger against his lips.  “This is almost word for word a conversation that I had with the US Government about you.”
Steve realized that he was smiling.  And it felt good.  It felt right.  "You snuck in through the kitchen."
“First of all, no one wants yout corn dogs, Barton, and second of all, there’s a whole buffet out there, you can get more.”
“I didn’t,” Ellen said.  “I came to work.  And you were here.”  Her shoulders were tight, her back straight.  “Why are you here?”
“Were you aware of what was being celebrated?”
A flicker of something went over Tony’s face, something that Steve couldn’t identify.  As quickly as it had come, it was gone, and Tony smiled up at him with blank, shuttered eyes.  “Your job is lousy, Steve.  You’re a broken cog in an even more broken system.”
Confused, Tony tried to pull away, and Obie’s fingers squeezed, holding him in place.  “Don’t bother,” he said, and it was icy and empty.  “I put enough tranquilizer in your drink to drop an elephant in less than thirty minutes.  I’m almost surprised you’re still awake.”
"Right," Steve said, and he hung up, because that was mature.  Because he was mature.  And he regretted it the immediately.  Because this room was very empty and very stark and felt very expensive.  It was the kind of room that Tony fit into without even trying.  Tony, suave and collected and sophisticated, who made things easier for Steve without even trying.  Tony, who made things feel comfortable, feel natural.
DJ nodded, and Thor's face split in a grin.  “Ah, I am most pleased that it meets with your approval.”  With a flick of his wrist, he tossed it to DJ, who reached out, his fingers snatching it from mid-air.  “My brother and I spent many a summer afternoon playing catch in the fields by our house.”  He pushed himself to his feet.  “It is one of my favorite memories.”
Tony gave him a wide, easy smile.  “Are you hungry?” he asked, and before Steve could reply, he continued on.  “Best fast lunch in the city.” His head tipped forward, and his hair flopped forward.  He pushed it back, and there was a flush across his high cheekbones.  “When have I ever steered you wrong?”
Steve bit his lip to keep from laughing as both of them stumbled towards consciousness.  “You two okay?”
“Are you going to take that thing?” Bucky asked him.
‘Sir.”
"No," Tony said.
“I looked totally marriageable,” Clint said, heaving himself out of his seat.  “Dinner tonight?”
“Of course, sir,” she said.
“Just a little,” DJ said, as Steve walked back to the head of the bed, taking a seat next to Tony.  He moved one of the pillows out of the way, leaning up against the headboard.
“Excuse me?” Tony sputtered.
“You love me,” Sam said, holding the cup out to Steve, one eyebrow arching. “I mean, I thought you did.”
“Cool,” Tony said, his feet shifting on the steps.  “When?  I'll bring a dropcloth.”
Tony took it.  Soft, delicate threads of pasta was piled high, tossed in a coating of olive oil and garlic, topped with rough chunks of tomato and sausage, and a dusting of finely shredded cheese.  The porcelain of the bowl was warm in his hand, and Tony wrapped both hands around it, cradling it in his palms.  “Spaghetti?” he asked, his lips pulling up in a slight smile.
DJ opened his eyes.
His breath left him in a sound like a sob, and he was out of his seat in an instant, throwing himself forward.  And Steve met him halfway, clumsy with the force of it, catching DJ in a hug that was too tight, and too much, and just what he needed.  DJ buried his face in Steve’s shoulder and held on, his fingers digging into Steve’s shirt.
Clint’s head swung around, his eyes wide.  “With you.”
At the 'fun table,' Luke gave him a thumbs up.  Steve tried to smile at him.  He was pretty sure he wasn't successful, but he tried.
He wandered across the kitchen to peer over Steve's shoulder.  "When you move in, you move all the way in," he said, making Steve laugh.
Jarvis poked his head out of the closet.  "A purr, sir," he said, before disappearing again.
“I’ll do my best,” he said.  “Good night, Bruce.”
“You could’ve quit,” Tony pointed out.
“Yes, and we’ve had all, what, six people try?” Hank asked.  “Not exactly a-” The sound of breaking glass echoed down from the shop, and his head snapped up.  “REILLY!”
Tony’s stomach rolled over.  “I don’t want to be needed, it’s, it’s very stressful, that’s not something I want to handle, I don’t think that’s something I can handle.”
Steve stared at the blank surface of the door, his chest aching.  “That might be true,” he said at last.  “But the bedroom's where he's naked, Jarvis.”
“And just in time to decorate the main hall, it’s wonderful how things work out, isn’t it?” Jarvis said, already striding towards the kitchen stairs with a distinct spring to his step.
“No next time,” Tony said, and DJ grinned at him.
Tony gave it a disdainful look.  “Tell me you’re kidding right now.”
Chocolate didn’t fix anything.  But it didn’t hurt, either.
The silence was sudden and absolute.  DJ’s eyes flicked open, and found that the world around him had frozen in place, a tendril of nothingness hanging motionless in space right in front of him.  The glow from his hand was stronger now,  bright enough to throw shadows across the walls, across the bookshelves.  Everything else was still.  Frozen.
“What…  Did I miss?”
Stark nodded.  “Right.” He held up a finger between them.  “Also, I get to win an argument of my choosing at some point in the future, whenever I want to call that in,” he said.  “I don’t care if I’m right.  I don’t care if I’m utterly wrong, in fact, that’s probably when I’m going to call this in, because you owe me, and I get to play the ‘you fucking left me and I was pretty sure you were going to die and that I had lost everything’ card and I get you to agree that the sky is orange, even if it clearly, absolutely is not.”
“The system seems to have worked out just fine for you,” Steve shot back.
“Yeah, that's, that's kind of my modus operendi,” Tony pointed out.  “You should be used to that by now, Pep.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw DJ nod.  Then, a tiny, rusty sounding, “Yes.”
Steve stripped the sock off of Tony's foot and tossed it at Bucky's head. “Thank god I've finally got that foot fetish under control,” he said, reaching for Tony's other foot.  Bucky made an inarticulate noise of pain and disappeared back down the stairs.  Grinning down at Tony, Steve peeled off his other sock and tossed it over the top of the railing.
Miss Van Dyne arched an eyebrow.  "Fine."
“Right,” she said, sounding bored.  “Clint?”
Steve paused, his head tipping back. One of the third floor windows was open, and a handful of boys were clustered by the windowsill, peering down at them.  “That so?” Steve called.  He nodded towards the front door.  “Want to let us in?”
Tony’s mouth closed.  He sighed.  “It would be helpful if you knew me a little less,” he said, reaching for his coffee cup.  Steve got there first, slipping it out from under his hand.  Tony stared down at his empty hand.  “Right.  A lot less.”
“Let’s never do the opera,” Bobbi mumbled into her notes.
DJ’s mouth worked, silently at first, and then, at last, “Too much.”
“I’ll eat.”
“I'm going to hang up on you,” he said, because really, Rhodey should know that this friendship was hanging by a thread.
“A secret?” Steve asked, his brows drawing up tight.
“Never mind,” Stark said.
“Because I don’t want to deal with putting everything out,” Jan said.
“Hey!” It was a scream, and he didn’t have the breath to manage more than that.  He passed a table, and grabbed for whatever was on it, some knick-knack that felt solid and hard in his hand and he reared back and threw it, with all the force he could muster.  It missed, sailing over the man’s shoulder and bouncing across the floor harmlessly.
Jarvis arched an eyebrow at him.  “Indeed,” he said, taking the glass.  “And so you decided to come to your breakfast, instead of waiting for your breakfast to come to you.”
“I think that’s stealing government property,” Shawn said.
Steve braced one hand on the table, leaning into it. “Tony.”
Jarvis took the jacket away from him, smoothing it out.  “Because the dining room is very large, and very formal,” he said, his voice gentle.  “And it is his first meal with us, with our plates and our silverware and our manners.”  He held the jacket out to Tony.  “A frightening thing to a full grown adult.  For a child, perhaps a bit too much.”
“Yeah, I know.”  Rhodey’s voice sounded amused.  “You’re in my phone, Steve.  Got your own contact and everything.”
“You would notice that,” Franklin said.  He stretched out a leg, bumping DJ's foot with his.  “You okay?”
“I’m fine, I’m-”  He closed his eyes.  “Oh, God, I’m a terrible friend.”
“I love you, too,” Tony said, “and I’m never letting Clint into my car again.”
“I don’t like to think about Phil in any sort of…  Casual clothing,” Harris said.  “It’s like seeing your third grade teacher buying margarita mix at the grocery store.  It’s very disconcerting.”
Steve looked back as a man stepped through the crowd.  Slightly better dressed than the rest of the others, he had a nose that had been broken more than once, and a cruel twist to his smile.  He had a heavy cudgel in one hand, his fingers curled around the handle in an easy, natural grip. “Shoulda minded your own damn business, and kept your nose outta ours.” He swung it through the air, letting it rest against the meat of his shoulder. “Gonna enjoy this.”
Steve winced. “Right. Okay. Right.” He huffed out a breath. “We're in the parking garage?”
“Thank you, I know it’s hard for you.  I appreciate that you try,” Mrs. Parker said, holding out a slice of apple to him.  She gave another slice to Steve.  “I bet if you ask very nicely, Officer Rogers’ll help you clean this up.”
Harris let them pull him to his feet.  “Why do you have a gun?” he asked Sitwell.
Ellen gaped at him.  "I outed you."
Tony didn’t seem to notice.  He just leaned in, his chest brushing against Steve’s shoulder.  “This UI is horrible,” he said, scowling at the screen.  “What is this, did they hire a web designer who’s been in a come since 1993?  Was this put together by the owner’s second cousin for a high school class?”
“Shaaaaaaaaaaame,” Jess said, holding the pages over her head.  “SHAAAAAME.”
There was a long, long pause, where Tony just stared at the camera as if it had talked bad about his second course, and then, the voice from off-screen said, “Are…  Are you asking me?”
Stark watched this interplay, his jaw braced on one hand, sipping his coffee.
“You’re out,” Greer said.  She drained the last of her juice and stood.  “And if you shoot me, I’m going to shoot you back.”  She put her cup in the dishwasher.  “You useless, useless lesbian.”
“Bruce is careful to keep all the outbuildings locked,” Rhodey said.  “Just in case.”
"Yes, that," Steve agreed.  "So, his way of convincing a young man that he's better off without girls-"
“I wouldn’t mind,” Tony managed.  He glanced up, meeting Stane’s eyes without flinching.  “And it’s my carpet, I’ll stain it however I please.”
"No," Steve said.
“Director.” Rhodey sank into the seat on the other side of Tony.  “I'm not here as a representative of-”
“AND amazing,” Jane said.
Steve choked on a laugh.  “I’d ask, but I’m too afraid to-”
Rhodey took it.  “God bless you,” he said.  He looked up.  “Know what Tony’s got in here?”
Steve wasn’t sure if Tony was even taking to him anymore.  “I-” His chest felt tight, even the act of breathing required a monumental effort.  “What are you talking about?”
“So do you,” Tony said.  ‘And I don’t…  I don’t think I can fight you on this.”
“Who's going to tell her?” Stark said, his voice belligerent, and Clint, Natasha and Peter all raised their hands.  After a moment, DJ raised his hand, too.  Stark gave him a look.  “Traitor,” he said, but he was smiling.  “Fine.”  He pushed his stool back from the counter.  “Do we have any pie?  Or did Peter eat it all again?”
“That's quite the assumption you're making,” Tony said, as the song's tempo changed, smoothing out into something a bit more relaxed and easy.
Natasha, one hip braced on the back of the couch, smiled down at her fingernails. “No,” she said.  “It’s my Christmas gift to myself.”
“She’s still with me, don’t-”
Hank peered at him over the rims of his glasses.  “Right,” he said, drawing the word out.  “The way I want it.”  He leaned back, his arms crossed over his chest.  “But maybe not you.”
“I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t.”  Tony headed up the stairs.  “I love you.  You know that, right?”
On the tablet, DJ made his choice, holding up a flash card with a broad smile.  Tony paused, leaning in to squint at it.  “What…  What is that?  I don’t know what that is in English, let alone Japanese, what the heck, kid, dial it back.”
Tony stopped.  “Because the kid thought his best bet in getting home was to ask our Strange for help, and I didn’t have an answer for that other than, sure, why the fuck not, because some idiot gave him a set of armor, and if I ever meet his father, I’m going to break his nose, let’s just make that clear.  I don’t-”
“Right.  Bathroom.”
One of Miss Potts eyebrows arched.  "I'm going down to Mr. Hammer's home for wayward boys to select an orphan who will come to live with Mr. Stark for the next week," she said.  There was an odd note to her voice, one Steve couldn't quite interpret, and her face had become a mask, smooth and serene.
The feed was a mess.
"Hey!" Peter said, making a grab for the kite.  Stark sidestepped him and gave the thing a toss.  It floated across the grass, wobbling on its rapid downward path towards the ground.  Peter frowned at it, then at Stark.  "I did my best."
“Everyone’s a critic,” Tony said, and finished his croissant.
Natasha touched his wrist, the barest brush of her fingertips against his hand, and DJ peeked out at her from between his fingers.  She was smiling, just a little, her eyes half closed as she studied him.  “It's okay,” she said.  “Take a breath.”  He sucked in a breath, held it for a moment, and then let it out.  She nodded.  “We'll figure it out.  All of us.”
"He has..." Jarvis paused.  "I suppose 'regressed' is the best word that I can use to describe the situation."
“You don’t have to be good,” his father said.  “If you’re trying, if you’re working at something you want to do, than we’re proud of you for that.”  He reached over and snuck a piece of California roll off of DJ’s tray, and DJ held it out of reach.  “We’re always going to be proud of you.”
Tony arched an eyebrow at him.  “I can work anywhere,” he said.  “You can drive.  I can curse out my latest design in the back.”
"Imperial Stout Trooper" is a real beer.  I'm told it's pretty good.
“Sorry,” Harris said  “I mean, I’m not, but I am, if that makes sense.”
Harris winced.  “That…  Might not have been the best choice,” he said, cautiously.
“I’m going,” Tony said.
Steve needed to go out.  Before he lost his mind.
“I expected him to leave.  Or ask me to leave.  Instead, he just sat there, watching me mix bread dough.  And when I was done, when I was about to leave, he suddenly said, and I remember this, even now, I remember…”  Her knife went still.  “‘Is he all right?’”
“Have you heard a single word I've said?” Tony said, his voice flat.  “Seriously.  Have you-”
“Rhodey, actually,” Tony said.  His eyebrows arched.  “The Army brass had limited use for a man of his intelligence and abilities, but he likes to make his own opportunities.”  He swirled the wine in his glass. “However, if you threatened any of her ducklings, I’m fairly certain May could figure out which end of the dynamite to light.”
“The Virgin Mary will do her best for us, I’m sure, but Hearst prevers his tithing in cold, hard cash,” Pepper pointed out.
“Thought you wanted me to leave,” Bruce said.
Steve'd chosen the bedroom as far from the master suite as he could get.  But every time he went back to the elevator, he found himself staring up that hallway.  And half the time, he got off the elevator and forgot which way he was supposed to go.  After six or so trips today, he still found himself going left instead of right.   When it happened for the third time in as many trips, he stopped, wanting to beat his head against the uncaring door.  At least this time he was alone when he found himself standing directly in front of the door to Tony's bedroom, his arms locked around a box, doing his best not to reach for the doorknob.
“I don’t control the roombas,” Harris said, handing her a ten, and accepting his change.  “You guys know that, right, Neena?”
“I’ll do my best, hold it together, MacIntyre.”
It was an order, and everyone, as one, reached for a chair.  Steve glanced at DJ, his face tense, and DJ gave him what he hoped was a reassuring smile.  “I…  Want to know what’s happening,” he managed, reaching for his chair.  He was tired, and everything hurt, his head, his throat, his hands.  But he looked at Agatha, his fingers twitching on the arms of the chair.  “I…  Do know you.”
“Yeah, I do that pretty often, sir, I mean-”
Steve looked over, his shoulders tensing.  “You should still be in bed,” he said, and Tony gave him a look.
There was metal wrapped around his hands, fragments going up past his wrists, gold and silver and bright red that glinted in the shafts of low light.  Wires spun around his arms, like veins, like branching lightning, but the gauntlets on his hands were solid.
“Sometimes he just screams at you,” Jesse pointed out.  “He gets around to me eventually.  But you're his favorite.”
She paused in the act of removing her wrap.  “Yes,” she said, her voice very patient.  “Book club.  Where we gather, and have a discussion about the text of a book, which we have all read.”
Rhodey stood up.  “I’m not discussing that until after we’ve had food.”
“I know!” It came out too loud, too sharp, and he stopped, shock and confusion sweeping over him.  He struggled to get himself back under control.  “I...  I know.”
“Yes, I think you should ask Sam out,” Steve said, and words didn’t taste like copper anymore.  “No.  He’s not seeing anyone.  That’s-  That’s not a secret.  His last breakup was sad but mutual, she was a really nice lady who couldn’t handle all-”  He tugged his hand away, and she let him go.  “All of this.”
Not the truth, not really, but enough to bring Hammer’s head up.  “I-”  He swallowed.  “I did, I was-”  He stopped, the bottle bouncing against the desktop as he dropped it.  “He promised me money, enough money that I’d never have to see this place again, that I could finally be something, be someone, get out, easy street, all the way.”
By the flickering light of the lantern, he crossed the fields, keeping the sound of the running water on his right.  Down in a hollow of the land, next to a bend in the river, the old weeping willow bent low over the water.  Its long, trailing branches swung in the breeze, the leaves rattling with every move.  Tony ducked down, following the path under the sheltering branches.
“Wash up first,” Clint told him, and Bruce considered his hands.
Tony reached for his coffee.  “From Steve?” he asked, and DJ nodded.  Tony made what he hoped was an approving sound behind his cup.  “Good.  That’s…  Good.”  He was proud of himself.  That sounded almost sincere.  Or as close to sincere as anyone could expect from me.
"And he's a right wing, homophobic twit," Tony said, ignoring the spike of panic that shot through him. He stared at his phone. "Marcy, what the hell-"
“You didn’t order for seventy people,” Tony said, his voice brisk.  “You ordered seventy assorted dessert platters.”  Steve stared at him.  Tony gave him a slight, sympathetic smile.  “And each of them is intended to feed ten people.”
“No, I-”  He stopped.  “Yes.  I guess I was.” He straightened up.  “Thanks, Jarvis.”
Curious, Tony flipped up the lid.  “Anything good?”
"If anyone else in this kitchen had showed up looking like you, you would've expelled them immediately," Steve said.  "They wouldn't have made it past the threshold."  His head tipped to the side, trying to catch Tony's eyes.  "You are sick.  You should not be handling food.  So.  Who's taking your station?"
Pepper reached over, taking the glass out of his hand.  “All right,” she said, her voice brisk.  She set the glass down on the end table, just out of Tony's reach.  “We're going in circles, and that's not helping anyone.”
Steve stared at him, caught somewhere between laughing and outright frustration.  Tony, reading him like a book like always, just braced his elbows on the table, lacing his fingers together and leaning his chin on them.  "I mugged a waiter in the back alley," he said, one eyebrow arching.
The smile was a reflex, smooth and practiced.  Tony turned towards the photographer who'd asked the question, giving the asshole his best side.  “Yeah.  Sleep and alcohol,” he said, setting off a wave of laughter.  He flicked a quick salute at the press gathered outside of the SHIELD building.  “I've got a date with about six different versions of 'A Christmas Carol' and a very comfortable couch.”
Steve opened his mouth, and whatever he was going to say was going to be horrible; he could taste the words on his tongue, bitter and poisonous, and he had no idea what they were going to be.  He was beyond thought now, beyond even trying to think.  His fingers flexed, dragging Tony closer, and then, he stopped.
“Magic.  Fucking-” His mouth worked, desperate to spit out the words that clogged his throat.  “Magic.  Always magic, this thing that you do, incomprehensible, nonsensical, it’s just-” He pressed a hand to his head, which was throbbing now.  “I’d ban you all, I just want it gone, I want it OUT.  Get out of my tower, get out of my LIFE, just get OUT.”
“Listen, just-”
“I don't know, but you'll be doing it on the street tonight,” Tony told him.  Not waiting for a reply, he stomped back towards the living room.
“Sorry,” he mumbled, and Tony struggled to get himself back under control.  He was not a randy teenager.  He gritted his teeth, trying not to think about Steve's breath, hot against his stomach, the armor's undersuit barely any barrier between Steve's mouth and Tony's skin.  Steve's fingers flexed, his knuckles brushing against Tony's thigh.  “Sorry.”
“Gotta punch something,” Steve gritted out.   Every muscle in his body felt like it had been drawn taut, ready for a fight that refused to materialize.  He sucked in a breath, and another, air hissing between his teeth.  “And my choices are limited right now.”
Steve reached for the flute in front of him.  “To us,” he said, tapping his glass to Tony's.  “And expanded horizons.”
“I am not staying,” she said, and knowing a surrender when she heard one, she went back to the stew.  “As soon as I’ve eaten enough to sustain me for the long cold night, I’ll take my leave.”  She gave him a puckish grin.  “Fair?”
Rhodey laughed, a bright, boisterous bust of sound that never failed to make Tony smile.  “I think I’m hurt, Banner.”
He stared down at the greenhouse, wondering if what he'd seen has just been the moonlight reflecting off of the panes.  He braced a hand on the sill, his eyes narrowing as he tried to make sense of it.
“How she puts up with you, I have no idea,” Pepper said, shifting through the paperwork.  “Is it dinnertime, Jarvis?”
"I'm buying this entire country," Tony said, as they exited into the airport proper.  He resisted the urge to kick Steve in the shins.  "You planning on putting me down?"
“That’s not a guest,” Tony told Jarvis.  “That’s a pest.”
Steve took a breath.  “I know.  I just-” His head fell forward, and he took a deep breath.  “I hate it.”
He rested his elbow on the edge of the window, bracing his hand against his forehead.  “I don’t forgive him.  He was a lousy father, and I don’t want to do to my kid what he did to his.  But that’s harder than you’d think.  It’s harder than you think to disengage, and recognize the pattern and stop it.  Because to do that, you have to really understand that what happened to you was shitty, and I can say he’s a lousy father, but some part of me still wonders why I couldn’t be the perfect kid he could actually have loved.”
“And you’re still going,” Tony said to no one in particular.  “This…  This is still happening.”
Steve let out a little laugh. “Go? Go wh-”
“It'll do,” Miss Van Dyne said, her little pointed chin in the air.  “Better than that trash.”
But when Tony pulled away, he was breathing hard, his pulse throbbing in his ears like he'd just done ten rounds in the suit.  Steve blinked at him, his long lashes fluttering, and Tony caught himself grinning.  "Sorry," he said, the words almost lost in the cheering of the crowd.  "I've got a reputation to maintain."
“No,” Bucky said, dropping into a seat across from her.
“That’s what cabs are for,” Steve said.  He looked up the corridor.  “I need to get back.”
“Happy?” Tony said.  “Go make a significant donation to the good Father’s collection plate to thank him for his assistance.” He met Happy’s eyes.  “And stall for time.”
"Why do I think this is going to end badly?" Steve asked, but he was smiling when he asked the question.
“Your dad's okay,” Franklin said, taking the stool that Tony had just vacated.
“Right.  Sure.  Steve.”  He backed out of the kitchen, his head still bobbing in a nod the entire way.
Tony turned on his heel, snapping his fingers.  Jarvis, prepped and ready, threw up a holographic interface, schematics unfolding around him in the air.  Steve watched, his jaw set.  “You’ll be the first to know,” he said to T’Challa.
Tony stared down at the fingertip doing its best to grind a hole right through what was left of his breastbone.  "I'm busy that night," he said, because he never thought well on his feet in front of an angry woman.
Bucky choked on a laugh.  “Ain't happening, I've got all night deliveries, and I'm not doing it on no food AND no sleep.”  He eyed the couch.  “You're small.”
In the silence that followed, Ty’s smile stretched, cold and mocking.  “So clumsy.  It’s no wonder father keeps you hidden down in the basement.  It would be bad enough for him, but I honestly think that he’s trying to preserve your father’s memory.  After all, he used to be a well-respected man.”
Tony managed a smile.  “He shot my jacket?”
“Nope,” Tony said.  Harris opened his mouth, and Tony held up a hand.  “Steve is a mother duck at heart.  He knows where his ducklings are.”
“You’re an idiot,” Tony told him.
“Comforting.” Bruce squinted down at his tablet, and Tony reached over, flicking his glasses off of his forehead and down to his nose.  Bruce blinked, and leaned back.  “It’s comforting that you, uh, that you have an actual timeline on that.”
Steve exhaled, and it ached, along every inch of his body.  “He runs away.  A lot,” he said.  He turned around, looking back at DJ.  “That’s how I met him, the first time.  He’d smuggled his way out of the building in a bin of dirty linens.”  Steve smiled.  “I nearly had a heart attack when he overturned the whole thing and came rolling out.”
There was a moment of pause, and then Tony read aloud, “Free cookie if you don’t ask me anything about Congress.”  He made a humming sound under his breath.  “Has that worked at all?” he asked.
“Yes.” Steve turned back to his meal.  Like Tony had said, it was excellent.  He smiled, dug in.  “It’s lunchtime.  Eat.”
“Good boy.”  Obie’s hand landed, heavy and firm, on his shoulder, his fingers squeezing, and Tony felt some of the tension in his chest bleed away.  He held on, just for a moment, and then he was gone, walking past Tony’s seat without a glance back.
“He bought a Spider-Man sweatshirt,” Steve said, grinning.
Steve nodded.  “And I'm also trying to respect his boundaries.”
This bed was trying to swallow him.
He took a step away, and another, and dropped into a kitchen chair.  “Of course you are,” he repeated, his head falling into his hands.  “Okay.  That was…”  He laughed again, and it didn’t sound like a laugh anymore.  “That was kind of an overreaction, wasn’t it?”
He apparently had a very odd idea of what constituted dirty talk, but damn if this wasn't working for him.
There was a pause.  “Goddammit.  Yes, I do.”  There was the sound of pages being turned, and then, “Philip Marsham was bred to the sea as far back as the days when he was cutting his milk teeth, and he never thought he should leave it; but leave it he did, once and again, as I shall tell you.”
“Right, and you were…” Tony said to Clint.
“Because all women are terrifying,” Jess said.  She was doing something bizarre with her hands and knees; Steve was pretty sure she was attempting the Charleston.  She was also failing, but she sure was trying.  “The ones who don't seem terrifying are just extra good at hiding it.” She did a hopping kick.  “Right Jane?”
Steve shoved a hand through his hair.  “Because that’s not how people work.”
He lapsed into silence, and Steve waited, sipping his coffee.  “You didn’t,” he said at last.
“I could be persuaded.”  Tony could hear the laughter in his voice, and it was remarkable how soothing that was.
“Call me,” Fury mouthed at him.
“In my luggage,” Tony said, stretching his legs out in front of him, putting his cold, damp feet a little too close to the fire.  Steve made a disapproving noise under his breath, and Tony grinned, his eyes falling shut.  Steve smelled of wood smoke and dust, soap and peppermint.  “You’ve been into the candy canes.”
“She shot in my direction, it was more a distraction than an actual murder attempt.”  Rogers stared at him, and Tony smiled.  “Don't worry.  She apologized.”  He paused.  “Well, no, she didn't, actually, but I'm sure she meant to.”
“Hi!  He’s fine,” Carol said.  “Despite drinking his weight in vodka last night.  Meanwhile, Tony’s hungover-”
Tony scraped a hand over his face.  “You're losing it,” he mumbled.
"I'm...  Honored?" Tony said, his chin braced on one fisted hand.
“Do you want the-”
Everything seemed to slow down, the world whiting out on the edges, the thud of his pulse loud in his ears. Steve sucked in a breath, slow and careful, his fingers hovering over the surface of his phone.
Sam spread his hands, his head tipped forward so he could look up at Steve from beneath the arch of his brows.  "Not your therapist.  Just your friend."
Morrison's mouth gaped open. "Excuse me?"
“I got that post-it note,” Tony said. “And?”
“I am back to fire my tattoo artist,” Tony said.
Steve was sprawled out on the bed, his shoulders braced on the pillows that were piled up against the headboard.  His jean clad legs were crossed at the ankles, his bare feet coming up just short of the end of the mattress.  His attention was focused on the book in his hands, and it was all so familiar and so domestic that for a second, Tony’s throat closed up.
“I can do it, thank you,” Rogers said to him.
He could fix any of it.  If he had the time.  He opened a drawer on the workbench and dropped it in, pushing it all the way to the back.
He looked down at her.  There was a scrape on her forehead, blood in her hair and on her temple, and her lip was split.  Her eyes were red and wet, but steady.  He gave her a grin.  “Enough room to stand up and enough room to move, if stuff starts coming down.  Nothing's on fire.  Water's not pouring down on us.  There's no...”  He paused.  “Ooze.  Or curds.  I've had worse.”  He shifted.  “You hurt?”
“The child knows what he wants,” Agatha said from the other side of the table.  In front of her, a crock of French onion soup steamed away under a thick blanket of cheese.  “It is something to be admired.” She picked a piece of crusty bread from the platter in the middle of the table.  She considered DJ’s bowl.  “What sort?”
“A tea cup and two of the mixing bowls, though I believe one can be salvaged,” Jarvis said.
Clint flicked down a corner of the map and gave Tony a look over the edge.  “No,” he said, his voice flat, and went back to his map.
If Steve had any response to that, he didn’t hear it.
He glanced down at the glasses in his hand.  He should give them back.  It was stupid.  Maybe even manipulative.  Instead, he tucked them back in their case.  “Thanks.”
Natasha gave him a look, and he shoved a piece of toast into his mouth, his eyebrows bouncing up. "Officer Rogers, Bobbi Morse.  Bobbi, Officer Rogers."
“I work with what I have, and what I have has been severely deficient as of late, since you have refused to continue outfitting the house,” Jarvis told her.  He caught DJ under the arms, lifting him up onto the chest at the foot of the bed.  He put DJ's shoes in his lap.  “Your feet will be cold if you don't have shoes, young sir.”
Rhodey looked at him, surprised by the lines of exhaustion that bracketed his mouth.  “Are you all right?”
Steve looked at Jan.  “I’ll do it.”
There was a beat of silence.  The girl cleared her throat.  “Gary’s actually pretty decent,” she said.  “He knows it’s bullshit, but he gets in trouble if he doesn’t yell at us about it, so pretty much we all try to do it because he doesn’t, you know-”  Tony stared at her, and she gave a little shrug, looking sheepish.  “It could be a lot worse.”
Clint shrugged.  “Honestly, your guess is as good as mine,” he said.
"Who's coming tonight?"
Steve smiled at nothing in particular.  “You going to be trying to seduce me?”
Happy’s jaw went tight.  “We’re about to see.”
“See, you do understand how this house is supposed to run.”  Tony tapped his pen against the stack of pages.  “He was talking crazy, by the way, and I don’t appreciate it.  Has there been gossip below stairs?  Are you gossiping?”  Jarvis gave him a pitying look, and Tony made a face.  “I have rules.”
Steve went still. Jan's eyes pinned him in place with a glare that could've flash frozen ice. He cleared his throat. “Well, when you put it that way, it seems like a really stupid plan,” he managed.
Steve gave him a look from under the line of his brows.  “You could’ve slept in.  I’m only up because I didn’t sleep well last night,” he said, and that sounded juvenile.  He found he didn’t much care.  He stretched one leg up behind him.  “Taking a run seemed like a better use of my time than glaring at the ceiling of my bedroom.”
Steve smiled back.  "Merry Christmas.”
Tony's pulse was pounding in his ears, hard and fast, almost blocking out everything else.  He couldn't think about it, he couldn't even begin to think about that, or he'd lose his mind, and this was not the time or place for that.  He tucked his hands in his pockets, so no one could see how they shook.  "Well, to be honest," he said, and his voice was steady, was faintly amused, "I only married you because I got sick of waiting for Beyoncé to dump Jay Z."
She was already shaking her head.  "Tony.  We can't.  We-"
“Perhaps a pair of house slippers?” Miss Van Dyne said, peering at the seams of Steve's borrowed jacket.  She made a disappointed noise. “There's not enough to here for me to let out.”
“Are you wearing my pants?” he asked.
She glanced over as the kitchen door opened, her chin coming up, a faint flicker of hope crossing her face.  An instant later, it was gone, but she managed a smile in any case.  “Welcome back, Officer Rogers.”
Jesse's eyes rolled towards the ceiling.  “Right,” she said, but she was smiling.  “Get your hungover ass out of bed, and let's go pound on the door of city hall.”
Tony looked up at Steve, a tight smile on his face.  “Might not come to anything, but it’ll keep both of us-” He gestured vaguely at the ceiling, towards one of Jarvis’ cameras.  “Busy.  And out of trouble.”
“How did PEPPER find me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right.  Hiding in his office slash storage closet again, I assume,” Tony said, tapping his tablet against his other hand.  “Is he sleeping on the couch?”
“Yeah, totally,” he said, because fuck it.  Fuck it all.  “Have you guys finished killing the damn deathbot yet, or what?  I mean-”
“Good.  Let’s try for dry.  Something to aim for.  Goals.” Tony headed towards the office  “It’s good to have goals.”
“I wouldn’t be surprised,” Steve said.  He took the cup with a nod and a smile.
“Why would I let him do-” Steve started, realizing his error only when Tony snagged a box from the shelf.  “Actually, now that you mention it, I’m sure he did.”
He couldn't breathe.  He kept trying to suck air in, between tight lips and set teeth, and it stuck in his throat, hot and burning.  He closed his eyes, concentrating on trying to make his lungs work.  Breathe.  Breathe.  Breathe.
Warning for some drunken bad choices on Tony's part.  No major injuries or long term problems will result, but he's a jerk
Luke grinned at him.  “You planning on asking, or waiting to be asked?”
“Museum won't take me,” DJ said.
“Oh, he’s been buying things,” Tony agreed.  “More things than he can techinically afford.”  He took a deep breath and let it out.  “He’s been day trading.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Tony, who knows DJ was still here?”
“Well-”
“No, I didn’t,” Steve said, returning the cloth to the bucket, soaking it and wringing it out.
Clint let out a bark of laughter.  “My ancestors weren’t even French,” he said, his chin bobbing in a nod.  He diced an onion, the blade still moving with dizzying speed, and reached for another one.
“Good afternoon!” Bobbi strode up the stairs, her long legs taking them two at a time.  Her cheeks were pink, her long blond hair plaited into a braid and wrapped around her head.  She ruffled Peter's hair as she walked past.  “Stay out of the greenhouse, trouble, we've got an experiment running and things break around you.”
Tony’s jaw flexed.  “No.  So what will-”
“Long gone.”  She looked at him.  “One of these days, you will push him too far.”
For a long moment, Tony was still, his face unreadable.  Then he smiled.  “He’s not interested,” he said, and there was something gentle about that.  “And even if he was-”  Tony shook his head.  “No.  I’m not.  He’s wonderful, don’t get me wrong, but-” He picked up his coffee cup, and turned to the pot.  “I dated my PA and ended up making her my CEO.”
“Puree of organic wild Maine blueberries,” Tony said.  Steve held up the fork, and the puree was so dark it was almost red, and he could smell it from here.  “The little ones.  That actually taste of something.  Not the giant blue abominations they force on us now.  Dark chocolate ganache.  The cocoa’s ethically sourced.  The powder is salted caramel dust.”
“Once,” Peter said, trying to smooth his hair down.  Bobbi gave him a look.  “Twice.  At most.”
“The lamps, or the whole situation?” Clint asked him with an easy smile.
His fingers closed around the grip, and for a moment, he paused, somehow reluctant to hand it over.  But he pulled it free and set it on the counter between them.  Miss Potts picked it up, and the way she handled it made it clear that it wasn't her first time with a gun in her hand.  Her head tipped to the side.  “My, this has seen action.”  She gave him a quick, gamine smile.  “You've taken good care of it, but this has been used.  And often.”
Steve stroked his hair.  “His socialist parent is proud of him.”  Tony grumbled something at him, the words muffled by Steve’s sweatshirt.  Laughing, Steve kissed his head.  “You take care of him.  You’ll always take care of him.  And when he ran out of money?  He went looking for work.  He’ll be fine, Tony.”
Tony considered him.  “I was going to ask you that,” he said, his voice quiet.
“You're both children, you realize that, right?” he asked, as Tony collapsed back against him, laughing out loud now.
“I'll get it back,” Steve said, and Tony leaned over, pressing a kiss to his head.
“Here,” Natasha said, holding out a white paper box.  “A financier for our.. Financier.”
“Christmas,” DJ agreed.  He disappeared under the tree, coming up with an envelope and a big box wrapped in red and gold metallic paper.  He handed the envelope to Steve, who took it with a smile and pressed a kiss to his head.  “Christmas!”
“You can pay me back when we get-”
DJ just curled up tighter, his knees tucked against his chest, his fingers tugging hard at the fabric of his pants.
“All the better.” Happy straightened up. “Mr. Hammer! So you're my ticket to pretty girls and good times!” He thrust out a hand, catching Hammer's and pumping it up and down with a great deal of enthusiasm. Startled, Hammer just tried to hold on. “Knew you were a lucky fella, when I first saw you, I knew it.”
Steve stared out the front windshield of the car, turning that over in his head.  “Why?”
Fear could keep you alive, but it could also keep you trapped.  He supposed that really hadn't changed.  Maybe it never would.
“And Steve,” Carol added.  “The Council of Lesbians and Steve.”
“They were charging three dollars for a bag of Doritos,” Darcy said.  “Like, a lunch bag sized bag.  Who…  Who is buying that?”
“Food,” Steve specified.  Tony’s mouth opened, and he continued, “Not a smoothie.”
“Right.  Mistakes.  Mistakes were made.”  Tony took a deep breath.  “Won’t be made again.”
She paused.  “Tony-”
“The... Fountain?” Rogers repeated.
“Oui?” Clint paused, looked down at DJ, who fished a small brass nut from his pocket, holding it up with a broad smile.  Clint nodded.  “Oui.”
Trip smiled back.  “How do you know?”
“Right.”  Clint said, and it went on for a very long time.  Phil gave him a look over the top of his folder, and Clint bit off the end of the word.  “Right.”  He folded his arms over his chest, his fingers tapping against his bicep. “I mean.” He shrugged.  “Right.”
DJ stared down at his water bottle.  “It’s my fault we’re here,” he said, and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harris nod.
“So what did work?” Ellen asked.
Bruce's lips twitched.  “Who can do science when the blackberries are ripe?” he said, offering Tony one particularly plump specimen from the basket.  “The beakers will still be there tomorrow, but the berries might not.”

“Thor’s got a tray of them,” Steve said.  Halfway to the door, he stopped, and Sam almost walked into his back.  “Napkins?”
“I see it.”  Carol shot past him, a flare of light and color, and Tony fell into place behind her, watching for anyone who might be trying to catch them from behind.  “When we come in from the top, they're going to scatter like ants.”
Tony considered him.  “Naked except for an apron?” he asked, and Steve made a pained, helpless little noise.  “Right.  Come pick one out.”
He stopped, and pulled a bottle of beer out of the fridge.  He considered it, rolling the neck of the bottle between his fingers.  “Right.  I make bad choices.”
“Give it back.”
Steve stood there, something like a headache developing behind his temples.  "This place is a lunatic asylum," he muttered under his breath.
Tony's breath caught, a spike of heat going straight through him.  Steve's eyes tipped up to meet his, and if he was anyone else, Tony would've thought he was flirting.  “Thanks,” Steve said, his fingers brushing Tony's as he took the last bite of the spring roll.  Tony let him take it, hoping that his face wasn't as red as it felt.
Steve looked up, his eyes sharp beneath the hard line of his brows.  “You knew where he was going, and you knew what he was doing there,” he repeated.  “And when this is all over, and he’s being spoiled rotten by everyone in this building, we’re going to have a very long talk about why he didn’t tell you, and why you didn’t ask.”
“Good luck,” she said. “I think we're going to need it.”
Miss Potts laughed, short and sharp.  "No."  Her head shook.  "Not at all." She reached for her teacup.  "We're working at limited production right now, but we're working."  She considered Steve over the rim of the cup.  "When the world began to fall apart, when it was clear that things were going to be bad, after the first sequence of crashes, Tony gave the employees a choice, to keep everyone at limited shifts, at limited pay, or lay people off.
Jesse leaned in.  "Only if it's true.  Only if we can prove it."  Her dark eyes were alight.  "Wanna help me prove it?"
Her lips twitched.  “Extremely”
Tony shook his head.  “I'm not-” he started, just as the music started up again, a bright, warm sweep of notes.
“Uh-huh,” Darcy said, drawing that out.  “Right.”  There was some mumbled talking, and Harris’ eyes narrowed.
Shuri looked at Bucky.  “It was worse,” she said, her voice dire.
Tony waited until it settled into a steady, cool glow, tracing the cracks of the floor, revealing arcane symbols set into the pattern of the stones.  The light pulsed, like a heartbeat, like the tides, and he always hated that.  He resisted the urge to kick his foot across the stone, like a child in a puddle, just to see if the light would splash the same way.
Tony ignored him.  “Steve's...  Going to sell this.  I just have to remember that it's an act.  That it's not real, that it's not-”  He stopped, and took a deep breath.  “He's moving in.  I'll be spending the next couple of months in the workshop.”
DJ peeked out from under the terrycloth.  “Deal,” he agreed, grabbing Clint’s hand and giving it a firm shake.
The grand foyer of Radio City Music Hall was a cavernous space, built to awe and impress. Right now, every inch of the space was packed, and people were still pouring in, families in well-mended coats and carefully polished shoes, every one of them clinging tight to the StarkIndustries tickets that had gotten them past the staff manning the doors.
She straightened up.  “So do I.  So cut this shit out, Stark.”
The usher nodded.  “Yes, sir.  Of course.  I’ll be right back.”
The car pulled away from the curb, and Happy caught Steve’s eyes in the rearview mirror.  “We going to the police?”
“Really.”  Tony took the drink from him, but made no effort to drink it.  “And what is my problem?”
His voice trailed away, and Tony shifted in his arms, tucking his head under Steve's chin.  “You're leaving me for a bearded, melancholic poet, aren't you?” he mumbled.
“Hi, Steve!” Jan said, and it was a bit louder than he’d been expecting.
Jan’s whole face twitched.  “It’s not going to work, and also?  I already own a tiara.”
Tony's mouth opened. Closed. Steve kept smiling. “It's a special treat,” Tony managed at last.  “The movie.  Not the-”
“Not comforting,” Steve told him, but his grip was firm and strong and real and whatever was coming…
Steve appeared in the door.  “Bruce?  Cab’s here.”
“Let me get that,” Steve said, taking the wooden platter of cheese and meat from her.  Tony, for his part, put a foot on a stack of books that were taking up valuable real estate on the table, and shoved them to the floor.  Steve looked at him.  “Helpful.”
“If that's true, no wonder no one in this city dates,” Steve mumbled, right before the door to the Tower opened.
Steve looked down at the chopsticks, held easily between his fingers.  “Oh!”  He snapped the chopsticks at Tony.  “Morita taught me.”  He reached past Tony, sneaking a bit of pork from the rice with ease.  “We all got pretty good at it, except Falsworth.”  He shook his head.  “If he didn't have a proper fork in his left hand and a knife in his right, he was lost.”
“This-” Tony gestured at the kitchen, at the house, at the grounds beyond that.  “This is not your responsibility, Peter.  None of it.  It is mine.  This is my house, these are my people, this is my responsibility, and no one else’s.  It is my fault DJ wasn’t protected.  It is my fault YOU weren’t protected.
“Oh, I don't know,” Steve said, pretending to think about it. “Thought Pepper said something about a factory full of workers in your employ.”  He looked at Pepper, his expression innocent.  “Didn’t you say that?”
“Ask the man out, Rogers,” Sam said, picking up the pace.  He pumped a fist in the air.  “New year’s coming, let’s see what changes you can make in your life.”
For the first time in the last few days, something felt right.
Steve went by so fast that he was just a streak, a blur of brilliant color in the cold, gray light.  Tony blinked at the empty hall, confused.  “Steve?”
Pepper's mouth dropped open.  "You didn't," she said to Tony.
“You can have that one, the hole in the armpit’s getting pretty noticeable,” Clint said.  He bounced a bottle of food coloring off of the side of his elbow, sending it spinning through the air and back into the rotation.  “Like, more hole than armpit at this point.  The Cash shirt is fine, though.”
He shook off the thought, and headed down the hallway, his footsteps muffled on the carpet.  Halfway to the stairs, he caught a hint of movement out of the corner of his eye, and stopped, turning towards the windows.  From here, he had a full view of the back lawn, all the way down to the pond by the far end of the property.  Now that he was looking, everything seemed still, no hint of movement, and no one in view.  But something had moved.  Something had...
“Yeah, no, I…  I didn’t,” Tony said.  His head fell back as he stared up at the ceiling.  “Because now I have nothing but questions, and I’m doing my best not to ask any of them because I suspect that giving voice to certain chaotic concepts will lead to a complete breakdown of how I understand the universe.  And I think we all know that I have many excellent qualities, but tact is not on that list.”
“I owe you one,” he said, and Tony let his eyes roll up towards the ceiling.
“Can I kill him?” Bucky asked Steve, never taking his eyes off of Sam.
"Actually, they're quite useful for entertaining," Joy said, and Steve didn't like her, but he could almost admire her utter sincerity about everything she said.
"Yes, yes, I'll hide behind Carol," Jan said with a grin.
"Perception. When I was small, when I was undersized and underweight and generally the runt of the litter?" He smiled. "Man, did I hear things like that a lot. Slurs. Insults. Threats. It might shock you, but some of the citizens of 1930's New York made certain judgments about five foot nothing, angry art students. The moment I didn't fit the image of what a 'gay man' should be, then... I was exempt from that kind of judgment. The perception shifted.”
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river,
“Maybe not,” Harris said.  He dropped the spoon back into the empty soup cup and set it back on the tray.  “But it’s hard.”  He looked up.  “When you feel like you have no control.  And maybe the bus isn’t control, but it’s at least it’s something you choose.”’
Tony pressed a hand to his eyes.  “Steve-”
The water in the vase sloshed as he grabbed it, and the roses vibrated with every step he took back towards Tony, shivering in his grip, and he tried not to think of that, tried not think of any of it and then he was back at the front door, and Sam was there, but Sam had seen him do worse, Sam had absolutely seen him do worse and not said a word, he could do this he could do this he could do this.
“Not if I’m offering.”  She held out a hand, and he gave her an arrow.  “Well?”
Tony paused.  “Everyone?”
“I do apologize, but SHIELD reports that the repairs on the quinjet are nearly complete, and your presence is requested.”  The familiar voice, he now realized, was coming from the phone on the bedside table.  Tony's phone.  Steve picked it up.
The whole thing took less than fifteen minutes. The benefit, Tony supposed, to having a very efficient legal team.
“I think we both know what I like,” Steve said.  “And it’s mostly you.”  He pulled himself away, inch by painful inch.  “I’ll eat something.”
She nodded.  “Can I have-”
Steve opened his mouth, and closed it, unsure what to say.  "Oh, soup is good, everyone likes soup when they're not feeling well, but-"
“Let’s get out of here, before reinforcements arrive,” Steve gritted out, not sure how he’d gotten into this situation and even less sure how he was going to get out.
“A story.  Well.  Let’s see.  An old one, from the old country.  My ma told me, and her Ma told her, to stick to the paths,” Steve said, a hint of a brogue coloring the words.  “Hold fast your name.  Eat only the food you carry with you, and never take from a hand you do not know.  Never step into a ring of mushrooms.  Carry a bit of cold iron with you at all times, held close to your heart.”
The staircase flexed like an accordian, and Strange caught DJ by the elbow, lifting him away into the air before the stairs could collapse under them.  The wood parted, creaking as it did, and Clea poked her head up from between the boards.  “Drat,” she said, and disappeared again.
Sam nodded.  “Yes.  Yes, she would.  She takes her party planning seriously.”
“Clint and Thor and Sam-”
“Pepper doesn't wear glasses,” Carol said.
“The New York Post says I can’t,” Steve said, his thumb smoothing over the cold glass of the bottle.
“Staying by the phone?”
She reached for the remote.  “He's going to be fine,” she said, her voice kind.  “He's good at this.”  She glanced back at him, smiling.  “Even when I'm worried about him, this is...  This is comforting.”
The knock on the door, soft and efficient, brought his head up.
Steve leaned over, pressing an ice cold can against the side of Tony's neck.  Laughing, Tony batted his hand away, managing to snag the can from him.  He popped it open as Steve settled down next to him, setting the bag between them.   “Hi,” Tony said, grinning at him over the rim of the can.  “You smell amazing.”  He wiggled his eyebrows.  “Like garlic and hot grease.”
He set his bag down next to the table, settling it against the floor with care, always aware of how little separated him from those around him.  He took a seat at the table, leaning over to take off his shoes.  There were things he should do, and he didn’t care.
Steve dug his heels in. “We're not having sex in a public bathroom,” he said. But his face was flushed, his eyes huge and dark.
“It was a gift.  I didn’t ask where they got the design,” Steve said.  He squinted up at the awning.  “That doesn’t look much like a clock.”
Everything went still.  Steve rocked back on his heels, shocked by the violence in his own voice.  It echoed in the small space, hard edged and sharp.  Slowly, carefully, the dark haired young man looked up, his face blank.  His eyes were flat and wary,  and Steve tamped down on an unreasonable feeling of guilt, even as the watchmaker pushed his stool back from the counter, his face wary.
In the silence that followed, he tucked his hands in his pockets and wandered off towards the street.  “You'll be hearing from me.”  He glanced back over his shoulder at them.  “Soon.”
“Of course you do.”  Tony was about to say something else, when his eye caught something on the bottom of the box of books.  He leaned over, digging out the slim volume.  “Steve?”  Steve looked up.  Tony straightened up, holding a copy of 'Ouran High Host Club,' volume 8.  “Do we need to talk about this?”
“Your dad didn't put you-  I mean, he wasn't the one that packed you up, was he?” Val asked.  DJ shook his head.  Val's eyes narrowed, into thin slits.  When she did that, the blue disappeared, and it was just the dark hollow of her iris that showed.  “How did you get lost?”
Maybe this was worth it.  Worth anything.
“Ten bucks and a box of crab rangoon says I absolutely can,” Tony said, tossing a chopstick up and catching it in his fist, his thumb braced on the end.
“More things to dust,” Tony said.  He settled down on the chair.  “Mind if I take a look?”
“Everything in here is filthy, you want to just dump a bucket over the room, or do you want to take it outside and maybe avoid breathing some of it in?” Sam asked.  He looked into one of the pots.   “It wouldn’t be my choice, but-”
“Right,” he repeated, scrubbing a hand over his face.  “How long?”
“Because I am the only one who can make your toast the way you like it,” Jarvis said without missing a beat.
Bruce sank down into the chair next to the bed, his shoulders slumping.  “Well, for getting shot, not bad,” he said, giving Tony a wry smile. His hands hung down between his knees, his fingers flexing.  “The shot went wide.  Tore the skin, skimmed your ribs, but the damage is minimal.” He glanced down, then back up, meeting Tony’s eyes.  “You’ve got half a dozen new sutures, and you’re going to be, uh, well, sore as hell for a while.”
“Target identified.”
Like lightning along the length of his arm, straight to his heart, the power sizzled across his skin, lighting a hard, geometric pattern beneath his skin.  He focused on it, because he could understand that, he could feel that, the vicious strokes of an unseen pen that moved under his skin, moving straight to his breastbone.
“She absolutely can, and let’s not waste a good cover story,” Clint said, and Tony was right there with them, his hands on DJ’s shoulders, hustling him along ahead of him.  Harris glanced over, and DJ was staring down at his hands, still pressed together like he’d been interrupted in the middle of a prayer.  Smoke curled from between his fingers, like whatever was there was still burning, cradled in his palms.
DJ made a face, his nose wrinkling.  “Don’t understand a lot of it.”
“In a nearly sexual way,” Harris admitted.
“Dance lessons,” Luke said.  He clapped his hands together.  “Speaking of which, Steve, we're burning daylight here.  Let's go.”  He held out a hand, and Steve squared his shoulders.
The cat’s tail swung back and forth, and it settled down, the sharp bones of its legs shifting beneath the skin as if it was in the midst of changing shape.  Coulson sighed.  “I will file an official complaint about this, you know that I will.”
Harris considered that.  “I think I need another sandwich,” he said at last, holding up the crust of bread he’d managed to hold onto.
“I’ve got him.  Tony, do you feel up to having a drink?” Pepper asked.
“Where are you?” she repeated.  “I thought we'd be able to track you by the sound of the explosions, but there's been nothing, and your car's still here, and Jarvis says that all the armor is accounted for-”
"You must be DJ," she said, her lips twitching.
“Oh, I stretched while I was waiting for you,” Sam said, hands in the pockets of his windbreaker.  “Had some time.  I actually expected you to be moving a little earlier, honestly.”
Pepper's mouth opened.  She smiled.  “I think I've already found one,” she said.
“What are you doing here?” he snapped.  “Why aren’t you with him?”
“Because I think I have come to understand something that has been puzzling me for quite some time.”  Tony held up the pot, and she shook her head.  “No, thank you, it doesn’t agree with me.”
His eyes flicked up towards the ceiling.  “Fine,” he said, and Pepper exhaled, a sigh of relief that made him smile.  “Sorry, Pep.”
“Which is fairly obvious, as you spend your life alone, in a basement,” Steve said.  Pepper made a sound that might’ve been a choked off laugh.  Tony’s head snapped up, and Steve gave him a pleasant smile. “With the occasional visitor, who exists to be expelled as soon as possible.”
Because Steve was leaning against the side of the car, a massive bouquet held loosely in one hand.  As Tony stumbled to a stop, he straightened up.  “Hi,” he said, holding up the flowers.  Tony stared at it. White roses and holly, the bright red berries and glossy green leaves inter spaced with the silky white blooms.
“Well, I mean, if ‘pitching for the Dodgers’ is on there, we’re going to have some trouble, or maybe not, I’m rich enough that i can probably make that happen,” Tony mused.  “Not officially, the serum has to count as a performance enhancing drug, so there’s no way-”
Bruce studied the cookies.  “I’ll ruin my dinner,” he said.
He’d been here before.  Except, this time he was holding a child.
“Pete?” Steve braced a hand on his hip, trying to get some of the tension out of his shoulders.
It was a guess, but apparently a good one.  “Then off you go, Happy will meet you in the garage.”
“We sure as hell do now, if I'm expected to be a party planner as well as running your restaurant,” Pepper said.  “Especially if your guest list has this many holes in it.”
Tony shook his head.  “You’ll never be cold here.  Never be hungry.  Seldom bored.  There’s always something to do, and someone who’s doing something interesting, or something new or-”
“Gone back to the-”  Tony’s eyes went wide.  “Rogers.”  He grabbed her arm, and she bobbled the cup, nearly dropping it again.  He barely noticed.  “Where’s Rogers, did he-”
“He’s a gentleman,” Steve said, and had to skip to the side when Bucky tried, and failed, to kick him in the knee.  Grinning, he dropped back into his seat.  “So I was in a block of ice.”
“Glad that you’re not being petty about this,” Harris said.  “Like.  At all.”
Rogers nodded.  “Neither does DJ,” he said, his voice calm.  Controlled.  But there was tension in his shoulders, in his jaw, and even as he spoke to Tony, his eyes were moving, darting over the crowd, looking for something.  Looking for someone.  His gaze settled back on Tony’s face, and now Tony could see the desperation there, the hollow emptiness in his eyes.  “We…”  He stopped, his mouth working, but nothing else came out.
Sam looked at the door.  “That's Tony's room, right?”
She paused, one hand resting on the counter just in front of the overturned bottle.  “Really,” she said.  She picked it up by the neck, tipping the label towards the light.  “I could use one.” Her eyes came up to meet his.  “What’s in it?”
Jarvis's eyes closed for a second, an expression close to pain sliding across his mobile figures.  "Food should be many things, sir," he said, his voice stern.  "'Low effort' is not one of them."
Tony paused, turning to look back down at him.  “Shift some positions,” he said, his voice brisk and businesslike.  “Happy’s good at gathering information and unlike Rhodey, he honestly enjoys doing basic maintenance.  I have enough cars, he can putter happily for days just checking spark plugs and oil levels.  It’s certainly not hard to find things to do; he’s always been good at keeping himself out of trouble.  Or at least keeping himself out of sight, and honestly, that’s just as good.”
Tony, for his part, was curled up against the other end, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders and head, scraps of tin foil and white butcher's paper scattered around the floor next to him.  There was a smear of what appeared to salsa on his neck and he was wearing socks that Steve were pretty sure belonged to Bucky.
For a moment, Harris just stared at him, his expression confused.   “You..”  His eyes went wide.  “Oh.”
“Eating contest,” Jess said.
Steve gave a slight shrug.  "He's violating the law, and everyone knows it," he said.  He could hear the tension in his own voice, and he made a deliberate attempt to relax.  He'd wasted too much time looking for DJ, who'd disappeared before he'd woken up.  He was tired, frustrated and hungry, and that wasn't a good combination.  "I've got a duty-"
Clint stopped, holding the glowstick up between them.  “You ever hurt anyone?  Deliberately?”  She blinked at him, and Clint gave her hand a little shake.  “You ever even try to hurt anyone?”
“Sometimes,” Steve said.  “It's okay.  It means I know just where to find you.”
“I have one of my own at home and more research to do, so I will leave this one for you and Dr. Banner.”  She looked towards the elevator.  “Is it all right if I just leave?  Without walking out the door?”
Tony flinched.
Morrison leaned forward, a finger stabbing at the air between them. "People like me are why America is the greatest nation on earth, Captain. If it were up to people like you, we'd all be sitting around, trying to make sure everyone feels good before we bother making any progress."
Steve's head swung around, his gaze locking on Tony.  “Don't move,” he said, and he was already moving towards the stairs, his long legs eating up the distance in seconds.
Ellen threw her free hand in the air.  "Well, I've got no experience with it!  So yes!  This is weird!  And I don't trust it!"  She shoved the strap of her bag up on her shoulder.  "Meet me at the sandwich place, we need to plan."
Pepper turned towards the door.  “You can lie to me, Tony, but don’t start believing it.  That’s…  That’s when we’re in trouble.”
“Yes.”  In the silence that followed, Tony looked up.  Rogers was staring at him, his face unreadable.  Tony arched an eyebrow at him.  “Was that a trick question?  Because you asked, and I answered, and you're doing something with your face there.”  He gestured at Rogers with his screwdriver, rotating the tip in his direction.  “I'm not sure what it is, but I suspect that it's disrespectful, so...”
Sue nodded.  "Riiiiiiiiiiight," she said, drawing out the word.  "You.  Have a kid."
“So, you coming back tonight?”
“Expensive for ME,” Harris said, smiling at him.  He reached out, nudging the box of cereal.  “You, uh, do you want some milk or something?”
Tony told himself he absolutely wasn’t blushing.  “Thank you,” he repeated, and mouthed, ‘get out.’
“Do we do bonus checks?” Tony asked.
“Thanks, I guess.” Steve looked at the door.  “Okay, then.  I’ll get coffee, and we can ignore reality for another thirty minutes.”
“This isn't helping,” Steve said.
“I’m aware,” Tony said.  He stared at the phone on his desk, willing it to ring.  “So give me the basics, Obie.  We’ve started fabrication on the new design?”
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.”
“I can-” Steve started, as May scooped DJ out of Tony’s arms.
“That's your defense?  For avoiding something that would definitely improve your business?  Something easy and close and barely costing you anything in time, effort, or money?  Your defense is simply 'Atlantic City?'”
“Indeed,” Jarvis said, his voice tart.  He looked back at DJ.  “Do convey my greetings to him.”
“I’ll take ‘em.”  Steve turned back to her.  “Is this what Mr. Stark hired you for?”
“Right.”  Steve paused for a second, pouring himself a cup of coffee.  “I'll see if I can drag him out of bed.”
"Yes, and the beef wellington," Jan said.  "This is costing you a fortune."  She sounded gleeful.
Tony forced a smile into place.  He was good at that.  He'd had a lot of practice, after all.
O'Brien gave him a lopsided smile.  “Make us proud.” He went back to his paperwork.  “Good luck.”
“I’m an old woman, so perhaps something a bit on the slower side?” May folded her apron and set it on the back of a chair.  She dusted her hands together, firm and   “Officer?”
Bruce nodded.  “I wouldn't blame you, and I wouldn't be surprised.”  He slipped through the door, pulling it shut behind him.
Rhodey opened one eye.  "You're lazy," he said, his voice laconic.  He closed his eyes again, a smile curving his lips.  "You're used to things working the first time, and if they don't, you toss 'em on the trash heap."
“You know how to samba?” Carol asked her, her eyebrows arching.
“For the last time,” Coulson said, drawing Tony’s gaze to the front of the chapel, “this is not Men in Black, and I do not have the ability to wipe your memory.”
Slowly, he turned. “Parker…”
Steve took it.  “I’m not sure I’m up for that job.”
“I shall surround myself with orphans,” Tony said. Steve opened his mouth, and Tony gave him a long suffering look. “I will be fine on my own for five whole minutes, Steve, but if we come back short one child, I have no doubt that Hammer will charge us full price, so-”
“Well, if you're not frolicking, what is your plan?” Tony asked.  He reached for a wrench.  Maybe a little bit of physical labor would get his head back where it should be.  He doubted it, though, Rogers was already taking up more space inside his brain than he should.
Steve blinked.  “Is…  Is that a good thing?” he asked.  DJ nodded.  Steve nodded back.   “What is-”
She tossed her hair with a flick of her head.  “Thanks for noticing.”
His hand came up, and the light caught on the gun in his hand.
DJ grinned.  "Yes," he said, and Tony choked on a laugh.
Miss Potts nodded.  “But you want me to choose him anyway.”
"I paid for this suit, so I don't have to give anyone free advertising, thank you,” she said without missing a beat.  “I can tell you, however, that I am sporting the newest StarkWatch.”
“Try it,” Bucky said.  “I can outride you.”
The door opened up behind him, and something went over his head, settling around his neck.  Tony looked down.  Steve's dogtags gleamed, silver and rough, against the black fabric of the undersuit.  And there, tucked between the tags, was the platinum ring.  Tony's head snapped up, and Steve was smiling at him.  “There,” he said.  He held up his hand.  “I've got mine.  And you've got yours.”  He headed up the street. “Get the armor and let's go.  Your late for the debrief.”
There was the sound of applause from behind them, and he twisted around.  The two girls who had brought him here were both watching, their hands clasped together, wearing identical grins.  An older woman leaned her folded arms on the top of a sign, her long gray braids wrapped around her head like a wreath.  Two men, wearing the olive drab outfits of soldiers, stood nearby, one with his arms looped around the other from behind.
“I love that you say 'that shirt' like there's only one.”
Tony heaved a sigh.  “Yeah.  I know.”  He reached out, and caught Steve’s hand in his, tangling their fingers together.  “His parents came for him.”
He had a split second to see the shock roll across Tony’s face, to see his eyes go wide, and then Steve was dragging him into the room.  “Are you out of your mind?” he hissed, casting a desperate glance up and down the hallway.  It was deserted, not even old man Currothers peeking out from behind his door.  Steve shoved his own door shut, locking it with hands that shook.
"But otherwise, spot on," Tony agreed.  He tried to roll over, batting ineffectively at Bucky's leg.  "God, stay on your own side, you-"
The neighborhood had sustained some damage, but a block or so away, the affects were much less obvious.  Here and there, people peered out their windows and shop owners cautiously unlocked their front doors.  Tony waved at everyone he passed, making a show of his presence.  Either it would help them feel a bit more secure, or it would give them a focus for their ire.  He didn't really care.
Jan considered that, her lips pursed.  “Fair,” she said at last.  She reached into her bag.  “Before I forget, I have something for you.”  After a moment, she came up with a small case.  “Here.  For you.”
The stairs were narrow and winding, and they swayed in front of him, twisting in ways that didn’t make sense.  He blinked hard, trying to make his eyes focus, trying to force things back to normal.  Normal.  He didn’t know what it meant anymore.  He didn’t know how to make things make sense, and it was..
“Yeah, but I thought he'd have more sense, and more frugality,” Tony said. “I dropped a glass in the living room once and he came running out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel, ready to fight whatever villain had managed to hide under the piano.” He scraped a hand over his face. “And that... That didn't break me.”
“I’m fine,” Tony said, his attention already on the small notebook in his hand.  Steve made a humming noise under his breath, and Tony swatted at his hand with the book.  “Off.”
“Yes, sir, it’s Charlie at the front desk, sir,” he said, and he sounded exhausted and terrified and totally done with this situation, all at once.  “You have a visitor, sir.”
Rhodes paused, a slight, amused smile flickering across his face.  “Literally.”
“A little stressed, because she's currently fielding multiple inquiries about your marriage.”
She moved Harris’ plate towards DJ so he could take a fruit tart, tiny and almost glowing under a thin glaze of melted sugar.  It smelled like summer, the strawberries almost painfully red.  He took a small bite, letting the sugar melt across his tongue.  “It’s going to be okay,” she said, her voice soft, and DJ’s eyes stung.  He blinked hard, and let them stay closed, savoring the taste of flaky, buttery pastry and strawberries.
“At least someone told us what was happening, because you clearly weren’t interested,” Natasha said.  “Or at least, you were less interested in talking to us than you were in smashing things.  And getting smashed.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Steve said.
He had a sudden and overwhelming vision of Steve in one of StarkIndustries more formal and overwhelming board rooms, the table piled high with profit and loss statements and charts showing a failing business.  But Steve was grinning at him, rough and wicked, his fingers wrapping around Tony's tie and tugging him forward, confident in his ability to secure continued funding, despite all financial sense.
She crossed her legs, her head tipped to the side as she considered that. “Because Hill wanted him here.”
Strange’s chin came up, his mouth going tight.  “You are only making this more difficult, and you-”
Steve took a breath.  "No," he said, and he tried to smile.  He needed to smile.  "Tony is bi.  I'm gay."
“Trust me,” Nebula said, scowling at her work.  “You don’t.”
“I'm sensing you're feeling a certain level of ambivalence towards this particular gift.”
“Help me out here, Nicodemus,” Tony said, striding into the SHEILD boardroom.  “You cannot tell me you didn't know that the US Government was taking some serious style tips from Doctor Doom.  You can't tell me this.  I won't believe it.”  He threw himself into a seat, his legs bouncing out in front of him.  “So.  What the fuck.”
“And you need no encouragement, and besides...”  Jan stood, brushing her short skirt into place.  “Us working girls need to stick together.  Don't we, Miss Potts?”
Tony gave him a hard look.  Bucky shrugged and reached for the plate.  “Okay, I'll just balance 'em on the handlebars.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Absolutely not.”
“They are two very intelligent men who have each independently come to the unwelcome realization that they cannot control or protect the other, a situation that is both unfamiliar and uncomfortable for them,” Jarvis said, without missing a beat.  “But since they cannot verbalize that particular train of thought, that is not actually what they’re discussing right now.”
“Better now that I no longer have to hold myself from bludgeoning a wizard to death with whatever comes to hand,” Tony said.  “Because when it comes to things capable of inflicting blunt force trauma, the workshop is an embarrassment of riches.”
“Well, you’re the one who dropped it and made that chip,” Jarvis told him.  “I see no reason to trust you with another.  The same thing will just happen again, and we only have so many dishes, sir.”
“Yeah, it's gonna suck, either way,” Bucky agreed.  He didn't sound particularly sympathetic.  He nudged his stool away from the counter.  “Can I get a to-go box for the rest of these?”
Rhodey reached out, his fingers gentle as he caught Tony’s wrist, pulling his hand away from his chest.  Tony looked down, surprised to find that his fingers were locked in a deathgrip on the fabric of his shirt.  He let go with a wince, and let Rhodey pull his hand down.  “I’m fine,” he repeated.
Sue watched him go.  "Magic," she said, her head rolling in Tony's direction.
DJ took the screwdriver out of his mouth.  “Didn't trust him,” he said, tapping the tip of the screwdriver against the metal plate.  His head tipped to the side, his eyes falling closed as he repeated the gesture, flicking the screwdriver against the plating, and Tony wondered what he was listening for.  “He was...”  His eyes opened, and he blinked at Tony.  “Made you sad.”
“That won’t be long, with my little demons.”  She hugged the box to her chest.  “You’re a good boy,” she said, and Steve couldn’t help but smile at her.  “I’ll ask a blessing for you at Mass next week.”
“No one believes you, Tony,” Moondragon said.
“Can you say good-bye to Sue?”
“Tell him I’m not here,” Tony said, as Jan groaned.
Steve subsided, his shoulders tight.  “Yes.  Yes, I do.”  Around the table, everyone was silent, and Steve took a deep breath.  “So.  How do we stop them?”
Nat drove.
“I tried to get some Charlie Pride going on here, but no one listens to me,” Luke said.  He scuffed a foot across the floor with a great deal of aplomb.  “Jessica!”
"So glad you managed a clean shirt for this," Pepper told him, her voice tart.  But there was a smile on her face, her eyes dancing as she turned back to the reporters.  "If no one has any other questions for Tony about our product line, I'm going to turn this back to Marcy Pearson.  You all remember Marcy, right?  Our VP of marketing?"
Tony exhaled.  “No.  You wouldn’t.”  He reached out, his hand closing on one of hers, and it was so small.  He marveled at that, every time, how small her hands were, and how strong they were despite that.  “We have a few days.  Let me see... “  He leaned forward, his forehead brushing against hers.  “I’ll figure something out.”
"Good try," Steve said, making another grab for his shirt, and Billy ducked under his hand, popping back up on the far side of Pepper. Steve gave him a look. "Billy."
