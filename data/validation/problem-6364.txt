Tony reaches absentmindedly for another bite of hash browns and startles when his fork clangs loudly against the plate. He hadn't even realized he'd already cleared most of his plate; he must've been hungrier than he'd thought. "So," he says, clearing his throat. "Are you guys just...planning to stay here forever? Make babies, plant a garden?" Natasha's glare intensifies. "Or...not. I mean, that arrangement probably wouldn't work out very well anyway. I mean – I kind of have no brain-to-mouth filter, so ignore everything I'm saying. Just – are you guys...settling down here? No Great Migration or anything?"
Natasha just purses her lips in a flat line and shakes her head, looking at him like he's the most unremarkable person on earth. "Someone who doesn't know how to let people die." Then she turns around again and leaves.
"Thor Odinson," booms the muscular blond guy. His deep voice matches his outward persona; Tony will have no problems remembering him.
"It might be nice to have someone else to discuss science with," Bruce speaks up tentatively. He offers a sheepish smile. "Sorry, Clint. I do agree that it's a lot, taking on another person. But we're a group of seven already. And Stark's written some pretty compelling papers on thermonuclear dynamics."
disconnected from the world.  Back in 1944, plenty of dames had stolen a kiss or two.  And of course, there was Peggy.  But...this was different.  Tony was different.  Tony made him
"No!" the blonde burst out before he could filter himself, and the smile he so loved burst forward on Tony's face again.
"Waiting?" Steve says, smiling back.  "Sorry, Tony, I should've told you you didn't have to.  Oh - hold on, this is Sharon Carter. Sharon, Tony. Tony, Sharon."
He manages to roll to the side right as the zombie coughs its diseased blood all over where he'd just been. Red spatters the tiles and it makes a desperate keening noise as its hands tremble around the grip of the knife in its body. As it arches in pain, baring its neck, Tony spots the discolored bite in the ruined meat of its shoulder. He quells the chill that runs up his spine at the sight of it.
Tony glances up at him.  He doesn't smile but his eyes are warm as they land on Steve's, and a hot little curl of shame winds up in the blonde that he can't explain away.  "Just fixing Mark VII's breastplate," he says, shrugging. "Got dented up in our last fight."
this chap is 7k. i really like fics with less (but longer) chapters so i'm trying to do that for this one. also taking online exams is such a mess... i'm posting rn to console myself because i had like 80 technical issues during an important test and i feel really down now about what i think my grade will be
They don't need to say anything; sunlight filters idly into the bedroom and catches on the edges of Tony's hair, turning it gold around the edges.  It looks like an aura, softening the edges of his body. To Steve, he is beautiful like this - open and vulnerable in the morning light, still pliable with sleep, eyes wide and brown with dark amber flecks.
Tony has to go past Steve to get a mug, but Steve tenses when he does, spins Tony around with a hand to the shoulder.  Tony jerks for a second, almost like a flinch, but then he stumbles back and Steve realizes it's only because he'd knocked him off balance.  "Were you drinking?" he says, voice a little colder than he means it to be. He can smell it now, sharp and acidic, especially with his heightened serum-enhanced senses.  "Is that why you didn't go to sleep, Tony?"
Then they have a battle and it is Doombots, and it is easy, and Steve can fight them with one hand.  Iron Man and Captain America fall back into their easy routine, although Iron Man is a lot less chatty on the comms than usual.  Captain America does not question it - they are soldiers, they fight. They have time for conversation later.
Gun in one hand and map in the other, he treads through the woods until he reaches the side of the highway he'd been traveling on yesterday. His legs ache, but at least it's good exercise; any softness he'd had before the apocalypse has completely disappeared. Back in the second month, when people were still trying to adjust to the fantastic notion of "zombies" and Howard hadn't yet kicked him out, he'd gone out in his Audi R8 and driven through the city pretending to be a Formula One racer. Those days of fun are long gone, though; none of the cars have any gas left in them and most have been abandoned by the roadside or utterly demolished.
He doesn't trust Natasha or her companion to go through his stuff again, even if they hadn't seemed to take anything that didn't pose a threat, so he straps the watch around his wrist before hobbling towards the doorway.
The woman walks up next to him and inspects his bandages with a critical eye. Whatever she sees there must satisfy her, because she nods her head and turns away. "Lay back down. You need rest."
Steve frowns.  "I talked to Wanda on the phone yesterday, you know.  You don't have to... do this.  Worry about me."  (Wanda's not doing well either, from what he can discern.  There's a Vision-shaped hole in her heart that never did get filled.)
he's grateful beyond words to have his best friend back.  But nowadays Buck spends more time in Sam's home than here, and there is such a thing as feeling lonely amongst people who
For a second, Steve thinks back to their fight with Ultron.  It's the only fight that's really stuck with him - besides the Battle of New York - although he
"So that's Tony Stark, huh?" Sharon says, watching as the billionaire easily weaves through the crowd.  "Iron Man?"
His head spins, and his vision blackens so much that he has to lay back down. Great… So this is how he is going to die. Alone, in the middle of a destroyed Rite Aid, surrounded by bodies.
"Tony."  Steve pulled back abruptly, and hurt flashed through the billionaire's eyes for a quick second.  "Tony.  You.  Are the most.
That's another thing - after Ultron, Tony stopped sleeping in Steve's bed so much.  Steve found him in the workshop one night, curled up on the couch, but hadn't wanted to wake him up - they both needed the rest.
"Yeah, okay," Tony says, "but I'll find a way to make it up to you. Promise." He holds up a finger before Steve can continue with whatever he was about to say. "Nuh uh. You don't get to tell me what to do. I'll find something eventually. What gets your blood pumping, huh? Let me guess – weaponry? Something that makes you feel big and strong, something that makes you feel like you can protect everybody. Sure, fine, easy peasy, I can do that. I'm a Stark, after all. Or – maybe you've got a secret soft side. What is it, then, music, art, reading?" He pauses for a breath and examines Steve's nonplussed expression. Encouraged by the lack of open hostility, he continues. "My resources are limited, obviously, but I can probably get you an audiobook or some good tunes. Not sure what I'd do about art, but I'm sure I can think of something."
"Never mind." He waves a hand airily. "I don't want to take up too much of your time. I know you've got" – what
Steve is grateful for one small mercy.  Tony hides his drink well now, nowadays.  He cannot smell the old whiskey in the cabinets anymore, although he's gotten an odd whiff from some strange places.  Tony must be trying to put them out of the way of Steve as much as possible, and for that he is grateful.
He rests his head against the pavement and closes his eyes. The last thing he remembers thinking is that he hopes whoever finds him is kind enough to bury his body.
Rhodey just gave him a long look before he finished pouring himself a glass of milk and joined his friend at the table.  Tony wrinkled his nose.  "Milk?  Again?  I don't know how you drink that stuff."
"It's the way you look at him," his best friend said simply.  "And the way you talk to him, or about him.  Even if
"That's because the serum heightened your senses," Tony says, but his frown is directed at the lasagna.  "I swear, Steve, only a little. That's it."
Steve agrees, but only because the way he grew up still makes him uncomfortable, this idea of two men together.  And, of course, it's Tony. Tony doesn't need any more of the publicity that would come with sleeping with Captain America.
The rest of the afternoon passes nicely, and it's only when blue skies start to meld into evening that Bucky and Sam finally stand from their seats on the couch and bid Steve a good night. "Take care of yourself, man," Sam says kindly, "and remember, you're always welcome to stay at the apartment."
The stairs take time to conquer, and he has to pause several times when the throbbing in his chest increases, but he finally makes it to the top. He finds himself staring out at the deserted ruin of what appears to be the remnants of a county building.
Tony nods, running a thumb along the ridges of the wrist watch. This is it – this is his whole life's legacy right here on his arm. At one point in the Before, he would've been satisfied with that; but now, he thinks that he could do more. Getting Steve a sketchbook could be a start. "Yeah. That'll be all, JARV."
A woman is standing in the doorway, watching him coolly. She has fiery red hair and sharp green eyes and she's absolutely fucking stunning. "Wow," he blurts, because he has no brain-to-mouth filter, and sue him, the pain's making him loopy. "Am I in heaven?"
"I like Matisse," Steve responds, his voice lilting up at the end like he's asking a question. "Um, off the top of my head, also Kandinsky and Basquiat."
After breakfast, Tony pulls Steve aside. Steve goes tense at the fingers wrapped around his elbow but says nothing. Tony hastily drops his hand. "Um, I just wanted to thank you," he says quickly, staring up at that very blue gaze. He feels like he's looking up at the sky. "For doing the morally-opposed feat of saving my life."
During movie nights, Tony starts to curl away from him, hugging the side of the couch instead with his knees drawn up to his chest.  Clint and Natasha notice but don't say anything - how could they, they only think Steve and Tony are friends after all - and Steve doesn't either.  He starts forgetting what it's like to see Tony laugh at him and tug his shirt to pull him in. He starts forgetting what it was like to want that.
Tony wills Steve to glance at him, if only so he can put on the most apologetic expression he can offer, but Steve's eyes never stray to his. Tony ducks his head, training his gaze on the plate in front of him.
"So," Tony said carefully, slowly.  In the dim lighting, his face looked like something out of a Picasso painting, everything just planes of shadow and light.  "Apparently Natasha really enjoys beating the crap out of Clint in laser tag.  It's only been a week and she's already dragged us back."
he thinks drowsily, and there's a metallic whine and something heavy clunking over to him, the sound of knives flinting together, hands over his body and lowering him to the ground and a male voice saying,
a person like that?  There are tons of people who can get drunk but don't get addicted, or people who don't even drink at all.  So why his dad? Why Tony's? Why
"I don't know," Tony says, his voice a little strained.  He comes over to Steve but hovers there, like he's afraid to move any closer.  "I'm serious. I don't know. I just saw it and I thought, why not? I couldn't focus.  I kept thinking about things. I have to
The zombie lets out an inhuman moan and lurches forward, swinging a fist. Tony ducks, landing an uppercut in his opponent's gut. He sweeps his leg out in a kick that sends the zombie flat onto his back and stumbles over to his bag, grabbing it by the straps.
"How have you been doing, Steve?" Sam asks with a gentle smile, and with a sudden jolt Steve realizes that there is pity in that expression that he has never seen before on his friend's face.  He watches the way Bucky's eyes flick up, scanning him, and sees in his mind's eye how Bucky must curl up in Sam's bed on warm nights and tell his lover about how Steve seems so damn lonely and how he worries.  It leaves a bitter taste in Steve's mouth, because he's doing fine.
The hours go by as he treks along the road. He moves slowly; there's no need to hurry, it's not like he's got anything to run from anymore. He doesn't know how long it's been since he picked up his things and exited the woods, but it's been long enough that his back grows hot and he has to strip off his jacket.
"Is everyone else...okay?" he whispers, just as a nurse comes bustling into the room and fussing around his bed.  He slumps back onto the pillows as she raises the bed up a little more, letting her do as she pleases.
Steve was having enough trouble keeping up with everything and adding this just made Steve’s head spin.
A sigh, something akin to relief left his lips as he realised that tony was not just uninterested in his class but it was a general thing but also that he was indeed a really smart kid.
“It gives you better access, see I am being good” he said waving an arm at himself and Steve just rolled his eyes as he carefully peeled the wrap open. Tony watched silently as Steve pulled it apart. It was clear that he was nervous about something but Steve didn’t comment on it.
He reached lower pulling Tony’s briefs off completely while his legs practically shook and Steve needed to reassure him and get him back to the present.
He quickly strode into the cramped space , dropping down next to his sick lover hands reaching over soothe his back .
Tony tucked his head back against his neck and sighed and Steve turned his head just slightly towards Tony’s ear and said quietly “I am sorry I didn’t realize sooner but we will find a way to help you feel better"
“good boy" the praise slipped out without any filter from his brain and Tony crooned eithout realizing at his words and Steve’s amusement grew tenfold as he watched Tony’s face littered with emotions.
Neither said anything as he heated up the left over pot roast with Tony still in his arms and he placed Tony on the table and trapped him there by wedging himself between Tony’s legs.
“Okay how about you tell me what you think is going to happen?” Tony wouldn’t even meet his eyes but Steve waited with the utmost patience until his eyes finally settled on a spot beside Steve’s head.
“Tony, hey you need to let go of him , he’s going to be fine okay? He needs medical and so do you come on , let go, he’s okay"
“you know why tony” he said running his fingers through his hair as they settled down. “But I want you to know, as long as you want it I want it too okay?” he gave a frustrated sigh trying to find a comfortable position.
Tony , seeing bruce only panicked a little. His movements turned jerky and Steve knew he was about to have a panic attack. He was somewhat sure it was because he was worried what Bruce would think seeing them like this.
Bruce seemed a little more excited at the prospect of Steve helping tony through this than Steve would have thought.
“just two?” he tried and nope, Tony was not having it he quickly got up and backed away from the bed as Steve fished out the suture material.
I sat down next to Tony on the other side and Bruce settled on the edge of the coffee table in front of Tony.
“is it only physical or have they been sexu-“ Steve froze, it hadn’t even occurred to him and when tony pursed his lips Steve dreaded the words that were going to come out of his mouth
“Done, it’s done!” steve exclaimed “it’s out sweetheart, you are okay" he said trying to get his attention but tony was still a crying mess and in the process he had managed to pull out the IV in his arm as well which had left blood trickling across his hand.
this always happens, steve is used to it. He doesn’t care for it  but somehow today he just took it. He wanted the distraction, any distraction for that matter that would keep his eyes from wandering over to Tony who also sat in the same cafeteria , nose into a book while pepper and rhodey talked over him.
“Tony did you forget your boyfriend’s day job? Sweetheart I am not going to let him touch you" he said confidently and Tony settled against him silently for the rest of the ride home.
“Sure, why don’t l get you some highly caffeinated energy drink while I am at it" he said walking out towards the kitchen .
“We can head there now" bruce said as natasha paid off their coffees and Steve suddenly felt very nervous about taking Bruce to meet Bucky. He had already met nat and Clint but it always made him nervous to meet new people especially after what happened with tony. Steve had a distinct feeling that Bucky has still not stopped beating himself up about it.
“Go, steve . We will handle this lunatic.” Clint said and Steve didn’t need to be told twice as he took off in a jog towards medical.
Steve was honestly starting to get tired now. Two more days and the three weeks they had set the time limit to would be over. The team would come for him in just two more days.
“ can I go home ?” He asked looking at Clint avoiding Steve’s gaze again and trying to pull away from Steve.
”take the time you need and give the button another ring ,I’ll come back for the IV" she said and left
“I know things happened yesterday. And I know what it looked like and I need you to hear my explanation. But that doesn’t me you have to forgive me for it.”
Steve had quickly pulled me towards the kitchen table sitting next me while Bruce and Clint occupied the ones opposite to us.
Over the next few days Steve had only two things that kept kept spiralling back to his mind even though he had tried very to distract himself. One, why was Steve so amused by this fifteen year old and two, why had tony flinched. Of the two , Steve decided the more worrisome one was his fascination with tony , that sudden need to obliterate the cause for the flinch. Something had obviously frightened him that day and Steve didn’t like the idea of it. This lead to the first thought again, why was Steve so bothered by this? The cycle went on and on relentlessly in his head. He gave in two days later when he decided that it was okay to keep a subtle eye on the kid, nothing creepy ,just doing his job of making sure his students were okay. Or that’s what he told himself.
“Kay!” it didn’t sit right with Steve that Tony was even the least bit upset with Steve. Or tony was getting very good at hiding it. He put the cups and spoon down on the movable tray and pushed it over Tony’s bed as he heard the flush.
They met in a café nearby to the school and Steve was glad they had actually met them , steve didn’t stay because he wanted tony to go back to his normal life as soon as possible and he didn’t want to be shadowing him everywhere.
“Mr. Rogers don’t be so hard on the kids" nat said as she walked over with a syringe that had Tony crawling back towards the end of the bed.
“At Tony’s , what’s going on?”  he heard the distinct sound of Hawkeyes battle cry on the other end and the hair on his neck stood up as his ears strained to listen for more
“okay, will see you in ten.” He said cutting the call as he made his way over to the duffel bag that just seemed to be grower bigger in size. Again probably courtesy of clint.
Thirty minutes later Steve decided to save Tony from a back ache after sleeping on the desk. He locked his door and walked over the lightly snoring teen.
He walked over in quick strides, avoided touching him and holding out a hand to stop pepper from doing so. He crouched down to Tony’s eye level , he had his eyes screwed shut.
It took all of Steve’s willpower to give his boyfriend the space he needed to recuperate before the debrief.  Just as the team assembled at the conference room, settling down into their chairs steve looked around at his team taking it all in, making mental notes.
“No please”  he said , and Steve knew he was going to cry but Steve was being reminded all over about how he had made him cry that night.
“I want you to be able to tell me what you want. I don’t want to hear what you think it is that I want to, are you listening?” he asked as he felt Tony nod .
Steve then stripped him off the towel leaving him completely naked and Tony immediately reached for the sheets to cover himself up but Steve pulled those away too. He was going to get the nurses to have everything changed anyways.
Tony presses his knuckles to his forehead and props his elbows up on his knees, breathing hard. In this moment he hates himself so violently that he is suffocating in the sheer feeling of it. He would not have saved someone who was dying; he would not have even hesitated, probably, to leave that person behind.
He leaves Clint and Nat to themselves and stops momentarily by the kitchen, packing up a plate of still-warm lasagna and a glass of milk to bring down for Tony.  Tony likes milk, which is a simple fact but yet something that not many people know about the engineer. When he's not drinking coffee, or boozing around, he's drinking milk, and Steve finds it incredibly endearing.
"okay, let's not prolong this more than we have to" Bruce said "can you take off the shirt so I can see the burn?"
“Shit" clint mumbled and surprisingly thor was the first one to move but the moment thor turned to go Steve held him back, shaking his head
steve nodded mechanically , the information going to his head but he wasn’t really understanding them yet as he watched them carefully lift Tony and move him to his original bed and connected all the equipment back. Tony was oblivious to the world and his chest rose and fall with every breath the ventilator took for him and Steve was just happy to see that.
“What time is it ?! We have to go to school" he groaned and moved to get up buy Steve gently held him in place
He frowned as he watched the sun rise enough for the rays to reach Tony through the window, falling over his face and Steve shifted just a little so his back obstructed the light from hitting Tony in the face.
“What is this thing that no one can help with?” He asked him folding his arms around his chest giving him a stern look
“these things happen more often than not. But its nothing I cant handle okay?” Tony nodded wrapping his hands around Steve neck and Steve pulled him a little closer allowing Tony to rest his cheek on Steve’s chest.
Three months , Steve had managed things and he was proud of how he was handling it. At least he could finally see reason now, as opposed to the first time he stormed into fury’s meeting with nat and Clint.
Because, it's been an absolute mess! I myself had no clue where It was going. But i have thought it over and would like to give it another go!
“So, astrophysics exhibit is code these days for making out huh?” Steve said as he tried to ease the tension a little.
Steve’s eyes snapped up to meet Tony’s and Clint was right ,his pupils were blown . Immediately kneeling down I’m front of Tony steve reached out to feel his skin , he was burning up.
He didn't however have much time to think about it because he had been roped into a meeting the next morning , that was already on it's third hour now.
also reeling from the fact that tony had confessed to him that he liked him and not just in a professor kind of way.
A few minutes of comfortable silence followed and Steve knew he had to be the one to break it. In so many years he had avoided one thing, to find peggy. It’s not that he didn’t want to, he just felt so out of place , a new world he needed to get used to and ofcourse the one reason he really didn’t want to find her was for the fear that if peggy had moved on then Steve’s presence would only complicate things.
He eased a hand down into his waistband, and Tony bucked grasping at Steve’s forearms that was wrapped around his waist to hold him still.
He looked about ready to pass out and Steve gently pulled his legs closed and layed down next to him pulling him close , wrapping his arms around the teen.
"The Lion king" Thor explained much too excitedly. I sighed, It must have been his turn to pick the movie. Thor was a sucker for animal movies with happy endings.
The touch woke him up, he opened one eye and decided the brightness was too much and Steve switched off the lights before going to occupy the chair hoping tony would actually wake up and not go back to sleep.
“Rogers, I need a favor. There’s a girl who collapsed in the gym and the nurse is on leave today. Heard you were the go to medical guy" the gym teacher said, he sounded out of breath like he had just run here to get Steve and that told him that this may be serious and he quickly followed him back to gym.
“Yes, because that’s what a teenager needs when he is dead on his feet from exhaustion and doped up on painkillers" he said chuckling as he got up from the couch Tony in his arms.
“Nice place” he commented when Steve opened the door for them and tony stood in the center , looking around unsure what to do.
Steve had woken him up a few minutes ago and ushered him with all the care to the bathroom after he had filled the tub and had a nurse wrap over his bandages so they wouldn’t get wet. But getting tony to stay still became a whole different ball game.
He realized he was lying against someone their small thin fingers going through his greasy dirty hair . His first guess would have been natasha if it was not for his vision which finally cleared and he saw nat and Clint talking to a shield mmedic. His face caught up faster than his brain did when he turned his head a sluggish grin on his face as he eyes met Tony’s. He was lying against Tony and it seemed like the little brunette was putting in all the efforts to hold his dead weight.
“to my place” he said casually as he watched tony almost choke on his sandwich and Steve slowed down so he could drink some soda.
Steve didn’t say anything, he just stared at him, needing to know if Tony really didn’t know or if he was keeping this from him.
she threatened but even before she could mention the threat Tony took the four long steps towards her throwing his arms around her and Steve did the same but kept his distance from the two knowing natasha would need the support due to her injury.
He was wearing white briefs and Steve smiled but it immediately fell short when he noticed the red stains on the right bottom of hem of his briefs.
“If you are being abused, you have to tell me. This is not okay on any account tony. Look at me please” he said squeezing his right hand.
“oh sweetheart” Steve melted against him chest touching chest his hand still pressed firmly but flat over his nipple. He caught the blush on Tony’s face just before he managed to tuck into Steve neck. The sudden realization of what he had just done did not help his growing erection. He groaned inwardly slapping himself in his head.  Tony all but sagged in his hold his body trembling  and Steve didn't know if it was from pleasure or fear.
Bruce sighed knowingly ,”I understand,  you can stay until Tony is under and then you can either watch from the gallery or wait outside, he won’t be conscious to know" steve smiled at him gratefully as they made their way back.
"No, but I am going to put ice on it as soon as am done with you" he said as he tugged me back towards the bed. I pushed him gently onto it and his hands locking into my hair my hands working the buttons on his pants.
"Its almost half past three. I thought we could head up together for lunch." it already lunch time?I could have sworn I just came down after breakfast.
“there is a Mr.Stark in medical and the doctors told me to get you because he is refusing treatment and seems hysterical.” Steve’s heart was already hammering
"it's not my fault, the bed was extra warm yesterday" I said running my hand up and down Steve's thigh under the table. He blushed a bright red, pecked me on the lips and got up from his chair.
Standing at their designated points, their weapons at ready, Steve’s heart lurched when he saw the man they were after. Clad in all black, his hair long and brown eyes that were unmistakably his best friend’s.
He was looking at Steve with pulpy dog eyes and a pout and he had to turn away to avoid succumbing to them. Tony stretched a little and pushed off of Steve getting up and taking the blanket with him.
“listen to me Tony, this infatuation you have with me is not real, it’s just a phase. You deserve better , you deserve a lot more than this" he said waving at Tony’s bruised body.
Steve considered it for a moment , Tony was in no condition to be in school today. And to be honest Steve himself didn’t know why he was here today. So he made a decision letting his hand run through his hair he got up from the chair
“I am alive aren’t I, how bad can it be" he countered and unconcious to himself, tony was slowly easing up on his breathing as Steve distracted him with the turn of conversation.
“Oh.” Was all he said and Steve let out a long exhale as he reached over and grabbed the sandwiches handing over one to Tony and watched him take a bite and chew meticulously like it was the most important thing to be doing right in that moment.
"We took my car, sir. We will be okay driving home" Steve's glare softened at that, he didn't want to be this kind of teacher who the kids were afraid of, he wanted them to be able to come to him if at all they needed the help.
“why did you take off the crepe bandage?” Steve turned Tony’s hand to see that it did indeed look worse than yesterday.
“that’s because It’s a secret mission" also because he had to sign waivers and agreements with shield.
“here look,” steve said picking up the clear tube and showing it to him. Tony refused to see and Steve sighed as he leaned forward and kissed his cheek.
“You do know what is going to happen once they hit the floor on top?” Clint said and Steve raised an eyebrow
“Hey" he said smiling at the teen as Tony seemed to finally come back to his senses and wrapped his fingers around Steve’s shirt.
“I didn’t ask you to help me! I have had enough of people trying to protect me! “ tony screamed back at him picking up his bag from the floor and swinging it on his shoulders
“It's fine , you are tired” steve cut him off mid sentence and Tony looked terrified for a second before he composed his face into something more normal.
Steve’s head immediately supplied – physics, Tony had told him before leaving his classroom after missing gym.
“hey, you are okay, we were giving blood when you passed out" he took a couple of seconds to process the information ,and then frowned trying to sit up. I placed my hand on his chest holding him down ,
Tony’s eyes drifted everywhere before meeting his and once they were finally on him Steve brushed the tears away with his thumbs big hands framing his face.
Just as he left he heard Tony say “nothing happened, I didn’t let anything happen” and Steve didn’t hear Natasha’s reply as he left.
“Everybody has patches on their skin, doesn’t mean they underwent surgery. Besides why hide it? If tony was sick he would have told me, told us" he said ,the fear settling in slowly as he realized that what they were saying may have some truth to it.
Tony has also been spending a lot of time in the mansion, and when steve asks him about it, he always speaks this science jargon he doesn’t understand and then sighs and tells him that he is working on something in his lab. Which is good because Steve didn’t like the thought of Tony sitting around stane or rumlow. Which by the way, rumlow had been AWOL since they were back, again something Steve didn’t complain about.
Four heads nodded in synchrony at the screen and Steve pulled out the folded documents in front of him and the others followed doing the same.
“Look at me when I am talking to you Mr. Stark” Tony’s eyes snapped up and Steve almost felt bad at using that tone with him.
“So you will watch him hurt Tony instead?” natasha deadpanned and Steve almost lost what was left of his stomach contents then and there.
“He won’t take it well, he’s already sick. He’s only sixteen, I can’t do that to him" he was also Steve’s precious lover , someone steve had connected with like never before and this one piece of information would destroy everything.
“Good morning, Dr banner here told us that anthony has some very important news he wishes to share with us!”
“Pick me up and hold me" he said against steve skin and it made Steve’s skin prickle with worry but he did what he was asked , he pulled Tony along with him as he stood up from the bed one arm below Tony’s ass and the other supporting his back.
“a little rain wont get me sick, ow" he said as Steve tugged a little hard on his hair and Steve finally dropped the towel smirking at Tony’s glare he wrapped his fingers around Tony’s chin his lips squished together and gave him a light kiss before letting him go.
“What is it?” He asked flipping it back and forth and Steve wiped the drop of water that dripped from his hair and was trailing down his temple.
Steve hung his head , his ears ringing as he listened to natasha explain to Bruce about Bucky choking Tony. He couldn’t get over the guilt of that moment no matter what and it would always hang over his head.
“these indicate that extensive surgery was done to cover up the scars, there is someone mentioned here by then name of Dr. Cho and that her speciality is surgical recreation with nanotech. There wouldn’t be a scar" he stated
“Okay, go on” Steve said motioning to the door as he picked up his stack of papers that tony had put on the floor
The doctor on rotation was kind and patient as he asked Tony to sit on one of the beds. Something about the way he was handling himself with Tony told him that he was already briefed about their arrival and that person would definitely have to be natasha.
Tony’s fingers unclenched from the white knuckled grip he had on Steve’s shirt front. Steve took a few calming breaths before he carefully pulled away so he can look at Tony’s face. Tony was always a big talker and most of the time he delivered. But only Steve knew this side of him and in spite of knowing that no matter how confident Tony is talking about intimacy of any sort he is still sorting through some issues and that he shouldn’t have pushed him, issues that Steve knew better than anyone and sometime better than tony himself.
“Yes I will wake him , feed him, dress him and drop him off" she said rolling eyes but Steve sighed satisfied.
"Sit here, don't move. I have a meeting in the room next door. We are going to talk once I am back. Do you understand me?" Tony didnt look up at him as he was pushed into a chair in a small conference room opposite to where Steve's meeting was happening. He didn't answer Steve. He stared resolutely at his feet.
Over the next few days, Steve was already back to his routine. Grading papers, home works and what not. Until he came across one particularly well written paper especially for a bunch of fifteen year olds who wanted nothing to do with history.
“Have you been avoiding it because you were worried it was going to burn?” he asked they walked slowly together
“I know, just sit still for sometime. I’ll ask bruce to get you out of this" he dropped his wallet into one of the cabinets in the room knowing his comms would be active and he could access it outside of the room.
"You didn’t eat anything yesterday though , it was only me who ate most of the food.” Steve said reminding him gently and Tony made an ‘oh' sound and kept quiet and natasha frowned at the two of them and then glared at Steve
Bruce hmm'd and took a sip of his tea. A shrill bell signifying the end in break time and they were off to their respective classes with a wave goodbye.
“Oh ,if you are going to be grouchy then no good news for you" he said dropping the cup into a trashcan and he walked to the bathroom to wash his hands thoroughly before going to Tony .
“No thor" Steve said rubbing his forehead with his palm. “ I am , well I don’t know what to call it yet. But yes, I am courting a person. And what natasha means by little is that HE is a little younger than me"  natasha scoffed
Tony's face fell, but he didn’t say anything , only nodded and pursed his lips as he watched them leave and the turned to Steve with the same expression.
“Did you tell him?” steve nodded and Bucky waited expectantly but when Steve didn’t say anything  he asked “is he okay with you being here?”
His eyes roamed the small space before it landed on a pair of feet sticking out from behind the counter and between the bathtub.
“Stevie, didn’t expect you today" bucky said smiling as he opened the door and Steve shrugged walking in striping out if his jacket.
“I’ll clean it up,  put some skin glue and steri strips over it. Should hold it for now" and Steve was so grateful that they all had any kind of medical training to manage these situations.
“how long was I out?” He asked stretching and testing his joints as he reached for the uniform at the same time Clint got up.
“Which is why we contacted CPS to get hold of the original certificate. Everyone will know in a few days that he is really only turning seventeen" natasha told him or re told him for the n'th number of time.
It took seven hours of continuous battle with the sqiggles, yes that's we decided to call them ,to finally figure out that the radiating material was the key to kill the seemingly endless energy these things had. It was absorbing energy and releasing the energy in a continuous cycle, the radiation destroying what it came in contact with. Including my suit of armor. It burned away most of the left side of my armor including the face plate. Leaving by an ugly red burn in it's wake. But there was no time to stop and dwell on it , the squiggles were now approaching the community center where all the civilians had gathered for safety.
“Mr. Roger’s! I need to speak with you immediately” he heard the panicked voice of rhodey on the other side and he quickly opened the door and pepper and rhodey rushed in.
He reached Tony’s room in three seconds flat and found him sitting the same way he had left him. Je didn’t even look up when Steve crouched down in front of him.
“Steve, come on. He’s okay, put him down.” Steve was being guided to the couch and he was aware of the cushions hitting his thighs as he was pushed onto it.
“Thor do you want to cut the cake instead?” tony asked him a smirk playing on his lips at the excited god who was basically loomimg over tony.
“What are you feeling?” he asked as he slyly extended his thumb downwards towards Tony’s wrist feeling for his pulse. Steve could immediately feel how erratic it was and he frowned concerned.
“At the age of one the child was diagnosed with a failing heart. In two months of the diagnosis a device was invented to keep the heart beating . The technology is far fetched Steve,  even for this generation and I don’t doubt Howard’s genius.” No, steve was not buying any of it
“I don’t know, but I believe they will aleast know how to handle you when you are being unreasonable" steve laughed , it was more of “yeah , right" sarcastic laugh and Bruce shook his head again at him
Tony shakes his head.  He reaches for something on the work table, but it's blocked by his back and Steve can't see what he's doing.  "Go
The light tap of footsteps on the stairs is the only thing that alerts him to the person moving behind him. Turning around slowly, he stifles the sigh of relief that bubbles in his chest when he sees that it's only Natasha.
The very sentence makes Steve's blood run hot.  There is no excuse for drinking. There is no excuse for, for, for.
Clearly that has worked out in his favor. "Well, still, thank you," he says. "I appreciate, you know, still being alive. It probably wasn't easy, getting me all the way here. With me being unconscious and probably bleeding out all over you and whatnot."
Steve's mouth quirks in what could almost be the ghost of a smile before he rounds the table and sits down. Up close, he looks even bigger, and his broad shoulders are exactly at Tony's eye level.
Tony cringes a little. He's definitely failing to make a good first impression – although, in his defense, he's starting from the very bottom of the totem pole. He is, however, eager to meet Steve, so after a pause, he hobbles down the stairs after Natasha.
It's fucking freezing out, and Tony's hands tremble as they reach into the bag. His fingers are entirely white except for their reddened knuckles, and he can barely close his fingers around the chips. Even though it's mid-March, the wintry weather hasn't yet faded in Pennsylvania. He'd been in Malibu all the way until December, but he's managed to hike all the way across the country, not for any particular purpose except to have something to do. He has no friends, no family, no home to go to except for the one he'd been kicked out of. So, sightseeing it is.
Rhodes shrugs. "I was a freshman when Stark was a senior. Everyone knew him. He was like a little celebrity. I didn't pay much attention to the gossip, though."
He didn't even know why he was here again.  First of all, the arena was way overpriced, and secondly, the pizza tasted like feet.  Honestly, Natasha was the only Avenger who actually enjoyed laser tag.  He still couldn't believe the red-haired assassin had managed to cajole the rest of the team (minus Bruce and Thor) to play yet another game.
"My name is Natasha," the redhead – Natasha – says. The chill in her gaze hasn't disappeared, and Tony feels a little bit like shrinking under the scrutiny. "You're in a safehouse. And I didn't save you."
He wisely doesn't mention JARVIS, who's still strapped snugly around his wrist. As much as he'd like to show the AI off, he knows it'd probably be a bad idea.
One day, Tony comes out early into the communal kitchen for breakfast.  The other Avengers (sans Thor, who's in Asgard) are there already, adrift in their own heads, talking in hushed voices.  Everyone quiets when they see him; Steve understands though, because he knows the other Avengers have been having some trouble viewing Tony the same too in the wake of Ultron.  Natasha is especially hostile because they had all watched the last recordings from before JARVIS's death, the ones where Tony cajoled and manipulated Bruce into helping him with the ULTRON project.  Maybe it's not right, Steve thinks, pinning what was essentially Bruce's own decision onto Tony and then blaming him for the Hulk's subsequent disappearance, but he understands this too. Natasha is hurting, she feels lost and alone.  They are all hurting.
“kay, I’ll try but can you sit here with me on the bed?’ he asked , and Steve immediately knew he was just milking it cause Tony’s eyes were glinting with excitement
Natasha ran her hand on the front of Tony’s pants the same way he had and smiled looking up “he is fine"
“He tried to jerk me off once and I came too soon and he got so angry” deep breaths. Tony is currently sitting on Steve’s lap and is perfectly fine, Steve had to remind himself over and over.
“That’s the point. There are towels in the cabinet and I will be right outside if you need me" steve said trying very hard to control his face from showing the worry.
“Try eight years younger" she said as her hand shot out to catch Clint who was almost on the floor now.
“Verbal answers baby, come on you know this" he coached and Tony whined not wanting to shaking his head “hey, if I don’t hear you then we are stopping here" steve said and Tony gasped
when Steve refused to move, fury rolled his eye “sit down Rogers, I don’t need you towering over me” Steve sat, trying to calm himself down enough to ask the right questions.
“just doing my job" Steve said and the expression on Tony’s face immediately fell but Steve didn’t understand why.
“please don't fight me on this Tony" he said as he walked them both back to the bed. He picked him up , manhandled him onto the bed and sat down next to him.
Steve sighed, finally giving in and walking over to where tony was sat. He pulled up a chair and sat down in front of him.
“You were gone a long time" he said looking up , there was no real hatred there but Steve could tell he was feeling hurt from  being kept in the dark.
He carefully peeled Tony away from him before tugging on the robe and letting it fall to the bed. He was thankful to Clint for getting him a change of clothes so he actually had a pair of boxers to change into after his shower.
“I am sorry,peggy. I should have contacted you, but somehow it didn’t feel right.” He said softly begging her to understand and understand she did , because she was peggy , his first love.
“Hi honey" Steve grinned all pain forgotten . An itch he didn’t even know existed at the back of his mind seemed to have eased.
“I think it will require sutures , do you wan-" he hadn’t even finished the sentence yet and Tony scrambled away from Steve shaking his head fear evident on his face
The poor thing had been bound to his bed, he was weak still but he was also going stir crazy and there was only so much entertainment a atarkpad could give him.
Natasha never showed open affection, and this instance was a real opener to him. She was definitely rattled with what happened today and Steve as a good team leader had to pry into it sometime soon.
"Come here" his head whipped up from the bowl to his face as Steve held out his arm for Tony. "I won't bite , come on" tony gave an unsure smile before forcing himself to move under Steve's arm.
“Come on, my monkey mechanic" he said pulling him down and Tony spluttered something before he finally managed to get out a “what?” as he was pulled into the tub and settled against Steve’s chest. The water was hot, but not too hot and Steve was finally feeling relaxed.
“I love you” he whispered and Tony just slipped out from the edge of the bed and onto Steve’s lap hugging him so tightly that Steve found it hard to breathe . He wrapped his arms around the smaller shoulders and tugged his chin up capturing the chapped lips with his own.
It wasn’t as bad as Steve had feared to be honest. He held both of Tony’s hand in one large palm of his before using the other to gently to move his penis so he could examine his sacs. He could already see the bruising there and Tony cried out as Steve gave them a little squeeze to check for tenderness.
“I am going to be right here , not going anywhere okay?” and Tony nodded against his chest as the two doctors came back in and asked Steve let go of Tony so they could check him over.
“See? It’s out sweetheart" he showed him and Tony clung to Steve’s hands staring down at his own cock.
“I didn’t know , I was just trying to comprehend and I couldn’t and I still cannot” he said forehead creasing but Steve didn’t have a free hand to smooth it out.
“Huh, like father like son" Tony said shrugging but was smiling as he heard new information about his dad.
“Hi again honey" he said wanting to wipe the frown off his favourite person’s face more than anything.
“see this is why you shouldn’t be angry with me" he said grinning at him and at that Tony only huffed some more
He nodded , took a few more breaths and followed her back inside. He didn’t know what to say but thankfully the others did the talking and he just sat there and listened as the truth came out .
“Sweetheart, I need you to wake up for me" he said loudly and clear trying to break through to his conscious mind.
A plate of hot food was placed in front of him as he sat himself down at the small makeshift conference table they had made on the jet facing the big screen. He gratefully smiled as he settled in for what he knew was a very long lecture from fury about getting Tony involved.
“I don’t want to go with obie” he mumbled “and I don’t need to sleep, I am fine” he said that loudly and Steve took a second to get a good look at tony , he looked downright exhausted.
He had been taking Tony out every few days, keeping an eye out for any signs of abuse and Tony was starting to get more comfortable under Steve's scrutinizing eyes. Now he just rolls his eyes at Steve everytime he not so subtly feels around for any injuries Tony could be hiding from him. He would initially resist and try to slap away Steve's wandering hands but slowly give into the touches and then whine when Steve tried to take his hands away.
“Uhm….just don’t be mad okay?” he told natasha and she was still frowning at him and she shot Steve a quick look before Steve eased the blanket off Tony’s back and as Steve had predicted, natasha took it very well.
“Yeah! Steve gave them to me yesterday for my birthday” he said looking at her fingers holding them ,but something was off and she was not looking at them, she was looking at his chest, and before she dropped them Steve saw her brush her fingers against his skin for good measure ,like she was feeling for something . He kept his emotions carefully in check as he wondered what was going on.
Steve frowned , they had only thought it was enough reason to give them sometime time to think of a better reason. Something didn’t seems right and he continued frowning and  Tony caught on,
“So I’ll see you after school then?” Steve asked dropping his hands and getting up straightening his shirt
His mind was hazing over with lust and the glimpse he had got of Tony’s tiny little puckered hole this morning was becoming a constant reminder in his mind pushing everything else to the back.
“Anthony Edward stark, ring any bells?” Steve froze for a solid three seconds, the lettuce and tomato falling right out of the bottom of his sandwich.
“Have I told you how much of a genius that kid is?” and steve nodded letting Bruce continue as he chewed on his food.
“You with me?” He asked as he lowered his head to Tony’s eye level and Tony nodded jerkily finally looking up at the people behind Steve.
“Is he coming in here or?” Steve asked as he unconsciously tightened his told on the teen currently passed out on his chest.
And truth be told, it was not just her who was rattled by it, steve was now terrified of what might happen next time if he didn’t do something about it.
“Do you really want to see obie?” steve watches his face for any clue knowing tony was currently open to the world with his emotions.
“When did he give it to you? Did he force you to take it?” Clint asked still level headed as Steve just stared at Tony’s face wondering how he had missed the blown pupils before.
“Something tells me that the reason stane saved Tony from the accident had something to do with this" he tapped the object in question on the x ray.  “it has a source of energy I don’t identify and I saw the design and I know for sure there is nothing out there like this.”
“tony, I need to ask. Look at me hon” the sudden softness to her voice made Steve and tony whip their eyes up to meet hers.
“No! No! He doesn’t look like he is going to be okay, omg he’s bleeding , natasha he is bleeding everywhere!”
“Tony sweetheart look at me ,come on” he asked as he spread his legs and got in between his cock lining up perfectly against his hole.
“because It didn’t happen in the gym" Steve dropped the pen he was holding and his eyes snapped up to glare at Tony at this new information but Tony still wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“I think you do.” Steve said frankly “but I won’t force you to say anything you don’t want to. I am terribly worried baby , have been for a while now. So I would really appreciate it if you could give me a hint" he said and Tony looked conflicted and Steve hated putting him in this position .
“That bad huh?” she asked as she worked on Tony’s hand. He whimpered a little but didn’t wake up and she taped it in place quickly before attaching the leads from the heart monitor. Steve eased himself back in once Tony was hooked up to everything and wrapped his arms around him.
“so I know I promised to show you my lab , but first I really need to see that you are okay.” He heard Tony say from the other side of the door and Steve grinned at Tony’s stubborn insistence
“Steve someone needs to teach your palate a lesson" steve raised an eyebrow turning towards the teen , he kept his face perfectly calm as he leaned down close to him and whispered
“I am sitting with you, I told you I will” he said confused at why tony was repeating the same thing.
“Feel s'good don’t wanna move” he slurred and Steve kissed the top his head before pushing Tony’s head away to look at his face
“okay I really hope so too and don’t worry about the car, You can pick me up on the way to school tomorrow” Steve thanked him, eternally grateful for having a friend like him.
The first time they had done this, Steve had been so worried and emotionally wrecked he had not actually concentrated on what he had been doing. This time he really wanted to show Tony how good it can be. He was all too aware of his mind telling him not to do it all but when Tony begged like that there wasn’t much Steve could do but give him what he wants and really, it was Steve’s fault Tony was even in this state of needing to plead.
Steve couldn’t sleep that night , he knew stane was right but he also had this inherent need to protect the boy and he felt empty knowing he wouldn’t see Tony again.
“He’s taking a shower" he said sighing as he wiped his hands on a towel before going back in to his closet to change his shirt.
“I want you to be able to believe me when I say I love you and I know you are currently having a tough time with that and it’s okay.” Tony opened his mouth to argue but before he could Steve continued “we may fight, we will have difference in opinions but I want you to know I am not going anywhere and especially not because you now have a reactor” tony looked momentarily stunned and he opened his lips and closed them a couple of times not sure what to say so Steve gave him a long soft kiss that Tony just completely melted into his fingers coming up and wrapping around Steve’s shirt.
“Don’t scare me like that” he chastised and Tony only shrugged and silently went back to tucking his head into steve shoulder.
“So captain, how does it feel now that the world thinks you are dead again? But I have to say, only you can make dying look good. That was some heroic movie we just shot. There is going to be a lot of tears I can tell.”
He terribly missed his friends, Bucky especially. It took Steve an entire year to come to terms with the time jump and it had taken natasha’s wise words of ‘this is your second chance, don’t waste it’ for him to get out of his lovely apartment, courtesy of shield, and learn the new ways of life. The technology had been baffling at first, but after being shown around shield’s tech which was far more complicated than the current tech available to the common world he had picked it up relatively fast. He could even use the smartphone device to it’s maximum capacity within few months. Of course he had been mocked relentlessly by Clint that it had taken him months to do so.
Steve had to give them props for pulling one over the ever angry man. But then again if anyone was capable of it, it had to be these two.
“okay" he said resignedly and Steve sighed shifted a little closer to him and pulled his sheets away enough to expose his upper half. Steve was beyond worried but he could not show it in front of Tony.
Now that he knew Tony was doing okay, the worry had simmered down and let the anger out in full force.
Reaching for the lube from the table he uncapped it slicking up his fingers and palm as Tony held on tighter.
“tony trust me I am very glad you told me even if it was just today. But what I meant is I can no longer keep quiet about it” tonys chest did a double take when his breath hitched in his throat
He sighed, sitting down across from the two teens with tony still fidgeting and glaring at his friends from a few feet away.
That meant tony was hurt in some way or another and had instructed Jarvis not to tell me about it. I sighed in frustration and looked up at the ceiling.
“Clint watch your mouth" he said walking out to see what the commotion was about and immediately regretted his curiosity as he found Tony and Clint covered in what looked like red sauce pasta standing and glaring at natasha who looked unimpressed.
“I’ll go change into something else okay? Be right back” Tony panicked for a good 3 seconds before saying
He silently noted something down and turned back to them “have you experienced any shortness of breath? Fatigue? Or tenderness you have been feeling ?” He asked and Tony shook his head but Steve knew better
“Okay, I’ll take you home. Do you have everything you need with you ?” he asked looking around for his bag which held his keys.
"Tony? Just lay still for a minute okay? What's going on with you?" Steve looked like he might burst into tears from worry. I pushed at their hands more firmly and sat up.
Bruce let me sit up, checking my pupils and asking more questions about the reactor. I knew the fastest way out of this was to deal with it. So I answered as much as possible patiently while the quinjet took us back to the tower. Once the quinjet docked, thor hopped off and turned back to give me a hand. Before taking it I turned to Bruce
“No, I am not leaving. Why will it hurt?” he said getting up leaning over Steve to look at what natasha was seeing.
“Tony, come on” he said rolling him back to face Steve and tony squinted his eyes looking at Steve and he smiled down at him waiting for recognition to hit. He yawned and stretched as much as possible on the couch and ended up elbowing Steve in the knees .
“so uhm" tony started as he brought his mug down , and sidled a little closer to Steve, “we found out why I was not feeling too great these past few weeks" he cleared his throat and Steve stiffened next him as tony chanced a peek at his face
“Okay, good. You are okay" steve murmured mostly to himself and pulled them both up so Tony could rinse his mouth but the moment he pulled them upright Tony scrambled for purchase and his eyes rolled back into his head and his knees gave out.
I have no prior experience to writing , and had no idea how hard it is to actually write! So I want to just appreciate everyone out there who is doing it and doing it sooo much better than me!!
“ I wish you had told me, about the cold water"  he said sniffling a little, probably already catching a cold.
“Obie lied to me all these years and I don’t want to deal with him right now” okay at least Steve knew why tony was in school today instead of resting at home,but there were more concerns rising.
“How am I supposed to go home like this?” he asked turning to steve and pointing to his pantless legs and steve smiled at him and patted the bed next to him
All of us just started at him as he finished his pop tart , watching for signs of anything we had missed. He pursed his lips ,and finally realized he was leaning against me and pushed away. I steadied him for a second afraid he would tip over again . My hand hovering around his elbows as he carefully lifted his feet off the pillows and placed them on floor ,and looking around for something.
“What I need from you both,” Tony’s head shot up his eyebrows raising but Steve ignored him “is if you guys would let Tony stay with you for a couple of days.”
“are we going to talk about your little panic attack in the locker room today?” he asked bluntly as he sat down pulling the covers up and over both of them
Tony looked a little red in his ears as he slowly made his way out and Steve stepped up to help him back. The excited gasp Tony gave when he saw the mousse made Steve’s heart warm.
“You look comfortable “ Steve commented as he went to get them some water and Tony made grabby hands at him when he came back. Steve knew the upcoming talk was inevitable whether Tony wanted to have it or not.
Steve thanked the doctor and turned to enter the small room Tony was kept in , they had a private room courtesy of black widow.
Tony pushed off of him making his way to Steve’s room , carrying his new shoes on his shoulder like It was a burden and Steve headed towards the kitchen to get him something to eat. He found some fruit flavored yogurt and he cut up some sandwiches natasha had labelled and left for them inside the refrigerator.
“how bad is it steve?” she asked that protective self coming out, he could see the menace in her eyes and steve thought to himself, good that bastard deserves it.
“That wont be necessary, Tony is coming with us" the next few seconds were a blur in Steve’s head it was jumble of “ow don’t touch me!” and “mr rumlow I advice you let go right now" and a CRASH
“no, steve took care of them. But I remember being used by someone else but like I said before I don’t know who" steve snapped out of his trance when he realized something
“Yeah, steve I am sorry.” He said lower lip jutting out like he was going start crying but Steve didn’t give him the chance to
“okay, okay I have you Tony, tell me what’s wrong so I can fix it" Natasha’s eyes met Steve’s as Tony refused to tell her and Steve just wished they weren’t in this situation at all
He stopped by the vending machines and got one of those chocolate bars that Tony always makes him buy when they go out and as he approached the room he could hear quite murmurs and he was surprised to find that he recognized one of the voices and this voice shouldn’t be here.
“How are you feeling?” he asked as he ran his hands up and down his thighs under the covers and Tony shrugged
“Why are you dressed like that?” Steve ignored his question , and wiped Tony’s dirty blackened fingers from the soot.
“So, astrophysics is now code for making out huh?” He asked once tony seemed to have relaxed, but only to make his shoulders tense again.
“don wanna ..school" he slurred and it tugged at Steve’s heart when his face contorted into pain as he pulled his legs in closer. He was still half asleep and Steve considered just letting him go back to sleep but he knew he couldn’t keep stalling forever.
“Tony has a lot of trust issues, he’s not the same as every other teenager. His mind doesn’t work the same as others, maybe you shouldn’t treat him like he is one of them and with your job he’s going to need more than kisses for assurance that you are okay" steve frowned at her not liking where this was going
Secondly, Tony’s living arrangements had been a huge discussion. Steve had argued relentlessly with Tony about him staying at a ‘friend’s’ place for a while but he had been just as adamant as Steve. So after drawn out discussion , Tony had promised them that he would call the minute anything went amiss. Natasha had sided with Tony which Steve was unhappy about but her reasoning was fair.
“oh? everything is fine now? Is that why you decided to let rumlow slip you drugs and get handy with you? Is that why you got drunk the moment after? Is that why you have trouble letting anyone touch you without it sending you into a panic attack?” steve was so angry he didn’t even care that he was screaming and that Natasha had all but run back into their room standing at the door ready to interfere
“I can’t face him now, please” Steve contemplated for a few seconds before gently bringing his hand down on Tony’s back.
Tony gets clingy only under few circumstances and all of it had to do with him needing medical help. Steve placed a palm against his forehead, but he seemed fine.
“ You look ready to pass out. I should have just taken you to medical" Steve scoffed and Tony frowned.
Steve's anger with shield was only increasing with every minute he had to still sit in school until the bell rang signifying it was time to leave. So by the time he reached shield, it was safe to say he was fuming.
“You think your boyfriend can’t spank you?” tony shivered and Steve smirked as he watched the blush reach his cheeks
"Why is there a super spy on my bed?"I asked though I snuggled into her hand a little more because that felt good.
“You have to face the consequences of your action and I promise you will be quiet surprised by what’s to come" he said pulling Tony with him.
“Its all your fault, you made me run too much" his throat was scratchy and he kept trying to clear it a couple of times withought any success and then suddenly his eyes went wide like he had just realized something, steve was just enjoying watching the random emotions flitting across his face without a wall for him to put up.
“Its late afternoon, Steve I have never known for you to sleep this long. Are you slacking off?” Clint smirked at him and Steve just rolled his eyes.
“you know the enemy were the monsters and not building right?” he said as he carefully sat down on the side of Steve’s bed letting his hand run through Steve’s hair as steve gave a sheepish smile.
“Medbay downstairs ,and before you say anything to get out of it , it’s not an option.” Tony stood stubbornly pulling away from Steve’s hold and glared at him.
Steve called clint to find out where they were and somehow he didn’t expect them to be at the tower. Spending a day with Clint is usually a roller coaster and Tony would have been his perfect partner. But under the circumstances he shouldn’t have expected as much.
“only if there are cheeseburgers” steve smacked his face with his hands groaning as clint held up a brown paper bag with a grin “only the best ones" he said as the rest of team shuffled into the room. Bruce shaking his head in disapproval at all the equipment and IV lying around unhooked as he got to work on replacing everything back as steve held a squirming tony still. Natasha gave tony a quick kiss on his cheek and then smacked him on the head with the back of her hand.
“Not really just..I don’t Know" steve felt a little guilty at leaving him alone. But new thoughts today, so Steve was going to take it in stride, because tony was alive , well and doing okay.
“can you show her?” Tony looked at him with pleading eyes silently asking him not to make him do this
“Okay, we will just watch the TV okay?” he said settling back on the bed wrapping his arms around the genius. He felt Tony instantly relax and sigh softly against his chest
“Damn right you are sorry! I am taking Tony back to boarding school. I don’t want to see him associated with anyone and I mean it , from shield. There will be absolutely no contact with him and I don’t want him asking questions about his past life , it took a damn hell of a effort to get the trauma of watching his parents die out of his mind. He doesn’t need more.”
Steve was surprisingly never jealous when Tony was this physically close to nat. Somehow he felt like he was intruding an intimate moment. He needed a good woman in his life and not was perfect for Tony and Steve was not going to ruin that for him by a long shot.
The team sat with Tony in shifts, so they could meanwhile do their own things. There was a scare in between when Tony had tried to walk himself to the bathroom and he had tripped and fallen leaving a long gash along his fforearm. Since then it was a given that at no point was he to be left alone.
“Or do you want to skip it because you have a test in physics?” Tony grumbled while Steve chuckled at him and they both startled when the door pushed open.
“yeah?” he asked not looking at Bruce but his eyes still on Tony and the tie that hung around his neck. Steve had never seen Tony in an uniform , he didn’t think it would be such a turn on , he had infact expected it to be quite the opposite because Tony looked oh so young! And naïve and absolutely handsome his hair neatly combed.
Tony’s breath was coming in shallow gasps as he felt Steve’s fingers unclasping his belt buckle and he tightened his hands around Steve’s neck fingers digging into skin.
“also I am not leaving the mansion , it’s not your decision” he said lips pursed and Steve at this point wanted to just go back to this morning where he was sleeping under the protective arms of natasha.
After that, Steve spent the rest of the day finding himself constantly looking over at tony while tony did the exact opposite.
“ its embarrassing to talk about” he mumbled as he tried to hide his face in Steve’s chest but steve wouldn’t let him , he pushed him back and held him there.
“oh let’s see how funny you are with this knife in your gut," he said pulling out a small knife from his belt and Steve should have been scared but really he was just glad.
“I know , it won’t happen-" and now Steve was smirking . Rhodey was so confidently giving false promises and pepper was frantically nodding her head beside him neither one of then aware of Tony’s silent laughter behind them.
"Get some sleep, I will drop you home after okay?" Tony nodded, eyes still closed and snuggled closer to Steve. It was way too early for either of them to be in bed but if Steve's presence was what he needed to fall asleep then Steve would lay beside him the whole time.
“welcome back" he said rocking backward and forward a little. His eyes were rimmed red, but Steve couldn’t tell if it was from the chlorine of the swimming pool or something else.
“Yeah! Obie said I don’t have to go boarding school” the relief on Tony’s face was palpable amd Steve was so glad to see it. “Did you have something to do with it?” he asked suddenly frowning at Steve
“It will hurt” he said voice trembling and Steve quickly pulled his gown up and tugged on his boxers ,
"Come here" he said and Tony shook his head staying rooted in place . He was flushed, his cheeks redder than he had ever seen. Eyes glazed over and was sweating ever so lightly. He looked completely inebriated.
Tony’s head snapped up as he heard Steve’s shoes schuff on the floor and he immediately straightened out letting his arm fall onto the bench and grinned at Steve.
They sat in silence for a few moments until both their breathing returned to normal and Tony's head started slipping downward on his chest eyes drooping
Sometimes steve wondered if that was why she took to Tony so well, she is more protective of him than steve is and it all came to Steve that it’s because she was Tony’s age when it had all happened. She sees tony as her younger self, wanting to protect him from all the wrong in the world and Steve was to be honest very okay with that.
He tried the door and found it unlocked and he opened it half way and just in case said “I am coming in" and then gave a pause waiting for any reply and when he didn’t receive one he pushed his way inside.
Steve was reluctant to wrap his arms around tony, keeping his body oddly angled so he wouldn’t brush against Tony’s waist.
He watched as Tony’s fingers traced every little mark already healing rapidly on his skin and when he was done Steve put his shirt back on with Tony’s permission.
And Tony let a small whine escape his lips just to show Steve how miserable he felt all the happy feeling from before gone.
“Hey, sorry we woke you up. I just came by to start you on your medications” Tony’s eyes widened when he remembered where he was and Steve went back to carding his fingers through Tony’s hair and he relaxed , if only a little.
“Funny. I take the comm link helped?” he felt Tony nod against his neck, his hair tickling and Steve fought the urge to scratch the itch it left behind
"Tony, I know you know what's happening" she said .I nodded my head in defeat the panic already evident on my face. Steve rubbed his hands up and down my shoulder and arms in comfort.
“wha's gng …on?” the sudden croaky voice surprised both Steve and natasha , steve pulled his pants up quickly before turning back to his lover his hands hovering near Tony’s chest.
“We can give him a mild sedative” Dr.Brandon said, gently as if she was trying not to startle tony again which was when Steve realised that Tony’s eyes were drooping.
“Is this all? Turn around" she told Tony her eyebrows scrunching as Tony tightened his arms around Steve like a child clinging to his father.
Tony spluttered , blushing and trying to come up with something to say while Steve looked at him innocently and continued eating his yogurt.
“Tony, what is your problem with the xray?” bruce asked patiently while the others looked on worriedly
Tony looked down avoiding their gaze as Clint reached over to snag the sweatshirt off since he said he was feeling hot. But  before Tony could grab at it ,Clint had already pulled it off his lap and Tony’s  hand shot out to grab at it again. Steve’s and clint’s gaze immediately zeroed in on the tent bulging at his waist. Steve immediately let go of his hold on Tony’s arm and Clint backed up a little looking unsure .
Something changed, when steve returned and he couldn’t exactly pin point what it was but it didn’t feel right. The LCD screen that had been screeching some news had been turned off and the sudden silence seemed deafening to Steve after having sat for an hour amidst the noise.
“You don’t talk,  I bet you didn’t even know anna has the biggest crush on you! What am I saying , everyone does” That caught steve off guard and his smile dropped as he stared at Tony taking in his very serious expression.
Looking outside the large windows and the amount of light that was coming in , steve knew it was already past sunrise  and one glance at the clock confirmed that it was indeed eight am.
“is this why you brought me here, to get my out of my clothes?” He said voice steely, fingers fidgeting and Steve reeled back taking his hands away from the teen.
So it amused him when Steve found said genius sitting outside the gym on a bench with none of his friends with whom he was always in non stop chatter with. As he walked closer Steve noticed the slight hunch in his posture and his left arm loosely wrapped around his abdomen .
“Cant sleep” he said voice raw and now Steve was frowning trying to understand why Tony was being so stubborn about sleeping or how his body was even still functioning.
Steve was particularly happy for the third day because Bruce had mentioned they could finally get the catheter out and let him move around some. He was told that Tony needed endurance training after this as part of his physical therapy. Since his long capacity had reduced after placing the casing.
“put this on and go back to what you are doing, come on honey" he said holding the shirt up for him to see and Tony made a face but he sat down on the counter legs swinging and Steve took the opportunity to slide the shirt over his head. Up close Steve could see the black smudges over his underwear was actually grease and his face was full of it too. Before tony could get up, steve held him still and checked his pupils , temperature and pulse all the while with Tony whining trying to get away.
“you aren’t doing so well tony, it won’t help if you run yourself down like this bud” tony slapped his hand away
“hey , what are you kids up to?” She asked politely and before pepper could answer tony sighed and yanked his hands away from peppers hold.
“I love you sweetheart, happy birthday” he said softly before kissing him, long and soft and gentle. Steve released him , and tony smiled widely at him and wrapped his arms around his neck , giving him a good hug “thank you" he said genuinely and Steve couldn’t resist kissing him again.
“Don’t” he pleaded and Steve stood stock still as Tony struggled to get the sheets untangled and finally throw himself completely at Steve. He buried his face under Steve’s chin , breathing in the scent of Steve’s freshly washed clothes.
“Steve you can put your shirt back on, we have seen it all" she said distracting Tony as he turned to look at Steve as he slowly put his shirt on knowing Tony will be watching and the longer he takes , the longer he will be distracted .
Tony was butt naked but Steve was eighty percent sure he could get through this without having an erection. Atleast steve was still wearing all of his clothes so there was that barrier. Atleast.
"I'll go make him a sandwich" Bruce replied instead. I felt myself being lowered onto the couch. Someone was lightly slapping my face, well it had to be Steve, who else.
But there was a certain vulnerability to him today that Steve was just mostly taken aback, surprised or rather just didnt know how to respond to a vulnerable Tony without it bringing out the feelings he had for the boy which was not okay.
“Okay, I am going to make sure he is okay and I’ll meet you guys down here” he said exiting and took off in a jog . He skidded to a stop however when a familiar voice reached him. Tony was arguing with the medical staff
“what are you doing here?” It’s normal to acknowledge teachers and students outside school, he just didn’t think he would when they were on a mission. Because his missions normally did not include the local subway.
before Steve could say anything Clint interrupted “she’s great with sharp things, trust me on this. She once stabbed me with a knife and I barely felt it” he said casually shrugging his shoulders. Tony looked anything but amused , he turned to Steve , who gave him a nod telling him it’s okay and after a few seconds tony slowly lifted a arm at her. It was obvious he was in pain, but also obvious that he didn’t want to take the shot. Steve was started to think this kid maybe had a slight phobia to doctors and that maybe had Steve misunderstood him when he said the school nurse was scary.
“find anything?” They shook their heads in unison, Natasha finally looking up . She scanned him top to bottom before frowning at him.
“Tony , there are a lot of things we need to discuss. Hey look at me please” he asked tilting his chin up with his finger
Okay guys, i am really sorry for the inconsistent updates. I wanted to write more to this chapter but not having the time. So here it is.
“Why does everyone talk about protecting me?” He asked but Steve didn’t know just how much tony knew about his past. Or about his parents.
“what’s going on?” She finally asked sitting down on the single couch. Steve sat them both up, holding the blanket securely around Tony’s shoulders
I entered the lab after punching in the authorization code. I found Tony sipping coffee in one hand and gracefully moving his other hand around controlling the screens in front of him.
“we will bring you both a little something to eat” Steve was grateful to these two, they all always looked after each other but always knew where to draw the line or what would tip one another off.
“tony?” he felt desperate now, needing to see those brown eyes and Steve pulled back a little and the hair at the back of his neck prickled forming goosebumps when Tony’s head just lolled forward.
Steve groaned when he let that sink in, berating himself for being distracted by tony. It had been so obvious and yet when tony had looked at him with those... Steve shook his head to clear it before his thoughts ventured into something inappropriate.
He walked around sitting down opposite to them and watched as Tony unravelled what looked like a gun and Steve almost broke the plate in his hands.
“He will stay with me, until we figure out what happened here.” He said with a finality that told the others not to question his motive at the moment.
“he let you do it?” steve jumped slightly at the voice, turning behind to see natasha at the door and he smiled gratefully at her.
“we are just going to sleep okay? I can see you are really tired too, I am sure your weeks were just as bad as mine. So please let’s just get some sleep okay?” He said and promptly pulled Tony’s briefs down and Tony let out a surprised squeak before covering up his manhood with his hands.
“I never thought a day would come when I actually saw you inside the gym" Steve said sitting next to him.
“I want to see" he said adamantly pulling in Steve’s shirt and he finally caved , letting tony unbutton it.
Making sure Tony was really asleep, he ran the heel of his palm along the front of his now soaked pants and sighed when he still felt the hardness under his hand and quietly settled in pulling Tony closer to him.
But what he really did not see coming was as Clint and natasha came back carrying hands full of food ,fresh and hot , for her to lean down and drop a kiss to Tony’s forehead.
I came awake to hearing some murmuring and one hand on my torso and another smaller one brushing through my hair.
Turns out sparring was exactly what he needed to get out all the stress from his mind and body and Steve felt like he could go on and on for hours , which is apparently what they did because natasha came down to find them, her hair wet from a fresh bath and oh how Steve wanted a bath. It had been a while since he had taken a bath, he was used to quick showers but at  his moment soaking in the hot water seemed rather appealing.
"I didn't want you to see me like this" his voice hitched at the end of the sentence and Steve really wanted to wrap the teen with his arms.
“Nat, I am really happy for you. He is a great guy" she smiled but it was cautious and Steve understood why she’s been having sleepless nights herself.
“What happened? Are you okay? Did someone do something?” natasha asked looking at Tony calm but the her tone was rising just like Steve’s had but Tony didn’t answer her just looked at Steve.
He looked some what better than yesterday though , Steve kissed his temple and sighed getting up from kneeling on the floor. Tony watched him silently as Steve dragged a nearby chair plopped down next to him Watching him wearily.
“I am sorry, I just needed to figure out things for myself first and you said you trust me with making decisions!” he said tone edging on defensive
“Do you need a hallway pass to the nurse? Get some more sleep?” steve asked him as he got up checking his watch, it was almost time for his next class.
”of course, our little troublemaker” he said as he picked at the lettuce he had told Natasha he didn’t want. ‘eat your vegetables Steve’ she had said as they had made them this morning together. He liked his vegetables just fine, what he didn’t like was lettuce on toasted bread.
"thanks, J" I pushed off the covers stumbling to the shower, today is going to be all work no fun. But that's a good thing, since all he has done the past few days is laid around trying to 'rest' under the watchful eyes of the team.
“Breathe tony, nice and deep” he said taking a long breath himself feeling Tony rise against his chest as his puffed with the excess air and when he released it Tony came right back to him his head lolling back dropping below his chin.
“Drink" he was ordered and Steve opened his mouth much too fast letting the cold water wet his dry mouth and blissfully run down his throat.
Steve couldn’t take his eyes away from the blue light that hit his eyes the moment the bandage came off. Bruce kept an eye on steve as he carefully cleaned the skin around the reactor. It’s the first time Steve has seen it, he knows what it does and he thinks he knows how it works from what Tony’s told him but actually finally looking at it made the hair on his skin prickle.
“Hey, what’s wrong?” he asked as he pulled him closer and Steve really needed to get some pants on this kid before he lost it. He looked around for Tony’s underwear , helping him into it and Tony bucked when his fingers brushed against his now very sensitive cock.
Tony just sat there lost in his thoughts for the rest of the trip and Steve thought it was better to just keep quiet rather giving the kid more chances to ask questions.
Steve knew at the mention of that name that this is was probably the end of his self righteous captain America gig. He was going to soon be the super soldier who went on a rampant murderous rage and killed two very successful businessmen.
“good morning?” Bruce asked as he got into his car, he had promised he would pick him up as he had taken Bruce’s car last afternoon to take Tony home.
“I am here too you know" steve mocked and clint gave fake gasp and leaned down to kiss him on his cheek.  Tony laughed at Steve’s disgusted face , steve found this domestic living together nice.
“Tony? It’s time to get up” he said softly and Tony woke with minimal effort , he looked weary as he remembered where he was and reached out to Steve who took his hand without hesitation.
“Sweetheart,” Steve tried but he really didn’t know what to say. The surgeon fumbled with the equipment and then turned to Bruce. Steve watched the silent exchange as Bruce pulled out another syringe.
“ nothing actually makes sense yet , they hurt me everyday but fed me on time. It’s how I kept track of my days. Week two , same thing, with a camera and then a man ,wearing a well polished suit walked in ,informed me that the world thought I was dead. I shrugged and he walked out annoyed. Week three he came back asked me about whereabouts of the winter soldier”
“you okay?” He asked pulling into drive again and tony nodded still looking bewildered but did not question him at all. In fact he stayed silent eating his sandwich until they reached Steve’s apartment.
“he doesn’t trust me completely yet and nor should he. I don’t want to spook him, he is adamant and stubborn and if we push him too hard he will get defensive" if tony was anything like howard then Steve atleast had experience in that department .
“It’s not when you are talking about it with the person you want to do it with. And I promised we would go slow right? You can trust me Tony” Tony made a face that was bordering on funny and nervous at the same time but Steve didn’t comment on it
“I make no promises about freaking out but I promise I wont try to break up with you" he said seriously because he knew Tony needed to hear it again. And he would say it again and again until Tony needed him to.
“ we are going to the nurse” Steve said but just as he reached forward to pull the boy up, Tony shied away from his touch and got up on his own.
“cap, what the hell is going on?” he heard Clint through the comms  and he ducked as he saw thor’s hammer come hurtling towards them. The hammer caught Buckys metal arm tearing it at his shoulders and Bucky looked momentarily shook and Steve took the opportunity to tackle err him to the ground pressing his face into the ground and holding him there.
“Okay, what are you feeling right now? Can you describe it for me?” Clint asked and Tony shied away from Steve’s hands again and said “ it’s hot”
A few groans and shrill bell and everyone was out the door talking hushed about ‘what’s gotten into mr.rogers today?’
So Steve chose this time around to make a difference by teaching, educating the young minds who would be the future. As captain America Steve has had a lot of experience with children and has also learnt patience. He thoroughly enjoyed his day job . Shield had made sure to keep his identity a secret, everyone knew captain America but no one knew Steve Rogers and that worked out great. He had to occasionally go help out in the superhero fashion, when things came down to it but it kept him sane knowing he could do both at the same time.
Steve tightened his grip on his wrist and pinned them against the wall above Tony’s head before looking him in eye “do you really think I would be doing this if they all knew?” he asked as he pressed his smiling lips to Tony’s worried one’s.
“Steve don’t beat yourself up about it" clint said breathlessly as he wiped a trace of blood from his lips and that’s when Steve realized he was taking it out on clint but he wouldn’t have his apologies and made him fight harder.
“Actually , I think I have heard enough. It’s not my place to pry.” See this is why he really liked bruce , steve nodded as he allowed Tony to shift and tuck himself closer to him. He wrapped his arm around Tony’s shoulder ,his palm resting against the reactor.
“whatever happened to ‘you can call me anytime. No matter what the situation' that is applicable both ways obviously” he said slightly in a dramatic fashion trying to imitate Steve’s voice.
“Steve you are an honest man, don’t overthink things. It’s not your best quality" she was right but he couldn’t help himself .
And Steve sighed in relief and went around the desks to just shut the door just incase Tony didn’t feel comfortable. He walked back as Tony quickly unbuttoned his shirt and let it hang from his shoulders.
“Is he okay?” he heard from behind him and Steve turned back to see all three of him teammates standing there faces worried as he tried to get a glimpse .
“I am sorry” he said for lack of anything else to say and she just shrugged holding up another spoonful.
“ the day before, when I was having ….when we were in the men’s room you called me sweetheart. Professors don’t call their students sweethearts.”
“What? Why would he do that?” Steve was thoroughly confused ,he was tired his mind numb and natasha sighed on the other end.
So I was steering clear of Natasha for the foreseeable future. Which Is why I chose to sit next to Steve and Bruce. Bruce was a good man, always trying to get people to be comfortable around him.
“No coffee until the drugs are out of your system" tony blushed , embarrassment clouding his face. Steve hated that Tony was embarrassed about it. It didn’t sit well with him that Tony was not the least bit angry with what happened and was only embarrassed to tell Steve.
He stood out in the hallway for a few more seconds and only entered again after he was sure he wouldn’t scare tony. Tony was standing by the window, swaying ever so slightly exhaustion catching up to him.
Tony rolled his eyes and walked back to Steve tugging on his wrist to pull him along and Steve followed him this time. The stark mansion was actually quiet huge, Steve was stunned that he did even remember layout of the house. It had been more than twelve years since he and Howard sat in the study discussing designs for his shield.
“I am not sad I promise. Infact I will be happy if you get some sleep, you need to rest sweetheart.”
“five years ago when you were pulled from the ice, we reached out to obadiah and asked him to bring Tony over because we knew you could protect him and if howard was alive he would have trusted Steve with his son . But obadiah refused , he didn’t want to trust any of us with Tony. It took us tremendous effort to convince obadiah to let tony come to school here. But his one condition was to not tell Tony who you were , because he wanted to protect the boy from every danger that comes from being associated with us.”
“Have I told you how much love these?” he asked and before Tony could answer he Steve licked at his nipple , his fingers tweaking the other one and Tony’s body arched away from the bed and it only turned Steve on the more moans that Tony let escape from his mouth.
Steve made his way to his class, amusement and a hint of worry making an itch at the back of his mind , to pull out the papers Tony’s class had submitted this morning. He rifled through them quickly finding Tony’s paper to go through it.
Just as Bruce was listening to his, his face sporting a concerned frown  natasha and clint came in carrying the needful. Natasha quickly got to work checking his temp and cursed in Russian “ how bad is it?” steve whispered his hand running through Tony’s hair again, afraid he would wake up and panic.
“Did she now?” tony nodded , as he snuck his way under the blankets and Steve wrapped an arm around his waist hiking him up just a little bit.  He Sighed contentedly when the teens warm forehead tucked itself against his neck.
“children" Steve said faking exasperation and rolling his eyes as he rubbed the area he had injected with his thumb. He dragged Tony back into lying down again as he gently carded his fingers through his hair.
He wasn’t sure why Tony was defending Stane when he clearly had some role in this abuse. Every time he remembered how stane had walked in yesterday Steve felt the need to shatter something. He kept his hands carefully around Tony, one carding through his hair and the other on his waist, thumb slowly stroking the bare , soft skin. It had a calming effect on him and Steve reveled in that fact and as soon as Steve had pushed him away to patch up his abused hand , the rage had started to kindle again.
“Tony, hey it’s me buddy, I am okay” he said and tony froze as his eyes landed on Steve’s form. It would have been comical if not for the situation, just as Steve reached out to put a hand on his shoulder, tony seemed to snap out of his trance , flinging himself at Steve, trembling arms hugging him as tightly as posssible.
“Nothing , why can’t I cuddle with my boyfriend without getting the second degree?” he said frowning
“I know honey, I know" Steve didn’t know what else to say or how to make this better but for now he would just do whatever Tony needed him to.
But the damage had already been done. Tony pulled away,  Natasha’s words clearly already ser deep in him mind.
“ I was not lying when I said I will always be there for you. All I am trying to do here is inform you that this is not going to be easy. I just want to give you an option here. This life, the avengers and shield it’s dangerous Tony. You are young, and I am worried that I am robbing you off the life you should be enjoying.”
As Tony grabbed Steve's hand and started yanking him over to the exit, still swearing at the overhead cameras, Steve just chuckled.  LaserTech Arena had either been cowed by Natasha's steely glare and Clint's wild looks and had allowed them to use the speakers, or Clint had snuck in and now the Avengers would never be allowed back.
When December comes around, Tony hosts the annual Maria Stark Foundation Charity Gala and he catches Steve in the hallway, tentatively offering him a card.  "I know we're not, really," he says quietly, almost helplessly. "But - if you want to go - I got you an invitation. You can bring friends too, if you want."
that's what Tony is, and he's just like Steve's dad, it's disgusting, the stench of alcohol is so strong it stings the inside of Steve's nostrils.  "'M sorry," Tony continues, through a mumble. Oh, God, he's absolutely
"I am not intending to be a 'buzzkill' as you might say, Sir," JARVIS says, "but I don't believe it would be prudent to repay him through art with your limited resources."
Not even a little bit, no...because Tony's just that kind of person, the kind of guy who goes all out.
"No," he finally gasped out when he was done, much to Natasha's amusement.  "He just...kissed me.  I've kissed people before."
"Tony, what are you doing?" Steve said carefully, proud that his voice didn't even waver.  It was one thing to have Tony so close, but Tony pressed against him like he was now...it prompted bad thoughts.  Very bad thoughts.
Steve chuckles, and it feels good to even if there's a little twinge in his heart at seeing them so comfortable, his first friend from this century and his best friend.
It's surprising when he arrives and Tony's still not there, although he supposes Tony enjoys showing up "fashionably late because that's what the cool kids do, Steve, c'mon."  Finally Tony shows, alone - and Steve chuckles; maybe he's finally getting over his "ne'er do well" ways - and he looks a little lost for a moment before he sees Steve and heads straight over, smiling.
"Yeah," Tony says softly, carefully skirting around the nurse as he exits out the door.  "Sleep well, Steve."
Sometimes there is a knock on the door - like there is now - and Steve, for a second, imagines it is Tony standing behind it, soft grin on his face, beautiful dark eyes framed by long lashes looking up, saying "Hey, Cap.  I've missed you."  And Steve gets up every time, just as he does right now, and he opens the door and it is never,
additionally - the entirety of bruce and tony's exchange about their stem research is BS'd. however, i do love it when our science bros get into lab talk
He thought he was over it by now.  Ultron made his heart shake, his hands quiver, his tongue lodge in his throat when he looked at Tony - but he thought he was finally relearning how to love those brown eyes, and that quick mouth, and those sure hands.
Then turns and heads into the living room, because there are pizza crust crumbs stuffed between the cushions and there isn't exactly anyone else to clean the mess up.
He's big and blond and tall, and he's clearly an attractive man, but that's not what captivates Tony most. Instead, it's his gaze – stern and tough but also smart and caring all at once. His eyes are blue, and he's
Half an hour later, Tony blinks himself awake slowly, and Steve loves it - the slow awareness, the lazy flutter of lashes.  "Good morning," he whispers. The skin of Tony's neck is hot against his mouth.
He's at the door when he hears the thudding footsteps behind him. Slamming out of the doors, he pitches the grenade into the Rite Aid, not glancing back to see where it's going to land. He dives forward into the street as a chorus of unearthly howls rises up in his ears.
morally-uppity people (can't stand them, actually), but after a decade of dealing with plastic smiles and unctuous flirtations, Steve is like a breath of fresh air.
hand on the side of Steve's jaw, and Steve could breathe this time around.  God damn, he couldn't just wax poetry about Tony, he could write a whole series about him.
Tony clucked and said eagerly, "Don't worry, Cap.  Girls would kill to have you.  I'll set you up with someone.  I have tons of names you might be interested in."
But honestly?  He couldn't even bring himself to care about his archer teammate's antics, nor the fact that Barton had probably
"Sorry, buddy," Tony mutters. Normally he'd have more respect for the dying, but considering this one's just tried to kill him, his patience is wearing a little thin. He grabs his gun off the floor and flicks the safety off, shooting the zombie in the head.
"What is he doing?" he says, tamping down the suspicion.  Tony's in the penthouse, maybe he's sleeping then. But the way FRIDAY is speaking sounds off to him, somehow.  Like Tony's not okay, maybe, like he's doing something…
"Tasha, and, Clint, will be wondering where we," Tony breathed against Steve's lips.  "Also...does this, mean, you feel the same way then?"
Tony snorts. "I'm not really invested in thermonuclear dynamics either. But I pay attention when genius pops up in the scientific community."
Tony's eyes ghost to the floor.  "No," he says quietly. "I was working.  I only had a little bit - it helps me focus when I'm anxious."
Of course, it's a little uncomfortable when they go out and they have to stop holding hands, or when a reporter comes up to him and Tony and asks whether either of them are in a relationship.  Tony's always been good at deflecting so that's what he does, just makes a jokey self-deprecating quip that involves Ms. Potts, but Steve's never been able to work a crowd as well. So instead, he blushes and looks down and says, "I left my last love when I went into the ice."  See, the reporters love a juicy bit of tragedy, but even they have enough decency to leave him alone after that. Then he and Tony can get back to being with each other again, even if Tony's eyes are always a bit harder to read after questions like that.
Tony wisely keeps himself from giving a scathing response. After all, this group saved him from what would've otherwise been a guaranteed death. "I've been out on my own for months," he answers stiffly. "I was raiding the Rite Aid. I didn't realize there'd be fifty fucking zombies playing poker in the backroom."
Tony sighs, placing the gun down and clicking the safety back on. He's tried to avoid killing animals since the apocalypse started, not out of some aversion to meat or killing (he's certainly shot zombies) but because he doesn't want to have to cross that line just yet. As long as he sits in his tent and eats chips and roasts a fire, he can pretend almost like he's on a camping trip – like some rich-kid Boy Scout or something. But once he starts derailing from the normativity of his old life, he won't be able to avoid the horrible reality of the apocalypse anymore.
He scrabbles at the bandages, wanting to see how bad the damage is – it can't be too bad, or he would need surgery; but it's also bad enough to have left him unconscious and bleeding all over the place – when a new voice says, "I wouldn't do that if I were you."
This left Steve to figure out whether Natasha or Tony was the flag-holder, and he only had a despondent heart and no clue.
The engineer must have been more tired than Steve realized, because even as the bed shifts and dips under his weight, Tony doesn't stir.  He figures he should let him sleep so he settles against the headboard and takes out his custom-made Stark tablet - Tony's downloaded apps for him where he can read novels and the like, and recently he's been really into Kindle.  At his hip, Tony mumbles a little and shifts into him, pressing his face against the fabric of Steve's sweatpants.
In the morning, he's parched. He sips some of his water, brushes his teeth again, and then packs up the tent, folding it neatly into a compact square before slipping it into his pack. He pees at the base of a tree, feeling oddly like a dog marking its territory, then grabs his backpack and starts to walk. Now that it's daylight, he plans to exit the forest, meaning that he has to be prepared to encounter zombies again.
Joe Rogers used to do that a lot, Steve remembers.  He would hit Ma and then apologize, but by the next day it was the same old cycle - hit, apologize, drink and repeat, drink and repeat.
Next to the man with the straight-backed posture is a seat that looks like it's been hurriedly shoved into place, and at the head of the table is an empty chair. Tony glances around the table at the unfriendly demeanors, and then at the chairs. "So, is one of those for me?"
"Yeah," Rhodey sighed, shaking his head repeatedly for how much of an idiot his best friend could be at times.  "I'm pretty sure that
Yes, this is how the good days go.  The days are quiet, filled with sun and the old raw city smell of Manhattan.  They go out during the day to fight villains, and they return home rumpled and tired but happy.  Because, after all, they're home.
The gun clatters next to him and he reaches out, but the zombie stomps on his fingers and then kicks the gun away. Great – an intelligent zombie. The guy must've turned sometime in the last month, then; he's not stupid or slow enough to have been infected for very long.
"You are most likely at the Public Works building located at Overbrook Parkway and Trent Road." Tony makes a mental note to mark that down on his map as soon as he returns to his room.
It's strange, how different FRIDAY is from JARVIS.  JARVIS was just as robotic, monotonous, as his new counterpart.  But FRIDAY is...moreso, somehow. Less personality, less character, more servile.  Perhaps it is because after Ultron, Tony feared what his own hands could do.
A million complicated emotions flash across Tony's face in an instant, and his gaze shutters for a second before he says, with perfect poise, "Nice to meet you, Sharon.  Is Steve your lucky date?"
Tony raises an eyebrow at Clint. He has to physically shake his head a little to jolt himself out of his reverie – Bruce's work is always so fascinating. "He's an absolute genius. He has three PhDs and he's only twenty four. Even I only have one doctorate."
"Hey, you've read them," Tony says delightedly, studying Bruce more closely. The guy is so reserved-looking that Tony hadn't spared much thought to him, at first. But now, looking at the curly dark hair – the intelligent brown eyes and square jaw – the realization hits. "Wait a second. You're Bruce
The supersoldier turned away and hefted his rifle onto the rack with a little more force than was necessary, purposely not looking at Natasha.  He could feel her eyes burning into his shoulder blades though, almost accusatory.  What did she expect him to do anyway?  Stark - Tony - probably went around kissing people for distractions all the time.  The kiss might've been special to him - and, yeah, the best thing he'd ever felt in his life - but that didn't mean Tony felt the same way.
you why," Steve grits through clenched teeth.  "I told you why, Tony. And it's just not - it's not good, or healthy for you.  Why do you have to act like nobody cares about you when we
He's almost there - almost at that gaze, those brown eyes in that human face that seem so goddamn real, so familiar, so - when the pain in his side flares suddenly and he gags on it, the rolls of it.
"Thought I'd, you know, see the sights." Tony smirks a little. "What better time to explore than in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, right?"
god dammit, not hiding things from each other.  And he has a very good guess about what Tony's doing right now, after that tumultuous morning..
He's suddenly disgusted with himself in a way that burrows down to his bones. A complete stranger, a good and kind and selfless stranger, had taken a chance on him. No one has ever taken a chance on him before. And he hadn't earned this kindness or even deserved it.
Tony scratched the back of his neck with a quick hand, and suddenly he looked kind of nervous.  Far off, Steve's sharp ears could pick up Natasha's loud swearing in Russian and Clint's subsequent shrieks of equal horror and glee, but he couldn't seem to focus on them.  All he could see was Tony standing in front of him, suddenly looking nervous.  That was a miracle unto itself - the engineer billionaire philanthropist hero looking nervous?  Shy?  Even
Tony wakes up and is surprised to discover that he's still alive - even more surprising is the fact that a stranger has, apparently, deigned to save him.
Ever since Thanos was vanquished, the level of crime has gone down significantly all around the world.  Enough that Steve now finds himself wishing there were still villains to fight every week, that he and Natasha and Clint and everyone else got the call to Assemble and meet up, no questions asked, to save the day.  He misses those two more than he'd ever care to admit - Natasha, who still likes to stay quite under the radar although he knows she lives in and out of Clint's.  And Clint himself, who retired (again) directly after the war with Thanos and went straight into Laura Barton's arms.  And he misses Bruce, who - from what he's heard - still lives in Stark Tower, and occasionally travels to India, and meets up with Natasha sometimes.  And, well, he misses Thor too.  Thor, who is the only one who understands what it is like to age slowly.  Even Steve has gotten older, one more crease between his brows than there used to be, but Thor still looks the same with that ancient blue gaze set in a youthful face.  Thor has no one, anymore, not even his weird sometimes-villainous brother or his people, and Steve wonders how he is.  He doesn't think anyone knows how he is.
Inside the Rite Aid, Tony props himself up on a counter, humming a little tune to himself as he stashes rolls of bandages and Neosporin into the front pouch of his pack. He's always been a restless person, twitching and moving and talking to himself, and it shows in the way he drums his fingers along the countertop and taps his feet together. Once he's all set with his haul, he looks around the Rite Aid at the looted shelves and items crushed and scattered across the floor. It's dim in here – no electricity – only lit up by the pale sunlight shining through the glass doors.
"I'm serious," Rhodey continued.  "Everyone sees it but you, with that mountain of insecurities you've got going there, but every time you're in the room Steve's smile grows 100 kilowatts more bright and a lot more nervous."  He pushed Tony gently over to the table and sat him down in front of a steaming bowl of spaghetti.  "Maybe you should tell Steve that it was more than just a kiss for you."
"Never implied that you haven't," the assassin said lightly, eyes glinting with mirth.  "So that kiss really distracted you, hm?  Understandable, considering he's one of the top ten most eligible bachelors this year."
Sam struggles to counter this, because Bucky can't.  "You just seem... like how you were when I first met you, y'know?"
Steve goes to the gym with Clint and Natasha and it's only after dinner with the two that he realizes he hasn't seen Tony yet.  "Crap," he says aloud, and then glances at the assassins. "Tony's probably overworking himself again in the workshop."
This was far closer to the truth than Steve had expected, but when he opened his mouth to adamantly deny it, he started choking and coughing, the memories of his unexpected kiss with Tony like a hairball in his throat.  Steve was no stranger to kisses - he wasn't
A hint of desperation edges into Tony's voice, like he is trying to convince himself of something.  "I'm
If Tony was surprised that Steve was into a guy, he didn't show it.  Instead, he moved closer, something unreadable flashing in his eyes.  "Even straight guys would probably fall all over themselves to have you," he said, letting out a soft chuckle.  "You're the man, soldier."
Heaving a sigh, Tony closes his eyes again. He's not sure how long he'd been unconscious beforehand, but he can already feel exhaustion tugging at him. He can deal with his new slew of problems in the morning.
Later on, when he's had time to think through the argument while trying to figure out exactly how and why it escalated, he'll regret saying it.  He'll curse himself, and hate himself, and wonder how he could have said something like that to his boyfriend. But in the moment, he's just angry and frustrated and suddenly tired from having to deal with Avenging and himself
"I don't think coffee counts as sustenance," Steve says, withholding the food from Tony's grabby hands.  "Wash first."
Steve blinks, and then clears his throat. "Oh, yes. I still have to...check in about…." He seems to lose himself for a moment. Tony waits, patiently – he gets this kind of reaction a lot. "See you later, Stark."
"Hey now, Clint," Steve says affably, but there's a distinct warning underlying his tone. "We're in the middle of an apocalypse. There's hardly any room to judge."
"Worried, huh?" Tony mumbles into his shirt.  His mouth is warm against Steve's chest. "Worried about me, or worried about your reputation?"
He opens his mouth to respond but only blood comes out.  He's blinking, blinking, blinking the sweat from his eyes and it gets in them anyway, and he writhes on the ground a little, and the voice is cursing and pressing something to his side.  He wants to say
"Okay," Tony mutters, low and ashamed.  Steve uncurls his fists and realizes his hands are shaking.  "Uh - Fri. C'n you - "
especially because he's technically twenty and a full-grown adult, but he doesn't know what other half-truths he could admit. "Well, I was staying at home initially – when the apocalypse started back in September – but How – I mean, my dad – kicked me out."
At first he thinks Tony might be confused about it.  The engineer has begun sneaking him looks during movie nights and team meals and a couple of times, Steve has noticed that Tony will begin reaching for his hand only to pull back.
Steve tries to speak and realizes there are tubes running up his nostrils and down his throat.  Immediately, he gags and has to wrench his hand away from Tony's in order to pull at them, tears springing to his eyes as the hoarse, sore, choking feeling intensifies.  The sudden movement causes Tony to stir and he blinks a little, sleepily, before his eyes catch on Steve's and he's instantly alert, standing up and pressing the call button for the nurse before he's flitting anxiously at the blonde's side.
"Wasn't him," Steve interrupts. His voice is firm. "At least, we don't know for sure. And until we do know, we won't be making any assumptions."
During the Before, Tony had been a prodigy, yes, but he'd also been a partier. As the genius son of Howard Stark, a famous weapons manufacturer and celebrity in his own right, Tony grew up in the spotlight. The tabloids were always obsessed with the young Stark who was too rich and too smart for his own good; the attention only increased when he went through puberty and people started to notice him for more than just his brains or father.
If Natasha has recognized him, and dislikes who he was Before, then that'll make things much more difficult. Then again, her partner or companion or whatever had saved his ass, so hopefully they'll let him heal until he's healthy enough to strike out alone.
"What?" Steve said, but Tony cut him off.  "Not so fast, soldier.  I'm still talking.  Uh, so, anyway, just - "  The engineer swallowed thickly.  "I just…  This isn't part of any game, alright?  I'm doing this because I want to."
"It doesn't," Steve muttered, and took a bite of his roast-beef-and-jack.  "And I don't.  Why would you ever - ?"
"Well, yeah." Tony shrugs his shoulders. "But I'm heading cross-country. New York's the most 'cross-country' you can get from California."
nothing like what Tony had expected when he was imagining what "Steve" might look like – but the warmth in Steve's eyes, he'd gotten that right.
The door inches open slowly, and Tony cocks his gun, ready to put a bullet in the next zombie's head.
Instead, he's confronted with an entire outpouring of zombies, men and women alike knocking into each other as they stumble through the doorway. They're moving slowly – maybe the dead zombie had been a lone survivor just like Tony, stepping in to loot the Rite Aid when he'd been ambushed by the hoard – but not slowly enough. There definitely aren't enough bullets for every single one of them.
"It's...it's not that," Steve said awkwardly, feeling his face heat up again.  "I have someone in mind...it's just...he's not interested."
Soon enough they return to their couple routine, and they try to forget about their argument - far from being their loudest one, and yet it haunts Steve's waking thoughts.  After the typical weekly battle against a small-time villain, Tony will have FRIDAY peel back his helmet before walking over to Steve, where the supersoldier is gifted with a face-full of sweaty, tired, gorgeous engineer.  "Hi, soldier," Tony will say, slightly flirtatious and just hushed enough that nobody but Steve can pick up on it.
"Look," Tony says, before he can somehow piss the guy off further, "all I'm saying is, you definitely didn't have to do what you did. But you did anyway, to honor your insane and ridiculously high moral standards, so I owe you one."
is sticking up for him. He knows that Clint has a point, and he feels rather guilty about coming on as an extra, needy body – hell, he's not even sure if he'd opine differently in Clint's position – but it is kind of nice to have other people watching out for him. To not have to be alone.
Hands grip around his ankle and tug, and Tony trips, jaw slamming into the counter. He sees stars as he goes down, and, fuck, he is
Tony gives no indication that he's heard him, and he never even mentions it when Steve forgets later on and ends up retiring to bed.
Outside his room is a long grey corridor. There's hardly any light save for what comes trickling down from a staircase at the far end of the hall, so he assumes he's underground somewhere. He's most likely in a building, so this floor is either for storage or serves as a bunker of some sort. Making his way slowly down the corridor, he checks the handles of each room he passes, but they're all locked.
After that day, he starts seeing things everywhere.  The little redness rimming Tony's eyes, the way his hands shake minutely, the way he sometimes over-enunciates words - as if he's trying to keep himself from slurring.  And there is the smell, of old whiskey hidden away in cupboards and behind shelves and things Tony must have drank today, yesterday, the day before yesterday, that have left their trails in the air like an oil slick.
It's only then that he notices Tony is slumped next to him in a chair, head lolling over the back of it, hair a mess and goatee untrimmed and dark rings under his eyes.  He is snoring softly and his arm is thrown over Steve's legs, hand curled around Steve's own.
"You know my dad drank," he says, a little helpless, a little mad.  "Why would you - Tony, I told you not to. I told you it's a, a hard thing for me.
"You haven't drunk in four months," Steve says.  He's incredulous. How could Tony just - give up - how could he - ?  It hurts. It hurts seeing his father beat his mother every time he closes his eyes and then open them and see his lover, stinking of expensive bourbon, try to excuse himself.
the smirk in the billionaire's voice.  "Lighten up a little, soldier.  It's laser tag.  There are no rules."
"Yeah," Steve says.  He looks down, into Sharon's eyes.  They are plain brown, but they are kind, and they don't hurt him to look at.
It's dead silent. After a moment, Natasha nods, so Tony takes his place at the corner of the table. The tension in the room is almost unbearably awkward, but because he's Tony Stark and he's learned how to grin and bear it, he plants his elbows on the table and says, "Hi. I'm Tony. Who're all of you?"
Faintly, he heard Natasha let out a disbelieving scoff, but it sounded far away as his mind drifted back into the past.  For one teeny, tiny second, Steve kind of wished he'd just stayed the shrimpy little guy from Brooklyn his heart had left behind all those years ago.  Because now, he had stamina and a great memory and no medical issues to worry about, but the one thing he wanted most was utterly unreachable.
It's been sixteen years since Thanos came and tried to kill off half the universe, and fifteen since the Avengers and the magician people and these weird aliens from outer space came together to save the galaxy once and for all.  And, you know, they did it.  People died, as people do, but all in all everyone Steve loved from this century got through it.  And thank God for that, because he's sick and tired of losing people he loves.
Tony stares at the doorway that Natasha's just exited, his mouth opening and closing. He's not sure if it's just him, but he gets the feeling that she
Steve gets to see that little boy, sometimes.  In bed, when they are making love and Tony is eager to please but withdrawn when it comes to his own needs.  In the workshop, when he's scribbling equations and inventing things beyond Steve's comprehension and tries to toss the schematics, ranting about how useless they are.  In their relationship, when Tony buys him things he doesn't need or want, because Tony thinks the only thing he has to give is everything but himself.
Biting back a whimper of pain, Tony scrambles onto his feet and puts his fists up. He can't ditch his bag; and the zombie's standing neatly between him and the counter. He'll have to do this the hard way, then.
He checks the bedroom, just in case, hoping that he's wrong.  But Tony's not there. So he goes to the bar and sure enough, there's a dark form hunched over on one of the barstools, head down.
He itches to reach out for Tony's arm, tug him in and hold him close, but then he remembers that Clint and Nat are with them and it wouldn't be appropriate.
"I had it under control," Steve rasps out.  He's given up on the tubes. "Just...got distracted.  When you yelled." He feels like he needs to prove something, to himself, somehow.  That is why he says it, shoves away the blame - no other reason, and the shame wallows in his gut but he won't take it back.
Tony finally relents, scrubbing the dirt and metallic scent from his fingers before reaching out to take the lasagna.  "Th'nks," he mumbles thickly around a mouthful of food.
Unfortunately, that also meant that Tony wouldn't be coming after him this time - there would be no need.  Of course, maybe Tony still didn't know that Clint was the one with the flag; but based on the loud, high-pitched shout of "TASHA, COME GET IT" his teammate had let out only minutes before that helpfully let the whole arena know which of Team Blue had the flag, it wasn't likely.
"Call us, or come talk to us, if you need anythin'," Bucky says seriously.  "I mean, knock first though.  Sam likes to have fun in the middle of the livin' room."
"I have no idea what's going on here," Clint interrupts. "Bruce, I didn't know you were this famous."
"Good work today," he says into his mic, adjusting the shield straps on his arm.  "Head to Forty Fourth where the quinjet is and we'll have a quick debriefing at SHIELD before we can head home."
Tony supposes there are worse ways to go. He supposes he'd rather this than turn into a zombie, stripped of his identity and reduced to a mindless cannibal.
"I cannot provide that information," FRIDAY says, and this one little sentence tells Steve everything he needs to know.
That better not be the sound he thinks it is, because if there are more zombies in the Rite Aid, Tony is going to be pissed. Like, inferno-blazing, roid-rage, rip-your-hair-out pissed. Not just at his situation but at
