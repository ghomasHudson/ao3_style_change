does, especially when he is mad, but it’s relieving not to find any text like that anyway. He has to see him in his next class, so it’s fine, he’ll know. Probably Steve doesn’t remember any of that, yes, that was why he was acting normal in the kitchen. Hopefully it didn’t jump on his mind later.
how, something happens. The kiss is too…. great. He doesn’t want to move or to do anything else but kissing him like this. Is warm, and fast but slow and is familiar but different at the same time. He is probably too drunk to spice things up anyway, so he ignores the nausea feeling he gets all of the sudden and keeps on kissing him.
“Hello! Could you pay me attention here? Who are you talking about?” Tony is suddenly getting frustrated and he doesn't even know why.
He tries not to give it much thought and he lets himself fall into the bed without even turning off the lights. He closes his eyes and then, he remembers walking into his bedroom and falling into bed like this last night.
“In your
“So… where were we?” Tony asks seductively in a whisper, smiles and he puts his lips into Aaron’s. It’s soft, and a slow, and the rooms keeps on getting bigger and smaller and moving a little, but when he tries to intensify the kiss like he
Aaron said they were always together and that was something Tony couldn’t argue with. Bucky and Steve were glued by the hip and that was the first reason Bucky joined the group in the first place. Tony loves Bucky, he trusts him, the guy is crazy and sarcastic as he is and they became good friends in the last years. All of them. Bucky is smart and sharp and they share a bunch of classes since they are in the same engineer mayor, and is awesome to have someone like him around. So it’s not like Tony felt like he was forced to be friends with Bucky just to keep being friends with Steve, Bucky was great on his own and he became important on their group. But yeah, their friendship with Bucky? Pretty much Steve made it happen.
They keep walking to their next class, some people keep flashing smiles at both of them. They turn in the foyer and start going upstairs.
Aaron wasn’t in his bed this morning.
“Great party sir” he approaches him and almost attacks him with a glass of water and an aspirin. “Looks like everything went down like you intended to”
“I like Steve”
“You! I hope you go to hell” she says when he passes by.
“Do you know where I left my phone? Could you call me?”
friendly and Tony notices cause in that same second he clears his throat again.
“He is in my knitting club”
Steve doesn’t answer his question or seems to care about what Tony is saying at all, he stirs both hands for his face and takes a couple of minutes to stand up. When he does, he stumbles a little and Tony grins.
“Nothing, let’s go.”
“Sorry sorry but you got my point. You don’t like him, you are not in love with him, maybe you are just attracted to him” Bruce pushes his glasses up with one finger.
“Exactly ONCE is the key word in there. Good God, you do something once and they never let you forget it.”
“Stark… you are the man” he gets close to Tony to do a fist bump and give him a quick hug and Steve just looks amused at the whole scene. It’s obvious that Clint is happy cause he got laid last night.
Steve was.
and ever since Tony is distant. Steve tried to be his normal self, but… Is hard when Tony isn’t. He just wants to give him his time. But the fear of Tony needing space forever has been starting to kick in. He doesn’t really get it. Tony kisses everyone, he doesn’t know why Tony got so caught up on this anyway.
There’s people sleeping in different parts of the house still, like the couch in the living room, the bathroom and surprisingly the backyard too. And Tony is sure it rained at some point during the night.
“Agh! I’m out of here. You are a son of a bitch Daniel!” The girl yells again and someone throws something to the ground and in that exact moment, someone in Tony’s bed sits down abruptly, waking up violently.
So it’s supposed to be fine! Why is he panicking? Steve is not the kind of person who would make out with a friend just
Bruce starts to sit up straight. “Tony they are friends. They have been friends since they are kids. You are hallucinating”
“Hey fellas” Clint walks in the kitchen and Steve actually grins.
“Shut up” Bruce bites his pizza and gestures to Tony to grab a bite at his. So Tony does, even tho now he is less hungry than ever. Bruce takes his phone to look at something in the screen and show Tony. “So anyway, look at this -“
“So you are just playing ignoring each other?”
about the warning signs, died. The kiss was warm, and slow, and Steve ended up letting himself be carried away, moving his lips too, kissing him back. And
“Exactly! What if they are? Why do you care so much? They will still be our friends, nothing changes. Cut it out. If they are dating
came.
“I thought his boyfriend was the dick” Aaron shugs and lifts his shoulders up. “Oh look! There’s a play in two weeks!” He says when they walk pass a poster in the foyer and he stops on his tracks, making Tony stop too.
Aaron makes a groaning sound. “Aaron come here” Tony realizes that he is sounding needy and that he is slurring the words a little but well, he is going to let the embarrassment for when he sobers up.
He needs a shower, an aspirin and… three days of sleep. The cold water wakes him up a little and his reflection in the mirror looks back defeated, with dark holes under his eyes. “Yeah, any other good ideas?” He asks himself and his voice sounds raspy like he smoked ten packs of cigarettes. Maybe he did.
“Do you want something to eat? Agh I need coffee ASAP” Tony starts to prepare the coffee maker and Steve saves the water in the fridge again.
“Well, why don’t you ask him?”
Is Tony’s turn to roll his eyes and he lets himself fall in the bed.
It’s been almost two weeks since the party and the…. well,
“I hate you sometimes.”
Tony kisses his friends but only when he knows everything will be fine afterwards, like, when he is sure there’ll be no awkward moments later or explaining to do. The night he kissed Bruce, it was fun and for a game and they were normal after it, laughing about someone doing something stupid in the game they were playing right one second after that kiss. And nothing was ever uncomfortable. They never wanted to kiss each other again either, it was just for a drinking game.
So okay. They do spend a lot of time together but… that’s what you do when you know someone from your whole life. Tony met his friend Rhodey when he was a kid and you could say they spend an awful lot of time together even if Rhodey is in the military now. So it was normal. It was fine.
Then it hits him.
“Nono I’m telling you it wasn’t fun, she jumped on me! Nearly tackled me down and everything”
It’s a sunny morning. They been sitting in the grass of the campus park studying for the past hour. Natasha is studying business, and Steve is going for the art mayor. He never gets entirely satisfied with what he does even if his teachers always congratulate him and try to make him see how great his technique is. Bucky and Natasha threaten to kill him every single time he hesitates over delivering some work or every time he wants to throw something to the garbage can, so he obeys.
“Hey” he says surprised, he doesn’t remember seeing his friend since the begging of last night’s party. He didn’t ask himself where Steve was, but he was sure he was sleeping in some other bedroom of the house. So it means he came to check on Tony. Even tho he looks like he just woke up.
Bruce has no idea how Tony got to that conclusion while he was explaining to him something about gamma rays he read on a science blog this morning. He even looks at the phone screen for a second trying to find some clue in there.
Steve rolls his eyes playfully at the nickname. Ever since he told Nat that his teammates called him Captain when he got to be lider in a project, he teases him with that. The whole group does.
“Easily. We are not dating.”
"Look the other way," Clint commented casually. "I have the invitation and I will be there without my bow. If the world goes up in flames, I will be ready with my arsenal of daggers. Unlike the rest of you, who will be looting a kitchen for some knives."
Steve nodded again with a small smile and, like a good soldier, continued to eat his dinner, eyes firmly fixed on the table. What if these weeks would be the last time he would spend moments with Tony alone? The idea was killing him.
"That's true," Steve could second Tony's opinion. He watched him study the details of the room and then start talking about the Mayor's antiqued mahogany table. Steve's heart started to feel a bit warmer, because from the furniture in the Mayor's mansion they smoothly steered the conversation to the Tower's equipment and furnishings.
"I don't know yet." Tony processed the moments fairly quickly and found nothing. "FRIDAY, I want some different angles. Profile maybe." Tony haven't even been paying attention to the fact that he had almost inhaled the food. His eyes narrowed, but the angle wasn't good at all. Tony hoped Steve would slip up again. He was absolutely sure he had seen Steve looking at his mouth yesterday.
Tony was wearing his most expensive grey Armani suit, shining Hudson loafers and black Ray-Bans. No one would accuse him of not looking his best for that signing ordeal. No one would be able to tell that all he wanted was to be back in the safety of his workshop. No one would guess his heart was beating like crazy thanks to the super soldier next to him.
Tony angrily slammed the door of their bedroom and looked at the super soldier with narrowed eyes. The mood stayed with him for the entirety of three seconds.
"May I ask what is it you're searching for, Boss? I could be of help if you would specify what you want to find." FRIDAY sounded confused.
"My calculations are spot-on, Boss."
"But you will get through this," the king continued.
"Captain Rogers left the Tower ten minutes ago and is now on his way back, Boss. I would never have let him go out without tracking his progress. He informed me where he was going and I have been with him every step of the way. Just to be safe," the artificial intelligence assured Tony.
Tony threw the screwdriver across the room in a desperate attempt to release his sudden anger. It was the love thing again. He could write an essay about how to be in love with a person you don't want to love. This time he couldn't lie to himself, because the truth was staring him in the face too openly. Tony wanted to be important enough to Steve. Tony wanted to be the person Steve would choose first over anybody, but at the same time he hated that feeling. It made Tony too vulnerable.
"What way?" Steve murmured, his words almost inaudible.
"Certainly, Captain Rogers."
"You're not scaring me, super soldier. You want me to trust you to take your safety seriously, but you don't believe me when I say I know myself."
"It's fine, Steve. He's Tony Stark. Everyone wants to kill him at some point or another."
"I remember better days," Steve answered politely, averting his eyes from Tony’s. Steve was always the polite and proper one. Tony couldn't force his gaze to shift away from him. Steve’s hair suddenly fascinated him. He wanted nothing more than to brush away the wet golden lock that had fallen onto Steve's forehead.
"You're working on your robot?" Rhodey asked in astonishment, but the pleasure on his face was evident.
"Tony, that man loves you," T'Challa stated calmly. "And no matter what happened, you love him as well. It is not a question of how you two will get through this. It is a question of when you are going to accept your feelings for him and when he is going to accept his guilt."
want to sign the Accords with the rest of the Avengers, but to hell with everything, more than that, he wanted to be back home in his workshop. Hiding from the rest of the world sounded better by the minute.
Tony narrowed his eyes in suspicion. "What is ready?" This was not Steve's normal behavior. "What are you up to?"
In the end, it wasn’t Tony who had told the people about their departing. It was T'Challa, and Tony was grateful for that. T'Challa had led him to the elevator, but instead of going down, he had pressed the button for the rooftop. The king's female bodyguards remained standing in front of the access to the roof and let them go through.
Tony straightened in his chair and wheeled around with a worried frown on his forehead. "What do you mean, not on the premises? He didn't tell me he's going out. Has something happened? Is someone else with him?" Because that was exactly what they needed - people recognizing Steve on the street and harass him.
"Yes. Theoretically. The last lab results showed significant improvement of the serum. It’s stronger than whatever poison they tried to contaminate him with," Bruce nodded thoughtfully, his eyes landing on their connected hands. He blinked twice, then switched his attention back to the topic at hand. "The bad news is, I think this is just a testing batch to test the effects on the super serum."
"Do you, err---" Tony cleared his throat. His heart was beating like crazy. "---maybe--- want to buy a ring?" Tony hesitated.
This whole situation was also Steve's fault. As much as they teased each other, they still didn't go much further than kissing because Tony waited for Steve to bring the subject onto the table. And Steve, confused as ever, didn't know how to broach the subject without feeling mortified simultaneously. He was a good fifty years Tony’s senior, and still, some things took him longer than average teenagers.
"Boss, I can turn the screen off," FRIDAY offered maybe for a fifth time.
"Yes."
Steve never allowed himself to become helplessly out of control like the day they had kissed for the first time. Thankfully, at that time, Steve’s body and strength hadn’t been fully restored. Now he felt like it was too dangerous for Tony.
Tony internally squirmed under Steve's gaze. But nothing would make him shy away from those eyes. He was still Tony Stark. Stark men didn’t shy away from anything. Yet, that right there was not how Steve should look at him in a room full of people.
Tony blinked several times in confusion after his retreat. Well, if this wasn't awkward, he didn't know what would be. Tony reached for the paper bag. Under the unreasonable amount of napkins - because people were supposed to eat and not made a mess by Captain America's standards - were two hot dogs. Tony's stomach growled loudly. Right, dinner. He hadn't eaten all day.
"That's good. It looks like you're past your differences."
Steve fought to maintain his sanity every time he felt Tony's mouth on his. The heat of Tony's body just wasn't enough. Steve craved Tony's skin. Every soft sigh he made had Steve yearn to hear him whimper and gasp with pleasure. And the more he kissed Tony, the more Steve ached to be closer.
Tony wanted to cover him, but there were no curtains, blankets or anything else to be used. He himself was still in his armor, and one look around let him know that the other Avengers were all clothed in spandex or other clingy materials. If Thor were present, he could have lent his cape, but he was still fighting his own war in Asgard. T’Challa wore his suit, but Tony felt bad asking the king of Wakanda to lend him a suit jacket. That was just wrong on so many levels, no matter how good friends they were. Thankfully, Tony’s eyes landed on a certain genius scientist.
"I believe you were considering Butterfingers to be brought to the home network again," FRIDAY answered gravely.
Tony wanted to reply, but he turned quickly to Steve instead when he noticed his breathing was far too labored and the skin in Tony's grip felt too warm to the touch. "Steve? Bruce!" He quickly backed away and let the doctor examine him.
" the super soldier deadpanned.
"Nothing for now."
"I almost killed him. I didn't want to, but---"
"Boss, I have to inform the Avengers about your order," the AI pointed out, clearly knowing his intentions. Crap!
Steve opened his mouth to say something, but his voice just wasn't there. He couldn't deny Tony's words, but at the same time, he couldn't speak the truth out loud.
Steve saw the War Machine suit levitate and then land back on its feet to face them. A second later, the armor started to fold back into itself.
When the details were finally hammered into his mind and Tony would be able to repeat them in his sleep, Pepper let him off the hook and left him to his thoughts. Tony didn’t know if it was better or worse. He palmed the tablet in his pocket, looked at some of his measurements and ideas for making Rhodey’s suit even better and tried to lose his mind in the details and inventing. Not that it helped any, because he was still aware of Steve’s body near his. When he closed his eyes, he could almost feel the warmth radiating from the super soldier.
For a second, neither of them moved. They were both on the crossroads. The past long months had led them to this one decision that was about to define their future.
In the end, they had only proven Ross right, that they couldn’t be trusted, that they needed to be controlled to protect everyone else from
Tony gleefully rubbed his hands. "Are you up for it, honey?"
"When you're touching me, I want to feel you so much closer I'm terrified I will hurt you because I can't think clearly." Steve logically argued with himself that he would never press the man he loved to the ground or bed and cause him another one of his panic attacks. No matter how much he wanted to feel Tony's body underneath him.
Tony felt Steve's fingers slowly lift his tank top and caress the skin of his sides with his fingertips.
T'Challa's cadence of voice made Tony finally feel some peace. The king sounded all soothing and reasonable. "You're good at psychobabble."
Within seconds, they were both drenched in hot water. Tony could finally switch his attention back to Steve. The super soldier had stopped struggling and was watching him. Steve’s pupils were dilated, his body tight under Tony’s hands.
"On it." Natasha nodded and left.
"Not a scratch," Tony assured him. He took a step forward and leaned against Steve's chest, seeking shelter in the arms of the man he loved. That had been close. Someone had tried to kill him. On the Presidential Gala no less. God. This was such a mess. Working with the Secret Service would be a
"Do you want to listen to the audio file, Boss?"
"Guys, here’s your blanket." Bruce gave Tony the fabric and stepped back while Tony wrapped it around Steve's shoulders. "I talked to the doctors. We have a bed ready for you."
"What do you mean by negative? Talk to me!" Tony stood up. "Where is he?"
. Steve had just smiled, pleased with himself and the world in general. Tony had ignored the whole class of school children - they were all so beneath him - and focused on the video conference.
"Nothing on the record, Boss."
Tony's focus was laser sharp on the small device clenched in a vice which he was currently working on. He had tried to put the fucking bolt into the hole for the fifteenth time, and the motherfucker just didn't stay there. With a frustrated exhale and anger seething through his movements, he finally forced the device out with his fingers and threw it as far away from himself as possible. It didn't help at all. He was still pissed off, and he felt like murdering someone. Most definitely himself.
Tony was grateful Bruce hadn't left, because he sure as hell wouldn't be able to dress Steve in the dark blue scrubs alone. Both the good doctor and the super soldier were out of breath when they were finished and Steve was sitting on a stool, shivering.
But then again - why the hell would Steve tell Tony about his problems? What had Tony expected? That they would suddenly be the best fucking pals and pick each other’s fucking braids?
"I may have been at fault. I wasn't too forward with sharing the information about your current state and told him you have a new unspecific sleeping pattern," FRIDAY admitted nervously.
"I can make some references too, you know. I told you I watched the Star Wars movies with Sam."
Tony looked into those pleading eyes and sighed. "Why?" What was so wrong with T'Challa that Steve didn't feel comfortable in his presence? Tony didn’t understand what it was that bothered Steve so much about the Black Panther.
"You know what, Rogers?"
Tony dragged his eyes to Steve's face. This awkward atmosphere was worse than them yelling at each other. Steve looked pale, and he obviously had trouble breaking his stare from Iron Man's chest plate, as if he was lost in his own memories of Siberia as Tony had been before. But damn, the blond man looked good. At least Tony could be satisfied he had a good taste in men.
"What's wrong with your clothes?"
"To a shop a few doors down," FRIDAY answered vaguely.
"You're wrong." Steve was aware Tony was trying to provoke a reaction from him. They both knew each other too well.
Steve's body stiffened when the barrel of the gun was pointed at Tony's chest.
Tony should have said that aloud. He definitely should say something. There was no reason for him not to speak, but the words were locked inside his throat. Tony tracked Steve's hands as he put down a paper bag.
"Mr. Stark?" Vision floated into his line of sight with his eyes intensely focused on Tony's face. The tilt of his head suggested he was trying to figure him out, and his tone was concerned. Tony had heard the question
"You have a point," Tony conceded, nodding.
And fuck it, if that royal bastard wasn't right.
"What about---" There was one person who would know what was going on with Tony, but she and Tony were currently in an off phase of their relationship.
"You look nice."
"FRIDAY, seal the door and don't let anyone in."
Steve hunched his shoulders and nodded. Tony saw him sway again, and then Steve's legs gave out under him, but Tony caught him in time and lifted him into his arms without trouble. Thank God for the Iron Man suit.
Sometimes, Steve wanted nothing more than to cross the distance between them, kiss Tony senseless and forget the world around them. And now, his breath stilled. The tension between them was way worse than usual.
Steve felt Tony shift nervously. "You want to know the real Tony Stark? He will let you hurt him, even kill him, just to assure no one else will get hurt. He's so used to people hurting him, he doesn't even care about himself."
"You left without giving me a chance to talk to you." Steve sets his bag down by the door and shrugs out of his coat, announcing his intention to stay until he gets the answers he wants and needs. "What else was I supposed to do?"
“So what are we, really?” Falcon asked after a beat. “A team now?”
The woman rises from the piano bench when Steve approaches. She glides past him like a whisper, leaving a hint of perfume on the air.
"You're like a cat," Tony accused, tipping Steve's chin up to get his hair under the spray of water again.
The sound doesn't go unnoticed by the man's companions, and bullets begin to rain through the bedroom door. Steve rolls out of the way, ripping off the towel to avoid getting tangled in it, and comes up on the other side of the doorframe as one of the other Hydra agents comes rushing inside.
Tony wanted to say something. He really, sincerely wanted to open his mouth, but the words flew from his mind, and his throat was stuck with a lump the size of the United States. Steve's voice in that soft tone was his doing, and that realization made him tear up.
For the first time, Tony had stood against Captain America, and in that moment, he had known the superhero would kill him. The man had worn the same face as his friend, Steve, but had been steadily pressing onto the glass of the already damaged arc reactor, and Tony had known these were his last seconds.
Tony watched Hawkeye survey the area from the highest building in close proximity. The streets were still infested with dead spider robots and rubble. They were both observing the cleaning group of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s agents as they made slow progress.
like a beloved national icon capable of protecting the world. Tony wanted nothing more than to hold him in his arms until Steve had gained his strength back. The vulnerability spoke to some primal part in Tony and woke the need to protect the super soldier at any cost inside him.
"I need to shower. I smell like the hospital."
Tony sucked on his thumb, getting the blood away and inspecting the wound. His uselessness annoyed him even more. He hunted down his first aid kit, searched for a band-aid, slapped it on the booboo and then wiped all the contents onto the floor. The blueprints followed very quickly, but no. Even this stupid outburst didn’t help at all. He was still furious with himself, because he cared. He wanted to know why Steve had looked so defeated and miserable.
"Yeah, well---" He trailed off.
Tony drummed his fingers on the soda can. Shit. Well, she was right. Tony couldn't violate the privacy of all the other Avengers just for the niggling feeling of suspicion. Well, he could, but--- Alright. He was being a bit hasty. They did deserve their privacy. Not that he would want to talk it through with the Black Widow. She would probably break some of his bones if she found out about the cameras. Clint really deserved a quiet time. Rhodey too. And Vision.
Tony suppressed a sigh. Pepper really was like a terrier once she took some idea into her head. "Yes. Everyone saw us together. I happen to own that Tower, and as an owner, I take it as a personal duty to greet everyone of my guests. Spit it out, Pepper. I don’t have all day." Neither did he want to talk about his friend. Tony was pretty sure the national icon in the other part of the suite could hear every word.
. Tony grinned and allowed his gaze to follow the fine ass of the super soldier in dress pants who hadn't waited for him and continued on his way to the common room where the rest of the Avengers were waiting. Well, sometimes Steve teased or flirted back just a tiny bit. Not with crude words like Tony, but in his own subtle way.
in the Long Time Ago Outtakes.
"No," Tony admitted calmly. "Sorry. Again, please." He needed to stop thinking about Steve and Steve’s problems. This time, he gave Pepper his full attention, making sure to remember the name of the host of the television show they would be appearing in.
"Stubborn asshole."
"Tony," Rhodey said with a warning tone.
Her gentle smile hurt. "Is he---" Steve didn't have to finish. She knew him.
Howard would never ally with Hydra. Steve could only hope his son was the same.
“Two, please”.
Rodgers?”
That's--That's not possible. Hydra was defeated when the Red Skull was killed. Everyone said so.
As the elevator dinged for the second floor, Sitwell smirked at him unnervingly, leaned over, and whispered directly into his ears, "
Sitwell chuckled softly. “No need for formalities here, Captain. We're all on the same side. Call me Jasper.”
“Oh please, call me Tony. Mr. Stark was my father, whom you've met.” Stark—Tony didn't bother even looking at him, so intent he was on the screen.
“Nonsense, this is nothing. Did I tell you about the time I stayed up over ninety hours building JARVIS? Those were the good-old-days,” Stark looked wistful for a moment before continuing. “Anyways, what do you need? In case you haven't noticed, I'm trying to find Loki here. It is proving to be like trying to find a black hole with a binocular.” He sighed in frustration.
“I had a very strange conversation this morning with Agent Sitwell.” Steve began.
“Floor, Agent?”
The sound of Tony's mocking laughter followed him outside.
sounded like an obvious lie. At Steve’s glare he corrected. “Three hours. Okay fine, not at all. What do you
“Yes sir,” A disembodied English accent came out of the computer and Steve jumped.
Steve had to take a few deep breaths to calm down. Did Stark have to rile him up like this?
“Ooooh sarcasm from Captain America, is that legal?” Stark seemed delighted, which Steve stalwartly ignored.
“We're going to get that sonofabitch or else,” Director Fury had said. “And you all will stay here where we can reach you until we do. No going off the radar on this one. I'm looking at you, Stark.”
with it, per say. The army certainly had some of that going on during the war. It was just unexpected to hear someone he knew say it out loud. He'd reviewed videos an articles of the Civil Rights movement, and he thought it was great, honestly.
“I think you need to go to bed.”
“Ha. Ha. Ha. You're a riot, Cap.” Stark bounded over to one of the bright screens and started typing impossibly fast. “I don't have all my tools here, so this will take a while. You ready, J?”
He went to Fury first, to find out the address of the hotel, claiming it was about reviewing tactics for teamwork. Fury had eyed him skeptically, but rattled off the place. Walking through the familiar yet unfamiliar streets of New York was enough to dim Steve's spirits, but now Steve was here and Stark
“The government.”
Stark crossed his arms and leaned against the doorway. “So? Out with it. You look like you've just seen the president grope the American flag right in front of you.”
“I'll call you when there's punching to be done! That's your only specialty, right?”
, Loki had gotten away with the tesseract. Seeing him escape when he'd been
Bucky was dead. That was that. Steve closed his eyes and tried to sleep.
Just as he was about turn around and leave, a monitor flashed a glowing picture of Loki grabbing the Tesseract and vanishing. No, he needed to do this. What was a little humiliation in the face of protecting the world, like he was made to do?
Stark waved his hand flippantly. “Don’t worry ‘bout it. Apparently she can't handle dating someone who ‘flies nukes into black holes without a second thought’.”
Steve gingerly sat down on a miraculously uncovered chair. He tied to think of how to say it without coming off as an absolute lunatic.
“Um—” Steve tried to change the subject.
“I don't
I'm still mad about endgame destroying literally all of my ships at once. At least they might give us some new ones. What do you guys think about Sam/Bucky? They've had a rough start (-can you move your seat up? -No. and -You couldn't have done that earlier? -I hate you.) but I guess it could be cute. The new TV series gives me hope.
What the fuck was that?
Wow, 2012 Steve and Tony really don't get along. Why do I ship them again? Oh right, this little thing called SEXUAL TENSION.
“Ooh, did he come on to you? Never would have thought him the type but whatever,” Stark grinned lecherously. “Did no one tell you about gay rights in your ‘Welcome to the Twenty-first-century’ handbook? Gay, bi, pan, ace; it's all a-okay now. Just look at me,”  He gestured vaguely around, presumably at his immense wealth.
bullshit and she will be eating out of your hand just like the rest of the world."
"Steve---"
"Fine, FRIDAY," Tony mumbled, ignoring his galloping heart.
Time slipped away from Tony again.
"There is nothing between me and Bucky." Steve was getting annoyed by these suggestions. "I'm not and won't ever be in love with Bucky."
"You're afraid you will break me with your super dick, or something?" Tony smirked, and the tension between them was gone.
"Pepper?" Tony's forehead creased with confusion. Why the hell would they have a conversation about Pepper?
"You looked happy."
"You bought me a wheelchair?" Rhodey looked at him in confusion.
Well, ok. As much as Tony wanted to know if he was right about Steve, upsetting the others wasn't his intention. It would lead to more yelling, and this time they would be on the righteous part.
"How are you doing? Anything going on in the neighborhood, Steve?"
specimen of dating material.
Tony was angry. That was the only way to describe his emotions. He wanted to yell at the whole world and not keep smiling at the U.N. representatives and sign the Sokovia Accords. Alright, yes. He
"Clint? Thank you."
"Hm?" Tony blinked for a moment and then focused his eyes on Pepper who tried to explain some shit or another. Who gave a fuck? Certainly not him, but she worked hard at making the Avengers looked good.
"Thanks, buddy," Tony whispered. He immediately winced, ashamed of his words. He didn't have any right to refer to T'Challa that way. It really wasn't very respectful behavior towards the king.
in his workshop - the human one with altered DNA, also known as Captain Popsicle, that almost never left his side was nowhere to be found. "FRIDAY, where's Steve?"
"Good. Ok." Tony nodded, but then stood up, obviously distracted. "That's good."
Dinner? What time was it? The concept of time had obviously slipped from Tony’s perception again. "I'm working." How the hell could Steve look so lost and unsure and raw and---? Tony wanted nothing more than to erase the uncertainty and hug him close. Yeah, the love thing again. Fuck it!
“What?”
, they will tell us when they are ready. Stop prouding.”
a good idea to drink that last tequila shot Clint insisted in taking.
Steve, makes his stomach jump, his heart race and the sensation of wanting to hide his face between his hands in embarrassment. He can’t hide it. It wasn’t a normal drunk kiss that you will give to anyone on a party, it wasn’t something that you could move on from. It wasn’t meaningless and he can’t pretend anymore that is fine when it’s not. He can’t pretend that it felt the same as kissing any other of his friends because he wants to do it again. He keeps wondering what would be like to kiss Steve being sober and paying all the possible attention. He wants to feel Steve’s hands on his waist again putting him closer. And that’s why it hits him.
“Okay, so… we were leaving” Tony offers and Aaron smiles weirdly and keeps standing there like the blond dumb doll he is and Steve shakes his head. Anyone could’ve notice that Tony was trying to get them to move. Tony grins and grabs him by the arm “Come on baby”.
“Yeah! But she slapped me! She was angry like if her boyfriend cheated on her with me”
He presses Aaron’s face harder and separates their mouths to breathe a little. In that moment Aaron puts his hands on Tony’s waist and presses him against him and Tony can’t resist to lower his head again and put his mouth over his even if the dizziness gets worse.
Bruce looks up from his book to watch his friend storming in his room.
------------------------------------
What if Steve and Bucky
Oh yes, he knew he forgot something.
“Tony why would you say something like that? Now I’m picturing it! Jesus, that’s disgusting.”
The body moves “Tony?” He asks.
“Are you even listening to me Cap? I asked about your architecture project. The one you told me about last week.”
He washes his teeth with disgust and washes his face again before going out. This time walking a little better.
“You forgot to eat for two days once”
“Shit. Okay, well look, it doesn’t matter alright? He’ll get over it”
“No! Bruce pay attention would you? If he doesn’t remember and I ask him, then he’ll know! First I have to see if he is acting weird or if he says something that proves me he remembers”
They all have lunch together. Tony can’t avoid it and Steve wasn’t trying to, so they all sit in the table. Natasha and Bruce are talking about the chemistry test Bruce has next week, and Clint steals some of Natasha’s fries while he laughs really loud with Tony. Bucky is playing with his phone and Thor and Steve are participating in the conversation but more focused on the food in the trays.
“Not that I’m complaining but no one is ever that happy to see me. Should I suspect something?”
“Whatever floats your boat”
“Yeah, sorry about the mess, I… couldn’t find the room and then the bed”  He whispers and laughs a little, bearing his face in the pillow. He is laying now, but the room is spinning.
“For god’s sake this is my room!” He yells and Aaron elbows him. “What? They should be grateful I don’t kick them out to fuck you”
about what happened. Steve doesn’t know how much time Tony is going to need, but he hopes they can get over this soon.
“I’m telling you something important here! This is an emergency! How could this happen right under our noses? Steve and Bucky!”
“Tony!” Someone yells in disgust and he can’t even open his eyes yet.
“Show me or I’ll kill you”
“I should’ve never teach you sarcasm. Now is biting me in the ass”
“Oh I remember you! You are the girl who was yelling in the morning! The one the boyfriend cheated on, right?”
“Yeah, I get it but… I don’t know, you are right, maybe I’m just confused. I can’t like Steve. We are friends. Let's forget about this and move on.”  Tony breathes, smiles the best way he can and then he clears his throat. "You were saying?" He gestures towards the now forgotten phone on the table.
. It was the normal thing people did at parties. Tony muttered something in his lips, with Aaron’s name and then, he threw himself to the side and groaned when his head hit the pillow. Steve stood there, with a hand on his forehead, looking at the dark ceiling trying to calm his breathing for a good five minutes before untangling Tony’s legs from his to put Tony’s body completely on his side of the bed without any part of him, touching Steve.
“I need a second coffee” he mutters to himself and walks to the cafeteria instead of his first class.
Oh someone’s been talking. “Huh?”
? No, you know what, nevermind. Let’s go grab some lunch”
“There’s something going on between Bucky and Steve!” He slammed the door and walked in to sit on the bed.
You have no idea what's next!!! Thanks for the kudos💕
“Hey!” Some girl yells sleepily and Tony doesn’t even bother to say sorry this time. He is too busy entering his bed and noticing the warm body inside the covers. Thank god Aaron is here right where he left him. They can’t exactly sleep together in a room full of people (Tony is not that much of a pervert yet) but at least they can make out.
Bruce finds him in the hall. “Oh thank God” Tony yells grabbing him by the arm and pulling him close so they can walk side to side.
was just a couple of stairs away? Okay maybe he was tired. Maybe they fell asleep watching a movie. It was okay.
His entire body was under Tony’s, the sensation uncomfortable and awkward at the same time that…. familiar and
“How much did you drink last night Steve?”
“And you left?”
“You are probably right on that one, but we can’t let my paranoia go uninvestigated.”
There’s no hate messages on his phone from Rogers or a “we need to talk” message so that’s fine. Not like Steve would decide to talk things out 'cause he
He also takes his jacket off, which he doesn’t remember when he put it on in the first place, and then takes a deep breath.
“That was really awkward Steve. Would you talk it out?” Nat says once the pair is gone. Steve tightness his jaw.
Steve just does without answering and then he says it went straight to voicemail. “It must be out of battery somewhere.” He says but Steve twitches his mouth before looking at his own phone again and Tony knows that he is thinking that someone probably stole it 'cause the house was full of strangers. Tony rolls his eyes as the machine starts working and Steve side smiles cause they never really needed much words to know what the other is thinking.
“I’m going to pretend that you are using that tired tone cause we are on the stairs and not because you are tired of my problem.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh my god don’t put it like that! Jeez” Tony brings his hand up his forehead.
“Come on, let’s go grab something to eat, I’m starving.”
On their way to Steve’s bedroom (the one he shares with some korean boy who pretends not to know english so he doesn’t have to talk to Steve) they run into Tony and Aaron.
“There's something going on between Bucky and Steve”
Right?
that it meant that he likes him? He thinks about Steve laughing, or making that serious frowny face he makes while he draws, or wearing that blue hoodie that Tony loves so much on him, and his heart
“Are you still angry with Steve? He is nice” Aaron says as they walk away and seriously, Tony has to cut this boy lose. Why is he seeing him again?
“Tony have you eaten today? I mean if you forgot to go to lunch...”
“Agh God, this is going to be a terrible hangover. But whatever, wanna make out?” He blurts a laugh a bit louder this time and someone shush him from across the room.
, and with that much alcohol still in his system.
There’s just Steve in his room right now. Sitting at the end of his bed, staying far away from Tony’s puke. Is just them, and the mess of course.
Steve gives him a face. “Yeah, he keeps going through that too”
“Something like idiocy? He is been going through that for the last 20 years, it’s not a big deal”
------------------------------------------------
“Where’s my aspirin?” Tony asks and he wonders for the first time in forever where his phone is. He touches his empty pockets and wants to go find it but the nausea feeling and the headache aren’t gone. So he is fine standing there, leaning against the wall trying not to fall. He wants to lay down again but his vomit is awful and starting to smell. God he needs someone to clean that up.
Okay, so when he stumbles into the dark room, he realizes it was probably
He kissed Aaron.
At some point he falls to the side and falls asleep.
He knows that Tony is avoiding him. When Tony is pissed off or ignoring you or
“Sorry for leaving you alone at the party.” He speaks a bit more steady this time and if it weren’t for the lack of light in the room, he would be staring straight into Aaron’s eyes.
The sight of the super soldier's face was almost comical. Steve looked as if he needed to borrow some pills against constipation. "What exactly was she right about?" Tony asked with a small smile.
She was equivocal with Steve. "Tell him I'm awake and working. The rule holds. No one in." Tony gathered his tools and again found himself with his thoughts going back to the super soldier. He was sure, though, that the work would cure him of that. Not everything in his life was about Captain I-want-to-be-your-friend-but-Bucky-means-more-to-me, then why the hell couldn't he stop thinking about him?
Tony lay underneath him on the bed, grinning wildly into his face as he raised his eyebrows.
The sauce was expertly dripped into a love confession. Tony secretly couldn't wait for more. Clint was one funny guy. That sentiment was confirmed the moment they saw the dessert. Clint had really outdone himself and used whipped cream to word a suggestion on the apple pie:
I would love to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter.
"You have to stop doing this," Tony lifted a corner of his lips in a small smile.
"Nobody can make you string together three sentences on any topic, but when you talk about something you love, your eyes are sparkling. You have that smile on your face, and you can't shut up."
"Only the HYDRA sign, Boss," FRIDAY responded.
Anthony Stark stood in front of the door to Steve Rogers' room in Avenger Tower, fingers still painfully clutching Steve’s letter. Wrong choice of words. The letter was from Captain America, not Steve Rogers. He couldn't make the same mistake again and think that Captain America and Steve were two people. No. Captain America had almost killed him. He was the same man as Steve Rogers, his former friend, his teammate, his...  the Avenger.
"Some scrubs would be perfect, guys," Tony announced into the silent room. They were still in the hospital, but apparently nobody felt the need to use their brains anymore. After Tony’s implied request, the Avengers ultimately scattered and gave them some privacy. Bruce was the only person who remained.
"You wanted to see him at the end of the day. It will be the end of the day in few minutes," FRIDAY helpfully explained.
Tony stopped in the doorway of the common room when he noticed that the table in the middle of it was prepared for a romantic candle light dinner. He closed his eyes and calculated the time he would need for a quick shower and a change of clothes. Tony turned on his heel but promptly collided with Steve's chest. "I have to go. Give me twenty minutes."
"Tony---"
One second, Tony was looking at the older woman in front of him, listening (or at least pretending to listen) to her words, and the next, Natasha was yelling, "Stark!" Tony was grabbed around his shoulders, and his breath left him when he landed heavily on the floor on his back. Clint was still clutching his jacket with one hand, not allowing him to move. The archer was kneeling next to him, holding a dagger in position and searching the room with his eyes.
"Thanks for the newsflash, glad to hear your sensors are working splendidly."
"Tony!" Steve's worried yell made sense. The rest not so much.
"That is a horrible thing to say." Steve released him with a chuckle and proceeded to open the door. "Shall we?"
"Tony?"
Steve saw the way Tony stood his ground when the young man took two steps towards him and pointed the gun at Tony's forehead. Steve's heartbeat doubled its speed, and that was his undoing. "Tony," he softly whispered. "Let me talk." They needed to stall to make time for the police to arrive.
Rhodey was one big pain in the ass. Before his AI could answer, Tony was on his feet. "Mute," he silenced her with a gesture. "FRIDAY, open the door for our dear Colonel. He's leaving. We talked about privacy before. No need to disclose more information and anger your daddy again."
"Cold," Steve mumbled and leaned into Tony's body.
did to you."
"Yes." Steve nodded.
in JARVIS' voice so many times in the past, he couldn't stand to hear it again.
Tony put his palms flat on the workbench, ignoring the blueprints all over the desk, and with a heavy sigh closed his eyes, allowing his head to hang.
And Tony finally understood. It was a test. She wanted to see his reactions and figure out what had happened when Tony had spent his time in Wakanda. Pepper Potts was trying to play the matchmaker.
Tony laughed and shook his head. "Let's go. We have work to do." They had HYDRA agents to hunt, after all. Tony and Steve led the way, and Tony was acutely aware of the way the Avengers were having their backs, just as it should be. The same way Tony had gotten used to over the years. He knew he would have a hard time with this sometimes - he was still pissed at some of them, after all. But he also knew they would have his back when the situation called for it.
They had both made so many mistakes, but their fighting against each other in Siberia had been the worst.
No one would accuse Tony Stark of not following every little lead when he had something to figure out.
"Good news, the poison does not have long-term effects."
Tony visibly straightened his shoulders and turned back. "Ok, we're obviously
Tony stayed silent for a moment. "I don't get it. How can you love someone and still do all---" He clamped the hurt inside and sneered, "---these things. I just want to punch him in the face. That fucker has no idea how hard it is to get out of Siberia with a malfunctioning suit. I had to repair some of it right there. It was fucking cold, you know. Siberia is not Miami. Sometimes I still feel the cold in my own home. I want---"
"Rhodey, don't!" Tony warned him and took a quick step forward to catch his friend in his arms before he could fall to the floor. The wheelchair was prepared under the colonel, but he would still have taken the fall if Tony hadn't interfered.
"King T’Challa," she added with a frown on her beautiful forehead. Pepper shouldn’t worry about him that much.
"Can I see?"
Steve stood paralyzed by the sight of Tony's chest. To the tiniest detail, he remembered the terror in Tony's eyes when he had been lying beneath him on the concrete in Siberia.
"Yes. He loves you."
"Yes. With the others. And look at what you get in return."
"Because it's you and me. Think about it. I'm the genius here. I have to know what I'm talking about, right? And look at you. You're Captain America. Against all odds, you're still alive seventy years later, and people are still looking up to you."
It was only after the glass of the reactor had shattered that Steve could see the irreparable damage his action had caused. Tony was staring at him, eyes wide and an expression of naked fear and betrayal on his face. That look gutted Steve, and as he looked down at the engineer, the frustration and righteous fury that had powered Steve throughout the fight abruptly left him. There was no recognition in Tony’s eyes; he looked at Steve as if he were a stranger, as if he had never seen him before.
He opens his eyes but the bright white light makes him close them immediately. “I KNEW YOU WERE FUCKING THIS WHORE!” There’s a beep sound, a buzz on his ears and is he in a roller coaster? Oh god, his head hurts and everything is spinning and, he throws up.
“Sorry” he mutters when the shoe he accidentally kicked
Gorgeous, he always thought that his friend is gorgeous. And he is realizing
“No, we are okay.” It’s all he says and Bucky takes a sip of his coke with an “are you kidding me?” expression on his face. Steve shakes his head and rolls his eyes with a little smile.
. Tony shaked a little, like he was about to fall and Steve instinctively grabbed him by the waist. And in that moment Tony kissed him again. Softer this time, like he meant it. And Steve ended up throwing his arms around Tony’s back and kissing back shutting up all the alarms in his head. They were drunk, this was a party and Tony did this kind of thing all the time, he even kissed Bruce once, it was
And God, this is going to be bad. He turned around trying to fall asleep, but Tony’s cologne was all over him and it shouldn’t feel good. He also shouldn’t be thinking about how Aaron gets kisses like that all the time. Or how everybody gets kisses from Tony like that.
“Yes. But it's offensive that you already thought I did!” Bruce groans.
The whole lunch goes well, more than well actually, everybody laughs and talks and they steal most of Natasha’s fries until she gets angry, and by the time lunch is over and everybody leaves, Tony walks with Thor to the library. If he thinks of it, there were a few times when Steve meet his eye, or the other way around, and Tony felt weird enough like to look away, but other than that, it was fine. That’s when he decides that he needs to talk to Rogers about this someday, but today, is not the day. (or the week)
Bruce looks at him suspiciously. “Alright” He grabs his phone again and gives Tony a
attracted to him and I’m straight, but you need to think about this. You two are friends, you can’t screw up this friendship if you just want to… fuck him”
The smell of lemon hits his nose when he opens the door, and everything looks so organized that it surprises him they don’t use this bedroom for photographs in decoration catalogs. He haven’t walk into his parents room in a… long while. So it’s normal to feel like he doesn’t know this part of the house at all.
The girl slaps him.
for God’s sake.There were a thousand alarms sounding in his brain but when tried to push Tony off the part of his brain that was supposed to do
Some people greet him, congratulate him for the party or some others just flashes smiles to him as he walks, except for one girl who looks at him like he wants to murder him.
“And didn’t he?” Bucky asks and they all burst out laughing.
, you just wait until he goes back to normal. What is Steve going to say anyway? It’s not like Tony ever listens, and he doesn’t want to argue with him, and… certainly
There are voices going around in the room and Tony remembers being in bed with Aaron and having other people sleeping in the floor before opening his eyes.
They walk to the classroom and Tony looks over the grandstand and sees Steve in there, with his open book and a pencil ready on his hand. Steve sees him too, but Tony freezes and feels weird for a second so he just looks away trying to find a sit for him and Bruce without waving a hand or smiling or giving Steve time to do it himself. Steve frowns but keeps his attention focused on the teacher coming through the door.
“I kissed Rogers”
“Kind of. I remember leaving but I had in mind to text him and come back. But on the way here I was thinking too much and when I got here I remembered that I didn’t text. And that I don’t have my phone on me. So… He probably just thought I got lost or kidnapped on campus”
Tony stands up. “He was asking for tickets to the school play”
“Coffee, Romeo?” Tony asks smirking and Clint agrees.
Bruce notices how anxious Tony is getting so he puts the phone down on the table and turns his body towards his friend. Puts a hand on his shoulder. “Look, you are attracted to him, hell maybe
“That’s a stupid plan, Tony. Just talk it out, It’ll be fine” he is sighing every word.
He walks and steps in the soft surfaces, and tries to climb to his bed, and he almost falls twice.
“Wow someone’s been partying more than me!” Tony chirps when he turns around. Barton has nothing but his blue boxers and an open white shirt on, and the shirt has some buttons missing. His face looks like shit and his hair is going on every direction.
Natasha side smiles and closes her notebook.
Clint rolls his eyes. “Come on stark, you are exagerating! And she is a 4’5 inches girl”
Way too loud,
So, the mansion was going to be alone for one night and Tony decided to throw a party, the whole college was invited to, and for the looks of it when he comes down the stairs,
“Okay I deserved that.” Some people laugh as he groans and she walks away angrily pushing a couple out of her way.
“What?”
“I can do that perfectly fine”
“Can’t see why.”
gets drunk at parties and they kiss people. Girls are all the time kissing each other in truth or dare games or just so someone could snap a video. It’s… part of friendship, Tony guesses.
Knowing now it was Steve, that he was
----------------------------------------
“I guess I want a cup” he leans against the counter and takes his phone out of his pocket. That’s when Tony remembers that he didn’t found his.
“Didn’t you?”
But he stood the night on Steve’s room. And there’s only two beds unless there’s a third one hanging from the ceiling that Tony missed the couple of hundred times he went there. They had to stay in the same bed. Well that was normal, friends could share beds right? He shared a bed with Thor that one time they went camping and had to stop at a motel that didn’t have many rooms. It was okay! But… why would Bucky stay the night if his own room, his own
Jim sighs when Jarvis walks out, and he walks up to the side of the cot, reluctance written all over his face. "We got Zola, but ... Barnes didn't make it."
"Can you get me into Hydra's base?"
The real bitch about it was that, honestly, Tony kind of
Tony's hand was warm and slightly rough, not dry but callused, probably from years of his work as an inventor. Steve went a step further and laced their fingers together, even though he felt a small twinge of guilt for the intimacy of the move. It felt
Tony still looked doubtful, as pale as if he had been the one bleeding out on the ground. "I'm holding you to that," he said unevenly.
“And after that, you’ve got Hawkeye?”
Jarvis' footsteps were muffled by the heavy carpet, until he appeared in Tony's peripheral vision, settling down into the chair beside him. "Master Anthony."
Steve watched, bemused, as Natasha seemed to get herself and Clint up and moving and out the door within all of two minutes. Once they were gone, the house felt empty and the movie was over, leaving Steve at a bit of a loss.
“Hey, Shellhead! Up and at ’em!” Clint said loudly.
"Couple years," Steve answered. "I got out, went to school, ended up here. Not much more to it, really."
Steve sighed in relief, glancing around. "Glad to get a moment alone, I'll be honest."
to respond, but he's relieved when Jim lets him up and even helps him down the corridor to his quarters. At the door, Jim drags Tony into a brief hug before walking off.
me? I can’t promise I won’t get upset, but I
say that I’m his number one fan.”
Outside, Buccaneer Bay is indifferent to Steve's mood, thriving with its usual curious mix of high class travelers and lower class citizens. He pulls his coat collar higher and tries to blend in, but it's a futile effort when he stands head and shoulders above many of the people around him. It makes him a conspicuous and therefore unappealing target for thieves, at least, so the pickpockets roaming the area leave him alone as he picks his way through the crowd.
Steve looked unimpressed. "I'm not aggravating the bruises on your bruises with sex," he said.
Tony shrugged, another exaggerated movement in the confines of the suit. “I didn’t ask.”
Maybe the fact they both had secrets would make it work?
, what can I say, I wasn't a very inventive teenager, aside from the whole invent
And so the armor is, tall and hulking, imposing to anyone with anything to fear from it. Steve walks up to the armor, where it hangs suspended in its chains for maintenance, and reaches a hand up to the breastplate - but he stops, glancing back at Tony.
Steve hangs his coat on the rack by the door, and exhales a sigh. "I just came from my meeting with Namor."
"Morning, Cap," Tony greeted. He got a mug down from the cabinet and tried to play it casual as he went to stand across from Steve, putting the coffee maker between them.
“So ... are you going to arrest me now?”
"Yes," Steve said.
Anthony - and that has nothing to do with ego, because the two of them seem different enough in practice, even if they have been cut from similar cloth.
you, Stark," von Strucker says. "Not in so many words. I have a much more fitting end in mind for you."
Tony loved everything they did together, but there was something especially striking about the way Steve sucked cock. He always looked so debauched, with his hair a mess (usually from Tony's fingers in it) and his mouth red where it was stretched around Tony's dick.
, and he had no idea why it was a problem. “Before you get hurt.”
people, including many female (and a few male) SHIELD personnel, thought that Captain America was just an oblivious relic from the 1940's, but it wasn't like people hadn't been having sex seventy years ago. If anything, war was an even greater motivator; some men didn't want to die virgins and 'I might die tomorrow' proved to be a pretty good excuse to get a girl to go upstairs with you.
Steve ran his hands down Tony's arms and circled his fingers around Tony's wrists, gently drawing his frantic touches away. Tony looked up at him with that same uncertainty as earlier, so Steve leaned in to kiss away the small frown from Tony's lips.
Tony Carbonell was simply an enigma. He seemed to love his job, love his students, and to want for little in life. And in the months that he had spent getting to know Tony, Coulson was no closer to an answer to the riddle; if anything, he only had more questions.
"That's it," Tony murmurs in soft encouragement. "Pull a little, he likes that."
Tony leaned over, placing his hand on Steve's knee. "It's been twenty-five years. I think it's past due time I take care of this." He paused, turning back to Natasha. "Agent Romanoff, make the call."
Just as Steve exited the shop, another man was leaving the one next door; a glance at the sign identified it as a cupcakery, which Steve assumed - without making much of a leap - was a bakery that specialized in cupcakes. A little eccentric, in his opinion, but there was a shop in Manhattan that sold macarons so popular that people would wait hours in line just to get a box of the expensive treats, so maybe he wasn't much of a judge.
Tony's house, Steve realized upon reaching it, was rather large, a sprawling two stories with the back extending out in a long private dock toward the lake. It seemed like an awful lot of house for one person.
Tony's climax rolled over him in a slow sweep rather than the usual punch, and he made a soft, satisfied noise as pleasurable warmth infused his tired limbs. His hands dropped from Steve's hair as Tony went boneless against the bed, and he had to concentrate hard on keeping his eyes open just to watch as Steve swallowed and licked him clean.
“This way,” Iron Man said, and they were off again.
After copying the address onto a new sheet of paper, Steve tucks it into his shirt pocket. He finishes up his search of the remainder of the room and turns up nothing else but a phone book with no pages that seem particularly well-loved or dog-eared.
Tony shrugs. "I'm just being realistic, Cap."
It is well past noon, most days, by the time Tony manages to drag himself out of bed, and today is no different. These last few months, he simply hasn't been feeling like himself, and the worst part is, he can't decide if it's because he's losing his mind, or if the stress of years of war has finally caught up to him.
Tony sits down at his desk once the day's chores are done, and finds himself staring at the letter that arrived only this morning from Steve. It's cheerfully worded, announcing Steve's impending return home. Steve's words are filled with cautious optimism about the future, and eagerness to see Tony again.
Steve glanced up in silent approval and held Tony's gaze for a moment before he pulled down the waistband of his pants. He settled back on his haunches, letting Tony get a good look as Steve worked to bring himself off.
"I guess that's true," Tony agreed. He spent a moment sipping his coffee, while Natasha scrolled through the list of available titles in the action genre. A lot of them were things Tony had never heard of, which probably went straight to video, but Natasha impressed him by digging deep and finding something especially entertaining from the 90's and starting it up.
"God damnit," Tony sighs. He scrubs a hand over his face. "You
"I know what you mean," Tony says. "Anyway, I think I'm statistically less likely to get punched in the face by waking up my alternate rather than yours."
Steve followed Tony further into the workshop, which just seemed to keep going, into an area that was more a miniature theater than anything else, with a long couch and a couple of armchairs, a projection screen, and an extensive audio system.
Steve watches, feeling a mixture of irritated and relieved. "Where did you even get that?"
Tony pulled a face. "Sure beats threatening your kids with a lump of coal in their stocking, I guess."
Inside the castle, Cap and Iron Man braced for an attack, but the place was eerily deserted. They shared a sidelong glance - Iron Man’s as subtle as it could be through that helmet, anyway - and continued on. It did stand to figure, from a certain tactical perspective, that defense of this location was only so strategically important. Major troop movements to guard what was supposedly a single item would call unwanted attention to the place.
Steve cleared his throat, a bit self-consciously. "Sorry. I wasn't trying to make things macabre."
Anthony settles in, knees either side of Steve's hips, taking a moment to adjust before he gives a slow, experimental roll of his hips, and Tony has to pause again in distraction, just looking at the sight they present - just thinking about how he and Steve look like this every time they make love, and it's almost
Clint shrugged. “Don’t worry, your secret - such as it is - is safe with me, Steve. I’m not saying everyone else doesn’t know already, but if they do, it isn’t because they heard it from me. Just, you know, remember I’m not the only one here with
"Howard and Maria Stark died in a car accident in 1987, around this time of year," said Fury. "Their only son, Anthony, went under the radar a few weeks later. Shortly after that, Tony Carbonell showed up in Cedar Falls and took a position working as a teaching assistant."
"I still smell like I've had on my uniform for hours," Steve said firmly.
Tony tugs Steve over to the side of the bed, and begins to slowly unbutton Steve's jacket. "Did I mention how much I enjoy a man in uniform, Captain?"
Tony firmed his grip in Steve's hair and rolled his hips, giving in to the need.
"I try," Steve answered, as he shifted away to stretch out beside Tony.
"There's some in the kitchen," Tony said, saving Natasha the trouble. "And donuts."
"Were
(Well, Tony knew that last one: Steve didn’t. Because Steve was physically
Tony brooded over his options during the flight home, and promptly had every thought fly from his mind as soon as he saw the wreck of the penthouse at the hands of Thor and the Hulk. The destruction provided a good distraction, at least; Tony was able to slink off while the others weren't looking, and rather than heading down to his workshop this time, he just shed the armor and retreated into his bedroom.
"You know ... not much," Steve said, shrugging lightly. "I just moved into town a few days ago, so it's nice to get this opportunity to meet people."
When Steve broke away from the kiss, Tony was left gasping for breath, though he tried to act at least somewhat unaffected.
Steve sighed into his coffee mug. "I guess you're right."
Steve finds his mind wandering to thoughts of Tony putting himself at risk, being out in public with whatever business he's on. If Tony isn't back soon, Steve will need to go out looking for him.
Tony closes his eyes and rubs his hands over Steve's back, murmuring whatever quiet words he can in an effort to soothe his lover. "I'm so sorry, Steve. I'm so sorry."
, though, not just yet; he just slid his slicked up cock along Tony's cleft, teasing between his thighs, nudging against Tony's balls. Once the moans he was wringing out of Tony started turning to a whine, Steve finally did line himself up and began pressing inside. Tony was still loose from the morning and took him easily, pressing back onto Steve's cock until Steve was all the way inside.
"Wow," Steve says.
it to understand just how good it actually is.
It was difficult for Tony to come up with a compelling argument against it, especially when Steve began to rock his hips against Tony's, even if the friction was sadly reduced by the layers of fabric standing in their way; it
Tony winced, tallying the damage in his head, as a repulsor blast fired outside the office door, followed by the sound of equipment being destroyed. Another clang -- that shield, again -- then glass shattering as JARVIS undoubtedly flew the armor away.
Edwin Jarvis, the family's trusted butler - and Tony's caretaker, mentor, and confidante - roused Tony from his sleep at three in the morning to take the phone call: a drunk driver had crossed the road and collided head-on with the Starks' vehicle as they headed home from the party. Maria was killed on impact; Howard was taken to the hospital, but the prediction was dire.
"Romanoff, Rogers," Director Fury spoke up. "You two will be going undercover at the Cedar Falls middle school, with Coulson as your supervising agent. There are two open positions; you can fight amongst yourselves. Agent Coulson will give you the details."
“I’m not -” Steve began.
“Are you asking me to help you take down a supervillain?” Tony asked.
“I knew you wouldn’t approve,” Tony said again. “You
Tony was too spent to even consider getting hard again, but he still felt a warm flush of arousal just in response to the erotic display. Steve was gorgeous, and quite unrestrained for a guy who grew up in a time when such a thing was still considered pretty taboo. That, really, just made it even hotter.
Tony was a lively teacher, even after nearly twenty years on the job. He received consistently high marks on evaluations, all his coworkers loved him, and he rarely missed a day of school. A more model teacher, no one could have found. The students loved him, too; they referred to him informally as 'Mr. Tony,' and most of them performed well in science with him as a teacher.
know Iron Man’s identity, after enough time and all of Tony’s slip-ups.
Instead of
to collapse his weight onto Tony, rolling to the side before they both went boneless against the mattress, panting with exertion and excitement that made them both breathe hard.
"Seriously?" Tony asked. "You really want to shower?"
to recover, it was preferable to wallow, and for what reason would one not be able to casually nurse their hangover on Christmas morning?
Tony's hips jerked off the bed. "Oh, God."
Steve scowls. "Couldn't you just use a gun like everyone else?"
Steve smiles up at him. "I'm not most people."
He'd just gotten into level 21 when someone said, "This one's tricky. You playing good or evil?"
"It's really impractical," Steve complained.
There was something so damned earnest about him that Tony could not even guess it was an alias; somehow, he just believed it, right off.
Tony was there, grinning mildly. "Sorry."
"I guess I can see how this would be weird, then," Steve admitted.
What Steve called aspirin looked, on closer inspection, more like the best over the counter stuff you could get for a headache. He'd probably gotten them from Clint or Sam, since Captain America didn't really do headaches. Tony didn't ask, he just pushed himself up from the pillows and dutifully swallowed both pills, washing them down with half the glass of water, under Steve's supervision.
That left Iron Man and Captain America alone to man the fort; the fort being, of course, the lavish Avengers Mansion, where under the care of Edwin Jarvis they would want for nothing. The place was decked out in all its festive glory, with a massive Christmas tree and garland strung all about and mistletoe hung in tasteful places. Platters of sugar and shortbread cookies sat all about, along with enough gingerbread houses and people to constitute a cookie village.
Steve looked down, the blush deepening as he rubbed at the back of his neck. “You were just eight years old a few hours ago,” he pointed out.
Steve moves in close, an arm slipping around Tony's waist as he leans in for a brief kiss. "I'll be back in a little while," he says. Then he pauses, eyes drifting to the pod. "Should I get a room prepared for our guest?"
Steve sternly told himself that it was just a good idea to stay close to Tony; he wasn't being paranoid, or out of bounds. That car was suspicious, and Steve needed to make certain that nothing happened to Tony this evening. It would be so easy for something to go wrong in a room so full of people Steve didn't know; he was already forced to follow Tony's cues to guess which people he recognized as friends and acquaintances.
One of them crouches down among the broken glass and spends a moment examining the label on a few different broken vials.
It was more than Steve had, and that realization was enough to make Steve experience a pang of guilt - certainly not his first - about what he was doing.
Sternberg doesn't seem to catch the joke, or if he does, then he doesn't find it funny. "Very well. What can I do for you,
“I don’t know,” Tony said. He set the empty plate aside and wiped his mouth with a napkin before tossing that onto the tray as well. “Just kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop, I guess.”
"No." Steve shakes his head, giving Stark's shoulder a comforting squeeze before Steve takes his hands back to himself.
: is that a promotion, a demotion, or just a lateral change in branch?"
"I need to get to Steve," Tony says, knowing he's as transparent as a pane of glass right now and not caring. He moves to swing his legs off the cot, but Jim puts a firm hand on his shoulder.
is a world where we’re all good guys.” He sighed, releasing Tony’s hand in order to strip off his gloves and dig into a pocket on his belt. He withdrew a folded bundle of papers, yellowed with age, and turned to show a faded photo to Tony.
Steve smiles, in that soft and reassuring way he has, and places a hand on Anthony's shoulder. "It's just an offer. No pressure, no strings attached, if you're interested."
Steve watched as Tony walked back over to the desk and sat down on the edge again; this time, Steve followed, perching with a few inches of space between them.
"How much have you had to drink?" Steve asks softly.
"I'll use it to my advantage as long as I can, if you don't mind," Tony answered.
Steve raised his eyebrows. "What's that?"
“No,” Steve said. He lifted his arm so that Tony could settle in at his side, and brought it back down around Tony’s shoulders. “I mean, I
“It could have,” Tony agreed. “But it worked. God, Steve - can’t you budge for just a
? Good God, man."
Steve was apparently not that interested in
Steve shrugged, and turned back to his task, feeding quarters into the machine. “I don’t mind doing it myself. It’s … soothing.”
Thor ignored him. “Why do you waste our time?”
it. Donated a lot of my money to the school system ... anonymously, of course."
"Well," Tony says. "That's a good sign, at least."
“Tony,” Steve said, except his partner’s name came out more like an incoherent grunt. He took a breath and tried again, “
“Dad met him during the war,” Tony said. “So I just thought - maybe ... well, it doesn’t matter.”
- a submarine designed and built in many incarnations by Tony Stark - takes up most of the space below; the fishing boat has likely never seen a day of service hauling a load of seafood.
Tony laughed again. "That's what I like to hear, I'll be honest."
"The last person reported to have seen Stark was the family butler, Edwin Jarvis," Coulson answered. "Unfortunately, Mr. Jarvis passed away a few years ago. The memorial service was private, so we never were able to confirm whether Stark attended."
Clint sipped his coffee in silence for a moment, before turning back to the stove. "So, don't worry. Coulson's been out here for months and hasn't made as much progress as you have in a few days. I've known him and worked with him for a long time. If he didn't think you could do it, he wouldn't have recommended you."
"The what?"
“You think Ascalon exists?” Steve asked.
"Steve?" he said, expression morphing into one of question and disbelief. "What -?"
A few days before Christmas, twenty-five years ago, Howard and Maria Stark left their Fifth Avenue mansion in Manhattan for the annual Van Dyne Christmas gala. Tony's flight home from Malibu was delayed, and he arrived home a couple of hours later, deciding to skip what was left of the party and go straight to bed.
Tony returned the smile, and that made everything seem brighter, the way it lit up his entire face. “Now come on, I’ll wash your back.”
With the matter of her identity relatively unaddressed, Iron Man sat forward, gently tugging Steve’s hand down from his head to have a look of her own at his scalp.
In 1940, Iron Man and Captain America were sent on their first assignment together. The mission was a great success, and they founded a working relationship based on mutual trust and admiration.
But Tony goes still, tipping his chin as he looks down at Steve. "Do you mean you haven't ..."
"What?" Steve asks, all false innocence. "I didn't say anything."
"He's dead," one of the voices announces.
"Carbonell - Stark - is a crucial enough player in this game that SHIELD will expect you to do whatever you can to earn his trust," Natasha said.
Steve has not gotten any further than simply removing his helmet, which he still holds in his hands, head bowed as he looks down at it, thumbs tracing over the wings on the sides.
"Alright." Natasha shrugged, gesturing to her car, which was still running. "I'll take Tony's car back to his house and see if anyone suspicious turns up."
"The assignment. Madripoor."
Tony sighed, flopping back on the bed, his eyes turning to the ceiling. He recalled earlier, being reverted back to an eight-year-old, with all the emotions dwelling close to the surface thanks to youth, but his mind loaded with all the clarity of his years of experience since actually
When Steve woke again, he was tucked into bed in a private hospital room, and the pain in his side felt like a minor twinge of inconvenience. Natasha was sitting by the bed, typing away on her phone; she looked up when Steve moved, and leaned over to look at him.
The atmosphere of the house noticeably shifted once the bass was thumping, and within what felt like the blink of an eye, nearly everyone seemed to be holding a beer. Steve spotted someone he remembered being introduced to him as a retired chemistry teacher, spiking what was left of the eggnog. It turned out that one side of the living room housed an impressive wet bar, which was open for business now that the young ones were gone, with one of the administrators playing amateur bartender.
"Dummy?"
“But,” Steve said, “even if the legend is true, even if there were a historical St. George and something like the dragon, the rest of it must be a myth.”
“Meet the MacGuffin Ray,” Tony said, bringing up three-dimensional holographic schematics of what looked, actually, like a very impressive rifle.
"Then what is it?" Tony wondered.
The baron laughs, short and sharp this time.
Steve rocked forward in his seat, while behind him the others scattered and stumbled. Through the windscreen, he could see Nighthawk’s jet fly over and past them.
Tony smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "Nah. See, thing was ... I didn't just like teaching. I
Tony threw the gauntlet in one of the sinks, of all things, and dragged Steve in for a kiss. Steve tipped his head down to return it, his hands sliding down to Tony's waist to drag up the hem of the flimsy t-shirt Tony was wearing. (Tony had recently taken to not wearing his skintight black suit of underarmor any longer; Steve sometimes missed it, though he didn't miss how difficult it was to get
"How long since you got out of the Army?" Tony asked, as he stepped over to a small, utilitarian kitchen area that sat next to the theater space. He grabbed two bottles of beer from the refrigerator, and uncapped them before handing one to Steve.
Tony opened his eyes and squinted across the room in confusion. His closet doors were hanging open, one broken off the top hinges, the other swinging with a doorknob snapped off. The shelf that had been running along the top of the closet was torn down on one end, and shoeboxes and other things Tony had forgotten were in there were scattered and leaking onto the floor.
, Steve didn’t understand, Tony needed to do this.
Steve watched Natasha go, and turned to look at the window. The blinds blocked out most of the glass, but he could see the faint hint of dayglow suggested around the edges of the slats. Only a few hours had passed, then; how strange it was to think that this time yesterday, Steve had been asleep in a bedroom that wasn't really his own, playing house with his odd little SHIELD family. This time yesterday, Tony had been blissfully unaware of anything amiss in his normal life as Tony Carbonell, and apparently content to continue on with the charade indefinitely.
It was a solid couple of minutes before Steve could convince himself to move, and then it was more out of consideration for Tony's comfort than his own. He lowered Tony back down to the bed and slipped out of him, offering an apologetic kiss when Tony grunted a protest at all the movement.
, a word she often repeats to him in a mock stern tone. "Fine, but I still need to get some ideas from you for the next few issues of
Anthony looks down at Steve, catching sight of the desire in Steve's expression, then he looks back to Tony and nods. "As much as I enjoyed being in the middle last night ..."
Tony nodded.
Steve's heart sinks into the pit of his stomach, and he rushes to his pile of discarded clothes, to begin pulling them back on, bloodstains be damned. "What do they want with Tony?"
Tony leans in and kisses Steve again, briefly this time, then offers a kiss to Anthony before shifting away to find the bottle of lube that has been nearly lost in the rumpled covers.
"Circumstances."
Natasha raised an eyebrow. "Really? I wouldn't have guessed."
Tony leans back into the embrace; he looks like he resents himself for the weakness.
Sternberg adjusts his glasses and gives Steve a once over. Of course, someone in the scientific community, working closely with Tony Stark, would recognize Steve Rogers as the true identity of the former Captain America.
"I wouldn't have minded being Grim Reaper," Steve said, picking at the front of Crossbones', well, bone-adorned shirt. "This isn't exactly subtle."
"Aside from the guy over there who's going to wake up soon," Tony points out, glancing over his shoulder to the slab where his alternate is still out cold.
crew.
Steve acknowledged the words with a slow nod. "What will you do now?"
"Most people find that strange," Tony says, as he has many times before.
“So what are we dealing with?”

," he says. "But that's not it. I like you, Steve likes you. Why not have some fun?"
"What is it?" Steve asks desperately, trying to slow Sternberg's fall as the man slides to the floor.
Steve checks Sternberg's pulse to make certain he is gone, then he looks down at the vial in his hand. It has no markings, other than a single cryptic symbol. When Steve gets to his feet and checks the counter, none of the emptied vials appear to have the same symbol on them, though a few are labeled with 'STARK, A.' and varying dates.
“Looking good, Tony!” Steve called. “Keep your forearm braced, not too much tension in the elbow.”
Clint turned, eyebrows raised. "Yeah. What's up?"
"Fine," Tony relents. "I'll take pity on you." He slips his fingers free, and spends a moment rolling on a condom and slicking himself. Tony pats Steve's thigh. "Turn over, darling."
"You lied to me," Steve says, as the realization comes crashing down.
"Morning," Tony says, very softly.
Tony is feeling boneless even with an orgasm he gave himself a hand in achieving, and he slouches against Steve. "Maybe later," he says. "I got carried away. See, Captain? You're rubbing off on me."
Steve jolts upright and stares, heart leaping into his throat, and he can't help himself - he starts to laugh.
They were silent for a moment, before Tony asked, "Anything else I can help you out of?"
Steve exhaled a startled breath. “Tony ...”
By the time they reach the Lowtown district Steve seeks, the streets are crowded with everything from food carts to drunken revelers, and the car's progress has slowed to a crawl.
Steve looked at Tony for a long moment, then shook his head. “No, it’s okay. You’re here now. Did you really get cold without me?”
Steve skipped the glasses - the lenses were non-corrective, and vision was one of the few areas where he
Tony shakes his head. “I don’t know. More Hydra tech, that much is clear, but I haven’t a damn clue what it does. Yet.”
A joke? He didn't look like he was joking. He looked victorious; practically gleeful. But if he was serious… Sitwell was Hydra. And if such a high-ranking member of SHIELD could be Hydra, who knew how many more the could be?
“Thanks for this, Mr. Stark, I—”
“I'm not really—” Steve almost growled as he was cut off
So who to tell?  Not anyone at SHIELD or Fury, obviously. Natasha and Barton were too close to SHIELD, and Thor was gone (who knew how long he'd be gone?). Banner was too much of a liability with his anger issues. That left only one option. Steve sighed. Stark it was. He was rich enough to have influence, but clearly didn't get along with SHIELD, and Steve could easily take him down in worst-case scenario if Stark was out of the suit.
His blood ran cold.
“Stark!” Steve shouted, banging on the door of the ritzy hotel Stark was staying in until the tower got cleaned up. “Stark! I know you're here. I need to talk to you!”
Sure, Nick Fury shouldn't have meddled with the tesseract, but that didn't make them Hydra. Any government agency worth their salt would investigate and try to reproduce something so obviously powerful. It still was right-- he'd seen what Hydra could do with those guns and he didn't fancy seeing them again, even if they were on his side. And… this still could all be some kind of joke. Maybe the twenty-first century had some messed up kind of slang or prank and that was completely normal.
