The broad smile had let to leave her face. "The King prefers to be taken by his Chancellor. Normally, the man cannot conceive. Give this to him, and he will."
"Yeah? What is the word you'd use then?"
His arms still around Steve's shoulders, he began to play with the hair at the back of his head and said, "What's the matter, Steve? What are you thinking about?"
He closed his eyes and moved his hand so it was resting atop Steve's. He
"Good
"I'm sorry, Tony," Bruce said, quiet and earnest. "I know what you think you…
"Shove over," he muttered, setting his coffee down before he pushed in between Wilson and Natasha. "Might as well get some of this before you people devour it all."
"Tony, it's not that," Steve started to say, completely sincere.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, trying to drown out the sudden vision of a macaroni and cheese and hot dog dinner and a cheerful and chipper little voice begging to show him what her 'Anna Tasha' had taught her to do. He inhaled a deep breath through his nose and let it out as he opened his eyes and said, "I don't know what you're talking about."
After, still in pajamas, he padded into the kitchen where Steve was already smearing cream cheese on a bagel, and he reached out and grabbed half of it and kissed his jaw before he took a large and savory bite.
Tony's eyes were on his screen, but Steve's eyes were on Tony, and his cock was standing at full attention and would no doubt embarrass him were anyone to walk in and see the sight he made at that very moment, and he swallowed and shifted his gaze to the table and said a somewhat shaky, "How, uh, how much longer do you think it's gonna be?"

"Her. Olivia," he said and nodded toward the baby. "What happened to me. What happened to you. It all fits. It all makes sense. It all— It all matches up. It happened…or is going to happen. Whatever. It was real. It
"Hmm… Yeah, as nice as an offer as that is—"
"Don't count on it," he grumbled and then watched as Tony grabbed something from the counter and came over to the table. "What are you doing?"
Ella frowned and looked between them. "She's not?" she asked Bruce before she turned to Tony. "You're not?"
"Mmm...yes, but you are also a husband and a father — and a good one at that. You bear those responsibilities as well."
"Yeah?" he said above the cries, tears stinging his own eyes as the events of the last two days finally began to catch up with him. "Well, we don't have forty-eight hours. We also don't have an open grocery store or pharmacy for hundreds of miles. I mean,
"It really was so nice to finally meet you," Tracy said.

experience, really. In fact, overall, morning sickness and weight gain and Barton perving on his breasts aside, it had been a rather enjoyable experience.
(There was...a lot of pornography, as it turned out. And he hadn't even been looking for it! Honest!)
" he started to say when Tony glanced down to his chest and said an even more nervous, "
He huffed out a breath and whined a little as he saw what looked to be nothing good except for condiments and, ugh,
for his cock.
Steve sighed again and, knowing that was the end of that for now, zipped up, hissing at the friction of tight material against his aching cock. “Tony, please don’t call our daughter that.”
He sighed again. "Thank you, JARVIS," he murmured then turned to Olivia, who was looking up at the ceiling in confusion. "Sorry, kiddo," he said. "No-can-do on playing with Dummy at the moment."
"I mean it. If I have to—"
"Yeah, really looks like you don't care at all. I totally believe that."
"Steve's a little…bummed that he doesn't really
Steve stared at her a moment, his eyes skirting over her face looking for some sign that she was being anything less than truthful to him, her own emerald irises dancing in amusement as she watched him.
"Wait!" he cried and put his hands out to her.
Tony exhaled a breath through his nose. "Dead in a ditch, for all I care," he muttered and turned on his heel to go upstairs.
Barnes looked around at the assembled crew, and he shook his head a little then motioned to the ketchup bottle on the other side of Wilson and said, "Hey, could I have the ketchup?"
"You're the one that fucked me and got me pregnant."
Steve laughed. "I really don't know of any way to speed things along—"
If looks could have killed, Esmeralda would have been dead ten times over. Still, Steve turned his attention away from her and toward Tony, and he crouched down beside him and said, "Are you all right?" as he reached out and brushed his fingers against Tony's face.
Steve opened his mouth to protest, but Thor frowned at Barton and said, "I did not know my otherworldness offended you so."
"Wait, help Steve or help me?"
"Do you want to see?" Bruce then asked, and Tony realized DUM-E had helpfully retrieved a mirror from somewhere.
"It's not a big deal," Natasha said and rubbed his leg a little bit. "I won't think any less of you."

Some strange and confusing emotion welled up inside of him the moment those words translated in his brain. The best. His daughter didn't just love him, and she didn't just
"Merry Christmas to you, too, snickerdoodle," Tony said, his back to him as he continued to sort the presents into piles. "Help yourself to some coffee and cookies."

Unfortunately, it was mostly under the hashtag 'JabbatheSlut.'

"Friday," she replied. "She lives in the ceiling and watches over us."
"Yeah huh," he said and followed the curve of the road until it straightened out for the ride beneath the river, scant few taillights ahead of him and a smattering of headlights coming toward him in the dim amber light of the tunnel. "Gave him a choice, J. He chose to stay on the side of the road with

Even if 'someone' ended up being himself.
"Good," Rhodey said with a nod. "Hey, man, congrats, though. I didn't get to say it before, but I mean it. I loved Pepper, I still love Pepper, and Pepper was good for you at the time, but Cap's the best thing that's ever happened to you, and I mean that."
Tony shrugged as Steve set the box on the desk, and Tony didn't even wait for him to get himself settled before he pulled it open and eyed over the contents.
Tony reached up and began to play with the soft hair at nape of Steve's neck. "You want to know a secret?" he asked, but Steve still wouldn't look up from his arm. "You know a huge reason I haven't gone off the deep end over this? You." He leaned down and brushed his lips against the side of Steve's forehead and down to his temple. "I mean it," he said and pulled back, still stroking his fingers against Steve's neck. "My mind is constantly waffling over this whole thing. Sometimes I'm freaked out about it because, you know, this doesn't
Silence.
He rolled his eyes. "Yeah, OK, Steve."
Because if he didn't know better, he'd say the guy was grappling with some undiagnosed depression or PTSD or something.

Was he dying? Was he about to die?
"Are you just going to find a way to shoot down all of these suggestions?"
Steve stopped swaying but didn't lessen his hold on Tony. "Yeah?"
"Seems to have been buried. A few remainders obviously that I don't think will ever completely go away."
"OK, I'm gonna level with you," he said, matching Steve's library-level murmur, "main reason I married you was so you'd do stuff like this."
Romanoff set an icy glare upon him. "Is it not Steve's?" she asked, folding her arms.
"You liked this
Wilson started to say something, but Tony cut in, "Yeah, we need to have a talk about that." He could feel the air in the jet change, tension suddenly seeping in where there had been none.
"Whatever," he muttered then said, "So this means she probably has traces of the serum in her, too, huh?"
"Look," he said, "it's not the worst thing that's ever happened to me. Against my will? Yeah. But considering the other things that have been done to me over the years against my will,
"I'm sure it does," Steve agreed then reached up into a cabinet and began to dig through for the paper plates.
Tony nodded then said, "All right, now finish that with, 'Tony, you're my own personal god.'"
"I'm sorry," Steve said for lack of anything better to say.
And people said Tony could talk his way into and out of things. Clearly these people had never really stopped to think about the shit Steve Rogers could and had gotten away with just by virtue of exploiting some technicality.
"Have they said much about us today?" he asked as he put the sound down low and just read the chyron at the bottom of the screen.
As Steve closed the door and went back around to the driver's seat, Tony glanced in the back to see Bruce already buckling up, and before he could say anything, Bruce said, "I think you'll like it, anyway. She wasn't active very long, but she's got some great shots from Monterrey Pop and other stuff. Spent some time in London, too, so she's got some great candid shots of the Beatles and the Stones and all of them. I don't know if the sister's going to be there — she's the one that owns all the stuff. I told Ella that Steve was coming with me to the show. Don't know if she passed the news along."
"This one's too big for me," she explained.
Barnes just nodded, caught out and ashamed and refusing to meet Tony's glance. "Does Steve know about this…
Steve just raised an eyebrow.
"You smell fine."
He opened his eyes at that and swallowed, and he blinked a few times and focused on the sleeping man next to him — the man that was still alive, still breathing, and would grouse and grumble at him if he were to wake him up at that very moment. He lay there and, with the dim amount of light available, watched his love sleep, committing the sight to memory so that he might be able to recall it many years from now when Tony was long gone and he was still as young and fit as he was at that very moment.
"Thank you."

"Something that was too bluntly earnest for the bastard's own good," Barnes muttered.
that!" Steve said and glanced over to him. "She's my daughter, too, you know. Maybe I didn't…
Tony went to say that was a stupid tradition (and hello, freezer burn!) but Steve just sighed and said, "Fine," and poised the knife to cut into the bottom layer. He shot a pointed look at Natasha and said, "Is this OK?"

. Saying 'I'd let Captain America knock me up in a heartbeat' is evidently not something to be ashamed of and is clearly something to shout proudly out of a bathroom stall."
"I wouldn't put it past her," he grumbled, and Steve chuckled again.
Steve was quiet a moment before he said, "Kinda miss that."
"Tony, what do you think happens when the Avengers come to these events?" Pepper asked, exasperation sliding into her voice at that, though Tony couldn't understand how it could be directed at him seeing as this was the first time they'd even spoken tonight. Which totally sucked. He really had to make an effort to talk to Pepper more often.
"Joke answer? Because he's Captain America. Real answer? Because this sort of shit keeps happening to us, and it's becoming less of an 'Oh my god! What's going on?' and more of a 'Jesus Christ, what's going on
— they saw standing before them was actually the man that had spent the better part of several decades charming his way into their headlines and bylines. Because without Iron Man, Nick Fury would never have drafted him to fill out the ranks of the Avengers' roster, and without that, there probably would have been no means for him to end up with Steve.
"I don't—"
"Twenty minutes tops, babe. And then the world will know the truth, not just a bunch of people at an art gallery."
"I'm sorry. What is it that you don't understand about
"Steve, babe, look at me," he said and shook Steve gently by the shoulders. He waited for Steve to meet the gaze of the eye-slits again and said, "I am
"I love you, Steve. I fucking love you to pieces. That's… That's what popped into my head. Just the fact that I'm so lucky and so fortunate to have you, and all I could think of was how much I loved you and how lucky I was to have you here with me and I…"
"Language."
Well, at least if they went, they could all go together.
"Are we placing money on that?" Barnes said before he turned to Steve and said, "And back to what your little princess said—"
, Steve's hands felt wonderful.
But Natasha squeezed his shoulder. "Looks like Clint gets to collect on that bet after all."
Tony huffed. "Why does everyone say that? Why does everyone think

anything to me, is it?"

Steve inhaled a deep breath through his nose and nodded. "I know," he muttered in tired resignation.
Tony shook his head. "Nope, I'm good!" he said, and Steve shot him a
"You do not have to join me in Asgard if you do not wish. I merely offer it as a suggestion, for I know how much you value the trust and friendship the Avengers have found in one another. I consider you my brother-in-arms and hope that you feel the same."
"It's the truth, isn't it? You'd rather chase after your pal, but you're stuck here with me."
He exhaled a heavy breath. "
He nodded. "Sure."
Tony frowned. "Yeah huh," he said and, using the pointier side of the tenderizer, slammed the tool against the board, scattering coffee beans all over the counter. "
"Cap is in no place to talk right about now."
"You son-of-a-bitch," he muttered and tried to blink the tears away, but a couple spilled down his cheeks. "See? What'd I tell you about the crying?"
He sniffled and blinked another stream of tears down his face, only realizing then he'd spent the past several minutes rubbing his bruised hand against his belly. He stilled the motion, letting his hand rest against the swell, and got a little bump against the inside of his abdominal wall for it. He choked out a cry and signaled to move over to the shoulder before he lost control of himself, and after getting the car securely stopped, he threw it into park and hugged his arms around his belly, resting his forehead against the top of the steering wheel as he sobbed out everything. All the hurt, all the pain, all the anger, all the humiliation, all the fear, all the contempt, all the worry, all the doubt, all the suspicion...
"You're disturbingly superstitious about certain things?" Barton said, and for some reason, Steve seemed to take offense to that.
"And it's in Steve's nature to make things 'right' — or what he thinks is 'right,'" Barnes added. "You hate this—" He made a slightly airy motion with his flesh hand. "Steve's gotta find a way to make it better for you."
"Other women. See how what I know of what you're going through compares." He shrugged. "That's all."
"Why?"
Steve dug protective fingers into Tony's shoulders. "He would have died."
He hummed and shrugged and put his hand up to where the one end of the towel was tucked in to keep it from falling down, holding it there so it didn't come undone. He watched as Pepper unzipped the garment bag and then pulled out the tasteful ensemble she'd chosen for the conference, shaking it out and holding it up and saying, "Will this do, Mr. Stark?"
" he yelled at it then yanked the fridge door open. "What concerns, J? What are we talking about? What's going on that I don't know?"

Tony stopped mid-thought. "Sorry?"
Tony just blinked at her logic — or lack thereof. "Um, isn't that your name?"
"There is such a theory," Thor said as he dumped most of the eggs onto his plate. Steve frowned. Evidently, he'd been counting on sharing the eggs.
— and he turned back to Natasha and said, "I don't know. Maybe I could just wear one of my suits or something. Or maybe the Iron Man armor. That'd be kind of cool, right?"
"So, I guess you owe Clint money now, huh?"
"To my
"They just need the room. And the power."
"Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, I'm fucking starving. I haven't eaten in—" He reached out and grabbed his phone to check the time. "Twelve hours, forty-six minutes, and, oh, fourteen seconds."
Without thinking, and because he hadn't actually been out in public in close to two months, he made his way over to the men's room and was just about to put his hand on the door to push through when someone beside him said, "Where do you think you're going?"
Not wanting to risk another breach of the Tower's security, Tony faced the facts: they'd have to release a photo. Steve could not have looked any less enthused about this fact if he tried, but Tony just tried to reason with him by saying, "Honey, it's either this or they search us out and do everything they can to sneak in and get their million-dollar photograph."
makeup, sugar plum. It's fun to play with, it makes me look good, and it makes me feel good about myself. And seriously—" he added as he grabbed his clutch to shove the lipstick and the mirror back into it, "—man bags need to be a thing, all right? Like, seriously, you don't have to just shove everything into your pockets,
DUM-E, the little shit, beeped in what sounded like sad agreement at that. He still wasn't sure how he felt about Bruce using DUM-E for what amounted to his nurse for this ordeal. He could have done without DUM-E getting a front-row-view to the show, and there was the ever-present possibility that he could fuck things up yet. He meant well, sure, but he wasn't exactly Tony's brightest creation, no matter what his biggest fan (Steve, it was totally Steve) said.
She just nodded her understanding then turned to leave, and Barnes shook his head a little but followed after her.
Because, of course, this wasn't just your standard class. No, he thought as he sat there on the floor, wondering how in the hell he was going to get back up again without embarrassing himself, this was bordering on New Age crap of a 'soothing' and 'comforting' environment with pillows and soft colors. Bruce had to have recommended this place to Diane or Donna or whatever the hell her name was because it was awash in hippy-drippy crap like soft lighting and flouncy cushions and emotions. The nurse — Tony supposed she was a nurse only because she said she was — wanted to run a welcoming and open atmosphere and after chirping that they were all first-time parents there, she suggested a stupid meet and greet so that all the happy couples could get to know each other better.
He stopped short, and Steve snorted out an obnoxious laugh and hugged tight arms around him, pressing his face into Tony's shoulder.
"It wasn't just that," Tony said, and, fuck, did he feel a sob working its way up through his chest? He swallowed like he was trying to swallow the embarrassment down and added, "It was… I liked nursing her, all right? I enjoyed it. I enjoyed how I looked. I enjoyed how I felt. I enjoyed what I could do — you know how clumsy these fingers are in comparison?" He unfolded his arms and held up his hands as though to show Steve his practically useless meat-hooks. "And I just— I feel old, all right? I feel— I didn't realize how old and broken down I actually was until I came back to
"OK," she said and closed her eyes, and the Cap shot one more look in Tony's direction — a warm smile that almost said Tony had no idea what was in store for him—
"No!" he said quickly and forced himself to stand up. "Nope. I'm fine. See? No need to call Daddy."
, Steve. You don't think she's a goddess," he said before Steve could even get the first word out.
ain't love…" Barton mused and threw back the rest of his drink. Natasha patted his arm.
"Let's go down to my floor for a little while."
That wasn't
Steve, still sitting back in his chair, reached out a hand and pressed his index finger to Tony's lips, holding his jaw with his thumb and the rest of his fingers. Once Tony had gone sufficiently quiet for a second, he schooled his face into its sternest and most serious pose and said, "You look fine."
Some of the eggs were just starting to get a little brown, so he pulled the pan off the heat and set it to the side and grabbed a plate out of the cabinet. He set the plate down and scooped the eggs onto it then grabbed the just-cooked bread out of the toaster and spread a little butter on it. OK, not too bad. Eggs weren't too overcooked, right? Wait, were they cooked? Fuck. Yeah, but the toast wasn't burned right? OK, too burned.
" and quickly switched over to the next preset.
He started to lead Barnes back toward the cabin, arm around his best pal's shoulders, talking to him like the last seventy years had never happened.
Steve shrugged and got to his feet, and he followed Tony into the bathroom and didn't put up one ounce of fight as Tony directed him at what to do and how and where to hold the dress before he was able to relieve himself, sighing in relief as he did so.
"Look, how 'bout Iron Man puts in an appearance with the board—"
"What I'm getting here is that you two let her get away with pretty much everything," Rhodey said.
"Yeah?" Tony said as the elevator doors opened — and come to think of it, shouldn't the car have already been there? Unless JARVIS was doing it on purpose again. He shrugged off his concern and stepped onto the car, Natasha right behind him. "Well, clearly your eyesight is the only decent sense you possess. Your hearing sucks if that's what you heard."
"Whatever," Tony muttered. "Any stragglers?"
and he doesn't think you belong with your
He folded his arms and pouted. "My penthouse."
history — hell, the whole world knows, or thinks they know, at least — but…you ever make it with any of those chorus girls?" He put a hand up in defense before Steve could even open his mouth. "And if you don't feel like saying anything, that's fine. That's your history, and I know you're not exact a kiss-and-tell type, but I'm just curious because I know when we started this whole thing up you were pretty damned inexperienced, and I'm just wondering what the extent of that inexperience was."
"Hmm?" he asked and pulled up a chair to sit in front of Steve and Olivia. "Her nails are getting a little long. I need to clip them before she hurts anyone with them."
Of course he would think it was something with the baby. Of course he wouldn't think it had anything to do with Tony's jealousies or the fact that Steve had gladly invited a deadly assassin into their midst — had spent the entire afternoon with said deadly assassin and hadn't even thought to check on him in the interim. Why would he ever give consideration to Tony when
His lines were sharper now, the last traces of baby fat all but gone, and he seemed fitter now, like he actually worked out or took care of himself or ate more than just greasy junk food. Tony had always had nice and expensive clothing, but the dark suit and the navy dress shirt he wore underneath it looked like they were tailored precisely to his lithe-yet-sturdy frame. His hair was much more neatly combed — or better yet, actually styled — than it had been in years past. The van dyke was even more enticing in person than it had been in the photographs.
"Sometimes," she said with a shrug. "I dunno. You and Daddy don't like t' let us get too far 'way from you 'cuz you're 'fraid someone's gonna hurt us. And Daddy's 'fraid someone's gonna hurt you. He says he doesn't wanna be without us 'cuz one time, he fell asleep for a
Sam tilted his head in thought. "Two weeks?"
"That's unsanitary," Tony muttered as he watched Bruce tape the cotton over the hole in his arm.
"No. Steve, I screwed up. I mean, I think I screwed up."
friends. That weird group that had co-mingled and intertwined in those months after the frat party. Tony hadn't wanted to spend Christmas at the mansion on Fifth Avenue, the wounds were too raw and too painful to even begin to nurse, but Steve had talked him into staying and promised that he would make it as good as he could for him or die trying.
He shrugged again. "You're not the only thing we talk about. Just comes up sometimes because, well, not everyday you see a fella turned into a woman."
"Yeah, but we all had to listen to you before because you're the oldest. I mean, not counting Thor, but he doesn't count 'cause he's an alien. You're not the oldest any longer, so we don't have to listen to you."
Steve just hit the button on the steering wheel to change the station, which landed on what sounded like '50s doo-wop. That lasted all of a second-and-a-half before the station changed again to something else, and Tony had to look at the display to see what it even was. Something '40s, evidently. Jukebox Saturday Night.
"Convenient," Steve muttered with a raised eyebrow and Tony scoffed.
"Yeah, well, clearly I didn't foresee something like this happening," he said and motioned over himself.
them — well, unless you're Howard."
So, after all this time, Rhodey remembered, too? At least Rhodey hadn't been a dick and needled him about it, though. Rhodey, at the least, remembered that it was something they were never to talk about.
It was after the movie had ended and they were debating whether or not to watch the empire strike back when there was an odd disturbance in the force. Tony felt a buzzing of sorts in the air, and the glassware behind the bar began to rattle. It almost sounded like a freight train was barreling through, some low rumble coming from seemingly nowhere. He exchanged a glance with the others, and it was when he finally turned to Thor that he saw Thor stand, Mjolnir at the ready.
He simply typed back,
"You're not really taking this man-child's advice, are you?"
about things, but I'm never not— Look, I'm gonna stick by you, OK? For better or worse. I just hate…"
The others showed back up for dinner, which consisted of everyone's favorites from their usual Chinese restaurant, and they sat around in their pajamas and stuffed their faces and watched Christmas movies before, closing in around ten that night, they yawned and made their excuses and filed out, wishing Steve and Tony a 'Merry Christmas' as they left.
"I think he'd give you a better answer to that than I could. But thank you. For everything. JARVIS said you two were bonding a little?"
His bottom lip wobbled some as he tried to keep his composure — he really had no desire to cry in front of Bruce or Hill — and he bit it to keep his emotions at bay. Fucking. Hormones. And fuck Steve. Forget what he said. This was totally his fault.
"Yeah, she claims she's tied up my life with this clump of cells in my abdomen, and while I'm sort of 50-50 on whether or not she's full of shit, Thor's convinced she's telling the truth based on the whole past-is-precedent deal, and my wonderful, darling fiancé, the father of my child, light of my life, has no desire to chance finding out because, if I'm reading Natasha's recent cryptic words correctly, I'm like the main thing in the future that's keeping him from chucking it all in and throwing himself in front of a semi — which would probably only dent the truck and barely leave a scratch on him. Seriously, he fell out of a flaming Helicarrier into the Potomac and lived. I'm not sure anything's ever going to kill that man."
Tony pursed his lips and raised an eyebrow. "Nice to know you think so well of us."
"Not a bit," Tony said and finished setting things up. He got up from his chair and grabbed a sterile cotton swab. "Just a little swab in her mouth, and we should get what we need."
"What's all that?"
Bruce just gave her a hesitant smile and said, "Well, Papa was probably… Papa probably has his reasons."
And Cap was
my parents."
. With these two it's more like,
"Yeah, but—"
"We'll always wonder if we don't."
"Well, according to the space-case, we've
Tony made a face at this. "You know, English really needs some gender-neutral pronouns. I mean, we have 'they' and 'them,' but technically those are plural."
"Steve's wearing a gimp suit, and it looks like they're sacrificing a lamb," Natasha said drolly, and while Pepper just rolled her eyes, Rhodey called out from the hallway, "That's not funny."
He glanced over at Tony, who was still snoring, his mouth hung open, and he tried to figure how much longer Tony would probably be there and if he could just leave the baby in her crib for Tony to find. But then Tony would just grumble at him about that, and he wasn't really looking to put him in a bad mood on Christmas, of all days, and so he exhaled a breath and steeled himself and sat up, setting the phone back on the table before he pushed the covers off his legs and swung them over the side of the bed. He scratched his abdomen with one hand and the back of his head with the other, yawning and stretching his back just the slightest until it popped, and he grunted and groaned a little and sat there, shoulders slumped, as he looked out at the dim, dreary sight Manhattan made at this moment.
to either one of them? Well, maybe I would have before you came along, but the point is I don't necessarily
Steve shrugged, and Tony pressed close to him again and said, "Come on. Song's almost over. Don't want to waste a moment of it."
, I've kind of known about you my entire life, but we only actually met face-to-face about, oh, three-and-a-half years ago. Four, if you want to round up."
"Damned right you did," Tony muttered as he poured himself a cup of coffee. "You want some of this?"
So, once they'd had the decency to leave him alone for a moment, Tony tried on the ensemble, fitting himself into the bustier that was just a smidge snug against his abdomen and fighting a little with the zipper on the dress before he got it zipped and turned to check himself out. It was actually a pretty tasteful dress, simple, with what Natasha described as a boat neck and a banded effect that gave the appearance of an hourglass shape before it straightened into what he was pretty sure was called an A-line skirt. Pepper had used that expression in the past, he was pretty sure. It pulled just a little taut at his abdomen where the swell was becoming more pronounced by the day, and he put his hand there and rubbed it a bit before Natasha said from the other side of the door, "Well?"
He laughed a little. "I have a feeling they were only planning on doing it the one time, kiddo. Sorry."
"With the…working parts of a woman?"
" Steve asked, looking equal parts surprised and, if he was reading him right, pleased.
Steve looked like he was trying very hard not to let his anger get the best of him, and Tony turned to her and said, "OK, seriously, that's like the…tenth time you've said something like that."
Which it wasn't overall. He'd read the horror stories, sure, but so far things had been…not just bearable for him but OK. Good, even. Not much pain. Maybe it felt a little weird — at least at first until he went numb from the sensation — but other than that, it really wasn't so bad.
He rolled his eyes. "Whatever. I don't need Bruce yet. I'm fine."
... He'd loved his mother so much. She was a smart, sophisticated woman. Beautiful. Generous. Kind.
"Besides," he added and scratched at his jaw, "if I'm listening to Steve correctly, vampires may not be as…unreal as you might think."
, pull the car over
DUM-E beeped like he was acknowledging, and as he picked up the magnifying glass, Barnes said, "This is a joke, right? You're joking. You've got me on camera, don't you?"
Thor shook his head and sat in an adjacent chair. "Nay, still no word on that most dangerous implement. It is something...much more personal to you and the Man of Iron."
She nodded at the table, and the Council felt there was little to be done except to follow her command. They each took one of the designated spots while the Red Witch said, "Viz, please serve our guests."
"We've done it before."
. Maybe it was because he still wasn't convinced this was happening to him or he still didn't think he would actually have to go through with it, but he spent most of his time giggling and not being able to listen to either the nurse
"Eh," he said with a shrug and popped a grape in his mouth. "Did you eat?"
" she finally said. "
, and here's a crazy suggestion,
woman that's been seen around town with Captain America. And she is, quite obviously, pregnant. Who are most people going to assume the father is?"
Steve shook his head. "Yeah, but I shouldn't have taken advantage of—"
“Yeah,” Steve said but continued the gentle rocking motion, “you’d like that, wouldn’t you?”
baby girl, this was a child he'd actually
"I shall do it until you and he cease to be as such," Thor said with a smile.
"They do that every year," Steve reminded him and went back to eating his slice of pizza.
Also, women's bathrooms, as it turned out, a lot cleaner than men's. Still a mess to be had, he supposed, but in a different way.
Natasha set him with a perplexed look, and he shrugged and amended, "I mean, I assume that's what happened anyway."
Bruce and Rhodey continued to exchange wary looks, but Tony just slapped his hand atop Steve's hand on his knee, and he squeezed it and turned to the others.
"Hmm?" Tony asked as he held out a flute of champagne-colored carbonated beverage to him. "Nothing. Just something a little stupid, I guess."
"No, I do. Gimme."
"What?"
"You didn't give her anything. She stole it from you."
There were already rumblings about what they'd done down on Worth Street. Well, not that so much as when they'd gone out for lunch/dinner afterwards. Linner? Dunch? What was that called? Anyway, there were already rumblings about that — someone that 'looked like' Captain America attending something that 'looked a lot like' a small wedding reception at one of the more upscale restaurants with 'someone that looked like' that mystery brunette he'd been seen out with previously.
"Yeah, and I'm going to be a—"
Contrary to what most people thought, Tony was not an abysmal cook — one burned omelet for Pepper aside. OK, he really hadn't even taken the time to learn how to do it until he'd had something called 'shield waffles' demanded of him once upon a time, and after realizing that it wasn't the worst experience in the world, he found out he kind of
He blew out a breath and said, "Uh, yeah, I, uh— I said you had a family in that other universe, right?"
Steve stopped in his tracks and frowned at Tony. "We don't have to do it—"
So, Tony lay back on the table, the hard vinyl not exactly the most comfortable thing around, and he wiggled around on it as Bruce took his pulse and listened to his heartbeat and made him sit up so he could look in his ears.
He focused on the very last, only because the words were still fresh in his mind. "So, when you say 'marriage vows—'"
in your mouth."
OK, maybe he just wanted to see how red and squeamish Steve could turn before he finally got the words out.
"Oh, my god," Barton muttered. "Blah, blah, blah. Look, just kiss each other goodnight so we can get the hell out of here, OK? I promise your baby-daddy will be in tip-top shape the next time you see him. He can't even get drunk on Thor's special Asgardian homebrew."
And then, from the middle of the heretofore silent group, Barnes blew into one of those unfurling, squawking noisemakers, a cheesy 'Happy Birthday!' pointed hat on his head, and yet somehow, a glowering look on his face.
"First of all, it's a boy. We know it's a boy."
really was — was worth it.
"I know," he said and half-considered telling Steve to get out of the line and take them anywhere but there, especially since little James Anthony was not in the mood to relax that evening. But they'd already agreed to do this, and they'd agreed to do it
"Grow up," Tony said just as Rhodey chimed in with, "Come on, it's really not that bad."
Barton reminded him they weren't at 'fucking Hogwarts.' Wilson perked up and asked what house everyone thought they'd be in if they were. Barnes just asked, "What the hell is a 'Hogwarts'?"
Tony smiled a little in return, and before he knew it, Steve was leaning in and kissing him, pressing his mouth to Tony's in a chaste but warm measure of affection. One hand still holding the trinket, Tony reached out with his free hand and cupped Steve's cheek, holding him there and ignoring the chorus of immature groans that greeted them at the gesture.
Which was definitely not something he was putting any energy into at the moment because, again, he wasn't sure he'd like the results. Steve might have paid lip service to Tony getting back to his original form, but for all he knew, deep down, Steve was sort of hoping that Tony would just stay the way he was. If he was remembering that week correctly, Steve seemed to enjoy sex with female Tony as much as he did male Tony, and there was the fact that he could become aroused quite easily just by
, and, uh, that's the way it goes."
"Steve, I'm fine," he said and didn't even hide the fact that he was rolling his eyes.
fast." Natasha hummed out a response but said nothing beyond that.
"Anything?" he asked sometime the next morning.
"I don't know," Bruce replied. "She's your daughter."
"What, like comic books?"
He left the bathroom, and Tony was sitting on the bed staring down at some small, black, rectangular thing in his hand.
"Didn't plan on it," Wilson said then made a pointed effort to dip his eggs into the puddle of ketchup and take a savory bite. "Mmm…" he said to Barnes's eye-rolling annoyance. "So good."
," he'd muttered in response. "
"Steve, this isn't Hydra," Tony said before Steve could comment on the situation. "You've done everything you can to keep Hydra out of this little spot of heaven we've carved for ourselves here."
"She's level-headed."
He shook his head but didn't let go of her. "I'm fine."
him. But it hadn't, and he'd come to accept that there were just certain things about himself that even the serum couldn't fix.
Steve glanced down at the baby resting against his shoulder, and he opened his mouth like he was going to protest but then sighed and shook his head and said, "It's time for her nap."
Cap shot a glance back at the portal before he looked over and met Tony's eyes. Tony braced himself for the usual dour seriousness, but instead, Cap broke out into a smile and said, "It's not so bad, is it?"
"You're forcing him to bear a life quite possibly at the expense of his own because you think it's funny to play with people's emotions."
accustomed to this whole thing.
Hey, you never knew when knowing how to change an infant's diaper might come in handy.
Tony stopped and frowned at him, and Barnes made a slight face and scratched at the back of his head.
"A picture you take of yourself with your phone."
Barnes hedged, and Tony was certain he was about to turn tail and run again until he said, "A little while?"
"Fixing hair?" Tony asked.
a date."
"Yeah, as a term of endearment. I'm not making fun of how old you are."
"First, we don't even know if the serum would affect that."
"No," Steve said, lightly, to counter him. He pressed a kiss against Tony's neck and added, "Something wrong with wanting to be right next to my best fella?"
, and Tony braced himself for some kind of surprise party they would throw for him behind Steve's back. Somehow. Because it was hard to do anything without Steve knowing about it — if he didn't snoop himself then
The room went oddly quiet at that, and Tony turned and stared at their blank looks in a little confusion before Bruce cleared his throat and said, "Oh, yeah, that's mine. I, uh, I was going to write down some things I thought we needed from the store, and I, uh—" He scratched the back of his head. "Didn't I write anything?"
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yeah, that's what battered and abused women want. Pop-Tarts."
He motioned to Barton, who was sitting there looking contemplative — or as much as someone with a murder face could look contemplative — and said, "Think I could get the ball rolling on 'Superhusbands'? Like 'superhero' but with
Barton fumbled for purchase with his thoughts before he said, "Look, it— It was a private conversation, all right?"
"Yeah? Steve's more stubborn than I am."
Tony waggled his eyebrows. "Because as much of a whore as I'm made out to be by the media, I'm not an exhibitionist, and your pal Stevie over there has a very unique viewpoint of what constitutes 'helping' me in my workshop— Or, what did you call it? Church?" He hummed a little in thought. "It's not untrue, is it?"
"It's been suspended before," Steve said with a slight shake of his head.
"But it's not known," Jim cut in. "Nobody actually knows what happens."
"Because I'm an old man, Steve! Because I'm an old, middle-aged man, and I look like an old middle-aged man."
He put the mug to his lips and downed a soothing gulp of the drink, and Steve leaned over and kissed his forehead then sat back and began to pick at his bagel. "So, what are you thinking?"
"Good luck getting anyone to stick it in your cold, shriveled cunt, you bitch."
"Please don't," Bruce said, the grimace on his face audible in his tone.
"What?"
"Steve's not here. Steve refuses to accept anything but victory, which is what scares me. If anything ever happened to you?" She smiled a little, but it was sharp and maybe a little disquieting. "I'm not sure the universe would survive it, never mind the world."
Bruce had caught up but remained a few steps back, aware of the fact that getting too close to Tony was a surefire way of spooking him and sending him into a flight response. Especially for something like this.
"Fuck off, Barton," he muttered as Barton reached down and snagged the downed armor.
Rhodey turned to him, face folded into concern. "You serious?"
The fact that anyone could look at Steve the way Tony looked at him — like he was this modern marvel, like the sun rose and fell on him, like he'd hung the moon — amazed Steve to no end. No one had ever looked at him that way. Even Peggy hadn't.
"Love you, too, sour patch," Tony said, and Jim just turned and clapped Steve on the shoulder and said, "Merry Christmas."
Steve blinked, unsure of exactly what Tony's aim was, and he stuttered and stumbled over his words a bit before he pointed down the small hall and said, "Uh, yeah, down there."
"OK," he said and carried her into the bedroom. Hopefully, the Cap wouldn't get too angry about this, though hopefully, he would never know in the first place.

sure there's
"What are you talking about?"
"I don't know why. I just lightly ran my foot up your leg—"
, all right? I just— I don't really care that much."
Wait,
He gave her a slightly pained smile, but he then looked between them and said, "You're just trying to steal my date from me."
"If you'd
on me?"
now, I swear to god."
Steve sat on the edge of the bed, and he checked his tablet one more time, set it aside, took a quick drink of water from the glass on the table beside the bed, then turned back to him.
"I don't know, I don't know, and I don't know," he said because…well, technically, he
Steve shook his head a little. "Sorry," he said, "hate to disappoint, but that's coming from Steve Rogers."
"Give me tonight. Give me one night. If you don't think you can trust me after tonight, then we shake hands, say it's been a blast, and go on our way."
"Steve in particular," she said, almost marveling at the very idea of it. "I can't understand why. I mean, usually
"Honey, I'm not trying to hurt you, and I'm not trying to insult you. I'm just saying that
He took a sip of his coffee, and Steve took a sip of his chocolate in kind.
Sam actually looked a little...annoyed? Hurt? It was hard to tell.
As Olivia continued to cry and shake her fists in the air, Tony succumbed to his own tears, cradling the baby closer and sobbing out all the pain and misery he'd been trying to suppress for the past couple days — ugly crying, the kind that came with snot mixed in with the tears and puffy red, eyes to match a puffy, red, splotchy face. He sobbed and held his daughter closer, and when he realized some of his tears (hopefully just his tears) were dropping onto her, he tried to wipe his face off on his sleeves and snuffled back what he could. He sobbed out all his heartache for a few minutes longer before he was finally able to gain some control over himself, and through swollen eyelids, he blinked away some of the stray tears clinging to his eyelashes and looked down at the frustrated newborn in his arms. His voice cracking some, he cooed and tried to hum what he thought might be a soothing tune — though whether he was trying to soothe her or himself he wasn't sure — and after a moment, he snuffled once again and gazed down at his angry little brown-eyed cutie and said, "Well, that does it. I am never, ever, ever letting you go for anyone or anything. Hydra took your daddy away from us, but over my dead body will they ever take you, too, and just for him, I will lay every single one of those fucking bastards to waste. They'll never know what hit them. And I promise you, baby girl, that you will grow up in a world where you will never, ever have to worry about those sons-of-bitches ever again."
"Steve—"
"Thanks," he muttered but didn't loosen his hold any, and Tony held him a little closer and stroked the soft, short hairs at the nape of his neck.
Steve nodded like that was what he'd figured. "Yeah, we've never made a big deal about it before, right?"
She shrugged. "Nothing much. Pepper wasn't in a very good mood because Tony went spouting that off last night, so every Tom, Dick, and Harry that thinks he's Tony's 'Steve' was harassing the company today—"
had dark hair."
"Hey, I could totally take over the world if I wanted to."
"How long?" Steve asked and peered at the monitor that was busy running the sequencing process.
"They don't have to know the exact circumstances, you know. Physically, you are not a man, Tony. I know this is scary for you, but
"Hmm…well, I guess you'd better look for new digs."
Steve's eyes about bugged out of his head, and he leaned down and pressed a hard and sloppy kiss against Tony's mouth then pulled back and said, "No, I'm fine with it. I'm up for it. What do you need? Do you want me on the bed? Do you want me to stand? Should I sit on the chair over there? Do you want me to kneel? What do you want me to—?"
"But look what you have to show for it."
He wanted to tell Bruce to go fuck himself, but he grudgingly had to admit that the man was right. He fought to gain a little traction again, sitting up just a little, Natasha and Barnes both supporting him and bracing him, and he went with it, not listening to Bruce but listening to what his body was telling him to do. Because even though this was nightmarish pain that he couldn't have ever imagined on his worst day, there was still something…
Other Tony opened the box and tucked the bottom into the lid as he said, "I can't promise you anything, but I hope this is something like what you're looking for."
"—some screwball cosmonaut shows up in the middle of a battle already in progress down in the Financial District. You remember that, don't you?"
"Dude," Wilson said, "he spoils you. That— That's not a
“Yeah, yeah, just do it!”
"Yeah? With what?"
"Tony, don't eat and fly at the same time," Steve said without looking.
"Is he…pregnant?"
My husband wants to make love to me.
Steve could only laugh.
He laughed like he didn't believe him. "Sure. Come on," he said and made a motion to put his arm around Tony's shoulder, but Tony ducked away quickly and said, "Look, save your breath and your time. I'm seeing someone."
of the matter might, um, scare you off." Steve just stared at him, watching, waiting for him to continue, and he scratched at his jaw and said, "
"Exactly," Steve said with a nod. "So, what's the point of buying all this—"
Steve and Tony glanced at each other, their eyes doing a sort of dance as they gave this some consideration, while Bruce said, "So…we have to put up with this crap for the rest of our lives?"
He snorted a laugh and said, "You're not wrong," before he flopped back down and tried to get comfortable again. He sighed and tossed and turned, and he lay there and stared at the ceiling for he didn't know how long before he said, "J?"
Steve glanced back at him from where he stood at the set looking for the antenna. "FM? What's that?" He pointed to the set. "Doesn't this have an antenna?"
Tony groaned again and smacked his head against Steve’s hip. “That twenty-pound little cock- blocker!”
"Oh! Hey!" Rhodey said, jerking back a little before he set hesitant hands on his back. "Yeah. OK. We're doing this, huh? Oh. Wow," he said as he tightened his arms just a fraction. "This, uh, this feels weird. Have we done this since you got, uh…? I don't think we, uh…"
He frowned. "What relationship?"
"Yeah."
He hummed but didn't say anything beyond that, and she tweaked a small smile at him and said, "Nothing I own will fit you. We'll have to go out and find something that works."
"Later!" Steve said and practically slammed the bedroom door closed behind them.
Tony turned, sandwich halfway to his mouth, and saw a yawning Steve entering the kitchen, scratching his stomach as he shuffled into the room. He ignored the question and took the bite, savoring the taste, and Steve checked the wrapper on the counter and said, "Oh, good, you found it."
"Weird?" Tony asked.
He took a deep inhale of breath through his nose and nodded, and he let go of Steve's chin to better cup Steve's face in his hands.
"Was it bad?"
Pepper's eyes went wide, and she glanced down at the little girl still hugging her tightly, her arms dropping as though to touch her gently and protectively and said, "Children? Is this our—"
"You… You're related to him, aren't you?" Steve could have smacked himself for the waver in his voice.
God help him, there was a part of him that was feeling very,
"I think Steve would see the symbolism in it," Bruce said and dug a spoon into the flesh of the fruit.
She narrowed her gaze at it. "Does it have the yucky stuff in it?"
worked up, he just nodded and said, "So…you'll think about it?"
"There is a theory that bondmates have such a connection. The passion never wanes from their relationship. It continues to burn and feed the embers of both lust and love. Bondmates also have a way of becoming so engrossed with one another that they are able to block out the presence of their closest brethren. And it is said that bondmates can speak entire conversations with each other by just their eyes."
"Actually, Arnie was a friend of mine when I was a kid. Don't know what happened to him."
"Yeah, OK," Steve said and stood at the foot of the bed looking like he wasn't sure what to do with himself, one hand at the back of his neck as he stared at the tousled sheets. "OK, yeah, go brush your teeth, and I'll be here."
"Butt dialing?"
"You know it could," Bruce said solemnly. "To be fair, lots of things could. Every time you go out as Iron Man could be your last, but this… This is something you could actually do something about."
"No," he said with a laugh. "But isn't that the reason Cap's got such a gargantuan appetite?" He looked at Steve. "Chihuahua-sized you wasn't eating this much, was he?" He glanced to Natasha beside him and added, "Hey! I could go ask Barnes!"
"Uh huh," he said and opened the fridge. So, alternate universe Cap and Tony wore wedding rings, alternate universe him called Cap 'babe,' and alternate universe Cap evidently worried about his safety. Well, that's was nice. Sickeningly sweet, maybe, but nice, he supposed.
"Um, OK?"
, but the just the idea of me being a mom or doing mom things or anything like that and it somehow making me
, and yet he was standing there with a goddamned shiny party hat and a fucking noisemaker hanging out of his mouth.
He hadn't gone with the pink bedding set.
Steve took a step toward her. "What's that supposed to mean?" he asked, something dark and intimidating in his voice, and Tony glanced over and saw he was letting the baby suck on his pinky finger, her tiny little fingers curled around his much larger and stronger ones.
"OK, let the record show that only one of you in this room has any decency, and it's not the one from the forties."
prenatal appointment."
"I have not physically changed your form. I have merely allowed for you to age," she said breezily, like that made all the difference in the world.
JARVIS butted in again, "
didn't seem real. It
"No, you don't understand," Rhodey said. "That guy was a
He nodded then said, "Yeah, but what do you think Steve would look like with a beard? You think he could pull it off? Some guys can. Like, uh, what's-his-face from
He looked between Bruce and Rhodey. "Is she back-talking me? Am I getting back-talk from a four-year-old?"
Steve nodded and kissed his forehead then grabbed his phone from the charger and a set of earbuds from the drawer.
"Really," she said, smiling, and Tony knew that sort of smile because it was the kind he found his own face breaking into whenever he thought about Steve.
And then he'd looked up, and Steve had been gobsmacked by the most beautiful brown eyes he'd ever seen, big and sharp and framed with inky black lashes. Pretty Eyes seemed equally smitten by him, his mouth going slack as he raked his eyes over Steve's form, but Steve, not wanting to get off on the wrong foot, had just said, "
"So you'll let me swell up with a parasite that'll no doubt kill me unless we find some way of getting it out?"
"It's…" He shrugged and began to undress, folding his clothes and setting them on a chair set in the corner of the room. "I don't know. It's the principle of the thing, I guess."
"But this Esmeralda can," Steve supplied, and Tony only then realized Steve was holding his hand and squeezing it for dear life.
Romanoff muttered something in Russian before she turned on both Bruce and Barton in surprise.
and this is just some joke you're playing on us."
The Cap just smiled at him, somewhat bemused and a little confused. "Thanks?"
Tony just stared at him. "That is the exact argument you gave me last night when I teased you about that. And no, she can't. Not unless she's hiding it from us."
Steve just grimaced and rubbed at the back of his neck. "Yeah, unfortunately."
"He was seduced by a power he did not understand and could not control."
He grimaced and hedged, whining a little as he tried to decide between orange juice Steve had probably backwashed into and his own breast milk. He glanced back at the sink and though about dumping some water over it, but that would probably just turn it into a flavorless paste. The orange juice at least had flavor, and the milk was at least sweet. Either one would make the particleboard fragments that made up the muesli much more palatable. He could eat it dry, but then, he could also eat a bowl of drywall screws dry, too.
"Oh, fuck off!"
Steve was still a moment, staring at the photos, before he nodded, and Tony watched his Adam's apple bob up and down as he swallowed.
"No, I think you're good."
"What?" Steve asked, but Bucky continued unabated.
He didn't look Tony in the eye as he said that, and Tony had a feeling he felt a little embarrassed or defeated by the fact that his oldest pal felt more comfortable opening up in front of a, for all intents and purposes, total stranger than he did his little friend from the bad, old days. He supposed he could understand. It would be like if something had happened to Rhodey and Rhodey was more open and available to Steve than he was to Tony when they got him back. He could understand Steve's frustration in that regard.
Steve took it and pocketed it then made his way back over to Tony, and like the gentleman that he was, he held out his arm for Tony to take. Tony, grasping his own small clutch in his hand, took his arm and said a suspicious, "What did you do?"
," JARVIS intoned from on high, "
"I suppose. I mean, the one thing I wish more than anything… I really wish my ma coulda met you. I wish you coulda met her."
He sat down on the corner chair, and he set the shoes on the floor before he opened the tin of black shoe polish and took some onto the rag. He picked up one of the shoes and began to rub the polish into it, and Tony stood there and watched for a few moments before he said, "How long is this going to take?"
"And you believed him?" Barton asked.
Steve frowned and bit his lip, and Bucky and Sam both noticed his worried countenance, but Bucky was the one that said, "What? What's wrong now, Steve?"
Steve nodded, his eyes on Tony's abdomen, but Tony saw his shoulders had yet to relax.
"Oh, don't give me that bullshit! Steve tried the same thing.
Steve pointed at the sheet and said, "You can probably check 'none' under birth control."
"Not entirely," he said, the tablet resting on his lap as he swiped through screens with one hand and fed himself with the other.
Luckily, it had just gone onto the wrapper Steve's sandwich was sitting on. Served the backwashing bastard right.
"It does."
"I'm sorry," Tony said and turned to him. "Of the two of us, which one
"Uh, no. That would only be if we were both kidding ourselves. I have it from a reliable source that Steve is very much attracted to me in both bodies. God, how weird is it that I can even say that?"
Steve pulled away and tried to right Tony a little bit, and he let go of Tony's hips and said, "See you on the 'jet," before he turned and made his way out of the lab.
Anthony had been enamored of the handsome young knight from an early age. Ten years separated them, with Steven as the elder, though as far as the Council was concerned, the knight had not shown any interest in the young heir until after the death of the King. Perhaps knowing that he had forever lost any right, title, or claim to the lands that Howard had promised him, he sought to take them by other means — seducing a naïve, young king whose carnal urges overrode his better angels. He had secured himself a position on the King's Council, and, in almost no time, had secured for himself the position of High Chancellor, the King's closest advisor, and the one person King Anthony would listen to above all others.
He went into the kitchen, the lights coming on immediately upon entry, and he went over and set Olivia in her highchair then said, "Let's see about that coffee."
Bruce just raised an eyebrow. "And you're sure of that?" he asked, his tone flat.
"You're really not, you know," he replied in the same matter-of-fact tone. "And don't forget: soul mates. The crazy space lady said so."
"Seriously?" he muttered as Steve went over to the dresser. Steve chuckled a little and glanced over to him.
Then he added, before Steve could begin to imagine anything bad,
"And doesn't everyone take Captain America at his word?"
He pulled his ring off and handed it to Steve. Steve took it in hand and inspected it, finding, just like his, the numbers 04-24-2014 engraved along with—
Tony just swallowed and nodded, unsure of how to respond properly to that. "Duly noted," he said and tweaked a smile.
"Thought my publicity days were over," he muttered before he turned his attention to Pepper and said, "Where is she?"

"Well, maybe it's time for me to start playing dirty, too."
"OK, ow," was the first thing out of his mouth, and Natasha stopped her humming and turned to glance at him, continuing to bounce the baby ever-so-gently as she did so.
Did you get your hands replaced with vice grips or something?"
"Oh, man, it's not something...weird, is it?" Jim asked, a squeamish look on his face.
OK, well, sure. That made sense. Of course there'd be that overlap. Their Steve would had to have been practically inhuman not to have something like that affect him. It didn't… It didn't
"You're deliberately misreading my intent. The universe wants us together, babe. It's always wanted us together. Maybe it's time we stop fighting it and start, you know, embracing it."
while the clerk just smacked her chewing gum, and wasn't that completely unprofessional? Chewing gum and working the city marriage license bureau?
Steve chuckled again and pushed inside him, and Tony groaned out in equal parts pleasure and relief. There was something almost comforting about having Steve inside of him —
out of the room—"
"Would you like me to have that recalibrated, too?" she asked, but she was smiling as she said it, and Tony turned to Steve and said, "Is she sassing me?"
"Twenty seconds."
"No," he said quickly, stilling his gentle rocking motions. "No, I want to do it."
"OK," she said and led him over to the sofa. "Sit."
Tony went to open his mouth to respond, but he blanked at the last moment on the answer and, instead, glanced back to Steve, who just shot him a look that could only be read as
"Shit,
Steve hesitated for only a second as he tried to figure out just what Stark was saying there, and he shook his head a little to clear his mind then said, “Someone’s got to bring you into line. As the team’s captain, it’s my responsibility to see that every member understands their role and position in the squad and acts accordingly.”
"You really want to know what I think?" Steve asked, his voice low and hitting an octave that was usually only reserved for their most lustful and debauched of trysts.
Natasha couldn't help but snort a laugh at that.
"Does that mean you're going to marry me?" Tony asked, his voice muffled by Steve's shoulder.
"I don't think he's the one that took it, honey."
Tony just tweaked a brief smile at him. "Can't say. Don't want to spoil the surprise."
blabbed to him — not to mention the fact that Steve was barely out of Tony's sight those days. He went on the odd mission, he went through practice runs with the team (including Barnes, whose grudgingness to go along had dissipated quite a bit over the course of the summer), he discussed tactics and strategy for potential targets or missions they might find themselves on at some later date, but more often than not, he was in the penthouse watching TV while Tony puttered around cleaning and straightening (Barton, that asshole, insisted he'd entered the 'nesting stage' of the pregnancy, whatever that meant) or in Tony's lab drawing while Tony stared at his screen and pretended like he was working on projects for the gang (only computer solitaire seemed to be able to hold his attention nowadays).
“You’ve been informed? What, did someone hand you a manual when we became friends,” because they’re definitely friends now, even if Steve wants to maybe try for something more, “‘The Care and Keeping of Steven Grant Rogers’?”
“Sorry.” Steve ducks his head, the tips of his ears turning pink – fucking adorable. “You were very focused, I didn’t want to interrupt.”
If you were to walk the streets of New York in the year 2121, Dear Reader, you would see a much different world than the one of a hundred years before. Those dangerous streets, which you should not walk alone for the sake of your own well-being, have become the territory of a predator far more dangerous and cunning than your average criminal. This predator is discerning and only stalks a certain type of prey, so hypothetically there should be no cause for you to worry.
“Secondly, I am pleased to announce that Anthony Stark will be resuming his post as Chief Scientific Officer and head of the Research and Development Division. And no,” She raises her voice a little to cut off the few interjected questions, “We will not be taking questions about where he has been since his disappearance from society. Mr. Stark asks that you respect his privacy.”
Steve’s mouth hangs open while he tries to think of a rebuttal. The most frustrating thing is that his mind comes up completely blank. “That’s – it’s not – I’m not looking for a relationship.”
And he loves in return.
“Sir?” Before Steve can reconcile this new information with the Tony he just saw walking out of his life, Jarvis pings his tablet. “There appears to be a situation developing on the sixty-eighth floor. I believe this footage may be of interest to you.” Despite being a machine, Jarvis manages to sound strangely tense and when the video starts playing, Steve realizes why. His heart hurts when he sees Tony carrying Yinsen through the office, settling him in a chair and fussing over him. Steve, as well as Phil and Natasha watching over his shoulder, tenses when Obadiah enters the office. If Tony’s been hidden from the world for decades, there’s no way that Obadiah didn’t at least have a hand in orchestrating the whole thing. The very sight of him makes Steve’s skin crawl.
“Mhm. Possibly even longer, to make up for the bad thoughts I’m having right now.”
There’s one wriggling worm of a thought that won’t leave him alone, the one bit of doubt to ruin his happiness. He still hasn’t found the right moment to explain to Tony about his moonlighting as a Repo Man, but. He’s just.
Tony shakes his head in answer to both questions.
Steve blinks in confusion again. “So…we’re free?”
are a super-secret assassin man. Said boytoy then watched you assault someone he cares about, knocked you over the head with a fire extinguisher – yeah, we saw the footage of that and we’re very disappointed in your reflexes – and then still released you and everyone you care about from our contracts out of the goodness of his heart.”
“Jesus Christ.” The look on Tony’s face can only be described as horror and it wounds something deep inside of Steve. He’s not surprised, he already knows he’s a freak of nature, but it’s still disappointing. “And now they’ve got both of you in contracts for life?”
I'll make some of it better, I promise.
Or maybe he’s just fucking delusional and he’s never going to see the guy again.
for once.
” He’s shocked into meeting Tony’s tired, fierce gaze. “Of course not, why would you think that?”
“Fuck. You. You cruel, heartless bastard, he was worth twenty of you, you are nothing without him, without me or Pepper. You’re a fucking figurehead, absolutely useless and even my fucking father knew it – “
and Tony huffs in response. “Don’t look at me like that, I’m trying here. Just, if you
“And you’re a lot closer than twenty paces right now.” Steve takes his drink and settles one hip against the bar. “You’re wrong about two things, though.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have some plans for you to approve, and I’m here to remind you that you have a meeting in the morning with Yinsen and Obediah about the next iteration of your arc reactor.” She sets an impressively tall stack of files on a different bench, he’ll have to remind Jarvis to file them later, and then crosses her arms. “What did you want to talk to me about?”
The high-rise office is dark when they stop out of the elevator, unusual even at this late hour. Pepper lives at the office almost as much as Tony does, it’s weird to see it unoccupied.
Tony gets to watch in slight amusement as Steve’s jaw clicks shut and he nods. “Later, then.”
The light dims a little from Yinsen’s expression, but he hides it with a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Not magic, simply good connections. But yes, I found a few scraps that I melted down, and the end product might be of use to you.” He takes a small container off the nearby bench and hands it to Tony. When he opens it, the metal inside shimmers with a hypnotic light, powerful in an understated way.
“Yeah, no, absolutely.” Tony grins right back. “Buy me a drink, tell me about yourself, Steven.”
Now, they’re standing in the kitchen and living area, Tony leaning against the couch and talking at Steve which Steve makes them sandwiches. Tony is talking about all the initiatives that Stark Industries spearheads when he clears his throat and stands up straighter.
“No, hey. Don’t apologize.” Tony looks around and his gaze lands on the chair, expression darkening. “One second.”
So Tony levered himself up, and slowly, so achingly slowly to give him time to turn away, pressed his lips against Steve’s. Steve gasped against his mouth and then pressed back, keeping the kiss innocent but making sure Tony knew that he was enjoying it too. When he pulled back, Steve beamed at him, all golden in the sun and absolutely, breathtakingly beautiful.
“These are different.” Phil takes a hold of Clint’s arms, but purposefully, not in a sexy way. This is not how it usually goes when Phil visits him when he’s on duty. Clint frowns. “Clint, this is serious. They’re saying we’re going to be moving away from I.R.O.N. transplants, into a new biogenerated system that the R&D department is developing.”
He may be distracted, but he’s not completely oblivious, which is why the mood in the bunk hits him like a wall when he walks in. His whole team is waiting with grim looks on their faces, focused on Natasha’s tablet. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
“Tony.” Steve laughs again, “I’m not a model. I’m an admin assistant, I just do whatever needs doing.”
“My own knight in shining armor.” Steve grins and picks up his pad and pencil again. He starts sketching, reproducing the way Tony moves around the lab, turning the sleek lines and constant movement into flight and tech-influenced shining armor of his own. He feels Tony’s eyes on him again, but when he raises his own head to meet them, Tony is working intently at his own project again.
Steve squints at him. “I think so? But I don’t like your tone.”
“We don’t have time, Tony. Mr. Stane wants to start testing the automatic failure software by the end of next month, and we still don’t have a working model to show him. I need you to push a testing version through, if not for the universal software, then something for at least one of the bio organs.”
“Alright, okay. I’ll have something testable soon, just for you.” Pepper rolls her eyes over the videophone connection, and Tony can hear the elevator open behind him. He freezes, a rookie mistake, and he can tell she notices.
“You know, I don’t have much practice with the, uh, listening thing.” Steve raises his head in surprise at Tony trying to be
(See the end of the chapter for
Something is wrong here.
“I can always leave,” Steve says, teasingly. They both know he would be sitting alone in the bunkroom if he wasn’t here, waiting for Clint and Bucky to return safe. “If you don’t want the pleasure of my company, I don’t –“ He stops abruptly when he sees the chair, tucked back in another corner of the workshop, and the memories come flooding back.
Steve almost laughs at how fast the kid is scribbling, or he would if he wasn’t listening single-mindedly to Tony, hope and despair warring in his chest.
“What the
“Pepper!” Tony steps out of the bathroom, toweling off his hair and yelling through the towel. “
“Which
But his cries are cut short by the impact of a blunt object to his temple, knocking him unconscious. He slumps further against the side of the dumpster as his assailant retrieves his tool and sets down his case. The box opens with a quiet hiss and some smoke as pressure is released, and the predator retrieves a curious knife from within. The weapon is double bladed, one edge serrated and the other smooth and razor sharp, for delicate work. The predator leans over his prey, and murmurs a quiet apology, the same one he offers to all his victims. He tests the weight of the knife in his hand, as though it would have changed since the last time, the last hundred times he has done this. He clenches his fist around the blade and begins to work.
After Tony has to basically reevaluate his entire fucking life, and figured out that Pepper was the only good thing he had left from his life before Iron Man.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I found an old design that might be of interest as a replacement for your current…apparatus, and I was simply inquiring as to whether you wished for me to make a prototype.”
Steve can feel the force of Tony’s eye roll all the way from the back of the stage, and he has to fight not to join in. To his right, Bucky and Clint are snickering at the reporters practically salivating for a story and placing bets on which ones are gonna draw first blood. Natasha and Phil, on the other side, practically radiate disapproval at the entire spectacle.
Steve pokes his head over the back of the couch, looking baffled and a touch amused. “Tony? Babe, are you alright?”
“Well, maybe they don’t know you like I do.” Steve brushes some hair away from Tony’s face. “Maybe they don’t see you like I do.”
“Good morning and thank you all for coming on such short notice. We have some announcements to make about the future of Stark Industries. There will be a press release once we’re finished here, but we wanted to present some changes in person.”
“Okay?” Steve frowns a little and crosses his arms right back. “We’ve been getting to know each other. That’s not a crime, last time I checked.”
And so, in a calculated risk, Tony steps out of the elevator into the backroom of a bar.
and it’s going to take me time to make exactly what he wants, not to mention the fact that it won’t just be computer programming, there’s the biological component which makes everything more complicated, and really I should be consulting Banner because this isn’t exactly my area of expertise–“
design –“
), and he starts paying attention. He pays attention when she really needs him to sign things, even though he’s the lowly head of R&D now. He pays attention when she finally lets him take her out, and she talks about art all the way through the Guggenheim. (The first time he kisses her tastes like strawberries and sunshine.)
“What the hell?” It takes a lot to make Steve jump, but even he startles when a voice speaks to him in what he thought was an empty hallway. “Buck?”
Parameters defined in the algorithm, he just has to sit back and relax as the used vial is extracted from his chest, and the new one is inserted. A heat he hadn’t realized was building in his chest dissipates, and he sighs in relief. Once the chair releases him, he pats DUM-E’s mechanical arm and heads back to the bedroom attached to his lab, an extension of his quarters (prison). Tony roots around a bit for a clean, somewhat flattering shirt, until Jarvis interjects, “Sir?”
So yeah, Pepper is one of the main reasons he gets his shit together. Stark Industries becomes a leader in the clean energy sector, Tony promotes Pepper because he knows she wouldn’t want to date her boss (and this way he gets to date his boss which is
They eat in silence for a bit, enjoying the sunshine and the company. Steve sits back on his hands and looks over the New York City skyline, sighing, and Tony continues to watch him, cleaning up the remains of their lunch. It’s quiet for a while, and Tony is memorizing the angle of Steve’s jawline when the man himself remarks, “It’s a great view.”
“No, of course not. The I only–“ Yinsen stops suddenly and waits, focusing intently on something. He strides over to the holoscreens and calls up security footage. Tony joins him, but he can’t see anything except a quick black streak in the corner of one of the cameras.
“We all know you’re perfectly capable, Nat. No one’s doubting your inherent badassery. But you also don’t have to put yourself through something unnecessarily painful if you don’t want to.”
She sighs and pushes his face away with an affectionate hand, and hands Steve the tablet with the other. “Take it. Otherwise this one is just going to mother me the whole time. I don’t put up with that nonsense, not even when it was from my own mother.”
"Yeah, but it's not fair to her," Tony said. "I mean, if you're just settling for her—"
"Tony, no," Steve said with an exhale of breath. "I trust you. I just… I don't trust myself."
He reached out and took hold of one small foot and played with it a bit, and she took her eyes off Steve for a moment to look over in his direction and, as brown locked in with an identical shade, like a bolt of lightning hitting him from upon high—
"How 'bout I take you home, and then I'll go out and get some gelato for you. It might not be the exact kind that you want—"
had to polish his damned shoes.
"How? His has stupid purple arrows on the case— Never mind. Does he still have it?"
"You didn't deserve any of it," Steve murmured.
Steve glanced back in time to see the little girl stop what she was doing, her little mouth pursed together and a displeased furrow to her small brow as she dug her fingers into her plush little toy.
"I—I don't want that."
She shrugged. "Papa usu'lly fixes it," she said and shoveled some more mac and cheese into her mouth.
The rest of the table had gone on the alert as well, all leaning in and murmuring serious-sounding questions to him. All except Barton, who sat there with his glass of liquor in his hand and said, "Hiccups."
Again, Steve shushed him and moved his head to press a kiss to one sweaty, grease-stained shoulder.
when it comes to directions, all right? And can I help it if this place is so poorly designed? Look, let's hope a fire doesn't break out while we're here, because I'm telling you right now, we're not going to make it, and let's hope we pass out from smoke inhalation before the flames get to us."
Tony nodded and finished cleaning up the sheet and set it back down again. "Ah, I can see the headlines now. Captain America: Deadbeat Dad."
"Really?" was all he could say.
"Yeah, I remember. But I got a different one," he said and went over to the bed. "Come on. Let's get you changed and into bed so you can go to sleep and be not sleepy tomorrow."
Tony bristled a bit before he said, "That's different."
But Steve, noble and just Steve, was bound and determined not to have either 'Tony Stark'
"What am I supposed to do with that?" he muttered just as Bruce said, "Say, Olivia? Your Daddy and your Papa— Do they kiss each other?"
"Yeah, about that," he said as the nurse stopped beside a scale. He stopped as well, and he looked at it and said, "What's this?"
Bruce took a deep breath and repeated, "She's your daughter," like he was trying to follow Tony's train of thought and wasn't quite following.
The thing is, Tony never thought it was something that would ever be said to him. It hadn’t ever before, so he figured he was never going to hear those specific words said for him only. There had been plenty of opportunities, with his parents, or Rhodey, or Pepper. Somehow, he decided, the universe had mandated that Tony Stark wasn’t someone to love.
“And! I took the liberty of fabricating a model for you,” Yinsen turns back to the table and gives Tony a larger box. “I sent the updated model I used to Jarvis, you can improve upon that as you wish–“
“Well, I’m not alone so much anymore.” Tony turns away from that face, so he doesn’t have to look at that stupid, beautiful smirk again. “Now that I have you bothering me at all hours, whether I like it or not.” It’s suspiciously silent behind him, and Steve’s smile is even wider when he finally turns to look. “What now?”
So he watches her walk out the door, and has the sinking realization that he never told her. He never told Pepper that making her smile made him feel like he was flying, or how when she looked at him with her eyes soft and warm, he felt like he was home for the first time in so long. He never got to tell her that he loved her, and never had the chance to hear it in return.
Tony sighs a little and flops down onto the grass. His eyes are closed against the sunshine, but he opens them again when a shadow falls across his face. He squints up to see a beaming Steve standing over him. “You’re blocking my sun there, Rogers.”
” And now Steve has moved his mouth to his chest, which he
Tony loves. Steve is using his nipples against him, the sneaky bastard. He knows how sensitive they are. “Wait, Steve, baby…”
of them, all four plus an extra just because he’s a good guy. He sets Jarvis to scan the documents to find the loophole that has to be there and gives himself a moment to revel in the feeling of doing something
“Coulson’s gonna kick your ass again, Hawkeye,” Steve scolds, but he does it fighting a smile.
“Tony, you have to leave.” Yinsen’s voice is weak, but urgent. “You are in terrible danger.”
“And that’s it. There’s no coming back from that.” Steve tilts his head back in an effort to keep the tears from falling. “He hates me.”
“Listen, let’s be honest for a minute. For the past fifteen years Stark Industries has been taking advantage of the poor and sick and selling meaningless upgrades to the rich and pointless. I should know, I am a personification of everything that has gone wrong with this company.”
He can hear her sigh, exasperated and sad and goddammit, he can’t do anything right. “That’ll be all, Mr. Stark.” There’s a quiet whisper as the doors glide open and closed behind her.
Tony laughs. “Steve. Steve, can’t you see? If you can’t blame me for those things, how can I blame you for the contracts you and your incredibly vulnerable friends were trapped into?”
Steve is fairly sure he doesn’t actually skip down to the bunkroom to report in for his night shift, but he’s less sure there’s not a permanent grin on his face from spending an afternoon kissing Tony in his lab. It’s only been a few weeks, but he’s not sure that grin is ever gonna fade, and he’s increasingly certain he doesn’t want it to.
"Look, but do not touch," he said. "She's down for the count. If she stays there another half-hour or so, we should be good 'til the afternoon."
She just frowned at him again. "I don't like boring games."
Tony shrugged. "Well, only you can be the judge of that. I wasn't there, so…"
"I know, but still." He cleared his throat and met Tony's eyes again. "There was one girl. Gorgeous. Had a beautiful face and just…an amazing figure. Perfectly proportioned and symmetrical. I ended up sketching her a couple times because she was just so—"
," he murmured, embarrassment leeching into his voice.
," Barton said.
"Him on his knees," Bucky continued, and Steve's gaze shot over to him in horror, begging him to shut his fucking mouth.
Bruce heaved out a breath and pushed up his glasses to rub the bridge of his nose. "Uh,
"—but now, as an adult, I'm
Steve's hearing was impeccable, though, so there was no question that he heard Darcy's comment loud and clear. Not that he did anything but shoot her a Stare of Disapproval. He then turned to Jane and smiled cordially and said, "Doctor Foster."
Barnes couldn't have rolled his eyes harder at that if he'd tried.
Tony shot him a pointed look. "An actual 'date' or another secret rendezvous with Pepper to talk smack about me?"
"How?"
All Steve heard was a grumbled sigh then, "
"Why don't you want to show it to me?"
He pulled a knife out of the drawer and cut the sandwich into quarters, and Olivia happily picked up a quarter and bit into it, humming again as she bounced in the chair.
He shook his head to clear his thoughts, some voice in the back of his mind that sounded a lot like Sam's telling him he was only thinking that stuff because he still, to this day, felt that he was useless and needed to prove himself and his worth. Maybe that's what it was, he thought as he went about making the baby's bottle. Maybe it was just his old insecurities cropping up — that large chip on his shoulder he'd never quite been able to brush off — taunting him, teasing him, goading him with the 'fact' that he needed Tony and the baby more than they needed him. There wasn't a damned thing he could do that Tony couldn't do better — like making this goddamned bottle — and would anyone really even miss him, anyway, if he were to go? Everyone from his old life had moved on after he'd disappeared, why not this one, too?
Barnes didn't say anything, and Steve shot a remorseful look at Tony before he turned his attention back to his old friend.
"OK, again," he said and moved over to where they sat, "this is
Steve!" Tony said and fell back against the couch, laughing. "You're old!"
Maybe he just wanted to know he was still loved or appreciated or something stupid like that. Maybe #JabbatheSlut hurt a little more than he wanted to admit to even himself. Maybe he
"Yeah," Tony said. "So, that happened."
"Nothing. I'll explain when you're older," he said, erring on the side of caution.
"I like this version," he said, trying to sound as neutral as possible.
The doors closed, and Thor smiled and said, "My friend, as I mentioned before, there is something I wish to discuss with you."
"It is not. Don't exaggerate."
"Are you kidding me?" Tony said, mug in one hand while the other was planted firmly on his hip. "What is it about 'free room and board in Midtown Manhattan' that is not 'welcome' enough for you? I put you up. I build you things. I invite you to all the nicest parties."
, Pep. I got... I got married."
Nat settled herself into another armchair, and Bucky eyed the cushion between Thor and Jim, but Steve got up and said, "Here, you can have my seat."
" Jane snapped.
," Steve all but growled, and Tony put a hand on his arm as though to calm him or hold him back.
"Stop trying to block my escape, and I might."
"Wait," Barnes said, seeming to forget about the milk for the moment as he turned to Tony. "Are you a woman for the rest of your life or something?"
Tony motioned between them. "Together?"
Steve just hummed out a non-response, and Tony leaned over and kissed his forehead. "Told you I'd take care of you."
"What about it?" he muttered, not looking up from his task.
As Barnes and Natasha went into the kitchen, Barton seemed to realize what that portended, and he turned to Tony and grinned and said, "Oh, man, you're going to
. It's not as sincere that way."
"Your father is a goddamned slob. We live with a real-life Oscar Madison. Oh, god, does that make me Felix?"
He turned back to Thor. "What are Infinity stones?"
Steve made a slight face and said, "Well, I don't know how…territorial you are over her."
"Nice goin', Nattie."
"Hmm? Nothing," he said, going for jaunty and hoping he came off, at the very least, as blasé. "Unlike some people, I actually hang up my towels after I use them."
"Didn't think so." He reached over to the dashboard and hit a few switches and knobs. "I know you've got that super serum flowing through your super veins, but your feet have got to be freezing. Even super soldiers shouldn't run barefoot through six inches of snow, which, admittedly is not that much, but still."
Steve shot through a few more quick thrusts, and Tony could only think,
Was that…a wedding ring?
"I thought people didn't care about that sort of stuff nowadays?" Steve asked through a mouthful of fried rice.
. You're not the one that was turned into a woman, you're not the one that got knocked up, you're not the one that has to go through with it under pain of death. You're not the one sitting there having your entire identity screwed with because you happily identified as a male for the first forty-three years of your life and suddenly had that taken away from you, and you're now a woman — and a pregnant woman at that. I'm scared, Steve. I'm fucking terrified because I'm starting to not even know who I am, and the longer this goes on, the harder it's going to be to figure out."
Bruce just stared at him.
But Tony turned and tried to make his way to the 'jet. Only Bruce and Natasha's hands on his arms stopped him.
of things going on in my life at this moment."
to say 'knocked up'?" Steve muttered.
Fuck, was he getting old? It was Steve, wasn't it? It was Steve's old man influence on him. And in him. The fetus was probably giving off some sort of old-man energy, too.
Yeah, I remember, Steve. But I also remember a lot of other shit that's happened since then. And yeah, I get that he feels like it's his fault or something what happened to me, and I get that he feels guilty about that, but acting like it never happened doesn't change the fact that it
"Whatever," Tony said and pushed over to the couch as he opened the box. He set the top part on the table, the TV show on the screen paused as the other Avengers leaned in to see what Tony was guarding so preciously.
," Barnes cut in. "It was me. I did it. I remember it. I remember all of it. And it…"
But Steve grabbed his clothes from the floor, and he glanced down in resigned annoyance at his erection but still stepped into his boxer briefs and hissed a little at the pressure of the tight material against his cock. Tony just sat back and folded his arms, and he watched as Steve pulled a t-shirt over his head and said, "You know, five minutes, and that—" he nodded at Steve's hard, erect, deliciously thick cock, "—could be nothing but a memory."
Tony stopped drumming his fingers to look at Steve. "Sometimes I forget how old you really are," he muttered.
Steve just folded his arms and raised an eyebrow at him. "Well, maybe if you didn't put the speakers up there."
He shrugged some, humbled but not entirely embarrassed. "Well, I wasn't there," he explained, and Tony noted a slight tone of bitterness in his voice. "I didn't get to— I wasn't there to help you through it. I didn't get to see my daughter born with my own eyes."
"Hmm… Yes, that's very sweet, dear, and I'm tickled pink by the thought, but, as we've already discussed, you are a

"They do not. They just…know I'm looking out for you, too. We're all pretty useless without you."
"Don't mention it," Tony said and continued to let the song play. "Last thing I need you wondering is if you fell into an alternate universe."
"Merry Christmas, Captain."
"Meaning?"
. I never thought of Steve as the type to
Steve swallowed his nerves. He'd had to do it on occasion when Tony was being stubborn and was too busy 'sciencing' to eat, but Steve didn't want to think that anyone else had done it for him. It seemed too intimate a gesture.
" Rhodey murmured, but Tony just shrugged and didn't have a chance to explain as the tot in question came running in from the living room, clothes askew and hair all but fallen out of the ponytail holder that was hanging on for dear life. She climbed up onto the chair and began to dig in to her dinner, and Rhodey shot a pointed look between Tony and her and said, "Tones, look, if you're serious about this, maybe you might want to read a few articles about how to properly
Tony shared a look with Bruce, who looked like he was trying desperately hard not to laugh. "She's an honest one, isn't she?"

He wouldn't know what I was talking about, clearly, but… He didn't

Except Steve. Now, where in the hell was that bastard?
The music, which had moved onto another song by this point, cut out, and all that remained was silence outside of the very faint flicker of flames.
Bruce raised a curious but disbelieving eyebrow at him.
"Honestly?" the doctor asked, watching the screen a moment before she turned to Steve. "Textbook perfect. Just absolutely perfect for this point in the gestation."

, Tony. It's…" He shook his head. "Go to a doctor. Go to a real medical doctor, Tony."
Tony just reached up and began to smooth back the soft wisps of bangs from the kid's head. He didn't know why he was doing it, but it seemed an almost…natural motion to him.
"I thought you were into art? Didn't you go to art school?"
Tony shrugged but said nothing, and Steve sat back a little.
Steve stared at her a moment then said, his tone flat, "That didn't answer my question at all."
"All right," he said and shimmied them down some. "But just remember, no matter what you see, I am spoken for and by a very possessive super soldier at that. He doesn't share."
"No, no, no, no, no!" he cried, his back still to Steve, and he pulled the toddler's grabby hands away and said, "What did I tell you? Wait for Daddy." He crouched down and pulled her into a tight embrace, earning a squeak and a giggle. "Seventy years in the ice, it's the least we can do for him."
Tony looked to see that Rhodey was right and Olivia had somehow gotten sticky maple syrup down the front of the shirt but he shrugged. "What can I say?" he said and took a sip of coffee.
Steve, who should have been there more than any of them. Who was the only one he really wanted there. Goddamn him and his selfless 'the world needs him more than I do' bullshit. He should have yanked Steve off that fucking 'jet himself and handcuffed the son-of-a-bitch to his wrist.
He snorted a bitter laugh. "Yeah, they did, and I didn't earn one penny of that."
She just looked at him like the sun rose and fell with him. "You did!" Then her brow furrowed, getting that strange but familiar crease to it as she added, "But Daddy said,
"Also, I forgot to mention to you before, but you are a hot slice of beefcake, and I should probably watch my back because there are women out there that would sell their souls for the honor of being knocked up by you."
"Yeah! And you assholes got to stuff your faces full of concession stand junk! Incidentally, did
Tony nodded, and together, they maneuvered the gown to allow the baby to rest fully on Tony's skin. Sure he was exposing himself in the process, but right now, he just didn't care — even if Barnes was able to get a full view of the girls. After what Barnes had watched him do, getting a good look at his exposed breasts was a minor infraction.
"Tony, you went to a lot of work—" he tried to explain. "I don't deserve this."
“Fuck you, Steve,” he said and punched Steve’s shoulder. “This was supposed to be a dirty and kinky afternoon, not a sappy one.”
"See?" he asked as he turned back to his daughter. "I'm not completely useless in the kitchen."
Jesus, where the hell would he be next year? If past-him spent the day with Tony and the baby, where did present-him go? Well, if that really had happened to him, he supposed he'd find out then.
He motioned over himself. "Like... I have a responsibility. To be what— To do what— I'm Captain America," he finally finished, lamely, like somehow that was supposed to explain what he couldn't quite figure out to say.
more sympathy wouldn't hurt?"
Natasha took it in hand, gingerly holding it by the edges as she opened the folder to reveal the service portrait of Steve's father. She blinked, her eyebrows raising up to her hairline, before she set curious and amazed eyes on Tony.
"I'm happy."
"You?" Cap asked.
He watched as Steve swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down, and his jaw did that clenching thing it did when he was tensed up and wasn't quite sure how to expel that tension.
a fucking killjoy sometimes.
Bruce sighed out a breath and stood in front of him. "Tony, it's natural. It happens every day. There's nothing to be embarrassed about."
"Shrinks didn't have the best reputation back in his day."
"We do," Barton said.
"Lucky me," he muttered only for Thor to squeeze his shoulder.
Tony hummed and pushed closer to him. "Good, because the only thing going through mine is that I'm yours."
"Like soap and man and pure grit and determination. And freedom."
Steve smiled a little and nodded then asked, "What did you say her name was?"
"Haven't you?" Welch muttered and took another sip of his champagne.
limits the number of places I can go. Besides, I've been dry for, what, a year now? I don't really resent any of you. I'm just being ornery."
07:04.
"You know, I really don't think it's so bad."
Saying 'focused' was better than saying he was prone to being a single-minded pain-in-the-ass, right?
"He didn't get it, did he?"
Natasha stared at him a moment more before her face relaxed just the slightest in reluctant agreement, and she bobbed her head a bit from side-to-side in her halfhearted attempt to admit to Bruce that he was right.
"What's wrong with being a princess?" Barnes asked.
He moistened his lips, tasting the lipstick that was still painted there, and swallowed. "Yes."
"Who should I test them on?"
He never knew if Tony heard him, which was probably for the best as he'd pretty much broken that promise a little over a year later when he'd broken things off with him for good.
"Oh," Steve said and pulled out quickly, and Tony let out a high-pitched cry of desperation. "What did I tell you? You come when I say you come. And you're not allowed to come yet."
them—"
at him— partially haunted but now with an undercurrent of pity, almost as though to remind him of
Steve pursed his lips and shook his head. "I don't understand that. I mean, I guess I understand it in theory, but how do you keep any feelings from forming? Wouldn't they, you know, have a better chance of forming that way?"
"Yeah," he said and then said his 'goodbyes' before he ended the conversation, pressing the little red button on the screen and watching as Pepper's smiling face blinked away.
"Uh, 'cause I can hit a target better than anyone in this room?"
He went to pull his phone out to make a call to…
He folded his arms — sort of in that awkward way where he wasn't exactly comfortable in the situation but was trying to downplay it — and said, "Used to flop in his eyes. Was kind of stingy on the Kreml or whatever it was he used. So, it'd flop all around, get all in disarray. Don't think it was 'til he went in the Army that he finally figured out how to comb his hair the right way. Maybe he was just making enough money that he didn't have to make a bottle of tonic last a year." He shrugged. "Just…weird, I guess."
the cradle-robber in the relationship."
Steve nodded, but Tony felt he was still a bit…put out by Tony's admittedly
"Well, you invited me here. Are we sleeping? Are we fucking? What are we doing here?"
"Yeah," Tony said and rolled his eyes. "Finger quotes are really tough to master."
He yawned again, his body relaxing and his muscles crying out in tired relief. "Sure, old man. Anything you want."
—" Steve started to say with a whine, but Tony just reached down and grabbed the book away from him, and he moved out of Steve's grasp before he even bothered to look at the sketch properly.
going to talk about this ever again."
He swallowed, his stomach doing a flip just as his heart sank down into it, and he put on his most placating and friendly face as he said, "Don't worry about it. It was a joke, right?"
OK. Not how it had happened, of course, which was so heavily outside the scope of consent it was laughable, but the fact that it was now his and all the denials in the world weren't going to turn him back. Not until he'd completed this…mission…for lack of a better word. This
He shook his head and used another fry to soak up some of the juice on his plate. "No, came in by jet. Haven't been downstairs since yesterday."

"Who? That gang of idiots that lives with us?"
He pointed to another reporter.
"The hell's a 'Scooby-Doo'?" Barnes asked, and Steve looked at him and shrugged like he didn't know what they were talking about, either.
Chuckling, Tony nudges his shoulder against Steve and says, “Come on, Rogers. I think we’ve stayed in our little bubble long enough.”
okay.
Before anyone can say anything, they hear Rhodey’s voice come in from the speakers of Pepper’s StarkPhone.
This strikes a chord in Tony. He’s clasping his hands in a tight grip, nails biting into his skin while he listens to the elderly woman talk about her love’s heroics.
His heart swells when Tony’s expression shifts to a surprised, almost fond look. Before Steve can think of something else to say, his brain short-circuits when Tony steps closer to him, only to stand on his tip toes and press a soft kiss on the apple of Steve’s cheek.
I want to help, Clint,” Tony states through gritted teeth. “But I’m not at my 100% capacity right now, and I’d rather not jeopardize Bruce’s work if I make a mistake. Also,” he adds, and Steve doesn’t miss the slight tremor in Tony’s voice. His voice is strangled, heavy with emotion that causes the pressing weight in Steve’s stomach to resurface as the engineer continues. “I have a name —
Tony glances up to meet his eye. He’s got pretty blue eyes, a deep, glasslike blue that seems a little out of place on him, a little too delicate.
“Without my transistors operating at full power to cool the circuits, I’m gonna have a hard time, here," Iron Man admits, discomfort clear in his voice.
It’s a tearjerker. The audience cries.
Steve frowns down at his hands. His left palm still sports a long, deep slash mark, the kind of defensive wound one ends up with after trying to catch knives with bare hands. Bright blue stitches outline the cut, the color insultingly cheery.
“Hand me the robe,” Tony says. “It’s on the chair.”
Steve shakes his hands out and reaches up, setting a hand on Iron Man’s cheek. It’s soft and warm and he can’t believe he’s touching it, that he gets to do this. Iron Man straddles his lap, his muscular thighs on either side of Steve’s hips.
“I wouldn’t mind being alone, either.”
He taps two fingers against his temple and explains the tumor.
“There you are, yeah?” Steve asks, his voice low and loving.
“It won’t work,” he says, playing for time, “Tony will have an alibi. He’s always around people or in his workshop, with with cameras on. Even if he isn’t, his suit keeps track of where he is.”
It’s not an exact science. Many people get dreams, or feelings, or gut instincts,
“If you don’t, who else will?” Asks the soldier already pulling the suit upright to recharge, and in the end, it’s that simple.
“I guess not,” Bucky says, staring down at the scribbled mess on his hand. After a moment, he pulls the bright blue sleeve of his little coat over it. His eyes water, and he blinks hard, drops clinging to his eyelashes.
Steve settles, tracking Amora and Tony as they go their separate ways. Tony’s small talk is manufactured, predictable. Amora always seems surrounded by a cluster of people, her melodic laugh occasionally piercing through the crowd. Steve wonders what her end goal is — can it be as simple as luring Thor in, revealing his human identity? Has she not been able to guess where she could find him in the vast city he’s been calling home, choosing to search for the prince among the wealthy and powerful?
Two days later, the Bruce Banner injects himself with the serum and the Hulk tears apart Manhattan. For as long as Tony had known a day like this was coming, that, eventually, the Ultimates would be deployed against real threats, he doesn’t know that he can do it before he does it. Days after the attack, he can still feel the places where the Hulk’s fingers had dug into the sides of his head.
He stands, picks up the chair, sets it against the wall, and disappears alone into the bathroom.
Steve had rolled his eyes. Tony remembered as much. Steve had rolled his eyes, fond, and probably commented on the low effort pun. Tony’s hand had stayed on his chest, of course, and Steve had only drifted closer. And then, naturally enough, they were kissing.
Because he likes her, he makes a show of stumbling. She laughs, rolls her eyes, takes him to lunch. He likes her. He wants to know who she is outside of the costumed, size-shifting hero he’d met, wants to know if she’s got a family she’s coming home to, if she works somewhere. The degree of separation that her secret identity imposes between them isn’t extreme, but it’s tangible, always there. He knows there are things he can’t ask her.
“Well,” Future-Steve said, “that’s a pleasant surprise. Shall we?”
“Let him get dressed,” Tony intervenes, swiping the belt out of Jan’s hands to toss to Steve, “let’s get this show on the road. Drinks, Jarvis?”
Tony can see his fingers go white where he’s gripping the sutures, and he can’t take it; he reaches over and takes Steve by the hand, physically pulling it away from the wound.
“It must have been— I don’t even know what,” Tony said, shaking his head. “He told me everything I wanted to hear. Promised me everything I wanted to have.”
Rogers is out of his territory and it’s awfully clear. He’s not stupid; he smiles where he should smile, nods where he should nod, shakes hands and gives answers that’ll generate mostly positive press, but Tony sees the lines of tension in his back, the way his eyes keep returning to every exit of the room. He’d been in the war only weeks ago, as far as his memory can tell him.
He hiccups, again, loud. He could stop talking here, let Steve assume he was talking about the show.
Of course, he’d met vets like that before, kids who’d joined the army at eighteen and come home having lived too much for twenty-three, but he can’t make the mold fit around Captain America, who seems to radiate self-confidence and experience, whose image and name had been used to convey strength and power for decades. It’d be like feeling older than George Washington or Abe Lincoln.
“Yeah,” Steve said, realizing he couldn’t be so selfish, couldn’t keep Tony from this. “Yeah, of course. When are you going?”
July 20th, 1969.
That seems too easy.
He pauses. His turn to mince words; he’s not used to talking about his feelings.
“You’re my friend,” he says, “I
“Oh.” Tony says, mildly. He supposes he shouldn’t be surprised; she’d gone from cheating with Steve to cheating on Steve, and that’s natural enough, isn’t it?
One way to get blood rushing back into his arm, he supposes.
He tracks Tony’s drift towards her, always close without ever stepping into the light. There Tony is, moving on from the bald man to strike up conversation with a short stylish brunette with a teacup chihuahua in a little purse. There he is, the next moment, gesturing with a glass of some sparkling drink by two identical young men with long, horse-like faces and pale eyes. And then, quite suddenly, he’s in the circle of admirers around the sorceress, one hand out to introduce himself.
century politeness really breaks, and realizes he’ll have to call off the arrangements. He’s not cashing it in then.
“Easy, fella,” Steve tells him, as Thor steps in front of them, hammer at the ready, “you’re okay now. We had a hunch you’d be needing us.”
“But I understand if you’re not, er, willing to do that, right now.” Steve finishes.
he’d said, smiling down at it, and Tony, who remembered his spartan apartment, had laughed and told him he’d believe it when he saw it. He’d promised he would find it a frame, had promised he’d make Tony a copy to keep — a physical one — but he’d let the picture end up in the bottom of the box, unframed and un-copied, and then he’d gone and died.
“I think,” Tony gestures with the book as he speaks, “that you’ll hate it enough you won’t want to lie to me about it.”
He turns back to the imposter. Already, he can feel the magic lessen, give.
This should give him a feeling of power, but instead it only makes him feel like he’s overreacting. Anxiety, harsh and roiling, boils under his skin.
Steve’s breath catches. The chair creaks, and suddenly, they’re tipping over and falling sideways. Tony catches himself on his elbows. Steve, still bound, doesn’t. Tony grimaces as his temple smacks against the floor.
Tony’s surprised. It’s not as though this had never occurred to him; he’d switched roles plenty of time in the safety of his head. From the beginning of this, though, it’s been Steve on top, Steve pushing and Tony giving. He hadn’t thought this was on the table.
“Here, darling,” he says, passing him the lube bottle, “you know what to do.”
He fetches his phone and texts Steve. It’s already past breakfast time — eleven thirty-four in the morning — so, deciding lunch is the logical next step, he’s direct, to the point: “Eddie’s, 12:15.” Steve texts back with the thumbs up emoji. Tony’s not sure where, exactly, he’d learned that one.
He stops struggling against the chains, saving his energy. Tony knows his strengths and limits better, perhaps, than anyone on earth.
“Oh, very much the genuine article, Tony.” Thor sounds pleased to have been asked, happy to explain, “I am God made man.”
He’d planned to spend what little time he had left with her.
Both of them are hiding wounds.
Steve’s fingers graze lightly over his arm, but he catches himself, draws back. “I’m going to have Jarvis call your doctor.”
Part of him feels like this is a dream. He’s had dreams like this.
Mistrustful, he gives them nothing. His hand tingles. He’s lost the glove. He stares at the ink on his skin, which blurs and fades rapidly, dissipating. It doesn’t strike him as anything but exposure to air killing something that should have been dead a long time ago.
“I know,” Steve started cautiously, “That you don’t spend as much time with the team as, er, the rest of us, but— we’re all very grateful to you. You spend so much time on our suits, on our technology. You opened your home to us, to— to me. I didn’t have anywhere to go.”
“Seems like that’s your default.”
Tony was silent, his fork clinking against his plate.
This, to Tony Stark, should feel at best trite and at worst mind numbingly boring. Steve had bored Janet, for God’s sake, and Tony is known for having a new girl in his bed every night. Instead, he feels a tiny thrill of belonging, snug as Steve’s arm around his shoulders. Steve is a man he rarely feels the need to impress, a man about as disinterested in the monetary upsides of dating a billionaire as humanly possible, a man who’s seen Tony at both his worst and his best. He’s reliable, constant, in a world that’s anything but.
Steve catches him one off guard one Friday night. It’s a rare weekend that neither of them have commitments. Tony is on his bed, replying to the emails he knows can’t wait until Monday, and Steve sits stretched out on the floor in front of the bed. He’d been doing push-ups, but, bored, given up somewhere around two hundred.
"Oh, don't even try to pretend you don't like it, you big faker."
Steve continued to chuckle as he looked down at the baby. "Your mommy doesn't meant that, doll baby."
Tony just flattened his mouth. "He was Brucie's
But Steve, that beautiful idiot, just shrugged and said, "We could wear disguises."
Barton rolled his eyes. "In what? A blue van called 'The Mystery Machine'?"
Steve said nothing, instead preferring to stab a couple pieces of General Tso's Chicken with his fork, and Tony sighed a little.
during their fucking
Tony thought about this a moment then shook his head. "Yeah, not seeing it. Steve doesn't look at me any differently than he looks at anyone else."
Steve picked his head back up, and he put his mouth by Tony's ear and whispered, "I love you no matter what form you're in, but I'm always going to have a weakness for the man I fell in love with, wrinkles and gray hair and hard muscles and all."
"You haven't walked in on us," he replied with a wicked grin. "Barton, the son-of-a-bitch, walked in. Deserved whatever nightmares he got from it, too."
glad she was recording it — and Pepper latched a firm hand on his arm and said acidly, "That's
"About this? You haven't been feeling the best lately."
"Esmeralda, this is cruel," Thor said, but she shook her head.
He then weaved Tony around the other tables of guests, sidestepping the servers as they made their way out to the corridor and eventually to the elevator bank. Not one other soul was waiting for an elevator when they arrived, and Steve reached out and hit the 'up' button then stood back a step to wait, and Tony glanced up at him and said, "What is this?"
"Have you been tested recently?"
that." He motioned to the book. "Pick one out of there. We probably won't even have to use it, but just in case."
about this, Tony. Actually
"So, they're
"Don't suddenly turn modest on me now," Tony said as he stood away from the desk and held his arms out so JARVIS could get a good read on his body. "I need you to take a look-see and see if you find anything funny."
"Good, very good," she said when she was finished, and Tony sat right back up.
bring up Iron Man!" she shouted and pointed at him as he opened his mouth to say just that. "Yes, I know you're Iron Man, but you know there's rumors around about how the suit can operate itself with no one inside it—"
To put it simply, Steve is the one Tony feels most comfortable around. Steve is the only one who will venture into the workshop for long periods of time, just enjoying the relative silence of Tony tinkering with the armor or new upgrades for various projects and sketching or reading. He is also usually the one to drag Tony to “family dinners”, or if they aren’t eating together, will bring him food to the workshop or drag him out to some new place he just has to try. Tony can’t pinpoint the exact moment he and Steve started dating, but he knows he won’t ever forget their first kiss.
Stane is focusing not on the trackers, but on another screen on display, charting patent expiration dates and stock prices. She tries to read the list he’s making, but he moves in front of it before she can get a good look. She ducks her head in case he chances a look back at her, the absolute picture of subservience.
Steve’s long eyelashes flutter, like he’s waking up from an afternoon nap rather than blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Tony’s heart clenches at how beautiful he is, even in the black trappings of a killer.
But he tries. God, does he try. At some point, it stops being about the fact that she said no. It starts being more of an honest question after Afghanistan. After he was locked in a cave and had to fight his way out. After Rhodey called him and basically told him to grow the fuck up (and wow, he thought nothing could hurt as much as literally having his chest ripped open, but that came pretty close). After it turned out Obie (who thought Tony was valuable, even if he never liked him) was using him for the only thing keeping him alive.
about it, something he feels deep in his bones, and it’s not easy or without its difficulties, but he knows he’s not going to give up on Tony, even if he was grown in a lab at Stark Industries. There’s a name for this thing he’s feeling, but he is absolutely not going there, no matter how many sideways looks Bucky throws at him when he comes back from seeing Tony, flushed and happy.
“Best terrible idea I’ve ever had.” There’s nothing that can stop Tony from kissing that shitty little grin off Steve’s stupidly beautiful face.
“It’s not something that’s come up officially yet, but it’s not far off.” Phil steps towards him and his hands twitch as if they want to reach out, but they clench into fists at his side. “You have to understand, they can’t let you go. Any of you. You all have too much information, too much influence.”
He has to get up. He has to get back to the mark, or at the very least down to the bunkroom so that he can tell someone, and they can finish the job for him.
, please-“
The man leans closer and whispers, “Are your friends ninjas?”
“Thanks, J.” Tony settles back and closes his eyes.
“Yeah. Yes, I’m – I’m fine, sorry.” He swipes at his eyes and tries something like a smile.
“Honestly, I think I liked it better when they thought I was dead.”
“Yeah, a full ride. A kid a year from a low income home will get to go to college for free. I know you didn’t exactly as for it, but I thought it was a good idea, you always talked about how he would have wanted to go to college if it hadn’t been, you know, the Depression. And this way, he will always be remembered by the people he helped. And I know you don’t like me spending money on you, but I thought this might be an exception. You can raise money for it, if you want, but if not it’ll be fully funded through Stark Industries.” Steve was still staring at him, and he honestly couldn’t identify the emotion on his face. “Um, Steve? Can you tell me if this is ok? I can’t tell if I fucked up or not. I did it to make you less sad. If it makes you upset, or if it was presumptuous or something I can undo it. Or, I think I can. Pepper can, anyway.”
“Dammit, there’s always something. Well, I’m sorry for assuming you’re anything but a god-fearing, temperance-supporting puritan Mister…”
“What?”
“I wouldn’t have had to if you weren’t wasting time, Phil.” Pepper clicks the safety back on the gun and places it on the desk, smoothing her hair back behind her ear. “After the scene downstairs, he clearly wasn’t holding back. Every second you wasted meant more people in danger, and honestly, I’m not impressed by your initiative.”
Let me know what you think?
“Yeah, sure. Just let me–“ He inputs some commands on the screen he’d been working on before Pepper called, sets up the dummy software to run while he’s gone.
They say it’s why he disappeared mere months after his father’s death. They say it’s because he’s more machine than man, now. His body couldn’t keep up with his mind, and he outgrew all the prosthetics they made to keep him together. They say that’s why he hasn’t been seen in public in years. Others say he’s dead, and that’s why Obadiah took over. Some say Obadiah had him killed, or that he’s been locked in the bowels of Stark Industries forced to create for endless profit.
“That’s what we want to talk to you about.” Natasha steps out from behind Bucky, and Steve is
“No, Pep, I know. Believe me, I am very aware of what Obie wants. And I’m going as fast as I can, it’s just going to take time–“
“Don’t let Coulson hear you talking like that. The point is, it’s been a wild day and you’re here pouting with us, not talking things out with him. Why not?”
Tony takes his phone out of his pocket and throws it back towards the elevator door.
“So, using brand new technology based on recent breakthroughs in bio-tech integration, we’re going to get people the organs and treatment they need, for free. We’re going to subsidize it by selling clean arc reactor technology, creating a world we all will want to live in. It’s not going to be easy, but it’s going to work.”
Steve is ripped back to the present by Tony’s worried voice, crouching a few feet in front of him, hands up to show he’s not a threat. Steve blinks and Tony shuffles a little closer, sitting crosslegged in front of where Steve is curled with his knees to his chest.
Bucky steps out from an alcove with Natasha right behind him, with the most serious expression Steve’s ever seen on his face. “Hey, Stevie. Can we talk to you for a sec?”
Natasha would never do anything so obvious as shift her weight guiltily, but her face goes slightly more blank, and she takes a step back before nodding. Bucky punches Steve in the shoulder (with his flesh and blood arm, so Steve knows he isn’t mad) and says, “Fine, pal. It’s your funeral.”
“Quick job.” Steve pulls off his helmet and tosses it in his locker, stripping off the rest of his equipment and armored suit as he goes. Once he’s down to his undershirt, he goes over to the sink to splash his face with water, scrubbing his face with his hands. “And a good thing, too. I’m beat, and we’ve gotta be in the office in less than twelve hours.”
“Please, no, I’ll give you anything,
Steve skids to a stop just inside the doors, four vaguely familiar people behind him, slightly blurry but he thinks he can make out Pepper’s favorite assistant, as well as another high up suit he sometimes sees in Legal.
“No, of course not.” Steve sits back down in front of Tony and takes one of his hands gently. “I wouldn’t have gotten near him if I had known. None of us would have. For what it’s worth, we’ve been looking for a way out for years. Coulson too; he was the first person who really cared about any of us. You’ve been the second. And I know I’ve said it already, but Tony, I’m so sorry about what happened to Yinsen. I know he meant a lot to you.”
going to give them shit for lurking about together in abandoned hallways. She crosses her arms and looks sternly at Steve. “You and Tony have become quite close recently. We just want to make sure you’re being safe.”
The man himself emerges from the innards of one of his robots and looks briefly confused but his face clears, and his bright smile pulls an answering one from Steve. “Steve! Hi, I forgot you were coming up.”
He wasn't, really, but Steve didn't have to know that. OK, well, he
Tony carried her upstairs and into his bedroom. He dropped her onto the bed, and she bounced around a little and tried to get comfortable, but Tony frowned at her ensemble and said, "You can't sleep in that again."
"Uh, we could have taken the limo with the others if you didn't have to make like the ninety-year- old that you are and sit there and polish your shoes for half-an-hour."
"That'll never happen," Barton said as he pushed in between where Natasha and Bruce stood. Thor brought up the rear and dropped the Iron Man suit with a loud thunk before he met up with the rest of them. "See?" Barton crowed. "Told you he wasn't dead."
," Bucky amended. "Grow up, Wilson."
Just how old was that fellow, anyway?
"Mmm… I know," he said and smiled lazily at him then went up on his toes to nuzzle at Steve's jaw. He hummed again and said, "Need a shave, old man."
"My what?"
He'd blocked that dream from his memory — a stupid, confusing dream he'd had one Christmas Eve that had made no sense whatsoever. It was a fantasy, as it turned out, his inner-most desires coming to life in the form of a wonderful and picturesque dreamscape.
been until he'd started to think about running his mouth all over Steve's—
Steve laughed. "I think it is."
. 'Rogers-Starks' sounds better than that other way."
He could have heard a pin drop the way all the others literally stopped in mid-motion to look at him, surprise and confusion written over their faces. All except for Steve, of course, who stood smiling by the coffeemaker, Olivia in one arm and a bottle in the other hand. Steve ducked his head and decided to focus on feeding the infant while the rest of the team gawked at Tony, and it was Barnes, of all people, that broke the silence by turning to Wilson and saying, "Wasn't he just a woman?"
"Hey!" Steve said, his face going serious. "I won't have you talking about the mother of my child that way."
Bruce just sighed and said, "I can't believe we're having this conversation."
He clicked off the call and shook his head before he tossed his phone onto the table and looked at Tony. "Are they our teammates, or are they our children?"
The cool air of the workshop was beginning to feel a bit drafty on his slick-covered cock, and he looked around for something to clean off with, ultimately deciding he'd have to get off the table and seek out a clean towel or something somewhere.
Tony just 'humphed' a little as he tried to get the bottom of the gown situated so that it would cover him. OK, yeah, sure, he'd had his share of sexcapades, some of which had even been caught on camera, but somehow that was…different. That was his own choice, and yeah, OK, looking back maybe he wasn't
"OK," he said when he was once again able to form a coherent thought. "Again, talking about this later."
"Yeah," Tony said and balled up the scraps of dough that weren't enough to get one last cookie out of. "Weird. Like with the wrapping paper."
He swallowed. "Yes, sir," he said just barely above a whisper.
"He's not a spy," Bucky said. "He just wants everyone to
The best.
"Yeah, I saw it before I left this morning. Did you put that on there?"
"A licensed medical professional. I'm not a surgeon, Tony."
, Bucky had said.
He motioned to his abdomen. "Your child. It's b
I wouldn't do to get you back," he said, his blue gaze burning into Tony's, their eyes doing a dance together as Steve attempted to drive home the gravity of his words. Tony held his gaze a moment longer then twitched a small smile at him.
"What in the world is a 'selfie'?"
"It's not unreasonable," Steve cut in. "It's very reasonable." And then he sighed and frowned a little at Tony. "Look, I'm not saying
But he just hummed a little, reaching up to pull the bastard's hands away, and said, "Well, you get what you pay for. And clearly, I shelled out the
"And yet, you just happened to be trolling the internet looking for someone to sell them to at the exact time I was looking to buy them?"
Steve talked constantly that entire afternoon, almost like he was afraid if he allowed there to be any moment of silence that Barnes would take that as his cue and would pack up and leave, voluntarily walking away from Steve one more time.
"Why does it sound like something Stark would have written for a ninth-grade history project— And yes, I know you were, like, seven in ninth grade. I meant ninth grade for normal people."
"And Merry Christmas to you, too," he cooed at her and smiled as she gurgled and pressed her face into his shoulder. "God, you're a cute one," he said and turned to Tony. "So, I'd say a 'little birdie,' but it more like a loud, obnoxious goose said you guys chose Pep and Happy to be her guardian in the event that you two, uh, you know..."
"You're right. And if what you're telling me is true, then it sounds like it might have already
"You, uh, you get your results?" he asked, deciding that it would be better to work up to the making love rather than just grabbing Tony and slamming him down on the nearest flat surface like a goddamned caveman. Much as the latter was a very appealing prospect to him at the moment.
Tony shot her an unimpressed look. "You know what I mean," he said then motioned pointedly over his chest area.
Steve bit his lips to keep from snorting out a laugh as Stark remembered that he was supposed to be fighting what Steve was doing.
Again, it didn't hurt; it was just…weird.
blame himself for it. But he thinks he's done right by you, or is
He sighed and rolled his eyes and said, "It's not her."
to wear one of your suits?" Natasha asked, like she knew something Tony had yet to accept for himself.
He was going to have to see about getting her new clothes in the morning. "There we go. Hey, do you need to brush your teeth?"
"It's not because
"Hey," he said, and there was concern and a little bit of anger on his face, "you know that, right?"
"Some would say you deserved more."
Steve just glared at him —
"No, I poured it in a glass," Steve muttered as he beat up a dozen eggs in a mixing bowl.
"Should know exactly what kind of pervert you are." He made a couple more disgusted sounds then said, "I'm going to get you back for that. You know that, right?"
"That was one of her issues— Well, outside of me being just the absolute worst boyfriend in the world—"
"Do you have a name for her?"
, why should I go to some quack that couldn't even begin to understand the predicament I'm in—"
"Was it bad?"
It wasn't long after that that they were chowing down on appetizers and salads, Tony shoving food down his gullet because he was hungrier than he thought he'd ever been, and when the actual entrée arrived, he wolfed that down in record time as well — though he blamed that more on the pathetically small portion rather than his own insatiable appetite.
"Dear god, I hope not!"
. You're telling it to your child that just so happens to be inside your stomach at the moment."
," Other Tony said, groaning her name out with a hint of a whine.
convenient. So easy to carry so much with! Why didn't men carry bags? Maybe he should look into changing that after everything went back to the way it had been?)
Without thinking, he let his hand slip down to his belly, and he brushed his fingertips over the swell.
" and he had JARVIS switch him back to a private line.
"But she's having fun. Isn't that the most important part?"
Barnes just nodded at Steve's suggestion, and Steve tightened his arms around Tony, giddy, like a child hugging a stuffed animal that had just been told Santa was coming that very night.
He shook his head, and Tony nodded a little and pulled his jacket tighter as the bus pulled away, splashing some water from the curb up in their direction.
"You think maybe it's some sort of extortion scheme from one of your conquests over the years?" Rhodey called out to him. He whirled around and made a sour face at him.
Rhodey snorted a laugh, and Pepper shook her head, and while Barton put his hands up like he was not touching that with a ten-foot pole, Natasha stepped into the conversation and said, "You do realize you just called your husband an idiot."
Tony sighed and rolled his eyes. "
decide if you're too for me? I mean, trust me, you're not, but seriously, my decision. And look, we have a lot in common. We like to do a lot of things together—"
~*Back to the Alps, December 1944*~
He completely bypassed terrestrial radio and instead went for satellite, flipping through stations for something neutral to leave on. He hit upon some '70s station and was just about to turn it off when Steve said, "No! Wait!" and put a hand out to stop him from changing it.
," the ever-helpful Steve chimed in from his spot on the floor.
"Yeah," Steve said and took him by the shoulders, "but we're here now, right? And that's what counts."
Steve shrugged. "That's OK," he said and settled into one of the chairs, Olivia balanced in the crook of his arm as he set about feeding her the bottle, her small hands slapped against either side of the bottle as she helped to hold it.
a little upset about then — because I didn't…because so far as I knew there was nothing other than that that I could ever expect or hope for."
, Tony, male or female. I love your mind and your heart and your sense of humor and your intelligence and the way you yell at me for drinking orange juice straight from the carton or because I'm too lazy to load a dishwasher. I love the way you made the future not so scary for me when it could have been overwhelming, how you taught me how to dance, how you insist I cheat at poker even though you say I can't lie for shit because no one's that lucky at cards. None of that is dependent on the body you're in. That's who you are. That's what I'm attracted to. That's who I'm in love with. The body's just a perk, whether it's hard lines and a cock or supple curves and a clit. As long as I have you, that's all that matters."
" she asked, and there was an echo to her words like she was in an enclosed space like a garage.
Once Tony was able to finish getting her dressed (and then the coat and the mittens — she was a tough cookie, that was for sure), they piled into the already-warmed up car — "Remote starter," Tony had explained, whatever that was — and began the drive to the restaurant. Whichever radio station Tony had tuned in was still playing Christmas songs — again, he supposed he'd call it 'music' — and as they drove down the darkened road illuminated by sort of amber-colored streetlamps (and didn't those look…kind of odd), Steve noted the preponderance of bright and colorful lights strung on trees and around the porches and eaves of houses along the way. Only one house had anything remotely like the (expensive) Christmas lights he was accustomed to — those large, soft-colored bulbs. Most of them looked like they must have been those LED lights Tony had talked about or perhaps those tiny incandescents he'd also mentioned. Set against the snow, it made for a pretty and festive picture, and Steve again tamped down that horrible guilty feeling that said he should not be in any way enjoying himself. He should be back at the front. He should be fighting. He should be mourning the ones that were lost. He should not be sitting in a warm, state-of-the-art car and dressed in clothes that quite clearly cost more than he'd ever made in his entire life, anticipating a dinner of Chinese food with a fella that was practically his deepest, darkest fantasy come to life and a little girl this dark fantasy claimed was their child.
"Yeah, but I don't—"
The man opened and closed his mouth a couple times, blinking, like he wasn't even sure what to say, and Tony took a sip of his vanilla chai — ugh, tolerable but he could have gone for an extra-large Americano right about now, and he wasn't talking about one that answered to 'Captain' — then set the cup down and said, "I believe you have some pictures for me."
"Hmm?" Tony said and looked up from the cellphone.
He hadn't.
Steve nodded, and he reached down and carefully and gently scooped the baby up and cradled her against his chest, rocking her ever so gently like he was trying to stave off waking her up, and he nodded his head at the couch. Tony sighed out a breath and sank down onto the cushions as Steve crouched and set Olivia in her little carrier to let her take the rest of her nap there, and he kissed her forehead then leaned over and kissed Tony and said, "I'm gonna go check in with the others, and then I'll see about finding something for dinner."
He swallowed, his breath hitching in his raw and abused throat, the leather of the collar pressing into his neck. "Ye—
"Huh?"
," Steve muttered from behind him, a slight tinge of horror lacing his voice. Tony thought the verbiage fit, but the sentiment was completely off. Steve, clearly, was slightly nervous about what Tony might say. Tony, on the other hand, couldn't believe he was wasting a weekend here when he could have been doing something
Barnes stared down at her, awed, humbled, maybe even a little proud. He met her eyes and said, "So, you're Steve's kid, huh? Yeah, you look it. Got that same stubborn look on your face." He sighed heavily. "I'm gonna have to pull your ass out of the fire, too, won't I?"
"Good," Steve said and then began to work at a slow, gentle thrust, the plug in his ass hitting his walls with each and every hit, doubling the desperate, yearning need thrumming through him. "Oh, don't be like that," he said at Tony's despairing whine, his fingers trailing over Tony's abdomen, sending quivers of want down his spine and straight to his clit that was desperate for attention. "You want to know why? Because you like this. Because you like the control I have over you. Because you like that only I can do this to you. And you know what? I like that, too. Only I get to do this. Only I get to see this. This is for me and only for me. Because you're mine. You're my Antonia Natasha. No one else gets you like this, not now or ever. This is mine. This is only for me. You're like this only for me. You give yourself this way only to me. I've already marked you. This, right here?"
"Oh, no, don't pretend you're better than we are!" Sam said, his gaze focused on Jim even as he pulled Olivia out of the way of Bucky's grasp.
She leveled him with one of her unimpressed looks, which weren't nearly as amusing or guilt-inducing as Steve's were wont to be.
"Yeah, fine, you little brat," he muttered and went into the bathroom. "I'll get you something to eat."
Tony looked up from the book. He frowned a little and then closed up the comic and set it aside. "Well, if you want to count the other Avengers as your family—"
Bruce straightened up and folded his arms some, sighing out a breath. "It's… It's messy," he said like he wasn't quite sure how to describe it. "And it's painful."
He was just starting to get into the teasing nips and grunts when Steve's phone began to ring, that obnoxious tune from that '60s 'Captain America' cartoon that he'd watched as a kid blaring into the previous silence of the room. Steve groaned into his neck but still pulled away to glance over to the table to check to see who or what it was.
He shrugged as he moved closer. "Five years of lessons will do that to a kid." He stopped right in front of him. "So, really, the only thing you actually have to worry about are the slow dances you get stuck with at those benefits where you have to make nice with the dowagers and the princesses and basically anyone that has any influence in the powers that be that might support your cause.
Barnes hesitated then said, "
" and pulled him along.
"There it is," Barton said and motioned to her. "That just leaves our little mother-to-be out in the dark." He frowned. "Wait, is 'mother' the right term?"
," she said, stressing the word like she was displeased with him interrupting her, "it's kind of convenient that only Iron Man's been seen since January, and not one of the Avengers has come out and said clearly and definitively just
know the answers to any of that.
"Yeah, you are," he said and set the tablet back on his lap. "You know, the suggestions really aren't half-bad."
"Hmm…" he said, watching as Steve pulled them from their velvet encasing. "Going all-out tonight, are we?"
He bowed his head and kissed Steve again, searing, hot, and he leaned his weight into Steve and pushed him back against the bed.
"You're grounded, Tony. From this point on."
He was about to go for the stairs when some noise from the room across the hall caught his ear, and certain he wasn't about to be caught by the odd fellow in the other room, he tiptoed over and pushed the already-ajar door open just a fraction more. He didn't know what he'd expected, but he hadn't expected what looked to be a child's nursery. He pushed the door more fully open and took in the sight of soft pastel colors and stuffed animals and white-painted furniture. There was a crib against one wall and a very young child standing inside it, hands with a tight grip on the railing.
"Oh," he said and carefully ran his hands from his breasts down and over his belly. "What do you think? Is it OK?"
There were some candles mixed in as well — Tony had wanted to go with ninety-six, which was Steve's real age, but he couldn't very well fit ninety-six candles
Tony groaned and buried his face in his hands. Fuck, he'd forgotten Pepper was still in town. "Great," he muttered and pulled back. "Great. Sure, why not. Maybe she knows how to deal with this?"
"What? I really mean it. None of this sappy 'I wub wu' bullshit. I really mean it when I say please, for the love of god, go to sleep already."
Tony made a sour face at him. "Well, when you put it like that…"
Steve shrugged some, pulling his hands back and leaving the photo out in the open. "Feeling it move around inside you kinda makes it real, too."
"Language, Tony."
Steve sighed. "Tony, the language—"
look so delectable, I could eat you with a spoon, and I want to show you off to everyone there, so, no, we'll go — at least for a little while."
He turned to her. "
that he would have even given me the time of day about it, but…"
"Yeah."
"He never hated you, Tony. That's my point. There was something about you from the start. Something about you that got under his skin. Something he couldn't shake." She smiled a little, coy and bemused. "I don't think he realized what it really was at the time, but looking back, he could probably admit it to himself now."
Tony Stark? You're
"Are you asking if I actually gave birth to your child?"
"You're a sexist son-of-a-bitch, you know that? I never realized that about you before. You're a sexist son-of-a-bitch." He let out a bitter laugh and swiped at a few screens. "I mean, you're from the Stone Age, so I guess I can't hold it against you too much—"
With an annoyed sniffle — fuck it,
"Oh, yeah," Wilson said and scoffed, "
"Papa!" she cried and took off down the steps, Bruce a few steps behind her. Jeez, she was fast! "Papa!"
"Steve," he said, his gaze never leaving the murder's haggard face, "pull over."
"Did you listen to Daddy?"
But what if he was?
"Your 'gramps' isn't 'Steve Edwards' or whatever name you gave. It's 'Steve Rogers.' I haven't figured out yet how that's possible, but at the beginning of the year, I had a dick, and now I don't, so—"
Tony bit his lips. Fuck, if he wasn't allowed to moan—
He watched as Steve closed his eyes and took a deep breath that he let out through his nose, and he opened his eyes again and shot a look at Tony and said, "Don't do that."
, 9:14 AM
He’s of the generation, Tony thinks, when men touched each other more freely. This, sitting on the couch with him, isn’t strange to Steve. They’re friends. Coworkers. Brothers in arms. Comrades — this word, now, makes him think of Natasha. It’s not even Russian, associated with the country through nothing but American propaganda, stereotyped Cold War era film, but she had liked it. Used it.
And yet—
“Not you.” She says, in the tone of a housewife shooing raccoons out of her garden, and darts out one hand, palm out. As soon as she touches Tony’s chest, he freezes, his hand still halfway to his pocket, his eyes wide open and unseeing.
“I was a spy,” Rogers says, but something inside him seems to compel him to add, “well, kind of,” which makes Tony’s point better than Tony ever could.
But it had only been another day to Steve, another job. Rationally, he knows Steve is probably unbothered, willing to blow off steam.
“You overthink,” he says, “you’ve just got to do things.”
“Noooo,” Janet says, whiny, “no, you strip. That’s the rule.”
Steve plops a French fry into his mouth and washes it down with more Coke.
“No, no,” Steve carefully removes the glass from the top of the helmet’s display case and pulls it out, examining it casually, none too shy about just
He picks a shrimp up on his way to over to Rogers, rolling the skewer between thumb and index finger. Cap doesn’t need to be told to pay attention; his eyes are immediately on Tony, assessing. Sauce dribbles down the shrimp’s segmented, insectoid body, pools around the edges of Tony’s fingernail.
Giant-Man just shrugs in response.
He’s not on the Avengers anymore. He’s not Cap. He’s Commander Rogers, charged with taking care of a country he barely understands anymore. And, now, by the invitation of his once-best-friend, once-worst-enemy, he’s on the Illuminati.
“Oh,” Tony said, “sure, yes. W— Cap, would you mind?”
For a moment, the man in front of him is solid again. Tony Stark stands in front of him, well put together and calm, his black suit ironed, hair smoothed back. He takes a step forward, looks at his bound counterpart, and then vanishes into thin air.
probably meant something more vague back in Steve’s day, Tony thinks. He’d probably missed Tony’s attempt to provoke entirely. It’s just as well, really; not one of his best. Still, he can’t quite get the interaction out of his head as he trudges upstairs to shower, — privately, thank you very much, a big improvement from SHIELD’s facilities— can’t stop himself from imagining a world of horrible misunderstandings in which he had, somehow, really meant “date.”
Well, it’s only natural to be drawn to strength, to perfection. Cap is objectively gorgeous. Cap embodies the unrealistic standard of male beauty he’d grown up with, the perfect specimen. The skin-tight clothing had never helped, either; anyone, straight or otherwise, would look. Can he, a man who’d so often failed to measure up, a man whose own body is killing him, be blamed for his desire for this perfection?
For a moment, every sensation is too much. His shirt collar, starched, is pressing against his neck. He can still feel vodka and tomato juice, the taste warped unpleasantly by the time, on his tongue. The crick in his back will be a full blown ache by tomorrow. His head hurts.
And then he realizes that it’s only Jarvis. He needs to play it cool — if Jarvis sees the gun, she’s going to kill him. She’s not taking any risks.
Will Steve understand?
Steve nods, one short, quick motion.
By now, the fact that Cap likes him is old news. The paparazzi have caught them together — sometimes with girlfriends, sometimes without — at various diners, sporting events (what’s Tony supposed to do, here, when the guy likes baseball so much), and the like. People ask him all the time to finagle Cap into product sponsorships or charity events or photo ops, and Tony doesn’t, because he’d rather Cap keep liking him.
Bucky gasps, a long inhale. His eyes are wide with shock; the rejection, Steve is sure, stings.
“What happened with Jan?” He asks.
“Already?” For a moment, Steve hoped his counterpart had been lying, that this was some kind of diversion, but a portal was opening, slowly, in the middle of the workshop, glowing light blue and pulsing. Steve could see nothing beyond the swirling rectangular void.
It seems to work. She’s coaxed into the mundanity she must have picked up in the human world.
“Well, he’s gotta have someone,” Doris points out, “my mama told me.”
He’s certainly not going to do sixty of them.
Steve walked him into the elevator, pressing the button for the top floor.
Tony glances over at him, surprised, but Steve can’t look at him.
“Guess you would,” he grinds out, “wouldn’t you.”
It’s not going to be the same, really, parading him around now. This isn’t about social status — it’s entirely for Tony’s benefit.
Steve looks back to Tony, who’s still watching helplessly, his hands tied behind his back, ankles fastened to the chair.
Thor is gone more often, wandering wherever he goes when he’s off-world. He seems a little happier, a little more satisfied, like he’s earned his place in his homeworld pantheon.
Tony’s hand slips sleepily down Steve’s side and onto his lap, resting just over his groin. Steve hums and turns to look at him, having misread the gesture.
He thinks Tony would wave his concerns off if he wasn’t tied up. As it stands, he gives a dismissive little shake of the head. “It’s fine. We’re okay.”
“The, uh, the glowing red sword,” Tony clarifies, wondering how he’d expected Steve to get that one. He’d never known the guy not to fall asleep in the first five minutes of an action movie.
if you're noticing the updated rating and sexy tags -- they're not for this chapter! but soon.
“It was safe,” he says, “to love Iron Man. I could never touch him, could never really meet him. No one could blame me for entertaining the fantasy that it was circumstances keeping us apart, that he would have returned my feelings if he could.”
Steve hums in his response, slightly choked but almost amused, a vague, self-satisfied kind of permission.
Steve crosses the room, and, slowly, lowers himself to sit on the edge of Tony’s cot. The smell of his aftershave — mint and eucalyptus, Tony guesses— mingles pleasantly with the smell of flowers.
He’s excited. The fingerprint must amount to something. It must have been given to him for a reason, and he feels, finally, like he’s about to get it.
Tony keeps thrusting, not bothering to count the time in his head. He tries to pull back when he’s about to come, but Steve catches him by the thigh and holds him in place. He gags, slightly, as he swallows. It’s messy. Dribbles of white roll down Steve’s chisel-cut jaw, his blue eyes dark with arousal and oxygen deprivation. The imprint of Tony’s sweaty hand is still visible in his short hair, bedhead messy. He’s breathing heavy, warm breaths against Tony’s thigh.
He can’t let himself even think about this right now, not with her eyes on him.
It’s a beautiful church, the same one he assumed he’d marry in. Light filters in through the open stained glass windows. Bird sing outside. It’s a bright, sunny day. He’s bought a bouquet of roses, Osiria blooms. The red tips on their white petals make him feel like the flowers had been dipped in blood.
isn’t the kind of conversation he’s ever had to have; with most of the his partners, he’d either already been experimenting, or they’d had bigger problems to worry about.
“Cap,” he had said, several weeks after Steve had woken up in the future, “we’ve learned about your liaisons.”
By twenty, he begins to feel like maybe there’s something wrong with him. By then, most people around him have gotten concrete ideas of what they’re looking for, what their soulmates will be to them, act like, speak like. He listens to descriptions:
Stark takes a step back from him. His voice is softer back he speaks, quieter, “Go to bed, Captain Rogers.”
“How’d you find me?” Tony asks, not bothering to hide his exhaustion.
They’re ambushed halfway up, some forty lava monsters against the two of them. Despite his earlier words, Iron Man fires up whatever weapons he’s got on his gauntlets and shoots at the guards at Steve’s six. Steve finds it easy to move with him, easy to match his rhythm. As he’s almost trapped in some rapidly hardening sort of goo, Iron Man blasts him out, twists him out of the way. Steve learns the other man’s strengths and weaknesses almost too quickly, finds himself able to anticipate every move which his newfound partner launches himself into.
And so, to prove a point to both himself and Tony, he’d volunteered to accompany him on this mission, undercover as a bodyguard. He knew — knows — that this can’t go on, that he needs to get over himself. This, he tells himself, will help — he’ll see Tony in action, both as himself and Iron Man. He’ll work with him, and he’ll feel normal again.
There’s one way to get out of here; he could write to Steve, get the street name down. He could break his silence, out himself. And then what? Leave Steve heartbroken, trying to fake happiness for a soulmate that’ll never be enough for him?
