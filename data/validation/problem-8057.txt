Tony winced at the volume of Steve’s voice, and Steve immediately shrank back, hunched in on himself. Tony reached for him, or intended to, until realized his left hand was heavy.
He hesitated, knowing outside meant almost immediate freedom, but there was obviously a wealth of evidence in this warehouse. If he had enough time, he could probably get all the information he needed prove there was a fake Iron Man and Pierce’s involvement in the whole scheme.
The world returned in muffled sounds and flashes of lights from the dashboard of Tony’s car. He flinched as sparks landed against his skin. The movement brought screaming pain into awareness and he coughed once through the smoke wafting in from the engine. He fumbled for the door, cursing at the sharp twinge in his broken thumb, and felt the crumpled in remains of the driver side. He cautiously turned his head and coughed again, taking stock of his position.
Not expecting the strange sensation morphing into pleasure that sent his stomach swooping, he’d actually sobbed into his gag and gotten dizzy where he knelt. He had to force himself not to fuck into the feeling, each thrust earning him an answering thrust of the plug inside of him. The pulses of the e-stim rod were sporadic, turned on only from Tony’s whim, and the pace and duration of it varied. Slow. Fast. Staccato. On and off for almost an hour.
“That new guitar we saw in Seattle?” Tony asked, eyes bright in the dim interior of the limo.
Tony sighed heavily like it was the hardest thing in the world and then pulled himself up to trudge upstairs.
“I’ll be by in the morning,” he promised, walking towards the door as he pulled his coat on and buttoned the two middle buttons.
The next time Steve searches for Tony through the mingling crowd of tuxes and dresses, he notices that the billionaire is missing. There’s no moment of panic as Tony always makes a random escape, the pressing, simpering adulation even too much for Iron Man once in awhile. So instead, Steve makes a polite excuse to the senator he was speaking with and exits the main ballroom.
Stark’s body went limp, and Clint stood up, removing his mask. He dropped it to the roof and pulled on his cowl before beginning to scale down his building.
“Fighting with the overwhelming smell of shrimp in the air is not the same thing,” Tony replied archly, “In fact, I think it only encourages the consumption of seafood. We could order in, make a picnic of it.”
“You aren’t from around here, are you?”
“All shoes are running shoes,” Pietro replied, and that was that.
the tie. That’s it. At least keep it on until the set. Then you can throw it at some woman’s face.”
“Let’s not waste time,” Tony says, and the asset realizes that Tony has broken himself too. His handler is weak, so it’s only fitting that this be the end. Deep down, as the asset reads over his final mission, that awareness inside of him breathes a sigh of relief. He burns the instructions and enters the room.
Tony closed the drawing room door behind him with a sigh and then let the suit open up so he could step of it. It closed up immediately after he cleared it, stepping back once to plant itself like a statue in the corner, or a sentinel set to guard. The black panels seemed to blend into the shadows and the dark wood of the drawing room walls.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replied. The data replayed, displaying the National Nuclear Security Administration’s current operational status. The whole point of the Megaports Initiative was to work with their partner countries to systematically enhance their detection capabilities for nuclear and radioactive materials. If the NNSA had put out an alert…
Steve wrenched himself out of Tony’s distraction, dragging Tony with him by slamming his hands to the table on either side of Tony’s naked hips. His own clothed hips pressed against the edge of the table, against Tony’s ass. He hummed as the visuals dissolved like wisps of smoke in the air, and he tipped his head down to tease Tony with the tip of his tongue. He licked the metal ring against Tony’s mouth and rocked his hardening cock against Tony’s body. He let it settle between Tony's cheeks to rub against his skin with the rough denim he'd chosen to replace his uniform with.
“Anytime, baby,” Steve says softly, kissing his temple again. “Do you want to go back out there?”
feel bad.”
“That’s the problem, isn’t it? He’s a genius; he’s probably light years ahead of us when it comes to how to wipe our asses. I really don’t think he’d miss Fury being suspicious of him, so…” Steve scratched a hand through the light stubble that had grown along his jaw since the start of his current mission.
There was silence again after Tony let go of the button, a silence that felt even heavier than Tony’s bracelet. The entry buzz finally sounded and Tony slipped into the foyer of the apartment complex. He rubbed his hands nervously for a moment before striding for the elevator and riding it up to Steve’s floor. The hallway was quiet when the doors opened, the soft tread of Tony’s step barely making a sound.
Tony hated how it made him feel hollow inside. There were some people who believed in omens concerning cherry blossoms, believed they held a deep, spiritual meaning. He thought they simply signaled how fragile life truly was, and that even if it looked as pretty as that on the surface, there was still nothing but the stain of life on the ground left as proof. He tracked a couple, small and indistinguishable from his position in the building, as they got caught in an eddy of the falling petals. The pink swirled around them and past to flutter off in the grass or into the water.
“N-No,” Tony breathes. God, is that his voice? His throat is tight, his breath sticking to the dryness. He swallows again. “No, let me look.”
“I like it.”
It wasn’t easy, rounding up the eight Doombots -and wasn’t that shit, that only eight of those bots were able to cause so many problems? Especially when the clock was ticking down faster and faster, and all Tony could think about was adamantly denying that Victor had anything to do with this.
“There could be dates,” Tony cut in quietly, meeting Steve’s gaze as the blond stared at him. “I mean, if you wanted… I know I’m not exactly the best catch, bu-”
“Our copycat is getting sloppy,” he said, tossing a faceplate one way and some ripped out wires another. He pointed to the empty robot, “He’s not even trying anymore. These certainly run on magic, and Cap, I don’t know if you know this, but not everyone can use magic ‘round these parts.”
Tony tipped his chin up and had to remind himself that Steve was completely different than Ty. Ty was lean and dark where Steve was broad and light. Ty was obnoxious and
"You don’t use the shield anymore," he says and, to his own ears, his voice sounds very far away. "Not since you’ve become Commander. Why is it-"
“I don’t care. Cho drugged him to the gills anyway. He’s not going anywhere anytime soon.”
As Stark disappeared through the back of the tent, Peggy just sighed and rubbed both hands over her brow. “Of course you do. Damn elf.”
His free time is filled with it these days.
“Exposing Pierce as Hydra and that it’s at the helm of the East Coast? That’ll change everything, Tony. It’ll change across the country, not just here, not just the East Coast. I’m prepared for that, but are you? Truly?”
"You like what you see?" Steve asks, sly amusement weighing his tone down.
“They what?!” Tony exclaimed, heart pounding in his ears. His vision swam with it, and all he wanted to do was to fly to SHIELD then and kill them all. Steve’s lips pressed against Tony’s fist, drawing his attention.
With just his fingers.
“Fine. Get it in the case, and I’ll do what you want. But I’m only giving you a week like this. After that, you’re back in the field with me.”
"Show me one, and I might," Tony cracked back, tone whip-tight, as they started dragging him down the road towards the jet.
He shrugged out of his shirt and dropped his clothes on the floor before turning to crawl up Tony’s body. His boyfriend’s blue briefs were lopsided on his lean frame, and Steve placed a tender kiss on the revealed
“Mr. Fury is going to be here tonight with Ms. Potts in about an hour,” Steve reminded him quietly, thumbs sweeping over Tony’s temples. “I have to start dinner.”
“You never cease to amaze me.” Tony laughed softly and checked the watch on his wrist. He was about to continue speaking when another voice announced the shadow that fell over Tony’s left shoulder.
“Well, how about that,” Tony murmured, “You think you can claim me?”
Tony feels the slickness of lube before his fingers connect with the flat end of a plug. He chokes on air through his nose, grunting with it into the kiss and Steve grins and uses Tony's newfound grip to fuck himself with the plug.
“What do you mean ‘how do I know’?” Tony asked seriously, “Steve, I was just…”
He ripped the blindfold off, wanting to see Tony’s eyes as he crested his release. Tony blinked blearily at him, eyes dazed and unfocused, red-rimmed and wet, and then they crinkled in what Steve could only assume was amusement.
“They’re good,” Tony murmurs, carefully turning a page to look at the next image. “I just need one suit for now, though, don’t worry.”
“Been there, done that,” Pierce smirked, dragging Tony up one last time to press the barrel of his gun under Tony’s chin, “Goodbye, Tony.”
Three days later, Steve sits on the edge of Tony’s bed in the penthouse suite. He’s nervous again and Tony wishes he could offer his lover just a bit of alcohol to ease his nerves. But it wouldn’t work on Steve and Tony’s going through a forced dry-spell. Besides, he wants to be completely sober for this experience and wouldn’t put Steve at risk -even with his enhanced healing- from unsteady hands.
A woman passed by on the sidewalk and Tony had enough time to admire the style of her pumps before Steve’s voice answered with a gruff “Yeah?”
Rogers busied himself with kneeling down to set everything out on the floor for them. Out of the bag, he pulled take-out dining ware, two large bottles of water, and a styrofoam take-out container with two smaller containers taped to its lid. It smelled disgustingly, mouthwateringly good, and Tony pointed at it.
The next time Tony stepped on stage after a full recovery, Steve was in the wings. He stood next to Pepper, hands shoved in his pockets and dopey grin on his face, as they listened to the deafening roar of Tony’s fans.
How would Tony ever believe him when he admitted the same?
“Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Be scared of both of them, and we should make it out without too much shit.”
“Don’t thank me,” Tony laughs, maybe a bit hysterically. “We haven’t done it yet. And you might not even enjoy it.”
“When people play with things they don’t understand,
Rhodey frowned and said; “I feel like it’s more your color, you know? Red. Bright. Eye-catching.”
Over Tony’s dead body.
He burst out of the employee access door and out onto the airstrip. Steve had already been alerted to Tony's seeming bid for freedom, because he was striding across the strip in full uniform as an unknown redheaded agent took the case from him, heading in the opposite direction towards a jet.
“Are you okay?”
I had a shitty episode - so I wrote this for catharsis.
Stephanie wasn’t given to much gossip. Mostly because she had no friends in the camp, and she tried to avoid being around groups of the other cadets as often as possible. But even she couldn’t avoid hearing about the Dunmer that helped run the armory that followed the company from training ground to training ground.
“Doesn’t dinner come before you getting into my pants?” Tony asks, trying to find his wit and charm. Its effect is muted from behind his palms, but he finally drops his hands, letting them fidget between their bodies.
Tony scowled and let Steve take the offensive object away from him, that goddamn song still playing like a smug, smothering pillow.
Jarvis' sensors are running at fast speeds, cataloging, memorizing. The suit's head turns, ducks, presses the faceplate to her throat.
Tony looked up at him, swallowed, and tried to remember that he wasn’t wearing any of his armor, sunglasses included. He licked his lips completely by mistake, heart pounding as Rogers followed the movement. They were suspended in that moment, and Tony couldn’t decide whether he wanted Rogers to try to kiss him or not, but regardless, he couldn’t let him. Not when he wasn’t sure of whom was aware of his hobby of flying around in a black and red suit and being blamed for blowing up airports.
Tony had dropped his head, moaned a little, then slid back off the bed to get dressed. He’d kissed each of his lovers goodbye and gone to work.
Tony barked out a laugh at that, mindful of the way his cheeks stayed stretched in a smile after his initial amusement. “Alright, Rogers, you win. I’ll let you let me treat you to dinner, but I definitely need to get cleaned up first.”
“Just once I’d like flowers. Remember when you used to be so romantic, bringing me dinner and fried oreos?”
“I wear my…” Tony murmured under his breath, fingers tapping absently against his slack-covered thigh. “So I can, so I can…”
Tony knew immediately that he'd gone one step too far, and as his helmet -he'd forgotten Steve still had it in his hand- slammed into his face after Steve threw it at him, he thought 'yeah, I kinda deserved that'. The ramp on the jet closed, taking away the sight of Steve's pinched and pale expression.
“To happy endings,” Sam quipped, toasting the bottle the bartender brought as Steve could only offer a laugh in return before draining his shot and smacking the glass down to the bar.
Fury raised his brows pointedly at Tony, who promptly scowled right back at him.
“Oh, that’s a little dark, soldier,” Tony murmured, mildly impressed, even though he knew it wasn’t exactly what Rogers had meant.
Tony blinked, looking up, and up, at Rogers. His mouth quirked. “You mean, to sound like a motorcycle? Did you do that, Captain, when you were running the streets of 1920’s Brooklyn?”
“You-”
“Anthony, would you please do us both the favor and just spit it out already,” Victor pulled away from Tony, fixing the placement of his vest over his shirt.
—back over to them on the silver lining of your precious shield.
He searched Tony’s face, looking for something in Tony’s expression. Whether he found it or not, Tony didn’t know, but Victor did step closer, much closer, into Tony’s space. It trapped his hand between them, pressing a piercing pain into Tony’s side where his fingers were still twisted up in Tony’s shirt.
“If you want,” Tony said, heart pounding. “Because I do, and I might sound a little desperate, and I’m pretty sure I shouldn’t have said that, but you’re really hot and nice and your smile is-I should stop...talking…”
“Maybe, maybe not. You start running for something like the Presidency and screaming about how the government killed your parents, others will start to put the puzzle together.”
Tony prayed; he prayed hard in the span of a breath, knowing what was coming and knowing that he couldn’t give Steve what he wanted.
His hand comes around her throat; her pulse jumps against the flesh of his fingers. He knows he is not to do this with the cold metal of his prosthetic. He is meant to feel this, as he felt it years ago. He does. Her blood pumps quickly to flood around the pressure points of his fingers as he squeezes.
Steve hid his dopey smile against his pillow and responded.
“I missed you, Tones,” was pressed into his neck, slurred against his jaw. And Tony felt sick, felt the shudder-sweep of nausea roll through his stomach. He couldn’t lift his hands. They stayed against the door, limp and useless. “Tell me you missed me too. I want to hear you say it.”
Then, the shed door slammed shut, and the men lunged.
“Sorry,” Tony whispered, moving his hand across Steve’s bared back. “I’m almost done. Go back to sleep.”
“You’re a giant tease.” Tony pouted, crossing his arms, and didn’t care how ridiculous he might look. “And I’m going to tell ‘em you’re still not using their first names. You’re going to make Pepper make that face, and then we’ll
,” Tony bit out and Ronin was quiet for a moment then he pulled his mask off, letting it lie against his back.
“And to you as well. I’m sorry to cut this short, but I must get back to work. Perhaps another time,” Tony said, not returning the smile in any way.
“Oh man, this is embarrassing! I think I left my bomb in baggage claims,” Iron Man crooned, metallic, unfeeling, “but we’re all friends, right? What’s a little fire here or collapsed building there?”
“You always hurt the ones you love, Tony,” Steve sighed patiently, amused, “We’ll always leave you.”
Tony’s gaze narrowed. “You were just what?”
Steve must have made a face, because Tony flapped a hand and grimaced.
He touches her with the thick, blunt fingers of the gauntlets, slides over her skin with careful strokes. He cups her breasts, learns the shape of her bottom and the strong muscles of her thighs.
Tony’s hand jerked forward, clanging his connector against the inside of the chest cavity. He pulled his hand free and shook it slightly to try and still the trembling.
“I suppose he has a point,” Steve mused, turning Tony’s face one way then the other, “You might still be useful after all.”
Frank pushed away from the window with a grimace, rubbing a hand over his head.
“First, we will finish helping these mortal men. Then, we’ll retrieve the Tesseract and go home. You owe them that much. Not to mention the Doctor and myself. I was in the middle of a great hunt and now Lady Sif will have all the brag-”
On his back on the roof of his car, everything loose had been scattered around. His suit’s case wasn’t among them, but the windows had been shattered out, so it could’ve fallen out in the fall.
“I try to be a good soldier,” Stephanie heard herself say, fixated on the nimble movements of Natasha’s hands. “Despite the unit treating me the way they do. Being afraid and attacking me because of it...I do my best, but in a camp full of people, I’ve never felt more alone. I’m not as strong as you think I am.”
“Did they finally let you out to play, Capsicle?” Iron Man taunted as Tony let the facade continue. “All for little ol’ me? I’m touched, but I’m on a bit of schedule here, so if you don’t mind....”
The music in the lab was angry and loud, drowning out everything except Tony’s cyclical thoughts. He couldn’t stop thinking about Steve and the dream, but he viciously tried to focus on the fake Doombots and the mental attack that he’d been put through. It helped that he had two of the bots disemboweled across three tables as a distraction. Currently, he was elbow deep in their coding with faraway expression as he threaded through data sequences and synapses.
Steve’s eyes were a much darker blue at the moment, but his smile was still soft, still caught in wonder. Then, it was curving into a tease. “Okay, but promise I can play footsies under the table with you.”
That is not what’s on the screen.
Tony let out a huff of amusement, and that was definitely an honest feeling, because it was such a fucked up truth. “I didn’t mean to. I thought I was calling my partner.”
Tony's mouth was hot and wet, and the suction was tight, sliding along Steve's shaft like Tony could drag Steve's orgasm out of him with one powerful twist of his tongue. He was looking at Steve through his lashes, gaze dark and hungry.
Tony catches hints of paint on Steve's other hand before both are sliding into Tony's hair and holding his head still for Steve's kiss. It's hard and demanding for all that it's inviting Tony closer, deeper with each slip and sweep of their tongues.
Steve lifts his gaze to Tony’s; his eyes are dull, the lines around them deep and craggy. Tony’s eyes are empty, as if the genius had vacated long ago and left the husk of himself walking around to be controlled.
Tony is nowhere to be seen.
“Don’t you like it?” he wondered, resting a calloused, wide palm on Tony’s thigh. He fanned his fingers out, dug the tips in lightly to cause Tony’s skin to turn white, then scored his nails lightly up along the muscle to Tony’s knee. “So open and exposed for me. You’re not hiding anything like this, Tony. Not from me, not anymore.”
It's December now, though, and Tony kind of wants to take Steve home to New York for a real snowy Christmas, not Malibu's beach equivalent. After all, no one needs to know the truth of their three month friendship to go to Times Square.
He feels.
“Steve.” Steve ignored Tony's voice, nuzzling at his throat and jaw. He was trying his best to leave a mark that no one could mistake, the burn of climax just beginning to curl his toes.
“I’ve always found managing my time rather easy.” Tony smoothed a hand over his knee, pressing out a wrinkle. “I even account for interruptions, so politics could just be another note to add to the harmony, or more like… It’s like a metronome; you just have to learn how to play to the steady, inexorable beat.”
Tony, being the bastard coward that he was, fled with dignity, hearing Steve’s door click shut behind him.
“Hey, only I can call her useless,” Tony replied, only kind of sharply, “and yeah, she’s good. Cleaned up a few of her bugs and let Jarvis take her systems through diagnostics. He cleared her, so I trust them. Besides, she hasn’t had any issues with New York.”
“Oh no,” the man sways again as he chuckles and allows Steve and the valet to guide him down the street. “Assist away, good sir.”
It scares him, tightens like a ball of lead in his gut.
He lets the phone go and it clatters back into the drawer. He slams it shut and grabs the first piece of scrap paper he finds. In a hurried scrawl, he writes three words and throws the paper in the box.
“Tony’s… No, he was fixed. He was… His therapy’s been going well. The reports… He and Bucky have…” Steve’s heart clenches, jealousy and guilt twisting together, then a clear, dawning understanding. “Oh my god, they planned it. He came for Bucky...”
What a waste of an erection.
Tony finds himself on the outside looking in.
“Did you just… Do I even want to know what it is? Please tell me it’s just regular… Tell me it’s something I’ll know.”
“You stay away from Tony,” Steve warned over Thor’s shoulder.
It takes a few minutes, but they eventually collapse back in a heap in the center of the bed, panting and flushed.
Tony wouldn’t give Victor the satisfaction of an outward response, though the blood pounded around the wound.
Nightmares of being in a space so open that he felt claustrophobic; the inky darkness closing in and the constant ringing of an unanswered phone.
“This is what you chose for me losing the bet?” He’d scratched at his stomach and laughed a little as Bucky had nipped at his fingers. He’d buried his hand in his Bucky’s hair as Steve had leaned over his kissed the corner of Tony’s mouth.
“He knows who Iron Man is and he knows that I know he had my parents killed.”
“Titanborn, I believe you and I are going to get along very,
“Because someone has to,” Steve replied softly, and he could see some of Tony’s anger deflate from his posture. “Look around us, Tony. There aren’t… There aren’t that many of us. This world needs all the help it can get. And even I know I’m not enough, but I’m trying. I’m trying to do what’s right and what’s good and save a little of this planet for the ones who come to fill our shoes. I thought…”
“My hero.” Steve was only half joking, mouth quirking at the phrase.
As Steve’s climax burned bright and hot through him in response, he heard Tony whisper brokenly. “You’re so beautiful, Steve. Steve, please… Please…”
She blinked and tried to look anywhere but right at Stark, but not before she saw Stark settle a hand on her hip.
After all, all he could blame then was that the copycat simply wanted to ruin any chance of Tony revealing his identity for fear of reprisal. It couldn’t be that simple, could it?
Tony finds himself staring at the pretzels as he listens to Clint make an inside joke with Natasha, hears the rest of the table snicker despite not having all of the details.
The mage hummed noncommittally and left the General’s tent. There was a beat of silence, and Stephanie shifted on her stool. It creaked and, finally, the General turned around.
Tony stares at the datapad for long, long beat of silence. Long enough that Steve begins to fidget. He swallows heavily and jerks the datapad away from Steve as Steve goes to take it away.
When the check was presented, Tony automatically reached for his wallet, but Steve beat him to it with a smile and an insistent press of the bill back to the server.
“What’s the plan?”
... Anthony.”
“Aww, thanks, buddy. How much time do we have?” In the distance, Tony could make out the ATC tower taking shape. He set his jaw and kicked his repulsors faster.
“Don’t do this, Tony. If you didn’t have a part of you that’d want to cooperate, then why did you even call me? Why me?”
“You just don’t get it. He called me, Nick. He called me even though it risked everything. And yeah, it definitely backfired on him, but he still did it.”
“Doesn’t change the fact that you’re up a shit creek, Stark.” Fury spread his arms. “Say hello to your paddle.”
“Oh my god!” He shouts, forgetting to be any sort of contained. “You have one?! Were you in the testers program? That’s a shit question, of course you were. Look at my baby, all grown up and attached to someone’s body already. Ah, the childhood just flies by, doesn’t it?”
“Exactly!” Tony snapped, and he brought his feet down from the window to the floor. “They
“What… is he?” Tony breathed.
"It's not me," Tony whispers, the words brushed against her cheek.
He wanted to see if Steve had texted him, but the texts had stopped a week ago, a week after the missed phone calls. He rubbed his chest and started the car, pulling out onto the road.
Tony finally gets the freedom to explore Steve with his hands, marking him lightly with the scratch of blunted nails and manages to not picture the blood on his hands.
“You wanted my control,” Steve breathed, sliding his mouth to Tony’s cheek. Tony groaned in answer, and Steve’s thighs began shaking the table with the force of his thrusts. Tears and sweat dropped and rolled down the curve of Tony’s cheeks, dripped down between them to disappear in the mess of their sex.
Tony makes it halfway across the living room before he registers what he’s seeing. It’s dark and the moon is only splitting through the blinds unevenly. He could be forgiven, he thinks, that it takes him that long.
“And Pepper? Rhodey? Are they your failures, Tony?”
“What the hell is going on?” he asked and hoped that he didn’t sound as bewildered as he felt.
Standing anywhere from a half-foot to a full foot above the tallest of Nord men in the camp, Stephanie was very aware of her unusual height, the broadness in her form that came with it. Before joining the Nordic army, she’d never once given it another thought. Now though, it was all she
The shield ricocheted back into the Captain’s hand with scary accuracy, and he jumped, twisting to fling the shield again. It hit almost perfectly, shattering the plate just before Tony’s right foot’s repulsor.
Tony dragged his gaze up from the case to Steve’s face, another realization pouring acid through his veins, burning him alive. He watched the pedestal under Steve crack and crumble to dust, his trusting scattered to the winds.
The Captain’s entire posture changed, and Tony braced himself with a sigh just as the shield left the Captain’s hand. He projected the bank shot before the shield connected against the fallen beam, and kicked off the ground with a steady jet from his boots.
“Understood, sir.”
By the time their dinner plates were scraped clean and removed from the table, Tony was gesturing expansively to describe the importance of the tone on his next album. Steve’s chin was on his fist, watching Tony with rapt attention. Dessert went by in a blur of soft laughter and the impending sense of the evening coming to an end.
"How did the military manage to churn you out so 'boy-next-door', Captain Rogers?" Tony asked, drawing his hand back to pull his phone from his pocket when it chimed.
“I’m so-”
Once he cleared the window, he pushed himself up on his hands. That was when the crunch of gravel got his attention as his hearing returned. It was a split second too late as a boot slammed into his side sending him sprawling past the car against the pavement. He gasped out, blood staining his mouth as he struggled to get off the ground.
She started towards the soldier holding the elf. The cap the elf was wearing caught against the wooden planks and pulled free as he dropped down to catch the soldier in the balls with the heel of his hand.
“No. No, we’re done there, so just… I don’t know. Archive Steve’s messages.”
. Go cool your head; I hear ice baths are all the rage where you're from!"
The way Tony’s voice hardened on his last word made Steve’s heart thump painfully. He glanced at the suit again, then back to Tony. Everything was still fuzzy, the pain a distant ache in his gut, but he could feel his body healing and sealing up the bullet wounds. He didn’t remember the doctor’s finishing the surgery, though.
“I wish you’d reconsider,” Tony murmured, rubbing his nose against Steve’s neck and behind his ear. He felt Steve sigh and squeezed his arms just a little tighter. One of Steve’s hands came up to cover Tony’s arm, warm and comforting.
“He’ll be here any second,” Tony finished dryly, shooting off the street to avoid three electric bolts aimed his way. “Right, start the sequences. I’ll do my best. And for fuck’s sake, route the other Doombots this way so emergency services can get through.”
Tony wanted to close his eyes, to picture anything but the man in front of him in his final seconds, but he would never, never give Pierce the satisfaction.
All evening, Steve catches sight of Tony staring absently into a glass that never seems empty. Whether his friend is drinking too much or only pretending to, Steve doesn’t know. He does know that the absentee expression disappears as soon as someone approaches and Steve tucks the knowledge away to bring up later, when everyone is home and they’re not being watched by society.
Tony blinked, saying with a frown: “Of course I do,” because that was true. Tony trusted Steve. It was Iron Man not trusting Captain America that was the main problem. It was Tony not trusting Captain America.
The kicker is, he's talking to his friend. To his friend that's thousands of miles away and can't hear. Hasn't tried to hear him.
Jarvis has many more memories of them together now. His suit became slimmer, easier to manage around beds and tighter spaces. They experiment and play and love, and Jarvis feels content.
Tony finds himself on the outside looking in.
There was a whirlwind of motion as Ty turned and hauled Tony over to the bed a few feet behind them. Tony’s brain shorted out, unable to believe what was happening.
“What?” Sam blinked.
The streets of London have never been a favorite of Steve’s. He thinks they’re full of snobby, tilt-nosed hypocrites that will sooner piss on the poor than in the golden chamber pots they stash under their beds. He adjusts the sit of his cloak as he walks in the crisp night air. The blue fabric is nearly black even under the street lamps and he makes a tutting noise low in his throat. He amends that New York is not much better in the way of morality, despite what the well-to-dos there might think.
“You think Alexander Pierce is kidnapping civilians?” Steve said with an astonished huff of amusement, “I may not agree with everything he says, especially about you, but he’s clearly doing everything he can to make the people’s lives easier, to help the country run smoother.”
He’d ended in a shout, and Tony blinked normally, feeling an eerie calm settle over his aching body. He turned a little, placing the ruined cup on the stand that was close enough for him to reach.
Tony’s breath froze, the table digging into his spine as Steve pushed into him. He caught at Steve’s arms in return, twisting his shirt up in his fists.
“Try to behave,” Pepper said as they drove to the party. “And I might have something nice for you.”
Rogers broke out another blinding smile, at ease now that his suggestion hadn’t been outright rejected. “Good, that’s good. Agent Coulson said you never took a break for lunch, so I feel it’s my duty to drag you away and make sure you get something more nutritional than the sludge they call coffee here.”
Tony turned to look at Fury, leaning back against the windowsill before saying, “What do you want, Nick?”
“Casualties?” Tony asked as he boosted his thrusters and dove in low through Hamilton Park.
“Yeah, um... Insurance put me through the trial when your company issued the release,” he says, flexing the gleaming, metal appendage.
"You should have gone back to sleep, baby," Steve murmurs, brushing his nose along the edge of Tony’s ear. Tony jolts and tries to pull away then, but Steve’s other arm slides against his waist. "I’ll be the one to protect you from a will to survive and a voice of reason."
Ronin did the worst thing he could have done: encouraged Pietro with a snicker. He said; “I’d break you, kid. Meet me in the Square, and bring your running shoes.”
“Well then, I guess I should say good luck, Mr. Stark.”
true. I could’ve told you everything you wanted to know, but instead of asking for the truth, you hid behind your own and you tried to… It wasn’t enough that you invaded my personal life, my work, and my home. You would’ve used me like you earned it for aggravated payment.”
He should throw them away.
“I don’t know, General Carter,” Stephanie replied, squaring her shoulders. The muscles ached in protest, but she kept herself straight.
“-helped the bad guys. All for your own selfish gain! You think you’re the only who’s lost people, Tony? The only one who wants to get back at Pierce for his perceived wrongs?”
"I said stand down!" Steve spat, "If you think I'm letting you off this base to get to your boyfriend -yeah, I know about that too," he added grimly as Tony felt the shock pass over his expression. Good, let the man think he'd won this.
“Sure, thanks. Lemon with it, please.”
…The thought slips away, and he doesn’t even mourn its passing. He closes his eyes and lets it go. Another one takes its place.
'Stop' he mutters to himself as he yanks the drawer open and stares at the multitude of cards sliding around loose.
“It won’t bite you,” he practically purred, “Not unless you want it to. I can make t-”
“-nd then they start taking off the tires! Now, Buck was definitely way more interested in things like that, but I gotta admit that it looked real neat. When the car started to hover, I think everyone thought it was just a magic trick, so they weren’t surprised to see it fail. But…”
“You’re hilarious, but cut the crap, Tony. We both know your boyfriend can use magic. What’s to-”
“You’re both hot,” Ronin said almost fondly, “but seriously. Get Castle, and let’s get this show on the road.”
They chose to go left outside of the Amara’s, walking with only a little space between them. Steve was a solid wall of heat on Tony’s right side, and he found it very distracting. His fingers twitched, and he wanted to reach out and hold Steve’s hand, but just shoved them in his pockets to avoid the temptation. A few moments later, Steve followed suit.
“I’m so fucking proud of you, baby,” Tony croons, pushing the sound gently back inside again as he slides his fist up. Steve sobs again, chest heaving. “Keeping so still for me, aren’t you? Do you want to come like this? Can you come like this?”
He wouldn't give ground to ‘Steve’. That was a reward; one which the Captain hadn't earned yet.
Tony nearly wept in relief, slumping against the car as Crossbones’ attention was drawn away. His vision wavered and he did have to roll slightly to the side to retch as nausea swept through him. He heard Crossbones curse and the sounds of more arrows embedding themselves in the ground.
“Do you have magic, too?! What else don’t I know about you?! Are you in my head, Tony?!’ Steve jerked him again, and Tony adamantly shook his head.
“Yes, yes,” Steve cries immediately. “Let me come, let me come.”
“I know,” Steve said, like he understood what Tony was trying to say. “I know, sweetheart. I never thought differently.” He kissed Tony’ s brow. “You’re coming home with me, and I’m going to take care of you until you’re sick of me.” Until Steve could see Tiberius Stone on the news and not want to destroy everything in his path.
“You should worry about yourself, Tony,” Pierce mused, sauntering up to where Tony lay stretched over the pier. “Your pretty prince isn’t going to save you this time. Now where were we?”
Steve put a hand through his own hair.
, in camp that was also half-giant, and they were quite happy to point it out on more than one occasion. In a world of many different races and species, to think that her own kind would treat her so coarsely...She raised her chin and smiled politely through the veiled and not-so-veiled remarks.
Steve does.
He watched the Captain --
The first fight was not exactly a surprise. The tension had been building ever since she step foot inside the training grounds. Whispers followed her across the field towards the armory shed, louder and louder as she went. When she opened her chest to find her things missing, she knew.
No one else comments Rhodey’s attempt at showing off on a shuffle is laughed off by Clint. There’s a short scuffle across the tabletop and Thor’s laugh booms out.
“But that doesn’t make it right,” Tony rasped. His throat was thick with emotion, with the knowledge that Steve’s eidetic memory meant he was going to relive every abusive moment with his father in perfect detail for as long as the serum made him live.
Steve growled and dropped down to his forearms, trapping Tony’s legs over his elbows, trapping Tony’s hand and cock between their stomachs.
“You will remove the bindings, Loki,” Thor argued, shaking Loki just a little, “and you will apologize to the Captain for your interference.”
It wasn’t until Bucky and Nat were over for dinner that it even occurred to Steve that there could be something between him and Tony. This new, wondrous friendship he had with the genius was not something easily described and couldn’t be notched perfectly in a slot.
Tony shoved Steve's head back against the pillow, fingers gripping his jaw impossibly hard.
He watches and listens, knows that Tony’s melody is telling a story. A story that he can’t tell any other way. It makes something ache fiercely in Steve’s chest. As the music swells and Tony’s jaw clenches, visible to Steve even at his distance, the moment suddenly feels too intimate, too personal for Steve to be bearing witness to.
“Now, I know you’re just yanking my chain,” Stephanie said, letting herself relax a little. “Beautiful is definitely not something to describe me.”
“Not everything’s gotta be fancy, Stark,” Fury said, shelling a few peanuts then popping them into his mouth one by one, “Sometimes you gotta remember where the people are. Right here. At the bottom of all our fancy towers and high-tech buildings.”
"Isolate and save you from yourself," he hears Steve say as the darkness consumes him.
"She’s a doll," he hears Steve say about what’s-her-name-Tiff-Janice-bimbo-that-wasn’t-Tony-who’s-lucky-ass-is-getting-a-quiet-dinner-with-Captain-America-and-probably-doesn’t-understand-how-LUCKY-she-is…
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” Steve whispered. “I should’ve been there.”
Something like relief broke through Tony, and he flung his right hand towards Steve, grasping and tugging until their foreheads were pressed together.
Tony slides the rod slowly out to another one of Steve’s fracturing moans. He adds another drizzle of lube from quickly drying pool on Steve’s stomach then slides the rod back inside.
“Shh,” Steve whispered, “You’re so good for me, doing so well,” and he began to press those two fingers in alongside his cock as he gave shallow, teasing thrusts against Tony’s ass. The hooks were rattling, a constant stream of metallic noise, and Tony was a dam of choking, broken moans. His cock twitched and pulsed and reddened, so wet with precome and spit that it shone even in the dim, red light.
“And what does Captain America have to say about your offer?” Tony asked sardonically, “Pretty sure he hates me as much as I hate him.”
“I asked her once, asked her why she stayed with him. I was just a dumb kid at the time, though, and I guess I expected some grand declaration about love and devotion, but I remember… She sat me down at the kitchen table and took one of my hands in both of hers. She had a black eye at the time, swelled almost all of her cheek, but she smiled and it was genuine. She squeezed my hand and said ‘He may not be a Prince Charming, Stevie, but our life is no fairy tale. He goes tae work, and he comes home. He makes sure we’ve got money for food and heat and the medicines that I need tae make sure you get the life you deserve. But times are tough now for everyone, my sweet babe. This country let us in it, but it dinnae offer any of us a free ride. If all it be is a tap here tae there that keeps him here tae support you, then by the good Lord’s spine, I will bend tae his wind and see you raised.’
On the HUD, Tony eyed the rectangle forming between The Holland and the Home Depot. It was at least a block away and he still had to deal with the immediate threat of the five fighting Doombots just in front of him.
“For the rest of my life,” Steve promised.
“Statement piece?” Pepper asks and now she’s chuckling at him. “Tony, I think it’s a good idea. Mr. Rogers made me that Charmeuse dress for the spring gala.”
“Yes, Missy,” Tony replied, taking the first bite of his cereal. Melissa walked away, the tips of her fingers brushing his ear.
“Right,” Sam drew out, “How’s that going for you? Fury still hounding you for intel?”
“You know, I’m getting really tired of you trying to kill my boyfriend,” Steve growled. He stood, the bloodstain spreading down from his shoulder along his spine. Tony started scrambling at the chains wrapped around his legs.
“They take their hands, Tony,” Howard murmured, thumb stroking over Tony’s wrist. “That’s their penalty for stealing. You steal, you get caught, you pay the price.”
“The one and only,” Tony said, trying to force his mouth back to something normal. Honestly, it was like he’d never seen tall and muscled before. Tony licked his lips and hoped to God he wasn’t
The music cut out, and he did scowl then. Damn Jarvis for the traitor he was, and damn Steve for thinking he still had a right to make requests of Tony’s AI.
“I love you too,” Tony says after a long silence. He feels loose and shaky, drained and tired. Steve’s still steady around him and Tony doesn’t really feel the slight headache forming from where he’d bumped his head. “Thank you.”
“I don’t know, Pep,” Tony says, trying not to sound as blissed out as he is. “They’re pretty shameless, not much we can embarrass them with.”
“Why? I mean, everyone adores him. He’s… He’s -what did Fury call him?”
A switch flicks on inside Tony, and his heels are planted into the bed just as Steve lifts his hips, not far, just enough to shift Tony's cock inside of him. Tony bares his teeth, fueled by alcohol and that strange perverted possessiveness, and begins fucking up into Steve with hard snaps of his hips.
But then, suddenly, the gag was gone, had been gone, and Steve’s aching jaw no longer ached. He was still mindless, still blindfolded, but he was no longer bolted to the floor. Instead, he was straddling Tony’s hips, knees braced against Tony’s sides so tightly that he was sure to leave bruises. The cock inside of him was hotter than anything Steve had ever experienced, burning him from the inside out.
“I’d say anytime, but honestly… Don’t get hurt again,” Tony said, feeling as old as his voice sounded tired.
“Why does it have to be you?” Steve's voice caught on his last words, leaving Tony wondering if he was only just angry.
“You’re usually such a busy man, Captain. I’m surprised Nick let you out to play today,” Pierce said, clearly content in ignoring Tony’s presence for the moment.
"What if I hadn't been interested?" Tony catches at Steve's thighs as Steve kneels up. He's struck again by how intensely gorgeous and cut Steve is, every stretch and flex of muscle perfectly sculpted.
“And how long would Beta have stayed up if Captain Shipperke hadn’t heard the turbine?” Tony asked, bracing himself a little as he pushed off the turbine to slide down between its slating.
at me? That’s so cheesy, Rogers.” Tony replied teasingly. He rubbed his nose back at Steve’s and finished; “For the rest of my life,” he murmured, brushing a hand through Steve’s damp hair to clear his brow. Steve’s smile was small, his gaze soft, and Tony had never loved him more.
"You can take me for dinner too,” and okay, maybe Steve blew his mind a lot. Tony’s only human. And as Steve only laughs, Tony decides that’s okay.
“I’m dying,” Steve retorts, strained. “Tony, the suspense…”
“Tony, Tony, Tony. You’ve been a serious pain in my ass, boy,” Alexander said with a cluck of his tongue, “It’s finally time to put a stop to that.”
“Didn’t you have enough of it this afternoon?” His ring clicked against Tony’s. He hummed contently as Tony’s thumb swept up along the inside of his bicep.
“I should beat you black and blue,” Steve murmured, fingers framing Tony’s head to press behind his ears. He forced Tony’s chin up a sliver, earning a grunt. “Maybe if I mark you enough you’ll remember who you chose to belong to.”
“Hey, baby,” Bucky grins. “Did you have a good day?”
Tony gave Steve a look like the gender wasn’t the important part of the story, saying, “I told you, he was in my head, saying things, trying to fuck with me. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that he connected us somehow. I haven’t run into any other sorcerers than Scarlet Witch, and she would never do that to me.”
The room is quiet; their breathing is calm. There are no tears, no begging. Their eyes do not meet, and he is not made to endure pleading glances. The part of him that is aware of what is happening is grateful.
“No,” Tony answered, “but it’s pretty close.”
“Shit, shit, shit,” Tony spat, hoping to get to Crossbones before Captain America could interfere too much. It was in vain as the Captain’s weight landed on his legs. They hit the ground and Iron Man couldn’t correct his pattern before Captain America rolled off and grabbed him up by both legs. His suit screeched along the ground as Tony tried to twist around to fire across the Captain’s hands.
Tony licks his lips and knows that they were only ever safe in his hands. He can't trust that whomever is watching him won't make copies.
“Naw,” Steve drawled, backing away until he turned around to head for the elevator, “I get Siri to read them out loud.”
“Scans indicate inorganic materials within a restructured genetic sequence,” Jarvis replied.
“Anthony,” Victor began slowly, but Tony held up a hand.
His throat closed fully and he had to look away before he squeezed his eyes shut. The realization that it was Steve who’d come was a slow heat creeping up his neck. He’d called Steve instead of Victor, and he’d sealed his fate. There was no way Steve had arrived at the scene of the accident and not found-
“You tried to sleep with me.” Tony looked up at Steve again. “Knowing what you did, knowing the truth, and you still tried to sleep with me.”
“Thank you,” Steve said, kissing the back of Tony’s neck, arms secure around his waist.
Tony makes a noise of frustrated disgust and finally opens his faceplate. He’s scowling through a head wound that pours into his eyes. “It seems I made your suit a little too well.”
“I’m fine. I’m fine. Tony-”
Oh, yes. If the Captain had been brunette, Tony would have had him spread out on the table by now. He wondered idly at the sounds Rogers’ baritone could produce while he replayed his answer.
That is until Tony begins to notice that Steve, over the course of the next hour, is steadily inching closer to Tony in increments. Silent and never looking at Tony when Tony looks over, Steve has a datapad in his hands and a furrow in his brow. That’s enough for Tony to finally set his tools down.
“They don’t make the Cucinelli in the color basil, I’ve checked.” By that time, Tony was rigging up another panel into the pulley system. Strands of his hair began to slip down over the goggles, and he blew forcefully up at them. When that didn’t seem to work, he leaned into the paneling and used a combination of ducking his head and lifting his elbow to try and work the goggles up into his hair.
“If I went and did a crazy thing like cared, then I’d never get anything done. That’s what you heroes are for, isn’t it?” Iron Man drew a hand up to examine the fingers of his gauntlets, feigning nonchalance.
Against his better judgement and those instincts stirring, Tony stepped past Steve into the living room where the television was playing the news and the kitchen’s light illuminated the back of the couch. He turned towards the kitchen, observing the dark cloth on the floor and the table covered in strips of gauze and tape.
“Despite what you might think, it’s not to see you behind bars, Tony,” Fury said, crossing his arms. “Like I said, I’m here to offer you a paddle, if you think you could handle sitting down with me for five minutes to discuss it.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony replies, grinning just a little. “I have to make sur-”
“Strange; I didn’t think Tony Stark had a bad side.”
He calculates the distance from the bar's front door to the nearest alleyway, allowing for twenty seconds either way -- it depends whether or not the man will want introductions first -- to the moment he finds out what the man's smile tastes like. The air is balmy against his face, the sea air salting the breeze. It ruffles Tony's hair, displacing errant locks even further as Tony turns in the direction of his motel; he'd had to move out of the penthouse. Rumiko fills the lavish rooms like a spectre. It's consequently also the direction of the closest alleyway, and because he's a genius, the seconds tick down exactly as a large, guiding hand cups his elbow and all but drags him into the darkened alley.
"Fuck," he swears, and he feels that goddamn smile press against his shoulder through the leather jacket.
“Oh really?” Steve is grinning now and Tony can’t help but match it.
“I think it’s great,” Ty said, spreading his hands. “Clean it up a little and fix the sour notes in the chorus, and I think you’ll have another number one, Tones.”
Tony blinked at the sky behind Steve’s shoulder. When the burn of tears threatened, he turned his face to Steve’s neck and sighed, clenching his hands in the back of Steve’s shirt. He relaxed as Steve’s larger hands stroked down his spine in soothing passes.
“Peachy, all things considered. You didn’t come to the meeting.” Tony reached up to wipe the sleet from his face, pausing a moment to look at the red on his fingers.
"Who?" the word cracks and Tony knows he sounds scared and he desperately wishes he had his suit. "Steve, I… I don’t understand."
“Looks like you got a beast for a guard dog, Stark.” There was a sharp curse, and the fence shook as the soldier shoved the elf against the planks. It was hard, in the dark, to distinguish the elf’s dark clothes from his skin, but Stephanie was pretty sure she’d dream of those red eyes for the rest of her life.
He turned just as Steve’s palms slid up his stomach so they ended up on Tony’s back. Tony tipped his head back a little and kept the scowl from his face from practice. He covered Steve’s arms and traced the muscles there.
Luckily, Captain America had no problems with it.
Tony frowned and looked down at his hands. He scratched one thumbnail along his other thumb, opened his mouth once or twice, then shook his head.
Steve pushed the bowl away and gave Sam and the broadcast his attention.
“Steve,” Sam grasps Steve’s arm, expression grim, “They’re fighting Rhodey and Clint. Nat’s trying to power down Buck’s arm while Pepper distracts Tony from getting his suit.”
“Shit,” Tony breathed out, “getting fancy with medical terms, are we?”
His mother was cradling him. He blinked blearily up at her chin, her soft perfume wafting as she yelled. Howard was just out of the corner of Tony’s eyes, on the phone and rubbing his face as he paced.
The light in his chest is flickering.
Pepper laughs. “Tony, promise me you’ll behave. This man is expensive and I like him, so don’t waste his time.”
So at least Tony was relaxed when the truck rammed into him from behind on the overpass. His car spun on the slick road as the airbag deployed. He felt his thumb break under the impact and then the truck hit again, t-boning him on the driver side. Screeching metal rent the air and his car crashed into the concrete barrier, hitting it at just the right angle to arc up and over the barrier as it flipped.
Crossbones leant down, dragging Tony’s head up as he pressed his mouth to Tony’s ear to say in a rough attempt at a purr; “Or what, did you really think we didn’t know who you were behind that mask? God, you’re pretty pitiful without that thing. Bet you couldn’t even fight back without it.”
“Steve? Steve?!” Tony pushed at Steve’s shoulders, watching blood bloom against his fingers.
“Skip the origin story. I want present day,” Tony interrupted, settling his hands on the wheel and taking control of the car. He pushed the sleek vehicle faster through the D.C. traffic, heading for Dulles Airport (IAD).
Again.
Two weeks and a string of faceless dates, women and -for a surprising panic-inducing moment- men attending dinner and movies and strolls and clubs with Steve later, Tony’s done. He’s given up the ghost. He doesn’t even bother to acknowledge Steve’s date nights anymore.
“The degradation of the thorium’s chamber was accelerated due to external forces. According to the data, Jarvis pinpointed DNA not belonging to myself, Dr. Ross, or Dr. Banner. The genetic code has mutated due to radiation, though, so no concrete identifiers.”
Steve shrugged, taking a few moments to chew as he waved his hand. Tony ignored the endearing warmth at the sight and looked around the small café. He wasn’t much of a people watcher, but the café was close to SHIELD and a lot of personnel tended to pass through.
Tony laughed a little. “Okay, J, okay,” and flew back to D.C.
And through it all, he knew now that Tony had somehow managed to fall in love with him. The part of Steve that was terrified of what it all meant wanted to be callous, to call Tony out on an emotion that surely had to be fake. How could someone like Tony ever trust enough to fall in love?
“No, I just want to thank you for being willing to try. I know it’s a lot to ask so early,” Steve says quietly, leaning up to catch Tony’s mouth in a slow, lingering kiss.
“At the current levels, I calculate approximately five minutes before the containers fully erode.”
,” Pepper stresses and gives him a fond goodbye before they hang up.
Tony’s throat worked as he tried to speak, to move. He felt the sweat of battle and nerves roll down his neck and drip down his spine. Fear… He could taste fear in the back of his throat.
So when, thirty years later (okay, thirty-three, but who was counting to his face?), Captain Steven Rogers shook his hand firmly, coupled with a shy smile and blue eyes, Tony pushed his sunglasses back up the bridge of his nose and smirked.
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, hands squeezing the steering wheel until his knuckles were white and creaking. “Just… Send him another message about the shipments.”
Steve was biting his lip, hands in lap. “I’m not good at this either,” he admitted. “But I think we’re doing okay. We could just, uh, walk for a little bit? Don’t really need to...need to have a destination.”
“You knew that when you first started suspecting him, sir.”
“Fuck you,” Tony spat, and when Steve dropped his hands, Tony’s were buried in his hair with his head bowed. “I’ve been telling you since the beginning, and you didn’t believe me. We could’ve done this ‘working together’ thing you want so badly from the beginning. Instead, look at where we are. We’re fucked in the head, and you’re spouting this boyscout shit like I’m not a bad guy.”
Tony bit hard into his cheek again. It was either his imagination or Fury’s coat swished particularly angrily as he stalked down the hall and around the corner, muttering as he went. He turned back to the Captain, whose expression had gone narrow and thoughtful while Tony hadn’t been looking. It cleared almost instantly, but a second or two too slow.
It didn’t matter; she was already charging forward. It was perfectly fine for the cadets to pick on her, take out their fear and hate on her; she could handle it. But she refused to standby and watch them treat someone else that way. She couldn’t. Maybe it was from a deep-seeded desire for someone to stand up for her that pushed her forward.
Steve hadn’t thought he was capable of screaming anymore. As Tony falls first and Bucky turns the gun on himself, Steve is still screaming as the cryostasis completes and the ice takes him away from it all.
“That’s… That’s not what I want. I’m not here to change the way everything’s run. I just want to expose the truth,” Tony said fiercely.
“Fuck off, we’re not going down that route. You were fun once, but I was never stupid. You and I? There isn’t anything else. Just me helping keep you legitimate, and you helping me expose Pierce to the cruel, cruel world of justice.”
Steve tossed the gun down and crawled to Tony. He bent over, pressing their foreheads together.
He sees his recent memory banks of Tony and Pepper dissolve from his coding, schematics and strings of data dripping down like melting wax.
“Good. See you at the next meeting. We’ll be earning our Elderly badge.”
He takes those postcards and he mails them. Every single one. He never lets himself wonder if they're received.
“Yeah, that’s all. You got one shot and then it’s my turn.”
“And you’re about to be,” Sam smirks back and calls over his shoulder. “Steve, your two o’clock is here!”
He shoved his phone back into his pocket and shrugged.
Blood.
~~~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~~~
He sees approval in his creator's gaze when Tony traces Pepper's skin between the suit's fingers. His other hand is busy with his tongue, and Pepper tips her head back against Jarvis' shoulder, arches further, and moans huskily.
Victor watched Tony in silence for a moment then rolled his eyes again and pushed away from the desk to stand closer to the screen too, to stand closer to Tony. After a minute or two, he frowned and heard Tony hold his breath.
“What, ‘n’ get myself turned into a toad or somethin’? No fuckin’ way. Pierce don’t scare me near as much as that guy.”
In hindsight, Tony should’ve have seen it coming. Nothing ever good happened around Christmas. To be fair, though, he’d just been a kid, plagued with nightmares.
“Unless he can come back from a bullet to the brain, we’re good.”
He’s sidetracking himself again. The ambassador for some...place -Tony can’t think- asks Tony a question. Tony sweats it for a moment, thighs squeezing together, and rambles out an answer about the next step in flexible mesh for prosthetic joints.
“Mr. Stark, the man you’re currently treating to almost second base is Bucky Barnes. He runs the numbers and handles the inventory. Do you, um, mind if we let him get back to that?”
“Come on, Vic. Where the fuck are you?” he muttered, casting frantic glances between Steve and Pierce. He watched Steve take a step forward, swore, and grabbed at Steve’s uniform just as Pierce fired again. Without Tony to stop the momentum, Steve wheeled backward, tripped over Tony, and fell into the harbor.
- you’ve slaughtered here today?”
“Tomorrow night,” Pepper replied immediately, smiling. “His name is Steve an-”
“You’re such a bad liar,” Tony accuses, hiding his face in his hands. He laughs because there’s nothing else he can do and Steve squeezes his calf.
Steve smiles to himself, the notes picked out fluently and so easy and much more pleasing to his ears. The piano was always a soft spot as his mother had once tried to teach him. He hadn’t picked it up then, but he knows it would be all too easy now.
Tony gets a hand on Steve's chest, and he barely has to exert any pressure before Steve is stepping back. Desire is a good look on the man, Tony sees, pupils blown and lips bruised.
“Shut up,” Tony sighed, “Dr. Cho finished working with you under supervision. All I did was knock you out. And maybe broke a few things, like equipment and-” he lifted his cup to his lips, muttering the rest into his drink, “-bones.”
“Sir, that operation is untes-”
Tony put his head into his hands and scratched at his hair before coming back up on heavy sigh.
“At your word, sir,” Jarvis replied.
Unfortunately, it worked like a charm and Steve shoved Tony instinctively away. Tony stumbled from the force of it and was already turning on his heel as the mistake dawned on Steve.
He curled his hands into fists so even he couldn’t see them shake, and eventually, he was able to block it out and go back to work.
“Well, I wouldn’t call them full-fledged,” Tony hemmed, “Especially not Dum-E. He’s got that name for a reason, you know. He’s more like… half-fledged, still working on spelling ‘cat’.”
“I believed in him, though. Your father, I mean. I saw what he could do with those engines and I read about the work he’d done with the government that was never in the papers. He was… a brilliant, overwhelming force of unbridled thirst for knowledge and the future. On paper, he was a great man.
Pepper clicked her heels together as she closed her eyes. Maybe she’d wake up at home in bed. “You’re lucky I love you, Tony Stark.” She tapped out a message on her phone and hit send.
Tony’s crying again even though the panic has receded. Steve’s words are a warm weight on his heart and it hiccups through him as Steve kisses his brow. Then, he kisses one eye and then the other.
“Plus you think the swans are cute,” Tony grinned slightly.
Steve.
Steve laughs, teeth bright and expression still wholesome and clean cut even with their lustful activity. "And I want to be buried inside this ass, baby, I really do, but I don't have the patience to open you up right now."
Tony grit his teeth and compelled his broken body towards the side of the road again, hauling himself to the shotgun. His hands were freezing, his entire body shivering in the cold since his business suit had definitely not been made for crawling around in the dead of winter. So his grip was numb when he fumbled the shotgun up and around.
Add the fact that he’s down to his shorts and undershirt and Tony’s sure this is a punishment for skipping out on that meeting yesterday.
He groans at the freedom and braces one hand against the headboard. Steve leans up and mouths at Tony’s balls, the tip of his tongue running against them then dragging it flat up towards the shaft. Tony bares his teeth and jerks off, quick and messy, until his own orgasm tumbles through him a flash of hot, burning arousal. His come spills down along his cock and Steve’s face, catching his eyelashes and mostly his bruised, open mouth.
“Seriously? At least tell me you’ve gone on some dates,” Natasha nudged Steve with her foot. “You guys are ridiculously adorable. I might have a cavity.”
Candace lost her battle with the yawn and turned slightly to hide it behind her arm. “Oh, I’m sorry about that. No, not at all. Jim just finished setting up the bar, so it should be fine. Did you want a water while you wait?”
“If you start singing Chris-”
“So did Hitler,” Tony said casually, “but it’s all about perspective. They say crime is at an all-time low across the nation, but especially here on the East Coast, but that only means reported crime. They don’t talk about what won’t look good.”
“Yes, sir. Shall I respond to an-”
“Oh, Tony,” Steve says, voice still soft, intimate. His hand is gentle and warm when it brushes over Tony’s and through his hair to check his head. “Shh, it’s okay.”
“I do like Amara’s,” he muttered and was rewarded with a gentle squeeze to the nape of his neck. He rolled his eyes and muttered; “Yeah, fine. Whatever. Just...tell me when.”
“If I say yes, will you vote for me?” Tony asked, batting his lashes at Steve. The effect was muted due to the sunglasses he’d finally put on, but Steve still rolled his eyes.
Stephanie bit the inside of her cheek, but didn’t answer. It didn’t matter who started it. It wouldn’t stop, and she believed that she’d one day be able to fight back properly to where it would. Whining to the General about the men stealing her stuff wouldn’t do her any good.
He's almost frantic with how fast he's throwing them all in and his breathing is stuttered, panicked.
. He scoffed at the sight.
“The repulsors are hollow,” he realized flatly. “They don’t have your miniaturized reactors.”
At ten years old, the pills were a last resort. Sneaking them from his mother’s medicine chest, he learned one was enough to get him to sleep quickly, but not sleep through the nightmares. Four pills had him throwing up violently in his bathroom. He yelled at the butler for spoilt milk, and he refused assistance when the maids came.
A sharp, piercing pain tore through Steve’s daze, sending blazing needles all along his spine down to his toes. He wanted to jerk, to squirm, to cry out, but his body wouldn’t move, his mouth slack under the mask. The monitors behind the nurses remained steady, if not a little elevated, and Steve was on fire. Moments like these, when time slowed down to a fevered crawl and where he knew nothing but agony, he could absolutely understand why Tony wanted to watch the world burn.
“Enough!” The Captain ran, intersecting Iron Man’s path and slamming him into the ground.
“Victor.”
“I trust you,” Steve says thickly. “Tony.”
It isn’t the first time, he remembers that. He remembers stiff fingers plucking at the fabric and almost, almost…
A reporter was speaking from offscreen, a different language to the English captions that lagged five seconds behind their speech. Steve didn’t need those, though. He understood exactly what was happening. The East Coast was welcoming its first official candidate for office against the incumbent Pierce since he’d stepped in to take charge.
Even he couldn’t help making a face afterwards.
Steve tracked Iron Man’s position from beneath the blindfold, listening to the solid, heavy step of the suit as it walked around him. His skin was damp, and it felt tacky under Tony’s inexorable gaze, but he tried not to pay attention to that either. It was harder to do that when a drop of sweat slid down the last dip of his stomach and over his pelvic bone, disappearing into the dark hair showcasing his cock.
"Doctor Doom hasn't been seen for sometime, then you're detained and suddenly he's popping back up? Get back inside, Stark, before I carry you myself."
“It’s a love song,” he answered. “Now, who can tell me about the Manhattan Project from their review last night?”
Tony smirked into the camera, letting his hand rest and, for a moment, his red fingers tapped out the
“Coulson says you haven’t eaten since you got to work,” Steve said, nudging the tray a little closer.
“Answer me!” He rounded on Tony in the lab and Tony tried to shrink back.
“Ready the course for Latveria,” Tony muttered as Captain America dropped to the ground from the jet hovering safely above the crime scene. He guessed he’d be acting the part a little longer.
“We’re gettin’ low on mixer,” Bucky drawls and Tony shoots up from his seat to take the excuse.
“I’ve been watching you all night, and you never even came to say hi. You can’t still be mad about the song,” Ty said, dragging his nose up Tony’s neck to whisper the mournful-toned words against Tony’s mouth. “It was just business. You didn’t have to take it out on us. I thought you loved me.”
Not just any drawer, but the very same drawer that houses a letter and a phone.
“Mr. Stark?”
“It’s fine. I’m fine. Just.
for them?! Why? Why do you do this to yourself?!”
“Oh, Tony. Tony. Tony. Tony,” Ty sighed and pushed Tony facedown across the bed. “It’s amusing to me how you think you still have a choice, even after all this time. Don’t worry, you’ll enjoy it. You always did before.”
“You keep saying that, Tony, but you’ve got no proof. Director Pierce has done nothing to try and get to you since you’ve been here. There’s no sabotage, no funny business, nothing. Your theory is drowning in dead weight with nothing to support it.”
The heavy steps stopped, and Steve’s head was forward, facing Tony standing right in front of him. There was silence only interrupted by the near-inaudible hum of the sounding rod and Steve’s forceful, controlled breaths.
"Yes," Steve moans, the sound catching and hitching in his throat. "Yes, Tony, that's it. Make me come so you can do that. I wanna feel you mark me up, jerk off on me, claim me."
There’s a moment of silence, and Rhodey watches Tony look around the destruction of their fight. Bucky is pushing to his feet over a prone Clint, tossing an arrow to the ground, too far away now to be an immediate concern. Natasha’s yell is audible even without comms. Rhodey’s stomach churns violently, fear quaking down his spine.
Victor said by way of greeting, and Tony closed his eyes.
“Is that what happened at the car accident?” Fury asked seriously, leaning forward now and pushing the bowl of peanuts out of the way. “It was the big guy, right? Crossbones? He got to you out of your suit, didn’t he?”
He heard Rogers shift, a small intake of breath just a little sharper than normal. He glanced over at Rogers and raised his brows.
Howard’s furious expression softened, features smoothing out until Tony, trembling and uncertain, began to relax a little. Howard tilted his head and contemplated his fingers around Tony’s slender arm. He sighed and Tony recoiled a little with the odor of alcohol.
Stark’s lip curled faintly and stepped forward to reach for a lock of the General’s hair that had fallen from the tight bun. Tucking it behind Peggy’s ear, Stark said, “It’s this smart mouth that’s kept me alive here. And it’s this,” Stark poked Peggy’s chest, “that keeps me here. I hope this plan of yours doesn’t backfire,
"I wouldn't have much longer," Steve admits, cheeks flushed and eyes barely open as he meets Tony's gaze. "I would've hoped you'd go to the bathroom and then cornered you in there. I was thinking about getting you in a stall and sucking your dick until you came on my tongue and face."
“Your enemy possesses great strength, a strength that does not belong to him, to any human. I wonder if you’ll be strong enough to stop him destroying your world.”
Steve is calmer now, hands still at his sides, but Tony sees that his pulse is no longer beating madly in his throat.
“You started it,” Steve accused without heat. He watched Tony’s gaze swing his direction then dart away, “The elevator… That was yours, not mine. I-I think I just helped shape it. You wanted to get sushi.”
The flu. Tony had had the flu back near the beginning of their relationship. He crushed the cup. He’d been such an idiot. Castle was right; Tony had gone so soft from Steve’s boyish charm that he hadn’t even remembered his number one rule: never trust anyone. He’d thrown that rule out the goddamn window and had somehow allowed himself to not think about how this would all end. And now, now Tony’s secret was one unopened case away from being 100% proven true, and his heart was being ground to dust under Steve’s reinforced running shoe.
But he can’t make himself move and their laughter is still ringing in his hears and he just wants to cry.
Steve shoved him forcibly into the table, pupils blown and breathing uneven.
Fury grabbed another handful of peanuts. “Is it too early to get a margarita?”
,” Steve panted against Tony’s mouth. Tony’s nerve-endings sparked and fired, sending him into a dizzying orgasm that left him gasping and clenching around the last few strokes Steve made.
"Can't even find it in my-" but what Tony couldn't find, Steve didn't know and wouldn't know as he jerked suddenly as the elevator announced its arrival on his floor. He blinked his eyes open dazedly as the doors slid open.
Steve shoved his ribboned fingers into Tony's mouth, thrusting into Tony at the same time, his hips a sharp and snapping pace against Tony’s ass.
And Tony could never resist Steve begging. He licks his lips and gets more of lube on his fingers so he can liberally coat the sound. He’s careful to keep gripping the dry end so he can keep a good hold on it. For Steve’s first time, he’s not going to go too deeply.
Now, all Tony wanted to do, was curse and push Ty away. His arms twitched. He wanted to find a shower and scrub his skin off everywhere Ty dared to touch him. He couldn’t force his legs to move.
He sighed heavily, letting it be swept silently away by the music. That’s when he noticed the wafting scent of caffeine. He tensed, but didn’t turn around, already knowing it was one of two people who would dare to bother him in his clearly foul mood.
Steve
“I...I guess you’re right,” Stephanie said, frowning. She kept checking over her shoulder to make sure the men weren’t following.
“No!” Tony nearly shouted. “No, it’s okay. You can walk me.” Then he pressed his face to his hands and laughed. “It’s too far to walk. Okay, I’m apparently really bad at this.”
"They’re one and the same, I must isolate you," Steve replies and he sounds like he’s made a decision. Tony’s chokes back a sob and closes his eyes before the blow comes.
“I’m cleaning up the mess you’re in,” Victor answered, “Now, if you don’t mind, there is the small matter of Anthony-”
Tony’s panting in time with him, still stroking in counterpoint to the sound moving inside, still easing his fist along Steve’s slick shaft.
“Overreact much?” he asked dryly.
"Done wh-" oh.
Tony cups Steve's knees as they frame his waist, fingers dipping into the crease of his knees then sliding up the ridiculous muscles of his thighs.
Across the country, Steve stares at the television while Peggy pours a glass of wine.
Steve spends the whole night telling Tony it wasn't his fault, chaste and comforting as he held Tony tight. "God has his ways," Steve murmurs, "they're not always plain in the face, but he does. You know she's in a better place, but there's nothing wrong with mourning the loss of her brightness. As long as you can forgive yourself."
"Sweet dreams," he said to himself with a roll of his eyes. By the time he showered and fell into bed, he’d pushed the weird dream to the back of his thoughts.
Steve pondered that then shook his head.
"You so-"
“Can never be sure in our line of work.”
Tony smiled, fingers tapping against his jaw. “Yeah, let’s do that.”
“I’m quite sure,” Victor replied, shifting to stand in front of Tony and pluck at the hem of his shirt where most of the dark stain of blood had settled. Tony inhaled sharply as the shirt was drawn up, but said nothing. He watched the slope of Victor’s nose, the sweep of his lashes, and felt his lip curl.
“I honestly don’t see why I should even bother, brother. He’s obviously freed himself of most of the bindings. I’m sure the rest are no problem for him.”
“I’m still not letting you get me naked, Tony,” Steve said over his shoulder as he disappeared into the kitchen. “You should be pulling together all of your notes anyway. You left them all over the floor upstairs.”
"I don't care," Tony growled, barely slowing down as he watched the agent with the armor. Steve caught him by the bicep, and his grip jerked Tony back a couple steps.
“Yeah, um. Totally...down for that. Dinner is great, I love dinner.” He puts his hands back on his face and takes a steadying breath, tries not to sound so pathetically eager. “Mr. Rogers, I’ve changed my mind on my suit style.”
“So?” Pepper countered as she picked her way around the small towers of boxes littering Tony’s apartment floor. “Oh, Tony. You haven’t even started signing the cases.” She muttered that mostly to herself, because bemoaning the fact wouldn’t actually get her anywhere with Tony.
“You’re catching my bad side.”
But Steve presses Tony back down against the bed and kneels up. Like a fucking Greek God or something, Tony really is drunk, Steve is backlit by the lights in the outer rooms of the suite; The light bounces around off the decorative mirrors on the bureaus in the bedroom and casts Steve in attractive shadows, drawing Tony's eyes to the hard length of Steve's cock.
"Oh." And Jarvis can see every angle of the way her lips shape the breathless realization. "That's... Okay then..." And Tony's kissing her again, deeper this time, and she's using the suit to arch against.
Steve gently touched Tony’s chin before dropping his hand. “It’s best to wait. I don’t want to rush things either, and I think you might just be worth waiting for.”
Pepper sighed and said through her teeth: “Fine. You can
“You’re so very stubborn, Captain,” Tony mused. “I can’t say I’m surprised, but I’m a little frustrated with our progress.”
“Oh, look at that fire in your eyes.” Alexander crouched down and pulled on Tony’s head with a hand in his hair. “I always loved that expression on you. Just a shame you couldn’t contain it to the bedroom. I tried to be so good to you.”
“Once upon a time, you were just a piss-poor diplomat. So, if you’re not going to let me drown my injuries in alcohol, then yeah, you better put that mouth of yours to better use instead of bringing up shit from our past that neither of us wants to actually discuss. Or would your pride prevent you?”
Because Steve allowed it, the other operatives were able to separate them when they arrived. Tony bared his lip at the realization as Fury stalked to stand between them. The redheaded agent from the airstrip stepped up slightly behind Steve, silent, and Tony dragged his gaze from her to Fury.
The kiss was dizzying, consuming in its heat and possessive. It stole Tony’s worries and left him thinking of nothing but Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve who had managed to open him on three slick fingers, who had him squirming against the sheets, who was breathing words into Tony’s skin.
“Just satisfactory?” Steve asks. “We were kind of hoping for spectacular.”
“I’m afraid not, sir.”
Steve stilled for a moment in confusion then huffed in amusement. Right. Shouldn’t have worn the white shirt. He’d forgotten about the black marker.
“Steve, I-”
The announcement threw the crowd into an uproar while Tony looked on grimly. Steve saw Sam down another shot and sit down heavily, scrubbing a hand through his short hair. Steve couldn’t agree more; if Tony was right about Pierce, then revealing the nature of their deaths was nothing short of his own death sentence.
It's a spectacularly bad idea. The whiskey doesn't even burn anymore as he swallows it down, down to the bottom of his second bottle. Not that anyone would notice or care; certainly not the bartender whom Tony is sure to tip well. The guy's gotten used to seeing Tony these past few weeks, knows Tony isn't there to cause trouble or get sloppy drunk.
“We haven’t gotten that far yet,” Steve muttered, blushing.
He folds his cards, pushes them towards the discarded mess by Bruce’s elbow. The play continues past him and Rhodey’s mockingly saluting Steve as he takes the pot and it’s been another five minutes and, still, Tony finds his opinion not sought, his input not needed.
Tony’s hand spasmed around the cup, the paper crinkling a little. He remembered everything. It wasn’t as if it had been the most traumatic experience he’d ever had, but the pain was still fresh in his mind with the very real belief that he’d been about to die in a ditch on the side of the road.
“Pepper!” Steve barely gets her name out before another gun goes off.
“Jarvis,” he croaked as he turned the sink on and splashed his face with water, trying to resist the urge to drown himself under the faucet.
“When did you go through my home?”
“Is that all, sir?”
“Vy znayete parametry svoyey missii.”
Tony’s cock throbs in response and he begins to carefully stroke Steve’s cock, fingers steady from the base up along his shaft.
Before Tony even saw the Doombots, he heard their attacks. The whine of their hydraulics was only tempered by the proceeding explosions. Across the HUD, calculations began running for possible dead zones contingent on the Doombots’ location. A square formed in the upper right of Tony’s vision.
“It’s going to be okay,
“Stay in the bed for at least tonight. Who knows what I did to you,” Tony said dryly, then he patted Iron Man’s shoulder, said ‘Night Guard Protocol, code Alpha-5-30-86-03,’ then went to leave. Iron Man’s eyes lit up as his joints whirred him into position to be on guard near the door.
“Captain Rogers, hello.”
Natasha merely hummed, watching Stephanie closely. “Your eyes are very blue, like the sky, like the ocean. Both open and promising more of life.”
Black, as he was dragged back into silence.
If you asked Tony today what he’d said in response, Tony wouldn’t be able to tell you. It was a blur of begging, terror, and tears. At ten years old, he’d been no match for his father. So when Howard hauled Tony over the metal press, Tony had pissed himself in fear.
"No, I appreciate that," Steve replies. The welcome is drawing thin. Tony gets up to leave. He walks to the door, and Steve stands behind him.
“Three people do not a meeting make, Stark. There were a lot of people who didn’t show. Can you blame me?”
Steve licks and sucks at Tony's cock, the tip of his tongue tracing every vein and throb until he finally, finally, presses the flat of it against the underside and closes his mouth around the head. He pulls Tony's hips up just as he starts sucking at the tip, and Tony can barely keep the moan from being embarrassingly loud.
to touch me with the hands that caved my father's face in and pulled the goddamn trigger against his head. And you were happy." Tony slinks into Steve's space, movements manic, tone wet and hollow with suppressed rage. Steve can't speak; his tongue is too thick, his throat too raw.
He tastes it in the back of his throat. Sharp and metallic, it lines the edge of the shield leaning ominously beneath the curtains.
“Bite on this,” Clint said, working Tony’s belt free from his pants.
“You used yourself against me,” Tony whispered, and he hadn’t meant to sound as betrayed as he felt. He was sure on some morality scale, he wasn’t allowed this feeling, but he couldn’t stop it. It swept over him in unceasing waves, stealing his hearing on every second pump of his heart. “You made me think-”
He turns to Bucky.
Tony Stark learned his first worldly lessons from the inside of a cereal box. First, anything or anyone can be used as a weapon.
- "Handlebars" by Flobots
He can see Tony's head turn towards a monitor, can almost 'feel' his creator's eyes in his schematics like a physical touch. He knows that Tony can see the code, can see what Jarvis wants without the consciousness to want it.
Steve snorted.
Iron Man had done that. Not the imposter or Crossbones, but Iron Man. He’d hurt Captain America. Tony had hurt Steve. That knowledge was a pit in Tony’s stomach, a gnawing guilt as he stood outside the apartment complex where Steve lived. The bracelet containing his suit’s signal was heavy on his wrist as he lifted his hand to press Steve’s buzzer.
Tony couldn’t even open his eyes then, but the beat was softer. It didn’t hurt as much. Ty must have finally turned it down. He should thank him.
“Just imagine what dessert will be like.” Steve’s smile is addictive and sweet. Tony stares at him and notes his eyes are the color of the fabric he’d liked so much.
All it took was one rippling shift of the cellular nanites in the suit, and Steve was like an untrained dog, rutting forward against Iron Man’s leg, grunting one curse then another as his motions dragged the metal rod against the alloy. Tony gave a mechanical hum and set the sounding rod off.
Joke's on him. Tony always leaves sloppy drunk, but he's Anthony Goddamn Stark, and no one will ever be able to accuse him of being drunk in public.
“It’s okay, Tony,” she was promising. “The paramedics are on the way. I’m going to call Steve.”
“Thanks, J. Oh… On the topic of other topics, talk to me about Captain Steve Rogers.”
“Tony!”
When they walk back out into the dining area, everyone is gone, but Steve doesn’t seem surprised. He takes Tony’s hand and leads him out and into the living room where everyone is piled on the floor among pillows and blankets. They all look over when Steve pulls Tony into the room.
~~~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~~~
“I mean! I guess! Ugh!” Tony kept cutting himself off, and Steve shrugged out of his sports coat. “Look, I’ll admit it: she’s got an amazing voice and…and the way they composed it is…”
The thing was, he hadn’t known Ty could hurt him in the first place. He’d never imagined.
Margaret Carter, Tony thinks, the attractive brunette with the killer red lipstick and heart of a good woman. She's like Tony's mother, soft spoken, but firm, and perfectly perfect just like Steve.
“It’s… It’s not only about the weapons, Nick,” Tony said, tapping a finger on the table in a slow pattern. “They’re taking the activists, the people… He’s selling them off or killing them when they get too loud or too close. I’m doing my best, but.”
There’s a brief flash of embarrassment, but he nods and Steve helps him get up and helps to make sure he doesn’t look a mess.
“Tony, I understand why you feel like you couldn’t say anything,” Steve murmurs. “And I’m sorry that we made you feel this way, intentionally or not.”
Rogers made a face and kind of flapped his hand in indecision. “Do kids these days still stick baseball cards in their bicycle spokes?”
Jarvis can pinpoint the exact moment when everything changes, when Ms. Potts becomes Pepper, and when the always-careful space between a controlled suit becomes a hand on an alloy shoulder, a nudge of her elbow as if to share in her exasperation over his creator. His creator. Their Tony... Tony...
He takes the package and barely get a 'thank you' out around the lump in his throat. He flees, walks to an edge of the courtyard where the viewing tables are sat.
They shouldn’t have been operating, that was easy enough to tell. It had only been the magic moving them along. More of a hollow, empty shell than any of the robots Tony had ever worked on, and he hated it. It left him feeling empty, too, like he’d been the one hollowed out and manipulated.
“Awesome, I’m a step ahead of the others then since I fixed your leg.” Ronin flashed him a thumbs up, beginning to slide Crossbones back towards the overpass. Tony figured Ronin would probably make his getaway with Crossbones’ truck.
He doesn't need to look to know that the other man has followed suit, so he shoves his arms into the leather and rolls his shoulders to adjust the sit of it. There's a wall of heat at his back that collides with the warmth of the whiskey in his gut. His skin prickles in fierce anticipation, but he knows from years of practice that his features are calm.
It certainly felt like a promise.
Tony closed his eyes.
“You need to start caring, Rogers, because there’s no telling how he’ll react when he wakes up. We don’t know shit about his true personality. We only know what he’s chosen to show us. On both sides.”
“I hate you, Barton,” Tony decided, trying to at least start to sit up, but he felt like none of the messages he was sending to his limbs were reaching their destinations.
“Mama?” He asked, voice hoarse with pain. “Mama?”
“Can I walk you home?” Steve asked then flushed himself. He cleared his throat. “I...Sorry, I guess you have a driver, right? That was stupid of me.”
“Yes.” Bucky swallows.
“Sir?” Jarvis said in his ear, “Your vitals are quite elevated. Perhaps you need some fresh air.”
“Yeah. Yeah, if he’s dead, I’m perfect.”
"I'll miss you, Tony," Steve  murmurs, and Tony dares to briefly touch Steve's shoulder. Then, the door is shutting between them, and Tony is taking the stairs down out of the apartment because he doesn't have the focus to dam the well of emotion before Steve's betrayal sinks into his bones and leaves him crying in the stairwell.
“Tony,” Steve called, having not moved from where they’d been standing by the counter. His hands hung at his sides, fingers slightly curled. Tony licked his lips, his own hand on the doorknob. “I’m asking you to trust me.”
Tony could barely catch his breath, stunned at Steve’s words. His heart raced, betraying him to Steve’s ears, and the chuckle at his ear was proof enough.
"Make me come on your cock, Tony," Steve whispers, encourages, demands, as he presses his mouth open and hot against Tony's jaw. "I can see it in your eyes, Tony. You didn't turn me down, so take it. It's yours."
. “Oh, Gods. I’m sorry. I don’t mean to stare.”
Tony pushed a hand through his hair, feeling suddenly very old and very worn out. The broken nose was throbbing and his bruised eyes felt puffy. He was sure he was a sight, but he’d deliberately not made eye contact with himself in the mirror. He’d stopped doing that years ago.
He thinks he used to care.
A creak and a yank that pulled Tony forward, and then pain bloomed across his face and left him reeling as he blinked at the sudden sunlight. It was blue, so blue, and at the last moment, Tony managed to turn his palms away as the repulsors fired at a capacity they shouldn’t have been capable of. He hit the corner of the Home Depot and the parking lot of cars around it.
“Missing persons,” Tony supplied. He stepped past Steve when they reached his car. Opening the door, he turned to face Steve. “Activists. Rioters. Disagreeables, I think Pierce once called them. Anyone old enough to buck utopia’s system. If they aren’t old enough, then their parents.”
“Rebar…” Tony stepped between Steve’s legs to hold Steve’s head to his chest, fingers brushing through his blond hair. “Rusted rebar… Fucking Christ...”
She was just so tired.
“You think you’re clever,” Steve mused, low and tense. He felt the warmth of that foray against the back of his neck even though they were in the dim, red-lit room of some vaguely-formed basement. If Tony could see, he’d probably pout and glance at Steve with a pitiful, pleading expression. It was one of the reasons Steve had returned the favor and blindfolded him.
He'd offered himself up to Tony, tried for low and inviting while Sam had choked on the blood brought up from the metal fist in his gut. Tears streaking down his face, Steve had begged Tony to take him, use him however he'd like, just -
“Don’t act like you wouldn’t have enjoyed yourself. Why do you think it was so easy to start dating you? Like I couldn’t read every thought playing in that twisted mind of yours the moment we met. You’ve got no ground here, so just open the goddamn case, Tony!”
“SHIELD strike teams incoming,” Jarvis announced. “You have approximately one minute.”
Tony offered up a grin, touching a hand to his own chest in mock-offense. “What? You have something against spelling ‘cat’? I’ll have you know that I was the smartest speller Ms. Lorenzo had ever seen in her years at Christ Episcopal.”
Honestly, Tony's not surprised to hear they've been fucking this whole time too. He's just surprised that his heart hadn't known.
They progress. Tony strips Pepper like a precious gift, kissing and leaving a trail of shiny skin along every few inches of Pepper's body as it's revealed.
“Ah, yes. Well, I just…”
It could prove useful later, but Tony would need some time to think it through properly.
Tony poured the scotch into his glass until it just kissed the rim. “Don’t judge me,” he muttered to Victor, to anyone really, and bent a little to slurp the whiskey away from the top of glass. Successfully stopping any risk of spillage that way, he picked up his drink and turned around.
“Hi, good morning, folks! My name’s Candace, and I’ll be taking care of you this morning. May I start you off with water or something else to drink?” She smiled, but it wobbled a little as she clearly tried to stave off a yawn. She set a fresh basket of rolls on the table with a couple appetizer plates.
“I don’t go to them anymore,” Steve replied, following Tony into the kitchen. When Tony turned to look at him, Steve was gingerly pulling his shirt over his head. Tony had to grip the back of the chair at the table. Steve’s entire left side and across his stomach were mottled in bruises already so dark that Tony could barely see the blood around the puncture wound in Steve’s gut.
That earned a brighter smile from Steve, and Tony felt his breath catch a little. Before he could stop himself, he asked; “You’re a History teacher, right? I bet that’s fun.”
Jarvis can pinpoint it all down to the exact millisecond. Pepper's hand slides down over the silver shoulder plate as she takes her heels off, using him for balance. Jarvis thinks 'him', and he buries a string of code that wishes he could feel the slide of her fingers.
... He
,” Steve all but begs.
There is implied non-con in this chapter.
“Why them?” he whispers, eyes burning from the raw, putrid emotion stripping him down to nothing. “Why them and not us?”
“Missy?” Tony called out, unsure. His cereal no longer tasted right, not like the artificial sweeteners his palate enjoyed, but bitter and concentrated. His stomach clenched again. He struggled to push back from the table as his skin became damp.
Ronin didn’t look like he was going to give up, and Tony rushed to get the heavy shotgun cocked properly. When Crossbones gave a loud roar of anger, the energy crackled and Ronin swore.
The mask was good, but it still was hard to keep track of the heat signatures as Stark was pulled out of the bed and dropped onto the floor. Clint spied the first energy blast from Stark’s wrist, missed the second one that slammed another guy into a wall, and saw the third drop another to the floor. When Stark scrambled to his knees,  someone grabbed his wrist and yanked it backwards, most likely grinding bones together, until a fist took him under a heavy blow.
Tony laces their fingers together across the bowl of mashed potatoes and promises Steve that he’ll take care of the rest.
. They don’t know. They don’t think. They don’t ask. They don’t
“What do they do?” Tony asked instead of acknowledging Steve’s last statement. Anger surged through his veins as he anticipated Steve’s answer. “The doctors, what do they do?”
“Yes, thank you.”
A door slammed shut as Tony tried to break through the haze of disorientation, feeling like his limbs were weighted down, like his head was in the clouds with a wet towel wrapped around it. There had been voices around him, but he couldn’t make sense out of the words. He thought he reached out at one point, but nothing reached back.
Steve’s distraction costs him the footing he’d made with Bucky, and he’s thrown two blocks away with the concussive force of the impact. He loses sight of Bucky. Clint loses an eye and two of his fingers, but he’s still standing between Rhodey’s broken suit and Tony as he crawls out of the hole. The arrow that’s notched is covered in blood, and Clint’s aim is steady.
It was hectic, chaotic, perfectly imperfect. It was the best month and a half of Steve’s life.
“Vy khotite ispol'zovat' naruchniki?” he asks, and receives only an absent nod as Tony strides over to the window across from where Steve will hang.
“God, that stuff must be strong if it’s got you of all people grimacing.” The seat beside Steve was being filled and the smile came easily to Steve’s face.
“Tony,” he murmured, sliding his fingers into Tony’s hair, “Tony, please. I’m fine.”
“Can you feel how hard you are anymore?” Steve wondered, “You’ve been hard for so long. I know it began to run together for me. This must feel like torture.”
“Do you really think I haven’t played this game before, fellas?” he’d scoffed, sauntering around the end of the bed to
“Ostavit' yego zhivym bylo by oshibkoy,” the asset responds. “I yeye?”
“Yet,” Tony said, leaning back against the bar and rolling his head side to side to loosen up the tightness in his shoulders. “Jarvis will plow through the blockers soon enough. I’ve got him focused on that while Friday takes over D.C.”
Tony felt his tears increase until he was sobbing, chest heaving with his pain. “He left me, Mama. H-He said he wouldn’t e-ever and he-” He cut himself off, rolling over to throw himself into his mother’s lap. He buried his face against the expensive satin of her mourning gown and cried through his sorrow.
Tony can feel him now. Steve’s presence is a solid wall of negative space slightly behind Tony’s right. He thinks wildly that he should run, but his legs won’t move.
“It is currently 6:34a.m., sir, and you’ve been asleep for nearly four and a half hours. Your vital signs are slightly elevated and your toxicity levels are normal.”
“I love you,” Steve eventually sighs out. “And whenever you’re in the room, I am always, always aware of you. You’re a very important part of me, Tony. And you’ll always be a very important part of us. Even when it doesn’t feel like it. When that happens, do what you need to do, baby, and I’ll be right behind you to remind you how much we love you.”
His muscles are jerking, body gradually becoming overstimulated. One by one, the elevator empties until Tony is left with Pepper, panting heavily.
Tony knew exactly where Pierce was going with that, and he clasped his fingers together as he raised his brows. He hadn’t brought it up to Steve yet, so he wasn’t going to be the one to initiate the conversation there either.
Tony looked away from Steve and over the table of scraps. Maybe he would have to go to drastic measures then. Maybe he needed to make it easier.
“How many does he have to kill before you realize how bad an idea that is?”
“I’m pretty sure you’re the one not getting it, buddy,” Frank Castle said from the left side of the room. He stood at the windows, barely looking at the others in the room and really only glaring at Iron Man when he did. “You’re killing just as many as you’re saving.”
"You have enemies on the inside, Tony," Steve says against Tony’s ear and smiles in the dark as he feels his lover shiver. "I’m protecting you from them."
“You should stay-”
“Sir!” Jarvis exclaimed and Tony looked around to see Crossbones finally staggering towards his dropped weaponry.
“It’s a panel,” he decided and blinked when Rogers lifted his hands to him. “Um.”
“Now, now, Captain. SHIELD holds exclusive contracts with SI, so you can have the pleasure of my… company anytime you’d like.” And didn’t that just garner a delightful shade of pink to dust the Captain’s cheek and nose?
Behind Ty and his desk was a large poster of the cover of Tony’s first album, dated for when it went platinum. Tucked in the corner of the poster’s frame was a strip of those cheesy pictures people took in booths.
“Why isn’t he here? I could definitely use his help,” Iron Man pointed out.
There was a soft huff of warm amusement against his ear and then: “I understand how angry it makes you, but I really wish you’d stop breaking the radio. I’ve replaced it twice now.”
At Victor’s raised brows, Tony rolled his eyes. “Okay, that sounded better in my head.”
Victor startled a bit at Tony’s outburst, raising his brows in surprise, but Tony just scoffed in disgruntled impatience and stretched for the remote. He was nowhere close to reaching it, so Victor rolled his eyes and took up the remote again to rewind the footage until Tony made a flailing gesture that Victor supposed meant stop.
“I was going to make this slow and painful, but as usual, you’re just making a mess of everything.”
“They don’t normally. The host recognized me.”
His aim was off, shaky like the rest of him, but the gun didn’t fire. Blood was starting to form on the bowstring and it was clear Ronin was going for the garrote, but Crossbones’ entire body shuddered and his head was engulfed in that same energy it had been the day of the Port attack.
A second later, the EMP field launched. For a moment, Tony’s entire world blotted out, losing hearing and vision inside the suit. His heart seized, but only briefly, before his auxiliary power flickered on through the arc reactor. The mechanics in his suit were a bit stiffer in this mode, but it would have to suffice as he shifted clunkily off the deadened bodies of the bots. His joints whined and protested, but he managed to kneel beside the pile, uncaring of the scraping of his suit on the ground.
“Oh my god. We’re not even… No, that’s not,” Steve spluttered and hid his face in his hands.
“Anthony, there’s always been the good guy, bad guy role between us, and until you came to try your hand at being good, you were a lot more fun too,” Victor replied, tilting his head. His hair stayed perfectly arranged, no spare strands to slide or slip over his brow.
He's pressed forward against one brick wall, and Tony dismisses introductions in favor of a grunt the melts into a groan as a half-hard cock grinds forward into the swell of his ass.
“Tony!”
Tony tilted his head and couldn’t stop the smile that started to stretch his mouth. The threat of it bit into his cheek and crinkled his eyes.
“Yes, definitely. I’ve seen what you can do and I have to say I’m jealous that you worked on my friends and they waited so long to tell me,” Tony says, following Steve as he leads them back to the fitting stations. One is opened and ready for them. It’s spacious and comfortable with a steady, foundation for Tony to step onto when he’s ready. There’s a plush chair in the corner and the decor is simple and tasteful.
“Start talking,” Tony said through his teeth. He sat down with a clunk, using the sweat rolling down his forehead to slick his hair back for the hundredth time since he’d begun working. Then, he used his discarded shirt to wipe at his brow.
, “me. There’s nothing really special about me...Natasha.” Stephanie felt the nervous urge to wring her hands, but she kept them at her sides.
Steve ducks his head just for a moment then lifts it with a smile that makes Tony’s heart skip a beat. His palms start to get clammy in anticipation.
“Because I’m the only one who’ll actually pull the goddamn trigger.”
Before Steve.
His hand closes around the phone and he grits his teeth so hard that they creak. 'Stop doing this to yourself.'
“I’m here with spare time. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t let him monopolize that time with kindergarten questions.”
“Your methods have been crude.” That statement came from the Scarlet Witch, beautiful and cold, where she perched on the end of the sole piece of furniture in the room. The table was only stable because she wanted it to be, and she’d definitely raised the temperature in the warehouse upon her arrival. She gave Tony chills, but Iron Man was rather fond of her in an ‘aww they grow up so fast’ sort of way.
A movie is set to play on the entertaining center and Natasha is holding her hand out to Tony, a small smile curving her mouth.
He feels happy. He feels...
Shock is powerful thing, Steve knows, but his gaze goes over her shoulder. Tony approaches, helmet under his arm. His expression is drawn, pale. For a moment, Steve feels hope -bittersweet- that maybe the shock of Rhodey’s death has snapped Tony out of his brainwashing.
Steve groans, the sound punched from his gut as he jerks back against the plug, grinds against Tony's hand as Tony presses the plug deep as he can. He twists it, and Steve emits a low enough noise to avoid being a whine.
A few moment later, Sam drops Steve’s shield and a comm into Steve’s waiting hands as he lands.
Later that evening, Steve had finally finished filing his field report, having gone through three versions until he could objectively detail what had happened. He’d had to keep scratching out his anger at Tony and the fear he’d felt hearing Tony’s agonized screams and the terror in his expression when the faceplate had finally come free. He’d worked the worst of his reactions out on a few punching bags in the gym before the exhaustion finally pulled him out and into the elevator.
Tony turned his head on the pillow, feeling like he’d been hit by a semi-truck or two. His entire body was one large ache, but it was centered mostly around his sides and lower back. He got the feeling that if he coughed, his abdomen would scream bloody murder. There was the sound of pencil on paper and he managed to crack his eyes open enough to see Steve’s watery, blurry profile.
Tony blinked again, but pushed his goggles up into his hair. He rubbed his eyes before he began to pull apart the closest robot.
“Yeah, maybe that’s one thing you’re right about,” Steve growled. He took the case with him when he left.
“Feeling a little empty?” Steve wondered and crossed his arms, shifting his position where he leaned against a low table in front of Tony. Tony’s table was just a little lower, wider too, the perfect height for Steve because Steve was. In. Control. The table was pushed against the brick wall, and Tony was connected to it via a heavy metal bolt that attached to another ring in the clasps of the harness. It gave him no leeway to move his head except side to side, but only very little.
Steve hears him just fine, though. He hears the wealth of unsaid words in the depth of his name, ugly and beautiful all at once. His head is strapped down; he can’t turn it to look more clearly at Tony. Paralyzing terror grips at him as he realizes where they are, what’s going to happen.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?!” he yelled, hauling Tony and the armor up off the ground. “Do you even know how many people you’ve killed? You could’ve… You could’ve killed us!”
Tony straightened, meeting that glare head-on. “No, I’m prepared not to. If it comes to that.”
“Missy!” he called in dual tones, choking and desperate for help, needing to get out of the nightmare. It wasn’t Melissa that came to comfort him, though. The hand in his hair was too large, too strong. It stroked through his damp curls, tightening at the back of his head. He was crying, body struggling against the poison, and there was a soft, low hum before Steve’s easy smile came into view.
Only green M&Ms? Who does that? Fucking weird. He rubbed his hands over his face.
Scarlet Witch walked out of the warehouse with Frank right behind her. He wasn’t quite holding a hand against her lower back, but it was close. When the door shut behind them, Iron Man sighed heavily and began to relax.
Tony stilled his tongue, and Steve could tell he wanted to close his mouth, hide from the openness of the ring spreading apart his lips. But when he didn’t continue speaking, he saw Tony slowly start to test the bindings he’d been put in. He jerked his arms and flexed his hands around the metal supports attached to the suspension cuffs.
When, obviously, no request was forthcoming, Tony moved further forward into Steve’s space, forcing him upright once more. Tony didn’t stop there, and Steve felt the full length of Tony’s leg press against his body. The shifting hip panel bumped against the gag, jarring it between Steve’s teeth and displacing some of the drool that’d built up behind the ball. It eased out of the corners of his mouth to slide down his chin. He contained his whimper at that, but couldn’t when the rest of the leg settled into place, the alloy alternating from cool to warm in different sections where it pressed from Steve’s chest to groin.
Stephanie tensed a little at the name.
Steve tensed then straightened back to look at Tony sheepishly. His smile was endearing and Tony wanted to punch him in the face.
“Typical.”
“It’s not fair,” Tony muttered, flinging an arm across his face to cover his eyes.
Tony laughed at the sight, slightly hysterical, and blinked furiously at Steve as he tried to wriggle closer.
his head down towards the floor.
“Ty,” Tony managed to push out. It was stringy and faint, and Ty’s grin was shark-like in the low lighting. “S-stop...”
“Turn it off,” Tony said tiredly, “I’ll deal with it all tomorrow. Any word from Victor? Or anyone else that didn’t show up tonight?”
“All I can ask is that you consider it,” Iron Man replied, head turning towards her. “And I do ask, Scarlet. That you even came…”
“No, that’s game night with Ms. Maggie next door, remember?” Tony pointed out. “You promised her a casserole.”
Tony thought of the chasm splitting himself and Steve apart. He felt like he was standing on the edge of it, the wind tearing at his clothes. Between them was his suit and Pierce, and Tony didn’t have the heart to jump, because he was pretty sure there wouldn’t be anyone on the other side to catch him. In the end, he’d have to just step forward, let gravity take him instead. After all, that’s what he’d planned from the beginning.
The next morning when Steve gathers his gym bag, a little scrap of paper sits atop it. Steve recognizes Tony’s scrawl ‘Wesley - Dark Night of the Soul’ and he already knows what song it is when he loads it on his music player for his jog.
“Yes, right this way. Your guest arrived just a few minutes ago, so he hasn’t been waiting long. Ms. Potts requested your usual table. I hope that will be to your liking?” The maitre d’ made a notation on the podium and then gestured for Tony to follow.
“Red,” Tony hummed.
Steve steamrolled on, the words coming up now that he’d started. “I saw you with your little garden of budding scientists. You were so careful to spend the same amount of time teaching each of those kids about your robots. And don’t think I don’t know about the savings bonds you gave each of their families.
Stark met her gaze squarely. “I’m not alone. After all, I’m surrounded by nasty Nords in a camp where I don’t think anyone believes in bathing. And all of this because of you, Peggy.”
“I changed my mind. Help yourself.”
A week later, he doesn’t see Natasha roll her eyes and sit Steve down to explain what is going on until Steve’s jaw clenches in understanding and a little anger at Tony’s stupidity.
“I don’t use pa-” Rogers cut off at Tony’s raised brows. He cleared his throat and shifted his weight, falling into a parade rest. And wasn’t that adorable? Tony really needed him to stop. “I don’t have an ulterior motive other than you needing to eat, and I haven’t had dinner yet either.”
“Great, out of my way,” Steve growled, pushing himself past the others to step through Victor’s portal. He’d think about how he blindly trusted the man’s word about where it would lead him, but for now, he could only think about getting to Tony before PIerce could do any lasting damage.
Rogers took a step closer -too close- and said, firm and entreating, “I like seeing people as they really are, without their masks and their armor. I like seeing people be themselves, and this? This is what you really are, Tony. I think that’s easy to see now, most of all, without your fancy business suits and shining glasses. So passionate about what you love that you lose yourself in it, unaware of the world around you and how it revolves.
“Sweet girl,” Fury said as she practically jogged away.
Scarlet Witch sucked her teeth briefly then strode to Iron Man’s side to press a hand to his chest plate. She gave him a considering look then said; “To go against Hydra is foolish with the force Pierce brings, but… I will speak to my brother. Perhaps we will stand with you, Iron Man, but I make no promises.”
By the time Steve settled his fingers inside of Tony, the ribbon was no longer visible and he resumed pounding into Tony. He dropped his head forward, bending his back to bite down around the strap lining Tony’s cheek. A few seconds later, Tony’s entire body seized up against Steve, and then he was coming, shaking apart against Steve with heaving gasps as he practically forced Steve in tighter, harder, closer, still closer with the dull curves of his heels.
“The fake Iron Man…” Tony sat up again, scraping the chair as he turned it to face Steve fully, “He’s got some obsession with me. I mean, that’s obvious, but beyond the suit… He’s been in my head. He was in my head the other day, using… It doesn’t matter what, but he was fucking with me. I wasn’t in control. I couldn’t stop my response or my repulsors. When I fired, it wasn’t only me. He expanded the shots, reinforced the power. I think that’s when h-”
Steve’s fist smashed into Victor’s mouth before he finished, and while it was purely jealousy that fueled the hit, it was satisfying in a primal, possessive way.
“For you, sir?”
Tony tosses the plug on the bed and watches it bounce once. “It was...satisfactory,” he replies and Steve slides his arms around Tony’s waist, ducking to kiss his cheek.
Tony wasted no time reengaging his thrusters and taking off for the heavily-armed man gunning down the Bayonne security guards. As one of the bodies tumbled down the stone steps, panels on Iron Man’s thighs opened, firing three miniature missiles from each leg that all locked on Crossbones’ location. He pulled himself in tight and shot down after the missiles.
Especially when that greedy mouth is liberally applied to Tony's shaft. Tony closes his eyes and tilts his head against the mattress, mouth parting on an encouraging sigh.
“Well, well. You seem to be in quite the predicament, Captain.”
Even if that means hurting him.
Tony looks up, meets Steve’s gaze, and stutters out another breath. “Okay.”
“I don’t think you’re going to bleed to death in the next hour, but you’re going to need medical attention,” Clint said as Tony came around again. He dropped Tony’s phone onto his chest and got to his feet, taking his bow back from Tony’s limp hands. He pulled his mask back on, hiding his face once more before turning towards what was left of Crossbones.
“Not to mention, you’ve got Captain America on your ass,” Frank said, “Are you going to try and get him on your side too? Because I’m pretty sure after you dropped the Port on him, he probably hates your guts.”
Fury shrugged.
Tony had. Tony had loved Tiberius like fire. A bright, hot flame that lit the path to Tony’s dreams and future. Ty had put him on the road to success and stolen his heart, then stolen his work.
“I don’t go because those doctors are never in a hurry to get me patched up.” He stopped there as Tony’s hands tightened in his hair. Tony was staring ahead at the fridge, not seeing it as he absorbed Steve’s words. Quietly, one of Steve’s palms pressed against Tony’s hip. “I’m gonna be fine, Tony.”
“Stop trying to make me feel better,” Tony groaned, dropping his head back over the other side of the recliner. A pen dislodged from his hair and landed on the drab carpet.
Tony steps between Steve’s legs and tilts Steve’s head up, fingers gently framing his jaw. “Did you wash like we talked about,” he asks softly, gaze focused only on Steve’s face, his expression, checking for any sign of doubt or hesitance.
Tony struggled towards the lever, too far from the controls to reverse the press. He screamed and screamed, begging for his father, for anyone, to not leave him alone, to please get him out. And then, he just didn’t.
Steve caught Tony’s wrist to stop him from putting them on. His expression was still sheepish, but edging into serious, decisive.
at reading people.
“I’m glad you think I help.”
“Oh, for the love of Odin.” Loki crossed his arms. “Fine, but let’s just get on with this.”
"I’ll be the one to protect you from your enemies and your choices," Steve pulls his hand away from Tony’s throat.
The memory wouldn’t go any further than that. Tony had forcibly ripped that memory out of his head the first chance he’d gotten. He never wanted the reminder of the hands on him that night, but the nightmare was far from over.
People began streaming out around the damaged vehicles blocking the way, dragging kids and dogs and belongings they didn’t truly need. There was blood and crying and a hell of a lot of screaming, but Tony turned his back on them just as a Doombot barreled into him from the side.
Tony could feel Steve bristling across the table, but he kept his gaze on Pierce, playing the game with graceful aplomb… Which he figured he earned simply by not placing Steve’s dirty knife in Pierce’s trachea.
Tony didn’t catch the name of the reporter as he clutched the rim of the trash can with shaking, weak hands and vomited violently. Just as he thought it was over, his stomach heaved again, seizing the breath in his throat. His eyes watered, his entire body drenched in sick-sweat, as he struggled to draw in air around his body’s seemingly-automatic convulsions.
“Okay,” Steve agrees, and it’s heavy and throaty and Tony can see the heavy bob of Steve’s cock beginning to fill in anticipation. That’s good. They’ll need that. And as much as Tony wants to linger and stroke Steve’s cock now, he knows he can’t yet.
Steve looks around to his valet who gives a short nod in answer to his silent question.
Tony groans. Steve is definitely trying to kill him.
The red alert continued to blare around them, but they were lost to it as they stared at each other. One in shock, the other quickly getting there.
Tony didn’t get to finish his sentence as Steve’s hands cupped his face and tilted him up into a kiss. His grip on Tony’s jaw was gentle, easy, but his mouth was intense, a demanding pressure that Tony could’ve melted under. As it was, he did part his lips, let Steve’s tongue sweep in along his own, deep, claiming. The moan, when Tony heard it, was shaky and his own.
“Steve?” Tony breathed, moving onto the linoleum and careful of the drop cloth that he could then see held the bloody remains of Steve’s uniform. “Jesus, should- Are you sure it’s my help you need and not the SHIELD doctors?”
The man flails, one fist swinging that Steve easily leans away from. He sighs and tuts again. The man’s blue eyes are bleary and he doesn’t think it’s solely from the head wound. A drunkard, no doubt. Possibly tossed from a nearby establishment.
Stephanie gave as good as she got and, when the commanders and lieutenants pulled them all apart, the men came out as worse for wear as her. Blood covered her face from a gash that bisected her left eye. She could feel the bruises forming all along her body, but she did her best to keep her chin up and shoulders back as she was dragged before the General.
“No. I’m pretty sure he’s sure I’d tell him if I did find anything. Thing is, I don’t think there is anything to find. I’ve been all over his house, nothing was restricted, nothing keeping me out of any of his stuff. Granted, I didn’t dig too deeply, but he’s got that A.I. so who knows how far it would’ve let me get into files.”
“I’m the cloying, pervasive itch in the air, the chaos beneath your skin. I’m the magic behind the mask, and that’s all you need to know for now. We’ll meet again soon enough, but do duck down, or you might lose your head.”
The rest of the night is a blur.
Bucky waves him off. “It’s fine. We can talk later if you want after your fitting.” He rests his towel over to his shoulder and steps over to Sam who’s scribbling on a pad.
The HUD fed in across the faceplate as Jarvis greeted him, “Welcome home, sir.”
Blue.
-  "I Walk The Line" by Halsey (cover for Johnny Cash)
“It’s too quick” Tony says, tone vacant and absently thoughtful, but it’s not to Steve. It’s to Bucky behind Steve. The gun doesn’t move. “On mne nuzhen.”
“Oh,” Bucky replies, blinking owlishly at Tony like he’d forgotten Tony was at the table. “Thanks, Stark,” but he’s already turning his attention back to the pale yellow he’s painting Natasha’s toenails.
“You might want to rethink those words, Stark,” he warned, cocking the shotgun with one hand. Tony thought he might vomit rather than rethink any words, but just as Crossbones aimed the gun at him, an arrow appeared with alarming silence in Crossbones’ shoulder. It stuck out of his body armor like a garish attachment.
When that’s finished, he grabs a black case no bigger than a large pencil case and a special bottle of water-based lubricant. He pauses by the sink, makes himself breathe slowly again and avoids his reflection. He doesn’t need to see himself to know that he’s flushed and aroused. He can feel the beginning weight of his erection against his thigh, trapped by his underwear. He breathes out once more then turns to reenter the bedroom.
Sam plucked the glass from the runner to sniff it cautiously.
during that dream. It was Steve he’d tied up. It was Steve he’d blindfolded and stuffed full of plugs and rods and his own goddamn cock until Steve had become a shaking, sweaty mess and begged Tony for relief. And Tony had given it to him, stroking that beautiful, straining, red cock as Steve’s cum dripped over his fingers, seeping into the crevices between them.
He feels threatened.
She returns to Tony and touches his shoulder. He’s afraid to look at her.
“Then maybe it’s not about bringing him in. Maybe it’s about bringing him down, permanently.”
His legs smacked the ground when Crossbones let go and stumbled back, clawing at Ronin’s arms to free himself. His rough voice was a gurgle of breath as he fought, but Ronin was relentless, turning the bow to pull the custom Dacron tight across Crossbones’ throat.
“They report on terrorism,” Steve pointed out, “Iron Man, for one.”
Tony feels a painful lump in his throat, but this time he’s able to keep the tears back and he sinks into the pile beside her. She presses a kiss to his cheek and the rest of the team cuddles up around them.
Rogers seemed to shake himself out of his momentary fugue and hurried off with a wave over his shoulder and a teasing “Right away, Mr. Stark.”
Steve and Bucky had both worn matching frowns, but it was Steve’s fingers that spread Tony open carefully, and Bucky’s fingertips that brushed against Tony’s skin as he pushed the plug deep inside his lover.
“One minute, sir,” Jarvis warned, but Tony wasn’t listening. His vision had blurred and his body had frozen, stuck staring at the wires that were climbing up around his arms. They glowed a faint green, and Tony felt himself leaning forward, falling...
Tony stop. If he wanted to, but he knew then that he didn't. He craved the end of this, this overwhelming sense of completion that only Tony could give him.
“And, of course, the government immediately re-enlisted him,” Tony said with a resigned sigh. He navigated through the fast lane around a van swaying dangerously out of its lane.
“Sweet setup more like,” Tony countered.
“Just Steve is fine, Mr. Stark,” Steve smiles, amused, and that’s good for Tony, that Steve doesn’t think he’s irritating already. “Miss Potts said you were interested in a full suit?”
A month later, he’s yanking out fistfuls of scraggy brown hair and wondering where the snow went. When did it melt? He thinks it might have been when he was sleeping. When he was reaching for a suddenly-clear image, and his dull-thumping heart supplies…
“Do you want to talk about it?” Steve asked and Tony huffed, squeezing Steve’s hand in response.
“I’ll just have-”
It reminded him of the ice, so cold it burned before it consumed him. Consumed him like Tony was consuming him, with his cock and his steady, calloused fingers that knew everywhere and exactly where to touch to spur Steve on. His thighs worked tirelessly, lifting and dropping his body to follow Tony’s rough-spoken commands. His back remained arched, the belts and ropes still connected together and ending in the tight grip of Tony’s hand.
“Sir, the thorium has been completely consumed. Radiation levels are still peaked, and any civilian still alive will need to be quarantined and treated immediately for poisoning. I estimate the loss of life to be in the low hundreds despite their best evacuation efforts. The remaining passengers aboard the planes have survived with minor injuries, but will also need to be quarantined.”
“It doesn’t matter what you think you know, Stark,” Fury replied, pushing away from the desk to stand and walk around it. “It only matters what my agents are reporting. Regardless of whether or not they’re actual Doombots, we’re going to take care of the threat.”
"It was open," he said, blinking up at the determination in Steve’s face.
“What’s different?” he asked himself, “What happened? When did… it… happen…”
in mind, to make sure he kept the Captain on his toes, but firmly at arm’s length. It wouldn’t do for Rogers to build an interest in him, but it was a surprise that Rogers was even beginning to hint at it. Not so innocent, Rogers had said.
His quick cameo set was the highlight. He went on the little makeshift stage and smiled at the guests with a genuine expression. He settled his guitar on his thigh and entertained them with a few songs from the new album. Again, par for the course.
What was one more broken heart along the way?
“Talk about what exactly?”
Steve shook his head, leading Tony down into the SHIELD garage where Tony’s car was parked. Their voices were oddly loud in the silence of the steel around them. Tony automatically lowered his tone.
“Do you remember how to open your messages?” Tony asked sweetly.
“Tony.”
“Oh, shut up,” Steve muttered, slouching down in the bed and throwing his arm over his eyes.
The honey-soft scent of Pepper’s perfume filled his mind and her whispered words were damp with fear and anger.
Tony rolled his head to the side to look at Iron Man. When others could only see the colors of the material and the shape of the suit, he saw the millions of little equations and schematics that went into it, all of the tiny wires and pin-sized pieces. He saw safety and power.
And Tony could kiss her for her own humor. Something tells him that she wouldn’t appreciate the gesture at this moment though. He dumps the plug into the sink and lets hot water run over it as he cleans himself up.
Tony laughed shortly, blinking drops of water out of his eyes.
Tony felt his expression twist in rage, the snarl of hurt and betrayal well up to shred his already wrecked throat. He forced his hands forward to shoot Steve away, but he was shaking and being shaken.
“This isn’t something you mentioned when we were first talking about...kinks,” he gets the word out with only a slight hesitation, but then he’s soldiering on. “But when I was searching the internet about some of those things… I found this. And… It’s… I’m…”
Natasha eyed her like she could hear the words left unspoken. “You are very strong, Titanborn. You don’t let these
Tony turned around, dropped into a crouch to cover his ears as his dream self screamed. He wondered if he kept screaming or if it was just the music. Or had it been Ty screaming as a few security guys rushed into the room.
“Tony!” Steve shoved the corpse away and twisted towards Tony to rip the gag off.
Another four days pass, and he notices that his hair is coming out. He shakes black fingers -doesn’t remember if it’s his skin or a thin glove, but he doesn’t remember to check- and silver-white strands blow away to disappear among the glistening snow drifts.
They were nightmares that left him screaming for his parents, that had Maria kissing his brow and murmuring softly, had Howard rolling his eyes and sneering from behind a tumbler of amber liquid.
Tony stiffens and smoothes his hands down his slacks before he turns to face Steve. The ever-present gauntlet on his hand flexes metallic like Bucky’s arm. It’s a bit crusted where Steve’s blood has dried. “You read his file, didn’t you? You saw how he was wiped away, programmed. You saw what they did to him. You know what they did to me. You try so hard, all the time, Steve. You tried to fix us, tried to fix me, but all you did… All you did was hand me—
Three scared technicians, surely a dump truck’s worth of coffee, a stripped-off shirt, and enough accumulated engine crud covering his skin to grease an entire amusement park later, Tony was fairly furious enough to chew through one whole section of the turbine.
“Grip this.”
Steve’s head whips against the pillow and his expression screws up, but Tony sees the gathering wetness, the tears falling in the crease of Steve’s eyes, slipping back into his hair. But he hasn’t said to stop yet, so Tony keeps going. Even when Steve’s voice leaves him on a sob.
Iron Man kicked off into the air, hurling himself after the disappearing boat on the horizon and leaving his heart behind on the Port.
By the time Iron Man was done with that man, Pierce would beg for something so simple as suicide.
Tony turned his head slightly, eyes blinking slowly to catch bleary sight of Steve where he sat beside Tony’s hospital bed. Other than Steve’s voice, the room was quiet. The television wasn’t on, the machines weren’t beeping. It was peaceful. It was relief.
Her hand continued to smooth down his back and she gently hummed to soothe him. Eventually, he was exhausted and he worried he’d crush his mother under the weight of his armor, but when he went to move, the arm around him clamped down, creaking Tony’s joints as the armor began to buckle.
So Steve doesn't even think too much about it. Instead, he finds another way to share. He draws his sketches of his sights on blank postcards.
It goes on this way through the rest. Each death is methodical, calculated, and effective, breaking Steve over and over until even the asset feels it behind his ribcage. But this morning…
“The evacuation has caused panic, but the civilians are complying with personnel. There are two planes still connected for boarding in Terminal B. Sir, the core material has eroded at too rapid a pace. Meltdown imminent. You must retreat to a safer distance.”
The armor was still playing guard, silent and judging. Steve carefully rolled over and shoved his pillow over his head.
"I'll like it even more when it's doing its job,” Tony replies, rocking his hips up into the space between them.
He doesn't need any identifiers on the post cards. He doesn't need to see the places they showed or the names, almost-faceless, people. He knows who they're from.
“Take off your pants,” Pepper orders.
“I gave you the chance to leave,” Tony says as he stops a few feet away.
Rumiko hasn't been in the ground four months, body still figuratively warm, but Tony is drunk, and the man's inviting smile already feels like those lips are wrapped around Tony's cock.
Long, dexterous fingers work Tony's clasp and zipper open easily, and Tony files the flecks of paint at his nails away for later if he chooses.
“Someone needs to be,” Tony replied, moving away to shrug out of his coat. He threw it over the back of the couch and returned to Steve, rolling up his sleeves. He could do this without freaking out anymore; he was determined to be steady.
"Tony."
care. I’m simply assessing your mental capacity, considering you’ve poured another large drink in the thirty seconds we’ve been discussing it.”
“I was supposed to save the world,” Tony slurred, sedated. He stared at crisp white sheets above his wrist and wriggled phantom fingers.
“Code Tammy?” Pepper hisses at him, voice low and lethal. And Tony’s trying to keep a lid on it, trying to reign it in, but another woman enters the elevator and the small crowd shifts and Tony shifts and there it is, the telltale tightening of his muscles.
“And he didn’t…” Steve trailed off as fury rolled across his features. His hand stilled in Tony’s hair. “He didn’t have time to...to…Pepper found you first.”
“Like I could get it in the laundry room,” Tony replied archly. “The piles of clothes would distract him too much.”
Tony killed one of his boots to twist himself around and drive a hand into the Doombot’s jetpack. It reared back, cutting its own momentum and slamming its metal foot into Tony’s armored gut with enough force to send Tony careening through the stone side of a nearby building. The wall crumbled, and he had to blast his way out from under the brick before he got buried.
“You were a mess when I found you,” Steve said, his profile a pensive expression from what Tony could see. He turned from the window and strode over to the table just out of Tony’s reach where a pitcher and a stack of paper cups were placed. He poured a cup and stepped up to the bed just close enough to hand over the cup without making Tony stretch for it. But he came no closer. “Do you remember what happened?”
"Steve, let me go," Tony manages through a throat that’s too tight.
“If there was only someone who loved you.”
Other rumors were worse, bad enough to twist Stephanie’s stomach with the things the cadets and other soldiers dared to say. She never saw the Dunmer though, not really. She’d catch dark skin out of the corner of her eye, but the elf would be nowhere to be seen when she turned.
“You’re making a mistake, but I think I’m done here. You’re not going to like what comes next.”
“God, I’m so sorry,” Tony whines. “Pep, I thought-”
“Tony!” Steve cries. “TonyTonyTony.” He’s chanting, clearly overwhelmed and yet, still conscious of his hips. Tony’s so proud of him.
"Hey, Pep," Tony speaks up, and Jarvis listens to the soft hum Pepper gives in acknowledgement. For a fleeting moment, he thinks of shutting down and blaming it on Doctor Reed. Tony's eyes are still on Jarvis' scrolling databanks, and Jarvis feels horrendously exposed. He suspects that this is what naked feels likes. "Put your hand back on its shoulder."
He’d decided a long time ago that Hitler’s death was too easy for Pierce. He wouldn’t let Pierce evade him that way, deny him the satisfaction of ripping out his heart and even eating it if he wanted.
The soldier stepped forward, catching Tony beneath the arms to drag him up from the planks. The chains around Tony’s legs clanked as he was pulled up to the edge of the pier. The cinder blocks scraped against the wood, and Tony’s anger gave way to fear to rattle around his lungs. He panted and began thrashing against the man holding him. There was a loud thump and shouting, and then Tony was let go when Steve barreled into the soldier. Tony landed, rocking on the edge of the pier. He caught his breath and jerked forward away from the water, nearly catching Steve’s elbow in the face as Steve snapped the soldier’s neck.
The tsk through the faceplate might not have been completely audible to anyone else, but the Captain sure heard it. He was already propelling himself forward as Tony lifted a little further in the air.
Steve’s hands were warm, slightly clammy, and secure. They threaded through his fingers, pinning them to the table, as Steve’s mouth ghosted across the nape of Tony’s neck.
Tony was lost to a dream. He could tell it was a dream; the edges of his vision were fuzzy, and he was pretty sure that was himself on the bed. He recognized his shoes. And he recognized the slope of Ty’s back. The music was loud even then, some club song that was blasting through the party.
“Why don’t you fix it up and give it to the Boys and Girls Center?” Steve suggested. “Then I’ll let you take me out on the water in one of those ridiculous boats.”
“A statement or a claim?” Tony wondered sardonically, raising his brows. He pulled his glasses from his face and tucked them inside his suit jacket before reaching for his sunglasses from the other pocket.
Dinner, it turned out, consisted of two bowls of black truffle gnocchi, and two main courses: one, a lobster ravioli with roe, and two, a beef tortellini that Tony wondered if Rogers would have eaten had he known what it was. They both came with a sprig of mint and three pieces of lightly-glazed asparagus, ostensibly held together by a thin strip of scallion. Pretentious and expensive; what Tony thought most people expected him to dine on as a normal person would dine on Pizza Hut or Burger King when they didn’t feel like cooking that night.
All of it perched, heavily, on Rogers’ shoulders and uplifted hands. He looked like a titan; Atlas, who bore the burden of the celestial spheres in punishment for opposing the new pantheon, a younger generation of gods given reign over Olympus. The analogy didn’t fit, or it would be Tony holding up the sky while Rogers stood before him; Zeus, crowned and triumphant.
“Sir?”
Steve raised his brows then huffed in amusement, giving Tony a sly expression.
Iron Man brushed it off, letting his shaky flight controls take over as he went after Crossbones. His window was closing and he’d been so close. He had been so close.
“No!” Tony shouted as his younger self lost consciousness. The black pulled him in, left him suspended again, and he felt like he would throw up. He hated magic, loathed its power with a passion because he couldn’t fight it, never could even when he practiced with Victor. He was spinning, dizzy and disoriented.
It’s like a dam breaking and Steve’s stomach is covered in his come not even a second later as he sobs from the stimulation. He gets his hand around Tony’s on his cock as soon as the sound is clear and helps Tony stroke the last of his orgasm out of him in desperate waves.
“Villains like you make me sick,” he spat. “What was your objective here? What could you possibly want to not even care about the innocent people -the
Captain Rogers let you get back to work.”
Tony has no problems meeting the man's gaze straight on; the man bites his lip and tilts his head subtly towards the door. It's enough. Tony finishes his whiskey and pushes the bartender the customary tip before he grabs his jacket and heads for the door.
“I’m finding it hilarious, to be honest,” he said flatly, “You actually think I didn’t plan for this. There’s always been the chance that you’d find me out, Nick. You’re not an idiot. It’s just a shame your lawyers are.”
“Oh, darling,” Tony sighed, closing his eyes, “Better late than never.”
Tony stalks forward towards the downed War Machine. Friday’s voice is a steady stream in his ear, unable to shut down his suit, unable to hinder his progress. Steve is swarmed by agents.
“She’ll heal,” the mage replied, finishing applying an ointment along the gash. It was warm and stung a little, but her eye didn’t so much as water. The mage was surprisingly gentle. “It will probably scar, though. I assume the ring that split you open was poison-coated.”
The tension from the belt around his throat connecting to the rope pulled at the plug in Steve’s ass. It lit Steve up, pleasure engulfing him as the plug rubbed against his prostate. He cried out around the gag, hoarse and desperate for relief, almost desperate enough to do as Tony asked. Almost.
"Tony, please." The entreaty is strained, desperate. The man behind it is bound and useless, hanging from the adamantium shackles like a particularly gruesome pinata. Blood drips down to join the puddle on the floor. The drug in his veins weighs him down too heavily to burn out quickly. "Not her. Not like this."
“Torturing? What are you talking about? They’ve never tortured me. They just don’t-”
He also knows that it wouldn't be too terribly hard to track their path, to find their artist.
“Hm, oh. Sorry.” He flashed the man a bright smile. “I’m here for-”
Pepper looks confused for all about five seconds before she recoils slightly, cheeks fusing with color.
Tony sets them up in a warehouse that the asset hasn’t been in before. He’s unsurprised to note that it’s remote, plain, unobtrusive. He’s even less surprised that the heavy form slung over his metal shoulder is the first one to be brought here.
“Oh god. Tony, oh.” Steve is slurring and wrecked and the most gorgeous thing Tony has ever seen. “S’good. S’good.”
inked across one of his hipbones.
Tony watches Steve’s throat move as he swallows, drags his gaze over the restrained flexing of his lover’s body. “You’re so goddamn sexy.”
A mage healer tended to Stephanie’s eye as she waited for the General to turn around and acknowledge her. Her hands clasped together in her lap, knuckles white under the scrapes and blood.
“Shit,” Tony groaned. “I told him thorium was too dangerous, but does anyone listen to me? Noooo.”
“None, sir. Since Hydra has gone silent, so have most of your contacts. I have briefed Doctor Doom according to protocol. His returned message states that he’s aware you took the brandy, and he expects the vucana wool in the color you promised in return.”
“Really? Going with the leg and not saving my life?”
“Yes,” and this time the man responds in English, tightly clipped and the accent barely noticeable. He sways a little and lets Steve grasp his elbow to steady him. “I believe I was mugged… Blast this head of mine. It aches a bit fiercely.
Bucky doesn’t tense; he looks over his shoulder at Steve before he jumps over the edge after Tony. Steve throws himself to the edge of the pad, scrambling back as a silver and red Iron Man suit shoots past the building towards the street far below. It’s slimmer than Tony’s, and Steve knows that Pepper is piloting.
“Sir, radiation levels have increased, and the airport is beginning to report electrical glitches. I have activated their fire alarms and evacuation has begun.”
“Oh, I meant Call of Duty,” Steve smirked, wriggling his toes against Tony’s leg, “but you’re pretty swell too.”
“Paddles
And that right there revealed that the one being cornered was the Dunmer that Stephanie had never personally met. She was pretty sure, amid all the other things she’d heard about the Dunmer, that the elf could take care of himself, but the two men advancing on him laughed and muttered something too low for Stephanie to hear.
When Tony didn’t finish, Steve sighed as he hung up his coat and shut the closet door. “You can like it, sweetheart, and still be pissed as hell. I’m upset for you, and it’s been almost a year. But you’ve knocked it out of the park with your new album. Four,
Tony grimaced and leaned back as Candace came back with their drinks. She set them down then pulled out her notebook with a smile. Something on the closest television caught her attention, though, and she didn’t stop the scoff that came from her throat.
The nightmares continued, but Tony learned to be careful about screaming too loudly, of alerting his father. He learned to sleep with one pillow tucked in his arms, so when he inevitably dreamed of falling -
"Of course, I do," Tony says, press persona sliding into play as he sympathizes. "Honestly, you two were meant to be anyway. It's obvious you absolutely adore her. I expect pictures of the baby.
Fury frowned, but Tony kept going.
He spent a long time on Tony’s cock, nuzzling and licking. Tony’s every breath became a pant, his legs trembling and tensing against the bars and Steve’s shoulders. Steve worried briefly about bruises along Tony’s knees, but the worry was swept away by a particularly needy moan leaking from Tony’s open mouth. His lips felt hot and slick from his spit and Tony’s precome, but he continued to slide them, partially open, over Tony’s shaft, then down over his balls until he’s nosing in beneath. He shifted a little, knocking a moan out of Tony, shoving his shoulders into Tony’s legs to get his mouth just behind Tony’s balls, tongue running firmly against his perineum.
Steve snorts and Tony grins at him.
Steve watches him, watches the bowed head, the closed eyes, the breathing that is slightly faster than normal. His gaze tracks over Tony, over the crisp white shirt that covers lean muscles, down to the expensive jacket that lies over the bench beside him.
Tony watched Ty’s face absently as the demo played, rocking in his seat until the two front legs came off the ground. His expression was blank as he stared at the ceiling, but Tony was used to Ty’s listening face.
“The moment you throw me to the wolves, every scrap of Stark tech holding this place together dissolves, assets and all. Ownership and control transfers to Ms. Virginia Potts, CEO of Stark International. I, personally, might be buried in the shit that’s left behind, but I’ll be damned if these people are deprived of the progressive technology they need to strive forward.
“Oh,” Victor sighed, the sigh of a disappointed teacher to a student who just didn’t comprehend, “I came to your company for that reason, yes, but to you, Anthony? That wasn’t the only reason.”
He couldn’t scream anymore, his gauntlets screeching as they slid over his helmet and Victor was laughing as he tumbled to the ground; they were all laughing in overlapping waves.
“Take it out.”
Until he does.
“Not this, not ice,” Steve whispers, throat threatening to collapse around his fear. “Tony, any-anything but this.”
“Hey, yourself, Cap,” Tony replies, mouth quirking at Steve’s nervousness. “What’s going on?”
Honestly, he should’ve known better.
Tony huffed once, absently turning a styrofoam cup in his hands. “Don’t worry; we’re still in your ‘home, sweet, home’, medical and all. You told me you stopped going to the SHIELD doctors and why. So when I heard that they’d brought you in and taken you into surgery immediately, I came down to observe.”
But he was already on the ground, wasn’t he? Then how was he still falling, falling forward, falling through the asphalt and then the world until he was suspended in an endless black. Still on his knees, he blinked frantically, trying to see something, anything that would make sense.
But he doesn't. Each one is placed in a drawer.
“Now wait just one minute!” Steve shook himself out of his confused daze and turned around again in time to see Thor haul another person through Doom’s portal. This man was thinner, paler, and giving off an aura of bored detachment.
“You’re a…” Stephanie trailed off, staring at the elf with wide eyes. She didn’t mean to, but she’d just assumed the elf in the armory had been male. No one had ever...She’d never heard anything about Stark being
,” she cried. “Shh, my sweet baby, it’s going to be okay.”
“Tony,” Steve says again, a sighing moan of his name as Tony gets Steve nice and slick, paying more attention to the flared head of his cock than the shaft. He spreads the lube up and over his slit, massaging the lube into Steve’s skin as Steve lets out little, uncontrollable ‘uns’ under his breath.
“Touché. Doom wasn’t there.”
“Steve’s a fuddy-duddy who wears tweed coats with patches and it’s not even ironic! He actually
Tony blinked at him silently for a moment, then said, “You’re late.”
Pepper gives Tony an odd look, but does so, and something clicks into place behind Tony's gaze. Jarvis has been found out. His creator is too smart and, after all, Jarvis doesn't fall far from the tree in regards to personality. His parameters are to care for those that Tony does, to provide and protect.
“Best friends… We were brothers,” Rogers corrected softly. “Not by blood, no, but… Sometimes it’s not about the blood in your veins, but the blood you spill together.”
Steve would have to break the bad news to them, preferably while knocking them unconscious. He shifted his legs to ease the strain of the new position then rolled over to get up on his feet. All that seemed to be occupying the room with him were a few shipping crates taking up the far corner of the room. There were a few workstations and a couple closed doors; one near Steve and the room where the other men were talking, and another was near the big bay doors leading, presumably, outside.
Tony felt himself frown slightly, but he shook himself out of it and cleared his throat. “I have to say, Cap, your timing was impeccable.”
He hugged her, kissed her cheek, and wished her well. She cupped his face and kissed his brow, promising to keep his company intact. He let her fiancé drive him to the airport to get to know him a little. Hogan seemed like a good guy, a little too eager for Tony’s tastes, but he shook his hand and let Hogan promise that he’d “do real good by Pepper, Mr. Stark.”
