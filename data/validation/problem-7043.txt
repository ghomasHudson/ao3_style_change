“That’s, no—thanks, Thor, but that’s not necessary,” Steve repeated a number of times before Thor stopped inviting himself and his girlfriend where they were very much not welcome. “That’s not exactly, uh—thank you, but that’s outside the scope of this meeting. All I want to do right now is tell Tony how I feel and, and see how he feels about me. About us.”
Hell, if Tony didn’t love that man. He’d trade any Manhattan zip code for Brooklyn or the Bronx in a heartbeat. He’d eat ice cream in Van Cortlandt instead of in Central Park any day of the year, live in some average apartment building without a doorman and arm their home with his own damn security.
The three detectives behind him stopped what they were doing and looked up. Tony glanced at them all in turns of quiet acknowledge, until his gaze fell on Natasha and lingered there.
Tony couldn’t be happier for him, if only Steve’s beloved job didn’t also mean that he couldn’t join Tony on all his business trips and conferences around the world. The man didn’t even like taking his sick days when he knew that patients would be counting on him to be there.
Steve smirked at Tony’s shameless begging, but he dried the plug off and set it aside. “Later,” he promised, then finally coming around to lift Tony off the counter and help him find his balance again. He wiped Tony’s torso clean with another warm paper towel, and finally his cock before helping Tony into his pants again.
So that last one hadn’t been made yet, but Tony knew it was on the horizon. One day he'd be sitting in Steve’s arms, munching on cheese and grapes as they learned about the inevitable: the end of life as they know it.
He looked so worried that Tony couldn’t help the truth from spilling out of him. “I’m an asshole,” he confessed with quiet words. “I’m an asshole who can’t plan ahead, keep track of time, or—”
Tony’s face lit up with a sudden realization. “All the time!” he said in a rush, “for decades, now; you wouldn’t believe how many dirty come-ons people—I mean,” he interrupted himself quickly by clearing his throat. “Pepper, my agent, she’s been with me from the start, she has copies of everything. You’ll have them by tomorrow.”
“Jane Foster, don’t!” Tony shouted immediately, and all eyes turned on him in disapproval over his rude exclamation. Tony was pale and harried, but he pressed his lips together to will the nausea at bay and stubbornly stood his ground at a computer terminal. He had already beaten Foster to the punch.
Bucky and Rhodey quickly learned that the only chance they had of reining in their respective monarchs was to join forces. By combining their efforts and bridging their communication, at least one of them was always likely to know where both of them were. When Rhodey spotted Steve and Tony dancing in a dark corner of a club where Tony had only meant to get a drink, his first action was to text Bucky to let him know Steve was safe. When Bucky woke to the sound of an unusual crash in Steve’s apartment and rushed in to eliminate the threat, he found the two of them giggling in a tangle of bedsheets on the floor beside the bed, rubbing their heads where they had clearly tumbled over the edge like overeager teenagers. Bucky had cursed them out and stalked back to his own place where he texted Rhodey to let him know both idiots were safe from everything except their own damn selves.
“...alright, okay. That’s… sweet,” she conceded, confused, but pleasantly surprised. “How about something more tangible.”
No-one else was wearing a costume of any kind. Judging by their dull, neutral sweaters and glasses, they barely looked like they were at a party at all - for all Steve knew, this was a group of fifty some-odd law students who’d accidentally ended up in the same house after class. Those closest to the door who could see him stopped what they were doing to stare, but these weren’t the appreciative or awed looks Steve had enjoyed on his walk to the party. They looked at him like he was out of his mind or grown another head.
As Steve’s laughter calmed into a quiet chuckle, Tony pushed up on an elbow to look into  Steve’s eyes. “I want to kiss you,” he confessed, struggling even then to keep his gaze from drifting down to Steve’s lips.
“So,” Steve said eventually, frowning as he struggled to find the words. “How will I know where to start? I don’t mind compromising, I just—”
And honest. The steward should never lie for his or her own comfort. Without honesty, they could not teach, only obfuscate.
” Tony whispered from Steve’s elbow, shuddering at the thought. He leaned across the counter to address the reservation agent directly. “Look, just give us a Ford truck. F-150.”
Steve swallowed down the shame and hurt before they got the better of him. With his chin level and his shoulders squared, he strode into the party like he owned the place, meeting the eyes of the few who felt entitled enough to look down their noses at him. All he’d intended to do at this party was catch Brock alone so that they could talk. That was all he’d planned to do, and not even these conniving elitists were going to get in his way.
Steve watched as Tony’s eyes lit up in understanding, and to his right, Bucky’s whole face fell. If Steve was right, he had married a minor.
“Talk, right now,” Steve demanded over Tony’s indignant outrage. Tony smacked him on the shoulder, but that only turned Steve’s smirk of amusement into a wolfish grin.
“My hips are sore,” Tony murmured in agreement, nestled against Steve’s chest while his master carried him away.
The Harvard Law Library housed some of the finest books in the country. The dignified, expansive building curated every recorded legal case, and - perhaps more importantly - provided tables, study rooms, and nooks for students to pursue their studies in great comfort.
Steve frowned into his chocolate milk and narrowed his eyes at his own reflection in the kitchen window. “Not until you tell me why you want to see him so badly,” Steve replied coolly. “You’ve already met him, haven’t you? You and Aunt Jackie both met him months ago.”
Tony shifted down in bed the few inches he needed to kiss Steve’s lips, a slow, gentle slide of their lips together. With firm pressure on Steve’s shoulder, he turned them over so that Steve was on his back, and Tony could rest his chin on Steve’s chest.
But instead of kissing Tony, Steve laved his tongue over his lips. Tony gasped and his eyes opened wide in his surprise, and Steve used the momentary silence to his advantage by ramming Tony against the wall. His hand behind Tony’s head braced the impact, and held him in place so Steve could swallow Tony’s guttural cry of excitement with a deep, hungry kiss.
“Been wanting to tell you all night,” Tony whispered hoarsely between rushed kisses, rolling his hips up against Steve’s body. With only two layers of fabric between them, it was so easy to feel Steve’s interest pressing against his thigh. The thought of Steve’s cock free and so nearly exposed drove Tony half out of his mind.
Those casual days were Tony’s favorite, and today was no exception. There was simply nothing he enjoyed more than starting his morning in a hot bath, cradled by Steve’s body, while Steve doted on him. Unlike the (admittedly excellent) barber on staff, this time with Steve was a chance to catch up or prepare for the day, to steal kisses, and to indulge in a meditative, intimate start to their day together.
“Nobody cares more about me than you,” Tony promised him, “not even me. We’ve been sleeping together from the start, we haven’t used condoms in months. You think I worry you’d mistreat me in my sleep?” he asked in a deliberate misunderstanding he hoped would be enough to derail Steve’s concern. “You know how hot that makes me? The thought of waking up to you fingering me? Fucking me? Using my mouth?”
Living on East coast time in LA meant that he could wander through Vons in the morning without tourists approaching him to tell him they thought he was shorter, or shouting at him that they were with him 'until the end of the line.'
,” he insisted when Rhodey and Bucky exchanged mutinous looks. “I don’t want to see either of you again until morning.”
Tony’s food was untouched on the kitchen table, and Tony was at the stove, filling Steve’s plate with scrambled eggs to bring to the table so they could eat together. He waited for Steve to take a seat before putting the plate down for him.
“That’s… helpful, thanks,” Steve mumbled halfheartedly. This was an absolute disaster - did they distinguish between soup spoons and dessert spoons at Taco Bell? What was the rule about fish knife and dinner knife if you ate fish for dinner? Did fancy people even eat burritos?
“Are you done?” Fury asked with a tired drawl. “You want them to stop? Whatever you two are doing is clearly getting the wrong people angry, so get out there and do what you do best: get them first.”
He scrubbed his hand over his face, cursing under his breath as his fingers came away wet with tears. With a vindictive resentment, Steve wished someone would lock her in a room with a Costco sheet cake and a fork as a personal favor to him.
“Oh—no, of—sure, it’s only my baby sister’s bachelorette party, and I’m her maid of honor, but—I’m sure it’ll be fine,” Sharon explained as calmly as she could, but Steve had already stopped listening and stepped into his office. “Yeah, I’ll just—yeah, I’ll cancel, no problem.”
Tony’s regained spark of attention faded at Steve’s question, and he walked around to set the platter on his coffee table and take a seat on the couch. Steve could either sit beside him on the soft couch, or on a hand-carved armchair.
“If the murderer is so obsessed about me, why couldn’t he just come after me?” Tony whispered. “I’m alone, I live in a brownstone - I make an easy target, I… they were all so young.”
“Chief Director, the Captain has not yet had two hours to adjust to our social constitution. I formally request you to be patient. Captain Steve Rogers,” he added, turning to face Steve. “Every minute counts. This is not rude, it is protocol, and this argument you raise is not worth the lives of the citizens we serve.”
body. Steve only laughed at Tony’s sudden burst of action and quickly covered him up with the blankets to keep them warm, drawing him into the protective embrace of his strong arms and proceeded to chase away every fear and worry plaguing Tony’s thoughts with his tongue, his lips, and his sharp, wicked teeth.
She took the keys, and Tony packed up her gear on autopilot. She pressed in close and softly kissed him goodbye on the cheek. She smelled like orange blossoms and juniper.
He turned around in his seat to face Maria. She pulled a wicker chair over, and sat down to look him in the eyes.
Brock smirked to himself as he tapped on the glass case. It was too think to punch his way through, but getting his hands on his prize was only a matter of leverage.
“It—hell, I wish I knew,” Steve moaned in complaint. “He said he wanted me to respect him, and wanted to take it slow. Carter, he didn’t stay the night. Who does that, what does that even mean?”
“Tony, listen to me,” he heard Steve say in a collected, steady voice. Tony stared at him, momentarily grateful that it was Steve behind the wheel and not himself, because only one of them looked calm and comforted by this knowledge, and it was not him.
“Ahead of schedule, that’s all,” Steve promised. “Peggy will have prepared a statement, it will be fine. The premiere’s going to be crazy, though,” he added as the immediate consequences started to come to him.
The thought that someone might turn the corner and see them any second left Steve reacting on impulse - he took Tony by the arms and pressed him into the corner, blocking him from view with his own bulk. It was only then, with Tony’s back turned to him that Steve noticed something shiny catching the light from between Tony’s full, firm ass cheeks.
Different combinations of the same conversation became so common place that Tony soon learned that there was no room for people in happy, monogamous relationships at these toxic get-togethers. After enough people ‘forgot’ to invite him to dinner and poolside poker nights, and lively conversations consistently quieted to awkward silence whenever he came near, Tony learned his place on the sidelines. They included him to the extent that they needed to for his business and his genius, but just like boarding school and college and graduate school, he didn’t fit in.
“Bears?” Tony blurted out, a little confused (and a lot amused). “What exactly do you think lives out here, Steve?”
“Dear god,” Tony whispered, powerless to resist as Steve reeled him in by his tie for a slow, tender kiss. When they naturally eased apart, Tony sighed against Steve’s wet, kiss-swollen lips, tired but content. “You… look like a dream.”
“What is it?” Tony asked, nipping this uncomfortable, shitty feeling in the bud. “Go home, Steve. You’ve been at this all day. I’m fine, I had a late start.”
The four men turned as one to look at Natasha with varying looks of confusion, interest, and fatigue.
“Oh. Uh, well. Thank you, Mr. Stark,” Steve faltered awkwardly over his words, “but we’ve already been introduced.”
“Please, please have a seat,” Steve asked him as soon as they walked into his flat. He took the small duffle Tony had carried up the stairs for him and gestured at the sitting room. “Don’t go anywhere.”
“You look good in blue,” Tony observed between leisurely bites. Steve hummed to himself, but rather than helping him appreciate his past fashion choices Tony’s comment reminded him that he was free to look less pulled together now that he wasn’t in front of a camera. He kicked off his shoes and sat up to pull his sweater off over his head so he could get more comfortable in his big armchair.
He let a few minutes pass before throwing out the Hostess box and letting himself out back into the lobby. There was a small bustle of people in the previously empty building, and Steve felt less out of place as he made his way to Hawley’s office.
“No, that’s not what I mean,” Carol interrupted him, speaking firmly but without raising her voice. “Steve, think about it. James said they were really manipulative assholes, they would know how to push his buttons.”
The kids collectively moaned and pouted about going back to their lessons when Tony was there to visit, but out of the vague sounds of complaint, one voice piped up to ask,
“Sorry mate, that’s false,” Karl said, though he still sounded pretty cheerful. “It’s some character called… Galvarino?”
“Fuck yeah, I’m in,” Bucky said with a grin. But his expression sobered a little as he remembered why he was there. He had carried a tray of gutted tech down with him, and he delivered it to Tony by carefully setting it down on his workstation.
“I am the Chief Director of Police, I do not have time to steward insubordinate, muscle-bound apes—”
. Nick, Amy, Tara, they all had families. People who loved them, people who cared about them. People waiting to hear back from them.
“Sheep dipping in AWB global neo-Nazi ass kissing contest,” Tony summed up while they exchanged headsets. “Facial recognition is running, soft search for Lindhaus is a dud, but we’ve got two viable connections.”
“Please, Steve,” he begged with a quiet sob, “please, please fuck me, I can’t—I need it, fuck me, Steve, please.”
A man not much older than himself was sitting on the nice leather couch, clutching a packet of Hostess Sno Balls in one hand while he had a pink, half-eaten treat in the other. There was nothing sinister about it, or even that unusual, but Steve got the distinct feeling that he’d walked in on something rather private instead of simply interrupting a stranger’s morning sugar spike.
“Thought you’d like that,” Steve murmured, and Tony watched him with a hesitant, but amazed wonder. “Our hormones aren’t as effective for you as yours are to us,” he explained, although, since it probably made no sense to Tony at this point, so he tried to simplify it further. “We’ve come to understand our effect on your species is emotional, not physical. In my case, contentment.”
“Tony,” Steve whispered, his voice breaking with another particularly tight squeeze. His blunt fingers dug into the meat of Tony’s calf. “
“How long has it been?” Tony asked instead, his words selected by natural curiosity before his nerves took the lead.
“You also drink extra hot grande chai tea lattes with 3 pumps, skim milk, no foam?” he wondered, regarding the cup with a thoughtful smile. “Is that a coincidence?”
“You could’ve gotten me a ring, you know,” Tony teased with such a fond, loving smile that Steve relaxed and let the embarrassment pass. “Any ring, Steve. A donut. You went through all this trouble?”
“Sweetheart, you don’t know how their lives work. Maybe it is okay for them,” Steve said in the gentling tone that meant he wanted Tony to let it go. Not because he thought Tony was wrong or jumping to conclusions, but because Steve didn’t like that these strangers could make Tony that uncomfortable so effortlessly.
“—and we thought, why don’t y’all just do it here? With family? Just the four of us, sweetheart, nothing big. Dad’s gotten the lawyers to get a prenup together, Steve and I picked up the marriage license.”
While Jenna fawned over the pictures of Sarah’s most recent foster kittens, Bucky leaned closer to Steve and asked, “So, what did Stark want?”
There was something about Bond’s soft, rumbling growls and gentle grunts that left Tony’s body trembling like some misaligned Pavlovian party trick. Bond was quieter than he had expected; no
“Bond, perimeter secure. We’ll take it from here,” a gruff voice reported while Tony’s world spun out of control, and Steve was quickly hustled away so paramedics could attend to Tony.
“It’s easier to get him into bed from here than from his workshop,” Bucky pointed out around a mouthful of caramel whipped cream. “And you look fine, blue’s your color.”
“I like that comparison, Naser. The lions are close, let’s go look at them,” Tony said after a few seconds of thought. The kids stuck to Tony like glue every time he talked about the animals or answered their questions, and Tony had quickly learned to use this to his advantage: they only moved from one exhibit to the next when there was a story to keep the kids’ attention.
“Mr. Barnes, it appears you and I have a lot of paperwork in our future,” he said with a broad grin. It wasn’t even about him, and Steve wanted nothing more than to reach over and haul Tony in for a kiss.
“No,” he said slowly, still processing what Fury had said. “No, this—deported? That can’t be right. I’m not even an immigrant—I’m from
The stretch car slid to a halt with a squeal of tires and a chorus of honking cars behind them. Before Happy could twist in his seat or even get a question out, Tony had shuffled to the left and climbed out of the car.
The fellowship for trauma counseling had been their first priority, but if he was honest, Tony suspected it was a more urgent concern for him than Steve. Howard had taught him to be a strong king, a respected and admired king. Sarah had showed him by example the importance of communication, of actively listening so that the source of a problem cannot be concealed. But Steve is the one who taught Tony patience and kindness. In the end, both Sarah and Howard had in their own ways tried to be effective, successful leaders. Steve was the one who had seen the devastation of war, who had seen first hand the unspeakable price of freedom. His priority was to protect his people, to care for them. He was not a king who desired leadership and respect, he was a king who foremost was a public servant, and the first line of defense for his people, whether they feared starvation or oppression. Tony had never imagined his power so humbled, yet Steve made it seem natural, so obvious, that with every passing day Tony started to wonder how it had never occurred to him before.
Clint smirked up at him like a devil spawn with his hand in the cookie jar, but he said nothing. Instead, he made his way to the fridge and started to pull out a selection of meat cuts and vegetables.
“Mine,” Steve grunted against Tony’s smirking lips, grinding his hips against Tony’s ass hard enough to bruise. “Only
Tony heard Steve rumble in his discontent and pull the blankets up around them before he realized he’d been shivering. Steve must have mistaken Tony’s shivering for feeling cold, and Tony didn’t correct him. He indulged in the way Steve bundled him up closer and gently rested his cheek against the back of Tony’s head as they sat together in silence for a while.
“You went back and got another one the next day,” Tony filled in with a knowing but curious smile. “I don’t remember the last time you felt nervous about telling me something.”
Tony’s laugh still carried in his voice as he finally conceded. “Saturday, eleven o’clock. It’s a date.”
After all, if Machtberg tradition was to mean anything, they had started their new year as they intended to finish it: together. Steve’s glum expression gradually lifted, until eventually he smiled, bashful in his eager hope.
Tony hummed in place of shrugging.  “I am told it was my mother,” he answered when his thoughts settled. “That she feared the Wars were consequences of a people who could not overcome social divisions in a diverse society. My father’s official reason was that no soldier who served honorably deserved second-class rights,” Tony said with a sigh, as if reciting a memorized sound clip. “Whatever the reason, the economy benefited greatly from their arrival. We lost many men in the war, and the young American soldiers brought their families. Without them, our economy would not have advanced as it did.”
Tony shrugged one shoulder, but it took him a while to answer. “Same reason I moved up north,” he admitted, as objectively as he could. “I had a series of bad injuries. Horse ran over my arm, bull threw me into a wall. Fell on my neck. Add to that lifelong—whatever, you get it,” he sighed, before he thought too much about it. “It’s not the safest sport.”
in the restroom. Past me was a great thinker - it’s a fun book to leaf through when you can’t go anywhere!
“Goodness, no! I find my job deeply fulfilling: I uphold peace, tranquility,” Bruce replied, palpably shaken by Tony’s whirlwind dreams of long-forgotten barbarism. “You're addicted to a distant past, high from its harshness, buzzed by its brutality. The venerable Governor Alexander G. Pierce has sacrificed much to create our peaceful world, and frankly, as your friend, I must strongly advise you to reconsider your hobbies if you ever wish to mature. A certified adult would not dream so fondly of violence as you do, Tony Stark.”
going to be a performance, because all we're sharing is two dates—maybe three! Then I’m dumping him and moving on to the next willing target.”
Soon enough, Steve found Brock in the kitchen by the drinks, talking to Maria Hill. Steve didn’t even have to speak for Brock to notice him and forget about whatever Hill was saying.
ommmggggggg my body is READY!!!! You think he’s gonna get married with his regular butt? NO. IBD THIS IS DEF CON 5: WE ARE LEVELLING UP TO HONEYMOON BOOTY!!!!
Happy in his sudden clarity, Tony finally noticed the name trace had turned up one e known KGB alias. Yelena Belova was a Black Widow.
Steve scrunched up his face in confusion. “Who? No offense,” he said to Bruce quickly as he realized that must have been the third person in the room, “I don’t know any of you, but at least Stark’s looks familiar. I’ll go with him.”
Steve choked on a gasp of Tony’s name. Wide-eyed, he watched Tony’s eyes close in pleasure, mesmerized by the sheer contentment in Tony’s expression. Then, Tony swallowed. There was no intention behind it, no attempt to coax another round out of Steve. It was enough intimacy to keep Steve’s mind from wandering and weighing on him, and Tony seemed comforted with his one task, glad and at peace with the weight of Steve’s soft cock on his tongue, filling his mouth.
“Dinner and a movie is the classic choice,” Sam said while loading his egg roll with guac. “Can’t go wrong.”
“Beautiful,” Tony murmured, his voice deep and hoarse in a way Steve had never heard from him. He needed to hear it again; he couldn’t bear it if this was the last time he made Tony sound this way.
“Better than sending pictures of strangers’ vaginas,” he muttered, only partially invested in the conversation. “Opened or otherwise.”
They got back to the office and took their saved seats on either side of Bruce just as Yinsen walked into the conference room.
“I’m fine,” Rhodey insisted petulantly, but when Tony managed to swap his whiskey out for water, he didn’t really seem that bothered.
Instinctively, Tony threw an arm over his mouth before he cried out and woke his neighbors. He threw the other arm over his eyes for good measure, because this couldn’t be real—this was not real, he must be dreaming, he was unraveling at the seams and Steve was only getting started.
“It is a sweater,” Steve said as Tony gathered it up and walked to the nearest mirror to hold it up against his body to imagine what it would look like on him. “It is a blended tweed with reversed stockinette insets and expressed seam details. Tony?” Steve added after a beat, and Tony turned to him with a curious expression. “I’ve never knitted or sewed a day in my life. Why do I know what stockinette inset stitching looks like?”
“They offered the captaincy to me, actually,” he said, quietly, as if Tony wasn’t hanging on his every word already.
Much too quickly, Tony lit up with a big smile. “Yes!” He cheered, gesturing at the despondent dragon. “Fire-power! We can save Stephanie from Chief Talia!”
“No, it’s—” Steve answered reflexively, then stopped himself before he spoke too hastily. “Stay? I don’t really want to be alone.”
Tony had found Steve’s bedside lamp and left that on as the only light in the room. Steve picked his way through the obstacle course that was his room, then crawled under the sheets where Tony was still awake, waiting for him. While the double bed was bigger than his twin back in their dorms, they shared it with a large stack of clothes Steve hadn’t known what to do with after his move. There were only so many free t-shirts and sweats a man could use in a lifetime. And what was he ever supposed to do with graduation robes? A Halloween costume?
Steve let go of Tony’s hips to grab a fistful of Tony’s hair and jerk his head back, forcing him into a backbend. Tony’s mouth fell open with a wincing gasp of pain, and Steve capitalized on the opportunity to force four fingers into Tony’s exposed mouth. Tony gagged and sucked down around his fingers in his surprise, and it was enough to plug up the noises Tony had been making.
,” a woman purred directly into the microphone, or directly into Bond’s ear. “What magic can your hands perform for me now that we are alone?”
He had to remind himself that they were not here for leisure, or for Steve to find his place among the wrong people. They were here to catch a villain, and to stop him before he hurt others.
“The way you told Howard to go to the library for the morning paper…” Tony added, and Steve suddenly burst out laughing. His laughter quickly turned to moans of frustration, and he rubbed his face against Tony’s chest in a misguided effort to hide.
“By the looks of things, I’d say it’s well deserved. Let’s take a look together, shall we?” Graham said with a mischievous smile as he turned to the desktop behind him. “Here you are, in something we quite easily recognize. Is that the suit from film?”
“Tony, it’s alright. You’d find out eventually,” Steve said with a strained smile. God, if only Tony could invent a time machine so he could travel back to five minutes ago and kick his own ass for the discomfort behind those pursed lips.
“Your spit, it’s—” he tried to say, but he was too far gone to string sentences together. “Drives me crazy.”
With that Tony turned to kiss Carol on the cheek, wished her luck with the last of the carpet, and promised he’d see her ‘on the other side’.
Steve turned in his seat and gazed after Tony with a hopeful smile. “I’m afraid tequila hasn’t liked me since I turned thirty,” he called after him and watched as Tony poured himself two generous fingers of scotch.
“I’m not going back to modeling after this season,” he said as calmly as he could. “I’m going to law school instead. Harvard Law.”
Tony grimaced with disgust at Stephanie’s words, and finally, he looked her in the eyes. “And why would she do that? Because Women are so much better than men? Because Women are a gift, and men could never be?” he spat. “I heard you,” he added with a snarl, and Stephanie fell back in a terrible shock. “I heard you, last night with Clint. I knew I should’ve known better than to trust you, to think you were different. To think I cared for you, that I could—that I could even love you. I’ll spare you the trouble of asking me to make you with child; my answer is no. Death or freedom, Stephanie, but I want nothing more to do with you.”
“Oh, what a peachy surprise! It appears Governor Alexander E. Pierce is attending a FiberOp conference as we speak. Conference room two down the hall.”
Partway through episode seven, Happy pulled up in front of the Plaza Hotel. He was out of the car and there to open Steve’s door before Steve had his seatbelt off, and Steve tried his best to step out of the car like having the car door opened for him was a normal occurrence. Like after all these years, he wasn’t still overcome with the Cinderella strain of imposter syndrome.
Just because he had an internship didn’t mean Steve was out of the woods with his other three classes. So while he had a hunch that the key to the case was hidden in Mrs. Hansen’s business and family assets, he didn’t have the time a full-time lawyer on the case might have to comb their records for insights. What he had were the eight hours a week otherwise devoted to Hawley’s class, plus what time he could shave off his paltry social life.
Fun fact: In Portugal I learned that some apartments are designed so that one can safely jump from one balcony to the other in case of emergencies. I believe it is intended so that one can escape in case of a fire (i.e., if your exit is blocked because of the fire, you have a viable alternative exit). My impression was that it isn't a national law, but that it's a prevalent part of modern buildings. That said, that's not what Steve and Tony deal with here (mostly because I pictured them in the Altis Avenida Hotel, which is from the 11th century and clearly predates structural fire safety).
Hay duty took no longer than an hour, but by the time Steve made it back to Tony’s room, he was tired and his body ached in disturbingly unfamiliar ways. Howard’s words weighed on his mind, and the two ring boxes in his pocket were bloated with too much shame to carry, but he managed to shuffle into the room all the same.
“You might be the only person, living or dead, who’d choose my legs over Usain Bolt’s,” Tony informed him matter of factly, and Steve wasn’t sure if he wanted to cry out in disagreement or count himself grateful. In either case, that suited Steve perfectly since he had no interest in sharing the privilege of worshipping Tony’s legs with anyone.
“Twelve days are already more than I can handle,” Tony grumbled instead, and Steve laughed. He could see the affection warm and glittering in Steve’s eyes. He’d never forgive himself for taking it from Steve.
Tony laughed from somewhere in the house, and he soon appeared out of the kitchen. “Are you referring to yourself in the third person again?”
Superman’s son. Steve was the son of the greatest hero of Tony’s generation, and he wanted to be with Tony. He trusted Tony.
Before Fury could bark at Tony for disobeying such clear laws of privacy protection, the names of all prisoners scheduled for a hearing that morning in the conference hall were projected onto the translucent wall.
Steve gave him a moment to let the embarrassment pass, but Bucky wouldn’t stop frowning into his M&Ms. “Give me that,” he finally said, plucking the bag out of Bucky’s hands and carrying it on to their kitchen.
Tony stopped dead in his tracks and stared at the phone screen. Steve glared at him for so obviously reading the messages on the screen—private messages he had no right to read. He could feel his hackles rising, and that dam of righteous anger was buckling under the pressure of polite society.
“—the hotel, what?” he asked in a charade of innocence, batting his eyelashes up at Steve to fan the flames of exasperated laughter that Steve was trying (and failing) to keep to himself. As if Tony wasn’t leaning in so close that he could feel the tremors of amusement against his side, or recognize the shameless affection in Steve’s eyes.
“Oh, Natasha will love this,” Bucky practically giggled to himself, then gestured for Tony to follow them, too. “Come on, Stark. It’s this way, follow me.”
Steve snorted at the question, and with a sleepy slur in his voice, he blatantly lied. “Oh, yeah. Much nicer.”
Sharon buried her face in her hands and muffled a miserable groan. A conversation with herself followed; Steve couldn’t make out what she said, but when she looked up in the end, she had clearly lost the argument.
Tony quieted him with an unexpected slip of tongue, a deep, possessive kiss that left Steve moaning instead of voicing any concerns.
Steve sat down in his bed before he fell over and grinned down at the phone like a fool. He waited to see if Tony would follow up with some sassy remark or punchline, but nothing was happening, and slowly Steve started to believe he really meant it. Tony’s words warmed him in a way he didn’t know he had missed. Tony missed him, too.
That’s when he spotted it on the other side of the street - a strip mall salon called ‘Beauty Oasis.’ Again he spun his car around, swerving toward the salon until he pulled up to the curb and hopped out of his car.
Steve groaned and rolled his eyes, covering his face with his hands. “Of course, sure. Why should I be surprised? Our therapist was your friend.”
Tony barely bothered to towel off, walking out to the bedroom instead with the towel simply draped over his shoulders. Steve tied his towel around his waist and followed Tony out to the bedroom, sitting down beside him and watching Tony mull over the boxes. He held the big box in the palm of his hand and the smaller, round one with his fingers, thumbing at the latch in thought.
“Tony, I’ve missed spending time with you, too,” he said softly. “Benedita showed me this place a month ago and, I’ve… Tony, I’ve wanted to come back here with you ever since.”
“That’s who’s staffing the most prestigious lab in your dad’s company?” Steve asked after a beat, clearly less than impressed. Even without their relationship, Steve knew that Stark Industries was a big deal to every branch of the military. But he had also been open about how glad he’d been that Tony was different, that his inventions and patents were more about how to support people than how to arm them.
break into GayArrangements.com to dig through their membership records, but without the necessary paperwork legally allowing them to do so, none of it would hold up in court. The last thing they needed was to build a case borne of the poisoned tree.
- he watched Rhodes chase Tony around the workstation like some tired imitation of Benny Hill. It didn’t matter how many times Tony accused his best friend of treason of the highest order: Rhodes caught him eventually and shepherded Tony all the way back to the royal apartments. He deposited Tony on a bench in the sitting room where his grimy clothes wouldn’t ruin the furniture, and Steve watched as a hand from behind the camera - Natasha’s - dropped a folder into Tony’s lap.
. You changed your ringtone to ‘America, Fuck Yeah’ so everytime someone called to wish you a happy birthday that obnoxious song got stuck in my head.”
Tony pressed his lips together, visibly containing his instinctive reply from spilling out. It took him a moment, but eventually he nodded in understanding. “I see that now,” Tony replied, speaking so quietly Steve nearly missed his answer. “I was wrong. Steve, I was so wrong, I, I fucked up and I hurt you in the process. I can’t change what’s in the past,” he acknowledged in the end. “But, Steve, I’m telling you. I’ve been trying, I’ve—I’m leaving Stark Industries, Steve. I’m getting out of weapons manufacturing. Renewable, sustainable energy. I can’t promise I won’t fuck up again, or that I’m worth another chance, or. I don’t even know what I’m saying anymore,” he mumbled with a frown to himself, ducking his head as his confidence flagged. “I just know that I fucked up, I lost the best thing that’s ever happened to me, the best person I’ve ever known, and it was for what? Making better bombs?”
“Steve?” Tony called his name gently, but he said it with a smile, as if he could guess at the effect of his casual acceptance. “Hey, darling? You alright?”
At first it looked as if Steve would sit there and giggle at Tony’s indignant rage-lust, but with a quick sleight of hand, he held up the beaded glass dildo. Tony abruptly stopped his threats to watch Steve slide the toy through his fist in an obscene, lube-slicked pantomime of what Steve had planned for him.
“Sick of you, maybe,” Tony teased, then nearly fell off his stool with a big laugh when he quickly swerved to avoid Steve’s retaliatory pinch.
“No! No, no, and—absolutely not,” Tony insisted in a rush, because that wasn’t a mistake he was willing to make twice. “Your boyfriend is disgusting and has
Steve stood and stared for a moment, trying to figure out what had happened to Tony in their time apart. Even with his jacket on, it was clear to Steve that Tony had become leaner. The leather hugged Tony’s biceps and forearms in a way it hadn’t in the past, but it hung loose around his waist. Steve just couldn’t tell if it was the healthy effect of increased activity, or the unhealthy habit of skipping meals. Knowing Tony, Steve worried it was the worse combination of both.
Steve read it again and again, and without thinking brought his ring to his lips again and again, pressing absent little kisses into the warm metal with only one man’s lips on his mind.
“Here, mine are ready,” Bucky said and held out his plate of dough dots, to which Natasha added hers. Lila went around to help Tony with his remaining half, and soon the three of them started a new plate with more struffoli.
“What’s wrong with you?” Tony glowered with an anger that was felt more serious than this conversation warranted. Distantly Steve remembered something about debutants and children, but he was too irritated to make a meaningful connection.
There, they found Clint digging into the pumpkin pie alone in the kitchen. He wasn’t even using a plate, he was just digging into the pie directly with a spoon.
Steve froze and looked at the boxes in Tony’s hands. A blush crept up across his chest and neck, and color bloomed over his cheeks; by the time he shook his head and admitted that he didn’t know, Tony had already figured it out.
It was Steve’s mouth being used, his lips tight around Tony’s hardening cock and his cheeks hollowed as he coaxed him to hardness, but it was Tony who was reeling. The shock alone drove him wild. Mere seconds ago Steve had kissed his forehead and offered him solidarity in reviving his presentation, and now, without warning, Tony’s cock grew firm, wet, and warm in the smooth, velvety sleeve of Steve’s mouth.
Over the past seven months, Steve had learned to cope. He couldn’t even lie to himself yet about moving on, but he was at a place in his life where he could hang out with his friends without missing Tony beside him. He could hear the songs that he knew Tony liked without wanting to cry, and he could remember the good times without resenting the present.
As soon as the door was shut behind them, Bucky wasted no more time with polite formalities. He took the king by his elbow and towed him to the nearest office. The office had been cleared of its intended occupant so that Bucky and Steve could use the room in private.
Tony stared at her with a kind of horror that could only be laughed at. They had what? Oh, god, his parents were lunatics, and he’d left Steve alone with them for six hours—
Steve would hardly believe he wasn’t dreaming. Here was Tony, Tony who got him, understood how he moved and his strengths and his weaknesses. So he had no doubts when he sent everyone packing; in the end, it was just the small team closest to Steve, his sparring partners, the medic and physio, and Tony, drumming Steve through basics, re-familiarizing himself with Steve. And one by one, as people on the team beg off from exhaustion, Tony dismisses them individually, never as the full team, requiring everyone to work as long as they can, until even Steve's sparring partners are all gone. And by then, Tony takes the striking pad up himself and drills Steve on further, in part to see how far he can push Steve, but in part also because he doesn't want to end their time together. It wouldn't be until night time, when even Steve was swaying on his feet, that Tony would call it off, tell him to get back to the hotel and rest. But Steve wouldn't want to so readily admit he's exhausted; this was his chance to impress Tony, and he wouldn’t want to let him go either.  Steve would stay, hesitate, pouring sweat, standing but only just. Tony would be giving him advice on what to do in future, how to get what he needs out of his trainer and manager, but Steve wouldn’t really be listening as much as he was just waiting for his turn to talk. He knows what he's supposed to say: he was supposed to be grateful, to say 'thanks for today, I appreciate your advice,' but when the words left his lips, he was begging Tony not to go, to please not leave him, not again. Tony was the one Steve wanted next to him when he stepped into the ring next week.
“A fire in Albuquerque,” Clark answered from the balcony through the closed doors and across the living room, because he heard everything. He patted at himself then, and Steve’s enhanced sight allowed him to see how the soot and charred ash came off his suit in thick little clouds. By some minor miracle his dad had avoided the bright red and blue of his favorite uniform and worn one of his black suits, one without a cape and with a silver family crest on his chest.
“Thirty something? Mid thirties?” Steve recalled, which reminded him of the good news. “Tony also fixed you arm and he and Bruce finally found a way to put you under for the surgery—”
He threw some necessities, jeans, and shirts together into a leather duffle, and by the time he was wrapping up his toiletries, Jan was finally at his door with a large paper bag.
Steve didn’t break his stride as he walked up to them with a smile that was all teeth. “Thanks for inviting me, girls,” he said cheerfully over their gasps and nervous giggling. “This party is super fun!”
“Let me stop you right there: I don’t wanna know,” Bruce cut in before anything too vulgar was shared.
Clint must have seen how badly he was fooling himself. “Tony built the pantry,” he added, leaning in as if sharing a secret. “I bet he’d—shit,” he said all of a sudden, grabbing Steve’s forearm to get a better look at his watch. “Is that the time?”
In one smooth, practiced move, Steve twisted his hand and let the canister locked and loaded on his forearm swing down into place. The blunt, pointed head of it fell right into his palm, and with his three fingers stretching Tony's hole, he eased the canister in through his fingers, where it gathered some lube off his glove on the way.
“I love you,” he tried to say, because the world was well and truly fading and Tony needed to know before it was too late. “Love you so much.”
“I think my fragile ego can take it. Don’t expect me to put out on the first date just because you’re paying, though,” Steve added primly. The thieves took off across the street, and Steve slipped around the corner, smoothly pocketing his phone to fire off a tracker after the van using the multi-purpose epipen Q-branch had armed him with.
“Hey, wait, no, Steve,” Tony looked a little shaken as he came closer, and before Steve knew what was happening, Tony was so close that Steve could feel the warmth of his skin and the scent of his body wash under the cologne. God, whatever he used, he smelled so good.
As he came up, the first thing Tony noticed were the man’s broad, muscular shoulders. Firm, beefy biceps flexed from the effort of helping to lift Tony into a seated position. Already the man was unfairly attractive, Tony didn’t need to look up and see that strong jawline and defined cheekbones and blue, observant eyes. Marple must have found him mid-jog; his Under Armour clung to the firm definition of his body and his skin was still damp and flushed from exertion.
The spell of companionable silence was broken with the buzzing sound of Tony’s phone. The distraction was a godsend, and Steve quickly got to his feet under the guise of putting their plates away and getting more comfortable so he could slip into his bedroom and get his shit together.
“We’re in a meeting,” Hill told her stiffly, and Sharon had enough sense to smile sheepishly in return.
It wasn’t until Tony had fallen asleep and sun had long set that Steve noticed his clocks were on the move. The van was where he had last seen it, but all twelve clocks were scattering across the city at an alarming pace.
But what worthwhile, serious person can read his course syllabi and miss the very first assignments listed on the page? Maybe it was true what they all thought about him when they looked at him - another dimwitted blond with a rack the size of Kansas and an ass to rest your drink on. Maybe he should drop this nonsense and go back to modeling while he still had the body people were willing to pay to dress up.
His soft spot for Tony Stark was undeniable, but he’d never imagined his life to bring him here, standing in Tony’s townhouse with Tony in nothing more than loose, threadbare jeans, a t-shirt, and flannel shirt with his sleeves rolled up. Watching him walk away was a study in Tony’s natural grace and Steve couldn’t bring himself to look away. His was a hopeless case, a lost cause, and still he felt like the luckiest man in the world.
Steve snickered and couldn’t help but grin, cause damn, Sam. What a jackass move. What a genius. “Pretty sure he’s just saying that cause Bucky can’t handle dairy.”
“No way,” Tony whispered, then bounced up on the balls of his feet to shake Steve’s shoulders. “What! Are you getting me a jersey?”
Cut to an entirely different kind of foe, one that Steve (despite his best efforts) can't punch in the face.
“How about tomorrow at 5:30, sweetheart?” she said, not wasting any time getting to the point. Steve made a quiet sound that wasn’t a no, and she took it as a confirmation immediately. “I’ll be making enchiladas, so skip the wine and bring the tequila.”
“When I told him that Hawley came on to you - without any details,” she hurried to assure him, “he said it was probably your fault. You wore something or did something. There have been some red flags here and there, but victim blaming? That’s an unforgivable dickhead move.”
“Could you point them out? Introduce me? Next time I’m there, I mean,” Tony said. “To remember my books that well, and to be clever enough to put it together, that’s… that’s exceptional.”
“Aren’t you a Fed now?” Sam said to interrupt the brewing fight. “Even if we wanted to, this isn’t your jurisdiction anymore.”
Tony stared at him for a moment, as if waiting for all of this to be a terrible joke. But when the punchline (or simply, the punch) never landed, it all started to sink in, and he took a few stumbling steps to the left to perch on the sofa’s firm armrest for support. He glanced up at Steve, still in disbelief, and absently sipped some of that coffee for some strength (and for something to do), until he finally made up his mind.
“I don’t think your dad likes me,” Steve blurted out as Tony got back to work. He glanced back over his shoulder to try and get a good read of him, but Steve was looking anywhere to avoid eye-contact. “I’m sure this will help.”
“My assistant will have the address to you within the hour,” Steve told Jan before they parted. With everything delegated and taken care of, he handed his luggage to the driver and climbed into the car.
Except, he didn’t move. Tony sat as if rooted to his chair, staring at his own hands where he slowly clenched and relaxed his fingers in an effort to calm himself.
“Easy, pet,” Steve murmured ruefully, petting Tony’s hair to comfort him while he did his best to push his own robes aside to reach his cock. He wasn’t hard, but he took himself in hand and guided Tony’s mouth to his cock, rubbing the head over Tony’s lips in encouragement.
“Can’t believe it took me divorcing my wife to find you,” Bucky laughed wetly, then quickly stepped back to scrub at his eyes with the back of his hands. “Fucking hell. This—”
“That sounds great, but frankly it’s difficult to believe he is a reasonable person if he thinks I need a tailor made outfit for Taco Bell.”
“Therapy?” Tony echoed quietly in surprise, and Steve felt a little uncomfortable by the sudden spark of curiosity in his eyes. “You would do that, you’d go with me to couples therapy?”
Jane pulled up to the sprawling colonnade that led to the entryway of the building. “Captain Steven G. Rogers, I wish you an effervescent evening. And if I may say so, sir, you look elegant and well suited to this handsome crowd. Should uncomfortable circumstances arise, remember that it is better to be silent, or to simply repeat Tony Stark’s response. He is your steward, and even if you look unusual by copying him, everyone will perceive your action as an endeavour to learn and only think highly of you for your efforts.”
“Is a lot for anyone,” Steve filled in, gentling his words in counterpoint to Bucky’s anger. “Come on, let’s get inside.”
Steve hesitated on the threshold into the kitchen. Now he saw that he’d caught Tony in the middle of carving up a golden brown, crispy baked chicken. A deep dish of mac and cheese sat cooling on the counter nearby beside a plate that was already loaded with steamed broccoli and carrots. The food filled the air with irresistible spices and the promise of butter, and not for the first time in their short acquaintance, Steve really wished they’d met under different circumstances.
Before Steve had to ask, Patrick did him the favor of tossing him his laptop. Steve sat up and typed Tony’s name into the Google search box immediately.
The more he grasped for words and tried to explain himself, the more Steve realized that Tony was as nervous as he was. Maybe they were in the same boat of wishful thinking after all.
Tony smiled back with affection and mischief bright in his brown eyes. “Then stop thinking and let me show you.”
When their next witness took the stand, the sex worker described arriving at Barnes’ office and accompanying him to a hotel room for the night in great detail. She knew where the private elevator was, she knew the name of Bucky’s private chauffeur, and she even recalled what side of the bed he slept on after. To back up the accountant, she provided an itemized list of services Barnes engaged her for that night.
who interpreted every twitch or every action to signal the worst, horrible, no-good things. Sure, they were his best friends, but they would never let him live this day down.
It was almost too much. Tony’s blown pupils and the mess of drool already wetting his mouth, his chin, and drawing long, wet lines of spit down his throat… he knew exactly how to get Steve's blood pumping by using that thin, strained sound of his pleading voice as he shamelessly played into to one of Steve’s favorite fantasies of Tony feeling incomplete and hollow without Steve’s cock fucking into him and plugging his ass up.
Later, when they eventually get Steve to the hospital he desperately needs to go to, Tony would pace outside his operating room while Steve was down for the surgery and Tony can only remember how it was his fault in the end, because he's the manager, not Steve, he's supposed to be Steve's objective oversight and he failed Steve.
“They’re screaming like you’re about to take your clothes off,” Graham laughed, and the couch laughed - all except for Channing, who blushed and gracefully declined. “Alright, well - we tried, so that’s our expectations managed for the night,” Graham quickly informed the crowd in feigned solemnity before turning back to his guests.
A blush rose in Stephanie’s pale cheeks, and she bit her lip bashfully as she tried to resist a bright smile. “You think so? I mean,” she whispered, sneaking a little closer where she was crouched beside Clint. “You think he, he could care for me? A Woman?”
“Four years ago, I got promoted. I didn’t think I’d need to be Steve anymore, I didn’t think I’d need that life. A life of my own. I was selfish—”
“This is either going to sound crazy or cliche,” Tony warned them before he turned the laptop around with the lid nearly closed. “They were all young, attractive. All single. No signs of sexual assault,” he added, because it needed to be said, “but I think sex had a lot to do with this.”
“Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark, I’m afraid there has been a most regrettable occasion for miscommunication. The Governor is indisposed at this time with other important matters that cannot be delayed. For the continued moral sanctity of our wholesome, unpolluted New Yorseylvania, he is not to be disturbed. Instead, I will be available to address all of your inquiries.”
The unification brought many changes to Consone. Some could be observed or monitored immediately, such as literacy or unemployment rates. Others, especially those founded in cultural differences, were less straightforward. As historically neighboring countries, Terrini and Machtberg observed many of the same holidays - they simply did it differently. Practical changes - such as providing for new students in the schools, having enough medical care to serve changing city populations, or warding against sudden unemployment - were easier to negotiate in parliament than how people might respond to social changes. There was less they could do to plan for how the agnostic Mächtingen might react when religious Terrini newcomers asked for a nativity scene in the city for Christmas, or how the conservative Terrini would welcome young, liberal Mächtingen who drank socially on weekdays and comfortably talked about sex and sexuality.
his ass,” he eventually told Tony before making his own demands. “What was that, Stark? Why are they stealing food?”
“Join me when you can, mein Schafes,” Steve told him with meaning, and with those words he stepped away from the desk and left Tony to do his work.
“Alright,” Steve eventually said, setting his jaw against the roar of disappointment and frustration, and instead he just pushed the pan aside and walked out of the kitchen before he said or did something he would regret.
Steve choked on a laugh before he could contain himself. “Tony! After all the practice Bucky got babysitting me before our engagement, I’m pretty sure nobody’s getting past him. Myself included.”
“Buck, hang on,” Steve quietly disagreed. “Nobody will know the references in those letters better than Mr. Stark. The others are tied up following up on the three victims, so we don’t have enough man hours to get through these quickly.”
“Steve, actually,” Steve replied softly, and while Tony struggled to keep from toppling over or dropping Steve unceremoniously to his feet, Steve indulged in the easy target Tony’s lips became now when they were finally so close. He kissed Tony, over and over again, sometimes playfully, sometimes tenderly, but always with an adoring smile on his lips. “And, if you wouldn’t mind taking me home to that cottage of yours,” he whispered against Tony’s eager, kiss-swollen lips, “I’ve been wearing this bitch of a dress for seventy years, and I’d love to get out of it as soon as possible.”
“Long and short of it is,” Clint continued after a short silence, “the whole, ‘working hard enough to deserve a good life’ line is bullshit. You deserve a good life, period. Until you accept that, you could spend your time earning all the money and recognition in the world, but you’d never be happy.”
“Aw, sorry, mate, that isn’t it,” Karl said sympathetically, and as Tony instinctively turned to look at Steve in confusion, he heard the name of the last song he would ever have guessed.
“We will get there,” Dr. Odinson assured him, “but let us first develop a foundation. We will begin with you, Tony. Tell us about your family.”
“Captain Steven Rogers,” he said with a gracious smile directed only at Steve, “the hero of the hour. I congratulate and thank you, for the preservation of my own life and the sanctity of our great city.”
“I’ve never seen him fall asleep on a stranger before,” Steve said softly, clearly not wanting to wake his dog.
would let twenty five minutes lapse without making a single peep. Not when Tony looked that fucking good.
“That can’t count, Tony,” Steve said in a lowered voice. “I didn’t know how big he was when I stood up. I didn’t know he’d get violent.”
He didn’t wear a collar or a lead, but Steve kept his hand on Tony’s hip at all times, keeping him close. It turned out to be all for the better, since Tony was caught staring at anything and everything moving around them. All around him, creatures of vaguely similar shapes went about their business. Nearly all of them were bipedal and humanoid, but some had long, flowing hair over their bodies like dogs would, while others had scales, long claws, and powerful, jutting snouts.
“Rails would save you the cost of investing in highways. Our trains run on clean energy, they require minimal maintenance, and we could connect even the smallest villages to bigger schools. That way every village doesn’t need a school immediately, but the children would still receive an education. We could focus our resources on hospitals and expanding local government - vocational training for the adults who are too old or disinterested in returning to an academic education—”
“You can either stay awake, or I can wake you when I get in, but we’re having a talk when I come back,” Steve told him. He still spoke quietly, but the teasing edge was gone, and there was no doubt in Tony’s mind that he meant it.
Steve stared back at them all as if he expected someone to revealing this was a cruel prank. It was with a broken sigh that he eventually gave up that hope. “I, I need a smoke. Marlboros, anything, I don’t care what—”
“Bruce, we are in Tribeca,” Tony reminded him at the same time as Thor said, “My friend, perhaps it is time to go home?”
“You said there is no relationship without a future,” Tony reminded him, but quickly seemed to change his mind. Under the scrutiny of Steve’s devoted attention, Tony leaned back in his seat to take a steadying breath. He wasn’t sure how many people were in the room with them, and depending on how much they had already heard, Tony wasn’t likely to have so much time to act.
Steve slammed the door shut and slid the deadbolt home. From the other side of the door, Howard hammered on the door and demanded to be let in, and with every passing second he seemed to grow angrier and louder.
“If you will have it, madame,” he said with a smile, briefly getting up to help Agneta reach her glass of water when she stretched for it. In an effort to help her get comfortable, Tony started the conversation. “I notice your preferred language is not Cimbri. How long have you lived here?”
“Oh, and if you can get one of Stromwell’s quotes right, that’s almost as important as acing the midterm. But you didn’t hear it from me,” she whispered with a sly smile and a playful wink.
“If that’s—whatever,” Tony said, all but throwing his hands up in defeat. “I wouldn’t say it like that, but sure.”
Tony’s breath caught audibly when Steve grasped one side of his ass firmly in his ungloved hand, keeping him spread while he rubbed warm lube over his hole. Tony’s body was still loose from Steve’s cock earlier that morning, and now, Steve’s thumb slipped in easily. He tugged and rubbed at Tony’s firm rim, slathering him with lube before pushing in with two fingers, pumping slow and steady.
“You sound like you know what to look for, Stark,” Natasha said coolly, pointedly stepping back from the desk to urge Tony out of his chair. “I’ll call you if we get more data today.”
Steve stared back at him, and Bucky’s jaw dropped. Bad water made sense if you had nine million people running around, but what did the rest of them drink if New York was considered good?
Days, weeks, months passed by in the first four hours of talking over the material at hand, and the last thing Steve remembered was that they decided to take a break. An few smacks on his shoulder slowly convinced Steve to peel his heavy eyelids open, and he lifted his head to see what was going on. He could feel the crusty drool trailing from his open mouth down to his chin, where it was still thick and wet and awkward. Absently, he scrubbed at his mouth and chin with his hand while trying to focus on what Tony was saying.
“Are you feeling peckish, Steve Rogers?” Tony wondered and held up a large platter he had prepared. There were a variety of semi-soft cheeses, jams, crackers, olives, fruits and nuts arranged around a large pot of hummus and two smaller pots of honey.
“Not sex, Tony,” Steve interjected gently, smirking a little at Tony’s assumption. “If you’re sore, I can help. My hands are better,” he assured him when Tony opened his mouth to reply. “It’s been hours, I feel fine.”
Tony sat up straight in bed. Sleep had abandoned him entirely and he stared down at the dark phone in his hands.
That first night, once the shock and anger and pain of seeing him so unexpectedly subsided, Steve lost hours of sleep wondering why Tony had come back. A man like him could have gone anywhere and become anything, so what was he doing in New York? More importantly: had he really come back after only six months, shared the same streets and delis and Grindr ‘dating’ pool as Steve without Steve ever knowing it? Did Tony live with someone now, someone Steve didn’t know and who kept a toothbrush next to Tony’s, or maybe even had spare keys to Tony’s place?
With Mr. Perfect effortlessly bracing his weight and Marple leading the way, they made steady, if lumbering, progress. Soon they reached the trail, and Marple confidently directed them to the left.
Tony frowned a little at Steve’s drawn expression, as if he wasn’t entirely sure what to make of it. “You want me to go?” he asked after a minute. “If you’re… if you need time.”
“I know, Buck. Peggy will share a statement, it’ll be clear. We just wanted to wait until after the movie came out.”
“I know that look, Tony. You don’t care what I think,” Steve said without an ounce of irony. “So what is it you want to do?”
“Found a favorite?” Tony said with a grin, hoping it would sound more playful than surprised. For reasons he couldn’t explain, he gravitated to Steve’s side. Steve opened his arms to help reel him in until Tony’s was happily nuzzling into his shoulder. His voice was partially muffled against Steve’s arm as he confessed, “I expected a line-up, Steve. Didn’t even want a plug?”
Steve must have sensed some distinction between the way Tony mumbled his name now and how he had said it before in the heat of the moment; without releasing his mouthful, Steve looked up Tony’s body to meet his eyes, and he hummed around Tony’s balls in question. Another full-body shudder rolled through Tony from the divine vibrations of Steve’s mouth, and he was just about to attempt speaking when Steve dug in against Tony’s perennium with the knuckle of his thumb, twisting and grinding to stimulate his prostate from another angle. With his fingers teasing it from the inside, and the firm pressure of his thumb from the outside, Tony’s mouth fell open with a silent gasp, and he melted back into the firm cushions of the couch.
“Alright,” Steve cleared his throat. “None of you stay later than you must today. I don’t have a good feeling about the next few days.”
“It’s not a joke. I am 007,” Steve said in a gentler voice. Without taking pressure off the towel over Tony’s chest, he pulled out his Walther PPK, his signature piece. Tony took it from him, turning it in his hand. It was the same weapon he had help modify; that was his palm print reader, his enhanced optics.
“I—well, I guess tonight's the same as tomorrow morning,” Steve said to himself. For a second, Tony thought he’d been day dreaming again and missed a step, but then Steve leaned back and reached for the ball chain that carried his dog tags around his neck. He held the dog tags in the palm of his hand, weighing them and his decision one last time before gently threading the chain over Tony’s head.
“That’s the last thing I want to do,” Steve told him matter of factly, and in the two seconds it took Tony to climb into the loft, Steve had - true to his word - dropped his pants and climbed under the covers.
“Is he, too, a vehicle for physical injury and aggressive enrichment?” Bruce wondered, eyeing Tony with concern. “As your partner, it is my duty to remind you that 21st century violence has not been acceptable for decades. We are an improved, peaceful society. You should know this more than anyone, Tony Stark,” he added gravely.
“Fine, whatever, I’ll do it if you’ll put some big-boy pants on—let’s go have some drinks, relax, have a good time…”
“Respectful salutations. As an assistant to your estimable Reproductive Medical Screening Professional, henceforth RMSP, Dr. Moses da Graça…”
Steve’s expression pulled down in a slight frown, and in the end, he couldn’t resist asking, “Even though I got knocked out?”
Before millions of their people and their officiating marriage counselor, Steve and Tony had sworn to stand at each other’s sides in sickness and in health, until death do them part. And Steve had every intention of keeping his promise.
Only Tony was left in the conference room to watch as the Beretta appeared on the VideoGram, the nuzzle pressed to Pierce’s temple.
Tony let out a tired sigh, but when he spoke again, he sounded more understanding than Steve expected. “Listen, these people are in a closely knit, elite network. They are smart, they have extensive resources; homes in multiple countries, and ways to get the hell out of dodge within hours. Maybe we can get away with pulling one of them without raising flags, but multiple? They’ll disappear, they’ll change up their MO. And if there are more victims?” he added more quietly, “We might never know.”
“You might want to sit down,” Tony suggested with an awkward, practiced smile and gestured at the stool for added effect.
“No, no—of course not, I couldn’t,” Bruce said immediately, though he seemed a touch regretful about it. He looked unexpectedly close to tears. “Just, you know. They want to start a family.”
It was enough to leave Tony weak in the knees. Quickly, he slipped his hands free of Steve’s gentle grip to wrap his arms around Steve’s neck and fall into his husband's embrace for an eager, laughing kiss. “No, my love,” Tony said between gentle, playful kisses, “it’s only that, when you say such words, it makes me wish we never had to leave the palace.”
“I… uh,” Tony suddenly stalled, a little bewildered by the interruption. “No, sir. No, I am only trying to warn you, Captain Steve. As your steward in this transition, it is my responsibility and commitment to you to prepare you as best that I can for the 22nd. Your trust in me,” he started to say, then pressed his lips into a tight line of resistance.
“Mango!” Tony and Steve cheered in unison, and Tony reached for the dog with eager excitement. Mango spent the first handful of seconds nuzzling and licking Tony’s face and neck all over before he seemed to realize there were other puppies on the couch next to them, and he squirreled his way right out of Tony’s arms to leap into Fran and Star-Lord’s intense wrestling game.
“Tony and I ran into each other at a rodeo out in Iowa when I was seven,” Clint told Steve when they all were sat down for breakfast a few minutes later.
Steve sat up with a grunt of alarm and tore the helmet off. Tony jumped at the sudden interruption, and a part of Steve intended to crush the unnatural machine between his bare hands until he realized Tony was staring at him with concern. Instead, he quickly put it a safe distance away from himself on the floor, and eyed it with a mixture of anxiety and suspicion.
“I don’t live in Boston, but Maya did. Her family is from here, and they’re well connected with the government and—hell, everyone. So she filed for divorce here.”
“Feet on the bench,” Steve instructed once Tony had adjusted enough to stopped squirming and whimpering on the full length of his cock. “And, remember: everybody is watching.”
“She said they took care of the aliens you saw in the wormhole,” Steve agreed when he got himself together, and he only needed a moment longer to guess what had happened. “Was it a lie? Tony, did you find evidence that Thanos is still out there? Did she lose the stones?”
“I do,” Tony answered immediately, biting the inside of his cheeks to keep from smiling. “I gladly accept the honor, sir.”
In the end, he waved off the officer and knocked on the door. He was armed, after all. He could take care of himself.
“Cities are cities,” he eventually said. “Geneva’s beautiful, but I’ve never seen mountains like these. We don’t have alps back home.”
After all, if half of what Steve knew about Howard was true, the humiliation of Tony being conferred the most prestigious scientific prize - a prize Howard hadn’t achieved it in his whole lifetime - would be something to set him off.
“Say Tony’s right: we get all the data we need and they’re all there. We’re still working with two years of dating history. What are the chances that they only have one match in common?”
“On one condition,” Tony murmured under his breath, threading his fingers through Steve’s thick, blond hair and giving it a firm tug that Steve hadn’t seen coming. After all these years - centuries - it was enough to leave Steve panting softly for breath and staring at Tony’s lips like a depraved man eager for a long, deep drink.
Steve gravitated to him before Tony got very far. He was still talking to someone over the phone, but Tony could see him smiling at the tray, then at him, as if somehow Tony’s gesture had been priceless. Before Tony had a chance to leave, Steve muted the phone and reeled Tony in for a grateful, lingering kiss.
“And I haven’t been cleaner in my entire life,” Steve complained in return, his lips tugging up at the corners as he strained to keep from grinning.
“You like it!” Tony cheered with a bark of laughter, snatching up the canvas bag to drop into the seat next to Steve. “Man, plot twist. So babe is a no-go, but Sparky—”
“That’s most of it,” Steve said and glanced his way with a grin before finishing cleaning after himself. “I thought we could go find Lila and Rhodes, maybe Bucky if he isn’t sick of us.”
On the screen, new footage taken from a great distance showed the king’s red and gold jet getting shot out of the sky. It fell to the earth in a lifeless arc, trailing smoke and fire.
Steve took the pen, and with a last glance at Howard, he followed Tony’s lead, signing and initialling the document with care.
“Since when am I your hero?” Steve asked, curious in his expression, and, despite his earlier tension, he moved into the intimate space made available for him between Tony’s torso and his arm. Whether he intended it or not, Steve rested a hand against Tony’s arm, close enough that his thumb could absently brush across Tony’s bicep.
Steve’s hands balled up into fists. Through gritted teeth and a rising anger, he said, “You read my text messages?”
“Of course,” Steve said with great pride, “and you know I fully support that, right? You’re going to do so many great things, Brock.”
“Tony is safe,” Jim promised. He didn’t only sound calm, he gentled his tone as if he had anticipated Steve’s distress. “The palace is secure, Steve. I’m calling to tell you Tony is resting. I assigned Natasha to him until you return.”
Nothing stopped the Mayor from taking what had been willingly offered to him. The chief priest’s body was his to use, and Brigid’s attendants his to command. Newfound power brewed into momentary delirium. A chance to taint a body so sacred, so exquisite, to claim him for his own and take what was offered to him without remorse. He could throw the chief priest to the altar and order his twelve attendants restrain him there, spread his legs and bare him to Torin’s depravity. But Torin would not satisfy Brigid in a matter of seconds or minutes. This ritual was an extended act of worship on her mortal form where Torin proved himself worthy of leadership. Proved himself worthy by surrendering his human vice and gluttonous lust in the face of divine temptation to serve the hundreds waiting in the audience to see the appetite of their patron goddess satisfied.
Steve skimmed his clean hand up and down Tony’s flank to soothe him, rubbing the heel of his palm over Tony’s nipple, then pinching and rolling it between his thumb and forefinger until Tony arched up and mewled. Tony clutched at Steve’s hair, lightly tugging as he moaned and garbled demands for Steve to hurry it up, to touch him, because he needed more—but his words died with a sudden hiss as Steve dug his fingertips into the firm muscle of Tony’s chest and scraped five faint, red lines across his chest and abdomen.
Tony blinked his eyes up to see concern in Steve’s expression. Steve dropped the sweater he’d been rolling up and came to Tony instead, kneeling at the bed in front of him. He held Tony loosely in his arms, giving Tony enough distance even in the strong, protective circle of his body. Tony never felt safer than in Steve’s arms, and inwardly he wished Steve would hold him closer and squeeze him tighter like he would never let go.
“Lights on full,” he heard and he squinted in the sudden sunrise. Then, much closer: “Captain Steven G. Rogers, are you well?”
His smile might have been enough to fool strangers and the curious onlookers watching them walk by arm in arm, but not his husband. Steve shook his head no, and with a devilish grin that only spelled trouble, he said, “No, I’m asking you to kick his ass.”
The only difference was, Queen Sarah never told him what to do: Tony had made intentional changes after seeing her, and he chose what to adopt and what to leave out. He couldn’t take that power from Steve, and, selfishly, he would never see the leader his husband could grow to be if he went back on his word now. In so many ways, going to a crowded and badly lit Christmas market without security was the worst idea he had ever heard. But not all of Tony’s decisions would ever be as easy as the choice between respecting his husband, or fearing the remote (and admittedly infinitesimal) possibility of being assassinated in his own city.
Steve glanced in the direction of the bull, then looked back at Tony. “How about you take the reins tonight?”
Sharon nearly choked on the orange juice she was drinking, which was a shame, because the juice was freshly squeezed from oranges imported from southern California. She cleared her throat and poured herself some more.
“Fuck you, it’s entitlement,” Tony said, cutting him off. But this wasn’t the hill Steve intended to die on, so he nodded and made a show of accepting Tony’s conclusion.
“I expect the house to be spotless when I come home,” she told the three of them. “You’re adults. Divide the chores among yourselves.”
That, of all things, took Bucky by surprise. He cracked a smile, and with a roll of his eyes, snickered to himself. Seeing his opening, Steve gently nudged Tony’s leg with his own and asked the question he’d been dying to ask all week. “What was it you were saying about dueling penises on Tuesday?”
Steve liked where her head was at, but when he looked at Natasha, her expression was as unclear as ever. When she finally spoke, it caught Steve well off guard.
“Don’t tease him, ma,” Clint said with a straight face at the same as Tony cried, “Every inch counts!“
The lustful glint in Steve’s eyes softened into an affectionate gaze, and he crawled a little closer to brush his lips over Tony’s in an adoring kiss. “You say plenty, sweetheart. Besides, today’s your day,“ Steve assured him in a playful whisper. “It’s my turn.”
Rhodey looked up from cutting the second rope of dough, presumably to ask about the ornament Natasha mentioned, but he was distracted by a sudden waft of whatever Steve was making on the stove.
"Who do you think can do the low plank for longer, a yogi or a pilates—pilati?” Graham wondered innocently, then turned back to his audience with an encouraging look. “Ladies and gentlemen, wouldn’t we like to know?”
Steve’s first coherent thought was that Tony really did smell nice. He groaned softly then, and when Tony whispered kindly-worded apologies and praise for what Steve had done, Steve decided to kick it up a notch, from confused groaning to plaintive moaning.
“Hold—hold up, hang on, Tony,” he waved his hands and tried to find the right words so he wouldn’t sound crazy. “You’ve left me instructions in the event of your death? What kind of instructions?”
“What is this, Steve’s first world tour?” Bucky glowered after Coulson finished explaining the proposed changes in their schedule. “It’s been three weeks, Phil. That’s long enough.”
“It’s my Religion of Southeast Asia class,” Steve explained as he wandered away from the library with no destination in mind. “This chapter is about the role of astrology as sign of providence and tool for divination.”
“Did you know, this is the longest relationship I’ve ever been in?” he said softly into the space between them.
Tony sniffed in feigned hurt. “We could try this again without the costume if you like, if that would make you feel better. You know, only if it’s for your benefit.”
Steve scrubbed a hand over his face and slowly shook his head to himself. Jane seemed about as eager to continue the conversation as he did, so the rest of the short drive passed in silence. It wasn’t until Jane pulled the car into a small lot and parked that she spoke again.
He disconnected the call and tossed the phone away on his nightstand before realizing Tony was staring at him again.
When Tony’s long, low moans of pleasure and praise and gratitude slowly turned to soft wincing and twitching discomfort, Steve pulled his hands away, but he still couldn’t look away. Tony was the most beautiful man he’d ever seen, and he was never as breathtaking as he was now—sated, vulnerable, and blissed out. This was a side of him that was all Steve’s, no other man (or woman) shared in Tony in this way, saw him like this or felt him like this.
“I’ll only let you climb on if you promise not to fall,” Rhodey told Tony before he got anywhere close to the bull. “Promise?”
“974 dollars?” Tony choked out, staring up at Steve in shock. The pure, unmitigated guilt of all the sacrifices Steve must have endured to afford this hit Tony like a punch in the gut. His heart was racing and his stomach was turning inside out, but before he could speak, Steve gently covered Tony’s lips with his hand.
Before he changed his mind, Steve marched out of his bedroom. Tony picked up his head without looking away from his texting, but when Steve only hovered in the sitting room and didn’t retake his seat, Tony paused his texting and looked up.
his body was reacting this way. In either case, Steve sure as hell wasn’t going to risk a meaningful friendship and happy working relationship over a goddamn
a great dancer, someone who liked to have a good time. He’d only really ever seen or heard good things about the guy, and Tony deserved someone who made him happy.
But instead of smiling again or relaxing at their very near destination, Tony felt Mr. Perfect body grow stiff against his side.
“I need to tell you some things,” Tony said in a nervous rush, then cleared his throat and tried again. “Three things. Important things. They’re not all good things, so get ready to be mad, but if you could hear me out before you got
She was no better than the child who pitted one parent against the other, but Steve didn’t miss a step.
“We’re going home today,” Tony talked right over her, powering right through her perfectly valid anger. “We need to reschedule tomorrow and Friday’s meetings: we’re going home—”
“Don’t think you’ve ever said that to me with my clothes on,” Steve teased him in a lowered voice, and Tony practically squeaked before the giggles took him again.
. His body arched away with a sudden jolt, but Steve kept him where he was with his hips angled up and his cheeks spread. He grazed his teeth across Tony’s skin, biting and sucking at his tender, puckered hole until a mixture of Steve’s spit and lube tickled down Tony’s back. Whatever it was Steve wanted - to minimize the mess (unlikely), to keep Tony’s ass as wet as possible (undoubtedly), or just to drive Tony out of his mind (absolutely) - Steve pressed Tony further into his position, pushed his legs further apart, and dove into Tony’s bared crack to lap up the lube and spit he was single-handedly responsible for.
And then he hung up. Tony waited for several seconds before looking at his phone to confirm, but sure enough, his wonderful, thoughtful, loving boyfriend had hung up on him without reminding Tony that he loved him.
There were buttons for everything - for pushing his seat back, lowering the seat, and Tony talked him through adjusting the side and rear view mirrors. Even the ignition was a push start.
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers,” the doctor said with an inviting smile, and he stepped back to let them in. “It is a pleasure to meet you, gentlemen. I am Dr. Odinson.”
Tony practically draped himself across the desk to tell Jane everything he knew, whispering urgently as if he simply couldn’t get the words out fast enough. “According to the archival discs, these and many more acts of epic bravery are all true. His earliest tenure as Captain America was back in the 1940s—over 200 years ago! In that time, his nefarious nemesis was none other than Johann Schmidt, briefly a close confidant of the most despicable, loathsome specimen of our species. You know of whom I speak,” he said quietly after a brief pause. “I will not utter his name.”
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, this imaginative display of barbaric intention was uncouth even in your time,” Pierce said with a tired sniff, “not all men lust for murder—”
, not purple,” Bucky corrected, and he quickly reclaimed the once-offending nail polishes as if they need rescuing from Steve’s judgmental reach. “And… alright, sometimes, she likes to get creative with her toes, okay? Like, wearing unicorn print underwear, or Power Puff Girls socks. But you didn’t hear it from me.”
They had been delivered to the front desk while Steve was with his second patient of the morning, so by the time he came to see what the commotion was about, the bouquet of mariposa skies had filled the reception with a delicate, sweet fragrance.
“I am profoundly sorry, Jane Foster,” Tony replied quietly at the same time as the computer announced another 1-8-7.
Steve gaped back at him like a drowning fish, until he dropped the act with a big sigh. “Closer to eight, but sure, whatever. You made your point.”
“Make me proud, Tony,” Steve told him quietly. “Impress me, and I’ll feed you from my cock until you sleep.”
Steve’s hard rhythm abruptly became a series of aggressive, desperate thrusts as he lost himself to the hot, greedy pulsing clutch of Tony’s body.
“Oh,” Steve whispered quietly, his cheeks coloring in his embarrassment. Tony felt his heart take an ill-advised tumble as he witnessed this man push the frail boundary between
“Sure,” Steve said, resisting the childish instinct to wave goodbye as he watched him go. Once the door closed behind him, Steve glanced at his own watch. Hawley’s meeting would start in twenty minutes, surely she’d be in her office by now.
Just like that, Maria’s expression changed to happier than joy. “I’m glad you asked, darling,” she said with a beaming smile. “Dad and I heard y’all were getting married—”
“It is a fertility ritual, the practice that keeps the small town of Marham lush and temperate year round,” Tony explained, his voice deep and soothing and Steve couldn’t look away from his lips as Tony slid in closer to him on the couch. “It is performed once every season according to ancient Celtic traditions. The elected leader of Marham has to prove he can satisfy the town’s chief priest… before the entire town, the priest is tied to the altar,” Tony whispered against Steve’s wet, parted lips. “His body subjected to the people he served, vulnerable and exposed, a sacrificial gift to their gods…”
, it connected across Steve’s left temple and the force of it threw Steve into a wall. Tony lunged to catch him, but Steve was too dazed, off-balance, and already falling; Tony didn’t stand a chance. They crumbled together an uncoordinated heap, with Tony cradling Steve in his arms.
The thundering sound of boots filled the hallway, and Rumlow laughed. Natasha was the first to react by running out to meet the coming threat, but Bucky stalled, staring at his best friend as Steve and Rumlow rolled to their feet.
If Pierce had calming words to offer, Steve had no interest in hearing them. He marched away from the scene of the crime without a look back.
“I mean we’ve been good about talking about what we want and like before, this should be no different,” he reminded Tony. Whether it was instinct or Steve’s sixth sense, he absently stroked his fingers down and up the back of Tony’s neck in a gentle, comforting caress. Tony shuddered at the touch and couldn’t help but relax and lean into it.
,” Steve huffed unhappily, because he knew what that felt like, and despite his hopes and dreams, this
That’s so nice,” he whined, his face-plant in the cushions muffling his voice somewhat. “I looked at you and thought you looked tired and hungry.”
. He’d only meant to take a quick peek, but Josh was running late and who could blame Steve for spending his free time thinking about Tony?
His first customer was anything but discouraged; it smirked up at Tony while it continued its insistent kneading with one hand, and stroked Tony off with the other, fast and practical, unbothered by how the dry scales of its hand might feel on a human cock. Tony’s body jerked desperately, whimpering and begging for them to be more gentle, to go slower, but nothing mattered to Steve or to his customer except for his hard cock that visibly throbbed from the attention, and already coated the alien’s hand with enough precum to drip a puddle to the floor. When the creature finally closed its mouth over the head of Tony’s cock, it bit down just hard enough with its four rows of teeth to make Tony come with a painful scream.
Some years later, though, there's a big match going on - not quite The title match, but a big high profile match in Madrid, with Steve as a defending champion. Madrid was a big enough city and so removed from America that when Tony left the boxing world behind and moved there, he didn't think he'd ever have to worry about needing to hide. Why should he, when the chances of them running into each other were so slim? Steve wouldn't even know he was there to go looking for him, Tony having left his whole career in boxing and competitive sports behind. He had a new life in Spain, where he had invested himself in starting up a youth center where neighborhood kids could go and learn a few things. Serious things like self-defense, or even just playing around.
“What’s this, Barnes?” a woman called through the crowd, and like a shot, Steve veered off his course for Leticia to see her instead. He wrapped his arms around a red-headed woman and spun her in the air in his joy.
Tony didn’t have to look to know what it was. The way his day was going, he didn’t feel the need to look away from well-formed pecs (and the hard nipples that were so clearly visible through the sweaty shirt in this chilly weather) to know Marple had yet again tried to make a peace offering by returning the toy she’d stolen.
“They’re both great at what they do,” Steve agreed diplomatically. Then, remembering what Tony had said earlier, he said, “In this though, Danny Devito really stands out.”
Steve, Maria, Brock, and Sharon were all asked to wait outside Hawley’s office while she and Stark had an initial discussion among themselves over where their clients stood on the case. They were given copies about the client and the case at hand so they’d be familiar with the details when Hawley was ready for them.
Still hesitant to believe anything of what Steve was telling him, Tony frowned in thought. He remembered his dreams, the ones where Steve came to him night after night, like some angel of sexual deliverance. Curious despite himself to see what Steve might be offering, Tony asked him to prove it. So Steve swept the blankets off his naked body and laid back against the firm cushions in the nest. With his eyes on his pet, Steve closed his fist around his own soft cock, and with the fast and firm grip that always did the trick, he quickly worked himself to a full hardness.
In the short time he had been with Steve, Steve only allowed him to nurse on his cock in the mornings for the harvest. What traces of contentment lingered in his body from his morning feeding were enough to keep him to the next day. To have two feedings in one day was a unusual, and only when Steve felt particularly generous or proud.
But when he glanced over at the Captain, Steve was doubled over in his seat with his head in his hands, silent as the grave.
“Wow, would you look at that,” Steve said with the kind of false cheer to make a panda cry. “Boiled chicken with kale salad and, oh, goodie! Ten whole almonds for dessert later.”
Tony gasped softly and stared at him as if he had been struck in the face. “You…. Steve, you cannot mean that. You are a hero, a—you’re Captain America.”
“This store is not where the one percent shop,” Tony replied in a tired voice, not bothering to look away from what he was doing anymore. “This is where the people who aspire to one day approach the one percent shop.”
“I called him,” Natasha said before Steve had to ask. “Steve, you said it yourself: they’re four dead runaways over two years; no-one’s taking it seriously. We need his help. Maybe he can connect enough dots to convince the Captain that this is a case.”
“This is for me,” Steve whispered, as if that made it better. He lifted Tony just enough to reach into his own clothes and free his cock, then lined them up so he could pull Tony down, impaling him inch for inch.
All of Steve’s joyful excitement evaporated as they descended the stairs of the palace and he noticed the small caravan of cars awaiting them. Bucky and Natasha were standing at the passenger side door of the black stretch car, and a total of eight security officers waited to climb into the two SUVs that would lead and follow the kings’ car.
“Mine,” he hissed against Tony’s ear with Tony’s earlobe captured between his sharp teeth, punctuating his claim with a forceful snap of his hips. “Don’t you forget.”
Brock opened his mouth, but he couldn’t seem to formulate any words. Steve smiled back at him, then made a show of checking his watch.
“But it’s ten months tomorrow,” he said quietly, hoping it didn’t sound as pathetic as he suspected. “I graduate… I graduate next week. Defense, papers signed. I’m done.”
“The story’s been with me a while,” Tony said quietly, tapping his head. In place of his earlier playful tip-toeing, he walked slowly to avoid disrupting his work. If Steve didn’t know any better, Tony looked tired.
Of all the things Tony could ask in the middle of a confession of his feelings (that Steve refused to call love yet), that wasn’t close to what Steve expected. His cheeks and the back of his neck warmed so quickly he knew he was blushing, and he couldn’t help but laugh and roll his eyes at himself.
“So, how many of them were named Hector?” Steve asked casually. Tony didn’t move the script to show his face, but Steve didn’t need to see his face to interpret his reaction: he watched Tony’s shoulders relax and heard Tony snickering behind his make-shift shield, and felt relief settle in his chest.
“Shouldn’t my opinion of you be mine to make?” Steve pushed back before Tony insisted on saving Steve from himself. “If
He was only gone for a minute or two, but Steve could have sworn it was much longer than that before he had a plain manila folder in his hands. Tony tucked himself in beside Steve on the couch, following along over Steve’s shoulder as they read Marham’s first fertility rites from
“Gonna hang around there all day, or are you going to fuck me, soldier?” he rasped with feigned nonchalance. Steve, who’d grown tense with concern, laughed breathlessly into the back of his neck. He pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s shoulder, whispering dear apologies for ‘losing focus.’
Tony felt more than heard the growl resonating deep in Steve’s chest, and somehow, Steve managed the whole interaction without saying a word. He pulled Tony’s hood up immediately, doing what he could to protect Tony’s privacy as he steered them away from the nosey teens on the pier and back towards the car.
“Put a muzzle on him next time, for all our sakes,” the voice muttered, clearly addressing Steve this time, and god, when did his life come to this? All Steve wanted was to get back to his job; was that too much to ask?
Relief revived Steve with an intoxicating power that neither oxygen or fire possessed. In that one glimmering second he felt
Flood lights came all around them at the same time, temporarily blinding them against the vacuumous darkness of the night. Steve startled back with a wince of pain, covering his eyes and squinting up at the house to make out what was going on.
“It’s like you said, Tony,” Steve replied just as quietly, “where you go, I go. That means no sacrifice plays.”
“I thought I’d call him, invite him out to something,” Steve replied, trying to answer her question but obviously still struggling with
Tony face-planted into Steve’s pecs, hiding from the world and failing to muffle his baffled, breathless giggling. His infectious laughter delighted Steve and, unable to resist, Steve wrapped his arms around him to close the minimal space between them, squeezing him close as they swayed and Tony slowly melted against him. They had hugged before—relieved or celebratory hugs; quick, manly, platonic hugs—but Steve had never dared he’d have a chance to hold Tony this close or for this long, or to see Tony so unguarded.
