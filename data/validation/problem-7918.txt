her father fell. He became a different man. A cold, callous man, which just scared Toni off the idea of love.
Steve chuckled again as he placed a kiss to her forehead. "Oh, that letter is going to be a death of me."
*O*O*
"I'm not the one who bolted out of the bar in a fit of jealousy," he counted as he rounded yet another corner. Before anyone could speak another word, Barnes shoved her against the wall and held her there for a few seconds. "Ssh," he ordered as the footsteps got louder.
There was a short pause. "Because I love you, and you deserve the truth."
The Captain shook his head. "Agent?" he asked, noticing his firm hand shake. A hand shake told a lot about a person, and this was no different. The Agent's strong grip was telling, and he wasn't nervous at all, which was unusual. Most people nowadays got star struck around him.
"You are always the gentleman."
After reading through the file, she sat completely still. She knew Rogers blamed himself for Bucky's death but, according to the files, it wasn't. Bucky was doing what he was trained to and it wasn't anyone's fault but that HYDRA's soldier who fired at Barnes who was foolish enough to block using Rogers' shield. She knew Rogers felt guilty because he felt that he could've done better to save Barnes' life. Toni didn't blame him for it at all.
Steve could feel her shudder under his grasp as he moved up to her upper thigh. He took a few exact seconds to dry the inner parts of her leg, trying to control his own shudder. Again, he found his pants way too constricting, but he tried not to give it too much attention. After making sure each part of her legs were dry, he toss the towel aside with the rest of the wet articles.
she yelled at herself. "You don't know me very well," she replied.
With a deep breath, she rounded the corner and stepped into the garage. Though she was very much a car woman and the sight of her babies brought a smile to her face, she saw her vehicles as nothing more than an escape. While not bothering to change or fix her blouse, she grabbed the keys to the nearest car- a two door, white Audi-, and hopped in. "JARVIS, once the Mark 7 arrives in New York, please reroute it my location."
Natasha asks.
*O*O*
"Howard did. Back in the lab before you vanished, Toni jokingly told him that, but he didn't figure it out after you disappeared. However, we didn't find out until after she was born and we wondered why he named his daughter after Toni," he said. He tried to laugh but it came out as a cough. "He puffed out his chest like a proud father and gloated that his daughter would invent time travel."
"Yes, was, but the main purpose changed. The power sucking is just a side effect to the new purpose."
"Yes, we did, Sir."
The nurse tried to yell out for help, but Toni couldn't allow her to do that. She knocked her out using cast. "Urgh," she shrieked in pain. She stood up and glanced outside to see if anyone was coming. When she saw no one was coming, she closed the door and turned her attention back to the nurse. She started to undress the nurse. "Now, listen. I'm not going to mess with you. I just need the uniform so I can sneak out of here."
"Do you want to marry him?" Sharon followed up with.
"That he would be." Toni could admit that she would be getting the same face from Barnes. And when she wasn't being stupid, she could admit that Barnes was the only one responsible for his actions. Well, not really. She could blame Hydra. However, in her darkest moment, she couldn't see that. "And he wouldn't be quiet about it."
"I wasn't asking for permission. I'm just letting you know," she responded while avoiding his question like the plague.
"Where would you go?"
THE END
Pepper glanced toward Steve, studying the tension in his shoulders. Though she had no idea of what Toni said, she knew it couldn't have been anything good. However, she also knew it must've been more than that conversion to send the genius out of the tower. "What did she say?"
Toni shouldn't have known better. She didn't have the best of luck, and she should've expected something like this. In her life, something was always ready to hit the fan when things were looking up, and it felt worse recently. Between the nightmares and the breaks, she couldn't catch a break. Did someone hate her?
Jim groans. "Keep the bedroom talk to the bedroom. I don't want to see or hear that."
"That's in the past," Tony says, bitterly. "Why are you bringing it up?" He doesn't want to think about it, and he doesn't want to think about how close the two are.
having a good day, though he could say that he wasn't good week. He was having a horrible week, and he may deny it to anyone who would dare say it, but he was grumpy, angry and bitter. He was tired both of the violence and cruelness of these modern day criminals, who made him sick to his stomach. He had seen
"What?!" Tony yells, his hands balling. Where the hell was he doing these times? How didn't he know? "Show me each time," he orders, leaning toward the monitor. He does not like the fact that Rogers had put him to bed over 15 times.
Natasha let out a sigh, mumbling someone under her breath. The STRIKE team just looked a little shell shock. "Was he wearing a parachute?" Rollins asked.
She looked at him for a second before she bolted out of the room.
Steve glared. "Either you're negative or perverted. I don't know which is worse." He walked pass his best friend and out into the living room. It took a few seconds for Steve to realize that Toni was missing. "Where did she go?" he asked shocked and worried. "She had nowhere to go." His heart started to beat fast at the thought of her alone in the snow. "She could die out there." When he had found her the first time, she was almost frozen to death. Her lips had been blue.
"Better here than a park bench."
Toni was definitely reading a tone with him now, but she was aware that it could all be in her head. "You just have to hope that you didn't let anyone else touch my stuff as then I might have to explode, JARVIS. I know Clint has been eyeing my Private selection of alcohol," she said as she stepped into the elevator. She didn't have any time to waste. She had to get her reactor checked out.
This was why she on the top tower tonight, staring up at the night sky. With a hand grasping the ring and dog tags, Toni forced herself to take a deep breath, as she tried to compel herself to come up with an answer. She wished she knew what she wanted. She wished she knew what to do. Her mind was a mess, and working on little sleep, she couldn't tell what was up or down anymore. She was at a complete lost.
Steve's heart was racing, as worry and guilt rushed through him, and he had to do something. Screw everything, Screw Fury. Toni needed him and he was going to go to her no matter what, though it seemed like that was already happening thanks to the AI. There was no doubt that was JAVIS' plan when he hijack the jet. But, Steve couldn't help but wonder why Toni hadn't called him herself?
"Yes, Tony," he says with a smile. "You're so forgetful at times." He adds as he pulls Tony into a side hug. The genius doesn't go into Steve's arms easy, but he doesn't fight him either. "Are you okay?" There're a few worried tones in his voice.
Toni nodded.
"No can do." Came his reply.
"Did you know about this?" There was no judgment in his voice.
Toni knew he was correct and she was being stupid; however, she could help but think she was missing her shot by not going after Madame Hydra. She knew that woman knew something, but it was stupid to think she could get anything out of her. "I know," she said, exhaling slowly.
As Toni closed her eyes to think, she heard footsteps, swishing in the mud. She knew who it was before she opened her eyes and fought to ignore the growing warmth in her heart knowing it was him. "Howard," she uttered as she opened her eyes.
Peggy and Toni struggled on the floor as they were trying to overpower the other. The gun was a good foot away from them and no matter how hard Toni reached for the gun, she couldn't grasp it. "I just need the device! That's it," Toni protested as she tried to knock out the Agent.
"Wow," she uttered, out of breath. That kiss had taken everything out of her; it was toe curling, stealing her breath. "Maybe, I should say that again? Maybe with less clothes," she said, giving him her best come hither look.
Steve glanced at the Suit as it closed and stepped back from Toni. "Finished early," he said, looking back to Toni. He watched her as she shifted to her right side, looking like she didn't want to put any weight on her left. He eyed the leg for a second, before he glanced up at her. She looked like he imagined she looked, but this vision was shivering.
"Sark, I don't have all day!" Salty yelled from inside of his tent.
The computerized, accented voice was calming to the Genius, and she focused on it as he spoke. She wasn't sure what the AI was saying, but she listened to the pitches in this tones. She listened to JARVIS as he rambled off possible remedies for her shortness of breath. When this continued, the AI started to tell Toni stories, trying to snap her back to the reality. "JARVIS," she groaned, as she finally seemed to catch her breath after a few long minutes.
At least, she had the Hulk and Thor to save her, but the others weren't so lucky, which was what her nightmare reminded her. Halfway through her falling to her death, Bucky entered, replacing her, and she could do nothing but watch while he fell to his death, and that feeling was the worst. It was like someone had stabbed her in the heart repeatedly, and nothing she did could rid herself of that horrible feeling. She hated it.
She let out a laugh. "So for Barnes nickname, I could only think of Bucky."
However, the loud shriek stopped, but there was a still a heavy ringing in her ear. For a few sounds, she wondered if she had gone deaf, but after a few seconds, she could hear the suit as the man flung it against a large trash bins. However, it still took her awhile to fully regain her sense. Everything felt off. "You wanted me out of the suit," she groaned, seeing her now disabled suit. This was a game to his man. How did she miss that? What the hell did he use on her?
yes, threw her- her to the ground like a sack of a potato and shielded her with his entire body. Toni didn't know how long he held her there, but she could only focus on Fury, who collapsed in front of her with a loud thump. That sight of him staring with his mouth open would haunt her for the foreseeable future. To make it worst, blood poured from his chest like a river, making it difficult to determine how many times he was shoot.
inch. The hands start at the top of the genius and slowly work their down, touching as much skin as possible. Tony's face heats and brightens up to unnatural colors, and he doesn't have it in him to smash those
"I'm going to stop you right there," she interrupted, finally able to wriggle her toes, though that was all she could do. "The restate up here is too valuable to waste on names," she said, pointing to her head. "Now what do you want?"
Banner was hard at work, trying to recreate the device that Toni made. He had her blue prints, which could've been in another language for all Steve knew, in front of him. "Yes, Steve?" Banner asked.
"Wait, that anniversary is today?" Rogers asked, surprised.
God, Toni missed JARVIS. How the hell did she survive without him? "Thanks, JARVIS," she uttered, stepping toward the flag pole in the middle of the camp. It had lost its solid, white colorings ages ago, and the rust stared to poke through; an abandoned American Flag hanged from the pole, untouched in years. The faded flag had seen better days as it had started to come apart at the ends. It was like the rest of the camp: forgotten. It looked like people just left, which was odd to the genius. She could never understand that concept.
Falsworth laughed. "I think she would make a fine additional to the team."
Loki glanced up. "I'm not overly fond of what follows," he replied, playing with his hands.
hiding…though he knows that's a lie. He just doesn't want to admit that he's hiding, even if he can't deny it. He
"You don't know everything!" she yelled as she took the wrench out of her pocket and threw it at him.
Steve nodded. "I thought he was right."
So before Toni could even come up with the idea, he shot her down as gently as he could. He played up his non-relationship with Peggy, which wasn't fair to Peggy. At first, he thought he had imagined the pain in Toni's eyes as it disappeared in a blink of an eye but later he could see how crushed she was. It completely crushed him to see her like that, but it had to be done. She was in enough pain; she couldn't handle anything else. It also wouldn't have been right. She was his best friend's dame, even if he saw her first.
Even with everything happening, something felt off. There was something in the air that she couldn't place and it was bugging the shit out of her. With her head pounding in her ear, she felt like she was getting beat up, though she hadn't 'cool down' since the capture. She had been running hot for a while now, feeling like she was going to overheat at any second, and this feeling didn't seem to be going away. Even now, she felt like she was melting. "I need air," she announced loudly, surprising Rhodes and not giving him any time to reply. His eyes were wide as Toni was out the door.
"Hey! Hey, so not nice," Toni stated. "And that's my job."
"The Captain does have a certain pull with the Asset, but it isn't as strong as Stark's. And she's still alive because we need her alife." The Handler gave Rumlow a look as he turned to the television in the room. The Television was rarely off as the handler was always scanning the news. He was always looking for any hints of the Asset's work, not that he ever found anything. The Asset was taught not to be noticed, not to draw attention, and that was what he did. "Did you get the device?" he asked.
"What are you thinking, Toni?"
"Just hand me the towel, Barton," Steve ordered, giving him a look before taking a towel. He knew he needed to get these wet clothes off, but he needed to calm her first. He needed her to relax, or else, it would turn into a fight.
It was a torture to look upon his face. Before Steve, the idea of love scared her. Love was a concept she didn't really understand or believed in. Even with the two timelines mixing in her head, she never really experienced it in either life. Between watching her father crumble under the death of her mother and her many failed 'relationship' – if they could be called that—, she had learned love was not real. Yes, she cared deeply for Jim and Pepper and some might call it love, but that was different. There were things that she kept from them, things she was too ashamed to tell. Too scared that they would leave. With true love, there was no secrets. Nothing to be hidden. She had that with Steve before she even realized it.
"We're glad she did," Steve says as he closes the distance between them.
Toni narrowed her eyes, because it was that mindset that brought planes and ships down. Fury's beloved heliocraft would have gone down if it wasn't for her actions. "I said I wasn't scared. No need to try to baby me."
"I wouldn't," he replied, pulling into a parting spot. He had such a big smile on his face that Toni couldn't pull her eyes away from.
she thought. "You know I can't help you," she stated, as she thought about the future. She didn't know when exactly, but Salty's men would get captured and Rogers would save them. Though Toni hated the idea that some of these men would be taken and killed, she couldn't do anything. Rogers had to save them.
Clint flexed his fist. "What does that mean? Where is she?"
Pepper tried to keep back her glare, because she knew she needed to calm down; however, it was so hard lately. She had been feeling out of the loop lately, and it was only made worse with Toni's disappearance. "I thought you three were looking for Captain Rogers," she asked. She kind of hated that the Captain right now.
"I don't need you; I am not taking your offer. I got here on my own and I will get home on my own." That statement got her mind going. What the hell was he talking about?
"Miss Potts wants you to eat and Captain Rogers wants to speak to you."
"Dude," Wilson interrupts, whining. "I don't want to think about that."
"I don't think you would like any answer I give you."
Steve looked at her, with those annoying puppy dog eyes (that he would deny). It was hard not to be mad at him looking at those puppy dog eyes. "You know-" He started but he was cut off by Barnes again.
"Tones," Jim called from the entryway of the boat's cabin. He was unsteady on his feet as strong waves rocked the boat, but he didn't let that stop him. He was on a mission.
"You bet."
"You will see in time," Dugan said with a knowing smile.
He knew this baseball game. "The game, it's from May 1941. I know because I was there." Steve replied sharply as he got to his feet. "Now, I'm gonna ask you again. Where am I?" He took a step toward her.
Steve's smile fell slightly. "Yea, but don't you love the smell?"
Howard picked up the damaged shield that Rogers had been using. "I hear you're uh...kinda attached?"
"So how are you?" Bruce asked again. He was still eyeing Steve.
"I need one of those cores!" She stated as she leaned forward. Her elbows were on his desk and she was giving him her puppy dog face.
Barnes smirked as he raised her hands above her head and walked her back into a tree. "But I'm a loveable ass."
"Which is a shame," she said as she continued to struggle against her restraints.
He eyed the two sets of dog tags handing around her neck. He could see his and Bucky's name on them, and he couldn't help but feel possessive of the brunette in front of him. Ever since she had gotten those tags, Toni hadn't taken them off, no matter what, and Steve enjoyed that fact. He enjoyed the idea that his name was always on her. He liked the idea that she would always have something on her that would remind her of him… and Bucky.
"Yes," he said without giving any explanation. "And I'm sorry about the asshole earlier. I'll talk to him about it."
"I take it the family is back in town?" she asked, look over her Iron Man suit over. The suit was in one piece, though she would have to patch up some marks on it. It looked like it took a beating.
"Are you okay in there?" Barnes called from outside the door.
I am sorry that there was no Steve in this one, but he will return in the next chapter.
"Oh, Cap," she replied. "How many can you really compare me to?"
Yes, he had it bad…
Steve turned back and stared into her eyes. "She did that?" he asked through his teeth. He was going to have a few choices words with the assassin. Yes, he liked that Toni was getting hand to hand training, but he didn't want her injured, and judging from the bruise, it was a bad hit. "I'm going to talk to her."
"Nothing," he said, looking into her eyes. "Absolutely nothing."
Barnes waved it off. "That's who he is. He's a perfect gentleman, while I'm the bad guy." Again, he was smiling.
cranky," Steve replied, eyeing Clint. Though he didn't tired easily, he was exhausted and just wanted to sleep… To sleep…Okay, he was a little cranky. That last mission took a lot out of him—took a lot out of them.
Even if something happens to the couple—which it won't as they are
Steve gave in and held Toni tighter, refusing to let her ago. "No, I do. I see him everywhere too," he admitted. "I have nightmares too, Toni. I wake up in cold sweats with him and everyone else I couldn't save."
"How would you know what he did or didn't do?" Sam asked, giving her a look. "Maybe, he did."
With a sigh, he reached for the lump, harshly grabbing the woman's small arm. It was crueler than he intended but the idea of a foreign woman in his bed didn't sit well with him. He didn-
"I hope these items bring you comfort," he replied, calmly, as he turned and walked away.
"Well Bruce is here." Toni said softly. She didn't want to lie to Steve, but she didn't want to tell him the true number. She wasn't sure what he would say if he knew the real number, but… she couldn't lie, not to him. She had promised herself that she could never lie to him; she may not tell him everything, but she wouldn't
Then what else could this be? Her mind wandered to the Device she created. Could it be the reason why she was here? One idea came to mind, but that wasn't possible, especially when that wasn't what she had been trying to do. Shaking her head, she paused on the thought. That could be the reason why her never wrong watch, which was missing from her wrist, was wrong…so maybe, it was possible. How else could she explain the 1940's shit and the Shrimp? She thought she imagined the tiny Captain...
"I do, and no, you don't," Bucky denies, taking in another deep sniff of Tony's hair. "It calms me."
Was she really that readable? "I think it would be best," she said, knowing it would be useless to deny it now.
I hoped you liked it. I know I enjoyed writing it.
God, was there an answer for that? "I don't want to talk about this." She said pushing back in her chair.
A lot of things could be said about the Avengers, but neat? Nope. Yes, Toni had a messy lab—though in her defense, she knew where everything was-, but the lounge was a mess. Toni didn't have a monster- no, a child, she reminded herself, but she assumed this was what it was like to have a m-child, or the mess that come with one. Right now, it looked like an avenger's battlefield, well without the blood… okay, there was some blood. Damn Papercuts! She got them opening presents. She blamed these cuts on Clint who was smirking at her with that stupid look of his. He did it. She knew it.
So what you think going to happen next? Think another fight is coming between the two love birds?
"But it's the truth."
"Break what?"
Toni didn't understand why she was even having this conversion. Why did she even care about his friendship? She didn't need his friendship, which served as a distraction. "Thank you for saving me from that ass." She paused as she studied the expression on his face. "But I don't need your explanation or your apology. You don't
"It's complicated," Bruce answered, eyeing him from the corner of his eyes.
Toni's eyebrow rose as she stared at her father. The second she wondered how the hell he had her when he was goof ball was the second it went out the window. She knew he had woman lined up to be with him, which made her wonder if her mother one of them. She hoped not.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut, trying to get some sleep. He needed to sleep, damn it, or else he would go crazy. Everyone else already thought he was crazy though, which was why he was left behind while everyone else went out.
"But Sir," Zola questioned.
day. A horrible day. Sure, she had seen Barnes a few times, haunted her for a while, but that had been the worst. She had seen him right in front of her and fought with him; even without a fancy degree in psychology, she
Steve stared down at the genius, who was leaning heavily on him. He could practically feel her exhaustion, but he could also feel how happy she was now compare to before. It brought a bigger smile to his face, because she wasn't fight anymore. She was going to let this happen. She was going to let this grow. Yes, he knew they had lot to work on, her nightmares being one of them, but she wasn't going through this alone. He was going to be there. She was going to let him be here.
, and after the countless mind wipes, there should've been no reason why he remembered her, but he did. He didn't know her name, but that didn't matter, he fought. He fought everyone.
Steve had always been good at keeping his calm, even in the most stressful of situations, but right now, his worry was getting the better of him. With his mind playing the worst thoughts, he didn't have time to play these games, not with Toni missing. Why the hell did he let her leave his sight?
"Nothing?" Toni said, looking at Banner.
After the awkward bite with Peggy who glared at Toni the whole time, they boarded a plane. Toni had been on quite a few military planes before but she had never been on a plane this old.
Now, the Black Widow wasn't balling her eyes out (has that woman ever cried?), and neither was she freaking out like most would do in this situation. She was perfectly still with her eyes as the only part of her moving, but she was boiling just under the skin. Maybe, Toni just knew the woman well enough to see the break in Romanoff's shield, or maybe, the woman was just that shaken by Fury's condition and her emotions were getting the better of her. Whatever it was, Natasha was cracking. She was breaking seeing Fury on that colder table top. She was setting herself up to kill the person who would dare hurt this man. "Tell me about the shooter," she demanded, and just like that, her shield was back up. She had a mission.
Natasha also had a grin on her face as she shook her head. "We need to alert Fury to Toni's reappearance," she replied, putting on a serious face.
Toni took a deep breath. "Maybe, it isn't right, yet? Maybe, God has a plan for you." That statement felt weird on her tongue. She didn't really believe in God, but she knew Steve was a firm believer in God. He found peace in God's name, while she found annoyance. If there was a God, how could he allow so much pain in the world? If there was a God, he must be a heartless God with no care to what happened, and he must really hate her… Not that she blamed him. So many deaths were on her head.
Clint chuckled, lightly. "That's what I said."
Getting back to the tower as quickly as he can, Tony asks FRIDAY where the boys are and heads straight for them. He doesn't care about the looks from the rest of Avengers as he makes his way through the tower. He can see Rhodes yelling at him to stop, but he doesn't. He can't. He needs to see them for himself, even if they want nothing to do with him. He doesn't expect them to, not after how he had left.
Toni put her full attention on the lock as she needed to focus on it. "Calm down," she told herself, taking a deep breath. She shook her head fear that she might not pick it in time. However, a second later, she heard a click. Very quickly, she gathered her things and entered the room. Not even a moment later, a guard passed by the door. She could hear him stop outside the door, which freaked her out, but it wasn't long before she could breathe again. On the video feed, she watch him walk away.
Sorry for the long wait. I got distracted by Fanfiction. Other Authors updating stories and posting them. Geez, keeping me distracted...
"So what stops me from changing my mind about the deal after I help you?" she asked, not wanting to think about him touching her.
"No, I am not. Now, where and when were you born?" she asks him, studying the movements of his eyes.
Shaking her head, Toni Stark took a deep breath. She wasn't going to let Rogers, no wait, Captain America, get to her. Though she wondered, why was he getting to her in the first place? His insults weren't the first and she knew damn well, they wouldn't be the last, so why did they hit so hard? Why did she care what he thought? If she really thought about it, she knew the answer. Her mind wandered to her father, and how her father talked about him. She knew Captain America was important to her father because he had never shut up about the man. So if someone well-liked by her father hated her, what did that say about her relationship with her deceased father? She didn't have a relationship with her father, and it hurt to know Captain America meant more to her father than she. Why did her father hate her?
"I like you like this. I love the fear in your eyes," he said, as he finally gripped her tongue with the tool. However, before he pull, the door opened loudly behind him and judging by the footsteps, there were quite a few people who had just walked into the room.
"You have a bright mind. I hate to see it go to waste," he answered as he pulled her toward Zola who had popped out between two large glowing towers.
She was pathetic, wasn't she? She was mourning two relationships that she didn't want in the first place, that were destroyed because of her. What right did she had to mourn? She had no right at all and she knew it, but yet, here she was, mourning.
"By torturing me? Interesting." Toni replied as she gave him a look. "Very interesting."
Toni was barely listening to them as she played with the ID tags, which was now warm to the touch. Since taking the tags out of the box and putting them on, a second barely passed without her touching them. Even though she only had them for a few short hours, these tags already meant something to her. It felt like she keeping them close by wearing the tags. She knew she had gotten close to the both of them, but she didn't realize how close she was until Barnes' death and Steve's disappearance.
With a determined expression on her face, she pushed the Iron Man Suit into a drive after the man, who also drove off the roof after throwing the shield back at Steve. With the sheer force of the throw, Steve found himself thrown back slightly, which shocked the crap out of both of them. If she wasn't so annoyed, she would be impressed. This man was keeping up with a super soldier, which made it all that more important to figure out who he was. However, that was harder said than done. That man—if he was human with an arm like that—was as graceful as a ninja. Heck, he was climbing walls like one and was out of sight in the matter of seconds. She would've lost him in a dark alley if it wasn't for JARVIS.
Trying to regain her breath, she took a deep breath and pushed herself up and onto her shaky legs. It was a battle to stay on her feet as her soaked clothes were almost impossible to stand in. Her hoodie probably gained 25 pounds or more alone in the heavy, cold rain, but she wasn't sure that she was willing to take it off and expose her arms and chest to the freezing rain. She already felt like a popsicle. What would she feel like next without it?
"No, you don't." He was kicking himself. He should've listened to Toni more, considering Rumlow had just attacked him. That put a whole new spin on things. Was there a real reason why Rumlow had followed Toni around that night? Did whoever they were take her for a reason? The idea made his stomach flip as that meant that Toni was defenseless with these people. He paused for the second, forcing himself to take a deep breath. "And now, Toni could be in danger. Rollins has her, and I have no doubt that whoever it is, they have a plan. They killed Fury for a reason."
"You are in some serious trouble," Salty explained as he stared at her. There was a file in front of him and it contained everything about Toni, including the new charges against her.
"Geez, thanks," she replied as she glared at him. He was teasing and that wasn't allowed. That was her job. "So where's Rogers?" she asked, changing the subject.
(See the end of the chapter for
The end for now.
gloomy," he replied, coldly.
Wiping her mouth on her sleeve, she made her way toward the light, but the feeling in her stomach didn't go away. It stayed there, haunting her, almost to the point that she wanted to puke again. Shaking her head, she tried to force out the negative thoughts, because all those thoughts did was put her in a very dark place, a dark place she never wanted to go to again.
Jones laughed. "Then let's go. Then you can help me get some attractive dames."
"If I may interrupt you, Colonel Rhodes," JARVIS said, "Miss Potts does not have the authority to revoke access to the Mark 7 or any other mobile armor."
*O*O*
Toni snorted as he kept trying to get her to talk to him, so she didn't know how focus he was. "You focus? Yea, right."
Anyhow, here you go.
"I can prove it!" She did her best to fight him but she was failing. She could only slow him.
Bruce rubbed his temper as he thought about Pepper's plan. "Toni should have a say in this."
"Sark?" Barnes looked at her as if he didn't believe her. "That makes sense. If you were really a Stark, why would you be staying with two random guys at a rundown apartment?"
Anyhow, I am sorry it took me this long. I hope, it was worth the wait.
Jim didn't answer right away, and though Steve couldn't see him, he could almost see and hear his locked jaw and grinding teeth. "I trusted you with her," he finally snapped. "I trusted you to be there! I trusted you to take care of her! I thought you would be good for her. Thought you would be
Steve was never one for long explanations, but Barnes expected something more from him. "Did it hurt?" He wasn't sure what else to say.
*O*O*
*O*O*
Bucky turns to Steve slightly, giving him a look. "No, he doesn't get to do this, and you agree with me. I know you do."
The words 'their room' echoes in Tony's head, and he feels like he has been shot. It feels like someone has ripped his heart from his chest. It makes him wonder if any of this is real; it makes him wonder if he has been lying to himself the whole time. Did Barnes and Rogers ever care for him? Probably not. If so, they wouldn't have abandoned him so
"No, it isn't," Bruce replied with smile. "I'm going to give Steve the shovel talk, Toni."
"Let's finish these and check on Romanoff and the other," Bruce said, waving his sandwich at Steve.
"She was… what?" Banner asked, shock. "Why was she there?"
With a trouble expression on her hand, Toni didn't take the card, only stared. "I'm not a soldier," she said, shortly. She didn't serve…Wait, did she? Fucken time travel. Yes, she was given a rank in the Army when she traveled back in time. She was given assignments. She was sent into the field during WW2, but she did
*O*O*
"You think I'm falling for your trap?" she asked, playing angry. "Maybe, you're falling into my trap!" She stated as she spun her back on him. Her hair slightly slapped her face.
"Yup," Hawkeye chuckled. "I wouldn't wish that on anyone."
"I am p-" She started, but the words died. "What the hell is he doing here? I thought I said no Pirates!" she yelled, stepping away from Steve and toward the windows. Her eyes were on the helipad, glaring at the black helicopter that was landing. There was no mistaking the Shield symbol blazed on the side of it.
"We all know Toni won't last that long," Steve counters, giving her a wink.
Peggy let out a sigh. "I think we are digressing," She replied.
"Don't go alone!" She heard Peggy yelled, knowing why. Team Skully wanted her for something, but she couldn't bring herself to care.
Toni closed her eyes, taking in a few deep breath. That was what she was going to do, which meant that she needed to finish the damn suit… And she
Still on alert, Sam turns toward Tony, giving him the stink eye. "No, we're not. I hate that movie."
The end for now.
"We know this," Barnes said, sounding exhausted, as he crossed to her, offering to help her to sofa. There was a bit of hesitation when he offered his arm, but she let him help her without a protest. "We know this all too well. Right, Steve?" There was a hint of amusement when he spoke.
Something in her mind just snapped. "I know what this is! You don't think I can do it. You think you're the only genius there is." She tried to calm down. She tried to catch her breath, as she couldn't allow herself to explode. If she did, she might say something that she might regret later. "Get off your high horse."
Toni sighed as that meant he still didn't tell Rogers that he was leaving yet. She didn't want to be involved in that conversation or be around when that happened. "Any idea of when he'll be back?" she asked. Maybe, if she timed it right, she could be gone when that happened.
Taking eyes off them, Toni turned toward her father who had turned from her toward the podium. With a deep breath, she followed after him, knowing that he needed to know. He needed to know that she didn't hate him anymore. "Howard," she called.
Before anyone could stop him, the Asset was out the door and down the hall. He could hear the orders from Rumlow and Rollins demanding him to stop both in his ear piece and from the echoing hallway. He could hear Rumlow curse in his ear as the assassin forced open a window and jumped out. It was at least a thirty foot drop, and if he was any other man, the height would've killed him, but the Asset could jump from almost any height without getting hurt unlike the two members of the S.T.R.I.K.E. team. If he hit them hard enough, he could kill them, and it would be easy and fast. They did not stand a chance with him even if they teamed up against him.
"Yes," Rhodes said, sounding calmer at the sound of the heartbreak in Steve's voice. "Now, what are you going to do about it, Rogers?"
Toni watched him as he walked away. Sure, she knew she was being an asshole, but it wasn't all her. She couldn't stand this fighting between them. She missed hanging out with him. She missed being able to talk to him or even trying to hook him up with someone. She could be having so much fun trying to get Peggy and him together, even if he didn't like it. That would make it funnier.
The genius freezes when he steps into the common room, and the Brooklyn Boys aren't even there yet. He hates to see how he'll react once the two Super Soldiers are. Is he going to fall apart completely? Is he going to fall down at their feet like a dog? Is he going to beg, telling them that he made a mistake? Is he going to cry?...Oh, god, he might, and he hates himself. He hates how emotional he's being, and he wants to punch his own self in the face. He's so fucken annoyed at his behavior. He isn't a teenager girl, and he needs to stop acting like one.
She took a deep breathe. "Why does that matter?" she asked. Turning, she noticed a bag sitting on the table. She wondered for a second what was inside of it. Toni exhaled as she turned away.
She was pissed. How dare he talk to her like that? Who in the hell did he think he was? He didn't treat Agent Romanoff like this, so why was he treating her like his? She could take care of herself; she had been taking care of herself for years. She didn't need anyone and she really didn't need him. She didn't even know why she was even on this team. Director Fury didn't want her on the team to begin with. He thought she was egoist and riskless, which was true, but she was dying at the time. It still bugged her that he used that to judge her.
Howard laughed. "Got to get use to someone else having out my last name."
Ignoring the fact that she was leaving Steve on that roof top, she followed the guy. Toni, awestruck by him, watched the Shooter for a few seconds, scrutinizing his every move, before dropping down in front of him. Again, he reminded her as a Ninja as he disappeared into the shadows. He was invisible to anyone who would run upon him. It was eerie.
Toni struggled against her father, who seemed to have a death grip on her. "Hey! You can start with mini me, and not adult me. I can protect myself."
"There's something odd, and I wanted to check it out," she said, not wanting to explain that she wanted to chase after a crazy, super strong Commander, who could knock her out in one punch.
"And we like it," Steve says, pressing himself against Tony. "Oh, we like it."
He chuckled again. "I didn't know how I didn't notice it before. Sure, you don't have my chin, but there's no mistaking those eyes, that noise. You're mine," he said. "My Daughter."
*O*O*
I think the issue here is that I wanted out of Iron Man 3- I didn't want to do Iron Man 3 (This movie annoyed me and it wasn't due to villain but rather Pepper. Can't stand that character or rather what they did with her) but i didn't think that I could skip it and to go Winter Soldier (which PS is my favorite Marvel Movie). And then I ran into the problem that I didn't know how to get out of Iron Man 3. It was like I ran into a brick wall as nothing was coming to me, which just pinned me in this chapter for weeks- months. I was at an still stand. I didn't want to change much as I didn't want to spend chapters in a movie that I did not want to do (which I did anyways.) However, I struggled following the movies. Then I was forcing myself at points which made my work suffer.
*O*O*
The End for now... Soon we will be getting into the IRON MAN 3/Winter Soldier story lines. Those will be fun, don't you think!
"It's your name, isn't?"
"Don't tell me what to do!" she snapped. Toni watched him leave before she turned back to her lab. "JARVIS, I do not want any other interruptions." She returned to her chair. "Turn the music up loud. I don't want to hear myself think." The AI did as she wished this time and turned the High Way to Hell up so loud that Toni knew they would hear it upstairs, but she didn't care.
Toni snorted, picturing Happy doing just that. "I can arrange that, and Happy would love to do that, but good luck with all of that," she said, as she waved at him.
"Agreed," the entire room replies in a heartbeat. Tony laughs as he buries himself into Steve's side.
"Yea, different that I'm not afraid to kick your ass!" She so wished that she could punch or kick him in the face. It was so unfair that she couldn't beat the shit out of him.
*O*O*
Looking through his wet, messy hair, the Asset stared at her though advoiding her eyes. He didn't want her to see his emotions, his pain. She would reject him if she saw the blood on his soul. He was tool, nothing more. However, pain flashed through his mind again as flashes started to appear in his head like before.
Toni closed to him. "Then let me try."
Punch.
Toni let out a loud laugh as Steve tried to act something out. Having decided to stay in, Steve and she were playing charades. Since she had started to call him Steve (the second time), everything had come together with them. She never did talk to him about the night she had been attacked or about the many nightmares that she had been having, but they did talk about things: his love life being one of those things. She kept trying to play wing man and get him a girlfriend, because he needed love in his life…. He also needed to get laid. She wouldn't let him be a 90 year old virgin, which could loosen up the future Rogers; however, Steve wanted no part in it. "Really, I have no fucken idea what you are," she stated with another laugh.
She truly thought about it for a moment, because she was truly sick of his time, and Barnes' death was weighting on her. It made her wonder if there was anything else worse in life than that. What could she give him that was worse than that? She had no idea, but there was a part of her mind that was screaming at her, telling her that she would be an idiot to take his deal. And she was going to listen to that part of her.
Steve stared at the girl. How does she know my name? He wondered again.
Natasha chuckled as she shook her head. "I need some popcorn for this," she said, standing at the back.
"Did I do that?" Toni asked, knowing very well that she had written it. She remembered everything from that one night, even if she didn't want to.
"Boss," FRIDAY says, while Dum-E hums. "Dum-E has been on the internet again and has become fascinated in-"
"Oh, right. You wouldn't know!" Rhodes yelled, loudly and harshly.
Maybe, it was the big block letters that caught her attention. Or maybe it was the red letterings, warning people to keep out. Maybe, it was the name on the sign that caught her eyes as this was where it all begun in a sense. This was where the American Icon was chosen.
Hello,
The Captain's brain wasn't working, still frozen. How did this young man know who Toni was? Sure, everyone knew who Toni was, but it sounded like he had met Toni in person. However, how was that possible? Toni was missing.
He took a deep breath as he didn't even have a photo of her to remember her beautiful face or smart ass mouth. He had to settle for a damn drawing which didn't do her justice. He had no idea of where he could get a picture—or how to find out what had happened to her. He didn't know where to start; he couldn't look her up in the damn phone book. He did, however, ask Fury if he knew what happened to the officers who were involved in the SSR, and on request, Fury handed over the personal folders, which were laid out in front of him.
Her savior looked at her. "Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back," he said as he chased after him.
"You don't understand. I see him everywhere." There was a paused. "I…S-saw him the park."
Killian didn't respond right away as he brought his hand forward, aiming like a gun gun. "It doesn't matter if you do," he replied as he fired his arm… yes, his arm.
Though she had noticed that Loki had disappeared, that wasn't important. She had to speak to Phillips about her accompanying the 107. "Yes, myself. You know I'm crazy," she stated as she kicked the journal under the bed. "I got to go," She stated as she dashed out of the tent.
"I won't." It was a promise, and he wouldn't break it for the world, even if the world was ending- though the world did seem to like to do that…so maybe, he shouldn't think like that.
Toni tried her best to keep in her snort. Peggy had on her angry babysitting voice, and though she disliked it as a child, it was funny now. It was nice to hear her yell at someone else for a chance.
A second later, she hid the hacking device in the power board's many wires and closed the panel. Making sure that Barnes or Rogers knew what to look, she scratched in a small symbol into the paint. She reached into the bag and pulled out another item, a small Stark Industries radio. She grabbed a flathead and forced the radio open, exposing the wires. Not caring if it ever worked again, she pulled out random wires and stepped to a random panel on the mother board. She pried it open and again picked some random wires, hoping that it wouldn't hurt the real device. Just as she connected the wires, the door to the computer room opened revealing three Hydra Soldiers, but one stood out. It was a woman, who was surprisingly the leader. Toni wasn't expecting that, but she didn't have time to worry about that.
She couldn't admit the reason why. "You will see," she said through her teeth.
Salty shook his head as he blew out. "I get it. Thank you," he said.
Crap, Toni didn't want to think about that, but her mind wouldn't let it go. It was like looking at a car accident that you couldn't look away. "Yup, I am good." She utters, taking a seat at the breakfast bar.
They were so close to death that it freaked Toni out. "JARVIS, is there anyone else in the tower?" she asked, trying to get her mind on something else.
"It's the name you gave Barnes. It would make sense to keep it."
A color flier caught her eyes. It was an army recruitment poster, which had seen better days. The ends of the poster had started to peel and rip. The bright colors had started to lose its color, making her wonder how long it had been hanging there. She was surprised that it hadn't been replaced, considering there was an army recruitment station a block down. Toni could see the long line from here. "I wonder if R-Steve is there." She wasn't sure if he would be, considering their conversation a few nights ago. She really hoped he wasn't an idiot and gave up. If he did, she was going to beat his ass.
*O*O*
"Did he?" he asked again, as he stepped to her. He pulled her toward him, and after a bit of struggling, he had her in his arms. It was clear that he wasn't going to let her go. "Tell me." He was angry, but she wasn't sure if he was angry at her or the stalker.
"Not in the mood, Barnes," he says.
she countered as she tried to calm herself.
So fucken unfair.
Her eye twitched. They were talking about her in front of her as if she wasn't there, and worse, Barnes was talking to people about her. Why was he talking about her? Maybe, he needed a good slap. "I'm right here!" She stated as she stomped her feet. She puffed as she looked away. "And I'm awesome," she added.
Tony's brain is in overdrive, and nothing is making sense. He looks up to Steve as he leans into Bucky's chest, losing the urge to fight. He isn't sure what to make of everything. "I don't understand."
"Toni, you're safe. Wake up!" someone yelled, keeping a hold on her. "Toni!"
After she got him, she crunched down and rested her hands on her knees as she took a few deep breaths. "You walk away too fast," she stated after a minute.
"Toni, you'll have to tell us. Director Fury won't be easy as me and will want answers. Everyone, including Steve, will want to know."
He chuckled at her. "Such an ego on you, human."
"Stop it, Toni." Toni yelled at herself, as she jogged past a few drunk people. They might've said something to her, but the genius wasn't paying any attention. Her mind was a war zone, and it was struggle to focus on anything besides that nightmare crossing over into reality. This was where she wished that Steve was here, as he could always talk her down, even if all she did was throw insults at him. She was either nasty or a cry baby when she was like this, but he dealt with it all like the saint that he was. He was here for it all, protecting. Saving her… He really was a saint.
He chuckled again. "Not from you."
Phillips eyed the pill bottle that Toni had refused to touch. That told him a lot about the woman, who no one knew anything about. It showed that she didn't trust people, granted he understood her situation. He wouldn't trust anyone either if he was handcuffed to a table in a locked room, but there was something else there. He could see that in her eyes. He doubted she truly trusted anyone in her life, which stroked him as odd as even a spy needed trust. She must have seen or been through something in her life.
Savin narrowed his eyes at her, as a smirk appeared on his face. "Smart guys, always thinking they're ahead, when they are the ass."
With a wandering mind, he kept stealing looks at Natasha, trying to get a read on her. He couldn't tell if she was calm, forgiving, or boiling beneath the skin. She had been uneasily quiet since picking him up, and he wasn't sure what that meant. What was going on in her head? He was half expecting her to pull a knife and gut him like fish, not that he didn't deserve it. He did, and he kind of wished that she would, because he was sickened by that mark on Toni. Sickened. Even now, he couldn't understand why he acted like that. No craze fan could hurt him, even if they tried. He or she could've done nothing to him, unless they were enhanced. He knew this. He knew he overacted, and though he may have a reason, there was no excuse. There was no forgiving that mark.
"Nope, still not working." She gave him an even bigger smile. "Nope. Now stop that. You're giving me the creeps."
He turned his attention back to Dr. Erskine, who had a calculating side to him and he knew when to push and when not to push.
"It's classified information, Toni," he replied, dryly. "Now where is Rogers?" he asked again. "Why isn't he here?"
Steve started to struggle again as Schmidt grabbed Toni's face. "What are you talking about?" he asked, his smile dying as his eyes were glued to the hand on Toni's face.
Why did he tell Barnes the true all of those months ago? He should've kept his mouth shut and allowed Barnes to think that he hates him. "I guess Rogers didn't mean what he said earlier," he mutters to himself. "Have they been sleeping in their room together for the past week?" he asks, not wanting to know the answer though he already knows. He already knows that they rather be anywhere else than with him, and that hurts. It hurts more than he ever expects.
Howard looked at Phillips and wondered what he was up to, but it wasn't his place as he was just the weapon expert. Peggy wanted to say something, but she knew it was best not to fight the colonel.
"I thought you would have agreed with this, Doctor," Phillips stated.
Because of that, he did his tasks assigned to him without question. He didn't care who he killed or hurt. He didn't care if he was hurt. It was all about the mission, all about completing his goal. It was about pleasing his handlers. His pleasure or happiness weren't a factor or important, and it was killed the second he showed any interest besides killing. They were taken before they could grow, leaving him feeling empty. Empty all the time.
Schmidt glance down at his prisoner, and squeezed her arm tightly, making her scream. "I did not tell you that you can speak."
"She got away when Schmidt was fighting with you," he tried to explain.
Shaking his head, Tony takes a deep breath and turns back to the device he's working on. He's working on a mother board, though he has been working on this damn thing for over an hour, and he can't see to focus. He only seems to be poking at the unfinished device. Literally, just poking. "Stupid," he utters again, feeling annoyed at his inability to do anything. He groans as he's unable to focus, and his anger takes over. Unable to do anything else, he just stabs the device.
*O*O*
; and his kids, his
A smile appeared on Stark's face at the sound of her last name on his lips; however, she didn't comment on it. Instead, she just continued on. "I don't know why no else sees it. You make it seem like I'm the bad guy, but it's you. You're the reason for everything. I don't know why everyone wants
Calming down, Clint moved to the side. "Good, because you two are too sweet to be like that," he said, letting out a puking sound. "Like too sweet. I might get tooth ache."
Schmidt glanced toward Barnes. "He fancies her as well. He might steal her from you, Captain. How do you feel about that?" he asked as he turned to the door.
"Water?"
It was odd to say the least to see Rhodes fly off in the Iron Man Suit. It was even weirder for him to remain behind, but they were all correct: he needed to rest. He was burning out at both ends and that wasn't good for anyone. If Toni could see him now, she would probably laugh. Toni would probably love to see him like this, because she saw him as Mr. Perfect, a guy who could do nothing wrong. He knew he was part of the reason why she though that, considering how hard he had been on her. He didn't mean to; he just didn't know how to handle her risky behavior.
"Hey, it is-" Rogers started.
Tony's eyes shift between the two. "I can't deal with this," he says, waving at them. He just can't.
For the eleventh time, the Soldier's eyes scanned the room, while keeping an ear to the hallway even if Rollins was watching the hallways, not that they expected anyone at this hour. The Senator, the two S.T.R.I.K.E., and the Asset were the only people in the building, well besides the guards on ground floor. However, there was no chance that the guards could save the Senator. Not one guard had seen the trio enter the building, and when the time came, no one would see them leave either. The three of them, especially the Asset, could enter any building without anyone noticing.
Toni raised her eyebrow. "Why do you care about my chest piece?" she asked as she crossed her arms against her chest. "You don't need to worry about it." The screwdriver dangled from her hand dangerously.
*O*O*
"Yes, I am." He replied. He had a big smile on his face.
"I'm surprised you didn't do that already," he replied with a smile. He wished she had, so it wouldn't have taken so long for them to find her. It had taken a few hours to track her down, as this had been the last place that he had looked for her, not expecting her to come here.
"Since I found a helpless kitten in front of my door."
That was one thing of the few things that she really missed from this time. JARVIS was everywhere, always giving her a helping hand when he was betraying her to Bruce, and Toni had no idea of how she lasted in the past without the AI. He listened and followed her every command, and she didn't feel like shit after talking to him.
Toni was wearing a thin black shirt under the hoodie, and it too was soaked. Steve hesitated for a second before he reached for the bottom of the shirt. He gave Toni a look before he pulled the shirt up. It stuck to her skin as he pulled it off, almost like it was glued, and it took more effort than he expected. He flung the wet shirt aside, not paying any attention to where it landed. His focus were on Toni, and only Toni. She was still shivering, still cold despite the temperature in the room. He could see every bumps and mark on her skin, which did nothing for his nerves.
"Interesting."
The Commander looked away from Toni to the monitors and glared, not liking something. Her look could frighten young children, though it also scared her. She looked like she could skin someone alive. With a sickening scowl, she looked back to Toni, which told her that someone was coming and it wasn't Hydra. That lit Toni up and kept her fighting, but it didn't last for long. Before anyone could arrive, the fuming, irritated Commander picked her up and threw over her shoulder to carry her out. Fear rose up inside of her, knowing she was going to be tortured again, but at least, she was able to download everything into that device or so she hoped.
Barton and Romanoff were SHIELD agents with strong loyalties to Fury and SHIELD, not her or anyone else. They could- would turn on her in a heartbeat because they were
Tony can hear voices as he makes his way to the kitchen. With a deep breath, he continues, knowing the team would tease him on sight. Barnes hadn't been the only one who had tried to get the genius out of the lab; the whole entire team (besides the Red Witch, Vision, and BirdMan Wilson) had tried to get Tony out of the lab, but each had failed. When Rogers came down, Tony had barely spoken a word, just eyeing him the whole entire time, but this is more of a reaction than most had gotten from him.
"I feel like it's my fault."
Schmidt suddenly looked around as he noticed Toni was gone, but they did not stay to look for her, like he wanted. Zola was able to convince him to leave without her, as the flames started to jump higher, almost licking them.
"You find that funny, Sark?" Rogers asked.
Toni didn't have much to say about D.C. that hadn't already been said: it was a city full of idiots. Granted, that could be said about anything city- idiots were everywhere, but D.C. had a special kind of stupid. However, the main reason why she avoided this city was because she was in denial. Steve
she thought, knowing she couldn't stop his death.
She's ungodly quiet as she leans forward in her chair. She's staring at him, a very calculated look in her eyes. "If you say so," she says, slowly after a few long seconds. "Saves me some work, because Barnes is pacing outside your doorway, and it isn't 'I'm bored' pacing. It's 'I'm on a mission pacing,' and he's ready to take on the world to get in here. And let me tell you, it's alarming. He has that murderous look in his eyes, daring someone to get in his way so he can knife them. He's scaring Rogers."
"We don't need to be friends," Peggy replied. "It's not my job to friendly." This was where Toni toned them out.
"I can show you again!" Toni yelled as she stepped out of his grip and waved her fist at him.
Steve wasn't sure what Rumlow was hinting at, but he wasn't in the mood to guess. He just wanted to return to DC as soon as possible to hand in their report to Fury, and then, book it to California. After that, there would be nothing keeping him from Toni's side. There was a rotting, nasty feeling in his gut, and it got worst with each second. Natasha had said it before at the tower, and he had no doubt that it was still true. Toni probably hadn't slept a wink since he left, not that he had gotten much sleep as well. He just laid awake as he wanted-
"Yea, Wanda's idea," he says with a smile. There's a devilish look on Rhodes' face and it doesn't sit well with Tony. "She says she'll use her abilities on you if you don't get your pretty ass upstairs—No, she didn't use
"Steve."
Clint narrowed his eyes at Toni before stealing one of the glasses from the table. He ignored the glare from Steve. "I can't wait until you cry, Stark. Don't worry I will take video and post it on YouTube."
Shaking her head, she forced her glance forward. "Not now, Barnes." She had too many things on her mind to think about Rogers. Right now, she was about to be captured, because if she remembered correctly, that would be the outcome of this mission. Most of the 107 would be killed or taken hostage, and Toni wasn't going to do anything but let it happen. She just didn't have an idea of what she was going to do. Would she allowed herself to be captured? Would she allow the others to be captured while she escaped? She didn't think that she could allow that, even if Rogers would save them. She was heartless and cruel, but she couldn't be that heartless and cruel. She felt sick thinking about it.
Fury turned back, giving him a look. "I thought you would be more agreeable as Stark finally said yes."
Then there was Phillips. She wasn't sure what he thought about her, but it was exhausting trying to read him; however, she knew one thing: he was strict. She couldn't do anything without asking, and if she tried anything, he knew. She wondered if he was psychic or something. He had found out about her walks in the woods, which he wasn't very happy about it to say the least. She thought she would've gone deaf after that lecture, which Future Rogers could've been proud of, and on top of that, Salty wouldn't let her go anywhere alone. After a few days, he let up and allowed her some freedoms back, but he kept her on a short leash.
Steve's smile turned into a smirk as he reached over to Toni, cupping her soft face in his rough hand. "Oh, you think of me of an old man, really?" he asked, holding her in place as he covered her lips with his. It was a simple kiss, but Toni just melted into him. His hand dropped to her neck, gently pulling her closer.
Phillips could tell Rogers didn't like the idea of leaving a man behind, but they had no way to save them. "Yeah! It's called winning the war."
Toni sighed as she nodded. "JARVIS."
Howard looked at her, and it wasn't until a few seconds later that he spoke. "I'm sorry."
Phillips let out a chuckle. "Put on the dress uniform until we get to base."
Even in her tired status, Toni felt herself twitch. Why were they under the impression that she belonged to Rogers? That they belong together? There was nothing between Rogers and her besides pain, pain that she had caused. It was all that she did. She was the reason for so much pain in the world. "I don't know about that. Rogers loves his sharing."
That was the problem: she didn't want to talk. She couldn't. Starks weren't talker. "Rhodey," she replied, a warning in her tone.
Bucky, on the other hand, remains close, taking a seat on the right side of the empty sofa, which is odd for the former assassin. The Sergeant usually sits on the left side as it leaves his right side open to be cuddled with, as no one wants to cuddle with a metal arm, not that Tony will complain at the moment. There's nothing that Tony wants more than to be in both of his Super Soldiers' arms... No! They aren't his.
Toni knew he a point—at least, he was trying to get them to see-, but it was harder said than done. However, she was willing to give it a try, because she was done feel like crap. With support, she was willing to allow herself be happy, and she would like to think she had taken a step in the right direction.
She thought to herself. "We've better hurry," Toni stated, pulling the pack to her back. Her journal was buried at the bottom of her bag, hiding it from the world, as she didn't wanted anyone to read or even know about it. It was the only thing she shared her secrets with, but she wondered if that was smart as there was a chance that someone would find it.
"Do I know you?" Toni asked, eyeing him. She had to have met him before as he knew her, but she had no idea of where. "What's with the name Fire Rocket?" She had no idea why he called her that. It was annoying as all hell.
"Yes, soundly, I might add." Bucky hadn't heard anything from her, which didn't mean she wasn't having nightmare. He really couldn't tell unless she made a noise or something. He had checked on her randomly to see how she was doing, and everything seemed okay.
Clint turned quickly and glared at her. "I have already, and I think Director Fury is an idiot. And don't try to make me see reason, because of right now, one of our teammate is in danger because of him. If anyone happens to Toni because of Fury, I will never return to SHIELD," he snapped, turning away. "And then he can really count me of an enemy, as I will be coming for him." He tightened his grip on the metal suitcase.
wanted to do it again, but it was something.
Steve closed his eyes as he pushed himself away from the mirror and stepped to the door with his fists balled at his side. Hindsight was really 20/20, because he was an idiot to let that woman through. He was too distracted by saving Toni to think about anything else. She was obviously an important figure within the Hydra organization, which he could tell by her uniform… He was just too clouded at the time to think clearly.
The Colonel turned around. "You're exhausting, you know that?"
The next morning, Toni had no inkling of why she thought it would be a good idea to make breakfast for the guys when she had a broken arm, an arm that she was glaring at in the hopes that it would get better by magic. She burnt the bacon, which she could deal with as crispy bacon was the best; however, the eggs were a different story. Toni had completely burn them, which irritated her. She picked up the pan from the stove, which took her awhile to figure how to turn on (she didn't think it was a stove to begin with) and threw the pan in the trash. She had burnt the pan beyond repair in her eyes. "I'll buy them a new one," she muttered to herself. Every cent was important, but she didn't like to be in anyone's debt. She didn't want to owe anyone anything.
Taking a deep breath, Bruce spoke, "We do. There's nothing else I can do without Barton and Romanoff. They're being back supplies from SHIELD."
The world had changed so much in the last seventy years and he doubted they would need an old man like himself. They didn't need an old worn out symbol; they just wanted power and frame. There was another reason why he listened to Dugan when he told him to stay away from Toni. He was afraid that she wouldn't want him now, even if she did remember him. He was old fashion and outdated and she was not.
There was still a sadness in his voice that Toni didn't like. "It is," she replied, forcing herself not to reach for the dog tags. They seemed to become so important to her in so little time.
A man in a nicely tailored suit that fit him perfectly stood behind her with a suitcase in his left hand. It was clear that he had spent a pretty penny on that suit, which shouldn't be too surprising considering the cemetery that they were in. Just to buy one of these plots in this cemetery probably costed more than a year's rent in New York City and the upkeep was sometimes more than that. "My colleagues didn't think you would be here."
"You."
"I will not tell you yet. Swear to me that you will give it to me and I will get you
In all her years, Toni never wanted to take over the world…Okay, she had thought about it a few times, thinking how easy it would be, and heck, it really was if she put any effort into it. Genius and all…but you can't blame her! Who didn't dream about taking over the world? At some point in their lives, world domination was on everyone child's mind, and Toni's mind was no exception, especially with a father like Howard. With Howard, nothing was off limit, and every possibility should be studied and examined. Though Howard had his issues, there was one thing he didn't take from her: her dreams. Even in his drunken stage, there was nothing she couldn't do, even if she did annoy the hell out of him toward the end of line.
"I don't think you're weak. I don't think anyone can call Iron Man weak."
Toni's spinning head was throbbing as that memory started to replay, but it was like watching a skipping DVD that she couldn't control. She couldn't stop or slow it, and it made her skin itch. It felt like every part of her was on fire, and all she felt was sweat pouring down her skin. She could feel herself shaking as a tremor rocketed through her body; however, before she could collapse, she felt a pair of strong arms wrap around her and pull her into a warm embrace.
The man's smile fell, and anger took over. "You bitch," he yelled, as he got back to his feet. His fists were shaking at his side. "I was trying to be nice. Someone should teach you matters."
"What makes you think that?" Peggy asked.
He refused to be useless. Warmness be dead.
"I said weeks ago," Wilson adds with a chuckle.
"Just hear me out, Toni," he said with a smile as he fondled three small metal balls.
Natasha walked behind him in silence, because there was no talking him down. He had to cool down on his own, and besides, she knew how he felt. Though Stark was a pain in ass, she cared about the genius and she would do anything to save her.
Toni had a few options she could do, but she wasn't sure any of them would work. "No, I'm just a nurse," she stated, as she tried to look shaken up.
"I am aware that you do not, Miss," JARVIS replied, dryly.
Pepper stepped toward him. It wouldn't be wise to yell at him, but she couldn't help it. She was just so angry. "And you let her go?"
Steve's eyes widened as he looked up- out of habit. "JARVIS?" he uttered, shocked. He could hear Rhodes, yelling in his ear, but he didn't pay much attention to the Colonel, as he was too focused on the AI.
Her feet, even with her socks acting like a barrier, were killing her as there was nothing to protect her feet from the hard ground. To make matters worse, it was freezing outside, and with no coat or shoes, the cold was affecting her faster than normal. She was losing her body heat quickly. She was shivering, but she had no interest in going inside.
"I'm sorry, Miss. I wasn't watching where I was going? Are you okay?"
Steve let out a huff as he looked down at her. "Of course, they would," he said, a hint of jealous in his voice. "But in the end, you are my
Almost immediately, the AI responded, "Ms. Stark. It is a pleasure to see you again."
"Are you okay, Sark?" Peggy asked, interjected. "Maybe, you should be laying down."
"T-that's creepy when you say it like t-that," she replied as she was fighting to stay awake. Her eyelids felt like they weighted a tone.
Toni watched them leave, not knowing if she would see Barnes again before he died. She felt a rush of guilty and she felt sick to her stomach.
Finally taking his eyes off the genius, Sam turned his attention to the super Soldier. Though sitting for a while, sweat still ran down his face, he said, "I need a new set of lungs. Dude, you just ran like thirteen miles in thirty minutes."
And yet, she hadn't given him answer.
Both the Stalker and the Commander laughed as she pulled Toni's collar harder, almost choking her. "It doesn't matter if they know, because they'll meet their death, and you'll be there to watch it."
"Depends. Buy us food. We're hungry," Natasha says.
"So that's why you sleep with all of those women?" she asked, with a small smile.
Not allowing a good look at the articles, Steve crossed to her, pulling her away from the monitors. "We both can wear the pants," he said into her hair line. "Now, let's get going."
"Oh, you aren't going to eat it all. You're going to burst if you try. I'm only saving you."
"Well, I-" Toni started.
"And there's that face."
Peggy turned back to her. "We have deemed the two items safe. We cannot do that with the other device."
"But still, they sent you to find me?" She snorted, ignoring his insult.
Shaking her head, she slowly made her back to her tent, but the shadows were jumping.
"You're unbelievable, Howard," Peggy replied with a chucking sigh.
Her body felt strange to her, feeling like she wasn't even in her body, but Toni willed herself forward. "Nothing. I'm not hiding anything," she replied.
"Toni," he called again, and this time, he grabbed a hold of her shoulders and shook. "You aren't there. You're here with me in the lab. You're safe," He said it slowly.
"Oh, shut up," she replied, as she used him for support. She was exhausted, and though she was standing a few minutes ago, she was unsure if she could now. "I'm not cranky or negative when I am sleepy. I am always cranky!"
Howard glanced down at the box. "Was that why you freaked out on him?" he asked.
Also, Infinity War is going to kill me.
Toni waved it off. "Don't worry about it. I'm not insulted this time and I was joking with you. Geez, you need to lighten up." He couldn't take a joke in her time as well, which was funny and interesting. "Anyways, the homeless shelter. Do you know anyone who would know of one?" she asked.
She narrowed her eyes at him before jumping to her feet. "Why the hell are you here?" she asked as she stepped toward him. He was the last person she wanted to see. "Why aren't you in a cell?" Her body hurt.
When Maria had dead, Toni could see the sudden change, and it hit her hard. Before her mother died, Howard, though distance, had let her in the lab at least, but after, he wouldn't let her in at all. He became a total asshole, or rather a bigger asshole than before. It almost broke her before she realized that she didn't need him or his love. She could and would make it on her own, because she was strong and she wasn't the weak girl her father thought she was. She was going to show everyone that she was someone. She wouldn't let anyone think she was worthless. She was Toni Stark.
Spector put his suit case down as he wiggled off his suit jacket off. "This…was on your father's body the day that he died," he replied.
He tried to ignore the tingle in his chest as his fingers danced along her skin. He could never get over how this woman made him feel. She made him feel alive in so many ways that he didn't know was possible. Just the mere thought of touching her got to him. "Shit," Steve cursed, lightly as he threw the wet hoodie to the ground. "Heavier than I thought." Still no respond from Toni. She hadn't said anything since the lounge, and this level of silence scared him.
However, he did not know why he was here. Why was he just standing around? There were other things that he could be doing; he had skills he could be using. Even if he was a nobody without a name, his purpose was to kill. Killing was what made him feel alive, no longer numb, if at least for a few moments. Killing gave him something to live for and he enjoyed it. It was one the few things that gave his life meaning. It was what made him useful, and he needed to be useful. He needed to be needed, even if he was just a tool; he was okay with being a tool as long as he was needed.
Toni took a deep breath, because she knew she could do this. She had to do this, because if she didn't, she would be screwed. Colonel Phillips would be back and he wouldn't be gentle. He wanted answers and he would do anything to get them. She didn't like that idea.
Barnes took a step toward her. "Nowhere is safe if you can't defend yourself, and I want to help you with that."
Tony's eye twitched. "Old? I am not old! Take that back! Besides, you two are the grandpas in this relationship, not me." Steve just laughs as the super soldiers get to their feet with the genius in their hands. They are close, each holding a section of Tony. "I will show you how young I am. You won't know what hit you."
to see his face, even if she knew it wasn't him. She just needed to see it for her sanity.
"Can't be mad at you," Rhodes muttered as he pulled her back into his arms.
"To hell? Of course, you do. You just want to hide me, hide your bloody hands. Get rid of your dirty secret." The ground just shook beneath him as he took a step forward. "Just admit it. You wanted me to die. Wanted me dead."
"I do not know of Miss Stark's location. She is not in the tower," JARVIS answered. "I also do not have any record of her leaving the tower as well."
"No, Tom. She's mine."
"You never answered my question. Where would you go? I know you don't have anywhere to go."
When Toni came too again, she didn't expect to be in a cheap hotel room, laying in a bed that probably saw more action then she had…Now, that thought gave her the willies, and she didn't want to think about the possible bugs that could be living in this room. She had heard the horror stories about cheap hotels, though if she were to be honest it wasn't just the cheap places. However, she was in denial about that. Deep Denial.
"I got her," Howard said, speaking to someone.
Taking a deep breath, she turned away and headed toward that door. "And fix that clock. It's annoying."
"I lost count," he said, softly. "But I come here and think." He paused for a second, just watching the video. "Just pondering what he would say to me if he saw me. Would he blame me? No, I know he wouldn't. He would think me an idiot. So, I like to think that he would be happy to see me like this…However, he would probably be mad at me for leaving you all the time, so I will have to fix that."
"Just forget it," Peggy snapped and sat up.
*O*O*
Until Next time.
"No!" Steve yelled. "Just stay away from her." He didn't know why, but he didn't like Barnes saying that.
She waited a few minutes before crossing the street in the shadows. She ducked in a bush as she saw a guard come her away. She peaked her head out of the bushes once she couldn't hear the footstep. As she had seen one too many action movies, she rolled behind a tree in a ninja fashion and posed before the tree. She moved the leaves out of the way and looked out. When she thought the coast was clear, she crossed to the fence at the back of the facility that was rarely patrolled. Reaching into her bag, she grabbed a wire cutter.
Bruce laughed. "He means you."
"I think you'll tell her, which will probably be as soon as you see her again, and then you probably won't let her out of your sight again, which will just annoyed the hell out of her and she'll probably slap you for it." They both chuckled at that as they knew she would.
With a small laugh, Barnes shook his head instead of responding back to that. "Well are we going to stay and talk in this alley all day along or are we going?" he asked.
"It wouldn't be the gentlemen thing to do," he said, as he reached for her.
"Unfortunately."
Though Toni was worried about Rogers as it seemed that Hydra knew about the future attack, it was a relief to be referred to as Sark. It meant that Schmidt did not know who she was, though it all could be a trick. "You know if he haven't been kicking your ass, I might believe you."
Project Insight seemed more like a weapon of fear than anything else. He tried to give Fury the benefit of the doubt, but he made it difficult. It was times like this that he wished he had listened to Toni when she ranted about the man. Steve had played it off because Toni rambled like no tomorrow about everything—like how stupid Heels were, but Fury was making it hard to trust him, especially seeing how he was willing to go.
Between Sharon and Clint, Steve knew they would find her, but he didn't like this. He should be the one looking for her.
He was someone that Toni had no interest of leaving in the dust. The very idea hurt; it felt like a knife to the gut. Regardless, she doesn't know what to tell him. Yes? No? Hell yes? Keep dreaming buddy? She wasn't sure. She didn't even know what she wanted. Again, marriage was something that she ever dreamed about, especially after seeing how broken her father was after her mother's death. To her, marriage was a painful thing that she avoided at all cost. She saw nothing good coming from it.
Even though it didn't seem like it, she wanted to sleep, but the idea of it scared her, especially if she couldn't wake up. She hated it when Salty had sedated her, and it almost gave her a heart attack. She didn't know what she would do if someone tried to sedate her again. Her hands went straight to the dog tags hanging around her neck, and she squeezed. These tags had become a lifeline to her, and even if she didn't want anyone to know about them, she didn't know what she would do without them.
Until next time.
, Toni thought angrily.
to obtain that. Toni didn't know what was going through Aldrich's head, but only one idea came to mind when she thought of a super soldier army, and that was world domination.
Toni glanced back toward Barnes, who was a few feet behind. He was giving her his stupid smile as if she needed it, which she didn't. "So I can clock you again?" she asked, still wearing her glare.
Taking off her watch, she adjusted it to the time and stared at it before returning it to her wrist. Standing up, she straightened out her AC/CD shirt and headed out of the lab, because she didn't want Pepper coming after her, even if she had to see him. "Stop being a chicken," she told herself.
Toni never really had a girls' night as her father had never seen the need for a child genius to have a girls' night. "Is this where we giggle and talk about our nails?" she asked as she pushed out of Peggy's arm.
Phillips chuckled. "Don't think you get think you are getting out of this one, Stark."
Toni's stomach growled, but she ignored it. "Don't need reason, don't need rhyme. Ain't nothing I'd rather do." She crossed to her work desk, wondering if she could get food delivered to her. Maybe, she could get Happy to pick her up a burger from Burger King. "Going down, party time. My friends are gonna be there too, yeah." But she doubted the gang upstairs would let him through that easy.
And again, her Iron Man suit was nothing more than a paperweight—an oversize, overweight, and overpriced paperweight. Right now, she could do nothing besides drag her heavy, bulky pride and joy behind her, which slowed her progress greatly. If she didn't have her suit, she could double her speed and wouldn't be so exhausted, but she couldn't and wouldn't leave her suit. Her suit was everything to her. It was her baby, and she could never abandon it. It would be like leaving a part of her behind, which she could never do. She didn't know who she would be without the suit—which was probably why Steve was so annoyed.
"Was this how she had been tortured?" he asked. "But that doesn't make sense. She was tortured before I met her, but this was only a few years ago." Unable to finish reading all of the horrible things those Ten Ring bastards did to her, he balled up the pager and threw it as hard as he could. This had been the torture that she had talked about, but how could that be? It didn't make any sense.
Pepper was shocked by his question. "She has to be alive." She looked around; there were no signs of blood. "There would be signs if she's dead."
Something was up. "Why?" she asked, slowly.
She couldn't believe her eyes as she looked him over. He looked exactly like the last time she had seen him: tired and worn down. Toni couldn't help but stare at him, feeling like someone was ripping her apart from the inside. Though his hair was stark white, he didn't look a day older, even though 20 years has passed. Doubts popped up. God, why did she push him away? Why didn't she let him reconnect with her? She knew he was tired, but she was putting up walls. He tried weeks leading up to his death and she pushed him every time. "How?" she asked, her voice shaky. "You're dead."
And he would do anything to keep these feelings, which meant tracking Toni down to wherever the genius went. It also meant that he would kill anyone who dared to keep him from Toni, and this included his handlers. Though his kills were myths- stories told to create panic, he had no doubt that his handlers would find him, but they would have a fight on their hands. A deadly fight. He was the Winter Soldier, the ultimate assassin, and there wasn't a target or assignment that he couldn't kill. He was the assassin of the ages, an unstoppable force.
Schmidt forced her to her feet again. "Why would I do that? With Zola and you, there's no stopping me."
Until next time.
"Easy," Rumlow stated, eyeing the Winter Soldier.
However, he can't help but smile whenever she does, because though he'll never admit, he likes to be taken care of. He likes to be pandered at times, and at this moment, he wants nothing more than to be cuddled and pandered. He wants to be held like he's the most important person in the world, and even if he tells himself he can't, he wants it to be Steve and Bucky. He fucken wants them, though they probably won't be in the mood to cuddle with him. They were distant in their final days together. They were sleeping together in their own room, while he slept
"Toni."
"You can't keep it in."
He wondered briefly if he would see Toni, but he brushed those thoughts away. She wasn't a part of this; she didn't need to be a part of this. She was already hurt by this Tesseract and she didn't need to be hurt again.
*O*O*
Toni took a long look at him, trying to read him, but she couldn't get anything from him.
Toni took a deep breath. "Why do you think someone's bothering me?" She didn't think she was that freaken readable, which also irritated her. That was the last thing she wanted. She fought the urge to look around, as she was felt eyes on her again. Maybe, she was just imagining it.
Toni glanced up from her tablet to see Rumlow a few feet from her with an eager smile on his face. A smile that did not match the rest of him. He was dressed in full combat gear with his team—also in full combat gear- following behind him. Toni didn't know what was with that smile, staring at her like she was a piece of meal, but he was up to something. She didn't trust that man as far as she could throw him without the Iron Man suit. "Oh, you miss me?" she asked, giving him a look. "Can't blame you on that." Was this harder than normal? It felt like she was running a race that she couldn't win. God, she thought she was doing fine, but that Assassin's words kept replying in her head.
*O*O*
"Yes, Miss. I have to agree," the AI replied as an image appeared on screen.
"I can't let you do that." He grabbed her shoulder to stop her. "Rogers told me that Hydra wants you, and we can't risk them getting you."
"Everything suits me," she stated with a wink. "You want to test?" She teased.
When he didn't respond, Natasha added, "Steve. We'll find her. They don't realize who they had pissed off. We're the avengers. We have a hulk." Her voice was soft but firm.
"That would explain Skully."
"No, I don't," he said, quickly. "Never hate."
. He pro- "Stop it," she yelled at herself. She knew nothing will become of it if she continued that thought process.
"Hey now, I'm starting to think you don't like me," Barton frowned, playing hurt, as he made his way to the arrow hacking the computer. "Just giving you some advice with Toni. I am so team Iron Cap."
"If you say so."
"Trust me, I want you to leave. Can't deal with two Starks in one time," he replied with a smile.
He stared at her. "So what can I call you? Jane Doe does not seem fitting for this conversion." He took the chair form the corner of the room and set down next to the bed.
Steve's smile didn't falter as Toni froze in front of him, a shaky stop. "I don't know if this isn't too soon. Okay, maybe too soon, but it feels right," he started. "I don't really know what I'm doing. I really don't. If you think about it, you're the only girl I ever really dated. The only dame I ever had sex with, so…" He drifted off, red in his face. He shook his head slightly as if to push away from that topic. "But I know all is that I want you. I just want to be with you." He paused for a second. "Doesn't matter where. Doesn't matter when, I just want you. Your very smile-"
*O*O*
Natasha eyed the super soldier as he slowly crossed back to one of the sofas in the room. Without removing his shield from his back, the man gradually sat down. He bowed his head, folding his hands in the other. He played with them, picked at them. "Steve," the Assassin called, still eyeing him.
"I do!" she stated as she turned to walk away. She could feel him right behind her with his eyes on her. It annoyed her that he could get in her good graces so easily, but it pissed her off that he was right and that would bug her to no end. She also didn't like the fact that he could read her so well, and she hated that she needed him. No matter how many times she told herself that she didn't need him or his protection, it didn't change the fact that she did.
"Oh, how you pained me!" Killian said, playing hurt.
That was one reason why he almost killed Steve, when he noticed that bruise on the genius's arm. Heck, he still wanted to put an arrow through the super soldier, even if it was an
"The Device that Miss Stark had been working on was suddenly activated and everything within a 10 foot range has disappeared," it stated.
her. The AI was the best thing the genius had ever created, and this creation didn't make mistakes. He fixed things, saves her from herself, which was why she relied on him so much. So the AI
Steve didn't need the AI to answer that to know that she wasn't. Both JARVIS and Rhodes' actions were telling enough. JARVIS wouldn't do this unless something horrible had happened to Toni, and he knew something did as he had a yelling Rhodes in his ear. "Okay, JARVIS," he said, "Take me to Toni."
Toni wiggled in her seat, trying to get a better look of him. She couldn't see his gun, which would've been helpful right about now, but she spotted a knife on his belt. She eyed it for the few seconds before willing herself to grab it. Her hands were trembling as she reached forward, and it felt like someone had turned up the heat as she felt his hot breath against her face. Her heart was pounding as she wrapped her fingers around the handle. With a soft exhale, she puck it from him. She froze for a second, waiting to see if the man would wake. When he didn't, Toni leaned back in her seat and went to work on the seatbelt.
Even when Steve and Toni were fighting, she had never looked at him like that, and Steve knew why. It didn't take a genius to know that she didn't like Fury. She didn't trust Fury, and Steve had to admit that he didn't trust or like Fury as well. "Director," Steve said, making his way over to Toni.
Toni knew how that was, as she was the same way. She didn't care easily. "And your point?" she asked as she started to step down the hall.
He left out a chuckle. "Nothing. I found nothing. It was as if you didn't exist."
"Growing up, Peggy and her were close," Dugan said with a smile. "They were cute together."
"No, but I know that look," he said, knowingly. "And I feel the same." Toni didn't have a chance to respond as Steve captured her lips again with a deep kiss. Dropping to her waist, his hands settle just above her hips, disappearing under her sweater. He had a tight hold on her as he sucked on her bottom lip.
"Is there a problem with that?" Again, he was smirking.
"It's called a uniform," the women responded as if Toni was an idiot. She poked her with the needle.
"You're just as bad as Hydra. Stop calling yourself a hero, because you never were one. You're a villain. A killer. A cool blooded executioner. No, you're worse than Hydra. You've spilled more blood than Hydra. You-"
Toni glanced at Bruce for a second as he finished wrapping her ankle, before she returned her attention back to the TV. She normally didn't care for news, and even if it sounded cold, she didn't care who had died in this large city. Yes, she hated the idea of human lost and she would protect it, but she couldn't find it in herself to care now. It was his fault after all.
"Let me go back and get a coat for her. She doesn't have one and she could be freezing."
"I'm fine, Tasha. No need to babysit," he says, feeling exhausted. He would rather face an army of robots than deal with Natasha's hundred questions… Or maybe not. He's almost willing to answer Rogers' and Barnes' questions over hers. Almost. "I hear Rogers make a good nurse."
"Yes, Sir," they replied at the same time.
"Write that down," he stated with a laugh.
Ever since Toni had bolted out of medical wing, Peggy had been 'glued' to her side, making sure she was okay and never alone. "I'm fine, Mother Hen," Toni replied mockingly. "And I'm going." She was tired of people trying to tell her what to do. If she said she was fine then she was fine... even if she was exhausted.
Tony tells himself, but he knows he won't be able to. "Checking up on me, Cap?" he asks, angrily. "I don't need you to keep track of me." Rogers doesn't move an inch when Tony gets to his feet, and he is mere inches from him. "I don't need a baby sitter, so you and Barnes can back off!"
he thought. He wasn't going to let her die. Determination filled Steve as he got to his feet and rushed over to Toni. Even if she would not approve, he would not allow her to get hurt. He had to get her to safety and the best place for her was in her suit, even if it put her in the line of fire. He didn't know what he would do if she got hurt again…even if it wasn't technically again for her yet.
Steve chuckled. "You like saying that?" He liked hearing it.
Though the device even with increased power could not bypass the 10 foot range, she couldn't know predict what would happen to the electronics within the range. Toni looked down at her chest piece and wondered if it would withstand the device. She had taken steps to make sure her Arc Rector would withstand the wave, but there was always a change that it wouldn't. There was a part of her that didn't care about the risk to the Arc Rector, and that scared her. Why didn't she care for her own life? "It'll be fine."
As soon as Barnes got some distance away, Toni grabbed Steve by his arm and pulled him back. This would be the last time that she saw any of them and she wanted to give Steve some words of advice. "Steve."
She just had two major issues: no self-control and she put
Toni's eyes widened at the sound of that, and her heartbeat begun to race at the mention of her father. Did her warning worked? Did he hear her? Was he live? If so, where was he? She wanted to see him. She needed to see him.
This beating seemed to last forever, and when Schmidt's hand came back bloody, she couldn't take anymore. "Stop," she yelled, which only caused Schmidt and Madame Hydra to laugh. "Stop! Just stop." She thrashed in her chair, bruising herself with each shake. She knew she was being stupid as she was tiring herself out and ruin any plan to escape.
The Gangster-want-a-be looked up at her, his eyes narrowing. He didn't answer as if he didn't know how to speak, or maybe he didn't know what to say. It was possible that he didn't know who she was, as the lighting was anything but decent. There were barely any light, too dark to make out any features, so it was possible.
When Toni woke the next morning, she didn't remember much, only recalling Steve's arms wrapped around her. She recalled talking to him, but she didn't remember what was said. She couldn't even guess, but she slept amazing well in Steve's arms, like a baby. However, that didn't stop her from waking up alone, which was frustrating to say the least. She hated waking up alone, especially when she had a bad day. And yesterday was a
However, until next time. :)
"Yea, Tony, we're sorry," Rogers says, shifting slightly to look at his face. "We should've realized."
His eye brow rose. "You call Schmidt capturing and torturing you taking care of yourself?" he asked. He took another step toward her, blocking her view of the bar.
Shaking her head, she returned her attention to the two men in front of her, who had not notice her yet. She had to get away, before they did. If they did, she would be in handcuffs again, but she wouldn't be in a hospital bed. She would be locked in a cell, where the Colonel wanted her.
"Are you okay, Toni?"
"I just wanted to make sure no one else would bother you," Peggy answered as she crossed to her cot. She sat as well, but she kept her glance away from Toni.
Steve gave her another sorry look as he opened his mouth to say something. He could've been saying something as his mouth was moving in a specific pattern, but Toni wasn't focused on him anymore, wasn't paying him any attention. She was focused on the man who had stepped out of the craft and headed toward the door. There were a few agents waiting on the pad, but it was the first one that caught Toni's eyes, which widened in recognition.
Wanda's expression softens. "It is not physical. It is emotional," she states, her accent thick. "Tell them, Stark."
The agent didn't have time to answer as two heavy armed men came rushed into the room from the door behind the woman. He stared at them for a few seconds, unsure of what was going on. These men looked strange, wearing full blacks, and their uniform looked like nothing he had seen before. Even the HYDRA uniform didn't look like that.
Toni couldn't see it, and she had no idea of where he was getting at. There was no way that he knew that she was his daughter. "A theory that you're completely and utterly insane?" she asked.
He took a long look at her. "Wait, why is that? Did something happen? Don't you have any friends or family to take you in?" he asked, not giving her any time to answer.
Jones placed a hand on the old wooden table and pushed up. "Toni."
Holding back her growl, she glared. Her arms were at her side. "Then let me go."
For a second, Tony is shocked by her tone, but he doesn't show it. "Everything suits me, and I mean everything," he says with a dirty smile.
He looked back at her. "I draw for newspapers and stuff."
Toni sat there a few seconds, taking in the heat from his hand. Steve always seemed to run hot, which was something she needed right then. "I'm fine, just annoyed that he forced me out of the suit with that device." She replied with a light smile. "He won't get lucky next time."
His eye twitched at that. "I don't need a love sick Super Soldier, and I doubt Carter's happy with that."
"I know," he stated through his teeth.
And PS. go watch DareDevil. It was great. I watched it all in two days.
Anyhow I hope you like.
"I'm sorry. Those were his last words." Shaking his head, he didn't have time for this. Whatever was happening, he needed to figure it out, but first, he needed to find Toni. Either way, someone was lying to him. "Excuse me."
It took everything Steve had to not say anything when it was nonstop. Bucky would've insulted them and pouched them for even thinking like that about Toni. However, Steve, being the peaceful person that he was, didn't say a word. They would have to shut up? He forced himself to take a few deep breaths, focusing on how amazing it felt to have Toni in his arms. He focused how wonderful it felt to be with her and how he wouldn't let her go, even if she didn't want to get married.
Toni could feel her heart race as she didn't know if she could handle this right now, not now. Granted she knew Steve and her father were right about her guilt; it was still a struggle, a struggle not to hate herself. And with her emotions all over the map, she wasn't sure that she could deal with people, not a crowd of them anyhow. "So this is what happens when I leave? Geez, People. Geez."
without you."
Howard had been here? He had seen her? Closing her eyes, she tried to relax herself, because if her breathing kept at this pace, she would go into a panic attack. Toni Stark did not have panic attacks. "Howard was here?" she asked.
"I'll make you cry," Natasha replied, giving Clint a look. Her legs were still draped across Bruce's lap, while she rested against the arm rest.
"Captain," Peggy started interrupting the three.
"Not really a hospital." She glared. "Well, it isn't. Just a medical bay for injured soldiers," Howard said, shrugging.
Something in her mind snapped as Toni realized who she was talking to. He wasn't her friend; he was friends with Colonel Salty, who wanted her secrets. "Nice try, but I won't tell you anything," she responded, knowing it was already too late. She stated too much.
"Yup, you're going to kill me," she replied, looking at her. Her face was completely red, and he loved it.
Steve nodded as he wanted to know what was happening with that mission. Did they find the devices? Did they know who was behind it? Steve so hoped they did, because if they did, they would be one step closer in bringing back Toni, his anchor. He would be able to sleep again. He would be able to dream again, knowing she was safe with him.
"What condition?" she asked, jumping to her feet to follow him. Was he playing with her?
*O*O*
"I swear," he said, looking rather pleased with himself.
Hearing footsteps, she guessed they were Pepper's as they were too light to be anyone else. "It is, so please take it easy on her today," Pepper ordered. "Please just let it go. She doesn't want to remember it."
"Don't touch her," Rogers snapped, glaring at the woman as she twisted her fingers into Toni's hair. Knowing Toni well, he could recognize the fear in her eyes, and he didn't like it.
"It would be unwise-"
Toni turned to see Rogers who had a curious look in his eyes. She wasn't sure how long he was standing there, watching her with that look. The shrimp Rogers was much quieter in his movements than the giant Captain Rogers. He had been able to sneak up on her a few times already, which irritated her. Shaking her head, she took a deep breath as everything he did seemed to annoy her. She knew he was trying his best to get her to like him, and if she didn't know the future Rogers, she would like him, but she can't get the future asshole out of her mind. However, if he knew her, he wouldn't care if she liked him. He wasn't the only asshole; she was one too but bigger. "It's fine," she stated as she waved him off.
I am sorry that it took me so long to get this out. I blame Fan fiction. People know my weakness!
"What?" Howard uttered, shocked. "Who would…Who do I need to…?"
"Barnes," Barton offers with a smirk, which Tony can't help but hate.
"Toni."
"I think I understand just fine," Rogers replied, clearly annoyed as he turned to leave.
Barnes takes the plates, but he doesn't take it upstairs. He harshly dumps it in the trash as he heads upstairs, and he doesn't turn back when he leaves. He doesn't see the pain written on Tony's face when he returns to whatever he was working on. He doesn't see the pain in his back as Tony hunches over his desk. Barnes doesn't see any of this.
. "No," he says, knowing those three little words would do more damage than good.
"I get that, but can I talk to you in private, Steve?" Barnes asked, pointing to his room.
Toni, unwilling to panic just yet, narrowed her eyes at him with a pointed look, while she forced herself to take a deep breath. "You either stop this car, or so help me, god, I will punch you and shove my foot up your ass."
"Behind you, Stark."
Sam glanced between the two as the expression on his face softened. "No wonder the media eats you two up. You two are
"Okay, Toni," he stated. His voice sounded strain.
"Here, we go," Peggy stated as they walked out onto the streets.
Her flight impulses started to kick alive, and she fought against her bindings with a surge of mysterious energy. Her head bobbled as she struggled to keep it up. Leaning her back, she opened her eyes and tried to focus on her surroundings, but everything was in a daze. She couldn't make anything out, only seeing shadows. Trying to focus, she tossed her head around as if shaking her head would jolt it awake. For a while, Toni stared blankly at ceiling as she moaned lightly. Her body didn't want to move, but it had to. She had to get out of here; however, even with her fast beating heart, she couldn't muster anything.
"What are you talking about?" Banner asked as he stared hard at Steve.
Getting a call from Pepper was one of the most stressful experience of Steve Rogers' life, and that was saying something. Having in fought in WW2, he had called and spoken to the loves ones of many deceased soldiers and comrades, as he had to inform the families of their death. Each time, he had done so without sheading a tear. He had done so with a smooth, strong voice, trying to give the families the rock they needed—granted some might say he was too cold, but it was just a shell. Each call stabbed his heart, but he kept it in as he couldn't be weak in front of his men. However, this time, he couldn't, and he knew why.
Philips looked up at Toni. "You heard right. Men, can you leave us for a few minutes?" he asked as he turned to his desk. "And close the flaps when you leave."
"Apologize, now!" Barnes ordered. His fists were balled.
I would like to thank Ayahne, who helped me correct the Google translations.
"Toni," Rhodes yelled. "You don-"
At least, her nightmares were gone for the night and she dreamt of nothing, absolutely nothing. Her mind was a blank. From her exhaustion, Toni fell into a deep sleep with no thought, and she was able to sleep without her terrors. She was able to sleep for once, which was a weird feeling. For her, it was weird to be rested.
He put the paper down slowly and turned to her, but his eyes didn't stay on her for long. "It came out wrong before."
He smiled, as they both knew he was getting to her. "But I do. I knew what you were going to do."
"Oh, look it's the Stars and Stripes," she said, finally after a few long seconds of silent. "Are you all spangled today?"
"If anyone sounds like a bully, it's you," Clint responded, as both Steve and he closed the distance between them.
However, there was no calming the man, who looked high. Gary the Cameraman was hopping like a loud rabbit looking for a mate, causing anyone to either cover their ears or be prepared to be mentally scarred. "Toni Stark is in my van!"
Steve kept his glance on Toni, but she could see him falter a bit. "That was a mistake."
Romanoff followed his stare and stepped in front of it when she noticed where he was looking. "Don't overthink this. Stark is doing the right thing, by taking her time. Even if she doesn't completely understand it, she loves you."
"No," he says softly. He's right. That relationship isn't going work with him, not when he's an ass with an ego the size of the moon. It was right to end it before anyone got hurt, not that he isn't hurting. It feels like someone has ripped out his heart and stepped on it. "What is your assessment of my mental state, FRIDAY?" he asks, softly.
So in case you wonder why I skip certain scenes, I don't like giving you movie quotes if nothing is changing- nothing major. Why give you scenes that you already seen in the movies? That seems like something to add to the word count and not the story.
On til next time.
She felt somewhat relief wash over her as he agreed. She just wanted to get this over with and just go. "Thanks," she said, as she glanced down at her bare chest. Her tags sat just above the curve of her boobs with the chain pooling at her neck. She didn't think about hiding them, as she wanted this to be over with as quiet as possible. "You should consider yourself lucky, Bruce. You're getting to second base without buying me dinner."
Today was no different, but it didn't last. As soon as Carter left, Toni was wide awake. Kicking her feet over the edge of the cot, Toni buttoned up her shirt, which was partly undone to allow for some freedom around her neck. The good thing about rooming with Peggy was that she knew about the reactor and Toni didn't have to hide it, though she did catch the Agent staring at it. The reactor, which was dim as ever, had seemed to have stabled, but that didn't mean anything. It could still fail at any moment, and she knew for sure it would fail if that device misfired like it did before in the lab.
Fuck, Toni thought. She knew she was in trouble, because only Salty knew her name. Peggy must have spoken to him and she must have seen her photo. "I do not do easy."
"Because-"
"Yes," he said. "I will be your shield."
The Asset shook his head as he turned from the cliff. He had other things to worry about, and this mind wandering wasn't going to get him anywhere. It would only slow him down, and besides, it was pointless. His sour feeling wasn't important, nor would it solve anything. There was only one thing that the Asset had to do and that was to find the Brunette, who took off somewhere in her suit. He also had to find her before his Handlers tracked him down, which wouldn't be too long.
It took her longer than expected to get to the control room. Even with her father gone, there was more security than she expected. She had to duck and drive every few seconds to avoid being caught. She thought she could 'blend in' if she found some kind of a uniform to change into, but she hadn't seen one single woman in this place, which was hard to believe. Yes, Toni understood that there wouldn't be female guards but there were other positions…
The look in Steve's eyes changed again as he stepped toward Toni. This time, he had seen the change in her shoulders. "What?"
"This is true… but again, you could be saying this to make me believe you."
Natasha gave him a look. "You know, Rogers, the suit will be faster," she said.
"And yet, you think the world of each other," Sharon added as she slid the phone over to Toni. "What do you see in that picture?"
"I know," Steve repeated harshly, cutting the AI off. "It would be quicker for the suit." He knew it; it was logical, but he couldn't bring himself to care. "Fine."
Howard let out a sigh. "I tell myself that every night, but I can't seem to make myself believe it."
"Are you okay, Toni?" Peggy asked, eyeing her from her side of their quarters.
Toni smiled as she stepped to the Iron Man Suit. "So where is my welcome home party?" she asked, staring at the bright red armor. Her eyes followed the sharp lines, as her mind started to flip on her. Was she kidding herself? "So where is my party?" What was wrong with her? Why was she thinking this way? Why did she keep doing this to herself? Why was she so self-destructive? Did she do this to herself on purpose? Did she deserve this? Did she deserve anything?
When did Steve become so good at kissing? Seriously, how? Who the hell was he kissing? He had to be practicing, because there was no way her Shrimp was this good. Before the serum, he was a small, awkward man, who couldn't get a girl, a
His heart pounded against his chest. Did she say what he thought she said? Was he hearing things? No, she really did say those words. He bounced back to his childhood and the countless light heads he suffered through as a child. She was making him feel like that sick kid again with a few simple words, but it felt different. "I love you too." He spoke, feeling her breath against his face. God, that felt amazing.
He rounded the lab table with his eyes on the device. "Why don't you tell me what this thing does besides sucking out power?"
. The stupid old man jokes are coming. Damn it!) and going straight to his labs with some idea that he can't get out of his heads. He remembers getting settle at this desk with a range of tools and materials, and he remembers when he had started to drift, but he doesn't remember moving to the couch. "FRIDAY," he calls.
