"But I should be able to the day after that, okay?"
Had the United States just been plunged into complete chaos, the likes of which not even HYDRA could have predicted?
Tony said again, this time not even trying to hide his whine as Steve finally moved down to his ass, cupping each cheek in one large palm and squeezing gently. He squirmed on the bed, gasping at the friction of the sheets against his crotch as Steve's index finger slipped into his crack, slowly dragging along the length of it. "Honey, now you're just teasing me!"
"I'd really rather not talk about that dinner, if it's okay," he muttered, shoving a French fry into his mouth.
"He's gone!" Steve cried, groaning in pain as he tried to roll onto his side, halting when his hands cried out in protest. "Oh God, Nat! He's—he's gone! My boy is gone, and now… I'm just so afraid that I'm gonna lose Tony too!"
"That's very noble of you, Chief Stacy," Steve said quietly. "And I know Peter appreciates your… understanding. None of these events have been his fault, and in fact—"
"He said, 'it's not working', Steve," said Natasha over the intercom. "'He is fighting it!'"
Peter blinked, his eyebrows knitting together. "Um… no? Ned, what're you even talking about?"
(See the end of the chapter for
gone just a teensy bit overboard, but in his mind, there was no such thing as overboard when it came to protecting his family.
"Me too, mo grá, me too," Steve said as he kissed the top of Tony's head. "And I know Bucky's relieved as well. He would hate for Peter to have to see him as anything other than his true self."
"Someone outside the company?" Tony asked. He curled his fingers around his left arm, squeezing against the tingling pain.
They were about three blocks from home when Peter spoke up again. "Um, my Decathlon Captain, Liz, invited our team to come to a party at her house this Friday. It's just gonna be food and pop and games and stuff, so do you think I could go?"
"Yes, but this wasn't exactly just any regular mission, right?" said Papa, and Peter could've cried at how gentle and reassuring he was. Papa was right; it hadn't been just any other mission. But not even he knew the extent as to why since Dad had been planning on telling him once the trial missions were a success.
"Hold on," Tony said. He banked suddenly and swooped down, allowing the suit tailing him to fly overhead which he quickly took out with a well-aimed missile right below the neck, the only weak spot that he'd been able to asses on the suits so far.
"Huh? You think Howard Stark was actually innocent now?"
"No, Tony, Peter knows that," Steve forced past the knot in his throat. "He's just—"
“You can do it, honey,” said Dad.  “You are strong enough.  Pete and I both know it.”
"Well, maybe I was saving most of it for you," Steve answered as he patted Tony's hip. "Sleep now, sweetheart. I've got you."
"Sam, I am so, so sorry. I should've—I should've gotten to him faster, I should've—"
"Well, we're not gonna make you sleep in your van, if that's what you were thinking," said Steve. He jerked his head towards the hallway that led to the three guest suites. "There are two other families staying with us that you might run into, but it should still be plenty quiet."
"That's 'cause he won't be, babe," Tony stated. "I don't care what he says or how much he begs, he's still just a kid."
"Deputy Chief George Stacy," JARVIS began. "Deputy Stacy began his career as a police officer when he graduated from the police academy in Queens, then proceeded to move to the Bronx where he was stationed for the last two decades, ultimately rising to the rank of deputy chief. He was transferred to the Midtown precinct approximately three months ago, but it is unclear if the transfer was requested or simply assigned."
"You got it, babe," Tony said, his grin widening as Peter rolled his eyes just before his mask closed over his face. The kid may be seventeen now, but apparently he still thought his dads’ googly eyes were silly.
"Tony, what's—what's happening? Where's Peter?"
The corners of Steve's lips curled into the slightest of smiles. "Together," he said. "Okay?"
"Um… so… JARVIS said you came up 'cause your arm's acting up?" Peter asked past the large knot in his throat. How could he have been so completely thoughtless?
Steve was quiet for a moment, his mind swirling with the possible ramifications of Tony's theory. "And so you think they could eventually use these attacks as an excuse to come after us?"
"I think he's implying that after flying for over twenty hours in relatively close quarters, that the air you'll be expelling from your mouth might not be very pleasing to whoever this prince is that we're about to meet," answered Natasha. "Which, in your case, would be the truth."
And, to top it all off, Dad and Papa even managed to remember to soundproof their bedroom after they tucked him in later that night, something that Peter was
"Wait… so if that's the case, then—?"
Still, Tony did appreciate Carol's attempt at following the rules, especially since he had a strong feeling that his bone-deep exhaustion was starting to become more and more physically evident. The last thing he needed now was to come off as anything besides knowing exactly what he was doing.
"Oh, Captain! I'm so glad to hear your voice!" Scott nearly shrieked. He raked his fingers through his disheveled hair, gesturing towards his van. "Um… I know—I know this is probably gonna sound pretty crazy, but… well… I think—I think I might have an idea on how to fix all of this."
"Yep," Quill said proudly. "Part of her job was to put him to sleep."
"Dad and the rest of the team should be on their way," Peter whispered after they had taken a tentative step. "So—"
"Stop it, Flash!" Gwen said, her green eyes bright with anger even as she glanced worriedly at Peter. "You're just being mean! You know Peter didn't have a choice to go to that safehouse last year, so why don't you just shut up about things that you don't understand!"
“Who hired these scientists?” Tony cut in.
"Okay, so… what're we gonna do?" asked Clint. "'Cause I hate to say it, but—"
"Well, at least there's that," muttered Steve. He had absolutely no reason not to trust Sam, so if Sam thought that he and Peter could work through Peter's nightmares on their own then Steve wasn't going to say anything. He and Tony had just had a conversation about that very thing a few nights ago, following Peter's fifteenth birthday dinner. As Peter enjoyed reminding them from time to time, he was a teenager now, and Steve and Tony were trying to give him the space he desired while still keeping as close an eye on him as they could.
"So, I was thinking," he said as he pulled the truck back onto the street. "It's been awhile since we've had one of our coffee dates, so why don't we have one of them this morning, hmm?"
"Yes, sir!" he said firmly. He cleared his throat as he pushed down on the throttle, resuming the speed needed to exit the atmosphere. "JARVIS, can you please recalculate our exit points?"
Peter's eyes narrowed even further. "Oh," he said warily. "Okay, so then what are you doing here?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Burning hot anger surged through Peter, so strongly that he felt like stomping a hole through the floor. It didn't help that he was already tired so his vision was starting to warp, requiring a good deal of his concentration to keep it somewhat normal. His senses always got messed up when he was tired or upset, and even worse when he was both.
"It will for all of us," agreed Steve. "And yeah, there will be a lot of uncertainty and fear out there in the beginning, because people won't understand what happened and they tend to fear what they don't understand. But once people realise that they no longer have to cower in the dark every single night, afraid of getting bombed by the enemy, I'm guessing that that fear won't last very long."
All of which just made Peter's own feelings of frustration and helplessness that much worse. He could help, he knew that he could. He was so much more than just some scrawny kid who was afraid of his own shadow, as that asshole Rumlow had so bluntly put it. He was Spider-Man. Even if he had to keep it a secret.
“Nah, I’d be really surprised if they’re part of it,” Tony said with a dismissive wave of his hand.  “If Pierce is one of the bigwigs with HYDRA, then he’s not gonna surround himself with more of ‘em.  I’m thinking that the buck has to stop with Pierce.”
"I haven't," Papa said softly. "Especially if Thor's popularity is any indication."
"Mmm. Well, let's hope that it sticks," grumbled Howard. The blackout was already severely limiting his patience, leaving him unable to continue his research into a new power source that could potentially replace the destroyed power plant, and the last thing he needed at the moment was for Tony to wake up crying because he was scared. The boy was six already, it was far past the time for him to be bursting into tears every time something didn't go his way.
And it wasn't just Tony, everyone else was there too. Gamora, Nebula, Scott, Sam, Bucky, Wanda, King T'Challa. The tree.
Sniffing, Tony began a series of test programs to ensure that no pesky bugs had managed to hitch a ride into the main matrix. Finding none, he then proceeded to create a virtual storage compartment inside his hard drive, not wanting to run the risk of JARVIS being discovered and potentially confiscated before Tony could complete the rest of the project's parameters.
Steve had told Tony several times that the complete elimination of HYDRA had been the original mission of Captain America during the war, and that he fully intended to see it through.
Peter repeated. "She'd be stupid to turn down something like that, and Gwen is nowhere near stupid!"
"Yeah, yeah," Steve said. "So, where'd you have in mind this morning."
It had only been a few weeks that he'd even been able to recall those memories, the coma he had been in for months following the Miami battle having repressed them so deeply that it'd taken until now for them to reemerge.
And now, after his colossal—and way too dramatic, thank you very much—washouts from both tennis and soccer, and with baseball out of the question for pretty much the same reason, the Emergency Room doctor’s suggestion of swimming is just about the only thing Peter has left.
"Steve—!"
"It was really nice of your dad to let you borrow his car today," she said as Peter opened the passenger door of the bright orange Audi, holding her bag while she slid inside. Dad had transmitted the key frequency to his phone once he and Papa had dropped it off, reminding him to be extra careful on the busy streets.
And yet… he still was.
"Captain Rogers has arrived in the penthouse, sir," JARVIS said, a second before Tony picked up Steve's steady footsteps heading towards the lab, followed by Sam and Bucky. Tony's heart gave a flutter as his tall, blond-haired, drop-dead gorgeous husband came into view, dressed in a pair of jeans that showed off his magnificent ass to perfection, and his New York Mets sweatshirt and baseball cap that almost exactly matched the blue in his eyes.
"This is Donald Gill," he said. "From what we've found, Gill was a scientist for SHIELD who was working on a couple of super-secret projects that involved cryokinesis. Apparently, the lead scientist on those projects, who we still have yet to identify, thought they would be useful for military applications."
"Oh," Steve said as his shoulders sagged in relief. "Oh, that's—that's good. Thank you."
It was an image that, even almost four years later, he still couldn't shake no matter how hard he tried. And he had
"Oh, great. 'Cause that won't make him any less insufferable," grumbled Peter. While he had no doubt that Dad would get him his own car once he turned sixteen next year, Flash never seemed to waste an opportunity to remind Peter that he was both bigger than him and an entire year older.
The type of heart defect Peter has is an atrial septal defect (ASD) with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. It is a congenital defect that while not automatically lethal, does require repair for the patient to live beyond their childhood years.
"Oh really?" asked Steve as he popped the button on Tony's pants, tugging them and his underwear off and onto the floor. He ran his hands up Tony's lean, muscular legs up to his thighs, watching as they quivered under his touch. "Well if that's the case, then why doesn't my gorgeous fella tell me what he wants, and I'll see what I can do?"
"Sounds good, J." Tony held out his phone, indicating for Lang to sign his electronic W-2, stepping back once he was done. "Someone from our cyber security department will contact you tomorrow with your first assignment, understood?"
"All right. What's your play?"
And no matter how many times Tony tried to tell him that he had never been expected to take down HYDRA on his own, not during the war—wasn't that what the Howling Commandos and the rest of the SSR were for?—and certainly not now, Steve didn't believe him.
Because if any word could describe Tony's life now, it was that.
Ned let out a heavy sigh. "All this girl stuff is so frustrating!"
That's the one thing that Peter doesn’t like about swimming.  The getting out of the pool part.
"Yeah, it does, doesn't it?" Steve said as he took the rest of the stick from Peter, placing it back into its jar. "Go ahead and sprinkle it into the mug now, all right?"
Peter popped another piece of popcorn into his mouth from the huge bucket sitting on his lap, washing it down with a quick sip of Dr Pepper. His right hand was entwined with Gwen's, having been so since about five minutes into the movie when something had made her jump, and her head was leaning comfortably against his arm. He had dressed in four separate layers in addition to his jacket, knowing that movie theatres were usually cold, but there was so many warm fuzzies radiating up his arm and across his chest from Gwen's touch that at the moment he was almost
“All right, bud.  Sounds good.”
"Oh yeah. Loads of people. We've got the same eyes, the same hair, the same nose and mouth." He held out his hands, inspecting his fingers. "We've even got the same hands. And Papa says that we make a lot of the same faces too."
Oh well.  Getting a bit of sleep before hooking brand-new experimental tech up to Papa’s brain could only be a good thing.
"The boy is going to die, Tony," he said coldly. "I know it, and so does he. And the sooner you start admitting it to yourself the better off both of you will be."
"Yeah, and we've both told
"That's everyone, Rogers," said the voice of Colonel Phillips. "All the pilots are ready. A-shift has been cleared to depart."
"Copy that, J." Tony had created what he'd called 'practise satellites', which while similar in size and weight to the real Phoenix devices would self-destruct so as to not cause issues with the deployment of the actual functioning satellites later on. It had been essential for him to test whether or not the deployment mechanisms would function properly in a vacuum, and judging by his readings and Steve's comments, they had worked just fine.
“It’s even more impressive when you see it,” Peter said.  “Please say you’ll come.
Like Peter.  The son Tony loves more than anything in this world, the next world, and even three worlds over.
"But—!" Gwen's lower lip shook as she wrapped her arms around Peter's computer, as if it were Peter himself. "I just want to help. Peter, he just hasn't been the same since they took his papa away, and—"
“What the hell are you talking about?” he asks.
Taking Tony's hand, Steve guided him down the hall into their suite, settling them onto the plush couch in their sitting room with Tony's hands in his.
"Duly noted, J," said Tony with a sigh. He curled his hand around his left arm, squeezing against the tingling pain that always flared up when he was anxious. "Go ahead and run another diagnostic while I talk to Steve, make sure he's okay with starting production."
Steve's eyebrows knitted together, and he glanced over at Tony with such anguish in his blue eyes that a lump rose in Tony's throat.
"In here," Shuri said as two guards opened the doors to the palace into a wide, ornately decorated hallway. "My lab is just around this corner."
"So, how did you get him to calm down?" Steve asked. Despite the horrible circumstances, he couldn't help but admit that he was enjoying Tony's story. He loved hearing about what Peter was like when he was little. "What ended up working?"
that there are actual people out there who can afford to spend half a million dollars on a car that’s not only completely impractical but also begging to get scratched up—or worse—on the New York streets, Peter is still glad that whoever these rich people are, they know that Dad’s the best person to take care of their fancy, rich-people cars.
Plus, Tony couldn't wait to start tinkering again, to lose himself in a project just because it was fun. It'd been years since he'd had the time.
"So," Gwen said breathlessly once they broke apart. "Do you think we should see if we can find Aquarius too? It's not quite the right time of year for maximum visibility, but since your telescope is so nice, we just might—"
It was Brock Rumlow, the very same man who had tried to hold Peter hostage inside a Washington D.C. SHIELD building during the Chitauri invasion. And all this time, Steve had thought he had died during the Battle of the Triskelion.
"No kidding, right?" exclaimed Scott. "Wow, Captain, you're really good at that!"
"Uh huh," mumbled Peter. "Just tired."
Several seconds of stunned silence followed O'Brien's command as Joseph and his two wingmen exchanged identical looks of shock. Joseph had been expecting an order to return to base, but the possibility of a ceasefire, a complete cessation of all military activities, was so remote that it hadn't even crossed his mind. The war between Langara and Meridia had been ongoing in some form or another for decades, longer than Joseph had even been alive, and to think that it was just suddenly over… well…
"Just a kid I met at the hospital," said Steve. "From what he tells me he's got a pretty messed-up heart, one that should've been fixed a long time ago, and I just thought—"
Which is why, despite all of Natasha’s gentle—and some not-so-gentle—prodding, Steve absolutely
Rogers' smile grew impossibly wider, his blush creeping all the way up to his perfect ears. "Great," he said. "I'll… um… I guess I'll see you then. Thank you, Mr Stark. Or can I call you Anthony?"
"There ya go, honey," he said as he propped Steve's feet up on his spare pillow. The hospital had cut Steve's flight suit and undersuit from his body while they'd worked on him, so he was now dressed in the same kind of scrubs worn by most of the medical personnel. "I'm gonna go get you something to eat now, okay? I'll be right back."
Until it happened again.
Other than that, they hadn't really had the time to contemplate much.
“What in the goddamn hell is this?” Obie bellowed as Fury finished fastening the cuffs.  “Tony, are you really gonna stand there and let this happen?  After everything we’ve been through together?  C’mon, kid!  I’ve known you your whole life!”
"We have no way of knowing that!" yelped Tony. "Absolutely none! Which means—!"
"Yeah, I'm still here," Steve replied, way too calmly for Tony's rising panic level. "But it seems like I've lost JARVIS."
Tony chuckled.  “Hey, you gotta give me one every now and then, right?” he said as he ruffled Peter’s freshly trimmed hair.  As he’d promised, he had taken Peter for a much-needed haircut on Saturday morning after they’d had a nice breakfast at one of Peter’s favourite cafes.  It had been so long since Peter had last had his hair cut that the barber had to take off almost two inches, and Tony had been utterly shocked by how much older he had suddenly looked afterwards.
It’s going to be an annoyingly long day till 4pm rolls around.
Or, at least not practically every single night. It was almost like they'd still just gotten married or something with the way they were with each other. Even Ned and Gwen had pointed it out after watching the two of them interact, and that had been tamed down considerably.
Tony thought as he pinched the bridge of his nose.  He didn't really want to think about the five-alarm tantrum Obie would throw if he were to show up at the office empty-handed.  According to Obie, the military leadership was “chomping at the bit” to hear all about the new Jericho missile that was “going to change modern warfare as we know it”, or whatever such bullshit line Obie had fed them.
The serum had healed him.
"Oh God, what the hell was I thinking?" Peter cried as Gauntlet Man reappeared with another rifle, firing a shot that came so close Peter felt the heat from the blast go past his ear. Before he could react Gauntlet Man fired another shot, this time severing the web attached to the van. Rolling and bouncing, Peter finally skidded to a halt, his entire body stinging and aching from bodysurfing on asphalt for the last three minutes.
"Sweetheart?" Steve asked, nudging Tony softly on the shoulder.
"You promise?"
They held hands as they rode the escalator up into the main lobby of the theatre. Since Peter had already bought their tickets the day before, he led Gwen straight over to the concessions area, and was busily scanning the menu when one of the cashiers, a big, burly dude with wild curly hair, waved him over.
"JARVIS, stop!" he exclaimed, flinching as the camera came to a halt. He blinked, slid his glasses back on, and proceeded to freak out when the image completely disappeared.
Working for the Langaran military was a job that most civilians could only dream of having, so what in the world could Anthony Stark possibly be so sad about?
"So, then, what it sounds like you need to do is figure out how to slow the ship down," said Strange. "And I suggest that you get started immediately."
"Yes, he is," Steve said proudly. "He's at least on par with my husband and Dr Bruce Banner, if not even more so."
"Shh, kiddo," Uncle Bucky murmured as he patted Peter's back. He glanced furtively at the monitor, grimacing. "You gotta try and calm down, okay? We don't want Ms Sarah to hear us, right?"
"Of course I am, little guy," Steve replied, almost cringing with how fake he sounded. "Why wouldn't I be?"
Steve watched Bucky go, still struggling to breathe in the dust-laden air that smelled of ozone, gunpowder, and teargas. It was only supposed to have been a diplomatic mission, not yet another battle with the very same enemy that had haunted Steve ever since the war.
"So you chose my grandpa," Peter said, not without a hint of anger. "But you know that he didn't do anything, right? Someone framed him. Someone else blamed him for what they did because they were a
And as always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
Tony thought bitterly.
"Yeah," said Sam. "I can see why." He looked straight at Steve, shaking his head. "It was all in there, Steve. Operation Darkstalker is real."
It really couldn't get any better than that.
"But, Tony… Peter's name is on that list. Our son's name is on that list, which means that the people here knew about him and what he can do. And now we don't know where they've gone or who else they've told."
to me. And he's hotter than hell, too, I mean, that much is obvious, but… I dunno, it's kinda hard to explain. I just…
"All right," Steve said quietly. Peter's condition hadn't gone unnoticed by Steve either, and Tony knew that it not only worried him, it angered him that he was so helpless to do anything about it.
"Hey, Peter!" a kind voice suddenly said, startling Peter such that he jumped backwards and knocked the back of his head against the swinging locker door.
Peter bit down on his bottom lip. "Yeah, that sounds like him. He hates going to the doctor for anything, hates being fussed over, like he says. But are you sure he won't get worse? Dad doesn't get sick very often, he hasn't since I was little. But when he does, it tends to be pretty bad."
That, up there, that army waiting in space for the perfect moment to strike, was the endgame.
line you just stole, babe," said Tony. "And, anyways—"
Steve's piercing blue eyes flashed with anger, glaring down at Tony. "It tells us that Peter isn't safe, and that it's all my fault."
"Gwen, I—" Peter started, cut off by the sudden shriek of one of her younger brothers.
"All right, all right, I get it." Tony wound his arms around Steve's neck, eyeing him pointedly. "No more secrets, okay? I'll admit that I've got a couple of my own that I need to divulge too, so you're not the only one, but I mean it. We can't do this if we're gonna be keeping secrets from each other, Steve. I won't do it."
If he hadn't honest-to-God been

"Don't worry, I'll only hold it against you for a little while," Natasha replied from where Pietro had whisked her nearly a hundred metres away. "How's it looking now, Cap? Are we good?"
"If you actually mean is he eating practically everything in sight, Captain, then the answer is yes. His appetite has been especially voracious in the past few days."
At least forty minutes pass before Tony returns with three small bottles of water in his hands, the frown lines between his eyebrows harsher than ever.
Steve huffed, his grip tightening on Tony's arm. "I don't like it, Tony. If someone's managed to get their hands on those HYDRA artefacts, there'd be nothing from stopping them from turning them into weapons, or—or something even worse, and—"
"You have
"Holy shit, hon," he whispered. "We're really gonna do this."
He felt Tony’s lips twitch against his skin.  “Okay, honey.  If you say so.”
"Rhodey," said Colonel Rhodes. "Or James, if you would prefer that, but please, Steve, don't call me Colonel Rhodes when we're off duty. I don't wanna feel like you're gonna salute me every time you talk to me."
Watching them go, T'Challa turned his attention back to Tony and Steve. "Have no fear for your son's safety here, gentlemen," he said. "You have my solemn promise that no harm will come to any of you while you're within our borders."
"Yeah, yeah, hon," Tony said, rather dismissively. "You'd better get going and feed the kid, I'm sure Pete's trying to gnaw his own arm off by now."
“The interface is primed and ready, sir,” answered JARVIS.
"Yeah, I know," said Steve. "I just…" He trailed off, feeling more and more foolish with each passing second. Even Bucky, who'd grown up with most of the same mindsets and sentiments as Steve, had found it easier to open up over time.
"Yeah, which is why we wanted to see if you wanted to toss the ball around a bit," said Sam. "How long's it been since you last hit a baseball, anyway?"
snapped Dad. "Which is something that those of us who actually fight them know pretty well."
"Shit!" Bucky exclaimed as he suddenly swooped up, twisting around to line up his guns. "Why the hell's everyone bullying Stevie today?"
"Render is complete, sir," JARVIS said. "Would you like me to begin with the unit assembly, or run the diagnostic first?"
"Hey, did anyone ever tell you that you look a lot like Captain America?" the young man asked, who barely looked old enough to drive, much less be a police officer. He gasped as he stepped back, looking between Steve and Tony. "Oh my God, you really
T'Challa smiled slightly as a table server poured them all a large goblet of wine. "As I said earlier, Captain, there will be plenty of time to discuss such matters at a later time. Please, for now, let us just enjoy this lovely evening."
face. "Or at least, I hope I'll be okay."
He’s so happy and exuberant that Steve can’t help but laugh.  “It was just fine, little guy, thanks for asking.  And you can call me Steve, remember?”
, baby, you're just—
"But not to me." Tears spilled down Tony's cheeks before he could even attempt to stop them, the mere thought of losing Peter too much for his exhausted mind to even contemplate. He gathered Peter into his arms, breathing in the green apple scent of his hair that he'd always loved. "Not to me, buddy, you got that? I don't—I don't—"
Peter thought as he mindlessly started walking down the bustling hallway, towards his own locker.
"Well, well!" Thanos barked. "Look who's here!"
Finally, he spoke up, so softly he was surprised that Sam even heard him.
Peter’s face fell so fast Steve was surprised he didn't disappear into the couch cushions.  “Aww, already?  But it’s the weekend!  You always let me stay up later on the weekends!”
"Yeah, thanks, J," said Tony. "And if you don't mind, go ahead and dig into Howard's archives and pull up the number of that FBI agent that he used to have drinks with whenever he was in D.C., yeah? What was his name?"
"Um, maybe tomorrow, kiddo," Bucky answered. "I'm supposed to meet with Сэм once he and Стив get back."
"Even today?" Tony asked.
"Yeah, one—one of 'em," answered Peter, clearing his throat. "I've got two."
“Yes, we did,” Steve murmured into Tony’s hair, his tears wetting the strands.  “Oh God, Tony, this—this just means so
"I'd rather not until we can poke around a bit more," answered Tony. "But we should get Bruce in here ASAP, I'm gonna need his help."
Dad pursed his lips, pressing a gentle kiss to Peter's forehead. "Yeah, yeah, honey, you're right. Sorry, bud."
Steve said on a gasp as Tony slowly glided his shorts and underwear down his legs and onto the floor. Steve hissed as Tony's nimble fingers wrapped around his aching erection, his back nearly arching off the bed as Tony's lips teased the burning hot skin of his thighs and pelvis while he stroked him.
Helen had cut that damned HYDRA uniform from Steve's body once they'd wheeled him into the exam room, so Steve was already naked underneath the layers of blankets piled on top of him. After making sure that the water was warm enough, Tony started with his feet and legs, washing the dirt and dried blood from Steve's skin while being very careful to not aggravate his severe injuries or the two IV lines running nourishing fluids into his veins. His left foot alone almost made Tony want to vomit, the limb so crushed and misshapen that he couldn't understand how Steve had even been able to stand, much less walk, as Peter had witnessed at the bunker.
"He's right," Tony said, thick and low. "Pete… he—he's never had a grandparent that's really cared about him, about
“Nick?” Tony said slowly.  “What aren’t you telling me?”
And the fact that his "unkempt" hair was one of Uncle Bucky's ways of giving the Air Corps the middle finger made it even cooler.
“Well, buddy, you know not everyone’s as smart as you are, yeah?” said Tony.
"Always so antsy," Steve said with a smirk. He leaned down for a deep, sloppy kiss before reaching for the bottle of lube. "Back on your back now, okay?"
"Oh, you don't, hmm?" snapped Tony. "Well, that's just too damn bad."
"It's okay now, Papa, I've got you," Peter said, tears stinging his eyes as Papa attempted to open his, nearly swollen shut and so bruised they were almost black. The uniform he was wearing had the HYDRA symbol stretched across the chestplate, but it was so covered in blood and dust that it was barely recognisable.
"You're implying that we will be at some point?" Tony asked, incredulous. "You know what, nevermind. Can you—can you just come down here, Pete? Papa's gonna be leaving soon, and you need to be getting to bed."
"You're so beautiful, sweetheart," Steve murmured just before claiming Tony's lips. The kiss was sweet and almost chaste, with Steve's tongue running across Tony's lips just before he pulled away to trail kisses down his jaw and neck to his chest, and the kaleidoscope of scars directly over his sternum. Having met Tony when he did, Steve had never seen him without the scars, first with the arc reactor and then without, and while intellectually Tony knew that the sorry condition of his chest never bothered Steve, he sometimes couldn't help but wish that they would just go away already.
"Good. Now, why don't you head on back to bed, okay? I'm guessing there's someone there who might be waiting for you."
And an especially big thank-you to my awesome beta allthesinnersandthesaints 💖
"No wonder Hammer's company never sold anything of actual importance!" Peter said, grunting as he wiggled his fingers into the juncture between the suit's neck and shoulder and proceeded to yank out the relay. The suit immediately let out a loud whine, sputtering as Peter pulled hard on his web rope, trying to steer it away from the oncoming wall of the bunker.
"Yeah. He's been my best friend for my entire life," Steve said. "He's the one who pushed me to ask you out."
"You know that I do," Steve said softly. "But I'm an adult, Tony, and Peter isn't. And he shouldn't have to be worrying about his father so much."
"Yes," Gwen said quickly. "I'd—I'd love to see a movie with you. How 'bout a week from Saturday? My dad will be working then, so… he'll be more likely to say that I can go if he's nearby."
Tony shrugged, not meeting his son’s eyes.  “Eh, not too late.”  It technically wasn’t a lie.  Since he never even made it to bed and it was already after seven in the morning, that meant the term “late” no longer applied.
good, even if he'd never admit it out loud.
“Yes, that’s really important too,” Steve says.  “You may notice an increase in Peter’s appetite while he adjusts, so don’t be too surprised if that happens.  Swimming is a full-body sport and it burns a lot of calories, which means he’ll need to replenish those calories so he doesn't lose any muscle mass.”
"You just said, 'our' kid," Steve whispered. "As in both of ours. Like… he's my son too."
"Oh, mo grá," Steve murmured as he gathered his husband close. In all of the festivities that day, the fact that Tony had had yet another nightmare the night before had gotten pushed to the back of his mind. "Tony, those are just nightmares. It doesn't mean they're going to come true."
A flash of red light suddenly lit up the cell, and Steve felt his hand forcibly move back to his side and his heels snap to attention, the rest of his body pinned in place by some kind of invisible energy force.
Sucking in a deep, lung-searing breath, Steve continued on, holding his shield at chest-height as he scanned his surroundings, listening intently for more of the telltale buzzing sounds.  When no more appeared after a hundred metres or so, he checked his compass again, noting that he was still over ten kilometres away from the bunker’s location.
Steve gasped, inhaling a floating bubble of soap or shampoo that immediately caused him to choke.
But then again, O'Brien had been in control of the country for twenty-eight years, and not once had he ever mentioned anything resembling peace. In fact, it seemed as though in recent years that he'd grown even more warmonger-like, insisting on bigger weapons, more aircraft, more soldiers and pilots, and more and more sacrifices by anyone who wasn't military. There was even the odd rumour or two that the old general was ill, starting to lose his mind, but they were so hushed that no one ever dared to say them out loud.
"C'mon, buddy, I think we need to get you something to eat before you pass out, yeah?" Dad said. "And then right to bed after you do your homework."
Risking life and limb and God-knows-what else in messing with the laws that governed the universe was an infinitesimal price to pay for having his son back.
"Actually, Uncle Bruce is like Papa and Uncle Bucky," Peter muttered as they headed for his locker. "Enhanced after the fact."
"Oops," Tony said with a giggle, still high on his own post-coital bliss. "Guess we didn't miss the dinner after all."
At least, until it managed to break free again.
"Well… it is too damn early," Clint said, rather sheepishly. "You even said so yourself."
"What the—?" he muttered as he pushed himself up onto his elbow. On the opposite side of the bed Steve was still out, his strong arm sprawled across both Peter and Tony in that protective papa-bear hold that they both adored.
"What ends up happening to the monster?" she asked. "In your schoolbook, what happens to him?"
"I don't care so much about that anymore," said Tony. "I only want my boy to live. Pete's completely innocent in all of this."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hey," Gwen murmured as they said goodbye to Ned and exited the lunchroom. She elbowed Peter gently on the arm. "Where'd you go?"
He was just on the verge of sleep again himself when he heard Peter enter the lab, his jovial, "Hey!" to the guard bringing a soft smile to Steve's lips. How he had missed the sound of his son's voice!
"That's fine, sweetheart," Steve said, just as softly. "And I hope—I really hope that you like it. I designed it myself."
“Daaaddd,” Peter grumbles.  “I’m not
"Mmm," grumbled Tony as he broke off a big piece of the muffin, shoving it into his mouth. It was coming up on the time for him to check in with Steve, and he was both anxious for it and dreading it. Hearing Steve's voice would at least remind Tony that he was still alive, but having to tell him that they were no closer to bringing him home than they were six hours ago was going to be so incredibly painful that at the moment Tony had no idea how he was going to be able to handle it.
"Uh huh," answered Peter. "Love you."
"Yeah, but the aircraft are only a small part of what I need," muttered Tony. He pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to push back the fatigue headache he'd been nursing for the last three days.
"Typical," she said with a shrug. "Still, I will find you something."
“Oh, man, I am so ready for that,” Tony said.  He forced a smile onto his face, giving Steve a wink.  “Can’t wait to see what you can do with Mr Jarvis’s recipe.  I swear that guy was an honorary Italian the way he could cook.”
"Uhh, thanks," James said with a playful frown. "And yeah, I don't envy me either. But the people deserve to know exactly how they've been lied to for the last twenty-eight years."
"And I can verify that that is indeed the case," Gwen said with a short laugh. "My dad says the red cars are just easier to pick out on the roads, especially when they're speeding."
Because it was. It was just as mad as using a quantum tunnel to go back to the past to try and alter the future.
Grandma sighed, wringing her hands, her knuckles so swollen and bent that Peter was surprised she could even move them.
Peter squeezed her hand again, passing her one of the napkins just as a grenade landed inside the Rogue One ship, and proceeded to explode right in Bodhi's face.
Or, at least Steve thought it was water. But water wasn't usually…
“No, no, little guy, I’ve got it,” Steve tossed over his shoulder as he hurried towards the back.  He found Ashes in her usual spot in the doorway, swooping her into his arms and cuddling her as he spooned her food onto her dish.
, after Peter had managed to figure out the hidden location of the HYDRA bunker, fight off yet another semi-enhanced goon, and finally break in to the otherwise invisible building and find where they were holding Papa, his dads had
Tony buried his nose into Steve's hair, gripping him so tightly he was shocked that he hadn't yet torn his uniform. "Steve, you can't keep trying to lock all this stuff down and forget about it, okay? Believe me, that's exactly what I tried to do before Pete came along, and it almost killed me."
"Steve," Tony whispered as his entire body went lax against Steve's. He slowly turned his head, curling his arm around Steve's neck so they could press their lips together. "You're so good, honey. I love you."
"No way I can say no to that," Steve wheezed, practically growling as Tony undid his belt and pants button, working his hand inside Steve's underwear before he'd even pulled them off.
Peter nodded, feeling not too unlike one of Papa's bobble-head baseball figurines. "Where'd you move from?"
“Oh my God,” he rasped as his stomach gave a violent swoop and his head started to swim, grateful he was already on the floor as he watched Image Papa start tossing bloodied chunks of cinder blocks over his shoulder.  “Papa, I’m so sorry!”
Little Steve frowned, swiping his sleeve at the drop of ice cream dripping down his nose. "
him.  The very boy he’d been trying to protect, and all he’d managed to do was
"The incident involving the Avengers that took place here in D.C., at the Triskelion," Davis began. "What can you tell us about that?"
Tony thought as a violent shiver raced down his spine. He glanced behind him, his heart flipping as he saw that Peter was already shaking on his skis. He was already wearing a wetsuit designed for much cooler water due to his inability to regulate his own body temp, but the air temp had been close to thirty Celsius when they started, and it now felt closer to fifteen.
Tony Stark had
Steve grinned against Tony's shoulder. "You go right ahead and try,
"Oh, I'm used to noise, so that's no big deal," Scott said. "After I got out of prison, I had to live in this hotel that always had music blaring, and—"
“We’re gonna get out of this, Tony,” he says as he closes his eyes.  “I promise.”
"And I…" Tony forced out, his cheeks growing more and more grey with every beat of Steve's heart. His beautiful long fingers splayed apart, preparing to snap.
"This wasn't your fault, Tony," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "Absolutely not at all."
He was silenced by Tony's lips, pressing against his in a kiss meant to convey such a wide multitude of things that tears sprang to Steve's eyes. Love, acceptance, and understanding were just a few of the underlying aspects that Steve was able to take from Tony's simple, three-second kiss, not to mention the deep intimacy that defined every single one of their touches.
"Are you sure you'd be able to handle being that close to ice, little guy?" Steve said gently. "And the hockey arenas are always pretty cold, so you'd have to make sure that you stayed warm enough."
He'd still hoped though.
"Uhh," Peter stammered, his face flushing hot again.
"Shh," Steve said, barely awake himself. "Sleep now."
"Captain Rogers, I must apologise for the rather invasive questions presented by my colleague," the chairman said. "There was no need to bring your personal life into this session."
"So, uh, should we bow?" Steve heard Bruce ask James as he stepped onto the ramp, with Natasha a half-step behind.
"The car's right outside the entrance to this building," Steve said as they headed for the door.
"So," he said as he nuzzled the soft skin on the back of Gwen's neck. "Did you know that no one born blind has ever developed schizophrenia?"
"Good." He felt Papa kiss the top of his head again. "See you soon?"
"Yeah, I guess I'm pretty fond of you too," said Tony. He tipped his head back, sniffing as he wiped a tear from his cheek. "Even when you dump a whole boatload of work onto my lap. Actually, more like several boatloads."
"Hey buddy," he croaked. "How're you feeling, any better?"
"I wish I could," Steve said, his expression so downtrodden that Tony had no choice but to believe him. "But since I'm flying patrols today I'd rather not. A hard run helps me focus, and after last night," he paused to press a firm kiss to Tony's lips, "I think I'm going to need the extra help."
“January 30th, 2019,” Steve interrupted.  “A total of two hundred Stark Industries rifles are shipped to the Sokovian insurgents via a secret courier.  January 31st, 2019.  Fifteen hundred explodable bullets are shipped from Hammer Industries to the exact same address.  February 3rd, 2019.  A communique from General West to a Sokovian insurgent leader stating that a Special Forces team—
"Can't be too careful though, right, J?" Tony shot back. "Especially where Pete's safety is concerned?"
"He did indeed, Master Peter. However, I must protest at this course of action. Captain Rogers and Mr Stark's instructions were clear that you were to—"
"Once we're able to immobilise Thanos, I will teleport Mantis down so she can put him to sleep, as she says," Dr Strange continued. "It will then be up to all of us to remove the gauntlet from Thanos' hand as soon as possible."
"Thank you, Tony, I really appreciate it," Pepper said. "Between the new SI building going up in India and the new tablets about to be announced, I'm pretty much swamped here. Not to mention all of the requests for assistance from the Stark Relief Foundation that we've been getting lately."
"Well, probably," Ned said with a frown. "I mean, people report on you and your dads' comings and goings all the time, you just don't notice it." He paused as he settled into his seat in the classroom, turning around to glare at Peter. "And anyway, what the hell's with you today? You're usually not this moody so early on, did something happen on the way here or something?"
"Three hours if it's an emergency, Tones," Rhodey said. "Why?"
"Actually, I believe it's due more to my learning processor, sir," said JARVIS. "But yes, I am indeed grateful."
Steve gave a shaky nod, kissing Tony one final time. "Me too, sweetheart. Always."
"Mmm," Tony groaned as Steve's long, deft fingers worked their magic, turning his back and shoulder muscles to jelly. Out of the corner of one eye Tony watched his beloved boyfriend, his features etched in concentration in the faint moonlight streaming in the window, and the pink tip of his tongue poking between his teeth, just like it always did when he sketched.
Tony gave a nod. "Thanks for the coffee."
"It's not mooching if I offer it as a gift," Steve countered. He dipped his head, kissing Tony softly on the lips. "Which is exactly what it is. Now, if I just happened to hope that even with a freshly cleaned house you'll still want to spend your nights with me, then I suppose that might be just a bit selfish on my part, but—"
"Ah, yep," said Clint. "Got me and another agent in about ten seconds flat, then got Selvig before we split."
Steve hesitated a moment before responding. Tony had promised him that he could build him a nanite housing unit that looked exactly like part of his regular uniforms and, true to his word, he had. To any outsider, his new suit appeared to be no different than his usual Captain America uniform.
"We need to do it now!" cried Bucky as he rapidly took out three more war dogs. He shot Steve a concerned glance as he swapped out his ammunition clip. "Стиви, these things aren't slowin' down at all!"
"I know," he said as he pressed his ashes-stained left hand to his chest, right over where Steve's dog tags hung under his shirt. "He always does, and I'm always proud of him."
"Tony, I can't—I shouldn't let the team see me like this, I—"
"Mmm. Yeah, I've heard that about Wakanda," Tony said. "They're about as isolationist as they come. I used to hear Howard grumbling about them every now and then back in the day."
“This entire area is now under our purview, Captain, as you would call it,” says Thor.  “And so it is good, as Young Starkson absolutely insisted on accompanying the team on our return.”  He shoots Tony a rather funny look.  “In fact, he hardly slept at all while we worked.  If you ask me, he is quite the stubborn young lad.”
"Gods, Captain," Tony said, once again reading Steve's thoughts perfectly. "I'm so sorry. That's… well… that's rough."
—gorgeous brown eyes that were radiating such pure love and desire that Steve's heart nearly burst.
"Yeah, he did," Steve said with a smirk. "Said you got lost or something."
"We will?" Tony asked, quirking an eyebrow. "And when do you suppose might that be?"
Weeks without proper food, water, or clothing to protect against the freezing-cold vacuum of space.
"All right. Can this Justin Hammer deliver on those contracts?"
“Good.”  With a sweet kiss to the tip of Steve’s nose, Tony rose from the bed and headed into the bathroom, returning with a warm cloth.  After cleaning the come from Steve’s chest and stomach, Tony tossed the cloth into the clothes hamper and crawled in next to him, curling his gorgeous lithe body around Steve’s.
“Now that’s the voice of a true competitor,” Shostakov says as he slinks back over to his seat next to Batroc.  He whispers something in Russian to Batroc that the Algerian can apparently understand, if his answering chuckle is any indication, leaving Steve so angry that he could swear he could feel steam coming out of his ears.
“Yeah.  Sure, bud.”
"I agree," Steve said softly. In fact, he had mentioned something along those lines to Bucky before they had left for the flower shop, wanting to make sure that Bucky understood the potential risk he was taking. While there hadn't been an ongoing active manhunt for the Winter Soldier ever since the Miami bunker battle, Steve knew that there were still people out there who would love to get their grimy hands on Bucky just as they would Peter, so Steve had urged him to be extra careful. His new military ID was a good start to erasing his former life as a programmed assassin, but there were still plenty of traces of it out there if someone knew where to look.
"Always good to have backups, bud," said Tony.
After returning their trays, Tony and Steve headed out towards the ball field, finding it occupied with a group of cadets who seemed to be having a home run contest of sorts, judging by the sounds of things.
Steve glowered as he looked away, too embarrassed to even meet Tony's eyes even as his entire left side was now throbbing with every beat of his pounding heart.
The thought came zooming out of nowhere, and Tony froze, trying to stuff it back down into the deep recesses of his mind before realising that it was like trying to stuff a piece of popped popcorn back into its kernel.
"Oh my God!" Peter exclaimed as Steve's eyes swept across the horrible burns that covered nearly the entirety of Tony's right side, including his entire arm, over half of his chest, and parts of his neck and cheek. Steve's stomach turned at the sight of Tony's beautiful olive skin burned almost black, with bits of charred flesh and dirt covering most of the worst areas. As he tried to quell his increasing nausea, Steve felt Peter's fingers curl around his left arm, gripping it tightly.
Swiping at his leaky eyes, Steve turns back to his computer, pulling up yet another grant proposal draft.  He’s written so many of the things since he started working at Empire State that he can practically do them in his sleep, which is exactly the kind of busywork that Steve needs while he tries to conjure up a mental picture of what this Mr Tony Stark and his son might look like.
"Whoa!" Peter exclaimed as he landed a few metres away from Steve. "Papa, that was so awesome!"
As much as it hurt to leave him behind, Steve knew it was still the right thing to do, and he knew Tony thought so as well. Peter had already been targeted by their enemies way too many times for Steve and Tony to feel comfortable leaving him unless it was absolutely necessary, and until Steve believed otherwise, it was not absolutely necessary.
Three strokes later and Tony was there, throwing his head back against the pillow as his body arched into Steve, his beautiful face so etched in pleasure that Steve couldn't help but follow him over the edge.  He cried out his trembling climax into Tony’s shoulder, finally collapsing half on top of him as all of his remaining strength seeped from his body.
"Tony and I will discuss it and let you know, Director," Steve said. "Is there anything else?"
Somehow, though, Tony doubted it.
"What do you mean, and what?" said Peter. "That's not it, is it? You're not gonna not see him again because of me, are you?"
how cold his hands and feet always were, and the way the oxygen tubes rubbed the inside of his nose until it was raw, and the tape that made his skin itch where it covered all of his intravenous lines, and the fact that he could barely sit up without feeling dizzy, and—
"Well, yeah," John murmured. "That's definitely more important."
Snapped right out of existence, right before his very eyes.
More tears welled in Peter’s eyes, dripping down onto his pillow.  “So, you're not gonna see him at all this weekend?”
"Yes, Captain, it is already done."
He was cut off by the sudden sound of a weapon powering up, one that Steve instantly recognised as a HYDRA weapon.
"I highly doubt you're gonna find them, Steve," Bruce said carefully. "If these guys are working with HYDRA then they're probably long gone by now. If these are even their real names."
Tony shifted impatiently as he waited for ole Crotchety Phillips to finish blathering on about his various educational and intellectual achievements, fighting against the strong urge to roll his eyes at the utter lack of interest on the faces of the pilots seated in front of him. Only Carol seemed to be even making an attempt at listening, which Tony found particularly funny since thanks to Rhodey, she probably already knew all the stuff that Phillips was telling them.
"Got it," Peter said as the rest of their so-called team took their positions. "I'll be watching."
"Shh, honey," Tony said as he wound his arms around Steve's neck, weaving his fingers into his thick blond hair. Steve hadn't said anything that Tony hadn't screamed into his own void on numerous occasions, but he knew that wasn't what Steve needed to hear at the moment.
“Ahh…” Tony said as he pulled to a stop at a red light.  Knowing Peter, he should’ve suspected it was something like that.
"But he's not missing!" Gwen cried. "Or at least, he doesn't think he's missing." She glanced up at her father, who gave her an encouraging nod. "You see, I found him… right before he got away, and—and I told him that I knew who he was and what he was trying to do, and—"
Steve yelled inside his mind, giving his head a quick shake. It didn't do any good to dwell on the 'what ifs', Sam always said that was like letting the demons win. Thanos had been defeated, Peter and the others had returned from the dead, and Tony was going to make a full recovery. Fighting against the demons left behind would be a lifelong battle, but one that Steve was more than willing to fight if it meant he'd get to keep his family intact.
"Tony,
"None that I've seen, although I haven't ruled out the possibility," said Fury. He held up his hand as someone off-screen handed him a tablet, his brow furrowing into a deep frown as he read. "Well, well, well. It seems like Prince T'Challa has actually accepted my offer to meet with the team. Captain Rogers, how soon can you leave?"
“Yeah, yeah, okay, I get ya,” Obie said, backing towards the door.  “Don't bother the artist while he’s creating and all that.  Howard was the same way, so I’ll leave ya alone…”
"Yeah," Peter said, the smile dropping from his lips as he remembered the so-called discussion he'd had with his father. Based on the texts he'd received since he and Gwen had arrived at the Compound, Dad and Papa were enjoying themselves at their festival, drinking beer and indulging in some of Papa's favourite childhood foods in his old neighbourhood. But Peter had a feeling that as soon as they got home, or maybe even tomorrow, given the fact that they were alone in the penthouse for the first time in months, Dad would revert right back to his same, worried-sick self, complete with wearing a path in the hallways as he tried to come up with even more newfangled ideas to keep his family safe.
"Oh God, it's the Chitauri!" Peter cried as dozens of the bumpy, scaly, whale-like creatures began pouring into the skies above them, each carrying at least thirty of the Chitauri warriors. They were accompanied by what seemed like hundreds of their chariot-like speeders, which began zig-zagging across the sky above the Avengers, almost like they were taunting them.
"Steve, where is he?" Tony cried, revving the boat's engine as high as it would go, attempting to drive it through the ice that now looked to be at least a half a metre thick. He managed to get within about ten metres of where his boys had gone under when a split suddenly appeared and Peter was tossed onto the surface, choking and sputtering and shivering as he slid across the slippery ice, struggling to find a handhold.
"Yeah," Lang said softly. "Um… thanks." He got to his feet, looking so downtrodden and defeated that Tony felt a sharp pang of remorse. While he was still pretty pissed that Lang—and Pym as well—had been arrogant enough to believe that they could break into a Stark home, he could understand Lang's desperation in wanting to see his child that had led to him agreeing to perform yet another criminal act. If Tony had ever found himself in a similar situation with Peter's mother—if she'd ever even bothered to show her face again after he was born—there would've been no lengths that he wouldn't have gone to in order to see Peter again. Even if it had meant having to beg, borrow, or steal, Tony would've done it.
"Yes, yes, I'm sure we all could spend the next several hours trading stories, but that's not exactly why we are here," said Davis. He tapped the tip of his pen against his stack of papers. "Now then, Captain Rogers. You were found and… defrosted, for lack of a better term, approximately four years ago, is that correct?"
on his list knowing they might not get to that point that night, but he was still hoping he’d be presented with the opportunity.
Or rather, he heard him mention the name Stark, and more specifically, "That Stark bastard's goddamn flying suits."
"I was thinking, Peter's summer vacation is coming up in about a month, and since we went to Italy over his break, I was wondering if we could plan a trip to Ireland sometime during the summer? Maybe take him to a couple of the places that we went on our honeymoon?"
Tony moaned, his entire body going rigid as Steve carefully worked him open with his tongue and fingers, all the while caressing every single part of Tony's body that he could reach. "Holy shit, Steve, I think I'm gonna explode that feels so incredible!"
"Coming!" Shuffling his way into the kitchen, Peter found Papa putting a plate of three huge slices of pizza at his place at the table, ruffing Peter's hair as he sat down.
"Why does it matter if—?"
Peter feared it would be the former, and the thought made him sad, even as he could understand Dad's point of view. The trial of Howard Stark had consumed Langara for over three years, during which he was kept locked away from his family and constantly vilified in both the official news and by the vast majority of Langara's citizens. Having no way for Grandpa to refute the stories being told about him, it's no wonder a young child would grow suspicious enough of an absent parent to end up hating them, especially since he and Grandpa hadn't exactly been all that close before he was arrested.
Dad reached for Papa's hand, rubbing his fingers across Papa's knuckles the way he always did when Papa was being extra twitchy. "Now that we know what they're trying we have a bit of an advantage, and we still have the majority of the public opinion on our side too, don't forget that."
Peter's head jerked back in surprise. "Huh? Who told you that?"
"Tony, wait," Steve said as he caught Tony's hands, sucking in a deep, shuddering breath as he shimmied so he was sitting more upright. His mind was a haze of want, and he was so hard, harder than he'd been in a very long time, and could feel that Tony was as well, but…
"All right," Steve said in his Captain's voice. He bent down, giving Tony a quick kiss on the cheek. "Please, be careful."
Didn't Phillips always tell Steve that the clock never lies?  Along with all of the other stuff he always used to tell him, over and over and over again until Steve could recite them all in his sleep?
"So good, baby, you're so good," Tony moaned, hoarse and raw as Steve's thrusts increased in speed, each word accented by a quick pant of breath. "'M getting close!"
“Yep, that’s me,” Peter said as he took his card from Steve’s shaking hand and signed the credit receipt.  He was very much used to people reacting like that when they learned his name, and in his experience, it was best to just ignore it.  “And it was nice to meet you too, Steve.  I’ll definitely be coming back here soon.”
He had just managed to take a true, deep breath and wiped the tears from his eyes when someone knocked on his door.
"Then the summer will be over before you know it, and she'll be back," Tony said as he ruffled Peter's hair. "Don't you always say that the summers go too fast?"
"Copy that," Steve said. He tapped his compass, his heart fluttering as his quantum helmet closed over his head. Then he picked up his shield, gripping it tightly as the rest of the team followed suit.
"Bruce estimated that Hulk generates at least fifty-five million Newtons when he's just throwing out casual punches," Tony said. "So I think we're gonna need more."
But not for himself. Now that Tony remembered, it hadn't been self-sorrow, even as Strange must've known what was going to happen to him.
There were just far too many unknowns. Steve had never liked having to strategise without all of the variables, as it just left behind too many ways that things could go wrong. Battles by their very existence were already barely-controlled chaos, so any sense of control that Steve could add through his strategising would only help keep the chaos to a minimum.
“Yeah, I know,” Steve chokes out.  He’s seen enough severe war wounds to know when one is bad enough to require intervention while still in the field, and his leg is definitely one of those.  Already he can feel the telltale pins-and-needles sensation as the serum goes to work on his injuries, which means they don’t have a lot of time to get his bones back into place before they become fused in their improper position.
Tony huffed as he captured Steve's lips again, his tongue briefly sweeping inside, tangling with Steve's.
, not offensive like Project Insight. It's not gonna be targeting innocent civilians just because we don't happen to agree with their political views or banking habits. The system will react if and only if it detects a threat to our safety, there won't be anything done proactively." He paused as he glanced at Steve, his jaw set tight. "And once they're in place—as long as they work according to my specs, which they will—then there should be no more incidents like that one at the lake, where I had to watch you be encased in ice like freaking Han Solo, and—"
“Yeah.  I think you might be right,” Dad said as he kissed the top of Peter’s head.  “You always were the smart one.”
"Nope," said Tony. "Far as I know he's gone." '
The door opened and Happy poked his head inside. "Ah, Dr Cho says that the surgeon has arrived and is already set up in the operating room, if Captain Rogers is ready."
Peter smiled as he watched Uncle Bucky go, feeling rather proud of himself.
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
"Now, see?" Tony murmured once they were back in bed, curled up together with Steve's head tucked against Tony's chest. "That didn't end up being too horrible, did it?"
And a huge thank-you to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints, and to therollingstonys for the incredible moodboard! 💗
"Oh, yeah," replied Steve, plastering on a smile he had no doubt that Carol could see right through. "Just a bit tired, you know? I was at Ma's all last weekend trying to help her out. Her arthritis has been flaring up a bit again, so I've been trying to fix up some stuff around her house to help make things easier on her."
"Yeah, well, New Asgard is still pretty new, so… now that they have him out there I guess they're trying to get everything done at once," Peter said. "Hopefully it won't be too much longer. Spring break starts next week, so he'll have to come back sometime in the next few days."
"Colonel, the aircraft's released what appears to be a bomb of some kind!" Joseph yelled just as the lock tone sounded in his cockpit. "I'm attempting to take it out!"
"No, Dad, he hasn't," said Peter. "I'm not sure what he's been eating, but he's never tried to skim anything of mine."
"Dad? What's wrong?" Peter asked as he stepped over to him. "What'd I say?"
"Yes, I do," he said just before brushing his lips tentatively across Tony's. Warmth burst across his chest as soon as their lips touched, spreading out to his arms and down his abdomen as he pulled Tony flush against him and kissed him again, his knees nearly buckling when Tony's palms glided up his back to hold him close.
was going to help anything.
Once he had regained his voice, Tony had briefly tried to talk him out of it.  Surprisingly, though, he had been overruled by Sam, who then asked if it would be all right for himself and Sergeant Barnes to accompany Tony as well.  According to Sam, while Bucky was a bit further along in his PTSD recovery than Steve, the fact that he’d lost his arm still caused him a lot of anguish and pain, both physically and mentally.  Being able to look Obie in the eye while he went down would give both Steve and Bucky the type of closure that other soldiers in their shoes could only dream of.
too much of Obie when Tony noticed Strange's eyes flick up, locking onto his.
"Yeah, sometimes," Peter agreed. "But the rest of the time it's still pretty cool."
"This is the Time Stone," he said. "And I am its protector."
"Deployment in five… four… three… two… one… mark!"
"Hmm," said Tony. "How 'bout that." Then he raised his arms, launching every single volt of it directly at Voldemort, letting out a shout of victory when the alien shattered like a dropped piece of crystal.
"I am, Mr Stark," said Gwen. "I promise."
“Well, I found out that he’s the son of Howard Stark, who’s a billionaire living out in California,” Natasha begins.  “Howard’s a weapons manufacturer who apparently supplies a lot of hardware to our military.”
"Yeah, actually, I did," Rogers said. "I… um… well… you just said yourself that you're usually working late, so… I was thinking that maybe if you wanted to that we—you and I could maybe get something to eat together sometime? The officers' mess closes every night before the blackout starts but they always have self-serve food available for the evening and night shift patrol crews so… if you wanted… um… Does that sound like something you'd be interested in, maybe?"
"Yeah, just like one of these days you're actually gonna pay up, right, Buck?" Steve retorted. "I'll see you guys later."
Regardless, Tony was too damn tired to want to think about it at the moment. All he wanted was to get through his work for the day as quickly as possible so he could get to the hospital in time to see Peter before curfew began.
Not when they were so close to finally achieving everything they'd set out to achieve.
"She doesn't think Tony and Bruce should look at it first?" Steve asked.
Hmm," muttered Tony as he studied the tablet. "Seems pretty sparse for such a big base. You thinking it's been abandoned?"
"Mmm," Tony murmured as he brushed his thumb across Steve's knuckles. "You think we could convince him to go to bed at say… seven or so?"
Tony stared at the police officer's hand, his lower lip shaking as he tried to decide what to do. He needed to find Peter ASAP, before HYDRA had a chance to get their hands on him. He was assuming that Peter took off on his own because he thought that it would be easier for a single person to sneak in to wherever they were holding Steve than an entire team, but…
"Copy that!" said Dad as Peter launched one of his splitter webs at Thanos' chest. As soon as it latched, Peter jumped behind him, trying to hold him in place long enough for Dr Strange to get his hand open. Peter jumped as his spider-legs deployed again, helping him keep his footing as Quill suddenly flew in, attaching one of his cool electrical devices to Thanos' other hand.
Tony scoffed, shrugging. "I'm sure you and Rhodey would've found us eventually."
"Everything okay?" he asked as he crawled into the backseat.
He definitely hadn't missed the way Anthony's eyes had looked him up and down, lingering just a second or so too long on his lips. Steve may have been a stranger to intimate relationships, but ever since his serum procedure he had most certainly experienced his fair share of getting checked out.
"Gwen! Peter! Dinner's ready!" he called from the foot of the stairs, the youngest one from the pitch of his voice. "Mom says it's time to come down now!"
"Sure thing," said Carol, shooting Tony a wink before climbing into her cockpit. Tony had always liked Carol. Her absolute devotion to Rhodey—especially through his accident and recovery—had long-ago proved to Tony that she was the real deal. She was an actual human being beneath her Air Corps uniform instead of just another military lackey.
"As you were," Steve ordered as he returned the cadet's salute. "And no, I'm just here to do some research."
"Sometimes exciting isn't all it's cracked up to be though," said Gwen, almost like she'd read Peter's mind. "I mean, I know my dad's not an Avenger, but he still has his fair share of shall we say,
“All Steve’s fault,” Tony says, the corners of his eyes crinkling ever-so-slightly as they flick towards Steve.  “Kid wasn't half as stubborn ‘fore he met you, so—”
"Better?" he softly asked a couple minutes later.
Peeling his eyes open again, Steve leaned forward to brush the messy curls from Peter's forehead, careful to avoid disturbing the white gauze bandage wrapped around his head. In addition to the concussion, broken ribs, and collapsed lung he had suffered, Peter had also cut open the back of his head when he slammed it against the roof, right above where he had suffered a similar injury during the Afghanistan bombing. Dr Cho had informed Steve that the cut wasn't that deep and would likely heal within hours, but given the severity of Peter's concussion she had stitched it up anyway, trying to limit how much she'd have to mess around with his head while he was trying to heal.
Thank the gods for military scientists and their magic formulas, or Steve might've never had the opportunity to become a Langaran test pilot.
“So—” Tony started.
And that, as the poet’s say, was all it took.
Steve nodded, breathing in a long, shaky breath. Tony was absolutely right. It
Even on instances such as this, where after making each other fall apart at least twice, they happened to fall asleep naked and entwined on the couch in Tony's lab, only for Peter to discover them still there in the morning.
"Even more reason to get Project Phoenix up and running, right?" he added. "Make sure nothing like this ever happens again?"
Or, as Natasha would say, like he’s trying to impress Steve.  Which, if it’s true, Steve has to admit he’s rather fond of that particular thought.
"Unless they knew the exact design of the aircraft," Peter finished. He sucked in a deep, rattly breath, begging his bum heart to stay calm. The last thing anyone needed now was for his stupid monitors to start going bonkers again. "Which would be impossible, unless—"
"No, I wouldn't either," Tony muttered. "JARVIS, tell Pepper to get in touch with Human Resources and then call Beck to her office. And it might be a good idea to have Happy there too. Beck seemed a bit… unstable, so he's probably not going to take this news very well."
"I am, sweetheart," Steve had answered, his dimple showing as he smiled, that gorgeous dimple of his that Tony was convinced could end the decades-long war in less than three seconds if flashed to the appropriate people. Tony had been too choked up to say anything further, choosing instead to show his appreciation in other ways, but the drawing had stuck inside his head like glue, burned into his memory as the perfect idyllic end to all of their current madness.
"It's—it's not—" Steve said, breaking off as he sucked in air, his lungs rattling just like they had after he was shot by the Winter Soldier, during the Malibu house bombing. "Tony, you—you're real? You're not just another illusion?"
Ever since he and Natasha discovered the old SHIELD bunker deep beneath the ground at Camp LeHigh, and he realised that the enemy he fought so hard to eliminate from the Earth was not only alive, but
about to accept without some kind of an explanation.
Arriving at the building, Steve swipes his ID card at the electronic lock and opens the door, heading up the three flights of stairs to his office area.  As soon as he steps inside, he’s hit with the strong scent of jasmine, the tea blend that Natasha enjoys with the blini she picks up at the Russian bakery every morning on her way in.  He smiles slightly as he says hello to Lorraine, their administrative assistant, and heads over to his cubicle in the corner, setting his backpack down on the floor next to his chair.
just another mission and no one knew that better than Tony, but he supposed they could pretend for a moment or two longer. He slid his fingers underneath Tony's chin, pressing a gentle, lingering kiss to his lips. "I'll see you soon, okay?"
"Well, it kinda was, when you think about it," Peter said with a shrug. "I mean, Papa's serum still hasn't ever been exactly replicated, and whatever they gave you was—"
"Tony," Steve said with a sigh. "Sweetheart—"
Since Tony wasn't as fond of pancakes as Steve and Peter were, Steve instead made him an omelet, complete with sharp cheddar cheese, green peppers, and tomatoes. Tony had told Steve when they first started dating that the Stark's old butler, Mr Jarvis, had often been responsible for preparing Tony's meals when he was a child, and that omelet had been one of Tony's absolute favourites.
"And serve your country you did, Captain," piped up one of the senators from the back row, a middle-aged man from Montana or Wyoming, Tony couldn't quite recall. "I still have all of my father's Captain America comic books that he left me when he passed. All in mint condition, I might add!"
As the announcer begins to introduce the eight swimmers that comprise the final of the one-hundred metre freestyle, Steve presses down on his swim cap and adjusts his goggles, ensuring they’re sufficiently suctioned to his face.  One of the swimmers in his semi-final heat had the unfortunate luck of having to swim his race with his goggles around his mouth, and while Steve hasn't had that happen to him since he was in junior high, he is taking no chances.
Tony frowned. "A plan that you still refuse to share with me."
"Nat, Thor, there's two of your guys trying to sneak out of the side there, hiding behind the cloud of teargas they've just unleashed," Sam said as Steve scrambled to grab his shield.
As someone who’d never believed that he'd feel comfortable sharing Peter with anyone, now Tony couldn't wait to see the two of them spending time together outside of a hospital setting, where Peter could be his true, boyish self and Steve could finally see him in all of his healthy glory.
Tony looked him straight in the eye.  “If I’m gonna do it right, then yes, I do.”
I can feel you everywhere, in every part of me."
“Ah, yeah, that’s actually a pretty good analogy,” says Tony.  “Just so long as you don't tell him I said so.”
"All right," said Papa, his lips tightly pursed. "If you're sure."
"You are?" Thor said in surprise. "Pardon me, Your Highness, allow me to introduce myself first. I am—"
"You'd better believe it," Natasha said, winking as Wanda set a third pie down onto the rack. "I had to kick your kid out of here a few minutes ago, though. He kept begging to sample everything, all while eating an entire party-sized bag of Doritos."
"Uhh." Tony glanced down at his datapad, smiling at the fact that Peter had designed the blinking dots representing Steve and Carol to look like tiny X-302s.
Tony shrugged, running his tongue across his bottom lip. "Eh, I can understand the guy wanting to be with his kid. And that feeling of being trapped into something that you're damn good at even if you know it's not quite right… you know, I've been there, done that."
"I know that, Dad, and that's exactly why I wanna do it too." Peter's eyebrows knitted together as his huge brown eyes filled with tears. "I just… I
“Oh my God, you guys!” Peter said, throwing up his hands in fond exasperation.  “You’ve been married for over a year already, why’re you still acting like newlyweds?”
"Ancient?" Steve exclaimed. "I'm already ninety-four! If he thinks twenty-five is ancient then what does he think of me?"
"Dad, it's no use!" Peter said, his croaky, raspy voice like fingernails on a chalkboard on Tony's already frazzled nerves. "Dr Strange said he won't do it!"
And the very first person Papa had asked to add on as an additional flight instructor was Uncle James, the man who had saved his life during the Phoenix mission dogfight.
"Eh, I'm not too worried about that," said Dad. "Long as this guy comes home in one piece then I'll be okay." He brushed the hair from Peter's forehead. "Then we'll get you taken care of and we can all go home, hmm? Doesn't that sound good?"
"Yeah, well, that was a long time ago, and during wartime, I might add," Uncle James said. "Wartime tends to… speed certain things along."
Steve made a choked-off noise in the back of his throat, tight with the tears he was trying—and failing—to contain. "No, Tony, you know that's not true.
And he was so goddamn
"Don't look at me, you're the expert on all this stuff," Phillips said. "If your artificial smart-talking thing-a-ma-jig says that they're ready, then I've got no choice but to trust you."
"Peter!" Steve cried as he patted Peter's pale, clammy cheek. "No, no, no, little guy, don't do this to me again, I can't—!" He pressed his ear to Peter's chest, nearly collapsing in relief when he heard the sound of his heartbeat and air moving through his lungs.
lately, and the bright, sun-shiny weather he could see through his window didn't help. It had been so long since he'd been able to play outside—or even go outside at all—that he'd pretty much forgotten what it was like.
And right there, standing directly next to Hank Pym himself, was Justin Hammer.
The boy scowled. "It was in Social Studies, Dad, a section on bullying and how to stand up for yourself. We watched a video."
Once inside the prison—which was as dark and dank on the inside as it had been on the outside—Peter clung to the wall, breathing in deep breaths as he scanned his immediate area, his ears picking up the sound of a vicious fight just out of his line of sight. He seemed to be near the ceiling of a massive room, almost as huge as a hockey arena and with the fighting noises off to his left, one of whom sounded an awful lot like—
He was cut off by Steve's fingers on his lips. "I don't need to think, Tony," he said in his Captain's voice. "Because it's an absolute fact, and that's all there is to it."
"Are we sure it's not a big deal?" asked Papa. "This is what, the third time in a month now?"
Grandma flinched, her lips curling into a sneer. "His name is Matthew O'Brien."
Steve had only known Peter for a matter of days, and already felt almost more protective of him than he did of his own ma. He couldn't imagine how much worse it must be for Anthony.
"No, thanks," muttered Steve. "I think I'll just… go and get cleaned up." It was only about an hour until dinnertime so too late for him to sneak away to visit Peter, and if he took a long enough shower and then went over his briefing materials for the new aircraft one more time, he would hopefully be calmed down enough to eat.
"Uh huh," Peter said sadly. He turned to Gwen, trying to smile. "See you tomorrow?"
"I won't, little guy. I promise."
And it was working. Uncle Sam's broken seatbelts aside, so far all of Peter's mishaps had happened in the privacy of his own home, and not on a crowded street surrounded by people.
"I would not call what we did fighting against him," piped up the Mr Clean-looking dude from a few metres away.
A low growl escaped Steve's throat as he dipped his head to kiss Tony again, deliberately keeping it chaste even though his entire body was screaming at him to take it further. "You are incorrigible, you know."
"Yeah, yeah, I know." Tony swiped at his leaky eyes, sniffing. "Honey, I know you don't really wanna talk about this, but we need—we need to tell Pete something. Sam told me that he's starting to get pretty upset, and I don't—he was already starting to look bad before you left, and I—"
"I think that's a great idea," said Peter, placing three cartons of each in their shopping cart. "Is that what you're gonna want for dessert then?"
“You're damn right it’s gonna,” said Bucky.  “Good thing Sam said to leave my arm back in the apartment, or I might’ve been tempted to beat the hell outta this guy with it.”
"You shouldn't have to," added Tony. "But… I appreciate it anyway."
"I won't be," Steve cut in. "Not till—" He broke off, cradling Peter's hand between his own. "I can't—I can't leave him, Nat. Not while… he's like this. I just—I need to be here when he wakes up."
Instead, it seemed to be aiming downwards, directly at Earth. And, more specifically, right at the Compound.
"Ah, make a note to remind Pete and me to ask Lang about the whole giant-wannabe thing, will ya? Once this is all over?"
Steve had just become too attached to Peter to try and distance himself from him now. And, if he was reading the flight patterns correctly, it seemed as though Peter had grown pretty attached to him as well.
Hill frowned, her hand on her hip. "And what information is that, exactly?"
Peter's lips pursed at the mention of his father, and he slumped back against his pillows, carefully crossing his arms.
"Yeah, babe, just relieved." He turned the glasses case over in his hand. "If it hadn't've worked, and Pete would've had to see Bucky… well… let's just say that I'm
"When, later?" asked Steve.
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
"We're at forty percent," Howard said, his eyes glued on the dials in front of him. "Fifty… sixty… seventy… that's eighty percent…"
"Um… I'm sorry if this sounds kinda harsh, but… don't you think that should be Uncle Sam's choice?" Peter asked. "I mean, did you ask him how he feels?"
"Tony," Papa said reproachfully, even as he reached over to pat Dad's knee.
"Connects directly with the user's hippocampus," Tony said under his breath. "Yeah, I'm not sure I'm too thrilled with this one either. JARVIS?"
"Sure thing."
"So you're saying those Chitauri bastards were using this Mind Stone to control him?" asked Clint. Clint's jaw was tight and his fists clenched, no doubt remembering the horror he went through while under Loki's influence.
And Steve was as well, now that he thought about it.
, so—I'm gonna make sure that we don't have to. Pete—he's already been through so much shit, and he's only a
"Papa! I'm here!" Steve suddenly heard from his left, his eyes widening in shock as Peter landed next to him and grabbed onto his left hand before Steve could protest, gripping it so tightly that Steve couldn't have shaken him loose if he'd tried.
"Ready for the most intense, most difficult battle of your lives?" said Dr Strange. "Because make no mistake, this battle we are about to enter will be just that. I have seen firsthand what can happen when certain powerful beings ignore the dangers that come with meddling with different dimensions. Or universes."
"Whoa," Gwen said with wide eyes. "Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with you there. But… I guess if you can afford it, then…?"
"Babe?" Tony said, tugging on Steve's arm. "You okay?"
"I bet Dad's thinking the exact same thing right about now," Peter said softly. "But you don't have anything to worry about, if that's what you're thinking."
"Sure, thanks." The mint felt cool on Steve's tongue as he pushed himself up to his feet, giving him a slight burst of energy as he gathered up his cowl and shield. The five of them exited the jet to find Agent Maria Hill waiting for them, along with two men that Steve recognised from the SHIELD base up at the Compound.
They were quiet for a few minutes, sipping at their floats as they watched the various people coming in and out of the café. Peter could tell that something else was bothering Papa, but he didn't want to push him too much. Papa would tell him when he was ready.
Something is definitely going on up there…
"Oh, holy
. Wanted it burned away from his memory, turned to ash so he never had to deal with it again.
"I love you too," Tony blurted out, his teeth catching hard on his bottom lip as he watched about a thousand reactions cross Steve's beautiful face in about three seconds. "Just—just in case you were wondering. And I've—I've never said that to anyone except my son, so—"
“Well,” Tony said, waggling his eyebrows as Steve cuddled closer.  “Hey there, hot stuff.”
"Nah, I've got some snacks in my backpack, so I should be fine once it gets here," Peter said as he headed into the smaller of the two bedrooms. "Whoa! I've got an awesome view of the mountains in here!"
"That's what I first thought as well," said Hill. "But we've gone over the evidence three times already, and it still points in the same direction. The fact that the king was touring the hospital was not public knowledge, so it's entirely possible that the people behind this truly didn't know he was here."
“What?  He—he
“Copy that!” Steve says.  He tosses Tony a quick nod as he starts the motorcycle, gripping the handles.  “Let’s go!”
"Don't you even say another word, Steve," James ordered. "Just get the mission done. That's an order!"
"Sounds good," Steve said, ruffling Peter's hair. He ducked down as Peter dropped his head again, tilting his chin up to look at him. "Peter, you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Absolutely nothing."
"Long as he doesn't try and take your share," said Tony.
"Um… um…" he stuttered, giving his head a quick shake. Even with Tony gone, he was still Captain America, still the leader of the Avengers.
"You know, it is so not fair that you have not one, but
But Gwen only shook her head, gripping his hands. "Peter, I'm sure your dads already know exactly what to do, so—"
Peter gave a nod, trying to not look too impatient. Now that he had his permission all he wanted to do was get started.
"I'm ready," Tony pleaded as Steve pulled his fingers out, only to re-slick them and press them in again, curling them so he could brush across the magic spot that made Tony cry out. "Oh,
"No, no, that's why
"You're scowling," answered Gwen. She handed Peter a set of silverware, the slight brush of her fingers against his sending another shock of warmth shooting up his arm. "You almost look like you're in pain or something. You didn't get hurt in gym class, did you? 'Cause I did some reading about the recovery period from mono, and the book I read said that one of the possible complications from it is an enlarged spleen, and that you're supposed to avoid any contact sports until it can be ruled out, so I'm actually really surprised that your dads are even letting you go to gym class, 'cause if it's enlarged the risk is pretty high of it rupturing if you get hit in the abdomen, and I'm pretty sure that would freak everyone out if it happened at school. Not to mention that it'd probably be really painful, too."
"All right gentlemen, we're getting a bit closer to the re-entry point now," Tony said, his slightly raspy voice in Steve's ear sending warm shivers down his spine as he guided his imaginary spacecraft through its orbit. After three full weeks of rehearsing launches and entering and maintaining planetary orbits, Tony had decided that he and Bucky were ready to start learning how to re-enter the planet's atmosphere and land.
"Uhh, I'm pretty sure I'm still stuck somewhere in
"Oh, hell yeah. You know I just love when your ears turn that lovely shade of bright pink," Bucky replied through a mouthful of bread. He waggled his eyebrows, chuckling as Steve spread a generous amount of butter across a roll. "Besides, what's the big deal? Not like anyone's gonna look at you and want to mess with you anyway."
“Sokovia?” Peter said, his head snapping back in surprise.  “JARVIS, does this say these bullets were sent to Sokovia?”
"Hey, kiddo, you doing okay? No, wait, don't answer that," he added before Peter could even open his mouth. "Sorry. Stupid question."
As soon as Gwen exited the room, Steve let out a sigh and glanced down at Tony, nearly jumping out of his chair when saw that Tony was awake, his sleep-dulled brown eyes staring straight up at him.
"I know," said Steve. "But I still think we can do it."
"And thank you, Тони," Bucky added. He got to his feet, holding Tony's gaze. "Стив is lucky to have you. For a long time, he never—he never thought that he'd—that he'd be able to have a family. You know… because—"
“There!” he said as he pulled up a freshly decrypted page, which just happened to be some kind of generic-looking shipping manifest.  He quickly skimmed it over, noting that it appeared to reference several separate shipments, all of which were being sent to—
"Keeping Thanos away from that stone should be our only concern," said Steve.
Tony scoffed. "Yeah, we'll see."
As much as he hated to admit it, if the bolt of electricity that shot up his arm when Steve shook his hand the night before was any indication, Tony was already starting to fall for the tall, blond-haired, gorgeous-as-hell pilot.
"Well, that is indeed good news," said Thor. He retook his seat at the head of the long conference table, around which already sat the rest of their team. Including James, who had apparently just flown in from D.C.
Almost instantly Steve's face twisted into an expression of such anguish that tears welled in Tony's eyes. "Honey—"
Maybe hope really was still stronger than fear.
Gasping and choking, Peter could only watch as the monster stepped forward and planted his massive foot directly on top of his chest, leaning down with such an evil look in his eyes that Peter's heart skittered.
"So," he said in a loud whisper. "That dude in the red suit who keeps trying to give me orders, that's your dad?"
"Dad?" Peter asked. "You okay?"
"And don't forget that you'll be gone too for a while," Gwen added. "So I think it'll go faster than we think."
"Yeah, it was fun. How was New Year's Eve in New York?"
"All right, give me a sec," Tony said as he slid off of Peter's bed and over to the table in the corner by the windows. "Go ahead and put her through over here."
"Mmm, that's right," Steve murmured. He paused his ministrations, locking eyes with his husband—his
“Tony, you can do it,” Steve cuts in.  “I know it.”
"Tony—!"
?" he asked, almost afraid of the answer. It wasn't as though Steve hadn't ever done just that, and on more than one occasion.
After double-checking the locks on the front door and getting a refill on his coffee, Tony pads down the hall to his bedroom and boots up his computer.  But instead of immediately going to work on his program, he double-clicks on YouTube, his fingers hovering over the keyboard as he tries to convince himself that what he’s about to do isn’t akin to stalking or something.
"JARVIS says at least a day, but based on how big this place is and what they might've been doing here, I'm gonna venture that it might take even longer than that."
"Gods, I love you," Tony rushed out. "How'd I get so damn lucky?"
Bucky yelled as the Mets batter swung and missed a pitch that he'd had absolutely no business swinging at. "Now that was just goddamn ridiculous, is what that was!"
"I love you so much," Steve whispered, his lips trailing along the slightly puckered skin over Tony's repaired sternum as Tony's hands fisted into his hair. "You have such a big heart, mo grá, the biggest of any of us, and I'm so lucky that you let me inside. Ni féidir liom maireachtáil gan tú."
Steve's cracked lips stretched into a tired smile. "Yeah, I did. Does that mean you like it, then?"
"He never officially retired or was discharged, so in my opinion he's still a member of the Army," Uncle James said. "He was just missing in action until SHIELD found him in the ice."
"That would be helpful," said Steve. "Even if his memories were tampered with, there still might be something there that could be useful."
The medic's eyebrows shot up as he swabbed Peter's arm with an alcohol pad while the second medic prepped an IV kit. Tony immediately reached for his son's hand; Peter absolutely
"Now, Птер!" Bucky exclaimed. "You need to do it now!"
"Spare the son of Stark, and you will give me the stone," he said. "No tricks, wizard."
"It's okay, buddy, it's okay now," Tony said as he climbed into the bed, smoothing Peter's sweaty hair from his forehead as his eyes fluttered open, wet with tears. "You're safe."
But, Peter was managing. They were all managing, because they all had each other to lean on. Along with his arm-wrestling sessions, Peter was also accompanying Papa on most of his morning runs—sometimes with Uncle Sam as well—and joining him in the exercise room at the base, where he and Peter would spend hours driving their gloved fists into a hanging canvas bag filled with sand. Besides helping Peter discover the limits of his strength and endurance, it was just a lot of fun to be able to be out and about again.
"We shall." Peter had to fight against the strong urge to offer Gwen his arm as they headed down the hallway, like Papa always did for Dad whenever they were out and about, especially in the winter when the sidewalks were icy. He would definitely have to remember to do that if he and Gwen were ever able to go out on a real date.
As soon as they stepped out of Peter's room Steve took Tony's hand, leading him down the hall to their bedroom. Tony had designed the spacious room like a loft, with a large sitting area furnished with the same kind of comfy, squashy furniture they had in their Tower penthouse and Compound apartment. There was also a section over by the corner windows set up like a small art studio for Steve, with the bed and bedside tables situated about two-thirds of a level above, up a small flight of stairs and overlooking the rest of the room.
“You’ve gotta take Tony first,” Steve says.  “He’s—he needs—”
"Steve, honey, you're talking like this is already a done deal," Dad said gently. "And I know that committee meeting and what we saw down in D.C. isn't helping anything, but we've gotta remember that not everyone is buying into this stuff. If they were, they wouldn't've needed to hide it under a literal mountain of political rhetoric, so maybe we should just cool our heels until we know something more definite."
"Tell them my dad will buy the tickets," Peter said. He'd offer to drive the three of them as well, but knowing his dads, they'd probably say no.
"It's from Colonel Phillips," answered Steve. "Apparently his men finally located Hank Pym."
caused them both to jump, with Wanda clapping her hands over her ears. "I can't. I just… I'm sorry, but I can't," she murmured, shaking her head. "If they catch me helping someone again then they'll hurt my brother, and I can't let that happen. He's already been through so much trying to protect me. My father—my father made him promise that he would, before—"
Steve exclaimed, so loudly that the cadet up in the front of the room shot to her feet, standing at attention.
The RT's eyes were wide as she tucked her pencil into the pocket of her scrubs. "
"He's that rich doctor that drove his car off a mountain a few months ago," said Peter. "The neurosurgeon?" He didn't add that Dad had disliked Dr Strange ever since he and Papa had tried to get him to consult on Peter during his weeks-long coma after the battle in the Miami bunker, and that the surgeon had flat-out refused because he'd said that he didn't work on children.
There was a pause as Steve's words filtered through everyone's minds. There was no longer any doubt about it. He had just outlined the steps of a full-on coup.
He then moved down to Tony's abdomen, dipping his tongue into Tony's navel before following the dark line of hair down to his erection, giving him a few teasing licks as he lubed up his index finger and gently pressed it inside him.
“Huh?” Tony says as his head whips back up.  “No, no, I’m just… how tall are you again?”
Except the anticipation of seeing the Starks again, which since around three o’clock has pretty much been all-consuming.
"Okay, so, I designed it to work with twelve satellites," Peter began. "But we really only need eight to cover the planet. I figured the other four could be backups just in case something went wrong."
It still didn't make any sense, though. Dr Strange had been so emphatic back on the ship that he would rather allow Peter or Dad to die than give up the Time Stone to Thanos that he and Dad had almost come to blows, so for him to change his mind so suddenly in the heat of the moment only 'cause Dad happened to beg him to was just plain weird.
"If not tomorrow then definitely the next day, okay little guy?" Papa finally said. "We just want to make sure that Dad and Uncle Bruce have enough time to figure out where the glitch came from."
The colour of his hair, the very same vibrant brown as Peter’s, with only slightly better tamed curls.  The lushness of his full, pink lips, and the way they curled up at the corners, like he was in a constant state of mild amusement.
In fact, he tried so hard to
"I hate to say it, but part of it comes with being a parent, babe," Tony said gently. "You should've seen me the day I brought Pete home from the hospital. I'd had the entire house deep-cleaned from top to bottom three separate times, had all the video monitors installed, had plenty of diapers and formula and baby clothes and everything else on hand, and then as soon as we stepped through the door, like literally as soon as I set foot inside the house, I completely panicked. Like, Rhodey had to talk me down from the ceiling type of panic. I hadn't been home the entire time Pete was in the hospital, and as he got better his nurses had let me do as much of his care as possible, so I knew exactly what I needed to do for him. But it was like as soon as we were home, I just felt completely helpless. Nothing had changed except our location, but I still felt like I didn't have a clue on what to do with him. And he was just sitting there in his car seat, looking up at me with those huge brown doe eyes of his, and I was just frozen. I could not move."
“Now, now, you don't need to be giving me any attitude, Tony, I’m in a good mood here,” Obie said.  Tony gritted his teeth at the fake-hurt in Obie’s voice.  He’d always hated all that manipulative bullshit.
"Yeah, no kidding," Bucky piped up from the passenger seat. "Hey, Sam? How come you didn't get me a nice big house on a lake, hmm?"
Pete," Tony insisted. "And that's all we're gonna say about that."
"Good God, man," Dad pleaded, his throat bobbing as he swallowed. "Please, don't hurt the kid!"
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
"Well, all right then," Gwen said after a pause just long enough to be awkward. She cleared her throat, squeezing his shoulders slightly before stepping back. "Shall we?"
Nodding, Steve laid his head back down, sliding his leg across Tony's lap as Tony kissed the top of his head.
"It appears that we are, sir," JARVIS answered. "I am detecting no anomalies with either the nanite design or their structure."
Bruce blinked, shaking his head. "Okay, but none of this is based on some TV show, this is actually based in reality. Well, at least some kind of reality." He took off his glasses, pinching the bridge of his nose. "After I landed inside Dr Strange's sanctum and told him and Wong what had happened on Thanos' ship, they explained a bit about the stones and the sanctum itself. And apparently, the person, or wizard, I guess, who'd been in charge of the place before Dr Strange got there had had some experience with travelling between universes."
Well, Steve always had always had a bit of a flair for the dramatic. And caring for Steve afterwards did manage to snap Tony out of his crushing, grief-induced fog.
"Yeah, they have," said Bucky. "But still… he's a lucky guy."
“Tony,” Steve says gently.  “This isn't your fault.”
"I am too, Ma," Steve said, his voice a bit on the raspy side. "I am too."
The kind that used to seep through the thin walls of his ma's house during the bitter Brooklyn winters, burrowing through multiple layers of clothing to settle deep into his bones. The kind that made his shoulders turn in and his teeth clench.
"No, I am not," Steve said firmly. "But what I am thinking about is that I need you to tell me exactly what's going on here, and I need you to tell me right now." He stepped back, raking his fingers through his mussed-up hair. "Tony… it is so hard for me to see you like this, to see you so stressed out, and always beating yourself up for everything that's happened, and things that haven't even happened… and not know how to help you. And you say that I can read you mind, and yes, I think I sometimes can because I know you so well and I love you so much, but Tony, I can't—I can't read this. And if I can't read things, then I can't remember them, and—and if I can't remember them, that means—"
"Good," Steve stated. "That's how it should be."
And if they didn't, well… he supposed he would just have to do this all day.
"Who then introduced me to the SHIELD science liaison to the Langaran military," Howard said firmly. "Who then proceeded to hire me to assist in the design and creation of the very aircraft that we currently have defending our skies."
them, and I don't think—I
Once all the food was gone and the dishes piled into the dishwashers, the team headed into the airy common living room to watch football and play chess, which eventually morphed into a massive game of Twister that soon had Steve clutching his sides at its hilarity. Peter was so flexible that he could pretty much bend in any direction, not to mention his ability to stick to any surface, while Clint had everyone else laughing so hard that he made it impossible for them to hold their positions. Eventually he, Natasha, and Bucky all collapsed into a giant heap of limbs, allowing Peter to emerge victorious once again.
Peter shook his head as he took his seat, tugging his hoodie sleeves down over his cold hands. "I'm just tired, Ned, sorry. It was kind of a busy day at my house yesterday."
Not really the best time to be discussing anything.
attempt to enter any Avengers facility without the express, face-to-face verbal permission of either Steve or myself. Is that clear?"
that I'm leaving you to fight this alone! Thor can take Peter, but I'm staying right here and that is it!"
"Nope," Tony stated. "You've officially used up all your buts. No more until you've been disconnected from all of this stuff and had something to eat, yeah?"
"Wasn't it obvious?" he rasped as he settled into the cradle of Tony's legs, sliding his t-shirt up his abdomen. "I wanna see you now."
But Peter didn't even let her finish. "Okay, so for school this year I had to read this book called
Papa smiled, showing off the dimple that drove Dad mad. "Anytime, little guy."
The recurring nightmares about drowning and being trapped in ice had been bad enough, but
"This will unlock the cell," she said, touching the device to the window. Peter couldn't help but let out an amazed, "Whoa!" as the not-glass immediately began to dissolve right in front of him, creating a hole just large enough for him to get through.
"I'm sure they won't mind waiting till the drones are done upgrading, especially if it cuts down on the search radius." Bruce paused, giving Tony a sympathetic look. "Steve's pretty tough, Tony, so you know he's not gonna go down without a fight. And he knows we'd never give up on him either, 'cause there's no way in hell he'd give up on any of us."
"Oh God!" Steve gasped as he hurried over to his son, falling to his knees beside him and brushing the matted curls off his forehead. Peter's skin was cold, far too cold for such a burning hot room, and his skin was as pale a blank canvas.
"Okay, but I still don't—
But it
"A lot of things have changed since then, sweetheart," said Steve. The twirled the ring encircling Tony's finger. "Haven't they?"
It hurts so damn much! It just doesn't seem real, like I'm in some neverending nightmare. I mean, I walk into the living room, and I keep expecting to see him there, reading a book or watching a movie. But he's never there! Or I go into his room, and it looks exactly like he left it, with his Legos scattered across the table and his Norse mythology books open on his bed, like he's gonna be home soon. But he's not! He's never coming home again, and I just—I just can't accept that, Nat! I just can't!"
"Dad—"
“Uh huh!  I’ll be right there!” Peter called back, grimacing as his stomach growled.  He patted the top of the book set as he headed into his bathroom to wash his hands, his mind drifting back to Steve.
played in the background, but it still wasn't the same.
Steve breathed in, his eyes glassy as he nodded. "I promise. As long as you promise me that you'll try to get some sleep while I'm gone."
"I sure will."
"Yes, it is Oxford, but that doesn't change the fact that it's thousands of miles away," he said.
—had begun.
And Tony wasn't upset with Peter for saving Stacy. It was absolutely the right thing to do, and in Peter's shoes both he and Steve would have done the same, but that didn't mean he wasn't terrified of the possible implications of it. Concussions often messed with a person's memories, so there was a slight chance that Stacy might not even remember exactly how Peter managed to save him. But if he did…
"Does stuff like that happen a lot at Stark Industries?" he asked. "Pepper seemed pretty concerned."
"Ah, yeah," Peter said after a short pause. He honestly had no idea even what day it was, only that he was due back at school soon. "Yeah, I'll be there."
"So, is this actually it, then?" Steve asked, his heart quickening as he watched Alt-Steve and his team rally behind Thor, invigorated by his arrival.
"I didn't do anything. I just—I just—" Steve attempted to take a step, halting when he felt a hand curl around his arm, gently tugging him back as Bucky was loaded into the emergency vehicle, with Sam climbing in behind him. "I didn't do anything… I just—I couldn't—"
"Yeah, I'm okay!" answered Peter, watching in shock as a blue-skinned android jumped out of the wrecked ship, pulling two arm-length knives from her belt.
I'm Spider-Man, damnit! I can do amazing things that no one else can do, and I could prove it to them if they'd only let me!"
up to the challenge.
"You just need to check in," said Natasha. "And actually, so do I. See ya in a few."
"Pardon me, Master Peter, but Miss Stacy is on the line again," JARVIS said gently. "And she sounds quite upset."
"No, I'm lucky you love me," Steve answered. He wove his fingers through Tony's soft hair, his jaw tightening as he tried to keep his tears contained. He had no business waking Tony, not after how hard he had fought to get him to sleep in the first place. After an almost three-day stint where he had barely come out of his lab, not even swapping out Tony's coffee for decaf had been enough to get him to stop, finally forcing Steve to have to resort to begging him to take a break. Steve absolutely
Grabbing his leather jacket, sketchbook, and pencil from his locker, Steve headed out the door towards the parking lot. About twenty minutes later he was at the lake and resting on the bank, looking out at the sunbeams bouncing off of the lightly rippling water as his mind conjured up a picture of him and Peter sitting in a fishing boat while he taught Peter how to fish, something Steve had always wished he'd been able to do with his own father. Bucky's father had taken him and Bucky out fishing a few times when they were little, as often as Steve could stand to be outside with his sick lungs, at least, but it still wasn't quite the same.
“That is correct, sir,” JARVIS answered.  “I have direct visual confirmation.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"If not tomorrow then definitely the next day," Steve said as he arranged Peter's blankets. "I promise."
"Copy, Captain. I am ready," answered Pietro.
"Yes," Wanda said with a sigh. "And now I think Pietro's starting to learn them too."
"What? What's it say?" Steve asked.
"Understood, sir."
"Um… I guess? I dunno, though. What exactly counts as a date?"
It was such a cliché, and Tony usually hated clichés. Especially when it came to parenting.
And both times were before his parents died and Peter came along.
"It is," agreed Steve. "And it was—it was—" He huffed out a sharp breath, shaking his head. "It was like it was happening in the here and now, but still in 1944. At the same time."
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yeah? What's he want now?"
“Shh, honey,” Tony whispered as he dipped his head for another sloppy kiss.  “You’ve got me, yeah?  I’m right here.”
“I agree.”  With how busy the three of them had been in the last few months, at work and at school, it really was the perfect time for their inaugural trip to their new upstate home.  Stark Industries had expanded rapidly in the last year, forcing Tony to start converting some of the old warehouses that used to house weapons into laboratories, office space, and condos.  And one of those condos, located at the very top of one of the newly renovated buildings, Tony had developed into a second home for the three of them, presenting its floor plan and deed to Steve as a gift for their first wedding anniversary.
"Mmm, I hope so," mumbled Peter. "'Cause it looks pretty awful."
Steve curled his arm around Peter's shoulders, planting a kiss on the top of his head as Tony came into the panic room and sat down on Peter's opposite side, his tired eyes radiating his own nervousness. He had been up for most of the night, checking and double-checking and calibrating and adjusting everything at least a thousand times, trying to make sure that he had thought of every single possible permutation. Steve had attempted to go to bed without him, still wiped out from their whirlwind trip up to the Compound, but after tossing and turning for over three hours he had just given up and made some food for them instead, finally convincing Tony to rest with him on the couch for an hour or so before Peter woke up.
"Nat?" called Bruce. "Ah, is that a good thing?"
Nature's best pain reliever, indeed.
"We'll have the Quinjet on standby, so as soon as the signal's received Bruce, Bucky, and I can be on our way," said Sam.
"And you've found a spot where I can work on the containment vessel?" asked Tony. "'Cause it's not gonna be needed at all if we're only doing a weapons system, which means people are gonna wonder what the hell I'm doing if they see me building it."
"Still? Isn't it already twice as long as it needs to be?" Uncle Bucky asked. "What more're you adding?"
"And after this Johann Schmidt went on a murderous rampage trying to take down the Meridian government and ended up destroying millions of credits worth of tech and equipment, both sides secretly came to the agreement that there would be no more pursuit of any super-soldiers, and that all remaining doses of the serum had to be destroyed. We've uncovered some video evidence that verifies this."
Peter's shiny new dress shoes clacked against the polished wood floor as he arrived at the closed door of the guest room, pressing his ear up against it. Just as he'd suspected, he could hear Papa's steady footsteps pacing back and forth, his thumbs probably hooked on the belt loops of his perfectly-pressed uniform pants. Peter had noticed that whenever Papa was on his feet, he either had his fingers bracketing his belt buckle, his hands on his hips like he was about to chastise someone—usually accompanied by what Dad liked to call his worry wrinkle—or he was leaning against the wall or door frame with either his arms crossed in front of him or his hands stuffed into his front pockets, a pose that Dad lovingly referred to as "the papa pose".
And while Steve sometimes envied Tony's ability to compartmentalise everything so well, as soon as he remembered exactly
"I'm sure I will, little guy," said Steve. He reached for his own cup of hot cocoa, giving Tony a wink across the top of it. "Are you ready for the fireworks?"
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button, and leave me a comment if you like!  😊
"Yes, but suspicions still aren't the same as proof, sweetheart."
Steve's back was ramrod straight, his shoulders perfectly level as he arrived outside of General O'Brien's deep mahogany office door, the placard tacked to the front embossed in pure gold. Steve had been to the general's office a few times over the course of his Air Corps career, mainly for commendations on his performances during particularly difficult patrols, but this trip felt different. How could he have not noticed the vast differences between even his rather ordinary barracks building and the positively grand Headquarters building that housed all of the main government leaders? How could he have not noticed that in all of his years of service, Steve had never seen any of the ten or so men who ran their country's government actually anywhere near a field of battle?
After quieting the crowd, the announcer calls, “Set”.  Steve’s heart leaps into his throat as he bends down to grip the block and immediately hisses in pain.  He hasn’t practised starts in several weeks because they’ve become so hard on his shoulder, but this is a lot worse than he thought it would be.
Bucky smiled as he leaned back against the bench. "That's better," he said, patting the brand-new sniper rifle that Tony had recently finished building for him. "So, what's the plan?"
"Yeah, but you just said it yourself!" exclaimed Sam. "We're talking hitherto undreamt of destruction here!"
Bucky's eyes went wide and he raised his hands, slowly backing away. "Okay, okay, Stevie, no need to be so touchy about it."
"And what I also know," she continued. "Is that the sins of a father should never be passed along to his son." She glanced up at Steve, her eyes softening slightly. "And I also know that I've never seen my son so happy in his entire life, which he assures me is mainly the doing of both yourself and a certain young man with whom I'll be shortly making my acquaintance."
"All right," said Bucky. "Then I guess I'll see him once he wakes up."
"You got it, honey." Tony sucked in a deep breath as the ramp whirred open to reveal King T'Challa standing about five metres away from the jet. He was surrounded by six tall, bald women dressed in red armour and carrying spears, behind which stood a line of taller, broad-shouldered men bearing golden chest plates, their spears tipped with slightly broader points.
" Steve rasped as Tony broke away from his lips to trail kisses down his cheek to his jaw, settling in on his pulse point. He sucked a small mark there, pulling back to glance at it before it disappeared.
"Okay," Peter said again, feeling very much like one of Papa's old records that had gotten stuck. "Um—"
potential until you try to tell him that it's time to come back into the house."
Tony's smile grew even wider. "Ah, his name's Steve. And I've gotta tell you, Pete, he's just about the hottest guy that I've ever seen."
"Duly noted, Sam," said Steve. "Let's everyone else buckle up, all right?"
He had just managed to find a hallway that appeared to lead towards the garage when he heard a rather gruff male voice coming from the slightly open door of a nearby room. Peter decided that it was likely Liz's father's office or something, and was just about to continue on his way when he suddenly heard the man mention his name.
A loud
"Really?" Peter exclaimed, his eyebrows shooting up so high that they disappeared under his hair. "Oh, that'd be awesome, Papa! I'll go pack up my stuff!"
And once Peter came along, even though his discovery was one of the biggest shocks Tony had ever experienced in his life, he swore that he would never, ever neglect his own child.
gonna do is fire off a quick response telling them that I've already started the re-vetting process, and then take another look at these numbers in the morning. And if it turns out that stuff has actually gone missing, then I suppose I'll have to see how the Armed Forces Committee wants to go about looking for it."
"Um, you might wanna rethink that there, hon," Tony murmured as he slid his hand down to palm Steve's crotch, pulling a choked gasp from Steve's throat. Steve let out a growl as he captured Tony's mouth again, nipping at his plush bottom lip as Tony tapped his ass, urging him to climb onto his armoured feet.
"Not like I've never heard it before," Peter mumbled, only loud enough for Papa to hear. Papa raised an eyebrow, but thankfully didn't say anything. He knew probably better than anyone how stressed out Dad was lately, trying to organise the various convoys transporting HYDRA remnants to the SHIELD storage facility in Maryland before Congress returned to the Capitol towards the end of the month. Dad really wanted to be able to tell the Armed Forces Committee that the cleanup in D.C. was complete, leaving only the rest of the New York City mess to deal with.
Finally in a semi-upright position, Steve ran his tongue across his dry and cracked lips and tipped his head back against the cement-block wall, trying to keep his thoughts from wandering to Tony and Peter and managing to think of nothing else. Worry for his husband and son gnawed at him, consuming him from the inside, magnifying the pain coursing through his body to almost unthinkable levels.
"Off," Tony gasped into Steve's mouth as he slid the t-shirt up his abdomen, his fingertips searing heat into Steve's skin with every touch, just like they had ever since the very first time he brought Tony to his bed. They had been together now for over three years and married for almost two, and yet Tony's touch was still able to completely electrify him every single time they were intimate.
"New tech, do you think?" asked Steve, giving his head a quick shake. His mental compartments had been in such a horrendous mess ever since Tony had stormed out of his room that morning that he could barely tell which end was up, much less fly with anything close to his usual precision.
Tony turned on his heel, his upper lip curling into a sneer as he pressed his palm to his chest, over the arc reactor.
"Yeah, that's what Maria always says too," said Carol. "She calls Monica her anchor all the time, says she would've been lost without her after her husband was killed."
Steve smiled as he reached for one of his protein ration bars, taking a large bite and grimacing at the bitter taste. Definitely not up to his cooking standards.
"Yeah, I've actually got one more," Bucky said. "Why are we even thinking about going into space in the first place? Just for the hell of it? To show the Meridians that we can?"
"Okay, but Colonel, do you seriously think that this is really what's best for our son?" Steve demanded. He looked over at Howard, anger welling in his gut at the man's expression of mild amusement. "No offence, Mr Stark, but you haven't exactly been up to your usual standards for a very long time. Have you?"
Because if Tony—or Peter, for that matter—had had even an inkling of what had been going through his head, then… well, Steve was certain that there was no way Tony would ever allow Peter to visit his store again.  Much less tell him they would see him tomorrow.
"Steve, get back on my wing," Bucky said firmly. "We've only got about thirty minutes left so why don't we just switch spots for the rest. Copy?"
"Yeah, I bet," Gwen said. "Is he just not healing as fast as he used to or something?"
try to imply that my mother was anything but a shining light for this company!” Tony yelled.  “I will tolerate a lot of things from you, Obadiah, but I will not tolerate that!”
"But he's my son too!" Steve cried as the tears finally escaped, rolling down his cheeks. "Tony, what's wrong? Don't you recognise me? I'm your husband! I love you, how can you not see that?"
"Cap, these things are starting to circle around!" Bruce called from somewhere behind him. "I think they're trying to flank us!"
"Well, if he does happen to ask, we don't want him knowing what's going on here," Steve insisted. "Tony and I will tell him when the time is right."
And she even kissed his forehead when she tucked him in, just like Dad and Papa always did. Like Peter had told Ned, anyone who thought Natasha Romanoff was just a heartless, cold-blooded former KGB assassin didn't know the real her at all. She didn't let many people see her softer side, but to Peter she was the most sweet and loving woman he had ever met.
“Okay, honey, we’re pretty much set,” Dad said as he tapped a few final commands into his keyboard.  “Last call for potty breaks, snack breaks, sleeping breaks, running breaks, or—”
Steve gave him a soft smile. "Yeah," he murmured. "I guess that's usually a good idea."
Uncle Bucky nearly spat out his mouthful of Dr Pepper all over the chessboard. "You did?" he asked, laughing and sputtering. "And how'd Стиви feel about that?"
“Well, I don't really mind either way,” says Steve.  “But just know that you don't have to call me Mr Rogers.”
Or ominous.
"Just the Air Corps part," said Steve. "I don't really know much about what goes on anywhere else."
Which, all things considered, Tony couldn't really argue against. He had noticed Peter getting more and more down about the fact that Gwen was leaving soon, and knew he was trying to maximise the time he got to spend with her before she left. He and Steve had even discussed the possibility of making a trip out to London over the summer so Peter could visit her, but seeing as how they didn't have a house or apartment out there, Tony was uneasy about it. He just didn't feel comfortable having Peter anywhere that he couldn't adequately secure, and since he highly doubted that the British government would allow him to place some of his defence drones on top of one of their hotels, then the risk just wasn't worth it.
"Or… what, you'd get rid of me?" Uncle Sam asked with a rather wry grin, shoving a handful of popcorn into his mouth. "Go ahead and try, Iron Man. I'll watch."
It seemed like Steve preferred it that way anyway. Peter's initial first impressions of him aside, Steve had turned out to be a really great guy who seemed to enjoy spending time with Peter. He'd even confessed on one of his last visits that he felt like he could truly be himself when he was around Peter, instead of what he felt the Air Corps expected him to be, which to Peter was probably the biggest compliment that Steve could've given him.
Tony's eyebrows knitted together, shooting Peter one of his
"I'll second that," said Clint. "Pretty sure our main concern is gonna be keeping Thanos away from the Soul Stone, not any of our teammates."
“You almost forgot this, buddy,” Tony said with a chuckle.  “Kinda hard to do your homework when your homework’s not at home, right?”
"You're not gonna hurt me, honey," Tony pleaded, nearly growling in frustration. "Please, I need you right the hell—"
"Well, okay, you know I'm not gonna make you tell me," Tony said as he covered Steve's hand with his own. "But you are gonna talk to Sam about it, right?"
"No kidding," added Bucky. "Dude, I haven't heard anyone snore that loud since the war."
Tony thought.
Even after all the time that had passed, and how often Steve told him so, Tony still wasn't used to how much Steve loved him.
"Ah, just more of the same bullshi—I mean, nonsense, trying to make my job as difficult as possible," Tony muttered. He let out a loud moan as Steve's fingers threaded into his hair and pressed into his scalp, his knees nearly buckling. "Damn, babe, you keep that up and you're gonna have to carry me outta here."
Or, more appropriately, an airplane.
Peter's jaw tightened and he breathed in, giving Steve a single nod.
"All right." Steve watched as Senator Davis approached the podium, assuming his arrogant-as-hell expression that Steve had already grown to despise.
And right next to it sat another grave, its gravestone in even worse shape, the name barely visible.
stupid?
Peter grinned as he unlocked his locker. "Well, that's kinda the point, isn't it? It is a competition, right? A
Steve nodded, his back ramrod straight and his jaw clenched so tightly that it was throbbing as he watched Thanos yank the stone out from deep within the soil, shaking it free of dirt before holding it up to the sun, as if he were admiring it.
The Tennessee senator frowned as she leaned over to listen to her aide, whispering something that Steve couldn't catch.
"Yes, Master Peter?"
"And you know we're gonna have to take the suit away now, right?" Steve added. "We can't have you being tempted to go off by yourself like that again, Peter, we just can't."
Peter rolled his eyes.  Leave it to Dad to be rushing him now when he’d been waiting around for him all afternoon.
But Tony couldn’t afford to think like that.  Not when his entire future—his
"That and genius-level intellects," said Steve. "And I'm not going to let anything happen to Peter, Tony. I promise."
"Стиви?" Bucky asked as he twisted around in his seat. "You've gone all pale, what happened?"
Steve's lips curled into the slightest of smiles. "No, I suppose you don't. It would take a very special person to put up with me."
"They know that we're coming."
of kissing—Tony had spent far more than his fair share of both waking and sleeping moments imagining what Steve's beautiful body looked like underneath his clothes.
Steve nearly choked as he saw Image Peter nod, his brown eyes briefly flashing orange as he let go of the railing.
"Whichever one gets you naked, honey," Tony said as he playfully swatted Steve's ass. "Now, out!"
“You didn't wake me,” he says, still hoarse with sleep as he pushes himself up onto his elbows.
"This needs to come off, honey," Tony ordered, leaving no room for argument. Steve immediately obeyed, tugging the shirt over his head and tossing it onto the floor, a loud moan escaping his throat when Tony glided his palms up his abdomen to his pecs, brushing his thumbs across his nipples.
"Pete, it was just a bad dream, yeah?" Tony said, stroking Peter's hair. "Whatever you saw, it wasn't real, buddy."
“Oh,” Steve says with a nod.  He should’ve guessed it was something like that.  “I thought you told me that your math’s never wrong?”
"Copy that," said Sam as he stepped closer to Peter, laying a hand on the headboard of the bed. "One."
so what you say pretty much goes."
"No, it's not," agreed Peter. He set the bucket down between his knees and draped his arm across Gwen's shoulders, giving her a quick kiss on the cheek. "Thanks."
life."
“Mmm,” Tony grumbled, rolling his eyes.  He should’ve known that Obie’s “urgent matter” would be about something ridiculous that was still over three months away.
"Steve," Steve said as his smile grew wider. "Unless you'd like for me to keep calling you Mr Stark."
"Hey, guys," Sam said, a rather disgruntled look on his face. "Which one of you taught that kid of yours how to play chess, hmm?"
"All right," Tony said. He carefully brushed the hair from Peter's forehead before pressing a kiss there. "You'll tell him I'll be back as soon as I can, won't you?"
And then Tony's back arched up, his entire body shuddering as he came, spilling onto his fingers as Steve came only seconds later, their combined cries of pleasure intertwining just as tightly as their bodies.
"Oh fuck, Steve, you're so good," Tony moaned, hoarse and raw, with each word accented by the quick pants of breath that meant he was getting close. "So fucking good, baby, you're too good to me."
"Simon!" Gwen exclaimed. "Those are really personal questions you're asking!"
"Good evening, Miss Stacy," Dad said through the passenger window as they approached the truck. "Thanks for keeping Pete in one piece for us."
"I'd rather you didn't," Tony cut in as he pushed himself up to his feet. He had to get out of there; there was no way he could think rationally with those piercing blue eyes staring down at him, tugging on his heartstrings. "I… I need to go. I can't—I can't be around you right now. I need to think, so…"
"Yeah," said Carol. "The last thing we need is for Mitchell here to start crying again."
"I didn't want to. You were sleeping."
"Oh, yeah," Tony said, the sultry look in his eyes and the sexy timbre of his voice almost too much for Steve to handle. "That's the infamous Stark charm, you know."
"JARVIS, is there any way you can boost Tony's firepower?" asked Bruce as he and Dr Cho pulled up next to Steve in the massive converted Suburban the team kept for local medical emergencies. Steve immediately climbed into the back where Dr Cho was waiting, laying Peter down on the stretcher.
Tony drops his shoulders, letting out a fake chuckle.  “Yeah, except I’m pretty sure even at three you knew what was going on most of the time,” he says, earning a blatant side-eye from his son.
"Dad?" Peter said. "What do you think?"
"And my dad knows that," Peter finished. "He knows you didn't have a choice, and there's no way he would've said you could stay here if he didn't believe it."
"That must've been the guy that caused the lake to freeze over last summer." Peter rubbed at his eyes behind his glasses, his heart thudding as the file went on to comment that while the cryokinesis test was moderately successful, the subject himself didn't survive the attempt.
"No, it is fucking
"Peter knows to call us first," Dad said, rather shortly as he took Peter's backpack from Gwen and handed her the towel. "C'mon, buddy, let's get you home, yeah?"
“They’re here, Tony!” Steve rasps, gasping in relief as he’s finally able to peel open his eyes.  “Our team, they’re here, and they’re gonna get us outta here, and—”  He breaks off, overcome as he threads his fingers through the icy strands of Tony’s hair.  “And then, once Dr Cho says it’s okay, I’m gonna take you out on a real date and show you such a good time that you’ll never forget it.”
Only this Battle of Wakanda wasn't quite the same.
"As you wish, sir."
think about what might have happened if Carol hadn't suddenly appeared when she did. Bruce had also told Steve that Tony had been breathing air that was way too thin for at least twenty-four hours before Carol managed to locate the ship, and so was shocked that Tony was still somewhat conscious when they landed.
Or ever, if he was truly honest.
"It's okay, honey, it's probably just a routine something-or-other to check on the status of the Damage Control stuff," Tony said, not too convincingly when Steve's frown grew even deeper.
"All right, sweetheart. We can do that."
“Yes,” Steve whispered as he burrowed closer.  “Thank you.”
Tony shook his head, gripping his left forearm so tightly that his knuckles were white. "I'm sorry, Mr Beck, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tell you to suspend all further experiments with that drug until further notice. I'll continue to study your holographic technology, but I want the complete supply of that drug brought to Pepper Potts' office within fifteen minutes from the conclusion of this meeting. Is that clear?"
"Oh? And where do you think you're going now?" Tony asked. "It better not be Columbia again, 'cause—"
"Yeah, I'm sure you would believe that, considering where you come from," Mr Stacy said. "But I'll also tell you that our police have orders to arrest this so-called Spider-Man on sight if he ever dares to show his mask again in public, and if I had my way, that would extend to anyone else who wants to try something stupid like that. No one should be operating above the law. No one."
Which, Peter realised, he probably already was. He just tended to keep it tucked away better than Dad did.
"Pete," he stammered. "Buddy, I'm so—I'm so sorry, and—"
Papa would call them Irish-green, since his ma had had green eyes too.
He’s lucky he even can afford it at all, given how desperate his situation was after his abysmal failure in Athens.  If it wasn’t for the semi-decent health insurance plan he was offered by the university when he was hired, it likely would have been at least three years before Steve could’ve saved up enough money to afford his surgery.
"Yeah, it does," Dad said with a sigh. "All right. Sounds good so far."
Since it was already after curfew, the hallways and parking lot were dark and quiet as Steve gently loaded Peter into the backseat of Tony's car, tucking a blanket over him before crawling in next to him.
"What I believe you are trying to decipher, Thor Odinson, is whether or not Wakanda is the resting place of the gem you would call the Soul Stone," he finally said. "Is that correct?"
The general nodded, letting out a heavy sigh. "Just getting the Emergency Broadcast System back up and running has been huge, so please extend my deepest thanks to Dr Banner and Colonel Rhodes the next time you see them."
“As a single guy, I’m allowed to look from time to time.  It doesn’t mean that—”
"Yeah, I think I hesitated just a bit too long on the stick," said Bucky. "Better luck next time."
"Bruce?" Tony said. "Are we—are we good here?"
"Captain, we must hurry. Please, follow me," Shuri said as she led Steve and Peter through the crowded plain, which had fallen completely silent in the aftermath of Tony's snap, save for an eerie sort of whistling noise left behind as each member of Thanos' army faded into ashes.
"Exactly like Footloose!" Quill exclaimed. "Is it still the greatest movie in history?"
“Uh huh,” answered Peter, not even trying to suppress his triumphant smile.  “And I won’t be going there and back, I’ll just hang out until you get there.  You know how much I love bookstores.”
"He's still fighting it, Steve!" Natasha said from the anteroom. "None of them can believe it, they've never seen anything like it!"
"Mmm, can't say I'm too surprised," Phillips said. "I doubt he wants to remember too much of it. Especially since the serum worked even better than we'd originally hoped."
How did that old movie quote go again?
"Okay, so, how 'bout you come inside and tell us some more about it, hmm?" Natasha cut in. "No offence, but you look like you're about ready to fall over."
"I'll do it," he said quietly, and Tony's belly immediately dropped. "Just tell me when."
"Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, sir," answered JARVIS. "All vital signs are within his normal parameters."
“I will return for you straightaway, Captain!” Thor calls a few seconds later.  “Please do not move from that spot!”
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
"Well, it wasn't a very pleasant conversation," Steve continued, shuddering slightly. "They were closed up in our spare room, but Ma was really letting him have it. And once they finally came out, Phillips told me to meet him at the base in two days."
"We are currently in the midst of a developing crisis," said Dr Strange, sounding grim. "It's not overselling it to say that the fate of the universe is at stake."
"Five… four… three… two—"
"I'll be fine, Colonel," Papa said. "I still can't thank you enough for—"
Uncle Bucky huffed, moving one of his bishops with a lot more force than was probably necessary. "I don't—I don't know, Peter," he said quietly. "I just—I don't know. We'll just have to wait and see."
Tony, informing him that he was no longer a boy but a man, and a man of whom he was most proud, indeed.
"Nah, it's okay, buddy," Tony said. "I know Papa's happy you're here too."
from the jagged split causing him to shudder.
"So they're the same dreams that you started having after the battle with Loki?" asked Steve. "About the space army?"
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered, pressing his fingers over Steve's mouth. "I know, but not now, okay? Let's just… get home first."
"Very good, sir."
“Peter’s not with you guys, is he?” Steve asks as Thor loops some kind of shimmering rope-like thing around Tony’s waist.  “‘Cause it’s not safe!  He—he could—!”
“How?” he asked, so quietly he was surprised he was even audible.
"Uh huh. And you be careful!" Peter called as Uncle Bruce handed the phone back to Dad.
“All right, so… where should I put you?” he whispered as he glanced up at the top shelf of his bookshelf, plotting in his mind how he could rearrange some of his other
"All right, all right, enough with the goddamn chatter," Colonel Phillips cut in. "I've already got enough of a headache without all of you yahoos adding to it. Captain Rogers, how close are you to your first deployment?"
"The news said this area hadn't had snow for New Year's in almost ten years," Steve said as he settled into his chair next to Tony. "So I say we got lucky."
"Yes, I know that," said Grandma. "Like I said, I'm not proud of how I was. All I can say is at the time, I didn't know any other way to survive. I'd just lost my husband, with not even a body to bury, and then Steven was born only a couple weeks later. And then, only a couple of weeks after that, the government threatened to kick us out of the house if I didn't start paying rent. As an Air Corps pilot Joseph's living expenses were covered, but that all stopped as soon as he was killed."
“I’ll send them over in a few minutes,” Fury said after a short pause.  “I hope I don't have to tell you just how classified these are.”
"JARVIS, you didn't happen to have the time to look deeper into those coding changes that Beck made while he was here, did you?"
"'Cept he didn't use his own name," Tony grumbled. "Kid has about a hundred different role-playing names on his Minecraft forums, so he's probably going through those."
"I hate that it's come to this," he said quietly. "All the suspicions, not knowing who you can trust. I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since during the war, and I don't like it, Tony. I really don't."
Gwen's cheeks flushed even deeper as she fiddled with the corner of her napkin. "Um… no. I'd actually love to work for Stark Industries someday, as one of their scientists. I was thinking of applying for one of their summer internship positions since I'll turn sixteen in the spring, so…"
Natasha said from several metres away. "
"No, I've been here about a half hour," Dad said. "You just looked so cute laying there that I didn't want to wake you."
"Yeah, you do though," Bucky said firmly. "You always have a choice, Стиви. If you wanted to, you could go up to that cockpit right now and order Сэм to land this thing somewhere in the middle of nowhere, and then disappear. You could choose to walk away from all of this and become some kind of wandering nomad for the rest of your life. You could choose to do that, Стив, but you won't. And you know why?"
"Say hi to your little bug. Got it," Tony said. "You know, for all of my qualms about the Russian language, I have to say, it is almost scary how accurate your diminutive nicknames can be."
"Except that it only triggered one of the drones," said Auntie Nat. "Which means that whatever it was—"
"Okay, okay, um…" Peter said as he stood back up a couple seconds later. "You remember the movie
To his credit, while Steve had noticed the downright murderous look in Tony's beautiful brown eyes and the tight clench of his hands, Tony had only given the doctor a curt nod in response.
" from Clint as a clap of thunder followed directly on its heels, so loud that it shook the Suburban.
"My target's approaching in three minutes," Carol said. "Preparing to deploy satellite."
"I did. But Tony, he's… Peter needs a heart operation, one that he should've had a long time ago, and the government's been holding it over Tony's head for years while they practically work him to death, and—"
He briefly wondered if T'Challa was somehow enhanced. He'd done some digging into the Wakandan culture and history after their initial meeting in Namibia, and while SHIELD's files on the country were woefully brief, there were a few mentions of something called the Heart-Shaped Herb that was supposedly sacred to carrying the mantle of the Black Panther.
"Justin Hammer couldn't manage his way out of a paper bag, so it's got to be HYDRA that's pulling the strings," Tony retorted. "Especially with these semi-enhanced things that keep showing up, I don't think Hammer Industries would have the capability for that kind of thing."
"Ant-Man?" Peter asked, surprised. "You mean that tiny guy that Pietro caught trying to sneak into the Compound that one time? That he put inside one of Papa's snack containers?"
"I know what you're talking about," Peter cut in. "Papa told me he could've been arrested and court-martialed if his superiors had found out."
"And that's just fine, little guy," Steve said, breathing a quick sigh of relief. He wasn't quite ready for Anthony to connect the dots just yet. "As long as you don't think he'd be more upset to find out later? I don't want to get you into any trouble."
Phillips glowered, grunting as he received another message. "Looks like it's not only the aircraft," he said as he turned the datapad towards Tony, showing him a live feed of a weapons locker. "Missiles, guns, grenades… all copies of our Langaran tech."
A huge thank-you to my awesome betas allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeeeh, and to therollingstonys for the gorgeous moodboard!  💖
"Excellent. Don't want the birds drying out," said Sam. "That does mean that you and Wanda might wanna get going, Nat. Carving up six turkeys is gonna take up quite a bit of space."
"Then we shouldn't!" Natasha exclaimed, her green eyes wide and eager. "Steve, we don't have to accept it! Carol is here! Nebula and Gamora are here, and they can all help us! Nebula said she might even know where Thanos is, so I say that we figure out a plan, and then go and get him! Make him somehow reverse all of this!"
"Approximately three, sir," answered JARVIS. "But be advised, the suit would only be able to withstand that amount of weight for exactly one hundred and twenty seconds, after which the legs would begin to buckle."
"Can you remind me to ask Dad about the heater in my Spider-Man suit? If the weather's gonna be this cold I need to make it more adjustable."
"Nothing wrong with being careful, Peter," Papa said as he pulled into the parking garage. "Now, I'm sure you're hungry?"
Tony let out a quick sigh. This was exactly how he figured Steve would react.
“Christ, buddy, did you seriously hack into Hammer Industries?  Why the hell for?”
"Are you sure, little guy?" Steve asked. "We've been at this for almost three hours now, you have to be getting tired."
Peter's shoulders sagged as he shook his head. "No, that was it. But at least we know that wherever it is has to be out in the water or something, right?"
"Yeah. So, how's Betty?"
"Yeah, he's okay," Sam assured him. "He still has his bad days every now and then, but… don't we all?"
pissed them off!" Tony exclaimed. "So how in the hell can you think—?"
A soft noise escaped from Tony's throat as Steve drew him impossibly closer, his hand splaying across Tony's abdomen as he tried to soak up every single second of their closeness. Warmth bloomed across Steve's chest as he recalled how Tony had woken him in the middle of the night, how Tony's lips had brushed across his neck as his slick fingers curled around his erect cock. As soon as Steve had peeled his eyes open Tony had climbed on top of him, rubbing Steve's cock against his ass as he pleaded with his frightened brown eyes for Steve to help him chase the nightmares away.
"Well, I'm pretty sure he's been saving mine too," Steve said. "Before him I never felt comfortable with people seeing me as anything other than an Air Corps test pilot. I was—"
Tony said as Steve broke away, kissing a path down his jaw to his throat and latching onto his pulse point. "You're distracting me, babe."
And that had been
Finally, after several minutes had passed and not one, but two Meridian pilots had been "scared the hell off" by some display of strength or valour or peacock feathers or whatever-the-hell else the Langaran pilots did up there while they were patrolling, Tony cleared his throat.
And even less so when Tony then chooses to tease him about it.
Regardless, it made him feel sick to his stomach now. To think that an innocent child like Peter lay suffering in a hospital bed because of a correctable illness while the national leaders squandered millions of credits just so they could live in the lap of luxury… well… it was deplorable, is what it was.
"Oh no, Papa, I'm so sorry!" Peter said as he rushed forward, gathering up a few of Steve's papers that had fluttered to the floor. "I didn't mean to scare you!"
"Yeah, yeah." Uncle Bucky frowned for a moment, then shot Peter a playful wink.
