“Nah. You can’t make Thor look all sad right now. It just makes you feel like you’ve kicked a puppy.”
“No,” Tony said, voice hard. His eyes were horrified. “JARVIS, that’s not happening.”
“S’okay,” Steve rubbed a hand across his face and then sniffed, curling into the warmth of their bed. “you’re up early.”
, fuck, I’m so sorry,” Tony stumbled forward, hands up, reaching out. But Steve stepped away with a shake of his head and then started walking, his footsteps damning on the kitchen floor. “Steve, please wait, I didn’t mean—”
“It has been logged, Sir.”
He shrugged, taking Steve’s wrist and curling his fingers around it. The count restarted in his head, a subconscious action. 1, 2, 3, 4— “you know how it is,” he explained nonchalantly.
Steve looked up, right into the middle of his group of friends, for a good five seconds. It seemed Natasha had some sort of premonition concerning what was about to happen, because she suddenly turned on her heel and left the room very swiftly.
“Absolutely not,” Mr. Wilson said immediately, voice hard, “Steve, you’re already on thin ice with the school as it is, you can’t let your attendance fall, and I won’t lie to the school about where you are.”
Tony laughed, waggling a finger. “Ah, see, my trick is- just don’t go home. Can’t yell at you if you’re not there.”
There wasn’t a sound aside from the slight pit-pat of rain on concrete, and he snarled in fury just to fill the silence.
It was rather odd how fast Tony had become such a prevalent part of his life, he thought to himself as his fingers tucked a stray tuft of hair behind Tony’s ear. He knew he was playing with fire, here; it was obvious. More’s the point- he knew and he did not care. Steve was rather under the impression that perhaps Tony was worth the burns.
They dated for four years, and they were without question the happiest years of Steve’s life. Of course, it didn’t come without challenges—they had their arguments, and they could certainly be explosive at times. Bucky had often ranted about how he’d never once known another couple who could scream themselves hoarse in an argument one minute and then cuddle up on the couch the next, but that was just how Steve and Tony worked. They were intense, opposite sides of the same coin. Of course it could get messy when something snagged in the mechanism. But they loved each other too much to let it get the better of them, and even in some of the worse arguments, Steve didn’t doubt that they would work it out. Because it was them. Because they always did.
Steve slept.
However, just as he curled his arm around the back of Tony’s waist and prepared to go south, his work-phone vibrated somewhere over to his left, loud and cutting. Steve paused, frown forming on his face. “I should answer that.”
“Don’t quote Lana at me right now, that’ll just make me even more depressed.” He knew as soon as Tony’s face fell that he’d said the wrong thing, and internally kicked himself. Tony had been smiling, if somewhat weakly, and now he was back to looking miserable. “Ignore that, I didn’t mean it like—”
, it was Steve’s goddamn curse. A hundred years of being alive and less than half of that spent actually living, you’d have thought he’d have learned by now to stop waiting around for things to happen and just go after them himself.
Sleepy and pliant and
This time it was him who found himself being shut up, and it was quite possibly the first time in his life in which he was happy about someone cutting him off mid-sentence, because it meant more Steve-kisses, and in the space of roughly 1.2 minutes, Steve-Kisses had managed to become his most enjoyable practice in the world. Which was saying something.
With a sigh, he shook his head and continued, his hand going to the door. Taking one last short breath and steeling himself, he pulled it open.
Steve just rolled his eyes as Tony squeezed his butt playfully, digging around in his pocket with his left hand and hugging Tony closer with the other. “You know, you’re lucky you’ve got such an organised boyfriend,” he declared as he found what he was looking for and pulled it out of his pocket, waving it in Tony’s eyeline. “I even got it strawberry flavoured. Your favourite.”
“I think you’d all better come in, don’t you?” He asked, and Steve got the impression that he may have just done something that not even an apology to Mr. & Mrs. Wilson was going to be able to fix, this time.
Steve was fucked, essentially.
The rest of the table were laughing, Tony was yelling at Thor to put Steve down, and Steve couldn’t help but giggle as Thor continued to parade him up and down the table. He could hear the dinner ladies yelling at the both of them from across the room- he was going to get into trouble for this if he didn’t get put down soon, damn him. Thor was mad as a bag of cats. God only knew how Jane was going to handle him.
“It’s okay, it’s just Clint,” Tony called out to Steve, who just groaned. “What? What did I do, I was only checking-”
learn when to keep your head down and just get on with it. I know that people can be cruel, and sometimes you don’t wanna listen to what the teachers are saying, but you’re not thinking about the repercussions here. If you get into big trouble at school, then it’s gonna flag up with your social worker. I don’t want to have to have you go through all that again; I know you hate seeing them.”
brimming under his chest, and it was a sensation that Tony had learned experience not to ignore. Bad things tended to happen when they did.
“Well he didn’t make
Oh, how he hated himself. Oh, such hatred.
“Guys, guys- you’re not gonna believe what I managed to get hold of!” Clint burst into the quiet living room, where Steve had only just drifted off on Tony’s shoulder.
, like always. Now he could only focus on getting Tony out and keeping him safe. That was all he had left, and by God, he wasn’t going to mess that one up. Not for anything.
“I know you’re not okay,” Tony told him with a shrug and a half-smile, “you think I can’t see it? But believe me- this isn’t the way to deal with it.”
They both glanced shortly toward each other at that, before Rhodey sighed and Pepper said “Tony.”
seen Steve hold one. Which was weird, considering the nature of their jobs.
“What? Then why the hell do you always change the subject or get distracted or leave whenever I try-“ Steve made a wavy gesture with his hands, “-y’know, going further?”
As Steve flicked the switch, holographic foes flickered to life, their routines and fight-styles scrambled from the thousands of options Tony had randomized. Natasha crouched, immediately taking out her blade and slicing through the first one that approached. “Okay, GO!”
Steve nodded, tiny and broken, “Black out in the gym, sometimes, but not for long. Only been sick twice, yet. And hallucinations- Just the one, and it wasn’t for long- only Peggy, when Clint brought her up- but it’s nothing, okay, Tony,
The words still don’t come, and Tony wants to
“Hey, I mean, at the end of the day, he’s probably warmer than all of us,” Peggy said with a shrug as she jumped up and down and then rubbed her hands together. “Why are we all loitering outside the mall in the freezing cold anyway?”
He remembered the phone call he’d had just a few minutes ago, the words on a loop in his head. “Please,” Thor had said, voice quiet and
“Don’t worry you guys, you’ll all soon have husbands and wives of your own. No need to feel jealous, your time will come,” he promised them, cackling as the whole group groaned in frustration.
Like father like son, he thought bitterly, brushing a hand over his face and pushing off the tears. He wanted, so selfishly, to just know what Tony was thinking. More than anything. Wanted Tony to tell him it was okay, comfort him like he always fucking did, because he was perfect and soft and he let Steve be fragile. But just thinking it made him feel sick with shame, with disgust. Tony was in pain, traumatised, laid up in a hospital bed having previously thought that Steve had done that to him of his own volition, and then here he was, wishing that Tony could be the one to offer kindness to
“Hey, you were the one who had the bright idea of turning up wearing his coat like your victory winnings,” she said, pointing an accusing hand over to the black leather jacket in the corner of the room, “I’m pretty sure that’s what made Bucky flip in the end. He thought Stark was showing you off.”
He mostly kept himself together on the ride over, forcing a sense of calmness over his mind so that he could focus enough to be even of the slightest use. Against the seat of the car, his back sat rigid and taut, every muscle of him tensed and ready to fly to action. His hands shook in his lap, and the thought that he’d been feeling sleepy and lethargic ten minutes ago was now an absurd notion. No part of him felt tired now. He was more alert than he’d ever been in his life; noticing everything, the twitch of Loki’s hands, the minute of the clock steadily heading up from thirty to thirty-two, to thirty-three, to thirty-four…
before, let me tell you.”
With an angry lurch, Steve hauled up another one of the bodies in the snow and tried to find anything useful tucked away in the uniform. The HYDRA logo sneered up at him as he checked the pockets, and not for the first time that day, he thought about how nice life was going to be once they’d wiped that organization off the face of the Earth.
He watched in complete fascination as Tony shut his eyes and let the music roll over him, fingers working back and forth to the tune of Für Elise. The notes were soft and soothing, slightly slower than what it normally sounded like, turning it into more of a lullaby than anything else. Steve knew it was for his benefit- Tony had nothing pressing on his mind that needed working through, but he was aware of how much Steve adored hearing him play. He thought it would soothe Steve’s mind- and, of course, he was right. Steve smiled dimly to himself as he rested his cheek against the cushions, the niggling afterthoughts of his horrible night’s sleep slipping easily away as the melodic music filled the room, just as Tony had thought it probably would.
Steve stared miserably over to the bed, where Tony’s hand waited for him enticingly. Any other time, and Steve wouldn’t have even had to think about taking it, holding on tight and sleeping with their fingers entwined on the bed. But everything was different now. Steve was scared of putting hands on him. And God, how fucked up was that? Three years into a relationship with the man he loved above all else, and Steve didn’t even trust himself to touch him.
“Ugh,” Clint’s voice knocked him out of his little trance, and he blinked, looking over at the archer as the man pulled a face,
JARVIS paused for a moment. “This bag had already been packed for months, in case a situation such as this ever occurred.”
There was a very brief pause as Natasha processed that. “Steve, you’re a fucking idiot. We’re in a SHIELD fortress. You can’t expect to just walk away with the most wanted terrorist in the world—”
He turned his eyes down to the floor, picking on a stray seam that lined his pillow. “I was never going to kill myself,” he said obstinately, but the way Peggy looked at him made him certain she didn’t believe that at all.
“Well,” Steve shrugged as nonchalantly picking at a seam in his bedsheet and biting his lip, “you know… I’m pretty sure I’m in a relationship with Tony Stark now, so-“
( He didn’t want to admit to himself that he’d felt scared going up to bed recently, but it was there. In the corner of his mind, waiting to be acknowledged.)
He put his hands up to his head and started to attempt the task of taking off the helmet. Meanwhile, Tony leaned back against his bike and continued to watch him, pulling out another cigarette from God only knows where and tucking it in his mouth.
Tony pulled another face, this one not nearly as amusing as he glared in exasperation at the team around him. They all turned to him and pulled the same face, Thor throwing up his hands and opening his mouth to say something. Tony, however, got there first. “Goddamn it, which one of you called them already? Shit, we can’t let them take him yet, he’s at risk. Someone hold them off—”
Tony leaned against the lockers, shrugging. “I was coming back from detention and saw them beating on you. Thought I’d step in.”
when they wanted to, and Tony had no idea how much he was even holding back. He should probably make sure he didn’t get Steve angry enough to do it again. That’d just be messy for everyone.
The problem was ignorance. Tony couldn’t think of any explanation as to why there was so much pushback against Unhuman autonomy or rights. Baseliners simply weren’t taught enough about them, and they never had been. There were hundreds of thousands of years’ worth of stigma and fear, whole myths and legends and societies built off the back of their fear of Unhumans. And so the status quo wasn’t changing. But it was the 21
And then the boots fired back up, sending him headfirst back toward the roof.
Thor turned to him, then. Tony noted that he was wearing boxers and nothing else. “I’ve been to Hel and heard quieter screams than his.”
me punch Ty in the face, did you? Jesus.” He sighed, taking in a deep breath through the phone.
“Actually, Mr. Rhodes, you will not need to worry about that,” JARVIS spoke up from the coffee table, and Rhodey turned in surprise, a smile breaking out on his otherwise strained face. “Sir took the time to download my program onto this hard-drive before leaving the premises. Although I appreciate the concern.” There was a small pause. “I truly would have hated to remain there without Sir.”
“I’m getting a strange sense of Déjà vu here,” Tony said, unlatching his helmet and then turning around to raise an eyebrow, “are you going to need help getting out of your helmet again?”
Above him, Tony paused for a second and then leaned back, head turning to the ceiling as he huffed. “
planning something.” Steve grinned smugly, because he may have been the paragon of virtue and icon of America when he was on the clock, but off-duty he was nothing more than an irritating asshole.
“Noooooo!” Maria giggled and shook her head, and the look on Tony’s face when he looked down at her was filled with enough love that Steve would repeat all his own pain a thousand times over just to see it again. Tony glanced up at him, and Steve figured that the thought must have been loud, because Tony leaned over and caught his mouth in a gentle kiss, Maria still tucked up safely between us.
He’s about to say
“Well, a certain idiot once told me that you don’t need to
Yeah. Peggy was the best.
“How the hell did you manage to get an artificial intelligence into your room?” Steve walked forward, inspecting the desk in awe; all the buttons and wiring obviously melded together by hand, and suddenly the conclusion came to him-
“Of course it was a good choice, they’re the only sort of choices I make,” Steve raised an eyebrow and then trailed his hands up the curve of Tony’s spine and back down again, settling them at the small of his back. The video he’d seen of Tony yesterday came back to him; younger, skinnier, with eyes that had seemed even bigger than they did now he was older. He hadn’t watched all of it. Even now, when Steve knew every part of Tony intimately, it had still felt like too much of a violation of his privacy. But he’d seen the way Tony had been looking at the other two people in the video—trusting and nervous. He must have been young, to still be looking at his bed-partners like that.
“So, Rogers, what’s the truth?” Sam folded his arms and leaned against the wall. “Did you really? After all my wise words? Not that I’m like, judging you or anything,” Sam hurried to mention, holding up his hands in surrender, “like, you do you, man, but… Tony? Really? I told you his rep- he’s seventeen and you’re fifteen-“
Tony winked and then slipped off- and a second later Steve watched the door at the front of class open, Tony’s head poking out. A few of the kids looked up, but he shot them all a sharp look and put a finger to his lips, and they quickly put their heads back down again. Steve just leaned back in his chair and folded his arms, watching the idiot as he looked at the teacher in the other corner and then quickly slipped in as inconspicuously as possible.
Tony sighed, and then fed him another chip to shut him up. “Just drive, Rogers.”
“It was a clean shot,” Natasha declared, her voice more hard and even and lifeless than it had ever been before, and if Steve had cared, he would have known that was because she was falling apart at the seams. “There was no pain, Steve. None at all. The last thing he saw and thought of was you.”
Without even meaning to, Steve suddenly found himself an inch and a half from Tony. He barely even registered it; hands going up for the ring and then slipping it back onto his thumb where it belonged, feeling the cool metal against skin like a long lost friend.
-621, 622, 623, 624-
He turned his head back to the door and took the beginnings of a step forward, hand reaching toward a chair he could jam under the handle, but of course, it was in that moment that the door chose to open in one fluid motion. Steve watched it, his brain confused for a fraction of a second— and that was what became his downfall. That fraction of surprise, the lack of reaction.
. Steve was going to… he’d not let Tony get hurt. He was solid. Good. Firm. Home.
It was nothing on the view in front of him.
Everything was okay. Steve was Steve again, and any lingering second’s worth of fear Tony was still harbouring whenever the other man walked into a room alone with him was going to go away once they
“They’re not coming, Steve,” Tony said loudly and with finality.
“-and, I mean, there’s so much we don’t know yet, and probably never will. It frustrates the damn hell out of me. I hate not knowing stuff. Main reason I never pursued astronomy or theoretical physics.
There was silence in the office, as Steve sat straight and kept eye contact with Fury. His head was beginning to ache from where it’d hit the wall, and there were pains up and down his body. He must have been punched more times than he’d thought.
“Lean your head back,” Natasha ordered, her cool fingers pressing into Tony’s forehead and resting him against the thin pillow on the cot. She turned and analyzed the wound for a moment, and then her mouth pursed. That wasn’t promising. “I don’t think we can just bandage this. The bleeding’s not slowed up at all. We need to cauterize the wound.”
Carol rolled her eyes and pulled a face, looking apologetic. She scratched out something else with her marker, before holding it up and showing him.
Sensing Tony probably wasn’t going to respond, Steve’s smile dropped a little, although in fairness it had been shaky to begin with. He swallowed and stepped forward. “Listen, Tony—”
The stones had nowhere to go now. And if Thanos got to them, then it was the end of life itself.
With another pout, Tony let his chin fall onto Steve’s sternum. “Yeah,” he muttered, “I do.
Steve shut his eyes and bit his lip, pulling back the scream as it threatened to rip out through his throat. His captors had been at this for hours now. He felt as if his body was going to fall apart, crumble like a sandcastle being hit by a wave. They were killing him. Slowly.
resolve- he would keep working, absolutely no distractions, not even tempted by the smell of popcorn beginning to pop in the kitchen-
“Uhhh,” Tony waved a hand, “working, you know. Busy.”
Steve didn’t say anything to that, and Tony just clenched his jaw and looked down at his hand, sat protectively over the thrum of Steve’s heart. That hadn’t been there, last time Tony had felt it. It had been gone, missing, close to never coming back again.
or something along those lines, in that stupid sing-song voice that adults always did when they were being dicks.
At that, Rhodey snorted. “You’ll have to ask him that, ‘cause fuck if we know.”
Peter couldn’t hold back his sigh of quiet relief, but he quickly schooled it into a huff of annoyance as he pulled a face against his Pops’ chest. “Okay, no need to overdo it with the sap, I think I get the point-”
He wasn’t sure how many times he said Tony’s name. Until words wouldn’t come anymore. Until his voice had given up. The bathroom was as dark as the bedroom. He sat and stared at the rim of the bathtub for a few hours.
There were shrugs and shaking heads around the room, so Steve figured nothing overly important had happened while they’d been gone. Tony came back into the kitchen a minute or so later, and it didn’t take long for all of them to settle down into their normal routine again; with Tony and Clint bickering across the table and Natasha egging them both on, and Thor sat happily filling himself up on bread rolls before the meal even began. Bruce informed him that he had no reason to complain when he had no bread left to dip, and Thor merely grunted as he stuffed even more food into his mouth as usual.
“I’m gonna ask you this, and it’s gonna be blunt as fuck, but I need to know that he hasn’t just treated my best friend like shit for no reason,” Bucky began, eyes on the road as his fingers moved and put Rhodey’s voice on loudspeaker, “Rhodey, do you think Tony has some sort of PTSD that stems from the abuse he got from his dad? Or any other sort of issue like that.”
So much had been lost that he wasn’t even sure he could feel anything any more. It was all just… empty.
He snarled, actually fucking
“I’m leaving!” Steve jumped to his feet and waved his finger at them all judgingly, “I’m going to get food and I swear, if you make any more innuendos of that caliber in front of me again I will move school.”
“Oh, you ungrateful sonofa-“
Steve cursed. “This isn’t right,” he declared, and Tony nodded his agreement.
“Only if they had it coming.” Tony winked and then breathed out, shaky and full of life in a way that Steve hadn’t seen since the night he’d kissed him again, after all that time. “Are you really sure about this?” He asked, his hand slipping back over Steve’s chest again.
He sat back. The grief he felt was something he had grown familiar with, by that point, but it still hurt to see it mirrored on Tony. “Oh.”
It was pouring with rain when Steve arrived outside the tower. Typical. He’d only just showered, and now he probably smelt like wet dog all over again.
Thor looked at him, his face concerned. He almost said something else, but in the end he simply sighed and gave him a smile. “Sure,” he responded, “I’ll be here by the time last period ends.”
“Tony?” Steve’s voice drifted through his train of thought, the edge of excitement fading and turning into concern when he finally clocked the look on Tony’s face. “You okay?”
“You’re mad,” Steve called down after him, voice tinged with laughter.
Steve just hummed his reply against Tony’s mouth and let his arms wrap tighter around Tony’s waist, teeth biting gently on his bottom lip. Tony shuffled a little for a better angle, legs and arms tangled together on the sofa as they kissed.
“That’s the goal, Precious,” he winked and then posed briefly, watching the way Steve’s eyebrows rose in appreciation. “Don’t worry though, you’re the only one that gets to taste.”
Tony didn’t say anything, and it looked like Natasha was going to try and slap him out of it by the way her hand rose angrily. But he woke up on his own, scrambling up to his feet and then shutting his eyes in order to think, long and hard about everything that he knew was down in these floors. He just needed a way to get to Peter. Anything. Working audio transmitter with a strong enough signal, a fucking
, Steve,” Tony jerked wildly, hand slicing through the air and cutting him off, furious all over again. “Shut the
Steve opened his mouth, ready to argue on principal, but Tony shook his head. “Steve, if you won’t let me drive you to Goddamn hospital, you will at least let me get you somewhere with some half-decent medical supplies.”
She’d only started adding the ‘always’ after they’d discovered her illness was terminal. That became how she’d sign off. Love you always, Steve, have fun at school. Behave yourself at Peggy’s, you understand? Love you always.
He couldn’t stop imagining the way Steve had just been so… lifeless, underneath him. There hadn’t been any blood, any twitching. Steve hadn’t even cried out. His heart had just stopped, and his body had stopped with it. It had been like looking at a corpse.
He got the vague feeling that maybe, just maybe, he was in a little bit too deep.
He couldn’t breathe.
“It’s what he deserves.”
“Oh, as if you haven’t done that at least once,
“Really?”
“How long have you been holding onto that thing?”
He felt the small vibrations as Steve chuckled, and briefly debated thwacking him for getting JARVIS to open the curtains at such an ungodly hour. Of course, the notion was quickly disregarded- that required far too much effort, and also Steve was curling his arms around Tony shoulder to pull him in closer, so it was kinda difficult for him to stay too mad.
In his head, all Tony could think was ‘oh’.
“-you’re still fifteen. That’s like a baby.”
They shared dessert, obviously, seeing as that was the one meal they could agree on. Warm chocolate fudge brownie and salted caramel ice-cream, because Steve had a sweet-tooth a mile wide and Tony just liked listening to the noises he made when he took the first mouthful. Positively sinful.
Tony ran anxious fingers through his hair. “Didn’t want to wake you either,” he mumbled, “figured I’d go up and just… check whether or not you were awake? It made sense at the time.”
“I’m gonna veto that for now.” Because apparently Steve refused to be swayed.
“I’m quite clearly busy right now,” Tony told him, waving at Steve, “but we can settle it by seeing which one of us can go back to my place and lift the steel girder that I’m trying to fit into my wall right now. Because I can guarantee that you will not be able to.”
In answer, Rumlow waved his hands emphatically. “Who do you think sold you out, Stark? Who do you think gave us your coordinates when you were holed up in that little alley in Santa Barbara? Think we just found you by accident? Luck? Think we captured your precious Stevie and tortured him for answers?” Rumlow chuckled again, shaking his head. “Tony, Tony, Tony… Agent Rogers was working for us all along.”
What it says on the tin. Warnings for major character deaths.
Tony wasn’t sure which part was more fucked up- the fact that he thought Clint was wrong, or the fact that maybe, just maybe, Clint could be right.
Steve rolled his eyes, brushing his fingertip across Tony’s eyebrow. “I still think you’re hot, if it’s any consolation,” he said, “I can’t see your eye ‘cause of the swelling, but like, in an attractive way.”
“I can’t stop it,” Steve gritted, face ashen, eyes wide and horrified as he shivered, “Tony, I can’t—I don’t… they’ve done something, I can’t…” he took a stride forward and then stopped jerkily, teeth grinding. “Run,” he hissed, “get out… now. Go.”
“Something’s wrong,” Tony said suddenly, humour gone from his voice as he looked back down to the cockpit. “Oh, shit. Failsafe.”
Tony pulled his head up, and the look on his face was something between smug and seductive as he leaned forward a little. “I know everything, Steve. I’m all-seeing.”
Tony followed behind him, trying to figure out what the hell was going on- Steve was
Tony laughed. “Bet they were; s’not often Captain America calls up and asks to steal your house for a week. They’ve probably left just assuming that aliens are going to come and ruin it or their cow is gonna be involved in a super-secret operation—”
They were coming up to the anniversary of Phil’s death, after all.
With nothing else to do, Steve sat on the floor next to Tony’s head, his neck resting on the couch cushions as he stared at the opposite wall and counted down until the next hour, when he’d wake Tony up. At some point twenty or so minutes in, he had the sense to text Sam and let him know what was going on, and also give Sam’s parents a message too. He doubted he’d be getting home tonight.
The survivors regrouped, all of them numb. Steve did a count of who they’d lost, and then threw up in the bathrooms. There was dust all over his hands. He wondered if it was symbolic.
His best friend had been a murder weapon for seventy years. While Steve had gotten the peace of a coma, Bucky had become HYDRA’s pet. Their unwilling killing machine. Loki had known, and he’d… he’d told Steve, and—
fucking dumb.” Rocket shook his head, looking stubbornly down at his desk as he threw the ugly little doll back onto the table. Steve didn’t really understand most of what Rocket had just said, but he could hear the pain in the creature’s voice, and tried to think of something that’d take his mind off it.
He couldn’t… it didn’t… everything was a goddamn
It seemed that really, the only option was for Peter to stay with them while they worked on taking down the operation responsible for tracking and recapturing the little boy. If push came to shove and they couldn’t manage it, they could always go down the SHIELD protection route, which involved an agent taking him to someplace far away and looking after him until the hunt had died down. Although none of them were particularly keen on that possibility either. Anyway, it wouldn’t need to come to that. they were the Avengers. They could handle a baby just fine.
“Is that what we are, then?” Steve blurted before his brain-to-mouth filter could kick in and stop him. He saw Tony’s brow crease and hurried to expand: “I mean… you called me- and I was just wondering if that’s… you know. A Thing now. Definitely.”
?” Tony snapped irritably as he dived out of the way of another missile, looping around the giant robot so that it hit its barrier instead. Steve said nothing; too busy watching the SHIELD vans roll in from his vantage point up in the sky. He knew that they had specially developed weaponry to fight Iron Man. He knew they would probably not hesitate to use them, although they may be a little smarter and see that for the time being, Iron Man was fighting for their cause.
Tony made a mental note to be unfathomably grateful for that later.
That was how Steve’s dreams stuck with him. Not in the sights, but the sounds. The sensations. The taste of blood on the back of his throat that just never seemed to shift, even when it wasn’t really there at all.
Tony was— he was gone. Only Iron Man remained of him now, and Steve had to stop him before it was too late. Whatever it took.
didn’t steal Steve’s jumpers after bad nights in order to calm him down. That would just be stupid.
“Hey, hey, enough of that,” Steve told him, his voice concerned as he ran his fingers through Tony’s hair soothingly, “you don’t need to promise me something like that. This is a difficult time for you. The memories are closer to the surface. Harder to control-“
“I have a plan.”
Tony sucked in a little burst of air like he was going to try and argue, but it didn’t come. He palmed a hand over his tired eyes instead, and curled tighter against Steve’s side. “I want Maria to know Peter,” he whispered, small and quiet, “I want her to know her Auntie Pepper-Pott. And I don’t want her to live a world where she has to pass the memorial stones every day either.”
“Steve, come on, don’t be stupid, how is any of this your fault?” Tony asked, somewhat snappily, “you didn’t
Bruce’s face was twisted in fury, but he said nothing. Just shook his head again and looked away, until a second later when he stood abruptly from his chair. “I need to take a breather,” he muttered, before he snatched his bag up and then moved away from the table. Steve didn’t try to stop him- although the teacher did. Not that Bruce paid any attention to him, though. He left the class with a slam of the door before the teacher could even hope to apprehend him. The man just looked at the space Bruce had vacated for a second, blinking owlishly before turning back to the board as if nothing had ever happened. Steve snorted to himself. Typical. Teachers weren’t paid to give a fuck about their students, after all. Just teach them.
One of those mornings, then. Fine by Steve.
Tony looked at the screen dubiously. He’d been thinking of maybe getting a bit of sleep for the first time in a good few days, seeing as he was starting to see double and couldn’t exactly stand on his feet all that well. He opened his mouth to decline, but then stopped himself just a second before, suddenly thinking about it. He wanted to spend time with his team, and seeing as he was no longer an active duty avenger, the times when they would be able to hang out together were going to be much less, if any at all. Like Sam had said- ‘Team Bonding’ required you to, you know, be
It wasn’t enough, But it would do.
“We’ll need to sit him up in order to put his shoulder back in place,” Thor said beside him, and Steve nodded, his hands gently cradling Tony’s head and neck while Thor helped Tony into a sitting position. Tony hissed in pain again, good hand going to his head. “Fa male,” he said softly, “Vorrei sdraiarmi, per favour,”
“Oh, you’re full of good ideas, aren’t you?”
! I was makin’ out with Natasha because I’m dating
the stuff- “I… okay then. We can… there’s one at the end of the mall, right? Let’s go there.”
He thought about talking to Steve about it. About how he had to stop taking his anger out on Tony, that it wasn’t something they could keep doing, Tony could risk getting properly hurt by Steve and then it’d just be a mess- but he didn’t quite know how to broach it without Steve freaking out. He hadn’t mentioned anything about it, and so Tony didn’t want to be the one to do it. He didn’t want to know what the repercussions might be if he did. Anyway, it was... it was hardly even bad, really. Like he’d said earlier- superheroes. It was a different ballgame entirely, and Tony could take a knock or two. Hell, he’d had worse injuries from Steve when they’d been doing friendly sparring in the ring, and here Tony was acting like it was the end of the world.
Bucky blinked when Peggy smacked him over the head. "Ignore him, Steve, you know he's just being overly protective. Tony's crazy about you."
Sighing, he walked a little faster down the artificially lit streets, turning the corner and then spotting Farborough Street at the bottom of the road.
Steve glanced at Tony for a moment, then took a small breath. “I’m taking Tony with me.”
“Great.”
"I'll go find my friends, too," Tony said, "they're probably wondering where I am."
Steve pulled a face, entirely aware of the sudden change in conversation- a typical avoidance tactic. But Tony obviously didn’t want to talk about it further, and Steve got that. Sometimes those sorts of things just stung a little too much. “Nah- too busy hauling ass over here.”
Steve, however, seemed not to mind. “I thought it was a well-thought-out strategy. A little ostentatious. Very you. I liked it.” He wiggled the mistletoe between them and then laughed gently, cheeks still pink. “You still up for that kiss?”
Tony just shrugged. "He can sleep in the bed with us, right?"
Jan snorted, before curving off to head up the stairs and leave Steve on the bottom floor. “I really don’t have to- you make it obvious enough.” she called after him, spinning around in her little heels and then jumping up the stairs, waving to him from behind. He watched her dumbly as she reached the top of the stairs and then slipped in with another group of people easily, her smile stretching naturally over her face before disappearing around the bend.
Slightly.)
“Being creepy?” Tony finished, raising an eyebrow. Steve’s cheeks burned, and he sat up and got ready to leave, but then Tony just sighed and rolled his eyes. “God, just come inside, Steve. You don’t need to sit on guard.”
It was 2 in the morning by the time he managed to get back to their room, everything finally arranged and sorted. He felt sleepiness pull at his eyelids as he slipped through the door, but he had a few more things to do before he slept. Pulling out their suitcases from under the bed, Steve slowly began to throw his own clothes into it, making sure to be silent and not wake up his lover as he got some well-deserved rest. He didn’t much care for his own wardrobe, but he knew Tony did, so he spent a little bit longer picking out the outfits that he hoped Tony would like. Tony was probably going to pack a whole other suitcase the next morning despite all his efforts, but hey, it was the thought that counted.
“I can’t imagine what it’d be like to have Tony Stark kiss me,” Jan said, leaning back and hanging her head over the edge of the bed before pulling a face. “Probably weird. I’ve known him since he was in diapers.”
And hell if Steve knew what to do with that.
So I wanted to write a bit of Tony's non-okayness (Because It's me ofc I wanna do that lmao) So I thought I'd write this fill. Cue Tony being a bit of an idiot with substance abuse, icecream not-really-but-maybe-sort-of-dates, and of course, Steve being...well, Steve.
Bucky just rolled his eyes. “Mean Girls reference, you hermit. Just get in, get in!”
He also wore a long-sleeved shirt the next day. Steve hadn’t meant to, but he was so strong that he sometimes forgot when he held things too tight, they tended to bruise. But it was okay.
A thought struck Tony, then, and it made him spasm in revulsion. “What if there are more of them?”
He stopped dead in his tracks, whole body freezing to an unceremonious halt as he took in the room around him- the flickering glow of the LED lights and the wires that were strung across the ceiling like vines and the scraps of machines that littered every surface. It looked like something out of a sci-fi novel. It looked like… something Steve had never seen before. Magic and science, rolled into one. Jesus, Tony had maths equations scribbled along the walls- there were papers and files littered across the desk the same way any other kid would have homework- all of it going completely over Steve’s head as he took it in, of course, but… Jeez, he could still appreciate it.
Somehow, though, Steve found that unlikely. He wasn’t sure there was a universe around where he could ever not love Tony Stark.
“He’s not come back home for two weeks, now,” he continued, voice raw, “that’s a new record. Haven’t heard from him either. Could be dead or alive. And when-
He watched Ty as his eyes scanned quickly over Steve, before stopping somewhere at his collar. Steve remembered the fact that he was currently sporting Tony’s leather jacket over his usual shirt and jeans, and honestly, it was a dick move, but he winked at Ty anyway. It was just funny to watch the way the asshole’s jaw clenched in irritation.
They only found all of this out after Steve had restrained him and dumped him at the police station. He’d mostly just been crying for the first few hours, unable to handle everything piling up around him. Had things been a little different, Steve may have felt sorry for him. As it was, he’d just had to restrain himself from slamming the man’s head into a wall until something caved. He’d nearly killed Tony. Right then and there on the street.
The next time he looked at the clock again, it was nearly midnight. He’d worked for four hours, and now it all looked about ready. He’d still need to gather some more sources and material before he could launch it, but that shouldn’t take long. And then he could focus on promoting it to the masses.
“It’s HYDRA you should be hating, bud,” Rhodey came to stand by him and rested his hand gently upon Tony’s shoulder, “they threw the bomb at you.”
that had so fast become like home to Steve.
Tony’s head tilted, and a small smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. “Why Rogers,” he said through a sigh, “when you put it like that, how on Earth can a fella resist?”
“What sort of assistance?” Steve said slowly, beginning to stand, “is it something that would be better suited for, say, the fire department?”
It was going to be good. Tony would make sure of it.
Steve couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing. If he was able to do that, he was pretty sure he’d never stop talking about it. But Tony- Tony was actively making sure it was kept hidden, and it didn’t make sense-
That was Tony-speak for ‘hurts like hell’. Steve bit back a sigh and just continued to card his fingers gently through Tony’s curls. They were soft; a little fluffy from the rain of last night. “You gonna have some of the toast Thor’s making?” He asked, before adding, “sorry, that made it sound like a question. Have the toast Thor’s making, Tony.”
All he could think about was what must have happened after Steve had ended his call with Tony last night. Had he seen the man’s car rolling into the driveway and realised that he was too late? What had he been working on that was important enough to risk that? God, Tony hadn’t even thought Tiberius would see his threat through. Maybe he’d greeted Howard at the door, not even expecting the response he’d gotten.
Tony looked away. Well—now he could add humiliation to the list of shit that he was currently feeling.  “Yeah,” he mumbled, “yeah, that’s fine. Thank you.”
The cabin was freezing.
“I’d expect nothing less, obviously,” he muttered into Tony’s ear, before blowing into it and then laughing as Tony yelped and squirmed jerkily, elbowing Steve in the ribs.
“Did you have an argument with your friends?”
Steve was up a second later, two hands pulling both Bucky and Tony up off the floor. “You okay?” He asked Tony quietly, once again doing a cursory check.
. For me. In my eyes, I don’t really see what else you could do to redeem yourself.”
Tony wanted to scream at him. He also wanted to reach for him and hold on to Steve like he was the last person on fucking Earth. He had no idea which one to pick, so he chose neither and remained safely attached to the toilet, because he was fucking pathetic. Weak. He didn’t deserve to be an Avenger- how was he supposed to defeat supervillains when he became completely incapacitated by a splash of fucking water?
, that’d be hot.
He went to school cold in a way that couldn’t just be fixed by warm sweaters and lots of layers, but tried to put it out of his mind for the duration of the day. He smiled at Peter when he bumped into the kid on the corridors, poked Natasha when she was being annoying, and although he didn’t see Tony much that day, he made sure to kiss him goodbye and tell him to enjoy the lecture he was going to be attending in Vermont that night.
“They stay. Please,” and fuck, Steve was asking him, he was asking him to keep them, like Tony might somehow reject them for whatever reason.
Steve- what the hell happened?”
“I am… such a mess,” he whispered, and Steve was hit by the sadness in his voice in the same way one would be hit by a train at full-speed. Tony was looking down, down at his shoes, and Steve watched in horror as something fell over his cheek and spilled onto the carpet- Tony was crying.
“Once is enough,” his dad shrugged bemusedly, poking Peter in the side as he walked around the table to sit next to him and get to work on his snack.
Mostly.
“You would probably call this a hallucinogenic,” she continued, circling like a vulture, “but we like to call it the eternity drug. Want to know why?”
Tony hummed, the vibration tickling Steve’s neck. “I know,” he said through a breath of air, and then a second later, Steve felt him go limp. Fast asleep.
He sent off to Steve, knowing it was a bit of a long shot. After no instant response, Tony put the phone back down and then tried to focus up on the letter in front of him, telling him he was expected at a meeting over in the Pennsylvania branch tomorrow at 7 in the evening. The new Stark product launch was only a few days away, and so it was all hands on deck until they were 100% sure everything would go smoothly. Which, in all honesty, was unlikely to happen anyway. Tony had been in this game for a long time. This sort of shit rarely went without at least one aneurism-inducing hitch. Of course, the crusty board members wouldn’t ever believe that, and tried to make him ‘behave’ every time they were about to release a new piece into the public. And by behave, Tony knew they meant ‘act conservative and don’t flaunt the fact you have a boyfriend or that you’re anything other than a straight-laced boring shitheel like the rest of us’.
“I know,” Tony said quietly, looking away, “doesn’t mean I don’t know that it’s true.” He was quiet for a moment, before admitting, “I don’t think I’m okay, Steve. At all.”
When he went back into the living room five minutes later with his stack of food, he saw Bucky with his legs thrown over Tony’s lap and casually watching TV as Tony himself just sat up straight and tried not to let his eyes fall shut with the exhaustion. Steve smiled in fond exasperation; a minute longer, and Tony was just going to keel over.
“NO!” Steve lurched forward and caught Tony’s hand before he could back away any further, shaking his head wildly, “no, that is not what I meant at all. No. No, I want- I want to be in a relationship with you Tony, I swear, a proper one and everything, I was just… I wanted to check we were on the same page,” he stumbled over his words hurriedly, internally cursing himself for wording it so badly.
. No way. Never. Why the hell would you- Jesus, no,
“So tell me the real reason why you missed out on all this,” Steve said, after a few seconds of silence.
There was nothing physical on his face- of course there wouldn’t be, Steve had been engineered to into perfection- so there was no deep purple bruising under his eyelashes or bloodshot redness to his eyes.
“When I met your dad for the first time, I hated him,” Pops said eventually, still quiet, still calm and collected like he always seemed to be around everyone but  Dad. “I thought he was jerk, thought he was selfish and rude and flashy in the way that everything else in the 21st century was. I hated him because he was the future, and me? I was a guy from the past. We were like oil and water.”
“Yes. Tony…I’m so sor-”
"I haven't- uh- been with anyone for a while. Over a year now," Bruce said, cheeks tinting pink, "I'm very sure."
Blinking blearily, he watched the sunlight filter in through the windows and lifted his head a little, following the sound of a running faucet and the buzzing of a razor. The door to the bathroom was open wide, and Steve spotted Tony leaning over the sink, delicately trimming his goatee into perfection.
One time, he’d overheard Tony talking to his friend Rhodey about one of his dates when they’d been sat nearby one another in bio, and Steve had heard all about how shittily it had gone, which definitely made him feel good. Because not only was Tony Stark an asshole, but the guy he’d been on the date with- Tiberius Stone- was an even
This was ridiculous. And it was all well and good saying they should never have let it get this far, but the truth was, Tony had known all along about the consequences. He’d known and he’d tried to ignore it, deny it. They cared about Peter, sure, but not
Steve looked up, watched everyone nod and then straighten up, the prospect of a new mission close on the horizon. His heart was going a mile a minute under his ribcage, and he wondered whether or not this was all a dream. He’d spent weeks now just waiting for Tony to come home, to show himself, and now that it was all actually here, he felt like it couldn’t be true.
The LMD advanced, but was tackled to the floor by Steve before he could get close to Tony. Natasha scrambled back upright too, aiming her bare foot at his head and slamming it down against the tiled floor. Steve’s face was twisted in pain from the awful high-pitched screaming that JARVIS was blasting, and the immense discomfort was enough to distract him just enough to let the LMD break free of his grip, headbutting Steve viciously. He hissed in pain, reeling back, and a second later the LMD grabbed Natasha’s ankle and squeezed. Tony heard bone break through the room.
Once he felt like he wasn’t being crushed quite so much, the email in front of him was brought back to the forefront of his thoughts. He had to finish it and get it off before midnight at the very least, otherwise about three different people would start yelling at him. Shaking fingers steadied themselves back onto the keyboard, and he lost himself in the steady clicking of keys, not bothering to proofread it before sending the email off five minutes later. He doubted it was even coherent, but hell, at least he’d done it. One little task ticked off the list, only eight hundred more to go.
completely useless.
of it. Hell, she stuck around despite it, if anything. One of the handful of people who like me when I’m sober, I guess. Thor, too- we met whilst we were both depressingly sober. And- and you! So I mean, it’s not… it’s not everyone. It’s not.”
“You’re…” Tony paused on the words, brow creasing a fraction as he stared up at Steve, “you’re so…”
Tony rolled his eyes and pouted. “You think it’s hot," he responded, and then leaned up and kissed Steve’s nose quickly.
Tony at least had the decency to look a little sheepish. “I may have been…slightly presumptuous, yes, but in all fairness, this is barely even illegal. No one’s even been in the house for years except me.”
Once he was back lying down again, the worry slipped off Tony’s face a little, replaced with a smile. It was tired, but genuine. “Good evening,” he said softly, his fingers brushing over Steve’s sternum for a fraction of a second before they paused and then moved away. “how are we feeling, Agent Rogers?”
Slowly- the occurrences stop being so frequent.
Sam shrugged. “I zoned it out, to be honest- if there’s one thing I will never be able to do, it’s mediate an argument between those two. I’m pretty sure some threatening went on though. Possibly name-dropped her knife collection or something. Either way, Clint wasn’t happy. He lost a date.”
Steve curled into Tony’s body a little, eyelids drooping. “We can’t sleep here,” he responded with, because he recognised Tony’s angle, knew that Tony was cunningly aware of the fact he could put Steve to sleep with his combination of beautiful meaningless science-words mixed with some hair petting, “we’re too old for crashing on the couch.”
Slightly dazed and definitely confused, Tony… well- Tony did.
Steve watched as Bruce pulled a face. “How are six people going to fit in that piece of junk?”
“Such as?”
That being said, he probably shouldn’t have been talking about how crap Ty’s dating skills were to Bucky when the guy’s friends had been right behind him in the corridor anyway, hypothetical or not. Because as soon as they saw him again when Steve was alone, they didn’t waste any time with shoving him up against the lockers and then doing their level best to shove him inside one of them.
“Hey!”
“Yep,” Steve looked at Loki, raising an eyebrow, “I’ve met you, haven’t I?”
“‘Kay,” Steve conceded contentedly, before flopping down across Tony once more and pillowing his head against Tony’s chest, “back to sleep now.”
A grin split Tony’s face and he lifted his watch. Four minutes, fifty-four seconds.
Pulling out his phone with shaky hands, he got up Bucky’s number and then slid his fingers over the keyboard, asking his friend to come pick him up outside Tony’s place. Bucky sent a few question marks in response, but Steve just told him he’d explain later, and Bucky, being the good friend that he was, simply gave him an okay and then nothing more.
It was him. It was Tony who was messing up.
Math was… not his subject.
And then, as the realization hit him, he sprang vertically off the couch and landed on his feet with his hands raised. Steve looked up at him in confusion, but Tony just whooped, fist pumping the air. “I remember!” He yelled, looking at the other man in ecstasy, “I remember the suits! Steve! I remember them!”
His head hit something soft, and when he focused back in, he realised it was a chest. “Hello!” The chest said happily, and Steve frowned, “are you well, my friend?”
Blood. There was blood all over his hands, Steve could still see it, even though the water had washed it off. Tony’s brain matter was smeared over Steve’s jacket, which was now neatly bundled into the washing machine, ready to be swept away. His life had simply come and gone. Just like that. Tony Stark was just another speck in the universe, and life had disposed of him- his brilliant mind and his beautiful face and his boundless heart- like it was nothing at all.
Natasha beamed and stood up to undoubtedly go sit on his lap and start a(nother) unnecessary makeout session, but Steve quickly raised a hand and stood up firmly. “Na ah ah ah ah, you stay there, Romanov! If I have to see you sucking my best friend’s tongue one more time I will jump out of the window, I swear to Christ!”
about what I’ve done,” Tony lurched forward on the table, throwing his words angrily at Steve like they were weapons in themselves. But a second later after a truly cowering glare, Tony composed himself again. He sat back in his chair and turned his head away once more, the only indication of his distress being the heaving of his chest. Steve watched as a single tear slipped out of his eye, unable to be held back. Steve followed the path it made down his cheek, collecting in the hairs of his beard.
“Same as I was five minutes ago,” he said, raising an eyebrow, “shitty, but alive, I guess. Silver linings.”
Sam made to move, and got as far as sitting up before stopping and then just giving up with a small shrug of defeat, lying back down again. That seemed to be the general mood of the whole room- everyone was suddenly exhausted, and Steve could feel his own eyelids drooping too.
Mere meters away, Tony hurled himself forward, hands outstretched and eyes wide, terrified.
Ty shook his head and then pushed himself off the wall, marching over to Steve with his whole body tensed up and his arm rising into an arc. Steve stepped forward too- if Ty wanted to fight, then they could fight, Steve wasn’t fucking bothered. He could give as good as he got, thank you very much, and that was what he fully intended to do as he raised his own arm and then reeled it back, preparing to swing.
“Dammit,” Steve muttered. He would turn on his navigation, but data was fucking expensive and, as a result, he just… hadn’t bought any. Yes, that meant he was probably the only teenager in New York who went out without instant internet access, but he’d never really needed it. Before now, anyway.
he muttered to himself as he ran a hand over his face.
They all looked pretty pissed off, if he was being honest.
“I am,” Steve nodded slowly, a small smile on his face as he looked up at his best friend, “I promise.”
They met up with Clint and Nat on the ominously quiet basement stairwell. Tony couldn’t get any readings from the floor due to the anti-infiltration measures that had been put in place, but by the lack of gunfire or mayhem, he was going to go ahead and say it wasn’t swarming, at the very least.
Tony was happy to indulge him though, finding himself having almost as much as fun as Peter was. It was just… cute, watching the kid. Babies laughed at everything- it was incredibly validating, if Tony was being real. Peter was inquisitive, he was cheeky and had a definite personality already. Tony was sort of fascinated by him, and it seemed Peter was just as fascinated by all of the team, too. Over the past few days he’d developed a specific attachment to Natasha and Thor, for some reason. And Tony. Although that was probably just because Tony had a strange glowy light in his chest. Babies were like moths when it came to bright things. Loved ‘em, apparently.
“It’s fine, not broken, just a cut. Could’ve happened to anyone; just unfortunate that’s where I landed, that’s all,” Steve told him, trying to keep his voice calm and reassuring. It didn’t seem to be doing any favours though; Tony just seemed to get more worked up from it.
“Apologise to the car or she’ll stop driving you to school.”
“If I remember correctly, you bought that car
One last time, Tony gave his little hum, and then immediately after Steve felt him switch off again, his hands still curled tight around Steve. He was like that, sometimes- unable to sleep even if you fed him horse tranquillisers some days, and out like a light as soon as you said the word on others. Steve preferred the latter- less hassle, after all.
Tony laughed again. "Thanks for the vote of confidence."
“huh?” Steve asks, a hand cupping the back of Tony’s neck as he tilts his head up and slides a pillow underneath.
It was still shocking, sometimes, to turn around and see the empty shirtsleeve where his husband’s right arm should have been. But Tony was taking it like a champ, and already designing a prosthetic that was slick enough to work just as well, if not better, than an average arm. Because of course he was. That was just Tony Stark. Time travel in a night, Infinity Gauntlet in an evening.
She sighed, looking away with an apologetic face. “Sorry,” she muttered, “I don’t mean to… we’re just-“
Setting up all seven of the sleds wasn’t too difficult. They were heavy, but Steve
Steve placed one hand behind Tony’s neck, kissing him back on their boat, on the lake, with a world at peace after five years of pain. He heard Tony’s heartbeat, and then a second later he picked up Maria’s too, her little body already squirming to move once more, back toward the edge of the boat where could paddle.
It looked like Tony was almost going to argue it, but in the end he just sighed, shoving Steve with a shoulder and sending him onto his ass. “Perhaps,” he muttered sulkily.
He shut his eyes and stroked Steve’s hair off his face, before apologizing quietly and turning him over in order to attach the handcuffs to his back. It probably wasn’t comfortable, but Steve was unconscious. Tony was sure he would understand when he came back to himself. Although, he might not even remember any of this. When Bucky had first gotten out, he’d said he couldn’t remember large swathes of his life. Maybe it would be the same for Steve, which was probably for the best, considering the rather brutal way in which Steve had responded to HYDRA’s experimentation.
“He’s alive,” Carol shouted, and Steve was so grateful for her that he would’ve gotten down on his knees and kissed her feet, “but he needs help, and fast.”
They all looked at one another, their faces dubious. But it was right and they knew it- Peter was just a stranger’s kid who’d been dumped at their doorstep, and they needed to do the right thing and put him somewhere he could be safely relocated.
of that. And I… yeah. Marriage would be cool, right?”
“Stop, stop, ew, don’t talk about kissing in front of me, old people don’t kiss, gross!” Peter squealed, trying to wriggle out of his Pops’ grip as he laughed outright and poked his side.
Tony falls. Steve doesn't catch him.
That was
Steve remained silent, placing his hand on Tony’s and locking their fingers together in acknowledgment. It was always hard to talk about things in the way they seemed to- but he was just grateful Tony had told him at all. It meant a hell of a lot. Especially when that sort of stuff was what put Tony’s life in danger- Jesus, he could still barely believe the stories about his dad-
long year, Steve. I wish I’d had—well, fuck, I wish a lot of things.” He sighed, and then smiled at Steve somewhat tiredly. Steve noticed there was a new scar on his face; a little zigzag one running up from neck to jaw. He wondered how it had happened.
“Oh?” Tony asked, “where have you been? I thought you went straight home.”
The communal floor hit him with a wave of laughter as he stepped inside, and he stared numbly, watching the scene unfold around him. Thor was running around in the massive living room, leaping over couches and vaulting the countertops whilst Steve followed in hot pursuit, Peter tucked firmly into his side. The boy was cackling maniacally, arms outstretched, trying to grab the God of Thunder. “You can’t run forever!” Steve called out to the other man, who only let out a boom of laughter and then army-rolled away from Steve’s swiping hand.
As it turned out though, it was not anything he could have expected. Not in a million years.
Steve looked up and smiled at his entrance, rolling his eyes softly and then turning back to the morning newspaper. “Trying to see what all the hype is about. So far, not so good. You have shit taste.”
Thor just guffawed with laughter- and honestly, how fucking strong was the guy, to be able to just… lift him straight up onto his shoulders? If Steve wasn’t so shocked, he may have complimented Thor on his technique. As it was, he was just clutching around Thor’s head and hoping the boy didn’t decide to drop him suddenly.
In the end though, not even his art could hold him for long, and he ended up calling it a night and going to bed. It was only 8 at night, but he was goddamn tired, thank you very much. It felt like he’d run an emotional marathon. Anyway, he wanted to get up early in the morning so that he could head out and check on Tony before stopping off and visiting Peggy and Bucky later on in the day, and the only way he could feasibly manage waking up on a weekend before 10am was if he got
That was a little more compelling, admittedly. Some very
“You’re a menace,” Steve informed him after he’d opened the window to blow out some of the smoke, “please never try and cook your own meals. You’ll burn your house down.”
Clint laughed, and it pulled him out of his thought spiral as he remembered to throw a peanut shell at the boy. It didn’t deter him, though, because after he’d pulled the little shell from his hair, he just went right back to looking at Steve questioningly. “Come on, man, you’ve been giving us the bare bones for weeks now. We wanna know the details!”
As the alarm started to blare, Steve, Tony and Bucky all groaned in annoyance. “Absolutely fucking
“Considering I am struggling to keep my hands off you for more than 1 minute periods, I’m saying you’re doing pretty well so far,” Tony interspersed each block of words with short kisses that Steve just returned gladly, losing himself to the sensations once more.
He took another breath in, feeling the discomfort when his lungs failed to fill up enough.
“Okay, cool. Uh. I’m outside your door right now, so…” Steve laughed awkwardly, “Just wanted to make sure I was still welcome before I barged in, y’know.”
Tony laughed loudly at that, and Steve frowned a little, before something clicked in his mind and he realized that there was probably a reason Tony found that so funny.
“None, my friend!” Thor said, “I just got bored for a second. Dangerous thing for me to be, really. Would you like me to put you down?”
“I fucking hate you.”
She knelt in front of him, looking him up and down pityingly. He stared back. He would never lose a staring contest with a person from HYDRA.
The woman came back again- this time with two men flanking her. They were holding something. Box. It was a box, big and black and scientific-looking. They type Tony and Bruce kept all their equipment in.
She laughed, raising her fist for him to bump. “Sure thing, Rogers, where do you want me to start? Foot massage? Birthday kiss?”
With a final muttered, “fuck me,” Tony sat up and pulled his phone from his back pocket, calling Pepper up in order to ask her to send him the latest schematics from R&D that he’d been sidelining for the past few weeks. He needed some time to sort his damn head out, re-align himself. And it’d make Pepper happy, at the very least.
“What are you plotting?”
Steve glanced up, looking over at Stark from across the room. He was stood by the doors of what was left of the common room with a half-empty glass of scotch in hand, while the other pressed up against the reactor. Steve had heard what had happened down in the stairwell—he knew that Loki had taken the Tesseract too.
“Okay, I declare the fort fit for use,” Peggy said, jumping down from the table and shaking her hair from her face. “Everyone get in, and that’s an order.”
“I… it’s a date,” Steve agreed, half of him wondering what the hell Tony was even talking about whilst the other just tried not to smile too brightly. Because that wasn’t cool.
In front of them, Steve just blinked a few times, eyes narrowing incredulously. “Excuse me?”
He turned to Tony slowly, and watched the other boy’s eyes fall on him in curiosity. Without a word, Steve lifted his leg and slipped it over Tony’s lap, straddling him.
“Steve, that’s not the point…” Tony sighed and leaned back, head falling back into the pillows. Barely even a minute into consciousness, and Steve could feel the tension leeching back into his body under his hands. It was distressing to watch. “I have responsibilities—I know what I act like, but I do actually give a shit about my company—”
Tony paused for a moment, before jerking to life with a nod and a finger-point in Steve’s direction. “Right! Yes, because I was… doing that, yes, okay, going-“ he started walking back again, not bothering to turn around in favor of keeping his gaze fixed on Steve. The amazed look of disbelief was still flitting around in his eyes as he watched Steve grin back at him.
“Get in, loser, we’re going shopping!” He said happily, whilst Steve just looked on warily.
And right under the signpost, Tony was leaning casually; his collar turned up and his hands tucked away in his pockets as his foot scuffed absently along the pavement, back and forth, back and forth. He was staring at the wall, hair messed up and wild, and when he breathed out, Steve watched a plume of smoke billow from his mouth once more; the tendrils curling and wafting until disappearing into the still night. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut and he leaned his head back against the post, the picture of bliss, if only for a second before it faded back into neutrality. Steve watched him lift slender fingers up to his mouth, slot the cigarette between his lips and suck a deep breath inward, before repeating the action of before, throat exposing itself as he tipped his head back once again.
He didn’t like hearing that Steve wasn’t okay. He could see, and he was aware of it it (very,
. He was really going to hate himself when he worked out how to breathe properly again.
“I want to give you everything, though,” Tony spoke desperately, and when he looked up at Steve, it made him feel like he was something holy, “it- it scares me, how much you mean to me.”
Steve was stood at the counter, stubbornly refusing to turn and look at any of them. Tony could hear his breathing. “Uh, Steve, hey- just take a breather, okay Cl-”
He stayed at there for a long, long time.
It was at the point where Sam was having to yank Clint’s ear in order to stop him from throwing a bag of chips at Natasha’s head when Steve felt Tony’s hand settle on the back of his neck, stroking softly. Of course, it invoked an involuntary shiver and smile, and when he turned his head to look at his boyfriend, Tony’s face was mirroring his own.
Steve chuckled and then yawned immediately after, checking the clock. 9:13 AM. They had the whole day ahead of them. “I like that plan,” he answered as he pulled back the covers and then slipped fluidly out of bed, standing straight and stretching up to the sky in order to crack his joints. He himself was only wearing some faded Thor-Themed sweatpants, and he had no doubt that his hair was sticking up on end as if a bird had been making its home there that night. His bedhead was always a damn nightmare.
Tony wanted to be pissed, but he was too curious. “What was the word?”
“Tony, stop,” Steve told him, and Tony did. Immediately.
come home to Peter.
Tony just sighed. “I’m sorry I hurt you,” he said, which was probably all he’d heard before shutting off. Steve bit back on the urge to groan in despair- Tony was the king of self-blame, and no doubt he’d be feeling guilty about this for weeks to come.
Tony had been late back from the gala and was a little more drunk than usual, thanks to meeting some old friends from back at MIT there. It’d been a fun night, if he was being honest- more fun than how those sorts of things usually went, anyway. He should have told Steve he’d be late though. Although, in all honesty, he’d thought the most he’d get was an exasperated sigh and a gentle request for Tony to
“I’d like that,” he said with a nod, and Thor looked surprised for a second- as if he’d expected Steve to reject him in his moment of weakness, “I, uh, I’ve been trying to give myself an excuse to ask someone to come along all day, but…” he puffed out his cheeks and then blew sharply, looking sheepish, “pride and all that. Don’t really want to have to ask for- well, anything, really.”
“Were you talking to someone?” Tony asked a moment later, before his eyes narrowed. “JARVIS? What were you gossiping to Steve about? They better have been good things.”
much, though, or I would totally be having my way.”
Tony grinned and then leaned forward to access the bag of onions in the cupboard underneath where he was sat. He waved them around. “You’ll have to work for them,” he informed the other boy, winking when Steve cocked his head, “and I warn you; don’t get side-tracked nearly as easy as—”
Tony, with a lack of anything to say, simply pulled a face and then stood up again, going over to the kitchen in the other room with Peter still tucked into his arm. The baby seemed to be pretty happy, letting off little gurgles and babbles of nonsensical noises now and then as Tony walked them through into the other room. He noticed that a highchair had been set up, and so popped Peter’s butt down on it before going about making two coffees. “How was your day, squirt?” He asked wearily, back turned as he grabbed his and Steve’s mugs, “anything interesting happen? You met Thor yet? He’s fun. Just don’t let him try and convince you into holding his hammer. It’s just embarrassing.”
—confidence in me right now. I’m glad I’ve got you two and your wonderful bedside manners to keep me company while I slowly contract sepsis.”
There would not be a second.
“—to try, even if it doesn’t work out, even if—”
Fuck.
“Life’s kicked you down, buddy,” Rhodey looked at them all, then glanced at the door where the intercom was just beginning to buzz with the arrival of what had to be the rest of their friends. “Luckily though, you’ve got about nine different people who are gonna do everything they can to help you back up. You’re not gonna be alone through this. Not ever.”
“Oh, baby,” he whispered sadly, knowing that Tony probably hadn’t slept well ever since steve had started acting like the world’s shittiest boyfriend, three weeks ago now.
A second later, and he was looking at the separate parts and mechanics of the Iron Man suit. From a scientific point of view, he saw how it all worked, and as he pushed through the horrible throb at the back of his eyes, he almost managed to piece a few of the bits of information together. But as soon as he looked away and attempted to remember it, the knowledge slipped away. He cursed loudly and then looked back, starting again.
Tony blinked. Steve had been talking, huh? “Uh. There was… tree? Something about a tree?” He tried, and when Steve laughed in response, Tony smiled back at him instinctively.
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Oh, you can cook, can you?”
have moved it that fast, I—I don’t—” Tony broke off, letting out a shaky breath. “I know what I saw. But it doesn’t make sense.”
"And I take it Zeke was fucking around with him, then?" Steve pushed, and the way Tony's lip curled in distaste gave away the truth instantly.
, Steve wasn’t one of them, “you’re gonna leave? Where to? Who are you going to go to, Tony? This is our home. You and me, we’re the foundations of this place, the glue that holds this team together. You know that. And you really say you’re going to just... leave?”
“Hey, look, that’s not… I…” Steve spluttered, suddenly feeling the guilt pooling in his gut. Rhodey was right. He shouldn’t have left. Fuck, what if Tony hadn’t managed to do what Howard had asked? Howard had said he was gonna kill him- and Steve figured that was an exaggeration, but that didn’t matter. Steve had still just left Tony when he needed him.
“I seem to recall you puling
Which he did. Thank god.
Steve bit his lip, tasted the tang of copper burst under his tongue. Times like these, he missed Bucky. He’d always been Steve’s voice of reason, but he was currently still touring in Afghanistan. It was just Steve.
Tony was fucking stupid. He’d told himself he wouldn’t mess this one up, and look at him. Already failed, and through nothing but his own stupid behaviour. He absolutely did not blame Steve for this. Considering the fact that he got enough shit from every other Baseliner in the world, he had no reason to put up with it from Tony. God- he’d essentially told Steve to just lie down and take the mocking for the day so that Tony could have his fun. What kind of boyfriend—
He breathed through his nose and kept his face covered. Eventually, he just forced out the words “I’m fine. Thank you.”
Tony huffs. “Sap.”
“What?” Tony jutted out his chin, stepping forward. “What the hell do you mean, ‘this is your fault’?”
Yeah, he figured- they held hands at school. Tony kissed him on the forehead before he left sometimes. He didn't go for the contact when they were in full view of a lot of people, no, but Steve just figured that was because he didn't want people getting up in his business about it like they usually did. Life of the rich and famous; barely anything was private.
He was not disappointed. Although obscured by the couch, Tony didn’t fail to miss the cone-shaped blanket that poked upward and told him there was a God of Thunder wrapped underneath, and he shook his head fondly as he wandered further in. Thor was hunched up on the couch, his pale blue blanket swaddled around his midsection and head and leaving a trail of sheets flowing around him. He stared vacantly at the large screen up ahead, which was showing the cartoon animals beating each other up in a way only very young children and, apparently, Thor, found amusing, and his mouth was hung open vacantly while his hand remained half-extended sideways, pulling Peter back by the shirt every time the boy started to crawl too close to the edge of the armrest.
When Steve was supposed to turn left in the corridor, however, he turned right instead. He wasn’t sure at what point during the walk he made that decision- maybe whilst he had been thinking of the way he’d have to look happy when Director Fury praised the excellent way in which he’d brought Tony Stark into their custody in under 48 hours- but whatever it was, it was a strong enough compulsion that it sent Steve in the totally opposite direction. He marched confidently over to the entrance of the stairwell on the other side of the corridor, nodding to his colleagues as he passed them, and then continued the same brisk pace as he started to make his way downward, going through floor 1, floor 0, before finally arriving at his destination on the level underneath the compound. Fury would probably chew him out later for missing the meeting, but Steve couldn’t really say that was the most pressing matter on his mind just then.
Tony nodded imperceptibly, the final proof that this was it; that Tony truly did trust him blindly. After all these years, all the hardships, Tony was letting Steve hold his hand on the battlefield and obeying his word, even it killed both of them.
“I’m going out,” Steve told him sharply, shaking his turned head and grabbing his coat from the rack. “I need a fucking breather. Please don’t follow me.”
He glanced behind him, watching Steve as he sat up in bed, the frown back on his face. “What are you doing?” He asked, voice full of sleepiness.
“Sir,” JARVIS spoke up again, “may I suggest contacting Mister Rhodes and Miss Potts. I feel as if they would want to be informed on the current situation—”
Who the fuck called at 7am anyway? On a
There was a moment of silence in the kitchen, nothing other than the faint sounds of Peppa Pig in the background as everyone stewed on his statement. It was Steve who got to it first. “Xavier,” he said, blinking in realisation, “of course. He’d know what to do about this, right?”
give in and let
God, his ribs hurt. Tears were burning in his eyes, and he felt like his heart was going to sink through the floor. Everything was just so
Was trapped even the right word? Was that JARVIS’ home? Steve had no idea how AI’s worked— hell, no one else on Earth except Tony did, really. “Are you cramped in there?” He asked, looking at the device. It wasn’t a standard laptop, that was for sure. Tony must have built it from scratch so that it would be able to hold a program as complex as JARVIS. But still, it was vastly smaller to the machine in Tony’s room, or the space JARVIS had had in the workshop.
Above him, Tony’s jaw was tight, and Steve internally cursed himself out. He should have just dropped it. “It doesn’t matter, you’re right, sorry, I was just—”
Bad. That was… that was probably bad.
“Shut it, Carter.”
Steve gaped at him in bewilderment. Why the hell would Tony offer up something like that? It made no sense. Not only was Steve going off on the whim of a genocidal Norse Demi-God, but also, Tony didn’t really owe him shit. They weren’t friends. Steve had been an asshole to him and Tony had been an asshole back.
And Steve hadn’t connected any of the fucking dots. Hadn’t realized it could be anything more than skittishness that often came from abuse survivors.
“You’re a really good friend, Steve,” he declared, “I don’t think you fully realize the extent to which you’ve changed mine and Tony’s life. Before you- well- all we had was each other, really. Tony had Rhodey and Pepper too, but they were away pretty often, and everyone else around us just…sucked.” He laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “We never really had a group of people that we could count on, before you and your friends came along . So. Thanks for that, I guess.”
He checked his watch. Sam would be out at the gym by this point, and Mr and Mrs Wilson were working late tonight too, which meant that no one would be in the house when he got back. He sighed to himself- spending time alone right now didn’t seem like a particularly appealing idea, but he didn’t really feel like conversation either. Sometimes it was just too tiring to try and think of things to say.
“That’s my jacket,” he said dumbly, blinking a few times as he registered the dark red button-up Tony had strung over his forearm. “Why… but they took that.”
Tony grinned at him, and try as he might, Steve couldn’t help but grin back. “Look,” the other boy said, pointing a hand out to the space in front of them, “look at our city, Steve.”
. That’s…” he chuckled, running a hand through his hair. “It’s not great for my ego. Plus I’m ugly now. These bruises aren’t even the hot kind.”
Tony was breathing heavily. Obviously now the drugs had worn off a little and he was in the middle of a pretty severe comedown. He looked like shit- tired eyes and slightly pale face, but with cheeks flushed an angry red. He turned his head down and stared at Steve for a few moments, probably debating whether or not to start telling at him instead- but in the end he just pushed off turned on his heel.
He nodded, taking a large breath in through his nose. In and out. In and out.
Tony just wanted to stay in bed with him, and forget about the rest of the world. But, unfortunately, that wasn’t how things worked. Not any more.
Steve paused, biting his lip. He could just brush it off, he figured. Tony would probably know he was lying, but he’d understand all the same. And Steve really didn’t want to bother Tony with the same old stupid stuff- ‘my mom’s dead and I’m sad about it again, blah blah blah’- he must surely be getting bored of that by now.
Tony sighed, palming a hand over his face as he stood up. “I’m the world’s leading technology expert,” he grumbled to Peter, propping the little boy up into his arms and reaching up to the condiment cupboard, “I’ve changed society, you know that right? Revolutionised science. This? This is not what I was put on this Earth for, and I want a full-blown apology later, you hear me?”
Beside Steve, he watched Thor’s face as it cracked. “So our friend is dead because this man could not handle his own grief,” he snarled, anger layered over his mourning. Thor and Tony had always been close. “Now Steve is in the exact same place because that fucking scumbag wanted—”
Tony said nothing again, and Steve wondered whether he was going to argue further- but then, instead, he coughed. “It will go right,” he muttered emptily, “I promise. Don’t worry about it.”
own, and generally make a very large show of being someone that he doesn’t want to question, for fear of also being sued for everything he owns. Can you do that?”
“They suit you,” Steve says quietly,and Tony has to question whether or not he’s even conscious at this point, because that was
“If you watched your friend’s whole life fall to pieces at the whim of a man who never learned what the word ‘no’ meant, I wonder—would you sit there and do nothing?” She stared at him, those piercing eyes boring a hole into Fury. “Because you don’t seem the type for that, Sir.”
Walking out of the door, he slipped the jacket through his arms and tried not to blush when his hands barley reached to the other end of the sleeves. It looked about five sizes too big for him.
Peter writhed in Tony's arms, and he pulled another face as he tried to settle him with gentle noises that did absolutely nothing. "Bruce can't do shit, he's not a pediatrician," Tony stood off the bed as well, turning to face Steve with the squirming mass tucked against his chest. "Look, can you hold him for a second? I have no idea what I'm doing-"
“You say that every time, kid,” Paul cut in, and God, he sounded exhausted, “just yesterday, you told us this wouldn’t happen again. Then less than 24 hours later, you’ve been suspended for fighting with exactly the same boy.”
Honestly, he’d just wanted to be able to sit with pops and make sure he was okay- let him stroke his hair and quiet his worries and say how tough he was, that he wouldn’t go down that easy. But instead he’d had to be hurried away by Uncle bruce, who was rolling his eyes and apologizing on behalf of them, saying that he’d be able to talk to his pops soon, but it wasn’t a good time right now.
“Next time it gets as bad as it did, please,
“Tony, sweetheart, I love you, but you gotta stop using the internet slang Peter tells you or I’m going to have to divorce you first.”
Tony got back to his feet first, helping Steve to his and then holding tight to his hand as he guided them both out of the darkness of their room. Steve followed, legs still feeling horribly unsteady as he walked- but he concentrated on the steady beat of Tony’s pulse under his fingers instead, letting it rush over him like a lullaby. He made sure not to close his eyes for too long, in case the memories flooded into the backs of his eyelids. He was tired, definitely, but sleep could wait. He just needed… Tony.
I KNOW THAT, STEVE!” Tony had yelled, spinning over to him with fire in his eyes as he’d pulled up his top lip and looked at Steve in fury, “If that hadn’t occurred to me when someone stuck a big hunk of metal in my chest, or when I got sucked into a black hole and saw what the other side of the universe looked like, or when Thanos came and stabbed me through the fucking chest, then you’ll bet I realised it when
He waved back fondly, rolling his eyes as they all bounded away again a few moments later, pushing and shoving at one another. God only knew how they still had the energy to run around anywhere- still young and full of life, he figured.
on his forehead whilst not breaking eye contact with the girl currently holding onto his arm as if she wasn’t even able to stand on her own.
“September 12
Silence fell once more, heavy and thick. Steve wanted to say a million things. Wanted to say that he didn’t deserve Tony’s admiration. That he would do it all over again in a heartbeat if he had to, even if this time Tony left without him. He wanted to tell him that leaving him in the first place had been the biggest, most stupid decision of his life, and he’d never wanted to hurt Tony to the extent that he had.
“Not, I mean, not like… well, it’s just… he’s usually… not known for-“
Smiling to himself, he shoved Sam off and sat up, brushing down the mess his hair had become. “Is that someone’s phone?” He asked everyone, hearing the vibrating noise.
Tony leaned back, hands bracing behind him as he stared at the machine and smiled in reminiscence. “Pep started out as an intern for Stark Industries. Met me whilst I was- uh- getting high in my dad’s office.” He grinned, shutting his eyes, “I thought she was going to rat me out at first, but after a second of staring at me, she just locked the door and then asked for a drag. Weed is the best bonding material, seriously- nothing like getting baked together to solidify a friendship.”
Even though a part of him knew it wasn’t going to be enough. Even though he knew he was too far away.
“You didn’t take him to a hospital?” Bruce asked incredulously.
Steve’s fault.
you to do this, Natasha. I can’t go out there in front of the cameras, okay—that alone would be enough evidence to lock me up for the rest of my life. But if you just cut them, then I get some more time—”
“Hey Tony, Steve,” he said, looking down at them for a moment before turning back to the rest, “what are you guys doing indoors at break? Thought you’d be out on the quad getting your hourly nicotine fix?”
The nightmares he knew he was going to get didn’t exactly help either.
Yeah, Tony was on the same page. He clenched his jaw and then fired a warning blast at the approaching threat; not enough to hurt, but enough to make him spend a few seconds recovering. Tony shot Steve a sympathetic glance, but the man just returned it with a snarl and then leaped forward once more, fearless, devastating. Tony had to act fast—any longer, and Steve could get in a hit that might actually end up affecting him. That was the last thing either of them needed. “Baby, I’m sorry about this. You’ll be fine, I just—
“Slow down,” he said anyway, his voice sounding way too urgent over those 2 stupid extra miles, and Steve turned to him in mild confusion before taking his foot off the peddle just a little. He watched the speedometer go back to the limit, feeling like a complete fucking idiot.
Steve nodded,”you had any trouble?”
He had to. This was all he had left now. His ideas. He was an asshole and he pissed everyone off and without the Iron Man suit there was a shockingly low number of things that Tony had going for him, but even with all that, he still had his inventions. He built training programs for the whole team, specified for them. Welded a few new plates for Bucky’s arm to increase dexterity. Redesigned Steve’s suit with stronger fibres that absorbed impact better.
“Please don’t ever think that we don’t care about the person under the suit,” Steve murmured into his hair, arms wrapping protectively around Tony’s waist, “we do. More than you could possibly know. You’re family, Tony.”
He felt like whatever he did these days, it just made things worse.
It was Tony. It was going to be absolutely fine.
Tony really did trust him. Despite… everything that had happened in his life, Tony had still chosen to let him in.
It was just… Peter was a baby. Peter was the purest form of human goodness you could get, where he’d done
“How did you get this number?” He asked, completely bewildered, “you’re… you’re a computer program.”
It made feel Tony feel dirty.
This made no sense. “Tony, sweetheart, please, come on,” he tried weakly, like a child. Like a dying man. He gave the unresponsive body a gentle shake, and expected Tony to make a fuss, maybe cuss at him for waking him up. He wasn’t exactly a morning person. “Come on, wake up.”
I trust you. I trust you enough to want to spend my life with you, is that not evidence enough?”
A hand settled on his stomach, and Rhodey’s eyebrow cocked. “You heard the woman,” he said, and with an irritated grunt, Tony lay back down again. “HYDRA haven’t shown so far,” the man continued, “but we’re preparing for the worst until help comes. I doubt they’d have just given up after the first failed attempt. This is their shot now. They’re gonna take it.”
Tony shuffled on to the bed, throwing all doubts out of the window as he burrowed down into Steve’s arms, forehead pressed up against Steve’s chest.
Steve’s mind registered the voice at the same time Rumlow did, but although it may have been said in the nick of time for Steve, it was also in the worst possible moment for Rumlow. The man turned his head in surprise at the new robotic voice, and as he did so, Tony lurched forward, clad in the Iron Man suit he had managed to call from the gaping hole that was now in the window. Red and Gold hands clenched around Rumlow’s own, yanking him violently away from Steve. Rumlow didn’t have a hope in hell of fighting him. This was a fresh suit, undoubtedly sent from whichever hidey-hole Tony had on the East coast. It was pure metal, tech and power that clenched down upon his body and threw him sideways. With a yelp of pain, Rumlow hit the plaster wall, creating a dent against the grey paint as he collided with it. Tony did not wait for him to regain his balance. Striding forward, he grabbed Rumlow by the collar, lifting him into the air. The man’s feet kicked uselessly at the metal exoskeleton, fingers scrabbling for the face-plate.  But it was useless.
“Then don’t say dumb things!” Tony told him, trying to hold back a smile as Steve pouted at him and gave what Clint had called his ‘Tony Face’.
Steve had been going to tell him, when it had all been cleared up. He had. It was important—more than important, it was vital that Tony knew. For closure’s sake. Tony still had files about the brake system of the car that had killed them, and every year on their anniversary, he pulled it up and looked through it again, just to see if he’d missed anything in the last twenty years.
