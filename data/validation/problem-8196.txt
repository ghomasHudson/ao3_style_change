He picked up from where Steve had left off, plating the scrambled eggs and bacon before washing up, taking his time to scrub the sink and wipe down the surfaces. It was so annoying, like unfinished sentences or incomplete puzzles, when things were done half-heartedly.
When he finally came back down to earth, he began making improvements. “The main transducer feels sluggish. Hull pressurisation is problematic. Icing is the probable factor.”
Thank you to the wonderful Serinah for beta-reading this and all her suggestions! Thank you to AvengersNewB for her advice on summaries!
Tony smiled fondly at Steve as he noted the tear tracks on Steve’s pink cheeks. There was no hiding the red-rimmed eyes and the lower lip that continued to tremble. For some reason, it bothered Tony, so before another word could escape those quivering lips, red and swollen from all that biting, Tony had closed the gap.
There was only one thing they could do.
Mist shrouded the night sky, and it obscured the moon and stars. Assembled on the deck of
“This is where I go kick ass!” Tony said, and leapt off after Peter and Ivan as they flew past. He stayed hot on Ivan’s tail, ready to support Peter should the moment arise.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve nodded. His husband was right. Emperor Thanos would be back, probably with twice as many beasts next time. It was a realisation that should strike fear deep in his heart. But his faith was in people - and Valoria was home to Earth’s mightiest heroes.
He spent his days in and out of sleep, finding it impossible to summon enough strength to leave the bed. In the dark, he could pretend his parents were still alive, holidaying in the Bahamas.
“It’s okay, Steve. It’s perfectly okay not to be okay sometimes.”
will equal to yours.”
“We'll need a team,” Tony pointed out, cognizant of the insurmountable obstacles and overwhelming odds stacked up against them.
Tony’s blurry eyes drifted to Steve’s mussed-up hair and his blue eyes shimmering with tears in a scene that was only too familiar.
When Tony heard keys turning in their lock at two in the morning, he burst out of his bedroom and hurried down the stairs.
Tony felt all the air rushing out of his chest as he gawked at the letters remaining on the beach. “I am Tyranaksthon?” he said, and the uttered words invoked the transformation. Without the medallion around his neck to suppress his magical abilities, he began to change.
The walk to took longer than expected, with Tony stumbling occasionally to keep up with Obie’s punishing pace.
“So, that’s why they need iridium as a stabilising agent. So the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. And it can open as wide and stay open for as long as Loki wants-” Steve was saying, looking charming in his uniform as he spouted science stuff.
But Tony stood his ground, refusing to cower, or be trapped in a corner ever again.
He didn’t get to.
“What's it going to cost?”
The depressed spot beside him was still warm. Steve must have stayed all night as he'd promised.
Steve had never referred to him by that name, so Tony was surprised the first time he’d heard it, in the recordings of that highway fight.
Killiniladrach (Aldrich Killian)
Ivan struck the boat, and their mouths fell open as it went up in flames.
Steve remained a picture of calm. “No, no. This is Valoria,” he said.
“Are we really all alone?” Tony asked as he marvelled at the white, sandy beach, completely empty. “Where are all the loving couples?”
Thor turned red and Bruce turned green, so Tony intervened, trying to contain the situation before it spun out of control. “Guys, it’s fine. We’re okay. Can we just focus on the mission right now?”
“I don’t understand,” Steve said in a soft voice. “Why would he tell you that? He never even told me he knew you,” he added, his mouth tight.
Landing on the soft grass just outside of Shieldberg’s walls, Tony felt the weight of the world lifting from his wings, which disappeared into his shoulders as he returned to his human form. And as they crossed the threshold, hand in hand, Tony paused to gaze at his hand, bare but for the single gold band around his ring finger. It glowed softly in the moonlight, and looked brighter in the absence of those dazzling stones.
But his voice was lost in the wind.
“Okay, fine. It’s an alliance. So, treat it as one. The prince is bringing along his inventions, his weapons, his men, and they will help us win the war. We’ll take care of him, treat him as family.”
“Who are you?” Steve asked.
“They didn’t give you my suit?”
“The hell I can’t!” Tony shouted back. “I’m your mate! And that supersedes everything! What if something were to happen to you? What am I going to do without you by my side?”
Rhodey nodded. “Neither are we.”
She began CPR while waiting for the medics to take his lifeless body to the emergency room. There, they watched, with bated breath, as the professionals tried (unsuccessfully) to revive him.
Glaive dodged the shield easily, and smirked at them as the weapon spun out of range. That was inconvenient, but not a hurdle they couldn’t cross. Tony only had to fly around for Steve to –
It had been more of a sapling then, like the one Steve grew in Kingsgarden. Back then, the single seed on the ground had been the only sign of its first bloom, but now, it towered proudly above the others, and its long branches reached for the heavens as glossy green leaves dangled from them like emeralds in the light.
. So, here is the antidote, courtesy of Bruce,” he said, brandishing the syringe in his hand, before swiping his arms with some alcohol swabs.
The prince was looking at him expectantly, and Steve was confused. Bucky and Sam jostled for the best position to watch something, but Steve couldn't figure for what. It was Clint and his puckered-up lips, who finally reminded him that it was time for the customary kiss.
“The Infinity Spell. With the dragonstones. Thanos was going to use it. Can we - can we use it too – for Tony?” he asked.
Nat came to his rescue with a handkerchief and glared daggers at Clint, who bowed his head and looked suitably chastened, and Bucky, who just looked away, with two spots of pink high on his cheeks.
Together, they flew across the Raging Serpent and into the forest, where trees rushed by in a mess of twisted, tangled branches that struggled for life in the barren woods.
(brow raise, brow raise, eyeroll).
Steve ignored him and decided to eye the other dragons instead. “Who are your friends?” he asked.
Wave after wave crashed into him, as the blood meant to transport oxygen and nutrients through his body began killing him on the inside. There were small lulls that gave him hope, until the surging tides would come again and cruelly extinguish that brief spark.
“He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of,” Strange finished quietly.
“Give it back,” Tony huffed, and snatched the bun out of the sorcerer’s hands so he could take a bite from it. “Steve has the best buns in the house,” he declared defensively.
On the sounding of horns, the riders were off.
He looked up at the sound of Steve clearing his throat. The captain had been looking at the suit, appreciative eyes roving over the connections and curves for more than a few minutes. He could tell Steve was having trouble keeping his hands off the metal. Steve was so tactile. He just loved to touch.
Tony forced his lips into a smile. “Yeah. Sorry. Had to get some air.”
With a face full of confident determination, Thanos raised his forearms, and blinded those present with four dazzling dragonstones. It was a reminder that even with only four gems, he could turn them to ash with a single clap.

is taking a little long,” Nat quipped.
Steve nodded.
The armchair had once been the hull of a retired warship, salvaged and made into castle furniture. Steve was particularly fond of the wood grain, dyed a sombre brown and all of its salt-soaked swirls.
“What did he tell you?” Tony asked, looking sideways at Steve, who was smiling affectionately at the former Russian spy.
“Oh, I’ll finish, if you let me,” Steve whispered and proceeded to kiss his neck as he squeezed his ass through his braies.
Tony covered his eyes, blinded by the sudden burst of light flashing in the darkness, calling him home. He felt the tension leaving his body as he sank into a warm pair of arms, allowing the fatigue to take over.
Thanos roared as his bulbous eyes rolled back into their sockets. His gleaming purple scales turned a grimy shade of grey as the magical sword buried at the back of his neck, kept in place by Steve’s strong arms, began to drain the emperor of his powers.
Tony was having a dream.
Dilated pupils. Flushed cheeks. A sharp intake of breath. “Oh. Anthony. Just Steve is fine,” he said, looking as though he was about to faint.
“It’s been leased out to Aldrich Killian.”
He kept it all together even at the worst of times. But days and weeks of solitary confinement caused his world to shrink, and it reduced him to sobbing over the most insignificant of things.
Tony roared on instinct, and the resulting flames danced towards Obie and the sky. Taking advantage of the fact that Obie had frozen mid-air, seemingly taken aback by Tony's manoeuvres, he swerved sharply and slotted himself in and out of the gaps between the towering columns emerging from the sea. As he turned back, Tony tried roaring again, and fireballs shot out of his mouth this time, which narrowly missed Obie, who fired back almost immediately.
“Then target
The armour began falling from Tony’s body, with two taps of the ring, crumbling into a heap on the rooftop, beside a familiar circular object. Tony picked it up quietly, flinging it away in the opposite direction, while Killian, oblivious to his surroundings, began complaining about the
Their guests followed Steve into the house, and gathered around the dining table, while Steve and Tony found chairs and tableware to accommodate them.
“Yes,” Steve whispered through lips swollen from being bitten. “They lose their magic.”
“That thing does not obey the rules of Science,” Peter said, landing beside them. “That means - it’s magic!” The dragonet tapped against the shield with a talon and his eyes widened in awe. “It’s dragonbone, of the celestial variety - the really, really rare stuff that stores and releases the magic it encounters.”
“Is everything a joke to you?”
Despite his poor appetite, Steve forced himself to partake of the food. He had no wish to squander the efforts of the well-meaning townsfolk. Neither did he wish to worry his dear mother and friends.
has got its flaw, a chink in its armour. I’m taking the nuke to the thermal exhaust port.”
“But everything special about you - came - out - of - a - bottle,” he said, punctuating the words like stabs to the heart.
It was inspiring to think about what the stones could do, but all Steve could focus on was something far closer to home. “Do you – do you know how?” he asked, interrupting Pietro’s story.

“I'm not sure what you mean. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want.”
After that, they got him settled into his old room at his parents’ home. In bed, he reviewed the messages on his
“Look at how it spins and it rises,” Tony whispered. “It’s been going a long time, that’s amazing, but eventually, it has to fall.”
Steve’s eyes flitted over to the swans. “I think we would dance. And maybe, if you wanted, I would kiss you.”

“Put on the suit,” Steve repeated, a little more impatiently this time. “Venice awaits. And we have a bond to mend.”
, Steve and his warriors waited in the cool hours before dawn for a sign.
“Captain," the director said. "We're just gathering everything related to the tesseract. It doesn't mean we want to make weapons.”
“You…” she growled, as she bared her teeth.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Whatever she used to do, she's one of us now,” Clint added. "But you're trespassing in this city and on our land."
“This could take days,” Rhodey warned, as he returned from an aerial survey of their numbers.
"I’ll work on it. All the time," Steve promised. "You make me want to be a better person, the best version of myself. Until I come close to being worthy. I’m sorr -,”
He stared in disbelief at the printed words, already beginning to smudge with the falling of hot tears. Heart sinking to the bottom of his stomach, it felt like he was plunging from the wormhole all over again.
The queen held out her hand, which he kissed in greeting. “We know that the valiant efforts of you and your warriors have kept our flags flying on our soil.”
“Tony? Cap? We need backup. Ground floor,” Rhodey’s voice came into the earpiece again. “Now.”
Steve gazed upward and offered him a salute, before he  moved on to his next target, and continued to rack up the hits. He was in the prime of his life - looking fit and determined and most importantly, quite unscathed.
Tony’s eyes swept over the line of razor-sharp ridges along his back toward the arrow-shaped spike at his tail. “Sorry,” he said, trying not to squeak. “Do I know you?” he asked, as he took a second look at the vaguely-familiar reptilian face.
Bruce made a bit of a noise. “Winter is coming,” he said, somewhat ominously.
, the young lady had to be
“A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exoskeleton.”
Yet, when Wanda pulled at the thread again and he felt his mind beginning to unravel, he found himself pulling right back.
“I know," Peter said, while biting down on his lower lip. "I still can't believe I kept this secret from you for so long. I hate keeping secrets. And it looks like after all these years, I’m still terrible at it.”
“Tony?” Steve broke in, awkwardly, eyes fixed on the visitor. “Is this who I think it is?”
Steve raised his arm as if to swing his shield, only to have it caught by Thanos. With a loud snort, Thanos ripped the offending weapon from the king’s clenched fingers.
And then he laughed at how Steve, perhaps the most terrifying alpha in the history of alphas, but also secretly a golden retriever puppy, could protect him without even being there.
“He’s cracked, J. He’s been absolutely rotten.”
Abruptly, he got out of his chair, and excused himself to check on the oven that was bursting with the aroma of freshly-baked rolls. They were ready, as expected, so he placed the disc-shaped buns on a large tray to serve their guests with. Together with the eggs and steak, it would make a satisfying meal.
Sam snorted. “Smooth,” he said.
As Tony turned back to look at him, Steve waved cheerfully, even as the tears began to fill his eyes. Helpless, he could do nothing but watch the love of his life walking away and blurring, fading right in front of him.
“Captain Rogers is a good man. He’ll take care of you.”
… 58, 59, 60 …
“Yeah. Why wouldn’t I be?”
“I need backup,” he shouted into the comms. ‘Helicarrier C. Steve is down. And – And Winter is here.”
Earlier that day, Tony had waved at the team from the window of the quinjet, with Iron Man clearly visible in the seat behind. Then, Tony put on the suit, dropped out of the escape hatch and flew by the Malibu mansion before heading right back for the Avengers Tower, as Iron Man this time.
They had only gone a few steps before encountering a problem - a big one.
But the countdown had started, and they were past the point of no return.
“And currently engaged with the stunning Miss Romanov," Killian said, cutting him off. "Can’t blame him, you know? They’ve got so much in common, being Avengers. Just like how you and I have so much in common, as inventors.”
Tony did, however, find something else. A silver box, with a glass cutout. On it were etched the words: PROOF THAT TONY STARK HAS MY HEART
And clearly, he had failed.
Flying in the opposite direction was a dracanix, just like their ally on the
losing the element of surprise.”
“Ah-hahaha! Puny baddies! You guys doomed now!” the Hulk called out gleefully to Proxima Midnight, as her undead warriors began to falter, thus leaving the Anguisians with a small army of trolls and stone-giants to continue the attack.
For a few seconds, Steve mulled over the question. “Tony,” he said. “I am glad, I really am, grateful even, that you were there that day. But, you have to understand. I can’t. There's no way I can put you on the team.”
It only took a few beats of his wings for Tony to pull up beside him, where Steve could launch his shield at the dragon’s thick skull. Tony followed up with a jet of dragonfire, but the dragon veered away sharply, so Tony only managed to scorch the tips of his wings.
Then, he hit
“So, genocide,” Steve muttered.
Steve’s nimble fingers were already undoing the laces of Tony’s shirt. As his hands brushed against the medallion, it glowed from his touch.
“How do I look?” Steve asked, when he marched past him again, and Tony had to reach for his arm to get him to stop.
Tony nodded. “Until the world does end, I have to act as if it intends to keep on spinning.”
The flames rose in a crescendo, and burned brightly before going out in a brilliant flash of white. Steve blinked slowly, as he allowed his eyes to get used to the dim lighting. The flames were gone, like the stones, and the crucible too.
Max couldn’t fly up to him, not with his wings encumbered by the narrow gorge. His attempts of telekinesis had been rudely rebuffed, with the young dragon wailing in terror and twisting out of the way each time he found himself being lifted off the cliff’s edge.
What was he thinking? Telling Steve that all his special qualities came from a bottle. It was a pathetic insult. And what was worse, was that it wasn’t even true.
Tony would cross that bridge when he got to it. Till then, he would keep his mind open and his heart free.
Killian stumbled backwards, shocked by the impact of the successive shots, still unaware of what had happened to his body. “You will never -,” he began, faltering, before taking the one-step shortcut to the lobby.
Sarah’s face took on a grave expression. “I wish we had more time,” she said, with a loud sigh, “but you need to steel yourself for what’s coming. It's not going to be easy married to a king of warriors whose greatest glory is a beautiful death.”
He recited the words, one by one, in impeccably-polished Russian. He’d practised, made sure he’d said them right. There was no room for mistakes.
Carter’s
Steve hesitated as he glanced at Strange’s dwindling supply, wondering if they were better off reserving the fluid for Tony’s treatment. “I don’t think –” he began.
It led Steve to wonder if it had all been some sort of bad dream. There was no fire, no medallion, no Tony.
“Tony,” Steve warned, his voice stern. “I won’t have you talking about yourself like that. It’s not true and you know it. I think I know what might have happened. We can find out tomorrow.”
“Unavailable.”
“Your ranks?” Tony asked, breathlessly.
from falling off the cliff."
“JARVIS, target identification.”
Strange gave Tony a look of gentle admonishment. “I told you to tell him,” he said.
“I’m sure he’s looking for you, Stark. But he will never find you in these mountains. No one will.”
He would tell Steve about that night in the Wanderer’s Woods: Thanos, Yinsen, Strange; the long years confined in the castle, having to wear the medallion to prevent his powers from getting out of control, but secretly practising at night; the thrill of lighting candles and starting fires, all the while terrified that someone would find out; about that day in King’ Isle, how he had only managed to change himself into a dragon because of the singular desire to keep Steve safe.
It felt like being swept into the midst of a powerful tornado, as Tony curled into a ball, and sank low into the ground to anchor himself to the marble floor.
“Captain.”
“… not personal.”
The thunder god cleared his throat. “We’ve been searching through the cosmos for stardust and some magic colourful dragonstone things. That’s when we came across a path of death and destruction, which led us all the way here.”
Thanos howled, and his hideous face contorted in great pain. Thanos looked down at his wounded chest that was glowing with burning embers and ash. The titan stumbled backward, clearly in no state to fight them or retrieve the mindstone.
With Bruce’s help, they cultivated new strains, which adapted better to their warm and wet climate. These new plants, that one could now find all over Kingsgarden, had small leaves, and bright pink flowers. And while the berries were just as delicious, there was a marked difference in their taste.
Tony wondered about that. Nat never spoke of her family. Did she have anyone to turn to in her darkest hour?
By the time they landed within the inner walls of Shieldberg, the sun was beginning to set and a cold wind had started to blow. While there was still no sign of the enemy, Tony was certain they were inside the citadel.
Thank you so much for joining me on this journey! This was the hardest thing I've ever tried to write and I'm not kidding when I say it nearly killed me (multiple times). =p I solemnly swear that I will never write another multi-chapter story again.
“I can help you with that.”
Over the cheerful sizzling in the hearth, the merry words and joyful laughter sent chills right to his heart, slowing it down so much that Steve thought it would stop.
Going into battle, this was critical, as they were about to encounter some of the most powerful dragons in the seven realms, all with unique and remarkable abilities, and Tony wanted nothing left to chance.
These invisible labours often went unnoticed, like the concrete that held together his mosaic of stones. Without it, a kingdom of earth’s mightiest heroes would be torn asunder, pulled apart like loose rock.
He ignored the suit Coulson had picked out, opting instead for a T-shirt and dark jeans. He did, however, consider throwing on
“What? No, Clint! Clint!” Nat shouted as they watched the monster’s tail whipping the archer across the deck, after driving an arrow up the serpent’s ass.
Steve hummed thoughtfully. “Big man in a suit of armour. Take that off and what are you?”
A pair of eagles were in the sky, executing the well-choreographed dives of their courting ritual, before they vanished behind the
“I have my duties to see to. I’ll have to see what I can do,” JARVIS told him.
“That works,” they piped in unison, gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes, as they held hands across the table.
It was wonderful and fantastic and Steve had never felt more out of place - an ordinary mortal in the midst of all that magic. It was no wonder Tony never came home. The temple was exactly the sort of place that would hold his attention for hours on end.
“What?” Tony interrupted. “Wait, wait a minute –”
“Hi.”
Tony was up in his seat, leaning forward, in a moment. “You too, huh?”
His mind whispered as his body shuddered with desire.
“It’s magic,” Steve told him quietly, and it was the truth.
“I hope so,” he said, truly feeling better. "Thank you," he added.
Watching the gentle rise and fall of his chest, it was apparent that Tony was no longer in pain. Steve, on the other hand, had forgotten to breathe. His head began to spin as he felt the strength leaving his legs, which forced him to lean on the side of the bed to support some of his weight.
“Excuse me?” Peter shouted back. “You got your horns moments ago!”
This one,” he exploded, with barely any warning, hurling the report in Steve’s direction.
“Foxtrot is down. He’s unresponsive. We need EMTs,” Agent Hill said into her phone when she got there.
"I - uh - I don’t think we’re ready for that,” the captain mumbled, colouring slightly around the ears.
Tyranaksthon (Anthony Stark)
is Captain Maw. And he’s a basilisk!”
Days had passed since Steve overheard Tony’s conversation with his family, but Tony never brought it up and Steve wasn’t going to ask.
Then, the curtains came down.
“No, Steve. I have to tell you everything. I’ll start from the beginning.”
When Tony looked up, he found a tiny wisp of a boy whose cool blue eyes provided the perfect foil to the roaring fire’s red. Clearly a man with a plan, the young man's gaze wandered across the building's facade as a sharp mind mapped out possible routes of entry and escape.
Tony woke up screaming. His arms flailed wildly as he tried to bat away the horrors of the cave. Matted hair clung to his forehead and his clothes were soaked.
“I’ll make you a new one,” Tony promised. “But hopefully, we’ll have no real use for it.”
“We’re not friends. All we ever do is fight.”
Steve smiled mysteriously as he fished for something in his canvas satchel. “Are you hungry?” he asked, and Tony could have sworn he was biting down on his lower lip to suppress some sort of giggle. “I – uh – I made this.”
. I should have told you. I’ve had these powers for years, but never managed to change into a dragon until that day on King’s Isle.”
It wasn’t something Tony had to consider. Between the mages and the warriors on the field, the battle was as good as won. Besides, who would he follow if not Steve?
“Who are you?” Steve probed.
“Do I have to? You’re the CEO, not me.”
“I refuse.”
Thor frowned. “I don’t drink tea,” he said.
“Who is asking you to stop?”
Steve chuckled, moving closer. Tony had missed the sound of his laughter. He wanted to make him laugh again, to always be the reason for his mirth.
Watching Tony smile, the air rushed out of lungs as his heart swelled to twice its size, which in turn caused his chest to puff up with pride. Even though that meddling sorcerer had assembled the sandwich, it was he and he alone who had prepared the ingredients.
He began evaluating the engine, using the diagnostics on his suit to scan through different levels of machinery. He had to get the system back online before he could access the rotors and dislodge the debris.
“Hey,” he said, when he landed, lowering his voice so as not to frighten Steve.
Tony took advantage of Steve's confusion to take the gauntlet out of his hands. “Hired him? Whatever for?”
She smiled, looking pleased at his answer. “Let me know if he isn't and I’ll set him right for you. For now, I'm glad he hasn't made you uncomfortable, at the least.”
, his battles with
The face plates went down and the shooting began. They worked in tandem, targeting the grey comets who dared to approach, burning up anything that got too close, leaving behind their trails of dust.
“My parents died, Steve. And I miss them. So much."
It took a long time, but his wounds had one day healed, leaving physical scars that were easily hidden and a smattering of magic that the dragon had unwittingly transferred to him - powers he retained but couldn’t command. Nothing fantastic - just the ability to light candles, heat things. Unless he learnt the spell, or the magic words, to invoke the transformation, he was stuck in this state – neither dragon nor man.
Tony was in the air, riding the dracanix and beckoning him to get on before the whirlpool could drag him toward the ocean bed. He leapt off the kraken and onto the dragon, just behind Tony, before being taken for a ride around Shieldberg Bay.
Laughter erupted around them and the prince glowered at his knight and squire.
Tony's own parents had been strangers when they married, and love had blossomed over time. He hadn’t expected to be swept off his feet right from the start, but the first time Steve touched his hand felt like magic, and Tony felt like he’d been waiting for him all his life.
"And if I still didn’t want this?"
“I’m on it.”
“Let me see. My, what big hands you have,” Tony commented as he examined Steve’s long fingers.
“I’m on it,” she said.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Tony muttered, trying not to roll his eyes. “Do you even know what’s behind these doors?”
There was a general air of cheerful anticipation and Steve hoped, for the sake of all present, that the antidote would work, that Tony would make a full recovery and come back to them – his loving family and friends.
Back on the quinjet, Tony watched with interest as Steve pulled out a ten-dollar bill and handed it to a smirking Natasha.
“You’ve got to be careful with the weeds,” Jarvis told him. There’s no way to tell at first, with them pretending to be the plants you’ve sown. But time reveals their true nature. Then, you need to quickly nip the imposters in the bud. They spread so quickly, taking the light and all the good stuff with them, so much so that even the strongest and most beautiful of your plants will wither and die.”
“Is this normal?” Steve pressed, turning to Bruce this time.
Nat scoffed. “Protection and love? He killed ten thousand people in one year.”
Tony raised a brow. “I’m just going to the other side,” he explained, with a small smile of amusement, before climbing in beside him.
“Uh – No. No, he isn’t. But - uh - he’ll be living here with us.”
He attacked with cold precision, making multiple attempts to plunge the knife into Steve’s throat. Steve was very skilled (or very lucky). He never got hurt, and even managed to disarm the assassin, forcing him to drop his knife.
happy with the turntable he owned. It wouldn’t spin smoothly, intermittently slowing down and sometimes coming to a complete stop.
“I’m just going to hold you, all right?”
At that, all the air left his lungs, because Maria was right. Tony could die. He was dying right in front of them all, and there was not a thing that anyone could do to stop it from happening.
“Do you want to take a look at the rest of the house?”
“I’m gonna have to take a raincheck on our date,” Tony told him, regretfully.
“I can’t hold them off that long,” Strange cautioned.
The monster slithered after Tony, with his forked tongue darting out and dripping venom onto the ship. It closed on Tony, rearing his head back as if poised to strike, but Steve slammed his shield against the back of the beast’s head, and dragged Tony around the corner.
She dabbed some concealer lightly over his cheekbone, attempting to mask a bruise, by then a faded yellow-brown.
“Ironclaw is a family heirloom. Why would your father gift it to mine?”
By doing both, he hoped that he would one day span the galaxy. It was to be a beautiful journey. And every journey began with one small step, one giant leap. Of faith.
But he was ready to go home.
“All of them?”
, Tony rocketed from his position, blasting Loki backward, before
“Where are the rest?” Nat asked drily, unfazed by the Black order and the massive army behind them.
“I just thought of something,” Peter called out as Tony pulled up beside him. “Do you remember that really old book,
“Yes,” Steve said, as he matched Tony's smile. “It’s a long one, and growing too, because every time I think I have you all figured out, you go right ahead and pull off another surprise.”
The morning sun poured through the drapes into the bedroom and roused Steve from his sleep. He was, however, in no hurry to wake – warm in his own bed, under the thick blanket, enveloped with feelings of peace and joy as the sounds of whispers and soft laughter swirled around the room.
Regardless of what Steve did to make Tony feel welcome, Tony would never consider Valoria his home. He would try, of course, for the alliance, because Tony was selfless like that, but perhaps he would never truly be happy.
Steve didn’t seem to hear the question. “That man on the bridge – I knew him,” he quietly told him instead.
Tony hurried to the door, assessing the four soldiers making their way towards him.
Tony whipped his head around, looking for something, chains or ropes, to restrain Ivan, but was distracted at the sight of Steve scaling a sea stack toward them. He looked tiny on the large face of the rock, and vulnerable.
All he made out was that he and Tony had been there the day of the dragon’s prophesied birth and that the dragon was some sort of shifter, which, according to Bruce, was pretty common these days. The revelation sparked off more questions of his own. “Was it hard? Changing for the first time? How did you even know what to do?”
Shovelling spoonful after spoonful into his mouth, compliments were heaped on Tony's culinary skills. And he revelled in the happy alpha scent that was filling the room. He did a good thing. Alpha was happy. And it was making him happy too.
Adding to this epiphany was the truth about Tony’s medallion. Neither a token of love nor the source of Tony’s powers, it was merely a contraption to suppress Tony’s powers, for him to hide amongst his peers, without fear of retribution, and that had even extended to Steve.
“That’s up to you," he said.
Dr. Banner was in the house.
Tony wanted to comply with the words. He was a good husband. He really was. But his terrified legs developed a mind of their own, and were rooted to the spot. Tony tensed as he heard Steve moving closer. “Hey. Look at me.”
“My turn,” he declared, as he unleashed his flamethrowers on the
“There’s been a correlation between the recent explosions and the wave of people signing up for testing,” Hill explained when she noticed his confusion. “We think - the Mandarin campaign is a coverup for the incidental explosions of
Sitting on one of the steps, Wanda shared her findings. “Lo eza gnoleje hen doron, issa syrje ruarza, kostilus leda se gaomagon hen magi.  Issi olvie kostoba spiel - cast ondoso ia kraj soceri.”
Tony’s sides were covered in eight vertical lines – four long gashes on each side, with blood still pooling from them. Sharp talons had pierced arteries and punctured deep tissue, driving a lethal dose of poison into Tony’s body.
"What?! No! We just... it was safer ta..." Steve floundered, his eyes fixed on STAR, and then he sighed. "Look, you're always talkin' about how they have souls. Thanos wants ta off half the universe with the Infinity Stones. If he got his hands on all of 'em..."
I have to use this very small platform I have to urge my fellow white Americans to use this as a time to really reflect, to understand and check your privilege. Please listen to and amplify black voices in this time of crisis, and educate yourselves on how you can help change and better the systems that have failed black communities over and over again.
Hoping to prevent Winter from answering that with all the sass and swagger he'd been embracing lately, he ducked in the door just before it closed with a quiet 'snick'. The second Rogers saw him, his expression darkened further and his hands clenched into fists. Maybe being the one to accompany Winter had been a mistake. He probably should have sent someone else in his place. Why had he insisted on coming along, knowing how much Rogers hated him?
Ms. Marvel
be my kid. Our kid. Me and Steve won't leave you behind, and we'll visit and have you visit all the time--"
Really? FRIDAY, please bring up the live transcript, if you will. [pause] If you read this back I think you'll understand why I don't believe you. I think you're here to try and dig up dirt on Mr. Stark. However, as you are an official liaison from the Committee, I suppose I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. What questions do you have?
But now is all good, and here is the story! :D Yay!
"But if you don't stop enabling me I will be forced to make you sit in the corner with the dunce cap on."
"I've been worried about you every day, my mom's been trying to get through to Pepper for weeks and Laney's back to crying at the drop of a hat again and you've been busy... what? Breaking in a new boy toy?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Anyway, his
Comments are much appreciated and loved. <3
But then, miracle of miracles, he found out that Tony didn't hate him. He was even interested in being friends which was just... just great news. Mostly. Well, it gave Steve a way to test the waters at least. Being Tony's friend would be enough, would
"Wait. This is... huh. I thought he'd be smaller." So much for control, because that had him howling again. Nobody had ever in his life said he was bigger than they'd expected, but now here was Harley, Tony's maybe-son saying just that and it was... it was something else.
"Hey bud," he murmured, other hand still dancing over the paper as ideas flowed. "Do me a favor? Lemme know if your da heads this way, will ya?" Clearly understanding that this was a secret request, the 'bot's answer was a very muted whistle. With him on guard, Steve relaxed his own and let himself fall into the very important list he was making.
So he guessed Harley was right. There was something important he needed to start work on. Thanks to Rogers and his bestest friend, a slew of vulnerabilities had been brought to his attention that he needed to start fixing. Then there were the Accords to remake and new Avengers to recruit, because their little playground brawl had in no way stopped or slowed down the threat that was descending on them from space. And as much getting back in the game terrified him, he knew he was going to do it anyway.
, he always--" Tony bit whatever else had been about to explode out, closing his eyes in a poor display of patience. "Maybe you weren't ‘Bucky and Steve’ the way Rogers and his version were, but I know you still... you're practically brothers from what you've told me. I would be an asshole if I asked you not to go see him."
"That witch up there too? Ya know, the one that controlled
There was a little bouquet of flowers laying on one of the workbenches. Only a couple months ago he would have assumed they were for Pepper, or maybe for Nat as a 'thanks' for working with him on his hand to hand. But once he and Tony had settled on a name Steve had spent days looking at those specific flowers, spent hours drawing and shading different bunches of the things so he could make the perfect design for Tony to have etched on Primrose's leather collar.
He was pulled out of that morbid thought by the press of Steve's lips against his own. Long, elegant fingers gently famed his face as his
. Why the fuck he'd given that all up and come back Tony didn't know, and he was just lucky it hadn't all ended sooner.
that even seeing it has you on the edge of a panic attack, because I've only ever seen it used to protect our team and the civilians caught in the crossfire. Pisses me off that you had to see it used against you instead. So we're gonna get rid of this fucking paint job, and we're gonna repaint it with something a lot more
"STAR will be on my side."
"Ya try'n get one step closer and I'll kick your ass ten ways ta Sunday."
"I think it'd work well for me," he said while shifting his weight from foot to foot. "I limited the destructive capabilities and added some of the features from Rescue that Fri would share with me." It was... it was the Iron Man suit, only shrunk down and re-imagined a little. "It sounds kind of lame but so are you, so I was thinking... I was thinking I could go by Iron Kid?"
, look at you being all blushy like we've never had kinky sex before. Babe. Babe. Communication and consent is key. And anyway, after all we've done, you--"
Thankfully Tony showed up on the fourth day, looking both guilty and cautiously hopeful.
He also signaled FRIDAY to make sure she was recording the mock battle. Both Tonys would love to watch it later with popcorn.
Hope you are all safe and doing well, and thank you again for all the support. <3
"Too much? I can change the colors. Ignore the colors because I can totally do a do-over. Focus on the design, okay? I've seen the way you fling your shield around now, so I made the left glove a lot thinner and more pliable than the right. That one's actually got some plating so that if the shield is off zoom-zooming, you can bring that up to protect your face and neck."
Sam still had hero worship in his expression, but it was waning. Tony wondered if being on the run the way they were was dimming some of that golden boy shine that hung around Rogers. He wondered if the man knew he was no longer a Reservist; Sam Wilson had been given the Other Than Honorable Conditions discharge around the same time as Tony had finally been given the go-ahead to fly back to the states. Natasha was more put together than either man, of course, but he could still see signs of wear. Most notable was the hint of expression he could see in her eyes, in the nearly non-existent lines around her mouth. He couldn't quite figure out what that elusive, barely there emotion might be... but part of him hoped it was shame.
about touching. And maybe he'd carried it into the future with him along with the depression and what one of the SHIELD shrinks had called 'passive suicidal ideation'. Steve had only seen her three times - he'd liked her, but Fury had moved him to someone else's care pretty quick. Steve guessed that maybe nobody wanted to admit that he wasn't all that invested in coming 'home' from whatever his next mission was. They found him a shrink who was mostly quiet, and now he and Steve spent one hour a week staring at each other.
. I am Winter, because that is who
He lost Tony more than he lost anyone, and it hurt like hell every time. The man was in high demand though, and he had a company to run so he couldn't say anything. Steve kept every plea to stay locked behind his teeth and he sent Tony off to other countries with a smile. He pretended it didn't kill something in him to watch the genius climb into an airplane with a jaunty wave. He never gave in to the insane, insulting way he wanted to forbid Tony from flying off into battle where Steve couldn't fully have his back. And he watched without complaint whenever Tony vanished into the crowd at parties with some pretty young thing on his arm - they were only ever going to dance or talk shop but it still…
And you both have to choose it. There has to be two of you - it's why I touched you both.
Lokes was a bastard who wouldn't let anyone talk about what the hell was going on until the dishes were done. Then the little drama queen had made them all coffee before ushering them into the living room to sit. Shellhead commandeered a loveseat for the two of them, Winter made himself at home on one of the overstuffed armchairs, and he and Steve snuggled up under a blanket on the couch. It would have been downright domestic if he weren't ready to fucking
“You’re here.”
"You figured you'd tiptoe around me until I finally got wise."
"Now we do."
"Your boy toy has lost his mind."
"To be fair they aren't the
"It's the Infinity Stones. Gems. Whatever the fuck. They don't follow the rules of science or magic, so at least everyone on the GPS team is equally annoyed. The 'why' is because the Stones like my Tiny Adorable Steve, so they do what they do and make sure the timeline he lives in here is, as my little physicist states, 'synced up' with the timeline there. It will break your brain if you try to think about it, my bio-blossom. If you still want to help us puzzle it out you're more than welcome to come to the meetings. They involve lots of tears and screaming into the void."
"Tony," his science bro was trying not to laugh - another victory. "For the last time--"
"It's long-term. I don't need to make him my fella tomorrow, Rhodes. I can wait for him to be ready."
"... mission accepted."
His mind was more than made up by the time Peter came back with a huge smile and more yogurt than was probably good for a person. The kid still looked ridiculous in his too-fancy, trying too hard outfit, but it was endearing rather than laughable now. It was a good thing he'd managed to keep from laughing, because he had a feeling the kid got laughed at enough. Probably would have ruined any chance they had at bonding if he'd reacted that same way.
~.~.~
"Except STAR--"
. There in the bed, in the tower. In his life. If they guy went off to take revenge on his behalf it would be sort of sweet but it would also mean he was gone. Again.
Again - Ultron occurred because of the unforeseen influence the Mind Stone had upon the process. I can have Thor meet with you to explain it in depth, if you would like--
"We won't make ya go back, but we can't let ya stay in the park either. But listen ta this - me and Tony live in a house surrounded by trees. Dunno what kind-a tree Tappy likes best, but I'm sure we've got 'em. Our house is pretty big too. Plenty big enough ta have another visitor for a while." Maybe forever, depending on how it all shook out. There'd be paperwork and questions, and he'd have to make sure to keep Tony, Lokes and Shellhead from destroying whatever woman had upset Doreen enough to be called a mean old witch. He was pretty sure they could make it work despite that.
“Hey there beautiful.” He scoffed at the endearment even if the naked affection in Steve’s voice lifted his entire spirit. There were all kinds of wires hooked up to him, he hadn’t had his new version of a ‘bath’ in almost two days and he knew there were still some cuts and bruises littering his face. He was just about the farthest from ‘beautiful’ he could get.
Soon they were both laughing, leaning against each other hard to keep themselves upright. It was, if someone was feeling poetic, a really nice metaphor for what he hoped their relationship would be like.
"Pops?"
He loved that Carol just
"I think yes." Before the man could protest again, he dive-bombed the couch. Loki didn't get out of the way quite in time, so Steve could wrap his arms around the mage's middle and squeeze. After a brief, playful scuffle, they ended up sitting side by side, one of Loki's arms thrown over his shoulders. "Admit it - ya like me."
"First of all, the look on my face is not 'gross', it's the one you get when you love someone very much and you should only hope to be so lucky when you finally grow up. Also? You absolutely don't need help with that design, my budding little engineering genius. How do I know this, you ask?"
The new team at least, which would be headquartered in the completely remodeled compound upstate. He'd spent a lot of nights with Tony and Ben bent over blueprints, trying to get the design right. Rhodey and Viz were key parts of the conversations as well, adding insight and making sure Ben knew what they were going to need to actually let the team train properly and make their living quarters suitable.
"How dare? I like that one. I'm taking it home with me."
"Wanda's only a kid, and she's learning--"
Maybe he should have had the teen grab actual food... but it was too late to change things now. Besides, he'd feed her the good stuff after he got her home and had a vet take a look at her. Once he'd read up on what was best for her to eat and all that too. He wanted to make sure he got the best stuff to feed his new girl, after all.
So this is gonna get a little political, so if that sort of stuff annoys you maybe skip this note.
They had eternity in their grasp, after all.
"This is... Tony. She's beautiful."
"Even you have to eat more than that, Tony."
There was a long moment of silence while they sized each other up
"I would fight you on your timeline if I didn't hurt so fucking much whenever I even roll over."
It was new, being important enough to someone that they would defend him like that, at least against something like this. Rhodey would - and had at parties when they were both younger - but he wasn’t at the fancy shindigs. Pepper was more likely to roll her eyes in exasperation at his antics, because despite how amazing she otherwise was she hadn’t quite clued in to how uncomfortable it made him. It was probably the only way she had bought into all the hype about him.
"Yeah. Back when... well. Back before Erskine and the serum I was just skinny little Stevie Rogers. Mebbe my ma and Buck never minded huggin'n stuff, but nobody else ever wanted to, you know? Everyone knew I was sickly'n mebbe no one wanted to get attached. Then the whole world was at war,
It hurt too much, and Peter was pretty understanding of that. He brought the grandkids to visit them instead, along with his pretty wife who was just a little bit crazy in the best way. Harley never settled down the same way, not until Captain Katie Danvers blew onto the scene. Fresh from an encounter with Mar-Vell, she had more than enough sass and fire to capture Iron Maverick's heart; Steve maintained it was the fact that she could absolutely kick Harley's ass that had done his kid in. The pair were too busy serving justice in space to have kids, but they were both great at the roles of Fun Aunt and Cool Uncle whenever they were on Earth.
to just melt into it and beg Tony to never let go. Even if he'd spent all day working, he still smelled so good - like money, Buck would say with a grin - and Steve was finally,
"Are you two done being gross? Because I for one would like to shoot someone until they dissolve into bloody chunks."
"No. Laney and my mom won't either. I told 'em they couldn't see you 'til later, so they're settling in--"
"All that aside... is my compromise acceptable? Or do we need to duke it out Ms. Potts?"
"Yeah, sure. Whatever. I wasn't trying to... shit. Look." Harley reached into his bag and pulled out a bunch of... brochures? Not just brochures, but ones for
(See the end of the chapter for
So he'd taken away the oh-so patriotic color palette and allowed himself the guilty pleasure of choosing hot rod red and gold. Because Steve wasn't quite as... flashy as he was, he had tried to tone it down a little. Most of Steve's suit was actually black, but Iron Man's colors did stand out in bold relief against that. Just in case anyone missed that connection, he'd stamped the image of an arc reactor over the heart. Because he was not only a sap but a predictable one, he'd also made sure it was outlined in that same bright blue.
All he ever saw when he looked at Harley was that kid who had busted into Tony's room, terrified and furious.
Then I refuse to further discuss Ultron with you. If you have genuine questions about SI's work to protect our planet--
Okay, sure, maybe he was a little jealous, but he wasn't going to punish Captain America by sticking him on a floor all by himself. It wasn't his fault Tony was the way he was. Howard had always told him it would be like this, that Captain America would take one look at him and know that he was too sensitive, not manly enough to be worth his time. He had been expecting it since he was a kid, and he could deal.
"So." They stared at each other, and he felt that strange tension between them mount again. He hated it, didn't know how to diffuse it, and so he just kept on staring.
“Thanks.”
In the ensuing skirmish where Loki called up a magical version of the sticky substance that was arc reactor blue, Steve vowed that he would never lose touch with his crazy, amazing friends ever again.
“Thank God for that,” he said, accepting a cup. “Where’s Cook?”
“You’ll lose,” Tony lied, and kept his eyes fixed firmly ahead, where daylight streaked into the tunnel. If he managed to make it out to the landing pad, he could try calling out to the Asgardians or one of the twins.
“Oh,” Tony said, as his mind reviewed his long list of courting propositions. “To what exactly, may I ask?”
“Sometimes?” Sam cut in, as he appeared from behind.
They were speaking draconic, which Tony understood well enough, having assimilated Thanos’ proficiency in the language.
They listened carefully as the footsteps got closer. Then, Rhodey knocked one of them out with a well-positioned blow to the head. Tony pointed his firearm at the other one, experimenting with different angles to maximise the intimidating effect he was failing to create.
“Same way I knew you were going to make it, despite what they said. It’s how I knew that you would one day grow to be tall and strong, just like your father, and burn brightly above as you leave your mark.”
“No,” Tony said, keeping his voice level. “We - will be living in Iron Man’s attic. Also I might have hired him.”
“Tony,” Steve said, beginning to look extremely uncomfortable, like he was waging an internal war inside himself. “I’m sorry, but I’m going to need the suit.”
“But, you haven’t said or done anything. I thought you-” he faltered, lost for the right words.
The penthouse wasn’t a complete disaster, objectively speaking, but it had been evacuated in a hurry. Half-fried bacon lay sizzling in a warm pan and bowls of beaten eggs were chucked messily on the kitchen counter.
The guests were wild with excitement, and Tony had to raise his voice above the din. “And now, we feast!”
Captivated by the magical phenomenon, he hadn’t noticed the kraken’s head disappearing under the water’s surface and a maelstrom forming in her wake.
And, they had fallen on bad times indeed.
“Father,” she breathed, as she arrived.
Abruptly, Tony turned away, afraid that Steve would look into his eyes and see that he was no longer the same person he once cared about.
Tony stayed under the howling dragon, and took care to avoid his unpredictable sprays of acid. “Steve! Now!” he shouted, when he got to a good position –
“No!” Tony yelled back, as he picked himself up. “I’m hungry! I need a sandwich!”
“Yeah, sure. Uh-oh," he added as he looked out of the window for the first time since parking the car to observe the rush hour crowd descending upon the market. "It looks like we'll be stuck here for a while. Do you have someplace you need to be or – uh – some – someone you need to get home to?”
But the arrival of the enemy, clamouring loudly from across the river, had turned the meadow into a battlefield, where lambs rose into lions, ready to defend their territory to the bitter end, their sacrifices a worthy exchange for the freedom of their loved ones back home.
They were going home.
“Gotta go to a meeting. I want you to stay in our room. You hear me?”
In other news, after a whole lot of agonising, I finally figured out how this is going to end. We're in the endgame now (three more chapters to go). And I don't know if I should smile or cry.
The very first time Tony found the bottle of pink pills on his dressing table, he’d been overjoyed and relieved. Steve was giving him options. So he didn’t have to bond with a complete stranger. But the innocuous-looking pink pills were now becoming a cruel reminder that Steve had no interest in bonding with him. And he was rejecting him, month after month, in the kindest way he knew.
Sarah had never been a particularly religious woman, but Steve had heard her in those bleak moments with him at death’s door, pleading with the gods as she offered her life in exchange for his.
Steve melted into the embrace and presented no resistance to Tony pulling him close. Finally, with Steve in his arms, safe and sound, he could watch the rest of the battle with immense relief as their team triumphed over the rest of Thanos’ guards.
Alphas had needs. Tony knew that. That’s why they needed mates. To make them happy. Tony was lucky Steve hadn’t put his needs above Tony’s and forced himself on him before he was ready.
Tony opened the door, hiding behind it as much as possible. He didn’t really have a choice. Steve could and would break the door down if he wanted to. He peered at Steve through his wet eyelashes. And his husband's eyes softened at the sight of his tear-stained face.
Tony looked incredulously at him. Aunt Peggy had been full of praise for the captain's situational awareness. Did he really need him to spell it out? “It doesn't matter, at least not anymore. It’s done,” he mumbled.
How was he needed? Even now, he was getting in the way of the sorcerers, arguing with them as they tried to come up with an alternative solution. If anyone was standing in the way of Tony’s recovery, it was him.
Reluctantly, Tony pulled away. “If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops,” he said, surprised he could still do the math with Steve's tongue in his mouth.
“Tyrant’s Cave on King’s Isle,” Tony said. “It's an unconventional choice for a honeymoon,” Tony said.
“I’ll get him,” the dragon said cheerfully as he turned to go. “If you can just pass me the medallion, that would be swell. Tony might need that. I mean he could probably do without, but it might take a while,” he blabbered on incomprehensibly as he held his claw out.
Instinctively, Tony drew his wings to cover his face and braced himself for the strike - which never came. For Steve had landed in front of him, just in time, to block the twin lightning bolts with his shield. The king's feet were firmly planted to the roof of the stack, but his arms were straining with effort to hold the shield, which was glowing even brighter with sparks flying mysteriously around it until the lightning it had absorbed reversed toward its source - Ivan’s head.
There was no doubt about it now.
He righted himself and landed on one knee, right before they were about to slaughter a man in front of his sobbing family.
“Don’t gloat. We have incoming. Save my spot. Ready?” Tony said, looking over the waste disposal bins they were hiding behind.
“Stop speaking in riddles!” Obie roared.
“Thanks,” Tony shouted, already diving. Peter could fly faster than any dragon he'd ever met, but if he didn't free Steve from the ropes, and soon, he would be in trouble.
“Steve…” Tony began, his chest now bursting with the words he wanted to say.
Tony racked his brains as his eyes desperately swept over the beach. “I don’t know,” he said. “But…” he trailed off, at the sight of the cave.
“Steve,” he whispered, as his heart raced to keep up with Steve's words. He put his arm on Steve’s shoulder to cut him off. “I think there’s been a mistake.”
He slipped his hand in his pocket to check that Fury’s flash drive was still there. The director had spent his last few minutes of his life racing back to the tower just to hand it to him. Tony could only hope it contained the answers to the millions of questions racing through his mind.
“Is this little display meant to insinuate you’re going to throw me off, Sir Barnes? ‘Cause it’s really not your style,” the messenger said.
“Oh, beautiful. You want me. I can smell it on you,” Killian whispered into his ear as the omega felt himself getting wet with increasing horror.
A blast of
“Rhodey!” Tony called, spying the knight nearby. “The king wants to know if I’m a good rider.”
Steve stayed close as Bruce continued to administer the antidote. He held on to Tony’s hand, even as the prince remained in a state of restless sleep. Distressed by the soft cries of pain escaping Tony’s mouth, Steve lost count of the number of times Bruce pressed the quill into Tony’s arm until it finally came to a stop.
Tony considered the truth of that statement.
“Banner, now might be a really good time to - ”
Like the caterpillar, ignorant of how it's devoured its last leaf, he was carried, unconscious, into the cave, shrouded in secrecy and hidden amidst the mountains.
jump on to another dragon mid-flight. You just don’t. It’s not part of the plan. It never was.”
There was plenty of time, so Tony strolled past the designated coffeehouse and browsed the menus of some of the more interesting restaurants in the area, trying not to feel too envious as he gazed through the glass windows at loving couples enjoying a mid-afternoon treat.
“Any success?” he asked, genuinely curious now.
They were on the young side, perhaps in their late teens, but it was hard to tell with the way dragons aged.
Did he really think Tony was going to stay forever? Living in their little stone cottage and baking bread, with the occasional trip to some offshore island? It was an alliance they had between them, and that’s all it would ever be.
It wasn’t a replacement, because the original was well and truly gone, buried in the sands of Gulmira, like the person he’d once been. This was a new ring for the person he was now.
made me anything like this,” Steve lamented. “It’s so beautiful," he continued, running his fingers over the weapon lovingly.  “And is Iron Man an Avenger now? Because funny, Fury forgot to mention. Again.”
Tony leaned over and turned it off.
“What reading?” Sam asked, his brows furrowed.
“You doing anything fun this Saturday night?” Tony asked. If they were going to stay married, they might as well do it right. Didn't matter if it was backwards.
Steve ignored the comment. “Don’t wait too long,” was all he said while patting Bucky's back.
It barely made a dint to their ranks, Tony realised, as new drones flew in to take the place of the ones they’d decimated. They were closing in, forcing them towards the barycentre.
“When did you become an expert in sea monsters?” Nat asked from behind her shield.
“I learnt from the best,” Steve said and took her hand in his as they shared a moment remembering his late father.
Tony giggled. “See you at tea, your majesty.”
“Funny things are,” Clint explained. “Sorry, it’s just that…”
“I don’t understand,” Steve said, as he looked around the room and noticed the defeat in everyone’s eyes. “The antidote works. It’s just that we don’t have enough. Why aren’t we making more?”
Well-satisfied, their guests headed back into the sunshine to say their farewells. Thor and Loki were off to Attilan, to assist Black Bolt in driving out the invaders, hoping to miraculously recover the iristone that had been stolen. Their departure left behind a circle of burnt grass, right where they’d been standing.
Tony took the gem from him, and studied it curiously for a short moment, before slipping it into his pocket. “This is all our fault,” Tony sighed, and buried his face in his hands as he sank down into the sand.
Straining his eyes in the darkness, Steve could see the illustrations of lustrous gems painted in the colours of the rainbow, but the words were small and foreign to his eyes. With a wave of his hand, Lord Strange turned what looked like ancient symbols into High Valorian, which Steve was somewhat familiar with, before placing it into his trembling palms.
Steve grinned. “You really think that a legendary dragon, the so-called king of flying beasts, is going to mind a couple of guys kissing in his cave?”
“Bring me HYDRA!”  he boomed as he entered the room, so Tony thrust a large mug of coffee into his hands to
“Thank you for your co-operation,” Rhodey said, politely, and knocked him out with the butt of his pistol. “We need to split up,” he said, looking troubled at the thought of leaving Tony to his own devices.
“But – he – he’s still – ”
Tony bit into the sandwich, and a look of delight spread across his face. “Best thing I’ve had my whole life.”
A pale-looking Steve seemed to guess at his plan. He shook his head and mouthed the word
“Why would any of you think I’d hurt Tony?” Steve asked, exasperated and hurt. “You’re my friends too!’
“Schellehead!” Steve shouted from below him, drawing Tony’s attention to two dragons with unfamiliar silhouettes, one red, the other silvery blue, slinking away in the direction of Shieldberg.
The tears weren’t for himself. They were the tears of betrayal, like those of a person about to take the life of a loved one. The titan’s pupils glowed bright blue. With a burst of energy, he threw Pietro off his back and raised his talons.
needs no cure.
“Magic!”
Glancing down at the beach, where Nat and the other petrified warriors were, Steve’s heart raced and beat painfully against his chest. With a deep breath and a heavy sigh, they began their descent.
The kraken howled and her body twisted in agony, as her tentacles uncurled and released her victims into the sea to tread water until Redwing or the mysterious dracanix picked them up.
When he had returned to the centre of his troops, Star came to a stop. Looking at the troops assembled before him, Steve raised his voice. “Arise, my brothers! Arise, my sisters! For years, we and our allies have been living in the shadow of this growing beast. The time has come for us to rise against the monster and force it back from whence it came.”
She was about say something else, but changed her mind. Then, she made a sharp turn, changing her course, at the sight of someone at the door.
Rhodey gave him a curt nod. “Well, you look like crap. Must’ve been a rough couple of months,” he said, looking critically at Tony’s dull scales and shrunken body.
“Sorry. Sorry,” the alpha cried, appalled. “Tony, what’s happening?”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Steve said. “I’ve been told I’m headstrong, overbearing and sometimes, a bit dumb.”
If you liked the story, please consider leaving a comment to let me know what you think! I’m trying to grow as a writer so your feedback is really helpful!
It was connected to an arc reactor!
“How ironic! Coward Howard thought I was too dangerous to keep around his weapons. Yet, in banishing me from the kingdom, I've been given the greatest weapons of all.”
“What for? Not wanting a dragon for a spouse? I mean, to be fair, it’s not for everyone.”
“This is what I want,” he answered. “I shouldn’t be alive. Unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Steve. I know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.”
“And the fate of the world hangs on to your word, your majesty,” the messenger said, stressing the words, as if to remind Steve of this heavy responsibility.
Steve turned behind once more to look at the pilot of the chopper before facing Tony again, “You know what? Never mind,” he shouted back.
As they gained altitude, Tony released a fireball, which only collided with a ball of poisonous gas that exploded and sent Steve and him reeling while the female dragon twisted out of the way.
“Wow,” Tony murmured, as his eyes went wide with awe. “Dad and Mom wanted me to meet you?”
“You both should take a look.”
Hi! Here is the second installment of the story. I’ve added more details about Tony’s backstory. Thank you to Serinah for all her amazing suggestions! :D
“Tony. Come here,” he murmured as he pulled the tearful omega from behind the door and into his arms.
“It’s ridiculous,” Tony cried in disbelief, throwing his hands up. “Fury’s secrets have secrets.”
“Don’t be jealous. I’ve got all this shimmer.”
Taking advantage of the moment, Steve threw his weight behind his sword, and drove it into the serpent’s middle. Nothing happened. The serpent’s hide looked completely intact. He tried again, and again, putting his full weight behind the swing, which only succeeded in breaking its tip.
Tony buried himself under the soft sheets, wrapped up in thoughts of his new husband and his gold hair and sapphire eyes. He ran a finger over his bottom lip, which burned from the press of ruby lips. They tasted of promise, that Steve would one day be his, and when that day came, he would hold on tight to his
“Oh,” Steve said, and felt all the air leaving his body as he watched Tony’s face closely for signs of movement, desperate to see how the fight progressed.
“How are you finding it here?” Steve asked, making conversation to distract the dragon from Tony’s food.
“And now they’re yours too,” he told him, softly.
punching down in his signature fist-and-knee-but-not-kneeling badass stance that he’d rehearsed a hundred times. Standing, he made sure he showed off the machinery on the Mark VI, going for
“Technically, it’s Science. We gave him
“What do you want to do with this?” Steve finally asked, holding out his old arc reactor, which had been beside him on the bed.
Finally, the killer walked towards the surveillance camera and took aim, giving Tony an unobstructed, close-up view of his visage.
He almost said, thankful to be alive. But it didn't feel right, not with him in the suit.
Bucky opened his eyes and gave him a dazed smile. “Excelsior!” he cried as he raised an imaginary glass, before descending into a fit of giggles.
Tony planted a kiss on his cheek and got to his feet, as he mumbled something about a garden. He babbled on about seeds and cuttings before he hurried off in the direction of Bruce’s cottage.
“Does that usually work for you?” Tony asked, giving the other man an amused smile as he handed over one of the chocolate milkshakes.
Hands trembling with emotion, he picked up the folder nested in the box. Thumbing through the clear pockets, he found pictures of himself growing up. His father teaching him to use tools. Certificates from various institutions of learning. Newspaper clippings of his prodigious achievements. Notes he had written. Birthday cards he had made. And the words of a poem,
“No, you’re not,” Steve interrupted his ramble, smiling affectionately at him. “I love you like this. I don’t want you to change.”
Except he hadn't died. He was very much alive and about to marry him.
Thor nodded. “Verily, you are not,” he said, as he placed an arm around Steve’s shoulder. “Steven, my friend, you are brave and strong, loyal and true. I’d travel the world to bring it to you. Allow me to undertake this quest for the elusive stone on your behalf. My only fear is we are running out of time.  If only we knew where it was,” the Thunder God mused.
Over rich food and strong drink, mingling guests in high spirits shared their personal tales, so as to weave together a tapestry of stories and legends, which would inspire and delight the youth for generations to come.
The after-party was in three hours, at their brand-new compound in upstate New York, somewhere along the Hudson River.
It was working.
“So - are you and Dad enjoying the peace and quiet now that I’m gone?” Tony asked, stirring the twelve marshmallows swimming in his beverage.
“Fon-due?” Steve sputtered, before he quickly composed his flustered features into a look of nonchalance. “Well, I like you, Mr. Stark. But that’s moving a little too fast, don’t you think?”
The emissary, a man named Ronan, bowed. “Hear me and rejoice. Soon, you will have the privilege of becoming a child of the Emperor Thanos. He offers you his protection and love.”
Then, he realised he couldn’t hear his thoughts above the constant ringing in his ears, a consequence of being smacked around, all day, every day. And he was far more interested in finding out which combination of sweat and tears and blood was streaming down his face in rivulets. Still, he kept his chin up and his head held high (or as high as he could while bound in excruciating positions).
He took the hand Steve offered and they made their way down the stairs. Tony’s mind whirled with the possibilities. He figured it was a home office for Steve to do his super-secret administrative work as that’s where he seemed to receive his visitors. Or maybe an art studio for him to work on his paintings.
And the heartstone was no different.
“I’ve got her.”
“And you, sir, would you like a drink?” Steve asked, addressing Loki, who shook his head.
The emperor cleared his throat. “Pietro, Wanda,” he called, reminding the pair that they were in the company of others.
It was a miracle they made it out of the labyrinth without passing out, stolen kisses and tight embraces in no way helping with the thin air. Finally, they fell onto the pile of blankets in a tangle of arms and legs, beside the remains of grilled fish and empty coconut husks.
Through the smoke and chaos emerged the hysterical cries of a young mother, whose concerned neighbours were preventing her from entering the building. “My baby, where is my Jenny?” she screamed, and Tony learnt of how she’d left her sleeping infant at home while shopping at the neighbourhood grocery store.
Just thought this would be a good place to mention that this story has a 100% happy ending. It will just take our boys a little while to get there. Thank you so much for reading! Please let me know if you have any questions, especially about the universe. There is a high chance I've thought about it, but just didn't manage to include it. =D
Thank you so much to the amazing WritingSesh / Serinah for beta-reading this chapter!!!
“It – It’s just Tony. I got to know about it through him.”
“Aldrich Killian," the mystery man supplied. "I just want to say I’m so sorry about your parents. I’ve worked with your father and I’m full of respect for his work.”
“More like space junk, my friends.”
“Ah. You’ve found the companion. There is a third one too, you know? But it’s very hard to find."
When Tony opened his eyes again, the sun had just about reached its highest point and its bright rays filtered through the leaves to warm his resting body. Getting to his feet, Tony shook the freshly-fallen leaves off his body. Rejuvenated now by his time in the forest, he prepared to depart.
“Call it, Cap,” Clint urged, urgently.
“Targets locked on hostiles, sir.”
And he was off. Tony knew he could fly. The question was how high. “What’s the record for SR-71?”
“She said yes!” Bucky shouted as another troll knocked him off his horse.
neutralised his attack, and allowed the scarlet dragon to escape. Then, the silver dragon soared over Tony and Steve, and rained frost on them from above.
Thank you to
to rescue the princess?” Tony asked, looking down at the unconscious techs in front of them.
The arc reactor, and its blue-white glow, reminiscent of soft blue eyes, became a source of comfort as he powered on through the nights.
Tony sighed. “Love it when you get all commanding. Love you.”
“We’re glad you’re okay,” Nat said gently. Her eyes were sombre. “Relatively speaking.”
She blew out an exasperated chuckle. “You’re both as stubborn as each other sometimes. Okay listen, he kept insisting it wasn’t a big deal, but you know Tony…”
Before someone could argue, there was a bought of turbulence that sent Tony’s heart rate rocketing and his hand shot out to grab the arm-rest. Only, as Steve’s hand was currently on said arm-rest, he managed to grab a handful of that as well.
Clint was going to bust a gut over this.
So, he rubbed Tony down. He rubbed him down good, making sure not to miss any spots along his back or his neck, or the backs and sides of his arms. When his hands started working down towards his lower back and his hips though, he couldn’t help but think about Tony’s bubble butt. There really was no other word for it. It was the sexiest ass Steve had ever seen and he wanted to bite it. His fingers started slipping further and further down, eliciting groans of a slightly more friendly nature. His hands had just gotten down to the curve of his ass, flirting under the seam of his shorts, when Tony cleared his throat.
“That’s fine, I’ll ref for the first round,” Bruce said eagerly.
Little by little, Tony felt himself relax. Even if the plane did crash and they went down in a fiery inferno, a little thing like that wouldn’t keep the stubborn Captain from protecting him. Steve was warm and strong and familiar.
Tony shrugged a shoulder elegantly. “We can totally have sex in the medical wing. No one would know.”
And Steve had to act fast while he could still fix it.
Sure, the issues at
“Rhodey?” Nat asked. She grabbed the antiseptic wipes from her bag and tossed them to Steve.
Steve stormed through the base like a freight train, knocking out bad guys left, right, and centre. For a group that had supposedly managed to capture Tony, they didn’t appear very challenging. It sent a trickle of unease through him. His mind flicked back unwittingly to how Tony had passed out early the other night, to every comment he’d made about being tired, to Pepper’s hesitation over the phone. Suddenly his foe’s incompetence didn’t seem like a good thing; he was even more worried about getting his friend back.
“Of what nature is this ‘shady stuff’?” Thor asked.
“Would it make you feel any better?”
“I’m afraid I haven’t heard of it,” Steve said politely, trying to reclaim Tony’s attention.
That was probably true. Because anything would look better than the crumbling two-storey monstrosity of bad seventies architecture that declared itself the ‘Happy Day Inn’. The paint looked like it had originally been white but given up somewhere in the eighties in favour of a cracking beige colour, and the iron staircase and railing along the second floor was barely clinging to the side of the building. A sad, dying hydrangea bush out front appeared the only attempt at actual colour on the place, and even that was a stretch.
Steve tried to pretend he wasn’t jealous. That he didn’t feel a little flutter of envy as green as the hulk every time Clint displayed an easy comradery with Tony just by understanding the twenty-first century and all the things that Steve should already know.
The gravity of the situation had settled over them like a cloak and Steve was about to vibrate out of his skin with tension.
Tony wanted to set his eyeballs on fire just looking at the thing.
Tony couldn’t pin down the expression on Steve’s face, but he felt his own cheeks flush in embarrassment and annoyance. “Of course I meant it,” he said through gritted teeth. “You’re smart and generous and one of the most devious little shits out there. You’re literally the most lovable person on the planet, and Steve-”
“What was that?” he asked.
and scratching his beer gut than anything resembling prompt service. Even Steve’s polite smile was wavering by the time they got their keys. They filed out of the tiny reception office and Steve handed out their keys.
Pepper agreed and signed off. Steve focused on cleaning out his knuckles meticulously. He didn’t even flinch. Then again, he was used to it by now. It didn’t compare in the slightest to the pain he felt at Tony being missing. God, Tony. Where was he? Was he even – what if he wasn’t – wasn’t…?
“Everyone needs sunscreen Tony,” he said primly. “Do you want to get melanoma?”
“Wait, wait,” Tony tried to breathe and retain a braincell or two with which to form a sentence. “You don’t have to do this.”
“Sure,” he managed. “Sounds swell.”
…which Steve got a good view of as Tony sauntered past him, declaring that he was going to lounge by the pool for a bit. Steve let out a strangled grunt.
) and then on the swamp cruise Thor wrestled an alligator and scared the crap out of their tour guide. Bruce and Nat bought frankly hideous flamingo shot glasses and a black shirt covered in flamingos for Steve. God bless him he actually seemed touched by the gesture.
Steve frowned.
“Greg, why’d you-? Oh.”
Once Clint’s laughter had died down, he managed to wheeze out, “A little out of character don’t you think, Iron Man?”
“Tony?” Steve asked quietly, brushing a dark curl out of the man’s eyes. He tried shaking the man’s shoulder gently. He glanced back at the rest of the team. “I can’t wake him.”
Tony was out there somewhere, he thought, as he watched the dirty-red water disappear down the drain. Tony was out there somewhere in danger and he didn’t have Steve there to protect him.
Tony and Clint high-fived. “Someone gets it.”
Clint cackled. “Comedy gold.”
“Tony, why are your toenails red, white, and blue?”
Reluctantly, he shrugged out of Steve’s grip and out of bed. Steve made a low growling noise and sleepily clung to him, but Tony was slipperier than an eel. Just ask his investment brokers.
The rest of the Avengers were only mildly less of a disgrace. Natasha was wearing a cute summer dress, sure (which upon closer inspection was actually decorated with tiny daggers), and Bruce was as inconspicuous as usual in a tee-and board shorts, but the rest of them… Clint had clearly decided to save time by wearing his bright purple swim shorts around, and a shirt that read ‘watch out, big and dumber coming through’. Thor’s tiny shirt said, ‘I’m big and dumber’. And he had crocs. Actual crocs. Tony wasn’t even sure if that could be blamed on Clint or whether the god had just rolled out of bed with a craving for awful footwear.
“Best redemption arc ever,” Clint nodded.
“No, I am honestly shocked that Steve won the competition – like all of you are. Don’t pretend I don’t know you tried to cheat, wonder twins, and Steve
“No sign of Tony, Captain” Thor replied.
And of course, the others, who had scooted in to hear, started laughing. Or rather, Clint and Thor were laughing (actually, Thor’s laugh was loud enough to alarm their fellow passengers. A mother across the aisle was giving him a very dirty look while her two tiny tots looked on in awe). Natasha was smirking and Bruce was kindly hiding a smile. Yep, definitely his favourite.
“No luck with our searches either,” Nat said. She looked to Clint, but he just shook his head.
“No, I don’t think he’s aware.” She rolled her eyes. “For someone with such a big heart, he has the emotional intelligence of a hedgehog.”
Again, slightly inappropriate thoughts to be having about your work colleague.
They collected their keys from a bored, middle-aged man at reception who was more interested in watching the next episode of
“I hate you.”
“You absolute fucker. You’re getting brought down by shady inn-keepers now?” Clint jibed. He flicked Tony on the arm. “I thought I was supposed to be the one with the shitty medical track record.”
The man barely glanced over at him from where he had his feet up on the bench, a playboy magazine balanced on his beer gut. He grunted the affirmative.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath in. He held it, counted to ten, and let it go. “It’s fine. Let’s just get this over with.”
“Steve doesn’t want to go to the beach,” Natasha informed Tony. There was a speculative gleam in her eye that Steve didn’t like at all.
Steve set his chin stubbornly.
And nope, nope, it was time to stop that line of thinking right now. For a time when Tony wasn’t dwarfed in his shirt. He eyed him smugly.
“A what?” Steve peered at him curiously. “Oh! You mean a me-me.”
“No, no, you’d love it,” Tony insisted, grabbing Steve’s arm. Steve tried to pretend that he didn’t live for the contact; that he didn’t wish Tony would cling to him all hours of the day. “Believe me, Aang would be your favourite for sure. A peaceful hero determined to save the world without bloodshed? You’re a dead ringer.”
And they’d be whole again once he got Tony back.
“Good. You’re awake.” Greg said. Unless Tony was imagining things, Greg looked a whole lot less pretty than the last time he’d seen him. The right side of his face was one giant mess of purple and green, and he was holding his arm funny. Something must have happened to him between last night and…and whenever it was now. How long had he been out?
Tony muttered a reply.
“Is that the one with the blue people?”
“Okay, nope, nope that’s enough. We can leave that right there. I’ve had enough let-down speeches to know when to give up on them. Cap.” Tony stared him straight in the face. “I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking telling you any of that, but it was inappropriate and misguided, and it will never happen again.”
“Come on cap, it’s Florida,” Clint whined. “You can’t go to Florida without going to the beach.”
“Tony-”
“Really,” Steve insisted. His face broke out into a giddy smile. Tony blinked at him rapidly. Steve looked like Tony felt – like he couldn’t believe his luck. Like he was only gradually accepting that this was real, that this wasn’t going away. He was allowed this. Steve raised an eyebrow. “Though we are going to talk about viral chest infections and not telling your teammates about illnesses which you would have gotten over much quicker had you not insisted on sneaking around and remaining in the field.”
“Florida,” Bruce said wryly. “Crime capital.”
That was problematic too. Because straight after seeing Tony wearing his things, came seeing the height difference between them. Out of the suit, or his usual lifts, Tony was several inches shorter than Steve. The fact that he had to step into his space and look up at Steve destroyed any attempt at intimidation and just left him…adorable. To Steve at least. He wanted to scoop Tony up into his arms and never let him go.
I never thought I would be lucky enough to have my feelings returned by you.” Steve’s eyes bore into his and Tony wondered how anything could be that blue. “You are the best man I have ever met and my favourite person on this planet.” He dipped in for a thorough kiss that left Tony quaking in his bedsheets. “I love you, Tony.”
He finished clearing the main floor, leaving a trail of unconscious and pitifully groaning criminals in his wake. “You think I’m bad,” he muttered. “Good luck dealing with the American health system.” He joined Natasha and Bruce downstairs. They’d only cleared the main room and so he went further down the darkened hallway, checking empty room after empty room. Until he found one that wasn’t empty. Until he found one with-
Though not the most surprising thing Tony had ever done – and boy, did Tony live to surprise them – it
Instead he took a seat on the lounge chair next to Tony and said the first thing that came to his head. “You really should put on sunscreen, otherwise you’ll burn.”
To say the situation went downhill after that was a drastic understatement.
“And you and the good Rhodes have not heard from him?” Thor asked.
Clint pouted. “Come on Tony, you have to play. Otherwise the teams will be uneven.”
“And you had a minor heart attack,” she said knowingly.
He smiled back softly. “I love you,” he said. Because it bore repeating.
It had to be.
His second was, “You tried to set Steve on
“Tony had a mild anaphylactic shock,” he hissed through gritted teeth.
“Are you okay?” Clint asked, pausing in his nail-painting. “You don’t usually pass out before the tenth drink. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were losing your edge.”
“No, I’m serious, you don’t have to worry about it. And I won’t let it affect our team life. It never should have happened in the first place.”
Tony rolled his eyes.
Perhaps with a nice tie-in about his parents dying in a car-crash, and how they’re continuing the family tradition.
Steve gaped at him, about to put that last part down to the head injury, when Tony continued.
wrong.
“Mike, calm the fuck down.” Greg snapped.
“Nothing,” he smirked. “Just protecting your body from the bad, bad UV rays.”
want to find him. So whatever it is, I’m not going to judge him for it, and I even promise that I probably won’t yell at him about it. At least, until after he’s safe.”
“What – what the fuck?” Tony spluttered.
Bruce was in old-man khaki shorts. He was pretty sure Thor was wearing crocs. It was ridiculous. It also warmed his heart with something other than the gently burning fury that had been present since he’d woken up alone. This was his ridiculous family.
“Pepper,” Steve said gently. “Tony is in trouble. He wouldn’t blame you for revealing something if you thought it would help us find him.”
Steve would admit, the shirt was a little loud for his taste. Mostly he just enjoyed wearing it to wind Tony up. And now of course, he also got to enjoy Tony wearing his clothing. God, he could just imagine Tony crawling out of bed in the morning and dressing himself in a button down that Steve had abandoned from a night of debauchery the evening before. And then Tony would look over his shoulder at Steve with that flirty little grin he had, and Steve would pull him back into bed for round two-
So they spent the day doing touristy things. They went sight-seeing on one of those hop-on, hop-off, open-top buses and took pictures of South Beach, Little Havana, and Coconut Grove. Steve took them to the museum to learn about Miami’s history (which, come on, it was
Tony’s sulk intensified. “Bruce, as the only team member not adding to this heaping pile of crazy, you have officially been promoted to my favourite.”
Steve couldn’t help a rueful chuckle.
“Talk to me Tony. Tell me something.”
“From the fucking Happy Day Inn?” Clint chimed in. Steve didn’t have the energy to remind him about appropriate speech on the intercom.
“Whatever hurts Tony hurts you too,” she said softly.
Steve was still trying to think of a way to get Tony alone and away from Clint that wouldn’t seem selfish and jealous when he chanced a look down.
“Well – I mean, I’m not sure if this had anything to do with the situation but – and you have to realise he asked me not to say anything so I – I really-”
Bruce, who was managing the phone while Nat held Steve’s knuckles under the running tap, fixed him with an exasperated look. “Broke the reception office. Broke the hotel owner. Not necessarily in that order.”
“Fair point,” Steve conceded with a wince.
Tony sighed. The hand that wasn’t currently pinned between Steve’s – and oh wow, Steve was holding his hand, holding it with both hands actually and wow his hands were warm, and big, and that was getting him all fluttery in all kinds of ways – pinched the bridge of his nose. “No,” he sighed. “If I won the pool I was planning to take you to Italy. I have a villa there – a nice, low-key villa – near the town of Palaia. I thought we could explore the countryside, go on a few wine tours, I could take Steve to the art galleries, and teach you all how to make pasta.”
He put his hands to Tony’s skin and Tony let out a breathy little
“No,” Pepper said. “Nothing. But JARVIS has just finished a background check on this hotel, and it looks like there’s been some shady stuff going on there.”
“Maybe next time.” Bruce’s eyes flicked to Steve’s and Tony suddenly remembered that there was a little something or two he might have said before he slipped into unconsciousness.
Steve felt someone – Bruce – put a hand on his arm but his questionable grip on his temper was rapidly unravelling. He leaned forward, barely noticing how his grip on the counter began to dent the cheap wood. “Listen,” he eyed the name-tag of this useless human being, “
“I wouldn’t worry about that,” Natasha piped in. “There’s no way you’re ever beating Heath Ledger.”
And then nothing. Steve shook his head to clear it of his daydreams. Tony didn’t like him like that, and he wasn’t going to press the issue. He valued his friendship too much to lose it. Instead he focused on unpacking his things and cleaning the sketchier surfaces with some wet wipes. He’d just about finished when Tony emerged from the bathroom, freshly showered and wearing an itty-bitty pair of swim shorts. In red. Steve’s brain immediately ceased functioning. They were so tiny they could almost be called speedos. And the way they
“It’s all part of the experience,” Steve insisted calmly. “Back in my day even this would have been a luxury. It’s certainly better than the last plane I flew in.”
“A really shoddy surveillance system,” was the best Clint had to offer. “Honestly, I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed.”
“You know how you never get upset about the stupid pranks Clint and Tony pull around the tower?”
?” Not that that was going to do much against Captain America. Still, he struggled against his bounds for a minute, furious despite the weak-ass attempt. They’d tried to burn his Steve alive.
“He’s noticed too but he’s as much in the dark as I am. He only figured something was up when he realised Tony had backed out of their sparring sessions for the last month. If there’s one thing Tony’s good at, it’s putting on a show.”
All the blood in Steve’s brain rushed to his cock.
Behind Tony, Clint mimed gagging. He frowned at the archer.
“Or having a soiree on top of the Eiffel Tower,” Natasha chimed in.
“No, you don’t,” Steve replied patiently.
“Sorry, sunscreen must have been cold, right?” he asked gruffly. Then he cleared his throat and set to work.
“Do you have a security guard then? Someone who might have been around last night when we think he disappeared? A janitor?
“Yes-?”
Strategy was second nature to him, and this kind of mission was second nature to them all. His family fanned around him, and after a quick stop for planning, they spread out. Thor and Clint took the rooftop entry while Bruce and Natasha slipped through a basement window. That left Steve to come in with a distraction straight through the front. It was hard not to think about how, if Tony was here, he would be at Steve’s side, going in the front door guns blazing. He was his automatic partner in everything.
“Just exhausted,” Tony said. He wasn’t going to tell them any more than that.
It was bright and early the next morning, the Florida sun only outshone by the harsh glare of the godawful Hawaiian shirt Steve was wearing.
Steve’s modus operandi also appeared to be perfect for distracting people, allowing the others to sneak in with relatively little resistance. The fire from a criminal on the second floor ceased abruptly and he looked up to see Thor standing over the man’s crumpled form like an avenging angel out of pop tarts. Steve nodded his head in thanks. However, these criminals also weren’t putting up much of a fight. Not because they had some nefarious and overly complicated plot to lure them in (thank you Doctor Doom), but because they were…useless. It was puzzling.
Hell. He was definitely going to hell for this.
This holiday was going to be just swell.
“And Pepper, I
“Those two idiots pull all kinds of stunts. Stunts that would have driven a normal man nuts. But you never get angry. The only time I’ve ever seen you upset was that time Clint spiked Tony’s smoothie with something he didn’t know he was allergic to-”
“I don’t need it,” Tony countered, not opening his eyes.
However, when Steve opened the door, even he fought a wince. It was small, dingy, dirty, and most importantly, there was only one bed. Some days Tony wondered if someone up there hated him. If so, it was probably his father. He surveyed the room in silence for a moment before grabbing a few things from his duffel and disappearing into the bathroom.
“You know what,” Nat said silkily, because of course she’d be the first to cotton on to his discomfort, “I think we should leave these two alone a moment. I think they have some things to discuss.”
“Who’s your favourite then?”
Despite his words – which had Tony more than a little hot and bothered under the collar – he ducked down to brush his lips against the palm of Tony’s hand. He was all fire and simmering heat, but he cradled Tony against him like he was oh so precious.
Steve’s above-baseline human hearing meant he could hear Pepper’s frustrated sigh with perfect clarity. “And he didn’t give you anything about Tony?”
“Tony! You’re awake! How are you feeling?” Bruce asked.
Chapter 2 coming soon ;)
A movement to his right startled him into alertness and he watched as Greg and the other man stepped forward.
“Well,” Tony spread his palms in the universal I-mean-no-harm gesture. “This is awkward.”
I’m not fond of flying.”
“I know,” she said gently.
This time Tony did crack an eye open, even if it was just to look at him disdainfully. “I won’t get melanoma, not with my Italian skin. I just tan.”
Meanwhile, Tony was half-hard and hoping his voice hadn’t come out as breathy as it had sounded in his head. He definitely wasn’t leaving the pool now. He had no way to turn over without Steve finding out how very comfortably uncomfortably his little sunscreen massage had made him. Curse Captain America for being so good with his hands…and Steve had such big hands too. Jeez, Tony needed a cold shower. Anything to get the sensation of his hands off his skin.
Steve wasn’t so sure. Tony had been delicate about relationships ever since Pepper. He knew Tony blamed himself for how it had ended and that he hated himself for hurting her. He also knew how devastated he’d been that it didn’t work out. He hadn’t had the best track record with relationships before that. Steve knew all about Sunset Bain, and then there had been the whole debacle with Madame Masque, and then betrayal from Rumiko too. And it wasn’t just romantic relationships that had left Tony less trusting. On one of those dark nights in the common room when neither of them could sleep, tony had confided in him the entirety of Obadiah’s betrayal. If he weren’t already dead, Steve wasn’t sure anything would have prevented him hunting him down that minute.
“Tony!”
Clint snickered. “Actually, it was a fireman’s carry.” He pulled out his phone to show him.
Steve’s lips trailed down Tony’s neck and he made an inarticulate groan. “Tony. Do I seem uncomfortable to you?”
Safe, loved, and at the centre of Steve’s world.
Steve strode back into the bedroom and politely took the phone from Bruce. “Pepper? Is there something you know that you’re not telling us?”
It was almost laughably easy how quickly Steve and the others managed to find Tony once they knew what they were looking for. After the small ‘incident’ with his room – and Clint was still teasing him over whoever had gotten a shot of him shitty, shirtless, and covered in ash for the front page – it was easy enough to find someone who’d clearly been in on it. The found a man waiting behind the inn and gave him the shake-down. He gave them everything they wanted to know. The names of the men who’d taken Tony, where they’d taken them, why they’d taken them.
Tony weathered it all, awkward and pleased by turns. Never mind how embarrassing it was to have been captured by low-time criminals, they had come for him. The Avengers had come for him and he was safe.
“What I don’t get,” Natasha said slowly, as she shut off the water with a decisive
So really, Tony was doing a service hiding it from them. Only right now, he was kind of regretting it.
“I-” Kiss. “Don’t want to-” Kiss, kiss. “Make you uncomfortable?”
“Right.” He squared his shoulders and marched to the front desk.
He tried to swallow, and a stab of pain flashed through his head again. “Ugh,” he moaned. God, it was just getting worse. He wasn’t sure how long he’d be able to avoid telling the team for at this rate.
On cue Clint poked his head over the back of Tony’s seat and grinned. “Please Stark, if you’d had your way, we’d be brunching exclusively at Disney land.”
Steve frowned faintly. “No traumatising the locals, Tony. I’m not sure I want to watch this show. Or film. Whatever.”
He cleared his throat. “Never mind, let’s go.” He used his Cap voice for good measure.
Tony opened his mouth but before he could shoot back a no-doubt caustic-but-witty retort, another bout of turbulence had him gripping his seat with a white-knuckled grip. Well. His seat, and Steve’s hand. Lucky Captain Perfect had the serum on his side, or the grip Tony had on him might be slightly uncomfortable.
A terrible thought was dawning on Tony though, one he couldn’t help but voice. “Let me get this straight – and please stop me if I’m wrong – but you don’t know who Steve is. You didn’t take me because of who he is or who I am or who my other travelling companions are, you just took me because I happened to stumble across your little coke slash human-trafficking slash what-the-fuck-ever operation as ass-o’clock in the morning and that’s it?”
“Sorry, sorry, not the time. We’ll talk about that later. Just stay with me okay?”
it pressed up against his ass. God, that felt
He shrugged into one of the inn’s godawful dressing gowns – then briefly regretted it, in case they had lice or something – and a pair of slippers, before slipping out the door. Ice. Even this hotel had to have ice, right? He spotted a container named so at the end of the landing and made a bee-line for it.
Everyone seemed to slump a little.
“You couldn’t at least have splurged for first class?” Tony asked, squirming in his seat.
This is completely different. Though that’s a good movie too,” he allowed.
Another man stepped out of the room over the object they’d dropped and yep, that was definitely a body. The man’s boot clipped the side of the bag and the bag let out of whimper. A live body at least.
Steve’s hands clenched into fists and the skin across his knuckles split wider, even as the super-serum started to kick in and heal them. Nat fixed him with a frustrated look. “Yes Pepper,” she said dryly. “I believe he is aware.”
“So when he tells me that he’s been feeling under the weather lately, I know it’s something more serious.” She huffed. “He’s been missing board meetings, falling asleep at work, and popping aspirin like they’re Halloween candy.”
“Steve,” Natasha laid a hand on his shoulder. “It’s going to be okay. We’re going to find him.”
Tony decided that was the perfect moment to lean up to capture Steve’s lips in his own. He struggled his way out his grip and forced them upright so he could crawl into Steve’s lap.
” Tony wagged a finger at the good captain’s face, but Steve’s placid smile remained firmly in place. “Secondly, the last plane you flew in
Tony sighed. He definitely couldn’t avoid his teammate’s enthusiastic clutches forever. Looks like Tony’s Tanning Time was over. Eventually (once he’d cooled off), they convinced him to join them. And they also ended up breaking the ball. And the net. And the pool. But Tony was fairly certain he could fix the last one before the owner noticed. Who knew? Perhaps he’d even improve it.
Steve pulled back. Okay, even by Tony’s standards that was a weak one. Steve stared him down a moment, before drawing both of Tony’s hands over his head, gently, reverently, until Tony was pinned in place and laid bare. He leaned in until his lips were brushing against Tony’s own, until they were sharing the same space, the same air, everything Tony had ever wanted and never imagined he could ask for.
The marked silence on Pepper’s end was damning.
“The beach?” Steve repeated dubiously.
Tony arched a brow but headed out without saying anything. Steve grabbed his beach bag and followed him without thinking. How could he think? He was lured by the sway of Tony’s ass, swinging side to side. It was hypnotising, like a pendulum, except infinitely better. Each curve was full and round, and Steve wanted to get a handful of each perky cheek and knead them. He wanted to pin Tony down and strip him out of those tiny shorts and lick him all over and –
“Oh yeah, now that’s fair.”
“Oh no, he’s in stampede mode,” he heard someone mutter behind him.
he got out of this.
Steve grunted. He could point out that Thor, and more rarely, Natasha also joined in on those pranks (though with Natasha, no one could ever prove it).
“Or bungee-jumping off the Kremlin!” Thor boomed jovially.
He cringed. “The thought alone is enough to make me break out in hives.”
“No. It looks bigger than that,” Natasha said. “I’m guessing Greg was working for someone higher up on the food chain.”
Tony blinked at the image of himself tossed over Steve’s shoulder like a bag of potatoes, one strong hand braced on his ass and the other arm wound around the back of his knees. He groaned and slumped back to the bed. He was so goddamn tired.
Greg and Mike didn’t response but exchanged a look that confirmed every one of Tony’s fears.
Steve, if Tony’s developed a thick skin about the things people say about him you should have developed at least
“Steve did
And he really had to stop thinking about this before certain parts of his anatomy made themselves hard to ignore. He was already half-hard, and he willed down his erection. They’d already made it down to the pool, he realised, while he hadn’t been paying attention. Tony was spreading out his towel over one of the rickety lounge chairs and lying down on this front. Which meant Steve could ogle all he liked. But he resisted. Just.
Clint slapped his leg. “Well, it’s a good thing you’re on vacation.”
Then of course, to top things off, the whole crew arrived down at the pool.
“I’ll pass for the moment,” he said. There was no way he was leaving this lounge chair until he had flagged.
“I don’t know.” Steve’s plush lips grazed over the corner of his neck and – yep. Right where the curve of his neck met his shoulder Steve gave it a nibble. “You could be being harassed?”
He was going to get him back.
“Um, really?”
I'm so sorry to anyone reading this who lives in Florida.
“Steve carried you.”
When Tony woke up in a cold sweat a few hours later, Clint was there putting nail polish on his toes. At that stage, he couldn’t even bring himself to be annoyed. “Where am I?” he slurred groggily. “How’d I get home.”
“Oh I think we should dedicate the next team meeting to that alone.” That melodic rumble was one Tony would know in his sleep, in his dreams, anywhere. He rolled his head to the side to where Steve sat by Tony’s bedside, steady as a rock and just as unreadable.
“You’re a menace,” Steve snarled, something animalistic in his voice as he helped pull Tony entirely into his lap. “And I really wish we were having this conversation in a different bed.”
Steve grinned at him. “And miss out on the ambience?”
“Steve
Tony woke up in hospital to two-hundred and twenty pounds of anxious super-soldier hovering over him. He could see the rest of the Avengers spread out over the room and he was so goddamn relieved he had to choke back a sob. Bruce was pacing while he read over Tony’s medical chart, Nat was sprawled with her legs over the side of a chair as she idly devoured what Tony was fairly sure was Russian erotica, and Clint and Bruce were taking turns throwing candy into each other’s mouths. Of course, the second Tony made a sound all attention was on him.
Steve looked at his brochure and then back up at the hotel. “I swear it looked better online.”
When they got to the beach however, Steve was ready with a back-up plan. The minute Tony disrobed Steve pulled his arms above his head and wrestled him into his own shirt. Tony spluttered at the indignity, but once the dust had settled, he simply stared down at the flamingo shirt in shock.
Once the kids were all tuckered out, they congregated in Tony and Steve’s room to watch crappy TV and devour a mountain of takeaway before Tony started groggily grumbling at them to leave so he could sleep.
Steve understood that. And in fact, Steve had been all for it a minute ago. Then he had remembered Tony’s itty-bitty red swim shorts. While it was one thing for Tony to wear such revealing clothing around him, he really didn’t want to fight with the entirety of the Miami coastline for Tony’s attention.
“You are pretty spry for an old fella,” Tony told him, sincere in his praise.
Tony cursed his hands and their inability to leave things alone. It was supposed to be a quick fix. But he’d bitten off more than he could chew. And in this case, broken it too.
“Is that thing in your chest keeping you alive?” Steve asked when he caught sight of the arc reactor sitting in his chest. Tony had been too self-conscious about the scarring to show it to him before.
Steve swallowed nervously and nodded. “Yes,” he murmured, and fixed his eyes on Tony’s sleeping face.
“It’s a mouthful,” Peter complained.
A loud squawk heralded Redwing’s landing on
He let out a sigh of relief before dissolving into giggles.
“Don’t do anything stupid till I get back,” Bucky said softly, as he placed his hand at the back of Steve’s head.
“Oh?” Steve asked as he cupped his left jaw. His thumb grazed Tony’s lips, which parted easily to grant him entrance. He leaned over and pressed his mouth against Tony’s, exploring it thoroughly as if in search of treasure.
“He’ll have to heat the cube to 120 million kevin just to break through the coulomb barrier,” Tony explained, as he felt his own body warming to his husband's ministrations.
“Your just desserts,” Jarvis said. “Though I’m sure you learnt your lesson?”
“Good. Because contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I am doing.”
Tony just whimpered in response.
Before they could pull a sheet over the body, Agent Hill whisked him off into her SUV. She spoke over the phone in hushed whispers, stressing to someone that they were operating under “deep shadow conditions”. Finally, after hours of driving down unmarked lanes that were off the map, she pulled into a nondescript compound in the middle of nowhere, referring to it as
It was just that he missed Tony - a lot.
Outside, the sun was shining brightly in the sky and the warm air was filled with the songs of the birds. Inside his blanket, already damp with his tears, Steve could feel himself fading in the dark.
“Good move,” he said, pleased, when Loki put his hands up in surrender.
Time was on their side and the enemy wasn’t due to arrive for some time, but Steve kept the briefing short and to the point, as if eager to get it out of the way.
“And you remember Lord Killian, don’t you?” Obie continued. “We call him Killiniladrach now.”
There was the familiar sweeping at the surface of his mind once again. The search was focused, beginning and ending with the keywords
“Leviathans!” Clint shouted, as he reached for an obsidian arrow, and shot one of the beasts between its eyes as it crept onto the deck, which soon began teeming with the fiery beasts.
“Oh my God. Get a room,” Rhodes groaned, as he appeared from behind them, looking a little too exhausted for someone who was supposed to be firing ballistas from the cliffs.
He frowned at the reply, which came almost immediately:
children joining them in their new home.
He typed a message:
He breathed a word, another word, in response. “Apollo.”
“Gotta say – that was a hell of a jump,” Tony said, and chuckled at the surprised looks on the other dragons’ faces when Steve made that recklessly brilliant mid-flight leap.
That was the response he wanted, wasn’t it? Then why did it make him feel so bad?
“These swords,” Obie explained, as he flashed them a grin full of teeth. “My spears,” he continued, while brandishing his talons in Tony’s face.  “And of course, the shields,” Obie added, as he twisted his body to show off his scales gleaming in the light.
Tony tried to focus on the positives of his marriage. Steve allowed him to have a career he loved, even going so far as to bulldoze the obstacles in his way. Steve always made time for him, and found a favourite spot in their workshop so he could watch Tony work.
Tony glared at the large purple hand, glowing with violent magic, and slapped it away.
“Hey, I’m here,” Rhodey assured him.
“Your saviours are here!” Loki announced. Leaping into the air, he transformed himself into a dark green dragon with golden horns, who executed a graceful flip and circled around to allow Thor to climb onto his back.
“Does it now?” she asked, flipping him onto his back in one move. And before Bucky could say a word, she hit him softly, on his mouth, with her own, subduing the breathless knight with her superior mouth-to-mouth combat skills.
He didn't cry when they took his watch, the Jaeger that his father left him, the gears in his mind already spinning as he plotted to get it back and fixed.
It was time to stand in a circle around the sacred rock.
The arrival of emergency vehicles had caused traffic to build up on both sides of the road, so they only got as far as the Farmer's Market before they were forced to slow down. Convinced that they wouldn’t get much farther, Tony turned into a parking lot beside some street vendors hawking homemade drinks.
Steve didn’t pursue the matter and turned his attention instead to the book on his bedside table. Tony had found
. He cringed, instantly regretting his stupid-ass decision to open his mouth.
it lacks a certain flourish, because that’s all you do. A lot of
Tony’s gaze trailed toward his long and strong neck, which widened into broad shoulders and well-built arms. He followed the lines of Steve's body, which tapered toward a narrow waist and what he already knew to be an ample posterior. Objectively, Steve was hot. And he was his husband.
They were happy to let Tony install JARVIS in the building, and the butler’s voice helped to keep him calm and level-headed when the A.I. wasn’t helping the other occupants with operating the lights, ordering pizza and keeping tabs on everyone’s comings and goings.
“Tony, we have to go. The emissary requests an audience.”
“That - is terribly inappropriate, your majesty,” Tony said, panting. “May I remind you - that we’re in a sacred place,” he said, gesturing to the shrine. “You will need to control yourself.”
"Yes, our home," Tony assured him with a quick squeeze to his hand.
To Tony’s horror, the masked man wasn’t working alone. His blood turned to ice as he saw Steve rip out the car door, covering himself and Natasha, as they ran into a hail of bullets. Like the gentleman he was, Steve pushed her out of the way, taking the heat.
It was time to suit up again.
“How do you know?” he asked.
He would have gone on gaping if not for the catapult-launched projectile that landed in his mouth, which caused him to bite down and choke. On grape juice. Trickling down his chin.
They continued to discuss Thanos and his acquisitions, trading stories to note a pattern of increasing violence. Steve learnt that the bloodstone had been the tyrant’s first, and he’d won it fair and square from Dormammu in a game of chess. The mindstone was inherited from his adoptive brother, King Maxwell, when the dragon king had passed.
Sarah leaned toward him and spilt some tea as she set her cup down. As she spoke, her eyes began to glaze over. “He is, which has been a miracle. Not one of us expected Steve to make it past his first birthday and by the time he was ten, we’d called on just about every healer from Brookland to Shieldberg in search of a cure, and that was when we met Lord Erskine.”
“I made a sui- a vehicle. It fl- hovered over the sand.”
It was Pierce who personally greeted them as they stepped out, giving them each a biometric pin. He explained that it would accord them unrestricted access to the Triskelion’s facilities, the main one being the observation room, from which they were to watch (and stop) the launch of the helicarriers.
“So do you,” Killian said and blow a giant fireball in his direction, which Steve deflected with his shield.
“Nope.”
“I freaked out,” Steve explained. “I wanted to protect the one thing I can’t live without. That’s you.”
He opened the lid to gaze at its contents and blinked as the cut surfaces reflected the morning light. Raking a hand through the gems, Tony relished the feel of precious stones – pearls, diamonds, sapphires, emeralds and rubies, slipping through his fingers.
But Steve was too far gone to hear what he was saying. “I made you give it to me. I'm sorry. I knew it was wrong. It felt wrong. It killed me. When you left,” he managed to choke out between tiny sobs.
And Steve had understood. Tony and Tyranaksthon were one and the same. How could they be different if they were always together?
Tony sucked in a quick breath and exhaled. “J, it is so good to be home.”
we fight, so we can end the fight - and go home. Be it to husbands, wives, children or to see the face of God. Tonight, we battle. For family, for freedom, for Armeria!”
“Don’t laugh.” Bucky growled. “She means it.”
“Then stay in the control unit to reverse polarity long enough to disengage maglev.”
There was a longer pause, this time to allow the weight of Steve’s words to sink in, before Steve began moving on Star, raising his sword and pointing it to the enemy. “They hurt you? Hurt them back. Get killed? Walk it off. You ready? Then, into hell’s mouth we ride - to a glorious death!”
“I’m muscular,” Obie argued.
“Yes, yes, it is very important to him” the dragon agreed, and flashed a row of the brightest teeth Steve had ever seen. “But giving them to me is akin to handing it to Tony. We’re inseparable, attached. We’re connected, you see?”
“What book?” Nat asked, confused.
Steve slapped the wing away. “I’m fine,” he snapped.
“There’s breakfast,” Steve said, and stretched out his arm toward the door in what he hoped was a welcoming gesture. “If you guys eat that sort of thing.”
“If I win, I want another kiss,” Tony said, while he climbed onto Stripe.
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Clearly, you don’t know the prince - or our women.”
“Good,” Tony said, smiling at him. “Now I will be able to keep track of you and know you’re alive.”
“Oh? How did you want it to be?”
At some point, Steve rushed to help Rhodey and then Peter was in the throne room, popping in and out of portals which appeared and disappeared to take swipes at the furious emperor.
A hand reached out to him just as he felt himself going under, and Steve soon found himself in his mother’s arms.
“It is,” Tony said quietly, and he knew in his heart that he was right.
With the longest stick he found, he drew a circle around himself in the sand. It’s a primitive way to tell the time, using one’s shadow. But he was all he had. Before he could mark out the last numerals, the first ones were gone, distorted by the winds of change.
Ivan was right behind Tony, conjuring up a thunderstorm. A crack of his tail and one of the trees split right down the middle. Another split more trees into two.
Tony felt the corners of his lips moving upwards, like Steve’s. “It seems like you were some sort of a late bloomer. But everyone seems to love you anyway.”
Then, swiftly, so as not to suffer frostbite, Peter flung her frozen body through another Strange portal, which conveniently appeared three dragonlengths away.
Tony was clever, but he was on Valorian soil, and Steve knew Conewood Forest like the back of his hand. He didn't take long to chase him past the wisterias to the edge of a cliff, which forced the prince to stop and dismount.
But also, a stepping stone.
There it was. The hard truth, the comet, rocketing towards the sun.
(See the end of the chapter for
Captain Rogers, or Steve, seemed nice, much nicer than in any of the scenarios Tony had imagined. He hadn't forced Tony to do anything so far. And he seemed genuinely upset when he found out that Tony had not been a willing participant in this marriage.
Knowing that Tony was a dragon, like the good-natured Peter, and the honourable Rhodes, and how even Wanda and Pietro could see past their own pain to do what was right, Steve realised that it had never been the dragons he feared, but pure, unadulterated evil.
Steve leaned over Nat’s body, and his eyes stung with hot tears as he moved in to kiss her cold forehead.
Nat shuddered. “He’s crazier than I thought.”
“Steve,” Tony interrupted. “I don’t understand. Now, you want me to be Iron Man?”
“Never change, JARVIS. Thank you.”
“Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are in retirement homes," Steve said. "So, no, not really.”
The icy water cleansed away everything superfluous, drowning out the distractions. In a chilling moment of clarity, his body learnt that oxygen was what his cells needed to survive. Nothing else mattered.
Above the lingering traces of smoke, Tony got a whiff of slightly-overcooked blueberry waffles topped with fresh cream, honey and unmated
Of all the words in the English dictionary, the word
“Was it really your friend?”
“Which one?” Steve asked, guardedly, looking wary and uncertain. Like he thought Tony was a loose cannon.
"Hi," he greeted nervously. "Were you out?” he added, stealing a quick look. 200 pounds of alpha was in the way, glowing with perspiration against the morning sun.
“Yes, of course,” he said, by then unable to keep the excitement out of his voice. The others, confused by his behaviour, just looked at him with concern, like he had lost his mind.
He picked up the elegant piece, marvelling at Steve’s magical ability to turn art into science and science into art. And what he had in his hands was nothing short of beautiful and poetic.
“Soon. Soon, you will hold my heart in your hands,” he promised.
The Avengers were ready to dive in to rescue the oppressed but until they got the proper clearance, their hands were tied.
What are you not telling me?” he demanded to know.
“And you want to go in? Alone?”
with you till the end of the line.”
Tony opened and closed his mouth. The sleep deprivation must be affecting his memory. He’d been so mad at Steve the previous day. Forget
AKA: A bunch of people standing in a room watching Tony sleep.
“I’d say 'yes'.”
“You have to talk to him,” Peter said.
“It’s yours. It’s always been yours. Do you like it?” he asked in a hopeful voice.
The knights were already gathered where their border guards had spotted the Anguisian - on a cliff overlooking the sea.
Steve swallowed hard and found himself getting emotional. The star on the shield, and the red and blue rings, was a symbol of their alliance. As long as the shield flew overhead, it would serve as a beacon of hope.
“Good question,” he said, and wondered the same thing himself.
Tony closed his eyes, the stale air causing him to feel a little dizzy. “Is that a threat?” he asked, as Steve continued his assault on his neck.
“Your body is telling me to do the exact opposite,” Killian breathed, tightening his hold. “I am going to have so much fun with you, you little slut."
The queen was glaring at Lord Strange, with her small hands balled up into fists. “Why won’t it work?” she demanded, and looked at the sorcerer as though she was ready to strike.
By the light of the setting sun, they watched as the lovebirds danced around each another in a ritual. How they took turns to be the pursuer and the pursued, the give and take, the back and forth, before finally meeting in the middle.
A sad look in the eyes, followed by a quiet smile and a cheerful reply, with all the sincerity and affection in the world. “We had you.”
Panicking, Tony cursed himself inwardly.
“Captain.”
Steve frowned at the words, for
Sighing, Tony brushed away the tears from Steve's eyes with the pads of his thumbs. "Steve, you are not a bully. Yes, you were mean and you made me feel small and helpless and betrayed. And it wasn't a good feeling. It sucked. And it made me all kinds of furious.”
“Wait,” Wanda said, interrupting them. “You never said anything about the human race. And why are you trying to recruit him? Our mission is to destroy the Starks and bring an end to the Iron Age. We were supposed to stop the war and oppression, make the world a better place.”
“You're a lot heavier than you look,” Tony grumbled when he set Steve down, as gently as he could. Only for him to be violently pushed off the edge.
Steve nodded, and made no protest as Tony took his arm.
Tony furrowed his brows, hardly reassured. He had to do something, offer comfort in some way. “You hungry?” he asked.
"Thanks, Steve. You didn't have to do that."
She leaned against his chest. “Me too,” she said.
“I had hoped to see him again, you know? Even wished he was with us at the Gladioli Fields, but of course, that’s so selfish. Why would I want him there?” Steve paused to let out a soft sigh. “Could never convince him to stay away from a fight. I don’t know how you did, and that’s why you’re the one for him, Schellehead. Tony was right to choose you.”
Inside the throne room, secrets are revealed.
“Acid!” Steve yelled, and raised his shield to protect them both from the boiling liquid pouring down. “Go high!” the king urged, so Tony spiralled upward to escape the venomous female.
“Yes, sir. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I really am -” Tony apologised, refusing to look at him.
“Is it the light? It’s a bit much, isn’t it?” Tony asked, referring to the arc reactor.
He must have been called away urgently, leaving behind an incomplete note:
As Tony bemoaned his missing share of pie, it forced Steve to appreciate just how much the prince had given up to be here with him. And it wasn’t even that he had Valorian hospitality to make up for the missed celebrations.
It was Steve’s.
Dressed in mismatched armour, none of his knights looked like they were attending a wedding, but on their way to battle. And it made sense. They were gathered not to celebrate love, but to arm themselves for the impending war.
Wanda looked at Steve, face bruised and bloody, but still getting up. “They’re... something else.”
There wasn’t anything wrong with being a moon. The moon never attacked, keeping only to its course. Yet, it held an invisible and profound sway over others. No other body could pull an ocean from shore to shore.
Scoffing, Pietro ran his fingers along the cool blade. “Homo Sapiens and their steel,” he said, and paused to admire the sapphire stone in the pommel.
It was a universal story of greed – for gold and glory. Yet, the same tale, read by a dragonet who’d been orphaned at the hands of mankind, bore little resemblance to his bedtime stories of his childhood.
“Tony, just like we practised!” Steve shouted, when Glaive made his second pass.
. In our kingdom, he’s practically a god.”
“You’ve got to be kidding me. That’s what we go to war over? A stone?” Clint whispered, hoarsely.
A tiny memento, even a small seed, would have offered him some sort of consolation. If he planted it on his mountain and nurtured it dutifully, it might one day reveal the secrets he was after, but with how rarely the heartewoode bloomed, even that had been wishful thinking on his part.
For some time, Steve’s calming presence in his mind had kept the nightmares away. But where the bond had once been was now a void, leaving room for the monsters to come back. Something must have triggered the memories, many he wished to forget and more he knew he could not.
It was a workshop.
“Great,” the alpha responded, completely unimpressed.
“Didn’t know dragons ate sandwiches,” Steve shouted and threw the shield at Ivan, but managed only to chip a sea stack.
“Our roads are fraught with danger,” Tony began. “And, well, you know, anything can happen.”
His time bomb of a temper began ticking, so by the time Steve returned to the tower, post-mission, something about a hijacked vessel named
Steve shrugged. “I don’t know. For some reason, I’ve always felt perfectly at home right here.”
“Yeah- yeah, I do,” Tony said, desperate to leave the ballroom, which was getting a little too warm and stuffy for his comfort.
The Ten Rings never stood a chance against him in the Mark I. They tried, oh how they tried. But their gunfire and explosions were pathetic and useless against his armour.
,” Tony continued, in a conspiratorial whisper. “And not just any dragon, but Thanos, The Mad Titan – and he had his heart set on the stone.”
“No, you’re not,” Steve agreed. His voice was quiet, contemplative. “Sometimes, I forget how far you’ve come. You aren’t the fearful boy I married, the one hid his tools in his underwear drawer and never looked at me.”
Steve was shaking his head. “But what am I talking about. Of course, Tony isn’t a dragon. He can’t be.”
Steve could hear Tony’s bright laugh from far away. “Always a pleasure, my precious treasure.”
“Among other things, yes,” Steve explained, tone dry.
A N T Y R A K S T H O N
A rocket-propelled grenade launched Steve off the freeway, through the windows of a bus. Nat leapt off after him, disappearing from their screens.
Tony snorted. “That’s ridiculous. You love
“Are you mad?”
Despite the fatigue in his body, Steve felt at peace and it was the best feeling in the world. He began to wonder how he’d lived through all those battles without Tony by his side. With him, Steve felt like they could do anything in the world. But first, they needed a holiday. Or that honeymoon he planned. Even the prospect of a warm bath and bed sounded like heaven. They made their way toward Peter, who was taking Star and Stripe to them.
He told JARVIS to inform the captain he was leaving and reminded DUM-E to be good for his pops, programming him to manage the meals, housekeeping and laundry. Then, with a heavy heart, he waved goodbye to his robot child as the doors swished shut.
Pietro moved forward to stand beside his sister. “And who decides who’s weak?” Pietro asked, as he turned the shield over to look at its underside.
What was left of the free world would turn their eyes toward Valoria, in the hope that they would put a stop to the emperor’s conquest. And they would be led by Steve, a brave warrior with blue eyes and red lips. Lips that were opening and closing and speaking at the very moment.
“Steve?” he called softly, taking note of his marble-like countenance and glassy eyes.
He felt his hand being squeezed. “Tony?”
“I’m not going to fight you. You’re my friend.”
Find the right star and it will lead you home.
“As long as it isn’t a repeat of spring break 1987,” Rhodey teased.
, a chain of volcanoes which bordered their neighbours in the north. The fiery peaks rested like the spikes of a great beast, who’d fallen into a restless sleep. Squinting to keep out the midday sun, Steve’s eyes traced over the towering mountains in the east toward the squat hills in the west, which curled back around like a tail.
“Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?” Steve asked, as he stroked Tony's back.
Once upon a time, Steve had been happy. Life had been full of warmth, joy and hope, all of which had vaporised into thin air when the dragon had revealed his secret. Steve squeezed his eyes shut, and willed his body to stop thinking, to stop feeling, to just stop.
“I’m sorry. What?” he said when he finally noticed Steve looking at him. He was smiling tenderly at him too, as if he were his favourite person in the world. “There you are,” he said. “I missed you.
“Thank you,” Steve whispered as he dismounted carefully from Tony’s back. The armour must have been uncomfortable, and the helmet was soon removed, with Steve rubbing his aching crown and sore temples. A free hand swept aside the long bangs sticking to his forehead, and it revealed his face in the light of the setting sun.
Tony made a sound of frustration. “You greenhorn,” he shouted. “Give me back my Rhodey!”
“We need to talk.”
“That was me, even if you hadn’t known it then,” Tony said, as he remembered how Steve had ridiculously thought he was in love with his dragon self at some point. “Even when I thought you hated me and wished I’d never come, I could never keep away.”
“No, it won’t. It goes on forever, like you. Look, my love, it flies.”
“Oh,” Tony said, and his face began to change. “I do have something I need to talk to you about, and I’ve put it off way too long already.”
Steve cradled his human hand, which was already wet with his hot tears. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he asked.
A few nights ago, he’d had a dream. About having a kid. With Steve. It had been so real. And it gave him a major case of baby fever. And now he constantly thought about raising their brood together.
Tony’s heart skipped a beat and came to life. “He’s been moping?”
Slim fingers felt for the medallion and traced its ridges as Tony wondered how long he could keep his secret from his new family. Perhaps, they would one day accept him if he proved himself and showed he was worthy of their trust. Till then, he would keep his powers well buried, like one would hide the most precious of gems.
Speeding giants on a collision course, they glared at each other for more than a moment.
“No, not many,” Steve assured her. “Still, each of the fallen is a friend, our dearest blood."
Skipping up the stairs, two at a time, Tony soon arrived at the top deck, which offered a breathtaking view through the large glass dome and windows. Distracted by the starlit sky, it took a while for him to notice the small door leading out to the balcony, where he found his husband, gazing pensively into the night.
Steve laughed in spite of himself. “I must have told it a hundred times.”
A second roar roused him to action. While keeping an eye on the trio of black dragons hovering above the riders, Tony made haste to light the beacons around the fortress. The winds would blow the smoke in the direction of Shieldberg and warn them of their enemy’s intentions.
And Tony was filled with a surge of emotions, so intense they threatened to spill from his lips.
And it dawned on him, why he hadn't been able to say those words. Telling someone you loved them made you vulnerable. It meant stripping one of their armour, their clothing, even their skin to bare their heart.
Steve raised a brow, waiting for Tony to elaborate.
Relentlessly, the army of berserkers pushed them back, and it forced the Valorians to the very edge of the field. It was imperative for them not to retreat any farther. Once the enemy found their way past the last line of defence, they would make their way for the city gates.
“Thank you,” Pietro said. “This means a lot, coming from you.”
Wings spread out by his sides, Tony leaned his head back and willed his muscles to relax, and slowly fell backward into a dive. As he plunged, he kept a lookout for the canopy of the Wanderer’s Woods, and zoomed in on a clearing where he would land.
Yet, somehow, Tony always felt drained, and his light sparked and dimmed unreliably.
He even smirked when they took his wedding band (early in his captivity before they figured out who he was), read the inscription and freaked out when they realised he hadn’t been lying about being married to Captain America.
Even though the Black Order hung back, and waited in the wings, Tony joined the fray, keeping a lookout for the enemy dragons and a watchful eye over Steve, who was the first to engage by knocking one of the berserkers off his horse with a wave of his shield.
With a snap of his fingers, Loki conjured up a goblet of wine, which rapidly filled to the brim and overflowed into a couple of vipers.
Despite his impressive levels of endurance, repeated attacks to Obsidian’s head and wings caused the large dragon to tire and when that happened, Steve scored a powerful hit to Obsidian’s sensitive snout, which stunned the dragon long enough for Tony to bathe his entire left wing in liquid fire.
He shook his head, looking miserable. “Steve said
Thankfully, the suppressants he'd taken (somewhat regularly) prevented him from going into a full cycle, although he had been uncomfortable and very embarrassed.
“Let me in.”
“Dragons?” Nat asked, as she eyed Sam with interest.
, which produced an incinerating burst of fire that scorched the tip of her tail as she tried to flee.
Oddly, Tony could hear the sounds of blowing wind and a quick rap of his knuckles against those heavy wooden shelves revealed that the wall behind them wasn’t as solid as it looked. Tony ran his fingers across the spines of the books, and imagined Steve doing the same as a child as he embarked on his own little treasure hunt. “Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door,” he mumbled.
Thanos shrugged. “Collateral damage,” he said.
The man’s eyes darkened. “You’re going to regret this,” he warned as metal flashed in his hand. He broke out of their hold and lunged for Nat, going straight for her neck. She twisted out of the way and deflected the attack with a blow of her own, sending him toward Bucky, who disarmed him quite easily by taking his dagger before kicking him toward the edge of the cliff, dangerously close.
launching in a few days. Nothing I could say to change Pierce’s mind about the captain. Or you. I could keep him here, pained and miserable, as I harvest what I can. Or, I could let him go right now, so you can spend your last few days together, saying your tearful goodbyes.”
“I don’t know,” Steve admitted, and got to his feet. He shuffled to the window, gazing outside at the beautiful stars in the night sky.
It had to be the farthest thing from the truth, but the words had given him the courage to accept Tony’s mission, and he had kept the stone safe until Tony had needed it most.
“Yeah,” Steve said, and quickly recovered his composure. “Sorry. I just - where’s Tony?” he sheepishly asked.
Steve turned to Tony and met his astonished gaze. He reached out for Tony’s hand and squeezed it gently in his. The rest exchanged awed looks as they watched an oblivious Bucky sobbing over a slowly-reviving Nat.
Tony cupped the man’s cheeks and gently turned him around so he could face him properly. “Do you know why I never told you – about being a dragon? The simple truth is – I wasn’t one. While that encounter with Thanos all those years ago had changed my body, all I could do was light fires and heat things up. It was only that day at King’s Isle, when Killian threatened to have you killed that my body went through the transformation, sparked by the singular goal of keeping you safe.”
,” his dad had said. “It appears in the same place each night to guide travellers on their journeys. If you’re lost and all alone, finding the right star will lead you home.”
“Wait!” Tony shouted, in between violent coughs from the acrid fumes that filled his nose and lungs.
“Yep. Just tying up a few loose ends.”
“I do,” the sorcerer agreed.
Natasha chimed in, “Right, Steve and I caught his act at Stuttgart.”
“You know me,” Steve gasped, despite the death grip on his neck.
Pietro’s face hardened and for a moment, he looked older than his eighteen years. “My heart is full of hate,” he said, a trail of smoke leaving his mouth as he spoke through clenched teeth.
Bucky put his hands around Steve’s face and touched his forehead to Steve's. “Are we good now?” he asked.
“I’m sorry, Steve,” Tony said, unimpressed. “You are being dangerously arrogant. Has anyone ever told you that you can be quite reckless?”
Tony laughed and took no offence, as he knew just how much Steve adored the armour and sword and shield and everything that he made, and how he often made excuses to stay in the smithy to watch him work.
But Tony had stepped into the portal.
“Homo Draconi and their gems,” Tony retorted, almost on instinct, as he masked his concern for Steve, who was being held by magic against another marble column at the end of the room.
He was Iron Man.
They took the long way back, which began with a detour to the Wanderer’s Woods, where they’d met all those years ago. As they passed Rockehenge again, Tony felt Steve’s strong arms tightening around his neck, and he reflected on how the strings of fate had helped them find their way to each other, even if Tony hadn’t known it at that time. They cruised by Ferrumarx on their way to King’s Isle, where they tried to spot the cave in the darkness, before they finally headed home.
“I’m sorry-” Steve said, without missing a beat. “Can we do that again?”
“Oh. We aren't riding on horseback?”
Ivan laughed. “Thanos is the most powerful among us.”
When it was time to say goodbye, Tony lingered in his mother’s embrace, breathing in as much of her scent as he could. When he finally tore himself away, he found his father looking at him with a soft, almost tender expression. He recalled the last hurtful exchange they’d had.
“It’s subtle,” Tony agreed, smiling fondly at him.
It was a fine day for riding. The afternoon sun had mellowed and a cool breeze had blown in. Tony had been content to ride beside him at first, but by the time they were almost through the meadows, Tony had picked up the pace, occasionally pulling away from the rest of the group.
Then Steve introduced him to Miss Romanov.
Tony remembered a man who loved Science and Technology. Obie gave him his first toolbox, convinced his dad to send him to MIT, offered to marry him – wow he really dodged
Tony flashed him an incredulous look. “This was your plan.”
And fought they did. Like the reciprocating pistons of a well-oiled engine, they had each other’s backs, whittling their opponents down till they were the only ones left.
“You’re leaving,” he said, his voice plaintive. “I heard you the other day – talking to your parents,” he confessed.
“But the prince is staying, to help us. He will need a home. And I – we can give him one.”
- trailed off, as the airman entered the workshop.
“Yeah?” Steve asked, clearly pleased. When Tony nodded, he asked, “We could arrange to spend summers at your home. Would you like that?”
He plucked at the loose threads on his jacket, surprised at how much they resembled fraying insulation, a potential hazard unless masked with tape.
Growing up, Tony had wanted the stones, and thought of the Infinity Spell as a way to reverse his curse, but there were more important challenges to face in today's world.  He'd wish for peace, perhaps a suit of armour around the world, or Armeria at the very least, to keep his families, old and new, safe from harm.
“Are you settling in nicely?” Sarah asked, when they finally managed to sit down together.
For a few tense moments, Tony watched the rise and fall of the other man’s chest as his breathing became more regular and less laboured. It took much longer for the colour to return to his cheeks and lips, andthat gave Tony plenty of time to study his soot-covered hair, lightly-freckled complexion and the long eyelashes resting on his high cheekbones.
Steve let himself into the three-storey temple, peacefully silent apart from the sound of his own footsteps. Slowly, he made his way down the narrow corridors, walls on both sides lined with never-ending shelves of books, before arriving at the great hall, where a number of magical relics were on display.
“Twenty-one,” he corrected, even though what he really felt like was a hundred.
“I love your mouth – and everything that comes out of it – and your eyes and your hair and everything else I haven’t had the chance to see.”
The air left his lungs as Tony grappled with this revelation. For some reason, Steve had thought he was going to leave and what was worse was that he was about to let him too.
“That wasn’t so hard. It was fun, right?”
“It’ll be fine,” Steve answered, rubbing his back. “They’ll have elections, choose Bucky this time.”
“Okay, partner,” Tony said. “What’s the play?” he asked, deferring to his battle experience.
Steve recognised the label from his time with Lord Erskine. For centuries, the Erskines had safeguarded dragontears, believed to be the tears of Rex himself that had rained down on the night of his passing. The Erskines had had the foresight to collect as much as their receptacles could hold, and after sharing it sparingly with trusted mages like the Ancient One, who must have given some to Strange, they kept the rest for themselves, passing it down from one generation to the next.
The crisis wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.
Steve’s face hardened with determination as a gold, sparkly circle opened up above them. “I think you’ll find
“Did you write the report?” he questioned, trying his best to keep his face and voice neutral.
The bond.
“Ah – well,” Tony sputtered, as his cheeks grew warm. “That’s – you know? Just doin’ what needed to be done.”
Falsworth’s
When Tony thought about hitting rock bottom, he never thought it would literally be due to a rock, a piece of rubble that had got trapped between layers of his clothing from the explosion.
Then, a blur of silver, red and blue whizzed into the helicarrier, landing on the ground in front of him.
Despite his efforts to stay still, Steve began to stir and his heavy eyelids fluttered open.
Or not at all.
Steve’s own stomach twisted uneasily as he looked at Bruce in confusion.
Steve smiled at that. “I didn’t quite know what to expect when your father called this morning and said you’d be meeting me in his place. But if we’re supposed to be on a date, then I was right to bring this.”
“It requires at least one of each type of dragonstone – of that I’m sure. I don’t know the details, but Lord Strange or one of the Asgardians might be able to enlighten you on that.”
Tony had been cleaning his room, sorting things into piles, when he found his comics:
“Love you too!” Bucky yelled back, and blew a kiss at Sam from the ground.
The mountain trembled, causing rocks to crumble and slide down the steep slopes. While vast spires of smoke billowed up, walls melted and crashed down. A loud rumble rose to a deafening roar as the mountain heaved and cracked.
“I don’t know,” Tony mumbled. “Is he even real?”
“Ye- Yes” Tony replied, just before he got hit by painful cramps from deep within his belly. And the slick.
“I didn’t eat him,” Tony added, heaving a sigh of relief when the king lowered his sword. “Tony is fine. Can't explain right now. Besides, I don't think you'll ever believe me.”
Thor put a hand on his shoulder. “Not like this, my friend. If something happens to you, Anthony will never forgive himself.”
“What’s the situation in the control room?” Steve asked, pushing Clint for a status report.
“And now, I’ve ruined everything. Was there anything? You shouldn’t have married me. I'm not good enough.”
Her feet came off the dash, and she scrambled onto Steve’s lap, firing back. The assassin punched through the roof and ripped off the steering wheel, tossing it into the path of an oncoming truck. Steve hit the brakes, throwing the assassin off. With an impressive tumble, he landed on his feet, dragging his metal arm through the tarmac as he came to a stop.
Strange, oblivious to his faux pas, lifted his left hand and the bun rose into the air, breaking neatly into two layers with a flick of his right wrist. The bottom half of the bun landed on a plate, followed by a slice of cheese, a slab of steak and some fresh lettuce, topped only by the rest of the bun.
Basking in the last rays of the evening, Tony took Steve the long way around the park, pointing out his favourite spots, so they could share an ice-cream cone. They took turns to devour the melting dessert, and Tony felt his heart overflow with sweetness. So, when Steve’s hand circled his wrist, he shyly laced their fingers together, and beamed when the alpha closed his fingers around them.
Tony looked at him thoughtfully. “You know what? That might actually work.”
"You can't make her do anything," Rogers butted in, jaw set in anger again. He was always jumping to her defense, even after Ultron. Even after
“Yes breathe. Please breathe. If Steve found me in here with you not breathing he’d fucking kill me.”
"I hate to interrupt as this is going so well," Fri's sarcasm was lost on no one, and from the corner of his eye he saw Shellhead jerk at hearing a voice that wasn't JARVIS. "But we have another problem. There is an unidentified craft rapidly approaching, one unlike anything I have ever seen, and they are... 'requesting' permission to land using the tower's facilities. Sir," she paused, sounding both baffled and furious. "Captain Rogers is demanding he and the rogue Avengers be allowed to come and, in his words, save you."
"No, it's completely fair. They're always coming here for everything. Christmas, birthdays, even that wedding reception." Why, oh
somebody, somebody who would let her chat with squirrels and make sure she had more to wear than jeans that were more holes than fabric. Somebody to patch up all the little scratches she wore like badges of honor, and who would help her figure out if her ability began and ended with her ability to communicate. He and Tony had raised several kids who had turned out pretty damn well - there wasn't any reason that 'somebody' couldn't be the two of them, so long as Tony agreed.
And honestly, Tony didn't talk much for the rest of the interview. He seemed happy to just be there, always touching Steve in some small way. They looked at each other like there was no one else in the room sometimes, and it felt unbearably private and intimate. The two of them are absolutely a couple, and I think those few news outlets still denying and demonizing said relationship might want to accept it and move on. Sitting there, watching them, it felt like one of the immutable laws of the universe: the sun rises in the east, the moon orbits the earth, and Tony Stark and Steve Brian Rogers are in love.
stay still enough to keep Tony right where he was, but he gave it his best effort. The water was going to do him in if anything was, so a heartbeat after his wonderful surprise Steve carefully lowered the water bottle. He and Tony were staring into each other's eyes and his face was on fire like it always seemed to be whenever the other man was around. It might have been romantic if he didn't know that Tony only saw him as a friend.
"Does he always speak for you?" Winter ignored the growling protest Rogers immediately lodged - he still hadn't even glanced at him. "I can shoot him so he has to go to medical for a while. Probably heals up as quick as Stevie here, but it'd give you a few minutes of privacy at least."
"I'll try. Harley? Thanks for, you know. Listening and everything."
are, and I am not... I almost got that kid killed! He almost died because of me, and now you want me to-- no. No. He's better off without me, alright? He was doing just fine before I dragged him into a fight he wasn't nearly ready for."
"I'm supposed to know you."
But Tony was a different story. There was no way he'd let himself rest easy at the compound, not with Wanda's magic still fresh in his mind. If he wanted his lover to fall into an actual sleep, one that was healing instead of draining Tony further, he needed to get his guy home.
Because they were all giant nerds, they had made an entirely unnecessary facade for their 'jumps'. A Stargate had been the clear choice, and watching people walk through it always gave him a little thrill. To be going through it himself... it was starting to feel more exciting than frightening. Butterflies  were starting to rise in his stomach, the same kind he got in the 'shop or in Peter's lab. This wasn't going to be 'fine' - this was going to be great.
“We can get Italian,” Steve answered almost immediately. “We haven’t placed the order yet, so--”
Warmth spread through his whole body, heart skipping a beat before settling into a steadier, more solid rhythm. Other people had told him the same thing, but Tony was the first one that he
What kind of concerns and who has raised them?
just--"
STAR didn't have any trouble keeping up though. She butted into the conversation with ease, earning a bigger smile from Winter. When she came to hover in front of the man's face, he lifted one hand and offered it to her in invitation. With an unbearably smug air - Shellhead had liked her first and now Winter did too - she took it and landed delicately on his palm.
They were both dead tired when they finally got to the tower and stumbled off the Quinjet. Steve knew they really ought to deal with whatever Fri had been talking about and then eat something, but their bed was calling and he didn't think he was strong enough to resist. She had said that it wasn't anything bad - surely it could wait until after they'd had a nap. In the elevator Tony sidled up to him and then half-collapsed, his head ending up on Steve's shoulder. He pressed a few kisses against the man's hair, not caring that it was sweaty and lank, wondering if maybe the elevator wouldn't be fine for a nap after all.
"Fi-fi?" Steve mouthed, looking as baffled as Tony felt.
If he ever
"It's black tea, Tony. A Yunnan blend - just try it. You might like it."
Not when he was such a fuck-up and not when he had problems demonstrating his own fondness for people in a socially acceptable manner. He'd sort of figured that he was lucky as hell to have the few people that he did, and even if he didn't deserve them he loved him with all the strength his broken heart could muster. With them it had become easy, second nature - he knew when they were showing that they cared.
Affection from his boys was more easily earned. Their love for him was as uncomplicated and easy as his love was for them. Even while he scolded and threatened, it was second nature for him to run fingers over their struts and claws, or for them to drape themselves carefully over his shoulders. J showed affection through dry wit, sarcasm and the way he was constantly just there. Sure Tony had initially programmed some of that, but he knew that now most of it was by choice. They were a little tightly knit family that Tony had never, ever thought would get any bigger.
I'm here on official Accords Committee business for the UN--
"We were gettin' off topic anyway, so I'll torture you later. This ain't a vacation house."

Hope you enjoy it! Thanks for reading. <3

"But if their brains--"
"It's not awful. I guess?"
"I mean, I probably shouldn't tell you too much about where I come from," he told me when I started asking, looking sheepish. "Couple of people have said I could break the universe if I do. They were probably only teasing, but I don't wanna take the chance."
"Hey..." Rhodes' hand fell onto his shoulder and gave a tight squeeze. "Breathe. I didn't mean to... hell. I think you're overthinking this is all. I won't say anything more about it though, if you don't want me to."
He mourned what could have been as he headed towards the room Harley and Peter had commandeered on their floor. He could hear music - loud, annoying, slightly awkward music - blaring as soon as he got close. Underoos was still trying to sell the stuff he listened to, but Tony knew Harley wasn't buying. His curly haired human kid was firmly on the side of AC/DC, Black Sabbath, and other classic and timeless bands. At least he was humoring his brother now instead of throwing his phone into the trash.
“Dad’s being mean to me.”
"And that's

show her his initial floor plans. "That would have been over the top. But this... I think this could be good for all of you. Now that you aren't at each other's throats, anyway."
Maverick's social media presence has been a delight for liberal political activists everywhere. He's been especially vocal when it comes to the immigration debate and is quick to call out intolerance on the part of politicians whenever he sees it. "His twitter has more followers than Iron Man's," Tony reported proudly when I mentioned all this. Steve just blushed again.
