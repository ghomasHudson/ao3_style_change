He knows he did. It's just when he saw Steve talking with Natasha and Barnes, well he might have gotten a little mad at the fact that he's said more to those two than he has to him even when they got here. Even before they got here, he had said that they would do this together, and well it didn't really
"He went t-to the R-Raft? Without m-me?" If Tony had just told him where he was going or, rather had told him more than just the simple fact that he and T'Challa made a plan, then he for sure would have gone to the Raft with Tony. If he had gone, he'd have someone watching his back- and he means in the literary sense of watching his back and not his ass- and he'd be back at the facility already.
Because yes, alcohol makes everything better, right? Of course, he knows it wouldn't make anything better, he would simply get too drunk and try to avoid the situation, making a deeper hole in their friendship, and even worse, Steve might not even want to talk to him anymore. He swallowed the lump in his throat and rubbed his eyes, the insatiable itch to feel amber liquid slithering down his throat was growing at an immense level, but he wasn't going to succumb to one of his demons this time, he needed to be stronger. What he really needed to do was to apologize, but he was too emotionally introverted to actually get up from his chair and go perform the task.
Even if Tony betrayed him by calling him under false presumptions; which most would say he probably deserved since he, in a
"Well, with that smile that says 'I just had a really great orgasm,' I have an idea." He giggled and rose from his knees, his body coming close to Steve's, pushing him back slightly so that he was resting on his back. Their lips came into contact with each other, Steve playfully biting Tony's bottom lip, eliciting moans and giggles from him. "I'd say we have to talk about your language, but it seems the super-soldier refractory period is kicking in." He said, grinding his front against Steves, making him moan.
It was just like Peggy all over again; speaking to her on the line, only this time it was Tony. He loved Peggy, and now he loves Tony. He gave up his life so Peggy and the rest of New York could have theirs, and now he loses his life, the one Tony fought so hard for. He never got to finish his sentence back then, when he and Peggy planned that date- the one he never got to attend. And this time, well, it was just the same as last time.
His hand holds the doorknob that if he twists and pushes on the door, it will lead him to the outside world. But he stops for a second and listens to the set of boots that thud against the tiles, stopping just a few feet behind him.
"Then we'll do that together, too." Steve's smile widened, and he leaned forward to peck Tony's lips once more. "I love you," he said once he pulled back.
"Steve, I..." He stared, collecting his words before speaking again. "I never hated you. Sure we said some crap when we first met that we both regret, but if I truly hated you, I wouldn't have invited you into the tower, and I sure as hell wouldn't have let you into my lab." The soldier nodded, realizing what Tony was saying was true. "I know I can be a pain in the ass," Steve chuckled, "but don't think you can't at least talk to me."
"Don't feel like watching." He replied, turning his attention back to the ceiling. There was this weird hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach, the sort of feeling you get when you knew you had something, but felt like something was missing behind it. He felt his jaw clench, his hands forming into fists, a deep sigh in anger exhaled through his nose. Just what was this feeling that left a bitter taste in his mouth, spoiled his attitude, and turned it rotten. Was it the feeling of loneliness again? No, that can't be right. Natasha is sitting right next to him, although they may not be taking, at least he has company, right? Ugh, it was too confusing for him to figure out, and the more he thought about it, the angrier he got.
God, he felt like complete and utter shit for how he reacted. Why did he react that way? Why did he let his anger for his father make him hurt someone who only wanted to know more about him? All those people who called him an asshole, he wouldn't put it past them, he actually agreed with them, considering his actions in the past and just a few minutes ago. The guilt was eating away at him, but he made no move to try and make amends with the blonde, instead, he just sat here in his lab, avoiding the situation, and craving an alcoholic drink right about now.
Throughout the three weeks, they've gotten closer and closer to each other. The kisses were more intimate, as well as the touching, they communicated to each other their issues with one another, meaning that whenever they weren't feeling 100% themselves, they would talk about it and help each other out. Tony got to see Steve smile way more often, and it was like the guy was never lonely and depressed anymore. Overall, Tony would say the time they've spent together was well deserved, and now he had a date tonight. Oh, right, he had a date to prepare for, he should probably get off his ass and go do that.
"Alright, don't overdo it. You leave in ten minutes, please return safely." Fury turned his back on them, leaving the group of superheroes to prepare to save their beloved friend, Captain, and lover.
"Good." And he can just imagine that beautiful, genuine smile that Tony wore whenever he was happy, plastered on his face right now. "I'm going to catch up with you, but needless to say I'm going to have to fix the compound sometime." He laughed; a real, genuine laugh as the genius sighed heavily on the other side of the comm line. "So much work ahead of me."
"What did you do?" He asked. It wasn't laced with venom, it wasn't an angry statement, it was a genuine question, but it still left this sick twisted knot in his stomach, like he just knew what she was going to tell him. He watched her hesitate, refusing to meet his eyes as she looked anywhere except at him.
"What...? What are you sorry for, you didn't do anything wrong?" Tony said, confused. What exactly is Steve apologizing for? As far as Tony is concerned, Steve hasn't done anything wrong. The guy just came back from being held captive, and he's already apologizing as if his mere presence has hurt him.
He smiled as he remembered everything he drew; realistically the smile was also because of the fond memories each drawing held. The flowers were drawn from the time Tony took him around New York, as a way to break him into the new world. He remembered them passing by a flower shop, the different colors and hues, shapes, sizes, even the different petals caught Steve's attention, and Tony was happy enough to let the soldier bask in each flower's beauty. The Avengers Tower, formerly known as Stark Tower at the time, was drawn way before Steve became an Avenger and knew Tony. It was a small cafe he had heard about that resided in Manhattan, so he decided to check it out. There he saw the big building and sketched it, looking up and realizing how much it loomed over the city, a true work of art nonetheless. The Avengers compound he drew was when he and Tony decided to take a lazy day while everybody else was out- everybody except for Banner- but the scientist mostly stayed in his own room, or Tony's lab. And who could forget the Shawarma shop? It was the most mundane thing they could do together as a team; sitting around each other and enjoying a delicious delicacy, talking amongst each other. It was heartwarming.
"That's a good boy. You know I care about you right, that's why I'm doing this so you'll be better. You don't think I'm doing this because I hate you, right?" His voice was so soft and sweet, it was so gentle the way he spoke as he cared about me. It made me nod my head in response, believing him. He smiled and kissed my cheek again, his lips just as soft as I remember them. "You're always so sweet, so kind and gentle. I guess you deserve a little love and affection, right?"
Steve continued to apologize, and Tony continued to assure him that it was ok, that he's here for him, and that he's sorry for leaving him this vulnerable. They held each other; Steve staining Tony's shirt with his tears, and Tony placing soft kisses on Steve's face and whispering sweet words into his ear to calm him down.
He didn't know when it happened, but his hands found themselves cupping the side of Steve's face, his thumbs brushing over his cheeks. The soldier grabbed his wrists, his lips forming a small smile before kissing the palm of Tony's right hand. Tony leaned in and closed the distance, surprising Steve when their lips connected, but he kissed back, moving his hands to the geniuses hips, pulling him in so he was between his legs. Tony pulled back slowly, never taking his eyes off of those adorable blue ones staring back at him.
"No, Steve," he interrupted, "if I had just woken you up and taken you to S.H.I.E.L.D. with me, you wouldn't have gotten attacked. Maybe those things wouldn't have come here, and you wouldn't have been put in danger. If I had just gone on that mission with you, you would've been safe. It's all my fault."
There were many things Tony has heard in his lifetime, most of them regarding how much of a pain in the ass he could be, or things about him being a billionaire and a playboy, but never in his life would he ever hear, no
"I cannot answer that for you. Only you can decide whether you made the right choice or not. If I may ask, do you feel like you did, sir?" This really was the question that needed to be answered. Did he make the right choice? He could argue that he didn't, that this was a bad idea, that this was going to end just like the whole Pepper situation. Although, this wasn't like Pepper. He and Steve both lived dangerous lives, but they could look out for each other when things got bad. With Steve's loyalty, Tony knew that if anything bad happened to him, Steve would scourge the ends of the earth to make sure he was safe. It was easier to look out for someone who was also a superhero, but what if his insecurities got the best of him? Steve deserved better than someone like him, the man deserved someone
He ran into Bruce along the way, the shy Doctor saying his greetings to the super-soldier, both exchanging small conversation before it turned into awkward silence. They parted ways, Steve
"Well, not everybody has that view anymore, there are some assholes who still feel disgusted by the sight of same-sex couples, but people are more accepting of it. How do you feel about it?"
"Hey," Tony said, softly, but with a small hint of joy in his voice. It only made him smile more, his twinkling with a shimmer of happiness in it, directed towards the brunette.
"JARVIS!" Tony yelled, watching as screens flickered in his vision, indicating the suit's damage and energy level, "put power into the remaining thrusters!"
He didn't dare move, in fear if he did the heart monitor would stop beeping again. He wanted to get something to eat from the cafeteria, but as soon as he took those first few steps the machine emitted an eerie single note beep continuously. He panicked and started screaming for help, alerting every doctor who passed by the hall to his room. After that, he stayed glued to his seat, next to the bed that held his genius. Everybody tried to tell him he needed sleep, that he needed to eat and drink, but he refused all of their requests. They soon started to bring him food and water, but he didn't touch it right away. He let the necessities sit there, his blue eyes unable to look at anything other than the sleeping form on the brunette.
Yes, Tony Stark, is deeply in love with Steve Rogers. The man out of time, the guy who spent 70 years encased in ice, lost everything close to him, the man who struggled to work modern technology and the guy who was the only one capable of dealing with Tony's shit. That was who Steve Rogers was to Tony. He was more than the iconic superhero Captain America, who everybody adored and looked up to. As a kid, Tony was also someone who looked up to Captain America, he practically was his entire childhood. His father always told him about the tale of Captain America, and Tony ate those stories up as a kid that he, too, ended up becoming a fan of the great man. However, Captain America and Steve Rogers are two different people, and Tony always realized that. Whereas a kid he never got to know the man behind the mask, but as an adult, that's what Tony got the chance to do. He got to learn all about Steve Rogers, and it's safe to say that he's so happy he got the chance to learn more about the guy because he absolutely loves everything about him.
"I appreciate that, and that sounds pretty funny actually. I can see the local headlines: 'Captain America saves young genius from the clutches of bullies.' Makes for something interesting to read." The two of them shared a laugh, a small moment between the two of them that Tony really enjoyed. He would give anything to see this side of Steve more often. This happy, sweet, adorable side of Steve over the gloomy and depressed one. He would do anything to make him happy.
He stepped away from the screen, eyes darting around his workshop for anything to distract him from what was happening just a few yards away from his location. But there was nothing in his lab for him to do, and that was actually a first. He had no more gear- or rather had no gear to upgrade or tamper with since all his teammates were gone, and even if Rhodey visited from time to time, he was still out of commission due to him being unable to properly walk. He actually hasn't seen Rhodey in a while; and maybe it's for the best that his best friend hasn't been around because, well, he isn't exactly the most emotionally stable person right now, not to mention that he also is harboring a fugitive.
let what happened to me control my love for you." He could see a small fire of determination come to life in Steve's eyes as he spoke. "I want you to touch me, I want you to hold my hand, I want you to run your hand up and down my thigh and make me shiver, I want you to kiss my neck and whisper sweet things in my ear, I want all of that Tony. I know it sounds crazy, and I'm traumatized, but all I see is you. All I see is
He watched as Obadiah stood menacingly over him while he was paralyzed, bleeding from his ears, skin pale and littered with blue veins that were visible on his neck, stopping just on his cheek within proximity to his eyes. He remembers the feelings of helplessness and betrayal, as well as the feeling of creeping death as Obadiah ripped the Arc Reactor out of his chest. He felt a pang of pain from his own chest as if the action from this memory was being reciprocated and felt from his own body. The feeling grew stronger, and he grits his teeth. He clawed at his chest, nails digging into his own skin, tearing his skin as he tried to make the pain go away, tried to find any means to make the pain cease. He lifted his shirt, and he felt like he couldn't breathe.
He rolled his eyes at the response and started walking over towards the once again giggling blonde. As he walked over, it gave him the time to properly look over the super-soldier. He seemed more cheerful than how he was yesterday, he seemed relaxed, less stiff, and just plain out happy. He doesn't ever recall seeing Steve this happy, not even when he first decided to stay in the tower and saw his room. Well, in all fairness to Steve, he might have been happy when he saw how plain his room was, nothing too fancy, everything was modernized and simple; no TV in his room, no remotes, just a simple room equipped with a closest, dresser, a bed, and whatever S.H.I.E.L.D. had kept after recovering him from the ice. Maybe it was too plain. Nah, Steve liked plain.
"I say, if you want to make Steve happy Tony, then just let yourself be happy. That's the first step. You've already kissed, so maybe do something he likes to show him you're serious about this. Just don't hurt him again, because Bruce and the others won't be the only ones on your ass about hurting Steve." He couldn't help but chuckle at Pepper's words. Sweet, loveable Virginia Pepper Potts, always the one to make sure he got his shit together.
"Right, not the point." The blonde let out a huff of irritation and rolled his eyes, waiting for the genius to get to the point. "So, I was tinkering in my lab, upgrading everybody's shit, and after today I was thinking, 'hey, Capsicle doesn't seem to be happy. Wonder why?' So I thought you'd wanna hang out tomorrow?"
"That's a r-risk I'm willing t-to take." T'Challa smiled at him for a brief moment, telling him to meet him outside in a few minutes just shortly after before walking away from him. It gave him some time to think to himself, mainly about what he was going to do after he got Tony back.
When he opened his eyes again, the cave was gone, replaced by fancy furniture, glass windows next to a cliffside view of the ocean, a liquor cabinet harboring every bottle of whiskey, scotch, tequila, just about every alcoholic bottle you could name sitting in the cabinet behind the glass door, a fireplace, wooden tiled flooring, makeshift kitchen a few feet away from the liquor cabinet and a spiral staircase that lead to the upper part of the building. He was back home, in his mansion, late in the middle of the night. He remembers what happens next.
The genius placed a kiss onto the soldier's lips, surprising Steve, but he kissed back regardless, his hand moving behind Tony's head to deepen the kiss. When they pulled back, Tony whispered, "I'm gonna make you feel so good. Let's make your first time special, baby." It sent shivers down Steve's spine when Tony's breath hit his ear, causing his erection to twitch in response. The genius smiled and chuckled softly, moving back down to give Steve's cock attention once more.
"Oh, right my mistake. I seem to have forgotten in my midst of searching for Hydra. Have a good day."
"Of course I do. Now, how about a kiss before I go. Nat's not gonna wait for long." Tony rolled his eyes, chuckling to himself a bit. He retracted his head from the soldier's chest, standing on the tips of his toes to place a small but sweet kiss on Steve's lips. When they pulled back, Tony could still feel the lingering touch of Steve's lips against him, causing him to smile.
"Language." A familiar voice said. He turned around, brown eyes locking on to blue ones that belonged to Steve, a faint smile on his face, and the fresh mop of blonde hair swept in different directions, the only indication that he might have either just woken up, or he's been awake for a while.
"She was," he smiled, "I loved my mom very much. My dad, on the other hand, I didn't really know much about him, or rather I chose not to remember much about him. You see, my mom usually had nothing but good graces to say about my father, saying he died in the war protecting me and my mom, but later down the line, you come to question why everyone is asking if you were ok. I was confused at first until I had to find out that my dad was abusive to both me and my mom." He looked at Tony with a sad smile, the genius sitting there with a hard-to-read expression on his face, a mix of sadness and confusion Steve would conclude. "I was a child at the time, so it's pretty hard to remember much as a child, but when you grow up as a teen and learn your dad was an alcoholic who hit you and his wife, you tend to wonder what the world has come to. But, nothing much can be done about that." He shrugged and dug into his food once again, letting the silence fester between them.
The last thing he wanted to do, as he walked towards his destination T'Challa mentioned, was that he wanted to tell Tony he loved him. While it is a simple thing realistically, it has so much meaning to not only himself but the world's hold the deepest meaning that not many people realize.
He was able to get him onto the bed softly, on his side, pulling the blanket back so he could get Steve's legs onto the bed, before pulling the blanket over him up to his shoulder. It actually occurred to him that Steve didn't even bother to
During the end period of the final week, they were permitted to return to the compound; but not only just the three of them but all the other rogue Avengers as well. And what's also important that happened during the final week, is that Steve has come to accept himself.
Maybe this is why he and Pepper never worked out, really. It wasn't only the fact that his life was dangerous; more dangerous than he probably would admit to himself, considering most people would consider him suicidal since he A) kept the fact he was dying of palladium poisoning from everyone and B) flew a nuclear warhead into an interdimensional portal, ignoring the fact that he may never return and possibly die. Although he did technically die, in a sense. The Arc Reactor flickered as he felt himself slowly being pulled down by gravity towards the portal. As his eyes closed, the reactor stopped working, and he swore he felt the painful slither of Shrapnel coursing its way through his heart trying to kill him. But it also came down to the fact he was an emotional introvert. It was hard for him to express what he felt, and truthfully Pepper, not just Pepper, but even Steve, deserved better than to deal with him.
"I understand you're frustrated, believe me, I am too, but save the punching for later and just get through this first," Natasha whispered to him. He sighed heavily and nodded his head, her hands leaving his arms shortly after. He clicked his teeth with his tongue, glaring at this disgusting thing across from him.
"Yes, boss." The female AI replied. He patiently waited, but to himself, he didn't know whether he was waiting minutes or hours. It all just felt too long, and he feared that if he waited any longer, Steve would be dead- if he wasn't already, that is. "His heartbeat is weak. He's lost a lot of blood and is continuing to lose more as we speak. If he doesn't get medical attention within the next few hours, he'll die."
" Ross sneered. He remained silent, because truthfully what was there to say? Words had no meaning here, they wouldn't listen, nobody here cared really. He wouldn't beg, nor plead for his life, it was already gone. He wouldn't whimper and cry, because he's accepted death at this point. Granted, he accepted death first when he sacrificed himself to save millions, but at this point hope is just a word that emerged from its cocoon, grew beautiful, colorful wings, and flew away like a butterfly, hoping to come into contact with a flower, or in this case a person, who it could spread its hope to.
"Thank you." He whispered, swallowing the lump in his throat as he tried talking again. "Thank you, for saving him. It means the world to me."
"Hey... Stark." He mentally kicked himself for his voice sounding so far, but can you really blame him? He was caught off guard and seen in one of the most intimate ways that should be saved for someone you're willing to spend the rest of your life with. Not by the owner of the tower they're letting you stay in. It made his blush deepen, and right now he wishes he thought more about walking out of the bathroom completely naked.
"With all due respect, Fury, the genius isn't wrong. He sorta just appears whenever he wants," Natasha shrugged, "it's sort of like an instinct for him. Sometimes he talks about this dude named Heimdall telling him that we're in danger and he just shows up."
"Morning." He said softly. His smile never faltered even as Tony sat next to him; it's as if yesterday's talk seemed to have calmed down the nervous tics and uncomfortable feelings festered within himself. He elevated his feet onto the armrest of the couch, his back rested against what little of the couch was left as his head lay gently in Tony's lap, his face looking up at him. The genius ran his fingers through Steve's blonde locks once more, a content sigh escaping the soldier's lips. "I missed you."
like they were doing this together. It's just the moment he saw him with Barnes, he had flashbacks of Siberia, and he thought that Steve would leave him again.
"I swear to God, these things are going to pay for what they did to him. He didn't deserve this." Steve really didn't deserve this. Despite what Bruce has told him, Tony still thinks that he is the one who deserves to be where Steve is. Steve has always been a kind-hearted soul who would never turn his back from anyone. The guy who would gladly risk his life for someone else, the guy who Tony would do anything for to see him happy, didn't deserve to be reduced to this.
"I love you so much, honey. I want you to make love to me, please?" He was at a loss for words, something unusual for the brunette. What could he possibly say at this moment, there was just space where a sentence should be forming inside of his head.
"He's awake right now, but as a fair warning, he might be out of it until the morphine wears off. Other than that, once he's fully regained his senses he's free to go." He smiled and thanked the doctor, who nodded in return and walked away shortly after. He let out a small breath of air, placing his hand on one of the wooden doors and gently pushing it open.
"When you were unconscious for two hours. He appeared distressed and we told him the situation, so now he's with Fury." He nodded his head slowly and sighed. He watched as the clock ticked ever so slowly, taunting him as it meant time he was losing in trying to save Steve.
"Oh baby," the genius cooed in his ear, "don't worry, it'll be all over soon." Steve's scared blue eyes kept his focus on Tony who slowly stood up. The pain coursed through his body, the serum doing its best to work as fast as it could, but as he stared, he saw the gun in Tony's hand coming for his head, making contact and knocking him on the floor. Dark spots danced around his vision, his hair damp with what he assumed to be his own blood, his eyelids heavy. As he blacked out, he saw the genius come closer to him, a hand gently caressing his cheek again, and the feeling of his body being picked up.
"I see you can at least get out of bed," came the monotonous reply, followed by a judgemental gaze up and down his body, "as for being able to stand on your own two feet, not so much."
Even after the Quinjet made it back to Wakanda he still did not put him down. He continued to carry him bridal style up until they reached the facility. T'Challa welcomed them back and was concerned about each and everyone one of them. For Tony, it was hard for him to tell T'Challa that Ross broke his fingers, because not only did he remember the sound of his bones breaking, as well as the immense pain he suffered through and the acidic burn of bile in his throat, but more so because he couldn't imagine himself not inventing. He didn't want to admit that he might not be able to fix or upgrade the team's suits, but that wasn't as important as the thought of not being able to hold Steve's hand.
Tony was going to give him up to Ross, and this time the Secretary was going to kill him. No, no he wouldn't be betrayed again. He had to do something, he had to get out of here. He wasn't going back and suffer at the hands of all the shit Ross had done to him back at the Raft. But he thought that maybe, for a second, he could trust Tony with his life.
Steve's face was tainted with blood; trickling down from his nostrils, the skin on the bridge of his nose torn and cracked, loose skin hanging off by a few inches, a deep gash on his forehead, and he could faintly see glass shards embedded in his skin. He saw the small pool of blood around his hair, staining his blonde locks the shade of crimson. He trembled as he reached out to touch the soldier, wanting to feel for any sign of life in him, but he was too shocked to will his hands steady as he just continued to look at him.
"Don't worry," she said softly, "I'll make sure to take the pain away." The way she said those words sent a shiver down my spine.
"If Tony and I were dating... There wouldn't be a problem with that, right?" There was a look behind Steve's eyes as he spoke, and Tony understood that look clearly. However, seeing it on Steve, who was usually cool about a lot of things related to the team, unnerved Tony. It was a look of fear stitched into those big blue eyes of his, and of course, he would have some sort of fear, he always would put the team first, and Tony knew that. He was also ok with that, but he didn't want Steve to think that their possible relationship would affect the team. Hell, if anybody had a problem with Steve having an attraction for a guy, not just an attraction for Tony, he would defend the big guy's honor until his very last breath.
"I'd like that." And so he stood up, walking out the door first just like last time. Unlike the last time, where Tony was more distant with him, more secluded, and wanting nothing more than to be as far away from him as possible, he was more relaxed. The distance he put was less noticeable, but there was still some space left between them, and truthfully, Steve is willing to accept this because at least Tony is a bit more comfortable around him. It's a small win in his books.
"You are correct, my oh so sexy soldier." He handed Steve his burger after he finished unwrapping his, taking a large bite out of it. The way the meat was so tender and juicy, the cheese perfectly melted and the bacon so crispy, the way his nose started to run due to the sauce being the perfect amount of spicy that he liked, it was pure heaven in his mouth. And the best part, there were no pickles. "You got me my regular order from my favorite burger place. God, you are too good to me."
Steve sighed and nodded his head, popping the cap of the lube bottle and squeezing some in his hand. He coated himself first, shivering as the cold liquid made contact with his dick before he spread Tony's legs apart. He placed one finger against his entrance, slowly slipping his index finger in, causing Tony to shiver and moan softly, biting his lip shortly after. His finger moved back and forth inside of the brunette, rubbing against his walls and causing the genius's cock to twitch in response. He added a second finger, eliciting a louder moan from his partner, his insides being stretched just a little bit more. A third finger was added, and by this point Tony's knuckles were white, his hands holding the sheets in a vice-like grip. The pleasure from his fingers alone made the genius start to pre-cum, but god he couldn't wait to feel every inch of Steve inside of him. He whimpered at the sudden loss of his fingers, but he could feel Steve start to line himself with his entrance.
"It appears that the glass has done more damage than we thought, and the severity of his thoracic cavity has extended as well." She stood next to him, opening the file she had containing his injuries. She pointed at the image of his sternum first, focusing on his neck. "During the operation, there were some difficulties; as you know the serum makes it sort of impossible for the morphine to keep him under since his metabolism burns it rather quickly, so, during the twelve-hour period, there were vast complications that added to his existing injury. His larynx was slightly damaged during the operation, and I apologize for that."
His body had a mind of its own and his feet carried him out of the room, his own tears slithering down his cheeks, dripping off his chin and onto the floor. He felt the wave of nausea hit him again, stronger this time. He leaned his body against the wall, keeping himself upright as best as he could. This was some sick twisted game he was in, and he wanted out. What did those assholes do to his precious soldier; the man who he wanted to just hold him in his arms and tell him that it was going to be ok, the man he wanted to whisper sweet nothings in his ear and kiss the tears away. But he couldn't go near him without drawing some painful memories, and it wasn't fair to Steve, and it wasn't fair to Tony. He wanted to do something, anything really, to make the situation better, but what could he possibly do? If he tried to go anywhere near Steve he was a danger to him, and he didn't know what he went through. Before he knew it, he was hunched over a garbage can, emptying the contents of his stomach into it. He felt a hand on his back, soothing circles being rubbed into it trying to comfort him. He spits into the trash bin and looked back, noticing the chestnut brown hair of the girl he met when they found Steve.
"Tony," the soldier's blush deepened at the geniuses' words, causing the brunette to chuckle lightly, "maybe some other time, right now I just wanna fall asleep with you."
"B-Baby," he whispered, making Tony look at him through his tear-filled eyes. "What did he d-do?" With an intense shudder of breath, the genius slowly removed his hands from under his armpits, and not only was he filled with rage at the sight he saw, but he was a little nauseous as well.
Steve on the other hand was freaking out, hyperventilating in his seat. He was scared that Tony was actually going to go through with what he said to him yesterday.
is the one who's okay. He could care less about himself at the moment because the genius was the one who put himself on the front lines, willing to risk it all to help him. And really, how could the word "okay" describe all the emotions he was feeling. "Steve?"
The air turns chilly, invisible wisps of air coiling around his body, tickling every inch of his skin. He shivers, body trembling as sweat continues to form, tiny whimpers turning into cries of agony, the air in the room feels thicker the more his eyes are closed. He can't breathe for a fraction of a second, oxygen foreign to him as he lays there gasping, clawing at an invisible force, wanting to be saved. His eyes snap open, and he notices that he's not the only one in the room. Scared, quivering blue eyes took a gander into concerned brown eyes, a hand on his shoulder the only form of skin-to-skin contact that is soothing to him. He feels like he can breathe again, but he feels paralyzed as he lays there.
"I think it's not fair that you're still fully clothed. Let me do something about that." Tony was flipped on his back, his jacket being the first to come off quickly before his tie and shirt followed shortly. Inexperienced hands fumbled with his belt before he soon felt it followed by his boxers sliding down his legs, leaving him naked for the soldier to see.
Everything was quiet for the most part, all except for something hitting the floor. It hit the ground with a loud thud and sat there lifeless. Nobody dared to make a sound, and nobody dared to move. Everything was silent, and it was that eerie silence that ran goosebumps up your skin and made you shudder.
"They brought me down to a secret room, and I... I saw him there. I watched him struggle, I listened to him plead for me to help him, and I made it worse." A small gasp escaped past her lips as the tears started to flow, the back of her hand moving to wipe them away. "They made me manipulate his mind, bringing his worst fears to life right in front of them. I listened to him scream, I watched as they handed him the scalpel, and he..." He pulled her into him, his arms wrapping around her as she sobbed into his chest. He too had tears in his eyes, but he quietly shushed her, placing soft kisses on the top of her head. "I'm sorry... They used me to hurt him and get back at you. I only found out the truth after they tried to leave him to die. I just had to rescue him before it was too late."
"He lives in a magical place called 'Asgard.' You really think they know what phones are? For God sakes Fury, the dude fights with a magic hammer." Tony grumbled, earning him an elbow from Natasha.
"Let him in, J." He said. The door opened and he watched with an intense stare at how nervous Steve really was. His eyes never met Tony or Wanda's, his feet wobbled with each step, his hands never left their place on his shirt, and if Tony paid more attention to detail, he could see how red Steve's eyes were, and how disheveled his hair was. Just what happened to him?
"No, I didn't mean it," he reassured, uncrossing his arms and letting them fall to his sides, "I say a lot of mean things when I'm angry, and irrational things as well. Usually one of my defense mechanisms kicks in, but sometimes... There are moments where all I see is red and stupid shit comes out of my mouth instead. I'm sorry if I hurt you, this is why I don't think I deserve you, really."
Tony to get better, he can't handle the pain of not having him here. He was the only one, despite them having a rough start at the beginning, as well as that one night they argued, who made Steve feel like he was so much more than just a superhero persona. Tony made him feel like an actual person, and he wanted to tell the genius how much he truly meant to him.
A small giggle found its way out of the super soldier's mouth, his lips forming into a small line shortly after due to Tony glaring at him, but the corners of his mouth were still curved upwards into a smile. "I don't remember programming you with so much sass, mister."
So, instead of showing up to Steve's therapy session, he hid away in Shuri's lab, laughing and talking story, keeping his mind busy with all her inventions, and trying to create his own invention with her tools that maybe could help Steve with his blindness and his speech impediment.
"Good morning, Captain Rogers." Jarvis's voice broke through the never-ending darkness, making him jump.
"Well you totally can, but the question is do you want to be my boyfriend?" The soldier's smile grew in size, he leaned forward and captured Tony's lips before pulling back.
"I'm glad to be back. Certainly beats running around and night chasing a ghost and sitting around for hours. Right now I just want a hot shower and to relax."
"Sir, the timestamp for that footage is recent. It's been taken in real-time, not within the last month or weeks."
Leave it to Bruce to make it hard for him to not spill the beans, hell, it was even harder for him to not spill the beans with Pepper here. Normally he would be able to just give off a small lie to his science bro and he would believe him, no more questions would be asked and they could get on with their day. With Pepper here, there was no way he would be able to lie his way out of this because she knew him on a deeply personal level. She knew everything about him and could easily see right through his lies if he ever tried to tell them. Hell, she even knew when he was trying to avoid a topic; just like how he was trying to avoid this topic and she figured that out instantly. She also knew when he would try to deflect, and all his other defense mechanisms. So regardless, he was fucked no matter what.
"Why haven't you told me?" He took notice of the way his eyebrows scrunched in confusion, a small crease forming between them, and the way his eyes portrayed the emotion he was feeling perfectly. That was something he always liked about Steve, his heart was on his sleeve, and he could always tell how the man was feeling, either by him showing it or by the way his eyes held everything.
"Well, who doesn't like to let their victims suffer? It's how we operate." A dark chuckle filled the room, sending a wave of pure terror down Tony's spine, making him shiver violently. "You see, it's not really about you, Stark. It was about getting rid of potential threats to the plans we have."
"I can't wait to get back to New York and go on a date with you. Can't wait to tell everybody I'm going on a date with Captain America, actually!" He saw the unamused expression that crossed Steve's face, and he simply just chuckled and shrugged it off. "I'm only kidding. About the whole telling everybody, not the... I really wanna go out with you. Can we still do that?"
Tony hesitantly snuck a small glance at him, and it was just for a fraction of a moment, time ceased to stop as Steve got a glimpse at Tony's eyes. He could see the fear nestled into those brown irises of his, and it caused his heart to lurch once more. Tony was scared of him; and why would he not be? He knows that putting his shield in the chest of Tony's suit was about as low as he could go, especially after Tony confided in him about Obadiah and what he did to him, and he vowed to never be like that man. And yet, he went back on his promise and did exactly what he did, only worse.
"Just checking up on how my favorite person is doing." He replies, cheekily. Once he gets within proximity of the genius, he doesn't hesitate to attach his soft lips to the genius's own calloused ones, reveling in the way his lips move perfectly with his own. It was moments like this that both heroes looked forward to; whether it was after a hard day of fighting crime, or simply because they missed each other and wanted some alone time away from everyone else, moments where they got to kiss, hug, or cuddle one another were times they looked forward to.
They talk for a few hours, laughing and telling jokes to one another, and then just shortly after it changes to a more serious tone. He soon finds himself talking about what happened back at the Avengers compound when T'Challa asks, retelling every little detail he dares not to leave out. He tells him about how he got Steve to come back to New York, how he was the one who helped him escape when he saw that Ross was going to kill him, explained how he kept him at the Compound and fed him, and even about all the tension they had. Eventually, retells the entire story leading up to where he and Steve are now. And while it's a lot to take in, T'Challa simply just nods his head in response and says he's been doing some research on the whole Ross situation.
"I know you do, but I'm sorry." Another kiss was placed on Tony's forehead, the soldier's hand running up and down his back, calming his rampant bundle of nerves seated deep within him. "However," he said with a smirk on his face, "knowing you, you'd find a way to help, and I trust you to figure that out."
"Oh great, what is he gonna do? Scold me and tell me I should go back and apologize to those two assholes?" He scoffed and crossed his arms, making his way over to the couch he had in his lab, planting himself firmly down onto the furniture as the door to his lab opened.
"Do you see any way to get inside? Like any sort of small opening at the top or sides of this thing?"
"Of course, Capsicle," he chuckled as he watched the blonde roll his eyes, "but I will have you know I am a stubborn asshole. And I'm not good with this kind of stuff and generally speaking I was going to lock myself in the lab and drink myself until I passed out unconscious and-"
"I would suggest that there is a mole, but that seems highly unlikely. After we concluded where and what the weapons are, we noticed that they were spruced up as if it was alien tech, something along the lines of the Chitauri. What was even weirder, is that after we captured them, they just disappeared like they were never there."
"What mission?" Fury questioned. Tony clicked his teeth with his tongue, his foot tapping against the floor of Fury's office, his anger spiking to dangerous levels.
"I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry, Steve. I've been an asshole for the past five days and I... I thought I was helping and doing something right by staying in the lab and I... I'm just so
"I want to just die." He felt his heart metaphorically break at his words, he felt the prickling sensation of unshed tears start to form as he continued to stare. He watched as Steve shrugged his shoulders and placed his head against the wall again, facing Tony's direction, but not looking him in the eyes.
He remembers it so vividly; the feel of the cold barrel against his skull, and how steady his finger was as he looked at himself in the mirror, willing to put an end to his suffering. But he didn't do it. Why? Because he still kept going, kept believing that one day the genius would call him and that everything would be right. He kept having the faith in his heart, swirled in with love that created this beautiful portrait of love and anguish; hues of pink and orange, with a dash of black and red, and it was a complete mess, but to him it was beautiful.
Maybe he thought Tony wasn't ever going to turn this thing off, and truthfully he's actually not too sure if he can handle this. As much as he could endure the pain now that the cuffs stripping away his powers were off, the pain would soon become annoyingly unbearable and he would go crazy. He already wasn't sure what Tony had in plan for him-whether the genius was going to feed him or give him water, or whether he was going to resort to making him suffer much as he did back at the Raft. Either way, he doubts the pain from the collar would make him crack because in actuality the pain from knowing it was coming from someone he loved was what made it worse.
When he finds T'Challa, they once again go over the plan. You see the plan was for Tony to infiltrate the Raft and gather footage from when Steve was put into the floating prisoner, as well as any files he can gather. The assumption is based on appealing towards those who see the Avengers as heroes rather than vigilantes- because yes while they may cause damage when they try to help, it's honestly to be expected. With so much chaos going around their main priority is to protect not only the Earth but its people. If buildings and structures just so happen to get damaged, not much can be done. Regardless, they're hoping to appeal to the better half of people who still look up to them, as well as going on the assumption that maybe Ross could have recently swapped over to being secretly Hydra, and is using his status as secretary to go undercover.
"Oh, yea that's pretty normal here. Why do you ask? That doesn't... Make you uncomfortable, does it?" He asked his question carefully, in fear that he would find out that the guy raised in the 1940s, where their views on homosexuality were much more severe than today's modern views, had carried over with him and he would find it disturbing. As he looked upwards at his companion, he didn't find a disgusted face, instead, he found one full of confusion, his left eyebrow raised.
"No, no, it's... It's fine, I appreciate you caring about me and taking this slow. It's just..." He trailed off and sighed, taking his hands away from his face and looking side to side, trying to hear or spot any disturbance in the area. "Fuck it." He muttered.
Take for example a car, given to you by your parents. Was it free? Of course, it was free for you, because you didn't have to pay a single penny for it. For your parents, they had to pay so much for it. So are things truly given for free without consequence, because while it may not be a consequence for you, it could be for someone else.
"Tony," he heard Steve call his name, breaking him out of his thoughts so he could look into the soldier's eyes as he spoke, "I know how much you love me. You've shown me, and even expressed how much you love me, but I know you're trying to sacrifice things for my happiness. And I don't want that. Just look at how close we're sitting right now." He averted his eyes to look at their positions. He noticed how close they were, how close
to the genius for what he did. So, if kissing a picture in his sketchbook that holds so much sentimental value is the only way he's ever going to kiss the man he so desperately still loved and wanted, then what was so weird or wrong about that?
"Ah yes, your poor, precious, boy toy. How could we forget, his screams of pain are still engraved in my mind. What I wouldn't give to hear them again." He tried getting up again to punch the creature in its face once more, but Natasha's firm grip held him in place.
"I'm going to make this very clear," Tony spoke dangerously slow, kicking the intensity of the collar up a few notches, making Steve curl his fingers inwards, forming a fist as he kept eye contact with Tony, "you should be lucky that you're here, and not still in the raft where Ross can do whatever the fuck he wants to you, but don't think for even a second that I won't do the same to you. I am
"Show me all of 'em." Holograms appeared within his vision, and his focus was given to all of them. He enjoyed watching how Steve used to be so clueless on how to work today's modern technology, that a rather cute pout would form on his face. He appreciated how Steve always took the effort to be by Tony's side and make sure he was in tip-top shape, always putting his health first before anything. He loved how Steve would cook for him in the morning and bring him food whenever he could, it was the little moments they shared that brought a smile to Tony's face. All the little kisses and hugs, all the loving embraces and cuddling, even the first time they made love, and Tony smiled at it all. He didn't even know he was on the verge of crying until he felt a lone tear slide down his cheek. He whipped it away and just sat there, remembering the good times before everything was ruined.
"Considering the details of the mission my doppelganger sent them on, it would be safe to say they couldn't have gone far. I'll send you the location, you are to leave immediately." Fury said. His eye then fell upon Natasha and Clint. "Agent Romanoff and Barton."
And he's never been more thankful that Natasha always had his back, and she wasn't afraid to show her true dark side that the Black Widow possessed. It was why he never got on her bad side, because she was trained to kill, and it shows as she pulled the trigger on her gun and shot Ross in the head, the man's body falling limply to the floor, his blood staining the prison floor.
"You're a smart bastard, aren't ya?" Fury said behind him. He swallowed the lump in his throat, his head turning slowly to look at the man behind him. "Don't even think about turning your head, or I will shoot you."
"What kinda idiot do you fucking take me for!? The mission you sent Steve, Nat, and Clint on, the one that got Steve captured, and also possibly getting your spy twins killed!"
Steve leaned forward and pecked Tony's lip softly before grabbing the blanket that resided next to him, pulled Tony flush against his body on his lap, causing the genius to blush a little bit, much to Steve's pleasure, before laying down and gently placing the blanket over both their forms.
, reduced him to nothing, and now that he's out of the picture. I guess it's only right for me to dispose of you." He heard the click of the gun again, and he began to panic. There's got to be something he could do! He needs to think of something! "Goodbye, Stark."
"With all due respect, sir, is that really such a bad thing?" Jarvis had a point, is falling for the Captain really such a bad thing? In a sense, no, because he adored Steve, he adored everything about him, it was never about Steve's body, it was about who Steve was as a person. Even if Steve was the ninety-pound asthmatic he was back then, Tony wouldn't treat him any differently than he would now. He was just afraid that with all the insecurities bottled up behind an iron wall inside his chest, that he would hurt him. However, Steve has assured him that he would treat him no differently, and would go through all of his insecurities with him. That's what always made Tony feel more optimistic when it came to the idea of a relationship.
He degrades himself, saying he fucked everything up and wishes he could take it all back. Wishes that he didn't betray Steve, to begin with, wishes he didn't harbour all the hatred imaginable when he made that call to him and got him captured, wishes that the roles were swapped and it was him who was in this bed. But the consequences have already been set in stone, and all he could do was be there.
Alright, so it has come to my attention that some people would rather prefer to have all the chapters at once. So, as a compromise, just in case there are people who don't mind waiting for an update, I have decided that I'll post the remaining chapters daily. Since this book is done, and I'm just moving over my stories from Wattpad onto here, I am perfectly okay with daily uploads. I hope this satisfies those who would like to receive all the chapters, and those who want to process what they have read in the previous chapters before receiving the next.
They held each other for who knows how long, but truthfully Tony didn't care. He continued to hold Steve as his lover held him close, soft sobs escaping past his lips. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Wanda, standing there with a smile on her face, which in return, caused his smile to widen. The only thing Tony could really care about, despite all the bad things that have transpired so far, was the fact that he was getting his super-soldier back, slowly but surely.
"And you think I haven't been going through as much shit like you?" He cursed. Anger rising just a little bit, food forgotten. "You betrayed me and got me locked up, in case you've forgotten. I nearly died back there, and yet you won't tell me
logical standpoint, betrayed Tony first when he tried to help Bucky. However, nobody deserves punishment like this, it's inhuman. One should not simply be subjected to any form of torture; whether it be physical or emotional, whether it comes from a friend or a loved one because the effects are detrimental. They leave too many scars that take too long to heal, tainted imprints on the mind and the heart, like a deep footprint in the mud that even after the rain had stopped and the sun beamed down, the footprint was still there.
Despite all of this, even with him having as much faith as he does in believing in his lover, it still doesn't take away the creeping pain that pulsates in his chest. He feels forgotten, neglected, used,
"I'm afraid to answer that in your current state. However, the Captain is on his way to your location."
"I've never been more sure of anything in my life. Steve means a lot to me, and I'll do anything to make him happy." She smiled at his words. She was wrong about this man when she thirsted for revenge. She was so caught up in what she hated about him, that she didn't learn the truth until it was too late. That she will never forgive herself for, but she is willing to move on.
From the communal area, they made their way outside the facility, the just crisp, yet warm and fragrant wind slapped him in his face, jostling his hair in different directions. He wouldn't be lying if he said that Wakanda was one of the most beautiful places he's ever been; from the solid, grassy plains to the brown dirt that lay just past that next to a small stream, from the mountain range to the facility they built, it was all very beautiful. He's gonna miss it after he gets everybody back to New York, but on the bright side maybe he would be willing to visit here and there.
"Screw it." He muttered. He backed up just a little bit, and ran at the door, using his shoulder to try and knock down the steel door. He collided with it, but it only made a small dent in the steel and set his shoulder on fire with a shot of pain coursing through it. He didn't care, however, because even if he got hurt right now the serum would fix it and all pain would be forgotten. So, he backed up again and rammed into the door with his shoulder a second time, loosening the screws that kept the door hinged. The third time he rammed into it, the door unhinged itself and fell inwards with a loud thud, giving him access to the prison cell.
At first, he was okay with it, because he convinced himself that this is what Steve deserved; to be beaten half to death, and to suffer in a far worse way than Tony has. But seeing the soldier lay there on the ground, unable to fight as a gun was placed against the back of his head, his heart surged and cried in anguish, and before he knew it, he was racing off to the Raft at record-breaking speed, arriving just in time to save him.
It was a week full of babysitting robots and video chatting, all of which he wasn't really complaining about. Ok, maybe the robot sitting he would complain about considering having to deal with Dum-E and his siblings were taking away his time with the good, sexy Captain.
The hope falters for a second, as he reaches the destroyed Quinjet. From what he could see, the right-wing was torn off, and where the left-wing was, it didn't exist anymore. Instead, there was a giant gash where the wing should be, going halfway down the middle of the Quinjet. There was smoke emanating from the sides, and parts of the tail end were destroyed and tattered.
this wouldn't have happened. If he had just made sure that all of Ross' guards had been accounted for, if he hadn't let that chopper slip past him, Steve wouldn't be here right now.
"Steve, don't you ever say that. You hear me?" Tony pointed his finger at the soldier. "That's a bunch of bullshit, you can never bother me. Now if you were Legolas, that's a different story. He's always hiding in the vents and bugging me, not to mention he's always with double agent."
"Oooh, Tony!" The blonde moaned. Tony rubbed Steve's trembling thighs, hands staying dangerously close to his crotch, causing the soldier to twitch inside of his mouth. He started to take more of Steve's length into his mouth gradually, working his way towards adjusting to the size of him. He noticed the way his right hand was shaking violently, a sign that he was holding back from doing something he didn't want to regret. To Tony, it was cute that Steve was letting him go at his own pace, but Tony wasn't one to not let his partners enjoy themselves. He grabbed Steve's hand and placed it on top of his head, his hair being gripped softly as Steve looked down at him, eyes alert and showing concern. The genius looked up through glazed eyes, his other hand taking Steve's left in his own, giving a squeeze of confirmation before he bobbed his head up and down again.
"I'll be back later. Hopefully if or when this all blows over, I'll be back at the tower before you know it."
"S-Steve please move! Oh, God, please fuck me!" The soldier felt the last bit of his resolve slip away at Tony's words, his hips starting to move back and forth slowly, the sound of Tony's moans hitting his ear, urging him to go faster. He placed bite marks on the geniuses neck, but at the same time, he still tried to hold back in fear of if he went too hard he could hurt Tony, considering he did have super strength. He controlled the strength he gave, but through Tony's begging, he sped up and went slightly harder. The room was full of names being moaned out loud, the sound of skin slapping against skin, pants of breaths released into the space between them, nails digging into the back of the blonde, teeth raking across the brunette's neck. They were in pure bliss, pleasure coursing through them until it spilled over, sending both men over the edge as they gasped loudly.
He thought Steve was always going to be by his side, through thick and thin. He was the only person other than Pepper who was a staple in his life, keeping him grounded from going off the deep end, and doing something he'd regret. Granted, Ultron had been just a small step in going off the deep end, but he honestly wanted to protect rather than create a murder bot. Either way, he chose his best friend over him, and it crushed him.
He said, venom dripping off every word. The spy simply stood there, his hand behind his back after he closed the door. "Don't just stand there, you asshole, tell me why you sent them on that mission?!"
He sighed to himself and reached forward, holding Tony's hand in his like he always did. He leaned forward and pulled Tony's hand closer to his lips, kissing the back of it. He didn't say anything, he didn't beg or plead, didn't cry or scream, but instead, he simply rested his head on the bedsheets, cheek pressed firmly down as his eyes fluttered closed. He was worried, absolutely worried that Tony might not wake up, but just for tonight he was going to forget about all his worries, forget about the "what if's" and the nagging negativity in the back of his mind, for now, he was just going to close his eyes and sleep next to Tony, just like he's always done since he was taken to the hospital.
He felt his hand being squeezed, followed by a soft groan. He knew Steve was beginning to wake up, but he feared how the soldier might take the news once he's told, or even realizes that something is wrong.
He has a dark side that not many people know about. He's angry because he has no one to fight for, he's aggressive because he's lost so much in his life; girlfriend, and best friend, who he still blames himself for, and not to mention he's lost someone who he never expected to get close to. He hurt him so badly, but it wasn't his fault. Everyone says it's his fault, but realistically the entirety of the situation does not sorely rest upon his shoulders.
"So, I was wondering if you..." He trailed off, his eyes maneuvering their way across the little bit of Steve's body he could see. He has to admit, the super-soldier was fit; muscular chest, a hint of abs he could run his fingers up and down on, Steve was just breathing sex by just standing there.
"That means..." His eyes widened as he heard the click of a gun being loaded behind him. He froze in place, his hands shaking as he sat there, fear gripping his body, refusing to let him move.
Slowly but surely, time moved on and he was starting to get restless. He tossed and turned in various ways, and the small grumbling sound of his stomach was not lost on his super-enhanced hearing. Actually, he forgets what a proper meal is since he has had nothing but whatever slop they had tried to give him at the raft.
most of the day, but first Steve knows he has to figure out what all is actually lost. He ends up with a whole list of sketches for actual paintings that he'll have to redo, and he also discovers that most of the canvases he stores in the same corner have smoke damage.
buy a new couch every goddamn week if this is what he gets in exchange, and Steve slides another of his own fingers into Tony's slick hole now that he has the space, pressing his fingertips down against Tony's prostate and listening to the way Tony
times on the mad dash to his studio he has to remind himself that there's no use freaking out about it until he actually sees how bad the damage actually is.
Tony sighs and the low, rough sound of his voice settles heavy and warm in Steve’s gut, makes his breath catch in his chest and Steve drags his gaze hungrily up the arch of Tony’s spine.
Steve hopes they’ll have time for all the things he wants, but he knows he has to wait. He maybe has a habit of just

always so sweet when Steve gets him broken open like this. He responds with a harsh grind of his hips, pressing his fingers deeper into the wet heat of Tony's mouth. And Tony just lets his jaw fall open a little wider, lets Steve press down against his tongue until Tony’s eyes fall closed with a breathless little noise. “Your fuckin’

worth it for the close up view of the bright red flush spreading down the back of Tony’s neck, the clump of his eyelashes as his eyes flutter open. “Gonna come for me baby?” Steve asks lowly, tightening his grip on Tony’s cock, “gonna let me feel you fall apart?”
His voice cuts off in a load shaking moan as Tony starts trusting his fingers into himself in earnest again, visibly

so responsive to every shift of Steve’s cock inside him, every tiny change in angle and every drag of Steve’s fingers over his sweat-slicked skin.

Steve groans, and for a second even the white-hot need boiling in his veins can’t compete with the butterflies that burst to life in his stomach at the small smile that pulls up the corners of Tony’s slack lips, when he rolls his tongue against the pads of Steve’s fingers with a sound caught halfway between a sigh and a moan.

grabbed the hoodie on his way out it would no doubt smell more like smoke and sweat than anything else by now. And that would pretty much defeat the purpose of stealing it.
“Still your fault,” Tony argues, because he always has to, and Steve grins wide and fond as he gives a quick buck of his hips and makes Tony’s next words come out choked and breathless. “You- I-
That's basically the only thing that's allowed Steve to keep his calm through the nightmare of the day. That and the sporadic texts from Tony of course, because Steve can so perfectly picture Tony's teasing grin behind every message. The way his blush always starts high on his cheek bones and spreads across the bridge of his nose before trailing down his throat, the tiny freckles on Tony’s nose that stand out more the redder his face gets.
Tony gasps out as Steve presses deeper, his thighs trembling and his hand scrambling at the back of the couch, all of his muscles twitching like he’s torn between trying to pull away and trying to get

“Feel so perfect like this sweetheart, spread wide and clenching around me, stuffed so full that you’re shaking’ with it,” Steve growls, not bothering to paying attention to what he’s actually saying as he drives himself into Tony’s body and for a second he wishes he could still see the way Tony’s hole

“Damn you're so gorgeous,” Steve breathes out, his gaze moving restlessly over every inch of Tony because he can’t decide where to focus,
“Found my hoodie," Tony pants out, which seems like a non-sequitur until he adds "Smelled like you, an’ you sent me all those texts earlier, I couldn’t
Tony, look so fuckin’ gorgeous like this, so perfect for me baby,” Steve groans out and his hips snap forward harder at the high, breathy whine that Tony lets out. “How you feel, sweetheart?” He asks sweetly, partially because he really does want to know and partially just because he can never get enough of Tony’s
Steve wants to be inside him, but wants to keep watching Tony try to fuck himself back onto Steve’s fingers just as much. He gets a little caught up just

baby,” Steve groans, the rhythm of his thrusts going unsteady as he drives himself into the fluttering clench of Tony’s muscles. He releases his hold on Tony’s cock to grab for Tony’s hip again, digging his fingers in as his hand threatens to slip on Tony’s skin, slick with sweat and Tony’s cum still dripping from his fingers. He regretfully pulls his fingers free from between Tony’s lips so he can support a little more of his own weight, giving himself a little more space to roll his hips back before pressing in deep again, yanking Tony back into every slam of his hips as he gasps out “Perfect, so fuckin’ perfect,
"Don't stop," he says roughly and then reluctantly tears his gaze away from Tony to locate the lube where it’s slipped between two of the couch cushions. Steve fumbles for a second with the flip-top of the bottle and as soon as he can he presses one slick finger in alongside Tony’s, feeling the easy give of his muscles, the way the hard shudder that runs up Tony’s spine has him clenching impossibly tighter.
“What is it, sweetheart?” Steve asks sweetly, like he can’t see the way Tony is shaking with desperation, can’t see shivers racing along Tony’s spine. “Talk to me, baby,” he encourages even though his own cock is
His entire body jolts when Steve strokes over his prostate again, fingers falling free from between his lips so he can brace himself against the armrest, shove himself back to meet the press of Steve’s fingers. His inner muscles clench tight while his spine pulls into a beautiful bow, and then he brokenly groans out “god,

Tony makes some more desperate, near incoherent sounds, shifting in place and clenching around Steve’s cock and Steve can’t resist that, can’t possibly deny him anymore. He gives Tony exactly what he wants in the form of short thrusts, quick and
“Yay, good game,” Tony slurs out and it startles a laugh out of Steve’s chest, loud and a little goofy the way only Tony can seem to get out of him. Tony laughs as well, soft breathy huffs of laughter that turn into a weak groan when a thin trail of Steve’s cum starts to leak out of him, and Steve watches, completely transfixed, as it makes a

Tony’s teasing tone disappears completely in favor of a breathy gasp as Steve presses two fingers past his swollen rim. They sink
“Deep breath, sweetheart,” Steve says as he nudges the head of his cock against Tony’s slick hole, and then waits until Tony lets out an impatient whine before actually pressing into him. Tony goes still with a hitching gasp, shuddering under Steve’s hand on the small of his back, and Steve is shaking too. He’s nearly losing his

It knocks a deep groan out of Steve’s chest when his gaze lands on Tony’s face and he finds that Tony has his own fingers shoved into his mouth again, his lips wet and
Whether that means convincing Tony to take a break when he’s been working too hard to watch bad 80’s comedies with Steve, or taking the time to draw every desperate, needy sound out of Tony that he can, Steve isn’t even picky. Although ideally it’s one and then the other, in any order, as often as he gets the chance.
move back a little, but then he wouldn’t be able to drag his free hand up the slope of Tony’s spine as he says “tell me what’s goin’ on in that amazing brain of yours.”
“When you’re teasin’ me, when you first wake up, tryin’ to get my attention when you think I haven’t been payin’ you enough. When you’re

In the end it's not nearly as bad as it could have been, and Steve actually lets out a sigh of relief when he’s finished inspecting every inch of the loft space, but all in all it's still not a great start to his day.
He wants to see the way Tony’s eyes shine when he smiles and the way his face flushes when Steve takes him apart. Steve wants Tony’s skin and muscle under his hands and he wants to feel Tony wrapped around his cock again, shaking like it’s too much and still begging for more. He wants to ask Tony how his meeting went and how the bots are doing over whatever kind of takeout Tony wants to order, and he wants to fall asleep with Tony in his bed.
He pushes the door open and lets it fall closed heavily behind him. Apparently he left the lights on when he ran out this morning, and it's a good thing he didn't take the time to make himself coffee or he probably would have left that on too. A loud sound comes from further in the apartment, and
lucky Tony will be in threadbare sweatpants that slide down his hips, exposing the dip of his lower back and the enticing swell of his ass.

now that Tony has gone soft and pliant beneath him. With every slurred rasp of Steve’s name Tony’s lips drag over Steve’s fingers where they’re braced in the arm of the couch, and then with a soft happy noise Tony lets his mouth fall open a little wider, his breath fast and hot against Steve’s skin. Tony’s tongue pokes out for a second, red and wet, before he wraps his lips around Steve’s fingers and Tony’s mouth is
He loves watching the way Tony thoughtlessly twists himself up into weird positions without even noticing while his brain is otherwise occupied. He likes watching the bunch of Tony's thighs as he folds his legs up under himself on his chairs, and he
“Wow, you got a lot!”  Steve said, peeking over as he poured his own collection of candy onto the rug too.  There were a few moments of silence, broken only by the clicking of Mama Rogers’ camera and the crinkling of candy wrappers being moved around.  “Hey Tony, do you want my 3 Musketeers bars?  I don’t really like the texture,” Steve said, crinkling his nose and smiling when the action made Tony giggle.
Tony cried out at the lack of stimulation, and Steve could see the blindfold had been soaked by his tears.  Steve unhooked the chains keeping Tony’s wrists against his ankles, and then pushed the blindfold away to see those beautiful, warm brown eyes.  Tony whimpered again at the sight of Steve leaning over him.  “
“Um, welcome home?” Tony called back from their bedroom, and Steve couldn’t help but smile as the man slowly came around the corner, holding a skull shaped mug.
a mature adult after all.  But Steve enjoyed being able to bring his sub a little bit of peace in between his busy schedule, and Tony
“You’ve had a week of late nights, I didn’t want to disturb you if you were already in bed!”  At Tony’s unimpressed pout, Steve chuckled.  “But I promise not to do it again?”
,” Steve said, pushing Tony down on the couch and kneeling closer to him to yell, “A plush of the sandworm from Beetlejuice!  You
Tony just knew he was turning red from Steve’s attack, and he batted helplessly at Steve’s hands.  “Please,” he gasped around laughs.  “My stomach hurts, I need to breathe!”  Thankfully Steve had mercy on him, and Tony took a few moments to catch his breath.  He looked up at his grinning boyfriend, whose cheeks were tinged red and stretched wide in a joyful grin.
There were stickers on the windows, snarling monsters and moaning ghouls looking out onto the street.  A quick peek into the kitchen revealed some more spider webs, and Steve shook his head with a laugh at the new bottles of Torani pumpkin spice syrup lined up on the counter.  The smell of coffee and pumpkin spice was pretty strong, so Steve assumed that his boyfriend was currently in the apartment.
that relief, that the Dom was unlatching the cock ring around his lovely sub.  With one, two more thrusts, Tony was screaming his pleasure to the ceiling, nails digging into Steve’s shoulders as cum splashed nearly up to the dog tags on his chest.  That image was more than enough to push Steve over the edge, and he leaned down to groan his release into Tony’s neck, holding the trembling sub painfully close as his hips shuddered against Tony.
Tony looked down at his lap where Steve rested his head, sighing in relief when he didn’t wake up from the sudden noise.  A slight breeze rustled the blond hair, and Tony tucked Steve’s blanket up further around those big shoulders before he could get chilled.  Tony was sitting on his own blanket, the top draped over his shoulders and the bottom half tucked around his legs.  He slowly combed his fingers through his Alpha’s hair, taking in the long lashes that he’d counted numerous times before, and the soft pink lips that he loved to kiss.
A few steps behind them, Maria Carbonell and Sarah Rogers watched as their sons joyfully recited the traditional phrase, their little faces lighting up when they received more treats.  “They’re going to completely knock out tonight,” Maria whispered to her friend, shaking her head in amusement as they raced away towards the next house.
With a few more lines, Steve leaned back from the easel and took in his newest painting of his beautiful sub.  While nothing could compete with the real thing sitting in the middle of the room, Steve could admit that his talent came pretty close.  He stood up, stretching his arms as far as he could above his head, groaning in relief when his back popped in a few places.  Steve smiled when Tony perked up, fairly vibrating as he approached, eager for the touch of his Dom.
Mae cuddled up next to him, pushing her way under his arm until she could rest her head against his chest.  Tony snuggled her close, kissing the top of her head and scenting happy Omega pup at the action.  “Is Daddy sleeping, Mama?”  She whispered loudly in that way that children do.
For a gentle scene like this, Steve also liked to give them to Tony because the act of returning them would bring Tony out of his subspace smoother than he’d ever done before.  He felt a wave of love through his bond with Steve, and hummed happily when Steve whispered, “I love you honey.”
The dog tags around his neck were a comforting weight, clinking gently against his arc reactor every few breaths.  A little shiver went down his spine when Tony remembered how those lovely blue eyes had gone dark and
A soft pit-pattering sound reached Tony’s ears, and he looked up to see that it had started sprinkling.  A smile crossed his face and he took another deep breath, loving the way it smelled when it rained.  He rested his head against the backrest, closing his eyes and relaxing with the ambience and the soft rocking of the swing.
Be prepared for some mega fluff y'all, I didn't set out with this idea in mind for this prompt but I'm so so happy with how it turned out!  XD
With the way Tony was resting his head on Steve’s shoulder, giggling at the cartoons, Steve had to admit that his Ma really did know best.
“Sorry, I had to catch my breath,” Steve said, still panting slightly.  Tony frowned in concern, since he knew Steve had asthma and was easily sick.  But before he could say anything, the other boy was pulling him to catch up with the group.
As he walked out of the bedroom, Tony heard the TV on from their living room and called out, “So what are we watch-”  He froze just around the corner, taking in his boyfriend sitting on the couch.  Or rather, the yellow felt dinosaur spikes peeking above the couch cushions.
Tony tensed when the wardrobe behind the mom opened and she clapped for a third time.  He tensed even further as pale hands appeared from behind the clothes inside, and he clung to Steve’s arm when the mom reached into it.  He couldn’t help gasping when the daughter popped up behind her, jumping when he felt a soft hand rubbing his shoulder.
Tony felt Steve tense a second before he was moving onto his back, reaching up to grab Mae under her arms and pull her down lay on his chest.  High giggles filled the air as Steve tickled her.  “You want some chocolate milk?  Huh?” Steve said, crying out playfully, “I wanted a nap!”
The day he met Steve, Maria had never seen him more animated and excited after a school day.  He had always enjoyed learning, and he made a few friends, but that day there was a glow around him that made Maria’s heart fill with warmth.  Tony had talked her ear off as they made dinner that evening, telling her about this little blond boy named Steve who was “the bravest boy I ever met Mama!”  While Maria had been distraught to find out Tony had been bullied, she was glad that apparently Tony had acquired a knight in shining armor.
When they scurried off to their respective bathrooms, Sarah went to prepare their milk.  They had already been flagging while sorting and trading their candies, but this drink was guaranteed to warm up their little tummies and send them off to sleep.  She placed their little mugs on the coffee table, and settled down on the armchair with a book.
Tony still had anxiety attacks every now and then, and would either want more or less attention depending on the situation.  Maria had worked hard, doing her research on how best to help her son, and was ready to either cuddle with her little Antonio until he stopped shaking, or give him the space he wanted to sort through things himself.  He would usually end up going to her afterwards anyways, because he knew she loved and supported him, and that he wouldn’t have to suffer Howard’s treatment any longer.
It may not have been the smartest idea to read something scary when he was home alone, but then again it wasn't every day that his apartment was being broken into either.
Thankfully the lube was still under the pillow from their last time, so Steve didn’t have to dislodge the needy sub beneath him.  He coated his fingers generously, and wasted no time in stretching Tony just a bit more than his actions had earlier.  When Tony started rutting against him, desperate for relief, the Dom decided Tony was ready.
“Steve darling, you can use my shower to wash up,” Sarah said, smiling when Steve bounced to his feet and ran down to her room, always excited to use the ‘grown-up’ shower.  “And Tony, you can use the hallway bathroom, all right honey?  Do you remember where the towels are?”  She asked, but she needn’t have worried.  Her son was already coming back, a red towel in hand for his friend, and she fought back a smile at how both boys blushed around their ‘thank yous’ and ‘welcomes’.
“Come on Steve!”  Tony called frantically, noticing the group of kids they’d been tagging along with walking towards the next house.  “They’re leaving us!”  After a moment he heard footsteps coming up faster behind him, then a hand grabbed his free one and he was relieved to see Steve beside him again.
Tony’s cries and moans being pushed out of him with each thrust forward went straight to Steve’s cock, driving him to go faster and harder until Tony was barely able to hang on to Steve anymore.  “
Super fluffy fluff of deaged Stony going trick-or-treating with their loving Mamas, with a sprinkling of baby crushes.  ^-^
Steve made to pull out of Tony, but the sub whined, hooking his legs around Steve’s waist to keep him close.  Steve chuckled, settling back down in a way so he wouldn’t squish Tony but still give him the weight and contact he wanted, and asked softly, “Want to stay here a little longer?”  When Tony nodded, he said easily, “No problem, sweetheart.”
Steve made long, broad strokes with his tongue, laving the area until it was shiny with his spit.  He brought his hands up to hold Tony’s cheeks apart and dove right back in,
Three years later, along with many more playdates, day trips and sleepovers, the now third graders were nearly inseparable, and Maria was happy to say she had found a good friend in Sarah Rogers as well.  There had been many late night chats when either Mama needed some advice or comforting, both being single parents.  Both had left bad relationships, wanting better for themselves and their babies, and though it was rough at the start, neither regretted that decision.
Tony isn’t even trying to form words anymore, just whining and moaning and gasping every time Steve nudges at his prostate again. Tony’s fingers dig into the back of the couch as he shoves himself back to meet every thrust of Steve’s fingers, his inner muscles pulling tight again and
So Steve fights back the words that are building behind his teeth, saves them for later, and instead finally sits back on his heels with a soft sigh and a final affectionate pat to Tony’s ass.
One of Steve's favorite things is hanging around Tony's workshop and watching him work. In his element, Tony is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen and Steve could happily watch him for
Tony makes another breathless, broken sound, but he nods and the sight of his white teeth against his knuckles as he shoves his fingers back into his mouth has Steve groaning as well, thrusting his fingers into Tony’s loose hole a little harder. Tony sobs, teeth digging into his skin, and Steve does it again. And
Steve assures him and he’s barely halfway in, but Tony is already making soft breathy sounds with every forward press of Steve’s hips, like it’s being punched out of him with every inch deeper that Steve presses inside him, splitting him open little by little. “Fuck sugar you feel like a

you look so pretty like this,” Steve breathes out, reluctantly slowing the motion of his fingers to allow Tony to catch his breath.
He pitches his weight forward, one hand sliding around the front of Tony’s thigh while he plants his other hand on the armrest beside Tony’s head, close enough that he can feel Tony’s ragged breath on his skin. All Steve can manage like this is short, deep thrusts, but it’s enough to jolt Tony forward into the arm of the couch and drag broken cries out of his chest.
He cuts off with a moan as Steve strokes his prostate again, and then his voice comes out somewhere between a sob and a
Tony’s response is too garbled to really make out, his voice cracking and breaking halfway through what was probably intended as Steve’s name, but he nods into the armrest and rocks himself back into the steady thrust of Steve’s hips, moaning and shaking and
sob out his next breath, shaking his head harder and arching his back a little more sharply. It has Steve sliding a little deeper on the next roll of his hips without even trying, and he groans roughly as Tony jerks beneath him. “Please,” Tony moans, still rocking his forehead back and forth against the armrest, “need,
“So fuckin’ gorgeous like this,” Steve sighs, letting his cock drag over Tony’s hole again in a slow tease. He moves with the motion of it as Tony tries to arch against him, just barely letting the head start to stretch Tony open again without pressing inside before sliding away again. The pleading whine that tears free from Tony’s chest is
takes his breath away from the way the soft curls of Tony’s hair are already starting to cling to his flushed forehead to the strong-yet-delicate curve of Tony’s wrist as he presses his fingers deep again. "You sure seem to be enjoyin’ yourself, sure you need anythin’ else?” Steve asks, dragging himself away from watching the slick clench of Tony’s hole and tilting his head to the side a little so he can catch Tony’s eye, smirking as he asks “what is it, baby, those clever fingers not enough for you? Not fillin’ you up the way you need, is that is sweetheart?”
With that, Steve and Tony seemed to be re-energized.  Steve released his mom to grab Tony’s hand, and the two of them started skipping back where they came from.  Maria laughed softly.  “I don’t envy you having to get them into bed tonight.”
Steve at least had the decency to look ashamed, rubbing his neck as he said, “I forgot my keys, and I was trying to jimmy the lock.  I thought you were asleep, I didn’t want to wake you.”  He stood up and stepped forward, exhaling when Tony didn’t push him away and actually melted into his embrace.  He frowned when he registered how much his boyfriend was trembling.  “Baby, you’re shaking.  Did something else happen?”
Steve felt himself blush, but quickly grabbed his mug to try and hide the reaction.  Tony sat beside him and took his own mug, giggling when they clinked their mugs together before sipping at it.  Steve was relieved to see Tony get distracted by the cartoons, that he hadn’t seen Steve blush.  He had already had a talk with his Ma, after realizing that he had a crush on Tony and wondering how to go forward.  She’d smiled in that way that meant she had a secret, but she had also advised that he just continue being himself and treating Tony right, and that things would work out by themselves.
, I give in!”  Finally his husband stopped, cheeks red around a blinding smile, and Tony was sure his own face was red from laughing so much.  “Let’s try not to wake up the
Again, sorry for the delay y'all.  I hope these next couple chapters I'm posting today make up for it.  ^-^  In other news, I passed the training/class for the UPS job I'm trying for, and now I've got to make it through the 30 day progression and I'll be officially in!  :)   I'll try my best to update this and my other two series at least somewhat consistently, but I promise they won't just be left unfinished!  And with that, enjoy!  <3
After another couple weeks passed with more stories about Steve, in which the two boys were fast becoming great friends, Maria asked if Tony would like to invite Steve over.  His brown eyes had gone wide, and he had hugged her, ecstatic to finally have a playdate.  Steve had been such a darling, polite as can be, but she had seen a bit of his more mischievous side when they had gone to the playground, playing games with Tony and encouraging him to get dirty and not worry about it.
.”  Tony hooked his arms around Steve’s shoulders to pull him close, baring his neck and submitting to his “
It had been a long week for both of them, and when Tony had come to him last night, brown eyes rimmed with red and so, so tired, Steve had immediately started planning this scene.  Tony put so much time into each of his responsibilities for the Avengers, at SHIELD, and for Stark Industries, and it was very easy for him to forget about himself along the way.  Not that Tony wasn’t capable of taking care of himself, he
Steve let go of Mae as expected, who quickly wriggled away, but then Tony saw where those hands were headed instead.  He was only able to yell, “Don’t you
“Oh I love it,” Steve said, pulling Tony closer to him to nuzzle into his neck, making Tony squeal and push at his face.
The camera flashing in his peripheral brought him back to the moment, and Tony felt his cheeks warm up when he looked to see Mama Rogers smiling at them from the couch.  It grew when she caught his eye, but he gave a sigh of relief when she only said, “All right boys, time to clean up and get into your pajamas.”  She stood up from the couch, kneeling down to brush a kiss first on top of Steve’s head and then Tony’s.
Tony looked absolutely adorable in his black jeans and oversized orange sweater that had a jack-o-lantern face on the front.  The matching orange eyeshadow plus black eyeliner made his already gorgeous eyes pop, and as Tony walked towards him, Steve noticed orange glitter sparkling in his curly hair.
feeling the chill of the day leave him.  He toweled himself off and padded into the bedroom to get his pajamas.  Grinning, he slipped into the cozy fuzzy white pants that had Jack Skellington’s face plastered all over it.  He pulled a simple black tank over his head, the apartment warm enough along with his pants and the black cat slippers he pulled from under the bed.
Steve growled playfully at him, but Tony ignored him and poked at his ribs, knowing they were sensitive and smiling when the big Alpha twitched away.  He didn’t stop tickling their daughter though, so Tony went in for the kill.  Digging his hands into the divots between Steve’s neck and collarbone, Tony couldn’t help giggling along as Steve burst into laughter.
Apparently Margaret hadn’t noticed, as she dropped back down to sit beside Tony.  She pulled the blanket tighter around herself, and Tony smiled at her content humming.  A quick peek back down revealed Steve’s eyes were closed again, so Tony gently rubbed Steve’s back as the rain continued to fall.
-” before shrieking with laughter as Steve dug his own fingers into Tony’s stomach and sides.  He could see Mae trying to defend him, pushing at Steve’s chest, and he realized belatedly how much noise they were making.
Day 4/31 of Spooktacular Halloween: Candy.  I loved writing this, it's super cute and I hope y'all enjoy it too!  <3
There was nothing more that Tony loved than being surrounded by his caring Alpha and their darling child.
By the time Tony came back with the bowl of popcorn and a package of redvines, Steve had the movie queued up and their couch cushions rearranged so that they could lie back but still eat comfortably.  Tony readily cuddled back up under the blanket, placing the bowls in their laps and settling down for the classic, glad to have a loving boyfriend like Steve.
Now it was Tony’s turn to look sheepish, using his hold on Steve to walk them into the house.  He released Steve to turn back and close the door, locking it firmly.  “I was reading a scary book, and apparently without my warm, blond teddy bear beside me, I got a little worked up,” Tony admitted, unable to meet Steve’s eyes.
“And I’m not even done, I found some amazing lights that I wanted to hang around the windows, and these adorable witch figurines that we can put with the witches and -” Steve groaned playfully, tucking his face into Tony’s neck while he chattered on about the rest of his plans.
Tony shook his head, “No, that’s OK.”  The music swelled suddenly, and Tony found himself practically in Steve’s lap.  He grinned sheepishly, curling into Steve’s warm arms.  “Actually, make that a yes.  If that’s all right?”
Tony watched gleefully as a glimmer of mischief went through Mae’s eyes, and she choked out around giggles, “Naps are
Steve came into the living room first, asking, “Can we watch some cartoons, Ma?”  He grinned when she nodded, running over to place a kiss on her cheek before leaping onto the couch.  He had just stopped on some Looney Tunes when Tony came padding out, hair all messy from being towel dried and Steve couldn’t help but think,
Maria was brought back to the present as Tony and Steve approached them, her son trying to hide a large yawn.  “Did you two get a lot of candy?”  She asked, smiling at their enthusiastic nods.  “Ready to go home, or do you want to go another block?”
Leaning more of his weight on one elbow, Steve brushed Tony’s hair out of his face, running a finger across his eyebrows, down his nose and over his lips, then repeated that a few times.  Tony hummed, eyes closing as he enjoyed the personal attention from his Dom.  “When you’re ready, you’re going to give me the tags and come back to me, all right honey?  We’ll take a quick shower, I’ll order some pizza to be delivered and then we can have a nice evening in, huh?”
Tony turned his pumpkin bucket upside-down on the rug, eyes gleaming at the candy that piled up.  He looked up at the soft laughter that followed, shooting a gap-toothed smile at Mama Rogers when he saw the camera she was holding.  A click and a flash, and then he was right back to sorting his candy.
Tony managed to escape Steve’s clutches, standing up and pointing towards the kitchen.  “I’m going to make us some popcorn, want anything else?”
.”  The softly spoken words washed over Tony, the praise making him sink further into his subspace.  There was a time when he would fight with every fiber of his being to keep from going down, because he knew how vulnerable he was, how easily he could be manipulated when he was in that state.
Tony huffed out a laugh when Mae leaned over to peer at her Daddy’s face, one small hand pushing against Steve’s shoulder to keep herself balanced.  He was sure that a sappy smile crossed his face when she leaned down further to lay the softest kiss to his cheek.  Tony heard Steve inhale more deeply, and peeked down to see his eyes flutter open.
Tony pushed against the deck softly, setting the porch swing to rock lightly once more.  Their deck was faintly lit, small LED lights strung around the awning flickering in a pattern, rather than the bright porch light that would cut through the dark.  He took a deep breath, taking in the crisp night air, enjoying the sound of frogs croaking all around them.  A train sounded its horn nearby, and Tony carefully placed a palm over his husband’s exposed ear.
“What,” Steve said blankly, looking around the tiny apartment with wide eyes.  Orange, black and white bombarded him from each corner, streamers criss-crossing everywhere and spider webs covering their furniture, with pumpkins of all shapes and sizes littered across the shelves and floor.  Little skeletons and zombies were arranged in front of their TV, and peeking from behind their movies.  Steve closed the door behind him, stepping in a few more steps and having to dodge ghosts hanging from the ceiling.
Steve let Tony give him a sip of coffee, humming appreciatively at the sweet taste.  He waited until Tony put his mug down before pulling him close.  Steve brushed a kiss on his forehead, nose before finally covering those pouting lips with his own.  Allowing himself to savor the soft, plush lips, Steve kept kissing Tony until the shorter man had to break away for a breath.
the grin on Steve's face right now. He turned around, and surprise surprise, he had a big grin plastered on his face, his eyes conveying fake innocence behind them.
Peggy, Bucky, his mother, hell, even Howard was gone, and they only got to know each other for a few minutes before everything went to shit, but at least the man left an impression on him.
"What did I do to deserve it?" I asked, my voice small in my own ears. His smile grew in size, his body coming closer to mine, so close that I could feel his breath against my ear. He placed the bucket down behind the chair, his hand slowly moving towards my face, caressing my cheek.
he sends you guys in. On top of that, only the real Fury would be able to put up with my shit for as long as he did, so you're in the clear cyclops." Fury rolled his eye and shook his head and Tony's comment.
"So, you're saying that the first mission I sent them on, was actually a ploy for these extraterrestrial beings to get information on my agents, and potentially dispose of them?"
"Alright, open your eyes," Steve whispered. And so he did, and it was a sight that while he has seen a few times before when it was just him and Pepper in Avengers tower- originally named Stark tower, the sight was still beautiful. It was all of Manhattan, lit up in the middle of the night, much like a Christmas tree on the night of Christmas Eve, and it was just breathtakingly beautiful in its own way. He could see the cars down below on the streets, all the other tall buildings that tried to scrape the sky just like his very own building, but none of them came close. Instead, he got to marvel at how each building was different; whether they lit up on the outside from top to bottom, or the lights shone on the inside, it was still beautiful. The night sky was pure black, but littered with a streak of stars and the moon shining so bright, and looming so high over them that he felt tranquility wash over him, as if the moonbeams themselves were giving him this vibe. He felt so peaceful, so at ease with the world, and it just felt so right.
"As you wish, sir." Tony and Steve happily placed themselves on the couch as Jarvis put the movie on, no space between them as they sat close to each other, hands already reaching into the bowl and digging into the popcorn. Occasionally their hands would touch and they would smile, a small chuckle also escaping from both of them. Steve put his arm around Tony as the beginning of the movie started playing, the two of them relaxing, perfectly comfortable, and having a nice time next to each other.
a reconnaissance mission, but after I decrypted it, the rest of the information was brought forth. So, if what you say is true, then who else would have access to sending them wherever the fuck they went?"
He lays on his side just like he remembers from the first night. Snuggling up with Tony and holding him in his arms, feeling his lips on his, and all of that just gone within the span of five days, almost an entire week. He thinks to himself, where did he go wrong? Did he truly deserve this life he's cursed to live now? He blames himself because he's too in love to blame Tony; and maybe it's the love he
"I have no idea what you're talking about." That smile stayed on the soldier's face as he leaned down and pecked Tony's lips, turning around and walking away after. "Meet you in the kitchen at 8!" Steve yelled before he disappeared from the lab.
"For you, I'll be the best me that you already see." Steve took off his jacket and shirt, tossing them onto the ground and leaning down to place a kiss onto Tony's lips. The genius opened the drawer next to the bed, his hands fumbling around until it grasped the bottle of lube that he kept inside. Steve pulled back from the kiss and took the bottle that was being handed to him, a cute confused expression on his face.
He wrapped his lips around Steve again, his tongue sliding up and down the underside of his shaft as the brunette slowly bobbed his head up and down.
"Shit." He swore. Seems like the teasing has affected him more than he thought it did. He regained his composure and with as much strength as he could muster into his legs, he headed out of his lab and back to his room to prepare for dinner with Steve tonight.
"Sorry, Clint, but for your own health and safety, I'm gonna need you to lay down and relax. You're badly injured." Bruce told him. He didn't argue, and he listened to the good doctor, allowing himself to be pushed back gently on the stretcher.
Warnings: This chapter contains smut. That's just basically it, smut. As for why I put smut in this chapter, well there's just a deeper meaning to it than most people would think, especially in this chapter. No idea why I'm continuing this, lol. Anyways, smut.
Another memory fragment appeared in his mind, a time where Steve had shyly shown Tony what was inside his sketchbook. It took a lot of persuasion from the genius to even get Steve to agree in showing him, because as Steve put it: "an artist doesn't just draw what's on their mind, it's not just simple lines, it's emotions in every stroke of a pencil or a brush, every color that's inserted onto a paper or canvas conveys different thoughts and feelings. Every piece of art holds sentimental value; it's our deepest thoughts, emotions, secluded into one or multiple pieces of art. It's not easy to show people what we draw." He's glad that Steve showed him what was inside because it was true beauty etched into every paper and every line.
For example, how long would he be staying here? Is he Tony's prisoner now? Realistically he wouldn't put the idea past him, because in a way that's exactly what it felt like; from the small room with the metal door to the blank white walls, and bed he barely fit on, finishing it all off with the collar around his neck, he
"I love you, too, Steven." They stayed there for a few minutes, and after a while Steve got up from his chair, telling the genius that he was going to go get a doctor and see when he could be out of here. As Tony watched Steve walkout, he could see the small pep in his step, and for the first time since Steve decided he didn't want to leave Tony's room, he wore the biggest and brightest smile upon finally leaving the room.
"Don't worry your pretty little head on that one, he loves you. Everything will go as planned." He smiled and slipped on his jacket, feeling the cold leather fitting snugly on his frame, completing his outfit. He looked down at himself, taking in his outfit before looking up at Natasha.
He watched in horror as Bruce hooked Steve up to several IVs, each needle finding its place in his arm, the heart monitor taunting him with every beep, the only thing confirming that he was alive. He didn't take his eyes off of the soldier, not even once. He didn't even move from the seat he once sat at when Natasha accompanied the stretcher Steve was laid on. He couldn't go anywhere when he didn't know the extremities of his injuries, and it sickened him. It sickened him how he sat here in this chair while his lover was fighting for his life, it sickened him he wasn't the one laying there, teetering between life and death.
"I fucked up," he started, he gave a nervous chuckle before continuing, "I took you out today, and made you genuinely happy. Then I had to be an asshole, like my father, and practically ruin it. You didn't deserve that... You just asked a simple question and I took my daddy issues, all my anger out on you. If you still want to hear about my father, then I'll tell you. Is that what you want?" He looked to the side, and his eyes widened. He felt as if his heart was being squeezed by someone's hand, or the shrapnel was cutting up the inside of his heart, whatever it was, it rocked him to his core to see the dark blue eyes, those once so sweet bright blue eyes full of life, reduced to a dull, glass shattering gaze he was looking at. It made his eyes tremble, and it made it harder to breathe as he kept staring.
"Help!" A voice responded, louder and clearer. "Someone, please help!" He raced towards the voice, not caring if his teammates were following behind. His footsteps were clumsy, he tripped on occasions but he pressed on. The voice was getting louder, more clear as he pushed through the snow. Finally, he saw it. He saw two figures in the snow, one of them belonging to his lover, and the other a woman with chestnut brown hair. His head rested in her lap, her hands gently slapping his cheek.
"Sorry to interrupt, but I think Barton just gave us a hint at how these things operate." Fury said.
It was unfair to him if he was brutally honest with himself. Everything he ever knew was lost in the history books, a bleak, fleeting moment of memories he can only recall, but never get back. It wasn't fair that he left everybody- no, it wasn't fair that everybody left him. This is where he realized the loneliness came from; it never originated from waking up in a brand new world, where everything was touched by time, technology so advanced he couldn't comprehend what the hell was going on. It originated from realizing that everybody he knew was
"Clint, will you shut up. Leave the man alone, he's busy." Natasha covered up for them. Tony sighed heavily and leaned his head against Steve's shoulder.
"Hey." A familiar voice calls out to him. He smiles to himself and stops what he's doing, turning around, and leaning against his workbench while he looks at the figure of his blonde boyfriend coming over to him.
"No, no I'm not fucking doing this." Tony got up from his spot and pushed past Natasha, making his way towards the door. He was stopped by Thor grabbing his arm, but it effectively pissed the genius off and set him off. He retracted his hand and turned towards the Asgardian, fire in his eyes and teeth bared. "
"Tony," he heard Steve groan his name, causing him to stop what he was doing and look up, "I wanna... Can I... Can I blow you?" He bit his lip to suppress a moan as his cock twitched in his pants. Any normal person wouldn't have asked, but Steve wasn't a normal person. Well, he was normal, but he was kind and considerate in bed before he became a little rougher, but his touches were still full of love and care. Tony nodded his head and rolled off of the soldier, letting his back rest against his bed as Steve moved on top of him. He watched in awe as inexperienced fingers fumbled with his belt and started pulling down his pants, his breath hitching as his erection was released from his boxers shortly after. He reached out and ran his hand through Steve's hair, biting his lip when the blonde wrapped his hand around his shaft and slowly stroked up and down. He let out a hearty moan once he felt the wet sensation of Steve's tongue around his tip, his cock entering the soldier's mouth.
"That has got to be the sappiest, and romantic thing I have ever heard. And I'm so lucky that it came from you and not someone else. I love you so much, too, Steven Grant Rogers."
It was all just a matter of time whether Steve could fix things between him and Tony, or whether it was too late to do so.
"I thought people's views on homosexuality were the same as they were back then. People could be killed if anybody found out."
"Well, h-how do I look." She studied his outfit; from the white collared shirt that exposed his chest a little, covered with his signature brown leather jacket, and finished off with dark blue jeans that hugged his legs perfectly and black dress shoes. Needless to say, he looked rather dashing.
the one who's been avoiding him this entire time, the one who's been staying in Shuri's lab every single day, and never bothering to check up on how he's doing, or bother waiting for him after every therapy session. But he just stands there and takes it, because he can't use his voice to communicate how he's feeling.
pace. I'm willing to wait as long as I need to until you're comfortable in our relationship, and until you can trust me again."
"Woah, slow down, soldier, you're rambling." Tony walked over to Steve and placed his hand on the taller male's shoulder, turning him around and lightly pushing him towards his seat. "You're thinking too much, which, by the way, coming from me, is ironic since most people know me for my intellect. Dinner looks great by the way."
The footsteps stopped, pressure applied to his head so he could not turn in any direction to look, but did he care? He's accepted it, already. That this was the end of the line for him as the cold barrel of a gun was placed against his head. He didn't care to squirm, nor did he care to plead for his life. He had nothing to live for. He lost the girl, lost his best friend- two times in a sense, once on the train and once again to Hydra controlling his mind-, lost the life he once had, and he lost the man he loved due to an ungovernable situation. Steve Rogers had nothing to live for. The one thing he had to live for, Tony Stark, had betrayed him, broken him, left him unrepairable, and Steve just accepted it.
"Oh, by the way," he stared, causing Tony to look over at him, "to answer your question of when was the last time I smiled, it was when we had a team movie night. That was probably the last time I was ever happy."
"They said they have therapy lined up for you to help you get through this, and they gave me the option to decide if you want to do it here or not. And I wanted to ask you if... Do you wanna go to therapy at S.H.I.E.L.D.?" The soldier shook his head in response, and really could Tony blame him for not wanting to speak again? He figures hearing his own voice right now sounded foreign to him. It was comparable to that of someone who took the end of a balloon and sucked the helium into their respiratory system, their voice changing into a much higher octave than what it originally was, but at the same time, that comparison is quite different. The soldier's voice was still his own; same octave, same soothing sound, but just a little jump in his speech pattern. Maybe it was more like a car when you tried to get it to start but the engine kept stuttering, not willing to function properly. Or maybe even a heart monitor, where the consistent beep would cause the line to jump and break the oh-so-steady straight line. Then again, if the line were straight it would just be one continuous long beep. That's beside the point.
Silence stretched and festered in the air between all of them, nobody knowing what to say. That is until Steve was the first to speak.
, his brain started to fog. White flashes appeared before his eyes, and they were vivid, ghostly images of the world that have left him behind. It started slow, with just normal images of 1940's housing, the sidewalks full of busy people, kids playing in the streets, classical mundane things. Then they became more violent, and he felt his chest become tight. Flashes of Peggy came into view. Her beautiful, curly brown hair rested so perfectly on her strong shoulders, dressed in the army uniform that hugged her so well. Next, it was Bucky, hanging from that steel bar on the door of the train that was blown wide open, his hand stretched out for him to take as he leaned as far as he could. But he watched once more as Bucky was unable to grab his hand, and he plummeted to his death.
"Nah, no problem here. I'm cool with it. Nat and I are just having a bet when you two will get together."
And Tony smiled in response and let himself be held in the soldier's warm, and loving embrace. There was nothing to disturb them at this moment, giving the two some much-needed alone time. And it was when Steve pressed his lips against Tony's, drawing the genius into a slow, gentle, and loving kiss, did everything seem right within the world.
"Alright, Wakanda it is." He replied. They stared into each other's eyes for just a moment. So much emotion was conveyed and confined between just the simple gazes they shared. He saw the sadness, the perpetual fear that his voice would never be the same and that he might not get his perfect eyesight back, all within those deep ocean blue eyes. Steve saw the same sadness he had, mirrored in Tony's own brown eyes, flashes of guilt swimming to the surface and turning his iris just a shade darker. How they both were hurting, and how they both so desperately hoped that everything would be ok. And it was Tony who was the one to speak, his voice full of so much hope and confidence that Steve, even in his saddened state, could feel those emotions radiating and transferring to him for just a fraction of a second.
He let out a sigh of frustration and gripped his hair, tugging on his curly brown locks out of anger. Why couldn't he just be with them, why was it so hard to just fucking let Tony come along with Steve? Why would Fury set them up?
Just then he heard the door to his room open, followed by the scent of food, or more precisely, the scent of freshly cooked bacon. He got a good whiff and he swears it made his stomach grumble and his salivary glands activate. He sat up and his eyebrows got lost somewhere in his hairline. Standing in front of him, after closing the door, was none other than Steve, a plate full of bacon, eggs, a stack of pancakes, and a mug in his other hand.
"I know you are about to see Captain Rogers, but I think there are some things I need to tell you." She spoke professionally. He raised an eyebrow at her, however, because he was confused.
"I have been trying to tell you for the last minute, sir, that Captain Rogers has awoken from his slumber. But it appears you were too busy staring off into space."
point break?" Tony said slightly angry, earning him an elbow from Nat. He rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, a fake smile plastered on his face as he sat there, waiting.
"We've apprehended one of those things that were responsible for the capture of Captain Rogers, so I thought you'd wanna ask some questions." A strange feeling washed over Tony; it pooled and swirled inside his chest first, making its way to his fingertips as they tingled, his fingers slowly curling until he formed a fist. It was a weird feeling of anger festering inside of him, but in the mix, he could feel something along the lines of revenge. Was that the feeling? It felt like it. He was going to march down there and let every ounce of hatred drip off of him in the form of either words or maybe fists. He was hoping for the latter.
"Sir, I think you should take a look at the screen in the bottom left, the footage in the upper left corner," Jarvis said. His eyes moved over as well as the cursor, clicking on the image. He saw Fury entering the security room, his head turning in different directions, a gun hidden in the pocket of his cloak that Tony could see from the angle of the camera.
"You passed out genius, do you not remember anything?" Natasha asked. He groaned and sat up, a cup of water is presented to him by Bruce. He smiled at the good doctor and brought the cup to his lips, savoring the feel of the crystal clear cold liquid splashing against the inside of his mouth, a content sigh escaping his lips after he swallowed.
He manages to get at least a few hours of sleep, quiet, peaceful, undisturbed sleep, but that can only last for so long. He moves around in his sleep, ruffling the sheets, whimpering to himself, squeezing the pillow close to him so incredibly tight, the feathers inside the pillow threaten to burst out from their confinement. He broke out into a sweat, the culprit of his actions were the nightmares that continued to haunt him through the middle of the night. It's no wonder why he chooses not to sleep sometimes, that, mixed in with the fact the serum more than makes up for the lack of food, water, and sleep. It's hard for him to really relax in the middle of the night.
"Enjoying the sight in front of me." In all of Tony's life, he has never gotten embarrassed at all because, well, Tony Stark doesn't get embarrassed, but holy shit does Steve make everything he's worked towards building up inside of himself just change. Not only did he feel his lips curl into a big smile, but he also felt the presence of heat on his cheeks. He coughed a little bit and placed his hand over his mouth to hide his smile, but the soldier was already smiling in response at seeing the gesture that warmed his heart.
"We tried to find traces of where they may have gone, but the evidence seems to not be there. Or rather, there was no evidence, to begin with." Natasha speaks, not looking away from the TV. "We told Fury about it and he's investigating it, so if he finds anything then we'll be back out there."
"H-he broke my f-fingers, Steve... He broke them." And Tony felt nauseous looking at his own bent and broken fingers. His thumb on his left hand dislocated and angled too far backward, the ring finger on the same hand twisted to the right just a little. On his right hand, his pointer finger was curved disgustingly upwards and his middle finger was bent downwards and slightly inwards. It was a horrible sight for both of them to witness, and Steve really felt for the genius.
"I want to." Steve closed the distance and his lips connected with Tony's, causing the geniuses' eyes to flutter shut in response. It was a chaste kiss, slow and gentle, Steve brushing his fingers on Tony's cheek, both participants smiling into the kiss. It felt similar to when he kissed Peggy. There was this uncontrollable warmth surging through his entire body. However, it was also vastly different. This wasn't a kiss that would end with a goodbye, and while Peggy's lips, just like everything else about her was soft, Tony's lips were just a little more chapped, a little bit cracked due to him probably biting them from nervousness, but that didn't stop Steve from enjoying the kiss.
Probably ten more minutes passed before Tony heard the screen door creak open, and he smiled knowingly.  Opening his eyes, Tony looked over to see a pair of familiar blue eyes peering out at him.  Tilting his head, their little girl Margaret squealed happily, covering her mouth to stifle more giggles when Tony raised a finger to his lips.  She closed the door softly, then scurried over to sit beside Tony, who quickly placed the blanket around her too.
