. But before he could get anything out, Steve was doing that face again, the one he pulled whenever he wanted to mask how much pain he was actually in. It was a valiant attempt overall, Tony had to give him that, but even after a couple hours with the guy he’d figured out most of his tells. The important ones, anyway.
“They’ve got a claw on one of their toes,” Peter answered immediately. Quietly. “Three inches long. They probably use it for stabbing, to defend themselves.”
Bruce was off to the lab, to watch baby dinosaurs hatch and hopefully talk some sense into the scientists there, leaving Tony alone to wait for the Jeep that was set to take him around the parts of the island they didn’t get to yesterday.
Bruce was curled up behind a verdant bush, hugging his knees to his chest. His glasses were lost, his hair completely disheveled, and when just a minute ago he’d been wearing dark purple shorts, now all that covered him was more or less a fig leaf. Tony might’ve gotten more of an eyeful than he anticipated.
“Little bit,” he said, though he bit down on his lip a bit too hard afterwards to be fully convincing.
“I— What?” Tony only just managed to get out, still a bit dazed by the turn this conversation had taken. “What are you—?”
Tony reciprocates with a smile of his own, soft and warm, one that feels entirely like home. “See you tonight. Seven sharp, don’t be late. And wear cufflinks!”
“Of Dr. Banner’s seven PhDs,” Osborn amended, “especially the one in biochemistry, I feel like he fits the bill.”
“Sweetheart, anything more romantic than that and you might’ve actually killed me,” Steve teased, cupping Tony’s face between his hands. He pressed a tiny kiss to the corner of his mouth. “Ask me again. I’ll try not to let you take my breath away this time — at least, not so literally.”
The entire ride, Osborn was on the phone with his lawyer, patiently going over all the security protocols in place, and while the list was extensive, Tony couldn’t help but think he’d made a terrible mistake in agreeing to this. Whatever
Steve’s tired from his sparring session with Nat and late to lunch with Bucky, so when he sweeps through the lab to pick up his sketchbook and kiss Tony goodbye on the way out, he’s too distracted to notice his own carelessness right away.
There were many words that could be used to describe Norman Osborn—brilliant and crazy among the most popular—but stupid wasn’t one of them. He was persistent too, and nothing short of Tony changing his phone number every other day would dispel the man from calling again and again, calling Pepper, Rhodey, even Happy, to convince Tony to take a trip down to his secluded island.
Steve heaved out a sigh, looking away for a moment as he collected his thoughts, and when he finally turned back to Tony, jaw stiff and determined, he said, “There’s something I have to tell you. I know this isn’t really—” he gestured helplessly in the small space between their bodies “—the best timing, with everything that happened to you today, but… I’ve been working up to it all day, so just, please, listen. You don’t have to say anything, I just need to get it out.”
“Okay, everyone shut up and let me think,” Tony stressed, finally looking up from the gauntlet—and just in case, he gave it a good old smack, like it was an old boxy television set—to survey the sight in front of them.
, ran through Tony’s head—leaving a large gash on the back of his leg. Blood darkened his suit, slowly blossoming, but Steve didn’t stop. It was like he hadn’t even noticed until he’d knocked one of the creatures out, nearly collapsing as he took a step back, but catching himself just in time. He swayed on his feet, squaring up in front of the last velociraptor, like a concussed boxer readying for his last round in the ring, and swung the shield in front of him. The velociraptor easily dodged it, and Steve ducked to avoid the subsequent swipe directed right at his head, losing the shield as he threw his arms out to steady himself.
Bruce emerged after a few minutes, looking for all intents and purposes like some kind of safari tour guide, with khaki shorts that ended just above the knee and an oversized Jurassic Park t-shirt that matched his similarly logoed baseball cap. The shirt was, of course, tucked into his pants. Somehow, he managed to wrangle up some socks and hiking boots too, but despite the fact that he was no longer in his birthday suit, was obviously displeased at the fashion—or lack thereof—that the park’s merchandising offered. Bruce tugged at the hem of his shorts, grimacing as if wearing them physically pained him. “Why are these so tight? It’s making me itchy.”
“Don’t even start. You’re lucky I wore anything at all,” Clint retorted, and started chugging coffee straight from the pot as he went to sit down at the kitchen table.
Except for the fact that Tony had no idea where they were, too caught up in their adrenaline-fueled escape that he hadn’t made a point to keep track of which turns they’d made or which landmarks they’d passed. He just needed a map or JARVIS or—
“Hey!” he yelled, in a voice that was very real and very familiar, as one of the velociraptors tackled him like a linebacker. “Mind tossing that back to me?”
“Just another Howard Stark,” Steve said, just a touch of uncertainty in his tone, as if he wasn’t sure how that was going to be received.
“I’ve been thinking a lot about what would happen if I don’t get the serum back,” he started. “If I’m just… this. For the rest of my life.”
This had already wasted about ten minutes of his precious time, and Tony didn’t want to risk staying here, in the fear that he might accidentally give away some of his most confidential secrets. Not that he kept many from the team, not after they’d slowly wormed their way through the cracks in what used to be a near-impenetrable armour, but still. Some things he liked to keep close to his chest.
“Okay, new plan,” Tony said. There was really only one option left, and while it wasn’t exactly ideal, it would give the others a way out. “I’ll create a diversion. Bruce, first chance you get, take the kids and haul ass. Find the backup power generators, switch them on, and then we’ll meet up at the jet. Got it?”
"And we all know how trustworthy the government is right? It's not like S.H.I.E.L.D turned out to actually be H.Y.D.R.A in disguise. They told me you saw the raft. Do you honestly think that that's right. We get dropped off in the middle of the ocean, where we'll be forgotten all because we don't want to sign the accords. Did you see Wanda? She was wearing a shock collar and straight jacket" they sat in an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes. Maybe time couldn't heal all wounds. Maybe they were too broken to ever mold together again. Steve sighed, redrawing Tony's attention.
"You ready for today?" Steve asked her, because while today would be tough on him he knew it would also be hard on everyone else involved. Wanda's back stiffened after he asked, but she didn't stop to look at him, choosing to focus on the buttons.
"I'm not apologizing for the accords. There are things I have to apologize for, I know that. But you can preach your damn accords until you're blue in the face. You won't change my mind" Steve crossed his arms across his chest, and Tony breathed heavily through his nose. It was like a dragon, getting ready to blow fire.
He couldn't have asked for a better support team. The only thing missing was Tony. Despite it being close to ten months since last seeing him, he could not get over Tony. He watched the news and Vision would provide updates, but it did nothing to ease his mind. Was it wrong of him to keep their children a secret? Probably. Tony had a right to know he helped create something that wasn't a machine, but Steve couldn't risk it. If he told Tony he wasn't sure what the man would do. And if he took the children from Steve, well Steve wasn't sure if he could survive first loosing his husband then his children. So no, Steve was going to be selfish for once in his life, and keep the children to himself.
all that time Steve worried about Tony, Tony had always pushed him away and told him he was fine. Now he was experiencing something similar and he understood how Steve felt. It sucked. Never again would he push away Steve's mother hen self. That is, if they ever got there again.
he swore to Steve that night as they laid in bed that he would never be like Howard. Kids have two parents for a reason. He'd have a late start but better late then never. First things first, he had to fix the phone.
"Bucky was a prisoner of war for almost a hundred years. He was tortured everyday and forced to do things he didn't want to do. Tony was in Afghanistan for three months, and still he has nightmares and PTSD to this day. I'm not trying to say that Bucky went through worse because everyone goes through things differently, but don't you think Tony should understand little bit better then most? The only reason he doesn't is because it's a personal matter. You were trying to protect Bucky. You lost him once, you didn't want to loose him again, and I understand that. If it was Clint, I'd do the exact same thing. And Tony would too if it was Rhodey. Why should you apologize for something you know Tony would do if it involved Rhodey?" Nat gently told him but still with a steel voice trying to get him to understand, but he didn't.
“No, breakfast sandwiches are perfect” Tony couldn’t help the love filled smile that crossed his face.
"Hey Steve, we're going to bring the cake out now" Adia stepped in, and bless that woman. She wrapped an arm around his waist, her petite frame making her not able to reach his shoulders not that many people could, and guided him away to stand in front of the connecting kitchen doors where they would roll out the cake. He knew T'Challa had probably order the cake to be brought out earlier to save people from awkwardly standing around waiting to do something.
The other question I get asked is, is Bucky and Sam going to get together? And all I can say is, WinterFalcon fans should end up happy by the end of the story.
and Tony nodded without hesitation. They still had a lot to talk about, and Steve was determined to get an apology from him, but he would enjoy this moment.
"That was one time! And you swore you would never speak of it again" she playfully punched his shoulder, and Steve chuckled. What an embarrassing moment that had been for all of them, when Steve had opened up the broom closet in the palace, thinking it was a bathroom door, and instead of a toilet he saw Wanda and Vision in a heavy make out session. Thankfully, clothes were still on.
"So, what is the little boys name?" Nat asked. "I can't keep calling him bud" Steve took one look at his son, and knew the name he chose was perfect.
Every time they said 'I hate you" to one another, which was a lot, Steve knew they didn't mean it. There was a hidden message in those words.
“Excuse me? You may be the Captain, but when have I ever listened to your orders?” who the hell did Steve think he was, to tell Tony he couldn’t be there when the man he loved most in the world was going to be in danger?
"I'm not sure, we've never performed any tests. This is the first I'm seeing of unusual strength. They have always had a bigger appetite than other children, but I had hoped it just had to do with a fast metabolism" what happens when the world finds out? What happens when his enemies find out that not only does Captain America and Iron Man have children, but they possess parts of the serum? And James is clearly going to be a genius just like his father, so he'll have the brains
"What all did you talk about?" Nat continued to pry, and that was one of the reasons she was such a good spy. She could never not know things, and was always looking for answers. Kind of like a scientist, but scarier and more likely to use pain to get information.
"I told you, she has the Stark smirk" Steve told Tony when he saw Maria's face. It amazed him how much sass and deviousness a one year old could put into a look, but their daughter had mastered it. He glanced over at Tony who was smiling at her, looking completely in love. It was obvious that James would pursue the same interests as Tony, maybe even have his brain, but it was Maria who would have the Stark personality. They should really warn people that instead of one Stark there would be two. Steve wasn't sure if the world could handle two together, and if they ever all lived together again the amount of sass, back talking, and inappropriate jokes would be through the roof. After all, no one snarks like a Stark.
So a lot of people have been asking me why Tony didn't apologize for anything, and it's like you guys read my mind, because that's actually going to be a huge part of this story. There will be no Stony until Tony apologizes, because he is not the innocent victim while Steve is the bad guy. Not in this story.
"We're having a party, in two weeks for their first birthday. Would you want to come? You could come a few days earlier if you wanted, that way you could meet them in private, and you could bring whoever you wanted. I could text you our coordinates"
It was almost time, and Steve couldn't wait. Soon his babies would be here and despite knowing the pain he would most likely endure from having to push out two babies, he was ready. At thirty nine weeks, he knew it was only a matter of time.
"Today has been a lovely day, but I must take my leave now. Anthony, you and your friends are welcome to stay for as long as you like. I can have someone show you your rooms later should you choose to stay. Steven, I will talk to you and your friends in a bit" T'Challa gave him a look that told him it was Nomad business. He nodded his head in understanding, ignoring Tony's curious gaze. T'Challa crossed his arms in the Wakandan pose, and Steve mirrored it.
“Okay, good,” Tony says. He’s got a funny little look on his face, like he’s trying to solve a difficult equation, and just as he’s surely about to ask if Steve’s okay for the fourth time in half as many hours, the elevator opens with a ding.
Miraculously, the only dinosaurs they had run into along the last leg of their journey had been, for the most part, herbivorous, which only made Tony grow even more anxious. He was the same kind of jittery as if he’d just downed six shots of espresso, snapping to attention at every little sound, constantly vigilant for even the slightest danger they might encounter, and when finally he caught sight of the quinjet in the distance, Tony didn’t think he’d ever felt more relieved in his life. It was almost too good to be true, at this point, after days of dreaming about this exact moment, and he had to glance over at Steve’s matching expression—grim determination making way for silent cheer—just to affirm it wasn’t simply a mirage.
"You really thought I would take them from you?" Tony didn't sound mad as he spoke, he sounded genuinely curious.
"Tony" Rhodey warned and Tony held his hands up like he was surrendering. But everyone who knew Tony knew he wouldn't stay down for long before he started firing questions again. It was one of the traits that Steve had hated in the beginning, then slowly grew to love. Now, he was starting to hate it again.
"You ok?" Bucky asked noticing his discomfort. Steve started to nod but stopped when he felt another sharp cramp like pain take over. It was the worst one yet. Groaning in pain he looked at Buck in panic.
“Well guess what Steve? I can’t lose you either. I’m just getting you back” Tony stroked his cheek, and he leaned into the touch. “So if you’re fighting, I’m fighting. And I don’t give a damn if Ross sees Iron Man fighting alongside you, we can cross that bridge when it happens” and the way Tony said it, so determined, told Steve it would probably be easier to convince Bucky to cut his hair then it would be to stop Tony.
"BOMB" he yelled over the comm, grabbing Nat, who yelled in shock, and threw her over his shoulder, before sprinting down his hallway.
Tony laying on the cold stone floor under him, Steve straddling him but it wasn't intimate or playful like usual.
“I don’t think so. Probably just hang out here for the day, read up on some things T’Challa sent me. Maybe, if you’re interested we could walk around Wakanda, and I could show you around? Rhodey could come to” Steve asked, not able to hide the hopefulness in his voice that Tony would say yes.
"Congratulations Steve; it's a boy!" Adia congratulated showing Steve the monitor which showed the baby and Steve never thought he could fall more in love with technology then he did right there. "So that's the head, two legs, two arms and-" Adia suddenly stopped speaking as she looked at the monitor eyes squinting as she looked, and Steve felt himself start to panic.
“Sam?” It was Steve who snapped Sam out of his thoughts. He realized in embarrassment that he was still starring at Bucky’s lips, and had even leaned in a little bit.
"Tony, we can work on this first thing in the morning. Clint, Nat, and Nomad should all be checked over by a doctor just to make sure they are ok. Especially Nomad, who knows what sort of strain was put on his muscles" none, but no one knew that. Tony looked ready to argue, but stopped as he looked around him, almost like he was seeing the destruction for the first time. Majority of the building was still standing, but the rooms right where the bomb had been were blown away, and sections of the wall surrounded them. Obviously, H.Y.D.R.A had just meant to scare them, not kill.
"I'm doing great Thor, this is a piece of cake" he said with fake sarcasm. Really it was a piece of cake. Thor didn't seem to understand as he looked at him in confusion, but before he could comment Tony was also sliding up to them.
"Ya I see you have another arm. Surprised they would make you one" Bucky froze as Tony's words swept over him. But before Steve could jump in and defend Bucky, or possibly defend Tony from Bucky, it was Sam who jumped in.
"No, Steve really I'm honoured. It was just a shock" Rhodey grinned looking at Maria. He groaned after a second though and Tony turned to him worried.
Also, chapters will be getting longer now, now that we've gotten to the main plot of the story (getting them together again)
“Good morning sweethearts” Steve grinned, seeing both of his kids standing in their cribs. It was tricky dealing with both of them in the morning; both wanted his immediate attention, and he couldn’t change and dress both of them at the same time, meaning someone had to wait. And the thing about one year olds, is you can’t explain that to them. So, they usually end up crying.
“So what is your plan?” more importantly, when did he need to be available. If he couldn’t stop Steve, then Steve couldn’t stop him from joining.
"This is Nathan Carron. He was found dead in an alleyway in France two weeks ago which is where him and his wife were vacationing" Shuri explained pulling up the mans picture. He looked young, maybe around his own age. He had dirty blonde hair, blue eyes and had wide shoulders.
“Thankfully I’m awake” Steve looked over his shoulder to see Tony leaning against the doorframe, running a hand through his hair to push it out of his face. It only resulted in it getting messy, and causing inappropriate thoughts to run through Steve’s mind. Feeling himself flush over picturing other reasons Tony’s hair sometimes looked like that, he turned away from the man and focused on their son.
parasite? He'd be fine in the end. He'd much rather be in his bed where he could hide under the covers and slowly drift away. He was still debating on whether or not he would abort it. It was still small enough that if he did it wouldn't feel any pain. If he chose abortion it could be easier; he's a war criminal, he doesn't have time to change diapers and play patty cake. When he thought about it like that, abortion seemed like the best choice. But, there was a part of him that screamed at him to let the baby live. If he killed this baby, he was killing off every connection to before the accords. He would be cutting the string that tied him to the past.
The boom was deafening as the bomb exploded, the walls rattling as pieces started to fall. The force caused him to bang his head against the wall, but he soldiered on and dug his fingers into the wall causing dents from his strength. Debris started to fall onto him, the ceiling starting to crack above them. Still he did not move, not letting a single piece touch either of his friends.
“Ya, I’m here” the Winter Soldier didn’t look convinced, and why would he? He was a trained assassin forced to suppress his emotions and be able to read everyone else’s. Of course he would never believe Steve. But Steve was saved from questioning as they approached the doors to the medical room. Without knocking they walked in, and Steve hoped that that wasn’t considered rude here. They’d only been here a month and he was still unsure of the customs.
"We have kids!" Tony blurted out before she could finish, and he threw one of his wrenches across the room, finding the urge to destroy things instead of fix them.
"When Tony and the others are all gone we'll head out. He's not leaving for a few days so that gives us time to set up a plan that doesn't involve my kids loosing a parent" Steve said using his Captain's voice, and without waiting for an answer turned and left the room. He could hear the whispers behind him but he kept going, wanting to get home to his babies now more than ever. He was right when he said everything was going to change, but he didn't imagine to this extent. Someone fell into step beside him and without having to look he knew it was Nat.
Going into the kitchen so he could fill a bucket to scrub the floors and get rid of the yellow paint, he saw the cell phone still on the ground. Bending down to pick it up he examined it in his hands. There was a crack in the screen, but other then that it was fine. He knew he'd never be able to just toss it, even if Tony were to tell him to rot in hell or something along those lines, so he opened the drawer to put it back in its spot, and jumped when it started to ring.
"You don't" he finally admitted, and that was honest. Tony couldn't know that he was a good person without proof, and Steve had none of that.
"Grab James" Steve scooped up Maria and balanced her on his hip. "I'm probably going to call it a night as well, so good night everyone" he smiled at the people in the room, who offered him a 'good night' back, but did not glance up from the tv where The Godfather was playing. It was one of the first movies Tony had made Steve watch, apparently it was a cinematic masterpiece.
“Ok grandpa, we’ll all get up early and go bird watching with you. Maybe we’ll see something other than a cardinal or robin for once” Steve fixed him with his best bitch face, and Tony chuckled into his mug. The coffee was made perfectly, but was that really a surprise?
"I don't remember promising anything" Steve teased and Wanda huffed, before marching the rest of the way to the palace. It wasn't that long of a walk, and it was peaceful and warm so no one minded. Nat, Bucky, Sam, T'Challa, Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, Queen Ramonda, and Adia were all going to be there, and a few other palace people that Steve knew. Tony would definitely bring Rhodey and Pepper, maybe Happy, and Wanda said Vision was coming, so it would be a decent sized party. Clint and Scott couldn't make it, both not wanting to risk anything with their house arrests, but soon they swore they would see each other again. And Bruce and Thor were still no shows. No one even knew if Bruce was alive.
"Ya, after our talk he said he would stay. Guess our talk was actually good" Steve smiled, despite what just happened two minutes ago. Tony never failed to put a smile on his face.
"Named after Barnes?" of course Tony wouldn't be able to let him talk without interrupting. Sometimes it would seem that Tony was incapable of holding his tongue. He said it was part of his charm. Although, Steve noticed that when he said Barnes it wasn't as venomous as it usually was. It seemed nicer. Still with an edge to it, but almost mellowed out. Like instead of a steak knife it was a butter knife.
"I'm not hungry" he muttered, harshly shoving the bowl away from him. It rolled to its sides for a couple of seconds, dangerously close to spilling, but then settled. Natasha took a deep breath through her nose, in what he assumed was a way to calm down and not lash out. He had seen Bruce do it a few times when a situation might make him a little green.
"Let's just agree that we both could have handled things a lot different. Let's agree that no one was in the complete wrong or right" he smiled at Tony, and his ex didn't hesitate to return it. It looked like Tony wanted to say more, maybe lean in and hug Steve, but he refrained. And Steve was ok with that. Their problems couldn't be fixed in one day, but at least Steve could go to bed tonight knowing that when he woke up in the morning Tony would still be here, that he hadn't left in the middle of the night after realizing he couldn't deal with this.
"Unfortunately I don't think you'll be getting much sleep for a while. Babies need a lot of attention" Bucky had read every book he possibly could on pregnancy and on infants. It was very sweet. Bucky had decided that he wanted to really step up for Steve and these kids. He felt responsible for the accords, and what happened with Tony so he felt that it was his job to really be there for Steve. He knew he would never be able to replace Tony, and he didn't want to, but he would make sure that he wouldn't let his best friend go through this alone.
"Get enough alcohol in this guy and he'll do anything you say" Tony clapped Rhodey on the shoulder who shrugged him off.
Steve raising the shield above his head and slamming it down on the arc reactor, not thinking, to driven by his anger over the situation.
It was a scary thought, thinking about if his babies could have gotten some parts of the serum. Before Steve was in Wakanda he was constantly being tracked down by people who all wanted the serum for themselves. The thought of anyone trying to hurt his babies because of the serum sent a thing of rage through him. Over his dead body would anything ever happen to Maria or James.
“About a week or two before we came here” He felt his heart start to speed up. Please don’t let it be true, please. I can’t handle it, not now. The doctor grabbed something from her desk and handed it to Steve. It was long and white and cool to touch. A pregnancy test.
The room was decorated beautifully. Pink and blue balloons were scattered across the floor, some in the ceilings along with streamers. There was a table full of presents, and another full of snacks. The dining tables either had a blue or pink table cloth on them, and there was two giant one balloons. The floor was spotless so that if Steve put the kids down they wouldn't choke on anything. Everyone had truly outdone themselves.
"Tell me you are just babysitting. You tell me that they are Nat's or the witch's, hell even Barnes's psycho child. Tell me" Tony pleaded and Steve knew this was the moment of truth.
"I'd like that. Shit Steve, they sound perfect" Tony finally said, voice cracking a little, and he couldn't be more right. Steve grinned as he realized Tony had just called him Steve for the first time, and not Rogers. He wouldn't comment on it because he didn't want to set Tony off, but he felt tingly. Maybe one day they wouldn't be walking around on egg shells with each other.
"How long has this argument been going on?" Steve announced his presence, although it was probably unnecessary. A super soldier with advanced hearing, a trained spy, a military air pilot, and a witch that could hear peoples thoughts were not people you could hide from. No one could ever sneak up on any of them, and the thought made Steve feel relived. If anyone ever tried to get near his babies, they wouldn't get very far.
“Steve, they aren’t scared of you. They aren’t even going to remember this when they grow up. I promise”
"Please, like that old asshole could ever get into my systems" and that sounded like the old Tony, his Tony, that he couldn't resist saying it.
"I can still hear him sometimes" he voice was so broken, and Steve wanted nothing more then to wrap his arms around her and shield her from everything. "When he first died I was always scared that I would lose his voice. That one day I would try and remember him and it would all be blank. But with my telepathy I used to go into his heads sometimes to talk. When we would be in separate rooms. And because of that my mind will never forget what he sounded like. And I don't know if it would have been better to have forgotten what his voice was like" she looked at Steve with a look that pleaded with him to help her.
"Ready to burst" Steve rubbed his stomach fondly as he spoke. Sometimes when he touched his stomach one of the babies would kick. Maria had come out of hiding and was just as active as her brother, who still didn't have a name. He had an idea as to what he wanted to name him, but he would wait until he was born to decide if the name would fit.
was left unsaid, but Steve's sure Tony picked up on it. He was always good at being able to pick up what Steve wasn't saying. It was another reason they worked so well together, both being able to just sense and read the other person, being able to communicate with no words. He waited with bated breath for Tony's answer.
"So you've given him the James curse? For shame Rogers" and it wasn't that funny, but hearing Tony joke around with him in that teasing tone of his, sent Steve into a fit of giggles that he couldn't stop. It was almost like old times. After a few moments he managed to compose himself and cleared his throat.
At exactly seven am Steve woke up, the sun shining through his window and onto his face. Steve blinked and rubbed his eyes, slowly sitting up. Despite the fact that Steve woke up early every morning, he didn’t jump out of bed straight away, wide awake and ready to do all his Captain duties. It still took him a few minutes to gather his thoughts.
"I just want you to know, one of these is my god child" he told him and Steve chuckled. As much as Steve wanted to make Bucky the godfather he knew the safest option would be to make it Sam. Bucky would always have a target on his back. At least Sam was less known, he could disappear easier. He just wasn't sure how to bring that up without making Bucky believe it was because of his Winter Soldier side. He could always make Sam godfather of one, and Bucky of the other but he couldn't. Tony was supposed to name Rhodey godfather of the other. That's how it would have been. Steve picks two, and Tony would pick two. It was obvious who Tony would pick. The two people who were always by his side; Rhodey and Pepper. And in a perfect world Steve would name Bucky and Nat as his. But there he goes again with his wishful thinking.
“Nat, Bucky, and Sam are probably already up. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if they aren’t even here. They normally leave to go jog on some of the paths. Wanda likes to sleep in, seriously don’t even attempt to wake her up, and Vision will probably stay in her room until she wakes” he had received a hair brush to the head the one time he had tried to drag her out of bed. It was 8:30, that was late enough. At least, that’s what Steve thought.
was left unsaid, but it was what Tony was thinking. Steve had seemed nervous when he met back up with Tony after the meeting, and Tony had assumed it was nerves due to talking to Tony. Maybe it was actually due to the meeting. Was Steve in trouble?
kid" he spat at Tony, who flinched a little at how angry he sounded. Getting mad seemed to be impossible to avoid no matter how hard he tried.
Steve looked up from where he was cutting up a banana. James was holding the remote in hand, pushing buttons and the channel had changed to the news. Putting down the knife Steve went into the living room and grabbed the remote from his son, who seemed to now be trying to take it apart. Maria started to cry over the loss of her precious Dora.
"Ok. I'm going to go find my friends, and tell them the change of plans. Pepper and Happy will probably go home, but Rhodey might stay. We'll tour the palace, I hear the princess has a lab that's supposedly better then mine. Doubt it. You should go have that meeting with King kitten, and then after maybe you can take me to your house" Tony stood up and pat him on the shoulder before making his leave.
"Hey" Tony whispered, and Steve's gaze flickered upwards for a split second before dropping again. Tony wasn't looking at him, instead keeping his gaze on Maria, so Steve kept his on James.
"I can carry the toys back, while you sort the kids" Bucky offered, and that was the wrong thing to say to not get Tony going again.
"Don't want to keep everyone waiting" Steve whispered and Tony nodded, turning to face the candle that was starting to burn out. Steve knew what he would wish for, and he hoped that wishes really did come true from candles, and even if it wasn't his birthday. Together they blew out the candle and their audience cheered. Steve smiled clutching James tighter to him.
"Ya, I did" they grew silent again, and Steve didn't know what else he could say that would help Tony. There was one thing, but he wasn't sure if Tony would want to. But this was all about starting something together, meaning no more secrets and lies. Plus he'd never know unless he offered.
"Please sugar bear, you know you love me. It's in our best friends contract that you have to" Tony said winking at him and Rhodey shook his head.
"How would you manage a search like that?" Steve asked, because like Bucky said H.Y.D.R.A was good at killing people. If they didn't want to be found, you wouldn't find them. You'd be dead before you realized someone was in the room with you.
“You made a loud noise, and they got scared. They got scared of the situation, they aren’t scared of you” Tony tried to assure him, but he shook his head sadly. Tony grabbed Steve’s shoulder and forced him to look at him.
So a few people have commented on Frank Castle being in the story. I know it seems weird to have him in it, but I do have a plan with him, he wasn't just a random decision. Basically, because of what H.Y.D.R.A is doing Steve obviously wants revenge. He thinks he wants to be violent and resort to killing them all, but when he sees Frank Castle in action that is going to make him question and decide who he really is, and what his beliefs and values are.
Steve had started to take better care of himself to, which everyone was grateful for. He tried to get at least six hours of sleep a night, ate four meals a day, and made sure to have a full conversation with someone everyday. Of course, he still had his bad days where he wanted nothing to do with the world, but seeing his stomach gave him the strength to keep going even if he didn't want to. Because Steve Rogers was one thing above all else; selfless, and in order for this baby to survive, Steve had to survive.
"I hope I made something everyone likes. We have other things in the kitchen if you want something else" Steve told everyone, already cutting up the grilled cheese he had made separately for the kids. He read that children under three shouldn't have hotdogs because they are slippery and can get caught in their throats. He wasn't sure if that was true, but he was kind of a helicopter parent he discovered, and he wasn't going to chance anything.
"You're having twins?" Nat asked smiling as she spoke. If you ever wanted to see the deadly Black Widow smile, just mention kids. Not the snot nosed brats who cried at everything, but the angelic ones who would worship the ground Nat walked on. Those were the kids she liked.
"Exactly" Bucky smirked, and Sam punched his shoulder, a lot more gentle then he would have two years ago. Something was happening between the two of them, and Steve was happy to sit back and watch them realize they loved each other. If this was how he and Tony acted in the beginning, both hiding their feelings with snark and attitude then he understood why everyone smirked knowingly at each other when he and Tony talked. Because now he shared those smirks with Nat and Wanda.
"How'd it go? You figure out the gender?" that got everyone's attention, all eager to hear what the peanut would be.
"Tony" Pepper spoke gently but firmly, squeezing his shoulder in a comforting gesture. Steve tightened his grip on one of the books he was holding at seeing how close they were.
"Ya, good thing I got plenty of sleep in the ice" Steve winced as a sharp pain took place in his lower stomach. He rubbed the spot and after a few seconds the pain went away. He had had pains all night, but they weren't strong so he ignored it. But now it seemed to be getting more intense. Was this a sign of labour? He knew it could happen at any time, but the thought that it would actually happen was surreal. He kept quiet though, not wanting to over react in case it was nothing. That didn't last long though, as the time went on and the pains became even worse.
“Steve, we all agree this isn’t normal for you. Maybe you should take up T’Challa’s advice and go see one of his doctors” Steve sighed a protest already forming on his lips, but he knew he should go. After the serum he thought he’d seen the last of doctors, and he was happy about that. Most of his childhood was spent with a doctor and he would be happy to never see one again. In one month alone he’d seen more doctors then most people would see in their entire lives.
“You really don’t have to concern yourself with it. You’re here enjoying your time away from meetings, you don’t need to get involved in this one” he brought Tony’s plate over to him, before turning back to start his own, but he was stopped by a hand on his wrist, forcing him back around.
So I don't think I'm going to add Bucky. I don't know, I think the story would work better if the Winter Soldier didn't exist. Unless someone has a cool way I could add him in. I'm open to suggestions
"Do you feel sorry about anything that happened regarding the accords and other events that took place?" Tony looked at him confused for a second, before slowly taking his hand off Steve's shoulder.
"Oh god" Steve said louder as he continued to think and let the memories continue to overflow. Steve thought his life sucked, having to hide and being a wanted criminal, and it did, but what did Tony have? Sure Tony was a free man but he was alone. He had Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy but no one else. Steve had taken all of them with him. Steve's life had gone up once he had the kids, but Tony's had only gone down.
"Not much to see outside the tower. No one to go and visit" Steve closed his eyes as he gripped the knife tighter in his hands, and he felt it start to bend. Biting his lip so he wouldn't cry out he took a few seconds to compose himself.
"Brat won't sit still" Steve told her, and she gently pushed him out of the way to do it herself. James cooed as her hair dangled in his face, and he gently tugged on it. She had dyed it orange to hide her identity, and Steve liked it. It seemed to give her more life and colour in her skin and face. Smiling, Steve picked up Maria and waited for Wanda to finish.
"I'm going to put the kids to bed. You want to join Tony?" Steve asked. It was pointless to ask, because Steve knew Tony wanted too, but he wouldn't do it without Steve making the first move. After dinner they had all moved to the living room to watch some tv for a bit. It was nearing nine and way past the twins bedtime but all the sugar they had consumed had kept them awake. Finally they had passed out on the floor cuddled up to one another.
"Well, you could definitely do with some improvement" they both chuckled, and Steve backed out of the room so Tony could shut the door.
"You called back" Steve couldn't keep the amazement out of his voice, truly believing that Tony was done with him.
"I should have told you about the kids" this conversation wasn't going to get better, so he may as well just go all out now. "But I wasn't going to take the chance that you could take them from me, or that we could be tracked. We're very lucky to be here in Wakanda, but even this place isn't impenetrable. I just, I need them safe and I need them with me" because I will loose my mind. Did he have anything else he needed to apologize for? He didn't think so.
"It was always what we talked about. I pick one, you pick one. Didn't seem right to change that. Nat's Maria's godmother, and Sam is James godfather. I figured you would name Rhodey and  Pepper as the other two" he really didn't want to stare at Tony the entire time he spoke, but he found that he couldn't look away. The way his eyes grew slightly damp as Steve spoke was captivating.
"I saw a news report on you" Steve answered honestly, spinning the kitchen knife in his hand to give him something to focus on, lunch laying forgotten on the counter.
"Yes Vis, it is just a joke" Wanda told him. Maria clapped her hands together at the adults antics, and Steve cooed at her.
"Are you ready to find out the gender of the baby?" what a stupid question, Steve thought but would never voice. Of course he was thrilled to learn if there would be a baby girl or boy running around, how could he not be? He wasn't sure which one he would prefer; a boy or a girl although a boy might be easier. He hadn't grown up around girls, and the two girls he did know both had terrible childhoods so they probably wouldn't be of much help.
So I found a way to include Bucky in this story. Poor Steve, he's really going through some shit. I wish I could say it gets happier from here, but...
"But we could avoid those disastrous mistakes if we had control. We can't just show up to a country when we think they need us. We have to wait for them to call on us" Tony argued back, tightening his grip on the edge of the table.
"When I'm finished eating I can watch over the kids, allow you to actually eat something while it’s hot" Nat told him, and he quirked an eyebrow. Usually it went unsaid that that's what they were going to do. She curled her lips upwards, and that's when he realized what she was doing. She was trying to bait Tony, and as always it worked.
"Throughout the night I woke up from some pain, but I thought it was the babies kicking and moving around. And this morning it's been happening" Steve winced as he was laid down on a bed. Adia put on some gloves and checked to see how dilated he was, Bucky looking away as she did a faint blush on his cheek.
"There's nothing down my hallway. Nat?" Clint asked in his comm, but he paid it little attention. There was a bomb, with who knew how much power. It could be as simple as just blowing up the room, or it could destroy the entire building. Maybe even reach Bruce who was sitting on a rock. Everyone was unaware of the danger they were now in.
"I believe he is. I think he's coming with Stark" Wanda no longer spat out Stark, but it was clear there wouldn't be a hugging reunion between the two anytime soon.
Thanks to everyone for the reviews:) I didn't want to post the last chapter without posting this one, because no one likes a cliff hanger, so here you guys go. Enjoy
thinking about our kids. It’s why I’m not going to do anything stupid”, reckless maybe, but Tony didn’t need to know that, “but five men have been killed simply because they look like me. I can’t let them die Tony, I just can’t. These men have families, friends, lovers, maybe even kids of their own. They’ll never go home to them again, all because of me” he had already been lectured over how stupid this could turn out to be, and he didn’t need another one. This was something he had to do, and yes, it sucks because he has people he needs to live for, but so did those men. At least he can defend themselves, they can’t.
So the babies are here! I know nothing about labour and pregnancy so if any of that seemed unrealistic, apologizes. I know it seems kind of quick, fourth chapter and the babies are already here but this story was never supposed to be focused so much on Steve's pregnancy, it's meant to be focused on life after and how Tony and Steve find each other again. And we see that Tony isn't doing so great. They will reunite soon, but they've still got a long ways to go before they find their happy ending
After getting out of bed, and going to the bathroom, Steve went to the kids room, knowing they would be awake.
"Babies are coming" Steve panted as another pain went through him and Adia joined him on his other side.
"Like you said, I'm not going to apologize for the accords. I stood on the side I felt was right. But I can say I am sorry for how everything turned out. I never wanted you to become criminals. I never wanted you to have to go to the raft, which I can tell you I am strongly against that part I saw how awful it was, and I am sorry you can't come home" it took Tony another moment, like he was arguing in his head over something, before he continued.
"So maybe my subconscious pulled my hits" Steve shrugged, because he was not a good guy in this situation. Why couldn't Nat see that? She groaned in frustration.
”You good? You look a little flushed” the question seemed innocent enough, Steve even did the puppy dog head tilt and wide eyed expression but he couldn’t stop the way his lips slightly curled upwards. Whoever said Steve was a nice man who would never dare tease someone had clearly never met him.
Steve wondered if maybe their relationship was like his and Tony's. They didn't like each other when they first met, and they annoyed the hell out of one another but look at what happened. They ended up getting married. Steve laughed. The thought of Sam and Bucky getting married seemed impossible.
"If I truly believed in the side Clint was on, absolutely. Or if Clint ever asked me to have his back, as long as it didn't include taking over the world or seeing how many magnets we could stick to Barnes arm before he noticed, I would even if Bruce was on the other side. Because that's what best friends do for each other. Clint is my Bucky, and Bucky is Tony's Rhodey" the answer was zero by the way. Because as soon as Clint picked up the magnet, Bucky was on to him.
"Sure, give me the devil child while you keep the good one" and it was true, James was patiently waiting to be fed while Maria just helped herself.
why hadn't Tony apologized for anything? Steve genuinely thought that Tony had nothing to apologize for. Steve was so used to being selfless, and taking the blame for someone else he hadn't realized that he was covering up the truth. And the truth was he wasn't the only one who should be sorry. Why wasn't Tony also apologizing?
Putting Maria down Steve decided to make some lunch. He turned on the tv, and Dora came on the screen. It was an older show but both kids were fascinated with it. Steve hated it. Seeing both kids content he went into the kitchen. When T'Challa designed the house he made it so that there was a window between the kitchen and living room so while Steve was at the stove he could still keep an eye on them. Deciding to just cut up some fruits and veggies for the kids he went about the kitchen getting plenty for them to eat. Steve hadn't noticed if they had inherited anything from the serum, like fast metabolism but they did eat a lot. When they were older maybe he would have some tests run to see if they had anything else.
"As much as I hate to acknowledge it, I know H.Y.D.R.A best. They killed this man for one of two reasons; he knew something that he shouldn't, or they needed to fix a mistake. H.Y.D.R.A doesn't just kill for no reason. As sick as those bastards are, they are smart. It's how they remained in S.H.I.E.L.D undetected for so long. They don't just start killing because that draws attention. And this man couldn't be important, because we, they. They would have taken him and done terrible things to him" Bucky spoke, faltering only once when he referred to H.Y.D.R.A as we. Sam rest his hand on Bucky's metal arm, which meant so much more then just a comfort thing. It showed that Sam knew of his past, and yet didn't care. He was willing to touch the arm most people flinched from, especially when it was on display like this. And that's what Bucky needed.
"Why'd you call Rogers?" and why did Steve call? He hadn't though about what to say. It was a spur of the moment kind of thing, he saw Tony in trouble and he reacted. But what was he supposed to say
"You don't have to apologize for what side you chose to fight on. I said that already. It's what makes us humans, and not mindless drones. We get to make decisions and fight for what we believe in. Am I sorry we ended up on different sides? Absolutely, I wished I could have been by your side. But I can't change who I am. And I'm sorry for not telling you about your mom. Even though I wasn't completely sure it was Bucky, I should have still told you about it. I thought I was protecting you. You thought she died from a car accident, I thought that would be better for you to believe then she had been murdered. It's what I would have wanted, but I should never have assumed it is what you wanted. It wasn't my decision to make. But I am asking you, do you feel sorry for anything?" he held his breath, waiting for Tony to answer, hoping his ex wasn't about to storm out the door and drag Rhodey out of here. He wouldn't stop him if that's what he did, but he wouldn't let him back in.
The table grew quiet again so Steve busied himself with feeding the twins. They were good at eating solid food with their hands, but they both liked to jam the food in their mouths instead of taking bites, especially if it was one of their favourites which grilled cheese was. If Steve really wanted to he could probably focus on his own food, but he didn’t want to chance it. Especially because he was witnessing James about to shove the entire square in his mouth.
"Doesn't every human have a heart?" Vision asked in confusion, looking around like how Steve usually does, waiting for someone to explain.
"Did you want to eat together?" Steve blurted out before he could think it through, but he was tired of walking on egg shells. He may as well just go for it, or hold his tongue. Tony looked shocked at the question, and Steve thought he would decline but he didn't.
"Bucky is bound to get with Sam before easter, so it wouldn't make sense to name both Sam and Bucky as godparents" Nat jumped in, coming up with a better excuse than Steve could have. Poor Maria. With a Stark as a parent and a deadly spy who also liked to put people in awkward situations, the girl was bound to be snarky as hell. Scratch that. Not poor Maria. Poor world.
Sorry for the wait, I just started my first year at college so chapters may be slower. I'll try and upload once a week
Two years. It had been almost two years since the Civil War, and almost one year since the twins had been born. Everyday they did something new that made Steve's heart burst. They were starting to figure out how to walk. Both could stand up for a few seconds and sometimes they'd be able to take one step before falling down. James could say 'Dada' while Maria was still content to make gurgling sounds and clap her hands when she wanted Steve's attention. And they were the perfect blend between Tony and himself. Maria had blonde curls on top of her head and big brown eyes. She had also gotten Tony's mischievous smile, that even at almost a year old she had mastered perfectly. She would be a little terror when she got older Steve could already tell, not that she wasn't one already. James had brown hair that liked to stick up most of the time and clear blue eyes. He had Steve's look of innocence, and Steve knew Maria would drag him into trouble, and James would always follow. The curse of being a James. Maria preferred to make messes with some home made baby paint, and James preferred to make things with his building blocks. The two of them were the perfect mix of Tony and Steve. They were simply perfect.
"Don't view this as a punishment from god because of what you did. View it as a gift" she stood from the table and squeezed his shoulder before she left, leaving the bowl of pasta in front of him. This was her way of making him choose. She wouldn't force him to eat if he didn't want to, but if he didn't then that would be his answer on if he would abort the baby.
"Seriously Barnes, were you raised in a barn?" Sam said in a voice most would think was gruff but everyone who knew Sam knew he was only joking. Bucky looked up innocently from where he was practically inhaling his second hotdog, the first one have disappeared before he put his plate back down.
"Steve, listen to me. I know this baby is like a slap in the face to you. You've lost your husband, your home, and your identity-"
"How many times do I have to tell you Barnes that you are wrong before you get it through your thick skull?" he heard Sam snap from inside the kitchen and Steve fondly rolled his eyes. Despite the negative attitude the two portrayed towards each other he could see how much they cared about one another. If Bucky was up all night with nightmares, Sam would sit on the couch with him and watch tv. He claimed it was because his military hours had programmed him that way, but everyone knew the truth. And if Sam overworked himself in the gym trying to keep up with two super soldiers Bucky would help drag Sam out of the room and to the couch. He'd insult the man all the way there, but the playful look in his eyes told he wasn't serious. It was nice to see Bucky warming to someone who wasn't himself.
"I'd hoped this wouldn't happen" Steve sighed, walking over to 'save' Tony. He gently peeled James fingers away, and laid his hand down, the boy already passed out again.
"Look, I didn't call you here to fight. And I know I do have some things to apologize for, so let's move on to that because we're getting nowhere right now. We'll never agree on the accords. I am sorry for not telling you about your parents. The second I had my suspicions I should have told you. But I thought, if I ignored it pretended I didn't see it then it wasn't real. That Bucky had nothing to do with it. But you're right, I should have told you.  You have to understand though, it wasn't him Tony. I mean, yes it was him that killed Howard and your mom, but it wasn't mentally him. There's these trigger words, that if they are said to him he's just a puppet waiting for someone to control him. He's getting better, he still has his moments but he's in there and I can't give up on him" and no matter what happened with Bucky, Steve would have his back because it was the two of them till the end of the line.
"Of course, how silly of me to think otherwise. So this is where you guys have been hiding? Kitty cat had a change of heart and decided to take you guys in?" Tony continued to pry, not hiding the bitterness in his voice.
"Wanda Maximoff when I look at you I do not see a threat. I see a young girl who had her whole life turned around. Manipulated into siding with the bad guys because you thought they were good and having tests done on you which couldn't have been painless. Ya, you got into our heads and messed with our minds. And were we mad about it? At first, yes. But you saw the man who you believed was responsible for your parents deaths, and you acted out of anger. You acted how most humans would have acted. But then, you joined the right side. You didn't know us, but you knew it was the right thing to do. To help those civilians. And the accords? Those were not your fault. Everyone will always look at the negative instead of the positive. And you just happened to be the one to get the blame" Wanda was back to crying, and Steve wasn't sure if that was good or not. But she wasn't yelling at him which was good. Steve would need to get better at comforting women if he wanted to be there for his daughter.
"I just had to call you" was all Steve said, and that was the truth. He had to call Tony. He didn't realize how much he needed to. He should have called two years ago, but at least he's doing it now. He didn't realize something could hurt you so much but also make you incredibly happy, but that's what Tony's voice was doing to him.
"The vanilla boys will not be associated with you chocolate devils" Steve teased and took a bite for himself. Tony looked teasingly appalled and fired back quickly.
“Looks like your rash has gotten better” Steve told James happily, as if he could understand. The past few days James had been battling a harsh diaper rash, that had left the boy crying in pain when it first started. Thankfully, T’Challa had the best rash cream ever brought in just for James. And if he did have a part of Steve’s healing factor, that would help as well.
“Tony, you’re a distraction, and I can’t have you there” as soon as the words left his mouth, Steve knew he should have worded them differently. The way he said it made him sound like an asshole, like Tony was a liability.
"Not that early? Sometimes I don't even go to bed until then" Steve led him out of the room and to the room he could sleep in.
"Beg your pardon?" Tony asked, wondering if he had heard her right. Replacement was actually saving their lives?
"Happy Birthday to you" the lights dimmed down as the biggest cake Steve had ever seen rolled out of the kitchen. It was a three tier cake, half pink and half blue and had one giant candle on top in the shape of a one.
"So they have the serum?" Tony asked, the scientist in him coming out. Steve could tell he was itching to take down notes, maybe perform a few tests to see what all they were capable of.
”No James” he sighed pulling the grilled cheese away from his mouth. He looked at Steve betrayed, blue eyes already starting to water and lip trembling so Steve hurried to give the food back to him after he ripped the grilled cheese with his fingers into an even smaller piece.
"I know, your daddy and godfather are silly" he laughed with her and looked back up when it got quiet very fast. Everyone was starring at him, Rhodey and Tony looking at him shocked. Replaying his sentence in his head, he realized his mistake.
"Cake will be served in a bit. After cake, we will do presents" T'Challa told everyone, and Shuri chimed in from beside him.
The two weeks seemed to fly by. Steve had texted Tony random pictures of the kids when he could, and Tony would save all of them but that was about the extent to their communications. Even though Tony knew about the kids now, it seemed to change nothing between them. But that was all about to change because today was the day Tony would be arriving. He had decided to just show up the day of the party, and Steve guessed he was limiting his time. He hadn't told him who he would be bringing, but Steve had a pretty good guess that he would be bringing the whole crew.
"If you want you can feed Maria small bites. She really likes sugary things, so she'll probably enjoy the icing" Steve told him already feeding James a small bite, and Tony nodded.
"No, I'm not. Since I got the serum people have been trying to capture me to either drain me of my blood or recreate the serum. I can defend myself. They can't" Steve wasn't sure what he would do if anything happened to his kids. Avengers never killed, they beat the enemy down until they couldn't move, and threw them in a cell where they would never be released. However, if anything happened to put his children in danger, he wouldn't hesitate to break the unsaid code.
“You in there punk?” Bucky snapped him out of his thoughts by gently knocking his knuckles on the side of his head, and Steve offered him back a forced smile. He was becoming a pro of the fake smile and laughs.
"You wish princess" Nakia teased, and that got everyone to ease up and start socializing. All except for Steve, and he could guess Tony wasn't comfortable either. Wanda set James down on the floor, and he cutely fell on his bum straight away before crawling away.
"Talk to Steve, and then lets go" she told him, and he nodded. So, they weren't planning on staying. Probably for the best.
"After your mother. You always said that's what you wanted the girls name to be" Tony went quiet again so Steve decided to keep talking. "They don't look like twins, but they do look like a mix of us. James is older by eighteen minutes. He has your brown hair, but my blue eyes. He likes to build things and take things apart, but he's got my shyer personality, and a more innocent look in his eyes. Maria has my blonde hair, but your brown eyes. She likes to paint things and make messes, but she's got your devilish personality. Even mastered your smirk at only a year old. They are both a handful, but I wouldn't trade them for anything. I could send you pictures after this, if you'd like" Steve offered, knowing Tony would want some.
“Language” Steve responded, voice quiet but teasing. Tony fondly rolled his eyes at the memory, but his gaze turned sharp shortly after.
“I get I’m not a supersoldier, or a spy, or an assassin, but I’m not a liability! Is that what you think, that I’m so weak you’ll be distracted trying to keep me safe? Or are you going to be so busy looking over your shoulder, making sure
“Don’t. Don’t even finish that sentence. You are nothing like either of our fathers, and you never will be” Steve stared into Tony’s eyes, and slowly found himself nodding. If Tony said so, then it must be so.
"Ya they are" Steve couldn't believe it. They were originally in his stomach and now here they were. He had done it.
“Brats” Steve smiled fondly, but left them to their devices. They were content, that’s all that mattered.
"You said Tony took the first shot. Did he apologize for that?" Steve slowly shook his head, and she kept going. "Steve I've seen you break open a punching bag after one hit. And the bag was supposed to be indestructible"
“Alright, I will ask you a few questions, take some blood, maybe a urine sample, and then you’ll be good to go” Steve nodded. Despite the time change this was the same thing that happened before the serum.
"People forget that even though we are advanced, we are human. We make mistakes, and ya when we do there can be more disastrous consequences than a regular person" and that was the truth. They were humans, and all humans made mistakes. He may be a super soldier but that doesn't make him flawless.
"Steve please tell me he apologized. Please don't tell me you sat there and took everything, apologized for your stuff, but didn't get an apology back" Steve cocked his head confused. What did Tony have to apologize for? Steve was the one who went against his husband, lied to him, and almost killed him in the base. Nat didn't make any sense. She sighed exasperated and led him over to a window sill they could sit in. The view always took Steve's breath away with the beauty of Wakanda, and his fingers itched to grab his sketchpad and draw it.
"Oh god" Steve breathed tears welling in his eyes as he realized. He had caused this. He had broken Tony down, something he swore he would never do. That was literally something in his wedding vows, when they were starring at each other. They both wrote their own, and one of Steve's lines were
"We'll keep you posted" Steve smiled at Bruce. The man squinted his eyes, like he couldn't understand why Steve was talking to him, but slowly he nodded his head.
"Steve, did you have stuff to apologize for? Yes. But you aren't the only one who has too. I've seen you beat yourself up for two years over everything, so I know you genuinely feel sorry" she tried to explain but Steve shook his head at her.
"I'm sorry, that wasn't that funny" he apologized, but Tony cut him off with a chuckle that sent chills throughout him.
Those stupid accords had ruined everything. While Tony didn't agree with everything on the accords he did agree they were necessary. And even if he didn't agree what could he do? He couldn't run away or go against them like the others. Unlike the others he had responsibilities outside of being a hero. He had an industry to run, if he left who knew what would happen. Another Stane incident probably.
"Oh, I mean, I-we hadn't really thought about it. We could sleep in the palace if it was better, not that the palace is a better place, it's just-" and Steve should not have felt as much pride as he did over the fact he could make the always talking Tony Stark speechless.
Ya, he'd definitely have an entire building collapse on him if it meant he could be closer to his family.
"Language" Tony winked and left. And in that moment Steve knew that no matter what the future held, no matter what happened now, they'd be ok.
“She uh, she really seems close to the kids” Tony said, keeping his gaze centered on James and not on Steve.
There had to be cameras set up in this base. Too small to be noticeable, but with enough power to record everything. However, he couldn't concern himself with looking around for them. He went into the corner of the room where there was a blanket overtop of something. It was old and ripped, something he would have seen in his or Bucky's home growing up. Anything could be under it, he had to be careful. Slowly, he lifted the blanket, careful to lift it straight up into the air.
"Then you must hate me all the time. Listen Tony. I'm tired of seeing you drink every night. I'm tired of running this company by myself because you can't be bothered anymore. I'm tired of seeing you heartbroken. I'm just tired. So, either call Steve back or don't. Either way, work yourself out Tony. I love you" and with that, the fearsome Pepper Potts hung up the phone, leaving Tony in silence with only his thoughts.
"A little" Tony answered honestly, and Steve took a seat on the floor knowing this was going to be a long conversation, and he wanted to at least be comfortable physically because verbally he may not be.
"If anyone of us actually viewed you as a threat do you think we would keep you around? Hell, Clint introduced you to his kids after a month of knowing you because he trusts you that much. We met his kids when we met you for the first time, aside from Nat. You're a good kid, and I hope that my daughter will grow up to be like you" Wanda let out a sob as he spoke, but he wasn't finished just yet. Looking Wanda in the eyes he delivered his final line.
"Не обещаю" (No promises) he told her back and she chuckled, before leading them out of the room leaving only Tony and him. He sat down knowing this was going to be a long, and angry conversation.
“It’s open” he called, voice a little shaky as he tried to calm himself down. Tony walked in, and immediately sat down on the bed beside him, not bothering to tiptoe around him.
“Sure, you can do it” he smiled at Tony, who smiled almost shyly back which was unusual because Tony Stark did not do shy. It was adorable to see though.
"I've been decent. I'm taking care of myself. Some days I don't feel like rolling out of bed, but they make it worth it" he admitted honestly because some days he really didn't feel like getting up. He just wanted to lie in bed and cry, or pretend for a little while he didn't exist anymore. But then the kids would need him, and he'd be fine for a while. "What about you?"
"Four minutes and twenty three seconds" Natasha answered flipping to the next page of her book never lifting her eyes.
Tony's heartbroken cry as Steve hit him for the first time, and Steve wanting to throw up as he realized what he had just done.
"Aw, don't we get to hear the juicy gossip?" Tony whined, scowling when Rhodey hit him in the back of the head. "What? I like knowing things"
"Poor baby" Tony teased, gently feeding her some cake. Maria's eyes widened adorably at the flavour, and opened her mouth for another which Tony very happily gave her.
Well, apparently someday had arrived. And Tony wasn't with him. He supposes he should somehow tell Tony he's pregnant, but that thought quickly leaves his mind. He could not, under any circumstances, tell Tony about this baby. Tony could take it from him; he was a wanted criminal in the eyes of the law. Even though he was Captain America and had saved their asses numerous times, he had no rights and the baby would be taken from him. No, he couldn't risk losing the baby also. Then he would have nothing. It was almost selfish of him, but that was the thought that made up his mind. With this kid, he'd never be alone and he'd always have a part of Tony with him still.
All Sam had to do was grow a pair and actually talk to Bucky about how he was feeling and maybe they could-
"I was angry. At the fact that Barnes had killed my mother, but also at the fact that my husband wasn't by my side. We fought wars together side by side, but when I really needed you by my side, you weren't there. Seeing you leave with Barnes, was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever watched. There I was laying on the floor, and there you went walking away" Tony stopped, like he was trying to find the words to say, and Steve wondered if he would apologize or not.
But there was still the accords problem. They would never agree on the accords. Steve would never sign them, and no matter how much he loved Tony, Tony would never change his mind on it. How would he tell Tony about the kids? If anyone ever found out that Tony had one year old kids it would be very obvious on who's kids they were. Everyone knew Tony loved Steve and would never have cheated. If anyone ever found out about the kids, it was only a matter of time before General Ross caught wind of it, and then they'd probably be able to find him and everyone else. Bucky. No matter what happened the government would never let Bucky be a free man. Was it really worth everything to tell Tony?
“Tony, it’s seven thirty, this is not breakfast talk” Steve sighed uselessly, knowing he was fighting a losing battle. When Tony gave him that concerned look he found himself caving.
“Oh Punk” Bucky sighed as he took in the sight of his best friend, crumpled to the floor on his knees a shaky and sweaty mess.
"Or if Rhodey ever got captured while he was in the military and he became a different man, would you turn your back on him? After Afghanistan, if they had broken you and made you like Bucky do you think any of us would have left you? No right. Well, that's how Steve is feeling" Tony sighed as it all sunk in. It didn't make it right, what Steve had done, but he was starting to get it.
"Bad Maria" Steve scolded her like she was a dog, and she pout up at him before Steve heard her tummy grumble. So that's why she was acting up. She was hungry and wanted lunch, and Steve had forgotten to get it for her so she wanted his attention. She couldn't just cry like a normal child? Rushing to the kitchen Steve grabbed the two plates and put them in front of the two kids, letting them eat in the living room for once because he had to finish his talk with Tony.
His phone buzzed in his pocket, and he took it out. He had learned fairly quickly that when it buzzed he was meant to take it out. Plus, it was good for them to think he had become a meek shell of himself, instead of secretly plotting.
"Steve should stay here. He leaves and it's only a matter of time before they find him" Sam said as if Steve wasn't standing shoulder to shoulder with him.
I am so sorry for the wait. Thank you to everyone who messaged asking me to continue, you motivate me to keep going. Enjoy the chapter:)
"You're supposed to sit here and be a father" Bucky told him, giving him that look he used to give when he knew Steve was thinking something stupid.
"I just, I don't know what to do, you know? Obviously I don't want to stay in Wakanda forever, or keep them hidden from the world, but I don't see any other choice. I want them to have a normal childhood, but I don't think that they can" Steve turned his attention back to his son, and stroked his cheek. Why did he ever think the kids would have a normal and happy life?
"Fuck" Bucky muttered, and really that's exactly how everyone felt. H.Y.D.R.A would never stop looking, it was only a matter of time before they realized where he was. And until they found him, more people would die.
"One of the things I've picked up on. Not fluent, but I know enough. But that's not what you really want to talk about, is it?" Tony let out a humorless chuckle.
I am so sorry for the long wait. But here is a brand new chapter, that I hope you all enjoy. Happy New Years to everyone, stay safe and have fun
“I was going to defend the mixing up of the clothes, but Steve, how do you pair pink and blue items? How did you not realize?” Tony laughed, following Steve out of the room, who was leading them to the kitchen.
"Tony?" Pepper never answered the phone in her usual playful tone anymore, always sounding like she was walking on eggshells. Ever since the accords she had become more worried about Tony then she already was, and couldn't find it in herself to get mad at him for anything anymore.
"Try not to play with their minds" Tony spat at Wanda, who's eyes flashed red at the implication that she would hurt either of the two.
"The child is already doomed if that's the case" Bucky said and Sam kicked him under the table, which resulted in Bucky throwing a fry at his face. While they were having their mini fight and while Nat was looking over the picture, Steve snuck out.
"Steve?" It was Pepper that spoke, her voice unusually quiet and not at all like the fierce Pepper Potts, CEO of Stark industries. Steve blinked his eyes a few times, to snap himself out of his horrid memories. He hadn't realized his eyes had started to fill with tears. Pepper was looking at him with concern, and while Rhodey and Happy tried to look indifferent he could see the hidden worry. And Tony, Tony was just starring. If Steve didn't know Tony like the back of his hand he would say he didn't care. But Steve did know Tony, even after two years, and he could tell the man was worried. And seeing Tony's worry, over the memories Steve just had, made him want to run back to his cabin and curl under the blankets and never leave again. Because Steve didn't deserve it.
He just wished that others had taken his side. That they would have listened to him. That his husband hadn't run away with the man who killed his parents. All he had left on his team was a kid, and someone who was forced to stay by his side because that was one of the rules of being best friends. And of course, he had his many bottles of alcohol.
"Does that really change anything though?" and he knew that her word wasn't the gospel, but if she said yes then he'd take it. She stood up, pat his arm, and left without answering leaving him to find his own answer.
Thor followed Tony's command, and together they put down the ceiling. Tony grabbed his wrist and dragged him out of the room Thor following close behind, just moments before the wall he had been beside collapsed right where he had been standing.
The others had been great throughout the entire thing. After getting it through everyone's heads that they were all good enough to be around his children they had all become more comfortable. Wanda took him to every doctors appointment he had and would follow him around everywhere in case he needed help, Nat watched birthing videos with him and taught him how to change a diaper having done it with Clint's kids, Sam took him for walks around the palace when he grew bored, and late at night Bucky would sit with him and offer comfort. Even T'Challa and Shuri had become involved. Shuri made things that Steve would need, and T'Challa had surprised him with a house he had built in the forest surrounding Wakanda. It would offer the family privacy to be by themselves when they wanted it but also keep them safe within the Wakandan borders. Until the babies were born and a little bit older they would stay in the palace though, close to doctors. Even Clint and Scott had sent him letters to congratulate (Steve didn't know how the letters got to Wakanda, but T'Challa assured him it was safe), and that the second they could they wanted to meet them. Clint was more because Steve was family and Scott was because he wanted to meet the Captain America's children. Fanboying like never before would take place.
"I'm here" Steve whispered, all previous thoughts flying out the window. Normally he would joke and say language, but this wasn't normal. Steve didn't know what this was. They sat in silence for a few minutes, both just listening to the other breath before Tony broke it, unable to take the silence.
“It’s risky. If you catch them off guard you have the upper hand. But, you don’t know what every H.Y.D.R.A agent looks like, and every H.Y.D.R.A agent knows what you look like. Most likely they’ll attack first, giving them the upper hand” Tony didn’t like it. This plan was to risky, to many mistakes could happen. And H.Y.D.R.A would capitalize on any mistake they could. Give them an opening, they take the shot.
Fury had assigned them on another mission that he thought would lead them closer to Steve's death. It seemed to be the only missions the team had been accepting lately, and Steve had to go along with their plans, with his mouth shut. It should have been a simple in and out mission. Obviously the base they were checking out wasn't involved with his death, it wasn't even a H.Y.D.R.A base.
"I'm a criminal because of those accords. You could do whatever you wanted and I probably wouldn't get a say"
looking at his kids Steve knew everything was about to change for all of them, because his mind was made up. Grabbing the cell phone from the kitchen drawer with nothing else in it, he dialed the only number on the phone hoping Tony would answer.
"Nice job" Nat said, which also meant 'thank you'. He had gotten good at reading the Black Widow's hidden meanings.
"I mean really Pep, how could he not tell me? All we've ever wanted was to start a family, and yet when we do he doesn't tell me. That's not how relationships work" he was just rambling now, saying things that didn't make sense, because he and Steve weren't in a relationship, but still. They could be. Not knowing what else to do he threw the bottle of whiskey, and watched it shatter into a thousand little pieces.
"Hey, none of that. That's not the Cap I know. I get it, this isn't an ideal situation, but we are going to figure something out. I'm not going to turn my back and make you deal with this on your own. I may have just entered their life today, but I feel so protective over them. I can't and I won't abandon them. Or you" as much as Steve wanted to revel in this progress, the tingly sensation flowing through his veins at Tony's words, he couldn't let it continue without knowing.
Steve hadn't seen Tony since they talked, which was only two hours ago but with how giddy he felt, it felt like a life time. He had run, literally run home, after sitting in the party room for a half hour thinking to himself. He just couldn't believe that Tony was staying! Would Tony want to stay in his house with him? Would it be too bold of Steve to ask? But right now none of that mattered. What mattered was what T'Challa was saying. Wanda had volunteered to stay behind and watch the kids with Vision, as long as she was informed straight away as to what was said. Steve and the other three were down in the lab watching Shuri pull up a picture to show them.
"Not to rough Maria" Steve scolded gently, and he could feel Tony lift his gaze to him, but Steve turned his attention to James who was squirming impatiently.
"Ten toes, ten fingers, two eyes, one nose. They're perfect" Adia said as she put a blanket over Steve.
"No matter what happens today, you remember you are a good person. And if Tony says anything to you, you can be damn sure I'll be stepping in" Wanda shot him an appreciative smile as he said that, and he returned it. Lifting James up Wanda rested him on her hip and faced Steve.
"We had a suspicion from the picture" T'Challa worded slowly and carefully, choosing his words. "None of these men that we are about to show have been confirmed to be killed by H.Y.D.R.A soldiers, but they were all American's killed in foreign countries from a gunshot wound to the head. Notice anything about these pictures?" four pictures popped up. At first glance you would think that these men looked nothing alike. Two had brown hair, one light red, and another blonde. But the closer Steve looked the more he saw. All the men had blue eyes. All had a short hairstyle. All of them had wide shoulders. All had white skin. All were in their twenty's.
"That's sad and all, but why does this matter to us?" Sam asked, crossing his arms and raising his eyebrows. Good, Steve wasn't the only one who couldn't piece it together. He hated feeling like a moron, it usually reminded him of how uncultured he was in this century. Shuri and her brother shared a look that made Steve huff in annoyance over being left out.
"We will get him out, you just focus on getting yourselves to safety" Thor told them as he moved into the room, coming to stand as close to Steve as possible. "Are you alright Nomad?" and he couldn't help but to snort.
"As a matter of fact, I do think he loves you. I remember him dragging your ass out of the lab when you were passed out drunk. I remember him patching up all of your wounds when you got hurt during a mission, because you refused to see a doctor. I remember him bringing you a coffee every morning, and bringing you meals so you would eat. Hell, I remember him punching Justin Hammer in the face after the man insulted you. And that's all before you two were dating! And yes, he tried to break your reactor which I will slap him for the next time I see him. But Tony, you know Steve. You know that wasn't him at all" damn it, she did have a point.
“It’s the only plan. I can’t exactly post photos of me, the last thing I need is Ross figuring out where I am and what I look like, and sending his minions after me. Besides, I won’t be alone. I’ll have Nat, Bucky, and Sam”
"Are you guys planning on sleeping here?" Steve asked the pair, glad to be changing the subject. Tony lost his playful pout when he registered Steve's question.
“The serum,” he started, pulling out a tin of Altoids and handing it to Tony. “It, uh, it has a healing factor. I’ll be fine by this time tomorrow at the latest, but I think if we have any chance of getting back to the jet by sundown, I’m gonna need some patching up. The shoulder’s not too bad, but, God, my leg’s killing me—”
Tony hadn’t realized how close to Steve he’d gotten until he pulled away, reaching over to feel around in his nightstand, finally coming up with the sleek metal band he’d hidden in between the pages of an engineering journal. He hadn’t managed to find a box for it yet, and as he turned the ring over in his hand a couple times, the moonlight caught the silver, Steve’s gaze tracking it intently. Tony shifted into more of a sitting position, holding out the ring and willing his hand not to shake with nerves.
Tony had meant just to get a few digs in, but the more he thought about the drop in revenue in Oscorp’s last few quarters, the more it all started to make sense. Osborn had been neglecting his company in favour of secretly building the park — and probably expended most of the company’s money on it, too. What he needed was a dedicated investor — and who better to enlist than a charming, intelligent, established world-saving billionaire? It would be a two for the price of one kind of deal, snagging Tony for the position: it’d boost both Osborn’s funds and the park’s reputation.
“I have a couple PhDs under my belt too, y’know. Feel free to call me Doctor Stark,” he said, reveling in the way Osborn let out a long-suffering sigh at that. “Let me guess: you don’t want my scientific expertise. You want… business tips? Entrepreneurial advice? A signed copy of last month’s
“I love you,” Tony told him, like it was the easiest thing in the world. Maybe it was. He could say it a thousand times and the words wouldn’t be any less true by the end of it; for a second there, Tony actually considered doing just that, if only to prove it to Steve. “I know I don’t say it nearly as often as I should, but I love you more than I’ve ever loved anyone before. No one even comes close, baby. Except for Pepper and Rhodey, but I love them in an entirely different way, so it doesn’t really count.”
“Not exactly sure how much blood you lost on the way here,” Tony explained absently, pulling out some gauze from the tin and pressing it to Steve’s calf. “And, uh, this—” Tony gestured loosely, encompassing Steve’s leg “—is not really my area of expertise. Which is really unfortunate, because it looks like I’m going to have to give you stitches and you’ve got nothing in your handy-dandy kit here stronger than Advil.” He dug around a little more, single-handedly, coming up with a small flask marked ‘alcohol’ in Sharpie, and looked to Steve with a triumphant whoop. “Well, I stand corrected.”
talk, not if he wasn’t actually being asked anything. His urge to reveal every single thought and feeling was about as strong and relentless as a tidal pull, but if the other person was taking on the brunt of the conversation themselves, he could breeze through it without sharing anything he didn’t want to, so long as he was focused on biting his tongue.
, because he went on to say, “It’s not that I don’t believe in Thor or you or Bruce, it’s just that… It’s been almost a week, and nothing’s changed — and there’s a very real possibility that it might not, ever. I might be stuck like this. And I’ve been thinking about what that’ll mean. For the team. For us.”
. He knew he should’ve been more worried about the whole thing — about what he would do if a supervillain broke in and demanded that he give step-by-step instructions on how to build a Jericho missile, or if someone even jokingly asked for all the intelligence Tony may or may not have been privy to when he’d hacked into the Pentagon in high school.
“We, um, got split up,” Bruce said, his face falling into something somber, and Tony could read between the lines well enough, even if the kids couldn’t. “I couldn’t find them again.”
kind of situation on their hands, even though it had been pretty touch and go up until this point, Tony just said, “I was ready two days ago. Let’s get this show on the road.”
Steve, despite the shape he was in, was alight with amusement, biting down on his lip to keep from laughing. Tony couldn’t even be all that mad; happy was a good look on Steve. “Same stuff keeping those towelettes moist.”
Tony eased everything out of Steve’s hands and set it down on the ground with a clatter. “Okay, listen, there is not a chance in hell I’m letting you walk all the way to the quinjet while you’re bleeding out—”
Steve shook his head, although Tony couldn’t quite tell if it was out of humility or insecurity. “I’m not—”
In all honesty, Tony had forgotten he’d even been wounded, so caught up in trying to make sure that Steve was okay, that he was safe. But now that it had been pointed out, it seemed to hit Tony all at once: the persistent sting of pain, the numbed ache around his side, the exhaustion of the last couple days.
He was so earnest that Tony couldn’t help but believe him, and one glance at the look on Steve’s face told Tony that he didn’t need any more of an explanation. There were few people on the planet who could understand what this was like without needing it to be put into words, and Steve, by some miracle, was one of them. It was easy with him, and Tony found himself truly relaxing—limbs loose, mind clear, heart steady—for the first time since he arrived on Isla Nublar.
Steve was back to murmuring soft assurances next to him, his hand moving up to card through Tony’s hair for a while before continuing to rub at his back again. It was nice to be held and touched and taken care of, especially after the last couple days of being so focused on looking after everyone else.
There was just something about Steve that made everything so easy. Sitting next to him, even this island was starting to become bearable.
There was a beat of silence before Steve spoke up again. “I was talking to Fury about this— oh, how did he put it? Some kind of task force, I think. Anyway, he, um. He let me read your file.” Another pause, as Steve collected his thoughts and Tony applied the last stitch, neatly tying off the suture. It wasn’t his best handiwork, but it was better than he thought he’d fare, and wasn’t too shabby, overall. “And, I don’t know. Meeting you in person, you’re— You’re not what I expected.”
Knowing Tony, he’s probably planned something elaborate, and the last thing Steve wants is for all that hard work to go to waste. Or, even worse, for his knowledge of the proposal to inadvertently deter Tony from attempting it at all. So, without a second thought, he closes the planner, shoves it under the couch cushions, and tries to seat himself in a way that says he’s just been relaxing for the past ten minutes.
“Right,” Tony replied dubiously. “Let’s see what we’re working with here before we make any definitive statements.” He rattled the tin of Altoids — or, uh, not-Altoids. “Alright, this isn’t something I usually say before paying for a drink, at the very least, but I’m gonna need you to drop your pants.”
“—to see you. Uh, Peter, Harry, why don’t you go take a walk while I talk to Doctor Banner for a second?” he suggested, and the boys slowly shuffled over to the edge of the clearing, hiding behind the thick trunk of a nearby tree. Bruce didn’t even spare them a glance. “Bruce? Hey, c’mon, I know you’re in there. It’s me, Tony. Even as Jolly Green, I’m sure you’ve heard of me. Three PhDs, invented a new element? Got captured by terrorists for three months? One of Forbes’ Forty Under Forty since I was twenty-two? There’s a lot of material to choose from, take your pick,” he said, hands out, placating.
Tony looked to Bruce, whose expression was probably a mirror of his own—wide-eyed, confused, wary—and even though they’d only known each other for about the span of five and a half hours now, they seemed to share the same thought.
Between the two of them, the baggie of granola didn’t last more than fifteen minutes; they passed it back and forth as they sat by the mouth of the cave and watched the sun sink below the horizon.
Tony tried to imagine he was repairing a circuit board instead, or doing minor upgrades in the delicate internal structure of the armour. He tried to imagine the white noise of the lab as he worked: the bots chirping as they offered him a tool, their soft whirring as they moved around. The clink of metal on metal, the squeak of Tony’s chair as he rolled from one workstation to another.
“Okay, uh, good morning to you too, I guess,” he interjected, glancing around, but they were the only ones out here. “Where’s Osborn?”
Breakfast went well, all things considered. Nothing tried to kill them. Or blow up the farm. Or rip open a hole in the fabric of space. The kids ate quickly and went off to play with Auntie Nat, and Laura wasn’t quiet in expressing her gratitude for the meal.
Steve’s suit was like Mary Poppins’ handbag. They’d hardly stepped into the mouth of the cave—small, empty, lit by the slowly setting sun in the distance—before he slumped against the nearest wall, unzipping pockets Tony hadn’t even noticed were there and triaging his injuries.
“Can’t be that stupid, if it’s making you so upset,” Tony says simply. “C’mon, tell me. What’s wrong?”
It was a little after midnight and there was just enough moonlight in the bedroom for Tony to avoid accidentally stubbing his toe on the corner of the footboard as he carefully approached the mattress. Steve was lying on his side, facing the window, the sheets rising and falling steadily with each breath, and it still startled Tony, seeing him like this, feeling knobby elbows and cold feet as he slipped into bed beside Steve, instead of firm muscle and an almost sweltering warmth. He was wearing one of Tony’s old MIT sweatshirts, pretty much swimming in the fabric, and when Tony tucked himself against his boyfriend, his chest pressing against the curve of Steve’s spine, his arm draped over Steve’s middle, he just felt so small, so fragile, in Tony’s hold.
When Steve finally pulled away enough to actually look Tony in the eyes, he expression was so somber, so serious, that Tony half-expected to hear that his medical conditions were catching up to him and he only had a week to live.
Tony poked his head back into the kitchen, doing his best to suppress a sigh. “Bruce, Pepper, and Rhodey are the only other people who know about that. But out of everyone, you’re the only one I don’t actually trust to keep a secret, so just—” Tony wagged a finger at him, trying to be as menacing as possible, under the circumstances “—do not say a single word about it to anybody, okay? Especially Steve. Otherwise I’m not gonna bankroll your trip to Disneyland for Cassie’s birthday.” It took less than a second before he was forced to concede, “Okay, that’s not true, but I am going to fly you in coach instead of first class.”
It took a second, but finally Steve’s eyes fluttered open, redder than they’d been a minute ago. His jaw was set, his mouth pressed into a frown, and it seemed a Herculean effort to swallow around the sudden lump in his throat.
“Hm? Oh, no.” Steve cleared his throat, some of the tension draining from his shoulders. “No, I’m good, just keep going.”
They ran through the dense jungle for a good ten minutes, through mud and muck and low-hanging branches, and then walked for another ten before Tony thought they were far enough from the T-Rex to stop for a moment and get their bearings.
. His mouth, however, had different ideas, and, like a marionette being controlled by a wicked puppeteer, he was helpless to reply, “I guess so.”
“Not particularly,” Tony said, muffled, from the little ball he’d curled himself into. He tried to focus on Steve’s touch, tried not to think about his nightmare or the tightness of his chest or the feeling of drowning. He was safe here. He was safe here, except for the velociraptors waiting outside to tear him apart, the T-Rex ready to eat him whole, and the hundreds of other creatures on this island that wanted a piece of him, and all of a sudden, Tony’s throat hitched around a hiccup and he couldn’t hold back anymore.
The look that crossed Steve’s face after he pulled away—something like shock, like confusion—would’ve been almost comical if it didn’t make Tony’s heart drop right into his stomach.
Even after all this time, the words never fail to make Steve’s stomach flutter, and he preens under the attention, stealing a kiss, a real one, before he lets Tony wander to the other side of the kitchen to rummage through the fridge.
“I’m not,” Tony rushed to assure, his mouth moving before his brain even had a chance to catch up. Once it did though, he realized he had no choice but to go through with this, extravagant proposal be damned — because, really, the only thing worse than a poorly planned proposal was taking back an accidental one. “I’ve been seriously considering this for… a couple months, at least.”
Even from a couple yards away, Tony could hear the fabric of the suit tearing, and he rushed forward as fast as he could — which, bogged down by the wetness of his jeans and the sinking of the sand under his shoes, felt impossibly slow.
“Your papers were long-winded and messy,” Tony told him, as serious as he could manage, continuing to fiddle with the gauntlet. He just needed to buy some time — even a couple minutes to get it back in working order. “Half the time you talked in circles, and once it took you twenty pages before you even stated your thesis. It was like being forced to read Kerouac in high school.”
The boys seemed to sense his hesitation about this whole thing and, probably without even meaning to, looked up at Tony with these puppy-dog eyes, and that just wasn’t fair at all. No matter how tense and tired he was, he couldn’t say no to those matching pouty looks. The corner of Tony’s mouth ticked upwards as he motioned for them to get into the Jeep that had just pulled up in front of them. “Alright, alright. But I call shotgun!”
And then he was waking up for real, panting and shaking, trying to look around for some indication of where he was, only to be met with darkness. The cave floor was cold under his palms as he pushed himself up into a sitting position, frantic but only half awake. His chest felt like it was being ripped apart and put back together all over again, and as much as he tried to force air into his lungs, he just couldn’t seem to breathe, all of a sudden sucked back into his hellish dream, back to being waterboarded for hours on end and—
Thankfully, Scott seemed to know what he was getting at. “Yeah, so, um, funny story, actually,” he said, flashing a smile. “Hope and I, we got these off some bad guys we were fighting the other day, and for some reason they carried them around in syringes, just ready to go, y’know? Which doesn’t really make for easy travel, so I dumped them all into Hank’s flask instead, and then I figured you might be interested, for Avengers purposes, and so I was about to give it to you and then—”
Steve had taken up his previous position: back against the wall, his bad leg splayed out comfortably in front of him, and the other bent at the knee, his foot flat against the cold cave floor. He spread them a little more to accommodate Tony, who tried not to think too hard about their proximity—and it was a good thing Steve had put his clothes back on, because Tony just might’ve had a very minor heart attack if he was still just in those snug little boxer-briefs—as he knelt down in front of Steve, sitting back on his heels, and unbuttoned his shirt.
By the time they had all climbed up to the top, trying to make themselves comfortable sharing the same thick branch, the rain had finally petered out and Harry and Peter didn’t seem quite as tense. From up here, Tony could survey far enough to catch glimpses of a building out in the distance. It was just a speck on the horizon, and he had no idea how long it’d take to walk to it, but still, it was something. It was a start. First thing tomorrow, he resolved, they’d head back to camp, when the sun was out again and they didn’t have to make the trek blindly.
The tour went along surprisingly smoothly, with Harry and Peter providing more commentary than the informative video playing on a small screen attached to the dashboard. It was clear that they knew their stuff, and unlike Tony had actually read up on the dinosaurs beforehand: both were smart kids, enrolled in some school specializing in math and science, even though they were only, what, eight years old? Nine, maybe? They reminded Tony a little of himself when he was younger, eager to get their hands on any kind of knowledge, in constant awe of all the science and tech around them. It was heartening, even if it did just make Tony realize how cynical he’d become.
The dinosaur took a step back, ready to bolt, and Tony just held his hands up placatingly, speaking barely above a whisper. “Hey, little guy. Where’d you get that?” he asked, as if there was any chance he’d receive an answer. “How about you give that to me, and we’ll be on our way, okay? We’re not gonna hurt you.”
"Steve tell the man he's delusional" Sam ordered shoving more fries in his mouth as he spoke. Bucky glared at him and went to say something probably not nice when he noticed the picture in Steve's hand.
"This definitely had something to do with Steve's death. Why else would there be a bomb in an abandoned base? They are waiting to take out the rest of us, in the same way they took out Steve. We have to get back and-" Tony rambled before Bruce, who had de-hulked and was currently pulling up his pants, cut him off.
But despite how perfect the room looked, the company inside was anything but. There was a clear divide in the room, Team Cap on one, Team Iron Man on the other, and Team T'Challa in the middle. And then, Steve saw Tony and it was so cliche, like in one of those movies Wanda loved, but it actually seemed that time had stopped. Because there Tony was, in a fancy black suit and tie, sitting at a table between Pepper and Rhodey, Happy across from him. His hair had gotten a few more strands of grey in it, and his eye bags were still very prominent, but to Steve he looked perfect as always.
"That won't be a problem. Right Tones?" Rhodey asked, elbowing Tony in the ribs when he didn't answer fast enough. Tony was starring at Wanda and Maria with a curious look on his face, and Steve was tempted to step into his gaze to get him to stop. It was almost like he was actually seeing Wanda as a kid, and not a weapon of mass destruction.
But Tony. God did he regret what he did to his husband. He should have told him about his parents, but he was in such a good place and Steve didn’t want to set him back. He stopped drinking excessively and he slept for at least five hours a night and he ate at least two meals a day. Steve didn’t want to ruin what he had finally become. And it's not like he knew for sure that Bucky had killed his parents. Ninety nine percent of him was sure,but he had desperately held onto the one percent that said he hadn't.
“They have it pieced together that I am not in America anymore. But I don’t think they are close to figuring out I’m in Wakanda, and even if they did, this is probably the safest place in the world to be” unless H.Y.D.R.A planned on storming Wakanda with undefeatable monsters, they weren’t going to get in.
“Are they close? Have they narrowed it down to this area?” Tony was already itching to start tracking H.Y.D.R.A agents and take them down.
Groaning Steve slowly straightened up and flushed the toilet, but still didn’t get off the floor. For once, Captain America didn’t have the strength to do so. Lately he didn't have the strength for much, preferring to spend his days locked in his room. Some days it was a fight with himself to eat, and sleeping wasn't a thing anymore.
"I don't agree with everything the accords said. Hell I don't even know if I agree with half the things on there. But I think they are a necessity. You say that the safest hands are our own. Have you forgotten all the harm we've caused?" Tony took a seat opposite Steve. He looked casual as he sat, but Steve could see the way his body tensed, like he was waiting for Steve to burst. He wondered if the Iron Man suit was somewhere near by, waiting to be call upon.
"Shit, ya I'm here" finally he answered, and Steve exhaled. Thank god. "Thor, go get Bruce. I'm going to find them, you bring Bruce to me, he's going to Hulk up and help us destroy the wall. Everyone makes it out, no one dies" So that's why he had gone quiet. He hadn't realized it, too busy thinking about not dying, but this was exactly how he had 'died'. Of course Tony would be thinking about that.
"Enjoy your Dora" Shuri grinned and Steve fake glared at her retreating back. Adia, Okoye, and Nakia followed them out after their own hugs goodbye, which just left the Avengers. Well, former avengers. Without T'Challa there was no civil ground in this room, no one to separate them from fighting.
“NO!” Steve yelled, slamming his hand down on the counter and watched in horror as it cracked. Not enough for it to fall apart, but the entire counter top now looked like a spider web, lines going in every direction.
Steve did the only thing he could do in this moment; he lifted his arms and caught the falling ceiling, centimetres from crushing him and the others.
"We'll talk. Later. After this, just the two of us" and that was the best news Steve had received all day.
"There's always news reports on me" Tony tried to sound indifferent, but Steve saw right through it. It was almost like he was ashamed that Steve saw something like that.
"You mean a man who was tortured and brainwashed for years, by the worst organization to ever exist? He wasn't in control of himself Tony, and you know that. You're reasoning is just being clouded because it's personal to you. But let me put it this way for you. Do you blame Clint for what happened with Loki? Or after Extremist, if I had become a murdering tool like the others, would you arrest me? Or try and kill me?"
"For gods sake Stark, I've seen you diffuse a bomb without breaking out into a sweat. Put that arm under her to support her and just bounce her on your hip to keep her content" she adjusted Maria in his arms, and Steve couldn't help but sneak glances at them from the corner of his eyes. Maria was starring at Tony with an unreadable expression on her face as she tried to figure out who the stranger was. Tony just starred back, but Steve could see the apprehension leave him and the love take over.
Steve hurried back to his house, needing to see his kids now even more than before his talk with Nat because no matter the situation they always calmed him down. But when he entered everything was not calm. Because Tony and Rhodey were sitting on one side of his living room, Wanda and Vision on the other, and the kids playing in the middle. Pepper and Happy must have left already, today being too much of an adventure for them to endure much else. He wasn't sure how long they had been here, but he was sure that as soon as they arrived the heated stares started. Tony was glaring at Wanda, Wanda's fingers had sparks of red shooting out randomly, Rhodey was watching the kids make a mess, and Vision was looking at Steve.
“Tell me. Please Steve, no more secrets” Tony begged. He wasn’t above fighting dirty, and using his puppy dog eyes to get what he wanted.
"I was thinking about barbecuing. I think I have some hamburgers and hot dogs still" Steve used that as an excuse to go to the kitchen, and get away from everyone, but of course Tony followed hot on his heels.
"Which I apologized for. But you attacked me too, you would have killed Bucky if we hadn't fought back. Probably would have killed me in your rage to get to Bucky" Tony looked at him shocked. It was like the plug in a pool floaty. Once he pulled it, you could see the anger slowly leaving Tony.
“I was planning on waiting until after you had left to put a plan into motion. I was thinking I would try and go somewhere H.Y.D.R.A would most likely be, maybe Germany, or near Sokovia. They have bases along the Alps. The plan so far is that I’ll get spotted by them, I’ll make sure they confirm it’s me, and then I’ll get out. They’ll know what I look like, and they can stop killing innocent men”
"Do I?" Tony whispered, and he looked like he didn't believe it. He didn't know how to respond, because how do you prove to your ex husband that you almost killed in a fit of rage that you were a good person still? You couldn't.
Steve’s ears turned red at the look Tony gave him, but he smiled back and continued with what he was doing.
"Told ya, she's a little devil. But she's fine, one piece of cake won't hurt her. And she's getting more on the floor then in her mouth" Tony nodded and relaxed, and let Maria be.
“I don’t feel so good” Steve told him before lurching forward to start dry heaving into the toilet, and Bucky couldn’t help the small chuckle that escaped past his lips.
"My room is just down the hall, last door on the left if you need anything. Rhodey will probably be in the room right across from yours" Steve opened the door, and moved aside so Tony could pass through. "You don't have to wake up with the kids, you should get your beauty sleep"
Finally after what seemed like forever, but was really only like twenty minutes, the phone was fixed. Turning it on, he watched the screen light up and dialed the only number on the phone, holding his breath until Steve answered.
“Always taking care of me” he said as they slowly shuffled out the bathroom door and down to the medical suite.
"These kids will be the luckiest kids to ever be born. They are surrounded by so many people who already love them, and that love is only going to grow after they are here" she seemed to like having her hair stroked so he continued to do it until she had calmed down a bit.
“If you’re with me when we fight H.Y.D.R.A I won’t be focusing on my fight. I’m going to be watching you, I’m going to be making sure that they don’t even get five feet from you. I could jeopardize the entire mission because I won’t be able to concentrate. Because if anything happens to you, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I can’t lose you Tony. Not again. Not permanently” what was he supposed to do if H.Y.D.R.A got to Tony? He couldn’t protect his best friend from H.Y.D.R.A, and it still hurts him to know that he failed Bucky. He can’t lose Tony, not Tony. It will destroy him.
was what he wanted his mornings to be like everyday. He would try and push the seven am morning thing back, but he would endure it if it meant this was what he woke up to.
"If this is your idea of a pep talk, it's shit" Steve interrupted and instead of glaring at him like she normally would have done she smiled, glad to see him attempting a joke.
"I mean, I figured Tony would make you godfather over one of them. I just chose for it to be Maria" Steve shrugged like it wasn't a big deal, when in reality he was freaking out. He wasn't even sure that he wanted the godfather/mother thing to ever be brought up. He named Nat as Maria's godmother and Sam as James godfather, Bucky being an honorary one, and when he couldn't pick two more he realized he couldn't because Tony was supposed to. So, he let it be and never gave Maria a godfather and James a godmother. And it wasn't ever supposed to get out, until his big dumb mouth ruined that.
He wasn't going to make it out of the building, there wasn't time. It was probably why there were only 10 seconds; no time for him to escape, no time for Tony to fly in and deactivate it. He ran into a frightened looking Clint, and without stopping grabbed his wrist and dragged him along behind him.
"Tony, are you there?" Steve's voice broke as he spoke, really wishing that Tony would say something. Finally, he heard someone take a breath, sounding like it was their first breath in a while.
"I wouldn't because I would know that they were with a loving father who was treating them right" Tony gave him a small smile, that Steve mirrored. Well he attempted to copy it, but it probably looked more strained.
"No" both Sam and Bucky snapped, refusing to look at the other, but the way their cheeks both heat up told everyone all they needed to know.
"We're ok, shit, Nomad saved our lives" Nat said into the comm in shock, like she couldn't believe he actually would. The way she was looking up at him from where she lay, only proved his thoughts that she really couldn't believe it. After their treatment of him, they probably expected him to trip them so that they would burn.
"Well Tony and I are the parents of the birthday babies, and we want chocolate for him and vanilla for me. Kids can eat off our plates" Steve told her, and momentarily froze as he realized he had ordered for his ex and volunteered him to feed Maria. But he was saved by the man himself who joined in on the fun.
He does know, however, that he can’t look at Tony while he’s saying it, and he brushes past him, out of the closet, and sits down on the edge of the bed instead. Elbows on his knees, head in his hands, Steve takes a moment to collect his thoughts, listening to the sounds of Tony getting ready for bed: the shuffling of clothes as he strips out of them, the light swish as they get tossed into the hamper one-by-one, the long stretch of silence that follows.
Steve and Tony were pretty damn obvious too. It wasn’t as if they were trying to hide their relationship from the rest of the team. After the first two weeks they found it would be a waste of extra effort since the rest of the Avengers were ridiculously oblivious anyway. But they decided that, sometime during the trip, they’d tell the others. It wasn’t their fault if the team was all of a sudden so particularly blind to their not-subtle-at-all hints.
Five feet away, lying half buried in the sand, was the recognizable red, white, and blue of Captain America’s shield.
“I have a plan, okay?” he assured. As far as plans went, though, this one was a little more dubious than most. Even so, they were running out of options and it didn’t seem like the kids had any better ideas, crying notwithstanding. “It’s only gonna buy us a couple seconds, so we need to move quick. On my cue, we’re gonna make a break for it, to the trees on the left. Got it?”
And this time, when he fell back asleep, slumped against Steve’s side, Tony didn’t dream of anything.
Bruce reached out and without warning and grabbed the velociraptor nearest to him by the tail, lifting it high into the air and then slamming it down on the muddy ground, hard enough that Tony could practically feel the blow himself. And then, still in a rage, Bruce took another one—the one that had tried to take a bite out of Harry earlier—and catapulted it back into the forest like some kind of Olympic shot-put gold medalist, and off in the distance came a dull
Clint hummed in thought, like he’d never considered that as an answer. He wasn’t a great actor, but Steve did give him points for his commitment to the role. “Yeah, that should work. I’m obviously letting none of you sleep in my bed,” he added, receiving a swat on the arm from his wife. “Two rooms left and five of you.”
Tony glanced over at the kids. Eyes wide with fear, but otherwise unharmed; it was the exact same expression as they wore last night, during their botched safari ride that had so rudely been interrupted by that damn T-Rex. A wave of deja vu washed over Tony when he heard that roar again, louder this time, closer. The ground shook under the weight of heavy feet.
Bruce looked at him warily, like he knew what Tony was thinking—and God, Tony really hoped he did, hoped he wouldn’t wait for him, wouldn’t pass go, wouldn’t collect two hundred dollars, would just get the kids out of here—but nodded nonetheless. “Got it.”
It was too late to try getting it back, though; he had to focus on getting the kids someplace safe. Which, on an island where dinosaurs could now roam free, seemed more and more hopeless.
He really should’ve expected that he’d be this charmed by Steve, by his honesty, his modesty, his knack for storytelling, but it still managed to catch him off guard, just a little. They talked about SHIELD like it was the weather, about Fury’s work-in-progress team like fantasy football. They talked about Bruce, the kids, Osborn, and for a while there, Tony felt almost normal. Normal for him, at least.
“I’m sure they did,” Bruce replied, though it wasn’t much of an assurance when he sounded just as uncertain.
“And now the radio doesn’t work either. Well, that’s just fucking great,” Tony muttered under his breath, only realizing his mistake after two simultaneous gasps sounded from the backseat. “Whoops. Sorry. Just ignore me.”
got to you, I’m pretty sure my actual vows are going to make you weep,” he teased, earning a snort of laughter for his efforts. He held up the truth serum, and with one last considering look, asked, “Ready?”
“It probably is,” Bruce said, watching it warily. “Maybe we should get away from here, go a little farther inland.”
Maybe it was the fact that he’d fully given in to all of this—committed to being an absolute sap, at least for the rest of the night—that got the ball rolling, but Tony got so swept up in his words for a moment that, without even thinking, he ended up blurting out the one thing he’d been trying so desperately to keep to himself.
“Yup. Three months, they said?” she replied, and handed Fury a twenty. Then Bruce, with a sigh, gave Fury another, and Thor held out a fistful of bills. Clint was still bewildered.
It seems that he doesn’t actually accomplish that though, because less than a second after Tony enters the living room, he pauses, offers a lopsided grin, and cocks a brow at Steve. “Someone’s happy today,” he notes, coming over to set his briefcase down on a nearby recliner and drop a kiss to Steve’s crown. “What happened? Did you save a kitten from a tree? Was there a sale on Raisin Bran at Whole Foods?”
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve said, biting his lip. “The ceremony hasn’t even started and you’re already gonna make me tear up.”
“Oh, no, I was just… You just surprised me, is all,” Steve hastened to assure. He reached out, took one of Tony’s hands between both of his, and offered one of those antiquated Boy Scout smiles, soft and sweet and genuine. “I’m not saying no, but I think it’d probably be best if we wait a little. Just until we get out of here.”
“Mr. Stark,” Peter said again, more panicked, and Tony turned around in his seat to find the boy staring out the window, eyes wide. Harry, beside him, was similarly frozen, but managed to lift a shaky hand enough to point at the windshield.
“Oh, I know,” Tony said, the too-wide vacant-eyed corporate smile he reserved for mostly for glad-handing at charity events now making way for something more genuine, something softer at the edges. “I’ve read your paper on— Okay, honestly, I’ve read all your papers at least twice, and I gotta say, it’s good stuff. Big fan of your work. Also a fan of how you turn big, green, and angry, but mostly the research stuff.” He watched Osborn head up to the cockpit, presumably to check with the pilot before take-off, and Tony leaned forward in his seat. “But, uh— what the hell are we doing here? Because the more I think about this whole ‘previously unheard-of secluded island’ thing, the more it sounds like the setting of a Stephen King novel.”
“Think I have something of yours,” Tony says, holding up the familiar sketchbook. When he finally catches sight of Steve’s surely dopey expression, he lifts a brow, opening his mouth to speak, but his question is promptly answered as his gaze drops down to the planner laid out on the counter in front of Steve. “Ah, snooping again, are we?” he teases. “Find anything interesting?”
That said, Tony didn’t have too many alternatives, and it took one glance at the lumpy, worn-down couch in the corner of the room—and the feeling of a phantom backache from the last time he’d crashed down here—for him to decide to risk it. Sleeping was an easy way to waste away the next couple hours anyway, without having to fret about anyone, either intentionally or otherwise, taking advantage of the truth serum. “Yeah, that’s probably a good idea,” he finally decided, following Bruce out of the lab and into the elevator, the lights automatically turning off behind them, monitors shutting down, and holographs slowly flickering away.
It’s not like they haven’t talked about this, the future of their relationship: they’ve been going out for, god, just under two years now, of course they’ve talked about it. Despite Tony’s history with commitment, and Steve’s inexperience with relationships, they’d both made it abundantly clear that they were on the same page with this—that this was long-term—even in simple moments where Tony would murmur
Tony paused, a bit taken aback by how little he had to work for it. Not that he was complaining at all, especially not when Steve’s hand came up to rest at the back of his neck, fingers brushing against the hair at Tony’s nape. “Well, that was easy,” Tony murmured, and thank God he had found an actual Altoid at the bottom of that tin because Steve was a lot closer than he’d been a second ago. “Just— Uh, just so we’re on the same page, what exactly are you saying yes to?”
Which was just fucking perfect timing, really — the one time Tony tried to be optimistic this whole trip, and look where it got him. And all before he’d managed to get his hands on a cup of coffee, too.
