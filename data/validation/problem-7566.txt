"He was the first one I showed. He refused to stop. And despite all I've just said, I was inclined to agree with him. BARF might not be permanent, but if its a choice between it and being locked up for the rest of his life because he might not be able to control himself..." Bruce's voice is filled with knowing and suddenly Natasha is there, a comforting hand on his arm. They stand there together in a quiet semi-circle for a moment, staring at the screen. "You're right, Tony. We'll keep working on it. I just wanted to let you know."
"I was."
Tony can't look anywhere but those glowing red eyes, noting with the same dim horror he always has how similar Ultron's face looks to that first armor he built, so many years ago. Ultron could have become anything it wanted - why did it choose this form? Why did it choose
"I can't go with you, Tony. Ross will have my head on a platter."
"It's a good feeling," Cage admits with a snort.
Tony exchanges the briefest of glances with Rhodey. He'd gone to Rhodey first to take this job but the man declined. He wouldn't say why but Tony knew that for all of Rhodey's bluffing the man was still unsteady on his legs.
dude im STRONGER THAN YOU
"You would be working within the US Military," Danvers says in a tone that indicates she and Rhodey have been going around in circles for awhile. "Surely the Accords don't prevent you from doing that."
"Why don't you fix him?"
, he couldn't admit.
"No, I mean-" Steve feels off-kilter, unbalanced, like he always does when he gets on the track because he knows its wrong. "I mean I never belonged anywhere but at the compound. I told him once that it felt like home. And he, it feels like he took it away from me. I know he didn't. I
Tony gave you this number?
Tony chances a smile. "You've done good work, Your Highness." He can't say
Tony rears back. "I was protecting Wanda. I should have told her beforehand, I realize that, but Wanda wasn't an American citizen, they could deport her at the drop of a hat and the way the public was turning against her-"
As for actual chapter stuff: I really admire fics where Tony can fully appreciate how much it wasn't Bucky's fault in a relatively short matter of time, but this wasn't that fic. More importantly, it matters more that BUCKY realizes it as well, and he is definitely not there. I think seeing your parents' killer and seeing one of your victims constantly would do a real number on anybody, no matter what they knew logically. But they're both making important first steps here.
Wanda Maximoff stares back at him.
- can't believe -
He doesn't meet Fury's gaze, staring at his hands spread over his thighs. "I can't say that I am. I'm aiming to be someone better."
"You don't believe that," Barnes counters.
"The game plan is the same as its ever been. Fighting the fight that others can't," Steve corrects firmly, crossing his arms over his chest. "It's like you said. I couldn't just sit back in Wakanda. If you have the means to help and you don't, you bear your own responsibility for the fall out."
Steve grabs the bottle himself and cracks it open, taking a long swallow before turning another page on Rachel Leighton's horror show of a life. "Why the hell not."
It doesn’t last, of course. Thor comes back with Bruce in tow, shouting ‘the aliens are coming!’ like Sci-Fi Paul Revere and in between sick vindication and abject panic Tony finds himself suddenly thrown at Steve, being expected to lead a team with a man he barely trusts.
Chad wants their hands on him. The UN wants their hands on him. Ross wants his hands on jimm. Natasha says if anyone puts a finger on Clint Barton they'll lose it quickly.
The king draws his long coat open and pulls out a slip of paper. There is something else in there, a familiar looking packet, but Tony concentrates on the paper in front of him. It's a transfer slip for one Scott Edward Harris Lang from Wakandan custody to Belgian. "He will need more help than Agent Barton. It is my understanding that Mr. Lang has missed...'parole?'"
"You're welcome."
TO: RESTRICTED
BANNER:
Natasha seizes the phone, face alight with an idea. "Some of us are baseline humans. Would you allow us entry?" There is silence on the line. "Please, sir, we can help."
The objects clatter to the ground and Wanda's whole body dulls as she slumps into the couch. Her eyes catch on the blank TV like she can see still Tony on the screen. "I am not sorry I followed you, Steve. You're a good leader and you did, in the end, stop Zemo. But...how a thing is done is just as important as doing it. We fought against our friends, we lied to our friends, and they did the same to us. I think that - causality and catastrophe. We make our own demons. We've made our friends into monsters, or maybe they made us. I don't know which is more frightening."
For the first time, something that wasn't drenched in abject misery flashed across Stark's face. "Hey, that's got a bit of a dance to it, don't it?" His eyes, the same ones Steve saw everyday in a different face, held Steve for one last moment before Tony Stark stepped backwards into the Fog, swallowed up in an instant, a smile beginning to stretch across his face.
"But a good look for a human being," T'Challa counters, glancing at Tony and saying nothing when the shorter man shifts a little closer while they walk, cursing the cold. "It is important first to be good, then to be a king. My father told me that." His whole postures shuts down, as it does every time he mentions T'Chaka. "I am here to show my support for my fellow teammate and for our leader. The Accords - I thought they seemed so simple when my father and the others first began outlining them, but living them has proved more difficult than I imagined."
The line crackles back to life and Tony unmutes it. On the other end the commander is furious. "You said you would keep your distance! Is this how the Avengers treat agreements?"
"I'm sorry, I just-" Tony knows that voice and he scrambles into a sitting position.
"Same," Tony says with a shrug. "I have bad dreams," he admits after a moment.
With a lazy salute from Cloak, a passing hand on the shoulder from Dagger, and a sneer that's almost nice from Diamondback, they exit, their voices echoing down the hall as Steve is left with Sam. Steve looks at his friend to find him watching him with a gaze he can't read - happiness, maybe, but sadder. But for the first time in weeks Sam doesn't look absolutely exhausted.
Tony's heart weighs like a stone in his chest.
now, you can - you'll get better and it'll get easier, be like it used to-"
"I bet they're real proud of you, kid," he tells him during a lull in his non-stop diatribe against cafeteria food.
“’M sorry,” Steve murmurs into his hair. Tony echoes him, finally wrapping his arms around Steve.
have done better as team leader...but he could have, too. He'd had a responsibility, and he failed utterly. Tony learns from his mistakes.
"He deserves to not be afraid anymore," Tony says, and the words taste like rusty pennies at the back of his throat.
"Yeah, Nat, I got that. I
A really bad day. please.
“Your body mass defies physics!” Tony declared, pointing accusingly at the Steve’s shoulder to waist ratio.
"Hey," Tony butts in. "FRIDAY's perfect."
"What?"
Is everyone okay?
Tony cursed silently to himself. Steve hadn't been wrong when he said the Accords could be dangerous; in the beginning, it was because they were too broad, gave the UN too much control. Tony and T'Challa have been wittling that down, taking it nation by nation, letting each experience under the Accords provide an example of where to improve or where to maintain. Every step has been a stumble, but Tony truly believes they're getting somewhere better. Now, the problems lie in specificity: in particular, what to do with homegrown heroes.
"What you're talking about is pure conjecture," Rhodey tells him softly, sadly. "Tones, listen to me, I know that this looks bad, but you're half out of your head right now. You just need some sleep, okay, and we can talk about this more in the morning." Tony's head is still shaking and Rhodey's voice gets firmer, slips into that dangerous territory it did when he took Tony's suit. "Say you are right, Tones, what is this gonna change? What is this gonna help except your guilty conscience?"
The HYDRA agent grins. It's slightly crazed and flecked with blood. "You will not stop me from my goal, Avengers. I was warned of you. The doctor told me what I must do. To save us all. The doctor told me. The doctor told me." There is a sing-song quality to his voice that sends ice straight down Tony's spine. The man raises his right hand and reveals the trigger. "To save us all. I was warned."
"Good answer," Natasha told him. "Now that you're here, Rogers, we need to start talking strategy. Gamora says Ronan won't stay complacent for long."
"That...doesn't sound like Fury at all," Steve laughs. Sam gives him a flat stare.
Tony looks up, the wording of that bugging him. "You're coming along, right?"
"How are you doing, Wanda?" he asks her as he sits. Since taking T'Challa's deal of laying low, they've all been cooped up in this house and of all of them it grates on her the hardest. Wanda's gone from one cell to another for the past five years of her life, this is just one more. Steve hates what this war has done to them.
"I am the only reason you even have a prayer of ever seeing your family again, Clint," Natasha snaps. For being so forlorn in the hall, Romanov has stepped up to the game surprisingly quick, green eyes sparking fire. "You're not stupid, you know this is serious. We're trying to help you."
bonding with an alien-"
, he thinks, and sees stars and darkness and the Chitauri on fire.
"Did the son ask for that?"
Cursive and elegant and oblivious, must be Vision.
Tony swallowed, hand clenched white-knuckled around his glass. "But I stayed still. While they shot you in the street like you were an animal I just laid there. I was probably drunk again. And I would've - I always think that I find the limit. Too far, I say, and I back off and give myself a good old pat on the back for my restraint. But I wished for 'em then, all my pretty weapons. If I'd-a had them - well, I still probably would have been a coward, but maybe you could've used them and saved us like you wanted. You would've known how. You would've done it right."
"Somebody's been luring high-level crime bosses to Harlem, taking them out," Natasha explains when she sees Tony's look of puzzlement. "Heading out?"
I want to talk to Tony.
The Accords are not a mistake, but he will fix them.
"I never said any of that," Tony says sharply. "I never have and I never will."
"Sorry, Tony," the other scientist laughs. "No easy way out for this one. Just take it slow, okay? And for God's sake, Tony, let him go to the show. If you can't keep him safe, no one can. Even if you can't, this is his choice."
"Or, just to bring the paranoia down a notch," Clint interjects. "Norman Osborn was a megalomanic idiot and the government indulged him because they're morons. When he came down off the high, he couldn't take what he'd done and offed himself. Occam's Razor. We need to focus on
“Well, you do bring out the best in me, Captain.” It was not the teasing riposte it might have been from his own Tony. “You got a Natasha? A Sam? They’ve always liked you. Everyone likes you. Everyone wants to be your friend. Even Mini-me, who, just looking around, has built about half this campus, is Iron Man, probably works at Stark Whatever, and is apparently still taking time out of his day to try and help you out.”
Tony nods. "Better, really." That gets something like a smile out of Kamala. "But the rest of team will be there to back you up no matter what. Have you even got a chance to look at the Accords, yet, Ms. Khan?"
"Don't be cryptic, FRIDAY, what is it?" He reaches over Rhodey and grabs the remote, turning the TV back on manually. On screen, the pretty girl from the five o'clock news looks upset, warning the public about 'the graphic footage they're about to see' and something cold drops in Tony's stomach.
Clinton scowled, pushing Steven away. “‘M not locking him up in a cage, Rogers. Tony wanted to fight; so did I. We took out at least two hundred soldiers. What was
"STOP CALLING ME KID!" Blizzard screams, and his arms ice up to his elbows in a sparkling flash of blue. Everyone in the room tenses and watches Donnie stare in mute horror at his small loss of control. Tony did this to him, pushed him to this point. Donnie drops his hands to his side and snarls at the floor, unable to meet anyone's eyes. He is ashamed of himself, Christ, Tony never wanted this for him. "If you need me, I'll be in my cage."
the pretty newscaster tells him as footage plays behind her.
Three days, Tony!” Jan swung her legs up and over, and that’s when Tony knew she was serious – this position was not sanctioned in her very precise tanning schedule.
"Usually he's right."
the problem.
Tony stands over the desk, looking down at the re-made phone, obscuring the drawing of the superhero shield protecting the world but for the corner where Iron Man, Captain America, and the Winter Soldier are linked in a curved line. "Make a move, Stark," he murmurs to himself. "Pick a play."
And he could’ve sworn for a moment that the man’s smile almost turned genuine before he leaned forward, casting half his face into shadow. “Prove it.”
His phone buzzes in his pocket but Tony ignores it, folding up the paper carefully. "You haven't shown this to anyone? Gwen hasn't shown this to anyone?" Peter shakes his head to both questions and Tony relaxes minutely, stowing the paper in his pocket and pulling out his buzzing phone, clicking a button to silence it without looking down. "Good. Keep it quiet, okay? Whatever Osborn was up, it wasn't good. It's best if you just leave it alone."
"Think of it like a hot fix. The full patch is coming soon. We're together on this, Nat. I promised."
"You made all this?" Kamala says instead of answering. Dummy comes barreling around a workbench and she very nearly squeals. "How many of these do you have?"
"He put Sam, Clint, Wanda, and some dude named Scott on the Raft. Only, problem is, the Accords have always called for a fair trial before imprisonment, and the UN wouldn't be happy that it was an
Many thanks go out to nostalgicatsea, who helped me finally get this chapter on the road. You can find her on tumblr or on here under that screenname, she's a heck of a writer. I got a little carried away with the crack in the beginning so if you're here strictly for Steve/Tony, just bear through it for me please!
There is something missing here, but the kid is scared and it sets off all of Tony's alarm bells. "What do you need me to do?"
"It was rough," Steve agrees around the lump in his throat. It's a lie, wrapped in a truth: it's
"You won't like how I retaliate," Ross had said. He'd told Tony how forthcoming Zemo had been. And now the whole world watches his parents scream and cry and beg for mercy. The whole world has a piece of Tony's pain to dissect and tear apart.
Bruce works on alternate ways to help Donnie, surrounding himself with dozens of brain scans while he conferences with Vision about what to do. Tony suspects he's close to a breakthrough, from the way he grows more and more nervous every time Donnie goes in, but it might not be something any of them like.
Tony disappears with Pepper behind Happy Hogan into one of his more conservative limos and Sam glances to the side, finding Steve hovering indecisively in the doorway. "You missed the good part," he says when he sees the look on Steve's face. "Before he came out they were discussing if Stark released the video himself to garner sympathy."
"Like he'll want to talk to me after that," Tony says distantly, disdainfully. Bruce sighs.
Tony snorts. "Yeah, I read his file. A modern day Robin Hood, right?" Hope's pretty face screws up in an ugly sneer and Tony puts his hands up. "I'm not saying I won't help, alright? I'm saying it'll take some doing. And in the meantime-"
"Fourteen at present. All deceased. I will proceed."
"Yes to all of it, Fry." A large projection of the nightly news plays against the glass of his lab doors showing a skyscraper in New York - Oscorp, close enough to Stark Tower that Tony can actually see his name glowing in the background of the shot. "Pep, please tell me you aren't in the city."
“Well, not in public,” Jan said with an unspoken ‘duh’ somewhere in there, and Natasha growled. The only one who made Stark cry was
Steve looked like he didn’t like that option much better than Tony blithely sending out his robots, but before he could argue, his eyes again got caught on the gleam of his shield.
Tony snorts. "If it's an emergency, Pepper won't settle for a phone call." Never mind if it's a real threat, Pepper has a panic button in her office and every room of her apartment.
"Kiss-ass," Howard accused fondly.
"Don't think I didn't see you," she warns him. "Coming after me. You saved me, too." She leans forward and Peter shrinks back into War Machine's chestplate. Gwen frowns for just a moment, then she compromises, kissing the tips of her fingers and laying them on his cheek. Spider-Man's remaining good eye rapidly dilates and Tony absolutely does not smile at any of it. "Thank you."
Jessica-
," Tony corrected. "And I let you die."
"Something else, Mr. Khan?" Tony asks the younger man, feeling a pang at how lost Aamir looks. He's still a kid himself, really. They've all been so single-mindedly focused on getting Kamala better that they forgot about the other orphan who hovers like a specter over the only family he has left.
"Or," Tiberius sighs, sounding exhausted. "Or worse. People get used to the fear. The fear starts to become normal and accepted. If that happens, its time to turn in your superhero badge, Iron Man, because the bad guys have already won."
"Will you come with me? To see him? He could probably use the company." After Tony's parents died he spent two days straight curled under his father's desk at SI because it was fucking New Years' and that was the one place that nobody would look for him, besides. Nobody but Rhodey, who dragged him out and threw away the whiskey and flew him out to Philadelphia to detox at his parents' house. He gained three pounds in a week eating Mrs. Rhodes' cooking. They fussed and fussed and he hated it, every second of it, because his mother would have never done that for him and
Steve smiled at her, always shy under praise, because he never received enough of it. “Bucky’ll be happy,” he said. “I think. He doesn’t have his name yet.”
"So," Sam says. "Let's discuss this like the rational adults we are, alright?"
"Ew," Tony returns. "Clear your Wednesday for next week, I'll be calling in my favor." Barnes is sure to make his decision before then, and either way he chooses, his case is moving forward soon. Tony needs to convince seven billion people to be poor mistreated Bucky Barnes' biggest fans. No man could look at what was done to Barnes and not be moved, or at the very least terrified at the loss of control Barnes endured for seventy years.
There was nothing in the world he could ever do to make up for Tony.
Tony trusts her. He has to.
"No," Tony says through nerveless lips. "That's not it at all, kid-"
Nick Fury is in his living room. Tony walks in, sees the man sitting on his couch and holds up one finger when the man opens his mouth before walking straight back out again. "FRIDAY, get the team. Lock down Kamala and Donnie's floors." Then he straightens his shoulders and heads back in.
"I know that you were just trying to help," he said softly, not missing the quirk of Tony's eyebrow at that. "But it didn't feel like that to me. Everything you showed me just made me realize how out of place I really was."
FRIDAY, in contrast, sounds apprehensive. The ringtone sounds again. Natasha has frozen, her eyes on Tony, who is similarly struck stock-still.
"Tony, would you please look at me?" Tony almost did; his head turned towards Steve even though his eyes locked on a spot somewhere over his right shoulder. But it was enough. All Steve wanted was to see his eyes. "Look. I...I didn't choose this. To be here, I mean. So. I would like to choose everything else."
"HYDRA's got a mole," Hope breathes.
, her impersonal comfort. But he loved it, too. It was warm, and he had been so cold since his parents left him.
“I built the suit!” Tony yelled, and Jan stood up. That was the decibel she’d been waiting for. “I build those robots! I know plenty about the real world, Rogers, you’re the one living in a fantasy.”
I need a meeting with Osborn kid. I was being proactive. And thorough. Also, tell this charming PA that while their attempts to block my calls are downright adorable, SI owns like 500 telephone numbers and I can always buy more.
"No doubt," Natasha says. "It's good - it's a good start, Tony."
When Peter crashes, he crashes hard. FRIDAY's indicating his watch is a little busted but she's reading multiple lacerations and three broken ribs. Peter's most likely going into some form of shock, which his healing factor would normally compensate for but not when he's panicking like this.
"I don't understand," Wanda says. "We ran away from the Accords so we wouldn't have to answer to someone. And now you want to follow SHIELD again? Were these people not secretly HYDRA?"
"Tracking down the people responsible for the terrigen bombs." Tony doesn't even try to hide his surprise that Fury is so freely giving this away. "I'm here to ask for assistance. But first I thought I'd get an explanation."
His father's hands are so much bigger than his when they wipe away the formula.
"Pepper-"
T'Challa comes and finds him when he is back up on his feet, his clothes back in order, and if the timing is suspicious neither of them are going to say anything. Instead T'Challa gallantly offers an arm, and promises to impress him with the sights of Wakanda tonight. The buzzing of his brain doesn't quiet, never quiets, but his hands eventually do stop shaking.
Lately he had seen more and more glimpses of the good man under Stark's arrogance and flashiness. The warmth and feeling in those eyes was genuine, he knew it. The bravery Tony fought with, the pride he took in his place amongst the Avengers - it was all real and true, and then somewhere along the way it got twisted, turning Tony aloof and cocky and careless. Steve wanted nothing more than to untwist him, to prove to him that he didn't have to be any of that. What he was underneath - whatever he was underneath - that was more than enough.
Tony is running a house of broken things. But it's going to be alright. Tony is good at fixing.
"Always cheerful," she stresses again. "But sensible. I have to be. Along with all the brooding, Tyrone took the rashness and recklessness. He leaves all the good qualities to me." The last part is said in a loud, carrying voice, and Cloak grimaces at her while Rachel's laughter comes from high above. Steve cannot spot where she's lurking in the rafters or how she got up there, but just last week she scaled a sheer wall using her darts and steel-tipped boots. "Look, you know Fury. If he could keep all of us under lock and key and only let us out when he wanted to use us, he would. The Accords must be driving him nuts. Imagine - superheroes answering to the United Nations, of all things!
"Stay here," he orders her. She pouts and with the pink lipstick she insists on spackling on that somehow never smears, it comes off more obscene than anything else.
"These are your parents? I mean, obviously."
him. Is he with Rogers? I mean, we're gonna have to chat anyway."
“She tried her best. She slipped a couple of times before…the accident. Always started over. I still have every one of her AA chips. She was so dedicated. ‘Making up lost time,’ she said. She tried so hard for us. I went to school. And without me around-”
"There is already much to attend to," T'Challa tells Natasha. Tony watches as she pulls herself together, figuring out how to wear the burden of the Avengers all over again. It's a good look on her.
Donnie still looks angry, but underneath that is a thick layer of misery. "I just want to be better," he says to his feet. "I didn't want to bother you. I know what they're playing on the news."
"I have no doubt the Avengers will be there to help out," T'Challa says confidently. "As ever. Speaking of, Doctor Banner, have you returned to join the team once more? Tony has no doubt already begun devising a contract for you."
he thinks. "Calm down," just to break up the silence. Steve isn't lost. He has a purpose, a reason, a goal. Steve is fine. He has Sam here and Bucky and Wanda waiting for him. Tony will get the Accords and maybe he'll finally call. Maybe Steve can tell him personally what he's doing here. Tony can't not act either, they're the same like that, always fighting, always pushing.
"Waiting," T'Challa says, his already husky voice sounding somewhat hoarse. "Allow me a few moments of your time, Tony."
Natasha raises one scornful eyebrow. "You're going to let your pride get in the way of-"
"That's what I like to hear," Clint says, clapping his hands and looking immensely relieved. He puts his hands to the table, over the projections, and splits it in two. "I've already got an assignment for you both. You have your phones on you?" They nod and take them out and Clint flicks the slides first to Kamala, then to Peter. Tony hears the 'ding!' of incoming messages. "The first recording is a compilation of Captain America's helmet camera and Iron Man's recorded footage from a battle against HYDRA in 2015. The second is War Machine, Vision, and Iron Man's data from the battle in Canada. Watch them and note the differences in Cap and Iron Man's leadership styles. I want notes on the pros and cons of both, handed into me this time next week. The footage comes with a separate audio file for comm chatter - and I do mean
"Clint," Natasha says evenly. "Chad didn't want us in the country. We had no right to force our help upon them."
"They'll make you sign," Sam warns him. Scott suddenly looks infinitely exhausted.
Even after that, for years, Maria had been a saint, waiting and wishing and praying for things to change, but by Tony's fifth birthday, they all knew the truth. No name was coming. No name was responding. Because there was nothing in Tony to echo, nothing to finish, nothing to love.
"Is he lying?"
T'Challa smiles as they plan out their attack.
"But, Tony-"
The meeting adjourns and Tony waits until he has shaken every hand to collapse down in his chair. Instantly Natasha's hand is on his shoulder and Rhodey and T'Challa are passing through the wooden gate separating the audience from the rest of the room. "You did good, man," Rhodey assures him.
Once there, he leads Tony to a remote wing, farthest removed from the city. "For your safety," he explains when Tony eyes him. "There may be some effects left behind from the last occupant but I assure you, it is clean." There is a gleam in his eye when they bid each other goodnight that Tony wants to dissect, but he lets him go.
Another.
“You’re leaving?”
“What?”
NATASHA:
The number that Gwen Stacy has circled is an access code. To the Department of Defense. That in itself is not so strange, Tony's had his own lines of access to the DoD before, all very carefully monitored and terminated when his contracts were up. But in conjunction with whatever warped Osborn into the Green Goblin, not-so-strange becomes just-strange-enough. The night is suddenly very cold.
Tony thinks, and from the look on Peter's face he realizes it; sure enough, in the next moment he turns away and walks to the far side of the roof, no doubt collecting himself together. His phone buzzes and Tony finally looks down, blanching when he sees 'Secretary Aleksander Lukin' on the caller ID, just as Natasha's voice suddenly comes in loud over the comms.
"Mr. Stark, it's an honor. As a military man, you cannot imagine the appreciation I have for your ingenuity and tech. We lost big when you left the weapons business but you made the right call. What Stane was doing with your company was a disgrace." His speech is all American, his voice set into the familiar cadence of Northern California, but Tony can still detect the trace hints of a Russian accent underneath it all.
"Thank you for your honesty," he tells the Princess, and she inclines her head, pulling open the door so they can climb out. It is not T'Challa but one of his female bodyguards who comes and collects Tony, also referring to him as Dr. Stark. She takes him into the uppermost level of the facility, high enough so they're now level with the giant panther statue just outside to floor-to-ceiling windows. T'Challa is standing in front of those windows, staring out, and the bodyguard announces Tony before stepping back a discreet distance away.
"Yeah," Rhodey sighs. "I saw what Bruce is cooking up down there. I imagine you've got him on the brain lately. You want to talk about it?"
Did they give these things to him, these parts of themselves, or did he take them? He doesn't know. He can't remember.
If Natasha is a mistake he will let it happen.
"No need," Bruce assures him softly. "We'll give you two some time alone. Someone will be by to check on you later."
"But that's not his fault," Steve protested. "Tony couldn't have possibly predicted-"
Sarah watched her husband take a long pull of his drink, and then she slipped back into Steve’s room once more, sitting in the well-worn chair at his bedside. Her son’s eyes, so much like her own, stared back, glassy and unfocused.
He won't let them down. Not Tony, not the Avengers, not Bucky, and not the team he's failed to gather here. He will do this.
"-born in Hungary, joined HYDRA young, worked your way up the ranks for nearly three decades. May I ask why?"
"We were making the people we were trying to save
"That's because Rogers is an oblivious
Nowadays Tony only jumped in if Donnie failed several times in a row. The best, and worst part of using BARF like this was that it was getting easier to get Blizzard to switch back to Donnie. Best because it made Donnie less of a worry, worst because Bruce reported the constant switching was badly affecting Donnie's brainwaves, dropping them down to low levels. It had taken Tony a long time to trust anyone to help him with Donnie, but so far Bruce (and sometimes Rhodey who would go memory hopping instead of Tony) had proved invaluable. "It's not a problem for Barnes or those other Soldiers - the serum would have prevented any lasting damage from the switch. But Donnie's body is not built to handle this, Tony."
"Are you secretly British?"
"But today, Sergeant Barnes isn't on trial for that. Sergeant James Barnes is still being held accountable for the 87 confirmed assassinations he made while operating as the Winter Soldier. I have brought forth ample evidence to the council and the International Court of Justice that proves that Barnes wasn't in control of any of his facilities during the times of the murders. I know the law isn't quite prepared to handle something on this level - it's beyond comprehension that a man could be reprogrammed like a computer, but the evidence shows that this is the case beyond a shadow of a doubt."
. Excuse me for trying to stop it before it gets that bad." Tony's face was red, his hands clenched tight. "And for your information, Captain, I
"You hate him," she whispers.
"It's been a rough few days, buttercup," he replies tiredly, waving away FRIDAY's holograms.
Peter heads silently to the ledge of the building and sits down, gesturing beside him. Cautiously, Tony sat down next to him, eyes roving over the kid, taking in his healed skin, straight posture, uninjured and whole. Peter doesn't look back.
"The same thing we all want," the man says, eyes narrowing. "The world's not going to survive working at half-strength. There's only so much Tony Stark and his group can do, especially with the Accords holding them back. We need Captain America. We need you."
"...I will send the coordinates for Black Widow and Black Panther. There are snipers camping out in the buildings; get rid of them and report to the nearest Captain after. Mr. Stark, you will go to the second set of coordinates. We have a base there, you will help us coordinate."
The stranger grunted, shaking his head as if to clear it before lifting it up. He, for it certainly was a he, froze when he caught sight of the arc reactor, peeking through the gap left in Tony’s zip-up. “Tony?” the stranger asked, and there was something about that voice. “Tony, am I glad to see you. I had the most-“ The man’s eyes, ever rising, lighted upon Tony’s face.
But it was more than Tony had spoken to me in months, so I rise to the bait. Flung down the gauntlet. I start with the most recent wound - him.
Tony will never be as musically inclined as his mother was but he remembers this: her hands on his, pressing down the keys of the piano, plinking out first 'Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star' and then, as he grew, more complicated pieces. Tony had been enamored of the piano suite from
And maybe that makes him selfish, maybe he’s a coward, but this way nobody hurts. This way nobody’s left alone.)
"Did you know?"
"Well, this definitely makes things easier to look at," the scientist says. "Thanks, FRIDAY. Anything I can help with, Tony?"
HE STOLE THE SHIELD:
The new suit was beautiful, no doubt about it, cast in a much brighter red and gold than normally used in the suits and burnished to a glimmering sheen. Its shoulders were spiked and wide, the plating in the arms and thighs casting an intimidating figure. Iron Man raised his head, revealing a cold, golden stare that would strike fear into the hearts of his foes. The suit practically thrummed with power.
T'Challa looks a bit startled and shakes his head. "Not at all." And it's like the air is suddenly lighter. Tony breathes in deep. "Simply an appreciation."
“No,” Tony repeated firmly.
Tony doesn't breathe again until he's gone and is thankful Rhodey snags him by the arm and sits him down before he collapses to the floor in front of royalty. "We're gonna have to do something about that," he says breathlessly. And then he perks up. "Good thing Natasha kidnapped Barton."
Usually the Time Fog was just that, a swirling mass of fog, though sometimes you could spot distant structures and figures looming. This time it seemed to wrap around Tony’s hand, holding tight, pulling at him.
"Right to fair trial's there in the general charter. Ross was on a power trip; we've taken care of it."
She is a terrifyingly good person. He tells her so and she laughs. "I learn from the best," she says, and he doesn't know what she means.
Natasha thinks, watching as Tony turns, as he and Steve walk away from each other. “Idiots,” she mutters to herself, leaving Jan to flutter after Tony as she heads towards Shield HQ to dig up more of Fury’s precious secrets. After that sad display, she needs all the cheering up she can get.
Things were beginning to explode on the giant screen perched atop the balcony platform of Stark Tower when he arrived. The lawn was crowded with people: kids and teens who had started to come to Avengers Academy’s movie nights, and Avengers themselves. Kamala and Jessica had climbed atop the schawarma stand Tony had insisted on installing, Natasha curled up in a fuzzy black and red bean bag – cupholders included – while Brian perched on the grass at her side. A-Bomb was resting on his stomach, Janet sitting daintly across his broad back. Even Loki was there, though he was standing what he probably considered a perfectly disdainful distance away.
But Natasha fucking Romanov makes it a very near thing. There is a short, three-minute span that feels like an eternity where she won't answer anyone's hails and then they hear her over the comms, with near panic in her voice shouting "Why are you here?"
And then. And then.
"I heard about Kamala's plan," Bruce mentions to him one day as they work quietly in the lab. Vision is interfacing with JOCASTA, preparing her to enter the War Machine suit while Donnie works on the lagging hip joint that's giving Rhodey so many problems. Tony acutely misses Peter for a moment then shoves it away. "Team bonding, huh? It sounds like it'll be fun."
When he was younger, before his mother gave up all hope, she told him stories of her experience escaping the Nazis and fascists as they took over Italy. She spoke of Howard Stark's name, showing it to Tony, even letting him touch the precious letters. Howard Stark meant she had a purpose. A future. That she would be loved. Howard Stark had saved her life.
"I assure you, General, it was not so much them slipping as them breaking my fingers," Tony says blithely. "Former Agent Barton will not get the same opportunity again and he will remain here under arrest. You have my word."
The first thing Kamala Khan ever says to him is "Oh, it's you," in the most unimpressed voice that Tony has ever heard.
A sound comes across the video feed and it takes a second for it to register as a laugh. It is high and wild and mad and
"Yeah, well." He rubs the back of his neck. It's been dogging his thoughts, the shadow of an idea, and Steve's drawing had brought it into focus. "It's just - Aamir, he said some things that got me thinking and - the Compound used to hold us and the entirety of Nu-SHIELD, but they're gone now and now ninety percent of it just gathers dust. And we've got the kids. Kamala, Spidey, even Donnie. The Compound's great for training, but it doesn't seem all that conducive to, ah...
"Mr. Hawkeye?" asks a surprised voice. Kamala Khan is in the doorway, supported by her brother who looks apologetic, and Bruce, who looks exasperated. Donnie is behind them both saying "
Tony takes a deep breath, and starts over again. Time to tear it down.
Now, he is currently hanging upside down from one of the rafters, tangled up in spiderweb. In fact, Kamala Khan is the last one standing and trying not to look too visibly pleased with that fact. Her brother, standing behind the reinforced glass, has no such qualms; Tony can hear Aamir cheering from here.
"Ah. The hand-holding is mutual, then. Got it," Gamora said, raising her hands in peace when Steve opened his mouth again. "Last I saw he was with Rocket and Quill at the
Wanda just rubs at her temples, red sparking at her fingers. She does that now, a nervous habit developed after a week spent locked into a power dampener, a reassurance that her abilities were still there. It's only gotten worse over the past few days.
"Risky move," Fury says. "Liable to cut Stark off at the knees right there and create panic. Exactly what we don't need."
"Hole in one, Captain. Stark Industries is working to bring them to the public in the next three years."
"And I'll even concede to his greater wisdom this time," Tony allows magnanimously. "We can't face a threat like this divided. But we can't do it together, either, and Fury can't bend the world the way he wants it any more than Rogers could."
Rhodes sits up, eyes already sparking hot coals. "Who?"
! He couldn’t stop the small “oh, wow” that escaped him, though, because
"Antony," he smarms. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"
is his opening volley.
Steve shrugs. "Catching up. Should have done this two weeks ago." Sam nods and pulls his hands out from behind his back, revealing a large bottle of rum before he trundles over and slides down the desk opposite Steve, reaching for Dagger's file.
"HA!" Tony shouts at Rhodey. "Queen Khan has spoken. JOCASTA it is."
"And he answered Steve's."
FRIDAY doesn't have a ringtone, so he listens to the silence, staring at his video screen and watching the loading icon circle on its duplicate. He is just about to make FRIDAY end it when suddenly T'Challa appears, blinking blearily into the camera and not wearing a shirt.
. God, he really owed the bastard now.
"Oh, Tony," it says, stroking a cold metal finger down his cheek. It travels further, down his neck, across one clavicle then the other, then down to his chest. "I knew I'd find you here."
Wanda, who looks devastated. "You should come with me," Scott whispers to her as he gathers her close. There is red sparking along her skin, floating into Scott's body, but he doesn't even flinch.
You hadn't told him.
He falls asleep at six in the morning, in front of his computer, and his parents' car is there, crashed into a snowbank in Siberia. Inside is his mother, screaming, and Tony rushes to save her. He tears at the car door as the screams grow in pitch and it's Kamala Khan now, her face pressed against the window, limbs stretching and stretching until they fill the entire car-
For the longest time now, Tony has been almost...afraid of what Steve's absence, what his silence, what that letter with the passive-aggressive capitulation meant, because from where he had sat, it looked a lot like Steve didn't care. That Steve had never cared. That Tony, and the Avengers, had been an acceptable loss. But this drawing, this is not made by a hand that didn't care.
"The bed was too soft," Tony says quietly. "So you slept in the bathtub."
"Sir," Cloak says, nearly drawling the word, and flicks out his hand again to summon another splash of darkness. "Captain."
Tony looks at the holographic screen still floating in the air, Kamala's report still open. She's commented on a section of the battle at the HYDRA base in '15, confusion about why Iron Man is sent so far ahead while Thor, arguably more powerful, is left in the thick of things.
"Stark, we have a visitor. On the roof."
she snarks back. "
"Won't I always know, though?" Bucky answers the unspoken question. "I can't cut it out of me, Steve. All I can do is...choose what to do with it from here on out. 'S more than I had before."
"People have a right to choose, Barton. You don't get to choose for them. Chad didn't want us in their country? That is
"So what
"Really?" Rhodey asks, sounding a little skeptical.
Open your mouth, Rogers. Say it, for once in your life, say it before it’s too late.
"No," T'Challa says, sounding every inch the king he is. "I promised Sergeant Barnes my protection. I cannot allow him to be used like this. He has had enough."
“Tony,” Big Steve said softly, and Tony shut up, finally daring to look up into those eyes again. “Your Steve, has he been out long? Of… of the ice, or wherever he was.”
I am not asking for your permission. That would be insulting to every one of us. I am asking you who knows him best what Barnes would want.
"I'm sensing a 'but' here."
"I'm going in, too," Luke says. "I'm fireproof. I can't see your boy Spider-Man. Pedal to the metal, Iron Man."
Tony is a bit more delicate. "Think of it this way, Councilor, Ross let three Avengers and some guy escape from the Raft. The Initiative hasn't lost a single prisoner...the fact that we've never had one is irrelevant. Clint Barton has the right to a fair trial. My lawyers are prepping him already. In the mean time, we'll keep him close."
"Speaking of - I interviewed the scientists. Well, I tried." Natasha plucks up the fork between two delicate fingers and stabs down, popping her prize - a beef tip - into her mouth. Building suspense, the little sneak. Tony very pointedly rolls his eyes. "One claimed that all he knew was that Dr. Osborn had taken one of the projects contracted out to the company for himself. No one else worked on it but him."
"Steve?" Sam steps closer, peering at his face and apparently not liking what he finds. "Steve, did
Dark liquid begins to creep up the tubes as Howard whirls on Tony, Howard with his face caved in, his Dad through that ruin of a mouth demanding
'Reed probably sent them all through some black hole. Coulda come back anytime but he got too busy arguing with some supreme intelligence about Combinatorics or some shit.'
“I never turn down Will Smith and aliens,” Sam said out loud, gathering up his own lunch and heading off, leaving Natasha and Brian on their own.
"Agent," Lukin admonishes before Tony can speak, but Tony keeps his eyes on his former cousin, watching the way her smile never reaches her eyes. "The evidence is compelling. We all want Barnes to have his trial. The sooner he's out and about and contributing to our great society, the better."
"I - sure, Mr. Stark," he replies easily enough, even as his face is still confused and he slips back into distanced formality. "I, I mean I talk a lot to them."
"Tony." At the sound of his name Tony shuts his mouth, which only makes it clear to him how heavily he's started to breathe. T'Challa walks around the corner of the table to stand in front of him, laying a cautious hand on his shoulder. "Go, be with your team, look into your suspicions. If you're right, it is better to know. You have fulfilled your obligations here - ones that only you yourself were demanding to be met, if I recall."
T'Challa visits bearing a mission to China and meets Bruce Banner for the first time. The part of Tony that still considers Bruce a dear friend - which is
Bucky, all that time. That he had triggered into the Winter Soldier and he set that bomb in Vienna. It wasn't
"I don't know," Peter breathes out wetly. "I don't know, I don't know, he knocked me through the floor. I can hear people screaming. I can hear him laughing."
I know.
That was another thing – his Tony didn’t leak danger, his Tony didn’t seem to cut through everything just by existing. His Tony wasn’t like this. Something was very wrong.
"Kinky," Tony says, but on a sigh so it loses all its punch. "He...he's off. I couldn't tell you how. Anyone who's got Sharon Carter trailing after him like a well-trained dog can't be good news."
Here's the thing:
"Stark," the man greets coldly. "Care to explain to me how I turn my back for five minutes and suddenly half my men are hiding out in a jungle?"
It could work on Barnes.
T'Challa chuckles. "Yes, and they are called the Dora Milaje." Private joke, Tony assumes. Or christ, maybe there are magic panthers guarding Wakanda. They sit in silence for a long moment while T'Challa studies Tony and Tony studies the grain of the conference table.
He hands it over and Tony sets it aside, placing his hands on his workbench and breathing deep. "I can't let you do that again, Don. I know that you wouldn't mean to hurt anyone but HYDRA programming is - it's not exactly people-friendly. And if you get triggered, you don't have any control. I'm gonna have to lock you out of the program." Donnie looks hurt by this, but not nearly as much as he does when Tony says on a sigh, "Should've been the first thing I thought of."
“Whoa,” Tony muttered. “No, no, no, bad Time Fog, don’t do this.”
"How do you think?" Steve can barely make a picture out of the dots he's already connected in his head before Bucky continues. "Tony Stark."
on this. Working as one, even while separate. Tony -
She sighs again, sliding off the table. "It's like family means nothing to you."
"You're hard to forget."
"And the bomb was just to - what?" Steve asks, aghast. "To gain their attention? They took away your toys, so you
He reads through the texts, Steve's nigh-frantic retelling of what happened on his mission, his encounter with someone called Madame Hydra (really?), and then has to read through them again, squashing down an irrational feeling of betrayal when he sees the messages go back for months. Of course Natasha kept in contact with Steve. She had followed the man for longer than any of them and they were - are - close. She turned on Tony back in May just to save Steve. It's Natasha decision, too, no matter what he thinks. This isn't - he won't make this into a thing, because it isn't. The time for choosing sides has come and passed, should have never been there in the first place. "Like I said, Nat. It's smart."
"I was running Stark by then. Our companies traded tech sometimes, but for the most part the only time I paid attention to Oscorp was when their stocks were higher."
What why?
"What is it?"
"And I want to talk some things over with you," Barton says, looking at Peter but framing his shoulders so that Kamala is very much included in the conversation. "Tony and I have been discussing a training program for new recruits: a mandatory eighteen-month training period with regular evals determining competency for Active status with a minimum age limit of eighteen. Spider-Man, you're an official Avenger, and out on the streets you're amazing, no doubt, but I'd like to ask you to consider being a part of this."
"You don't expect him to stay."
“What?” Steve says, looking at him for the first time.
hates himself for doing this.
"He...wanted to get ahead of it, I guess," Bucky continues, his voice softer now. "I'd almost be flattered if I didn't think he was doing this for everybody but me."
"Oh, sister," Aamir says, sounding frustrated. "How many times have you told me your intention to be a super-hero? Accept Mr. Hawkeye's help!"
"I debriefed with the council, you can read the transcripts."
"I'll do
“To be fair to Tony, he’d be doing that last one regardless,” Natasha interjected.
"Whoa," Tony says, leaning back and batting Peter's hand away. "Do not put that voodoo on me. I'm not your father.
Tony even has Pepper on the move. While the Terrigen mist was lethal to those who inhaled large quantites, plenty of Newark only got trace amounts of the gas. Stark Industries is already funding a relief effort and Tony has his R&D labs working around the clock with local medical facilities to see if they can counteract the genetic abnormalities that have started popping up in the victims.
"So I began to speak out, and when they turned away from me, many others who saw the fragility of their vision came with me. What you see as murder I see as both warning and guidance. HYDRA was traveling a dead-end path. I would find the better one, through you. I would bring us back to our full glory."
"Because I was wanted," the Madame says. "Then later, needed. There is no better feeling, is there, Captain? Almost intoxicating. I can see it in your eyes, too. The withdrawal. So many places you'd rather be."
"Tiberius Stone on Screen 1, FRIDAY," he says with a sigh. "Let's try something I actually might be able to fix, shall we?"
Hope sniffs. "Proper first aid is important, Stark."
"Tony," Steve breathed. And this one looked even more similar to his own then the older, bitter Tony he'd met last month did, if not for the impossible sadness was ingrained into his skin in the lines around his mouth and eyes. The older Tony, the one who had fought his own Steve, had had those too. (Steve had to wonder now: was his Tony the outlier then? Was the multiverse populated by sad-eyed Tonys who looked at Steve like he was the end of the world, except for his? What did that say about the two of them?)
-" They both laugh here, though Bucky's is a bit miserable. "Only I don't know why I thought that, Stevie. There's all this stuff and it's like...all the bridges have been burned, in my head. I can't get from point A to point B."
Shuri snorts indelicately; T'Challa remains impassive but for the twitch of his lip indicating he feels much the same. "I'm glad you so enjoy our country, Agent Johnson. Would you like to meet the native wildlife?"
James merely rolled his eye, walking forward to drag Steven into him and under his arm like they had done since they were children and more. Of course, Steve used to fit quite neatly there, before the wizard Erskine gave him the Draught of Rebirth. Now, James had to reach, but that had never deterred his old friend.
Tony whistles as they assemble in the living room. "By far the best looking superhero team ever," he declares.
Peter looks over his shoulder. His mask is torn open over one half of his face and his visible eye has a sort of wild blankness. "Just like that? After - this is what he gets? You don't think he deserves a little fear?"
It's not perfect, and it won't ever be. The UN aren't quite thinking of the kind of response time a team like the Avengers needs in rapid-development situations and there's still a pesky 'loss of life' clause that Tony fears would be far too easy to abuse but he's working on it. Every day he's working on it. "Can we get make some kind of Avengers insurance?" he jokes to Ross one day, and surprisingly the man looks like he's thinking about it.
(’Why are you such a
HE STOLE MY SHIELD:
"You're right, though, Bruce," he says, and flips the folder shut. "We'll never know. Not really. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. Maybe I still jump at his shadow." He doesn't look at Bruce's face, turning back to the computer and saving the changes to FRIDAY's code, bringing her back online. He clears his throat. "Heavy moment over, please. Science now."
Then when he was finally allowed to really fight in the war, alongside Bucky and the Commandos, he hadn’t been able to stop, too worried at any moment that something might come for them. The things he had seen…
playing it endlessly until Howard threaten to burn the piano. Maria had laughed and the two of them switched to loud pieces from musicals just to annoy him.
"There's no big secret to Tony Stark, Captain," he said after a moment. "His heart's always in the right place. His brain's a few steps ahead, though. His mouth? Probably a few steps behind. Gets him into all sorts of trouble." They shared a smile at that, before Rhodes grew serious again. "Like I said, I heard from Tony what happened - but I got to hear a lot more than you did. Hindsight and all. You know those first few days the Chitauri attacked? One of their guns ate right through the first layer of the Iron Man armor. He told you about that, right?"
"Oh, God."
He laughs.
just now, Tony, about -
made those Defenders contracts with the UN - Luke and Daredevil aren't going outside the United States, there was no need to worry about them - but at the time Ross had taken advantage of the turmoil left in the wake of Leipzig and pushed hard for registration of all active supers, international or not, and Daredevil had been making headlines after his suspected role in putting away Wilson Fisk. If Tony hadn't been able to fight that, he wanted the superheroes he could protect to have as much of said protection as possible. In the end, he won, but as usual his solutions have a double-edged sword. Luke and Daredevil are safe, but what about Jessica Jones, or this Iron Fist he keeps hearing whispers about?
It was an old habit he couldn’t quite break from back in his time in the war, formed early on when his superiors hadn’t given him much to do. With the serum he hadn’t needed much sleep, and though glad-handling and lifting showgirl-laden motorcycles had been exhausting, it hadn’t been the right kind. Not enough to help him sleep.
Rhodey doesn't punch Ty, but Tony wears his watch gauntlet and taps in threateningly against the arm of his chair as Tiberius tries to explain that it "totally wasn't me, Tony, c'mon."
The silence hangs. He wants to fidget, move, do something to cover up his words and this moment but Natasha beats him to it.
"He was a genius. One hundred percent. He was never the same after his wife died." Hope stares at nothing in particular, her mind clearly very far away. "It seems to be a trend."
"You know I hate suspense, honey."
"Roger that," Tony responds. He tilts his head up and waggles his eyebrows until Rhodey looks over, then waggles them some more. "So, Carol, huh?"
"I want to sleep," Tony snaps. Rhodey doesn't hide his flinch. "I'm sorry. I'm an asshole. I just - no, no talking. Not tonight."
NATASHA:
"They woke me up," he begins haltingly. "Sat me down. They said - some words, I didn't understand, and then they handed me the file." Tony opens his mouth, then, ready to explain, until Barnes kept talking, his eyes still a thousand miles - and several years - away. "My new mission."
"Dammit!" Natasha shouts, getting up and making a circle around the table before sitting back down and picking up the phone. The death toll rises and one by one they take turns on the phone, pleading their case a thousand different ways and denied every time.
"I have already been down the hardest path," Aamir says, his eyes growing very bright for a moment before he pulls himself together. "I used to do everything for myself. Perhaps that's why I failed. But now I will do it for her. For my parents'."
I do want to mention right off the bat that while I try to keep characterization and motivation consistent I am constantly reading meta about CW that makes me think and re-think things so you may find the characters shifting (GRADUALLY) from chapter to chapter. But I also think that works for the fic: Team Iron Man and Team Cap have both gotten over their gut reactions to what happened in the war and now they're dealing with everything else.
"Just - ruminating my mistakes. You will stay safe, Tony." It is not a request.
Tony watched that hand, the care in it, and felt shame inexplicably rise up in him. “I’m sorry,” he said, and Big Steve turned, perplexed.
"Pardon?"
"Ports!" Tony told him joyfully. "For the nanites to enter and exit my body." Steve went green, then white, his eyes snapping to Tony's.
How do you deal with the really bad days?
, what the Accords stand for."
Bruce hands the phone back. "Rumor has it half the team ended up there anyway. I don't know, you tell me, Tony: was it worth it?"
“I figure building’s are the least of your worries there, Cap,” Tony says.
Donald Gill/Blizzard is a reoccuring member of Iron Man's rogues gallery and was on of couple episodes of AoS. He really was used by HYDRA and had trigger words and everything.
. "Do we? We are both very clear that I am here as an Avenger and friend, interested and now concerned about the well-being of my leader, then?"
The council, in their infinite wisdom and constant terror of public backlash, let Rhodey off with a warning and an incredibly unsubtle hint that they'd be ecstatic if he resumed his partnership with the US government. Tony would have thought the United Nations would be wary of handing over that much firepower to the US armed forces but he supposes the Avengers are still a little too autonomous for them. Now they've got Captain Danvers trundling in every weekend to take Rhodey out for test flights. His best friend is happier than he's been in months, happier and healthier and gone. Tony had promised Rhodey he'd been fine but...
"We're telling Coulson, right?" Bruce asks. "I mean, why mess with the trigger when you could just use an empty bomb?" Tony nods, remember the shell casings all over the place. "They basically handed us a sample of their top-secret formula. Why?"
"Of course," T'Challa replied, as if doing otherwise had never once crossed his mind. It was strangely cheering to see the sort of loyalty Tony was beginning to command. Steve and Tony had never had that, and Steve knows that wasn't all Tony's fault. That kind of bond works both ways and what he had achieved so naturally with Bucky, the Commandos, even Sam he took for granted in others. "I don't imagine he'll be surprised, Captain. He has anticipated this from the beginning."
"Spider-Man, listen to me," Tony barks as he and Rhodey sail over outer New York. "I know it hurts, but you've got to push through it. Open your eyes and tell us what's happening. We can't do this without you." There is nothing but silence on the line and Tony shouts "
“S’all we do anyway, wit’ him.” She didn’t have to look at her husband to hear the sneer in his voice but she wouldn’t have Steven waking up to his Da looking down on him with disgust. She stood and spun in one graceless motion, pushing her husband out of Steve’s tiny room and closing the door behind them. It was colder out here in their sparse living room. She longed to be back inside, leaning over the cheerful blue of Steve's blanket, even as the smell of death lingered in the air. Anything was better than here.
Tony looks down at his new black and gold suit, lit up all over with bright red mini-reactors. "I like it," he says simply. He thinks it covers the whole thing neatly.
"That was four years ago, Stark, and written when you had the luxury of screwing up," Nat snaps, turning to face him as well, her face smooth despite the fire in her tone. "You don't have that anymore, none of us do. This terrigen thing, have you even asked Bruce for help, or did you do it all yourself?"
He taps at the device to re-open communications and keeps his eye on Peter, a bit puzzled at the kid's tense posture, growing tenser by the second. He is focusing very intently at one of the screens in Times Square and Tony gets to his feet to join him.
"There is nothing I can tell you that you haven't already heard before. All I have is this: tonight you shall sleep, and tomorrow you will go help me go blow up some pirates who smuggled vibranium out of Wakanda." Tony drops his hands to grin up at the other man, who laid his hand on Tony's shoulder. "Tonight you shall sleep and tomorrow you will do something great. Allow yourself that, Tony."
"I spent three whole days trying to kill James Barnes. If anyone understands your reaction, it's me."
Ty gives up. "Fine. What did you want me to do, Tony, shelve it forever? Not only did that thing get me twelve million first sell but seriously, doesn't the public deserve to know exactly what kind of monster the Winter Soldier is? I mean, you were friends with Captain America, right? What was he doing, defending that guy?"
"'D be an idiot not to be," Steve bites back, because fear isn't ever what's going to get him. Steve's never had a problem being scared, not the way Tony and Natasha do. What is there to be scared of? Steve's died once, and life just kept going anyway.
Steve lifted his head, those keen eyes studying the face plate like he could see through it. To Tony. “You do?” he asked skeptically.
Rhodey huffs out a soft laugh as they watch the two boys. Yesterday's experiment failed and Donald was triggered into a near catatonic state. Tony couldn't even tell, watching him right now, playing with Peter. "Kids are dumb."
me to be on the team. You have to promise me."
NATASHA:
Bruce leaves it up to Natasha, who hunts through the keys. He leans close and claps a hand on Tony's shoulder. "You're looking better."
VISION:
T'Challa's eyes drift closed. "The way I acted after my father's death was unbecoming of his life. I had to atone for those I'd hurt and for dishonoring my king's memory. I offered them shelter from the storm."
Tony was only sure that he had never met that Steve Rogers.
"What I usually do," Steve remarks. "The truth." He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone, thumbing through the data that Natasha has sent him. Evidence of HYDRA's experimentation with Terrigen, proof that there is pieces of the super soldier serum in the formula, documentation of where Terrigen keeps failing in the body, how every iteration, every infection, has been subtly different. "Although in this case, I'll settle for corroboration. You wanted my blood, but the serum's already in the terrigen samples we've studied."
He picks up a pencil, and begins to draw.
Hindsight is a beautiful bastard, and Tony's staring at it now. He should have
Tony stops dead. "What?" he snarls.
"Maybe," he murmurs, and in the corner of his eye he spots the slightest curve of Natasha's lips. Rapidly, he changes the subject. "So, that Osborn thing? You mind lending a hand?"
"Because he could-" Steve thought of that angry Tony he'd met, with those cold eyes. The sad Stark that had just cried on his shoulder, the one who had watched (
"Well, you need someone able to herd your army of lawyers," Pepper smirks. "I think they're actually incapable of saying anything to you that isn't 'No, Mr. Stark, sit down, Mr. Stark, please, Mr. Stark, stop antagonizing the judge, Mr. Stark.' Poor things need a translator. Fortunately, I'm an expert in Stark-speak."
"Some of them will want his head on a platter," Tony says tiredly. In his mind the dream still weighs heavy. Barnes had been so quiet, sitting in that chair. "Some will want him for information. And most people are still going to want him locked up. It's never going away for him, Nat. I know that better than most."
"Did you?" Bruce snarls. "Because I don't think you did, Tony. I think you saw your chance to put things right, to redeem yourself, and you steamrolled over anyone who got in your way. I think Ross offered you a way out and you took it. The things people like you have done to people like me-"
"I didn't fight for the Accords. None of us did. I fought for a safer world for my kid, and I failed her. I followed you before, Steve, and I ended up in jail. It's not your fault -" Scott raises a hand to forestall any protests, but Steve keeps his mouth shut regardless. Scott needs to say this, and Steve owes it to him to hear him out. "But I can't do it again. I - I'm gonna go pack but I'm. I'm glad I got to meet you. All of you."
The glider slams into his side, sending Iron Man careening out into open air. By the time he rights himself the glider is back on him and it comes with blades. Sharp ones. It catches the suits side and sparks fly where they scrape along the vibranium. "Puns," Green snarls from above him. "I hate puns." The glider pushes Tony straight into the next building and the man looms over Tony, holding up his head. "So this is the famous Iron Man. I expected as much. You always were all flash, Stark, no substance."
"Who else?" James Barnes' asks rhetorically, trying and failing to sound supremely unperturbed. Tony's glad he's not the only one. "Thought you weren't going to pick up for a second." Tony is silent, still stuck in time one minute ago, when this was all just a possibility. "Listen, I'll cut to the chase: you still got a space for me over there?"
Tell Tony to talk to me himself next time. That's what this was for so we could clear the air.
Tony didn’t dare blink as he slowly nodded. “I believe you,” he whispered, and the truth rang deep in his bones. Big Steve smiled, straightening up.
-yeah
“Sometimes it’s easier to believe someone else,” I will agree, thinking of all the times he has sat me down and showed me that I had done the best I could. Or, even better, when he showed me the places I could do better next time.
Steve nodded. He supposed that was all he could do, now. Be there. Isn't that what Tony had come knocking at his door for, so many months ago? To be there, in the present, with him. "Right."
An alert chimes in his helmet, a special tone made just for Peter. Tony reaches to put it on.
"Agreed. Alright, Sergeant Barnes," Tony says, drawing himself up. Natasha is still frozen by the door, but there is a hopeful little smile on her face. It galvanizes him. "Let's make you a free man."
Tony lets out a bark of involuntary laughter. "
an Avenger." It's worth it just for Peter's smile. "People love tearing up New York. If we need you, you'll be there."
It's a mistake destroying Steve's gesture of goodwill, Tony thinks, even as he takes an unholy amount of glee smashing that stupid phone to bits down in his lab and DUM-E waits eagerly with a fire extinguisher for the last of the letter to burn down. But it's a mistake Tony is happy to make.
Yeah. he wasnt right about everything you know?
Time passes in a weird lurch after that and Tony spends it half-awake and listening for Peter to buzz him if the kid needs help. Earlier, Hope taught Kamala how to properly bandage the wound he hadn't realized he'd gotten on the back of his head but the girl was convinced she wasn't using enough gauze so now he's toting a miniature pillow on his skull; at the very least it makes camping out on this couch easier.
Falcon's shoulders tighten up under his wings. "Shit. You're thinking terrigenesis." He trails a finger across the screen. "'Contact confirmed. Tests unclear. Sending backup.' Another plant, maybe. If we can find where this was sent..."
Tony packs her onto the quinjet before Coulson can blink. Maybe it's a mistake, but he hasn't forgotten the fear in Donald's eyes.
"Like Hill didn't give you a twenty page report," Tony laughs, sitting down in the furthest chair from where the director sits. He doesn't think Fury will hurt him but he'd like to have a lot of space just in case. "And don't think for a second I didn't catch that or that I'm not going to tell T'Challa there's a SHIELD spy in his government."
“Red alert!” Jan nearly yelled, and Natasha and Sam jumped from their seats to follow her.
(Tony remembers Afghanistan, how he could never let a stutter or a stumble sit. 'What was that, Stark?' Aasif had taunted, poking at his shoulder with a heavy set of tongs. 'What was that, no, tell me, I want to hear this.' Never leave a lie half-done. It was a weakness and an invitation. Always finish the sentence. Tony can only imagine what happened to Barnes if he hesitated.)
“I started keeping bottles for myself,” he whispers. “When I was thirteen, me and Tiberius Stone racked up a pair of DUIs. Mom cried so hard when she and Dad came to pick me up, and every time I apologized, she just cried harder. She told me it was all her fault one night, sick, shaking,
. Of Tony or for Tony, they couldn't be sure. "
a kinder thought suggests.
They're not a family. But they could be.
And amazing FRIDAY pulls Bruce's formulas off the page, throws their holograms into the air and turns them into their physical compounds, surrounding Tony like the Starkium atom so long ago.
"Steve," she began, but couldn't think of anything more to say.
“…I am,” Steve admitted, and Tony looked up in shock. “My Tony and I have clashed more than once, believe me. Stubborn is a quality we both share.” Steve gave him a meaningful look there and Tony found himself flushing a bit. “But when I first came out of the ice, he was the one who helped me find my feet. I can’t tell you how lost I was before that. How lost your Steve probably feels. Be patient with him, Tony. He’s clinging to his old life, his old ways, and that will serve him well in some areas, but in others – well, I can tell you that I’m still learning myself.”
“My Steve – my Steve said that the Avengers would always come for each other if they were in trouble,” Tony stammered out. “Yours will find you. Just – be patient, right?”
"Better years?" Wanda guesses, scoffing half-heartedly. They're both too tired for the roles they need to play right now. Or maybe they no longer know their lines.
A web snags around his hand and Vision phases through him, coming out of the other side with the trigger and bomb intact. "NO!" The man shouts, his mouth a bloody foam. "You can't stop this! You can't-"
Vision emerges with a hazy Spider-Man behind him and the Avengers files into the quinjet to give their report and confer with Agent Coulson.
"Will you tell Tony?" Steve had asked him.
Steven was going to kill him.
One of Barnes' eyebrows quirk. "Me?"
"There are combatants on the field, fighting for neither side. They are attacking the insurgents. You say you are not here?"
"I do like the smell of your apple pie," Vision adds, and Laura and Hope's sniggers drown out Clint's grumbled curses.
And in the end, Tony can't be the one to take Howard Stark to task for the catastrophic consequences of good intentions. All that's left to do is what he's always done: pick up the pieces, and do better next time. Only he can't do that for Howard.
Tony laughs, shocked and abrupt. "I do," he says, when he regains control of his breathing. "And I'm...I'm proud of you. I am," when Donnie inhales sharply. "I thought you should know."
Rhodey, by way of answer, ushers Tony to the main floor. T'Challa is standing in front of the large TV, still wearing his suit and mask and refusing to answer any of FRIDAY's queries. Rhodey takes a seat with a sigh of relief and watches the pair closely as Tony sidles up to the royal. "Highness? You gonna unmask anytime soon? I mean, I know all about chafing - leather pants, never again - but it probably feels ten times worse when it's your face."
"I think," Steve begins, and then stops, thinking it through. He certainly didn't create Red Skull. He didn't create HYDRA, or Loki, or Ultron. But the last two weren't really his to claim, were they? Thor always seemed guilty about his treatment of Loki and Tony and Bruce created Ultron. "I think our monsters must already have monstrous qualities to do the things they do. Qualities that can't be changed no matter what we do to help. Where's this coming from, Wanda?"
"Mr. Stark," he begins, velvety smooth.
“To your speedy recovery,” Steve says into his ear before dropping a kiss right above it, and Tony stares at the armor and does not cry.
-Are you calling soon?
HE STOLE MY SHIELD:
“It was not stupid!” Oh, and Anthony was well on his way to being drunk if that slur was any indication. For the pain, Steven guessed. As they watched Tony drained the goblet in his hand but when offered a refill declined. “Go give the rest of that to Jarvis. He’s like to be in the same shape as I am. He’ll need it. Oh, and bring him some beer later. The Murkwood lager. It’s his favorite.” The servant nodded, more than used to Tony’s odd eccentries regarding Jarvis, his horse.
The three head farther in, trailing behind Vision, occasionally finding evidence of his presence. Coulson lets his agents pull a perimeter behind them but the army hangs back, the threat of terrigenesis very fresh on everyone's mind.
Kamala lets out a genuine giggle and Tony beams behind the helmet. A girl like her wasn't built to be miserable, and he wishes he could have spared her - her and Peter - what he went through, but he's happy to see she's getting better. "Alright, kids, time to head out." They all begin complaining at once and Tony holds up a hand. "We still don't know what your powers do to your metabolism and I am not carrying you around if you pass out. So go change and head to the kitchen. Yes, even you, Spidey, I can see your ribs through the suit, what are they even feeding you in Queens?"
It's like rewriting himself with BARF, erasing Wanda's presence from the vision, but in reverse. Realistically, he knows James Barnes is innocent. But his memories have been altered, and every smile and hug his mother ever gave him, every soft memory of his father, there Barnes waits in the corner of his eyes, waiting to take them away.
"I would be honored for a protector such as yourself, Ms. Maximoff," T'Challa says charmingly, his tense gaze relaxing a little as he dips her a barely deferential bow. "As for you, Captain, the honor was mine." Steve fights down both the wry grin and the grimace that cross his face. He knows exactly how much tension he put on T'Challa with the mission to Chad and though he doesn't apologize for and doesn't regret doing it, he does feel guilty that he put the man who has taken such good care of them in a precarious position.
Hope snorts. "I said it had merit, I didn't say it was perfect. Just - food for thought, Stark? You and your Avengers have raised a generation of superheroes, and metas are popping out of the woodwork. Whether you want it or not, expansion is inevitable."
NATASHA:
"He once used Betty to get to me, Tony. His own daughter. He's not afraid of the low blows."
"I know. It took me a long time to figure out, but being apart of the Avengers -
"Way, kid."
"Wanda is also an adult. Your friends did not lock you in a Tower after Ultron. She should have had the choice."
The kids are already in the kitchen, crowded around the island with the Barton children in between while Clint and Laura dole out sandwiches at super-speed. "Nat still in with Hope?"
"How's the decryption going, Fry?"
"Hey." He lays a hand on Peter's shoulder when the kid walks him to the door. "Come by the compound. Get some training in. I know the Avengers aren't your style yet, but it can't hurt."
Steve rears back, a snarl rising up in him. "Maybe I can't win this game, Fury, but I can damn well break the board. So answer the question: what are you playing at? Who are you playing for?"
After a long moment where the British spy stared at the ever-widening gap between Steve and Tony, he finally smiled. “Curious. Tell me, Widow, have I missed some American custom when it comes to courtship, or is Tony just inventing new ways to be terrible at it?”
Tell Stark to stop using child soldiers
Steve opened and closed his mouth before the words could make it out of his throat, and even then they came out in a bewildering tumble. "Your Steve Rogers
We need to work together on this. Convince him we won't fall apart. Convince him that he can trust me.
Maybe it can't be fixed.
There is a hand on his shoulder, a comforting warmth, and Tony leans into it. He'd missed this, while he was away.
"You saved her life," Nat corrects him. "We just need time, Tony."
"Maybe I'm just mad at myself for not figuring it out sooner," Tony snaps. Coulson's passive face finally shows a flicker of emotion as he looks to the ground to cover a grimace.
Really, the Avengers should just be called the Dead Parents Society.
The suit was streaked with grime and mud by the time he stomped into the dorms at the asscrack of dawn. Up the stairs, three doors to the left. Tony had helped Sam show Steve to his rooms. Back before Steve figured out he hated him.
"Allow me to get way harsh with you, Tai," he bites out. "Imagine that it
And he did. He
Also, my version of the Accords, which I freely admit are bullshit: The Avengers Initiative as a whole has a general charter of rules that must be followed. No going into countries without express permission, no actions taken without UN approval, etc. The second one I mentioned is what's giving Tony and the Avengers fits right now and what they'll try to fix because it's too broad and is severely limiting. Each member has individual 'contracts' under the Accords that actually sort of work out like they are employees of the Avengers Initiative, that answers to the council. This contains more detailed rules personalized to every member to allow their continued operation SO LONG AS they don't violate the charter. If they do, it must be expressly written why (i.e. T'Challa's free movement clause in his own country). Changing the contracts requires negotiation, but not nearly as much as changing the charter. Tony and Rhodes violated the charter. I am probably misusing all these terms.
But if his father - if his father -
he types to Peter.
He got Stark inside Club A and released him and his cacophonous laughter as the man doubled over. "A-li-ens. You always had a queer sense of humor, Sheriff." He reached up, his fingers ghosting a clumsy path along Steve's cheek. "I miss you," he breathed, and then it was like he had never smiled at all.
A really bad day. please.
Tony takes a deep breath. "I'm worried. Sometimes. That I'm doing this for the wrong reasons. I'm not - I know part of it is my guilt, and that's selfish, alright, bringing that into the game. I'm not proud of it. I did - I did some messed up things in the fight. But what if it's spite? What if I can't give up just because that means that I was wrong?"
"Of what?"
, goes unsaid. "Opened my eyes, a bit."
Tony's face is stiff with drying tears, stinging in the bitter wind, and his heart still weighs like a stone in his chest. He listens to Peter chatter inanely to his parents and uncle and wonders if someone had to hold this kid back from crawling in with his parents, too. He imagines so; Tony is not special or unique in his grief. But Peter's done a lot better than he did back then.
"And then, it began to eat her alive, consume her." The madness in her eyes grows brighter and brighter until it seems to collapse in on itself. "They stole her away from me. Locked her somewhere I cannot find her. And then they had the gall to demand more."
The trauma doesn't stop when the pain does, they both know that. Barnes nods, not an inch of devastation or anger on his face, just calm acceptance, and Tony suddenly,
He doesn’t love him, but he could, God, he could. He could break him to smithereens, or he could love him, or he could do both and destroy everything, but Tony Stark is not afraid, or at least that’s what he tells the mirror every morning.
"And yet you just said 'beep me,' Kim Possible." She pulls up a stool and sits herself down a careful distance away. "I have a report for you, and I didn't know if you were still tinkering with FRIDAY. I see you've left that up to Vision, though."
"No."
We might not be in Wakanda for much longer.
"His evil must be stopped," she says flatly, and Tony gives into his laugh as he turns back to his computer, typing in the rest of his notes in his ever growing Osborn file.
Aamir doesn't appear to hear him, already curling tight around his sister and whispering more promises into her hair. They back out of the room quietly.
"Tony?"
Attacking Bucky Barnes is his newest, and Tony is a bit ashamed that he hasn't worked up the same amount of guilt for that as he did for Obie and Ultron. Bucky Barnes wasn't the murderer, he was the weapon used to commit the murder. He's innocent,
Title is, as always, an in-game stock quote from Captain America.
Tony shakes his head. "I'm not going to call. I know - I know exactly what that says about me -"
"I've heard that before," Steve growls, lip curling up in a snarl. "I stopped it then."
"Consider, Mr. Stark: we make the Accords looser in exchange for tighter, more individual contracts. This Mr. Cage should not have to serve if he does not wish, but he cannot be allowed to run amok. Likewise, I must put my country first; that cannot be compromised for the Accords."
NATASHA:
"We're not starting a dialogue here," Fury finally snaps. "Your Highness, you have SHIELD's unending gratitude and a personal guarantee from me that our agents will never again cross your borders. Rogers, Wilson, you're already on the clock, so let's stop wasting everyone's time and get in the goddamned portal. Cloak!"
"He says that a lot."
-I suppose. Feels like I might be.
"We'll get you all patched up. I'm already running scans. You won't believe how strong you are. Everything's going to be okay."
“It was not foolishness, Pep,” Tony said, a genuine frown crossing his face. “Mordred’s army would not have even had those power stones if not for me. I had to fix my mistakes. Uncle will be proud of me, won’t he Mother? And Father, too.” He added, much more quietly. Margaret rubbed his shoulders soothingly.
"Then you misunderstood. I left because they were foolish, and blind to it. I intended to show the way back, to
First mission today. We lost people, but the team got home safe.
Barnes gives a sharp nod, and Tony leaves.
"You were getting better, though, before."
There is quiet all down the line until Bucky inhales like it hurts him to. "I don't think that's enough anymore, Steve." He tells the story in fits and spurts, then: Tony coming to see him, the trial that could save them all if Tony could just
"Likewise," Tony manages, and it shouldn't be funny, but there it is, the barest hint of a chuckle under his breath. His mind, which had screeched to a dead halt, is racing ahead of him now, thinking of how Tiberius will need to spin this (and how he'll need to spin Ty), thinking what this will mean for Wanda and Wilson, thinking how Barnes must have talked to Steve, that Steve knows what Tony's done.
"Just Original Computing Artificial Sentient Tactical Assistant," Tony rattles off. Kamala and Rhodey stare at him.
Tony grits out. T'Challa eyes him speculatively but Tony is saved from this nightmare of a conversation when Spider-Man comes bursting in talking loudly over an excited sounding FRIDAY.
"-to Dr. Banner's phone," Tony finishes, giving Rhodey a look. They'll talk later. "That's Cap's number. He told me to call him if I ever needed him. So now you have it. If you think he's needed, call it."
, Tony realizes. Every single one of the one hundred and thirty eight seconds Tony has been in this room Barnes has been fighting with all his might against instincts others have carved into him.
Peter seemed to seize upon this. "Do you promise?"
"As near as I can tell from the files we pulled, Terrigenesis is based off of the bastardized Super Soldier serum originally manufactured for the Red Skull," Tony relays to Natasha as they watch through the windows while Hope works on her flight, dodging Clint's blunted arrows. On the far side of the room Rhodey, Vision, and Spider-Man are working through some combo moves. Turns out Rhodey's shoulder gun is a great place for Spidey to hang his web; the two have managed to run circles around Vision for the past thirty minutes. "The kid should be on bedrest."
"FRIDAY, how many dead in Chad?"
The man went quiet, and for the first time Steve took in his appearance. Old-fashioned, pants high and rough-spun and a shirt that looked like it had once been a great friend of starch but was now grimy with grease. An unbuttoned black silk vest that had seen better days. Creased, sturdy boots with beaten laces. An empty holster on one hip and an empty flash on the other. A supple leather tool-belt. And a soft-looking, drooping moustache on the visible half of the man's tan face. He looked like he'd fallen out of an old Western serial and Steve dimly hoped that they weren't dealing with an invasion of cowboys on top of the aliens.
"Who's scared?" Tony shouted, taking a step forward.
"This is an alternate reality that you've fallen into. This isn't your world."
Tony purses his lips. "Kamala, what do you think of JOCASTA? As a name?"
One of the Dora snorts, T'Challa bats his hand away, and they settle into a comfortable silence.
You lost the bird man? Like how?!?!?
is this: trying to play Rogers is a no-win scenario. The man will figure out and he will burn the whole world down in retaliation. Fury's trying to manipulate the situation to make us kiss and make-up by relying on each other for information. He's practically goading Steve into contacting us. That's fine. I know breaking up the band has left him heartbroken."
It's a disgusting relief, not to be alone. Tony closes his eyes, bumps his forehead to Rhodey's shoulder, and then they resume their circuit around the pool as Donald and Peter begin to engage in literal freeze tag.
-stay safe, punk.
it was. Captain America - that's just a nickname the brass gave you to sell bonds. The guy I fought beside in World War II, the one who told the world to screw off because he believed in me when no one else did? That's Steve Rogers. That's who you've always been. It wasn't Cap who made you, you, Steve. It's always been the other way around. That's something I could
It was inevitable that his roommate would figure out his secret at some point in the four years they'd lived together, no matter how diligent Tony was with his clothing. Ty liked to needle Tony about it every chance he got. Tony didn't mind so much most days; after eight years of his parents' barely being able to touch him or his wrists, Tiberius' blunt-faced jabs felt a bit like a hug.
," Tony says. "Bruce recognized bits and pieces of Erskine's original, Red Skullifying formula from his work before he became the Hulk. We knew - we knew it was similar. But this. I have seen this before."
When he levers himself out of bed he aches in a way he is unaccustomed to, not even back when he weighed ninety-five pounds and was constantly on the verge of death. This ache has somehow gotten into his bones and weighs him down. The bed seems insanely tempting.
There will always be a next time with Tony. I intend to see from now on that those times are only good.
His mother once told him there was a trick to weakness; if you've shown it once then you
, you hear me? You don't have to do anything Tony, or anyone, says. You just - you keep yourself alive, okay?" He means to be strong, inspirational even, though Bucky never listened to Captain America any more than he did Steve. But it comes out garbled and strained and
, he acknowledged, vicious and victorious, for the very first time in his life.
VISION:
Bruce smiles softly. "Have you told him that?"
“Wh - over what?” Steve asked, flabbergasted. He couldn’t even imagine his fun loving classmate getting angry enough to fight a war.
to stop, and those two things aren’t always the same, so might as well end it on your own terms, right?
"Don't call me Rulk!"
T'Challa's face smooths over immediately. "No."
"It is no trouble." Still, Vision falls silent and Tony lets it settle. "I think," the synthezoid says after a long moment. "I would like to see the Sokovia of her youth. I would like to see her Pietro, how she remembers him. She loved him so much."
Donnie knows the risks, knows what he chances every time he steps into the Hulk-proof room, and Tony only broached ceasing the sessions once before the kid brutally shut that down. Tony can understand the need to know your mind is your own. It was a terrible thing the first time he dropped into a memory and found it was the vision that led to Ultron, only to turn his head to the right and find Wanda Maximoff right beside him, hand outstretched and eyes glowing red. It wasn't that he didn't know what Wanda had done to him. It was the fear that she was still there.
“Still, doesn’t mean you don’t-” Tony says, because he is good at talking, but he is not good at knowing where and what not to talk about. “What are you doing out here, anyway?”
Are you alright?
what call it?" Steve asks tightly. "I'm sure Brussels would disagree."
"You put yourself in jail, Barton," Rhodey had said back, the evenness of his tone doing nothing to alleviate the disgust on his face. "You knew what would happen and you did it anyway and all you can do is take it out on everybody else." He had looked Clint up and down with an expression that would have made Tony want to die if it was ever directed at him. "Who the hell are you anyway."
"What are you saying, Stark?"
You could tell him yourself.
“Of course.” Tony seems offended I even asked. “There was nothing to forgive.”
"You do not think they can be stopped?" T'Challa asks, brow creasing. He places a bracing hand on Tony's shoulder. "This doesn't sound like you, Tony."
"A twinge that sent you into a wall," Natasha says, waving the scanner over his shoulder and twisting her wrist sharply so the scan flies up into the air between all of them. Hope is already manipulating it before its fully settled, separating the unmarked epidermal layer from the musculature underneath.
"Not at all," T'Challa replies immediately. "They are direly needed. It is not only about what is fair to the Avengers but what is just for all of us. The Avengers as they were before were dangerous. Completely autonomous and nigh unstoppable. But this seems like such a simple matter and yet here you stand, eight hours away from hearing determining your future. I know they will side in your favor, but will they do it because it's right or because they have been backed into a corner?"
Steve knew that wasn't fair, he knew how much Tony did for them, but he couldn't help the old insecurities from welling up.
There's a knock on his door.
Stark snorted. "Won't be none of that for me. Nobody is achin' for old Stark to come home. I'll just have to chance it, I suppose. 'S the same way I ended up in Timely the first time around." Together, they approached the edge of the fog, mist curling out to tug on their arms and legs. Tony turned to him and for a moment, simply stared at him. A small, painfully sweet smile curved at one corner of his mouth. "Dream or no, I'm glad I got to see you, Rogers. One last time."
"I'll give you the tech," Tony says at some point during the flight, watching the low mountains of Wakanda's countryside ebb and flow below them. "To the BARF technology. I know I kind of held it hostage before, but to be fair, I was a bit stressed out at the time."
and when she caught sight of Tony she just clammed up, neither of them quite able to look at each other.
"I...well, I won't tell you I've learned to live with that weight, but at least I've learned how to carry it. Some of us aren't so experienced."
"Hit me."
“Tony, you just said it yourself. It was her choice to do that to yourself. Maria loved you, and you loved her. You were family. You forgave her, didn’t you?”
"I am glad to help. HYDRA is a menace that has made attempts on Wakanda in the past."
You talk so much of the team, Tony, and I believe that you believe in us. I do not know what it will take for you to believe that you are part of us."
"Either two things happen, Tony. People start getting scared and suspect everything around them and the world devolves into a kind of organized chaos. It takes a long time to recover from that."
"Why are you giving this to me?"
"Does it hurt?" Steve says, and
"Sure," Rhodey nods sagely, like all the information isn't with FRIDAY, like Tony couldn't say the word right now and be on speakerphone with Captain America.
"Tony," Rhodey says once, warningly.
But of course the super-spy picks up on the one word he hadn't meant to utter. "Trusted?"
Back in the room, the man is still babbling. "You don't meet the doctor. The doctor finds you. He finds all those who need his help, like he found me. He has been sent to us, from the glow, from beyond, to cleanse us all, to make us ready."
Steve sits alone in his room at night, flipping the phone end over end in his hand. He never used to do that before. The war trained nervous habits out of him years ago. But now he feels - not nervous, but afraid, maybe.  On the edge.
She leads him over to a couch and holds his head to her shoulder like she used to and Tony just - breathes.
Yeah he did fine.
"No biggie," Tony slings back. "You ready to head back into the city? I've got to take Kamala and Aamir out to Newark anyway." Kamala's powers still aren't stable enough to be out in public all the time, especially with the power inhibitor giving her migraines and sore muscles. Kamala's already erratic moods took a nosedive when Aamir and Tony began discussing homeschooling so for now Aamir's worked out an agreement with her teachers that she'll do her work at home until she's 'recovered.'
"No. Like I have done to him before, my honeybear has cast me out for someone taller and blonder. When will this cycle of abuse end?" he directs piteously at Rhodey, who flips him the bird. Tony smirks and turns back to the pair. "I'm taking Donnie. We've already made a pact to dissect the special effects in loud, carrying voices until the usher asks us to leave."
T'Challa laughs, withdrawing his hand. "The tech is very interesting."
It's just as much a technological and biological marvel as Scott Lang's was and has been mostly impervious to FRIDAY's subtle scanning. Or, maybe not so subtle, judging from the smirks Hope van Dyne throws his way when she's not glaring across the table at him.
Howard sat down heavily beside Obadiah, watching his friend watch his son. "Maria could hardly stand to look at him, this morning. I can't even imagine dinner tonight."
“Tony,” I say firmly. I wait until he looks at me. “You were just a kid. You didn’t know any better.”
(See the end of the chapter for
. Back then, Tony had looked disgusted with himself as he talked about it; he had been referring to how he used to keep his head and his company above water during the most dismal years of the war in the Middle East.
I don't normally ask this, but please be kind in the comments this go round. It's been a long time since I've written this, and that's on me, but I kinda had a rough time getting back into it. Criticism is welcome, just be gentle with my poor soul.
"He's here to help with Ms. Khan," Tony tells them. "We're...keeping this under wraps for now. The compound's going on lockdown for as long as Dr. Banner is here. And-" Tony debates for a second then lets it go. If he can trust Natasha, he can trust Bruce. "FRIDAY, 121691-"
"We have to find the heart," he agrees. There is Vision, in the distance, holding another body. It looks small. This makes seven, now. "And cut it out. And we will. But first we've got to find the damn thing, and that's...harder than I thought it'd be. I've been - I've been so focused on the Terrigenesis, fixing it, curing it, when I should have been-"
"Why?"
, Leighton, those are supposed to be rubber!"
"And I don't think you're in any position to try calling me out right now,
"To fix me," Barnes says. Tony opens his mouth to refute that and Barnes' mouth ticks sideways unpleasantly. "Everybody wants to."
"Oh, yeah. Once when I was five and once when I was thirteen. Dad always told people he wouldn't pay a ransom, but it didn't really matter. He had SHIELD agents in his back pocket. I was back within the day. Didn't even realize I was kidnapped the last time, I just meant to hitchhike to my friend's house."
Pretty sure that was a no.
Tony knows the truth of that all too well. "You were harboring them before. What's changed?"
(’I will,’ Tony had responded to Steve’s pleas, on an even earlier occasion. Tony had promised.)
"Spider-Man," Tony snaps. "Pull him up, now. We're done."
The formula floats on screen as FRIDAY brings up the video call. Tony can see the barest reflection of himself, his huge dark eyes sunk into his face, the sallowness of his skin. T'Challa answers more quickly this time, fully dressed and probably headed to a meeting. "I am beginning to think you miss-" The king glances at the screen and his entire face changes. Tony belatedly realizes he's still gasping and forcibly stops.
This chance is what he makes of it, and he chooses this.
. "You -
It doesn't go perfectly, but it goes. They lose two hostages and it weighs them down like stones, but those saved cling tight and whisper thanks in a language Tony doesn't speak. There is no mistrust or fear here; just the day, mostly saved, and them at the end of it.
"Who are you?" Steve says, all Captain in his voice.
He can hear himself distantly thank Hope, and head to his room, hand over his heart where the drawing lies folded.
Tony just shrugs. "Are they gonna talk back?"
“Steve will be fine. He’s stubborn, and he’s strong-” Joseph snorts disgustingly and her voice rose. “-where it counts. His name is almost in. Only five, can you imagine, and almost a full mark. That means something, Joseph.”
And it's not better. He still wakes up, listens to Rachel knocking on the door, and thinks that today is the day. He misses Bucky. He misses the compound and his bed and his shield. He misses Nat like crazy, Wanda and Viz. He's not sure he misses Tony because Tony is not someone he ever had, but he does it anyway. His stubborness is funny like that.
"You're saying my dad created a defective serum on purpose? I don't know if that makes it better or worse," Tony says after a long pause, laughing a bit to himself. "Dear old Howard and his iron fist. Always in control. I come by it honestly, see," he whispers to Bruce conspiratorially.
Vision, I've seen Tony's definition of handling and its not fun. Can you please get him to talk to me?
"Now, on to important things! Brucie, my love, you said you had an idea?" Tony claps his hands and Bruce starts abruptly before nodding and scurrying over to his computer. When he kills the screensaver Donald Gill's brain scans are waiting, with Bruce's scribbles over every free space left.
"Moving?"
“And what shape is that?” Steven asked loudly, and the entire tent turned towards him, Anthony’s face lighting up with a bright smile as the teen swayed towards him as if drawn by a string. It always warmed Steven’s heart to see such a reaction, but now he didn’t know how much was due to drink or pain.
"Lang and Barton have already been pardoned for most of their crimes, Lang's parole violation in the United States not withstanding. I was perhaps wondering if the council intended to extend the same courtesy to Maximoff, Wilson, and Rogers? The evidence used in Barton and Lang's cases would apply just as readily in the others'."
The original Avengers, protecting the earth together, always connected. Steve is running the good risk of Tony's distant indignation when the older man sees it sees it but he wouldn't erase it for anything.
He's walking through one of Donnie's more horrific memories involving a modified dentist's chair when FRIDAY relays the message.
“He didn’t have to.” Calmly, calm,
I will not be an object of fear again, Clint." Clint's eyes snap up to stare at her in shock and she smiles grimly. "I won't let it happen to me. I won't."
NATASHA:
"You're not coming with?" he asks the princess, and she wrinkles her nose.
"He what?"
Steve swallowed. "Tony."
Bruce observes him and very carefully responds "I think you're not yourself, around him."
Steve is going to break the damn television. They had been waiting anxiously for the results of Clint's trial, and Steve couldn't deny the relief he felt that there would be no journeys back to the Raft even if it burned him to hear that Clint would be placed under house arrest. The response hadn't precisely been pretty and experts were already predicting some friction with the Accords, but Steve had to trust that Clint would be safe for now.
"And HYDRA," Tony continues. He has to say it out loud. No more secrets, Dad. "HYDRA didn't use all the formula that they - that the Winter Soldier -"
Unfortunately for Steve, the universe didn't feel like cooperating with that plan.
I can see it the moment hope blooms in him. Carefully, I take the glass from him, and he lets me.
Steve looked at her then, eyes too blue, too knowing. “Is it hard, being soulmates?” he asked. “You and Da…”
There are arms around him the next moment, the first time they’ve touched in nearly two years, and Tony sags inside them. He just wants to know, honestly. Then maybe he can let this go.
But Bucky, ignoring him, continued blithely on. "Yeah, for the other. Oh! Or maybe we fight for our country, like Brutus and Caesar, defending the Empire."
Steve kills him every night.
"Ellis has me everywhere these days," the general says mildly, taking the time to shake everyone's hands over the partition. "Agent Carter, you've met Colonel Rhodes and Mr. Stark before, but this lovely woman is-"
Sam, Steve realizes too late, has been waiting for him to say something. When he doesn't the other man just sighs, taking the door opposite Steve to head to his rooms. Scott has also had enough, pausing to pat Wanda comfortingly on the knee and heading towards the kitchen. Wanda looks up at Steve and then shuts off the TV, gesturing at the empty space beside her.
"You have to. You're Tony Stark; people need you."
"How?" T'Challa asks, but there is no judgement. Tony explains, haltingly, about Donnie and the fight and the show, this thing building in the Avengers compound that feels strangely like a family, this thing that he's supposed to support but he has no idea how.
They move as one. They work as one. Tony has missed this more than he can say and he finds himself thinking that at least when Cap comes back Tony will give him a team to be proud of.
Cap just don't.
He holds my hand one night when I talk about the four times I’ve lost Bucky. (’Isn’t it supposed to get easier?’). He tells me he’s sorry another night, the night when Bucky Barnes is
"Shoot on-sight?" Clint asks, not exactly surprised but uncomfortable. "Little harsh, don't you think?"
"Mr. Stark isn't going to argue anything," Tony says, gritting his teeth. "Because that's not the argument we're making here today. Rogers and Barnes will answer for the crimes they committed in their attempt - their
"Kid," Tony says softly, and Donnie's whole face screws up tight. "If SHIELD sees you out with us - and they will, Don, they've got spies everywhere -"
, he thinks bitterly.
for that, and I bet so would he. That's why he took a stand, Tony."
Tony reads the transcript of the call and finds himself choking on a laugh that would probably end up sounding hysterical. 'What happened to the phone I sent?' Steve had asked, and Rhodey had replied 'He destroyed it. Duh.' The man is forty seven years old.
"Hey," Sam says at the doorway. Steve turns to him. "Every good team needs a name. You should start thinking of one."
built for her."
Rhodey echoes emphatically. "No negotiations."
"Anger? You mean at you. For the part where you didn't kill him."
Not later, either. He just - he just has to keep it together. He's been doing this for years and he'll do it until he dies.
"What can you do, exactly?" Daredevil says to the taller man, suspicion still in his voice but leaning forward out of Tony's space and into Cage's. Tony sees his cue and digs once more into his bag, slotting his card into Daredevil's hand.
“If you saw one of your teammates going through a hard time, if they were up against the wall, would you let them face that fight alone?”
"Pep," Tony whined, but she just waved over her shoulder as she headed away, leaving the two boys to stare at each other.
"Dagger, Cloak, fan out and take out any stragglers. Falcon, keep to the walkways, you've got eyes in the skies. I'm heading towards the vault." Steve snaps a hand out to catch the hardlight shield Fury had given him - Starktech, hadn't that been a kick in the teeth - and steps over the fallen body of the soldier he's just incapacitated. His team mutters their agreement over the comms, separating.
"You're free to leave if you wish," T'Challa replies mildly. "You are here as our guest, Tony."
Bucky said. He always had been braver than Steve.
, not for sure. It’s just a suspicion. And if he tells Tony, he could lose him, and Tony could take Bucky with him.
"I know I've been pretty shit at returning the favor," he says slowly, trying to piece this together. To let Pepper fade away would be the biggest mistake of his life. "I won't promise to try, you'd find that insulting-"
"You missed out on the part where I ran into Wanda Maximoff again," Tony answers flatly. Natasha inhales sharply and he finally looks at her. "She's fine. I'm fine. It was all fine, Nat, and we're not talking about it. We've got bigger things to worry about. Like HYDRA, and-" He waves Kamala's report. "Super-powered children. Jesus, why did we think this was a good idea?"
Tell Falcon I don't blame him.
He is sitting in the car with his mother. Not in the snow or on a deserted road, but in a parking lot outside church in Manhattan. It's eighty-five degrees out and Tony's down to his undershirt but his mother is pristine as always. Dad's outside, resting on the hood and smoking a cigar with Obie. His whole family is here, and that why this isn't real.
I don't know who gave first: me or Tony, or neither of us and we all got played, but I never wanted that. I wanted the team, fighting together against the threats others couldn't defeat, holding the line. I told them, once, that we'd fight together and we'd die together and I thought that he heard me, understood."
He clung to that, a brief shining moment when everything was perfect, but the hurt came back though like it always did, and Tony was left bereft, tears trickling down his face he couldn't remember crying. He wanted that feeling back, please. He'd chase after it for half his life.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What are you going to do, Antony?" Tiberius was so patient, a cat with a mouse, and Tony could feel himself falling into a trap but he just couldn't stop.
coming, aren't I? I mean, I've been around everyone now for dinner and Kamala said I could."
"You should," Lukin agrees, smiling down at her over his shoulder before turning back to the group. "The Avengers are needed now more than ever, and while the Avengers are based on United States' soil we need to work together. We've spoken on this before, Mr. Stark, but I'd like to offer Agent Sharon Carter as an official liaison between the Avengers Initiative and the President's Office."
"Stop saying that! Nobody knows what that means, you idiot!"
? Man and machine - You are not the suit, Tony; you're so much more than that and you don't even see it. You're too scared to be anything else."
"Mom and Dad aren't here," Kamala grits out. Her shoulders shudder for a long moment before she regains her composure. "But I'm not signing the Accords. The Avengers are heroes, they shouldn't be put on leashes." The last part she slings at Tony like a shot.
Tony doesn't know what he wants from Barnes, and it scares him. He wishes he wanted this for the right reasons, but Tony has never been a righteous man. He'll do this because it's the only thing that can be done. And if Barnes can help him in return, then maybe he can shut up the part of his brain that rages at this play-acting of the Good Samaritan. Tony is not good.
Nebula sniffed, chin tilting up arrogantly. "Your Rogers is an acceptable warrior." From what they knew of Nebula this was high praise, and she sneered at the admiring and proud gazes they bestowed upon their Captain. "His footwork is sloppy," she added, and then flounced away.
"Bucky," Steve says. Gasps, really.
I mean that the way it was is gone now. Come back before you don't fit. Stop being stubborn and look at the Accords, Tony's worked really hard on making them better for us.
"I wish he would've been mine. I wish I had taken better care of him." Tony's voice stutters all over his words, throat closing up. He loved his girl FRIDAY dearly, but she wasn't JARVIS.
He began to walk away, and the group almost relaxed at what was for Steve and Tony a fairly pleasant end to one of their fights, when Tony stumbled after him, catching his hand. “Will you at least come to Movie Night tonight?”
"So, what? This is just supposed to keep going until he ends up in the Raft?" Steve finally demands. "Or am I supposed to be happy that Tony is ready to instantly compromise on the very thing he fought with us over?"
"Pepper finally got her words in order?" Tony smirk.
T'Challa opens his mouth but it is another who responds. "And there is so very much to appreciate!" Aleksander Lukin crows, Sharon Carter standing just behind him, her face half shaded in the shadows the man seemed to throw off in every direction.
made mistakes, I know that. That's why I'm here."
"Did you see the guns attached to the Dark Aster?
"And please, kid, call me Tony."
Keep moving, his mind tells him, while Sam tells him to wait. Wait, his body begs, while Tandy tells him to move. Steve just wants to go home.
“Well, I am dying, so points for observation, Cap,” the other Tony said quietly. “My heart isn’t what it used to be.” He laughed then, bitter, a joke Steve didn’t want to understand. “They put me under for the surgery and I woke up here. But this isn’t that kind of pain. More like a pull.” He turned towards the Time Fog, watching the mist swirl. “Maybe it didn’t work. Maybe I died and this is my brain cells throwing a last hoorah. I’ve always been so creative; maybe it’s a dream after all, even you. Maybe I wanted to see a Steve I didn’t have to hate anymore.”
Tony frowns even further. "That doesn't sound right. You feeling okay, girl?" The silence stretches on, and Tony clutches the phone closer to him like FRIDAY can feel the contact. "You know what, doesn't matter. We'll do it together, alright? Bonding experience. It'll be fun."
he thinks grimly in Shuri's direction, and folds his hands together over his stomach where the flaps of his jacket will slightly obscure them.
TV-Tony paused to listen to the first half of some reporter's snide 'some didn't' before barreling on. If those some wanted their opinion heard they could set up their own damn press conference.
“Cap,” the Tony returned, and in all of their fights Steve had never heard his Tony spit out his name with such venom. “Mind telling me what’s going on?”
"We track it down," Steve agrees. "This has to end now." He thinks he hears Diamondback snort over the comm but ignores it. Three missions out and not once has she agreed with his methods. Steve doesn't have the energy but to be anything but resigned to it. The USB beeps once, the data transfer complete, and Steve palms it. "Let's move out."
Instantly T'Challa straightens, all haziness gone from his eyes. "What is wrong?" he demands.
Sarah thought.
"Come on, up-up-up!" Rachel calls from overhead, a flash of magenta hair peeking from between the rafters. "Move it or lose it! Call your birdboy and get him in here, I want some fun!"
Tony chokes it down first. He always does. "So what is it really like, out there?"
He can only imagine May Parker now, hovering at the edges of Peter's worry, dying to wrap poor Harry up and feed him terrible nutbread. Parkers and Rhodes, more than poor little rich boy orphans could ever deserve.
"Yeah," Tony answers. "Got a bigger tub out of the whole experience, too." He figures this is as good a moment as any and pulls out the phone. "This is for you, by the way. It's got a number in there you can reach Rogers by. Even managed to get it connected to WiFi, which let me tell you, passwords in Wakandan? Not easy to guess." He places it on the table, sliding it forward a few inches before stopping at the look on Barnes' face. "It's just a phone."
"You did," Tony agrees. "I've never held Germany against you. You were a kid. You still are a kid. But you weren't prepared back then for what it was like. And we face people like Cap's side every day, except those people are shooting to kill. You know, you've met a few. And I know what you've faced off against in New York, I know how tough you are. If I need help, you'll be the first person I call."
He'd make himself untouchable on the outside, even if he never managed it within.
doesn't need to be said; its right there in her voice. Tony nods, lets her have it, and starts hacking into the US government's files on the Raft's for the blueprints of Wanda's collar.
“Shield HQ has a full medical bay, just -” he offered. When the other Tony raised an eyebrow and him and his outstretched arms, he gestured up and down the other man’s body. “You’re, well, the way you’re dressed, I thought-“
Though his own name had not come in yet, Bucky Barnes was still Steve’s best friend and could not be kept away for long. He appeared on the fourth day of Steve’s recovery, and Sarah stood in the doorway with James’ mother as Steve showed him his wrist.
"Are we friends?" Tony asks, and without waiting for an answer he blasts Green in the face, slipping out from between the glider's blades. Green and Mean gives chase, dodging repulsor blasts with amazing agility. He sends Tony careening into another building with a flash bomb that takes out the HUD for about eight seconds. The impact is hard, jostling all along Tony's false sternum, and he loses his breath.
He used to be so scared of loving Tony, because loving meant leaving. It had always felt a little like a poison, slowly eating away at him. He’s still scared; he wakes up some days and can’t get out of bed for hours at just the idea that Tony won’t smile at him if they see each other at breakfast, just like there are times when Tony won’t see him because that day he’s angry all over again at Steve and he doesn’t want it spilling out, doesn’t think it’s fair when he’s given Steve his forgiveness.
"In his cell?" Tony asks rhetorically. Osborn has been held in Riker's since the attack, awaiting a trial that would surely take months and be the talk of the country.
-Not that Wanda isn't useful!
"Whoa, I didn't say stop, I think we're close to a breakthrough." This conversation will be easier if they're both occupied. Vision obligingly picks the beaker back up at Tony's insistent hand waving. "I thought maybe we could...tell each other how we are."
Peter shrugs carefully. "I remember. I'm still there, too. My parents, Uncle Ben, they're just down the way." He points to the south, down a sloping hill, before dropping his hand. "I didn't watch the video."
Peter comes by every weekend, geeks out everytime.
"Yeah, well I wasn't in the best place," Tony mutters, drawing back against his seat. T'Challa shakes his head.
Steve’s mouth clicked shut. The other Tony watched him for a second longer, then looked away. “Maybe he thinks,” he said haltingly. “That if he finds something for you, it’ll be that much easier - to settle in here, to feel…at home. Giving you an anchor.”
Scott is staring at him, his red eyes sharp and his mouth quirked down. Scott isn't like Tony or Bruce, or even Rhodey, their wits acerbic and intelligent in a way Steve has mistaken for cruelty before, but he's a genius in his own right and it's just as intense having that focus turned on Steve as it was whenever it was Tony staring him down. "I don't think," Scott says finally. "I'm the one you should be saying this to. This plan, this Fury guy? They're not going to fix anything."
a darker voice finishes for him. He thinks of Maya then, Bruce, those people in the HYDRA base, Kamala's family. Thinks that of-fucking-course Steve Rogers was lucky enough to live through that, to come out better than before.
I see him on TV all the time.
“He did. But he got all this,” Big Steve said, gesturing around.
"Yeah, that's not what the screaming people I saved from the burning building said," Rhodey says dryly. "You want me to take him down? Your suit's sparking, Tony."
Barnes snorts, the corners of his lips curving up. A weight lifts off Tony's shoulders that he didn't even realize was there. This is a good note to end on. This is a door closing; now one of them has to open the next.
He's on his feet, chair pushed away, before the thought finishes, fixing sleeves and fastening buttons, pulling his armor around him as he looks straight at Barnes' forehead. "Whenever you're ready then."
Coulson frowns, shakes his head. "Have you?"
"I'm sorry," Steve says carefully. Rachel shrugs, looking away, her blue gaze going somewhere very far away.
"What does?"
"It worked once. It could again, with adjustments. I had to try. Either I fixed it, or I found you. I would be welcomed back with open arms, regardless," she replies with a shrug. "A new world order is being built. I will not be left behind."
"Bruce doesn't want to talk to me right now," Tony says stiffly. He thought, after the video and helping Kamala, that they could go back to some semblance of their former friendship but beyond that drunken night on the couch Bruce had maintained a polite if slightly frosty distance from Tony, still trying to reconcile with Tony's actions during the war.
"You're not going," Natasha spits out.
-she speaks nonsense
Peter's uncomfortable; Tony can tell by the set of his shoulders even though he can't see his face. "I'm not a kid. Well, I mean - but I can take care of myself. You know that, Tony."
Its hand is suddenly inside him, rooting around, and Tony wails out a scream between lips that can barely move. He feels fingers wrapping around his heart, squeezing, tearing, and then Ultron is removing itself, standing up, something in its hand that Tony can't look at. Beating, blackened, glittering with metal spikes.
“Mama, y' too close!”
After this Tony will head down to his lab and lose himself in the terrigenesis and watch Malik's interrogation for the fourth time and determinedly not look at Peter's eight voicemails in his inbox. He'll drink a tumbler of whiskey and ignore the fact that the dust and grime is now so thick on the shield that the blue is getting hard to distinguish from the red. He'll take a sleeping pill with the alcohol because its never killed him before, why would it now?
"Yeah," Tony sighs. "That's what I figured." Rogers wasn't all wrong about the Accords. If it were still up to them, Tony wouldn't even be on this plane right now, he'd still be riding the high of a job well done with his teammates, and he wouldn't have had to worry about conferring with a bunch of people who'd never seen a battlefield over whether he should try and stop the masked madman throwing people off buildings. He wouldn't have to answer to anyone but Steve. Used to, that made him feel safe.
"It could be chaos, though. We do this and every kid with even a pinch of moxie is trying to take down every maniac across America. It could turn into vigilante season in a second. Not to mention," he says, thinking out loud. "Any more superheroes and New York might have kittens."
"So, what do you say?" He says, clapping hands just to hear the flat thud again. "Team All Black Everything against the Rainbow Squad?"
You and Tony are a lot alike.
Bucky is still and silent.
VISION:
"Why? I mean I realize the man was insane, but if he had even a shred of decency left he'd realize how hard this would make things for his kid," Tony mutters as he pulls on his clothes. His gaze keeps sliding to the phone.
Sharon glares at him. "You are such an ass."
"Best case, he signs and goes through house arrest for the next year or so until he's cleared for duty. Worst case, he ends up in jail. Not the Raft, but jail."
But for now he laughs with his best friend and his team, splintered right down the middle but still together; a shining point of light in a sea of darkness. Sometimes Tony thinks that maybe life isn't supposed to be like that, but its all he's ever known and even if he isn't happy, it's still
Rhodes eased. "You here to see Tony?"
"Handling it," he responds shortly. "Well, not personally. Law is boring."
“Well, inventing is kinda his…” Natasha trailed off as what Brian said caught up to her. “Wait, Tony? With Steve? No. No, that can’t be right.”
Clint's messy scrawl is next:
1. There is a Terrigen Mist in the comics that is fatal only to mutants. This is not that. At one point it was dangerous to humans and used to awaken new Inhumans, but now it's destroyed and...you know just a lot of comics stuff. I mostly borrowed the name.
Peter is quiet another moment longer, but Tony is content to wait for him this time. He changes a few lines to FRIDAY's code, building the blocks for a new command code to override her current one. Failsafes upon failsafes.
"It's a bright new world," Sharon says back, a too-sweet smile on her face. "Full of second chances, right, Mr. Stark."
When he looks over, Sam is grinning self-deprecatingly, strained. "I do know this, in fact." He tilts forward in his chair, stretching to lay his hand on Steve's shoulder. "Look. Its not just Tony, it's all of them. And it's okay to be mad at them and to miss them and whatever else you want to feel. Better you feel it now that store it up for later so it can explode all over the rest of us. And then let it go, so you can find out what's really there. You never give yourself any time, man. I oughta teach you some yoga. Guided meditation. How do you feel about ASMR?"
Steve grabbed on tight, helping Tony up. There was alcohol on the man's breath and he couldn't seem to keep his feet under him so Steve wrapped an arm under his shoulders and walked him along.
Sam said thank you.
Jennifer Walters is She Hulk in the comics for those of you that are strictly movie goers. I like her, so it was a fun cameo for me.
"Just water, kid. It'll dry."
But now, looking around the room as he explains the information uncovered by the Avengers to his own team, he can see what he didn't before. Madame Hydra's confession plays and Diamondback pales as the Madame deems her 'special,' but it is Dagger who looks back at Steve imploringly, silently begging him to say something.
"In the lab," Donnie answers, his tone an odd mix of cheerful and sardonic. Tony's gut clenches even tighter. "I'll see your eight frames and raise you eleven, Mr. Rhodes."
Back at the compound, Donald has successfully made it through one trigger word but not the other, sleeping off the Asset state in one part of the lab while their new guest occupies the other.
"Tony, you know I don't need all the tech and the gadgets, right?" Steve asked. "Just you is fine."
"Great. You need an excuse, use me."
I see. Thank you for telling me Steve.
are, I think. He - came to see me. To talk."
Steve nods, facing away from Sam but no longer looking at Bucky. Iron Man is still on the news, dark and red-eyed and new. "I can be mad at him, too."
If only he still had one.
NATASHA:
The nice thing about Natasha is her ability to have an entire conversation in very short sentences and minute facial expressions, but apparently Natasha has forgotten this skill because she goes straight for the jugular. "Why haven't you called him, Tony? Or gone to see him, since you clearly know where he is. You could show him the Accords yourself, talk to him -"
"Sure. Family owns Kronas Oil over in East Europe, came here as a kid, big shot front-lines army guy. You think he's legit?"
"Even then," Hope agrees, cutting off Tony's spiel for both their sakes. "My father didn't like them, but I could see the Accords coming from a mile away. You all should've, especially after Sokovia but - hindsight, I guess. Or maybe just hope." She sighs, letting her spoon clank down into the bowl and sink beneath the thick film of oatmeal left on the bottom. "How long will this go on, Tony?"
Now they are both healed as best as they can be but they still share a suite. It is there Kamala Khan finds them, drinking hot chocolate that Lila Barton, the utter sweetheart, is wandering around the compound handing out to the various Avengers.
Tony is the first to look away, though he immediately regrets it. With nothing to look at he is excruciatingly aware of the fine tremors coursing through his body. He is very scared of Wanda, always has been, but sometimes he lets himself forget that the feeling is mutual.
Clint looks completely dumbstruck and a little ill. Tony feels - relief. "And General Ross?" he asks one of the representatives when he's shaking his hand.
Tony suddenly straightened, looking excited. "But that's why you should have let me give you this!" He pulled out the tiny device he'd tried to give Steve earlier this afternoon. "It's an Omniwave - a multimedia device. You can put music and movies and audiobooks on here and this way it'll be at your speed." Tony powered it on and then frowned at the very full display that popped up. "Well, okay, not this one. I kinda loaded it up with all my favorite stuff, but I'll build you a new one and show you how to use it and-"
If you leave they will never stop hunting you and Bucky will never get better. Be smart Steve.
Sometimes, that’s what the Avengers feel like to him. This group that he’s supposed to wrangle together and make into Earth’s mightiest heroes, that fights together like a well-oiled machine, like Fury’s perfect puzzle, and then goes home and separates. Broken, he thinks. Clarifies
(Maybe, just maybe, it was a hand that cared too much, in too many directions, who screwed up the big picture trying to take care of the smaller details.)
“Sorry, Mama,” Steve muttered. He pulled his little arms into his chest, rubbing at his sternum a bit before letting them flop down again with a yawn, and that’s when she saw it.
Tony doesn't need clarification of who
“You were afraid I would go after Bucky,” Tony says. “That’s why you stayed quiet.”
"Exactly what we don't want to find."
Orphaned at sixteen. Jesus.
He remembers the first time he came here and realized the ground had evened out over his parents' caskets instead of the small hill of displaced earth. It was when he really got that they weren't coming back. Now the ground is well-worn beneath his legs and he is twenty-five years older but the feeling hits him all over again. They are
Sam lets himself into his room without knocking, barely raising an eyebrow when he sees Steve sprawled out on the floor surrounded by files. "Good reading?"
"-I'm not sure it's safe-"
"This isn't your world," Steve repeated. He pushed the water glass closer and Tony took a few more sips, watching him all the while. "It's a different universe. You somehow got lost in the Time Fog, but it will take you back."
Tony has to.
Rhodey is humming along. "That was ridiculous," Tony tells him, and then: "Thank you."
"Thank you," he answers quietly. "And hey, I'm sorry for implying you were like HYDRA or SHIELD, okay? That was fucked up. You're not like them." Tony doesn't reply to this, not sure how to respond. "Fuck, I'm a mess."
"Calm down, folks," he says to the room at large. "I'll be quiet as a mouse. Car?"
Peter stops and stares at him and Tony sighs, dutifully making a note on his own copy of the Accords. "Hard limits: imprisonment."
Tony dreams that night of burning pianos and Bucky Barnes' hand on his neck, his team behind glass he can't break, Steve and the shield and he dies and he dies and he dies.
Fury nods, apparently satisfied. "Agent Romanov, Agent Barton. Glad we're not having this conversation through steel bars. Vision." Clint and Vision murmur greetings but Natasha doesn't speak. She hasn't even moved from her place directly beside Tony's chair. Tony really, really loves Natasha Romanov right now.
“Bucky? Mine is Bucky?” he asked. Then he frowned as he worked over his words and his eyes filled with a terrible hope as he peered up at her. “Bucky is mine?”
"The things I saw, they were fit to drown me, so I guess I tried to beat them to it. I got drunk every night. I was your constant disappointment, Rogers; I didn't want to be. And then Fisk and his boys came with their guns and you stood in the street and called out for us
('The Avengers are your
Until: "I hate them both," Natasha remarked. Jan held out her hand for a high-five that Natasha gave instantly. "My patrol's not for two more hours, you want to hit up the new club or chase after Tony?"
Steve's mouth fought a battle between a grin and a grimace. He wasn't sure which was winning. "
Tony thanks her and ends the call. "Any messages from Hope?" he asks FRIDAY. Their erstwhile Wasp has been absent for the past two weeks, accompanying Scott Lang back home to California where he's staying with Hank Pym. The Ant-Man was nice enough to send Tony a nervous-sounding voicemail, thanking him for all he'd done getting him back to his daughter, but Tony hadn't responded, not sure what he could say beyond the anger and guilt. Lang should have never been there in the first place, never left his daughter, but he certainly didn't deserve two and a half weeks in the Raft.
something to Tony, and not once did he care. He did it without thinking. It didn't plague him at night, it never stopped him from meeting Tony's eyes. Tony's feelings never once occurred to Steve as something that mattered, and when it finally came to haunt them all he tried to keep lying. It doesn't make Tony feel angry, it makes him feel like nothing. Like he is the dirt beneath Steve's boots, like a truth that belonged to Tony more than anyone else was an inconvenience.
, he'd heard as well, and wanted to scream at how he didn't have anything left to give.
"Dr. Banner," Donnie greets brusquely, seizing the band out of Tony's hand and jamming it on his head.
, she told herself.
"Where do you want to go, Bliz?" Tony demands. "You said not to let SHIELD have you, but what do you think is going to happen the moment you step foot outside of this compound?"
T'Challa's eyes rove over his face for a long moment before he nods. "He has been briefed on your request for his blood and information on the trial. He's waiting now. Tony," T'Challa says, and his hand clenches down. "Be merciful if you can."
He doesn't mean for it to hit quite like it does but Donnie's entire frame sort of folds in on himself and the kid looks anywhere but Tony. "I just wanted to..."
His hand is on the doorknob when he pauses and dares to look back. Barnes is watching him, the ghost of that smile still lingering. "Hey," Tony begins, and his voice cracks. "Don't let their ghosts hang around your head, alright, Barnes? My parents deserve to rest."
So my favorite thing about the comments (besides how nice they were thank you all so so much) was everybody being low-key
“At least I know how to fight without a fancy suit of armor!” Steve shot back, not noticing Tony’s flinch. “At least I know how to actually live in the real world and not rely on robots to solve everything!”
