"I don't know," Steve admittedly quietly. "The scientists guessed a lot of things wrong so far. The infertility thing is pretty much confirmed.  But that's okay.  I'm a soldier" He pressed his lips together in a thin line. Did It bother him?
"I want to get back to work on the MARK VII, the non-gantry armor," said Tony.  "Can you pull up the specs and throw me a 3D render of what I had so far, Jarv?"
The omega was pulling the uniform off the largest of the guards and he realized that omega meant for them to get dressed.
Except that, he noticed, the omegas were only listed by number.  Number Twelve was previously a Miss Teen Illinois. Tony looked up to the stage to try to pick her out.  It was easy. She was gorgeous. The omegas were lined up along the back of the stage, preening each other.  Most looked hopefully nervous. Some looked miserable. Some just looked blank. Tony had the bizarre thought that it was like watching a bunch of kids about to perform in a school play.  Except no, they were getting sold, literally sold. Force-bonded.
"Steve, when the war's over, when we go back home, I swear, I'm gonna treat you different.  I swear. I didn't want to hurt you, Steve, you understand that, right? I was a jerk. I know I was a jerk.  I tried my best. But I'm gonna do better now."
"But then what? How can I have a future without an Alpha?" His voice was so small, like he genuinely didn't know the answer... but perhaps wanted to.
"...he never came back, not really." Steve finished finally, looking considerably sadder than he had before. "But Tony... Tony doesn't order me. He
Steve shuddered in delight as Tony's hands curled over his wrists and pinned him down. He could have thrown him off, technically. He was stronger. But Steve would never have dared and he delighted in the way his alpha moved and held him down.
"But if Bucky's out there I want to help him. I can't express what they did to him; he wasn't a person...it was terrifying," he whispered and brought his cup up to take a sip of cocoa. "No one deserves that. And part of me...part of will always love him, I guess. And I can't just abandon him."
"I'm in Mojave, Tony," said Phil patiently.  "Rumlow's STRIKE team will be there along with Agent Mackenzie.  Rumlow says he handed off Steve to Mr. Malick on his orders but doesn't know the nature of the assignment--"
"Good morning Steve," he nodded, holding a tea in both of his hands. He'd gotten here early. Today definitely wasn't a day when he'd want to risk being late. Happy was wearing a dark grey shirt instead of his usual white one. "How's he doing?"
He leaned forward to kiss Tony firmly but briefly then sat up. "Come on. Let's get going; I bet the others are desperate to get off of this plane, too.  And we really need to book Aria and Pepper that holiday...if we pay for it, then they'll
"Nothing," said Pepper sharply.  "...Aria, don't you have to go congratulate Jeff on Steve's behalf?"  She turned to Mackenzie. "The head of the Horseshoe Society just had twin beta girls."
Without another second of pause, Tony dragged Steve away, through a door, up a flight of stairs and into some wings and then, suddenly, onto a wide stage, and then there they were, staring out at a crowd of at least a thousand people, maybe more.  There were spotlights on them and the stage seemed too large, too empty, for merely two people.
He eyed Brazinski thoughtfully.  She was a brown-haired beta.  Her glasses were perched on her head.  Her office was plain, the decor carefully neutral.  Tony might have made a pass at her if he was drunk; she was maybe a 5 or 6 on a 10 scale, but he caught a glimpse of her computer and noted that she was running Linux for her OS, which immediately endeared her to him.
Steve smirked subtly and moved to tug Tony towards the bathroom. He left his Alpha to finish his coffee in the bedroom whilst he moved to turn on the shower.
you need to be concerned about," Steve breathed and the underlying threat was goddamn evident. There was another moment of a quiet awkwardness when no one was sure what was going to happen. Steve's hands flexed by his sides; hands that were
Tony stood still, arms out, while the assemblage locked around him.  "Naw, something a little more exotic. Why, did you want me to bring you one back?" he asked as he felt the heavy boots clamping on, the metal making him feel heavy.  There was a brief an very uncomfortable moment when the torso was bolted on, before it clicked into the power source, where Tony was momentarily weighed down by the full weight of the suit around him.  Then there was a high-pitched whine from the arc reactor and the whole thing charged up.
"You can come, but I'm not really comfortable with watching you drink, Tony. You have a problem, and you're no longer dying, or my boss. So I feel like I have to say something." He hated saying it. Steve didn't want to push Tony away from him. But he also wasn't going to ignore a problem when it was staring him right in the face and he was doing nothing about it. He put the phone back to his ear. "Can I bring a plus one?"
"So you're saying Stark Industries is a pro-omega organization?!" someone shouted over the din of the crowd.
He choked down some dry cereal just to settle his stomach, drank nearly a liter of water, used Steve's toothbrush, and finally went back to bed, huffing Steve's pillow and jerking himself off to the scent.
Sure enough, they were headed down into a second, smaller lobby; a man at a desk was chatting amiably to another man; the man and girl fell into place behind him.  The man in front of them was wearing a suit; the girl (Tony couldn't bring himself to think of her as a woman; she looked like a high school kid) was in a denim skirt and a t-shirt, looking like she ought to be hanging out at the mall.  She had strawberry-blonde hair that hung down to her shoulders and Tony imagined she looked a bit like Pepper might have at that age. On her neck was a dainty rose-gold chain collar with what looked like emeralds.
It turned out Steve liked it hard. He whimpered as Tony licked into his mouth and sighed as he squeezed at his waist tightly, leaving bruises that would only last a few hours but they would be there. Then he moved his hips again, snapping them down firmly and moaned, loving the feeling.
"I'll send you everything my friend sent me," Steve said as he forwarded the text on. "I know you were worried about her but it looks like maybe she's okay."
Steve realized, after the conversation with Gideon, that he should probably call George. He didn't manage to get through to him but left a brief but vague message. No one who listened to it would be able to tell that George actually had Donner.
Steve threw a dressing gown at Tony to put whilst he quickly moved to get clothes on himself. Just some gym shorts and a tee, but he didn't really want Donner to see him naked. It would only make the omega more uncomfortable (if that were possible). He sighed and ran a hand over his hair, moving over to the mirror to flatten down his bed hair just to give himself something to do.
Steve perked up at the mention of bath. Steve was honestly still feeling pretty gross. He'd taken a very quick shower this morning so he felt decent enough to walk around the house but that was it. They both desperately needed a bath. The heat wasn't all that sexy and neither was the aftermath. It was the preheat that was the fun bit-- Steve had missed feeling that high. It was the only real kind of kick he got ever since he couldn't get drunk anymore.
T'Challa's facial expression expressed zero appreciation. When he looked at Steve his face was impossible to read and yet Steve still felt...oddly judged. He'd certainly received a lot of odd looks during the meal itself (but Steve had been starving). He'd not been involved in the conversation much either. Steve got that this was very serious for Tony. But he just couldn't stop thinking about Donner and what was happening to him, how much pain he was going through...had gone through already. There was even a point when he must have been frowning because T'Chaka stopped mid-sentence to check he was alright.
"Huh?"  Tony looked at his hand.  It was covered in blood.  "Oh!  Right!  That!  That's fine, don't worry about that... sorry..."  Tony put his mouth on the cut.  How the hell was his palm
By the time Josephine was finished, Steve was no longer worried about strangers looking at him, and he let them drag he and Tony to and fro, fussing over their skin and nails and hair.
"From the WSC, Councilwoman Hawley and Councilman Malick.  From SHIELD, Director Fury, Agent Hill, Agent Carter, and Agent McKenzie.  And two members of the Department of Defense."
we bonded."  He ran his fingers over Steve's lips.  "How do you think Natasha keeps from going crazy, with her omega running around getting shot at all the time?" he wondered.  He rolled onto his back, pulling Steve onto his chest.  He stared at the ceiling.  "Yoga?  Valium?  Big bag of weed?  I can't see her hitting a bong but, seriously, how does any Alpha stand this?"
Pepper was delicately patting Tony's face with God-knows-what while Tony sipped at a new glass of alcohol.  His face broke into a smile when he saw Steve. "Steve. Look," he said excitedly. He pointed to the lapel of his suit.  There was a small silver horseshoe pin. "...I know
"98% of your guests have RSVP'd, 90% are coming. Music is sorted. Food is sorted. You have an appointment with the tailor tonight for a new suit-" Steve paused a moment to catch his breath. "And I booked Justin Hammer in for the 14th of June. 2089."
Steve let Phil do the back of his neck first. He winced a little, the wound still tender. Phil didn't bother to apologise again. It felt a little pointless. "Water would be great...and a blanket?" he asked tentatively.
look kind of familiar.  His face, anyway.  Tony was already scrolling through an index of omegas in his mind, trying to recall the face of every server and maid and busboy and valet and caddy he might have exchanged words with in the last week.  He was home for spring break and he'd interacted with a fair number of omegas at the club.  Over the last two years, zeroes had become a source of fascination for him.  Something about the way they smelled made him want to show off.  Case in point: he was rather glad that he wasn't wearing a shirt right now.
"  He gave Steve a quick, devilish grin, then ducked between his legs, tugging on his waistband.  A moment later Steve felt his tongue.
"Woo, boy," said Mackenzie, pulling out a hashbrown.  "That guy's the worst nester I ever saw. One time--" He turned to Pepper.  "--one time he set up in the middle of SHIELD HQ's lobby, just a big pile of folders and papers and stuff... it was something else.  I'm talking about two or three feet deep, a sort of... well, a nest, literally, nest of all these dossiers and reports, I thought the archivists were going to lose their minds."  He turned back to Sitwell. "That was before your time, I think."
act entitled to sex again, then God help me Buck, you're not getting any," he added with a dry laugh.
"...you have a girlfriend?" said Tony, eyes narrowing.  Pepper had a family and Happy had a girlfriend? He didn't like this at all.
Steve smiled a little, his expression softening. "I like the sound of doing 'mushy stuff'," he said softly and trailed his fingertips down the curve of Tony's stubbled jawline absent-mindedly.  He couldn't imagine doing anything for or with SHIELD right now; the test seemed very far away to him.  He couldn't imagine being anywhere but here, with Tony. Their connection was magnetic. A constant pull. "What constitutes as mushy stuff exactly...?"
"I told you, I can't."  Rhodes looked exasperated.  "Tony, I don't know if you've noticed lately, but the way you're acting... hell, it's enough to have a normal person committed.  I think you need to take things easy for a while.  Not think about the suits or anything, just... be with Steve, be with your omega, take some personal time."
"Well, Stark Industries has actually never made nuclear missiles, but if I ever enter a nuclear-powered car into the Prix, I'll make sure you're the first to know," said Tony, grinning and throwing up another peace sign for another camera.
Steve couldn't even really hear the alarm. He was too focused on Tony and Tony inside of him and how awesome and perfect that felt.
Nothing, he felt, could go wrong in the world, and he looked forward to his and Steve's upcoming second anniversary.
fucking Expo, isn't it?  My name's all over it.  Pep says it's one giant ego trip.  Like that's a bad thing."  He sighed, still rubbing his cheek on Steve's neck, not really thinking.  It was automatic.  He wanted his omega to smell like him.
Banksy's eyes watered.  "He's-- he's got the best team," he said.  He wrung the edge of his shirt. Banksy looked like a completely different person; his face was drawn and his eyes were red and his hair, usually in a perky little ponytail, hung down below his ears, messy and unbrushed but still straight.  "We-- we rode together here, he was looking right at me the whole time, that's a good sign, right?" He looked between Danielle and Donner. "Right? It's a good sign? His eyes were tracking-- he-- we got here soon-- he's not really that old, you know, he's-- he's so active--"
They nearly killed two people.  A lone lighting technician, and Jack the omega, who was cowering against the wall.
Tony sighed and closed the binder he had been making notes in.  "I'm better at business than relationships."
Happy was leaning against a black SUV when they stepped outside.  It was a brisk 65 degrees; Los Angeles was stubbornly pleasant even during winter.  The sun was bright and Tony squinted against it despite his sunglasses.
"They make us wear collars. They make us fetch things for them. They get rid of you if you don't behave how you like," Steve pointed out as he stood up. "I'm not saying it's as bad as that. But I'm not sure we're treated like people in here."
"Natasha!  Come off him!" demanded Tony.  "Is Clint there? Have Clint talk some goddamn sense into Steve, tell him that Bucky is dangerous, tell him--"
"I'm Tony goddamn Stark," said Tony with a shrug.  "If you're not into it, just say it.  It's not rocket science."
Dr. Gleason looked up briefly.  "...well.  That statistic is very likely padded by the amount of domestic violence male omegas face.  But yes.  About two out of three.  For female omegas, it's fifty percent, and for betas, about twenty percent."
Steve rolled his eyes. "He doesn't even know who I am Nat. I'm not playing with him like that. You know he doesn't even think I exist, right? Thinks Cap was engineered by a load of guys running around in the same suit and shield."
"Welcome back to the world of the living," Natasha teased. Steve straightened up, his head having been on her shoulder. He then blinked and rubbed his eyes.
Tony realized he was clinging to Steve rather aggressively.  He loosened his grip.  "Steve," he murmured softly.  He leaned in to bite Steve's ear gently, giving it a playful little tug.  Steve was the best thing that had happened to him in a long time, even though he was dragging Tony into this mess with SHIELD and HYDRA and all the other alphabet-soup agencies of the world.  It wasn't like Tony really had anything else going on, anyway.  He'd thought he was a goner.  If not for Steve, he would probably just be kicking around the house, pestering Pepper with phone calls and building new suits.
"It's... it's not us, though, right?  Me and you... we're good, yeah?" he asked hesitantly.  "'Cause that's all I really care about, Steve.  I thought I would be dead by now.  But I got a new arc reactor and a second chance and... and I'm really happy that I found you and you let me mate you.  I feel like everything is going good... better than good.  I'm happy.  You're happy, right?  The last couple of weeks, they've been amazing, yeah?  We're good?  As long as you and me are good..."  He trailed off.  Steve wasn't quite meeting his eyes.
He smelled like comfort.  Like home.  He wanted to run to him.  It made sense, that Death personified would have such a smell.
"Thanks, Steve," he said in a low voice.  He decided not to add the weird flashback... Tony had never fought in the trenches or worried about mustard gas.  He knew those fears weren't his and it turned his stomach to know that he had a connection to Steve's old mate.
He settled for black slacks, a white shirt, and an electric-blue jacket that had a conveniently high collar at the back. His neck wasn't even healed yet. And the thought of people taking pictures of it and pointing it out in the news, that made him feel sick.
Dr. Martin frowned.  "The effects of getting injured over and over again in that suit can be cumulative.  You may feel fine in a week, but you have to consider the long-term consequences on your body.  Frankly, humans aren't designed to sustain the kind of trauma you put yourself through."
"Just because everyone knows you're corrupting me doesn't mean people want to think about it," Steve pointed out quietly. "It's like the queen of England - everyone knows she must take a dump now and then but by god no one ever talks about it. It's my job to embody virtue - or at least it was before. But then...thinking back I kind of hated that stereotype if I'm honest."
"Love the look, classic, Steve, you look great.  I threw the Mark V in the trunk.  You wanna drive?  I'm going to go ahead and bring some scotch, I'm feeling pretty energetic, maybe it's this coffee.  Great coffee, by the way.  You know sometimes I like to throw a few shots in there and call it Starkbucks.  Steve, hurry up, you're making us late."  Tony checked his watch.  "Are Clint and Natasha going to be there?  ...does everyone have to watch the psych eval?  I mean, I'm not worried, I think it'll go great, obviously, I just... just want to know, that's all, it's good to know. knowledge is power, Francis Bacon said that, you know, bacon would go great with these pancakes, man, I love strawberries, Pepper never used to use them for some reasons, it was always blueberries with her..." Tony continued as he loped down the stairs.
Tony offered Steve the remote and curled onto the couch, setting his head in Steve's lap.  He gestured lazily.  "Whatever you want, Steve.  I just want to-"
"We...met through SHIELD," he said.  He tried for a smile.  "Come on, Mr. Pierce, you're on the World Security Council.  I'm sure you know better than anyone how we met."
.  I've only had four heats before," admitted Piper quietly, her pale skin flushing even deeper.  "I guess I was a late bloomer... heh. I, um, I had one with Eric before though but we didn't, um, I didn't get, y'know."  She looked down, fiddling uncomfortably with all the little bracelets on her wrist.
Gideon's eyes darkened a little.  "Don't think I won't kill him to get what I want.  With him waking up twice a year, I could very,
"Hey man! Looking good," Sam clapped a hand on Steve's shoulder as he stepped inside, the jet door hissing quietly as it slipped shut behind him. "I like the uniform. Not
He sucked in a breath when they got to the graves. Steve frowned a little. It was so strange to see Howard's name there engraved in stone. It made it so much more real- that that the ladies man Steve had known, with the shrill laugh and the charming smile, was gone. He thought to the vision Wanda had given him where Howard had been taking him dancing and a strange sense of eeriness washed over him.
Tony rolled into the spot Steve had just vacated, pulling the blanket with him, burrito-ing himself in Steve's bed.  He opened his eyes lazily, stared at Steve with glassy, unfocused, mumbled cryptically "The blast radius is
"Yeah, well, I like how you don't get emojis or Garfield or James Bond.  And I like how you've got a little ring of gold and green around your pupils.  I like when you get excited and start
"It appears the reactor has accepted the modified core, yes.  All functions are nominal; energy output is steady.  Congratulations, sir."
"Captain America." One pointed their gun at him, looking between him and a naked Winter Soldier warily. "We're going to escort you back to your ce-" He grunted as Steve's elbow  made contact with his face. The other two made to intercept. Steve twisted around and grabbed the first man's gun, slamming it against his forehead to knock him out good before he fired a shot into the other's chest and--
"Confirmed, one injured.  What's the nature of his injury?" asked someone on the other end of the walkie-talkie.
back rubs, don't you?  This, us, cuddling... I'm not just imagining that, am I?"  A pause.  "Why don't you take suppressants, Rogers?  Since you're, you know... since you can't mate and don't want an Alpha.  Wouldn't it be easier?  I mean, what happened on the plane..."  He let the question hang.  He suspected what had happened on the plane was equally embarrassing for both of them.  He wanted to ask Steve, just like he'd asked Pepper and Happy, if that was a normal reaction, why he responded so dramatically to Steve.  But he didn't.  He felt awkward, like he ought to know already.
Tony felt hurt, and angry.  He had started to think of Steve as a friend, and Steve had been playing him the whole time.  He'd been... what did they call it... he'd been honey-potted.  Yeah, that was it.  Steve was a honey pot.
Fury turned and stormed off, knowing he'd expected too much in thinking Tony's question would have been a serious one.
song!" protested Tony.  "That song's so goddamn sad, it's on my 'Drunk and Wallowing' playlist.  You might as well sing
"Okay.  Steve. Listen," said Pepper, turning in her seat.  "There shouldn't be any reporters here, but remember, you still need to watch yourself.  Every celebrity here has a Twitter and an Instagram and Snapchat and so forth, so act like everyone you talk to is a reporter and make sure you're tactful.  Also, don't let Tony drink anymore. If you can help it, anyway."
"Sweet.  Let's do it, then," said Tony cheerfully, stopping through a carefully maintained hedge toward the cliffside.  He strolled off it and went into a dive; his heart pounded with excitement and he felt the usual rush that accompanied the split-second before he felt the drop in his stomach indicating he was in free-fall, trusting his technology to pull him out of it before he splattered all over the ground.
"I suppose we could have Stone or Germaine come here..." mused Aria thoughtfully, tapping away at her phone.
"Bingo.  Obviously, the omega needs to know what's in it for them to behave.  Personally I recommend pressure points. The three basic pressure points on an omega are over the arvicolina, on the back of the neck, and on the two scent glands just behind the ears, near the junction of the jaw and the skull."
Tony let out a sigh and looked down, twisting his hands in his lap.  Tony was no good at talking about feelings and he hated it when his hands were idle.  If he wasn't working, then at least he liked to be turning a Rubik's cube or knitting (something he'd sworn Pepper, Steve, Happy, and Rhodey to secrecy).
"It's okay," said Tony softly, hoarsely.  "My omega. It's okay. You did good." Under his fingers Steve was trembling and he felt... weak.  It was disconcerting, seeing Steve so utterly broken like this. Tony felt guilty and confused because this wasn't Steve, or at least, not the Steve he was used to.
They bundled into the car. Steve grabbed a carton of fruit smoothies from the fridge to drink on the way. Happy put the radio on for them before they set off. Steve was oddly nervous. They wouldn't refuse them, would they? The ankle brackets were stupid... Steve had already proven they were very easy to break.
And now that Tony was ordering him, and not asking, Steve was definitely getting more turned on. The fingers down his spine made him shiver but he resisted the urge to squirm. When Steve had said he wanted to be good for him he'd meant it.
"Mr. Rogers?" called the beta who was acting as the bouncer for the closed-off omegas area.  He gestured for Steve. "You're going to have to leave this area."
"...I dunno... I think so..." said Tony, turning to look at Malick.  Malick had a hand on the small of the other man's back. "...he doesn't look that much like you, though... I mean... he's blond, but that's like, half of all omegas, right?"  The omega turned suddenly. The resemblance was undeniable; the man looked like he could've been Steve's brother. Tony cringed. "...I'm sure that's just a coincidence." He was mostly saying that for Steve's benefit.  He didn't want to think that Steve might be Malick's "type," although it would explain a lot of the hostility that Malick seemed to harbor against Steve.
Tony reached for his hand, placing his over Steve's.  "Pepper's always worried.  I'll call her back after breakfast."
Steve took the phone she offered and scrolled through the tweets, eyes widening. It was still scary to him how quickly news could be born in the 21st century. It happened two minutes ago and now thousands of people were seeing it. He knew what Tony had said was not
"And we have to see the security council to get our feet freed up," Steve hummed as he pulled off his top and dropped it on the floor before letting the rest of his clothes follow. He paused when Tony drew the heart in the glass and smiled before moving to get into the shower with him. "I was hoping we might be able to go away somewhere," he said, reaching up to wipe a line of soap suds from Tony's forehead. "Aria found a cute place in Sweden. It has these cabins in the woods, all decked out, for couples and stuff."
"Tony, why is there a child in our kitchen?" Steve asked, rubbing at his left temple as he stepped up to the counter to find his coffee already made. Huh. He reached out for the mug almost cautiously, still staring at the omega at their stove.
He slipped an arm around Steve's shoulders, letting the omega slid down into the bed.  Laying down was one of the few circumstances where Tony got to feel taller; he loved when Steve rested his head on his chest.  Steve was one of four people, ever, who had touched the arc reactor, and in a way, Tony had almost come to enjoy it. He would have been comfortable placing the thing in Steve's hands.  It had become routine for Tony to pop it out and clean his chest socket during their morning showers, and Steve no longer showed the slightest look of surprise or disgust, which made Tony feel warm and normal.
"You feel frustrated," Steve commented as he traced his tongue down to the hollow of Tony's neck. "Why?"
(Peggy was never impressed when Steve gave her shit (teasingly) for how small the country actually was.  "Two hundred miles, that's a long distance for you guys, huh?" Steve had once said teasingly after a particularly rough rendezvous.  "Two hundred years is a long time for
He glared at Steve, shaking with barely controlled rage.  He was pretty pleased he'd managed to get all that out as eloquently as he had, considering how thick the pheromones in the room were.  His body was screaming at him to just
"Watching what?  I've been cleaning my face.  The fucker bit me," said Tony.  (He didn't add that he was certain he'd bitten Hammer back.)
"It's already been more than twelve hours, Donner.  Can't you hurry up? My mate needs to get to bed," groused Tony, who hadn't left Steve even to use the bathroom.
"...I asked if you had a pen for the coordinates, Steve," repeated Natasha.  "...are you okay to pilot a plane? I know I've already said this a couple of times, but these coordinates are top-secret, okay?  SHIELD doesn't have them and we'd like to keep it that way. And don't share them with Tony. Literally only a handful of people know this place exists... well, you'll understand when you get here."
"That your bond is exploitable," said Coulson with forced patience.  "The Winter Soldier is an Alpha.  You're an omega.  We'd expect you to see Stark and for Stark to be possessive.  But for the Winter Soldier to show up, unprompted, and call you
Ty waved a hand.  "No, no, June's fine.  The one-year anniversary would certainly have the most impact.  Let me touch base with the others and we can get together and see about getting this thing off the ground.  It would be good for the kids to have somewhere to go."
The device was on and it was loud, louder than a jet engine, rattling ominously.  Tony stood by the stripping chamber, holding a large prism in his hand, waiting for the right moment.  He had one shot.
Dr. Brennan seemed shockingly low-key after all of Fury's doom-filled statements about the state of affairs.  It was difficult, of course, to really know what was happening on the outside. Steve's room didn't have a television or a radio or even a newspaper for him to read; that was probably on purpose.
.. when I smell you... I want more than that.  I want to... to protect... I don't know.  I want, like
Pepper looked thoroughly alarmed.  Tony wasn't merely distracted, but dangerous.  And he wasn't even anywhere near Steve.
It was weird to think Peggy was Tony's aunt whilst she'd... kind of been Steve's crush. They'd both liked and respected the hell out of each other. But Steve's old mate had only just gone missing and they were fighting a war. Perhaps if Bucky hadn't been on the scene and there hadn't been bullets flying, things would have been different. But timing wasn't kind to them, and it didn't matter in the end anyway. Either way, she'd apparently had a significant impact on their lives. Steve could still remember her voice as he went down in the plane, as vivid and crisp as if it were yesterday...he wondered if she'd be well enough for a dance now. Steve could still remember the steps and he was sure she'd appreciate the humor in it. But the walks around the garden alone had tired her out so much...
"I'll get it.  I have a gift card my sister gave me.  No biggie." Cece got him a coffee. Bucky sipped it gratefully, still shivering.  "So," said Cece, stirring her coffee. "Why did you ask me out?"
"...would you really... wear a thing for me?" asked Tony, looking up at Steve, who was finishing off his apple.  Somehow, he managed to make even the simple act of eating an apple attractive. Tony would normally lose his mind at someone eating fruit in his room, which was mostly white, because Tony abhorred stickiness.  But with Steve he didn't mind so much.
He grabbed his pillow and weakly bopped Steve with it as he nuzzled his cheek. "Waffles.  Blowjob," he mumbled half-heartedly, not wanting to move. He did this often, fucking up his sleep cycles completely by staying up for a day or two and then crashing all day and waking up in the evening.
"Coulson," she corrected, striding across the room.  "I'll take care of him; we have a flight booked for this evening; Tony, do you need to go to the hospital?"
Steve watched Tony curiously and the moved to break the cookie in his own hand. He tried a piece of the biscuit and hummed approvingly before he stared down at the paper.
"I spent like forever telling Tony I wanted a monogamous relationship. I think I would look a bit of a hypocrite now if I turned around and said otherwise..." Steve pointed out tentatively. He hadn't even considered the fact that he could technically have two Alphas...but Steve would feel guilty for it. After Yemen especially, Tony wasn't keen on sharing him.
Steve blinked, his vision fuzzing at the edges. "I hate the WSC," he murmured. Brock laughed quietly.
Unlike in betas, Alphas' and omegas' statuses superseded their sexuality.  It wasn't considered strange for an Alpha to bond with either sex so long as they were an omega; after all, any omega in heat was desirable.  This was one reason trios existed; Alphas who bonded to the same sex but considered themselves straight often sought out a partner of the opposite sex.  And it wasn't especially weird, at least in the twenty-first century, for two omegas to share a bond; omegas who were close tended to cycle together and, if they were the type that nested, they would often nest together, which was considered extremely intimate.  But two Alphas bonding was a rare event and had long since taken on the same connotations as homosexuality, complete with the same prejudices and slurs.
awful.  It was seriously one of the most bitter things he'd ever tasted.  Was that normal? Who should he call about this? Pepper? Nadine?  Dr. Gleason? Who the hell would know what Steve was supposed to taste like?
Tony regarded Steve thoughtfully.  Steve's words, about not loving him as much as he hated himself, had rung true, much louder than made Tony comfortable.
If Natasha and Sam came back Tony might kill them. Tony had dropped those guards so easily, after all; he was still in the suit, still dangerous. And Natasha, at least, didn't have the best of armor. She chose speed and dexterity over defense. The jolts of pain were helping to keep Steve sane, or a little more sane than Tony. He just kept reminding himself that this should last ten minutes, and then it would be over. But would it last ten minutes for Tony? Would it go away?
"Well, what good is being your godmother if I don't get to embarrass you in front of your mate?  ...I found some old baby pictures--"
He and Wanda exchanged a look.  They had discussed, briefly, what the hell to do with Barnes.  He had taken the two of them to a motel and now the three were together.  Wanda and Pietro agreed they couldn't go back to HYDRA. They had gotten what they needed.  They knew Wanda could access Stark through Barnes, which was good enough for them. Besides, they both thought it was dangerous for them to stay any longer.  HYDRA's treatment of omegas, their inducing of a heat, and their casual treatment of people as pieces of equipment made both of them wary, mostly on Pietro's behalf.  But they had worried that having Bucky with them was a liability; Bucky sometimes acted like a child. Except he was a child in a man's body and had an arm capable of crushing other men's skulls.  He was unstable and dangerous. But he was their only chance to get to Stark and besides, they felt sorry for him.
"...you'd think most of these guys would've figured out sex by now," said Tony with a wolfish grin.  "And no, you're confused. Missionary is how you have sex with your
!" shrieked Tony immediately, tearing into the room and knocking over the second chair.  They'd made him take off his armor but he was still looking fairly intimidating, despite the full beard, MIT sweatpants, and wifebeater that smelled like engine oil.
"I think maybe you have PTSD. Okay, so I know you shouldn't Google stuff-- according to WebMD, you apparently have five types of cancer--" She shrugged. "Whatever. But all this reckless self-destructive shit, self-esteem, self-sabotage. It's
"No?  Ever since '86, he's been... off.  Now you send him after another person known to him, you think that won't compromise him even more?  For all we know, he let him get away.  The men who were there to witness it are dead."
"Yeah, so what?  Aren't most hernias in your groin?  That's why they make you turn your head and cough, isn't it?"
an amputee.  The last thing she wanted to deal with now was yet another realization that he had lost his left arm.
He pushed a bowl of pasta towards Tony. It was bacon and cheese and leek. He'd already eaten himself.
"Four hours, maybe," she said, leaning against the doorway of the cockpit, staring at Steve.  Her ears were turning pink.  "I can't believe I'm flying a plane with Steve Rogers.  You know that was my childhood dream?  My whole life?  To be a pilot, like you?  Wow."  She shook her head and laughed a little.  "I- I had no idea you were an omega."  Her ears flushed darker.  She bit her lip.  "Would you mind... er... if it's okay... can I have your autograph?"
"I just went to... grab some more juice," said Tony, even though Steve hadn't asked.  Tony set the carton down by the empty one; his gaze fell on the pamphlet that Gleason had dropped off.
Steve grabbed the tin of water gratefully and downed it. A little dribbled down his chin but he didn't care. He sighed in relief as the cool liquid slipped down his throat. Steve closed his eyes as he leaned his head against the glass.
Steve imagined that Gleason had repeated that speech a lot through out his life to many different Alphas. He knew that Tony's probing came from a place of concern on his behalf, but Gleason had to no doubt deal with many skeptical Alphas who questioned his credibility all the time. His confidence was reassuring. Steve offered Tony a small smile before he moved to sit down, Gleason standing as he did so.
"You boys are supposed to be taking a break!" Pepper let out a noise of frustration. "But I suppose, if it'll make you happy...I'm sure they use very good caterers," she sounded sarcastic but it was genuinely Steve's idea of a good time. Free drinks and food, all whilst undermining the Alphaocracy and hanging out with some, what he was sure would be, lovely omegas. Maybe he could take them on a night out or something, away from their Alphas.  Convince them to be as "unruly" as he was. Oh, that would be hilarious.
Steve hadn't even realised he'd been shivering. What was that about? He didn't have a heat due and he wasn't sick; there was no reason for him to. Steve stood quickly, eager to warm up. He didn't like feeling like his body was betraying him. Growing up he'd been at war with his body, his entire existence just a fight to survive. Now Steve shouldn't have to worry and he shouldn't be shivering.
"Captain.  Mr. Stone has arrived," reported JARVIS at precisely nine-thirty.  Steve had just finished polishing off a carton of eggs and a half-package of turkey bacon.  "...and Mr. Stark requests bacon. He has advised me to warn you that he might be suffering from starvation."
"I was told we were protecting him," offered Rumlow.  "...don't want another Yemen incident, after all."
"Yeah, he did," snapped Tony grumpily.  "Whenever he got drunk, which was all the time, it was Captain America this and Captain America that.  'He's the best thing I ever made, the only good I ever brought into this world.' Great thing to tell your only son."
He signed all of them carefully, as Richard Emmett, hoping that Tony was watching and would get a "Richard Emmett" into the national database before Gene Bennett realized he was faking his entire history.
"I didn't," said Pietro.  "I've been looking all over for you since I heard about the fire.  I'm just very fast. What did you do that for?"
Peggy, who looked awfully proud of herself, pushing Tony's up towards him. "Come on dear. Drink up."
A woman in cat's-eye glasses and springy hair suddenly shoved between them.  "Hi, Mr. Stark, my name's Annette with Vanity Fair. Can I borrow you for just a sec?"
His hands were shaking, his knees were weak.  He felt himself sliding down to the floor like a raindrop; a moment later he was curled on the floor of the phone booth, arms wrapped around his knees, shaking violently.  He let out a small, weak keening sound.
"I'm going to turn in early," said Tony, untangling himself from Steve.  "I'm on a health kick for the next week to make sure I pass that SHIELD field test with flying colors.  Don't worry, though, I'm over chlorophyll smoothies," he added with a grin.  One week of rest and healthy eating and training... it wasn't a lot of time but it was better than nothing.  Tony had every intention of going in there and giving them hell.
He reached up the rub the collar of the suit with his gauntlet.  Beneath the armor, the scar on the back of his neck tingled, and he looked away, anxiety coursing through him.
The two men stood by while Steve chatted.  Tony wouldn't let go of Steve's hand, so in order for the two of them to have separate conversations, they were twisted at a weird angle, like in some sitcom where two characters had been accidentally handcuffed together.
"We should eat something," Steve mumbled against his skin. "It's too early to sleep..." And yet sleep was tugging at his bones anyway.
"Mhm. Definitely." Steve didn't really have to deal with post-sex soreness all that badly. The serum always dealt with it within the first twenty-four hours. He smiled. "Don't gotta worry about me struggling with keeping up," he pointed out with a playful wiggle.  "But I'll try a massage.  I've never actually had a massage in my life," Steve admitted. During the Depression, shockingly, the opportunity had never come up.
"A quarter-million a year with full benefits and all incidentals covered," said Pepper.  "And normally he's not quite this bad. ...I'll see if Happy is willing to take them up, it's about two and a half hours away."
It also occurred to him that Steve's words about war being awful were the words of a seasoned soldier, one who had actually fought and killed and been shot at.
He had to admit, the massage had worked a dream. Steve had never felt so relaxed in his life. And he'd never realised, before, just how goddamn tense he'd been. He finished devouring a terrifying amount of food and then moved to get dressed so they could go out. It was just a museum so Steve stuck with jeans and a t-shirt. And a coat, because England was freezing.
He wasn't getting anymore wet like this and Tony big and hard inside of him was getting increasingly painful. Steve swallowed. He needed to get turned on, fast, or Tony needed to get out of him. He couldn't deal with this. Steve couldn't help but feel like he was letting Tony
Aria frowned and reached out to touch Steve's forehead.  She had to stand on her toes to do so because of his height.
Tony. They might be trying to recreate the serum in there and we need to know how close they're getting.  They might have records of the Winter Soldier that could lead us to him.  They might have contact information for other bases that we could use to-- look, there's a ton of intel there, and tt could  be anything. We are not just blowing it up. And I'm not going in there by myself, Tony, I'll have an entire
He knew he was missing a lot of context here.  There were at least two important players in this narrative: Bucky Barnes (deceased) (maybe), and the Winter Soldier (whose existence toed the line between questionable and mythological). Why was Steve's brain getting the Winter Soldier and Bucky Barnes confused?
want?"  He felt inexplicably angry at Fury for being a beta, for not having to deal with these sorts of complicated problems.
"JARVIS, can you turn on the air conditioning?" called Pepper; Steve was sweating even though everyone else in the room had doned sweaters.  The air conditioning was already on but it wasn't doing much good.
But then another figure followed. Despite the grainy image, his silver arm was evident as he made the jump after Steve.
Steve burst out laughing and rolled onto his side. "O-okay...sorry. Just. You pointing a dildo at my face is pretty funny," he said, grinning. It was hard to take Tony seriously with a bright pink dildo in his hand. He was glad they were laughing again. Laughing meant they were okay, or that they were gonna be okay. That's how Steve saw it, anyway.
Steve spent the evening destroying a series of punching bags. He got through six in total and his knuckles got sore after he became too lazy to wrap them properly between each bag. But it didn't matter; the pinkness would be gone by the morning.  Just as drinking scotch couldn't get him drunk, physical exercise had only a fleeting effect on him, and he could never quite work hard enough to entirely forget the things that plagued him.
"It goddamn better be Avicii," said Tony with sudden conviction.  "Where's Pepper?  Pepper!" he yelled.
"What does Bennett look like?" Steve asked, trying to focus on what was important here. DeSoto obviously didn't like answering his questions as much as Tony's, but he still did it.
Trey's brothers, both huge Alphas, were dutifully mixing drinks, while Trey perched up on the counter, cracking his knuckles.  "Bet you didn't have parties like these back in the old days, huh, Steve-o?"
Steve turned away from them, pressing his forehead against the cool stone wall and dropping his goggles onto the floor. Fuck. He should have anticipated this, he should have known they'd use this against him.  Sure, they could induce heats in the forties, but with something as simple as a dart. It was a complicated process couples would go through when they wanted to time conception well to have a summer baby, or whatever. They used to put people in steam rooms and pump pheromones into the air for hours. In Steve's time, inducing a heat was difficult and expensive and time-consuming.  This had taken seconds.
"I don't have the tights," Steve shrugged. "Don't think they would have lasted 70 years. I went through about one pair a performance." Steve was always told off for moving around too much, or sitting with his legs too wide. 'Don't sit like an Alpha' they used to tell him.
.  There was a very subtle, faint oiliness on Tony's fingers (gross) and Steve smelled incredibly enticing.  Not smell so much as taste-feel; pheromone sense was difficult to communicate to betas.
Relief washed over Steve.  He had been hoping for someone to do this, introduce him to other omegas.  He followed her, glancing over his shoulder at the rest of the lobby, curious as to where Tony was.  He wasn't at all surprised to see him hunched over at the bar.
"It's an office, of sorts. That's where we going. It's like... a half-hour drive from here.  Downtown. And before you accuse me of throwing money at something, I just rent the space. Everyone involved is a volunteer." Steve couldn't have ever afforded that many lawyers. Maybe with Tony's help...but that wasn't the point.
He had a thick folder under one arm.  Tony wasn't just here to make a point.  Tony wasn't a guy who liked making points.  Tony was a guy who liked taking actions. As far as he was concerned, theirs was an intelligence-gathering mission.
He had been hoping Clint might supply him with some sort of reassurance, perhaps, that his and Steve's bond was safe and that there was an easy way to prevent any unwanted surprises.
"Very good... thank you, sir... hail HYDRA."  The doctor hung up the phone and turned to the asset, smiling.  "Well, aren't you lucky to see another day.  And I get some dentistry practice.  So it looks like everyone's having a good day... except Pierce."  He chuckled a little and crossed the room to pull open a drawer and grab an armful of instruments.  "Come on, now," he instructed, jerking his head.
"...I think we're okay," he said quietly.  It was more of a hope than a thought.  But it wasn't like Steve could reveal anything worse than the partial bond he still had with his old war buddy, right?  No, learning that Steve was already bonded to another Alpha was literally the worse thing Tony could think of, the greatest betrayal.  There was nowhere to go but up.
"What the hell's that?" asked Tony, trying to recall.  He'd never heard of it. "Like, what, a predecessor of the AIM-4?"
"A lot of Alphas make the mistake of trying to control their omega before establishing that there is a reward for good behavior.  That results in a nervous omega... one who wants to avoid punishment instead of trying to please you. Don't confuse being firm with being cruel."  She pointed to Steve. "Your first Alpha withheld affection, didn't he? I'm guessing you never felt good enough, did you? Your attitude is classic... you were spoiled and indulged but you were never treated
He grabbed the guard that hadn't been shot, since he felt the blood stain would be too conspicuous, and dressed with military efficiency, his shirt buttoned and his shoes laced (one size too small; unfortunate) before the omega was done.
"Naw.  I only ride in cop cars if I'm in the back," said Tony.  This failed to get a laugh from her; he frowned.
"No.  It wasn't PTSD, if that's what you're asking. I don't know what it was.  ...I'm not even sure it was mine." Steve murmured shook his head.
Tony was worried SHIELD wouldn't want him now, not after this fiasco.  So far he'd mostly caused them trouble.  In the past he would have enjoyed stirring things up, but bonding had caused him to leap about ten years forward in maturity.  It wasn't just his own life he was toying with anymore.  Steve was a part of it and Steve was a part of SHIELD and Tony had a vested interested in at least
Steve let out a breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding when Pepper and Rhodes left. Maybe Tony wasn't the only possessive one. Steve swallowed as the quiet filled the room again. "If you have any more questions, you can ask them now. Anything," he murmured as he trailed his fingertips over the ridges of Tony's shoulder blades. His Alpha was already calming down now Rhodes had left. Steve's heart ached; his mate was so sensitive right now.  "I want to be honest with you. I'm sorry I kept things from you...I was just so scared of what you'd think. I won't do it again and I'm sorry," Steve whispered. "I want you to make it up to you. Please."
He watched Tony with his concern. His mate was clearly uncomfortable. "Hey, Tony, maybe take the collar off for a minute. You don't want to make your neck all sore," Steve said, a hand on his arm.
"Oh Steve, you always were good at getting into messes," Peggy sighed fondly from where she lay back in bed. The Alpha had aged well. She recognised him and remembered most of the time they'd shared. A lot of her physical appearance had changed but she still had the same eyes; they still held the same kindness that they did before. She was gently running her fingers through his hair, Steve's head leant on the bed, his eyes half drooping shut. He'd only gotten into London that morning. He was tired from the jet lag and the fact that he was struggling to keep food down, which was very unlike him.
felt like there was something on the other side of it, looking right back at him. Steve thought about the space window. Was it... was it still there? Maybe if they threw it against the wall?
This, he understood, was why so many Alphas on the news were saying no one would want to bond to Steve, why they were saying he was practically feral.  An omega with Steve's level of independence was difficult to be bonded to.  Tony had probably aged more since mating Steve than he had in the five years previously.  The stress was killing him.
Steve leaned his head on Tony's shoulder. "If they hurt you because of me I don't think..." He trailed off, not wanting to finish that sentence.
The flashing was kind of blinding. Steve stuck close to Tony, trying to hide behind him (an impossibility with his size), and didn't dare get in the way of his fans.  Tony was accepting things and signing them while Happy fruitlessly tried to get them some space.
There were no words that could express Tony's emotion.  He didn't think a word existed for it.  He took a step toward Steve, reached out, and put his hand on Steve's head, feeling the softness of his head.  He gave Steve a gentle pull forward, pressing Steve's head against his thigh.  For a moment neither moved; Tony stood there over Steve's kneeling body, hand on Steve's head, the heavy warmth of Steve's head resting against his leg.
But, as Pepper had pointed out, that was ancient history, a generation ago.  Nowadays, omegas didn't have to bond, didn't have to mate.  They could, like Steve, lock themselves up and try to preserve their dignity.  And Tony had every intention of letting Steve keep his because the last thing in the world he wanted to do right now was examine his feelings about Steve, which were all muddled up with his feelings about Pepper and his feelings about his mortality.
"He'll be fine after some sleep," confirmed Pepper, who seemed, like Happy, to be thoroughly unconcerned.  Or at least desensitized.
Tony nuzzled Steve's chest, letting the words wash over him.  It wasn't so much the words as the tone.
Tony's hand flew up to the scar on his.  His heart was pounding, throbbing, like it hadn't since he'd replaced the reactor.   He took a shaky step back, toward the door, then found himself glancing at the mirror in the room.  Was the rest of SHIELD behind that mirror, watching him?  Were Natasha and Sam laughing at him for thinking Steve had actually wanted him?
"...is there anything we can get you, man?  Water? Food?" asked Sam. He didn't say "Tony" but assumed Steve knew that was an option.  The subject of Steve and Tony's relationship was definitely the white elephant in the room.
Eric got a look of sympathy.  "...you don't know? He got Rex second-hand.  Richard's of the best omegecologists in the world, right up there with David Gleason--"  (Tony blinked.) "--and he was single. Everyone thought Richard was gonna send up with someone like Donner.  But instead he got Rex. Rex didn't present as an omega until he was a teenager. Got force-bonded, pregnant... got an abortion and his folks sent him to Pine Hills... you know.  He turned out all funny, that was before they figured out how to do arvicolinectomies correctly. ...take a peek at the guy's neck if you can. It looks like fuckin' corned beef hash.  Real sad. They won't even let him into the pen in the hospitality suite with the other omegas. Makes 'em too uncomfortable. The guy smells like burning tires. He's on a bunch of suppressants to try to neutralize it but it's still creepy as hell."
Steve's ability to logically think was soon going out the window. All he could see in front of him was a strong and capable alpha who could give him exactly what he needed.
Steve was crying all over Tony and getting his shirt wet. His preheat meant his emotions were on overdrive anyway and this had tipped him over the edge. He was crying in relief mostly, rather than distress, his hands bunched in Tony's shirt. "I didn't want it. I-I didn't want to kneel. I couldn't move. I'm so sorry Tony. I'm so sorry-- sorry-"
All four women went down in a tangle of limbs.  All had long hair and there was an ample amount of yanking; even though all four were betas, more than one of them resorted to biting.
Joan had sidled up to Steve and was blushing madly.  "Can I feel your biceps?" she asked. She and Maria both touched Steve's arms, giggling like schoolgirls even though they were closer to Tony's age than Steve's.
Contrary to DeSoto's calm face, Steve had a look of horror on his. And it wasn't because DeSoto was kneeling for Tony. That was
Tony's request for the shield began immediately obvious.  The piece hurtled toward Tony and pinged off the shield, crashing into the wall; several more pieces were flying, with varying degrees of aggressiveness, at Tony, who was doing a pretty good job of letting them hit the shield.
In the parking garage, Tony and Steve sat on the hood of a car together, watching Jorge wipe off Gideon Malicks car, both of them sipping beer.  Steve half-hoped an Alpha would come out and see them sitting side-by-side like this, as equals.  He hoped they'd see Steve drinking a beer from the bottle, like a
. It was a prison and I was trapped in it. That was before I was Captain America, Tony.  I was sick and it was 1935 and I was
Tony hovered over the chopper for a while as it landed in a clearing.  He saw Steve look up at him and he paused for a moment before dropping down.  He let gravity take him, then hit the jets at the last moment, landing with surprising delicacy behind Natasha.  He snapped off his face plate; Steve was pointing to a map on the tablet she was holding.
, Steve?  ...fuck me, I need a smoke."  Tony hadn't smoked in years, at least not cigarettes.  He only asked for one when his stress levels were through the roof.
The entire ride was clearly taxing on both Pepper's and Aria's patience.  Tony was overly enthusiastic and energetic. He didn't respond to anything Pepper said, at least not directly.  Happy kept looking at them in the rearview mirror, fascinated. As a beta, he didn't get much opportunity to see this sort of thing in action.  Steve and Tony were both acting like they were on drugs. Pepper put down the window and Tony huffed the air happily.
!  This is the lazy intern I was telling you about!  The one who thinks he’s gonna be a photojournalist but never gets me any damn pictures!  Move that light, will you?!"
. He never stuffed it into his mouth; he just sort of... inhaled it. "They made it sound pretty final when I was in hospital."
"Seriously, you're not going out with them alone, right?  I can come, right?  Steve?" pressed Tony.  "...will there be booze?  If there's booze, I gotta come, I'm so sober, Steve, sober as a judge..."  He made a playful swipe for the phone.  He was half-joking, but also, he didn't like or trust any of the others and he didn't want Steve slipping off alone with them.  It was ridiculous; Steve could defend himself. Tony couldn't possibly defend against Natasha (or even Clint, probably) without the suit, and as far as Tony could tell, no one at SHIELD posed a real threat to Steve.  What they were having was a political disagreement.  But still.  Tony felt like he should be there, by Steve's side, standing up for him.
With a bashful duck of his head he accepted the microphone, their fingers brushing briefly. The touch was electric. "Er, hi- wow, okay. That's loud." Steve lowered his voice a touch. "They didn't make them like this in my day." The crowd laughed. "I don't think I really have anything to say that Tony already hasn't. But...I just wanna say this."
"It's Steve's house too," Aria pointed out. "And if no one came around whilst you went on your little tinkering sprees, Steve would be left alone for like... days on end." Unlike Pepper, she was less sympathetic to Tony's whims and was evidently more concerned about how they impacted on Steve. "I'm going to yoga later," she told Steve. "You should try it out. It's very in this century."
smart.  ...Project Pegasus, Project Thor... back in 2005, Stark Industries helped out with project Artemis... the government has a real boner for mythology, doesn't it?"
Now he was doubting, though, whether he wanted to know more.  The idea of Steve being taken advantage of, of anyone trying to hurt him, made Tony equal parts furious and devastated.  Steve was so impossibly special to Tony for reasons he couldn't comprehend, and thinking of Steve in any sort of danger was almost unbearable.  He'd only ever known Steve as a smug, confident, uppity, modern omega.  He just couldn't imagine Steve ever being compromised by his status.
it, Tony? I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit how dominant you are!"  Before Steve knew what he was doing he was standing up. "I slept with you because I
Gleason frowned in thought. "Right. I'll...get back to you on that. I'll have to have a think. If Mr Stark was to have a real vasectomy that would obviously solve the issue. But it's a little early on for either of you to be making such serious decisions."
"Yep, right through there.  It's still a work in progress, but it's still one of the biggest collections in the world.  We even have one of the orchids he was given when he announced his bond! Pepper Potts donated it on behalf of Stark Industries, and it's just starting to bloom again."
He didn't add his secret gladness that he was spending his birthday just with Steve.  Turning forty hadn't been hard; he felt like he'd only just exited his thirties, after all, and was still young... but now, at forty-one, he was
"Are you not listening?"  Pepper sounded frustrated.  "I'm resigning!  Tony, every day since I've become CEO, it's like- like you're going to kill yourself or wreck the company. I feel like I'm just putting out fires left and right, and-"
The soldier was silent but attentive.  He'd heard similar speeches before. Karpov was a very idealistic man.  The lowest he'd ever seen him was after the second Winter Soldier program failed.  He had gotten Karpov out alive and they'd managed to tranq and store the feral recruits, but Karpov had moped for a long time.  The soldier had sympathized but also been glad he wasn't being replaced.
"I'm scared to ask what the other two are.  Tony, calm down, you've had concussions before, you're fine--"
"Please. Don't do this." Steve wheezed. "My fight is with HYDRA. Not with you. If you do this, you'll regret this. This will be it. SHIELD will come after you and maybe kill you and I won't be able to protect--"  Steve clutched at his head. "What are you doing to me?"
Dr. Gleason gave him a funny look.  "Well, yes.  That's where the cervix is.  It's not dissimilar to a prostate exam."
"Welp, me and Tony aren't really moving from this position for about an hour. I believe the US has this great thing called the
The worst thing was, Steve honestly didn't know, and now he was never going to find out. He just felt sick to his core and a little shaky. His stomach still ached with a phantom pain. Maybe if he'd been better he wouldn't have miscarried, maybe if he hadn't let Bucky throw him against that wall. Oh God,
Steve let out a high pitched noise in surprise as Tony tugged him in and kissed him. He trembled when their tongues met after lips parted and his hands slowly moved behind Tony to grip the headboard. Things were about to go up a notch. When Steve had first rode Tony he'd broken his goddamn bath...and he would hate to think that his alpha had felt he'd gotten lazy.
"Call me Steve. You're like one of the first omegas in here who’s actually spoken to me," Steve said. "What is up with that?"
That was fine.  They'd go back to the nest in the lounge or maybe make a new one downstairs.  It was the omega's job to figure out the nest situation, so Tony wasn't overly concerned.  He was happy to take Steve pretty much anywhere, as long as he got to, because he could feel Steve's body, warm against his leg, trembling, and smell his wetness, and he was feeling a renewed confidence in his ownership of his omega, since a) Steve was kneeling and being extremely submissive to him, b) he had vowed to kill his competitor and it was actually the perfect solution to their problem.
Now that his hangover was under control, Tony was basking in Steve's apartment.  He hadn't been unplugged in forever.  Not having JARVIS around, not having his phone on, not touching a computer... Tony felt like he was on vacation.  Like Steve's house was a perfect place to let loose, relax, have fun.  Tony's idea of fun was sleeping and maybe tearing apart Steve's microwave later.  And of course, getting physical.  Not that he planned on sleeping with Steve.  No.  He stood by his lifelong fear of commitment; he would never let himself sleep with an omega.  But cuddling wasn't off-limits, right?  Friends could cuddle, right?
He pulled away with a sad half-smile, studying Steve's sapphire-blue eyes, one hand still cupping his cheek.  "I never thought I'd end up bonded. Not in a million years. But every time I see you or smell you, I just... it's like I fall in love all over again.  It's incredible. I'm so glad to have you back, Steve. I'm never gonna let you go again."
As a congratulations a few days later Aria brought in a framed picture of Steve sitting in a pretend Oval Office in a fancy suit. She stuck it up on one of the walls without asking. Steve remembered spotting it for the first time when he was eating his breakfast and tried to imagine Donner's face if he saw it himself.
care of myself!"  His grip on Steve tightened a tiny bit more.  "Do me first," he said.  "...aren't there any omega doctors?"
of sex in the next few days. they just didn't like to think about it. Like you don't wanna think about your significant other taking a shit."
He had a sudden urge to spar. Steve would have to arrange it with Natasha sometime. She was of the only people who could handle his strength.  He bet these women could, too.  These
Steve whimpered at the sensation as he was filled, his body clenching around Tony in response as he trembled on top of him with pleasure. He leaned his forehead against Tony's, their breaths mingling as their bodies sealed together. He groaned low in his throat as Tony thrust up inside of him and teased at that perfect spot. He tensed against him and came over Tony's hand and his own chest, panting a little as he rode out his orgasm with small undulations of his hips.
"Let's go," said Tony, turning.  He hated that Steve could feel him.  Yeah, he was panicking, but no one was supposed to know that while he was in the suit.  And he shouldn't be making these kinds of associations. These were not his memories. They were the Winter Soldier's.
"The regulations said they had to lock," Steve said with a shrug. Gideon gave him a furious look but said nothing, clearly he didn't want to engage with an
He leaned into Steve, heavily, gripping his upper arms.  His legs were threatening to buckle under him.
"Yeah, he wanted me to call Steve.  He's not holding up very good," said George.  "Donner's with him but he asked specifically for Steve and Danielle.  Danielle's on her way."
Regardless of whether he was dead or just tripping balls, he decided to play it cool.  As cool as possible, considering he was Nowhere and Death was staring right at him.  He thought he heard footsteps but he wasn't sure, and now Death was asking his name, and he realized he had no idea.
"It's the feeling of rejection," Steve informed him. "You made me feel it every day. You made me feel broken. And useless. And unwanted. And unloved. And even though the rest of the time you were a sweetheart to me... that didn't make it okay. That's not how it works."  Tears welled up in his eyes but didn't spill. Steve swallowed.  "You wouldn't even touch me. You would never touch me. I'd never felt so broken. Well now you can feel it too," Steve breathed, voice trembling a little. "You shouldn't've bitten me.  But it doesn't matter now.  I'm not really yours, not anymore. Not that you ever really took me as your own in the first place.  You only bonded me 'cause you were tryin' to protect me.  But I don't think you really cared about me as a mate."
more, though," he added, clearly unable to drop, as Banksy termed it, "Alpha machismo."  Perhaps part of it was because of the two omegas in pre-heat. Or perhaps it was the steady stream of martinis.
They weaved through and found a sofa in a quieter corner of the room, but just as they sat down, someone approached them.
"I studied history and anthropology at college. She was doing her doctorate at the time on something I was interested in. I e-mailed her... we got talking about World War Two, and then next thing I know we're on a coffee date. And, oh my God, she was so
With Tony's help he got into trousers, both of their hands shaky when they tried to tuck in the shirt. Steve laughed quietly, sadly. He wanted to cry again, partly in relief. His shoulders shook. Steve was with his Alpha.  He was safe. He leaned his head on Tony's shoulder and they stood like that for a moment, Steve's face pressed against his neck.
"--six and three-quarter inches," finished Tony as Steve was strolling over.  He wrapped an arm around Steve's toweled waist, pulling him close and bumping hips with him.  He was above average for a beta and solidly in the "average" range for an Alpha.  This was one of the few statistics he knew about himself; he couldn't have named his pants size or blood type if his life depended on it.
"The ones I got yesterday definitely don't lock..." Steve murmured. "Does this mean I have to dress a certain way too?"
Tony was pacing impatiently through the jet when they arrived in the dusty little town of Thamud.  They set the jet down on the outskirts of the town, the engines kicking up clouds of dust. They opened the back of the jet and descended; if Phil was right, they were less than six kilometers from the base.
"You-- you said you work with him  What are you guys, like mascots or something?  Is that why you're dressed like Captain America?" asked Trickshot.
Tony had never quite stopped, not really.  He just lost himself in booze and drugs and parties and women and work.  He distanced himself from Peggy because she had had too much of a maternal sort of aura and Tony didn't want to feel pitied.  He had a worry that he might break down crying, something he didn't want to do in front of anyone. He never ended up crying for his parents.  Obadiah, who had always been like an uncle to him, let him reshape their relationship as business partners and equals, and Tony had felt safe talking shop with him, never being asked how he felt.  He didn't know how he felt. He just didn't want to explore it.
Steve took the itinerary and flicked through it. "He sent us the tickets. I think he kind of asked for it," he said, moving to place the itinerary on the desk. The view out of the windows was stunning. Steve didn't want to think about how much the hotel must cost them a night.
He was clearly drifting off into his own head space because Brooke was cupping his cheek and drawing his gaze back to her face. "You see, Steve, I'm not interested in status. I'm interested in
He shouldered through the crowd; someone handed him a scotch and he accepted it gratefully.  He found Steve outside on the pool deck.  The pool was backlit with blue lights and the water made the glow shift.  It reminded Tony of his arc reactor.  Right on cue, he felt a pang in his chest, and he hissed, waiting for it to pass.
I've ever seen," said Louis calmly, as Gleason drew up a second syringe for Steve, "but I won't say it's the best, either."
Once they were back in the hotel room Steve spotted his sketchpad at the bottom of the suitcase, admittedly thrown in as an after thought. He glanced up at Tony and could already see the gears turning in his head. "You mind if I draw you while we... 'watch TV'?" He asked.
"...you're Tony Stark.  You don't take anything seriously.  Especially not work. Listen, go home and go out to dinner with Steve.  You've earned it."
This was worse.  They hated Steve but only because of who he was, or who he wasn't.  Things he didn't choose. Things that were as much a part of him as his eye color.
Lowenstein & Schaedler was a legal firm whose big claim to fame was representing Tony Stark.  Tony was a high-profile client and also an excellent proving ground for new junior partners. Lowenstein had been the head of Tony's legal team for the last nine years, since he was 41.  He had personally gotten Tony off on charges he'd incured after crashing a Lamborghini into the Bellagio Fountain, with the argument that Tony Stark was of such great intelligence and so aneurotypical that he had been suffering from temporary insanity at the time of the accident, caused by over-stimulation from the night lights of Vegas.  He'd even gotten Stephen Strange on the stand to testify. (Dr. Strange had begrudingly conceded that it was "possible" but that he, as an aneurotypical person himself, would never be caught dead crashing a Lamborghini.) The "Stark Defense" was now widely taught in law schools around the world, in the same chapter as "Affluenza."
Admittedly, Tony was about as inexperienced as Steve in this department.  He wasn't used to pleasuring men, or omegas.  Steve's body was new terrain, unexplored, but Steve was responding positively, so Tony kept stroking him, his fingers examining Steve slowly; he was familiarizing himself with his omega's body.  He rolled his thumb over Steve's head, brushing over the foreskin (so weird-- but of course he wasn't circumcised, having been born in 1918-- but fun, different; Tony liked it).
His left arm was tingling.  He reached out without thinking and rubbed the crook of his elbow, then felt surprise that he wasn't strapped down.
Incredible reflexes, this new stranger.  He swung up with an arm, one of the whips dangling from his hand ribboning out in an elegantly spiral of electricity.  Tony took a piece of his own metal in the face, stumbled back, fell, and rolled without thinking, watching as one of the electrified cables slammed onto the ground where he'd just been.
The Expo was looking great.  He hadn't been there since the opening ceremonies, but it was as busy as ever.  There were crowds of people, and everything was lit up.  Tony hadn't actually ever seen the front entrance; he'd dropped in from a plane using a suit when the Expo had opened.
"Urgh. Okay. Put him through. Just...just give me a minute," Steve said, finding it strange how talking to an AI suddenly felt
"A hate crime? It would be a pretty elaborate hate crime for just one guy," Steve pointed out quietly, but he didn't protest against the idea. He supposed it was better than people thinking HYDRA were still around and
"You owe me one."  That was how Rhodey greeted Tony and Steve when he showed up to Tony's house on Tuesday morning.
Tony had all-but forgotten about Jeanette, at least temporarily.  His interest was completely captivated by Boswell, who had just handed him a drink.  Boswell had aged well, but he was probably in his late seventies and Tony knew he had a son that was Tony's age.
"Fuck," he whispered. "Yes. Y-yes I want it. Please. Alpha. Give it to me. I want your knot. I want your everything."
take it off.  Not without the gantry, which was back at the Expo.  The Mark VI was not self-assembling.
"I have some aspirin in the bathroom, yeah," Steve murmured. He smiled a little, expression and tone soft like he was afraid he might scare Tony off. "I'm going somewhere good," he promised him. "But... I kinda want it to be a surprise. You'll see tomorrow."
Jed knelt in front of him.  "Yoo-hoo. Steve. ...Steve, are you okay?  You haven't eaten today, have you?" Her expression was one of concern.  "I know," she said, quietly, reaching out to touch his shoulder. "This is hard.  It's hard to see. ...come on. You at least need some water, it might hit a hundred degrees today..."
Rhodey swiped the sock aside and sat down while Tony ran over a couple of prostitutes.  He wasn't sure how to address the elephant in the room; Pepper had already warned him that Steve's name was forbidden.
"Tony... God, that boy."  Howard sighed, leaning back.  Jarvis handed him a drink and he accepted it gratefully.  "Ed, you know what it's like to have a kid who wants to know how to describe a non-linear Lorentz transformation and whether or not Minkowski space is applicable to non-Galilean transformations?  He asked me what gravity was made of, and when I said gravitons, he wanted to know whether it was spin-1 or a spin-2 boson.  ...they don't
"Uh huh," Steve said, sounding unconvinced. He sent a sideways glance at Tony and the two of them fell back, letter Eric and Piper walk ahead of them. "Do you actually wanna go to this thing?"
He touched it, tracing it.  Steve kept shivering beneath him.  If he were an Alpha, his dander would be up, but of course, omegas couldn't bristle the backs of their necks like Alphas.
Clint had already severed the connection.  Tony looked down at his notes.  He'd written "1960s," "neck glands," "bite Steve," and "gross."  He tossed the notebook back onto the desk and frowned, swiveling his his chair, tapping his fingers against his chin thoughtfully.  Biology was not Tony's strong suit.  He was a whiz at engineering and programming, at anything involving math or mechanics.. but when it came to the organic side of science, he was well aware he was no brighter than the average person.
Tony was feeling groggy but significantly more well-rested than he had that morning.  He pressed himself against Steve, noting dully that he had morning wood-- more accurately, late afternoon wood-- and that the back of Steve's thigh felt incredible when he rubbed against it.  He was half-asleep.  Aware enough to know this probably constituted "funny business" but sleepy and aroused enough not to care very much.
"--good to be back, thanks," said Pepper, grabbing the phone.  "Hello, this is Virginia Potts-- oh, hi, General Ross, how are you?  Did you get our Christmas card?" She waved Sitwell away and stalked off toward the kitchen.
"I know you have a lot of issues with the Horseshoe Society," Steve said and Ty hummed noncommittally. "But if we don't present a united front we're never going to win this fight. As long as we're divided then it's easier for people to ignore or dismiss us. I'm not asking you to play nice. I'm just asking you to be open to reason. The Horseshoe Society are just trying their best, as are you."
"I mean...what do we do when a heat comes around? Ideally I don't want to be pregnant any time soon. But they told me medication won't work. My body burns through it too fast... hell, when I was going to have a heat, they used emergency suppressants on me. My body burned through them in less than a minute."
ion."  He slung an arm around Steve's shoulders, dangling off him, and patted his abs with a snort and a laugh.  "Wow. Captain America," he added happily. "You and me should-- we should do a duet, Steve. You can be Cher, I'll be Sonny, we'll do
Steve's posture was very, very slightly hunched and it took Tony a moment to recognize it as self-consciousness.  Why the hell would Steve of all people be self-conscious?  His body looked like a Greek statue.  Tony was the one who should be embarrassed, with the arc reactor stuck in the middle of his chest like some sort of grotesque night light, and the heavy scarring surrounding it, and with numerous faint scars marking him.  But he hadn't felt self-conscious about any of that for a long time.  He was, after all, Tony goddamn Stark and he had a "playboy" reputation to maintain.  Three months after his ordeal overseas, he had resumed his usual lifestyle, powering through any misgivings with a ferocious desire to be normal again.  Or at least as normal as someone like him could ever be.
"Talk to T'Chaka first," said Rhodey.  "...no one is blaming you, Tony, we know you don't make weapons anymore."
"Well... I grew up like this," said Tony.  "TV interviews, red carpets, paparazzi... this is old news.  And let's be real, Steve.  Any Alpha would be cool with anything after mating you.  I don't know how it feels for you, on your end, as an omega, but... you have no idea, Steve.  I want to give you everything.  I want to be close to you, all the time, and protect you from everything, and... it's just incredible.  I want to spoil you."  Actually, Tony could kind of understand an Alpha's trepidation of an omega going out and working and having a social life outside of the bond.  The thought of Steve existing without Tony there was unsettling.
"Oh.  Right.  ...I can't believe you fell for that.  He's Captain America, seriously.  And you're... well, kind of a shitty Alpha.  Hey, don't worry about it.  At least you got approved for action.  C'mon, get up, we'll get some drinks."
Steve turned and saw Happy out on the drive way behind the smaller fountains, their car next to him. He reached for Tony's hand. "Come on. Let's go. Are you alright? Did they hurt you?"
Steve was on his third pint of Guinness but he was nowhere near feeling it. Jane kept asking him history questions; he patiently answered them. Most of them were about the Howlies or, ha, the president who had felt him up. But then she asked: "Is it true that you were just the test run, and that they always intended the serum for Alphas?"
," replied Pepper with equal exasperation, reaching over to straighten his tie.  "Never mind, we can fix whatever it is after the interview, you've got about eight or nine million viewers so you two go out there and say some sound bites."
Maybe the worst part was Steve wouldn't even describe what he did as torture. He'd cause someone just as much pain in an actual fight just as easily, it wasn't like he water boarded him or started peeling away fingernails. Steve didn't feel like he was the kind of person who was capable of torture, honestly... he just, broke his leg right? That wasn't
"Okay, okay, chill out... let me call Aria, she was with his this morning, maybe she knows what's up."  Tony called Aria, who picked up after two rings. "Hey, Aria, any clue where Steve is?"
"I..." Steve seemed to gather himself for a brief second. "I don't want to ruin any of the pictures. Please. They haven't done anything wrong."
? thought Tony.  He felt the same horrified feeling of guilt when he learned his missiles were being sold to terrorists and targeting civilians, but this was worse, so much worse; if he hadn't been in the suit, he was sure he would have collapse onto the ground. His legs felt weak and the only reason he was maintaining his composure was because Steve needed him to.  He had to make sure Steve was safe.
"I think he might have just actually lost it. Dying makes people go crazy, right?" Clint said, watching Tony flit about through the hole in the floor with a strange expression on his face.
He got up and peeled off his boxers, then moved a foot to the left and sat back down, still watching Steve.
When they pulled up to the house, Tony walked wearily up to the door, waving his keycard to unlock it.
He flew to the nearest hospital and nearly hit the glass panes in front of the ER when he landed, coming in too fast.
Steve moaned, low and thick in his throat as he snapped his hips forward and fucked himself down onto Tony good and proper. He let out a pleased sound as he squeezed around the top of his knot before he rose back up, the head only remaining inside him, before he plunged back down again. Steve desperately wanted to be touched, wanted to ejaculate-- but he would wait for his Alpha. He was a
"What do you mean by....a 'test run'?" Steve asked. Christine was rushing over with a dust pan and brush to clear it all up.
Tony had been pretty serious about Steve taking his shield everywhere with him from now on.  Tony carried his suit around and look at how that had worked out for him in Monaco.
Tony lunged, and the two Alphas fell to the ground, snarling, limbs flailing.  Later, Tony would have realized he should have just clocked Justin in the face; they'd been close enough that a single punch would have been perfectly effective.  But the moment Justin had insulted Steve, he'd lost whatever semblance of control he'd had.  This wasn't a fight between men; it was a fight between Alphas.  Neither was throwing punches; they were clawing and biting and tearing and their only goal was to inflict as much damage as possible to the other until one was dead.  There was no strategy to their fight, no thinking; Tony was snapping and growling and going for Justin's eyes, his throat, any vulnerable part of him.  If Tony was getting hurt, he was unaware of it; he was trying to strangle Justin with his tie and Justin was kneeing him in the groin and Pepper and Jack were both screaming at them but the two were deaf to the world around him, too bloodlusted to react to anything other than each other.
"This is getting ugly," observed Tony, finding the remote and turning down the volume.  "...kinda weird that all three of them are arguing about omegas but none of them look like omegas, huh?"  He placed his hands on Steve's shoulders and began kneading his muscles.  "...you think Fury is his real name?" he contemplated.
Steve sighed fondly and stepped forward, putting his hands on Tony's arms. He squeezed lightly and then stepped in closer, brushing the damp hair out of Tony's eyes.
Tony let out a scream and flung himself out of bed, hitting the floor with enough force to knock the wind out of him.
"Oh, yes.  Still very tragic.  But sixty percent of male omegas experience a miscarriage, so you're not alone," he reassured Steve.
Tony walked into the kitchen on the 29th at nine-thirty, for example, stretching in his robe.  He pulled open the fridge and pulled out a carton of orange juice, drinking it. Aria frowned.
The game wasn't over, but it was clear that Charlotte was going to win, even with Tony and Callum not helping very much.  (Both had sunk only a single ball so far.)
Tony wandered in wearing a silk dressing gown, holding a scotch.  He frowned a little at the baby and took a sip of his drink. "...so... what's she, ah, do?"
DeSoto took one step back, but only one.  "...I can't go back to my Alpha. If I showed up tonight he would think I wasn't holding up his end of the bargain.  He'd get mad at me," said DeSoto. Under his breath, he added sulkily, "According to him you were very interested in having me last night..."
Tony's hair bristled even more.  "Is that a collar? Are you trying to collar my omega?" he demanded.
"Even though I'm attractive and charming?" asked Tony.  Pepper rolled her eyes and didn't comment. Both of them knew why; weapons manufacturers were polarizing personalities, even on the best of days.  Tony's involvement in the civil rights movement, his frequent public drunken antics, and the various Iron Man fiascos and resulting collateral damage meant that Tony easily had as many enemies as he did fans.
"...do you want me to help... or...?" asked Tiberius, not willing to touch another omega's mate without permission.  "...also do you... do you want me to just wait outside and poke my head in whenever it's time for you to take your medication?"
Tony picked up the coffee and sipped, then, suddenly, in the dying dusk light, caught a glimpse of himself reflected in the window.  He had to do a double-take. Was that him? With the unruly hair and the glasses and the lines on his face? Putting aside that he was starting to resemble his father, he was suddenly aware he no longer looked young.  For some reason, he thought of himself and Steve as both being in their twenties. Late twenties, maybe even early thirties. But no. He was clearly middle-aged. And when he looked at Steve, he suddenly realized how youthful Steve looked.  Steve had that eager look of a young soldier and suddenly all Tony could think about was those baby-faced kids in that Humvee, asking him about whether it was true he had gotten the newest Bugatti Veyron a year before its release (yes), whether it was true he'd slept with all of Maxim's cover models in the last year (he'd only missed one), whether it was true that he and Astro Teller had had a wild night in Cincinnati and blown over two million dollars (kind of, though the lion's share of that money had been Tony's, not Astro's).
Steve finally looked at him after minutes of silence and tilted his head at him. "If they ask you to fuck me, will you?" he asked bluntly, expression blank.
He paused to take a breath and finished his drink.  He walked back over to Pepper and reached for the decanter; she pulled it away a little.
Natasha had finally managed to coax Clint down and was half-dragging, half-carrying him out.  "Steve, Tony, we're going. Try not to do anything you'll regret when you come out of it.  Happy holidays." Clint stretched toward the orchid on the counter with a whine; Natasha pulled him away.  "Okay, Farsight, I've got you, we're going home right now...." she said soothingly. "Oh, and Stark? If you fill a bandanna with coffee beans and wrap it around your nose, it really helps with the smell."
Of course, Steve had done this himself many times and he knew what he liked. Tony's fingers still felt different to his own however and the way he toyed with him felt
Pepper lowered the folder a little more, still shielding Tony's lower half.  "Hi Steve.  Tony said you want to start a very controversial charity."
"Just goes to show we all have something to learn," said Banksy after a moment, smiling.  He leaned over to tap Boswell. "Pay attention, you could learn something from these two."
"Yeah," purred Tony, already envisioning Steve in nothing but a silver collar with blue stones.  He wrapped his arms around Steve, rutting into him aggressively. Steve said he loved him. They loved each other.  Bucky was gone, right? It was just them now.
"Well I was too sick for that. I think I would have been sold with the intention of lasting one night," Steve breathed and began and to feed Tony's small pieces of apple along with grapes.
"What?"  Tony looked up, panicked.  She was a thin, short brunette.  She was good-looking.  Tony's stomach dropped.
He was shaking inside his suit and his digital display was flashing and, over the music, JARVIS was trying to get his attention.  His vitals had spiked. His EEG was a mess, his heart rate was 132 beats a minute.
"Maybe," Steve breathed after a beat, a little overwhelmed. There was so much he wanted to say. He wanted to refute so much of it, but he knew Tony wouldn't believe him. Steve could tell him a hundred times over that he'd make a good father but it wouldn't sink in.
"Project Eighty-Four is a surprise," Steve and leaned over to kiss Tony's forehead. "You'll see in time."
The last time he had been in the suit, he'd been fighting for his life.  It had been a while since he'd simply gotten to fly around.  He loved the feeling of weightlessness, the weird, out-of-body experience.  He was going impossibly fast but because of the helmet, there was no wind in his hair.  He could twist, brake sharply, corkscrew straight up, all of it in any direction.  It was not dissimilar to what he imagined being a ghost would be like.  (Tony didn't believe in ghosts.)
Her face softened the tiniest bit.  She stuck out a hand.  "As far as privileged, uninformed, prejudiced Alphas go, you're one of the good ones."
He made his way toward the stairs to the basement, toward his shop.  People wanted Iron Man and Tony was more than happy to oblige.
"...be my guest.  Turn the place inside-out," said Tony, opening the door for them.  The SWAT team looked disappointed they weren't going to be needed. The suits swept in, paused momentarily at the sight of the hundreds of orchids, then began roaming the house.  Tony watched them, arms crossed with annoyance. He was actually getting to the point where he was looking forward to leaving the country for a week, even if it meant Aunt Peggy--
Tony felt a bit of shame for being so worried it ws Bucky's bite mark and not his.  It could, of course, be worse, from an omega's standpoint. It could be an unreadable mess of scar tissue.  Tony had seen omegas with necks like that and he felt the same knee-jerk revulsion to that as he did when he saw a woman who had had a butchered mastectomy.  It was unnatural; bonding markings were supposed to be neat and clean, the outline of the teeth obvious... the fingerprint of the Alpha that had put the scar there.  Bonds that healed badly meant either the Alpha had fucked up, or multiple Alphas had torn the gland apart. Either way, it was grotesque.
." Steve sighed. More Cheerios. "I personally think the best way of finding him would be through Tony's subconscious.  He spoke to me once," he said, voice casual like he was describing the weather. He wasn't really sure why he was telling Fury all this; maybe it was just because the hunt for Bucky was a lot more serious than he'd realised.
"And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world.  You're brilliant, Tony, and I believe that your only limitation is your imagination."  A pause.  Howard looked down at the model contemplatively, then up, at the camera.  "I'm proud of you.  You are, and always will be, my greatest creation."
Agent Simmons looked at Steve in surprise.  She'd assumed he was in critical condition from the way Tony was acting, but Steve looked fine.
It was child's play.  Only two people.  Except there were three people and two were blonds, actually, so he felt slightly uncertain as to which was which.  No matter.  One was a woman.  She would be easy to subdue.  The other was big, and more threatening, so he went for his first.  It was disappointingly easy; he grabbed his throat and threw him to the ground in an instant, then turned.  There was only one guy with one eye.  He was aiming a gun for him.  For his head, actually.
"Yes," said Kitty, examining the case.  "...none of these are suede. But we can customize the collars however you like.  The lining is the easiest part to alter, actually. I've had mine changed three times already.  They all have lifetime service warranties."
His expression turned soft as he stroked Steve's skin.  When Steve looked over, he was met with a part of alert grey eyes, eyes that were completely and utterly different than the vacant windows that had been the Winter Soldier's.
"I don't think so. I think I'm okay." Steve assured her. Getting nervous wouldn't exactly do him any favours. "I mean, this is for charity right? This isn't about me."
Wait, was he shit-talking Howard?  Howard, who had helped make him Captain America in the first place? ...huh. Turned out he was. But in all honesty Steve had never especially liked him. At least, not the way he looked at him.  Like a piece of meat.  The same way he looked at women.  Howard had been a very dominant Alpha and Steve had generally tried to steer clear of him.
"No rest for the wicked," said Wisdom, winking and moving to get back into his car.  Tony loathed him a little.
Tony had crawled into Steve's lap and wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and was nosing around his jaw, nipping and murmuring little love phrases to him, his heat irresistible.  Having been sated with the fruit, he was now entirely focused on Steve again.
Steve smiled. Phil really was the best. He dressed in blue jeans and a white t-shirt (that didn't hide much of him) for the day. He called for breakfast for three, spotting DeSoto asleep on the sofa. He'd drunk a lot of rum. Huh. The bottle was almost empty...maybe he'd picked up his Alpha's drinking habits. Or he maybe he wasn't allowed to drink around his Alpha and this was a rare opportunity to indulge. Steve frowned at both possibilities.
Tony stared into Steve's deep blue eyes.  Steve stared back.  Tony maintained his gaze, waiting for Steve to glance down or away.  He could hear both of them breathing; their breathing had synced up automatically, unintentionally.
Pepper sighed a little.  "...you earned one. Good job not speaking up there, and touching his neck like that?  Front page."
"You should call me Captain. On the battlefield I won't be your omega, Tony." Steve leaned into his touch and sat up in the bath, his expression softening a little. "I'll be your leader. I'm not expecting you to follow my every word. But someone has to be in control of a situation. Not following orders can sometimes have grim consequences." He eyes glazed over a little, like he was remembering something. Steve shook his head and was smiling again. "And no ass slapping out on the field, either."
"I have seventy years of backpay from the US government and they keep sendin' me Social Security checks," Steve protested, and moved to steal another pancake after he'd finished devouring his apple. Forty-two thousand barely touched the surface of Tony's fortune, which is why Steve wasn't fighting him harder. Besides, he had to be careful about his own personal finances; Aria had warned him that his little future venture that he was planning could potentially clear him out. But Steve was okay with that.
?  The white-haired man in the car had said that to him, too.  Sergeant Barnes, he had said.  Another memory.  A field of tulips.  The weight of a rifle.  France.  1944.  Sergeant Barnes.
to be supportive," said Tony.  "You get that, right?  I'm trying to stand up beside you, be into all this omega rights stuff, but it's hard, Steve.
Across the room, the man with the bloody nose had been shooed into the roped-off section for omegas and was letting several other omegas try to clean him up.  Donner saw an opportunity and took it. "I better go-- go check on Waffles," he said, trying to edge around Steve without touching him.
Steve grunted softly as Tony pulled out of him, his thighs shiny with slick and want. He let out a frustrated sound but he also didn't want to get pregnant, or have another scare. That was hardly fun. He would have usually refused being bossed around like that but this was sex and Tony was undeniably in charge. With a soft huff he got up and walked back down to the pool side, conscious of Tony's eyes on him as he walked to the door.
"How long is the drive?" Steve asked. "I want you to tell me where we're going." His head throbbed and his hand rushed out to grip the car door, fingers curling around an edge to steady himself. "Shit. I want you to-- fuck --tell me the road n-names."
"...we'll get you a nice massage... you'll like it," he said softly against Steve's skin.  Steve was still in his ridiculous costume and Tony was still partially dressed but neither of them was moving.  They lay there in peaceful silence for forty minutes before they were even capable of pulling apart, and then they went to shower before getting dressed and going to find the spa.  Steve put his old costume, freshly desecrated, back in his suitcase, worried someone from housekeeping might espy it on the bed.
Steve woke up around eight with Tony beside him. For Tony, it was early, but for Steve, eight AM was a lie-in.
"It will take him a long time to heal. But the first step is admitting he has to at all. God knows what being bonded to Gideon Malick was like," Pepper muttered into her glass. "Poor thing."
"I don't know," Aria said. She sounded tense, stressed, almost afraid. Which Aria never was. Yes, she got stressed. But she was never scared. She was currently pacing around her kitchen, cigarette held in one hand and phone in the other. "Natasha, one of Steve's SHIELD buddies, texted me. She told me that she'd been keeping tabs on Steve without letting SHIELD know, but that he'd... that he'd disappeared."
Steve shivered as Tony peeled away the last of his clothes. He curled into his touches, his eyes glazed over as he tried to track his Alpha's movements. But it was hard. He felt fuzzy at his fingertips and toes. It was like he was floating.
Tony ignored them completely and walked onto the plane despite some weak protests.  He flopped down into a leather chair with a groan of pain. Protesters, in his experience, always wore combat boots for some reason, and those hurt like a bitch to be kicked by.
Still, he was a man of his word, and he went out to the Mojave desert, to a facility that was not on any map, in order to take a look.  And, admittedly, to be close to Bucky, who he knew was there somewhere.
He looked down at Steve.  Steve's mother had been gone for, what... seventy years or something?  He was pretty sure they'd lost their mothers around the same age. An age that was too early and yet late enough that they'd both been expected to man up and bear it.  Steve had been close to her, Tony knew. He knew she'd protected him, in a time when, as an omega, and a rather sick, poor one at that, he could have easily been sold off in an arranged bonding to a less-than-pleasant Alpha.
Steve gasped sweetly as Tony's knot stretched him, his eyes rolling back as he sank down on it. He trembled against his Alpha and moved in tandem with him, his thighs quivering a little as he rocked down onto his cock. It was from all the kicking and pushing off of walls; his body was actually
problem, it would be a piece of cake to fix it.  But as an emotional one... Tony knew when to quit, when to fold, when enough was enough.  He had mated Steve because Steve's smell had called to him in a way no other scent had.  But he hadn't done it right and he'd been too late and it was his fault everything was a mess.
Tony grabbed the remote and muted the television.  "...they don't know what the hell feral is," he growled softly.  Like most, Tony had seen more than a few viral videos on YouTube of Alphas losing their minds.  Normally it was because there was an omega in heat nearby.  Two perfectly reasonable people would suddenly be snarling, biting, clawing, hysterical animals, trying to kill the other one.  It happened more in low income, disenfranchised areas, where there were more omegas, fewer omegas on suppressants, and, in general, bad education and worse impulse control.  In his own life, Tony had never seen an actual, real-life fight, because in business and politics and high culture, that simply didn't happen.
There were two other people here, a soldier and a civilian.  The civilian was a beta, and the soldier was, inexplicably, an omega, and Tony felt like he'd met both of them before but he didn't know under what circumstances because he didn't make a habit of hanging out in the Middle East much.   He doubted he'd be able to recognize his own mother in his current condition.
Steve rolled out of the way as the metal body landed heavily, dropping the heart/arc reactor with a displeased sound. He crawled away a good few inches for safety.
Besides, he liked the attention.  He liked it a lot. The blond's eyes were blue, like the sky over a field of tulips in France, and he liked looking at them.
When he woke, his ankle was killing him.  He grabbed Happy and leaned on him; Pepper pursed her lips in disapproval.
Biting Steve's flesh was pure bliss and he was unable to keep from grinding himself against Steve a little.  He pulled away reluctantly, double-checking his work (much better!) and then cupped Steve's cheek in his right hand, stroking the skin with his thumb.
. Natasha had laughed so hard the first time she saw him step into one.  (New York's SHIELD headquarters was old enough to retain some relics from Steve's age; one was the "Ladies and Horseshoes" sign over the showers.  Used to following signs, Steve had followed it without thinking; thankfully, Natasha was embarrassment-proof, and she was kind enough to point him toward the men's showers, where Steve had found other omega men casually changing among unbonded Alphas like it was no big deal.)
"If I had been a housewife, I would have been a very badly behaved one," Steve said, eyes twinkling. He smiled down at his phone, secretly a little pleased that Nick had texted him personally.
Tony was visibly excited.  "Yeah, because both partners wear the ring and it's equal.  So what if--"
"Oh, because of everything.  The arvicolinectomy, the hysterectomy, the hormone treatments... it's not as bad for the omegas they try to make into betas.  They just cut out the arvicolina and the scent glands and that's that. ...but
"I swear, I had nothing to do with this for once. Ivan Vanko was working with Justin Hammer. I was just here to schmooze." Tony said frantically.  "Steve is at Northwell Hospital, I gotta get to Northwell; he's all broken up. Vanko threw him against a wall-"
But outwardly, Steve smiled at the question. And he answered it honestly because that was what Steve did best. He couldn't put on a good show like Tony did; he knew it would come off as insincere. "These past seven months have been the happiest of my life."
Tony let Steve pull him into the shower and happily made out with him while the water coursed down his body, rinsing off their body fluids.  His hands roamed over Steve's body and his tongue explored his mouth; actual washing was an afterthought.  Any actual washing occurred was mostly thanks to Steve's attention.
Steve actually didn't protest this time and fetched a bottle, but with two glasses. He poured more for himself, although he still wouldn't feel it anyway. He pushed his phone over with the photoshoot.
He got goosebumps from the praise.  Karpov rarely ever praised him. He lay there, holding the blond down.  Once Karpov and the witch came, they could bundle him up and take him back to base and that would be that.  There was probably a half-pack of cigarettes for it in him, too.
"It felt really good at first, but now it just kind of hurts. I think I need to sleep. Maybe if I sleep then I'll heal and it won't be so bad again," Steve murmured. Still, even now, his body was responding to Tony rubbing up against him. He could feel himself getting wet but he also logically knew how sore he was down there.
He almost shuddered at the memory. It was a different time now, Steve reminded himself. He didn't need protection. Not now he could protect himself.
It was Steve who swore when Tony pushed into him with little warning. "F-Fuck-" He was hot and big inside of him and when his knot squeezed inside Steve felt breathless. He felt like a skinny guy with all the air knocked out of him by just a simple flight of stairs. His mind couldn't almost comprehend it. Tony's member was pulsing inside of him, thick and demanding in its presence- so much so it was hard for Steve to even comprehend.
When he laid eyes on his home, though, the modern white mansion on the cliffside, he had a sudden urge to go back down to the shop and tinker.  He'd been away from Iron Man for so long, letting Steve drag them to this and that omega rights thing... and he still hadn't gotten the Mark VII up and working.  Not in any practical way, anyway.
Steve didn't flinch when Tony touched his neck. The touch was warm, grounding. When Bucky had touched it, it was the complete opposite of that. It had made Steve feel awake, alert. Now Steve almost felt sleepy, despite having done nothing all day.
With some persuasion (Pepper pouring a glass of water over his head) Tony got off of Steve. Steve himself sat up woodenly, looking a little forlorn with syrup staining the corner of his top. Pepper tugged the cushion up to try and hide it. If he was aware of the fact that he had a hard-on, he didn't show it.
like a bite mark to you?" spat Tony, rising and glaring at DeSoto.  His dander was up, which only highlighted the mark.
"I can assure you, it was pretty maddening at the time.  I wanted him to breed me.  I wanted it so bad."
In the backstage area of the main stage, Tony and Steve were holding hands and grinning like idiots; they could hear the excited, screaming din of the crowd outside, muffled to white noise.  They would probably be like that for a while.  Steve was trembling with excitement himself. They'd done it. Just like that. It was over so quickly. Their bond, publicly announced, out in the open... it felt good.  It felt liberating.
"Pretty much, yeah," said Tony, leaning on the handrail and wincing as he climbed up the stairs.  "They say tragedy plus time equals comedy."
Captain America to you!  Steve!  Lead the way!  O Captain, my captain!  ...mush!"  He staggered away from the bar, where Natasha looked torn between laughing and glaring, and Sam was shaking his head at them.
"Shh... sh, sh, sh... I won't hurt you if you behave.  I only want you to kneel for me, Steve. I want you to kneel and to call me Alpha."  There was a note of perverse excitement in Gideon's voice. "I want to feel your cheek on my thigh and to put my hand on your head and, for just a moment, feel what it would have been like.  That's very little to ask. And then you can go back to your mate and we will hopefully never cross paths again." He rolled his fingers over Steve's scent gland. "Surely that's not too much to ask?"
JARVIS didn't respond, but a moment later, the suit stood, letting go of Steve.  Pepper grabbed a blanket off the bed (she seemed immune to being grossed out by blood, sweat, or semen, at least at the moment) and draped it over Steve to give him some modesty.  "Steve," she said softly. "I'm going to call the doctor, okay, and Phil's going to come over... let's get you some clothes... can I see the cut on your stomach? How does your head feel?"
"Aside from when you were force-bonded, of course." Steve's smile fell. "How did that affect your relationship?"
His goatee twitched as he tried to suppress a smile.  "I get up for two things and two things only, Steve.  Coffee and blowjobs."  He closed his eye.  "Feel free to summon me with either one."  He reached up, carding Steve's hair through his fingers, then gave his head a small, suggestive shove.
Ten years ago, Nick Fury had helped Clint and Laura Barton buy a farm in Montana.  The farm was not in any SHIELD records. Now, over a decade later, he had been called upon for a similar task.  He didn't owe Steve or Natasha or Clint anything. But Nick Fury was a practical man. Bucky was not safe out in the world alone, where HYDRA could snatch him up.  Bucky was also not safe in SHIELD, which was infiltrated. They did not know the extent to which it was. Jasper Sitwell was the only known mole, and because Natasha and Clint and Sam and Phil and Tony hadn't gone through due process, he had been let go.  Fury had had every intention to go after him and arrest him properly, after reading him his Miranda rights. But in the couple of hours between his release and the arrest, he had slipped away, slippery little eel that he was. SHIELD was compromised and the Avengers Initiative was dead.  But Bucky needed contained. Those were the simple facts.
"Sometimes I think it would just be easier...if I just got on my knees and started being the omega everyone wants me to be."
"No, Steve's heats come on fast.  The sooner you get this interview over, the better," said Pepper, pinching the bridge of her nose.  "Tony, please stop humping him."
Malick was turning red with an interesting combination of anger and embarrassment.  Tony crossed his arms casually, as if it were perfectly normal to attend a black-tie event while wearing nothing but underwear, trainers, sunglasses, and a watch.
The first day was a blur of Tony, pills and occasional slices of fruit Steve had managed to swallow. They slept deeply the first night, making it a whole eight hours before Steve woke up and made to sit on Tony's erection, waking him up too. The second day was harder. They were both sore and physically tired. Steve kept dozing off through out the day and waking up to find Tiberius had left him a little bucket of ice chips. Ty was nice like that.
