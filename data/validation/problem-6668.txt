“Just Dr. Stark.” She glanced down at the page, and gasped in exaggerated shock. “Oh, and you’re there too.”
“Playing dirty, I see,” Tony muttered, turning his focus down to the camera as he fidgeted with the buttons.
It had been months since the fight in Siberia. Maybe a little over a year. Steve didn't remember. It hurt to remember.
“Clint and Peter, I want you guys to start moving the civilians out of this area. I don’t know how far you can get everyone but hurry. If you get them out of the way come back and join us.
That didn’t mean Tony was proud of what he did with that privacy. He resisted his laptop as long as possible. It stayed in his bedroom while he set up in the dining room to grade all the papers he’d been forgetting in his office for a month. Dinner was ordered and consumed as he graded. He forced himself to think of his students; Peter, Doreen, Riri, Harley… Everyone was expecting their papers back before their finals and he really needed to get this done. As the temperature dropped quickly with the sun, Tony grabbed a blanket instead of turning up the heat. Anything to remind him that crop tops were not appropriate things to think about right now. It was too cold for that.
“I’m… I’m sorry, I’ve been… an ass.” He rubbed a hand over the back of his neck, and then fidgeted with his glasses. He forced himself to stop, tucking his hands into his pockets. “I just… Well, I mean, you’re really nice. And you were really sweet when you started, so I…” He felt his cheeks flush. “I kind of looked you up.” He didn’t look up; he didn’t want to see Steve’s expression.
“You know,” Tony began, voice soft as he pet Steve’s hair, “I could probably rig up something for you for your music. If you let me hook up a computer to your camera, we could work out some timing software to get your music to start when you want it to. Unless your box is older than it looks. Then I’d have to get a couple adapters and-”
Steve led Kat to the den. There, they turned on NCIS and watched an episode from the first season. But neither of them was paying close attention. Both were worried about what could have happened to Peter. As they were about ready to start the next episode, JARVIS came up and told them that Tony wanted them down in the lab. They hurried down the hallways and made it to the lab door. Steve knocked and the door opened almost immediately. Steve and Kat ran inside.
Peter released the ropes, and the two scientists were immediately all over the silk, pulling off samples to study. Steve took the kids and led them out into the commons room. Steve knew he had to talk to Peter about this early. But Peer beat him to it.
Kat was a little proud of her brother. But she also felt a little pang of jealousy. Being an Avenger would be so cool. Too bad she was the only one in the family without powers or special training – or super-smarts in her Dad’s case. But that didn’t matter. She could help by just supporting them.
Kat shrugged, “Well, no. I always pictured a mother and father. But since you and Steve are my new parents I don’t think I’ll have a problem.”
Tony watched him a moment, and then nodded, leaning back up to kiss Steve. It was gentler than before. “Just remember to breathe, sweetheart.” He pulled back and smirked, “And maybe keep your eyes on me.”
Twins Peter and Kat had been waiting forever. Literally. Their entire lives they’d been waiting to be adopted. It was hard knowing that they hadn’t been wanted by their parents and that no one wanted them, still. But they coped. It wasn’t like they didn’t have friends. They had friends, several that also lived at the orphanage. Like, Wade. Wade was a good friend of theirs, and so were the other pair of twins: Pietro and Wanda.
“M.J., one of my students, her boyfriend is in your engineering class, she told me to give this back to you. I don’t know why she had it. She said I needed to wait in here.” He shrugged a little, and Tony couldn’t believe the blush on Steve’s cheeks. “Said I could thank her later as an apology for being an ass the last couple weeks.” He smiled, sheepish, “Wouldn’t usually let a student talk to me like that, but I know she’s right. I just-”
Tony looked up from his paperwork, sighing softly. He really needed to get his grading done before he gave his final exam. “Yes, Peter?”
“Stop!” Peter yelled. He put his hands on Steve’s shoulders, and looked his father in the eye. “Pop, it’s not your fault. It was her first fight! That’s nerve-wracking. My first assignment, I would have had something similar happen if we all hadn’t been in a group. She couldn’t be in a group this time. It was circumstance.”
“Maybe,” Steve allowed, stretching out his arms a little as he walked back over to his player to fast-forward the track again.
Steve made his way into the office to set up the backdrop and camera. It was the only room in the apartment with wood flooring, so it was ideal for his workout mats. Right next to the desk, on which his camera was propped, he set up his freestanding whiteboard and wrote out the workout he’d decided on. He tried to switch it up week to week, moving around the focus, or at least mixing around the order. Eventually, he would probably run out of combinations and have to adapt his genre. Maybe he could do different decades of workout fads. Or maybe he would keep the 80s aesthetic. He did like that best.
Because Tony liked Steve’s videos, Steve actually suggested Tony come have dinner at his place and see how Steve put his episodes together. He needed to re-film a section because he’d messed up in his original shooting. There was no rush, as he could finish editing easily enough on Friday. He figured Tony could watch, and it would be fun to show someone else this thing he enjoyed – especially since Tony enjoyed it as well.
He caught M.J. smirking at him, and sent her an unimpressed frown. She rolled her eyes and focused back on her partner.
“I’ve got a problem,” Tony admitted. The first step was admitting that you had a problem. “You remember I told you I found out he makes those aerobics videos?” He waited for Rhodey’s affirmative response. “I keep watching them. I can’t even look him in the eye properly at work anymore.”
Kat finished her rant and snatched her book back from Tony. But her hands were shaking so much that she dropped it and it landed on her foot. She yelped and bent down to pick it up. But she collapsed onto her knees and held her face in her hands, sobbing from stress and anger. Tony and Steve were shocked frozen for a few moments. Steve was the first to snap out of it, sitting next to Kat and pulling her onto his lap. She fought against him, weakly before letting him hold her as she sobbed into his shoulder.
Tony finally broke the silence, “Well, the first thing we’re doing when we get you home is catching up on NCIS. I don’t think any of us have had time to watch this, or last year’s seasons.”
Steve smiled and poured them each a glass of water before filling the vase and giving the orchids a drink. He set the glasses on his kitchen table, pretending not to notice the way Tony was still attempting not to stare at his legs. They were quiet as they both sipped their water, just looking at each other for a moment. Together, they started to laugh softly, giggling over the rims of their glasses at each other.
“It’s fine, Pop,” Peter said. “It’s just that you don’t normally cook breakfast and these are the best eggs and bacon I’ve ever seen!”
Everyone else was working on research. They were coming close. It was a level power that closely resembled that of the tesseract. But the tesseract was still somewhere on earth, and the signals being received were from outside of Earth’s atmosphere. Thor was personally suspicious that Loki was up to something – he loved his brother, but he couldn’t deny that Loki could not be classified as a “good guy”. The Avengers took a break from their surveillance to watch Kat and Tony demonstrate the new Iron Woman suit.
Tony and Steve just stared for a moment. No one said anything more. Tony grabbed Peter and pulled him down to the lab, Steve and Kat hot on their heels. Bruce was still in the lab when they got there and so
?” Tony tried his hardest, but he legitimately could not take his eyes off Steve’s thighs. The print on the tights was hideous, and Tony felt his cheeks flush at how crazy it made him feel that he was
Kat nodded and followed her dad to the elevator. Once they were in the lab and Kat’s suit was off, Tony got to work and Kat was free to do what she wanted with her afternoon. As she was leaving the lab, Tony’s remark followed her out the door:
Clint stared only another second before running out of the room. Steve took a deep breath and then started to work with the computers again. The comm in his ear buzzed to life.
“I like this color on you,” Tony murmured, leaning forward to press kisses across Steve’s exposed collarbone. “It suits you.”
Now, if only he could as easily tune out the thought of Steve in a crop top. Tony bit his lip, and firmly did not look up when he heard Riri and Doreen snickering.
Steve felt bad, so he stood and started backing up a little to the coffee maker. “Sorry, Tony, I didn’t mean to scare you. But, um, I was hoping to see you. I thought maybe we could talk.” He pulled the pot of coffee off the warmer in offering. “How do you like your coffee?”
“Just nervous. I don’t want to be treated differently for any reason, and despite that, it will be weird being in that kind of school setting!”
“I was going to ask you the same. I didn’t realize how much you enjoyed the tights,” Steve teased right back. His cheeks heated again, but he was at least glad to see Tony blush deepen with him.
Steve heard himself make a noise, feeling rather pathetic, and watched Tony’s eyes dilate. He decided that he couldn’t wait after that, and pulled Tony out of the office towards the bedroom.
Steve pulled both kids into a hug, “Both of you be good to your teachers, they’re just not paid enough. And have fun.”
Tony and Steve immediately recognized the voice. Steve signaled for the rest of the Avengers to stay back, but to be on guard. Tony flew Steve up and both stood on the opposite side of the roof from Loki. No one said anything for a moment. Tony and Steve were too shocked. Armor littered the roof, and an iron suit helmet lay off to the side, half intact. Steve’s heart was quickly grasped by cold fear. Kat…. Where was Kat? Tony’s eyes were already on her, and Steve soon saw as well.
“Enough!” Tony interjected, before it could get out of hand again. There was no way he was letting this discussion take over their breakout session. “This is your last lab before large lecture on Friday. Please, make the most of it.”
“Can you use Mjolnir to strike the brainwashed Asgardians with lightning? Could that snap them out of it?”
Kat turned her head to see Peter in the doorway. He was still in his pajamas. His hair was ruffled and he looked tired.
Natasha wasn’t one for a lot of words, and Kat moved on to the car. Tony was standing by the driver’s side door. Kat grabbed her backpack straps.
There would be a party at the Tower that night with the rest of the Avengers and Gwen. It was a small party, though happy. Kat had asked that no one get her anything, but she suspected that Tony had gotten her something anyway. He had asked her Friday, the last day of school, for all her measurements. She had to retake a few of them, but quickly got a list to her dad. She figured that he was getting her some kind of outfit. Boy, was she in for a surprise.
It was still a little early though, so Steve put on a sweater, leaving the leotard to hang around his hips. He was searching through his drawer for the correct headband and had only just managed to dig it up when there was a knock at his door. Immediately, he felt his cheeks flush with excitement and nerves. He reminded himself to take a deep breath, and then jogged to get the door, a grin already on his face as he opened it.
“Absolutely,” Kat replied, confidently. “If living with all of you has taught me anything, it’s that there are threats out there bigger than us and Earth needs to be protected. I would be part of that protection.”
Tony shot out of his chair and began to help Bruce modify the scans. As soon as they were finished, Tony texted the team and let them know what was happening. It took not five minutes for all the Avengers to gather in the lab. Tony gave them more details and they all talked about it, none too civilly, until one of the scans came up with a result.
She said it so calmly, so simply. So impassively. It brought hot tears to Steve’s eyes. How dare she. How dare she. She couldn’t just blow it all off like that. Her wrist and ankle were in casts. She was literally covered in gauze. She’d been thrown off a building for Christ’s sake! And all she did was sit there calmly and ask dumb questions!
Steve and Tony loved it and said they looked forward to hearing more from their new musicians. Then, both twins looked at each other and started to play the song Steve was teaching them in the car. Steve clapped his hands and laughed. Tony’s eyes widened and he stared at Steve who was still laughing as Peter and Kat continued to play.
“Sis,” Peter jumped in, “you may not have powers or superhuman abilities. And you may not be a genius. But you have good common sense and you sure picked up skills from Uncle Clint and Aunt Nat faster than I ever could.”
He was more surprised as Steve continued to lean in, pressing his lips against Tony’s. Tony only hesitated for half a moment before closing his eyes and kissing back. Distantly he hoped they wouldn’t both get a call from T’Challa about workplace indecency, but Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s shoulders… and Tony couldn’t find it in himself to care anymore.
“Ah, but you were only helping; analyzing. You saw a quicker way out. Even Stark did not think of this.”
The ladies were still smiling and giggling between themselves as they turned back to their work. Tony sighed, ignoring Harley’s quiet laughter in favor of getting his laptop properly booted up. He opened the gradebook to start putting in the grades from all the papers he’d gone over that weekend. The gentlemen didn’t seem to be discussing their work like the ladies, rather, Harley was explaining to Peter about the crop tops, making Peter gasp. But at this point, Tony just worked on tuning them out. They were smart kids, and if they were going to gossip instead of work, Tony was going to let them figure out how they failed the assignment on their own. He’d given them enough warnings.
"We've done that for fifteen years because it was a tradition at the orphanage. And this is a new home with new relationships in every sense of the word! I've only known Gwen for a few months!"
The look on Tony’s face as his eyes flicked between Steve’s boombox and his camera was interesting. He looked like he might be taking them apart with his eyes. In all honestly, it was kind of hot. But Steve just kept stretching, trying to keep his mind in the right place while he got ready to film.
“Just sometimes, when I want to use equipment I don’t have at home.” Steve smiled down at Tony, and then started explaining some of the camera functions. “This starts and stops the filming, and this one just pauses it. It’s easier to edit, if you just use the pause for the two sections. So, I’ll do what’s on the board once, and you can pause it and let me get a drink, then I’ll do it again, and then hit the stop. Then again for the second section.”
Steve just cupped his cheek and pulled him down to kiss him gently. “Will you come get coffee with me this weekend?” He never wanted Tony to stop.
Kat ran forward again. She managed to get one hit in before Loki ripped off her helmet and threw her back onto the roof.
“JARVIS, please bring up all of the ‘Sherlock’ holiday specials. I finally have time to watch them.”
The signals hadn’t made any sense. Not the slightest. But Tony was determined to figure them out. It was mid-September and he was in the lab with Bruce, trying – again – to pinpoint the source of the energy. Suddenly, Bruce shot up out of his chair.
Peter glared. But it didn’t last long. Steve set plates of eggs and bacon in front of the twins. Kat and Peter stared for a moment before looking back up a Steve. Steve squirmed.
Tony started to walk, intending to head into the bathroom. But his feet took him over to the desk, to his laptop. It was habit by now, relaxing by watching one of the videos. At least, he thought, he didn’t just sit there and watch it like a creep. He did some of the stretches – kind of – trying to follow along with Steve’s movements. Steve made it look so easy, but Tony was huffing slightly as the video came to a close.
“Everyone’s here to say hello and wish you good luck. So eat fast so you’ll be ready to go out the door in time to deal with traffic.”
Steve scoffed, “Probably just working in his lab. He hasn’t had to do too much work since he made Pepper his CEO. I’m sure Peter will join him.”
“Sure, right, whatever.” Tony’s eyes flicked over to the laptop. Steve would say no at some point, when he found out about the videos, even if he did say yes to one coffee date. The videos. Steve was putting out a new video today. Damn it, he’d almost managed to let it go. “Rhodey, hey, can you stay on the phone with me for a bit? Or come over?”
Loki smiled and moved his wrist. Kat jerked forward and fell on the roof, hard. The backplate of her armor popped off from the impact. Kat pulled herself up and faced the god.
Steve rolled his eyes again as Sam sat down on Bucky’s other side. “For some reason, I’m not very reassured.”
Peter shrugged, “It was mostly one-on-one with tutors or our supervisors. And it was mostly by the book. We didn’t do many hands-on project type things like they do in public schools.”
Peter snatched the book and looked at the last page. There was a sketch of him and the girl he'd been dating for a while: Gwen. They were sitting in the park, staring up at the stars together. Peter looked incredulously at his sister.
Steve started to shake, his breath trembling as it passed his lips. God. God, how? How could Tony forgive him for all that had happened, that Steve had caused? More tears slipped as he felt his walls crumbling and his chest warming.
tights. And a leotard. Tony could imagine the crop top he was probably wearing, but it was hidden under Steve’s winter coat. Steve gave him an awkward smile and wave, and then pointed over at the thermos.
Kat tackled Peter backwards onto the bed. They wrestled for a few minutes before Kat finally had her brother pinned down. She sat on his back, holding his arms behind him at strenuous – though intentionally not painful – angles. Peter tried to get free but found himself unable.
Kat squealed at the sudden lift and laughed at Steve’s exclamation. When he set her back down, she stood on her toes and gave her father a kiss on the cheek.
Kat and Peter laughed while Steve shook his head. But they all agreed that it sounded like some nice family time.
Tony put the pot back and took long strides towards the door, hoping to keep his rising blush hidden.
Peter shrugged, "She was stressed the past few weeks for finals. It's been hard and I guess she was letting it out. I didn't mean for this to happen."
With Christmas a week away and Steve going to spend the majority of the holiday at his Ma’s apartment, he and Tony had decided it might be best to get together beforehand. Nothing fancy, just to see if this was something they really wanted to pursue. Steve wanted to. He’d worked so hard to get to at least this point; he really hoped it didn’t end here. So, Tony was coming over the Thursday after finals. A week seemed appropriate, just to give them both time to relax after the stress of it all, and to think about what they wanted to do.
Steve laughed softly and finished his glass of water, “Every time I hear about Dr. Richards, I simultaneously feel bad for him, and like he might deserve it.”
It was the 4th of June. Peter and Kat were finally going home with Steve and Tony. Each twin had maybe six to eight boxes filled with clothes, toys, pictures, mementos, and any technology they owned – including Peter’s amplifier for his guitar. Tony drove to the orphanage with a van – followed by Steve in a car – and loaded all of Peter and Kat’s things into the back. Kat and Peter tried to help, but Steve and Tony insisted that their time was better spent saying goodbye to the other kids. And it wouldn’t take long with Steve’s super-strength.
For the record, Tony was able to keep his disagreement to himself, and he totally did not laugh out loud when Doreen sighed sweetly about it. And even if he did, he’d hidden expertly it behind a series of coughs. Peter didn’t even ask what was wrong, and did he need water, because if he did, Peter had brought an extra bottle.
When Peter and Kat had finished saying their goodbyes and shedding tears, they climbed into the vehicles with their new parents and watched as the orphanage disappeared behind them. Peter was riding with Steve and Kat was riding with Tony.
They sat for a while longer, Kat shading and finishing up details. Peter asked if she would color it. She said no, pointing out that it wouldn’t look right to color over her shading. Peter shrugged and just watched as she flipped the page and started to sketch the same picture she just finished, but with the actual Avengers. Peter loved watch his sister sketch. She was so good at it, and it always looked very realistic. He couldn’t draw worth crap. He was better at the other stuff: math, science, etc. That’s not to say that Kat wasn’t good at that type of thing, but each of them had their strengths.
It didn’t seem to matter though, as he went up to get ready for bed. He needed to shower, but he kept looking back over at his laptop. He had only seen Steve once today, barely, which a little unusual, and it would be so easy to just look up the videos.
“Bruce, when you Hulk out just try and smash their heads. I’m sure that with your strength it’ll be almost enough.
Steve's eyes burned, but he refused to let them tear up. "You... You didn't..." He cleared his throat. "You didn't call."
“I bet,” Kat smiled and squeezed him back. “You have a good day. I know Dad’ll be insufferable without Peter there.”
“As soon as I teach you to fly it, you are part of the Avengers! Well, if Fury approves your training. But I’m sure he will, you’ll have the best teacher.”
He could feel Rhodey’s eye roll, but could also hear his smile, “You mean to celebrate when he says yes.”
Tony put his arm out and stopped Steve from going any farther. When Steve had moved Loki had tightened his hand around Kat’s throat. The pressure she was feeling was unbearable. Dark spots began to float in front of her eyes and she quickly lost consciousness.
Kat did as she was told and balanced herself before shooting three blasts up into the air. She had kept her balance perfectly and grinned at her success. She took the opportunity to look over and not to Clint. The archer understood and shot a few of his arrows into the air. Kat aimed, fired, and hit each one of them. Tony then motioned for her to follow him and they flew side-by-side over New York, causing civilians to look up and point and take pictures. They continued for a few minutes before turning back to the Tower. Tony landed and then watched as Kat made her almost-perfect landing next to him. She wobbled a bit, but she steadied herself and kept from falling over.
The other Avengers crowded around. Thor had to avert his eyes, but Natasha and Clint couldn’t take their eyes away. Hulk was off to the side, much less calm than he was only a few minutes ago.
Tony and Kat were able to get two loads up before Steve and Peter finally pulled into the Tower’s garage. They helped load and unload elevator-fulls of boxes, and the job was done faster. Once they had finished getting the boxes to the right rooms, they started to unload the boxes. Steve helped Kat set up her room and Tony helped Peter set up his. It took the whole afternoon, but everything was in its place by seven o’clock.
Laughter bubbled up out of Steve as he headed around to the front of the camera, “Careful. I might just use that for next week.” He checked the note he’d made for himself on the corner of the whiteboard about where to start the music, and fast-forwarded through the song.
“Kat are you enjoying yourself?” Peter asked. “I mean; this is my comfort zone but if you’re not liking any of it then we cou-.”
They had all left one by one the next morning. The doctor had told them that they had put Kat out for a while so that she could sleep and recover a bit more before having company. He assured them that she would be safe. Thor had been the first to leave, preoccupying himself with finding his brother. Bruce soon followed, needing to go home and clean up. Clint and Natasha left soon for the same reason. But Tony, Steve, and Peter stayed for most of the morning. Peter had fallen back asleep with his head resting on the side of Kat’s hospital bed. Tony had taken the young man home so that he could clean up, and Tony needed to put the suit away.
Steve took another shaky breath before continuing, “When… when Peter first joined the Avengers, Tony and I were so worried. Kat, we were terrified. But we let him… try it out; let him fight without us being at his back the whole time. It was… hard – to say the least.” A tear made its way down Steve’s cheek. “Kat- “his voice broke and he tried again. “Kat, the first time he was injured you were scared, yes?” Kat nodded. “I promise you, it was ten times as worse for me and Tony. We berated ourselves for not protecting him and keeping him out of harm’s way. We were scared and it was hard to let him back out on the field.”
Sam was scared. As soon as Steve had switched off his comm, Sam had started flying over the building. When the first explosion had gone off, he'd tried Steve's comm again. No answer. He'd been flying as low as possible, trying to catch the moment Steve ran out of the base. But it didn't happen. Now... now they were all just praying that he wasn't dead.
Steve shivered again, and let Tony push him down onto the bed. He laid back, hips at the edge, and Tony pressed his hands against the mattress, by his head. Steve didn’t dare move them, his breath stuttering.
The first week, after they bumped into each other for the first time and Steve shyly introduced himself, Tony hopped onto the interwebs to see if he could figure out this guy’s deal. Was he single? Did he like men at all? Was he out? The videos Tony found were pretty self-explanatory. At least in the fact that, yeah, Steve probably knew he looked good working out.
The ride home went smoothly, and he locked up his bike carefully in his building’s garage. Maria was at the desk, and he gave her a wave as he checked his mail. He met up with his neighbors, Bucky and his partner Sam, in the elevator, and invited them over for dinner later. Bucky gave him a look, like he knew something was up, but Sam agreed easily and promised they would provide the beer, “As long as you order the pizza.” Steve laughed and agreed, just the same as every other time they hung out at Steve’s place.
Steve let him be, then, smiling softly to himself as he found the spot on the track. “Okay, so… Tony, I’ll have you start the recording and then come over and hit play on this.”
“And why do you care so much about my coffee habits, huh? Kinda cu-, um, creepy, Rogers.” Tony was starting to blush, but it didn’t seem like it was from anger… “No one makes coffee as good as me anyways. I’ve never seen you make coffee, either, I don’t trust it. Bye, have a nice day.”
More than once, Steve scrolled through his and Tony’s texts to make sure they hadn’t already made plans for food. It was almost five o’clock. He didn’t want to not prepare something if he was supposed to. Worrying about it was no use, though, after a thorough check. Steve focused on getting dressed. He put on the aqua top. The red one with the vivid orange star was fun, and, for some reason, he thought Tony would like it. But he’d worn the aqua and magenta one to film on Monday, so he needed to wear it again.
Thor surveyed them a moment before answering, “They are brainwashed, but I believe if we hit them hard enough over the head they may revert back to their previous state of mind. This will require hand-to-hand combat, and you must be aware at all times lest they strike you down.” He leaned in closer, “I do not suggest that Peter and Kat engage.”
Peter took a moment to consider what he’d just done. And looked around him at the people who were gawking at him. He turned back to his sister.
“No, really,” Peter insisted, and then took a deep breath. “M.J. says he’s been acting weird in class. Like, he’s upset about something. He won’t talk to her about art anymore, and she’s pretty bummed about it.”
Steve held the pose just a moment, and then let his leg down. He chuckled to himself, thinking he’d never seen someone turn off a camera as fast as Tony just had.
“But you didn’t notice! You’ve been so busy that you don’t have time for me anymore! Peter has been working and spending time with Gwen! I barely see any of you anymore! I can’t even go out there and help you! You would let me though! Would you? Am I less qualified? Aunt Nat helps me train, already! I certainly have no one else to be around! I have no friends at school because everyone thinks they can’t touch me because of my parents! Because of you!” Kat pointed an accusatory finger at the two men in front of her as tears streamed down her cheeks. “No one wants to study with me because they think I’m some kid-genius who will show them up! But I need just as much help as they do! I can’t spend extra time after school for help because I need to get home so you know where I am! And when I need help I can’t ask anyone because you’re all too busy! If I don’t get those study guides and the extra studying done, I
The rest of the Avengers congratulated her, and hugged her and all that good stuff before they started asking questions.
“Yes! I’m not going to break as soon as I walk into my first fight. I’m perfectly capable of handling myself!”
Tony moved over to sit on the bed, facing Steve. "Six hospital visits in the past year. Each within a month or two of each other.
Riri rolled her eyes, as if it should’ve been obvious. “You haven’t been to the break room in, like,
After Tony let go of Kat he grabbed Peter and gave him a noogie, saying, “Peter I swear if you give anyone any trouble – and girls – I will fly you up as high as you can tolerate and drop you and catch you five inches before you hit the ground.”
"I'm fine," he repeated, sharper than he'd intended. He took a deep breath. "I'll heal up in a couple days and everything will go back to normal."
“Stevie, just ask him out,” Bucky sighed, when Steve talked to him about it. “Just ask him! He probably thinks you don’t actually like him anymore.”
He found himself grinning as he left and closed the door behind himself. He walked through the halls, silently promising Steve that the next time he came back, it would be to bring them home.
Steve smiled and Tony scoffed. He’d wanted them to have better models, like and iPhone or something. But Steve was adamant that they start with an older model so they could work their way up if they behaved. Kat and Peter thought it was fair, but Tony thought that Stark children should have better technology.
“Adorable?” Rhodey cut him off, finishing the thought for him. “You see him at work, right? Ask him out for coffee or something.”
“I am not impressed,” Fury repeated. “I am blown away.” Tony and the other Avengers stood up at this.
They drove the rest of the way in companionable silence. When they finally got back to the tower, they realized that they’d lost Steve and Peter in traffic. Instead of waiting, they loaded some boxed onto one of the elevators and took them up into their correct rooms, depending on if they were Kat’s or Peter’s.
He finished writing out the routine and then pulled his leotard up the rest of the way, making sure the low cut was centered and the straps weren’t twisted. Steve felt himself settle into his video persona, his shoulders loosening and his smile widening. A pack of water bottles sat just out of view of the camera, and Steve set his boombox up right next to it, picking out a good CD. He grabbed one water bottle and took a good drink, setting it within reach, and then turned on his camera to get to work.
Kat’s head snapped to the side and she stared a moment before answering, “No. Daddy will probably make me get one for whatever event he hosts next. But I don’t want it right now. I don’t need it.”
Steve kissed her cheek and held her close. They were suddenly interrupted by a voice from Kat’s doorway.
Kat smiled weakly, “Papa, ‘safe’ is never leaving home. ‘Safe’ would be just watching out for myself and not the team.”
Kat broke from her frantic thoughts and focused on the words to calm herself, “What? Oh! Uh, yeah. I’ve always liked to draw.”
So far, Thor had managed to bring back one Asgardian. Bruce had Hulked out and had brought back two. The Asgardians were helping now, but there were still over ten of them that were under Loki’s control. Steve and Tony were having a hard time, neither of them matching the strength that Hulk had or that of Thor combined with Mjolnir. Natasha ran between all of the fights, doing her best to distract the Asgardians so that the boys could get in a few hits. The few Asgardians that were aware were also fighting. But as Kat watched, she realized that there was an easier solution to all of this.
By this time, it was about 9:00 and Tony and the twins were getting quite tired after their long day. Steve wasn’t tired because of his serum, but he knew he should rest. No one wanted to go to bed yet, though, so they put in “Raiders of the Lost Ark”. It took about thirty minutes for Kat to fall asleep on Steve’s shoulder. Peter barely stayed awake until the end. Tony helped him stumble up the stairs and down the hallways to his room, and Steve carried Kat to hers. He contemplated whether or not he should take her jeans off of her to put her to bed, eventually deciding against it. But as he set her down on the bed she began to stir. She opened her eyes and stared confusedly around the room.
Kat passed her finals with flying colours. She was going to graduate just fine. The ceremony was a week after school ended, and Kat was very excited. She was especially happy to find out that she was a valedictorian. She had worked so hard all year, and she was glad that it had paid off. Her parents and brother had greeted her afterward with the utmost excitement. Peter had wanted to hold her for hours. He was so proud of her. When Steve finally got ahold of her, he had to be careful to not crush her. He was so proud of her. Tony hugged her close and secure and murmured that he was so proud and that he loved her.
Kat felt safe. She had three men who loved her, and she loved them back. She knew that they would protect her at all cost and without regard for themselves. Okay, maybe the last part unsettled her a bit. But she hoped that they would let her prove herself when they had their next fight. She was a big girl; she could handle herself. And she wanted to show that she could keep her promise. She would keep herself as safe as she could.
“I play cello, and Peter plays electric guitar. You wouldn’t believe the kind of stuff he’s got it wired to be able to play!”
There was a patch over one side of his forehead, and scars healing on his nose and cheek. His arm was in a sling, and he could see the outline of the casts on his legs under the blankets. It made him sad to see Steve like this. Steve never let himself get hurt like this on missions. Safety was priority number one. Always.
you. You’re clever, and nice with the kids. My students always talk about you! M.J. keeps telling me how much Peter loves your class!” He huffed and his hands left his pockets, his arms crossing over his chest. He looked… insecure? “I want to meet the Tony they’re talking about,” Steve continued, his tone softening as his gaze dropped to the floor. “Can I take
Peter, Gwen, Steve, and Tony were sitting in the living room when Kat came home. They had the TV on and were talking, so they figured she would notice and at least ask what was going on. But she did the exact same thing as the day before. Tony and Steve quickly followed her. They walked in just as Kat was settling down with her history book and study guide.
Tony landed with Steve. He’d seen Peter catch Kat and flown back up to get Steve. The two knelt in front of their children. Tony looked Kat over and something suddenly hit him. Kat shouldn’t have been out this long if all she had passed out from was loss of blood flow to her head.
“Alright,” Tony said through the communications system to Kat, “try and take a few shots at the sky.”
Steve was slower to follow but hugged her similarly, “You should work on your landings more, but the rest was great!”
Tony wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of looking during class hours. It didn’t matter that Steve shouldn’t be in the building today, because Tony knew he didn’t have Thursday classes this late. Something hinky was going on. He wasn’t going to fall for it.
And making Tony totally incapable of looking him in the eye at work ever again. Hence, checking to make sure he hadn’t walked into the breakroom yet, leaving time for Tony to make a quick escape once the coffee was done. The coffee machine was still percolating. He scratched anxiously at his goatee, unable to focus on Harley’s equations. After several attempts to focus on the page, Tony stuffed it back into his paper holder and huffed. He stared at the coffee maker and willed it to go faster. Tony glanced up as the door opened again, and quickly forced his gaze to stay on the coffee as Steve walked in. Hurry the fuck up, Tony willed the coffee pot. As soon as it spat the last few drops, Tony filled his mug and replaced the pot, quickly turning to leave and rush to his office.
Steve pulled Peter into his arms and held him tight. Peter matched the embrace. Steve’s breath shook. At least one of them was safe. He’d been able to keep one of them safe. But not the other….
“I’m not gonna pressure you into anything,” he assured, even though Tony seemed very interested. “If it’s too soon, I completely understand. But I’m not against- hmf!”
“Kat, I want you all the way on top monitoring. Let us know if you see Loki or if one of us needs support. You’re our eyes.
Steve watched Tony go. Tears welled up in his eyes. Damn it. Damn it all! This shouldn’t have happened! Why didn’t Kat warn them? He ripped his helmet off and slammed it to the ground. He buried his face in his hands and tried to calm himself.
. Why did Steve have it on at school, anyways? There was no way he filmed his content here. That would be insane. There’s no way that would be approved. “You didn’t give a
“I’s actually not uncomfortable,” Kat answered. “The suit’s joints move with mine and it’s not constricting so it feels like a thick outer skin!”
Steve didn’t look up at Tony until after he finished speaking. With his arms crossed, and his shoulders slumping, he looked more hurt than angry. Tony didn’t really know what to say.
The confused expressions on his friends faces let Steve relax a little, feeling validated. He continued to explain that he figured Tony probably hadn’t really been listening to his question and just ran away from him. Because, as he figured before, Tony didn’t like Steve. This prompted Bucky to continue his insistence that Tony was just shy and that Steve needed to grow a pair and ask him out.
As he glanced behind Peter, he could see Harley and the girls sitting together and pretending not to listen. He looked back up at Peter, raising an unimpressed eyebrow. “They put you up to asking, huh?” But it wasn’t really much of a question. Tony stood to address all four of them, arms crossed, “I’m fine. Okay? I don’t know why you’re all such Nervous Nellies all the sudden.”
His whole body was sore. His legs and left arm, especially. Steve groaned a little when he tried to open his eyes. Why did hospital lights always have to be so damn bright? Someone shuffled beside him and he turned his head to look. He blinked a few times, not really trusting his eyes.
Steve made the explanation, “Kat, we are taking a break for two weeks because we all have been working ourselves too hard. You need to do the same. You’re hurting yourself! If we had known sooner, we would have intervened sooner!”
All the Avengers had gathered on top of the Tower, waiting for Kat and Tony to fly by. It was a few minutes before father and daughter flew up the side of the building and caused the Avengers to take a few steps back. Peter and Clint were grinning from ear-to-ear while the other stared open mouthed at how cool the two red and gold suits looked flying together.
Tony was indeed on the other side of the door, dressed in his usual slacks and button-up. He had forgone the pocket-protector, no pens or anything in his front pocket. His hands were folded behind his back, though Steve didn’t notice at first as they just smiled at each other. Tony revealed his hands then, holding out a small bouquet of orchids as his gaze flitted between Steve’s eyes and his tights.
Peter quickly shot out a web, attaching himself to the Tower. He swung across the street and fired another web to catch Kat as he went. As soon as he was attached to the Tower wall, he fired another web at Kat, reinforcing the first. He pulled her towards himself and scaled the Tower back down to the ground. He sat on the ground and held Kat in his arms. She was bloody from scrapes that covered her face, arms, legs, and even some of her chest and back. She was unconscious, but breathing. Peter felt like crying.
“My dear Steve,” Tony started, voice low, “are you intending to proposition me?” Steve’s answering smirk seemed to be enough of an answer, and Tony’s cheeks lit up again. “
It worked, and Tony opened up easily. “I actually got a lot done last week. Usually, I’m rushing and fighting with Richards to get off my ass. But, well, I mean, you know I was… being weird, so.” Steve just smiled at him, encouraging Tony to continue. He wasn’t really upset about it anymore. Tony smiled back and continued. “Well, I was in my classroom or office all the time, so I had a little more time, and I was keeping myself occupied so. I actually finished everything on time. Richards was impressed. T’Challa won’t call me into his office this year to tell me I have to stop getting Reed’s blood pressure up.”
Kat worked hard on her landings and getting used to the tech of her suit – which Tony had made the necessary changes to, adding a hole for Kat’s high ponytail. She was finally ready to show Fury what she could do.
Peter dropped next to her and slumped to the ground to look over her shoulder at her sketchbook, “What’cha drawing?”
Finals were almost over. He almost made it. But Thursday, the second to last day of finals week, Tony’s second thermos went missing.
“Sounds about right,” Tony chuckled with him. He sipped his water, and Steve offered to refill it for him.
School sucked, in Kat’s opinion. Especially her senior year. She was still single, and she was lonely. Her brother had been allowed to join the Avengers that year after he graduated early – perks of being a genius, Kat guessed. Peter now spent a lot of time training and with Gwen. They really were a great couple, and he saw her less than he saw his family. But Kat still felt like they were growing more and more separate. And with all her tests coming up – all the stress it piled on – she hated feeling left out. A recent flux in interstellar activity had all the Avengers on high-alert. Both of her parents and all the other Avengers were working all the time.
Kat flicked the spider off Peter’s shoulder. It went forward and crawled into the grass. They finished watching the demonstration and moved on around the expo. It was late when they decided to get home.
His team had found a HYDRA cell in their area, a few miles outside Wakanda's border. Steve was leading everyone in with help from T'Challa. They'd been up most of the night working on a plan. Hopefully, this would be over by lunchtime. He was slinking with Clint down the hallway. They were making their way toward the control room, where they could hopefully shut down the base. They found the door and Clint cracked the lock open. They snuck inside and started going through the computers. It was all going perfectly according to plan.
Tony sat in the chair next to the bed, scooting it a little closer to watch him and wait until he woke up.
Steve put a hand on Kat's shoulder. Kat shoved it off and ran off to her room. Steve watched as she ran off and looked over at Tony. They both turned to Peter.
Kat sat next to her brother. Peter was reading over the orientation packet they’d gotten in the mail – again. Kat snatched it.
First Bucky, and now M.J. It was almost laughable. Was he really that obvious, even here at school? “You know that I don’t think this is an appropriate conversation for us to have.”
Steve hurried around to clean up his apartment. There wasn’t too much to clean up, though he did make sure to pick up the paints from the floor. He set up his office for filming and took a shower. While careful not to lose track of the time, Steve was thorough. He knew he’d be sweaty later after his workout, and he wanted to be prepared. Just in case.
Kat looked confused, “But we were never close enough to be affected by the radiation, or I would have been modified, too.”
The line was silent just a moment before Rhodey pointed out, “If he’s still trying to talk to you, it can’t be that bad.” Tony hadn’t considered that. Rhodey continued, “Just see if he wants to get coffee, okay? The worst he could do is say no.”
Tony had introduced himself to Steve in the break room during Steve’s first week. His fluffy hair and large glasses – and wow, he even kept pens in his shirt pocket, with a pocket protector – were so adorable and Steve couldn’t help the little crush that instantly formed. He thought, at the time, it might have been returned. They kind of danced around each other for a while. Though, Tony seemed to avoid Steve more and more as the semester went on.
They walked for a bit longer before settling on a bench for a few minutes. The sun was low on the horizon; nearly gone. They watched it disappear.
“You only call when something’s wrong,” Rhodey huffed, though his smile was evident in his tone. “Otherwise, you text and demand I come over to give you attention.” Tony couldn’t really argue, and there was a beat or several of silence, before he heard Rhodey sigh, “Is this about the gym teacher again?”
Tony grabbed Kat from her brother and quickly flew her to the hospital. She should have woken up again two or three minutes after losing consciousness. It was dangerous otherwise.
School sucked. But it wasn’t just school. It was all the tests. Kat’s homework load became non-existent, but the amount of stuff she had to study was insane. No, the amount of pressure she put on herself to study it was insane. She locked herself in her room for hours, working on papers and reading over her textbooks. She often considered calling on one of the Avengers for help. They were all intelligent; all had graduated college. But they were all busy training and researching. Kat didn’t want to be a bother.
Kat looked at her screens. Indeed, her parents and Natasha were gathering up the unconscious Asgardians while Thor spoke with the conscious ones.
Peter's eyes went wide and he made a "cut" motion with his hand when Kat turned to stare incredulously at Steve.
“It wasn’t your fault Papa. I should have told you that he was up there. He just… got to me a little.”
Tony enlisted his help in running some tests on Peter. Tony shooed Steve and Kat out before locking the lab.
Doreen and Riri were already in the lab when he arrived, working on their duo project. They barely glanced up at him as he set up at the desk in front of the room, which was just fine. It gave him a moment to pull himself together. However, when he looked back up from organizing his papers and setting up his laptop, both ladies were looking at him. It would’ve been fine, if maybe they needed help or something, but Riri looked smug and Doreen was grinning at him. He looked back and forth between them as they both continued to say nothing.
Leaving work unnoticed was pretty easy, even wearing the large bright red and gold jacket Rhodey had given him for Christmas last winter. Tony slipped out of his office at the end of his day, his classes finished, and his office hours concluding at three o’ clock. He locked his door at exactly that time and speed walked out to the garage, only breathing easy once he was safely inside his car. He drove home to his family’s old mansion. The one good thing about living alone in such a big place, he supposed, was the privacy it afforded.
Tony hurried into the break room. He started the coffee as quickly as he could, watching the door from the corner of his eye the whole time. The coffee was a cup away from finishing the pot when Steve appeared in the window of the door. Tony looked quickly away, but it didn’t prevent Steve from entering the room. Rhodey’s insistence that he ask Steve out had not been forgotten. But as Tony was suddenly faced with the real-life situation, his embarrassment took over. There was no way it was going to happen.
“Just sketching, today,” M.J. answered, still sketching. A small smirk appeared as she switched her focus from the drawing up to Steve. “Working on figures.”
“Tony, you’re our air support. But keep it low. I need you to be close enough for your blasters to have enough force behind them.
“I can see out of the eye slots, but around the inside of the mask there’s a screen that can pull up anything I need it to: data on people outside the suit, the suit’s energy levels, video of what’s going on around me, and pretty much anything I want.”
“She thinks so,” Peter confirmed, shrugging. “I’m inclined to believe her. She’s smart about this stuff.” After a moment of Tony giving him a
Realization dawned on him slower than he was proud of, but he felt himself flush from a little more than his workout. “Are you alright?” he asked, instead of calling more crude attention to it.
Clint called for an airlift to get Steve to a Wakandan hospital while Sam pulled out his own phone to make a personal call.
Kat and Peter had made up since their little argument. It was later that summer and they had decided to go to a science expo. It would be fun for them both – Peter got to nerd out and Kat got to spend time with her brother where they were both happy to be somewhere with each other. They had just seen a demonstration of a robot and were moving on to the next booth.
The fact that it allowed him to ignore Steve was just a convenient coincidence. A perk. Well, not a perk, but it was a good thing. Probably. Especially after the way he’d run out on Steve last time.
They stopped by the nuclear waste demonstration one more time to that Peter could talk to the scientist who had presented. The same man wasn’t there, but there was a woman they could talk to. As they talked about the possibility of these scientists’ idea actually getting anywhere, Kat noticed something in her peripheral vision. She looked down and saw the spider from before climbing up Peter’s thigh, nearly reaching where he had his hand in his pocket.
Steve warned Sam and Bucky that morning. He didn’t know what all they’d be getting up to, but he did know that, no matter what he and Tony ended up doing, he didn’t want his friends to interrupt quite yet. Bucky bitched about it and Sam just winked, reminding him to use protection. Steve blushed, told Sam to fuck off, and hid back in his apartment. He vacuumed, swept, and picked up paints and tried not to think about doing things with Tony that would necessitate the condoms he’d stashed in his bedside table drawer.
Kat and Peter laughed and nodded. Their food rang up at the counter and Steve went up to get it. When they all had their sandwiches everyone took a bit together, starting their first real meal as an official family. As they ate, they talked about Peter and Kat – mostly about their musical talents.
For the past two months Steve and Tony had been spending time at the orphanage visiting Peter and Kat, or had taken them out someplace to hang out and bond. The twins had even visited the Tower, where they would be living. They had visited a few schools, meeting teachers and checking out the campuses. They decided on Elanor Roosevelt High School and would enroll for their sophomore year.
On days when Peter was not busy and Kat had very little homework, they would watch a movie together and Kat would stay up a bit longer than usual. Tony and Steve would join on days that they didn’t work late and hadn’t worked too hard during the day. But any of these days were few and far in-between. And coming to the end of the school year, Kat needed one of those days.
The coffee was taking too long in the percolator, and Tony didn’t know why he bothered to make it there in the break room instead of bringing his own. It was the only thing that could get him properly functioning in the morning. But if nothing else, he sighed, pushing his glasses back up his nose, it forced him to take a couple minutes to pause – and maybe look over some of the papers he was supposed to grade a month ago. The door to the break room opened, and his eyes immediately flicked up to see if it was Mr. Tall Blonde and Gorgeous on his break. It was not, and Tony could focus back on the papers in his hand. Sort of. His eyes kept turning towards the door.
The next chapter is going to be longer, almost two times as long. It's the climax of this story, so there will be one - maybe two - chapters after it. I hope you'll all like it!
And she did do that. She walked with her parents to the living room, where she was immediately wrapped in both Peter and Gwen’s arms. They were silent, but she knew what they would say and that was enough. They sat and watched Bambi. Kat fell asleep on Steve’s shoulder about three-quarters of the way into the movie. The others finished the movie and then Steve carried her to bed. He kissed for forehead and watched her for a few minutes before returning to the living room, from which Tony has disappeared.
Tony’s eyeroll made Steve laugh, but he was smiling, too. He accepted the glass Steve handed back to him, and followed him when Steve nodded for them to head into the office. Earlier, he’d set up his backdrop and the camera, and gotten the first small set written out on the board. He checked the camera angle again as Tony explored the space a little.
Steve kissed his daughter on her forehead, poured a cup of coffee, and went back to his bedroom to wake up Tony and get ready to leave. Kat waited a bit and went up to her room and grabbed her sketchbook before going back to the kitchen to pour herself a cup of coffee and sit at the island. She looked over her sketches from the past year. She'd drawn everyone on the team, and even Maria and Fury. She compared them to some of her earlier drawings, and saw how much more detain she'd been able to put into her recent drawings because of all her time spent with the Avengers.
“Mumbled ‘Goodnight’ and was out as soon as his head hit the pillow. I pulled his jeans off and covered him with the blanket.”
It took them nearly half an hour to get to the hospital. Once there, they had to wait about an hour to see her. When they were finally let in, Kat’s family never left her side. All seven of them stayed all night while Kat slept.
But lately, even when Steve kept trying to ask Tony out, for just a cup of coffee, Tony would rush out of the room, avoiding Steve completely. It happened again today, Tony giving some excuse about having class and then rushing off. It was like he hadn’t even heard Steve.
No rest for the wicked, Steve supposed. He just sighed and gave in, “Well, I asked him for coffee next weekend.” The pause after his answer was far too lengthy as Bucky and Sam just stared. “What?”
Steve had to move, finally, as Tony pulled down the sheets they’d been on top of, letting them lay on the slightly-drier fitted sheet. Steve curled up to Tony’s side, resting his head on his chest.
“Would the Captain and Stark please come join me on the top of their Tower. I believe I have found something of theirs.”
Did he actually need to film the last few minutes of this episode? No. Did Tony know that? Also no. But at some point during the week, Tony had let slip that he liked how Steve could lift his foot up above his head as far as he did. Steve couldn’t let such a golden opportunity go to waste.
Peter was already at the kitchen table, not nearly as excited. He was not ready for summer to end. He really liked hanging out with and learning from Clint, and it had been great spending time with Bruce and Tony in the lab. He’d been able to add more settings to his guitar, so now he and his sister could play cello together. They had, in fact, tried it out and found that it worked. Sort of. There were a lot of things she could do with her bow to make notes different that Peter couldn’t do. But it was still cool, and Kat was very happy when Peter showed her.
Peter startled and moved to brush it off, but it jumped on him and bit his hand before he shook it off and stepped on it. Peter looked at the bite. He looked over at the scientist and bid her a good evening, saying that he and his sister should get home but that he was glad to talk with her. The expo was a while from the Tower, but it was faster to walk than to brave traffic, and neither twin could drive yet, anyway.
They ate and talked some more before heading home. Tony drove while Steve and the twins started singing whatever song Steve had decided to teach them from the 40’s. Something by Duke Ellington about not meaning something, and swing. He wasn’t really paying attention; it didn’t really matter to him. He probably should look more into the music Steve was familiar with, but right now the song seemed incredibly annoying. Like something that got on everyone’s nerves after a while.
They came to the final crosswalk. The walk sign was a hand, signaling pedestrians to wait. When it changed, Peter and Kat began to walk across. They weren’t prepared, however, for the car that cam squealing around the corner. It nearly hit them, but Peter pulled Kat into his arms and jumped into the air to dodge the car. He landed five feet to the right of where they had been standing. Ha carried his sister the rest of the way to the sidewalk and sat her down on the curb.
They sat there for a while longer before getting up and walking again. They stopped and got ice cream before turning around and making their way back to the Tower. They’d make it before ten o’clock, but it never hurt anyone to be early. As they made their way back they stopped a few times and looked in windows, pointing out things they’d like but never actually buying anything. They made it back to the Tower nearly an hour early. Kat went to her room and showered in her bathroom. She pulled on some pajamas before leaving the bathroom and was glad she did. Steve was waiting for her, sitting on her bed and looking at a picture of Steve, Tony, Kat, and Peter that Kat kept on her bedside table. It was from the day that Tony and Steve had brought the twins home. It was the four of them watching “Raiders of the Lost Ark”. Tony had gotten into his security footage and taken the image.
Kat giggled, “It’s fine, Papa. I’ve been spending a lot of time with Daddy lately and I haven’t seen you as much as I would like.”
Steve turned and addressed Thor, “How do we take these guys on without getting ourselves killed, or killing them if we can help it?”
“Not quite. I mean, after last week, I thought you filmed at the school.” He walked around the back of the desk, looking at the camera over Steve’s shoulder.
Even though Steve was apparently as bothered at Tony was, Tony figured it was probably because he was pissed. Which, well, he couldn’t be blamed for. Tony certainly wouldn’t blame him. So, he worked harder to avoid him, keeping enough distance to hopefully let some of the tension dissipate. He used staircases he didn’t usually, and stayed in his office later than his normal hours. Before the week was over Peter told him one more time that Steve was still upset. It seemed like maybe it was to get him to take the first step, but it just made Tony want to hunker down even longer.
“That would be so awkward though!” Tony insisted. “I keep avoiding him whenever he tries to talk to me because I’m embarrassed about the videos. There’s no way he’d say yes.”
Steve was silent for a few moments. He didn't know if he should tell him the truth, or if he should give him an excuse. He wanted to. He wanted to give him an excuse, something that wouldn't make him worry. But Tony could tell. He could always tell when Steve was lying.
Kat let go and helped Peter sit up. He put an arm around his sister and she laid her head in the crook of his neck. They sat there for a moment, just being glad to have each other. The radio was still on and playing “Cinderella” by Steven Curtis Chapman. Peter hugged Kat tighter as he listened to the lyrics.
Tony had asked for everyone’s attention and led them all down to the lab. Kat wondered what was up, since everyone else seemed to know what was going on. Clint had a telltale smirk on his face. Thor was grinning the widest she had ever seen him. Bruce was clearly trying to hide his jitters. Natasha seemed cool, but she wasn’t making her classic “why the hell are we doing what Stark says?” face so Kat knew she was in on it. Peter and Steve were trying not to grin like idiots.
Kat raised her head, showing off a huge smile. Peter rushed forward and pulled her into a hug. Kat hugged back and laughed into Peter’s shoulder. Tony was the next to hug her, saying he was proud before Steve grabbed her and lifted her into the air – suit and all.
Really nice? Steve’s smile dimmed, placating. “Maybe he is,” he allowed, “but we’re not going to talk about it right now.” He turned away to continue wiping down the equipment he planned for the class to use. Thankfully, his other students began to trickle in, stopping any further conversation about Tony.
Steve carefully got to his feet and made sure his player was off. His own body was beginning to respond, though he stayed a careful distance away from Tony. He smiled more shyly and folded his hands in front of himself.
Steve’s head tipped back, and he gripped Tony’s elbows, pulling him over to the bed. Tony didn’t lift his mouth from Steve’s skin. He started to suck marks up Steve’s throat, and Steve couldn’t hold back a moan. Impatiently, Steve tried to undo Tony’s belt, his hands already trembling with anticipation and making it difficult. Tony simply chuckled against Steve’s jaw, reaching down to steady Steve’s hands.
Peter chuckled, “I hope so. Wade always said that the friends he made at the hospital hated school. I thought science and math classes sounded fun. Kat always liked the idea of a writing class.”
"Steve, I just didn't want to chance them finding you. I... my own tech I'm sure they can't track, anything else..." He shrugged.
He got no farther before Kat charged him. She propelled herself forward in the suit and made to ram Loki off the building. But she made the mistake of underestimating the god. He took hold of her gauntlet and spun her around, throwing her back onto the roof. The gauntlet stayed in Loki’s hand and the rest of that arm fell away as Kat crashed into the roof. She stood up and faced the god.
Steve took a moment. He wiped his eyes again and pulled Kat up into his arms, “We’re scared to let you out there, too. We have only had you two for four years, but now we can’t imagine living without either one of you. Taking you out to fight our battle with us is….”
Tony’s fingers stopped. Why did they stop? His hands settled solidly on Steve’s hips, “Hey. Steve, look at me real quick.” Steve obeyed, blushing. “You okay?”
“Peter,” Kat interrupted, “it’s fine. It is actually really cool being here. I love seeing all the designs for the machines and all the chemical reactions have been amazing. I know I don’t understand a lot of it, but it’s cool to see. And I’m just glad to be out here with you.”
Kat handed Steve the book and he and Tony looked through it, and especially over the last two. Tony was the first to say something.
Steve sighed, and then took deep breath, pouring just a bit of the coffee into his mug. He still had another class today; he didn’t want to have too much. He took another deep breath. Tony probably didn’t mean to be rude. He was probably just busy with his classes. It was the end of the semester after all. Maybe once finals were done, he’d try again. Just because Steve didn’t have a lot of papers and such to grade didn’t mean other professors didn’t. He needed to log some attendance grades, paperwork grades for his health classes, and he would need to get the fitness exam scores in, but he should be fine for another week or so. He headed back to the fitness center, letting himself back into his office so that he could change. He was lucky enough that he was allowed to wear clothes that he was comfortable in to work out with his students.  It might be getting cold outside, but nothing beat sweats and a short top – not a crop top, but only because of his teacher dress code. He put on his sneakers and moved out into the workout room, checking and wiping down the equipment before class.
So, the next day, at lunch, Steve waited in the break room, hoping to run into Tony. He was fairly certain they had the same break on Tuesdays, so he waited, watching the clock. Half an hour passed, and there was still no sign of Tony. Steve was beginning to wonder if maybe he was confused when the door opened, and Tony walked in, looking over his shoulder into the hall as he closed the door. He turned and made eye contact with Steve, and nearly jumped six feet.
“Yeah.” Steve decided to change the topic of their conversation. “So, where do you guys go to school? What grade are you in?”
Steve waited for another hour before Kat finally woke up. She was disoriented for a moment, but when she saw her Papa sitting next to her, half asleep, she smiled.
Steve’s mind raced as he watched Tony undo his belt, slowly sliding it through the loops. Any nerves Tony might’ve had before seemed to have evaporated, leaving this confident,
He knocked solidly on the wall between his apartment and Bucky and Sam’s. He set the pizzas up on the coffee table and pulled up Netflix as he waited for them to let themselves in. The door opened soon enough, and Steve was looking at another assignment on his laptop as Bucky approached, ruffling Steve’s hair before flopping down on the couch next to him.
“I love you, Kat. And I am scared to let you be a part of this team. Tony is scared. Peter is scared. Tony and I are still scared for Peter sometimes! Well, all the time. I just... I need you to promise me something.”
He shut off his comm and then focused on his work. He finished with the files and then hurried to get out of the room. He heard the first explosion go off farther away in the building, and started to run faster. Another explosion went off and shook the ground a little. It was closer, and Steve was starting to panic. No, no he needed to get out! He kept running, pushing himself harder. A third explosion rocked the hallway and he fell forward. He caught himself and then pushed himself up and started running. Just another turn... one more and he'd be out.
Peter led Tony into the building. Kat turned to Steve and they just looked at each other for a few moments.
Steve frowned, pressing the button for the bed to push him up into a sitting position. "Why are you here?"
Half an hour before class was supposed to start, M.J. walked in, sitting over on a bench and pulling out her sketchbook. Steve didn’t like to say he had favorite students, but M.J. was definitely a favorite. She wasn’t a wellness major, just taking his class to fill her general education requirements, but she always arrived early to sit and draw. Steve had been an art student at one point, and still liked art. He also enjoyed expressing that in new ways – like wacky, old-fashioned aerobics videos.
“I hate to break up this wonderful moment, but we should get to the hospital. I’m sure you’ll all want to know how she is.”
Steve looked around. She hadn’t landed. He looked up. She wasn’t in the air, either. He tried to reach her comm, but it had disconnected.
Bruce shrugged, “It’s probably not instantaneous. Different components of the radiation will probably be revealed within the next month or so, judging by the rate it’s affecting Peter’s cells.”
The first few weeks of Kat’s summer vacation were spent learning how to use her suit. It was easier than it had been for Tony, since she had someone to guide her and who knew how the mechanics in the suit worked. She’d asked about what she might need to learn about said mechanics for maintenance and other things, but Tony said he would take care of maintenance so she only needed to know some basics – which he was happy to teach her.
“Tony and I already packed them for you guys, all you have to do is check it over. You have time. Sit down.”
“Sorry,” Steve sighed, once he had it under control again. “I’m not used to this, I guess I’m just… really glad you’re here at all.” He figured he probably ought to start some conversation, “How did your grading go?” That was a safe topic, something good to get them going. “I didn’t have a lot of paperwork to get in, but I imagine you would.”
“No, I changed in my office,” Steve said, starting to sound pretty frustrated. “I… There’s equipment in the gym I needed for something, it doesn’t matter. Tony, just give me a second to-”
A new blush spread over Tony cheeks, and Steve found he liked it just as much as he had the first time. “Um, well, I mean…” Steve grinned wider.
Bruce reached out to touch the ropes, “Oh my God, Tony. It’s spider silk. It real, actual spider silk!”
Tony stared at him like he’d grown a second head. “Why?” he asked, instead of answering. “Are you stalking me? Why were you waiting in here for me?”
Saturdays were new video days. Tony didn’t really like that he knew that. He glanced over at the laptop, and decided that today, he would not give in. During breakfast, as he scrolled through the news, he kept telling himself, no, he wasn’t going to watch today. He tried to grade a few more papers that he’d had to set aside the night before, but he was still distracted. Tony sighed, biting the bullet, and pulled his phone out to call Rhodey. At least he knew when to call in the cavalry.
Tony's smile widened just a little and he nodded, opening the door. He looked back at Steve, "Take care of yourself, Cap."
Today was the first day, and Kat was very nervous and excited. It would be her first time in a school building. When her alarm clock went off, she nearly fell off the bed in her surprise. And being tangled in her sheets didn’t help. She had showered the night before so she had a bit of extra time to get ready. She pulled out her favorite, long t-shirt, one with a “Lord of the Rings” movie poster on it, and a pair of skinny jeans. She pulled her black flats from her closet and slipped them on her feet before going down the stairs and into the kitchen. Summer had been nice, spending time with each of the Avengers and doing all sorts of things around town to occupy herself, but she was ready to try school.
Kat thought a moment before answering, “It’s fine around my hips and chest. But I would love somewhere to let my hair out. It’s sticking to my neck and chafing.”
But there came one day, the Monday of finals week. Finals would be much easier than all the other tests that were for graduation. But Kat was stressing out even more. She wasn’t thinking about how easy the test was. She was just thinking about how there were more tests to study for. She planned on spending another afternoon and evening completing study guides. She made it home as normal, making sure she grabbed some food before hurrying to her room.
“I found your, um, workout videos. I think it’s a really neat thing, cause that’s a… a genre not a lot of people do. The whole 80s… aesthetic, I mean. And you’re, I mean, you’re really good. The way you can stretch your leg up all the way like that? That’s really impressive.” Tony swallowed hard, feeling like he was starting to ramble. “And then I couldn’t stop watching them, because they’re good, your production value is actually really good. But I kept running into you at work and I felt bad because, I mean, I know what you look like in tights and they’re actually really fun tights, and I was so embarrassed and nervous to keep talking to you, so I didn’t and-”
Tony felt his face flush more, which made Riri laugh and nudge Doreen, “I bet it’s because he saw Rogers in the break room again.” She looked back at Tony, eyebrow still raised, “Was he in gym clothes? Sometimes, he wears crop-tops to work out in.”
Kat sat back down and happily went back to her ice cream. Steve smiled and cleaned up his dishes. Kat finished her ice cream and rinsed the carton before flattening it and putting it in the recycle. Steve was still leaning against the counter waiting for the coffee to finish brewing, so Kat stood next to him.
“First of all, it’s only been a week. Second of all, he’s not my man.” He saw both Doreen and Riri open their mouths to argue and barreled on, gesticulating. “
“Peter, you’ve read this a billion times. I’m surprised you haven’t memorized it yet!” Kat scolded. “You’re just going to stress yourself out.”
Tony stepped quickly inside, like maybe Steve would close the door on him if he didn’t move fast enough. Steve closed the door and took Tony’s coat, hanging it up before motioning for him to follow Steve into the kitchen. The one vase he owned was in the back of his glasses cupboard, and he set a couple cups by the sink as he moved them around to find his vase, offering Tony a drink.
“No! They wouldn’t let the audience volunteer.” Everyone thought Peter sounded a little disappointed.
Kat was offended, “No! You two are so fun to be around and are definitely the sweetest couple I’ve ever met!”
All things considered, I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, because I don't write smut, but I think chapter turned out pretty good anyways.
God, Tony had been such an idiot. Steve was just trying to be nice, asking how Tony liked his coffee; offering to fix it for him. And what had Tony done? He’d insulted Steve’s coffee and called him creepy. How awful was that? Pretty damn awful. Terrible. Horrible. No good, very bad. Steve was so sweet, and Tony ruined it.
, Steve,” Tony huffed, his bravado failing as his hands flew up to his face, covering his cheeks and fidgeting with his glasses.
Steve blinked at him, looking a bit taken aback at the rudeness, but he let it slide. “My scheduled final time was today. I had to give a test.”
They stared at each other for a minute or so longer before cracking up and following Tony and Peter.
He hadn’t really tried to make it better, either, unfortunately. Rhodey told him he ought to, and he knew that. But the thought of looking Steve in the eye after an incident like that made him feel ashamed all over again. He just couldn’t do it. So, thermoses it was. He tried his best to be quick in the halls and stay in his office and classrooms only. Once or twice this week he’d almost been caught by Steve, but he managed to get away. Hopefully he could just hold out until after finals, and then let things calm down over the break.
“Black,” he blurted, after a moment of silence. Steve blinked, obviously unsure what Tony meant. Tony cleared his throat, “That’s how I like my coffee. Sometimes with sweetener, but only with breakfast.”
The workout was fairly easy for him, as he went through the warmup, the workout, and then the cool down stretches. After he finished, he sat on the floor and folded one leg close to his body. He held his other foot, and lifted it above his head, fully straightening out his leg. He switched legs, stretching the other the same sway, and grinned, winking at the camera, as always.
Tony frowned a little to himself, chewing on his bottom lip. “Well, only if you come over to eat ice cream and watch
Steve tuned them out, but he didn’t really mind their bickering. It was kind of sweet that they cared. Bucky was probably right though. He needed to be more direct with Tony. It was a Monday, after all, maybe it had just been a rough morning.
He couldn’t say much else, either, because as he almost made it to the door, Steve blocked his way. The movement forced Tony to look up, away from the tights, and meet Steve’s eyes. Steve’s cheeks were flushed, and he looked about as red as Tony felt, but much angrier. Tony was almost afraid for a moment, but Steve just stayed back against the door, his hands clenched in his jacket pockets.
“Hi Rogers, bye Rogers, got shit to do, have a good day, etcetera, etcetera,” Tony babbled, rushing past Steve and out of the room. He didn’t look at Steve’s face, barely resisting the urge to check out his legs and ass as he left.
Steve finished his stretches and got into his correct position, checking his board one more time before asking Tony to start the camera. As he worked through the sets, he kept his focus on the camera, trying not to blush too hard at the thought of Tony watching him. Between his sets, he asked Tony to hand him a water bottle. Tony didn’t say much at that point, but he did nod at Steve appreciatingly. Steve stood to change the board for the second sets, and noticed how Tony shifted, almost hiding himself behind the desk and camera.
“Just water is fine, thanks,” Tony answered, his hands tucked into his pockets. His fingers were still visible, tapping against his thigh, even hidden in his slacks.
The video froze, finished, and Tony quickly shut the laptop, sighing heavily at himself as he walked towards the bathroom. He showered and went to bed, curling up with his back facing the desk. He determinedly kept his hands above his belt, not wanting to add to his shame. God, if he did that, he’d have to change schools probably. He’d never be able to look Steve in the eyes again.
Steve just held her for a while. He didn’t want to do anything else. She was safe now, and that was all that mattered – to him anyway. It wasn’t long before Kat started asking questions. Steve told her to wait for Tony and Peter to return because they would want to help answer her questions. The two men in question soon arrived, and were delighted to see Kat awake and well – as well as she could be at that moment. Peter hugged her as tightly as he dared. Tony settled for a kiss on her cheek, knowing that she would receive enough doting between Peter and Steve.
Tony watched them for a moment before sitting next to them and running a hand through his daughter’s hair. Kat cried and cried, finally releasing all her pent-up emotion while being comforted by her fathers.
They all went out that night to celebrate. They started at a local diner, everyone ordering some type of burger. They spent the rest of the evening around town just walking, talking, and admiring the displays in the store windows. There were several times that one of them wanted to stop in somewhere, so they all agreed to meet back at the Tower by ten o’clock. Eventually, it was just Kat and Steve walking together.
“Don’t stop stretching those legs!” Steve would say, grinning and winking at the camera, capping off each episode with his foot stretched up over his head, showing off his impressive calf and thigh and…
Despite all they'd been through, he couldn't deny that, well, he still cared about Steve. And hearing that Steve was being so reckless... it was a little frightening.
This time, though, he didn’t bring an alien race from the depths of space. He had with him a score of brainwashed Asgardian warriors. Everyone rushed to prepare for the battle that was about to begin. Kat was putting her helmet on when Steve ran up to her and pulled her into his snug embrace.
“I saw you go over,” Peter explained. “I didn’t know what was going on up top. Dad and Pop could have been busy, so I caught you and brought you down to street level. Pop and Dad were down soon enough, but you weren’t waking up so Dad flew you here while the rest of us followed.”
“Oh, c’mon, Stark, you can’t tell me you never noticed!” Riri laughed. “Not with all that mooning over him you’ve been doing all semester.”
Steve rolled his eyes and finished putting in the grade for the assignment before setting his laptop aside. “You couldn’t even wait to ask, could you?”
“Are you trying to kill me?” Tony burst, hand dramatically clutching at his chest. “You’re trying to kill me, Steven. Aren’t you?”
“It’s only a couple years off,” he defended. “Besides,” he added, smirking, “I can tell everyone my boyfriend picked it out for me.”
Finals week had been stressful, not only with testing and getting his grades finished and submitted, but with his Tony situation. He kept trying to find him, or run into him by ‘accident’ to see if they could talk it out. Tony kept away pretty well though. That was before M.J. brought a large thermos into the final. Afterwards, she handed it to Steve, saying he needed to give it back to Tony in the break room. It was terribly suspicious, but if it
“Kat,” Tony started, cautiously, “you don’t have to do these all at once. You could do these other two, tomorrow. It’s a lot less to immerse yourself in at one time, and you can get in some relaxation time afterwards.”
When everyone made it back to the tower, Peter and Kat pulled their instruments out to the family room. Peter hooked up his guitar to his amplifier and Kat tuned her cello. Steve got Tony to sit on the couch and wait for the kids to be ready. Peter and Kat were finally ready and got their new parents’ attention. Kat started, playing a piece she’d once played for a recital when she’d taken private lessons. Tony recognized the song as “You Raise Me Up” and Steve thought it was very beautiful the way she played it. When she finished, she gave a nod to her brother and Peter started to play the guitar solo from “Hotel California”.
Peter and Kat finished what they remembered of the song and then looked to Tony and Steve. Steve was still getting over his giggles and Tony was smiling, trying not to laugh at his husband and new children. Peter smiled and Kat started laughing. It was humorous to see that their new parents enjoyed their little attempt at a joke. And they were proud of themselves for being able to pick up the tune so quickly on their instruments.
“He said that there was nothing special about me. That I was only allowed to join the Avengers because you all felt sorry for me. That Daddy made me a suit because he had to since I have no powers.”
Steve frowned, “Kat you’re working yourself a little hard. Didn’t you already study all this for other tests? I’m sure you’ll be fine!”
Kat laughed, “I’m not an Avenger yet, and I won’t be until Fury approves my skill. You don’t have to worry so much!”
Steve and Tony looked at each other before Steve answered, “If anyone treats you wrongly for any reason, you have the means to get ahold of us. You have the cell phones we gave you, right?”
“The energy isn’t like the tesseract! It’s like something we associate with the tesseract! We’ve been running the wrong kinds of scans.”
He knew that Clint didn't want to leave him behind, but there was no sense in both of them being caught if they could still get information. Steve couldn't let any of his teammates be found, but he wasn't afraid of getting caught. If anything happened, it was what he deserved.
Tony raised an eyebrow in a way that made Steve’s face warm, but he handed over his glass, “Sure. Thank you.” He leaned over on the table as Steve stood at the sink. “So, I thought you were just filming a section. How long are we going to be in there?”
“But I was uncomfortable and I didn’t want her to be. Besides, she woke up! What if she’d woken up and I had her pants around her ankles?”
“I can’t believe you’ve never been here before,” Tony said, once they had gotten settled in the booth. “It’s great. I thought you would have heard about it and visited by now.”
“Yeah,” Tony answered, quickly. “I’m fine. Ready to film.” He gave Steve a small salute, and a smile.
Tony cut Steve off with a kiss, much quicker than Steve had managed in the break room, and with much, much more heat. Steve’s arms immediately wrapped around him to hold him close as Tony’s hands pulled Steve’s head down. His cheek bumped against Tony’s glasses, but it barely registered as Tony parted his lips and coaxed Steve to do the same. Even though the slide of Tony’s tongue against his was delicious, Steve had to break the kiss to breathe, since he’d been surprised.
Tony pointed at them, “Alright, okay, that’s enough. You forget that I have the ability to fail you both.”
Tony was supposed to be avoiding him. Right? They hadn't made contact, even though Steve had tried, had sent the letter and the phone. Tony never called. Never wrote back. Not even to tell Steve off, which he would've been fine with. And he'd been here several times within the past year, so why was Tony here now?
“Kick their butts in P.E. okay? Climb up the wall if you have to.” He grinned. He knew she couldn’t do that yet, but she was pretty sure he wanted to teach her.
Steve laughed and kissed her forehead. Kat kissed both her fathers on their cheeks and followed Peter into the school. Tony and Steve got back in the car and drove home, spending their first day in about two months without the twins.
him.” Keep up on his aerobics videos, maybe, but not stalk. “I just think he’s adorable and his videos are adorable and his outfit is honestly really-”
Steve turned around and saw Tony standing in the doorway. Steve smiled and walked over to Tony. He put his arm around the smaller man and began to lead him down the hallway.
Kat smiled as she watched Peter drowsily pour himself a bowl of cereal and try to pour milk on it. He sat himself next to his sister and looked over her sketches with her, marveling and how much better they'd gotten over the past year. They finally made it to the last sketch. Kat didn't turn to the final page.
Kat frowned, “Pop. Dad. I need to ask you to let me be to study. I have to pass these tests, and these study guides are specific to the tests and I know what I need to do to catch myself up on everything else. Please?”
To celebrate the successful move, they went out to dinner. Steve and Tony wouldn’t tell them where until they got there. It was a nice surprise when they pulled up to the Shawarma. Peter and Kat had never tried it and were very glad to be able to try some. They ordered and sat down, laughing and talking with each other.
“Okay, sweetheart,” Tony purred, leaning down to kiss Steve again as he finally let their hips roll together.
Homemade, 80s-style, aerobic workout videos were not at all what Tony had been expecting. But there they were, featuring BMCC’s very own Mr. Rogers – in gaudy leggings, a leotard, a skin-tight crop top, and, damn him, a bright pink sweatband – doing stretches and exercises that certainly didn’t leave much to Tony’s imagination. Or much question to whether he might be queer. The leggings, really, were what gave him away, Tony had thought. Tony also tended to think about how far he was able to spread his legs. It was truly insane, how flexible Steve was.
Kat shrugged, “I don’t know. Chill, I guess. I don’t really have anything I have to do now that it’s summer.”
The girls were looking at him expectantly, and Harley looked like he was about to laugh at him. Tony pointed his finger at them each in turn.
After a few minutes, he broke the silence, “What’s the project today?” He liked being able to talk with her about art. Bucky didn’t exactly know much, no matter how much Steve ranted to him about it.
They made small talk on the way to the school. And Tony complained a lot about not being able to use the Iron Man suit to take his kids to their first day at school; how it would have been easier and faster than the traffic. Steve just shook his head and the twins laughed. When they finally pulled up to the school, everyone got out of the car. Steve and Tony stood on the sidewalk with Peter and Kat to see them off.
Tears were in Steve’s eyes as he explained, “It was the scariest ten seconds of my life. I didn’t know if Tony would catch you. A million different scenarios ran through my head about how terribly it could have gone. Tony came up and told me that Peter had caught you and I nearly lost it. Tony flew us down and then flew you off almost immediately. I… I blamed myself.”
It was a similar demonstration to that which Kat and Tony had done for the other Avengers. But Kat was flying solo this time. She shot down some targets that were set up around town and flew in a few patterns that Tony had taught her. She was doing perfectly and it was quickly time for her to come in for a landing. She was nervous, but she took a deep breath to calm herself. She touched down on the blacktop that covered the top of the Tower. She looked Fury in the eye through her mask. He motioned for her to lift her mask and she did so. They stared at each other for a few moments before Fury cracked a small smile.
“It’s definitely more affected than the rest of his body.” Tony turned to Peter. “I think the venom may have reacted with the radiation and passed the spider’s abilities on to you.”
Out of the corner if his eye, he saw Tony frown. "You know, that's, like, the universal saying that means you're not okay. Talk to me."
Kat smiled at Peter, “I appreciate your concern, Pete. But I wouldn’t be doing this if I wasn’t certain. I would rather be helping and adding to our chances than sitting at home or in a safehouse hoping that everything turned out okay. I can defend myself, and when I have a full grip on my suit I’ll be fine.”
“But you don’t have a mother, do you?” Kat froze again, making Loki smile wider. “You never had a mother. She abandoned you and your brother to die on the streets. You were lucky, having been taken in. No one wanted you.” Kat’s blood started to boil. “Does anyone, really? Why did they adopt you, hm? Why let you join their team? Because they felt sorry for you?” Kat felt tears beginning in her eyes. “You have no powers. Nothing that makes you special. Even Stark is perhaps the most intelligent man on the planet. You? What do you have? A suit your ‘Daddy’ built for you? And look. It’s already breaking apart. Daddy must not have been too concerned with your safety. Or perhaps- “
They’d eaten late, so upon entering Kat’s room they found her sound asleep on her math book. Tony moved the book from under her head and Steve pulled a blanket over her. They were going to catch her tomorrow after school. Surely she had all the material practically memorized? Besides, she should have a day to rest her brain. Peter and Gwen could be there, too. They hadn’t spent time together as a group for a long time.
“Okay, okay!” Steve said, holding his hands up. “I’m sorry. But we worry about you. It’s because we love you, Kat, not because we think you’re incapable.” He put his arm around his daughter.
“Kat, baby. You picked up on how to use that suit so fast that it made my head spin. You may not understand all the mechanics or science behind it, but you pick up on things very quickly. You have good instincts and reflexes. And we are all lucky just to have you in our family, much less our team.”
