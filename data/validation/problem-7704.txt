"I… I honestly don't know, Stevie…" Bucky answered shame written on his face causing Steve's lips to tremble and for his hands to rest on his belly. "It depends on Howard; he is the one who decides what goes in the family. Tony… Tony would do anything Howard says just to be on his good side and gain what he wants; that's how the family had been for decades. Though I am optimistic that Howard would leave you and Morgan alone, especially when he is trying to play his games of you go through the divorce and Tony married Pepper… Pepper would refuse to raise Morgan if that happened, which would give you the advantage of gaining full custody." Bucky's words made Steve lower his head, the tears finally running down his face as Bucky's words resonate in his head.
"Yo, Rock of Ages, I want to know why are in my house? It is rude to show up without an appointment." Tony asked with narrowed eyes, already feeling too tired to snap and exchange harsh barbs with the newcomer, Tony just wanted to go and hide in his room, until it was time to go and see Steve's grave (Tony and the Avengers managed to host a respectable funeral for Steve, burying what Tony managed to gather from the stardust Steve left behind him) and cry until his heart stopped hurting.
It was a few tense minutes of Tony glaring at Bucky and Peggy; his arms were tight around his crying baby as he took in how Peggy kneeled down and started to collect the pieces of articles Tony managed to steal from the library yesterday. It was only when Bucky and Peggy finally left closing the door behind them that all the strength left Tony's body, causing him to let out loud sobs as he slides to the floor, chocking when his eyes took in the blood of Steve Rogers that was disappearing in front of his eyes and the living room once more was back to its perfect state…
Steve was too frozen to protest at Bucky's action; part of Steve was embarrassed at the thought of Bucky coming with him to his appointment, another part was thankful that Steve won't be leaving the house alone and risk finding another note in his car. Taking a few breathes to calm himself Steve went to the fridge, pursing his lips when he found a few sticky notes that Steve put there hoping that Tony will see. Cursing himself for his stupidity, Steve took a pen from his pocket and wrote on a note.
"Good morning, sweetheart, ready for breakfast?" Tony asked even when he didn't want to leave his bed, even when he wanted to spend the rest of the day hiding away under his blanket, fantasying about a world where Steve didn't die and was with Tony and Peter when they wake up. "I am sure Aunt Peggy and Uncle Bucky already finished preparing the food," Tony said, finally gathering the courage needed to through the blanket away.
The sun nearly blinded Steve when he was out of the mansion, but Steve gritted his teeth and bear the strong light that seemed to reject him. Peter shifted in his embrace, causing Steve to take a deep breath and look toward what he hoped was the road to safety…
So what do you think?
The Omega looked at the Alpha harshly, not fearing what the Alpha will throw at him next, after all, he was used to people like this, arrogant kings who think they can rule the world and bend everything to their will. "They would have never served a tyrant willingly, they too, suffered from their family being killed and raped and were forced to work under the same people who did the unspeakable to them daily, I am offering you a deal, I will become your slave in exchange for their freedom… I know that you realize how much value I hold." Those words made the king seethe in rage and he pulled the Omega's left arm through the bars harshly, making the Omega's head hit the bars, an action that gained him curses and threats from the prisoners behind him and a glare from the said Omega, but the king didn't care, the Omega's words rub him the wrong way.
Maybe Tony should finally listen to Pepper and take a vacation, he was sure that if he asked Steve, the Alpha will jump on board with his plan so the two of them can have at least a few weeks to themselves before returning back to their busy schedules, and maybe… maybe the two of them will finally take the next step in their relationship… the thought made Tony flush at that and look at his hands, it was true that the two of them lived together and took care of the small pup as a family… but not once did the two even entertained the thought of sex…
"You have a child?" Steven asked, wanting to change the subject farther away from the sanity question, and he thanks his lucks when the female answered the question and forgot her earlier line of questioning, which made Steven relax a little and listen to the female words.
"N-no, it's OK, I don't mind, though I hope you know what you did are dangerous, little mister." Tony frown at the pup who was puffing his cheeks looking like an angry rabbit, it was one thing for the pup to run when his parent with him, it was another with him trying to sneak off without his parent, and not to forget that the pup nearly got kidnap nearly two weeks ago, that memory nearly made Tony tense and snatch the pup from the floor and hide him in his arms which was weird…
Steve looked at him like the sun shining out of his ass, and Tony could only groan, why? Just why does the universe hate him? "A date!" Steve peeped happily, gazing at Tony with too much cheerfulness to be natural. "I will stop terrorizing everyone in the mansion if you agree on going on a one date me." Tony raised his eyebrow, and he had to give it to Steve, the crazy Addams knows how to make a deal, but that's not a surprise considering that he most likely deal with the devil on a daily basis.
"OK, kids, wave goodbye now," Tony called out, waving to Steve with a smile, feeling a little sad when his husband was out of his sight; looking at the children, Tony tilted his head when he saw the gloomy look on their faces, causing Tony to hum and look around the place trying to think of how to cheer them up. "What do you say about having a movie night? It is the weekend so you two don't have anything tomorrow, we can even build a pillow fort if you want!" Tony clapped his hands with a smile, internally sighing in relief when Peter started cheering up and dragging Harley inside, informing Tony he was safe for the next few hours.
"I know you hate it,
As soon as Jarvis finished, the door to the communal floor was blast opened and Wanda walked through them with a blood lust grin on her face; Steve's eyes could only widen, and his heart pounded in his chest, Steve could only thank his luck that he managed to convince Bruce to take Peter away from the tower to Pepper's apartment, because from the look of it, the tower was going to be destroyed as well, just like the mansion. "I found you…" The witch grinned as she tried to attack Tony, only for Natasha to try and shoot her.
The child said in Icelandic which made Johann look at the child in confusion than at Steven, it was only a second before rage clouded the Alpha's eyes, the Omega was teaching the pup a barbaric language behind his back! That caused the Alpha to snarl and he nearly attacked the Omega but he was stopped by the same redhead woman with green eyes…
"It was alright, though, they start boring me in the end," Tony stated with a satisfied smile on his face and the dark twinkle in his eyes that told Steve everything he needed making the assassin let out a dreamy sigh. Steve could only purr in content as he steps on the gas harder until the speed reached 250 KM/H, which caused Tony to do nothing but giggle and grin madly, ignoring the screams and shrieks from the people outside when they early ran them over.
"What is the catch?" Anton stated with a resigned voice, already knowing that there was no fighting the elders when they made their orders known, especially if 'Fury of the Seven Seas' decided to stick his nose in Anton's business, and Jamti knew that Fury had returned from his voyage a week ago to do just that, but at least Fury was the only reason that Anton was given the chance to choose the person who Anton will share his life and wealth with.
Two weeks and finally, Betty called Tony telling him that they can come and get Harley any time they liked, causing Tony to bite his lips and thank her, before closing the phone and squeal in delight at the thought of Harley finally being home; everyone was excited, especially Peter (Before getting bored about having to wait more time before Harley come home) now, they just have to wait for Sarah and Howard before they are sit.
In 2000: The interview with Tony.
"I am not whoever you think I am Commander Rogers, I am not the villain you painted me as!" Pepper called out when Steven was about to leave the room which made the man pause in his place and turned around to take the woman in, taking in her fierce glare as she gazed at the man with fear hidden in her eyes.
So what do you think?
Serpentine's mad cackles made Tony wince and let out a sigh, turning to his Pepper and Rhodey who were pale as ghosts, having seen Steve torturing someone for the first time since they have known him. Bruce had already run out of the room when Steve started his torture season, not too keen on letting the Hulk out with all the madness and screaming that was taking a place. Natasha was wincing, but she was tilting her head as if she was engraving this torture season in her mind, probably thinking of it as an opportunity to expand her torturing technics. As for Bucky… Bucky was looking at Steve like the sun was shining out of his ass, sighing and like a lovesick schoolgirl, and letting out a giggle here and there making Tony really concern about the man's mental state.
"We really should stop meeting like this." Tony said as he ruffled the pup's hair which made the pup squeal and runs behind his father giggling as he hides from Tony's hand, which made Tony laugh a little at that. "So you are Sarah's artiest son, I should have known." Tony said with a small smile which got him a smile from the Alpha.
!" Serpentine snapped sharply, the action causing Tony to blink his eyes and look dumbfounded at the ghost. "He wasn't my
Hearing that, hearing Steve calling his name, remembering his name, made Tony smile as the call disconnected and he let go of the missile closing his eyes, Steve remember him… the last thing he remembered before closing his eyes, was him praying to God to give him another chance, just another chance to see Steve… to tell the Omega that he still loves him after all these years, after all the pain and hurt and betrayal, he still loves the small Omega who captured his fragile heart.
All Steve could feel when he saw Tony direct the missile through the portal was emptiness and pain, his child spent that day crying because not even Iron Man could survive, even when Tony hurt Peter, the pup still see him as a parental figure of some sort, and the Omega doesn't even know how that happened… as for Steve, who couldn't even focus on the phone call he got, his Omega screamed and cried as he saw his once-Alpha disappear from his sight… Steve, no matter how much he hated Tony, he didn't wish him such a painful death, lost in space with blackness surrounding him until the air run out and he was left to choke in a metal coffin.
"Oh, God…" Peggy breathed out as she tried to hold in her sobs which made Steven turn his gaze away, hating that he was the one who caused Peggy to cry, God, how many time was he the reason that his loved one always ended up crying and heartbroken? Tony, Peggy, Bucky, his friends… when will the list stop?
"I told you I will kill you if you touched him!" Steven snarled, delivering every word with a punch, which made everyone back away unconsciously, what happened a month ago flashing in front of their eyes, Tony though he gathered himself and rushed toward Steven, taking a hold of his hand, before he destroyed Rogers' already broken nose.
In any other situation, the shock on Tony's face would have been funny, but not today; today was too much, too much to handle that Steve felt like he was going to bend with the weight he was forced to carry. "I… I wanted… I thought I… I thought I could protect the two of you, so I stayed in the lab trying to…" Tony's voice was small when he said those words, but even then, Steve didn't want to listen to them, and he didn't want to hear one of Tony's futuristic delusions.
"You will be the first to say that, I don't think Steve had the same courage to say what you just said." Peggy said as she looked down at Asgard once more, her mind kept drifting to what Steven said to her, the smile refused to leave her face. "How was Tony in his last years? You said he lived until he was ninety-five, right?" Her question made Steven smile at that, eyes going distant a little as he remembered his late husband with a small smile on his face; he then opened his mouth…
Howard frown at the sight in front of him, part of him was feeling many different mixes of emotions, another part was feeling nothing but numbness; that numbness was usual though, for Howard had felt it for the last fifty years, so it was normal, not something that Howard will give a mind to, or think about it much. But the first part was making him crankier than ever, for that part too should be feeling numbness, and not that many mixes of emotions that leave him confused and irritated.
"Talk…" Steven hissed as they reached the workshop, glaring at the Alpha and taking a dark pleasure in the flinch the man let; serve him right! What did the man expect Steven to do after the accusation he throw in Steven's face, smile at him, and play coy? In fact, the man had a few seconds to talk before Steven rips his eyes out and throws them to the birds.
Even Morgan seemed to sense something was off for her cries turned into quite whimpers as they both heard the closet door slam opened, followed by screaming and cursing and the sound of fighting. Tony could only huddle with Morgan away from the hidden door, tears running down Tony's face as he prayed over and over for a miracle or something; he can't believe this, he can't believe this madness, not only did Tony met Steven Grant Rogers in the flesh but it looked like Tony and Morgan were the reason for his death, what's going on for heaven's sake?!
I hope I was able to help with these little notes…
Tony held his baby tightly in his arms as he stood on his shaky legs, going to the landline, he wondered what would Pepper and Rhodey say when Tony tell them about what took place here, he wondered if he can run to them if they have a place for him and Morgan to crash at until all of this madness disappeared. Would Peggy and Bucky follow him back to New York and drag him back? Would they throw him in the lake as a sacrifice? Would they hurt or kill his friends if he told them what happened? So many questions that Tony doesn't know the answers to; but in the end, Tony hoped that he would have enough time to gather his things and run away. Run away just like the Rogers family did years and years ago.
It started like that, and Steve doesn't know if he should laugh or cry; Steve doesn't know why Tony finally got his shit together when Steve nearly died, why now? Why not before? Why when Bucky saved him and nearly got shot? Why not when Steve begged for a sliver of Tony's attention? But beggars can't be choosers; Steve would handle anything if it meant that Tony would return to how he was before everything happened.
It was strange how the time passes in a blink of an eye after Anton died; he had a hard time looking at Midgard, looking away every time he passed the realm of mortals, but the few times he dared to gaze at the realm of his beloved he was baffled by them, especially by the way they started counting time in a strange way, it left him wondering why would they start counting their times from the beginning from the number 1 when they have been clearly living over 50,000 years, but mortal were strange like this, they were not like Asgardians where magic and science live together side-by-side and the history of the worlds' written in their archives.
"What about the rules you gave me months ago? Should I forget all about them now? Because of the way you are speaking informing me that I can do whatever I like, whenever I like without even a punishment. I do not need bribery if you think it will make me closer to forgiving you." Steven tensed when the king stopped in his advance, waiting for the man to come and strike him for his ungratefulness.
"What do you know about him? Did you know about Tony's plans of eloping with him?" Peggy questioned the Beta which made his face darkens even more.
The hitched breath and panicked scent coming from the Omega alerted Steve who was about to enter the children's room, he then turned to Tony and Maria with a pinched look on his face. "It will be better for Peter." Steve ends up saying after a while of silence which made the Omega turn to him with a glare. "He will be able to interact with children his age and will have therapy while he is there, you can even finish and come here to play with him, or you can take Peter with you to the therapy, and in the end when the time comes, he will still be afraid of any adult he sees, and will never be able to make any social interaction with any person, because he never learned 'how', which will end up destroying his self-esteem. No pressure, it's your choice." Steve said while he nodded his head, turning to the glass door when he heard the children screamed his name, which caused a smile to come over his face and gave a goodbye nod to the group as he entered the room, only to be surrounded by children.
"Can I have blueberry pancakes?" Peter asked, raising his arms in demand of Tony to carry him, which Tony did, he leaned down and plucked his baby from the bed, letting out a happy sigh when his boy snuggled closer to him. A year ago, if Tony dared to carry Peter like this, his little boy would have chatted his ears off, talking about everything walking under the moon and sun, telling him about what happened in school or what was his plans for the day… ever since Steve died, his baby became too quiet, too shut down on himself, gazing at any door they came across as if he was waiting for Steve to open the door and come in.
Steven let out a sigh and bit the inside of his cheek, already knowing what the king meant… how many children, such a hard question with a harder answer. "The ones I birthed or the ones I adopt?" Steven ended up asking, for the king's question has many answers, and could go either way; Steven had many children and he grieved for every one of them, some more than the others. The king let out a choked noise, turning to Steve with wide and disbelieving eyes, and even Steven won't fault the king for looking at him this way, for no Omega will care for a child they have not birthed. "Six in total…" Steven ended up answering the king's question, trying not to think of the king's wide eyes and hitched breath. "Three of my own womb and three I raised; all of them are dead except for two," Steven stated but didn't answer more of the king's questions. "Why the soft heart all of sudden, foolish king? This is not you." Steven finally pointed out the king's strangeness the two of them were dancing around.
"Where do you want to go first?" Steve asked which made Tony look around with a grin, looking for his first place to visit after such a long time, he looked at Peter and a big smile took over his face, heart fluttering in his chest when his baby looks at him and give him a toothy grin.
Poor Harley…
, why you must take my breath every time I see you?" Steve sighed happily, which only succeeded in causing Tony's left eye to twitch.
Tony was… Tony was going to die; Tony was going to die in Thanos' hands… Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony! Steve's breath hitched as he stood on his shaky legs trying to support himself and rush to save his lover…
Steve's breath hitches as he reached a secluded area away from people, he just wanted to cry, scream, and shout. Was it too much to wish for his baby to live? Was Steve so bad of a person that God punished him such a punishment, why Peter? Why not him? Steve sat under one of the trees looking at his hands blankly. Today… today he left Peter who cried his eyes with May, before coming to the park so he can cry too…. Because believe it or not… Tony Stark died three days ago… Steve had thought that the day that Alpha will die he will spend it laughing in happiness, after all, he deserved death for killing Bucky and making his baby cry, he was so cruel to his baby… everything was going great May said until Tony Stark heard his child name, then he was a jerk to him, Steve would have understood if the Alpha didn't want to see his child, he would have understood it, but how could his heart allow him to break his son's heart? His sick son minds you that could die any day now.
Tony tried to argue with himself…
So what do you think?
"Sorry…" Tony muttered, breathless. "Got excited." That made Steve give a little laugh. His hand begins to move up and down on Tony's cock, and Tony buries his face into Steve's neck, hovering over him. It feels so good to touch each other after such a long time; both of them could only make low noises at the way they remembered how to touch each other just right.
"That was all Edith if you want to learn, just ask her." Steven said as he took his glasses off and cleaned her good, before returning her to her place and gaze around the destroyed conference hall with a grimace. "Sorry about that." Steven said which made Tony gaze around the room and then shrugs his shoulder, a pout taking over his face at that.
So far Peter was the most enthusiastic one about the baby, going on and on about finally being a big brother and taking the baby with him on adventures and all the other things ten years old would say before pleading with their parents to give the baby to someone else so they could sleep. Harley on the other hand was still a little bit unsure about the baby, probably feeling threatened by the arrival of the new family member; no matter how much Tony and Steve tried to assure the boy of his position in their family, Harley was still walking on eggshells, clinching to Steve and Tony every chance he had as if he was afraid they would kick him out. So far the numerous visits to Betty and many family therapies didn't work out, no matter how much Steve and Tony tried to make Harley see that he was one of them.
There stood Pepper smiling as she chatted with a human Natasha and Bucky (Since when the two returned back to their former selves?) how in the name of every holy thing did Pepper manage to come inside the house without something attacking her? Tony wasn't unhappy with seeing his friend, but the thing was Tony know he will die by her hands if she realized what Steve and he were up to last night, and haven't Tony forbid Pepper from coming to the mansion?
A heavy accented voice stated behind Steve making the Omega blink his eyes in confusion and turn to the speaker, raising his eyebrow when he saw an old Beta man with glasses behind him, the Beta was humming and looking around the place with wonder on his face; now what got Steve's shocked was not the strange words that the man spoke to him (Steve finally placed the accent, Germany.) but what the man was wearing. In addition to the glasses, the man was wearing a lab coat over his button-up and pants that were held by suspenders. the man surveyed the sweets on the shelves without turning to Steve, making Steve wonder to himself if the Beta meant him or was talking to himself.
"Steve? You are still here?" Bucky's voice made Steve jump and turn around, wondering how he hasn't felt Bucky with him in the same room; maybe Steve was really out of it more than he thought. "I thought you and Tony left an hour ago, did you finish your appointment already?" Bucky tilted his head, taking Steve in with a searching look on his face.
"OK, hold on, Miss witch!" Tony snapped glaring at the woman that was taller than him by a few inches, which made him buff with irritation. "First of all, you can't just come into my tower, into my own goddammit office, and threaten me. Second of all, why are you threatening me when it was your cousin who is chasing after me even when I told him no. If you want someone to blame for the upcoming heartbreak blame your cousin, he is the one who is still chasing after me, even when he has ten other people running after him hoping that he will notice them!" Tony growled glaring at the woman who blinked her eyes in surprise.
The shock on their friends' faces was priceless, nearly causing Tony to start laughing until he was on the floor; Howard nearly choked on the drink in his hand if it wasn't for Harley patting on his back and looking like he wanted to be anywhere but this awkward atmosphere.
"We did it for your own good, James." Tony said as straightening himself, trying to show James that he wasn't affected by the way he was talking down at all, his action only gained him a snort from James and a sneer of disgust. "Just tell me, what did you think you were doing by taking Steve away huh? What was your goal? Obviously, he would have answered the phone after the first time I called him,
Today was the day that Tony will learn if he was having a baby boy or a girl, he never really cared about the baby's gender was, only caring about them being healthy, though he can't deny the excitement that course through him. When his name was called, he was about to jump out of his skin, rushing to the room with his heart pounding in his chest, ignoring how his friends rushed after him when they noticed that he moved from his place.
"You know, Stark is not that good for you, Steve, please, just forget about him." Bucky said when they reached his room, causing Steve to still a little frowning at his friend, darkly ignoring the glare Bucky sent his way. "Look Steve, I don't know what Stark did to you, but he is not good, he is as normal as they come, he doesn't understand what makes you, you! And if he had it, he would have changed the best of you and turn you into nothing but normal, why can't you understand Steve?" Bucky plea, causing Steve to press his lips tightly and try to shake the hands that were latching into him which caused Bucky to glare at him, not a few moments later Bucky's hands left his arm and latched into the front of his tact gear, pulling him down.
"That's all I need to hear…" Steve grin at the Omega, who squeezed his hand one last time before letting go as they both heard Peter whine a little, and sit up rubbing his eyes as he woke up slowly and raise his one of his hands wanting to be carried. Tony's lips twitch in a smile as he raised his baby so he can sit in his lap, which only successes in making the pup purr loudly like a cat and snuggle in Tony's chest smiling happily as he saw Steve. Tony can't help but thinks about Steve's words, his mind repeating the words over and over again which made the Omega held his pup tightly to get a little comfort.

"No, I'm not going to tell you their name, go and ask Clint for it, or go and confess. I want my phone fixed by next week." Steve grumbled making Natasha growl but huff and put Steve's ruined phone in her bag.
So what do you think?

"Follow me." Odin said which made Steven hum at that and follow the king and queen, not taking his eyes off of the man's back too distrust of him. "So you have met my counterpart…" Odin hummed giving Steven and the Avengers following him a flitting glance, raising his brow at Steven counterpart.
It took months for things to go back to how they were before the incident, but they were finally there. Months for Peter to stop flinching every time he looked at Steve until he eventually starts trusting him once again; now he won't leave Steve out of his sight, finally concluding that Steve was not an evil person in any manner that he was just trying to help. Months before Steve opened up to Tony once more, slowly, so slowly coming back to how the two of them were before they went down, Steve teaching Tony how effective communication is for them to evade a misunderstanding like that again. Months before Steve starts sleeping inside Tony's room once more with Goose, causing both Peter and Tony to sigh in delight because then it meant that the two of them will have a full night of sleep without nightmares. It will take time to go back like how they were before, a lot of time to put all of this behind them and start over again, but Tony remains hopeful.
It was stupid… so, so stupid to feel like this… this unbalanced over an Omega… an Omega, Anton did nothing but fought with and made fun of or humiliated in some way. A growl left Anton's throat, as he made sure to pick up his sword, hoping that leaving the village for a day would calm his racing thoughts and would stop him from trying to kill everyone that came to talk with him some way or another. A day away from the village would surely help clear his mind and thoughts; the prey he would catch would even make good salted meat for the Winter solstice, not a few fortnights from now... Anton bet that this 'Daniel' couldn't even catch his dinner without tripping and demanding the Omega's help.
"Not too much ice-cream, tomorrow is movie night I can't have Peter hyped up on sugar when tomorrow is coming." Tony stated, giving both Steve and Peter a narrow look, gaining giggles from the two of them as they waved goodbye to Tony and left the workshop; it was only when Steve was away that Tony finally noticed.
a small part of Steve was hurt with how casual he was thinking of Tony leaving him and their daughter, but it wasn't like Tony made him think of anything else with his constant absence and uncaring attitude; as much as Steve wanted to blame Howard for what he did to Tony, Steve knew that unless Tony acted like that willingly, even Howard can't control him to do his bidding.
"A question at a time Pete, we need to find the star first, later you can ask all the questions you want." Tony reminded after a while, causing the boy's eyes to widen in shock and outrage, like he was surprised that he forgot his original quest in the first place, with that he jumped from the couch pulling Steven with him to the big windows surrounding the living room they were in, thankfully it was night and not morning which made Steven think what kind of tantrum the boy will throw if it wasn't, you can see the stars shining brightly, and it was the first time since Steven arrived in Midgard that he gazed at the night sky, and it caused longing to take hold of him as he gazed at his home.
"No, baby, no, your Papa is a good man… He is Captain America… who are you going to trust if you can't trust Captain America?" Tony whispered to the shaky boy, hating himself for causing the confusion and pain that shone in his baby's eyes. He hated himself for thinking that things could go back to normal after what he did, he hated the rift he caused between his baby, Alpha, and himself… But the thing that he hated the most was Stane and how big the man's hold on him was even when they were miles and miles apart. Tony could just have as destroyed the only good thing that was in his life ever since he was free from Stane's hold…
I had two Stony stories that I'm working on, one is a Christmas story that I may or may not update, and the other is a heartbreaking one, the two of them are Omegaverse, I was wondering if people are interested in the Christmas story or the other one so I will start writing them, and updating them when time is right.
Thinking about that always made Anton's heart give a pang of pain and hurt, it always made him want to curl around himself and let out a broken whine full of agony and despair. If the sweet Omega was to see him now, he would have been embarrassed by what Anton would have become, an Alpha who never married even when he reached the age of thirty-one spring, an Alpha taking care of an orphaned child without a mate or someone to help him, an Alpha who was what everyone considered a demon, even by his own people. Maybe, maybe it was for the best that his love moved on, at least then Anton won't drag the sweet Omega with him when he falls down to Hel.
"Let's go…" Steve said before going to his room in Shield HQ to get ready… an hour later they were all in vans that were heading to Obadiah Stane's house or mansion as the fucker liked to brag. Steve was sitting in the van with Peggy, Natasha, Clint, and Fury. He was leaning on the van's walls behind him while wincing with his brows furrow.
Suddenly lights start flickering on and off, making Clint frown and look up, he saw a movement in the mirror which made his heart jump. He gazes with an opened mouth as he saw the bathroom curtain move to the side, when Clint turned to the tub he saw the curtain in its place… unmoved… that caused a shiver to rake Clint and he turns his gaze to the mirror, he can hear some light pulps exploding in the distance but he didn't care… because he was sure that he saw something.
"How are you doing, Peter?" Steve asked after he took their plates and put them in the sink which made Peter smile and chirps out '
A big F U to Stane who will make an appearance in the next chapter…
Steven wonders what his mother will do when she would look at him now; would she wail and sob and curse the fate for what happened to him? Will she take a knife and thrust it in his heart for what he had become? Or would she look in disgust and flinch away from his touch? It was possible, all of the above was possible and not at the same time, and Steven will never be able to know because his mother was dead… his mother was dead and Steven didn't even have the honor and courage to give her an honorable burial before he was dragged to the south to be Johann's captive.
It took time before Tony and Steve managed to get the story out of Harley's mouth, and when they heard what Harley went through; the two of them barely managed to stop themselves from searching for Harley's previously foster home and destroy them for that they did to their son. Needless to say, the days after Harley's breakdown was spent reassuring the boy that they won't abandon him and that a new baby won't change that. Tony and Steve doubted that Harley believe them, especially with how attached he became, refusing to leave Tony or Steve alone unless it was to school; even Peter was having a hard time managing to get through Harley, not being able to move Harley from their sides even with the promise of going to their corner in the workshop.
Steve can't calm down, and he won't, especially when he was called when he was with Fury in a meeting, only to be informed that his husband was in the hospital; the reason for that? Peggy fucking Carter! How did that woman even come here? She knew damn well not to come near Steve or Peter at all, what did she do? She came into his home when he wasn't there and did something that ended with his husband being thrown in the hospital.
"Enough, Stark!" Bucky's snarled snapped Steve from the near panic attack he was about to have, and the weight of his husband was pulled away from him, which made the blond man take a few deep breaths as he backed away, gazing at his husband who was looking at his brother like he was going to kill him any minute now. "Steve, please go to your room, I will lead Tony to a guest room." Bucky said gently which made the blond relax a little and give Bucky a grateful nod at that as he took a step away only to hear a low growl that made the hair on Steve's body stand on its ends.
It was tempting though, moving away from Brooklyn and starting a new life for himself and his baby, away from the memories of Anthony and the pain and betrayal, Steve didn't have anyone here, not anymore, not since Bucky and his family moved away and left him here, not since his mother died, and Anthony left him alone, it didn't take more than five minutes for Steve to decided and ask the older man to take him to see the house…
Now Steve felt like he was stupid, he knew he should never have asked Tony, especially when it will hurt so much when he will get rejected; Tony squeezed his hand when Steve tried to pull it away and gave Steve a soft smile. Seeing Tony without the stress weighing him, made the sting of rejection bearable, even when it still hurt a little. "Yeah, yes, I would like that." Tony smiled, causing Steven's heart to flutter a little bit.
" The king smiled darkly a mad glee shining in his eyes that made Steven flinch and bring his child closer to him. "
"Do you want to adopt him?" Tony questioned, wonder painting his voice. Tony knows that if Steve and Peter were already feeling this attached to Harley, then they were possibly thinking about adopting him into their pack; probably they couldn't do it, considering that Tony as the Omega of the house has more say than both of them.
"I never meant for this to happen, Anthony, if I could go back in time, I would have changed everything…" Howard said in a choked voice, not knowing what to say anymore as his gaze never left the suffering Omega, that looked at him with betrayal, it seemed that his son forgot that Howard also didn't know about the pup until after his death. Until after he start looking for him until he start uncovering the truth... until he learns how rotten Obadiah was that he will get rid of his grandchild just to get rid of any competition to have Tony as his... until Howard charged Obadiah with every felony known to man that the Alpha ends up going to prison and stop destroying his and his son's life more than he already did. The Alpha knows that no matter how much time passed, he will never get the trust and the relationship he had with his son back, he knows that now… now Howard was really alone because he not only lost his grandson but also his son who refused to even look at him in the face without seeing his pup's murderer, he knows that no matter what he did he could never gain forgiveness, for that boat had long since sale and left him.
"Steve… I…" The Alpha didn't let the Omega continue as he rushed out of the kitchen, his heart feeling like something had ripped it out and stepped on it before throwing it back to him. The feeling intensified when he saw the small pup flinch away from the Alpha, tears running down his flushed face as he ran to hide behind Tony… and Steve… he really needed to get out of here, he needed to get his breath back… he needed… he needed Bucky…
If you want, go check on my Valentine's Day one-shot!
"Funny, how I seemed to miss the debriefing package that seems so necessary." Tony mock, ignoring how Natasha twisted her hands nervously before she opened her mouth to apologize. "I don't want any apologies, I want you to finish this damn story, so continue." Tony huffed, being grateful that even after all the noise; Morgan didn't wake up, which was good.
It took a while for the ringing in his ears to go away, and when it finally did Steve managed to focus on Tony's frantic voice coming from the speakers; Steve heard Tony screaming and pleading with him, begging him to talk, to answer him, to tell him where he was… raising his head, Steve desperately stretched his hand to catch his phone, only to freeze in his place when he saw someone wearing black boots standing in front of him.
And now here Tony was in debrief with Fury and the team, trying to learn everything about the Winter Soldier in hopes of helping him, not that Fury wanted to help them out of the kindness of his dark little heart, no, but the thought of two super-soldiers was too much to pass, especially when one of them is The Winter Soldier. "Can you please explain this to me, Barnes?" Fury asked as a video start playing. In the video, the Winter Soldier strapped in an electric chair, it was then that Tony knew that they are going to see a torture video, which made Tony tense a little, preparing himself.
At least I hope you will like the chapter. The next one would be better.
"So where did you two go to? I can't imagine that you will take so long as to return the next morning." Natasha asked her eyes were cold and hard as they took Tony in, making the genius wince and tried to back away when he saw Pepper tilt her head in confusion. In the back of his mind, Tony begged Rogers not to take the bait that Natasha throw; Tony was so going to die…
It had been a year and a half since meeting Steve Rogers and his sweet pup… a year since the two of them starts dating… and God, Tony didn't feel this kind of happiness in a long, long time. It all seems like a fairy tale to him, how Steve and him start dating, how the two of them moved in Tony's big house after dating for three months only… Tony knows that everyone thinks that the two of them were moving fast, that the two of them should slow down, especially with a pup being involved in their affair… while the two of them seemed to move too fast for everyone to really approve of their relationship, Steve and him were actually comfortable in the direction their relationship was heading to…
That's how Tony ended up at Angie's diner, thinking his life through and pouting like five years old who was scold by their mother. It wasn't that Tony wasn't grateful for everyone for being considering really, but isn't that an overkill? I meant, he was only in the town for four months, but everyone in the town does nothing but make sure that Tony rest or worse give him free stuff even when he wanted to pay for them, sometimes it's just too much; Rhodey on the other hand, was happy with this high life, even Pepper seemed to agree with him, which was not cool.
"Coming!" A cheerful voice called out, making the woman tense as she waited for the unenviable, wondering if she made a mistake coming here, but not having it in her to back away; the door opened slowly, and the woman stood straight, accepting what is to come with a brave look on her face. "Oh… hello, can I help you, Ma'am?" The young man who opened the door asked, and the woman's eyes could only get wider at the familiar face she was seeing if only she can put a time or a place to the youth that was looking at her with concern.
Sorry for the short chapter I'm a little busy to write anything other than this.
"What the…?" Tony muttered to himself as he stretched his hand toward the slight, furrowing his brows when he felt a breeze on his fingers, tilting his head, Tony put his fingers through the slight, raising his brow when the wall seemed to give away and slide to the left. It was then that the door behind him was wrenched open (He didn't even know it was close!) and Rhodey came nearly ran Tony over with how frantic he was.
"Dammit…" Peggy mutters as she got something out of her drawer. "Here Steve, you can have my phone until she finishes fixing yours…" She said making Steve smile and take the phone from her.
The first thing the Omega did was checking on the small pup, frowning when he saw the child holding the toy the Omega gave to him tightly, the dried tears on the baby's face made Tony hate himself, made him feel like he was scum for making the sweet child cry when the pup wanted nothing but happiness for Tony, the Omega kissed the boy's forehead gently, covering him when he saw that the blanket was about to fall off of the bed.
"If you don't shut that trap of yours I will rip your tongue and feed it to you!" Steve snarled causing the raccoon to yelp in fear and click his mouth shut, looking at Steve with eyes that informed Steve about his succession in installing fear in the small rodent… Steve guessed he had to thank the stars' reputation of being the most violent bunch in the universe when crossed. A false adverting, but one that the stars enjoyed and craved because it gave them peace from many who dared to do something to them; stars by nature, are peaceful beings who loved helping, loved lightening the way for those who travel their domain, loved writing history and learning, they don't fight unless they had to.
Steven struggled to keep his breathing even, resting on the floor crossed legs with the sofa to his back, he was struggling hard to meditate, to calm and collect himself after what he learned, calmly daring anyone to move near him and try something, so that Steven may strike without feeling guilty at all, thus far everyone knew not to disturb him or else, even that purple wearing idiot, the only one though that seem to love pushing Steven's buttons was Anton, which Steven swore he will murder him and get rid of him this time, by himself!
Poor Tony! Poor Pepper! Poor Rhodey!
Before Steven managed to hit the Alpha on the head, a gasp left his throat as his eyes fell on the Shield in the man's grip; part of him couldn't believe what he was seeing, wondering if this was a trick of the imagination, another part couldn't help but walk closer to the man, raising his hand and tracing the star in his sight with wide and nearly wild eyes. "How…?" Steven whispered the question in a soft voice, not wanting his voice to break if he spoke louder than needed. How did the Alpha find his Shield when Steven spent years searching?
"Oh, you don't say, Mr. 'Leave My Harley-Baby Alone Or I Will Kick You In The Nuts'" Steve said back, causing Tony to hide his face in Steve's neck as he held his laughs, remembering the day one of SI's guards nearly pulled Harley and throw him out of the building just because the pup wandered away from Tony's side… needless to say the man quit the next day and start working on the docks after Tony was done with him.
"Who… who are you?" Steve ended up whispering, not knowing how to act around the woman that clearly seemed to know him, while Steve on the other hand can't even place where he saw her or if he even knew her. At his words, the woman's face fell, and a sob left her, the distress she was emitting was causing the baby in her arms to let out discomfort noises which made Steve's attention zone to the baby immediately.
Tony wrote heart beating like a crazy, usually Tony will leave his home for the clinic at 10 AM but if Peter and Steve were going to come with him, then the three of them needed to go to the clinic earlier, hopefully, Tony and Steve will be able to talk with some of the therapists about Peter and what's going to take a place with the pup.
"So… what it's like spending the first night in here?" Natasha asked after serving Tony most of the food, which made Clint whine only to get his head slapped by Natasha, who glared at her husband, that action made Tony let out a laugh before he turned to his food, letting out a happy moan after the first bite, Angie was really a queen in the kitchen, her food was the best Tony has eaten in his life.
"I am sorry baby, but you can't really play with Harley now," Tony murmured his words getting a loud protest from Peter who was looking at Tony like the Omega just stepped on his metaphorical puppy. "Baby, Harley… Harley is tired right now, he can't play even if you wake him up, just let him rest for a little time before waking him up." Tony said instead, it was better than telling his son about how Harley ran away and how close the three of them come to losing him.
"y-you can't do that…" Tony stuttered looking at Steve and then at his pup, his face becoming flush at the idea of the Alpha staying with him in his room, he nearly starts having a panic attack, why would Steve sleep with him in his room? His bonded or not the Alpha should respect his privacy!
"Oh, oh! What did they want? What did you do? Is the Red Skull alive too? Were they after Captain America's serum? What happened?!" Peter squeals as he looked at the Alpha while clutching his shirt tightly, hoping that the man will tell him what took place in detail because not every day a supervillain organization will return back after forty years of nothing.
"It's… it's nothing… I thought it was nothing you know… it's just that Pepper and Tony had this on-again-off-again relationship since college. That's why I was surprised when I saw you open the door all these months ago. When I left Tony and Pepper were already engaged, so I was shocked to learn that he married else... someone like you." Bucky explained his words were like a knife to Steve's heart, especially when Steve didn't even know about Tony and Pepper and them being engaged.
"The best? Maybe… but they are not trustworthy, Bruce is the only doctor I trust in this place." Steve said which made the group go still, if Steve said that he trusted the Beta in front of them then that spoke a lot of how talented and smart that Beta was to get Steve who has trust issues trust him, but the first part of Steve's speech, made Peggy and Howard look at one another narrowing their eyes at the doctors.
It was hard; the past month was hard on Tony, it was crushing and scary, and Tony thought he will end up crashing before the month was over. He was scared; scared of someone that didn't even exist, and how is that even possible? He was sure Ty was real, he was sure that he met him with Rhodey and Pepper; Tony remembered the unpleasant words and wondering hands on his body, he remembered the cold metal of the knife, threatening his baby's life. He remembered.
"Oh? Is that so?" Steve hummed amusingly as he took a step after step toward Bruce until he was towering over the shivering scientist. In the back of his mind, Bruce was wondering why the Hulk didn't show up, was he as scared as Bruce was that he decided to hide and never show up?
Opening the door, Steve paste a comforting smile on his face, trying to calm his baby down, his baby who was looking sicker than when Steve left. “Mommy, I don’t feel so good.” Peter stated with a tired voice, his hand coming to wipe his nose, Steve sighed when he saw that Peter used his sleeve to do the wiping, coming near Peter, Steve was about to stop his baby from wiping his nose again with his sleeve, only to froze when he saw a line of red slowly making its way to Peter’s upper lip; his baby was having another nose bleed, the third one this day...
"Shit… you made them angry…" Tony laughed nervously as he looked around, he can already feel the anger Steve and Serpentine were emitting in the room, slowly but surely, Tony slide down his chair, waving goodbye to Fury (It could be the last time he sees the man alive) before hiding under the table, kicking out the idiot PR member who thought hiding in Tony's hideout was a good idea… it was then that the screams started…
After four hours of Steve hearing Stane's confessions, he stood up making the room go silent. "Take him to his cell…" Steve said that in a low voice, making every person in the room flinch and tries to give Steve a wide birth as the Alpha took the file and walked to the door. When Steve got out of the room and walked toward his office he heard rushed footsteps heading toward him making him turn to see an enrage Howard marching toward him.
It wasn't like this…. Years ago it wasn't like this, when she first mated to Howard, it was an arranged marriage, yes, but the Alpha wasn't like this. He cared, he cared about her, and he cared about his friends, and he cared about his son, and their happiness… that was until Obadiah. She doesn't know what that bastard did to her mate, but it changed him, it destroyed their family, and destroyed Howard's friendship with his friends, after that instead of the kisses she got from him, she will only get a fleeting glance once every blue moon, with the reminding that she needed to get ready before their guests arrived, after that, the words of praised Tony always got for inventing robots and circuits turned into looks of disappointment and resentment for being smarter than the older Alpha, after that Jarvis who used to come to their house with his wife on Sunday for dinner never set a foot inside of their home after their last fight, after that the close friendship Peggy had with Howard turn into dust… it destroyed everyone…
In just two weeks… two weeks, three at most, Harley was finally going to come home; Tony was excited but nervous at the same time, wondering what would happen when Harley would finally come. "Two weeks, three at most, that's what Betty, said, right?" Tony asked, letting out a sigh as he felt Steve tightening his arms around him…
…" The voice said in wonder, a giggle could be heard hidden deep within it, and when that thing raised its clawed hand….
Steve read and reread the message ten times, a sick feeling in his stomach that nearly made him throw up, he looked at the claw… Dum-E, then he looked at the door, only to see the door and the surrounded walls were full of scratches and small holes… nearly five years ago, the time the AI mentioned… it was the time of Tony's kidnapping… and Dum-E here, Dum-E tried to save his creator… while all Steve did was take a nap in the arctic… "I don't know JARVIS…" Steve replied, not taking his eyes off of Dum-E… This was his entire fault…
Steven said finishing with wearing his pants and start ripping the top part of his dress, lips twitching up when he saw James's face flushed as he looked away from his mother, hiding behind the blanket, it was the first time his babe saw him in anything but a dress.
"It is rude to ask an Omega about their age, everyone knows that, but considering that you are nothing if not a rude person my age is 32 summers…" The queen reply, which made the king frown and snorted into his cup, it seems that the Alpha spoke too soon, the Omega was infuriating.
"What?" Tony snapped after opening the line, hoping that the person at the end of the phone would be able to feel the anger that Tony was radiating off him… Tony could have been cuddling his amazing Omega now! Kissing him and kissing him until… Well, maybe Steve will even accept for Tony to bed him! But now he was forced to answer a call he doesn't even want to answer. Tony though, frowned when he realized that it was his aunt who was calling, and his face paled a little when he heard the situation they were in. "I will be there in 15 minutes top." Tony said shakily as he closed the phone, looking at Steve wanting to explain but the thing is he doesn't even know what to tell the Omega about his dilemma.
"He may not be your problem Howard, but don't forget you are the one who starts the problem in the first place." Jarvis said, irritation shining in his eyes as he tried to reign himself in before he started another fight with Howard, his idiotic friend who was too cold and stoic and more stupid than he was years and years ago. "You know, sometimes I wonder, what would have happened if you just let Tony be. I know for certain that Tony won't be that dreaded Iron Man who throws his life away every time he can; God knows that I have enough of Peggy doing that. I also know that Peter will finally know his father and that he will be happy, living with his mother and father's warm embrace, even if he will end up falling sick, at least he will have his parents from the start. Maybe, just maybe, Tony wouldn't have ended up here today, begging God to save his mate that everyone knows will end up dead by nightfall." Jarvis clutched his clipboard tightly in his hands, not wanting to do something rash like punching Howard in the face.
So what do you think?
"It's either that you are an idiot or good at ignoring what I say." Steve said through gritted teeth as he hissed at Tony making the Alpha tense a little, fearing that the Omega will punch him in the face any minute now. "I told you we are over, Stark! I want nothing, absolutely nothing to do with you!" Steve nearly growled at the Alpha before huffing and massaging his forehead from the coming migraine that promised him a painful day. "What is the thing that you don't understand? Anthony Carbonell is dead, and in his place there is… you. So, please, leave me the fuck alone." Steve stressed his words hoping that they will finally make their way to Tony's thick skull.
"A letter… from whom?" Tony asked as he stood up to stretch his legs, and walk toward Bruce who shrugged and gave Tony the letter when he stood near him, Tony blink and took the letter, gasping as he read the name, his gasp made everyone turn to Tony who became pale and opened the letter with shaky hands nearly ripping the thing off.
! The thing was both Rhodey and Pepper heard about Serpentine's promise, and both of them shrieked until Tony became deaf, and agreed to go with Steve.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence (?), feelings, mention of past abuse, mention of rape, panic attacks (?), therapy, fluff; And Tony finally gets his shit together after screaming his head off about something… And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Steve stayed silent for a few minutes before he opened his mouth, only to close it; Tony swallowed when he finally saw the crushed look Steve was sporting and how Steve's glow deem until the star stopped shining, why? Didn't Steve realize that with Ultron they could win against Thanos? Didn't Steve realize that he will be safe because of Ultron? Why would Steve give him this look? "Every time… someone tries to end a war before it starts, innocent people die… Every time, Tony…. I saw it, for a thousand of years I saw it…" Steve took a shaky breath as he pulled away from Tony before shaking his head and turning around to walk away leaving Tony alone in the lab…
"What's going on, Steve?" Peggy had asked wincing a little as a doctor got smacked in the face by the restrains the Beta throws at him, a few cursed words, made the doctor whine and hide behind one of the nurses that were cowering.
Steve smiled at the childish actions of his husband, accepting Tony's hand as he stood up; ever since the supermarket accident, Tony seemed to warm up to Bucky. They still glare at each other and huff when something doesn't go the way the two of them wanted, but they stopped fighting and screaming at each other, and for Steve that was a huge step up from how the two of them used to fight and blame each other for silly things.
"Calm down, baby doll, I can hear you thinking all the way over here," Steve murmured after an hour of their wait, causing Tony to blink and give Steve a nervous smile; it was hard for Tony to calm down, especially when he was thinking about how Harley was doing at home, and let's not forget the baby he was carrying.
Whatever Howard was planning to say, it was cut by the high shrill sound that made everyone raise their heads in a panic to gaze at the sky. The hair on Steve’s body raises on its ends, for the sound was almost familiar… like the sound of missiles… and panic sized his heart when he saw something falling in his front yard with a crash, throwing dirt and dust everywhere and causing a large hole to form in his front yard. When the cloud of dust finally settled, Steve lowered his arms that were covering his face to see what caused the destruction in his garden, only for his breath to hitch when he saw Tony, his poor Alpha looked like death warmed him over even with the suit covering him, half of the metal on his arms and chest were melted to some degree.
"Who knows? All I can say that Thor has grown up." A soft smile took over Steve's face as he remembered the look Thor send him before going back home. "Now that Thor is away and you probably don’t have anything good to do, I was promised a shawarma by an annoying genius so..." A playful grin took over Steve's face when Tony snapped a sharp 'Hey!' his way…
If you were wondering Steve looks just like he did in 'Infinity War' with the beard an all and yes he is huge nearly six feet five, as for Tony we are taking RDJ's real height without the lifts he wore in Iron Man 3.
"He… he is in shock…" Starkad murmured, his eyes darting around the place trying to find something that will help him stop the bleeding, not finding anything, Starkad cursed as he ripped his left sleeve, and pressed it to the Omega's abdomen, trying to lessen the bleeding if he couldn't stop it.
Finally! Sorry for the long wait but was a little bit busy.
The king swallowed, his eyes darted from side to side before stilling on Steven who shuffled in his bed until he was sitting up, pushing the furs away from him and relaxing when he saw that his clothes were still on. "What… what kind of information?" The king finally gathered the courage to ask, and part of Steven wanted to scream and curse at how the king was playing the innocent game, why would he lie about the information that Steven gave to the king? Information that made him win most of his wars against Johann.
"How is it, Pep?" Tony called out through the walkie-talkie, as he adjusted the hidden camera until it was pointing at Morgan's crib. After finishing the outside of the house, both Rhodey and Tony agreed on working on Morgan's room before the two of them called it quit and continued their work tomorrow.
"I mean you coming late last night after promising me to return home, you came home drunk Tony, you fought with your brother when he tried to pull you away from me! What do you mean I am making no sense? If someone you should call Bruce for then it's you!" Steve snapped, he was sure that his voice was loud enough to wake up the dead, he ignored how his husband gazed at him like he just killed his puppy, how dare his Alpha to look at him like that when it was Steve who was hurting on the inside?
Tony furrow his brows at James actions, he knows his brother, he also knows that a loose punch like this would have made James dodge it, not stay in his place and gaining a black eye in the process, why would James do that? He will gain nothing from this, unless… "Bucky!" Steve's panicked voice made Tony's eyes widen in disbelieve, his jaw fell when he was pushed by Steve who rushed toward James to check on him. "What did you do Tony?" Steve snapped after checking over James and help him sit up, Steve than stood up and glare at Tony with anger that caused the Alpha to take a step back.
"Hello, you must be James; my name is Steve, Tony's husband." Steve said with a smile as he extended his hand toward James, which did nothing but made the man stare at it like it was an alien, then he blinks, making the Omega give a sad smile and lower his hand, already feeling the disappointment creeping inside him at how the man was acting.
Steve shook a little as he tried to make sense of what he had experienced in the past hour; part of him was still in shock, while the other was shaking in fear at the events that took place not too long. Tony, his Alpha was still on the phone, screaming at police to hurry up, giving his back to Steve and Bucky as he cursed loudly. Turning toward Bucky, Steve winced when he finally noticed the injury on the Alpha's face, how did Steve not notice? Bucky's face was a bloody mess on one side; his left eye had a serious cut above it and the beginning of a bruise.
Tony was so deep in thoughts that he didn't hear the rustle behind him until it was too late, Tony let out a choked scream when someone gripped him from behind and pulled him away from the deck. Tony screamed and tried to thrash away from the strong grip pulling him from his hair, chocked on a scream that wanted to be let out when the person behind him gripped him around his neck, flashing the knife in his free hand which made Tony freeze in his place and stops thrashing, his eyes refusing to leave the knife.
A sob left Tony's lips, followed by another and another until tears were running down Tony's face uncontrollably, the last few minutes finally catching to him and crushing him under their weight. The only thing that Tony could think of that will keep his baby safe was the lake, the lake that never failed to protect him and Morgan no matter what; Tony's only thought was for Morgan to reach the lake before that ghost (Steven Grant Rogers) touches her…
Tony doesn't even know if he should cry, he really wanted to, crying he meant, but his eyes stayed as dry as desert as he gazed at the stick that seemed to mock him, laughing at his pain; Tony deserve it really, he should have listened to Steven and refuse for Rogers to touch him until he was sure that the man really loved him as who he was not for his body, but day after day Tony saw how Rogers was becoming distant from him, and he can admit he panicked a little, thinking that the love of his life will leave him any minute, so he did what he promised Steven and Peggy not to do and slept with the Rogers.
"Is that so?" Anton hummed, his eyes falling to Shield in deep thoughts wondering if any of James's words had truth to them or if it was nothing but an over-exaggerated story told to the babe. But thinking about it now, Nattalegg did tell him that she found the Shield hidden in a secret place in the treasure room… as if the person who put it there wanted it to stay hidden no matter what.
His lover, just saying this word made Steve's heart pound in his chest uncontrollably. It was over three months since the gala, three months after their night together, three monthw of the two of them decide that they will take the future one day at a time and enjoy being in each other's presence as lovers. Steve knew that this was foolish of him; to finally give in to the burning desire to be with Tony, his Anton, was only going to lead to pain and heartbreak. Pain and heartbreak that was not only from the thought of losing his lover but also from losing the little boy he started to consider as a son and the people he considered his friends and family. Unfortunately, Steve can't help himself, he can't stop himself from wanting Tony, and he decided that tasting what it meant to have a lover and family is way better than wishing and fantasying about them for the rest of eternity. The only thing that Steve hoped for was him being reborn as a mortal in his next life, a mortal who would have the chance to finally have the life he wanted with his Anton and their family.
loved fooling Alphas like Tony, I was doing what has to be done and stop our idiotic son from destroying his life." Howard hissed at her that only made the Omega bite the inside of her cheek and looked at the Alpha with pity and disgust, how could? How could he say this about the Omega without even knowing him!
Sam stayed quiet for a little time, glancing between Tony and his children who were running ahead and putting whatever they fancy in their basket; the look on Sam's face, made the smile slip from Tony's because the Omega already knows what the Beta wanted to say. "Mr. Stark, I… I really wanted to say how…" Sam opened his mouth and closes it a few times which made Tony swallow.
Or at least that's what Anton thought until James came sneaking into his workshop to see the Shield, even stayed outside of the shop all day, trying barging with Anton for a suitable price for the sheet of metal. Part of Anton wondered, what would the foolish queen offer him in exchange for returning the Shield to him? Steven's pup tried everything a pup his age thought of to get his hands on the Shield, even challenging Anton to a duel for it. What would the queen do or part with to get his hands on his Shield once more? Would he try barging with Anton? The queen has nothing other than his title and his status as a bringer than life; the queen has no sheep, no cows, no chickens, so he couldn't barter in exchange for the Shield. Not to forget that the queen has no silver or gold left in his name after Anton raided the Hydra castle, so he couldn't buy the Shield from him. Unless the queen made his people work several jobs at once to raise the money needed (Which Anton doubt Steven would, even if it meant losing the Shield) or use his status as Asgardian and connection with Loki and Thor (Which is also doubtful with how the prideful Steven was) the only way for Steven to get his Shield back is by stealing it (Again the Omega was too prideful and honorable to do something like this) or offer his body as a currency.
Dinner after that was a quiet affair; both Harley and Peter seemed to drain from crying to start any conversation, causing Tony to think of ways to cheer them up tomorrow. It was only when the boys went to sleep that Tony finally managed to relax a little and go to his room, wondering if Steve would manage to help him solve this problem.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, violence, and blood, deaths, and Steven being a scary motherfucker and we are going to meet the Winter Soldier! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"This is Yggdrasil." Steven said after he added the final touch to the drawing, smiling happily when his son missed up saying the Yggdrasil's name a few times, a pout taking over his face when he failed for the fifth time. "No love, it is called Yggdrasil, Y-gg-dra-sil." Steven said the word slowly, chuckling when his son grin happily when he was able to say the word. "Yggdrasil, the tree of life, its branches stretch out over all of the nine worlds." Steven said as he draws a small nine oval shapes waving themselves in the branches. "This is Niflheim, the world of mist." Steven said as he pointed on one of the ovals. "Muspelheim, land of lava. Asgard, home of the Gods and Goddess, their supreme ruler 'Odin' lives there. Midgard, our home the mortal realm. Jotunheim, the home of the giants. Vanaheim, the land of sorcery and magic, and Odin's wife and the queen Frigga is from that realm. Alfheim, the land of the light elves. Svartalfheim, the home of the dwarves. And Helheim, the land of the dead." Steven explains to his son, smiling when his child 'Oh' and 'Ah' as he gazes at the drawing with wide eyes.
Tony knew that he was desperate, but was he desperate enough to think that Steve has somehow saved his baby and raised him as his? Maybe, yes? Tony doesn't know, but he has to prove it to himself, he needed to prove it to himself… Steve wouldn't mind doing a parental test, would he? Just a small test to see if his baby was really alive and nothing more…
"Why don't you draw Mama, Peter? When he returns from work, you can show him what an amazing job you did!" Steve tried to say while pasting a happy smile on his face, feeling anything but happy at the moment. Still, he was trying to distract the small pup that has been sitting near the window for days now, waiting for Tony to show up, rotating from waiting near Tony's lab and going to sit in the living room to gaze outside at the gardens.
it was at that moment Tony fell in love with the name Morgan, it was then that Tony wanted to name his daughter with this beautiful name; Morgan was the German definition for Morning… his daughter, his baby was his morning, informing him of the start of a new day and a new life; a fitting name that Tony loved dearly only to discover the horrifying truth behind it.
Tony couldn't help but lean on the pillow behind him taking everything in, his mind going over what was happening and convincing himself that he was losing his marbles. "I am losing my mind… I am losing my mind and talking to a… a…" Tony couldn't even finish his words, feeling that if he finished this sentence then he was admitting that he was insane.
"They are fine, sweetheart, they are with Ma and Winnie." That got a sigh of relief from Tony as he thrust his face in his husband's neck, trying to calm his fried nerves further; Steve continued to whisper reassurance, complements, and '
"And what? Let Tony destroy his life by shackling himself to Rogers? Bucky is alive Steven and as soon as Rogers knows that he will not only break Tony's heart he will destroy him! Who was the fucker who gave Tony the idea of courting that… that…. Ah!" Peggy let out a frustrated scream, which made Steven sigh at that and tilts his head at the woman, with a frown.
Now I am sure everyone is probably wondering why Hammer wasn't punished as severely as his 'friends' were, to answer that: It's because he admitted to his crime in hurting Steve, in Norse society as long as the accused was open and honest about his crimes and killing and announced it straight away, then they would normally escape death and could be outlawed instead. However, being outlawed was a tough punishment and could sometimes be very dangerous even resulting in death. Outlaws had to completely remove themselves from their community and they couldn't receive any help or protection from members, they also could be lawfully killed by anyone at any time.
Steve's lips trembled as he tried to give Tony a reassuring smile; the smile though did nothing but break what's left of Tony's heart, because the smile was resigned one like Steve already knows that it was late saving him and that he was dying soon leaving Peter and Tony alone…
"I am so sorry…" Howard said but Tony already blocked what his father was trying to say, Tony shake his head at that not believing what his father was trying to tell him, refusing what his father was trying to tell him when Tony felt his father touch his shoulder gently, he lost it…
"There is nothing to forgive, I understand." Steve's words made Maria feel more like she was lower than dirt than she already did, this was her fault, this gently and forgiving Omega suffering because of her ignorance and Howard's nastiness, a few minutes were spent in silence with both of the Omegas trying to regain their thoughts and sipping their tea.
Tony wasn't really lying when he told Natasha that he has nowhere to go, he hadn't lied to her when he told her something had happened to Pepper and Rhodey; Tony didn't lie when he told Natasha to leave him and his property alone. All in all, after his talk with Natasha, Tony completely vanish from the village, only going there when he needed to buy something, or if he was in a dire need of human interaction; even then, Tony only spent time with a few known people, none of them were the Barnes-Carter family and his ex-friends.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, feelings, and fluffiest fluffy fluff! And Tony finally gets a day off, and Peter is precious! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Because Peggy and Angie already adopted you, I'm more of the uncle who was forced to babysit you." Steve said making another turn smiling a little when he heard Natasha giggle at that. "Aren't you supposed to be with Clint, right now?" Steve asked, making Natasha snort at that. If there was one thing that everyone agrees on, is that Natasha having a small (Huge) crush on Clint, the adrenalin-addict Omega… it was the only reason that she didn't kill him right away when he tried to flirt with her… like she nearly did to any other idiot who flirted with her.
The breakfast spent with pleasant conversation, smiles, and laughter, with Tony, spending that time rotating from taking a bite and feeding his baby, who giggles every time Steve takes it on himself to make airplane noises and feed the pup. Tony gazed at Steve when the Alpha did something making the pup squeal, and the Omega's eyes soften at that, looking at his pup then at the Alpha, flushing rosy color and a smile made its way toward his face…
Taking several deep breaths, Tony tried to calm himself down before he did something rash like firing his repulsors in Howard's face, that won't do. After managing to calm down a little, Tony managed to order his armor to disassemble, leaving him in one of his fancy suits as he entered the house, his eyes narrowing as he took the villa, his mouth twitching down when he saw the pictures of his father and mother hanging around, happiness surrounding them in every picture… what really made Tony's blood boil though, is that there was not even a single picture of him anywhere, even a small one, nothing, nada, yadda, null.
Tony didn't realize it, but by now he was sobbing while clutching the photos to his chest, he couldn't believe that all of his hope since last year, dashed just like this, all of the sleepless nights, all of the private investigators, all of the sites he hacked searching for his son, it all ends up with him being told that his son was dead, just like what his father said, but how can he trust Howard when the older man spent half of his life lying to him?
"I think… I think I made an unforgivable mistake…" Anton murmured, gazing at Jamti who was tilting his head to the side the look on his fellow Alpha's face informed Anton that Jamti is expecting Anton to tell him what he did. Anton could only wince at that, wondering what Jamti would do after he explained the situation to him; he didn't have to wait long, because, by the end of his explanation, Jamti's eyes were so wide that Anton wondered how they didn't jump out of his head.
"Young man… are you OK?" A gentle voice asked, causing Steve to look up to see the elderly man looking at him with a concern and worried look, probably wondering what to do with Steve. Steve probably looked like a crazy maniac running away from an asylum with his hospital pajamas and wheelchair he was using.
"I'm fine." Steve said as he turned his back to the Omega, hoping that the short man will take that as a sign and leave him alone, but unfortunately for him, the Omega took his dismissal as an invitation and came to stand beside him looking at Asgard with interest and thirst for knowledge, which made Steve's heart give a pang because Bucky used to look at new things like that.
It all started after Tony woke up the next day with both Peter and Harley sleeping in his arms, holding him tightly as their sleepy mumble reaching his ears; causing Tony to purr unconsciously and nuzzled his babies until they woke up and get ready to face the day. Ever since that day with the broken glass incident, Tony can proudly say that Harley was finally opening up to him like the Omega always wished he would, making Tony overjoy at the thought of the pup finally accepting him and feeling safe around him to joke and laugh and play without fear of something bad happening.
"Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!" Tony chanted under his breath and he looked around the place hoping to see the Alpha so he could give him his pup and then make a run for it, damn Pepper and her cookie duos! "Ok, when was the last time you saw your father, Peter? I am sure if we were fast we would-" Tony was cute by the sound of a throat being cleared behind him which made him flinch and for his heart to nearly stop when the pup squealed and run behind him… too late now.
"You look… happy." Bucky stated after he raised his eyes from the book he was reading to take Steve in, giving a smile as he saw Steve skip to the living room to look around. Steve was nearly vibrating in his place, the huge smile refusing to leave Steve's face as happiness continued to run through him. Steve was defiantly walking on cloud nine, the happiness the note Tony left for him in his car was still running inside him like mad.
"Petrus's room…" Steven muttered to himself before walking on shaky legs toward the small pup's room; ignoring the Alpha who followed him, too busy trying to reach his babe faster than his legs can take him. Reaching the boy's room, Steven opened the door and let out a choked sound when he found his baby sleeping beside Petrus, the content and sleepy scent of the children made Steven's muscle relax. After that everything happened fast, one second Steven took a step toward his babe, another second he was falling down, his vision going dark as he heard an alarming noise from behind him…
The next time Tony woke up he was in a cell… a ten by ten padded cell at that, with a bathroom attached. Tony sits up slowly and gazes around the place, he frowns as he saw he was on a mattress that was on the floor. He stood up slowly as to not let nausea take over and also him not wanting to be in the same place as whoever put him. He went to the bathroom first, hoping to find something of use there… nothing other than a hole in the ground that can be no wider than a fist. No water tap no nothing… other than the stream of water falling from above from a broken pipe, which made Tony pause and looks up, thinking that whoever did this, was either an idiot… or someone who knew what Tony was capable of if he was left alone…
Tony watched Steve come undone underneath him, back arching and eyes frail and wet again. Steve's loud moans fill the room. It seems to go on and on, and Tony seemed completely lost in it until his own release hit him suddenly and he lunged to bite Steve's neck hard, pounding into him like an animal and whimpering through his own orgasm in just as exposed manner as Steve. Steve's hands wrap around him and keep him close through it.
"Do you know where he is? Does someone, anyone knows where Steve is?" Bucky asked as he looked at Rhodey trying to get his emotions under control, he had to find Steve, his friend was out there alone, and with the aliens' attack things could get much worse, he hoped against hope that Steve wasn't in Manhattan when the attacked happened, he hoped that he wouldn't be dead after Bucky got to close to finding him.
The sound of the door being opened made Tony look up at Stane, he pressed his trembling lips together and swallows, he had to save his baby. "Please…" Tony plea making Stane snorts at him and put the tray of food on the ground and turned to leave… no, no, no! Tony longed at Stane clinging to him. "Please, please, please, help him!" He pulled Stane back making the man nearly lost his balance for a second.
Tony shuddered as Steve let out a pleasant noise and deepened the kiss, three weeks after the day Tony kissed Steve, the two of them start kissing like their lives depending on it, not a day past without the two of them sharing a hundred of kisses, and Tony was grateful, he was so grateful that Steve was accepting him back into his and Peter's life, even if it was slowly, the Alpha was grateful that he will have his family back one day…
Well, in this story Bucky and Steve were together, in fact, they were engaged, though they did not mate at that time but were planning on doing so once the war was over, unfortunately, Bucky fell from the train… in this story Bucky Barnes did die when he fell from the train, you will notice when you read the second chapter, that Peggy told Steve that Bucky's body was found three years after Steve went into the ice and was brought home and buried, Steve used to spent his time visiting Bucky's grave.
"Papa said that if I wanted to grow up like him I need to eat healthy food, he gives me a cookie after I finish lunch." The pup said with a nod which made Tony's smile widen at that without his conscience. The small pup is too cute! Tony thought with a happy smile as he washed his hands before starting with lunch.
"Do you need something,
In the end, Tony didn't have the courage to find Steve or talk to him, even when he spent his nights staring at the Omega's number that he made his AI find, but on the bright side, Tony stopped drinking, he stopped, and then start going to his therapist to get better now, not just to keep him mother concern at pay. He promised himself that as soon as he got better he will find Steve and talk with the Omega.
"I apologize…" A voice behind Tony made the inventor jump and turn around, brandishing the soldering iron like a weapon, which Tony lowered after seeing that the person who scared him was no one other than Rogers, which Tony knew that if he wanted he needed the Iron Man armor to even scare that man and not a small soldering iron that probably won't even damage the soldier, even when it was a dangerous instrument.
But was it justified what Tony did last night? Well, no, it wasn't; it was cruel of him to hurt Steve like that and snap in his face; after Tony returned to his workshop last night, his A.I. gave him the silent treatment, and when he had enough of Tony pleading with him, he informs Tony that he was too cruel and biased of him to treat Steve like that based on his Addams heritage when he has assassins and Gods, and villains going against him daily, some of them his friends even.
To say the last Steven was not pleased at all when he was dragged by the Iron King toward the ships like he was some type of cattle, but Steven had to hold his head high, he knows that everyone was depending on him; his son was depending on him! The poor babe was still shaking in his arms hiding his head in Steven's neck while giving small gasps of fear as he held into his whines afraid that someone will turn to them and hurt them if they heard him, and Gods, Steven can't fault his child for thinking like this, not with meeting his people like that.
"… I… I can h-hear him…" Whispered Steve looking around the place hoping that he would find a way to go down, down, down! "It's louder here…" Steve muttered pulling his hands from Peggy's weak grip from the shock… "Down… down… down…" muttered Steve like a crazy person as he starts searching around the room, throwing chairs and boxes away…
"Then what am I supposed to do Steve? Tell me what am I supposed to do when every time I pass this room I remember nothing but the pain that… that baby caused me! What am I supposed to do?" Tony begged the Alpha, hoping that Steve knows what to do, that the Alpha will give him directions, that Steve will tell him how to make this pain in his chest stop!
"Mommy!" Peter squealed happily as he runs toward his mother, making the Omega smile at that and pull the pup in his arms cooing to him gently which got a purr from the boy. "Mommy, Mommy! You won't believe it! Aunt May says she is going to have a baby! Can I play with it, please, please, please, please! I promise I will be really gentle!" Peter said as he jumped happily around the place, his words made Steve look at the Beta with a hopeful look, getting a shy smile and a nod in return.
"Mr. Stark!" Peter squeal as he rushed to hug Tony's legs, making the Omega laugh a little at that and lower himself to hug the pup, which got him a purr from the little one as he tried to snuggle into his neck, making the Omega coos at that, though the pup let go of him with a flushed face when Steve cleared his throat and looked at the pup with a pointed look.
That made everyone sigh in relief, and a happy sob left Maria who was shaking and looking at the ceiling. "J.A.R.V.I.S. do you know Steven Rogers?" Maria asked, and she hoped he knows after all the AI was made in 1999, when Tony was living with the Omega, right?
Tony was a few seconds short of screaming, he wanted to scream, and scream, and scream until his voice was gone. Tony frowns a little because he was sure that the screams he heard didn't come from inside his head, even if they were faint. Realization and panic took over him when he noticed more doctors and nurses running inside the operation room, and when the door opened he was sure that the screams he imagined hearing, were coming from this room, coming from Steve. Peggy and Bucky seemed to realize that too, as the two of them stood up with him; Peggy tried with all of her strength to stop both him and Bucky from rushing inside the room to investigate from where that screaming was coming from.
Pepper opened her mouth then she closed it thinking until she got the courage to ask what she wanted. "Rhodey… do you know anything about Steve Rogers?" She looked at Bucky when she said the name getting a nod from the Alpha when she said the right name; everyone could see how the colonel's face darkens when the name was mentioned.
"We killed Thanos in my world, and we will kill him here too, nothing changes." Steven said as he looked at Asgard from his balcony, mind drifting to what Loki had informed him a few hours earlier.
, about how they should do something that Steve was finally here, that he could finally help, that they should stop waiting like sitting ducks! Maria was the only one who could calm her before she said more hurtful things…
Tony waited a few minutes in hope that the boy's parents will come any moment now; five minutes turned ten and then turned into fifteen, and still, no one came to collect the small boy who looked even younger than Peter, based on his height. Letting out a sigh, Tony decided to deal with this matter, maybe call CPS if he couldn't connect the boy's parents.
That only made Loki hum and lean on the seat behind him, sending a fleeting glance toward Tony who was looking at the wall behind Steven's back, lost in thought about what he just heard not a few seconds ago, Steve, on the other hand, could do nothing but furrow his brows at his counterpart's words, feeling Peggy shake beside him as she gazed at Tony like she was going to lose the Omega any minute now, as for everyone they weren't better than Tony or Peggy, fear taking hold of them at the dark future they were promised…
"You got to teach me how to do that." Tony said as he looked at Steven who already had Doom, shackled with special cuffs that block magic, Steven on the other hands hummed at that a little and pushed a screaming and snarling Doom, toward Natasha who salutes to him and took the man with her, not before giving him a well-placed kick to the head that knocked him out as she start dragging him away with Clint.
Steve hates feeling tired; he hates the tiredness that consumes him every time the sun rises up in the sky, he hates it! A short time ago Steve was used to spending up to seventy years without a wink of sleep; he was used to playing in the sky and write history and enjoy his time without the tiredness that came to him when the sun dared to show him its face. It was so not fair, especially when the sun was nothing but a star like him!
There on the walls were hundreds upon hundreds of pictures and information; what made Steve freeze though were that they were his pictures. They were
"Rogers killed them because of that, didn't he?" Tony asked, already predicting what Rogers did but not having it in him to be angry at the life he took; the only thing Tony was angry about is Rogers not arriving in time and saving Peggy and Bucky's son.
"I can't handle it, Tony…" Steve finally whispered in Tony's neck where he laid his head, breathing wetly like he was trying to hold back his tears, which made Tony swallow and kiss the Omega's forehead. "He was so hopeful… it was the first time I saw his eyes sparkle like that… in pure joy… the last time that happened, it was on his sixth birthday when I showed him the only picture I have of you… he waited for you until it was dark, crying when you didn't show up, I can't handle his heart breaking like that again, not like that…" Steve sniffed as he clutches Tony's shirt tightly in his hands, not knowing if he wanted to pull the Alpha and break down crying, or push him away and curse him to death for destroying Steve's already fractured life.
The sound of a piercing scream made Steve jump from his bed and run outside of the room, Steve rushed toward the source of the sound which turned out to be Tony's room, that made Steve's heart nearly stop and he fastens his footsteps to reach the door faster, he nearly broke the door, but suddenly it was opened, and Steve's heart jump when he saw Peter standing on a stack of books clutching his bear in one hand and the other on the door handle, Steve gasped softly at the teary eyes that Peter was sporting, and he picked the small pup when he whimpered and pointed at his Mama who was thrashing in his bed choking on his screams.
God, I am so angry right now at something that my classmates did that I wanted to pound all of their heads to the ground!
Finally, after a long time of trying; Steve finally managed to open his eyes, it took him a few tries, but he finally managed to clear his vision of the dark spots that dominate it. When everything finally became clear, Steve looked around the room, gazing at the familiar/unfamiliar place he was in, it took him a few moments to realize what was going on and why this place was strange as hell; he can see colors!
By the way, I wrote another MCU horror story for this Halloween! 'The Soldier' go check it out!
No spooky things in this chapter!
"You will regret this…" Carter hissed, causing Tony to stiffen in his place, but the gentle hand Steve put on his back, relaxed him, letting out a tired sigh, Tony watched Peggy leave the house, stomping her way toward the taxi that was waiting for her no doubt…
"For the hair, a short straight formal style will do nicely, as for the beard, please shave it off, just looking at it make me cry." Steve joked, his words causing the woman to give a laugh and nod her head, Bucky on the other hand was pouting fiercely, but Steve took it as a win when the Bucky didn't flinch in fear when the Alpha start working on his hair.
After seeing nothing interesting the creature turned his attention back to the boy sleeping, he crawls toward him and pulled him away from the edge to get a good look at him, making sure not to sit near the sleeping boy least he dripped water on him and wake him up, something that the creature doesn't need. Just as the creature thought, the boy was young, too young; the boy was probably younger than what the creature was told. The creature though, didn't pay that too much attention, for something caught his sight, and that was the big belly of the boy; at first, the creature thought the boy was just overweight the first time he came around, but when the creature touched his belly a month ago he knew for a fact that the boy was carrying a child.
"I told you; new people aren't welcome in this lake, especially not those who disrespect it!" Tony shouted his words, it was the only way for someone to be able to hear him through the howling winds; Stane gave Tony's hair a painful tug, making him whimper in pain.
A month… a month they both spent in Italy and Tony wished that they will live there, in that wonderful place full of happy memories and wishes and legends and love. A month and Tony can see the same wish in his husband's eyes and promised himself that they will come back here one day, with Peter and their friends to see this wonderful place once more.
"B-but I swear I'm n-not lying, it happened!" Tony's voice cracked at the end, he tried to stop the scream of frustration from getting out. "If… if it wasn't true then why everyone is crowding outside, and what was written on the wall?" Tony asked, his voice take note of desperation in it, hoping that they will believe him.
"I… n-no! He has to have a child with him, he took an oath on King Odin and Queen Frigga; he has to have the child with him!" Steven plea with the king, he pleads with his eyes hoping that the king will tell him the Beta brought his child later with them, even sent him to Brookland for a short time before of its distraction, anything! Just let the child be with them. The king took Steven's fists that were fisting his shirt in gentle hands, so contradicting to his harsh appearance.
"Where is my pendant?" Steven asked as he turned to Margaret, the woman looked around the place, and when she saw that no one was watching, she raised her dress a little and unclasp the pendant from the hidden place near her right leg, where she put it, raising it to the queen, who smiled gently as he took the pendant, running his fingers over the branches of Yggdrasil, it broke his heart that he was forced to abandon his true origin, that he was forced to see everything related to his old life burn to ashes, he was grateful, so grateful, to Loki, the God of tricks, who gave him the ultimate trick and illusion to be able to hide this pendant, from the king's eyes for more than a decade… these days, Steven found himself praying to Loki and Frigga more than he ever prayed for the AllFather and Thor… he was almost convinced that any other God than those two do not exist.
"More of tried to force yourself on a sleeping person you brut!" The Omega hissed which made the Alpha snarl at that, the thought of the Omega accusing him of such a thing made the blood boil inside him, because how dare he! How dare that Omega implies that Starkad will force himself on an unwilling partner! Something he killed some of his men for doing!
"I…I… of course, Peter, if you want…" Tony whispered lost in his thoughts, his eyes becoming glassy as seconds passed, but Tony didn't cry, he just opened his arms and pulled Peter in his embrace, kissing his forehead and holding into him until he stopped shaking…
"And you trust me with Tony's heart because I was married to him for decades, did you forget that I'm not from this world in the first place?" Steven said as he looked at the woman with a hard look. "Tony is not a rebound, Peggy, and you should know that." Steven whispered harshly in Peggy's ear which made the woman smile at that.
So what do you think?
As Steve continued to suck the cock in his mouth, he felt Tony's hand in his hair; a signal that the Alpha was close. He slowly pulled off, taking time to swirl his tongue around the head before letting the cock slip from his lips. Tony reached down, pulling Steve up towards him to lazily kiss him. Steve knew this was a ploy to give Tony a break, for him to cool his down a little before they went any further, but Steve couldn't wait. He took Tony in hand and stroked a few times before lowering himself on the Alpha's cock. Both men let out a low moan as Steve continued to take more of Tony in until he was fully seated.
It took a whole hour for Tony to calm down, having passed out from crying too much, Steve, on the other hand, his nerves were nearly fried, but he forced himself to let go of the Omega and open the door, sighing to himself when he saw everyone waiting outside Tony's room in their pajamas. "Peter, come here little one it's time for bed." Steve said gently to the yawning pup which made the small pup stand up from his place which was Maria's lap and walk to Steve while raising his arms up hoping to be carried which Steve did as he carried the pup and kissed his forehead before putting the pup with his mother in their bed, leaving the room he nodded to everyone.
"Is that so…" Tony said slowly, his hand twitching like mad as he glared daggers at Howard, hoping the man would burn to ashes with the power of his glare alone. "Then do tell; were you ever going to tell me that you sold me to the Addams family just so you would survive and live here?" Tony asked in a low voice, trying to restrain himself from doing something stupid like throwing the vase in front of him at Howard and breaking his head.
?' as he gazed at Fury like the man sported seven new heads and start talking alien; because surely, Fury did not just tell him the fastest way to die and have his soul ripped from him.
"Sometimes… it is easier to just ignore everything, acting like nothing happened, like everything was going to be alright in the end… even if it meant lying to yourself for a few hours to achieve a little peace…" Steve whispered making Tony's eyes return to the ceiling as he took a deep breath trying to calm the storm inside of him. "Other times, going to the gym and hitting the punching bags or sparing with Natasha helped, but not always because when I lay in my bed at night I will never be able to sleep, even if I was tired as hell." Steve finished his words which made Tony nod his head in the darkness.
Anton leaped to the side as the bear lowered itself on all four and charged forward, causing Anton to curse when the bear seemed to avoid the hunters' swords, axes, and arrows. A squeak behind him, made Anton cursed as he slammed into Tyber, only to be pushed away by the weasel that ran to hide when he saw the bear getting closer to them, making Anton lose his footing and curse.
"Are you a fool?" Jamti snapped, his words causing Anton to wince and look away from his angry friend, Anton already knows that he was foolish and an idiot, no need to remind him of that. "Not only you shoved yourself in a matter that does not concern you, but you also insulted the queen who did nothing but try to show you goodwill! Why?" Jamti huffed, his hands running through his head before returning to glare at Anton, his eyes promising him a painful hunting trip and a visit from Magna later. "Why did you say such a thing?! You are not the queen's guardian, nor are you
Clint heard a voice saying this word, he turned to the side only to choke on his scream as he saw Natasha holding her head with the same horror expression on her face that he was sure was mirrored by his, Nat moved his head toward Clint and a sudden smirk took over her hideous face.
"Harley? What's wrong?" Peter's voice filtered in his hazy mind, causing Harley to blink his eyes and turn to the side, seeing Peter standing beside him with worried eyes, no doubt wondering what happened that Harley's asthma acted up.
And for everyone who didn't know, I posted a new spooky story 'The Soldier' to answer the spooky Halloween challenge I got, go check it out if you are interested!
"And then what?" Tony asked, turning a little toward Natasha wanting her to talk, wondering if it was possible for the woman to turn even paler than she already was; Natasha shook her head not a few seconds later, causing Tony to sigh in relief when the woman resumes her story.
Tony gazed around the gala, putting a smile on his face as he talked with whatever-her-name-was, trying not to grimace when the woman gave a loud laugh as she touched his arm, fluttering her lash as she looked at him with an expecting look, it was embarrassing, especially when he was already with a date, a date that hasn't yet arrived but still.
After his brief period of depression, Tony finally gathered himself enough, determent that he would do right by Harley and get to know the boy better. And finally, after starting the adopting process, Tony got his chance to bond a little by little with Harley, thanks to the weekly visits. At first, Tony felt how uncomfortable Harley was, and he beat himself for not noticing before, but as days turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months, Tony can safely say that Harley was finally feeling comfortable around him to relax and even joke around sometimes if the little boy was in the mood.
Even if his belly starts getting bigger and bigger and his fear took a hold of his heart, even when Stane will pause when he gazes at his stomach and ends up snorting leaving Tony to his thought, even if he saw no one come into his cell for months and everyone forgets about him, even if he was only remembered by those who bring the food twice a day…
"And your dad?" Tony asked as he leans down a little to be in the same height as the kid, that question made the boy smile a little and puff his small chest.
The next time Tony woke up, he felt tired and drained, he felt like the world was against him, like any minute now he was going to fall apart and there will be no one to catch him, he was tired, he was so, so tired, always getting his hopes up only for them to be dashed when they are not even fully developed. Today when Tony woke up with Steve holding him tightly in his arms, hiding him away from the cruel world, Tony made an oath to himself, a promise that he will forget all about the child that destroyed his life, an oath that no matter how much everyone told him about his child that died, Tony wouldn't care about what he heard, he wouldn't get his hopes up, he will completely forget about that wretched parasite that destroyed his already fragile life.
That's why you will find Rhodey and Tony arguing back and forth about where they should put Jarvis. Rhodey was more into putting it into the attic (Implying that if Tony wanted a lab it should be up there) while Tony insists on putting Jarvis in his room or the room downstairs (Which made Pepper get involve and start scolding Tony about where was he going to sleep or where will his guests sleep). All in all, it was agreed by his friends (Minus Tony) that his workshop and Jarvis was going to be in the attic until further notice (And no, Tony wasn't pouting at the thought that Morgan's playroom was turned into his shop, nope)
"Sorry, kiddo, Harley is right this time," Tony said, his smile widens when he saw his son pout harshly, looking at Harley with pleading eyes as he hoped that the older boy would have mercy on him because it was Peter's birthday today.
What throws her off was also him knowing about Tony, he talked about her nephew with such softness, Peggy was sure his eyes were sparkling at the mention of him, it made Peggy narrow her eyes and took her phone. "Fury, bring the Avengers to the HQ," Peggy ordered in a commanding voice as soon as the phone was picked up after the first ring, she didn't even wait to hear the other Alpha's confirmation; she just clicked the phone shut and turned her gaze toward the sleeping man on the bed.
The only thing that Steve remembered was him waving goodbye to May who was going to the hospital, he remembered Peter in his embrace, and him humming happily to the child as the two went into the house, the next thing, Steve remembers is something hard-hitting him on the face, that he lost his balance, and maybe he lost his consciousness too because the next time Steve opened his eyes he was on the floor of his room, his hands bound behind his back, his baby was whimpering as he tried to wake him up, letting out sobs now and then.
"Is Tony OK now?" Peter asked in a small voice which made Steve give a tired sigh at that and hold his son tightly as he rocked him gently.
"Steve…" Tony whispered happily, letting go of Thor and start wobbling toward him; Thor though, was looking at Steve with a knowing look. A look full disbelieve, hurt, and denial before he turned his eyes to the ground, giving Steve and Tony privacy they need. "Steve, sweetheart, let's go home, please, everyone is waiting for us… please…" Tony pleaded, taking step after step toward Steve.
"Oh… it took me weeks to catch…" Rogers said with a sad voice, and Tony could only shake as he saw that… that thing! start yowling as it hissed at the crows making the birds give a mighty caw before flying away from the trees.
Though on the bright side of things, the Omega stopped fighting him every step of the way now that he knew that Starkad kept his promise, which meant no more headaches for the Alpha… unless some idiot decided to act up and start a screaming match with the blond Omega, then all of the Omega's little followers will jump the one who screamed at the Omega, which then it will turn into a brawl that the Alpha has to stop, he spent his days screaming, which was not helping that much, not when some unpleasant company will come to the village in a fortnight.
Tony wanted to say so many words to lessen the heartache, but not even one word left his mouth, getting trapped between his lips as soon as he opened them, so Tony did the only thing he can do, he just smiled at the Alpha and tipped toe so he can kiss his cheek. "A rough day at work…" Tony breathed out which made Steve frown but nodded his head, turning around to kiss Tony's forehead before returning to prepare the dinner.
Reaching the garage Tony rushed toward his car, not fancy ones like his parents, but a car dear to him considering that Tony had to work two summers to gather enough money to buy it, a car that will make a perfect way for running away from this place, considering that no one knows about it. Gasping, Tony, revived the car and drove as fast as he can without attracting the attention of the people and police, all the same, gasping and wiping his tears away trying to focus on the road in front of him, putting as much distance between him and the nightmare behind him.
"What about you?" Harley's voice cracked as he whispered these words, the three of them flinching when they heard something breaking down the hallway, causing Tony's heart to drop as he rushed to pull Peter and Harley toward the window.
The faceplate opened and Tony thrust his face in Steve’s neck, and the Omega didn’t have the heart to be annoyed at his Alpha, even with all those annoying photographers and reporters taking pictures and screaming questions. Steve held into Tony tightly, letting the Alpha nuzzle his neck, Tony repeating his name over and over, tightening his grip that it took a few complaining huffs from Steve for the Alpha to realize he was hurting him. When Tony raised his eyes, Steve choked whatever noise he wanted to let out, for his mate’s eyes were completely gold, which only meant one thing; his mate was a step away from becoming feral. “Your eyes…” Steve whispered, his hands itching to touch Tony, his right-hand raising and touching Tony’s cheek gently with the tips of his fingers, fearing that he will sit his mate off.
"Right… hey, is there a loony bin around here? I am sure those nice people you ran away from are worried about you, what do you think, star and strips?" The creature asked, and Steven out to ask it about its name, after all, he can't call it creature, it was really tiring to do that, and it gets bored after a while, even if Steven called him a crazy bitch every time the two of them talked, the word 'Bitch' seemed to egg that thing on even more, so maybe he was a female that has a male body? Odin's beard, this was hopeless…
Thor on the other hand instead of smiling and patting Peter's head and accepting the story as a childish dream like how Tony's family and friends did, he did the opposite; Thor was frowning, there was a thoughtful look on his face, which caused everyone who was sitting in the living room (All the Avengers minus Bucky and Steven who were training in hand to hand this time) to tilt their heads in confusion. "It seems that the youngling is truthful in his words, you have a great fortune of good luck brother Stark… it seems that you are blessed!" Thor called out with a smile on his face, which made Tony give a dumb 'Huh?' and gaze at Thor with a raised eyebrow, silently ordering him to continue.
"Whose room is this?" Harley asked one day when Tony entered the room that was once forbidden, his question, gaining a smile from Tony who started tidying the room a little, opening the closet and smiling when he saw the boxes of clothes and toy's he kept locked in the closet for years and years on end… Tony thinks it was finally the time for them to be put to use.
"Who are you?" The king repeated his question but in the Hydra's language, looking at the king who pales then at Steven up and down. "A servant?" He gazed at Steven's clothes with an amused look on his face. "Your fancy clothes say otherwise…" The Alpha then starts circling Steven, though the Omega didn't move he just looked forward trying to stop the fear from taking a hold of his heart. "The Queen?" He asked in a mocking polite tone, but then Steven had to hold his gasp of pain as his hair was pulled back harshly to show his neck, Steven had to bite the inside of his cheek when the Alpha lean to inspect his neck with a hum. "Interesting, no
Steve pause at that wondering to himself why would Tony do something like this? But then he remembered, that Tony was just a teen, and like every other teen at his age, they all had some hero worship for Captain America, so Steve can see why Tony did that… it made Steve's mood fall. "What kind of program are you? What's your name?" Steve asked hoping to get more insight on Tony by talking to one of his creations; Steve looked at the claw machine, then return to the screen.
Steven blinked his eyes, taking in the king who was looking like he prefers to be anywhere but here; a sentiment that was shared with Steven for the Omega doesn't even want to see the king's face, not right now, not when he was a minute away from attacking the man, who was the reason he lost another babe he promised to protect. "What are you doing here, foolish king?" Steven asked in a tired voice, which made the Alpha shuffle uncomfortable in his place.
"You look sad…" The pup murmured as he stood up and starts dusting his clothes from the dust and dirt. "Why?" The pup looked at him after he finished tidying his clothes.
The second knock was harder than the first, making Tony grumble, wondering what Angie brought with her that she started to knock on his door like crazy. "Just a second!" Tony called out letting out a tired sigh as he opened the door; the person waiting on the outside made Tony freeze, his breath locking itself in his lung as the horror of what he saw finally clicked in.
Tony never changed so fast in his life, he rushed out of his room and toward the stairs, but he paused a little and rushed toward the nursery to get something when everything was set, he rushed out of his house with a huge smile over his face.
The man said with a dark look as he spat on Johann which made the other king pale as the waiting warriors howled in agreement, raising their weapons in pure glee as the huddle of terrified subjects and royals to scream in horror and fear. The Vikings hounded closer, and Steven watched in panic as they surrounded them with raised weapons with malicious smirks… oh, Gods, they are going to kill his baby!
Tony didn't know how long he walked, but he knew it was far away, if Tony even bothered to look around the place or even cared about where he was he would have noticed that he walked far away that he was in Manhattan, Central Park to be exact, but Tony didn't care as he continued to walk, away from parents and their children, away from the laughter and shouts he was hearing, away from the sound of his phone that was ringing constantly, away from his raging thoughts, away from the memory of him waking up six months after his child's birth feeling like someone ripped his heart, just away from everything in general.
Becky seemed to blink and a tired but happy smile graced her lips, though the pain and uncertainly in her eyes as she gave her baby and Steve a fleeting glance, probably wondering how Steve was going to react with his baby being gone and all that. "Stephen… we named him Stephen; do you wanna hold him?" Becky asked gently, tilting his arms a little to show Steve the boy who was looking at everything and anything with curious blue-grey eyes.
"He will hurt you…" Bucky whispered before taking a step toward Steve, his words causing Steve to frown and look away from Bucky. "He will hurt you again, and again, and again, that's all Tony is good for, that's the
Tony could only let out a wordless sob and staggers forward, wrapping his arms around Rogers's shoulders, letting out a shuddered breath as he buried his face in Steve's neck. "Thank you… thank you, thank you, thank you…" Tony's words cracked, his tears falling down his face as today's events finally caught up to him, leaving him helpless.
"You are sweet, traveler." Loki said, his smile leaving his face as he looked at Steven with a harsh look. "This is not a place for being sweet, or you will end up dead." Loki warned Steven harshly, which made the older man gazed at him with a mischievous look; a silent conversation went between the two of them before Loki lean back with pursed lips. "You know, there is a story that the dead love to recites, every century without fail…" Loki started as he gazed outside of the window with a thoughtful look on his face. "It goes back to the start of this universe when souls roamed the lands, and planets haven't collided together yet when there was only one rule and one law to follow and that was the forbiddance of touching another soul. It talked about a soul brighter than the others, the brighter the soul was, the more significant it has in the living world and its history. With his brightness, he was able to capture the attention of others, charmed them with their personality, but the soul already was in love with another… too bad for the soul, he caught his eyes." Loki said offhandedly, which made everyone look at Loki like he lost his mind.
Steven's eyes never left the library's door that Tony went through, the only time his eyes turned away from them was so that he could gaze at Peggy who was cursing and screaming, trying to let out her frustration, and Steven can say that he was feeling the same thing, after all, he knows Tony, and he knows that if Tony got something in his mind he will go through with it no matter what the consequences were, which was as much as it made Steven want to rip his hair out he admired Tony for standing in what he believes in, though in this case, Steven can't say the same thing, especially when he was told that Tony was nothing but twenty, still a child by even Steven's standard.
Yay! A Stony sweet moment!
The first to clock it out were Peggy and Bucky, something about needing their beauty sleep; not that Tony will dare to stop them, a sleep-deprived Peggy and Bucky are dangerous! Half an hour later they were followed by Natasha and Bruce, the poor scientist had fallen asleep on the floor and ended with Natasha having to lead him to his room for the much-needed rest.
Of all the scary things Steve thought of while he was trying to save Peter's life, he never thought he would be the target of the laughing joke of the stars, the one who caused too many problems for the history writers by crashing their territories and mess with thousand years of history. "Move it, sweetheart, or I would shoot! Don't think I won't!" The raccoon growled at Steve, and the only thing Steve could do was twitching his eyebrow before frowning hard.
He was in the middle of the lake, or what he thinks is the middle of the lake; not that Tony cared or anything, this was his first time on a boat, so he thinks it was fair if he made a mistake or two. "Oh, they are swimming away…" Tony muttered, almost absent-minded when he saw the oars drifting away from the boat, which made him realize that he let go of them when he shouldn't. In the back of his mind, a part of him wondered, how would he return back to the shore? Tony wasn't a good swimmer, and he was sure as hell couldn't swim without getting tired thanks to the baby bump, so how will he return?
As much as Tony wanted to play it off and tell Pepper that it was her imagination (The camera feed didn't show them anything, just Pepper tripping and falling down) Tony knew that this was unfair to his friends, especially when the two of them just wanted to help him; besides, it wasn't like Tony couldn't run toward the lake, so far, the monster living deep down tolerated him and his girl, he was sure that it would take care of the ghost… unless it was the monster and it was planning on kicking him out of the house.
"Hopefully you will know by the end of the week." Tony ended up saying, getting a proud look from Angie, as the woman took their order and promised to bring it to them shortly, even owning the place, Angie still loves to go around and take orders, Tony though, knows that the only reason Angie does that is for the gossips, for the woman knows everything that is happening in the town.
"You are not working while being pregnant, you hear me, Carbonell, if I hear as much as you holding a grocery bag I will kill you, you are going to accept help when someone offers it!" Natasha threat which made the teen pout even if he felt a little scared by her threat, him and Natasha got close in the past three months, she was like the older sister he never had.
Reaching Peter's room, Steve took a deep breath as he prepared to go inside the room; he took a deep breath and pasted a smile on his face hoping that no one will know how broken and hurt he was inside. "I'm sorry…" Steve heard when he tried to open the door, and for a second he thought that it was him who said these words aloud, these words that have been running inside of his mind for years.
But Tony knew that Steve was busy the Alpha after all was the vice-commander of Shield and he had a lot of work lining on him, but the Alpha always, almost all the time, found the time for Tony and Peter even if he was busy, something that the Omega was always grateful for.
The third time Anton was reincarnated… he was a woman… and he saw her Renaissance period, it was beautiful and sad at the same time. Her name was Antonette, she was beautiful, Gods how beautiful she was, so full of life and hope, she used to look at the sky just like how Anton used to and she will smile when she saw him shine like she knew he was watching over her, the day she called him her 'Lucky star' he nearly cried, because he can see traces of Anton in her.
"I am not pouting." Tony huffed as he once more took in the guests, trying to find a mop of blond hair, a blue-eyed man that was glowing in the dark, so far he didn't find him. OK, maybe he was pouting a little but it wasn't his fault, it was Aunt Peggy, and Bucky's fault for insisting on driving Steve and not letting Tony drive his date.
A tired sigh followed by the drag of one of the dining room chairs, when Tony finally raised his head he saw Angie sitting beside him, gazing at him and Morgan with a soft and sad look. "I told them this was a bad idea… hiding the truth I mean," Angie stated, smiling when Morgan turned to her and begin waving her arms around. "No one is going to hurt you, Tony, I know you that you probably won't believe us, and maybe even refuse to because of the secrets we kept, but be assured that no one would hurt you," Angie whispered softly, her words causing Tony's lips to tremble and for his eyes to return back to his daughter.
(See the end of the chapter for
A few months later, Steven finally woke up, to find the Avengers in his recovery room sleeping on any surface available. He ended up nearly choked to death with how tight he was hugged by Tony and everyone else. A few months passed and the first anniversary of Tony and Steven arrived; to Steven's shocked, it was Tony who proposed to him, using the same rings that Steven gave to his husband in his universe.
"Don't do that!" Tony shrieked when he regains his normal breathing and heart rate, looking at Steven who was awake and gazing at him with amusement clouding his eyes. "God, you are even worse than that asshole, didn't Aunt Peggy teach you not to scare poor Omegas? We have a delicate hearts!" Tony grumbled as he took his seat back, glaring at Steven darkly hoping that he understood the meaning of his words.
"Steve…" Tony's broken voice made Steve raise his head and look at the Alpha who was watching him with a broken look on his face; whatever Steve hoped to feel wasn't there, he felt nothing but the emptiness that threatens to consume him, leaving him more broken and hollow than he already was. Steve just shook his head, pushing Tony away from him when the Alpha came to hold him; Steve can only walk away as he tried to stop himself from breaking down.
"He caught Thanos's eyes, didn't he?" Steven murmured which made Loki give him an amusing look, the mention of Thanos made the Asgardian inhale at that.
Wait for the next chapter; it will be as spooky as I can make it.
"You saved me…" Loki had said slowly after he was put down on the ground of one of the near inhabitant planets that Steven could find. "Why?" Loki asked after he straightened himself which made Steven look at him with a mocking smile enjoying the anger and self-conscious that flashed on the man's face.
Steve took the position of the vice-commander of Shield, Maria had long since retired after getting pregnant thirty years ago, she and Coulson live in a country house now, where Coulson could finally try his skill at fishing and where Maria could finally play her cello in peace.
…" She responded and then smirked, finally switching to a heavy accented English, "Disrespect him again, and say goodbye to your head,
Tony waited until she left to let out a growl, why can't they just forget about it? All Tony wants was to continue on with his life without being reminded every second that he was held captive, why can't they just never mention it? Why do they always remind him about it? Was it too much to ask of them to pretend that it never happened? The door opened making Tony look to see Steve walking inside the room with a wheelchair, the smile on the Alpha's face dropped as he saw the scowl that Tony was sporting before he could open his mouth the Omega snapped making Steve take a step back. "I am not crazy!" Tony hissed at the Alpha hoping to show him how displeased he felt right now.
"Enough, Tony… that's enough." Steve raised his eyes when he heard those words, turning to the source to see Bucky giving his husband a harsh look; Steve wouldn't lie, the face Bucky was sporting was scary, the blank mask on his face mixed with the cold as winter eyes made a shiver run down his spine, and maybe it did something to Tony, because the Alpha turned his glaring eyes from Steve to Bucky.
"That's because Dad, is too much of a scary cat to let me return home, as soon as Clint called him, he and Ma panicked and held me hostage in here," Tony murmured, his words gaining a laugh from Steve who shook his head at how childish Tony was; that didn't stop Steve from being grateful to Howard and his mother, at least the two of them knew how to rein Tony before he did something reckless.
"Pepper!" Tony whine as he flies through the window that was thankfully opened, which scatter papers all around the place, though, the strawberry blond-haired woman didn't even look phased, as she continued to sign the rest of the papers, which as much as it made Tony admire her, this was not the time for that, this was his time for trying to convince her that he really has a serious problem.
Hearing the word 'Addams' made everyone freeze in place, and Tony's eyes widened at that if that was even possible. "Wait! Addams? You meant like those creepy people who live in creepy mansions near the graves and are more of scary demons than actual people?" Clint asked, and if Tony could move, he would have clapped his hands for Clint because that was exactly what he thought about… but Rogers doesn't even look like an Addams! He didn't have the dark hair or the olive skin the Addams are known to possess, so what the hell?
It started as a normal morning at the beach… or whatever kind of normal Tony and Steve can have. While Tony was sunning himself, and watching his husband in the water, Steve was having the time of his life by surfing and then jumping in the ocean, no doubt scaring a shark or two away if that insane grin was anything to go by.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, feelings, a little bit of violence, angst, a little bit of fluff, a lot of crying, threats of self-harm, and we got to meet Stane, so everyone prepares! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated. Beta by the amazing 'Angstony (tony)' on Discord! Come join us on 'Put on the suit (18+) Discord!
Steven blinks at the team like they were idiots before sighing to himself and start massaging his forehead for the upcoming migraine. "Do I need to remind you that I was once upon a time in the military? We cuss in the twentieth century and sure as hell we cuss in the twenty-one century, why are you acting all surprised?" Steven shook his head at that and starts grumbling under his breath then turn to Steve. "Look, son, for the last time the only thing I will tell you about Hydra is what I deem you ready to hear, I don't care what you will try to do to gain information but if I hear about you going around the place spreading the word about what you hear I will kick you so hard that I will return you to the twenty century, and believe me when I say I already kicked your skinny ass when I traveled in time last time." Steven hissed which caused Steve to flinch a little at the murderous look in his counterpart face, it was true that Steven doesn't have scent glands to emit pheromones to scare people off, but that look was enough to make all the Avengers flinch and look away from the older man… he was scary.
…" That's what Tony choked as he held Steve tightly, his breath shaking and his arms tightened around Steve when the Omega broke down once more and start sobbing, holding into Tony's suit jacket, babbling words that made no sense to anyone but himself, Steve's hand was still caressing his belly, the fear of losing his baby was getting irrational as what happened two hours ago kept replaying in his mind eye again and again.
"She made me promise to give it to you when the time is right; this is the best time as any." Howard smile, taking the necklace from the box and going behind Tony; Tony could only look in the mirror, his breath hitching as his father fasten the necklace behind him.
Did you know?
"Oh my God, a girl; I'm having a girl, Buck! A baby girl!" Steve breathed out as the two of them left the appointment, Steve was holding back his embarrassing squeals of delight at the thought of him having a baby girl to spoil and hold in his arms without letting her go. Just the thought of him holding her and granting her every wish was enough to make butterflies flutter inside his stomach.
"Yeah, that's me, in the flesh!" Tony said with a cheer and he really wanted to thank his mother for forcing him to take acting classes, because if it wasn't for them Tony would have caused a scene by now. His response made Steve smile and look at the small pup that was playing with his toy.
"I am sorry, I am so sorry; I didn't know this was going to happen, I am so sorry, Bucky…"
Unfortunately, what Tony got wasn't peace and quiet and a little nap as he hoped; what Tony got was a mad pounding on his workshop's door not half an hour ago, followed by the sound of an enrage Bucky as he spits a threat after threat, promising Tony a painful death if he didn't back out of his date with Steve. God, Tony never hated Bucky and his 'Steve's sense' as he does now because that sixth sense meant that Tony has to be prepared, for his lifespan that had shortened fifty years just now, not that his life span can go past forty with the kind of life he has.
Arriving late for the get-together is didn't happen because of his job at SI taking a long time… well, it did take a long time, but the reason he was late was that he was busy trying to bake some pies, and thankfully they taste good, their look? Not so much he was an engineer, not a chef, though Pepper helped him with the decoration, the other reason why he was late… well, it was more of him running away from Winnie, to be honest ever since Tony's eyes fell on Bucky Barnes the older Alpha had been trying to set him up with her son, it's not that her son wasn't handsome! He just wasn't Tony's type!
The rest of the day was… unexpected or expected in Tony's case. Just as Tony predict, his little visit to the library didn't go unnoticed, because as soon as he left the library with the books he borrowed he was met with the sight of Clint waiting for him outside. Tony couldn't help but smile against himself, feeling sadness even as he greeted Clint with a happy smile as the two of them talked about their day. Clint always insists on taking him to Angie's diner, something about Tony finally leaving the house and returning to visit the town once again.
"Of course we can Bucky! You know I want to introduce you to my friends, I'm sure they will be happy to meet you, especially Nat." Steve said enthusiastically, sending Bucky a happy smile, and he was rewarded by getting a nod and a flush that took over Bucky's cheek causing them to turn pink.
Everything was good, Steven was flying alone in the space brooding in peace like what he had been doing for nearly two thousand years and a half ever since he met Anton, and he was not ashamed of admitting that he was brooding, after all, he was known for being the broodiest star out there, 'Salty' Sarah always says. It was maybe two years in his travel that he turned his head when he saw something fly toward him at lightning speed shining ominously, Steven's eyes widen at that as he tried to avoid whatever this was, only for it to track him down no matter where he went, he shouted in pain and surprise as whatever the hell that was slammed into his chest, he shrieked as something wrapped around his neck and was pulling him down, and like a weight being placed on him he was falling, the last thing he remembered was slamming into something when he fell, causing both of them to crash into the ground…
"Why don't you look at that? I never thought that respectable beaches like this still have trash floating around them." Tony said back, ignoring the sputter the woman let out at the straightforward insult, letting out a yawn Tony stretched before he signed to Steve to stop his heavenly massage. "Come on, Steve, I am hungry, let's go eat something, and it better not be the shark from before." Tony hummed, standing up from the chair with Steve by his side, ignoring how Sunset was snapping and screaming insults at him as they left.
No matter how much Tony wanted to rush toward his Omega and child, Aunt Peggy refused for him to leave, mainly because they needed to treat his wounds because he was the one who took the hits the most trying to stop the fight in record time… so Tony ended up sitting on the chair with his head in his hands, wondering why God loved to torment him so much, why today of all days? Why today when Steve finally decided to give him a chance with their son? Why when he was going to spend the day with his son for the first time? Just why?
"The pup is going to be fine, he is Tony's son, and if I know Tony, and I like to think I do, the pup wouldn't leave this world without putting the biggest fight you will witness," Jarvis said softly putting his hand on Steve's shoulder, making the Alpha looks up at the old man and give a tired smile.
"The AllFather is waiting for you." Heimdall said as he broke eye contact and start walking toward the palace with faster steps this time, which made Steven raise his eyebrow and follow the man, keeping an eye on his friends hoping they wouldn't rush toward anything in hope of exploring (Tony) or cause some trouble while they were walking around the place (Clint) or acting like a bullheaded idiot (Steve) thankfully Peggy, Natasha, and Bruce seemed to handle the rest of the Avengers and steering them away from everyone last they caused problems. "We have arrived." Heimdall said as they stopped in front of a huge palace, which made everyone's jaw fall, except for Steven, the older man saw such wonders in the New Asgard, even more, beautiful than here.
"Oh, fuck it!" Tony growl as he gets out of the bed, giving Steve a nasty look, which was received with heart eyes from Steve. "OK, fine, one date! You fuck it up, your chance is over, got it?" Tony hissed at Steve, getting a happy squeal from the man in return, which was scarier than any horror Tony ever faced. In front of him, the Winter Soldier, the scariest assassin in the world, the man with the metal arm, the original Captain America, and a part of the Addams family; was squealing like a high school girl after Tony said yes to the idea of one date… scary… "Yeah, yeah, enjoy your five minutes of fame, until you fuck it up that is… by the way Addams; your crazy cousin Wednesday or something says Hi; when you see her tell her to fuck off! I don't need another Addams sniffing around me I already got my hands full with you." Tony snapped as he went to the door, ignoring Steve who was sighing happily like he was finally able to reach the stars.
Hamar: I don't think that needs an explanation because it's Justin Hammer.
(See the end of the chapter for
The AI said before he played an old video within it, Steve was grumbling as he was tending the black eye Tony was sporting while the Alpha pouted, and Tony clearly remember that fight, because he remembered that an asshole tried to grope Steve and make inappropriate comments about the Omega which made Tony attack the Alpha, nearly getting his ass kicked if it wasn't for Steve who kicked the other Alpha away from Tony. In the video, Tony went to shower after he was kicked by Steve who was still angry at the Alpha.
I want to thank all of my readers for sticking up with me, hope you enjoyed the story!
"No, it doesn't work like that, but it will be the first step to recovery, the rest… well, it depends on you, and how strong your will is, it is another step for Peter too, it will teach him how to be strong, the pup needs you, Tony, he needs you to show him that he can be strong…" Steve said which made the Omega sighed at that and look at his pup who was purring loudly now that he sniffed his father's scent.
As the process came to an end, both Steve and Tony get more anxious as the days passed, wondering what Harley would think about his new home, wondering if he liked the room they prepared for him, wondering if the little boy would hate them or not feel that comfortable with them or their friends, or how their friends would react when they bring Harley home (Everyone was shocked at first, they argued and raised hell, until they realized that both Steve and Tony won't be swayed and were going through the adoption). Thankfully, the two of them managed to calm each other down before they fall down the rabbit hole with how much their thought became jumbled.
"My baby…" Maria sobbed as she reached Tony, holding him tightly but gently, Tony, on the other hand, hide his face in his mother's neck taking in her sugary sweet scent, sobs start raking his body as he took hold of his mother, refusing to let her go.
Tony couldn't help the satisfied smirk on his face as he saw the looks of awe and amazement on everyone's faces as they watched Steve like he was like the God of the sea who decided to grace the mortal world with his presence, if only they knew that his husband was the true impersonate of the God of the underworld and the king of the darkness all in one… poor humans got deceived by a handsome face as his husband.
Steve swallowed a little closing his golden eyes, when he opened his eyes a few seconds later they were once again blue. "You are supposed to be smart Howard… even when I made a deal; it doesn't mean I will do it right away, would I?" Steve gave a dark smile at that, it sent a shiver down Howard's spine. "I got what I want from him… he, on the other hand, the papers he signed get lost…" Steve hummed ripping the file in his hands to pieces. The sound of phone ringing made Steve pause and thrust the ripped file toward Howard's chest, and took the phone from his pocket. "…Jarvis? Oh, I am coming…. Thank you." Steve hummed as he ends the call and went outside leaving Howard staring at Steve's back.
was dragging itself outside of the lake… Steven Rogers… Tony's mind whispered faintly, trying to explain the mass of pale flesh dragging itself to dry land. This was… this was the first time that Tony saw the creature living in the lake, ever since Stane, the creature disappeared from sight, and even then, Tony never really managed to catch a glimpse of Rogers the first few months Tony lived here.
James asked, breath hitching as he saw the woman giving him a small smile and a nod, which made the young boy sniff and nod his head returning to his hidden place that was his mother's neck shivering now and then, relaxing when his mother starts running his hand through his hair and pounced him a little.
Though before he can even apologize, Steve put his hand on Tony's cheek before giving him a soft peck on the lips, before pulling back, and Tony doesn't even know why this small kiss left him flushed and wanting, but the gentle smile on Steve's lips was worth it, it took his breath away. "Come one, I will prepare the guest room for you; God knows what type of accident you will get in if I let you leave when you are tired." Steve said as he walked toward the guest room, and Tony tried to hide his laugh behind his hand, already knowing that Steve was too embarrassed to want to talk about what happened not a few seconds ago and this was his way of deflecting… though warmth made Tony's body tingle as he followed Steve, a happy smile making itself known on his face and refusing him… maybe they can go through this… together…
Steve leaned down, taking Tony's mouth in another heated kiss. He tried his best to multitask, unbuttoning the silky shirt his husband was wearing as best he could try not to spend too much time trailing his hands over every bit of newly exposed flesh of his husband's chest along the way. Once the shirt was opened, Steve got to work on Tony's pants only to have the man push his hands away.
