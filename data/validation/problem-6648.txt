Tugging his thick coat tighter around him against the pervasive chill, he stood and explored the room he’d been sequestered too. The storage units were filled with sealed packets of varying densities and labelled with some kind of weird jargon that Anthony could not begin to comprehend. Some of the unit were locked with some sort of simple mechanism. He was sure that given time, he could crack on open.
They part on good terms, Tony promising to call if the information helped the case in anyway. Neither of them had been eager to let the night end, late as it was and Tony found himself looking at the Doc's contact on his phone more than a few times during the next few days.
The sound of his window opening really shouldn’t make him jump anymore but he was in full drag and he hadn't expected to see any of the pack tonight.
“Maybe my luck’s run out finally. Maybe there are no more miracles left. Though I think that bleeding out in the hot afghani desert might be preferable. At least there I’d be the only one paying for my fuck up.”
But she'd desperately placed the silver torc around his neck and kissed his head before leading the last of their warriors into the forest that had been their home. She'd gone to die, they'd all gone to die. To give the rest of them enough time to make it to the shore. To the ships that were waiting to take them into the unknown storm.
Kiba had shaken the water off like one of the clan dogs and grabbed the blond's hand with a grin, both taking off to the rooftops as the ninken howled behind them. Shika was easy to find at his usual cloud watching place and Kiba laughed as Naruto tackled him bodily, sending both of them tumbling.
Steve wheezed out a breath, he could feel his face growing cold. One thousand dollars. Oh my god. He couldn’t afford….. Oh my god. He was fucked. They were all fucked. His collar felt like a vice, the suit felt plastered to his body. Darkness crept along the edges of his vision. He tugged at his tie helplessly and gasped.
The last year had been hectic with him being away on missions for ten months out of twelve, coming back to his rooms at the Inuzuka Compound to eat his weight in his mother's cooking and sleep for a week before Tsunade sent him out for another mob outside of Kohona's walls.
That winter, when the villagers came to trade cured meat and fresh bread for potions and liniments for their ill, he'd negotiated shrewdly just as she'd taught him too.
With nothing else to build on, he'd ended up calling the Dinozzo network, contacting fellow investigators Greg Sanders in Las Vegas and Danny Messer in New York. He sent them the pics from his phone they both recommended that he seek out an entomologist.  Greg sent him some papers by the legendary Dr. Gil Grissom while Danny  provided a contact at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.
As he dismounted the bike and carefully took off his helmet, he saw the new laugh lines around the eyes, the soft flyaway hair; the relaxed slump of those broad shoulders.
The surprisingly calloused fingers tapped on the bar top in a cherry little pattern. The deep velvet voice chuckled. “The man has good tastes. And cocky too… starting off with the thousand dollar a shot whiskey before the circus even begins….”
Kiba had started it, stepping close to the blond boy to smell him, moving closer when Naru had turned those sad and lonely blue eyes to him and whined. Kiba had taken him home and cuddled him in blankets, waking up the next morning with half the nin-dogs in their bed and the blonde smelling like pack and happiness.
"Oh" Rodney's arms wrapped around his neck and pulled him close. "I keep forgetting that Seteda had such a long history before the wraith."
Rodney huffed a laugh. "Oh wow, perfect. You give me the address and I'll talk Elisabeth and John into going on a mission there. Easy peasy."
The chest had been opened up but the inner chamber remained intact, Thank Sol. At least they hadn't been able to access the solar engine. There was a failsafe built into the engine that would cause it to collapse if breached  forcefully.
“Damn the Iron King. The Iron King is dead. Long live the Iron King.”  The captain shook him, snarling.  “You’re alive. And you’re here with me. The goddess Nyx wouldn’t bless us like this just for us to turn away. How could Sol ‘the merciful’ demand such of us?”
Shika had tried to mumble about how troublesome they both were but he was too busy rolling the blond on to his back and kissing him breathless; his shadows quivering wildly in the dense trees.
They all looked as one to Anthony, who was seated at the head of the table; chin resting on one armored fist. He looked back at them, noting the surprise and fear barely hidden behind their calm facades. They were afraid. All of them. They’d never known a threat like this in their lifetimes.
There was an inch of water along the cave floor now, soaking Ronon's pants as he sat leaned against the smoothest wall. Rodney pushed down his panic. This was not the time to lose his head to panic. He had his injured mate to see to and that natural imperative seemed strong enough to override his usual fear response.
Here he could just be Anthony, just a man with a big heart who loved his people dearly. A man with driving need to learn and fix and build new and better things with his hands and with his genius intellect. A man with a soul mark that wasn’t supposed to exist and a true love that he would never be allowed to know.
The battle was short and brutal, the bombardment from below heavy and unceasing. He lost too many of his Iron Legion, just a fraction of them still intact by the end. He swore a streak at himself violently in his helm, cursing his own hubris and stupidity. Yet again he’d fallen into the trap of underestimating the enemy.
The blonde made a needy sound and froze, toes curling and moaning as he came a second time, long spurts of come splashing across his stomach, Shika and the soft grass.  Kiba fucked him through the orgasm, never slowing his pace or strength because he knew that Naru liked it that way.  Shika came with a grunt soon after, one hand grasping the blond's throat gently as he swallowed around the throbbing cock.
"I'm sorry too." he said softly, "I should have thought of that… with how you died and all. So… ah… are both of you still here… together … or is it just.."
There was no other choice. tomorrow, at Sol's zenith, he would take some of the Iron legion and go into the shadows of the Penumbra. He would find the ones responsible for the destruction of North Pass and he would destroy them. He would bring unto them the merciless wrath of Sol and scorch out the very core of their blackened souls.
Small things like chase his cats and stone his windows. Set gophers and rabbits in his garden to damage the delicate plants and roots. They stoned his old clay jars, spoiling the decades old ointments and treatments inside. They broke his broom and scattered the bristles into the stream. They poisoned his goats and soured their milk, poured boiling water on his beehives and crushed the soft, sticky honey combs under their thick boots.
There was always a fission of fear, a bit of doubt that if he let himself fall that Steve wouldn't catch him, wouldn't be there as he'd promised. It was always a leap of faith and faith was something that Tony had a hard time keeping hold of.
The lithe figure was almost swimming in the huge hooded sweatshirt, small glimpses of jewel blue skin covered in darker blue runes. Midnight black, almost blue hair hung limply from the pulled up hood and covered the sharp angled cheekbones and shin, also a rich gemstone blue.
Rodney was making faces at the water and Ronon swam over. The genius was examining a piece of smooth stone which looked dull in his palm but when he pulled it under water, it began to glow.
"I'm going to get you out of here." he whispered the promise against those soft lips. "Don't you worry. I'm the smartest man in two galaxies and this will not be our end. I promise you Di Na Nwunye."
He had a quick breakfast of protein and vitamin shake, munching on the edible globule container after for fiber, as he checked over the cockpit. He was right in position. He quickly did a scan of the debris field around the ship and, taking manual control, eased into the shadow of a huge curved hunk of colony; setting his ships orbit to match the slowly rotating mass of burnt and warped metal.
Tony wanted to kiss him so bad, he yearned for it. In fact, he wanted nothing more than for Lamar to invite him into his apartment. Into his arms and his bed. That didn't exactly happen but the doctor did lean over and give him a chaste kiss to the corner of his mouth. Tony licked at the spot, making the other man's brown eyes widen as he went pink.
Then, it was time for the epic road trip: Spike and Xander edition.  Sadly, they couldn’t secure a plane and driving was surprisingly hard with so many wrecked and derelict cars blocking the road ways.
Pepper would be getting the priority message right now, JARVIS would be implementing the rest with inhuman speed. Both Rhodey and Happy would be getting emails, giving them a heads up before the shit storm that was coming.
What he was interested in was finding a place so close to campus that only took up about half his rent allowance. It was on the first floor of a six apartment complex with a small yard and pool, thirty feet from a bus top and a fifteen minute bicycle ride from the university. He used the money he saved to buy a used but sturdy bicycle with a basket on the back for his books and a heavy riding coat for cold weather.
But alas, Rodney tore his gaze away and stepped back towards the door, taking a deep and ragged breath and adjusting himself in his pants. He made Ronon promise to meet him in the hanger in an hour and stumbled from the room, leaving the man aching with need and no lover to indulge that need with.
"You would." Hotchner's lip twitched at the corner, the closest thing to emotion Spencer had seen on him. He forced himself to stay still and be calm as those dark eyes turned their full force to him.
He looked back at the two Shield Agents as the phone in his pocket chimed a specific pattern. He gave them a placid smile.
Stiles stomach flopped and his eyes stung. Derek sighed tiredly and reached over, grasping around before snagging Stiles’ scarred hand.
It wasn't the most lucrative of sites but Duo was one of the smaller outfits run out of the sweepers. His ship, named Cerberus because of the three powerful rockets to the back, was a small to medium sized ship, enough for a crew of one to handle. If that one was a crack pilot/ engineer/ gunner/scavenger former gundam pilot.
Her brother awoke to her hand holding his and he smiled through his spilt lip, the heart monitor beeping softly in the background.
Dark lashes flutter and eyes red as the rarest rubies flickered up to look at him though long, thick hair. They flashed red for half a second before they dulled and fell away. He let out his breath slowly through his lips, his shoulders losing some of their tension.
He was startled out of his musings when the door slammed open, the large brunet stomping in. “Take off your fucking clothes.”
He proceeded to crawl into Ronon's lap, gabbing about how he and Miko had been working on this project on the side and how he'd  thought is a perfect idea to try it out here with Ronon.
“Hey no, not like that. They’ll be consultants and get paid a generous stipend for their efforts. They’d be making a huge contribution to the project after all.
He looked down at the man at his feet. Ronon had taken the brunt of the impact when the floor had collapsed beneath them, breaking his leg and injuring his head which was still bleeding sluggishly through the bandage Rodney had managed to put around it.
Loving Lamar was easy. Almost frightfully so. They seemed so different on paper but face to face they just seemed to gel in all the right ways. Tony still had his insecurities, he still struggled with his self-worth but talking to his lover, sharing his doubts and fears with another instead of keeping it all bottled up; helped him deal with a few of his deeper issues.
But now, faced with his own death and the passing on of his legacy; he allowed himself to be a little selfish. He bit his lip, the most overt sign of weakness he’d allowed himself yet and shifted a bit closer. The captain froze then shifted away, sliding off the stool as Anthony backed up a few steps. They stared at each other for a while before the blond looked away.
He hesitated before stripping out of his under suit. It was the last thing he had from his armor and he already felt so very vulnerable. Still, he hadn’t washed in over two days and the suit was sticking to his skin uncomfortably. He growled and stripped it off, baring his shoulders to the cold. He shivered as he shimmied out of the leggings and squatted before the bucket. He’d never had such a crude bath before but he quickly worked out the mechanics of it and scrubbed himself clean. There was a rough towel to dry his skin and he slipped into the clothes provided. The sleeves were long and he rolled them up so that he could clean his under suit as best he could. Satisfied that it was as clean as he could get it, he hung it carefully near the heater to dry, planning to put it back on under his clothes when it did.
He was holding on to the last bit of his sanity, the various thoughts that circled his mind like a maelstrom since he'd been three years old. When Steve got like this, fucking him slow and steady until Tony surrendered completely, it always felt like he was falling from some steep edge.
He ignored it, rocking into his mate as he chased his own release. Zelenka and Biro could surely handle whatever problem had cropped up. Whoever was calling would soon get tired of trying to get Rodney and call one of the other two.
Stiles worked his jaw back and forth in the familiar exercise, feeling as the scars along his cheek and neck pulled dully. The nerves along that swatch of skin had withered years ago so he no longer felt the pain that crept like fire under his skin.
“Yeah, that’s why she’s so fucking badass.” Stiles chuckled. “I totally ship Max and Dalton though but man, that slow burn is killing me. Get them together already. Max needs to catch a fucking clue seriously. He’s totally oblivious to Dalton’s angsty pining.”
Naru made an adorable sleepy sound and snuggled deeper, snuffling softly into Kiba's shoulder as his eyes fluttered shut. Kiba traded fond looks with Shika over the tanned shoulder and smirked as the other man pressed a fond kiss against said shoulder. Naruto just murmured sleepily and threw a leg over Kiba's, his hand seeking Shika's and pulling it to his taut stomach.
Tony lowered his camera, pulling out his cell phone and turning on the light. It saved him having to trek back across the room to grab the light from his toolkit and he was already half leaning/crouching into the closet of their latest murder victim. He used his phone camera to zoom in on the evidence, unable to hold the phone's light up as well as properly focus the heavy crime scene camera.
Mind clear and sharp, he glanced past Rhodes and the burning forge to the dark mountains where the gaze of Mighty Sol ended and the Penumbra territory sat, laying like a crouching beast in wait.
He cradled it against his chest, scolding it softly before carefully placing it in one of the open tool kits. It chittered and scrambled at the sides before pulsing its lights forlornly. He huffed and pouted at the little thing, valiantly ignoring the man watching him from the shadow of the doorway.
The ladies at the jungle were a god send, taking him under wing and showing his the ins and outs of making up his face and putting on his wig.
She pulled her frizzy hair into a bun at the nape of her neck, wrapping it tight and securing it with a black band. She slipped a clack stocking over the bun to keep it neat. Her black dance leotard went on next, no underwear as the shapewear kept her secure. It covered her from neck to ankle but she rolled up the legs and arms, pulling the neck until it rode low.
“Nah, that’s just the rotten cherry on top the already shit Sunday.” Steve gave a mirthless laugh. “The worst part of this whole mess is that I’ve lost my one slim chance to bid for a night with Justin hammer.”
Somewhat mollified, Rodney dug into one of the pockets of his vest, pulling out six little silver packets, handing one each to John and Teyla, two to Ronon and kept two for himself.
He finished his makeup and dressed, saving the wig for last. There as a basket on the bed, complete with back up Toto, a little spiky stuffed dog  with soulful black glass eyes.
Rodney shook, his head thrown back as he cried out from the change of angle and slow pace. His skin all but glowed, the nebula stretching out behind him to encompass the whole sky as if he was the centre of Ronon's universe.
FoloxitinB most likely. He hadn’t been able to build up an immunity to it as yet considering how hard it was to procure and how expensive it was to source, it had seemed more of a hassle than anything to do so. He regretted it now. Determined bounty hunters usually had a dart or two in their arsenal when going after the big jobs. And Richard B. Riddick was one of the biggest.
They both had reasons for being alone. Both had people that they would have loved spend time with tonight. Eventually, a light appears to the west, looking something like the sun rising in reverse at the forest brightened around them. Stiles fumbled in the pocket of his hoodie and pulled out two of those paper eclipse glasses, absently handing one to his companion as he slipped his pair on.
The door swung open and he blinked at the light that flooded through the doorway. There were three guards were silhouetted in the dim blue and he followed them without protest until they entered a large, well lit space.
He fucked lazily into the blond a few more times, enjoying the tremors of pleasure as his half hard cock pressed against all the slick quivering places deep inside the blond. he rolled to the side as he slipped out, pulling a boneless Naru with him as Shika laid himself along the blond's back, tucking him between them both.
"You know what," Tony tilted his head coquettishly, "I think it's time for me to collect on some of my investment."
Luckily or unluckily so, he'd come across the little crooked house with its little crooked fence and overgrown garden. With its seven cats of various colours and temperaments. With its bundles of dried herbs and flowers and giant clay pots of mysterious preserves.
"Shika." he murmured when he got near enough, dropping unceremoniously to the ground and rolling over to tuck himself against the man's side. He settled his cheek against the Nara's shoulder, rubbing his sensitive nose into the thin material of the man's vest, and took a deep breath.
She dug into the pocket of the tote and pulled out a foundation compact. It felt like she was putting it on with a butter knife but the darkening effect was passable at a glance. She looked at least three shades darker and she pulled out her phone and checked facebook for a final comparison.
"No" Candy shrieked once more. "If the little bitch wants to wait until we've come all this way to chicken out in the end then fucking leave him. He can walk the fuck back."
Teyla, who had been looking at John's motions carefully, also tore open her packet and squeezed out the lotion. Rodney glanced over.
She reached into her closet, feeling along the top of the inside door frame for a zip lock bag she'd taped there. Inside were a half dozen zip ties, a bottle of hand sanitizer, a pair of latex gloves, an ice pick and a shiv she'd learned how to make off the internet from a tooth brush, saran wrap and a lighter. She also had said lighter.
Steve flushed at the barely disguised disgust in the man’s voice, shaking his head roughly. He felt an overwhelming need to explain himself to this stranger. To not let him walk away with the wrong idea.
He look away, his skin flushed as he twisted his leg to show the Sol damned mark on his inner thigh. The brunet stared at the mark in disbelief, reaching forward as if to touch it before stopping in mortification. He glanced up at Anthony with his own shame swirling in those grey eyes. One never touched a mark not their own, not without permission. That was known even in the deepest of penumbra bad lands.
The first month was quiet. He was hardly home and when he did drag himself home from the library, he would flop face first unto the bed and sleep like the dead. School kept him busy. Social navigation kept him frustrated and grumpy. He cooked the simple dishes his mother taught him how to make and ate them distractedly while peering at his laptop or at his reference books.
Steve rolled his hips, sending shockwaves of pleasure through Tony's frame, making his eyes roll wildly in his head as he gasped and mewled.
Without a word Steve, lifted the edge of the blanket, the welcome unspoken and deeply appreciated. The book was set aside and arms tucked him close to that barrel chest. The steady thump of a heartbeat against his cheek, chasing away his errant thoughts and settling him the way nothing else could.
The captain’s voice came from the doorway and Anthony froze for a long moment before setting the little machination down gently. It wiggled a bit on its back before he gently turned it over. It scuttled along the table, diving off the edge and making him lunge to catch it before it broke itself apart on the stone floor.
Danny chuckled darkly. "Chris Argent is driving the bodies down to San Diego as we speak. He sends his thanks by the way. Both the hide and the horns are extremely rare and he can get a pretty penny for them from the right buyer."
He debated for a second whether to warn them of the danger but kept his lips pressed firm together. He would surely perish in the resulting explosion but at least he would manage to take out the rest of the rebel base with him.
She wanted to be a soldier. She wanted to be a citizen. She wanted to take it to the bugs who'd taken her home, her family and even parts of her body from her. she wanted her life to mean something after she'd fought so hard for it.
He locked his knees together to keep from falling, forcing himself to watch as the only home he'd ever known burned. He was chieftain now. It was his duty to bear witness to what had come to pass.
She'd woken up on the moon base, still in the medical healing tank. The knitting devices were still patching up her side and ragged stubs that were her right arm and leg. Afterwards, the doctors had explained that both limbs had been too far gone to re attached by the time they'd gotten her to proper medical treatment and growing all new limbs were too expensive with the war on.
She must have seen the look of disbelief on his face because she scoffed loudly and waved her hand. "Believe me, if the Bossman had been upset with you in any way, we would have been having a different conversation entirely."
He turned his head to his best friend. Blaise eyes were dark with fear and fury. His dark face was covered in soot and ash and there was dried blood along his temple. "What do we do now Dray? Where do we go so they won't find us and kill us? Dumbledore's Army will never stop until they have killed us all, you know that."
He bought a lava lamp from a local thrift store because he was feeling facetious.  Watching its red orange glowing blobs float within the mystery liquid  in the corner a weirdly comforting to look at when his mind was running in circles over his latest assignment.
yeh... i know... the 22nd has come and long gone but it tool me a while to get back into the writing mood. sometimes having too many prompt words can back fire on a writer.
He kept his gaze straight ahead, his chin up and defiant. He would not show weakness in front of these rebel scum. The owner of the voice walked around him to stand at one of the table. His shoulders were broad, stretching his navy blue wool shirt across his muscled back.
Damn Scott for chickening out and leaving stiles in the lurch. Going as Dorothy and Toto would have been priceless, with Scott being a werewolf at all.
One of the blue lights grazed his side and took out the power for half his suit half his suit, the suddenly dead weight making him fall from the sky like a stone. As he spun, struggling to regain control, he instructed three of the Legion to peel away from the conflict and head back to the Citadel. They needed to report to his General. Four more of the remaining Legion came to him, bracing his suit and slowing his speed until they all hit the ground with a crash.
He'd faced starvation amongst the so called good people of the village, his father's house and business taken over by ever so helpful distant family relatives.
Ronon only nodded as they descended into the gate room and Rodney started dialing. He recognized that address and frowned. The genius spoke before he could protest though.
"At ease, Private." a deep and familiar voice echoed from behind her and her breath caught in her throat."
He could feel the man startle as the rough feel of his scars, the warm fingertips gently feeling along Stiles cheek bones up to the ridge of his forehead, where his eye brow was split.
Along the way, the legionnaire tried to interface with the truck’s tech but all attempts failed. It seemed that the robot was just too advanced or too different for the truck because it had more success with the newer looking comm unit.
His gaze travelled lazily down Riddick’s built form, his eyes glinting with appreciation. The gaze felt like a caress and Riddick shifted, letting his legs fall as wide as the restraints would let them. He let his ‘come fuck me smile’ spread over his face and watched in satisfaction as Reaper’s lips went slack, a flush crawling up his neck.
"Oh you don't know the half, Very Special Agent. As someone who has loved insects since he was five years old, I've heard and been called every name imaginable. There's hardly anything anyone can call me know that I haven't heard before."
Tony tolled his eyes. "You need my tech on this. And you wouldn't mind one bit if you got it for free or good as. And don't you lecture me on what's right,  Cyclops, or you wouldn't have come at me with extortion right off the bat."
He was wearing Erik's old MIT shirt, it was large on him and came down to Tony's mid-thigh. He looked cuddly and adorable in it, not that he would ever tell the smaller man that to his face. Tony was sensitive about his height, even though he enjoyed tucking himself against Erik's chin as he snuggled to watch a movie.
Anthony was at war with himself. He had a choice between betraying his kingdom and betraying his soul mated. His rational mind and emotional heart were in all-out battle. His body craved for the blond, yearned for him. The man was like oxygen, like warmth, like light. He couldn’t imagine living without him.
Spencer tilted his head, eyes narrowing as he glanced between both Dom and Sub. "That's mostly because Doms believe that they have to match closely with their Subs and Sub Presentation Fashion has evolved over the decades to highlight sexuality and vulnerability and Dom Fashion does not adapt well to those principles."
"It's a hologram. It's not real. I just took the footage from outside the ship and projected it on the inside."
They ate the food Rodney had packed and drank the sweet juice; Rodney softly pointing out various interesting features of the vast space anomaly that surrounded them. Ronon grunted where needed, content to just lay there with his mate in his arms.
"Sadly, my red haired goddess isn't interested in any one between her legs who isn't Jackson Fucking Whitmore so I never had a chance. I just gave her a small piece of information I had been keeping secret that would give her heavy leverage over Baron Peter Hale."
Training ground sixteen looked the way it usually did, a small, grassy clearing surrounded by the ever present towering trees. Under the shade of one such tree Akamaru lay, gnawing on a fallen branch; his tail whapping happily on the ground. A familiar slim figure lay next to him, hands behind their head as they stared up into the bright blue sky.
From his vantage point, high above the forge, Anthony could faintly hear the screams of the fleeing citizens of the usually idyllic farming community situated snugly around the base of the forge. He’d already dispatched some of the Legion to help evacuate, guiding people into the arms of local peace keepers.
The blue light lit the cab dimly as Anthony got the vehicle started, flushing with secret pride that he’d been able to figure out such strange technology so quickly. He made the awakened driver his navigator and the vehicle crawled forth towards the nearest base.
A clear and strident voice brought him from his light musing. Hotchner's eyes were sharp and piercing and Spencer forced himself to hold the man's gaze for a few moments before  lowering his eyes.
When he'd lost his whole world and been made a runner, he never thought that he would have that kind of love again. But Rodney Mckay was a man full of surprises and he'd shouldered his way into Ronon's heart in that tactless yet endearing way of his.
Rodney was slick and welcomed him into that wonderful, distracting heat that made Ronon shudder at the sensation. He bucked into his lover, tasting the salt of his skin and feeling that firm muscle under that soft skin.
"Uh..no." he gave her a half lidded look, already fed up with the circular conversation. "If you were really concerned about these so called 'innocent lives' you keep harping about, you would have either told me flat out what the actual problem was so that my pack could decide whether take care of it ourselves or you would have found another way entirely. Your motives are as transparent as glass Alpha Hale."
He huffed a disgusted little laugh. "You think you can come in here and make me jump through whatever hoops you hold up on any given day. That you can dangle your 'greater good' in front of little Anthony Stark and I'll do all of the heavy listing."
"You motherfuckers." He laughed, the sound of it chilling as it echoed through the silent clearing.  "I must admit that I'm no longer surprised by the shit you keep trying to pull over on me. " He gave his former best friend a simple nod. "I'll see to making sure my dad stays safe and sound, don't you worry scottywolf. We Vulpinis look after our own."
She'd filled up most of the pages with notes and sketches, writing and crossing out and writing and scratching and ripping out what she'd didn't want, didn't need.
"You're so damned selfish." Laura scoffed loudly, pushing herself into the lime light once again. "People could die and you want to play stupid power games. You should be ashamed of yourself."
“You don’t sound too sure of that anymore. You said it yourself, the Iron King is dead. Your duty is fulfilled.” He murmured the last words against Anthony’s cheeks them claims his mouth in a devastating kiss that made the smaller man weak in the knees.
Tony whimpered and went up to his toes, pressing closer until they were plastered to each other. When they finally parted, they were both breathless.
His thin under suit provided almost no protection against the chill winds, and the rocky landscape was barely visible in the gloom.
His father had caught him one day, pausing in the doorway of the kitchen while Stiles happily made dinner. The younger man had flushed at being caught, shrugging and saying.
It had been a while since he'd been so quickly and deeply in tune with someone else. His last steady female relationship had been Wendy and the wedding that wasn't. his last male attraction had been Gibbs but that had soon become twisted and had withered away under the weight of their eroding rapport.
She recalledered Johnny yanking her by the back of her uniform as he yelled at the pilot to take off. The last thing she'd remembered was the medic pouring clotting powder on her and the blazing heat of it sending her under, Jonny's voice giving her comfort as she faded away.
Just then, Tony curled to his side, tugging the sweater jacket closer and rubbing his cheek against the soft chunky knit; utterly decimating the last of Steve’s defenses in the process.
Stiles would understand right? I mean, he could come with them. Scott was sure that Lydia wouldn't mind… much.
Thankfully, both Booth and Brennan were also there with some of their team and that helped make the night more enjoyable. By the end of the night, they'd talked and laughed and danced until they were both exhausted and a little tipsy. Tony escorted Lamar home, lingering in the door way as the Doctor fumbled with his keys.
"We've been able to replicate science drones in the city. Like the battle drones but these collect data and send it back through the gate. We've been sending them to the no go addresses on your list. Most of them are uninhabitable like your notes indicated but some of them are space gates. We found this one a week ago and all the astronomy geeks are over the moon. "
Tony moaned, bringing up his hand to wipe at the corners of his eyes. He flexed his thighs around Steve's waist, toes curling as Steve pressed in deep and stilled.
Barely a second after Akamaru gave an excited yip, Kiba had his arms full of blonde ninja. Naruto tasted like ramen and smelt like dirt, sweat and the embers of a low fire. Under that was the heady scent of power that Kiba recognized as the Kyuubi and the old ink of the Fourth Hokage's seal.
His new found knowledge in entomology came in handy when the body of a marine turned up infested with unknown larvae. Tony had quickly snapped a picture and sent it to Lamar who'd alerted Brenan and her team as it was another rare species not native to the US. when Seeley had swooped in to pull the case into their larger black market investigation, Gibbs had been livid.
The youngest Potter had claimed the last great dragon moth and had already been sworn in as its rider.
Ok. i am really enjoying my little Ronon/Rodney Stories. they seem to all be in the same universe somehow. i may end up posting them together in a different story.
He sent Tony off to take a hot shower, laying out a pair of black sweats and a deep red LSUNO as well as a pair of thick socks on the bed of the guest bedroom. When Tony finally wandered out, there was hot delicious soup and crusty bruschetta waiting for him.
Tony had lunch with Seeley, discussing some of the cases they'd both encountered and cultivating a friendship that Tony truly appreciated and cherished. Booth was a smart and experienced agent and respected tony on a professional level that he'd been lacking  lately in his own work place.
He picked up the black leather collar with a silver "Toto" mounted on it, frowning as he eyed the dog, contemplating how it would fit.  He glanced over at the fluffy black wolf ears head band on the bed and pushed down the surge of anger.
Derek soon joined him in laughter and it echoed through the quiet and cozy little house for a long while. They settled against each other on the couch, Derek’s arm slung over Stiles’ shoulder as they caught their breath.
The man was close. Too close for Anthony's comfort as well as the peace of mind of his guard. Anthony could see them tensing out of the corner of his eyes, the brunet making an aborted step forward before carefully pulling back.
He cocked his head, "I can't believe no one in medical ever went over this with either of you. I have to talk to Carson about this. With all that I complain about his bone rattle and sheep's blood, simple protective measures should be taken for anyone going through the gate."
Rounding out the penultimate with some Tony/Steve fluffy smut. i love my boys and they deserve t be happy.
On Seteda, the warriors often shared their bodies with each other. It brought them closer and satisfied their sexual appetites. It was different on Atlantis, earth people were such prudes.  He'd approached John one time but the man, though thoroughly flattered, flummoxed and embarrassed at the offer, had politely declined and explained about the myriad of earth ways which made it a bad idea.
So, as thanks for making himself available after working hours, Tony invited the man to a late dinner. Lamar had readily agreed, tugging on an actual tweed jacket and knitted scarf against the nights chill. Tony took him to one of the quieter, lesser known places he frequented and they ate light, it being almost midnight when they finally left the museum.
"Yup." She nodded, her curls bouncing cheerfully. "The spell you set up worked. It came right to the Nemeton like catnip. Brought a couple of friends like you guessed it would.  Got them all in one neat swoop."
He also had to know which ones never to dial. Which ones lead to poisonous atmospheres or to enemies just as bad as the wraith. He had to keep them all in his head and keep them straight because one small mistake could lead to death, or worse.
He stumbled back a few paces before turning on his heel and fleeing the room.  Anthony blinked back tears and sank back unto the bed, his heart crumbling in his chest. Sol damn his weak and pitiful heart. Damn his selfish hope. He was right to crush all ideas of love, all dreams of happiness. He was the Iron king… He used to be the Iron King. No doubt the next King had already been crowned and was beloved by the citadel. No doubt they would have a period of mourning for him. Would lay fire gladiolas along the palace walkways and set sunflowers afloat along the crystal clear waters of the great canal.
The blond straightened up and gave a deep sigh, realizing how well and truly fucked he was. With one last, lingering glance at the sleeping engineer, he nodded his head and strode from the workshop with a determined step; plans already forming in his head.
"I guess." Scott calmed down and shrugged sheepishly. "That still doesn't mean that you have to do this."
One of the guards chuckled behind him and Anthony felt his hand curl into fists, a flush crawling up his neck.  Thank  Sol for the under suit, thin as it was. He forced himself to breathe evenly, unfurling his fists and letting his hands fall relaxed at his sides.
They ate in comfortable silence, Tony drifting over to the piano when he was done. His mind drifted as he lingered over the keys, not able to concentrate on one thing for too long.
Ewan watched in chilled silence as the man described the group of young people having left the house after a couple of hours, having taken all the pictures they needed. They'd then left in their little car and the couple hadn't seen hide nor hair of them when they made their way home that evening.
Riddick woke to darkness, his head ringing and feeling as if it were floating on a string above him.
Shikamaru fell into things quite easily. Naruto had walked up to the Jounin in a deserted alley just off the Hokage Tower and pressed him against the wall, kissing him deeply until they were both moaning. Kiba had watched from his perch on fence nearby, grinning as the taller nin had blushed red at having been kissed so enthusiastically.
They made their way out of the catacomb entrance, passed a drunk and giggly Isaac Lahey and hurried to the tree line.
That night, he set up a shrine in front of the lava lamp and placed the pictures of both young men amongst the offerings. Falling gracefully to his knees, he lit the incense and set some of the money on fire, bowing to the shrine. He asked the spirits to be appeased, to please protect the home and it inhabitant and to finally find peace.
Anthony nodded just as another explosion boomed from deep within the burning fortress. “We’ve managed to secure the main conduit, locking off the feedback to the other forges. The rest of the grid is holding and I’ve doubled security measures at the remaining forges.”
Ronon chuckled, rubbing his hands up and down his lover's broad back, trailing a line of soft, open mouthed kisses down Rodney's cheek, jaw until he claimed that pouting mouth.
Suddenly, the beam lifted away, the sound of replusors whining as the metal bent and buckled. Ironman tossed the beam away sending it crashing into the next room. Next thing he knew, he was being held carefully in metal arms as they took off through the large hole he'd made when he'd crashed through the wall.
Anthony cast his gaze there, seeing the gleaming gold turn orange as light filtered through the towers of glass. He could sense the Iron Legion there, hovering just within the direct sunlight and reflecting it down to the grateful citizens. Doing their duty to their people and to their King.
"Dot little spots all over your body, then rub them in. a little goes a long way. John, get her back and I'll do Ronon's. Make sure to get as much coverage as you can. We don't like cancer but sunburn is a major issue as well."
Behind him, Coulson stiffened, hands clenching briefly before relaxing as if by force. Tony sat back in his office chair, his face blank and emotionless.
No one in the Citadel believed that the Solar Forges would ever fall. Just as the Iron King sat on the Rex Solaris, so would the Sunlight Kingdom ever prosper. Anthony on the other hand, was a pragmatist. Expect the best, Prepare for the worst. He had to be the one to look beyond the obvious, to stand against the encroaching darkness.
He looked down at the destroyed Legionnaire. The stubbornly loyal android who'd saved his life many times over in the short time that they'd had only each other in a strange, cold land.
He hugged himself, not against the actual cold but against a cold growing inside him, sitting on his chest like lead. He watched numbly as the local LEOs brought out the last of the cult members either in hand cuffs or in body bags. CPS was on the scene, seeing to the kids they'd managed to recover. Much fewer than had been recorded missing though. Much, much fewer.
He made great time to the clearing, dismounting and tapping a pattern to the bee's back, commanding it to go back home. Buzzcut nuzzled his side in affection, getting pollen all along his pants before it zoomed off into the distance. He watched it go for a bit, a fond smile on his face, before turning back to the other nervous choosing day hopefuls.
He instructed the legionnaire to dig, burying the broken automatons as well as his own armor so that they would not fall into enemy hands. A location beacon would allow them to return at a later date for retrieval.
He blacked out from the impact, as slowed as it was, coming to in an alcove surrounded by four of the Legion. Two of them were barely functional and one lay broken and inert. The remaining one was standing guard, continuously scanning the surroundings for enemy movement. Anthony checked his suit with a grimace, the damaged half was still dead, no matter how many times he tried to bypass or reboot the system. He eventually had to abandon it, the final Legionnaire helping him to peel off the heavy armor.
"Malignant Melanoma is a type of cancer that develops  in pigment containing cells in the body called melanocytes. It's what gives human skin it's complexion. It's mainly caused by UV rays which comes from direct exposure to sunlight."
Strangely, the lava lamp also seemed to be the catalyst for the odd events that started happening. Things started being moved. Just small things either being moved a few inches to the left  or disappearing only to cheekily reappear after he just finished searching the entire apartment for it.
“Because you’re more valuable to me alive than dead, even now.” A deep voice came from one side and he looked over quickly only to wince and cradle his head. He hadn’t realized that he’d spoken out loud.
"Well, if you have nothing to say to us, we have other ways of gaining information." The rebel Captain looked over his shoulder at his guard. "Take him to the Doc."
Jake nodded sagely, as he never got worked up over anything. It was part of the reason why he got along well with Candy and most of the reason she grew fed up with his ass after a stint of dating. The blonde in question all but growled, her hands white knuckled on the steering wheel.
It’s not like Stiles hadn’t been slowly going out of his mind for the past few days. Like he hadn’t been see sawing between manic, caffeine fueled google marathons and depressive panic attacks. Like he hadn’t had a serious come to Jesus moment and been struck in the face that all the struggles he’d faced had basically been for nothing. That what future he’d imagined for himself were all worthless in the face of imminent destruction. The realization that they were all going to live after all had left him adrift, his mind stalled and floating on a vast sea of numb and uncertain darkness.
The hot knife of jealousy didn't slice into her at the thought of the other woman anymore. Dizzy had had Johnny in all the important of ways that night before the Whiskey Mission and had sated a lifelong dream deep inside her.
Case in point, Talia Hale who was currently trying to both keep her daughter from the ends of Stiles' claws and trying to get him to listen to what she was trying to say. Stiles gave a mock yawn, exchanging humorous looks with this own crew who were trying not to snigger as his utter lack of respect.
Laura tried to argue but Peter yanked her into the shadows with a sharp growl. There was some shuffling from the tree line but eventually their footsteps were heard getting further and further away. Soon after the rest of the wolves slipped into the trees, their heartbeats growing fainter and fainter until only Talia remained.
"Oh, it's a month and a half from now. Don't worry, you've got plenty of time." Rossi piped up, no doubt trying to be reassuring.
The apartment was nice enough, bare bones with old furniture that was more retro than vintage. Weird green and mustard colored chairs and ugly dark wood. It looked like it came out of the 1970s. There were a few attempts to modernize but they all seemed half finished or abandoned as if the person got fed up or gave up in the middle.
“You’re the leader.” Anthony murmured. “You’re the one who been bringing the rebels together and organizing them. We knew that there had to be someone.”
Draco was still having a light breakfast of honey on toast with some strong lavender tea when the news came from the village, brought by a panting and swaying runner.
He held on desperately onto the blonde's arms as he shook, feeling every hot and heavy inch inside him . Steve was pressing on his everything, leaving no reprieve or relief as he made steady shallow thrusts, massaging Tony's inner walls, the blond gasping at the drag of that soft velvet soft against his cock.
He would not be baited by this man and his stunning smile. He lifted hi chin in defiance, meeting the Captain's gaze with narrowed eyes. He felt vulnerable without his armor.  He missed its weight on his shoulders, the power at his fingertips, its golden gleam under Sol's gaze, the shield it provided from the world around him.
John absently wondered how the man was able to walk blindly through the wooded path without tripping over some random root when he could trip over his own feet walking through Atlantis.
In this cold and dark place, he felt naked, weak and at the mercy of the shadows that lurked at every corner. The Rebel leader had him at a disadvantage and it galled him to be in such a position.
Viscount Lucius Malfoy's epic feud against Marquis James Potter had been a long fought and bitter one, both men nurturing the embers of black hate for each other in their guts for years on end. Personally, Draco thought that it was all just a waste of time and that both men should just hate fuck and get it out of their systems. He was sure that both Lady Lily and his mother would agree.
After reasonably freaking the fuck out, the world leaders demanded to know why they hadn’t been able to give more goddamn warning before the end of the world.
Legs intertwined, socked feet tucked up against bare ones, breaths mingling and evening out. Blanket snug around them and the cold of bad weather kept out by tempered glass and JARVIS’ watchful eye.
He wanted to tuck himself right along Tony’s back and stay there forever, if that’s what it took to wake up to that sound every morning. He wanted to see Tony in bed, sleep soft and wearing one of his shirts, the sleeves falling past his fingertips and collar falling off his shoulder.
"I need something custom made for Derek.." Aaron glanced at the sub kneeling comfortably. "There will be a meeting of the Famiglias Maiò very soon and we have been invited to present. I want my submissive dressed to impress the other major familes."
But none of that mattered as he leaned in and captured sweet, soft lips with his. As he slid his hands around a trim waist. As warm hands slip up his shoulders and into his hair. As they both moaned at the fire that kindled in their bellies.
Heart racing, she went on to the next step of her plan without as much as a pause for breath. Palming the shiv and tucking the handle into her overlarge sleeve, she made her way towards the row of poorer town houses across bus route 6.
She'd just taken out a Tanker Bug and was beating feet to the ship when Johnny had shouted "Spiral Roll Out Left!", an alarmed look on his face. she hadn't even hesitated, executing the maneuver she'd drilled into her brain over years as quarterback of the high school football team.
Ronon kissed him deeply, conveying his gratitude and affection for the compassion that very few people knew that Rodney possessed.
He was not sure how long he sat on that bed before rousing from boredom. He walked over to the work table, gingerly sitting on the stool. His fingers crept closer to the disassembled tech as he glanced at the still closed door. No doubt locked and guarded. When no one crashed through to berate him for his curiosity, he turned back to the table with renewed interest.
He quietly contemplated the few conversations that he’d had with the Thunder God in the past, about the Dwarves of Nidavellir and the artisans of Asgard, his eyes tracing the complex path of the exquisite gold.
He stumbled out into the harshly lit room he’d stood in before, where he’d first met the captain. There were more people this time and most of them stopped and stared as he passed, their conversations falling quiet. He forced down the urge to squirm uncomfortably. He would not show weakness before these shadow dwellers.
This time the dark eyebrow went higher. "I hadn't planned on it. Presentation outfits tend to be a bit … whimsical."
He'd barely gotten though pouring some of the sweet smelling oil into a small bowl when there was an unholy screech and the lava lamp went flying, crashing into the opposite wall with a shower of glass and orange red mess. Wufei ducked his head to protect against the shards and turned to stare wide eyed at the dripping wall.
He held up the collar, wondering how the alpha would react. To his surprise, Derek knelt between his socked feet and looked up at him with a curl of his lip.
“Just put them on if you don’t want to be a blind wolf.” He grouched, feeling Derek’s glare on the side of his face. He smirked openly when the werewolf growled and put them on, knocking the man’s shoulder with his own and keeping it there, settling against the alpha comfortably.
All these doubts and fears must have shown in his eyes because the blond cupped his chilled face with one large, warm hand.  “Stay with me, please.”
Stiles went boneless in his arms and he smiled in smug satisfaction. He continued until he felt Stiles' breath even out before letting himself fall into sleep.
Anthony scoffed, curling his lip at the very idea of a ransom being paid. The captain quirked a curious eye. “You disagree? You don’t think that your precious hand of Sol will trade for your return? The same self-righteous bastard that sent you over the Unlit Mountains to kill us. To roust us out of our homes and murder us. Is your life just as worthless to him as ours?”
Steve spun to face the owner of the voice and stared, stunned. The man was beautiful, dark haired, bright eyes and utterly beautiful. He was also looking at Steve with genuine concern, something Steve hadn’t encountered in a stranger in a long fucking time.
Stiles had already set everything up and they got down to the solemn business of building the fire that would guide his father's passage.
The werewolf moved around the cabin comfortably, leaving Stiles to come in and close the door behind himself . Stiles watched him putter around the kitchen, tugging off his gloves and stuffing them into his jacket pocket.
He took one more look at his room, nodding in approval at the set up. He only needed one more thing for everything to be perfect. As if on cue, his door chimed and opened, his mate striding in with one hand to his comm unit and a white knuckled grip around his tablet.
“The loss at North Pass is unacceptable. How could those dirty shadow dwellers even get through the defenses?” the Governor of Phoebus District was red in the face, hands braced on the large round table of the Council Chambers. “And what about the power that has been lost? The new Forges at Glist and Kragenheed won’t be competed for another five years. What will be done for the areas affected by power loss?”
Lamar flourished within the new peer group, making fast friends with the team and growing new confidence professionally.  He asks Tony to be his plus one for the annual museum gala and Tony accepts, flattered and enchanted to see Lamar stutter though his invitation.
His mission with the Sannin Jiraiya had come down just as they were starting to get comfortable and it had been hard to see someone so important to them say good bye. That was a ninja's life though, fleeting and dangerous. They'd spent that last night together, burning their passion into their memories because who knew who long it would be until they all met again, if they even would.
“For you to shiv my reckless ass in the back. Fuck no.” The other man barked a sharp, hoarse laugh. “I will, however, stop if you tell me to. I’m not a rapist, no matter what kind of bad rap most hunters have. I just think that men like us don’t often get a chance to have things easy without looking over their shoulder for the next bullet… the next knife.”
He took care of them, he treasured them. He paid attention to the little tags with washing instructions and had long conversations with the JARVIS as well as the Tower’s laundry service staff.
His eyes had filled up and all the righteous anger he'd been feeling at All American hypocrite and liar Steve Rogers his long lost ex, Bucky; had bled away into heartbreak.
Rodney wasn't the typical caregiver/ provider type, turning off most others with his acerbic tongue and intolerance for stupid bullshit. But Ronon wasn't most others. The smart mouthed genius reminded him so much of his mate on Seteda, a real firecracker and fierce warrior.
Erik smiled, wild and wicked as his fingers traced the crack of Tony's ass and pressed the pad of his middle finger against the smaller man's asshole.
"What the hell are you wearing?" Stiles blurted out, basket dropping unto the bed. "You aren't hot enough as it is? You have to walk around looking like that?"
He was basically a prisoner to one of the most powerful crime families in Chicago, kidnapped from his life for god knows how long in the house of a ruthless and dangerous Dom.
That that was the last time he was trusting locals about complicated meteorological patterns and events. He would have to tweak the science drones to record weather patterns as well. The city had already opened the Met labs and such strides were already being made in weather prediction. He kicked himself for not including more of that tech into the modified drones used as UAVs. Stupid Rodney.
Stiles gave his best friend a long look, hoping that the secret love those two held for each other worked out. He knew that Allison's family would never let her marry a healer's son and Scott was too soft hearted to rise the ranks of the Military. It was an ill-fated match and he hoped that their hearts wouldn't be broken in the end.
Scientists fired back equally as hotly that decades of severe budget cuts had crippled them from looking at more than 20% of space and, if people didn’t know, space was actually ginormous as shit, fuck you very much. Like really fucking humongous.
He'd watched you tube videos on styling his brown wig into pigtails, the blue ribbons tied in bows at the ends of the braids.
They told him the apartment was haunted. That no one had ever spent more than six months there before they either moved out, ran out or had to be carried out in straight jacket by burly men in white coats. Wufei didn't believe any of it, naturally. The last one was utterly ridiculous.
“Take off your clothes or I will rip them off you.” The man growled. “There’s no way that you’re his soul mated.”
The billowing black smoke blotted out the night sky, only leaving glimpses of the star filled heavens. He'd swung through the stuff a few times, the filters of his mask working hard against the grit and soot. The police had clued him into their frequency and he'd been working with the sergeant in charge of the evacuation.
Xander mock growled weakly tried to buck the vamp off him and only succeeded his rubbing his ass into the other man’s crotch. The hands at his waist held him still. Spike’s breath was hot against his neck as he pressed his obvious erection into the cleft of Xander’s ass cheeks.
Stiles chuckled at the memory, baring his teeth in the mockery of a smile. It's not like he hated the woman. Wait, hold up. He actually did hate the woman. It was her actions or lack thereof that had led directly to his life circumstances and if it wasn't for his father's sake and the sake of his small but viciously loyal pack, he'd sink his teeth into her soft belly and rip out her hot and steaming insides.
It was the Iron King’s job to make sure that something like this didn’t happen in the first place. And… he had failed. Cold rage burned through his veins and he felt his armored fists clench. Anthony took a deep breath, forcing the emotion down deep. The Iron King was not ruled by his emotions. The Iron King did not feel.
"You know I have to do this for my dad." Stiles huffed softly, turning down the next corridor. "He did it for my mom and I need them to be together Scotty, no matter the risk."
“The King is dead.” He said clearly, surprising almost everyone in the room. “Long live the Iron King, Divine Hand of Sol.”
To hear that Naruto may be coming back to the village made a warm hope balloon in his chest and he twisted against his lover's side to stare up a the fluffy white clouds. The sky was as blue as Naruto's eyes and he could just picture the blond smiling widely at him.
He had a tray of snacks at the ready and reached over to grab his laptop, setting up one of those crackling fireplace background noise tracks wired to the speakers in his room. Rodney had set it up for him, allowing him to immerse himself in some of the beautiful and haunting earth music that reminded him of home.
She gave him a flat look, glancing at the prisoner before turning back to her brother. They seemed to have some kind of silent conversation before she scoffed and rolled her eyes.
He watched them walk out and slumped back in his chair, closing his eyes to everything for one peaceful moment.
A thumb came up to gently wipe away the tear tracks on his face and he let his eyes fall closed. Derek’s kaleidoscope eyes were full of raw emotion when they met his and in that moment something changed between them. Something soft and warm and integral had blossomed anew.
Anthony shuddered at the want that strummed in him at hose whispered words. It hit him like a tidal wave and he tried to fight it before it overwhelmed and drowned him.
Ronon's soft smile was somehow incandescent and Rodney's heart twisted with the amount of emotion that the sight of it welled up in him.
Anthony looked up at the man unblinkingly. “We shall all fall before Sol’s merciless wrath. We underestimated you once. We will not do it again. You will flee before the reign of fire from above or you shall be crushed but its might, rebel scum. ”
Maybe it was because he wasn't putting himself between a grouchy Gibbs and them anymore. It was time they grew up and dealt with the 'Second B for Bastard' on their own. Still, despite nothing coming from it work wise, Tony was glad for the opportunity to have met the sweet and smart Dr. Quintero.
Tony hummed and looked out of his picture window at the city skyline beyond. There was so much that he could sat to that, so many smart comments and sarcastic comebacks. But he was so tired of the bullshit. So tired of keeping everything in sight and juggling all these knives and burning torches. Just one mistake. One slip of the hand or concentration and he would be in for a world of pain.
Tony gives him a genuine smile, surprisingly charmed himself by the cheerful doctor with his black rimmed glasses and faint stubble. Lamar, as he was invited to call him, was respectful, intelligent, funny and seemed to move movies as much as he loved bugs.
Eugené stuck her head and shoulders from the window. "It's just a house. We go in, get the shots and get out. No big deal. Right?"
"Take it. Wear it." the captain gestured to the clothing. "I won't have guest freeze to death in my humble home."
Ronon barked a laugh and stepped closer, warming the liquid on his hands before putting it to the man's skin. "Don't mind if I do."
Scott happily obliged, eager to speak at length about the beautiful young woman who had captured his heart.
He'd ended up becoming the Witch of the Woods the summer of his fourteenth year, just before the leaves turned and the wind got cold. The old woman he'd been apprenticed too had disappeared one day into the deep shadows of the old woods and had left him alone.
He cares for his little crooked broom, the staff he cut himself from a strong sapling; the bristles harvested by moon light and re-twisted every day. He rubbed it with flax oil and tightened the weave of the bindings every fortnight.
When John had heard about Ronon's sweet set up, he'd bugged the resident genius to the same for him so that he could enjoy his Jonny Cash in surround sound. Frankly, Ronon thought that Shepard's favourite singer sounded like a frakhorn with its tail cut off.
"How did you even get the map to the forgotten path over the cliffs? I'm sure that the King would have had those destroyed years ago."
Still, he was more than his armor. He was more than a metal suit marked with the gold of Sol’s blessing and red for the life’s blood of the Kings that came before him. He was his vast intellect and his skilled hands. He was the courage in his heart and the determination to finish the task he’d started. He was the Iron King and he still had a duty to his people. Armor or not.
She came to him crying one day. Her marriage had been arranged to a horrid boy with horrid, cruel friends. He took her into the crooked little cottage and sat her down, making her tea as cats crawled into her lap.
Steve found himself flushing red, his cheeks and neck heating as he gently carried Tony across the lab and set him down unto the plush couch. Tony made a small, sweet little sleepy sound and Steve cursed silently in his head. He was a fucking goner.
The last thing he’d ever expected was fucking zombies. Talk about the wrong kind of un-dead. He never thought that he’d prefer the company of vampires. Or that they would be so awesome at zombie killing.
Potter ranted and raged while Black glared darkly from under a pitch black fringe. The village elders wouldn't allow either boy to bring harm to the Witch of the Wood but the duo proved clever and made his life miserable in other ways.
He opened the door carefully, hearing the harsh ragged breaths and seeing the trembling shoulders. Panic attack, or close to it. Erik got him out to the road, sitting next to him as he slowly calmed. The sun was just cresting the buildings, turning the city skyline gold. The street was peaceful and quiet as they sat together.
A sob tore its way from his throat and he curled on himself over the rail. His hands were covered in dark smears and bleeding from time cuts where he'd all but dragged the last of the heavy sleighs to the edge of the water. He knew that his face looked the same, his white blond hair dark with sweat and slicked to his skull.
“He gave the general an order.” She spun to face him, her hand flung towards Anthony. “HE gave the first general of Rex Solaris an order. The only person who can do that is….”
The room erupted around him, some calling for his death, others crying out in fear. Anthony stood calmly in the middle of the chaos, his eyes never leaving the equally still captain. His eye eyes swirled with emotion as he stared back, his beautiful mouth turned down in a frown.
He was young, younger that Aaron had expected, with brown hair slicked back and curling around his shoulders. The dove grey and bone cream bespoke suit spoke to his expertise in his draft; his matching shoes and understated jewelry spoke to his good taste.
The passenger seat was empty, it's door hanging open; the tread of unsteady footsteps leading around and around until heading deeper into the woods. As if the person had been wandering around in the mist and never found their way. They never found Candy's body.
There were three up front, two men and a woman. Some kind of honour guard to the rebel leader. The taller man was a brunet, built big and broad just like the captain was. The smaller man was a dirty blonde, stocky and compact. He had some sort of strung weapon slung across his back and an actual quiver of arrows.
Where was the man who appreciated his unconventional thinking. Where was the man who'd read them all the riot act about following every lead and not letting anything slip through the cracks.
"So, this is just like the beginning of every creepy horror flick ever." He deadpanned, taking in the dried and shriveled vines that seemed to choke the massive gate, giving only peeks at the silhouette of the gargantuan house beyond. "It’s the fucking house from The Haunting. You brought us to fucking Hill House, Candace."
Stiles scowled at his phone. He couldn't believe that Scott had bailed on him… again. He'd been planning this for months, scraping together the costumes, props and courage to even pull off this epic Halloween.
Ronon tipped his head up and kissed him deeply, catching those blue eyes with his so that the genius would know who serious he was.
Stiles' sharp laugh came out like a yip, his eyes crinkling at the corners at the memory of the Hale pups coming returning to school, their tails between their legs at all the looks and whispers. Cora had been almost feral at the sight of him leaning against his locker, a wide and wicked grin on his face.
These dark dwellers would get nothing from him. Only a fiery death when Rhodes brought an unstoppable wave of Legion to either bring him home or avenge his death. Either way, he would tell the rebels nothing. He would give them nothing. He would not be a weakness to the safety of the citadel.
He ends up following the redhead out of the large room, looking back just once to catch a glimpse of the blond over the shoulders of the other two rebels. He was standing there, watching them leave with the strangest look on his face.
They’d stopped for the night at a local strip mall, sneaking into one of the only stores with the metal security door rolled down and still intact. They’d learned pretty quickly not to make any noise if they could help it.
It wasn't a question or a request. Still, Spencer wasn’t going to acquiesce so easily. Not even to a Dom who could have him swimming with cement shoes within the hour.
Maybe he'd settle on earth one day. Maybe he'd go to mars or beyond. Maybe he'd be one of those men who lived and died in the open blackness, not tethered to anything but his ship and his wanderlust.
Teyla shared a confused look with Ronon then turned back to her friend and team mate. "Skin…. Cancer?"
There were five in the crew, four diggers and one driver in the cab of the vehicle. He went for the driver first, catching the man as he stepped out to relieve himself. The man was snatched up and put in a sleeper hold until he blacked out, his wrists and feet secured quickly by the legionnaire. The inside of the truck was just as fascinating, Anthony’s mind racing as he explored. It used some kind of carbon based energy which fascinated him to no end.
Dizzy was one of the best characters in Starship Troopers and should not have died. i've watched this scene a few times and think that i've done a okay job in giving an alternative.
Tony swallowed down his hurt, shunting aside his wounded pride for later. This wasn't the first time that Gibbs had dressed him down in public, but it was the first time where bearing the brunt of his boss' anger felt like a punishment, not a choice.
“Hey, don’t be sad. Think of it this way. You’re blind as a bat and I have a face made for radio. We’re practically a match made in heaven.”
But the man was also a rebel, an enemy of all Anthony had even held dear. A threat to all that he’d dedicated his life to protecting.  How could he join with him? How could he stand by his side through life, never knowing the Sol’s warmth or kiss ever again? How could he live in knowing that Rhodes and the new Iron King would be mounting a war against the shadow lands sooner or later, intending to break their ranks and drive them back into the waste lands?
Anthony swallowed heavily, eyes glues to the android head as the captain manipulated the tech and placed it on the table. The head beeped and clicked in a sound that he recognized as it connecting to the hive mind. Oh Sol, they’d managed to boost the signal over the high mountains. His heart leapt in his chest. If they accessed the hive… no… there were protocols in place for that. The unit would have been listed as missing, presumed destroyed. Its ID serial would be flagged as compromised.
Beautiful display boxes were interspersed with thick reference books and science magazines. Movie cases were stuffed on shelves with geeky knick knacks and hand woven and comfortable looking afghans were tossed along with colourful knitted pillows and a thick and decadent woven rug.
She gave him a shove to shut him up. "Johnny Rico. It's fine. You were out fighting a war. I didn't need you moping around while I picked myself up. I would have clocked you a good one if you'd shown up at my door with that hang dog expression."
He hurried forward, checking for the driver's safety. T'Challa kept the car for sentimental purposes, letting Erik check it every so often to keep it in working order.
Virginia would dress all in white with the rest of the maids, the councilors, the senators and they would make the slow procession down to the hall of kings where an empty tomb would be carved with his name.  He knew that Rhodes would mourn him, that Virginia and even Happy would cry a tear for his loss. The rest of the kingdom, they would be rejoice that there was a new Iron King stepping up to protect them. To be the divine hand of a merciful Sol.
He turned to Rossi. "Arrange to have his studio set up in the north wing. Bring whatever he needs from his studio. Any fitting sessions will be approved by me. If I'm not available, Garcia can be my stand in."
Alas, the life of an Iron King was one of service. He’d been chosen as a child to take up the mantle and he would carry that weight on his shoulders until he died. There was no other life fated for him. He lived entirely for the Citadel and for the safe keeping of its beloved peoples.
"Stiles…" a soft voice came from the back of the wolves, Scott stumbling his way forward as if he'd been given a hard shove. "What if your dad was one of the lives in danger? How would you feel if something were to happen to him?"
He was able  to find some metal wiring that he was able to rip from one of the larger structures, a jagged piece of  transparent flex steel that took him two days to carefully extract from its window casing and a shockingly intact gold music box with mother of pearl dragon inlay. It was still working when he brought it a board, the music a bit warped, but a little tinkering and cleaning had it working perfectly.
“Thought I’d scratch this off my bucket list while I still could. Didn’t want to die without finding out what the big secret Victoria’s been keeping from us all.”
He looked out unto the city once more, the view of which still took his breath away. Beyond the city and far away, a thin dark line crept along the horizon, stretching from east to west. Tony’s sharp eyes followed the line and felt a twinge in his soul mark.
He trusted Steve to hold him, love him, protect him when he was like this; setting aside his doubts and skepticism and exposing his poor, scarred heart.
"And how did you get her to give you the map to the pass? You didn't have sex with her too did you?"
Resting his aching skull on the small pillow, he realized that this bed was also infinitely more comfortable than the cot he’d slept on the night before. The room was lit blue, silhouetting the broad shoulders and back of the captain as he worked on something at a large work table. Anthony sat up gingerly, tucking his socked feet into his loaned boots. He stared at the other man for a long moment.
Bruce used the absence of fashion like a shield, his entire wardrobe was interchangeable and completely disposable. The Hulk made having any sense of fashion moot anyway.
Steve liked clothes well enough. He knew what fashion was and what power it could hold and wield. The cut of a man’s trousers, the fit of his jacket across the shoulders. How those subtle little things influenced those around him, their perception of his status, his intelligence, his power.
"They actually shot most of that movie in Harlaxton Manor in England" The dish water blond rolled her eyes and said snootily, annoyed at being called by her full name. "That's a whole ocean away. Besides, people survived that. Catherine Zeta Jones and that older guy. The one from Taken."
"Do you need assistance coming out of the cupboard?" a sultry voice purred in his ear and he jumped, almost dropping both. Ziva snickered as he glared at her, pulling back to stand up straight, the large brown evidence bag in her gloved hands clashing against her bulky, blue NCIS jacket.  "I'm sure all your numerous one night stands will be disappointed to find out that you swim for the other team."
They observed the crew for a while before creeping closer. His intent was to hijack the vehicle, take the crew hostage and make them take him to rebel command. He’d be lost for too long in this wilderness if he tried to find their base on foot and the dark terrain had proven extremely dangerous to traverse.
“Why would you do that? How would you even do that?” Steve found himself gaping even harder. “Why would you help us?”
Rodney wasn't ready for that, maybe he never would be. Ronon would never push. Bringing new life to Pegasus was a hard decision, one to be made by the bearer in the end. But if they did had children, born to them both and raised on Atlantis with Rodney's brains and Ronon's strength; he knew in his heart of hearts that they would be survivors.
The Iron Kings of old had paved the brutal way for peace, protecting the Sunlight Kingdom from enemies lurking in the deep shadows of the Umbra, razing their ranks with the unrelenting and merciless gaze of Sol.
In fact most of the demonic underworld found the shambling corpses a right tasty snack. “Aged like fine wine”, one skorlack demon had joked one night, its jagged teeth glistening with blood and ichor under the harsh streetlight; “always on tap and with free delivery too.”
"The movie yes, but the book's ending was ambiguous at best." Ewan scoffed softly, getting an elbow in the arm from Eugené. He shrank back from her sharp appendage. "I'm just saying that this is an incredibly bad idea. Every single horror movie starts on this kind of premise."
He tucked that book away and plucked another book of swatches, flipping it open to the other side of the spectrum. "For your submissive, supple leather for strength, lace trim for to show a hint of skin. Silk embroidered to match the symbol of your family crest. Imported handmade ribbon lacing the back with suitable placed straps and cut outs in the trousers to give the illusion of being bound."
Without thinking twice about it, he turned further into Derek’s embrace and tucked his face into the werewolf’s neck; a soft whine escaping his throat.  Arms tightened around him, holding him steady as he shook, his mind still reeling by what he’d just witnessed. When he finally pushed away, the arms loosened but still held him, Derek’s skin warm and comforting through the thin material of his t-shirt.
Removal of their masks revealed three men and a woman, all middle aged with faces extremely pale and smeared with soot. They all remained tight lipped in the face of his questions so he gagged them and set the Legionnaire on sentry mode.
Derek barked a harsh laugh, his eyes narrowing as he threw a flat glare in Stiles' general direction.
The ride was a short one, her back aching from the laid back slump she'd been forced to mimic. She'd passed through enough of the town for the car to be seen, recognized and remembered so she made her way to her final destination.
Setting down his case, he went down on one knee and looked up at the Dom's permission to open it. At the man's nod, he snapped the clamps open and laid it flat on the rug. Inside were swatches of material as well as other tailoring accouterments.
Derek started to purr, something that always calmed Stiles when he was getting himself worked up. He hated to call it purring but there wasn't really any other word for it.
When he finally went to bed that night, the lamp beside his bed clicked off before he could even reach for it. He blinked at it for a moment then said a soft 'thank you' into the darkness of the room, falling asleep with a small smile on his face.
Kiba groaned at the tastes of ki rich blood across his tongue, growing hard in his pants as he sucked on the blond's kiss swollen bottom lip. A splash of freezing cold water had them shrieking and jumping apart to see Hana with her hands still in a water seal.
The sheriff told Ewan that he should be thankful. That it was a freak accident. That he was the lucky one.
The captain’s smile was bright and happy as he repeated the name like it was a precious thing. His blue eyes were warm and full of awe.
Despite his usual level of annoyance with the bleach blond vampire, Xander had considered himself lucky that Spike had been along for the trip when things had gone pear shaped. The demon had sniffed out the situation early and had the secured resources that kept them safe and defended while most of the rest of humanity ran around in blind panic.
Tony looked towards the voice and saw a charcoal grey coat being handed to him. His eyes traveled up the arm to meet Dwayne 'King' Pride's concerned gaze.
John had looked offended when he'd told him so, frowning as Teyla choked on her juice. Thankfully, he didn't know exactly was a frakhorn was and why getting its tail cut off was so hilarious but he'd been distracted by Rodney thumping his tray down on the table, snagging all their attention with some crazy close call he'd just skillfully diverted. Teyla had traded a catty look with Ronon and he gave her a quick grin. No one would ever explain it to Shepard if they could help it.
The door slammed closed with a finality that had Anthony breathing once again.  He let the silence settle fully once again before moving, padding over to the bucket and tray and kneeling before them. The bucket was filled with hot water, steam rising from the clear liquid.
"Told you it would be worth the walk." He brushed his shoulder against the other man's, leaning in low to speak against the shell of his ear. Rodney nodded slowly, his eyes wandering up to the twin suns that hung high in the sky.
Trust the zombie apocalypse to occur when Xander was clear across the United States of America. As far from Sunnydale as he could have possibly been without crossing the Atlantic. In fact, he hadn’t even expected anything like this.
He’s shaken awake roughly and comes up with a fist which was caught deftly by the tall brunette. His grip felt like a vice and Anthony catches a glimpse of a metallic hand. He stared, fascinated only to snarl as the grip tightened almost painfully the let go. He cradled it to his body, glaring hotly up at his jailor.
He glanced up at the night sky once more. If he squinted He could just make out the light trail of the ship as it made the jump into hyperspace. Or maybe it was just his imagination. He gave an irreverent salute to the fading trail, smirking as he turned towards the lights of the settlement in the distance.
"We had to show you how serious this is." the other man grunted. "We don't have time for your usual drama queen hysterics."
It hadn't been a successful one, the Forge’s fortified defenses hardly affected by the attack but the fact that the frequency of incursions from the penumbra had increased incrementally was very worrying.
His father had been a carpenter and his mother a seamstress, both taken too soon by influenza; leaving him alone and without prospects. No one had wanted the lanky, sallow faced boy with long stringy black hair which hung about his pointy chinned face.
He said nothing else as he’d always been a man of few words. Anthony appreciated his forthrightness, fed up of court simpering and political machinations. Rhodes was honest, honourable and most importantly, loyal to the Iron King. He was also the closest thing to a friend that Anthony had ever known.
Somehow, most of the other pilots would drift through or show up sometime within the week and Duo would spend time touching base and catching up with longtime friends. He would always head back up to space rejuvenated after those visits, happy in the knowledge that they were all getting along with their lives after the war.
Stiles leaned his face into the touch, letting the other man gently explore the road map of pain the last five years had been. Derek’s touch was reverent as he felt along Stiles’ lips and the old ragged scar that cut through them.
It was looking to be a cluster fuck and Tony was grateful that the FBI would most likely be taking the case as a whole. He was ready to just hand everything over, fuck Gibbs and his jurisdiction hording, and let someone not him wade through the thigh high sludge that this case would surely reveal in weeks and months to come. He already had enough nightmare fuel to last him a lifetime.
Rodney knew the moment the water started trickling in, that they were in serious trouble. He'd been in this kind of situation before. Trapped under water in a container that proved to be less than perfectly water proof. He'd been of the opinion that being trapped in a damaged puddle jumper at the bottom of the ocean had been the worst situation but this one was steadily proving him wrong.
He showered and washed his clothes like clockwork, the repetition of daily chores giving his racing mind a reprieve with their familiarity. Slowly, he bought little things to add to the space. Some cartoon letter fridge magnets to hold his grocery lists and pictures sent from home by post. Some better pillows for his neck when he passed out on the huge but hideously comfortable flowered atrocity of a couch. Some black out curtains so that he could crouch over his computer in the dark like some kind of goblin in his cave.
Ronon grunted, as nodding made his head pound. He glanced over at his mate once more. "He really ok? He doesn't do well in water like that."
Finally, fed up with his stoic silence yet seemingly reluctant to harm him physically; they took him to an empty room and closed the door behind him.
Tony heard someone sobbing softly, only realizing after a while that the person was him. Steve's blue eyes were still concerned but Tony kissed him hungrily to assuage his fears.
Now he was laid in a hospital bed, fighting to get better all because some high school bully decided that he was just too flamboyantly gay to be allowed. Flash may not have thrown a punch or a kick himself but he'd encouraged others to act against her brother in all but blood.
"Yes, Elizabeth has said as much. " Teyla gave him a thoughtful nod and squeezed his hand once more. "I look forward to the day you are sealed as one with your fated other half ."
Xander was painfully hard, pre-cum soaking the front of the panties as his cock head peeked out from the thin elastic waist band. He relaxed into spike’s embrace, tilting his head to one side as a silent surrender.
The Forge at North Pass burned, belching massive columns of black smoke into the ever blue skies. Raging hot flames flickered within the black cloud as cascading explosions slung burning debris and ash far out unto the fields of green below. The fire roared like a beast, licks of the almost white flame reaching up hungrily to where Anthony hovered, several of the Iron legion in formation around him like an honour guard.
He shivered violently, both from the bone deep cold of the place and from the doubt that wanted to rise up and clog his throat. The captain blinked at him and tilted his head.
The shiny black Lincoln town car was parked where it always was, parked in front of the Lucky Strike Car and Casino. She watched it for a while from two blocks away, checking the walking traffic on the empty side street and slumping down when a police car when by.
It was Thor’s good concert suit and Loki would kill them both in their sleep if he found out that his brother had lent it to Steve for the night. But desperate times called for desperate measures and Steve was definitely fucking desperate.
There was a mug of steaming coffee for him at the kitchen counter and he hummed appreciatively at the taste.
With all of this going on, Ronon had been left to his own devices. He helped the goons with their grunt work, schlepped stocks and stores with the Athosians. He'd brought coffee to the geeks, especially Rodney who he secured the best snacks and extra MREs for and coaxed him to eat and sleep as the genius worked himself into the ground.
When Tony met Erik, he'd been driving through the pre-dawn deserted streets Oakland, sobbing as he sang along loudly and off key  to Patsy Kline's Crazy. He'd started off with Lizzo's Truth Hurts but somehow his playlist had skipped and Patsy's crooning filled the car.
It was a bit of an inconvenience yes, but Wufei had grown up with worse. Having known and lived next to his betrothed Wen Lao Meiran since he was three, he knew how to ignore a pesky nuisance underfoot. He wasn't giving up this apartment for anything, ghost or not.
"Solo's at peace." Wufei fumbled with the sudden latin. "Uh, ok. Duo. I'm Chang Wufei. Um, pleased to meet you."
The woman moved with the deadly grace of one of the Sun Lotus courtesans, no doubt there were at least a dozen small and maybe even poisoned blades secreted about her body. A curl of vibrant red hair had escaped from her rough wool skull cap and hung tucked behind her ear.
Ewan spent the night fretting over his missing friends; heading out early with the Police to trace their journey back to the house. Yes, he was sure that they wouldn't have left him behind. No, they were not the kind to pull pranks like this. Yes, he'd tried their phones over and over but had gotten no answer.
Steve though, was a man of simple tastes.  Quality over quantity was his motto when it came to building his wardrobe. He liked to choose well-made pieces, more expensive than others but made to last.
She slowed to a walk, keeping her cap low and imitating a swagger as she made her way to the sixth house. The doorbell was loud and jarring but she kept her finger on it until it slammed open, a cloud of marijuana smoke billowing out in a giant plume.
According to google maps, the route back to the first house cut through the warehouse district and across the large dry canal. She'd timed it before, running a similar length on the school track and around the neighbourhood a few times to build stamina.
He scratched absently at his red triangular cheek mark, nodding at another clan member as they sped by. The street was all but deserted, leading deeper into the woods that Kohonagakure was famous for. Amakamaru turned and wuffed softly before he slipped into the tree line, disappearing from view. Kiba didn't rush to follow, knowing full well where his partner was going.
The blond took a step in, closing the door quietly behind him. “I think that I can understand why you didn’t say when we first met. We were sworn enemies.”
The man was ruthless, smart and somehow able to inspire unwavering loyalty in his people. He was by no means the biggest crime boss in Chicago but he held unto his mid-level portion of shy-town with an iron fist.
The Nara propped his head on one hand and shook it.  "We'll get stuck together if we stay like this. Troublesome."
He glared back at her, hunched into the seat with his arms crossed tightly over his chest. He wasn't one for confrontation but Candy was being especially bitchy for the whole trip. In fact, she'd all but brow beat them all into spending their long weekend making this god forsaken trip instead of going down to the lake for some sun, sea and sand.
Derek smiled. It was soft. Stiles liked how it looked on him. Derek looked good, comfortable. So different from the haunted, wounded and broken down boy who’d left Beacon Hills, shaking and bloody in the back seat of his sister’s speeding car.
He blinked rapidly, suddenly remembering where he was and who he was with. He glanced at the wide eyed brunet and flushed hotly.
Talia took a deep breath, as if silently praying for patience. Stiles liked to see that expression on her usually smarmy face.
Since then Kiba had ached with a phantom pain and always stopped by the little house to cuddle up with something of the blond's, desperate for that familiar scent. The small parcel of land abutted the Nara property so Shika kept the garden neat and saw that the house was kept in order. It was not odd to see Nara deer leaning over the little fence to munch on the flowers that Ino had helped plant.
Jake made a helpless gesture towards him, his reddish brown hair flopping unto his face. "I can't believe you Obi-Wan. Come on, get back in the car."
He arranged them in his closet just so, shrugging when Tony teased him about being a bit anal about it. It wasn’t just his time in the military that drove his need for neatness and order, he’d always been like that; even as a child.
He banished such thoughts and they came to the large clearing, their eyes taking in the contingent of Hales gathered at the far side. Stiles pulled up his ski mask to the bridge of his nose, the  sharp white of the snarling fox fangs glinting in the fading light of the setting sun. beside him both Heather and Danny were doing the same, their gold eyes peering out over snarling maws just as his was glowing red.
Rhodes would stay behind in the Sunlight Kingdom, sworn protector of the citadel in Anthony’s stead; just in case the enemy sought to attack at a time of perceived weakness. The General had eventually nodded, grasping Anthony on the forearm and bringing their foreheads together.
Rodney had been one of the firs to suss him out, after Teyla of course. He'd waited until Ronon was balls deep inside of him and half way to losing his mind in pleasure before going in for the kill.
Tony's good mood lasted for days, thinking almost constantly about that almost kiss and sharing texts and funny pictures with the man who bestowed it upon him. Neither Ziva's and Tim's teasing nor Gibbs disdain over Tony's apparent personal joy could put a dent into his attitude. He invited Lamar over for a home cooked meal, playing the piano for him after as they drank wine and talked about insects.
The mission to Whiskey Outpost on Planet P had been a cluster fuck, literally. The place had been crawling with bugs. They'd barely gotten away, after losing both the General they'd been sent to rescue and Lt. Rasczak, the surviving soldiers racing to the shuttle that had come to retrieve them.
A twig snapped somewhere behind him and he tensed for a second, only to relax completely when a soft greeting was carried on the wind. Derek stood to the side of the jeep, hands in the pockets of his ever present leather jacket and eyes glowing red in the darkness. The mouth was turned down into an adorable frown and Stiles chuckled at the sight, patting the empty patch of hood next to him.
The next weeks wouldn't be easy, even with the tendency for people to jump to the next scandal. News involving Tony Stark always had staying power amongst the masses and this one had a lot of meat to rip into.
She slipped out of the house and into the garage, thumbing the door opener as she slid into his convertible and raised the roof. The windows were tinted dark and she grabbed his shades from the sun visor and slipped them one.
Stiles made a face at that, confused by the sharp lancing pain in his chest. He felt his eyes begin to sting and quickly blinked them away. His next breath was a bit ragged and watery but he kept breathing steadily until it passed. There was nothing he could think of to say.
The lights were brighter here, a harsh white that made him wince after so much darkness. He was surprised at the brilliance, his heart finally calming as he stepped closer to the huge lamps that hung over head.
Usually, Tony would have bristled at the kid glove treatment but considering he'd been chasing down his suspect from DC to LA then down to New Orleans only  to have the lone killer turn out to be a group of insane and brutal zealots with a penchant for knife play. The photos of previous victims flashed through his eyes, interspersed with glimpses of the bodies that had been kept like trophies in the warehouse they'd just raided.
The werewolf gave a put upon sigh. “I’m saying that the character has a lot more in common with you than you realized.”
"Like you even answer any of her calls El Rey." Heather, his second in command and beta fox scoffed as she kept pace with him through the woods. "Remember that time you rerouted all calls from her number to the local dog pound? I swear her catty bitch of a daughter Laura wanted to scratch your pretty brown eyes out for a month after."
Spike went into game face and grinned wildly as he reached down to cup Xander though the soaked satin panties, biting down into the flesh of his neck as Xander came from the pleasure of it.
Ewan shook his head, "Wrong. There's something not right I tell you. This place is creepy as fuck and shrouded in an unholy mist. When has that ever boded well for a group of young, albeit alright looking twenty somethings?"
Steve gave off heat like a furness and he rubbed his cheek against that broad chest, inhaling deeply in that comforting smell of soap and shield oil and musk. His hand lay on Steve’s peck and his fingers started to twist the rings again, turning them over as the arc blue diamond disappeared and reappeared against the silver of the vibranium bands.
The linguists and translators were redirected to translate everything they could on the storm while the rest of the science division prepared the city for a complete lock down.
And if they didn't and came knocking on his door, looking to disturb his lover's well deserved rest before his 24 hours  were over? Well, he'd make sure that they understood just how stupid of an idea that was.
Apparently the blond seemed to understand him well enough because as he nodded soberly, gaze flitting between the brunet and the dissected droid. Anthony held his gaze, standing tall and unwavering as he faced against the rebel leader in a silent battle of wills.
Eventually, the young man looked up at him, all wide eyed and vulnerable and something in his chest twisted at the sight. He was beautiful, with big brown eyes and flushed, creamy skin.
"That's great, buddy." Stiles nodded contemplatively. "I trust the princess and her way too serious father more than that bag of cats grand pappy of hers."
He wasn't sure how long they stood there, neither one willing to look away first. The tense moment was finally broken when the Doctor knocked over one of the droid's hands and it fell off the table in a loud clatter.
"No No No No No, baby come on, no." he pleaded with the car, pressing on the gas as the car slowed and a bunch warning lights started popping up on the dash.
The crooked jawed wolf had abandoned the plan they'd meticulously gone over several times before leaving the loft, concentrating too much on Allison and not enough on his own part.
Derek was already on the rough wooden porch, mug in hand, when Stiles slowly rolled his heavy bike up the loose gravel drive. There were differences he noted first, the grown in man beard to go with the lumberjack chic, worn denim and plaid. The lack of leather and that permanent frown.
Shit. Okay. He was an intelligent young man. He came from a long line of strong, brave and clever Chinese ancestors. He was a son of the great house of Chang. He could handle a ghost.
"I'm still not seeing anything on the map." Rodney whined as he walked, head down as he studied the small ancient device in his hands.
Steve’s grin was a bit watery as he tried to find some anchor in this whirlwind of emotions. He felt dizzy with hope and joy.
She sat on her bed, naked and damp from the shower, knee pulled up as she carefully painted her nails. The polish was borrowed, a holo silver aptly named unicorn blood and it gleamed as she wiggled her toes.
Draco looked up, marveling at the sunbeams as they shone through the leaves and his heart stopped in his chest. Near the canopy top, wings unfurled to a span of almost forty feet and blazing the colour of fire, sat a Semioptila fulveolans Mabille.
“Ha ha funny ha, joke wolf.” Stiles snorted and hopped up unto the wooden bar stool, hooking his feet on the bars. “Still, thanks.”
"Holy shit. Flores!" Ace Levy blurted loudly, echoing through the hanger. "What the fuck are you doing here? I thought to died or something."
They hatched a plan to get her away from her awful fate, recruiting the help of a young werewolf boy named Remus to spirit Lily away to the north, through the deepest woods and into the kingdom of Nimue where she could be welcomed and cared for. They bade each other a tearful goodbye and he watched them disappear into the trees.
She took his hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze. "All he cared about was getting you to safety. He's been at you bedside every free minute his has. Carson eventually had to give him a bed in here so that he would sleep."
When she was done and ready for deployment, she'd been given a choice of station. There's been no hesitation then either.
Dudley greeted them at the door, wiping his hands on a dishtowel as his wife cleared the table behind him. "We don't stay up at the house at night. Never after dark. We always leave before dark."
They started spending more time together after that, carving out of what little free time the had. Shika and Kiba helped Naru find and move into a better place, a little house out in the woods where they could have privacy. The cottage was cute and quaint and Naruto had gone a bit gooey when he'd come home to see most of his friends at the surprise house warming party they'd thrown him.
He twisted in the full length mirror, running an appraising hand over his ass cheeks, a fine tremor running through him at the feeling. He bit his lip, adjusting the tuck of his chubb in the lacy front. Fuck it felt so good.
They made their way across the rocky landscape carefully with goggles that he’d jury-rigged from the optics of one of the fallen legion. They were crude and did not fit well on his head but they allowed him to see well enough in the dark. The way was treacherous and slow, deep ravines and sharp cliffs appearing out of nowhere to claim their lives.
Rossi's hands were warm and calloused, taking Spencer's pale one within both of his. As he leaned forward, Spence could make out the dark gleam of a shoulder holster. He did not let his surprise show though. He'd done his research when the call had first come in.
Potter and he were the last of their class to find a bond and there had been talk within the halls of the keep and in the town. Now that Potter had gone and found himself a Dragon, Draco was now the only one from his class left. Most of the other hopefuls were at least two years younger than him and it made him stand out.
"Thank you." he murmured as Dwayne sat next to him on the piano bench. For getting him out of the rain. For welcoming him to his home so that he wouldn't be alone. For taking care of Tony in a way few others did or would. "for everything."
The resulting explosion would sure decimate the underground facility they were standing in, funneling heat and flame outwards through the man-made tunnels.
There was nothing left of L5 now by a graveyard. A long line of space junk from when they blew themselves up rather than kowtow to Romefeller and Oz. Most of the valuable metals and parts had already been picked clean by other scavengers, even though the new earth  government had forbid it. Duo usually made a pass once or twice a year, just to see what he could scrape together.
With his work done and Spike gone for the next couple of hours, he wandered out unto the main store and browsed along the aisles. He wasn’t a stranger to women’s lingerie stores. He’d been best friends with some BAMF women and they had no qualms dragging him along for company when they went shopping.
His father had been one of the last to make the trip though the Steep Pass to bring her glowing heart stone to where it would glow forever. If the heart stone was not freed by fire and it's glow allowed to slowly die within the body; the heart song would be lost forever.
If he booked it he would make it in time for a late supper. Maybe a little mulled wine for after. Maybe a little something more.
Erik nodded as he finished joining the last wire on the circuit. "Yeah, thanks for looking at it for me. The guy who usually troubleshoots it charges me an arm and a leg every time. Turns out having a gorgeous partner with a genius IQ and a masters in engineering is a blessing to the overhead on this place."
“Looks like It’s your lucky day Richard B Riddick. Class F Bounty. Wanted Dead or Alive. Thirty million credits. Ten million credit bonus if brought in dead.” The husky voice whistled then chuckled. “A very lucky day.”
Rhodes hadn’t been at all  happy with the plan but Anthony had been adamant. He would track the culprits right back to their dark hovels and rain Sol’s wrath down on them. With two whole garrisons of Legion at his command, the sky would be filled with light and flame.
"Why would she even do that?" Kiba perked his head up to look at his lover. They hadn't been able to spend more than a night of down times together for more than six months, their lives were so hectic. "Wait… you don't think?"
“People like us. We don’t often get a chance to cross paths. Not without violence that is. We’ve got war in our blood and always will. We were born fighting and will probably meet our end that way too.”
She hid a small smile behind her hair, taking comfort in Aunt may's and Ned's voices as they talked beside her. Oh to be a fly on the wall when Flash came back into town, horny as hell, pissed at being stood up and rearing for a fight. He was sure to get much more than he bargained for.
He scoffed and commanded it to be silent. It was too bloody cold for that now. He wouldn’t sleep deeply anyway, this deep in the enemy strong hold. He was so tired. All he wanted was light and warmth. He needed the small semblance of peace it provided. He’d been so long away from Sol’s blessed gaze, it was maddening. He craved the light. He craved the gold painted citadel. He craved the warmth along his shoulders, the beads of sweat that curled his hair and pooled at his collar. He missed Sol’s kiss on his cheeks and forehead.
There had been the excitement when his cousin Luna had been chosen by her name sake, the youngest and smallest of them bonding with the ethereal sea green flyer with a wingspan one and a half of any other steed  within the eclipse.
He chuckled as the bond between them bloomed fully as he lay a gentle hand on the fur covered head, pouring all the adoration and love he felt into the bond and getting the same in return.
“Why isn’t it allowed? Tell me.” The blonde growled, reaching up to grasp the brunet’s arms. “Tell me why we can’t be together. We’re soul mated. Soul fated.”
He watched coldly as they stripped the Legionnaire of its battery pack and shot it with one of the strange weapons that emitted the blue light. He would not show these penumbra scum emotions. He would not be weak before the enemy. They then turned to him, guns trained on his head and chest, before stripping him of his stolen cloak and all of his tech; leaving him in only the under suit.
Seeing his father thoroughly distracted by his mother, Draco shot her a grateful look and quietly excused himself as soon as he was able, slipping away to grab his gear and head down to the Choosing Ceremony.
"No problem" Rodney's voice was a bit breathy and low and he cleared his throat as he stepped away. The genius then turned around, handing him the pack over his shoulder. "Do me."
"Please don’t tell me that this is one of your stupid movies plots." The silver haired man rolled his eyes. "You think that shit is so clever but  all you do is waste our time. Do your job and follow the leads that actually go somewhere."
"I suppose you've heard every kind of Bug Doctor joke there is by now." Tony asked, leaning a hip against a nearby table as the scientist studied the shell remains under a microscope. The Doc grinned back at his over his shoulder, his dark curly hair flopping over his forehead; his mocca skin dimpling at the cheeks.
The cut on his face was still bleeding from where he’d taken a gun butt to the head and was dripping blood down his hair line and into the neck of his suit. They asked many questions, gesturing to his tech laid out on a nearby table but he remained silent, his mind racing as his eyes took in everything that he could.
He let out a deep breath. It's frustrating as hell but I can't think of anything else that can knock some sense into him. I love Scotty but a road scholar he isn't."
Tony set the mugs down on the worktable, slipping his arms around Erik's broad shoulders and pressing his lips to the scarred skin.
Xander studied the panties in his hand, absently rubbing the material between his fingertips as he deliberated. The decision was an easy one and soon he was stripping off in the small changing room, his gun slung within easy reach because one could never be too careful in a zombie apocalypse.
Tony gave a sigh and let his head fall unto that shoulder, comforted in the fact that the other man wasn't one to jerk away from the contact. The playing of the piano carried him away and for once in his life, Tony just let go and drifted.
Tony looked almost swallowed by the thing, his smaller lithe frame tucked up into the knitted wool with only the top of his curly head and the tips of his socked feet peeping out.
The older man sat back in his chair, joining his hands across his taut stomach as he appraised the young man before him.   Spencer Reid had come recommended by someone he trusted, someone who done invasive and in depth background and security checks on the man before him before letting him even come near to her treasured sub.
Those blue eyes looked up at him earnestly. "Will you tell me more about it sometime? Only if you want to, of course. I talk so much about earth that I forget that your people had built a unique and complex society of their own."
She'd waited until she'd gone back to the small recovery room she'd been assigned to to cry her eyes out. That was all she gave herself. One night to throw a pity party and be sorry for herself. The next day she'd signed all the relevant paperwork and been scheduled for her first fitting.
Tony had taken him out for drinks after wards, letting the man rant into his beer at the utter lack of professional respect the whole of NCIS had shown. He'd all but growled at Tony that he'd be welcome at the FBI in a hot minute the moment he decided to leave that toxic, orange nightmare. Tony had been flattered at the offer and promised the other agent to seriously give it some thought.
On the back cover she wrote out her list. The plan laid out step by step. She'd memorized it. Knew it top to bottom to top again. Studied it until she could see it when she closed her eyes. Tonight was the night. She was ready. She had it down. It had to be tonight.
With how both Rossi and Prentiss were nodding sagely at the blonde's words, Spencer realized that he was really and truly trapped between a rock and a hard place.
What had really killed him was that none of his so called family seemed to care that his heart had been ripped out and stomped on mercilessly. They had all circled around Bucky, leaving Tony alone and in the cold.
The entire room tensed, spinning to face the sheepish and apologetic man. After a few seconds, they all relaxed, the trio of guards easing their weapons back into their holsters. It seemed to break the spell because the Captain spoke, his voice reverberating through the room.
He also craved Kiba's hands on him, loved the scrape of his teeth and the soothing rough of his tongue as they trailed along the quickly fading red marks. When they were not training or heading out on missions, they spent together in Naruto's shitty apartment or in Kiba's rooms at the compound.
He gave a full body shake, shedding his bad mood off like water, and turned towards his fox kin with a vulpine smile. "Let's go home guys. If we hurry we can still catch Doctor Sexy and eat our pizza before it gets too cold."
“Of course the argument can be made that you’ve seen too much of our base but we’d be packed and out of here by the time you get back to your precious sunlight kingdom. You’ll never find us among the vast system of caves. So that leaves one last problem. What exactly can we get for you?”
People like Steve didn’t fit in a place like this. Hell, he wouldn’t have been able to get a job as one of the smartly dressed and smiling bar staff. He certainly didn’t belong in this shiny, rich, honey-coloured world.
“Those damn rebels.” Rhodes growled at his side, his own armored hand fisted as he smacked it down on the table in frustration.
"I do know of a planet where sharing a plate of fruit jelly constitutes as getting married. They have a conclave shielded by a ZPM and spend all day eating cake and drinking wine."
They doted on the man, worshiping his body until he was aching and near tears from the pleasure. Hands and lips and tongues mapped his body, learning all new spots and re-learning the old ones. He watched with rapt attention as Shika lubed up his long fingers and worked them into Naruto's clenching pink hole; the blond arching into the burn as he was carefully stretched.
They emerged into wonder and Ronon leaned forward to gape at the sight before them. A massive nebula was sprawled around them, swirling and curling clouds of space dust and brilliant colour that took his breath away, spotted with bright stars that look close enough to reach out and touch.
“You think you can handle both? It’ll be you and me ‘till the end. Maybe even beyond that. I won’t let you go I said.”
Pride took him home, passing right by the hotel Tony had been checked into. "You shouldn't be alone tonight."
Thankfully Lydia, Erica and Allison had read him the riot act about his idiotic and chauvinistic actions before Derek had given into his wolf nature and skinned a strip off of Scott's hide for putting Stiles in danger.
He wanted to know exactly what they tried, what procedures, what rituals, what research had been done. He wanted to dig into the problem with his dull nails and tearing it apart. He felt utterly useless, incandescently furious and totally heartbroken.
“The latest attack on the Solar Forge out at Lost Leaf. That’s the tenth one that been hit along the border in as many months. ”
Holding him carefully, Ronon rolled them until he was on his back, Rodney  sitting astride him. Bracing his hands on his mate's hips and making sure that Rodney had his hands steady on Ronon's chest; he started fucking up into his mate steadily, keeping his strokes slow and deep.
She placed a hand on his arm and he looked down to see the gleaming silver fingers. "Hey, I appreciated it. Thank you. It's hard to get the good stuff like that on the moon."
Stiles had thought quickly, yelling quick instructions over the battlefield and had gone to help his brother from another mother.
Finding out that the bubbly, quirky Domme was Terzu Famiglia to Hotchner's Primu, next in command after Rossi's Sicondu, had been an unpleasant surprise. Finding out he'd been summoned before the man known as the Devil of South Shore had been even more of one.
He went on… "with a massive over grown gate secured by huge fucking cow chains and a rusty ass padlock."
This brought him up close and personal with the sleeping genius, the sight of his sleep softened face, thick eyelashes dark against his dusky skin sending Steve’s heart into overdrive, along with other places in his anatomy.
got a bit of my grove back with this one. trying to decide on a fandom was keeping me back so i went with Original Characters. Still, my main OC was heavily inspired by a young Ewan McGregor. Yumm.
"SHEILD doesn't bluff about things like this." Fury gave him a narrow glare before shaking his head in over acted disappointment and pushing himself out of the chair. "You are going to regret this Stark."
"Yeah. It seemed rather insensitive a gift after I sent it though, considering Whiskey Outpost and all but…'
Rodney stilled at those softly spoken words, heart racing as he stared up at his lover's serious brown eyes. Ronon seemed to be waiting for him to respond, a soft wariness in his gaze. Rodney swallowed, utterly moved and deeply touched by the admission.
“Get your ass up here sour wolf,” he ordered with a smirk, “Geez, the entire planet getting a Hail Mary pass isn’t enough to make you crack a smile?”
"Everything can kill you. " Rodney retorted, stripping out of the last of his clothes and folding them neatly on the tree trunk. He gestured as one of the little packages, tearing it open and squeezing out the white liquid inside. "The trick is to avoid being is a vulnerable position. Prevention is better than cure."
They retrieved her camera a hundred yards away, it's flash card full. There were pictures of the old house, the sprawling lawn, along with the frowning Dudleys and several candid shots of the youngsters. Then there was shot after shot of mist, the faint silhouettes of trees barely visible. One of the deputies made the suggestion that Candy had been trying to light her way with the flash of the camera and had done so until the battery had eventually died.
In the end though, John admitted that he didn't feel comfortable having relations with someone under his direct command and since he was the military leader, it narrowed his options greatly. That and the fact that he was something called Demisexual, which meant that he didn't find anyone sexually attractive unless he formed a strong emotional connection.
“The Iron King holy shit.” The tall brunette sagged against one of the other tables. “Great merciful Nyx, we’re fucked.”
Ronon smiled, looking over to where his lover snorted and turned over to his side, hugging the laptop so himself. He turned back to Teyla.
JARVIS let him into the workshop without a word and he glanced around the area before his eyes snagged on a sliver of familiar blue. He tilted his head, stepping closer, curious.
The Witch of the Wood watched the blaze from the trees, the warm strong arms of the werewolf boy, Remus, keeping him steady as his life burned.
It looked so exposed, broken on the cold slab table like that, defenseless against the savagery visited upon it by cold and unfeeling hands. He felt the blood boil in his veins, his temper burning like acid behind his ribcage.
Tony leaned against the railing and looked out unto the city lights. “I’ve spent most of my life making weapons and gear to support our troops in the field. Things designed to wage war. Maybe it’s time I help our brave soldiers after they get home as well.”
Scott almost stumbled, nearly taking them both down. Stiles glared at him but he didn't even notice.
The coffee machine beeped and broke his concentration, pulling his eyes away from the slim figure silhouetted against the endless cloudy skies. He filled his cup then, after some quiet deliberation, took another from the shelf and filled that as well. He wasn’t sure if to add milk or sugar so he left it as black as his own.
Stiles breathed out sharply, his whole body thrumming at the sight. Licking his lips and tasting cherry, he carefully placed the collar around Derek's neck.
Xander looked around to see Spike leaning against the door frame and ran his fingers though his brown curls.
“Anthony.” The word spilled from the brunet’s lips, startling them both. Suddenly everything seemed just a bit clearer and he decided to give his hopeful heart a fighting chance. “My name … is Anthony.”
He didn't even realize that he'd been weeping silently. It was something he'd always ended up doing when Steve took his time, making love to him in that tender way that shook him to his core.
She'd spent hours on the weird side of you tube, hours more in the library, pouring through anatomy books learning how to do what she was going to do next. There were parts of the human body that one could puncture with a bladed weapon so that no damage would be done to the internal organs. One would bleed profusely, of course, and initially show as being severely injured but a full recovery with prompt medical help was assured.
Then good ol' Bucky had come back, a winged and wounded veteran, fresh from the desert with big wide bambi eyes that Steve could never resist. The clincher was that Tony had been the last to know.
He glanced back to the small shrine with its smoking incense and spilled oil. Oil he had been about to light via cotton wick. He made a soft 'ah' of realization.
A screen appeared above the head, projected from its eyes. It was static at first, as the connection completed. He held his breath, preparing for whatever appeared on the screen. Suddenly Rhodes face appeared, large and furious. Anthony forced himself not to react as the dark skinned man’s face went slack with surprise before hardening with rage. Anthony barely listened to the short, sharp conversation between his general and his captor; his eyes never leaving Rhodes’ narrowed gaze.
Anthony’s hands itched to join in, now that the secret of his identity was revealed and he was all but destined to die one way or the other, the bands around his chest had loosened somewhat. He took a deep breath, both to steady himself and to take in the Captain’s scent. He smelled like raw metal, solder and sweat, despite the cold. His pale skin was smooth and looked soft to the touch or too the kiss.
Still, they both were two of the most pure hearted and optimistic people he knew so they probably had more of a chance than others would.
He dove away on the last would, making broad strokes to where Teyla lay floating. Ronon blinked a bit as the scientist's playfulness before growling and diving after him.
Stiles smiled and felt a blush crawl up his cheeks, he reached out and snagged Derek’s hand and brought it up to his smiling face.
"I see that we will not come to an accord with this. I withdraw my petition. The treaty still stands."
He'd scored a couple of ruby red glitter heels, forgoing the silver ones even though they would have been more historically accurate. They were hella cool even though he'd had to practice walking in them for weeks so that he wouldn't break his ankles on the night.
It was a ten minute bus ride to the library and she greeted the Matron with a soft smile. She accepted compliments  on her dress and belated birthday wishes from the staff and turned over her books before heading to the private nook she always made a beeline for.
Kiba blinked in shock and let his head thump back unto Shika's chest, making the other man grunt softly. Naru had been gone for over a year. Close to fifteen months the blond been on the road with the Toad sage, learning and training. Fourteen months, eight days, two hours since the three of them had spent that last night together, kissing farewell as Naruto had to be at the gate waiting for his mentor before the sun even rose.
"Not even if it means saving innocent lives?" she tried for sympathy and motherly compassion. She failed.
He smiled at his mate as the scientist gestured, getting lost in the technical specs of the project. The only real option was to kiss him silent. Rodney moaned into the kiss, hips bucking as this lover's large hands slid down his broad back to grab his ass and squeeze. Ronon pushed the basket aside, quieting Rodney's half-hearted protests for food with kisses that left him breathless.
Spencer's mind raced, taking leave to study Derek's body with a tailor's eye. Already, designs were blossoming in his mind, intricately embroidered satin panels with delicate boning and custom laces following the long lines of his firm body. He then looked back at serious Dom before him, eyes roaming  over him as well.
"Everyone on this god forsaken city can go take a long walk off the shortest pier." The genius mumbled against his mate's chest. "If one more person complains about some unimportant piece of tripe while I'm trying not to let this city sink to the bottom of the fucking ocean, I'm going to beach the city on the mainland and see how they like living on a mudflat."
"Well, the rest of us are going inside so either you going in with us or you're walking back to town."
Just how Spencer had come to meet the man face to face was all Garcia's fault. He'd made her a corset for special presentation with her Sub Emily and the woman had been singing his praises ever since.
They solved the case four days later, which was four days too slow for Gibbs who prowled around like a bear with a hurt paw. Tony kept his head down, a bit disappointed that his evidence hadn't panned out to be anything significant. He hadn't mentioned it again but both Ziva and McGee liked to pick at it from time to time.
He knew every piece of his wardrobe well so when things went missing, he noticed. He frowned at his closet, eyes snagging on the gap in his coats where his Moroshka sweater jacket by VINGIL usually hung.
He felt numb, sitting there in the dark grey of the city, the sun just peaking over the horizon and turning the tops of the buildings pink and orange. His cheeks felt cold and wet, his eyes gritty and dry. He tried to take a breath but it caught in his throat. He tried for another but this one was difficult as well.
He gave a sigh. Whatever. He would go and have a good time. And with his little dog too. He chuckled and set Toto in the basket, taking one last glance at the ears. It really was too bad.
Jake made a face and opened the door, Ewan pushing down the seat and tumbling out  unto the leaf covered ground in his haste. He stood, dusting himself off, not sure exactly what he was doing but sure that it was the right thing to do.
The male before him was known to most as ‘Reaper’. Choppy brown hair, handsome face with a hard body; he was dressed in custom gear and armed to the teeth. His sister and partner, a blond known as the ‘Doc’, was the brains to her brother’s brawn. It wasn’t confirmed whether or not she was a real doctor healer but there were stories he’d heard that made even him wary of her.
He hugged his brother close one last time and kissed him on both cheeks and his forehead. Scott was already crying, which just made Stiles tear up. It was a soggy good bye. The chances of Stiles coming back alive were very slim.
He sneered the last few words, his blue eyes sparking in anger. Anthony was left speechless, mouth working as he tried to think of some reason, some argument that didn’t seem weak when spoken out loud.
Rodney had slipped to the back of the ship, tinkering with something until he called Ronon's attention away from the window. He was standing in the empty stern of the ship, nervously fidgeting.
Anthony rages, his skin flushing at the callous words. He made a step forward, teeth bared and body trembling. The guard stepped with him, weapons drawn silently, ready to strike him down where he stood. The captain held up a hand, his blue eyes cutting into Anthony’s furious brown.
It took him a week to fill half his cargo bay with scraps, some going to the sweepers for Howard to fence for him, some he would take and sell to Hilde at cost. They still had a great relationship and she would sometimes take him to her bed, if she was in the mood. They would smoke weed together after and he would spend a few days fixing shit she had laying around.
“Guilty as charged” the man chuckled, his laugh warm and unrestrained as he seemed to find the tool he was searching for and turned to face the captured King.
Kiba growled into his kiss, his arms going tight around his returned lover; reveling in the taste of his mouth, the feel of his sun warmed and sweaty skin, the soft silk of his blonde hair. Naruto giggled into the kiss, licking into his mouth and running his tongue against the dog ninja's sharp incisors.
They don't even make it to the little house, falling together in a small patch of soft grass within a copse of trees near the back of the cottage. They didn't talk about missions or gossip about the goings on in Kohona and beyond. Their communication was non-verbal, touch and taste and sight and smell.
He's glad that Scott was brave enough to be there with him, as they would have both been shot on site for daring to adhere by the old ways. His best friend and brother stood with him as his father's body burned, helped rake the ash so that everything was consumed.
“Why haven’t you done the catch and release with this one yet? We need to get a move on if we want to make it to the jump point in time. Drop him off on the nearest rock and let’s go.”
Scott's voice was tremulous in the echo of the catacombs. The lamplight flickered as he gestured with his arm at the narrow corridor lined from ceiling to floor with recesses, most of them filled with the mummified dead.
This time though, after a quick look around, she ducked into the janitor's closet; shucking her tote bag and yanking off her scarf. Her dress followed, along with her clunky boots.
It was only here, in his private rooms; that he could afford to loosen the tight hold he usually kept on himself. Only here could he set down the armor and be something other than the Iron King, protector and servant of the people.
Ronon carefully cupped the other man's hand in his and turned it so that the small stone dropped into the water and sank. Before Mckay could sputter about it, Ronon pulled the wrist closer and pressed his mouth to Mckay's pulse point.
He pulled uncomfortably at his tight and itchy collar, feeling himself sweating through the thin white undershirt already. Thank god the suit was black and wouldn’t show any sweat stains and he’d have to scrape the money together to get the suit professionally cleaned before returning it.
This time they did go down and Stiles hissed at his best friend as they picked up his father's body once more.
“Yeah?” he challenged in a thready voice. “And what exactly might happen when someone like you loses control?”
They’d stood like that for a few long moments before letting go and abruptly parting ways. There were so many things unsaid in that simple motion, so many hopes and wishes and maybe even farewells. A soldier’s life walked step by step with death. A King’s life even more so.
She'd made sure that he wouldn't be home, stealing Cindy Wazouwski's phone during chemistry class and texting him to come meet her for a hook up at a motel two hours away.
He checked his restraints, hoping to find a weak point; something he could wiggle out of; but no dice. Cassiran flex steel fibres threaded with strom ore, secured to each other and to the walls. Shit. These hunters were serious. His goggles were gone but he could just make out the stark lines of a ship’s brig capsule. Huh. It had been a long fucking time since someone had gotten the jump on him.
"Geez lady, get to the point already. Not all of us like watching someone standing around in the woods having a meeting that could have been handled by email. Nor do I appreciate people trying to blow smoke up my ass. Just tell me why you called me here."
"Of course not." Rodney made a face, "I work with the three hottest people on Atlantis, I have absolutely no problem with nudity." He jabbed a sharp finger at the suns. "I have a problem with melanoma though. Do you know how easy it is to get skin cancer? If someone had warned me I would have brought along extra sunscreen for everybody."
He found a strange young man gripping the wheel and sobbing, dark curls tumbling around his face as he hunched over. A quick look in the backseat showed black garbage bags overflowing with clothes and other belongings.
A skinny, bald man in pants hung low snarled at her, his numerous prison tattoos stark against his pale skin. He voice was rough like gravel but she couldn't hear a word he was saying because her blood was rushing in her ears so loud.
"And after that?" Theodore's voice was gravelly from screaming orders for the evacuation. "He didn't seem to care that we'd turned down Potter's offer of alliance. That the Deep Forest wanted nothing to do with the Summer Kingdoms and their war with Hogwarts. He would rather see us dead and our power burned to ash that see it used by another. What are we without our forest, our lands?"
The rest of the shelves held broken parts and old paper booked, crudely bound with words almost faded completely. Flipping through one kicked up a cloud of dust and Anthony hastily tucked it back as he hacked violently. He flopped unto the small cot, wincing as it squeaked and sagged.
After a while the captives began to lose their fear and became more curious of the robot keeping guard. One of them made a noise of recognition, their eyes darting from Anthony’s hooded and masked face to the tarnished gold visage of the automaton. The driver turned navigator carefully directed them between an out cropping of rocks, revealing a sheltered canyon; at the end of which stood a large set of doors.
Draco turned and braced his hand on Theo's slumped shoulder, squeezing it. He looked into those tired grey eyes and slid his hand up to hold Theo by the back of his neck. "We are alive. That is what we are." he spoke firmly, "We are survivors. We are our mothers' sons and daughters and we will carry their fighting spirit until the earth ends or we do."
Steve was still staring at the tanned hand, pricey watch and black cuffs of his tailored suit when the bartender responded. “One glass of Clemment’s Old Charter coming right up sir.”
"You're crying again." Steve sounded both breathless and concerned, his breath hot against Tony's sweaty temple.
The flats went into her tote and she shoved her feet into the clunky shoes, running a hand through her wild hair. She smiled and made small talk with the library matron  as she checked out her books, apologizing for keeping the other for so long. The bus ride home was a quiet one and she just breathed as the scenery went by.
He was absently paying attention to the chatter over the comm. When a loud cracking sound reached his ears and all of a sudden he was falling, his hands and feet scrambling for his webbing. He heard himself yell, the sound cutting off abruptly as he crashed into something hard and unforgiving. His breath rushed out of him in a pained oof, hurt radiating along his spine.
The house was few minutes run away, through the wooded park behind the library, all the way to the more affluent neighborhood of Fern Parkway. There was a trellis under the bedroom window, just as had been boasted in the halls at school. The window wasn't even locked so she slipped in and checked for any occupants.
Thankfully, the man agreed to give Ewan a ride to town in his old VW Jetta and they trundled off, Ewan turning to look back at his friends one more time. Jake was frowning, standing in the open car door as Eugené pulled her head back into the back seat. Candy was already in the car, gunning the engine impatiently.
“A younger target… wait. You write YA fiction?” he bounced in his seat. “Oh my god… which one is it? No wait .... let me guess.”
"Allison said that the Dragon Lancers are shooting anyone caught on the path on sight. Which is crazy because it's been like, twenty years since there's been dragon sign at the Pass."
He quickly checked the clothes that hung above and found a long, heavy jacket covered with the tiny things as if someone had been rolling in them. He took a picture of the jacket with his phone, bright light still turned on as it caused the miniscule shells to glisten.
Tony's voice was a comfort and peter let his eyes fall closed as he took another deep and cleansing breath.
Ronon grinned as he watched Rodney's hand go slack around the ancient device in his hand, his mouth gaping open as he stared at the calm blue waters of the alien ocean. Pristine white sand stretched along the coast line for miles in either direction, separating the lush green of the dense forest from the crystal clear waters.
"I'll agree to cancelling my other clients and staying here to complete the work but I will need to source the materials in person. I will not compromise the quality of my work by 'phoning it in' as they say."
A sculpted eye brow quirked as kissable lips curled at the corners. “It’s the least I can do for someone who thinks I’m beautiful.”
He’d long since learned how to deal random spikes from his mark, never letting that he was still affected by what most within the Citadel would call a weakness.
Frowned as Natasha smirked at him from across the kitchen table and murmured a vague comment about checking the workshop, before slipping out of the kitchen with an arm full of snacks.
“What is your desire?” he asked solemnly. The captain blinked in surprise but Anthony knew that the general wasn’t talking to his enemy. He took a deep breath and prepared his final and only move.
Luckily for her, he had a sheriff shaped conscience who repeated the mantra "Murder is too much godamned paperwork, kid"  whenever the blood lust surged strong and heady, filling his throat with that cloyingly iron taste and making his black claws lengthen and curl.
Tony keened, body trembling as he grasped at Steve's shoulders, searching for some anchor in the ocean he was lost in. Steve was so hot, his skin salty and sweet under Tony's tongue.
Clint was pretty pragmatic about clothes. Function over form with clothes that looked like shit but were comfortable as shit. Thor on the other hand, thought human fashion was hilarious and treated it all like a huge joke with his fluffy pink robes and casual nudity.
He drank the rest of his coffee in silence, offering quiet company because that’s all that he could do. He couldn’t fix this in his workshop. This wasn’t like some kind of broken machine he could run a diagnostic on. There wasn’t some part to switch out, some upgrade to apply.
"You're smart aren't you?" he'd panted, his ass squeezing mercilessly on Ronon's cock as he rolled his hips deeply. "You can read ancient and you understand more in the labs than you let on, don't you?"
He frowned as he called down to the laundry service. Frowned as he made himself a cup of tea and made another mental list of places to check.
Steve didn’t even hear the rest of what the voice was saying because his brain had stuttered to a stop. His heart as well. He swayed on the spot.  “One thou…. Thousand dollars?”
Xander had faux chuckled along with the gallows humour, already edging away behind Spike as the noise of wet crunching and smacking turned his stomach.
Riddick sat back against his shackles and quirked an incredulous eyebrow.  “That’s true enough. Not much left to us but death and fury. What are you thinking to do about it? You wanna talk? Have some kind of deep conversation? Trade philosophies or some shit like that?”
"More like or something." She gave him a grin, whipping out her orders. "Private Flores Reporting for duty, Sir."
He would stare at his keys sitting smugly in the little special bowl near the door for a few minutes then pocket them without a word. He would frown at the crude and vulgar words spelled out with his fridge magnets before deftly correcting their grammar. He would dismantle the couch fort and set the little pillows back in their places so that he could collapse and take a nap before his afternoon class.
North Pass was lost. Nothing would be salvaged from the solar works. The fortress would probably weather the fires well enough but rebuilding would take years. His mind was already running through plans to compensate for the loss of resources and how the solar power grid would hold up under the demand. He would leave it for the council of governors to hash out the details. That’s what they were there for.
The geeks in charge of Hydroponics were in near hysterics that the deluge of rain would upset the pH balance of their gardens but with the extra ZPMs in place, the city had been able to show them how to secure the gardens.
“We’ve never had a lightsider hostage before.” The blond was saying, “It took us a while to figure out what to do with you. Some of wanted to execute you on sight. Some wanted to torture you for information. In the end I decided that you are worth much more to us as a bargaining tool.”
It was why he had to take his father's stone over the cliffs while it still glowed. He had to go into Dragon Country and find the caves of the mighty creatures and set his father's stone amongst them so sing forever, in tune with his mother's whose stone surely still glowed and sung.
He gave a soft sigh of relief and tugged the material snugly around his body. After so long, he finally felt warm again. Smoothing his hand down the front of the coat, he looked up to see those amused blue eyes again and scowled in response.
The blond had thanked them both voraciously that night when everyone else had gone home, almost breaking the new bed they'd all bought and helped put together the day before.
Now, he was chieftain. He was leader. He had to be strong for his people. He had to be his mother's son. He tilted his chin up and squared his shoulders, turning his eyes out towards the deep dark ocean.
He bundled Rodney into the shower, sucking him off and fingering him until the man was lax and pliant against him. Drying him off tenderly, he brought the man to the nest and watched as his expression softened at the sight.
Derek sunk even lower in his seat as Stiles mind raced, his face flushing deeper as the smaller man inhaled sharply. Stiles voice was low and careful when he finally spoke.
Stiles looked up from his crumpled piece of parchment and gave him best friend a fond smile. "You know I do, Scotty."
Derek chuckled softly, refilling his own mug.  “Hot as lava, black as your soul and enough sugar to give you diabetes. Yeah… I remember.”
The brunet shook his head sharply, folding his arms across his chest with a frown. “No you don’t. In fact, Forget Hammer and his shitty tech. Bucky is never going to get one of those arms.”
Engaging in its limited stealth shielding, the legionnaire worked its way down to the vehicle and secured an unattended hooded coat and some loose radio equipment. Anthony quickly shrugged on the garment, grateful for its sturdy, if not smelly, protection from the chill winds. He quickly cracked open the strange re-breather mask slash communication device attached to the coat, delving into its inner workings curiously.
After checking the room, she went straight for the closet, pulling out the crushed velvet, burgundy track suit with watching custom, burgundy adidas kicks. They were baggy on her but that's how they were supposed to look. She pulled a black beanie over her head and ears, tipping a burgundy NYC ball cap over that.
The break in his voice was the only indication of Blaise's grief. He stood tall and proud, every inch the commander and second his mother had been grooming him to be. His blue epaulets were stark against the dark gleam of his armor. Just as Pansy's green and Theodore's red were when they came close. They were all dirty, exhausted and red at the eyes from crying. And they were all looking at him to lead them. Draco gave on last plea for his mother's wisdom before taking a deep breath.
Hotchner finally nodded. "Agreed. You can source your materials in person, under guard of course. after the presentation, you will be taken home and your recompense will be transferred into a bank account set up for you by Penelope."
Stiles sighed contentedly before twisting his to look up at Derek’s profile. “Can you see anything at all? How does it work?”
Derek was facing him, his eyes floating just over Stiles’ shoulder. His kaleidoscope eyes were dilated, his pupils blown wide and milky white. Stiles felt a sharp pang of heartbreak once more, knowing that those beautiful eyes would never meet his again. Never give him those looks that were a mix between irritation and fond exasperation.
Steve rocked him slow, refusing to heed any demands to move faster, go harder. The blond kept Tony on the knife's edge, soothing the restless and impatient genius with his hands, his lips, the sweet whispers against Tony's neck or the shell of his ear that always made him melt.
It was the kind of love his parents had, if his father spoke true. A love beyond all else, beyond time and the bounds of mortality. A love spoken of in soft tones by the fire, Stiles snug in his father's lap. The steady beat of his heart against Stiles' ear, the soft lilt of his voice when he spoke of the song that all heart stones sang deep in the Dragon's caves.
He went up onto his toes, watching how his thighs and calves flexed and his butt tightened. He’d forego the matching fluffy house slippers as he was a menace in heels and that would be just begging for a sprained ankle. No thank you.
“Lucky that the trap that you sprung wasn’t meant for you. Lucky that we’re hot enough on our mark’s trail that we don’t have time or resources to bring you along for the ride. Really lucky that we don’t have anywhere to secure your corpse to collect the bonus on it later.”
Six months later Erik looked up from his tinkering to see Tony walking towards him, holding two cups of coffee carefully as he padded on slippered feet across the garage.
Rodney chuckled at his own pun as he deftly maneuvered them to the event horizon and Ronon inhaled sharply. "I wanted to show this to you because we wouldn't have even found this address without you. There's no sign of it in the database."
“Be still now luv, you’re looking to make someone like me lose control. You’ll not like what happens after that.”
The room was tastefully appointed, hard woods, burnished gold and supple leather. It was a man's room, made for men's delights. A large desk dominated on side of the room. It was a large monstrosity of a thing, with carved lions snarling, claws extended. Books lined the shelves behind it, floor to ceiling filled with expensive looking leather bound tomes.
The Grimm Twins were the boogie men of Bounty Hunters. Smart, ruthless and relentless, the bounty hunting brother and sister duo were a force to be reckoned with and only took their pick of jobs. They were expensive as fuck but that was because they were just that good.
Tony managed to nod, still a bit too numb to object. He slipped his arms into the sleeves and shrugged the garment on. It was thick enough to be warm but not too heavy and he sighed at the warmth it brought.
Anthony nodded at Rhodes’ fiery words but he did not feel as confident. There was something out there. Something coming closer. He could feel it. Something in the darkness that was beyond Sol’s gaze.
The elevator sped up to the penthouse, barely making a sound to distract him from his own turbulent thoughts. He wandered his way to the bedroom, pushing open the door and leaning against the frame.
She examined her toes appreciatively and carefully corked the polish bottle back, slipping it into her small bucket of nail care things. She herself had only two bottles of her own, pale blush pink and clear top coat, much to her brother's dismay. He, on the other hand, had over thirty shades lined up neatly on his dresser in their little glass bottles , his fingers and toes never the same colour two days in a row.
"And what else has the beautiful and brilliant Princess Allison told you? Hmmmm." Stiles absently studied the parchment once more.
The proximity alert beeped, waking Duo from a fitful sleep.  He blinked the crust from his eye and unstrapped himself from his bed, floating over to the fresher. Gravity was expensive to run, especially out in the more deserted parts of the solar system. There were no other sweeper ships nearby and Howard and his base HQ were at least two days travel away.
By now the media packages he'd had prepped for years had been delivered to almost every news outlet in the world. Within minutes, everyone would have all the gritty details and the whole rotten egg would be cracked wide open.
The genius wiped at his forehead with his shirt sleeve and frowned at the big alien leading them down the path. "Come on Ronon…. We've been walking for over an hour now. When are we going to get to this awesome, must see, paradise anyway?"
The bar at the fancy smancy hotel was a monster of a thing made from polished dark wood and shiny brass fittings. Bottles on bottles of obscenely expensive liquor gleamed in perfect lighting on the mirrored shelves in exquisitely organized rows.
He cupped Ronon's face, rubbing his thumb against the flaking dried blood and pressed a finely trembling kiss to his slack mouth.
"Whadya want Alpha Hale?" he stood feet apart, shoulders relaxed, hands shoved into the deep pockets of his hoodie.  "This better be important. I'm missing out on the Doctor Who season finale and I love me some David Tennant."
McProbie snickered loudly from where he was busy dropping eaves across the room where he'd been sketching the scene. He ducked his head quickly enough when Tony turned his glare his way.
The clothes consisted of a thick knitted sweater of dark brown and some grey woolen pants. He found a pair of sock rolled up in one of the heavy boots and a set of fingerless gloves in the other. They looked well maintained and smelled clean. There was also a wash cloth with a sliver of soap wrapped in it. He decided to tackle getting clean first, before the water lost its warmth.
He let her help him gather herbs and taught her the secret paths through the thickest and darkest of the woods. She was a friend and he cherished their warmth and closeness.
He'd packed his bag in a rage, screaming and crying at Steve who'd stood in the doorway stone faced. His parting words had stunned Tony mute.
He'd putting together his costume over the past few months, making purchases online and in several thrifts shops. He's met up with the girls from the jungle and they'd taken him around to several lesser known stores which catered to the things he needed.
Unfortunately, his Dad had to go into the Sheriff’s office to keep the peace in the wake of the latest announcement, Melissa had been called into the hospital because it was all hands on deck at the ER. And Scotty…. Scotty would rather spend the night having ‘thank god we’re not going to die’ sex with his lady love.
"You're always gushing about so I decided to give it a try." She ducked her head with a smile, her hand careful of the wires and tubes as she twisted her hand to show off the holo effect. "I kinda like it."
Tony shrugged, finally able to show some feeling in the safety of his private chambers. “We lost North Pass. In the end, that’s on me.”
Tony stood in the alley way, ignoring the drizzling rain as it steadily soaked his shirt sleeves through. The night was still warm and the drizzle misted over everything, making the dirty streets shining in the flashing red and blue lights.
With the Kingpin's car totaled by Flash's convertible and his personal drug dealer stabbed and robbed, there would be nowhere that Flash could hide. Not even his daddy's lawyers could protect him from him getting what he deserved.
Xander nodded, turning his head to share a hot and filthy kiss with the man holding him close. “To the end and beyond? Yeah… I like the sound of that.”
Anthony took this moment to appreciate the man once more, lamenting his ever dwindling chance of having a life of love as all other soul bonded enjoyed. Knowing that his death was near, he let his lonely heart indulge in a fanciful dream. One where he could look upon his love in the light of the sun and kiss him in the warmth of Sol’s blessing.
He drained the last of his liquid courage and thumped the heavy crystal glass down unto the bar. That would be his only drink for tonight. He needed to be clear headed if he was going to achieve his nearly impossible goal. The rest of the night would be club soda and bitters if he didn’t want to accidentally throw up on someone important from nerves.
Even though Tsunade hadn't said anything outright, Shika was usually correct in his interpretations. And if he was, that meant Naruto was going to be back and in his arms sometime within the next two days. Kiba closed his eyes and inhaled, letting the scent of sweet grass, the musk of his lover, the smell of sweaty dog and the iron of lost and broken weapons fill his senses until restful sleep came.
“I can’t believe that this is happening. Thank you so much. You’ve saved two lives tonight. Heaven knows how many more tomorrow.” He blurted happily, bringing his hands up to cup Tony’s elbows. “God, if you’d let me I could kiss you right now.”
Those blue eyes looked electric in the swirling colours, that pale skin glowing as if his mate was some kind of celestial body made flesh just for Ronon to hold, to mate, to love. They came together, holding each other close and trembling as bliss swept them away across the universe.
He quickly ruled out the core breach on the last Legionnaire, they would have all died instantly if that had happened. Maybe they had cracked the memory core. That wouldn’t give them much, just the location of his armor and proof of his identity. Anthony paled.  He hoped that this wasn’t the case.
He made a visit to the museum, in lieu of making a call; eager to see the Doctor in person once more. Lamar grinned at seeing him, making Tony stomach flip flop in a good way. Although they were both disappointed that their evidence hadn't panned out for Tony's case, the presence of the shells had led to an internal investigation by the Museum itself.
Doctor Lamar Quintero shook Tony's hand with a smile, blushing at Tony's charm as he lead the agent through one of the long storage halls of the Department of Entomology towards the smaller labs at the back. Tony goggled at the ceiling high shelves stacked with boxes upon boxes of specimens.
The cozy Bed and Breakfast  was warmth and welcoming and he had a wonderful lunch and spent most of his afternoon dozing in front of the fire place in the common area. By late afternoon the mist had crept into town and was curling it's way along the outer buildings.
The brunet followed his gaze, back to the shadowed door where the Captain slowly stepped into the light. Those blue eyes were cold and calculating as the blond leaned his broad frame against the door way.
Anthony let himself shrug. “My life was forfeit the moment I fell to the shadow. Another Iron King will take my place and sit on Rex Solaris. Another will be Righteous and Divine Hand of great Sol and don the holy armor as Protector of the sunlight kingdom. Thus it has always been and thus it will ever be.”
He studiously ignored as the tingle turned into a throb, keeping his attention of the Advisor currently droning on about the latest incursions. His sharp mind snagged on one detail and he raised his gauntleted hand. The advisor immediately fell silent, as did the rest of the war room. He turned his sharp brown eyes to the map floating above his war table.
"Ah yes, no worries. I will buy another one." he felt stupid standing in the kitchen with a broom in his hand, talking to air but this was such a weird situation. "I'll just clean up the mess now if that's alright."
Spencer gave a bow of deference, as if he had not just made a demand of the dangerous Dom before him. But his craft was his craft and he would not compromise, no matter the client. He raised his chin subtly, straightening his spine in defiance.
“And you’re going into the prosthetic business just like that?” Steve couldn’t seem to parse what was going on.
He met a young red haired woman called Lily in the woods one day, so far from the wild haired little girl who used to make mud pies with him in old man Alberforth's field. She was as beautiful and headstrong as ever, seeking him out for conversations about things totally different from what girl's her age usually filled their minds with.
“Oh god…” he hung his head, his chin touching his chest as his eyes stung. “I fucked it all up. Haven’t even started and I fucked it up. Way to go Rogers. Ya big dummy.”
Aunt May came in and guided her from the room to where Ned was sitting, his normally jovial face pale and worried. She let her adopted Aunt guide her to the seat next to him and sat on her other side. It was a cold comfort because Peter was always the one who knew just what to say so bring her spirits up.
Riddick blinked, his eyes adjusting to the light and he looked up to see a rugged man looking down at him with a last smirk. He gave the man a slow once over, his mind racing furiously. The man’s face was known to him, his reputation even better known. He looked around to see if the man’s partner was around but there was no sign of her.
