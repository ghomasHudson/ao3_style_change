Shaking his head, Peter stood up and helped her up as well. “It’s okay.” Exiting the train, they walked in a comfortable silence to her apartment building. Peter noticed it was a very tall building at first and looked very classy. The doorman out in front nodded his head to Gwen and smiled as he opened the door and let them in. They took the elevator up to the twentieth floor.
Tony peered over at the teen, his eyes narrow from the early morning sun. "You're in a good mood. What's got you all up and jumpy?" He asked as he placed the coffee pot back and took his cup to the table.
Blinking a few times, Gwen sat up straight and rubbed her eyes. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to doze off.” She said groggily.
He let Gwen take a few more pictures, she even took some of him which he didn’t mind but he wasn’t one for being in pictures. He half smiled in almost all of them and shied away on a few. Gwen stopped in front of a house that had a tree decorated and called Peter over. “Let’s take a picture together.”
Smiling, Gwen took the folder and placed it in her backpack. “Thank you, Peter. I had a really great time yesterday.”
“I’m not saying that. I’m just saying you made the sauce.” Tony set his fork down as well. “So defensive. Do you not like your own sauce?”
"Hi." Gwen responded as she took out her notebook and the folder Peter had given her earlier. "So I looked over the pictures some more. These are incredible. Have you ever thought about going pro?" She asked as she opened the folder again and started going through the pictures.
Peter looked at the box and smiled as he tore the wrapper off. Inside was a small tag in the shape of a bone. Peter looked at it with his brows knitted until he realized it was a dog tag. “Wait…are you serious?!” He asked and turned to look at his father.
The crowd cheered, Peter himself standing to clap as he shoved his phone back into his pocket. Soon they turned on the generic graduation music and began calling names. It took quite some time, but eventually his row stood and waited in line by the stage stairs. Finally, his name was called. He grabbed his diploma, shook the principles hand and walked over to Gwen, quickly pulling her into a kiss.
“It’s too hot to wear all these layers.” Peter whined as Steve fixed his hair. “Pop, really, the cap will fit over my head.” He chuckled and swatted his father’s hands away.
0o0o0o
“Guess we just decided to forget that you left school yesterday and are grounded?” Steve smirked, obviously toying with his son.
Just a trigger warning, there is mention of medication in this chapter. Just in case this is a trigger for anyone...yeah.
“Yeah.” Gwen said quickly. “I mean, I’ve never done any myself. But I’ve always loved to interpret what others capture.” She spoke in a rush and then smiled after, laughing.
The doorbell rang, Jarvis quickly jumping up and barking. He’d gotten big in the last few months, and Tony had to maneuver around him to get to the door. He opened it and his face became a bit hard. But he took a quick deep breath and forced a smile. “Harry. Come on in, we are just grabbing the last bits of...well I don’t know. Come in.” Tony left the door open for Harry to come in.
“Hey!”
They carried idle conversation while they ate. Finally both stuffed and unable to eat another bite, they started packing the food away. Peter made sure to grab a good amount for Tony to eat as well to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. With the food all packed away and the kitchen cleaned, Bucky invited Peter into the living room to play games.
"Alright. Make something better than canned soup to eat. Goodnight, Peter. I love you." Tony said before hanging up.
The teacher moved his glasses down the bridge of his nose and shook his head. “Your behind needs to be in your seat before the bell rings in order to be on time in my class young man.” With that he pushed his glasses back up his nose and turned back to the board. “Now class, let's open your textbooks to page one-eighty-four.”
Peter closed his mouth as tears quickly overtook him once more and his chest heaved with sobs. “Harry!” He got up and rushed over, quickly throwing his arms around Harry who met him with a tight embrace.
Tony made to leave, but then turned back. “Hey, Peter. Next time, give that kid a run for his money.” When Peter looked up at him, Tony winked and then closed the door.
He nodded as he took a bite of his vanilla ice cream. Peter did understand. Gwen's father was a captain in the NYPD. His father was a captain in the U.S Army. Both never knew if their respected parents would make it home for the holidays, let alone dinner any night for that matter. The worst fear he had for Tony was that someone would try to rob him. But his other father was quite skilled in many forms of martial arts. "I know what you mean." He answered, letting the cold sweet ice cream fill his mouth against the night’s air. "It's not easy. And there's a fine line of understanding they don't know about. We get it. But we don't like it." Peter turned to Gwen and gave a small shrug.
The two other males left the bathroom and Peter quickly descended the stairs and half ran to the kitchen. Steve was close behind and made his way into the kitchen as well, watching Peter make a bowl of cereal. Peter tried not to look up as he sat at the table and shoved a spoonful of Frosted Flakes into his mouth. “Dad, am I about to get the only lecture about time? Again.” Peter let his spoon sit in the bowl as he finally looked up to eye the other.
Gwen shook her head as she walked up to where Peter stood in front of a blue lit house. “How to be a photographer for the night.” She spoke in a whisper.
The school yard was empty again upon his arrival. This made him smile. He shoved the remainder of his pop tart into his mouth, smacking his hands against his jeans to get the crumbs off. Leaning against the building wall, Peter watched as students began to arrive in the lot. His eyes were scanning the area, searching, and finally stopped on who he was looking for. Pushing off the wall, he gave a small wave as Gwen spotted him. She waved in return, walking straight up to him. “Morning.” He said with a smile.
Smiling at him, Gwen picked up her bag and books, also handing Peter his bag. “You’re welcome. Might want to get class before you miss the whole thing.” She spoke kindly and softly.
0o0o0o
The door opened and Tony leaned against the door frame in his robe and smiled at the teen. “Hey kiddo. Just wishing you a good night.”
Nodding, Peter took the beer bottle from him and rushed over to the kitchen to pour its contents out. “The doctor said a month without it dad.” He tossed the glass bottle into the trash and then headed back to the door.
The bell rang and Peter flew out his seat and out the door quickly. But he knew Flash was just as quick to chasing after him. Running down the hall, he shoved his way into the staircase and flew down the stairs, skipping some, in hopes of making it to his next class without a sore rib. “Peter!” He heard from way too close behind him. As he pushed through the doors into the next hallway, it was packed with students. Peter pushed through the crowd and receiving complaints from the students around him. Someone tripped him, and Peter hit the floor hard, pain shooting up his elbow. He rolled over, grabbing at his elbow and sighing in pain.
Shaking his head, Peter remembered he was on the phone as he began typing away on the keyboard. "No, vacation starts tomorrow, remember?" He asked a bit irritated but quickly brushed it off. "Anyways, I'll just make myself some canned soup or something."
She eyed him and raised her brows. “Are you feeling okay?”
Steve rolled his eyes as he was fixated on fixing his own tie. “Can’t believe you are graduating high school when you think the earth can get to a million degrees. Are you sure you didn’t cheat on any test?” He joked, finishing his handy work on his bowtie and grabbing his blazer. “It’s too late to change anyways, we gotta go. Peter, go grab my bag in the kitchen please?”
fuck.
With a smile, Gwen followed him inside. “Guess this wasn’t too smart of a place. Literally at the waterfront.” She laughed as they rode the escalators up to the last floor.
Completely frozen by the voice, it took Peter a moment to look up.
With a small sigh, Peter focused his attention on the game for a moment. After setting his character up with the equipment he liked, the game started. “I’m always passing my classes, Uncle Bucky.” He laughed as he fired his weapon in the game at the enemy. “Friends? Uh, yeah. A few. No girlfriend…and I, at the moment...I’m staying at one side. Not after what happened with...well you know.” Peter of course took no offense to the question.
Peter looked to the scarf, a blush creeping up to his cheeks. “What about you?” He asked, running his fingers gently over the scarf.
Harry frowned and nodded. “Yeah. I was. Hope your dad is okay, Peter. Number is the same.” He said before turning and leaving.
The blood rushed to Peter's cheeks as Gwen stared at him. She was inviting him over for dinner. To her families house. It was surreal. He'd meet her parents. Was this really happening? Nodding his head, Peter smiled nervously and fumbled with his backpack strap. "Yeah. Yes, yeah I'd love to. That sounds...yeah." Peter chuckled to himself and just nodded again.
Peter just nodded in reply as he took off his bag and pulled out the folder of pictures. “I touched them up. Well, edited them. Cropped and stuff…stuff like that.” He cleared his throat as he held the folder out to her.
Steve eyed the mess of hair on his son’s head and crossed his arms. “I don’t know. I think it’s time for a haircut.”
“Flash!” Peter heard someone yell. There was arguing. Yelling. But of what Peter had no idea. The bell rang and the first stupid thought that came to Peter’s mind was that he was late to class again. “Hey.” Someone said to him, snapping their fingers in front of his face.
Running a hand over his face quickly, Peter felt no swelling but knew there were still light bruises on his face. “Thanks.” He said, this time a little louder. “I also--thank...for yesterday, you know?” He spoke with his hands moving all over the place and quickly shoved them into his pockets. Looking down to the snow covered ground and smiling.
"Hey there, squirt." Steve said on the other line. "Merry Christmas, even though it was yesterday."
Tony laughed and took the tag from him, flipping it over so the name showed. “He’s waiting at home.”
Tony shrugged his shoulders as he looked at Peter. “But he is an idiot.” Unable to help the laugh that escaped him, Peter clamped his hand over his mouth. Steve on the other hand nudged Tony. “Right, sorry. So what, you called him an idiot. And that gave him an excuse to beat the hell out of you?”
They said their goodbyes just as he finished getting ready. Looking down at the puppy, Peter pet his head and smiled. "You can't come with me. Though I'm sure Gwen would love to see you." He told the dog. "Maybe next time." Peter rushed downstairs and grabbed his coat, leaving before he changed his mind about bringing Jarvis with him.
“Yes sir.” Peter looked down at his almost empty cereal bowl and suddenly didn’t feel that hungry. Once Steve had given Tony a quick kiss and ruffled Peter’s hair, he left and Peter placed his bowl in the sink. “Why is he always so uptight?” Peter asked Tony.
“I’m sure it looks beautiful.” Peter said and then stumbled over his next few words before sighing and giving Gwen a small smile. “May I?” He asked, holding the camera up. Gwen nodded and posed in front of one of the houses. Peter angled his camera a few different ways, taking multiple pictures. When he felt he got the right one, he put the camera back around his neck and they moved to the end of the block.
Peter stood quiet for a moment before looking down at his lap. “Just stupid stuff.” he mumbled.
Tony heard the aggression. It wasn’t well hidden and he wasn’t too sure Peter was even trying to hide it. Giving a small nod, Tony cleared his throat and stood up. “Okay. You need any money?” He asked as he dug into his pocket and took out his wallet despite Peter’s protest. “No, here, take it. It’s just twenty bucks.”
Peter nodded a few times and then looked up at her. “Good night, Gwen.”
Peter woke with a start, his alarm clock buzzing loudly right beside his bed. He quickly reached over to shut the darn contraption off and stared up at the ceiling for a while. Today started another week of school. Horrible horrendous high school. Taking a deep breath, Peter rolled out of bed and sloppily made his way out of his room and to the bathroom.
“Good morning.” She replied, taking off her scarf. “It’s cold out here.” Gwen slung her scarf over Peter’s bare neck and tied it.
Keeping silent for a moment, Tony stirred his coffee with his finger as he sulked down in the chair. "Last night should have been a ‘get lucky’ kind of night. And every married couple got lucky. Except for me." Tony whined.
Peter knew Steve was listening intently even though he didn’t look up as he shoved another forkful of food into his mouth and reaching for his water bottle just as fast. Motioning his own fork around the plate, Peter shrugged his shoulders. When this got Steve to finally look up from his food, Peter took a deep breath and thought of what to exactly tell his parents. He couldn’t really tell them that this guy usually threatens him into doing his work just enough so he can pass. Or that out on the field or court this same guy often has a knack for tossing a ball Peter’s way when he wasn’t paying attention. Or that this same guy tossed him into a very filthy garbage can just last week.
This was just horrible. Peter didn’t want them making comments at him for liking someone, but he didn’t want to put Gwen’s name in a bad way. Mustering up his words, Peter looked back at his parents and gave a small grin. “Her name is Gwen Stacy. She helped me out today. After Flash that is. Gave me some medicine or something. After Flash.” He stopped and took a deep breath. Repeating himself was going to get him nowhere. “She’s a really nice girl.” Peter couldn’t help the genuine soft smile that came onto his lips as he thought of her wiping his face after the cold water woke him.
Gwen grabbed another soup dumpling as she thought about it for a moment. “Oxford is probably  my top choice, even though it’s abroad. But really I’d be happy if any of them granted me an interview.”
“Yep. I’m just pulling up. There better be turkey left.” Tony said seriously into the receiver.
He finally met her eyes, his heart practically stopping. It was unconsciously, or so he figured, as his feet angled themselves so that he was facing Gwen directly. His eyes must have been playing tricks on him, or so he thought, because it seemed as if she was getting closer to him. Everything kicked back into his mind when he felt his hand grab hers, their faces mere inches apart. Peter took a deep breath and quickly took the pictures from her hands. “Anyways, these are yours to keep.” He nodded, taking a few steps back and placing the pictures back in the folder.
"I told you it was for a project!"  Peter said into his phone as he leaned back in his desk chair. "Had to be up and out early cause I kinda forgot about it last night. Needed to get to the school lab."
(See the end of the chapter for
The sun was already coming up when he finished his editing and started printing them. As they printed, Peter left to take a shower and wash up, returning to his room and dressing for the school day ahead. The final picture finished printing just as his alarm clock went off. Peter shut his alarm clock off and scooped up the pictures, placing them into a folder and putting the folder carefully into his backpack.
“What’s wrong with my truck?!” Steve asked, eyebrows furrowing.
Today was the day at last. Peter was about to put high school behind him and live his life to the fullest. Looking in the mirror by the door, he liked the blue of the cap and gown, but June in New York City was hot. Under the cap and gown, Steve made him wear a suit. Peter was sure by the time they made it to the graduation, he’d have become a wet puddle on the ground.
Affectionately yours,
Rhodey held onto him and all his sticks and stones and broken bones.
, and shoved it back in.  He ignored the bribe.
Steve said, “You gotta admit—” but Tony just sulked,
Steve frowned.  “T-O-T-O?” he translated.
At first, Steve thought it was a wheel—but then Tony said, “This is a tokamak,” and Steve knew he was out of his depth.
“Everyone, please be seated so we can get started!” The principle said, pointing at people to sit down.
It felt like an hour which could only have been a single minute; Gwen finally tore her eyes away to look at the ground. "We are one plate short, um, for dinner. Do you want to come over? For Christmas dinner that is." Gwen sounded so hopeful and was shyly looking at her boots instead of his eyes.
“Of course.” Peter answered, returning the smile. “I’ll edit them tonight and print them out for you to see at school tomorrow.”
Peter just nodded and kept his smile on. The thought of Gwen’s kindness melted his heart in a positive way. Finishing this meal was going to be a piece of cake. And he never minded cleaning up. He did it every day anyways. When all was said and done, Peter made his way into his room and finished up the homework assignment from the only class he made it to. Pushing his book bag to the side, he opened up the side draw of his desk and pulled out his camera. Peter had saved up a lot of allowances to purchase this camera, and since Christmas wasn’t far off, he planned to take some pictures of the decorated houses tomorrow after school. This was a favorite hobby of his, and he figured it would clear his mind greatly. There was a knock on the door and Peter set the camera down atop his desk. “Come in!” He called as he dug in his drawer once more for a memory card to put into the camera.
He paid for the item and walked back outside. Good thing about going to areas after Christmas is the rush was a lot calmer. Peter spotted Gwen crossing the street under the bridge and rushed over to meet her. “Hey.” He said, his breath visible in the cold air. Gwen looked chilled to the bone. “Come on, let’s go inside. The food court upstairs has a place we can get hot chocolate at.”
Gwen shrugged her shoulders. “I guess. But only until I hear back from the universities.”
Gwen nodded and looked at the house, moving around before finally bringing the camera up to her eyes and taking a picture. She smiled as she walked over to Peter and handed him back the camera. “Let me know how it looks.” She said happily.
A moment passed. Steve crossed his arms but couldn’t really get a word out. If there is one thing he noticed it’s that Peter looked really happy. He looked him up and down. He was dressed like any other day. His backpack slung over his shoulder, a pop tart in his hand, his camera hanging around his neck. Steve smiled slightly and shook his head, letting his arms fall to his sides. “Have a good day at school.”
“Who is it with then?” Tony questioned, his tone a little lighter than before.
Peter woke up with his husky puppy cuddled at his feet under the blanket. He yawned and reached for his phone. The light was strong and caused him to squint his eyes, but he fought through to read the text that had come through from Gwen. “Good morning. Hope you had a wonderful Christmas. Still holding you to your word. See you at South Street Seaport at six tonight.” Peter read the message out loud before tossing his phone somewhere on the bed.
“Not any that I know of. Even so, I’m tired of entering science fairs. There’s never any good competition.” Peter joked as he pulled his controller closer to his chest. “Though I was thinking of maybe going to Oscorp for an internship. Teachers been talking about their science programs. Think it’s worth looking into?”
Tony stood quiet for a moment. The sound of papers on the other end made Peter understand the momentary silence before Tony even spoke. "I'm backed up here, kiddo. I won't be home until the early morning. Don't wait up. You got school tomorrow?" Tony asked.
“Peter?”
Still in a stunned state, Peter just stared at her. He caught himself and shook his head, attempting to clear it and looked down. “I--” He began but didn’t know what else to say. Well, he did, he wanted to thank her for stopping Flash, for helping him clean up, for taking care of him when everyone else just stood around and watched. This Gwen Stacy was something else. And he knew her. Not exactly know her, but knew her. He’s seen her around school. He shares three classes with her. He knows she’s on the debate team and that she’s super smart. He knows that she’s very beautiful and that he’s had a crush on her since the first time he ever lay eyes on her back in freshman year. He also knows until today, he’s never spoken to her before. And now she knows him as the wimp who got beat up by Flash. Again.
Another boot to his ribs. These were going to stay bruised for a long time if they weren’t already broken. He sure did feel the pain as if they were. Flash continued his questions, Peter coming to at the last one. “Are you that pathetic? Fag fathers, no friends, no life. Are you a faggot too? Huh?!”
,” he seethed, too weak to scream, too hurt to battle, but fighting them down, laboring for the chance to die.  Steve kept his footing, only to trip over a loose piece of street, landing clumsily on one side.  For a moment, he was tired, he was frustrated, and he missed everything so much it was like its own delirium, but there was nowhere to go but up.
“I’ll bear-spray
Which might have set things off, a little.
Steve watched the drama unfold for a moment, then grunted as Tony crashed into him.  “What are you doing here, get outta here, you idiot,” Tony said, shooing him off the plate.
Tony flicked off the PADD.  Even with the projection gone, the room was not dark; the open window allowed the almost ethereal moonlight from the planet’s veil to seep in, almost like a nightlight.
“Thank you, Admiral,” Stovok said.
with him, to spend so much time with a pack of lunatics who enjoyed spelunking.  Team bonding experiences were never predictable, but he liked seeing what kind of orchard-picking, bronco-busting, cross-country-pork-eating adventures they would get up to, without his direct oversight.
"I went over to Uncle Bucky's for dinner. Dad had to work but he picked me up. The food was great. Did you have a big dinner?" With his pants on, Peter sat on his bed to put on his socks and boots. Jarvis wrestled with one of his boots and Peter had to pry the puppy off.
The two held onto each other for a while before Peter pulled away. “Why are you here?” He asked.
When Peter awoke again his room was dark. There was some shuffling downstairs and he could smell a smoky sauce in the air. Getting up hurt, a lot. He left his room and quickly jumped in the shower. The hot water did little to stop the pain, but it released some of his tense muscles. That was a plus. Getting out, he dried himself and tied the towel around his waist. Heading back into his room, he pulled out a pair of winter pajamas and put them on, noticing as he buttoned his shirt that the bruises on his stomach and chest were just about gone.
Peter looked out to the water once again. “Coney Island.”
"Steve will be home soon." Tony added quickly and hopeful.
“Harry?” He said in a gasp.
Peter went to sit in the recliner by the Christmas tree and rocked slightly. He thanked the man for the controller as it was handed to him before answering the question. "School is school. How goes being a super-secret spy? Did you get your next mission yet?" Peter asked with a large smile.
Peter nodded as he closed his eyes, relishing the moment. “That sounds like a plan.”
Steve stepped inside and closed the door behind him. “Peter get down here!” He yelled. He waited a moment until Peter slowly descended halfway down the stairs. Steve pointed in front of him and Peter sighed, walking the rest of the way down the stairs to stand in front of the much taller man. “Take off the damn hood.” Steve said, crossing his arms.
Peter rolled his eyes and opened his textbook. His father’s words flashed through his mind at that moment, and maybe today he would give the bully a run for his money. Grabbing one of the crumpled paper balls, he set to doing the problems; not only wrong, but the even numbers instead. He doubted Flash was paying attention enough to know they were supposed to do only odd. Actually he doubted Flash even knew the difference between the two.
“They do the fireworks at night here. Want to get on the Wonder Wheel before they start?” Harry asked, taking Peter’s other hand and rubbing smooth circles with his thumb.
Gwen looked up at him and smiled softly. “Thanks Peter.” She then rested her head back on his shoulder.
Peter shook his head, confused. He wasn’t making noise was he? “Nothing.” He spoke softly.
They began to walk and soon enough the lined houses came into view. They were decorated practically ground to roof in lights and signs. Peter turned on his camera and began snapping away. Gwen watched him with a smile, she spoke about how she loved the decorations and which were her favorites. “Can you teach me?” She asked suddenly.
Looking back and forth, Tony placed his fork back into the spaghetti and shrugged, looking to Peter. “Steve made the sauce.” He accused.
Harry was panting, as though he had been running. His black peacoat was covered in a shiny layer of melted snow. “I...I saw it on the news.” There was silence as Peter stared at Harry for a while, his mouth slightly open in clear shock. “I’m sorry. I know I shouldn’t have come. But…”
Peter looked down at her, his brows creased in confusion. "I-I'm sorry...um...what?" Peter shook his head in confusion and waited for an answer.
Peter continued to curse himself because he couldn’t peel his eyes off of Gwen’s which means she could definitely see the blush that was playing across his face. He closed his hand in hers and smirked. “Thanks.” He still spoke in a whisper and excused himself to go and get their readied pizzas. Upon returning he placed the pizza’s down and set the bag with the Zeppole to the side. “Careful, it’s hot.” He went back to grab their drinks and then sat back down.

Waving his hand nonchalantly as if to brush it off, Tony continued flipping through the channels. “I didn’t put in a lot. Just a hint to help my mood. Relax. You’re starting to sound like Steve.”
“Late Rogers-Stark.” The teacher said as he made his way around his desk and to the board.
“No, we don’t. I’m home now. You can go back to work.” Peter unlocked the door and made his way up the stairs.
“Who?” Steve demanded. Shaking his head, Peter made his way into the dining area and took a seat, letting out a yelp of pain, regretting it as soon as his father walked in, demanding once more to know where else he was in pain. Peter lifted his shirt to show the bandaged up areas. Steve peeled off the bandages to reveal several dark bruises, though they seemed to be healing up quickly and evenly. Nothing broken. “At least you patched them up expertly.” Steve complimented.
Steve was not a man who allowed others near him.  He had to keep admirers afar, lest he be smothered in their adoration.  Tony relished every opportunity to tuck a hand around Steve’s elbow, crooked just for him, but he knew it was a privilege.  He knew that Steve stooped to speak with children, that he sat at a table for hours at a time to listen to an upshot talk his ear off, but he volunteered that elbow for Tony, gave him the right to be near him freely.  Others begged for Steve’s company, but Steve invited Tony to join him.
He gripped his free hand over his knee, grounding himself, reminding himself that there were parts of him that did not hurt.  His body was not a broken machine.  It was a wounded machine, a machine that had taken damage.  He kept all his old suits, even the ones that did not work anymore.  There were lessons to be learned from the dead.
Tony waited, looking out the window, feigning disinterest.
on your face,” Tony managed, affecting a frown that definitely had no home on Steve’s face, before dissolving into another round of self-induced amusement.
“No,” Steve insisted.  “You cannot have these.”  His voice still had the same level tone as usual, albeit slightly stuffed up, and if they had been speaking over the phone—or, even, the
Then he walked away.

“I—may have.”  Defensively, Iron Man said, “Technically, he goes where he pleases.  I just make suggestions.”
“Clint’s half a mile away,” Natasha announced, tucking a telephone into an invisible pocket.
Stovok turned to face him.  “The heat will burn you.  Allow me to do what is right.”
“Happy, I’m gonna need about twelve of my usual orders,” Tony interrupted.  “You know what?  Let’s make it an even number, round it up to twenty.”
“I-i-i-it’s c-c-complic-c-cat-t-ted,” Bruce chattered.
“‘Access denied,’” Tony repeated, scowling.  “You know I don’t
“Be a good boy,” Steve told Rico, sliding off his shoes.  The first rumble of thunder crackled outside.  Rico yowled in immediate concert.  “That ain’t a good boy,” Steve reminded him.  Rico yowled again.
Incongruously, Tony started shivering.  “Hey,” Steve said, rubbing his thumb over his shoulder.  “What’sa matter?”
and only managed to choke on another sob.  It was less like crying than drowning.
Steve just sighed.
The humanoid alien offered a hand.  Tony reflexively shook it.  The Nibirans hooted and the presumable elder struck him across the face with a growl.  Tony barely had time to process the sharp pain of it before the Nibiran elder grasped him in a skeletal hand and directed him towards the huddle.  He collapsed on his knees next to Stovok, reaching out automatically to feel for his pulse—appearances didn’t matter, he was

“I’ll help you out,” Tony intruded, before Steve could even pop the cover.  “You know what a pacemaker is?”
Steve said, “Gee, it’s almost like I told you so.”

They never met, but that was okay.
The woman grinned.  “You two fellows ought to stop by the Fred Meyer down the road.  Get stocked up.  You hikers or fishers?”
“I got it,” Tony said, shifting out of Steve’s one-armed hold and chucking the crumpled-up bag of popcorn at the back of Clint’s head.  It bounced off.  Clint lunged for it and lobbed it back with force.
“No,” Steve said obstinately.
“The very same,” Carter confirmed.  “The background radiation levels in the region are . . . quite high.”
“Well,” Steve said, “maybe you should stick to your own.”
“I don’t think they’ll let me cash it,” Steve replied dryly.
“What’s wrong?  Are you hurt?”  He looked hurt.  Steve’s sense of danger rankled.  He had to restrain himself from reaching out and giving Tony a shake,
Once he was sure he would not have a heart attack, he let go of the hatchlings and tapped Marker’s wing.  Marker lifted it obligingly.  Tony blew hard on Actinium’s snout—the hatchling released him—and got to his feet.  Both hatchlings trampled after him, claws clicking on the floor.  Tony turned to them, one finger upraised in warning.  “
Well: almost.
“Yeah,” Clint said, pulling out his own telephone.  “She sent me a message last night.”  He let the mystery dangle.

“It’s already there,” Tony sighed.
He looked stupid.  Atop his head was Steve’s perfectly serviceable cap, but

“Okay.  Great.  Now—
A knock came on the door.  It was soft enough Tony almost dreamed it, but he could not ignore it.  With a grumbling sigh, he stood up and stepped very carefully around Stovok, whose breathing did not change.
“Uncertainty,” Stovok replied, which Tony thought was a strange way of saying,
“Proceed with the approach, Ensign,” Stovok confirmed.
“I thought,” Steve started patiently, but Tony held up a hand for silence.  For once, Steve obliged.
He could not see Steve’s face, but he could make out the exasperation in his tone as he replied, “Get down from there.  Come with me.”
Taking a moment to enjoy his own space, Steve sat on the edge of the newly made bed.  He drew in a fortifying breath.
“Got some dirt under your eye,” he explained belatedly, dropping his hand.
“You’re just like your Pa,” Steve told Tony, intending to join the almost familial atmosphere with a meaningful contribution.  “Same flare for the dramatic.”
“As you are aware, Mr. Stark, your position on board the

, a strange twinge in his chest that made his world stutter to a weird shimmering halt, like a take in a movie had been called to a halt.  All Cap’s focus broke: he looked at Tony, gaze hard for a fraction of a second before it softened, his jaw a hard line even as he asked in the same gentle undertone, “Tony?”
Rico yowled again.  “Don’t fuss,” Steve told him.  Tentatively, he entered the attached bathroom, caught a glimpse of a familiar face in the mirror holding a skinny tabby cat but still no signs of Tony.
.  Those eyes would haunt him, he was sure of it.

Steve gave him a stern,
Of course, such hands-on experience had come at a cost, namely, a close encounter of the “alien prison” kind at age 37, but it had also introduced him to Security Officer James Rhodes, AKA the best face to ever walk off the U.S.S.
“What’s the medical officer
“You do know Alaska’s cold, don’t you?” Steve prompted.
“You have to be nice to me,” Tony added triumphantly.

He became aware of his Tony tapping out a rhythm on his side, three fingers beating out a steady tempo, and he followed along because

Bruce finally appeared at the top of the gap, clocked his head on the exact same spot, said loudly but without heart, “
Steve had no hard feelings for the hatchlings, even Actinium, who had bitten him on the neck.  Tony, who had no fewer than twelve visible dragon bites scattered across his person, could sympathize.  Even Marker broke his ribs on occasion; such were the hazards of attempting to commune with animals who could probably fly to the Moon and back without suffering damage.
“You are sleeping on the couch.”
He was silent for a while, hands folded on his chest neatly.  “I have seen many bleed for a planet I have never been to.  After my service in the Romulan-Earth Wars, I was offered shore leave.  I should have taken it.”
“Provisional officers traditionally sign up for six-month contracts,” Carter said.  “You have been with us for nearly two years.”
“Great,” Tony said calmly.  “Then we will swing by the nearest airport.”
Able to feel his appendages but not use them, Tony vowed,
Tony looked at the glass windows, at Steve and Clint, seated on a couch.  “Yeah,” he said, losing track of the question in favor of watching Steve with Thallium curled up against him, her little horned head resting near his heart.  “I am,” he added, looking at Rhodes.  “I’ve got everything I need.  Except my

“Anij,” their host chastised.
Tucking himself closer to Steve’s front, allowing those big gentle monster claws to rest against his back, he breathed a short sigh of relief.  He was safe now.  He was safe from other monsters.
“Rather you not.”
“I know I haven’t . . . I’m not always . . . I don’t . . . ”  It was like trying to hold the tide in his palms.  It just kept slipping away.  “I’d miss you, buddy.  You’re my . . .”  He held out a hand.  After a prolonged hesitation that felt almost like rejection, like
“It’s like talking to a broken record,” Tony said, walking away.
“You don’t even believe in God!”
Steve huffed.  Then, weary but inspired, he admitted: “Thor made an offer.”
“I spit in the street,” Clint volunteered.
Ice Cave Sounds, for the auditory learners:
Actinium gnawed on Tony’s boot.  “Tin-Tin,” Tony warned the blue-tinted troublemaker.  He was seated at his workbench, hard at work on the Mark XLV helmet.  “Let go, that’s not food.”  He paused to look down at the hatchling, about the size of a honey badger, gripping his leather boot with the same determination.  “Tin-Tin,” he repeated.  “Don’t make me spritz you.”  The air spray cannister would not hurt the dragon, but it would piss him off.  Normally, that would be a death sentence, but Actinium was ten kilos.  Tony could take him.  “Tin-Tin,” he said a third time, as the dragonling clicked in warning, then began thrashing his boot.
Tony kept lying.
Close enough.  Tony scooped her up and fled the dragon’s den.
“Don’t worry, sourpuss,” Tony said finally, voice composed but words making Steve look over, angular and annoyed, “we’ll find a place for you, yet.”

Tony watched them.  Marker warbled gutturally.

“This is your fault.”
Steve scowled.

“My head is perfectly proportional,” Stovok assured.
The Avengers had piled like prairie dogs on the single mattress, which Steve considered luxurious for one man and pretty unforgiving for five.  Thor alone had claimed nearly two-thirds of the available space.  “What’s wrong with you guys?” Steve asked out loud, forgetting to check his own ire.  “What’s the matter with you, huh?”  His heart was twisting and twisting and twisting, but he kept his voice level and checked as he added, “You know, people
Tony sized him up, then crossed his arms over his chest and insisted, “It looks better on me.”

The suit politely pinned Steve’s legs to the couch.  With an impressive amount of force, given the use of only one arm, Steve promptly rocket-launched Tony into the air.
“Just ignore him,” Natasha advised, eyes closed but, apparently, awake.  Must be a “living life on the run” thing.

“Be quiet, Tony.”
“Then use
“Shhhh.”
Steve held his ground.  “It’s your game,” he reminded.
“Yes,” Tony said.  “It’ll be on the check.  Watch the sprinkles,” he added, as the ice cream hit critical mass and spilled.
Tony hesitated, hand hovering over the side of his face again, tempted beyond reason before resting it firmly on Stovok’s covered shoulder.  Shame welled up inside him, guilt at taking what had not even been given, but, desperate to defend himself, he reasoned that Stovok could have broken his hand, if he so disliked the intrusion.
It might not have moved Steve, but it did make Tony feel better.  The joy was short-lived, as he now had a smelly, still mildly insensate, bull-headed Steve Rogers on his hands.
Tony took off.  Steve said, “Aw, c’mon, he’s a good dog!”
Even in his bulky tactical gear, Tony was surprisingly soft against his chest, real and reassuringly alive.  “Steve,” Tony said, and his throat clicked audibly as he swallowed.  “We’re a long, long way from home.”
in 1947.
Tony waited ten boring minutes outside the hell hole before approaching it again.  All was quiet below.  Out of spite, he kicked a couple tiny rocks into it, then panicked, imagining the world’s mightiest heroes drowning in his own errant science experiment.  “Cap?” he called.  “
Steve lingered.  “. . . Can I sit here?”
Steve gave Tony a stern look.  “Dear, you’re making it hard on him,” Tony volunteered.  “He’s trying.”
things,” he muttered, more to himself than Tony, probably.  Tony’s heart was rabbiting along, while Cap’s breath remained slow and steady against him.  “It’s really not that bad, look, see, there’s a rope—”  Cap shifted, evidently moving towards it, and Tony felt the nylon against his back, even as Cap added, “Just grab the rope, Tony.”
“What’s at Mendenhall?” Steve asked their guide instead, giving Tony the space to move ahead.

The chef paled but had no choice but to endure the Hirogen’s praise until Thor released him.  Still shaking visibly from the encounter, the chef nodded, said, “I’ll make more,” and blitzed off.
“Not for

Tony made a soft noise, drowned out almost entirely by the terrestrial rumble of the volcano.  “We’re not talking about that, are we?” he asked, indicating the caldera with a wave of the hand.
Natasha went on: “To answer your question, I think the term he prefers is

Oh, but Steve
Once his feet disappeared from view, Stovok looked at Tony, both eyebrows arched.
“He never takes off the suit,” Natasha said, a theme Steve had heard a dozen times already,
, but Thor shuffled back on his rock, wrenching a cry out of Steve’s chest as he was dragged over the sharp rocks.  Once half of his body was out of the water, he managed to grip on with his working left arm and use it to grip onto Thor’s armor in return, relieving the strain on his right arm.  He gasped desperately in relief.
, before he was surrounded by suffocating darkness.
Then Tony shook his head and turned back.  Steve was grateful.
“If anything, it’s Stark I’d be concerned about,” Hill said, stopping him in his literal tracks.  He looked down at her, still seated on the edge of the bed, still dressed for a mission, yet perfectly calm.  “You behaved . . . quite admirably, Captain.”
“I think so too, red is more my color.” Peter grinned as he leaned in and gave Harry a kiss.
“No, Peter, I never told my dad that. I told him that it was all my idea and that I pressured you into drinking his bottle with me. I would have never...but you didn’t return my text. And you blocked my number. I tried to come and see you, but your dads wouldn’t let me. My dad had then transferred me to a different school and...I stopped trying.” Harry looked up at Peter now, his eyes red and shining as he fought back his own tears. “I loved you, Peter. And you abandoned me.”
"It's not drugs, dad. It's this horrible thing called school." Peter joked as he pulled up an internet browser and pulled his keyboard forward. Even if he was lying about why he left early, he actually did have some homework to do. Peter decided early on he would finish all the Christmas break homework tonight. And having a computer in his room was the most helpful thing his parents could have ever gotten him. "Anyways, I'll see you later? " Peter asked.
“Oh, um…” Harry stumbled for words, but was quickly saved.
He didn’t wait for a response before opening the door. Tony lay on the bed under the covers flipping through the channels. Looking confused, he noticed the cup in his son's hand and sighed. Peter placed the mug a bit harshly down on the bedside table and crossed his arms, ignoring the splash of coffee that spilled. “Really? What part of you shouldn’t be drinking for a while, did you not understand when the doctor told you?” He hated sounding like the parent in situations with his parents, but this was a serious ordeal.
Steve turned the radio off and put the heat higher. “So, are you going to tell me what happened at school today?”
Tony butted in quicker then Peter could. “Oh no. Peter is coming to work for Stark Industries, full time!”
“I’d love too.” Gwen said softly. She looked around and noticed more people had arrived, the front doors now open. “Come on, let’s get out of this cold.” She intertwined her arm with Peter’s and they began walking toward the school.
Peter looked at the time and closed the door quickly. It was one minute to seven and he decided the last minute shouldn’t matter. He pressed the call button and placed the phone to his ear, taking a seat on his bed. His leg continued to shake as the phone rang and Peter had to hold it down. It stopped ringing and he heard her soft voice on the other end. “Hello?” She answered and Peter was stuck for a moment.
Doing as instructed, Peter sat down and the two started to fill that plates. There was way too much good for just the two of them, but he already knew his Uncle had made extra for his parents. Well, at least for Tony since Steve wouldn't be home for another few days. Before they started eating, Bucky said his grace. Steve often did the same thing on holidays and large gatherings. Peter and Tony shared different beliefs from the best friends but respected them nonetheless. At this moment with only the two of them, Peter bowed his head and waited for Bucky to finish. Once it was over, they dug in.
The doctor hesitated for a moment before he spoke. “Your father mixed his heart medication with alcohol and went into cardiac arrest. We are prepping him for triple bypass surgery immediately.”
“Do you like pizza?” Peter asked in a rush. The words escaped his mouth before he could catch them. This definitely wasn’t him. Something must have taken over his body to speak so boldly, so clear. Maybe Flash’s punches unscrewed something in his head. Gwen nodded and Peter smirked. “There’s this great oven baked pizzeria on Second Avenue. We could swing by there after if you wish.” The words came out slow and low, but he knew they were even so he felt proud of himself.
Gwen waved in return and smiled. “Morning. You look better.” She complimented.
Tony walked over to where Peter stood and smiled at him. “Be careful out there.” He said, taking a sip from his beer bottle.
The place was packed when they arrived with ten minutes to spare. After finding a parking, Peter gave his dads a hug and Harry one last kiss before separating to join his classmates in the student section. He walked over to a teacher for his seating arrangement. Since he had two last names, they would be putting him in the R section since Rogers was first.
"Damn, Uncle Bucky! I don't understand how you can cook this good. I mean, other people cook and it's great. But this?" Peter dramatically pointed to the piece of turkey currently stabbed into his fork. "It just amazing. My dad's are okay at cooking, but they can't even come close to you." Peter boasted and quickly finished off his first plate.
Steve took a seat across from the teen and smiled. “No, I suppose I’ll spare you this morning. Hurry up though, I’ll drive you to school.”
Peter took a bite of his burger and nodded.
It took Peter a moment longer before he was able to peel his feet from the ground and rush off to class.
Peter gave a soft nod. “It’s okay, it will take them getting used to. When I brought up the conversation after we had agreed to start dating again, I had to explain to them what a polyamorous relationship was. Especially Steve. He’s extremely old school.”
Letting the door close, Peter rode the elevator back down and went back into the cold, but felt none of it. He got home way past his curfew but didn’t care. No one was up when he arrived and he locked himself in his room. He knew he wasn’t going to sleep tonight as he turned on his computer and brought up his editing software to fix the pictures. His stomach floated with butterflies when he got to the pictures with Gwen posing. They flew like crazy when he got to the pictures with the two of them. He made a special note to print the pictures she took herself. They really were good shots and he made the lights shine brighter.
“Yes sir.” Peter said, smiling at his father. It was nice to have Steve actually give him a chance to take care of something by himself. He made a mental note that his sometimes stuck up military father has a soft side that loves and worries for his family’s safety. He made another mental note to seriously thank Gwen tomorrow. Not only did she help him, but this gives him another chance to speak to her. And maybe it will turn into more chances. Peter lay on his bed, the pain of the day kicking in once more. He got up, took some aspirin, and threw himself back on the bed, pulling the covers over him and finally going to sleep.
"So, how goes school?" Bucky asked as he turned on the television and the gaming system, handing Peter one of the controllers.
Gwen offered him a smile and caressed his cheek. “Don’t worry about me, Peter. I’ll catch a cab. Just, update me later, please?” She asked and smiled softly when he nodded.
Bucky opened the stove and took out the ham first. He placed it onto a glass dish and handed it to Peter before going back to the stove and taking out the turkey. Facing his nephew, Bucky shrugged his shoulders and smirked. "Since I missed Thanksgiving and I know you didn't have the best one ever, thought you and I deserve to go all out tonight." He placed the turkey onto the table, took off his mittens, and then sat down with a content sigh. "Come on, Peter. Sit down."
Tony smiled. “That’s my boy.” He pulled Peter into a hug. “Congratulations. And yes, we are going with the Stacy’s for Dim Sum. Harry...will you, uh…be joining us?” The words were choked out, but Tony was making an effort.
Gwen took out one last book and closed her locker. “So, where are we going tonight?”
“Okay! Whoa!” Peter dropped his own fork and pushed his chair back away from the table. “Where is this going?” He held up his arms close to his ears, ready to cover them in any moments need.
“Quite the stutter, Peter.” Tony boasted. “That’s how we could always tell you were nervous.”
Together, they rode the Q train from Canal Street all the way to Coney Island. The sun was starting to set, and the amusement park was as lively as ever. They rode some of the rides, ate some carnival snacks on the boardwalk, and headed onto the beach to watch the sunset. Peter leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder as they sat in the sand. Gwen leaned on Peter and held his hand.
Shaking his head slowly, Tony said, “You . . . I’m
There was a prolonged silence, the kind that tumbleweeds drifted over.  There were no tumbleweeds this far North.

“Don’t be crass,” Steve grumbled.
“I could watch this all day,” Tony said, surprisingly happy, to be on-world, away from the fuss-and-muss of filing reports, enjoying what life had to offer.  Then, scowling, he added, “That doesn’t mean I’m going down without a fight.”
Dragons did not need fire.  It was overkill, literally.
“How much do you remember?” Rhodey asked.
“You’ll do well to speak in accordance with your station,” Captain Carter added pointedly.  “Mr. Stark.”
“Vowels,” Thor repeated, materializing behind Steve.  “I do not—”
“Fine,” Tony said, sitting up, reaching out, and seizing a handful of uniform.  “I’ll do it myself.”  And he leaned up and kissed a
With a reverse inhale, Tony awoke, eyes flashing open, pain erupting in his chest, static foaming down his right arm.
How strange must it be, he thought, to be from two worlds.
Thor paused mid-roll.
“No,” Tony said.  “I haven’t even decided if we’re keeping
“Sorry not sorry,” Tony said curtly.
Possibilities sprang to Tony’s mind.  Maybe the planet was the same age as Earth, but tetherless.  Tony looked to the sky for a small glowing satellite, but nothing stood out to him on the semi-cloudy night.  Moons had a tendency to rapidly slow down even a ballistic planet’s speed, but an Earth-sized moon was still rare, and finding a much smaller hunk of rock was difficult without equipment.
Steve waited until Tony’s breathing deepened into sleep before making his great escape.
“She eat him?”
“What, no ‘patrolling the perimeter’?”
Thor’s disappointment was palpable as they entered the hall of the
“Ex-fucking-
Tony made a small noise.  “Huh.  She’s—”
Or, he would have, if he did not give into the insurmountable urge to lie down.
Natasha stood, just slowly enough that Steve only bristled when she took a step closer.  She reached for his non-shield arm, rested a cool, delicate hand over his wrist.  “It’s been a long day, Cap,” she said, her words almost mesmerizing in their cadence, calm and self-assured.  “Wash up.  Get some rest.”
“Think Jeremiah had them,” Steve said.  Raising his voice: “Jeremiah!”
Steve swallowed, surprised at how dry his mouth was.  “What’s your point, Tony?” he asked, glad his voice was stiff, upright.
Huffing, Steve said, “Always so humble.”

“And I will gladly punch the Kevin out of people.”
Steve took the bait.  “. . . What did it say?”

Tony nodded, then pulled out his telephone.  “Look, see, he’s in—”  Tony frowned, then conjured up a glowing blue structure.  Using his fingers to manipulate the image, he finished faintly, “Australia.”
Tony awoke, floating in space.
Doing so meant looking right into a dragon’s eye.
“Can you not harass him?” Steve said, making Tony jump.  Which, if Steve had been mad at him—
With a disgruntled sigh, Steve scooped up a handful.
“You have drawn your conclusions.”
To their credit, the hotel clerks did not even bat an eyelash as Steve walked past them, carrying Clint over his shoulders, one hand upheld in a brief,

“What’s not to like?” Tony dismissed, waving a hand.  “Everybody loves dinosaurs.”

Moving into the appropriate lane, Steve asked, “What, the future’s still got rat races?”
With a controlled burst from his heels, Tony crossed the short distance between them, wrapping both arms around Marker’s neck.  “You’re my favorite big beautiful bastard,” he exulted.  Marker clicked indecipherably.  “I wish I spoke your language!” he shouted back.
Tony bonked him on the head with a closed fist (“
“He’s scared, Steve.”  Steve cut her a sharp look.  Natasha just looked out at the city, the lines of her face familiar, her blonde hair divorcing her from the work partner he knew.  “Aren’t we all?” she added, absolving Tony of guilt.
“It’s not my birthday,” Steve reminded Tony, once they had stepped out of range.  “Or Christmas.”  Then he frowned.  “It’s not Christmas, is it?”
Coleman nodded to himself, then leaned down to stroke the other bloodhound’s back once.  “My father, when he was a boy, he met you, in Bristol.  Passing through.  You shook his hand and told him he’d live t’ see the end of the war.  Always used to say, he’d meet you again, someday, and prove it.”  Coleman thrust out a hand.  Steve straightened, clasped it.  “Thank you.  He would’ve liked to see you again.”

Tony said grimly, “We’re all gonna die.”
“These are
Steve returned to the crowd.
“There’s a few elephant graveyards worth exploring,” Tony mused.  At Rhodes’ unimpressed look, he added calmly, “Not that I ever would.”
Shaking his head slowly, Steve looked around the Stone Age sterile room and said, “Progress, huh?  No flying cars.  No lunar bases.”
“I try to be.”  Still wearing that hooded, almost happy but mostly peaceful expression, Steve said, “Got somebody to be sweet to.  Makes a difference.”

Tony made a disgruntled sound, then pulled out his telephone.  He conjured up the same blue map as before, then indicated a little red dot.  “Lake Huron,” he said, frowning.  “Must’ve—overshot us.”  He closed the map and tapped at the telephone.  After three rings:
uses trackers.
Without a word, Steve tossed the ball to third.  Tony caught it neatly.  Thor halted at second.
“Records can be scarce,” Tony admitted, not wanting to give false hope, “but I can look—”
Stovok insisted, “Because we are the only ones who might make them see truth.”
“Nah, we hoofed it—our ride’s on the other side of the lake,” Clint said.  “That’s S.H.I.E.L.D.”

“Get your slimy germ-infested paws off me,” Tony said, long after Steve had gotten his slimy, germ-infested paws off him, and retrieved the actual flour bowl from the cabinets.  Whistling a distracting tune, Tony interrupted himself to add, “Do you cook?  A lot?  Is cooking your thing?  Should I sign you up for
Romanoff laid on the horn.  Barton stood in the back of the truck, shirtless, and roared, “
Tony got dressed and was almost out the door for some much-needed fresh air, when green Thallium poked her head into the room.
Stovok shook his head slowly.  “No.”  Folding his arms, he looked out over the desert-like homeworld of the Gorn and said, “It would only be a dream.  I should like to live a life.  Perhaps even one outside Starfleet.”  Then, with a hint of a real smile, he added, “I have seen my services may be of benefit to others, beyond mere diplomacy.”
crossed Steve’s mind, but he brushed it off like an errant fly.  That much was already obvious.  Tony Stark was a very attractive man—attracted all kinds of things, money, fame, women.  “You ever get tired of it?” he asked, when Tony ignored the box.
“Wouldn’t work, anyway,” Steve interjected, before Tony could do more than pivot suspiciously in Clint’s direction, who appeared to be approaching catatonia, gazing up at the stars.  Tony pivoted back towards Steve.  “Thor’s just a great chef,” Steve said.  “Those ribs were fucking amazing.”
Dr. Banner paled.  “Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.”
“. . . What, is that Socrates?”
Tony knocked on the door.  When no one answered, he turned to Steve, who reached for the key in his pocket, surprised to find it had survived the journey.
Dr. Banner began to climb towards them, swaying dangerously towards the lip.  The Nibirans above watched for a few more seconds, then turned back, almost as one, and began to ascend.  Tony had no choice but to fall in line, or be shoved over the edge.
Tony harrumphed loudly.
Had it happened in isolation, Tony Stark would not have survived.  If they had peeled off his skin layer by layer, stitch by stitch, he could not possibly have endured.  That it had happened quickly, violently, brutishly, and overnight made it graspable in his mind, a cumulative event, like a meteor strike.  A singular impact with a global rippling effect.  Although the pain in his chest must surely have been greater than the comparatively negligible cold surrounding him, Tony remembered lying on a cot, a thin blanket twisted in his hands, shivering irrepressibly for hours.
.  That’s wonderful.  That is . . . exactly the kind of person I want you to be, the kind of person I want to be with.”
Realizing he was arguing with a nice lady who had let them into the Zoo after hours just so Steve could argue the finer points of monkey care, Steve said carefully, “I suppose I’m not exactly an expert on the matter.”
“Awh, it’s no trouble,” the stranger said.  “It’d be fun.”
Steve put a quelling hand on his shoulder.  “I’m not explaining to Nick Fury how you died on our trip to Niagara Falls.”
Your Captain on this adventure,
Steve gave him a flat look.
“My sister was in New York that day,” one said.  “Thank you for saving her life.”
.  Clint cackled.
Tony kissed the alpaca’s cheek again.  “I love you,” he repeated.
Sucking in a sharp breath, Steve said, “It happens?
Then she tilted her head meaningfully towards his ankle.  “
“No, it’s about keeping Barton off my back,” Tony said, fishing in a pocket and pulling out his telephone.  He tapped energetically at it for a few seconds, then pocketed it again.  “You know what’s wild?  It would actually be cheaper to strip a car for parts than acquire them individually.”
“I will sedate you,” Natasha said calmly.
And by
It was all a dream, Steve decided fervently, keeping his eyes ahead, solely on the Black Widow, and his arms wrapped firmly around his cargo.  The details would never matter.  Even he would not matter.  Only the people in it, who would be left behind when he evaporated, come morning.
“I’m not gonna say thank you,” Tony said stiffly, pride almost as sore as the rest of him.
Steve had hurt people, he’d helped people, he’d killed and he’d comforted and he’d done everything he could in those dark damp terrible places to be a good person but it was hard, there was no

Head down, Tony asked, “They lookin’?”
Yours,
Natasha inclined her head, staying where she was, basking in the morning sun.
“Not to mention their sparkling eyes,” Tony added.
“These are killing me, and I love them for it,” he announced to the room, taking another big bite.

And then, with the sort of stiff, limping, upright resolve Tony had come to associate with Cap, Steve grasped the edge of the strap and pushed it back down.  Piece-by-piece, Steve returned it to order.
Steve shook his head.  He crossed the floor and pushed open the bedroom door.  The bed was neatly made.  His few belongings had been looted—no clothes in the closet, not even the old clock.  It felt like a ghost’s home.
“What’re you talkin’ about?  Of course it is.”  Steve held up the pot and sniffed it.  “It’s coffee.”

Curium snarled.  “Drop it,” Steve repeated.
“You are dismissed, Mr. Stark,” Captain Carter responded calmly.
Steve gripped his wrists gently.  “Tony.”
Tony cleared his throat gently.  Stovok acknowledged, “How are you feeling?”
Tony nodded, but he was still breathing fast and shallow.  “Hope you’re not planning to hike the Appalachia anytime soon,” he huffed.
Tony took a sip of his coffee and leaned against the counter. “Military life. That’s what it does to people.” He looked out the window and took another sip from his mug. “Get dressed, I’ll drive you to school.”
"How do you do it?" Gwen asked, taking another bite from her chocolate treat.

The waiting room was packed. There were police assigned to keep out reporters. It wasn’t every day that a businessman as big as Tony was carted away in an ambulance. Nonetheless from his own home. Peter’s hands were folded over his lips as his leg refused to stay still. The tears reluctantly spilled from his eyes as he waited to hear back from a doctor.
Bucky watched until Harry was completely out of sight before he turned to Peter. “Are you okay?” When Peter nodded, Bucky relaxed and grabbed the bag of food. “I got burgers.”
The truck came to a stop at a red light and Steve turned to look at Peter. “Like what?” Peter gave a shrug and Steve shook his head. “Not good enough. Peter look at me when I’m talking to you.”
“Grand central.” She answered, resting her head on Peter’s shoulder.
Since the class started, Peter has had an incredible amount of paper balls thrown at him from the bully sitting behind him. It’s only ten minutes into the class, but Flash was wasting no time in crumbling up another sheet. Peter sighed to himself. “Not like he was going to use them anyways.” He mumbled to himself as he tried to pay attention to the board and copy notes as another paper hit his shoulder and landed on his desk. He pushed it off his desk, the paper joining the growing pile at the side of his desk.
Feeling a bit hungry, Peter put on his hood and walked to the nearest hot dog vendor. He looked around at all the other people here and wondered if any of them have ever skipped school after getting beat up and humiliated in front of the girl you liked. Didn’t seem like it, seeing how there was a couple feeding French fries to one another. Looking down at his meal, Peter quickly finished and tossed everything into the trash.
“Is this a serious conversation?” Peter asked without taking his eyes off the television.
She followed everything he said, leaning back to rest her back against his chest. He prayed she couldn’t feel his heart pounding. “Like this?” She asked, repeating what he had guided her hands to do.
Harry wore a slim dark blue suit to match Peter’s own. “I’m pretty sure this color matches me better then it does you.” He smirked.
Tony was the owner of Stark Industries. He built weapons even though he was against the idea completely and wished to one day make his company into something more humane, but as he states, it’s money. Steve was a captain in the military and was often at an office filling out paperwork or commanding a training base. Both of them did very amazing things in Peter’s eyes. Sometimes though it’d be nice to have dinner as a family like they used to when he was a kid.
Peter looked up from his camera. “How to take a picture?”
“Heart medicine?” Bucky asked, looking at Peter.
“Give me that, smart ass.” Steve laughed as he took the stuff and put it into his bag. “I’m proud of you son. Congratulations.”
Peter could not figure out how he wasn’t melting into the snow right now, or how his legs were even moving. It sure wasn’t on his own because his mind couldn’t focus on walking. All he could think about was his arm wrapped with Gwen’s own and how fast his heart was beating. He heard the whispers around him, saw the faces turning their way, but he didn’t care. If this moment could last forever, he’d capture it on his camera and print it immediately. But it also scared him.
“Hate this show,” Tony rasped.
“Suit yourself.”  Steve shimmied further down, calling down below, “Ey, watch where you’re pointing those flashlights!”
“We call them tank-killers, at that size.”
“Don’t be a bitch, Stark,” Barton called.
“Good; he can stay there,” Tony replied.  Then, waving a hand, he added, “Go get him.  You have twenty minutes.”
Steve was silent for the span of a few breaths.  “I waited,” he said at last.  “And when waiting wasn’t enough. . . .”
“Our pleasure,” one said faintly.
The monster scraped its claws against the door gently.  “I just want to help,” the monster insisted softly.

Tony did kind of look like something somebody had dug up.
All was lost, in that moment, wiped clean like a cosmic impact.
level of duplication, never mind in a separate Quadrant.  And after the Talosian illusion, Tony was even less inclined to believe his own eyes.
Tony offered another real answer to a real question Steve had not asked.
Finally, he managed, “Doctor.”
No one answered.
,” Tony complained emphatically, tossing the extinguisher aside.
“They could be.”
“Rest, Tony,” Rhodes encouraged.
Tony was asleep in their bed.  Steve wanted to be satisfied, relieved that Tony was OK, but the worst day of his life had begun with Tony asleep in their bed, a soft kiss to his temple and a mute promise to be back, but by the time Steve had returned, Tony had not been asleep but unconscious.
Tony repeated, “

Late nights did not equal late mornings.  They had ground to cover.

Tony pouted, genuinely put out, before shaking his head at himself.  “Plenty more where that came from.  You got video?”
“I was awarded this bear for my superior marksmanship,” Thor informed him, proudly holding up the poor smoked teddy bear.  “I have named him—”
“Oh, they’re—off,” Bruce said distractedly, turning the page.
Tony grumbled, then deliberately leaned into Stovok’s shoulder.  Even through the suit, Tony felt the muffled blue of irritation, the deep gray of volcanic uncertainty, before Stovok stood and approached the copilot’s chair, breaking the contact.  The brief red flicker of worry did not escape Tony’s notice, but he chose not to comment on it.
“So long, hunter.”
“The magic of pocket dimensions,” Admiral Fury said.
P.S. Almost forgot!
“I’m sure they’re completely internalizing it,” Tony said dryly.  Stovok looked up at him, parsing out whether he was serious or not.  Tony said, “Really, you should be ashamed of yourself.  Keep going,” he insisted.
“I’m sorry we’ll miss it,” Steve said truthfully, giving Coleman his attention again.  “We’re just passing through.”
“No,” Steve repeated.  “What is wrong with you?”
Squeezing it, he whispered, “I’m sorry.”
“Hold that thought,” Steve said grimly.
Twenty-twelve.  Right.
.  It was painstaking work.  Despite his initial optimism, he gave up on himself at times, drinking himself into a stupor to forget the miserable state of affairs.
He wondered if it was beautiful, being able to reach out into the darkness and light someone else’s candle.
, the man inside the metal jacket went on, lying sideways across the conference room chair, the picture of nonchalance despite the bloody trading cards scattered across the table,
“No, I wouldn’t expect you to,” Steve said, almost dryly.  “I’m gonna head back downstairs.”
“Can I get you something?” Steve asked.
Tony huffed in irritation.  The Nibiran to his immediate right paused, frowned at him, and hooted back, in warning.  With an apologetic nod to the Nibiran, Tony leaned into Stovok’s shoulder to explain, “Think I found a curse word.”
Rumors abounded that dragon scales were, in their late stages, made of actual gold.  Tony doubted it—dragon hides were far tougher than soft, malleable gold—but looking at his big beautiful nightmare, sprawled elegantly in the grass, he could not help but think that maybe he was spun of gold, after all.  Slowly growing into it.

“I suppose,” Barton allowed.
all the way back to the hotel.
Stovok glared at him, then looked down at the fruit.  He took it and took a careful, almost delicate bite.  Then he grimaced, an unexpectedly deep expression, and Tony laughed.
“It appears to have been stripped of its crust,” Stovok summarized.
“Thought I’d go blind,” Steve admitted, apropos of nothing.  “In the machine.  It was so bright.  Like—falling into the sun.”
“Owie,” Tony moaned, in a masculine, dignified fashion, lying on a lounge chair.  “I’m dying, Steve.”
The golden dragon did not even look at him as he crouched and leaped into the sky.

He did not grasp the danger of hunting dragons until he met a real Nightmare.
“Is it too late to sit on the roof?” speak-of-the-devil asked, squashed into the window by Thor’s bulk.  Thor had taken up the middle seat in the rear—of his own volition, miraculously, despite offers to sit in the front.  “Does the King sit at the front of the carriage,” he had jested, “or the very center?”
, you’re out,” Tony insisted.  “What kind of American are you?”
“Any kind.”
Thor crushed Steve’s shoulder a little more, then released him and stepped up to guard third base.
“Eleanor Roosevelt.”
I wish to keep myself out of the narrative as much as possible, so I'll simply state my health has been less than outstanding, but I have triumphed this day to present you this chapter!
“This is what you wanted,” Steve reminded him.  “Isn’t it?”  He looked at Tony.

“I can do whatever I

Tony waited, as impatiently as possible, before finally crawling back over to the cave entrance.  He frowned.  “Where’s Steve?” he asked immediately.
“All I need is six numbers.”
“Focus, gentlemen,” Carter advised.  “While it would be advantageous for the Klingons to remain where the Federation dare not follow, it would be equally advantageous for us to know our enemy.  And it has come to our attention that the area may not be uninhabited.  We would like to know who occupies the territory, if they have ties to the Klingons, and if so, what their ambitions are.”
Tony hiccupped again warningly.
.  “Steven Grant!”
About-facing slowly, he held still as she walked towards him, taller at the shoulder than he was fully upright.
No matter: Tony took another scalding gulp of coffee, then scrubbed his bloodshot eyes with a hand.  “If you don’t shut those curtains,” he warned, his voice low, raspy, and very serious, and Steve thought about denying him, but then remembered a long-ago piece of advice,
“Shh,” Tony hushed, kneeling in the dirt.  “I’m having a moment.  Let me have it.”

He jerked upright just in time to be forcefully sucked out of existence, reappearing in the comparatively blinding white light of a standard teleporter room.

“Where’s my birthday kiss?” Clint pouted, then took off with a yelp matching Lucky’s as Natasha gave chase.  “Uncle, Uncle!”
“You’re just a celebrity everywhere you go, aren’t you?”

He moved slower than he used to, slower still without the cane, but he kept pace with her as she padded down the hall.  He even slid the glass door open for her.
“You two are gross,” Clint said, getting up.  “I need more booze.”
Stovok actually wrinkled his nose, then smoothed his own expression deliberately.
When Tony opened his eyes and saw a world without dragons, he wept.
Stovok stared him down.  Tony could almost see the colors of his thoughts—the orange of frustration, the violet of his rigid moral code.  He stopped himself from reaching up to confirm his suspicions.  “The sooner we comply, the sooner you may return,” Stovok negotiated calmly.

Tony snorted shamelessly, then said, “New York did

“Don’t be a Puritan.  You’re not even driving.  Try it.”

Natasha and Clint had opted to sit inside the diner, taking advantage of their status as the least recognizable Avengers—
That was not even a lie, but Tony just said, “Do you want me to leave you with these
Footsteps approached.  Steve knew Stark Senior’s lopsided gait well.  Perpetually off-kilter, Howard seemed to luxuriate in stumbling around drunkenly before dazzling a crowd with his brilliance.  He was so good he could afford to be a fool.
His work with antimatter was only second to his work on dark matter and energy.  He had made many friends throughout the Federation by spreading the celestial good news: they were in the infancy stages of harnessing it, for travel, leisure, and commercial use, and he was going to help them get to full capacity in his lifetime.
Downing his drink proved an unwise error: Tony was fuzzy-headed when Steve materialized in front of him, between one blink and the next.  “You okay?” Steve asked.

family—so deep in his own head he barely looked out the window and wondered about the people on the streets—and caught up to Thor.  “You didn’t tell me about the storm you got caught up in,” Steve prompted, and Thor tossed a companionable arm around his shoulders, as though to arrest Steve’s ability to abandon the story midway, and said jovially:
“Captain Carter’s
Stovok and Tony exchanged a look.
“Patrolled,” Stovok repeated, with enough incredulity to convey doubt.
, but Rico was wetter than an otter.  “Yes,” he said.
“You’re welcome to enforce the rules,” Tony called out to Steve, ever-the-provocateur.
Then he turned around and returned to Tony, who could barely say, “Idiot,” around the lump in his throat.  “What if they need you?”
.  He tried taking a half-step backwards, which finally jarred him enough to gasp in a breath.
He got up.  He shut the curtains.  Tony sighed tersely.
See, if it had been
Thor grinned, a very intimidating close-mouthed grin.  Even sharks knew better than to mess with that smile.  “You are a very strange little man,” Thor declared, skewering a forkful of French toast and devouring it.  Tony made a stomped on sound.  Thor went on, “I like these,” as he shoveled in more French toast.  “What do your people call them, Pop-Tarts?”
“I can’t,” Tony blurted out.
Yet the more reasons Happy listed—
There was a moment of silence.

, this is what I don’t want, and I’m too selfish to chase myself off.”  He tried to push halfheartedly at Steve’s side, but Steve held on.  “Who is this damn scared of losing something they already have?”
Clint ran like a hound: for the first two miles, he moved as though the wind were in his sails and he had no choice but to accept where it pushed him.
will ever—”
Eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, Steve refused to let his past feelings for Chicago set the stage for future disappointment.  He had already been disappointed by New York.  Every change felt like a childhood monument, torn down and replaced with something ugly.  Even if the original had been ugly, the loss of it stung, a cultural touchstone eroded by time.  The idea that he might lose the memory of Chicago, too, made something twist in his gut.  “What’s in Chicago?” he finally asked, half-hoping the answer would be
“You can’t be serious,” Happy said, but Tony was clearly not listening as Happy listed off the many reasons why they could not, under any circumstances, go to Alaska.  And to think, Steve mused, Happy did not even know they were banned from driving across the Canadian border with Clint in tow.
“Good dog,” Steve said, taking the shoe from Jeremiah’s mouth and holding it out to Tony, who had put ground between them.  “Aw, don’t be such a sourpuss,” Steve called after him, patting Jeremiah’s side and sitting up.  “C’mon, let’s go get the other one,” he instructed, gesturing with the shoe.  “Go get.”  Jeremiah loped off at a joyful jog.
Carter looked around his bunk room—it wasn’t much, but it was his space home—and frowned.  “Where is Commander Stovok?” she asked.
“Bah,” Hulk said, which would have been funny, had he not then decided to leap onto the car and smash it into a pancake.  When the Hulk had finished, he sat down right on top of the flat metal and looked sternly at Steve.
“Yes,” Tony said, which was clearly a
Bruce shook his head, but Thor insisted, “Come, I shall show you my quarters,” and Bruce had no choice but to follow.
Steve cupped them in both his own.  “Sure thing, pal,” he said.

Tony ribbed him: “But did I

Tony scowled.  “

“Thank you,” Steve said, smiling a little at the smell of her perfume.
He was stiff from sitting in the same position for so long when Tony showed up.  If he did not move, he thought, then he did not have to acknowledge or face reality.  Then Tony leaned against him, despite the roominess of the bench.  When Steve did not move, he leaned in more.
With the tactfulness of a bull elephant, Steve announced, “You’ve been in a coma for four months.”  Tony reeled.  He was glad he was already lying down.  Steve asked with the sort of frank compassion characteristic of his time as Leader of the Avengers, “You want a glass of water?”
So far—so good.  The shield had made it with him through the ice.
“I’m serious.”
“Something we could all use a little more of,” Tony said, which made Steve give him a funny look, like maybe Tony was odd to him, too, and Tony finished off his own balled-up cookie.
“I will not entrust prey with my armor,” Thor said stoutly.
Steve huffed in disgust.  “Little late for that, son,” he started, but Tony secured a grip around his wrist and
“All right, Clint, state your full name and intention for the record.”
.  “I’m fine,” he insisted gruffly.  “It’s fine.”
Although he moved more gingerly than he had before Marker entered his life, he announced buoyantly, “Never gets old.”
Waving a hand dismissively, Tony said, “Okay, but—”
, Steve thought, shimmying through narrow icy lockers, barely wide enough to draw a breath in, listening intently for the shuffle of Natasha’s footsteps ahead.
“Get the ball,” Steve advised, a bit breathless but otherwise unharmed, gesturing at Clint.
“I’m hurt.”
“Gosh, that is easier,” Tony said, in the tone of one taking notes on the side, pulling out a chair.  Leery though he was about setting down the shield, Steve did the same, resting the shield against his own knee and surveying the wreckage of Thor’s breakfast, ignoring an errant inquiry from his own stomach.
“Say no more,” Tony instructed.  Bruce quailed.  Tony said: “You know we can’t take any of them home with us, right?”
“Intonation and intention often matter more than precise linguistic adherence,” Stovok replied.
Just as he was about to return downstairs to enjoy some real peace-and-quiet, Steve spotted a familiar figure on the balcony.
Huffing privately at the argument—Steve had stuffed newspapers in his own ratty shoes for years to make them work, but one scuff and Tony Stark’s threw in the towel—Steve moved down a short hallway, all self-contained, and paused outside an expansive balcony.  After a moment’s hesitation, he slid the door open.
“You don’t smoke,” Steve observed.
Then he shut his eyes and feigned sleep.
They braved the frigid waters to shake the mud loose, then retreated to the high ground.
“Make me.”
Tony shook his head, pacing the length of the room, refusing to accept the facts.  Out loud, he said, “Stovok isn’t stupid.  Thor might be, but he’s not going down without a fight.  Hell, I bet the Klingons would be begging us to take them off their hands, if they could.”  Smiling grimly at the thought—he had seen what Thor could do—he added, “If they’re not outnumbered twenty to one, they’re alive.”
“Can’t,” Natasha replied, as Steve tried, automatically, fingers scrambling over the armor near Iron Man’s shoulders, throat, looking for a way out, because c’mon, c’mon,
.  Steve didn’t know.  He kept stroking for a while, feeling the weight of the half-man, half-monster in his lap.
He marveled at how easy it was to drive, compared to the temperamental roadsters he was used to.  Push of a button, really—it was no wonder Tony was so distracted behind the wheel, given how automatic the process had become.
Until it endangered his life.
Steve heard the crack and flinched; Tony liberated Happy’s gun in a surprisingly quick movement, and for a moment Steve thought they really were on the same team, taking down a bad guy, but then Tony pointed the gun at the floor and ground out, “Not another
“Mm?”
Thor growled.  “I shall remove your head from your shoulders if you speak to me again in this manner.”
“I like my hair,” Steve said coolly.
. o .
Thor laughed, a big, one-sided, but not unkind laugh, reminding Steve of a sailor about to cast off with his ship, a man who had no tethers to the ground Tony Stark’s feet were so firmly planted on.  “Do not trouble yourself with the meddling of the gods, Stark,” Thor dismissed, waving a big hand.  “Besides—you have an empire to rule here, do you not?”
When Tony did not produce them, Steve understood it was a joke.  “You’re lying,” he accused, slightly more pointedly than he intended.
Slowly, grudgingly, he sat in a chair and rasped to J.A.R.V.I.S., “Send him in.”
. o .
“What happened?” Tony asked, horrified, as Steve gripped his own neck, rummaging around haphazardly in the cupboards.  Actinium was sniffing the blood on the floor, and Tony noticed the red around his jaw.  “Oh, fuck,” he rasped.
,” the hatchling screeched in utter peril.
“Correct,” Tony lied.
, Steve thought, shaking his head morosely.
,” Steve insisted.  “I know it hurts.  But you can’t find peace here.  You can’t find peace in giving up.  This isn’t surrender.  This is oblivion.”  Steve stood his ground but urged softly, “Come down with me.”
Owned by Peugeot, the Onyx was listed as a coupe—a two-door, closed-roof—concept car.  Steve frowned.  “What’s a concept car?” he asked.
“. . . Right.”  Looking around, Tony pointed in a cardinal direction and stated, “Those mountains.  Not gonna climb themselves.”
Thor took a seat at the table.  The Ba’ku stared.
P.S. No, Tony's outfit isn't "stupid," but this is rigid narrator Steve's perspective, and he is delightful. For those wondering, I modeled Steve's look on
“Don’t do too nice a job, I want a memento,” Tony instructed, pulling his arm away before Dr. Banner could spray the wound down, erase the memory.
Tony shook his head, woozy but eager to get up, go,
It hurt a lot to scrape his chest over the rock, but then he was halfway out, his torso in the open air.  Some indelicate maneuvering and he twisted and fell on his side, gasping sharply.  He hunched in on himself for a moment, wounded, gripping his chest over the scar tissue of the long-gone reactor.
The fissure ahead was empty.  Seeing it made him dizzy, dreading the task ahead.  The others were out of sight.
, thank you.  He squeezed Steve hard enough to hurt anyone who wasn’t pumped full of super-soldier serum and stayed exactly where he was.
The music looped back on itself, louder than before, drowning out the rest of Tony’s tirade.
Huffing, Steve said, “Don’t got nothing to sulk about.”
Tony tried to watch him, but the boy and the Vulcan disappeared around the corner.  Romanova chatted pleasantly with Anij and another woman who stood near Anij’s shoulder and asked her own questions about the
Nine states, three time zones, and four-and-a-half flight-hours later, the Avengers landed in Seattle.
“Do you have a dragon?” Clint apparently could not help but prompt.
“It is not ideal,” Stovok admitted tersely.  “Running—does me no favors.”
“I offered,” Clint offered.
, Howard Stark had said, after Steve had swallowed and unswallowed a bucket of seawater.
Huffing, Tony sat back down and said, “Now you sound like Bruce.”
“I could take you,” Clint insisted.
. o .
“Were you there?” Tony said at last.
Tony seethed out a wordless hiss, like he could not bring himself to even come up with a word vile enough for Steve or “the cat.”  “I’ll be back,” Steve assured.
No, the trepidation only started when he saw Thor standing alone on the ice, looking down into an icy blue gap with a smile on his face. . . .
“No,” Tony said stubbornly.
He heard Rhodey sigh.  He sniffed once, tried to rally enough to say,
them, I helped you
,” Tony ordered.
“You’re insatiable,” Steve told him.
“Indeed it is,” Anij agreed.  “We gathered those willing to leave Earth in pursuit of a true sanctuary.”
Tony stepped forward, clasped an arm around his shoulders, and echoed firmly, “Ice cream.”
“Intuition,” Natasha replied.
He let it go, looking around the room.  Carol Danvers stood near the door, offering him a two-fingered salute.  He tried to mirror it automatically, his right arm stiff, mechanical, more rot than flesh.  “Urk,” he said eloquently.
Steve said, “I’ll be back,” and dared to abandon Tony with his journal as he refilled the slot in the machine.  The hose sprayed Thor in the face, but he laughed in uproarious contentment, then sprayed the Hulk, who thumped the ground emphatically in delight.
The thought of seeing the hatchlings again finally drove Tony to move, standing on sore legs, retreating to the cool interior.  Steve watched him from a respectful distance, like he was a dragon.  He found Tellurium, the one and only bronze, curled up on a couch, chin on the arm.
Contrary to popular lore, Captain America was
“See, I subscribe to the art of not giving a fu—”
Steve said grimly, “I think I have an idea.”  He slid back the door, stepped inside the penthouse.
“Big dumb lug,” Tony greeted, letting an arm flop over the side of the bed.  Marker nosed at it, scales warm and smooth, breath hot on his sleeve.  “Can’t go five minutes without me.  How’d you make it six months, huh?”
Tony lingered for a long moment, tempted to snarl back, show him
, I will break into your home and—”
“You’ve got money,” Tony impressed.
Shaking his head, Steve rummaged around in his nightstand drawer, then pulled out a folded up newspaper and a pencil.  He flipped to the appropriate page and asked, “Five letter word for
Steve said, “. . . Let’s get outta here before this gets any more out of hand.”
“It has been . . . a long time since I have taken a leave-of-absence.  So much has happened.  So few of my people have volunteered their services.”  Inclining his head, he acknowledged, “Yet, there are others, who could serve in the roles.”
