He's not sorry. Bucky brings back girls often enough and is never quiet. And then suddenly Bucky laughs;
Then Tony enters him. It’s a glorious pressure inside of him. Steve feels full, so full, and even through the condom Tony feels so warm, and God, how he moves, how he moves, graceful and fluid, rolling his hips a little on each thrust, and it’s so, so good, Steve’s insides lightening up with pleasure at each stroke.
Steve wonders why they’re whispering, but it feels like if they’d talk out loud, something would break. He shakes his head.
“Thank you,” Tony murmured, his voice rough.
“The second time, was when I fought the Mandarin. I killed defending my life, so it’s not really that I wanted to kill, more like I had no choice. And then Pepper fell. I thought she had died. I wanted to kill him, I tried to. In the end, Pepper’s the one who managed to. She became a murderer because of me.”
“That’s… I don’t get why the media call it like that. A fight between a few individuals does not make it a ‘war’. I would know, I’ve been in one.”
The wolf grinned, turned over, and swiftly disappeared in the bushes.
“Tony!” he cried, and he fumbled with his braid to hang it on the hook, and then hastily threw it out of the window.
“I… I didn’t talk to Sam. Actually, I even did a pretty good job at hiding to him how unwell I was. God, I myself couldn’t see how unwell I was until…well, until Bucky went back into cryo and I realized I had ripped apart our family. Until I had lost you. Until I had lost everything that still kept me going. I felt as if I were going crazy. Then… I asked Sam for help.”
“No. I don’t need help from something that doesn’t exist. We’re not lost, Butterhooves. C’mon, Dummy, let’s go!” snapped Tony, spurring his mount with his heels, but Dummy ignored him and kept munching more cloves.
All because of Tony Stark.
But when pulling one’s pigtails consisted in blaming them, trusting a former enemy over them, keeping the truth from them about the death of their parents for years, refusing to listen to them and to compromise just because, and bashing their face with the shield their father made, well…
“I’ve got you. Let go, Tony.”
Tony let him hold his hand, didn’t take it away. It was maybe the first time, since Siberia, that he let Steve touch him out of the Iron Man armor. Eventually, he tore his eyes off Steve’s, and lowered his head, staring at their linked hands.
And Tony could actually imagine it, having Steve there at the city with him. He could see them living together at the house he shared with Rhodey, Pepper, and her husband-to-be Happy. He could hear Steve’s kind and caring voice and his superb singing - he would sing in the house, in the church, in the nearby theater, and be admired and loved by everyone-, he could feel Steve’s affectionate hands on him, his lips pressing a gentle kiss on his mouth, his lithe body curl around Tony’s, he could see Steve’s pouting smile and tender cerulean eyes.
No repeats. Steve knows nothing’s going to happen, but strangely enough they’re still holding hands. It feels natural and comforting. Tony’s hand is warm, and still as rough as last time.
Why was he feeling so breathless? He had worked bare-chested plenty of times before, and furthermore he had never minded getting naked in front of other people, so why was it so embarrassing when it was Steve?
“Ah,” moaned Tony, “ah, more, mor-I mean, fuck you, fuck you very much, I’ll make you pay, you evil, evil bea-iiiiaaaahhh!!!”
To Tony’s astonishment, an incredibly long golden rope hanged out from the window and started uncoiling down until it reached the ground, and the Red Skull climbed up by it all the way up to the window.
Shit, now he looks like he’s flirting. And Steve always flirts the most awkwardly possible, so he must sound so awkward!
again if I can help it.”
“I love you,” gasped Tony, and he felt Steve shudder against him, inside him, his hips stuttering and then teeth sinking in his shoulder as the wolf-man moaned out, riding out his orgasm in a few more thrusts, harsher, deeper. Tony felt pleasure and semen flood his insides, and that was it -with a soft keen, he came again, spilling himself on the grass.
“Hi!” she said glowingly.
“Oh,” breathed Steve, halting his movement. He was about to hook his braid to the window. His thin, much too thin body seemed to tense, and then he swiftly hooked his braid, the gesture sudden, almost as if in anger. “Will you not visit anymore?”
Tony could hear everyone talking indistinctly from the hallway. He had brought them together, had coordinated everything within an inch of its life so that their response to the invasion would be swift and efficient. Steve knew that he would. He had called Tony when the first Outriders dropped onto Earth to warn him and then, once they realized the onslaught was happening simultaneously around the world, to work together to fight off what Tony had predicted from the very beginning would only be the first wave.
He hadn’t done a good job of it.
There were snowflakes catching in Steve’s eyelashes. They had been standing there for too long, reluctant to leave, savoring each second. Luxuriating in it. Time was a precious currency, but he would spend it all on Steve if he could.

His entire home, the only one he had in this new century, was with the Avengers.
“He put together a good team around him,” Rhodey said coolly.
The backs of his hands were chafed raw, and the skin around his knuckles was bright red where it had torn a little.
Peggy smiled, sad in a way that he never wanted her to be. She looked at him like that a lot now.
punch all your problems away.”
Loki betrayed them all.
In all the chaos that ensued after the Hydra spy had murdered Dr. Erskine and fled with him and Peggy hot on his tail, Steve had forgotten about his band. It laid there on the table, unharmed in all the wreckage and tinier than he remembered it to be. He scooped it up and cradled it in his palm.
He thought of how Steve had insisted that they take the train back and how he had doodled on his Metrocard with a blue ballpoint pen he had in his jacket pocket ten minutes into their wait before handing it to him.
“Tony, you have to go,” he said urgently. “Contact Strange and get the last Stone. I’ll hold them off as long as I can.”
It was old hat by now, this cycle of betrayal and abandonment. Let someone in. Let someone go. Rinse and repeat.
But really, they’re there because they’re the only active soldiers left on the team. They’re coordinating with what remains of the world’s militaries and the UN. There’s a light blinking insistently on the phone that FRIDAY muted to deliver the message; they’re supposed to be on a call with Ross.
Time stopped. Reality stopped. He was on the battlefield and somewhere else altogether. Somewhere no one else existed but him. There and everywhere. Everywhere and nowhere.
“What do you want from me?” He watched Steve’s throat work as if his words were all trapped inside.
He had always done that, Tony realized. Always looked at him that way, and he had never
Tony opened up the comms.
Her hands. Her hands that held his when she had seen his word, that had been warm and gentle and reassuring even as she spoke with a ferocity that Tony had never heard from her before. He almost felt them on him now, a phantom imprint from years past that time had never managed to fully wash away.
She trailed off and paused, staring up at him at the same time it dawned on him that he had made a fool out of himself and couldn’t back out now without looking even more stupid. Jan, Patsy, and Sam were crowded around him, blocking the only exit.
Steve let go of the mug and lowered his hand next to his.
There was nothing to change or fix.
One corner of Steve’s mouth quirked up. “That and some more. You’d be surprised.”
Later, as the Quinjet coasted through the empty sky, high above the desolate landscape of Siberia and farther and farther away from Tony, Steve thought of the slim metal band Tony still had had on when he had told Steve that he and Pepper were no longer together, the one that he had always worn and never once taken off for as long as Steve had known him.
A veil he hadn’t known was there lifted, and beyond it he could see all the infinite possibilities, each one a jewel glimmering with potential. There was no way he could pick one. It was like choosing a star out of the sky except that he could see to the ends of the universe, to the ends of time, every single star that had ever existed, that existed, that would exist. He could go back. Save his parents. Save Barnes.
The dull ache in his head was going to flare up into a full-blown migraine. He pressed his knuckles into his eyes, trying to focus on that pain instead of the one inside his skull.
She’s not sure how Pepper will take this. She doesn’t know how Pepper feels about what happened with the Accords or what Tony, Jim, or Vision might have told her. She hasn’t seen Pepper at the compound since they came back from Wakanda.
Steve tensed, the cords of muscle at his wrist jumping as Tony curled his hand around it, and when Tony looked down, he understood why. There were his words in his own writing, etched into Steve’s skin, a wound inflicted by his own hand.
“We need to talk,” Steve said after they had watched the squabble on the grounds peter out. The way he was so apologetic, so tentative as though Tony would cave in at the slightest push, grated on Tony’s nerves.
“I love him, and I never told him that either. You’d think I’d learn.”
This was Steve choosing him.
Maybe he had confirmed Steve’s worst fears. Maybe Steve was right not to trust him.
There was no answer.
Steve, Tony thought as he had caught the Gauntlet in the air. Steve, he thought as he assembled it. If there ever was a physical embodiment of that sort of resolve, it was Steve.
“You didn’t miscalculate anything, and you aren’t going to. You’re the smartest man I know, Tony,” Steve said steadily. “And you’ve been working on this for years. We’re prepared as we can be. We have a good system set in place.”
He hadn’t thought about his soulmate since then, too busy trying to survive basic to think of anything else. But it was the night before he would receive the serum, and in the peace and quiet of the empty room with everyone still at dinner, he found himself dwelling on his words again. He guessed that it made sense. He wasn’t sure what would happen tomorrow. Wasn’t sure if he would be a different man. Wasn’t sure if he would live to see the end of the day.
The feeling was intimately familiar now, but at the time he had assumed that he fell on his arm the wrong way when he had passed out, until he turned over his arm like he did now and—
She thinks about forgiveness and about love. She thinks about the gifts Tony gave her over the years and the ones he continued to make for her after she left.
“I know.”
Jim confirms her thoughts. “You get used to it,” he says. “I can’t even remember how many times I almost lost Tony over the past thirty years. He always pulls through no matter what. You never know how he’ll manage to until he does, but he does.”
Steve stroked his cheek with his thumb as if he could hear his thoughts, and if Tony nestled closer to him, well, no one seemed to know who they were or if they did, they didn’t give a damn. They were either too tired or too polite to interrupt them.
He told himself that he wasn’t avoiding Steve. He had made no pretenses at friendship; he spoke to him when it was necessary and that was it. That should have been fine. They were teammates. They didn’t need to be anything more than that. He had forgotten all the workplace rules—keep your work life separate from your personal life, don’t shit where you eat—but Siberia and the Accords, Steve’s goddamn letter, were a reminder he wouldn’t forget.
“Steve, America was one of the last bidders standing. America,” Sam said at the same time Patsy exclaimed, “You thought I was fighting for
He stood there, plates and utensils in hand, his mouth parted in shock. Natasha was behind him, carrying an assortment of fruit and crackers, unruffled.
Never before had Steve wished the ground would open up and swallow him as much as he did now.
The question landed between Tony’s shoulder blades, a fragile whisper of gossamer silk connecting him to Steve. One sudden move, he knew, and it would rip. It would slide down his back like water and float to the ground, leaving Steve unmoored.
There were going to be bad days for a while, ones that would take them by surprise, would saddle him with doubt and anger, with grief and pain. There would be days when Steve would reach out and hold him in his arms, and he wouldn’t be able to answer back. He wasn’t sure when they would stop, when that day would come. But he had to believe it would and that there would be good days in between and ever after too. Days when they would be in bed together, kissing promises against each other’s skin, leaving marks of love to accompany their scars. Days when they would be so intertwined with each other that they wouldn’t know where one of them ended and the other began. Days when they would just lie there, holding hands, making new meanings for the words on their wrists.
Months later, Tony proves her right.
“Do you know you love him?” she wanted to ask before and on the run and when the team split over the Accords and when Tony stepped down after Ultron. When they said their goodbyes, lingering on the grounds, not too far from where they are now. When they shared a room without fuss at Clint’s house, still gravitating towards each other despite their anger and distrust. All the way back to when they brought down a leftover Hydra base, the first time the team was a cohesive unit, every piece snapping into place, each of them a part of a seamless whole.
Rhodey frowned at the phone as he wheeled himself over.
,” he ended, his voice raw.
Rhodey rolled his eyes and nodded, almost imperceptibly, to the side.
“What’s all the—oh Cap, you’re back.” Patsy poked her head out of her room as if the cheese wheel had called to her—or maybe it was Jan’s shriek that had sounded the alarm. “Hey, could I try some? I’ve been waiting for Professor Pym to let you guys out to ask.” She pursed her lips at Sam’s snort. “Okay, the past three weeks,” she conceded as she walked over.
He knew what Peggy was asking. It was the same question Natasha asked under all her suggestions.
The sky above them is whole; there’s no tin man falling out of the sky. Tony’s trapped beyond the wormhole he never truly came back from, and countless have been slain by an alien wielding impossible power.
He should have kept the tower except it was much harder to ignore what happened in a city halved and gripped by chaos.
Steve skimmed the dark purple bruise under Tony’s eye, then his cheek, and then his neck. Tony’s pulse beat steadily under his fingers where he held him, and Steve finally caved in on himself, unable to hold himself up any longer. He rested his forehead against Tony’s and shut his eyes, falling forward, falling into him.
His heart squeezed painfully as he wondered where his father’s was. It probably had been melted down or taken and handed down in another family. Or maybe it was on display in a museum or private collection somewhere like most of his belongings were nowadays. Nothing that used to be his was his to have anymore, it seemed.
“You don’t deserve it,” he said because he wanted to hurt Steve enough to push him away.
Bloodthirsty aliens, scattered Avengers, limited resources and time—everything that had to do with war, he had accounted for. What he hadn’t planned for was the dread keeping his feet locked in place, preventing him from entering a room in the compound that was more his home than it had been most of the group’s in the past two years or, in some cases, ever.
His answer was the same regardless.
“I remember a lot of arm-wrestling that says otherwise.” Tony grew serious again, nervously picking at the gold circle lining the edge of the plate as if he could peel it off. “You seemed kinda nervous about it after you won so I thought the least I could do was show you what it pairs well with when you got it. But I get it if it’s awkward so I can just go.”
Tony was forever trapped in that moment in Steve’s mind, in that space between two decisions, the space before an action that never happened, that would never happen.
Steve was lying. He was dressed in a plain T-shirt and worn sweatpants, home clothes or PJs, not his workout gear. Tony hated himself for knowing the difference.
He should be angrier at Steve. He had a right to be, and anger was acceptable, useful unlike moping around like this. But he was never capable of holding onto anger for too long and the times he did, the times he let it take over him, he always regretted it. He thought of Barnes trying to escape, of Barnes lying dazed on the floor, his arm a jagged stump. Of Steve struggling to defend himself.
“Why won’t you fight for me?” he wanted to shout, and he was furious at the thought. He didn’t want this, he reminded himself viciously. It shouldn’t matter. He should be relieved that Steve wasn’t expecting anything.
A loud cry rent the air, and Tony’s pulse quickened.
If he couldn’t extract Tony from himself, he would sow himself in Tony, growing and killing and eventually consuming him whole. What he had for Tony would bloom like tumors in him, a constant reminder that never let him forget what he had done to Steve.
This close, he still radiated the heat that came with sleep, and there was the faintest shadow of stubble coloring his jaw and neck. He had clearly woken up just moments ago even if he somehow looked put-together at—Tony shot a glance at the clock on the far wall—4:30 in the morning.
“All right, we don’t need them,” Tony replied swiftly. He still looked unhappy.
But that was all right.
“When did you even get that?”
Steve didn’t dream and when he did, he didn’t remember.
, a distant part of his mind said, and if he could feel anything at all or rather, stop from feeling too much, maybe he would be a bit hysterical, the way he was all those years ago, when they had been in the lab and he shouted about the real game up there and Steve had said, with a resoluteness that was infuriating, that they would do it together.
For a minute, none of them know what to say. They don’t know if Tony gave them information about his ship to track him down and rescue him or to bring him home for burial.
Even when stripped of everything that everyone assumed made him Tony Stark but was, in reality, just one side of him, Tony was dazzling, larger than life.
Tony could imagine him sitting in the kitchen after he left him, insomnia his only company as he watched the sun rise over the city and faced the long stretch of the day ahead.
Tony remembered his face contorted beyond recognition, the silver edge of the shield swinging down like a guillotine. A tremor ran far underground, through his heart and his words.
He should get this over with. He couldn’t avoid him the entire night, but after some warm-up with the worst of the bunch, the people he missed the most and the people who missed him the least, he would have enough practice in being cordial and keeping his emotions in check. And it could well be that Steve was talking to someone else or that he would be too far away to catch his eye.
He held out his hands, feeling like he had fallen apart and pieces of him had flung everywhere.
Steve pulled out the chair beside him. It felt like both a command and an invitation. Tony walked over, through the too big kitchen, where Wanda and Vision used to try recreating the dishes from Wanda’s childhood once a week, Wanda and Vision who were d—
Tony didn’t reply right away and when he finally did, he laughed, all the tension leaking out of him. “God, to think that out of the two of us, I’d be Mr. Traditional and you’d be the one who’s all for eloping to Vegas.”
She had wanted to pull Steve out of there; it was no place for the living and despite all odds, despite how Steve may have felt, he wasn’t dead yet. But all she managed to do was open the door an inch and wriggle through the crack, letting some light and air follow her in, hoping that would be enough to coax him out.
He supposed he shouldn’t have fixated on that when there was so much else Steve was and wasn’t saying, but if he were Steve’s soulmate, Steve would mention it, wouldn’t he? He had the right to know. Especially now, after everything.
“You’re breakin’ the ribs,” he said under his breath with a short laugh.
What had he said? You get killed, walk it off.
Tony looked away, his throat constricting painfully.
“Simple, huh?” Tony stared at him for a long moment before his face softened, the earlier affection, so dazzling in its strength, mellowing into something more tender, something deeper. “Yeah, I think I can do simple,” he said and as he leaned forward to kiss Steve softly, the swatch he had been holding lay next to his knees, forgotten.
He pushed just as hard, his mind bursting into flames, breaking apart with the effort until he and the Stones pushed against each other so hard that they both slipped to the side, to a third option, to the Stones disseminating to the farthest, most inhospitable and unreachable places of the universe, away from one another and away from everyone else in time and in space.
He looked at Bucky, who held his gaze steadily, cautiously, and remembered the day his words had appeared. He remembered the way he had been so excited to show them to his mother, the way he had asked her what she thought they meant and she had told him, happier than he had ever seen her be, that someone loved him very much.
“Tony,” Steve called out.
“Yes,” he said, his voice quietly breaking. “Every time.”
Tony stopped in the middle of the storm to watch Steve from a distance. With no one paying him any attention and Steve deep in concentration as he conversed with Wilson and Natasha, he allowed himself the luxury to scan every inch of Steve, to memorize his face and preserve him exactly the way he was in his mind. This was how he wanted to remember Steve—in his element, seeming to thrum with more energy than he had had in days now that he could actively try to stop Thanos, alert, focused, and unhurt.
There it was. The judgment.
The thing about soulmates was that there wasn’t any guarantee that you would meet them. Steve had known that since he was young, had had it drilled into him by his doctor and all the kids at school and in the neighborhood. He had always known that it was possible that he would die before he met his soulmate. All that had changed from then to now were the circumstances; instead of illness, it was the war that could do him in before he did.
“Here’s your indisputable proof,” she seemed to say as she had brushed her thumb over his word, but his mother had never been a scientist. Indisputable proof meant it was tried and tested, and it never had been, until now.
He doesn’t have powers and he isn’t the strongest of them all, but Steve considered him Earth’s best defender for a reason and so does she.
Steve was stricken, but he managed to smooth out his expression, swallowing hard as he did so.
He could hold Steve’s hand and kiss him whenever he wanted without having it turn into a spectacle, without the world weighing in on something that belonged to just the two of them.
Tony was floating, drifting out of his own body as though his mind couldn’t handle the terror, the grief, the onslaught of fathomless, virulent self-hatred.
His shield is still locked away. He knows where it is. He knows the password. Tony didn’t change it. Natasha tested it. She didn’t know whether to laugh or grieve over that or that neither he nor Steve have unlocked the vault since the shield was put into storage when she asks FRIDAY when it was last accessed.
They could work with something.
How often did he do that? His injuries would be gone in less than a day; he could push himself harder than Tony could because his body would reset like he was some kind of reverse Fight Club Cinderella.
“How is he?” Jim asks somberly as she drops her bag onto the couch and then drops onto it next to him too.
Of course. Rhodey had known his word since MIT.
“You’re good with kids,” Steve said after a while.
They all had. Including Steve.
To enjoy the art in all its beauty, click it to see it in full size.
“I know,” he said because of that. “But I want to.”
Tony snorted and Steve was distracted from his thoughts for a moment. “Nice, quiet time. Just like middle school and high school, right? I swear, half the time I thought you liked getting beaten up. Couldn’t figure out whether you had a death wish or a kink.” His mouth tilted as he tried to keep a straight face. “Maybe both?”
“You didn’t.”
Steve dropped a kiss on his forehead before returning his embrace. They stayed like that, unmoving, Steve resting his cheek on top of his head, no one paying them any attention.
talked about this for a while, and a familiar voice came from behind him before he could speak, banishing all thought from his mind.
When he did dream, the few that he had were weightless.
Winter thawed. He was a frozen river finally shattered, everything pouring out of him through the cracks of the icy surface, overflowing.
for Steve,
“I guess I’m used to it,” he replied, but both of them knew what the other was saying between the lines. A lifetime later in a world much different from the one they had last been in together, they still understood each other so well.
God. Of all the people to make it, she thinks, but cockroaches can survive just about anything.
He stared at Peggy’s note, trying to analyze the shape of every letter with such close attention that Dum Dum elbowed his side as he walked past the table, a teasing smirk lifting his bushy mustache.
Steve could see it clearly. Tony staring down at the screen, conflicted and indecisive. Tony about to make his decision when the commotion on the streets grabbed his attention.
, he didn’t say.
Better the death of his heart than the death of his soul, his own death over the deaths of others. But he hadn’t had to choose in the end. Anger always won out for him, and it had cremated his love for Tony. Anger was what he turned to when he had nothing, and it was all he was.
He focused on unlocking each layer with surgical precision. The fight outside had diminished to white noise as time stretched, infinite in the darkness, broken only by the light of the arc reactor; only he and the box existed in this pocket universe he had fallen into and nothing else. Three down, two to go.
It was too small to fit around his wrist anymore.
He could do nothing. He owed Steve nothing. Steve knew that.
He was asking Tony to take a leap of faith.
Give me a solution. Show me something that I didn’t think of before. A different angle. You’re always good at that,
He was 22, after all, and in a year, he would be 23, then 24, then 25.
“Yeah?” he asked, that one word so radiant with hope that he didn’t stand a chance of hiding it.
A second chance. A new beginning.
And Steve had always responded.
It didn’t make it any easier to let him go.
“Best I could do,” Tony grunted as they landed roughly; one of his boot thrusters had given out, throwing him off balance as they went to ground.
“I know, but I meant it. Every word,” Steve says, straightforward like it’s the truth. Like he can make it so, whatever he says he’ll do, by willpower alone.
Touching wrists, soul mark against soul mark, holding their wrist against your chest. A tried-and-true method of calming your soulmate.
“But if we—”
“I got it,” he choked out. “Steve—”
Something always came out of the losses, however devastating they were, and because of that he picked himself up and jumped into the next fight over and over again.
But he saw everything now because he learned to and because Tony let him, because Tony felt safe around him to slow down, to drop every single one of his defenses.
“I should go,” Tony said after a beat. “Got a meeting in a few minutes.”
“Yeah, you told me. Black eye, broken nose, blood dripping from my mouth with Schmidt towering over me, and I was the prettiest thing you’d ever seen.”
He had hated how Tony looked, his megawatt smile flickering before turning bright again, but awkward and pasted on this time.
“I didn’t know until I lost my chance, but I was. I need you to know that,” he continues, quieter but no less emphatic. He takes a step forward, closing the remaining distance between them. “Steve,” he whispers, echoing everything Steve said in his name back to him, and when he curls his hand around the crook of Steve’s arm, Steve shakes apart like Atlas forgiven, an earthquake trembling through him as he’s finally permitted to lay the heavens at his feet and rest.
“Sorry, darling,” murmurs Tony, kissing him. “This kind of thing, you’ve got to explore it by yourself first.”
Steve was the one who broke the oppressive silence again;
“I didn’t-”
“I mind,” blurted out Steve, internally cursing himself for how insensitive that came out. However, Tony fell silent and scrunched up his nose, but didn’t get angry. He waited for him to go on.
“You beast, get off me!” he protested, a bit weaker.
Tony’s staring right back at him, eyes wide and entranced, and his cheeks are still dusted with a blush when he nods, swallows, and answers in a rough voice;
Then on the next happening Tiberius had demanded to fuck his mouth, Tony had called him a disgusting fag, and they had never talked again apart from their usual competitive interactions. Tony hadn’t regretted it; Tiberius had always been a douche anyway, always trying to prove himself to be better than Tony (which he hadn’t been, and would never be). Tony and his friends had become grown-ups, Tony got popular with the women, and grown men did not seek each other for ‘services’ anymore.
Steve’s assault on his pleasure spot had been relentless, nearly too much, and now his tongue was there again alongside his fingers, and, and, and—
“I’m fine.”
it. Fuck, sugar, screw my rules, let’s have a repeat.”
He kisses Tony’s nape one last time. Shudders. Comes. Keeps going, slowly, slowly, riding out his orgasm as long as he can.
Tony felt a weight against his hole, bigger than Steve’s fingers, and he breathed in, bracing himself.
“In a minute!” replied Tony, and he hastily washed himself with the soap. The soap gave out a fresh, non-floral scent, that reminded him of Steve. Strangely enough, the idea of smelling like Steve made something warm unfurl in his chest, and Tony pushed that disturbing thought away from his mind -it didn’t stop the warmth from spreading through his chest, especially when, opening the basket, he found inside his perfectly folded clothes smelling the same fresh scent than Steve’s. He quickly dried himself with the towel which had been hanging next to the bathtub, and then he slipped into his clean clothes, admiring how neat they looked.
“Yes, I’m the tinkerer. Tony. Nice to meet you. I’m looking for a place to stay, obviously.”
“Let’s stop with the colors, really, let’s just stop pretending I don’t want it,” muttered Tony. “End of the game. I want it, please tell me I’m the most beautiful man you’ve ever seen and you’re over the moon with me. Get it? Moon? Werewolf? I’m so funny.”
Tony smiles to him, and it’s the most beautiful thing on Earth.
“Hey, Steve”, she greets.
Industries after all, not
Voice deliberately neutral, just as it had been during the whole time they had fought together, on the same side for the first time in years. While the Infinity Wars had brought the Avengers back together for Earth’s survival, their gathering had been but a necessity -it hadn’t mended any of Steve and Tony’s burnt bridges-.
“Yeah. I lost my parents just before Christmas. I usually drink myself sick on the anniversary of their death, but I’ve been trying to be sober. I fail on that date, every year. So this year I thought… I thought I could do sex instead. But… I didn’t think I’d hook up with someone like you. I already liked your spirit, but when I saw your art… I just knew. You’re amazing, Steve. And… dating you would be a disaster and it would end in heartbreak. I don’t want that.”
“I don’t suppose I can ask an artist to destroy their own work…” he sighs.
“Merry Christmas,” murmurs Steve against Tony’s lips, and he feels him smile.
He knew that until the day he died that he would never forget what it felt like ramming his shield through Tony’s chest. He would always remember the way the arc reactor crunched under his shield, cracking open in a way that it was never meant to, the way he had known that he would have shattered through bone with frightening ease had he gone any further.
“Oh.”
It made Steve think, these days, of the state of Tony’s lungs. His ravaged failure of a heart. How the hatred that had burst alive in him was hot enough to awaken dormant seeds in Tony even from a distance. He imagined roots burrowing into muscle. Ropy stems spreading parasitically, wrapping Tony’s lungs and squeezing Tony’s heart, creeping up Tony’s throat. Leaves and buds unfurling in the flower bed of Tony’s chest, the crimes, the guilt, the black decay of his thoughts the highest quality of fertilizer.
The throw was still in the room, though neatly folded and hanging off the back of the desk chair. He had flung it onto Steve’s bed and left as quickly as possible when he had tried to wipe all traces of Steve out in the open. For the first time since the fugitive Avengers returned with new people in tow, Tony realized that Steve had done his best to keep his presence contained to his room, mindful of Tony’s space as if he were a guest. Other than the mug, he always made sure to put everything away and out of sight. This was no longer home.
If only he could go back and convince Tony of that, he thought, but he would have to go back further than their separation to do so. Back before Siberia, back before the Accords. Back before their farewell on the compound grounds. The seams had started to pull loose then, and they had never bothered to properly tighten up all the stitches again, assuming that it was enough that they had stopped Ultron as a united force, that they were tending to their own individual issues to keep from negatively affecting the team.
Peace in our time.
He leaned forward to do just that, smiling as soon as he felt the curve of Tony’s lips against his.
“It was worth it,” Steve said, and he had to believe that, had to believe enough for the both of them because Bucky deserved to be safe and he had nothing else.
He thought about how he could break Steve open. He had never seen Steve fall apart until he had, when Steve had slammed his shield into him, when Steve had told him that he was his soulmate, and Tony understood, better than he had ever before, that he held an immense, terrible power over Steve. He could rip Steve apart if he wanted to, over and over again. And there would be some callous satisfaction in that, in making someone who never let anyone know he was suffering, who took immense measures not to, break open and bleed. In making him feel a fraction of the pain he felt.
.” He paused, narrowing his eyes. “Maybe. I never tried.
And something even most New Yorkers didn’t know either: Midtown could be too.
Tony poked at the dish listlessly, his stomach clenching. “Yeah. He just told me that Thanos is about to get his hands on the Power Stone if he hasn’t already. I need to get everyone up to speed.”
“Because Patsy and Kate were ready to murder Brian for it! And it got all weird when Otto joined!” Jan’s eyes grew as big as saucers. “Oh my God,” she said breathlessly, “did you think he was auctioning himself off?”
And he had the team. Even if something happened, there was someone who would be on shift, someone to respond. He trusted them to act and the others him because at the end of the day, they were united by a common enemy and a common goal. The Avengers had always been good at coming together when they needed to protect the world, and this time they had seen the threat ahead of time and had prepared extensively to stop it.
His hands were trembling uncontrollably, creating tiny seismic waves that rippled through his body. The Gauntlet lay to the side, forgotten.
Once something gets too big, the human mind struggles to understand or respond to it. The depth of the oceans. The distance to the moon. The size of the universe. Incalculably large numbers. All outside the realm of perception, more concept than reality, than solid, tangible existence.
So he knew this wasn’t a dream. It was too vivid.
His fingers slipped on the clasps. He paused, his palms sticky and clammy with sweat, until he heard the unmistakable clang of vibranium hitting metal and the dying gurgle of a Chitauri soldier. He was hyperaware of his surroundings, staying as motionless as possible to pick up on the most minute of sounds coming from outside. More scuffling, more blows traded. But he could hear screeches and nothing else, no shout of pain from Steve, and that meant that Steve was holding down the fort as well as he could. The noise had died down significantly; there were fewer Chitauri out there.
“I don’t need anything special, just this. Could you have them use it?” He unfurled his fingers and gave the band to Peggy. It looked less small in her hand than it did in his, but still looked more suitable for a child than for a woman. He didn’t remember his mother’s wrist being so tiny. “It was my mother’s,” he added.
“You too.”
Panic made him want to refuse Steve’s offer; he was still afraid that they had overseen something or they would be caught off-guard, that if he took one moment to breathe now that everything started and was on the verge of snowballing, he would miss out on what happened and it would be too late for him to respond. FOMO on something that wasn’t even fun.
There’s no difference between those gone and those still here, Natasha realizes. This too is death, just a different kind.
Rogers always did love proving everyone wrong.
He’s desperately trying to rein Ross back, pleading with a man he hated and never once bowed to until that moment, quick to swallow his pride and grovel if it bought their friends safety.
Tony carefully sheathes him with the condom, and leans in, licks his length from the root to the tip before taking it in his mouth. Steve shudders. Tony’s mouth is warm and inviting, and looking down, watching Tony sucking on him is such an erotic sight that he almost comes here and now. Tony tries taking him deeper, and Steve’s hips can’t help but buckle, a small thrust.
Steve cared for him. He cared for him too much, and that was what had scared him. For a long time, before the war, Steve had thought that his appreciation of the male body was only one of an artist, and maybe, just maybe, envy from a shrimp who wished to be bigger. He didn’t think that it was more, and he never thought himself to be what people disgustedly called ‘a fag’, because he was attracted to women. Then the war came, he became the big and strong Captain America, and thus he had nothing to envy to anyone anymore. By then, he had already fallen in love with Peggy, and was blind to anyone else.
“What about you?
Large human hands held him down, and he felt a man’s pelvis grind against his ass, human legs blocking his own.
Steve doesn’t want to admit that he just doesn’t want to get up, doesn’t want to let go of Tony, doesn’t want him to leave. So he just nods. They kiss one more time, and then they finally separate.
“Poor Wanda, we failed her,” murmured Tony, pulling him out of his thoughts.
“Yeah,” says Steve, because he has to say something, and now his brain is broken and he doesn’t know how to fix this mess.
“…Okay,” finally breathed Tony.
“You still want to be fucked, right?”
to ask me to even
“Tony? I’m preparing some herbal tea if you’d like.”
The werewolf laughed, his breath tickling the sensitive skin of Tony’s rear.
“You mean the Civil War?”
Tony’s fingers are digging into Steve’s thighs, Steve’s heels pressing into the small of Tony’s back, legs quivering and locked around his waist, and Tony’s thrusts are sharp, swift and shallow, never rough, never too hard, never too deep. He doesn't nail Steve's prostate until Steve directs him with his heel, but it's to be expected from a man who stuck to women for too long. Now Tony is brushing against that exquisite spot on every slide, without fail. He’s panting loudly, his breath hot over Steve’s throat, and Steve is tangling his fingers in the soft curls of dark hair on Tony’s nape, as if holding him in place and maybe lightly pulling on it, as though he could somehow control Tony’s pace like that. And as the pleasure rolls in Steve and coils tightly around his spine, sparkling up all over his body, Steve forgets about his friends in the living-room and moans, groans, keens, and for the first time ever, he comes completely untouched.
And thus, by midday on the next day, Tony saddled Dummy and left the village. Jan was sitting between Dummy’s long ears, joyfully whistling, and it was amusing to note that no one, except Tony and his mule, could hear her nor see her. Once more, Jan guided them through the dark woods to the sorcerer’s glade, and as they reached the bottom of the tower, sad singing could be heard.
Tony huffed;
!” gasped Tony, suddenly sitting up, his heart beating faster with panic.
“Oh hey Stevie, you back already?” exclaims Bucky.
Being mentally unwell wasn’t the only reason why he had pushed Tony away, back then during Civil War, but also before then. Steve’s behavior and mistrust towards Tony during the whole Ultron affair had partly come from something else brewing in his heart. He had first intended to tell Tony, because the thought that Tony believed Steve hated him was unbearable.
“Honestly?” laughs Thor. “I would have made a move on him if I wasn’t so deeply in love with my lady Jane.” And he pecks Jane’s cheek loudly. Jane laughs. She’s not bothered by the confession. She knows there's no heart more loyal than Thor's.
“Oh, you…?”
“Natural blond, huh?” chuckles Tony, kissing his way around Steve’s growing erection and purposely avoiding it.
Steve stroke his back in a circular motion and kissed his temple, soothingly;
“Shh, shh!” chortles Steve, pressing his free palm on Tony’s mouth.
Tony pauses, his breath teasing the sensitive skin.
It did, very much. Especially when Tony shaved properly, and even shaved the rest of his body. Steve felt hot just thinking of the smooth skin hidden beneath the shirt and bodice, beneath the stockings, beneath his undergarment.
“Sure.”
They remain like this for a long moment, both painted with white streaks, still holding hands. They kiss lazily. Steve’s fingers stay there, keep caressing his insides. It doesn’t take long for Tony’s own fingers to return the favor. Steve shivers at the feeling of his long, agile fingers inside of him. Tony’s fingers are calloused, and slicked with cold lube, and it’s a delicious touch.
“Tony…”
The shutters, which were ajar, suddenly burst open, revealing Steve.
Tony swears, faltering in his rhythm but not stopping, seeking his own pleasure, until his hips stutter, and he shudders bodily, coming with a shout.
“Okay, let’s not… let’s not decide anything right now. You’re tired. Let’s get to sleep. You can tell me tomorrow if you want this to be something more, okay?”
As they reached a glade, Jan and the mules stopped.
“I… maybe once or twice,” said Tony. “I promise.”
“I had mental illnesses all that time. Survivor guilt. PTSD. Depression. I didn’t only lie to others, I lied to myself all the time. That was the only way I could keep myself steady. But whenever Bucky came in… that fragile equilibrium would collapse, and I’d found myself chasing after him, as if he could somehow fix everything. That was unfair to him, putting my whole sanity and happiness on his shoulders… The whole Accords fiasco was… well, I admit that you’re right. I probably didn’t keep up with the news. I didn’t want to deal with politics, I didn’t care about them. I thought that because I hated bullies, I couldn’t do wrong by the people, that I’d always protect the little one, and I didn’t realize I was actually acting like a bully myself by refusing to hear them out. The whole ‘plant yourself like a tree and say: no, you move’…those were words from Peggy. But I shouldn’t have used them as a guideline. I used them for myself, a, as Sam says, a ‘super-powered white man’, when they were words from a woman fighting in a time where sexism and racism were the norm, and fascism was taking over Europe. Being given no rights nor recognition, Peggy had no choice but to refuse to bulge and to impose her stance. I, on the other hand… I already was respected and had the right to voice my stance. But instead of voicing it, I tried to impose it like a dictator would, while abusing the faith of those who followed me and pushing away those who didn’t. I have no excuse. I know why I did it… I was just not thinking clearly at that time. There was a constant fog in my mind. I was desperate, I wanted the fire back in my heart… But everything just kept throwing punches at me. Bucky, Hydra, Ultron, the Accords… And then Peggy died, it hurt me so much, and I got so afraid that Bucky would follow that I just… I think I snapped. To be honest, Tony, I don’t remember much about the whole thing, I was so full of fear and loss! I probably acted just like a machine… I was out of control. I barely remember it. I don’t remember thinking. I just remember being hurt and so, so scared. I wanted Bucky safe, and it was as if the whole world was trying to rip him off my life. Again.”
He closes and opens his mouth a few times, but he doesn’t know how to respond, doesn’t know what to say.
“If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition. You must give me the child as soon as he recovers. He shall be well treated, and I will care for him.”
“Okay,” said Steve, quietly. “But, can I visit? May I visit you?”
“Ok, no, my place it is,” retorts Steve.
Tony nodded, and Arnie took the emptied tray from him, bidding him good night before leaving the room, and Tony was left again by himself in the dark. He curled on himself, snug in his blankets, and tried to calm down the whirlwind raging in his mind. Eventually, he found himself drifting into daydreaming.
“He’ll come along,” chuckled Steve, putting the pot on the hearth.
“No!” yelped Steve, so loudly and sudden that Tony startled, surprised by this passionate answer. “It’s just… I wouldn’t want Schmidt to realize someone’s visiting me, so… if you don’t mind, you could wash up?”
Because Gorgeous is handsome and cleans up nicely, and in the past hour since Steve’s noticed him, he’s been flirted by numerous hunks, and has turned down all of them -some of them Steve knows to be asses, but others pretty nice guys-.
“I was thinking,” said carefully Steve, “That I’d like to keep a souvenir of you.”
“Oh come on Stevie, don’t be a Grinch!” calls Bucky.
“Good day to you, Little Iron Man.”
“He’s a little shy. Toro? Come on, I need to boil water.”
“You don’t know me either.”
He meant it. Steve was frail, but he radiated some incredible inner strength, and Tony found himself fascinated by him. Steve blushed at this, as if he didn’t really think he was of much worth, and asked him if he wanted something to drink. They ended up sharing herbal tea, cake, and stories. The Red Skull never spent the day at the tower, only coming back at midday for lunch and sometimes late at night to sleep, so they had some free time. Eventually the evening came to an end, and Steve regretfully told Tony he should leave in case the sorcerer came back for the night.
Please don't hesitate to drop a comment, it really helps me. I love writing, but my health makes it very hard for me, so your encouragements mean a lot to me. Constructive criticism is welcome too, but not the flames. If I have missed a tag or misrated this work, please tell. See you next time!
Steve really wants to punch him, and, well, Bucky’s stuck in the traffic and texting him not to wait for him, so Steve’s suddenly striding through the crowd and heading straight for the counter. He hops on the stool next to Gorgeous, orders a mocktail, and turns towards him, staring straight at him and throwing aggressively;
He feels dizzy. The people around him are nauseating with obnoxious wealth and lack of empathy.
“I’m alright,” said Tony, gently, and he opened his hand to let her sit on his palm. “I just… I was just wondering something, about… about Steve.”
bad, and I thought you were doing better, and I thought Wilson would take care of you… it was supposed to be what he did, taking care of vets with PTSD. And well, I had a lot of shit on my own plate, so I thought…”
Jane doesn’t hear. He’s safe. Thor pats his shoulder again, and goes on relating a tale about his college days and his friends, “the Warriors Three and the lady Sif”.
“What’s that?”
“I am taking my godmother some cake and wine. Mom and I baked yesterday, and godmother always likes a good slice of cake.”
use my magic to force feelings or thoughts on someone! All I did was to give you an opportunity, Tony! I am helping you out so you can meet up with him. The rest is up to you!”
“I don’t know, it’s Christmas, we should be enjoying ourselves.”
Steve’s heart jumps in his throat as he sees Tony’s cheeks coloring.
Tony reluctantly looks up.
“So I decided to shield you all from that. I made sure none of that would reach you. I dealt with it on my own. Got your mail sorted before you got it. Dealt with the media alone. Listened to the victims alone. Dealt with the money issues alone. All of that so you could have some peace of mind and do your work with a good heart. It worked for a while, didn’t it? And then the Accords came, and I did something stupid. I shielded you from them the same way I did with the rest. I thought I would have time to introduce them to you in a smooth way. Also, I thought I could put our legal team on it, and get a say in their making without having to sign them first. But then, Lagos happened, and so the UN pushed the unfinished Accords forward, Ross fell on us like a hawk, and we got three days to sign. So yeah… it was my mistake. My guilt pushed me to take everything bad on my own, to shield you from it, and it was a bad move. You know the rest. I thought that we needed to sign to make sure we could still have a say in the Accords. You thought you could just say ‘no’ to a hundred countries.”
“I’m Jan. I’m the fairy who grants one wish, and only one,” she answered, grinning.
“I understand. I’ll get you out of here quietly.”
He had wanted to tell him. He had wanted to tell Tony that he liked him, liked him too much, and had simply been pulling his pigtails.
Tony sighed.
“Huh, you were planning on offering me a drawing?” chuckles Tony, still lazily stroking himself, now fully hard. His free hand is still skipping over his nipples, and his spine arches. Surprisingly, it’s that movement, that vision of Tony’s spine bending that fully arouses Steve, makes him remember how good it felt, to be moving inside of him.
“I’m glad you stopped me… even though I wish you had done so in another way. Even though I can’t help but think that it’s all your fault in the first place, and I know I wouldn’t have reacted like that if only… if only… If only you had destroyed that fuckin’ screen, and tape, and stopped me from watching it, and promised me to tell me after we put the bad guy’s in jail… If only you had told me beforehand, before any of this shit show. If only you had just fuckin’
you! I’m not a bad fairy! I would
“Com’on, Steve. Now that you’re finally here, we can open up the presents.”
When dinner’s over, they open their presents, and then Clint and Bobbi leave. Steve dresses up, as Sharon (Peggy’s cousin) comes to pick him up. His friends cheer at him and wish him luck.
“A souvenir? What do you mean?”
“Really? You want me to visit the place where my mom’s murderer now lives?”
“You smell like a male. I knew you were a male even before I spotted you. Also, I can smell some of our basic emotions, like fear, bloodthirst, or arousal. I wouldn’t have played with you today if I hadn’t smelled you were aroused instead of scared.”
Steve’s laughing, breathlessly. He’s shifting, feeling unstable on his stool, and he puts his free hand on Tony’s shoulder for support. He only has to turn his head a little, and he’s staring right into Tony’s eyes. Without thinking, he drops a kiss on the corner of his mouth. They are so close he can smell Tony’s cologne mixed with the scent of the mocktail he’s been drinking.
Steve’s head is spinning, and he takes a moment to recover, eyes closed and breathing deeply. Tony pulls out of him and collapses next to him, panting and swearing, whole body trembling.
He shook his head, and apologized, saying he wasn’t hungry and simply needed to rest. Mrs Arbogast gave him a long look, and then wished him good night, softly closing the door and letting him in peace. She had not renounced to feed him though, for half an hour later Tony heard another knock on his door, and Arnie’s muffled voice came through;
Tony let go of Steve’s neck, abruptly, and hid his face in his hands, a sob ripping through his chest. The euphoria had crashed down, and he was now being swept by horror and fear.
Tony cries out and comes, and he’s clamping so hard on Steve that Steve follows immediately after with a shout.
Yelping in surprise, Tony swatted at her, but she avoided him as easily as the first time.
been like that. Only Tony hadn’t wanted to care, and it was easy to not pay attention to men when he was young, easier even now that he loved women and was loved by them. The mind is something powerful, but also easy to mould. Where did Tony get those thoughts, about wanting men being an abnormality? An illness? A perversion?
A tear spilled onto the hand he had on Tony’s neck, then another, the first warning drops of a downpour. Steve opened his eyes to see Tony’s closed ones, his long eyelashes dewed. His mouth was parted as though he had something to say.
Dead.
“And us?” Steve asked him from behind, so faintly Tony almost didn’t hear him.
“What?” Tony asked, disoriented.
He could do nothing, but it wasn’t because he owed Steve nothing; it was because Steve believed that he didn’t.
Tony had thought that he would kill him—and maybe in a way he had.
It had.
When he opened his eyes, nighttime had fallen. Tony was gone, no trace of him in the air, but he felt calm, a sense of steadiness blanketing him. He stood there for a minute, putting his hands in his pockets as he stared at the trees and the house before him, truly empty now that Tony was gone, before walking back the way he came to where his motorcycle stood.
something
He thought of the grime sluicing off of him, Bucky’s ashes swirling down the drain, of Sam and countless others gone without a trace, and gripped the phone harder.
They survey catastrophe, hundreds here lost, even more elsewhere, and reduce it to digestible pieces.
Tony laughed. “I guess I do, don’t I?” he said, and when he reached up to kiss him, smiling against Steve’s lips, Steve thought that it had all been worth it, all the misunderstandings and all the embarrassing mistakes, because he had ended up right where he wanted to be.
Two layers to go.
Dum Dum whistled and clapped a hand on his shoulder, and Steve couldn’t help but laugh even as Dum Dum waved away all mentions of Howard and lab tests.
“You need your hands to work. Can’t have you busting them up like this.”
Their pinkies were a hair’s breadth apart, not quite touching. Tony wanted to loop his around Steve’s and bring Steve’s hand towards him.
Sometimes, in moments like the one now, when things got too hard and he couldn’t see the future past the next step, it was enough just to repeat his soulmate’s words in his head like a prayer. It helped him march forward even when he saw things he could have never imagined in his worst nightmares, even when he trudged through battlefields bogged down with mud and too many bodies and towns silent and hollow with devastation.
Tony touched his pocket to make sure that the card was still there before folding into Steve, sliding his hand across Steve’s side and then wrapping his arms fully around him. Steve was big and comfortingly sturdy under him.
The sky closing up, condemning Tony to a cold, lonely death.
Not a family but a machine, engineered to deal with threats that were getting more frequent and more complex.
This was it. No turning back.
It had been winter then, just as bitterly cold, the ground just as unrelentingly hard under him.
His hands slipped off of Tony’s. Tony lunged for them, clutched them desperately in his.
“If he’s out there, he’ll come back.”
He didn’t even need to speak. It was there on his face, the rigidity of his body, as soon as she entered the room.
Because the world needed them to. Because they needed to keep the world safe.
So when he told Steve, “You waited for me. You didn’t have to,” his voice fragile with surprise, like Steve hadn’t done this before, like Steve wasn’t an assured thing, Steve wanted to ask how could he not, when Tony did all that for him.
He would give Steve everything if he asked. He wanted to give Steve everything.
There were people, he remembered, who dismissed Tony as immature, who froze him in the amber of their memories as someone whose childishness would follow him into adulthood, but they hadn’t had him entirely right. Youthful though he was, he was always rushing to the future, always light-years ahead of everyone else. If anything, there had been times when Steve thought that Tony had grown up too soon and much faster than he should have. Times when he had wondered when Tony would ever be the age he was supposed to be and no older or younger, before the accident happened a few weeks before college started.
Rhodey slides over a beer to Pepper. “What did you tell him?”
Or he wouldn’t because of his understanding of its futility. His acceptance that it wouldn’t matter what excuses he gave, how much he pleaded his case, because Steve didn’t care to listen. Because Steve didn’t care about him anymore, other than to hate every atom of him.
He didn’t know what it was like to lose, he realized. He had lost fights as a kid, but he had shown bullies that there were people who would stand up to them. He had lost everything fighting the Red Skull, but he had foiled the Skull’s plan and helped turn the tide of war. He had lost everything again over the Accords, but he had gotten Bucky to safety.
“You’re not stupid for expecting your word to mean what it says. It’s on him for not living up to it.”
Steve wondered if the serum would do anything to his mark.
They were the only ones who stayed up this late or woke up this early this often, but somehow Tony hadn’t thought of that when he headed to the gym.
They had been adrift without it, Steve more than her because she had found her place in the world years before, with SHIELD and with Clint, but Steve hadn’t until Tony came calling.
, he snapped at himself, but the twinge of annoyance evaporated almost as soon as it formed, turning into a fine mist that spread out from and around him, vague and directionless, more simmering, nebulous unhappiness than boiling ire.
“Seventh grade,” Tony began after a long silence, slowly like his mind was galaxies away. “Your mom was really sick.”
That’s what Steve believes, she knows.
“I don’t know what I’m going to do when I see him again,” he admitted once he sobered.
She’s afraid to jump to conclusions however likely they may be, to hope, but Tony’s always been the promise of it, of Houdini-esque escapes and victories against the unbeatable, of something better to come. Hope personified.
It meant nothing. He had to get a grip. Christ.
Tony stared at him impassively, as if trying to judge whether Steve was telling the truth, before he smiled, soft and a little crooked. “Okay,” he said with a finality that told Steve he had made his decision.
Everyone contributed to the plan he had outlined, but it was Steve’s opinion he sought. Steve alone knew what it was like to command an army into battle, lead the Avengers,
He could kiss Tony all he wanted. Tony was his husband-to-be, after all.
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, he thought as Thor talked on, every new detail worse by the minute.
“No. You were only trying to find some happiness of your own.”
“Yeah, that’s because the whole idea behind the mystery items was to give people who couldn’t offer big bids a chance to win something and the bids got out of control real fast. But that was sweet of you, protecting me like that.”
Even if she somehow missed it, the way he clasps his phone so carefully reveals everything. He holds it as though it’s something precious, as though it’s Tony’s heart he has in his palm except he would never dare to indulge in sentimentality of that kind. That’s arrogance and greed that he can’t allow, to think that Tony was his in any way, to think that Tony could be his. To take him like that when he took so much from him already. Tony never belonged to him.
His muscles screamed awake as he ran.
And Tony had never stopped wanting him, and that would never change regardless of what he decided to do.
“Can I come in?”
“You need to eat.”
, he reminded himself fiercely, and only then did he swallow his dread and shift his thumb up to the heel of his palm.
She wants to reach into the video and adjust the angle so she can see Tony, and as though he can hear her thoughts, Tony knocks what she assumes is his helmet with his foot so that it faces him. As soon as he does, she knows. One glance tells her everything.
He had never deserved Steve.
“Your best guy,” Tony purred, absurdly pleased. He always loved it whenever Steve called him that. He had broken into a smile bright with affection, and Steve wanted to kiss him, to feel that smile against his lips. For a second, he held himself back before remembering he didn’t have to.
By the time he looked at Steve full on, the soft light had dimmed though it wasn’t snuffed out completely, tinged with a wistfulness that was foreign to him and that he brusquely forced himself to ignore.
“I was scared I’d die before I got to know you.”
, Tony had said before everything erupted into chaos, before all Steve could think of was to stop him, and Steve knew with a terrible conviction, without knowing exactly how, that they were his words, that this time was different from all the other times he had heard them.
The last thought he had in the hazy interim before unconsciousness was that he had gotten it wrong in the end. He never got to meet his soulmate.
They were close enough that his breath ghosted across their faces, a hazy plume fading almost as soon as it appeared. His words hung in the air long after it dissipated.
Steve sought Tony in the aftermath, bright and happy as though reborn. She had never seen him like that before in all the years she had known him.
Once he had walked away, Steve glanced at the note again even though he knew that there wasn’t any point; the handwriting wasn’t the same. Peggy’s letters were too neat and orderly that one glance would have sufficed in telling him as much, but he couldn’t help but hold out hope that maybe it was still Peggy somehow. That maybe it was Peggy when she was in a hurry or when she was emotional even though he couldn’t see her ever writing like this, all sharp, brisk, and angular.
But Tony was Midtown, was New York, was every inch of this beautiful place of theirs, from its most elegant to its most rudimentary, from the needle tips of the Freedom Tower and the Empire State Building to train tracks girded in electrified steel underground. Michelin-starred restaurants that Steve would have never dreamed of stepping into before Tony came into his life, perfumed luxury shops on the wide streets of Fifth Ave and the cobbled ones in Soho. Dive bars that had seen their best days in decades past, late-night karaoke joints up a narrow flight of stairs in K-Town, blocks away from the sold-out concert at MSG that they had skipped because Steve was hungry. New buildings and parks and ideas spun of dreams to crumbling bricks and stomped dandelions poking through cracks in the pavement.
But he knew Tony the way Tony knew him, and Tony would see this as something that Steve should do even if Tony had as much right to do it too, if not more.
“You’re alive,” he breathed out, wet and ruined.
Tony had showed him that. Tony always stripped him down to the basics.
The pain had been razor-sharp, but bright like electricity coursing through him, changing every atom of his being.
Fact number one: Tony’s running on grief and fumes, haggard and sallow enough that he looks like he died and was resurrected moments ago.
“’s fine,” he said even though they had been waiting for over thirty minutes because of a delay and scheduled work.
she had had decorously engraved on it.
The sun was high in the sky. The city glittered, steel and glass buildings rising like trees all around him. Whichever way he faced, they were there, and though only two skyscrapers nearby came close to the Avengers Tower in height, there were so many of them, a veritable forest, that they towered over him when he closed his eyes. He was small in their presence, swallowed up and anonymous—though not invisible. Not lost.
Speaking of cyborg BFFs, he should get to T’Challa and his impressive wunderkind sister. Shuri was only feet away from him, torn between being not as enamored with his tech as he would have assumed she would be—and he wasn’t sure whether he was more delighted or affronted by that—and excited by all the superheroes gathered in the room like any kid. Barnes was, thankfully, nowhere near them; what bafflingly seemed to be an irascible talking raccoon was accosting him near the bar.
“He should be there for you too,” Rhodey said, his voice quiet but hard. He hesitated before clasping a hand around Tony’s forearm, inches from his bracelet. The touch grounded Tony, the way it always did. “You deserve better than him."
“A man who sings very high,” he snapped.
he had craved when he had climaxed.
Steve took a hesitant step toward him, and then reached up, cupping Tony’s face with his warm hands.
He closed his eyes and savored the moment. The warm water felt amazing, and helped relax his aching muscles from days of work (and of climbing up the tower). He must have dozed off at some point, because he startled awake to Steve’s voice from behind the curtain.
“Is is so strange that I could get lucky sometimes?” snaps Steve.
The heavy golden braid uncoiled from the windows down to the ground, and he climbed up. Steve was waiting for him at the window sill, eyes lit up and piercing blue, and he helped Tony in. Tony had barely set foot inside that Steve was already wrinkling his nose.
It’s a low blow, he knows, but he doesn’t want to spoil the surprise. Tony sighs, deeply. He looks a little consternated.
“What the…!? How
“And what are you carrying under your apron? It smells tasty,” kept rumbling the beast.
She nodded, her feet dangling other the edge of his palm, one hand wrapped around his pinky and the other waving at him as if enjoining him to go on. So he did.
Shit. He hadn’t meant to say that. It had escaped his lips without notice, maybe because he was desperate to think of something else than Wanda, or maybe also because that was really something he couldn’t get over.
“That drawing of me?” repeats Tony, frowning, and then he starts; “Oh! You mean the drawing you did in the morning? When I was… um…”
“Hey, wait, what are you doing?” he exclaims, sitting up.
Arnie patted his arm, jolting him out of his somber pit of guilt.
“The bathroom’s over there,” he directs, “come join us for breakfast when you’re done. My roommate’s made coffee.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah, yes, my friends are there. But, you don’t have to go and meet them,” Steve explains.
“He’s very powerful, Tony,” said Steve patiently, as if talking to a child, which made Tony want to swat at him, “He’s even got hired men back in the city. He’s got money, too.”
New Year’s Eve passes, and Tony still hasn’t called. Steve doesn’t know if he should call himself, or if this is a clear sign of Tony not being interested in a date.
Tony felt like he was going to faint.
adoration, then, apart from the loneliness, there would be no reason for Steve to… Wait.
Steve’s heart is hammering in his chest, and he feels the anxiety skyrocketing. They had a great time together, but Tony still hasn’t said anything about his decision. Hesitantly, Steve kisses him, gentle, on the corner of his mouth.
“Okay,” says Steve, and dips his head back down, letting Tony fuck his mouth again. He lets go of Tony’s hips and blindly searches for the bottle of lube, finds it, coats his fingers, and slips carefully one slicked finger inside of him. Tony gasps and twitches, and Steve’s mouth feels fuller, the pressure harder against his tongue.
“Condom?” he asks.
They stopped, looked at each other, and Tony tried again, less hurriedly;
It’s Christmas morning, and the most amazing Christmas Steve ever had. He wakes up to Tony kissing his forehead, and is a little embarrassed when he realizes that he had been drooling on Tony’s chest all night, but Tony just laughs it out, and they stay in bed for a long hour more, lazily kissing and caressing each other.
“Okay, okay,” soothed Arnie. “I’m just saying, if something happened, we’re here for you. You’ve totally got Bambi wrapped around your finger anyway, so she’d do anything for you.”
Christ. Steve has rarely been that obsessed about someone, and he feels shame curling in his chest. He hides again the drawing behind all the other canvases, and sits back on his chair, looking at the screen where Tony’s wiki page is still up.
Ah, Tony had always fallen hard and fast, hadn’t he? And it had always hurt in the end. His first love, Meredith, had been the daughter of one of his father’s competitors, and Howard had forbidden him to see her, leaving the two young lovers heart-broken. Cassandra had also been the daughter of a competitor, and while she had swore to Tony her feelings were true, she had been sent by her mother to gather information about the Starks. Feeling betrayed, Tony had dumped her, uncaring of her tears. Later, he had been dumped himself by his fiancée Joanna when his parents had passed away and Stane bought over the Stark Forge. Then he had dated Pepper for a while until she had gotten fed up with his antics and chosen Happy instead. Rhodey was in an on-and-off relationship with Carol, one of the mercenaries from the caravanserai. Wait, what?
of you, how can you not get it? It’s
Arnie didn’t answer immediately, and Tony finally looked up, afraid he had made obvious the sin he had committed and that had him bed-ridden. However Arnie’s eyes were soft and understanding, and he simply reached out, tapping two fingers on Tony’s left hand.
Bucky turns the TV on. He probably thinks that Steve and his guest are still asleep, and he’s trying to wake them up.
Looking up, Steve stills his fingers, watches as Tony shivers and arches, now gently rocking on Steve’s fingers. Steve admires how genuine he is, how he doesn’t hide how much he likes that, how much he wants more of Steve. Tony’s not ashamed of how wanton he is being, and he smirks at Steve, dark blue eyes with blown pupils lazily gazing at him from under heavy, half-closed lids.
Nat shoos Steve away.
“You’re not, but I know how people look at me when they want me, and you definitely do. So how about this? I don’t need you to find me someone, you’re there already and I like you just fine. Interested in having me?”
‘I hurt you so much because I liked you’, then, would only morph itself into a monstrous ‘You don’t deserve to be loved.’
“I don’t care about your money, I didn’t even know who you were before I googled you, and the sex… well, the sex is amazing, but really, I wanna know you,
He wasn’t mocking him. He was… Steve swallowed. There was no way Tony could understand exactly what he was saying without… He cut short the thought. He didn’t want to think that maybe Tony would know firsthand what Steve was going through, because he had been there, too.
Usually, Steve would stay with them on Christmas Eve. But Peggy insisted on getting him into a charity event, full of rich people, all because they’ve taken a shine on him.
“Tony,” said Arnie after a moment, his voice softer all of a sudden. “Forgive me for asking, but you don’t look okay. Has something happened?”
“Please!” cried Tony, and he hid his face in his hands again, trying to hold back the sobs.
Tony forced himself to open his eyes, though his head was swimming, his whole body feeling much too hot, his blood singing and boiling in his veins and battering around his eardrums, the beat of his heart much too quick, fluttering like a scared rabbit. Since he was sitting and Steve standing, he had to tilt his chin up so as to look at him, and Steve was bowed towards him. Their eyes locked, and a whimper escaped his throat. Steve’s eyes were of a blinding blue such as Tony had never seen, a pure shade of azure, the kindness and stubbornness that usually swam there drowned out by passion and fierceness.
“Didn’t get to see him, though,” got on Bucky, ignoring him, and he shoves a piece of cake in his mouth. “Was he really that pretty?”
Steve stared at him, and his voice was doubtful.
“I meant to ask,” said the wolf-man. “What’s with the get-up? Why did you dress as a woman again?”
“I don’t own any clothes,” frowned Steve, glancing at the wrapped cake with longing.
Tony watches him with disturbingly understanding eyes, and then he leans away from the counter and grabs his drink again, taking another sip from his mocktail. Steve can see him throwing him a glance from the corner of his eye, and finds his breath catching in his throat.
“You okay?” said the wolf-man, and Tony took a moment to check on himself, eyes closed. His body felt like cotton, but he still wanted, wanted,
The mule shook his head and stubbornly turned right when Tony tried to make him go left. Tony rolled his eyes. Actually, he was getting a little worried, for he had spent the morning wandering in the woods instead of seeing the good witch and putting up at the small village’s inn, and at that rate, they’d spend the evening as well. He did not fancy spending the night in the forest.
He didn’t know what to say, didn’t know how to hold on to him, how to convince him to listen to him and hear him out. They couldn’t leave it at that. He couldn’t let Tony leave still thinking that Steve had treated him so poorly because of a lack of trust and friendship when it hadn’t been the case at all…
The entered the glade as Steve ended his singing. Steve was overjoyed to see him, his grin visible even from down there on the ground. When Tony finally joined him upstairs and told him he would come back again one more time after this visit, Steve cheered enthusiastically.
Bucky’s sprawled on the couch, sipping coffee from his favorite mug. He looks tired. Steve takes two mugs from the cupboard, fills himself one, and comes to sit on the couch with Bucky. He greets him;
He had to believe that. It was all that kept him going some days.
Steve wondered at that, at what Tony meant. He wasn’t sure if Tony even knew.
Steve’s insides churned uneasily with familiar, years-old guilt. He would never forget the way that Tony had looked at him as he left.
But Tony wasn’t asking for forgiveness this time, refusing to give either apology or justification. He knew that he had passed the point of no return, not just in what he and the others were doing but also in what Steve would forgive. Arrogance. Self-importance. Cruelty and cowardice parading as martyrdom. No one else could do this. No one else could be allowed. There were no choices. He wouldn’t apologize because of that, Steve thought with a sneer.
Hope is risky, but Jim’s confident and unwavering in his faith. There’s fire in his eyes, and Natasha knows this is exactly how he must have looked when he disregarded his superiors’ warnings and nearly destroyed his career to continue his search for Tony.
Including Steve’s.
Tony twined his arm around Rhodey’s as they made to leave.
Thank you so much,
Yes, he would.
“What you told me. Harley’s not stupid.”
He’s so careful when it comes to Tony now, unnecessarily so.
fight against the impossible, and no one possessed the strategic mind and war experience that he did. And they were at their best when they pushed each other to come up with methods the other hadn’t considered. When they challenged each other by talking things through.
And if that were true, if nothing went wrong, then Steve knew without a doubt that his mark would stay unchanged because it was better than good. Of all the parts that made him who he was, his soulmate’s words were the best, the one truly perfect thing.
“Yes, you did. Tony went up on the stage, and you shouted everyone down with an outrageous bid. No one wanted to fight you on it, remember? I thought Loki would, at least.” Jan held up three fingers, putting them down one by one as she rattled off her reasons. “I mean, he has the money, he loves antagonizing everyone, and he always raids Tony’s fridge. I’m surprised
“You meant it until you stopped,” Tony said, and it was a statement and question all at once.
Jan wriggled her way between them. “It came!” she squealed as soon as she made her way to the front, clapping with glee. “I wonder who delivered it. Maybe Vision? He wouldn’t care that much about trying a bite.” She eyed the wheel as if she were sorely tempted to slice off a chunk for herself.
“Yeah,” Steve said like that was even an answer, but he was trying to say something else and it was as if he didn’t know how or if it would be welcome. Tony heard it, what followed that one word.
“The most expensive—wait, win? Is this about the charity auction we had?”
The numbness didn’t last long. Steve was everywhere in his absence. The “World’s Best Dad” mug that Natasha had gotten for him, and Tony, in the sink. The knit throw that was originally Wanda’s and then the team’s and then his, neatly folded with militaristic precision on the couch. A mission report open on the coffee table, a note stopped mid-scrawl in the margin, a pen resting on top of it and holding his place on the page as though he had simply gone out for a run and would come back to read it over lunch. That was Steve’s personal copy; there were tiny doodles all over it: Sam cooing over Redwing, Vision cooking with a chef’s hat, Tony snoozing at his lab table with a blanket draped over him.
By then it was too late, his shield slicing down too fast to stop. It cleaved the arc reactor in half before he could think of what to do, snuffing out the light that had always glowed so bright and steadfast in all their battles. He could feel how deeply it gouged the chest plate and realized, even with several inches of armor separating them, that Tony’s ribs had to be fractured, if not broken.
Sam used to say that it was important to maintain routines when grieving, to have a shred of normalcy when things were nowhere near normal. He made sure to remind them of that when the days melted from one to the next and they drifted from place to place.
He had been afraid of that, hadn’t he, with his dreams of Tony looming over him, the secret, gnawing worry that he was falling short. One day, he wouldn’t be enough for Tony, wouldn’t be able to catch up to him. But it was good that he had stumbled and Tony had outpaced him, too far down the path to reach. He didn’t want to follow Tony, not down this road, not when Tony’s idea of a future was one secured by the genocide of entire worlds.
The tension that had coiled in Steve’s muscles and the tightness around his eyes when he first came into the gym were gone now, but exhaustion had replaced them instead, the cruel kind that wouldn’t let him rest.
“I will.” And because it was the truest thing he knew and because it would be the last time in a long while until he could say it: “I love you.”
He should have refused Steve’s help, but Steve had insisted that someone cover him, saying that he was going to be open to attacks while he worked on the Gauntlet.
“Go!” Steve shouted. He had already turned back, smashing his shield under the jaw of the alien closest to him, concentrating on giving Tony enough time to escape.
Weariness settled over Steve, softening his features, as though he had, despite his initial reaction, long since resigned himself to this outcome. “It doesn’t. But that doesn’t change the fact that you’re my soulmate either.”
Not anymore.
Come back to me.
There was a party raging on inside the house behind him, the deep bass thrum of music muffled by the distance but pounding the walls, in time with the throbbing in his head.
“Yes. I’ll make sure of it,” she said, and she gently closed her fingers over his band like she meant to protect it.
“Tony, I don’t even know what a table runner even is.”
He knocked on the door. Steve opened it, face wrinkling in confusion as he took Tony in. He was in a white T-shirt and loose sweatpants that hung low on his hips, his hair mussed. Tony forced himself not to look down.
There were people who would die for him. Tony knew that because he would do the same for them, because their hearts were the same when it came down to that. But Steve, Steve would live for him if he asked. He would do his best to do that, to stay at his side, to come back if he couldn’t.
The compound was as empty and dark as deep space, and Tony was tempted to ask FRIDAY to turn on some lights except he didn’t want to see empty hallways either. The compound was too big for the few who had survived. Had been too big since Steve had gotten most of the kids after the split over the Accords.
In the radiant glow of Carol’s light as she descends to Earth a few feet away like a falling star, Natasha can see that he’s been crying silently this entire time.
Come on.
The window they had was infinitesimally small, and many would die in the attempt. But hope sparked to life in Tony for the first time in a long while, kindling him with renewed purpose.
This wasn’t a ship they had the fortune to find or steal; Rocket had recognized it. Tony’s wearing a well-worn jacket she’s never seen before, and his shirt is too big and hangs too loosely on him and not just from weight loss. Rocket and the blue woman who walked down with Tony stare at each other too long and too silently. Peter Parker’s nowhere to be seen.
He nodded his head to the locker room.
There were distortions in the fabric of the memory, the indistinct outlines of the lab bench bleeding through, the murmurs of the Avengers rustling behind him in the snow three decades before they had been voiced.
“All I could think of was you, after,” he said, looking somewhere to the right of him. “Everyone here could have died a-and I wasn’t…I didn’t want to think about that. I couldn’t. So I kept thinking about how I needed to fix this. Over and over again, and all I could think of when I did was you. If no one else—the one person who couldn’t be dead…I needed you to be alive.” He swallowed hard, turning away. “I need
Thanos destroyed so much, razing everything to the ground and leaving behind scorched earth, but something fragile blooms in Tony’s eyes as Steve places his hand over his.
I try? Now that I’m going, I’m thinking of all the lost opportunities here, goddammit.”
“I came to say goodbye,” he said.
But he knew what Tony meant. Tony had been destined for MIT since they were kids, whereas he hadn’t even been sure if he’d be able to go to college, what with money being tight and his mom sick again. Yet here he was, freshly graduated, summa cum laude, while Tony had stayed behind in this time-frozen town.
Tony wasn’t sure if they could ever be friends again or whether he even wanted them to be. Too much mistrust had led to misunderstandings and mistakes, and there were too many times they had wounded each other. It wasn’t clear if this was a continuation of the path they had been on or if it was possible for them to start over. All that was definite was that if there was just one thing he could rely on Steve for without hesitation, it was saving the world, no matter the disagreements and no matter their personal problems.
Often, during long nights on the run in cramped motels and abandoned warehouses, he had wondered whether they would know what to say to each other if they ever met again.
he thought venomously, but he stopped himself before he lashed out. The ugly, vindictive creature he had been nursing inside of him would have taken enormous pleasure in hurting Steve, but punching him in the gut would leave him exposed, give Steve an in. He didn’t want to give Steve any more of him than he already had, not even his anger. He swallowed the poison, too accustomed to its corrosiveness to care about how much of him it eroded away.
This was all he had now. This was all he had left of Tony. A piece of junk, the end of a cut rope.
Steve seems to think the same thing because there are no right words for their reunion, but he manages to find the right one anyway.
“You made it through,” he says shakily. Carol powers down, dimming their surroundings, but his eyes are still bright, wet with moonlight and unshed emotion.
“You’re not...”
“You too, Tony,” Steve said softly, and this time, when Steve reached for him, slowly, carefully, when he wrapped a hand firmly around the crook of Tony’s arm and held onto him as though he could leave some form of protection on his skin, Tony let him.
“You know as much as I do that it’s not about knowing what words the other person has,” Rhodey said pointedly. “Even if your word was something completely different, what it comes down to is the work and meeting your soulmate halfway. You kept your end of the bargain. He hasn’t.” He nodded at the letter. “Although maybe he’s trying. Too late and in some obtuse way, knowing him, but it’s up to you to decide whether it’s enough.”
“You believe that as much as I do. You brought us together after SHIELD fell and wanted us to be on the same page for the Accords. And you put that belief into the plan you’ve been working on for years, even after everything that happened.”
She rushes to him before her mind catches up to her body, breathing him in once Rhodey and Bruce have greeted him. He’s frail in her arms, made brittler when he stiffens in surprise. For a second, a grid of ugly black lines flashes in her mind, and she recalls his flesh sinking beneath the puncture of her needle, feverishly hot and malleable.
But Tony had never flirted with him even if it was supposedly safe. Not once.
It was all that kept him together now that he lost Bucky.
Did Steve ever really care? Maybe. But not in the way he wanted him to and more out of obligation and guilt than anything. He understood that now. He just didn’t see it because he wanted to read into things that weren’t there, and that had blinded him so that he missed what was.
He did. He had rushed to Siberia without hesitation because he fell for Zemo’s plot and because Steve needed him, and even though he pushed the possible legal ramifications of what he was doing out of his mind, it was only when he walked into the Hydra base and saw Steve smile with relief that he finally felt at ease. It was nice after butting heads for so long to have Steve’s back and know that Steve had his as they tackled a problem together, the way they were supposed to.
Maybe it hadn’t had time to set in—or maybe it wouldn’t, the illness stillborn after Steve had slammed his fist against Tony’s cheek and felt the bone there yield under his knuckles.
“Early start for you too?” he asked. He rolled the apple between his palms. It was waxy. He had no desire to eat it, the very thought of biting into it unappealing.
He walked away, his shadow stretching long in front of him as he made his way towards the empty hallway, doing his best to stay loose even as he wanted nothing more than to ball his hands into fists and…and…
He had a moment to wonder whether he had gone too far when Tony tensed, but Tony didn’t remove his hand and, after a moment, replied.
“I had to make sure you were okay.” He finally turned to look at Steve. “You
People always said that it did. And he had read a study done on vets after they came home from war. Something about that physical connection helped to put them at ease, to take away some of the pain.
He was losing himself. Someone was screaming and vaguely, as though from miles away, isolated from his own body and mind, he was aware that it was him. Information overload. He was taking too long to choose, and the Gauntlet was wresting control from him, preying on his indecision. It would break.
Fourteen million to one, he thought as Tony intertwined their fingers, and though the chance of failure was high and they were going in blind, he couldn’t help but believe, now that they had each other.
This was the most intimate they had ever been in public and the longest.
“I was always in love with you. Even before we met.”
“Or Roseanne’s,” Natasha says. She and Pepper ordered pizza too many times to count during their all-nighters, trying to do damage control for SI, to wrest the impossible and insurmountable into submission. She quashes the feeling that she’s interrupting something private as she walks to the couch and places a hand on Pepper’s shoulder. “We did it before,” she says quietly, but it comes out more unstable than she likes, a note of doubt diluting her confidence.
“Oh.”
Natasha hates seeing her like this. It feels wrong, and it’s unfair—Pepper’s only human, and no one knows how to react to what Thanos did because no one was prepared for it—but Pepper has always been collected even in the midst of chaos, has never been lost the way she is now.
Regardless of soul marks, regardless of what their words were.
There never have been any, just stopgaps.
Steve remained in the bathroom with him as he washed his hands gingerly, clamping his mouth shut so that no sound could escape as the water bit them. He could tell Steve to leave. He knew he would go if he said he had it handled. It was just a bad contusion and scraped skin.
Ash everywhere, on his tongue, in the back of his throat, in his lungs. Under his fingernails as he sifted through it, as though he could bring Bucky back if he just kept his ashes from scattering.
okay,” he said, his eyes burning with faith, and it was more a statement than a question.
It wasn’t real. (Not yet.)
, for this breathtaking commission! I’m stunned at how you captured the emotions of this moment so perfectly that I’m a little verklempt (also a little verklempt seeing “So was I” in Tony’s handwriting on Steve’s wrist after thinking about it for so long; thank you for putting up with all the details I threw your way and for all the research you put in to make this. It’s incredible). I had this scene in my head for months while working on LPAYS, and this is exactly how I imagined it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.<3
“Because all those years, I was lost and you gave me everything. And even when I held myself back, I was happy. I was home.”
“No,” Steve agreed, subdued. “I still hurt you. I made that choice.” His knuckles were striated white as he clenched the railing, the bleached bone pronounced. He was stripped bare. “I can’t take it back, but I am sorry,” he whispered. “More than you’ll ever know.”
He’s letting them in and believing in them, seeing their potential the way Steve saw the best in them.
“Is it true?” he asked again, hope both emboldening him and making his words come out shakily.
The biggest block of cheese that Steve had ever seen in his entire life greeted him as soon as he got to his room after a long day of class. He stood in the doorway, nonplussed.
Jerking away or excusing himself would have been pathetic so he stayed where he was as Steve leaned against the railing next to him, observing several Avengers jog outside on the grounds below, Peter outstripping them all, running too fast. Someone should tell him to take it easy before he ran out of steam, Tony thought, but then Peter skidded to a stop and gestured enthusiastically at Shuri, who sat under a tree with a tablet in hand, as if asking how he did.
Her voice is steady and so is her heart because it’s not false hope; it’s probability, a solid bet hedged on calculations from previous situations.
He took off his band and held his wrist, pressing the words there with his thumb before rubbing them, an old habit that never failed to comfort him. Sometimes he liked to think that his soulmate could feel him when he did that or that maybe they were doing the same thing at that very moment. The mark was an invisible line stretching across an unknown distance, two tin cans attached to a string except that they couldn’t hear each other.
, he thought. It was like he had punched slabs of meat, and their color had rubbed off against his knuckles, leaving them bloody.
It was one of the things he loved most about Tony; he was the most generous and caring person Steve knew, never hesitating to offer help in any way he could.
he thought for a fleeting second, but Brooklyn and Sam and Natasha, Bucky and his mother, stirred in the back of his mind, beckoning him, and he knew that that wasn’t what he wanted.
The warning was there and gone, a feeble flicker that barely stirred him. His worries were so insignificant now. Rejection was easy to deal with and hatred and revulsion, condescension and pity, mattered little when Tony was here, alive. Half the universe was gone, and Tony had somehow made it.
“You don’t know what I would’ve done.”
“I didn’t bid for a cheese wheel,” he insisted.
He wasn’t so lucky.
Steve took his right hand and held it, saying and doing nothing for a brief moment before he replied. “Okay,” he said quietly.
“Yeah, I am.”
Tony’s answer was in the gray, conflicted area between yes and no. He didn’t want to be hurt by Steve again. He wanted to give him a second chance. He didn’t want to let his walls down. He wanted to believe in Steve.
There were matching scars on them both.
If he didn’t have his father’s legacy then, he thought, if he weren’t the face of his company and he hadn’t spent so much time shoving himself into the spotlight and landing on the front pages of unsavory tabloids for decades, they could do things like this all the time. They could go out more often. They wouldn’t have to settle for most of their dates being movie nights on the couch and dinners at home. They would be able to walk the streets without a care in the world, not having to worry about being followed or interrupted. No one would bother them, and they could just be themselves.
He’s sturdy and unruffled like this is a routine mission call.
He was a city of millions in one man, an entire city unto himself.
He hadn’t gone back to that moment because it would have been a useless exercise. It had happened, and he could play with memory through BARF, but he couldn’t alter history. He couldn’t go back in time and prevent Steve from saying his word.
Morbidly, it struck Tony that this could and most likely would be the last time he would see some of them ever again. No one was naive enough to believe that they would all miraculously survive; they knew what was at stake when they answered the call and that there was a high possibility that they were marching straight to death’s doors. It had been there in the back of his mind too, only he had refused to dwell on it and there had been more pressing matters to attend to than to think about it. But with Thanos finally coming, there was no avoiding the thought.
That settled it for him.
He knew Steve was right. There wasn’t any point, not after the war. It was a useless exercise, trying to bullshit and convince the other person that they were okay when nothing and nobody was. All those walls, all those pretenses that they had kept up all these years to, what, show that they didn’t need each other? Show that they cared but hide exactly how much? To avoid getting hurt?
He could raise the deceased, eradicate diseases, prevent wars.
He gripped his wrist tighter, hard enough that the tips of his nails faded into bleached crescents. All he could do was stay rooted to the spot, his jackrabbiting heart forcing his breaths to come in labored and ragged.
“Give me your hands.”
That was what they were good at. And they had always done it together.
A massive bellow reached them, and Tony turned his head just in time to see Hulk flung backwards in the far distance, small as a speck, Thanos’s blow making him skid several miles once he hit the ground before coming to a stop, slumped over and unmoving.
He imagined Tony turning into golden starlight, the same exact brilliance of the waterproof sparklers he had gifted Steve on Steve’s last birthday before he had died. The ones that he had spent months perfecting because it had rained on Steve’s birthday the year before, and all they had was lightning for fireworks.
“Oh,” Tony said in a small voice, stunned.
Steve kept himself from tearing off his glove, from touching his wrist at all even though he wanted to more than anything, just like he always did when he needed something to hold onto. They weren’t his to have anymore, at least not in that way. He clenched his fists at his sides, staring out the window and trying hard to stay as still as possible even if the tension that had seeped into every inch of his body was so strong that he felt as though he would break into pieces any minute, a boulder shattered by ice.
“Not yet, but this isn’t all on you. Strange said this was the only way and if he saw that, then he saw that the rest of us survived too.” He covered Tony’s shaking hand with his, loosening Tony’s grip on the blanket to slip his fingers under Tony’s palm and hold his hand. “This time, you have us. You’re not doing this alone. We’ll figure it out together.”
He paused at the entrance of the kitchen. The air was thick with the rich, creamy scent of coffee.
It was a one-sided affair, a conversation that wouldn’t happen for years, but it kept him occupied, a little game to pass the time when he was bored, sad, or scared. He kept it going even when he got his mark except now that he had his real words, the ones that belonged to him and nobody else, he could imagine talking with them more vividly.
She also knows this: Tony handed over his heart to Steve—to all of them but most of all to Steve—along with the keys to his house the day he recruited them.
He waited for what they built to crash down from his push. Steve stopped his ministrations but didn’t let go—he was only waiting to heat up the ointment some more before continuing to spread it around.
He had called this home when Sam had asked him where they were going, but maybe it hadn’t been one for a long time. What he had yearned for no longer existed. The compound had turned into a cold, unwelcoming mausoleum while he was gone, and Rhodes had looked so small when they walked in, swallowed up by the vast emptiness of the room, lonely even with the holographic figures that filled it.
Steve bit his lip. “I never asked you how you were holding up.”
Nothing about their conversation so far made any sense; if anything, Steve was more confused than when he had first entered his room.
He deserved better than this.
“So do you. I only want this if you do.”
A white-hot concentrated repulsor blast. Barnes slumped on concrete, his arm a serrated stump, dazed and helpless.
If they could stop him.
He opened his eyes despite his vertigo, and for a second the powdery snow became the muted concrete of the bunker.
There were others and they didn’t make it.
“So was I,” his soulmate would tell him one day, and what it meant was that they were always with him and always would be, permanent like nothing else in his life was.
If he could remove Steve’s existence piece by piece, pluck the shrapnel out of his heart one by one, he would be whole again, or as much as he could be whole again, and it would be as if Steve had never been there at all.
Pepper covers her face. There’s a weary quake thinning out her voice that Natasha has never heard before, not even when Tony was dying and she didn’t know what was happening, just that he was behaving erratically and that every day, there were big fires to put out.
“I didn’t—I don’t want to hurt you.” Yet again, he wanted to touch Tony and this time, he let himself. He cupped the side of Tony’s face, getting as close to him as he could without going through him, and made to smooth his thumb across his cheek. “I don’t know if you’re ready, but I thought maybe...”
It’s small and barely there, little more than a tender, green seedling but there nonetheless, the start of a new beginning pushing through the ashes, germinated by wildfire.
“She just wants me to meet her in an hour.”
“The next one,” Steve promised, and Tony hummed a sleepy reply.
Except this time, and they both know it. His smile mirrors hers, and he’s gaunt, skinnier and tinier than he was in his press conference after Afghanistan, from his battle with palladium poisoning. He’s all cheekbones and sunken skin and big, sad eyes that look past her to see what remains of the team.
“They don’t mean you love me, y’know. Your words.”
“It doesn’t change anything,” he replied. He had agonized over what would be worse, not being Steve’s soulmate or being it, until he realized that it didn’t matter. Steve had chosen Barnes in the end. Would always choose him.
There were things that they never said to each other, things that they were careful not to say. But Tony thought that Steve knew them anyway; Steve kissed him, and each of his kisses felt like a prayer to bring him home.
There it was. The fracture. Barely noticeable unless you were looking for it.
“Well, it was nice catching up and all that, but I have King Kitty and Princess Leia calling my name and as the gracious host, I gotta make the rounds. You coming with, honey bear?”
He didn’t know how he would feel if he didn’t.
It was why they were in the situation they were in now. That, more than anything, made up Steve’s mind.
Steve wondered what would happen if he pushed back. He stepped closer, placing a hand on Tony’s hip and slipping his fingers through the belt loop there, reeling him in before he could think better of it. He could hear Tony suck in a breath, surprised, and he wanted to chase it past Tony’s lips. But that would have to wait even if he did give in a little and lean over him, watching Tony intently as he spoke.
Steve hesitated before gripping his arm reassuringly. Tony resisted the urge to pull away, but Steve must have felt the way his muscles had instantly seized up before he could stop them from doing so because he froze.
Their belief pays off when an aircraft flies towards the compound and they all run out to meet it, squinting in the darkness at the floodlights overhead. FRIDAY didn’t say anything which means it didn’t need clearance to touch down and that means…
He thought of everyone who had taunted or pitied him, assuming he would die before he got them, and it must have shown on his face, the way he wanted to burst into laughter, punch drunk on love, because Bucky knocked shoulders with him, grinning brightly enough that it almost felt like noon again.
Sam nodded and Steve ushered the rest out before he closed the door and turned to face Tony. Tony hadn’t moved from his spot, and Steve was much closer to him than he had expected.
He almost cried with relief when Steve’s eyes flickered open.
“This is Major Tom to Ground Control,” he drawls, and Natasha hates and loves him in equal measure for the morbid joke. She misses that. She misses him.
I can’t have you die on me.
“I know,” Tony replied. “Knew it was the last time as soon as I saw you.”
He wondered what the words underneath it were, if they were anything that he had said before, anything he had said in the past few days. He wondered if they were happier than his, his words that he had gotten so horribly wrong, that he couldn't bear to look at anymore. He wondered if and when Tony knew whom his words belonged to. If he even had Steve’s words on his skin.
His head split into two, splintering into more pieces than he could count, and darkness fell over him until he felt nothing more.
“Thought I’d drop by,” Steve said. “It’s been a while.”
The ship lands, and all of them stand tensely in a row, a somber welcoming party. Carol’s a comet tearing the night sky into two behind it, burning too brightly for them to see her face even if it hadn’t been covered by her helmet—but it doesn’t matter because the ramp descends and Tony appears at the entrance.
They were like bedtime stories, his nightmares. Horrible ones, ones he didn’t ask for, but ones that were old and familiar, ones that he knew every line of, like the stories Jarvis, Ana, and his mother would take turns reading to him as a kid. But instead of valiant knights saving the day, it was monsters that populated his stories now. Ghoulish, hideous creatures, swarms of them darkening the sky, Earth’s very own plague of locusts. Fathers who groomed their children for war, for their own gain; fathers who thought they knew best and wreaked irrevocable damage, who seemed truly sorry to some degree that it had to come to this but went through with their plans anyway. Monsters who stood by as their children died in front of them or in their arms.
Regret echoed inside his chest with nowhere to go, the force behind every reverberation growing with every rebound. Regret for what, he didn’t know. For everything that happened, he supposed, and everything that didn’t and maybe never would.
He rolled his eyes, trying and failing to keep a straight face. “Don’t start this again. You know I don’t.”
“All right, just—” And for a moment, Tony seemed unsure. “I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t want you to see this.”
“Yeah,” Rhodey said, “you know the princess got that crazy ‘I can fix this’ look in her eyes when she told me to talk to her earlier? It reminded me of you. Except she’s younger and smarter and probably less annoying.”
The words were carefully chosen to give him an out, but Tony knew what Rhodey meant. He should have been surprised, but mostly he was tired. There was an odd relief in being able to talk about a secret he had been concealing for over a year, one that had once been so precious to him that he was afraid of letting anyone find out about it.
He didn’t bother telling Steve that the ointment wasn’t that cold; it was just that his nerves shorted out from overstimulation as the cream touched his sensitive skin.
He had spent so much time imagining Tony’s wounds that the intimate familiarity made them his own. The stab of thorns and spiked leaves as sharp as the betrayal that slid between his ribs. The blood coating Tony’s tongue as unpleasant as the bile coating his when his memories had returned. The draw of every breath as painful for Tony as it was for him, Tony’s throat as abraded by growths as his was by yelling.
Tony would stop in his tracks and look his fill, the way he couldn’t any other time, knowing that Steve had been there for a while and that it was because he couldn’t sleep; it took a lot of effort for him to get that drenched with sweat, and he was up before his normal morning hours. He would wonder how his life came to this—knowing all of his teammates’ schedules, even if all of them did their own thing and preferred it that way, like he was a soccer mom with a color-coded calendar in his head—and then he would walk away, leaving Steve at it.
His wrist had been too small for his father’s until now. He supposed he could tell Peggy that he already had a band he could use and keep his mother’s for his soulmate, but found himself unwilling to part with one of the last keepsakes he had of his mother. She had seen him through all his hardships; she would carry him through the war.
“When did you know you loved him?”
“I saw Bucky in mine.”
When Ms Potts is gone, Peggy slaps energetically his shoulder with a wide grin, saying:
Tony got closer to the hearth, excited. Since he used to work in a forge, he loved fire.
Steve is pulled out of his torpor when Tony stands up, and starts picking up his clothes in a hurry.
Tony has left without a goodbye. Without a name. Without a phone number. He’d probably never come back to the bar, and Steve would never see him ever again.
Tony stopped, listening. The woods were silent and morose, and so very still, as if the animals were all hiding and the trees themselves holding their breath. As Clint, the best huntsman of the village, kept repeating drunkenly during the evening gatherings at the inn, it could mean two things: either there were humans there, making too much noise and scaring the fauna away, either there was something much more sinister, much more dangerous, and that thing was there to hunt you.
Tony nods.
Steve thought it did matter very much. There was so much they had blamed Tony of. Ultron was one of those things, and it had taken far too long to learn that Ultron wasn’t only Tony’s creation - that it was also Wanda’s, and Banner’s-.
“Steve.”
Tony stops and gapes at him, and then he’s laughing, laughing, laughing. He lets go of Steve’s arm and wipes tears out of his eyes, that’s how much he’s laughing, and Steve wants to die.
Steve couldn’t look at him. His fists were so tightly closed he could feel his nails digging into his flesh.
“Tony? Tony, what’s wrong? Please, love, talk to me,” pleaded Steve, standing up and reaching for him, hands holding on his shoulders.
“You may want to lower the volume,” he says. “The neighbors won’t be happy, and it’s almost 1 AM.”
. I fuckin’
Tony rolled his eyes.
“You don’t know me.”
“Thanks, honey bee,” purrs Tony. “I’m always a fan of your designs, I’m so lucky you’re there spoiling me.” And then he gently pushes her hands away and turns towards Steve, whose throat is all closed up and can’t breathe. “Fancy meeting you here, darling,” Tony smiles -it’s his fake smile of his, and Steve feels like vomiting-.
“Green,” whispered back Tony, and at the same time took advantage of this moment of weakness from the wolf-man to squirm out of his grasp and reach for his basket.
“Why, thank you, doctor.”
They remained immobile for a moment, working on catching back their breath, and then Steve kissed his shoulder as a warning and carefully slid out of him, rolling on his back. Tony turned over and cuddled against him, and they fell asleep. They were lying half on grass, half on a crumpled mess of Tony’s skirts, but they didn’t mind. The sun was now high in the sky, its rays were warm on their skin, and there was no wind to cool them off. Eventually, as the air turned a little colder, they woke up, and Steve licked him clean, making Tony laugh and squirm when he lapped at his skittish sides and nipples, and then moan in pleasure when he reached more intimate parts, which ended in them making love again, though this time they simply embraced each other, kissing and caressing the other.
“Ew,” says Pietro, crunching up his nose. “You had sex with a dude right next to us?
“I’ve seen your paintings, and that’s a direct look into your soul.”
The werewolf let go of him, gently. Somehow, Tony’s trembling thighs didn’t collapse and managed to keep his rear up in the air. There was a ‘pop!’ as the werewolf opened the pot of butter, and Tony sucked in a breath as lukewarm slick was spread over his cleft.
that killed my mom. I thought of him as your toy. I wanted to break it. I wanted to hit it, and hit, and hit. I wanted to beat it into a bloody pulp. And… it was even worse when you admitted knowing. I didn’t only want to hurt Barnes, I wanted to hurt you, too. Since you loved him so much that you’d trample over me without any qualms, I wanted to take him from you. So… did I try to kill Barnes? No, not really. I didn’t think nor want to kill him. But I did want to break him. I did think of him as a
he had bought for him on his nightstand, an Iron Man bookmark sticking out of it like a bright red tongue. Flung the file into a desk drawer in Steve’s office and resisted the urge to hurl the monkey sketch that he had found and framed for Steve at the wall.
He tore his gaze away from the throw. “Yeah, everything’s okay. Other than some space titan trying to wipe out half the universe, but you know.”
He should get some Advil. And coffee. There was a stained circle near the bottom of the mug, and the small amount of coffee below the dark ring had gone stale a while ago. Food would be good too. He hadn’t eaten since the morning, having nibbled on some fruit before getting thoroughly sidelined throughout the afternoon. They had been sitting out on the table for hours, and the thought of biting into a warm strawberry was unappetizing.
“Not too soon.” Steve could hear the frown in Tony’s voice. “I want you to live a long, happy life. Don’t come looking for me until you’re 120, all right?”
Tony sank his nails in, making them bite down hard so that they grew pale, long enough to puncture his skin. Blood welled around the crescents. There should have been an accompanying sting as the skin rolled up under his nails, but he hadn’t developed BARF enough to feel physical pain that didn’t happen. Hadn’t developed it because that wasn’t its purpose, because that was the opposite of its purpose. The disconnect between his senses left a sour tang in his mouth, curdling the feral desperation that had pumped through him only a moment ago. Malaise trickled down his spine like the runnels of beer-sweat and melted snow that soaked his T-shirt.
(Because it would only come in the form of Tony’s forgiveness.)
“Steve,” he whispered. He placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. It was cold and stiff under his hand; at some point, he had taken off his gauntlet, hoping against hope that he would still register warmth, still register Steve breathing under him except he was trembling too much to notice if Steve was even if he tried.
“I don’t think it matters, what you meant,” he said unsteadily.
“You’re my soulmate,” Steve said softly, and something deep inside that Tony now realized he hadn’t properly buried fell apart at the confession. He had waited so long to hear someone say that, for Steve to say that. Had imagined what it would be like for it to happen.
“Why are we doing this?” Steve cut in, muted and somber.
Sam cocked his head at the others, stopping in the doorway before he left. “I’ll save you some food if I don’t see you at dinner,” he said kindly.
Later, when he had gotten out of the shower and put on his band without glancing at his wrist once, Tony went over his conversation with Rhodey again.
Steve had never been like that with him before.
Tony’s throat constricted. It took a long while for the tightness to fade before he was able to speak.
“I fell in love with you the first day you showed up in town,” Tony said simply, like it was the answer to everything. And once, he would have been embarrassed to say that, to be so direct, but this was old ground that they had trodden on many times before.
Tony’s stomach swooped unpleasantly, leaving him woozy and nauseous.
But they welcomed them back, and just like Jim didn’t hesitate to embrace her, Pepper doesn’t as she places her hand over Natasha’s on her shoulder and holds onto her. It’s invaluable, this level of forgiveness and acceptance into their circle and Tony’s, this trust. Natasha doesn’t know if it’s earned, but she’ll do everything she can so that it is and that she can keep it regardless.
To his surprise, Steve smiled warmly at him. “I didn’t fall in love with you because I found out you were my soulmate. That only made me realize what was already there.” He stared straight ahead again, contemplative. “I think…I think I was always drawn to you from the start. But I didn’t even want to think about it because I was so fixated on my soulmate that I refused to even consider anyone else, even you. Only took losing you to realize how stupid I was being.”
Except…
In this new world that he woke up to, things had changed. It wasn’t like how it used to be, with people hiding their marks until they found their soulmates. The only people who tended to hide them back then were those who hadn’t found their soulmates yet or those whose words were too private or too risky to reveal. But most people proudly showed their words to the world now, and there were more bare wrists than not these days.
Natasha wonders if Steve understood what that meant. What Tony meant.
He hated it.
He knew that he had only a little while before the sun dipped entirely past the horizon; darkness came early at this time of year, thick and obscurant, and the flashlight on his phone would drain his battery rapidly if he wasn’t careful. He walked in bigger strides, opting not to soak in all the beauty around him, only thinking of the beauty that lay ahead.
“The end of the world and here we are,” Tony said, not turning to look at him. “Still alive after it ended.” He gazed at the wall, his eyes unseeing. Thousand-yard stare. That was what they had called it after the war. It was an apt phrase; Tony was far away, somewhere isolated and unreachable. “So many people died,” he added softly. There was something in his voice, a suggestion of self-recrimination that leached through.
“I’m not trying to pick a fight. I…I don’t want to see him get hurt or worse, that’s all. Maybe we can have him on rescue or evac, keep him far from the front lines.”
“Because—”
The rush of breath that left Steve like someone had slid a knife between his ribs when they walked past a café in Porto playing it on TV. The missed step as he exhaled. The shattered misery on his face that he used to hide so well until Tony blew apart his defenses in Siberia, mangling everything impossibly out of shape so that he couldn’t weld his walls shut again.
Where was he?
Steve’s expression was severe in its intensity, and Tony could have mistaken it for dogged determination had it not been for the cracks he had made. Misery broke through, lacquering every line, a twisted
The war was too cruel and indiscriminate to allow for them; they couldn’t afford to make promises. Not in their line of work where tomorrows were never guaranteed.
She knows it’s because he loves Tony.
He folded his chestplate back, waiting as it retreated into his undersuit fast and slick like liquid metal, and grabbed his band, throwing it to the side, not caring where it landed as he pulled off Steve’s glove and then his band.
“Ma used to do this for me, and I learned by watching. I got good at it during the war.”
“You know, I always admired your ability to look stunning even when things go to shit,” he mumbles into her hair, curling a lock that’s still blond around his finger. It’s grown in the past months, turning into an untamed mess of scarlet and gold, but she hadn’t been able to bring herself to chop off her dyed hair. She still doesn’t feel like herself. She couldn’t care less about how she looks and hasn’t looked at her reflection in a long time.
What had Thor said? The wielder had to have resolve. The pure, unshakable kind. The resolve of a titan, formidable and unmovable, untainted by doubt and distractions.
“I know.” And whatever they’re talking about, there’s no lie in what Tony says and no false appeasement in what he says next. “I was going to call you.”
So when Natalie had become Natasha, when Fury had told him he failed his boy band audition, when Steve had been disappointed in him because of Ultron, it was easy to roll with the punches. Tony knew how to step away so that the glancing stab, always surprisingly sharper than he expected, wouldn’t run through him even if it landed, knew how to staunch the wound and smother the pain so that it wouldn’t spread through him like poison.
“Just like old times,” Tony almost said, but they were too aware of the way it wasn’t, too sad about that for him to say it, and he didn’t want Steve to know that he couldn’t sleep anyway.
That was what Thanos had wanted, a peace of sorts.
“You don’t deserve it,” he said because he wanted to ask what he did to deserve him instead, but he didn’t know how.
“He’ll find a way to get back to us.”
It was so easy to pretend it was a normal lazy Saturday afternoon from bygone days. There were no clouds in the sky and back then, they would have taken advantage of the balmy weather to cook outdoors, content to sit back and relax for once. No world to save, their biggest worry Vision burning patties on the grill.
. That’s what we do, Steve.” He watched as self-recrimination and regret warred on Steve’s face before summoning his courage to forge on. “You said ‘Together,’” he said shakily. He forced himself not to reach for his left wrist, to play with the band around it. “You always said that win or lose, whatever the circumstances, that we’d face it together. Did you ever mean it?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve mumbled guiltily into his hair.
He wasn’t going to let himself be the reason why Steve let the world pass him by again. He had seen what came of that with Peggy Carter and with Barnes. He was the result of it.
“Hold me close, wherever you’re going,” Steve said, feeling the part of him that had kept Tony here for so long leave him and join Tony. “The rest of me will follow later.”
His uniform, the one he wears when they go out to help nowadays, is his old stealth suit. The dirty, fraying one that he constantly wore on the run even when it was wiser to change outfits as she and Sam did was barely salvageable after the fight with Thanos, not that he’d want to see it anyway. There’s blood and ash on it that won’t come out even when it’s clean.
“We don’t even have scraps. Jesus, Strange kept me alive and for what? All my plans—” Tony cut himself off, pressing his lips together, his breathing uneven. “There’s nothing. I have nothing. Not a single clue to just point us in the right direction.”
This Tony, the one that stood in front of him, smiling brightly with the whole of Manhattan waking up behind him…only Steve got to see this.
He imagined it would be something like this.
“I would’ve been late even if you did.” The confession comes out bitter, a knife pointed inwards. “I would’ve lost—” Steve’s voice is hoarse, mangled with regret. “I’m not letting that happen again. Even if you can’t trust me, you have me at your side, Tony. No matter what.”
He couldn’t go back and change the fact that he had held onto his word for so long, for one thing.
Steve squeezed Tony’s shoulder again before letting it go. He picked up the plate, pushing it to Tony’s chest so that Tony instinctively grabbed it before his mind could catch up. “Get some rest,” he told Tony firmly.
, he thought savagely.
Where was—
“Mm?”
The one thing that had mattered most was Steve staying safe. He could deal with everything that came his way just as long as that was the case, just as long as they won, except Steve had gotten hurt defending him.
Bucky leaned forward, winter blue eyes wide with wonder. He opened his mouth, shut it, and then opened it again. Steve would have teased him if he hadn’t felt just as stunned.
The past two years had taught him this: he didn’t need Steve. And the safer choice would most likely be to keep Steve at a distance.
He went right. He hadn’t gone into his lab since he came back. He didn’t see a point. There was no battle to win. There could be no more battles after this. The war had been one to end all battles.
“Told me he had the best time ever at camp and to keep in touch, xoxo,” he said as he quelled the urge to throw them into a drawer and bang it shut. “We’re going to talk over the phone for hours, gossiping about boys, I know it.”
Ships fell from the sky, as they had in the first wave, and swarms of alien troops had them all busy. They needed as many reinforcements they could, and Strange and Wong had teleported Thor, Bruce, and what remained of the Guardians to join the fray. The Avengers at the compound were getting ready to head out, the headquarters devolving into organized chaos. Everyone—the Avengers, their allies, and an assortment of military personnel—scurried this way and that, preoccupied with their own preparations and the latest updates pouring in from around the world.
“I said I’d be there if you needed me,” he said to that Tony inside of him, an ache knotting his heart.
went for it considering you don’t love cheese…that…much…”
A kind voice.
Not for the first time, Natasha’s forced to confront just how little she knows about Tony Stark. She’s sorry, not the way that she was back when she wanted to apologize to Tony for seeing only what he wanted her to see when writing her report. She’s sorry for herself. It’s a rare feeling. But she’s known Tony for nearly a decade, and she thought that she would know him better by now.
The movement’s magnetic—Tony’s magnetic. His gravitational pull is something Steve has never been able to resist ever since they met. It tugs Steve forward, out of the darkness.
“Yes,” Steve rebutted firmly. “You have everything it takes. You always did. And you got something else that Thanos doesn’t.” His face was pinched, his breathing labored; he paid a high cost for every word, and Tony wanted to scream at him to stop talking. “Your belief in a better future. Your hope. Y’never give up ’cause of that, Iron Man. S’why I love you.” His smile was crooked, sloppy as his words which came out slurred, vowels and consonants melting into one another, dribbling out of his mouth like another kind of blood.
Steve cupped his head in his hands, tenderly, like he wanted nothing more than to take care of him. He was always so gentle when they parted.
Something dangerous brewed inside him.
Steve, on the other hand, stands rigidly as though any sudden move will have a butterfly effect that will ripple out and somehow kill Tony.
There’s no lingering rancor even if she and Jim would have been well within their rights to be angry with them. Natasha wouldn’t have blamed them if they had left Steve and her out in the cold, keeping them at arm’s length after everything.
He was in Massachusetts, not Siberia.
This was. The proof that Steve cared hurt worse than anything.
There was no meaning behind their deaths, no reason behind who died and who lived.
And then
“Saved some for you from dinner.” Steve stared at the screen. “Was that Thor?”
One where no one had free will.
That was a pool of vomit next to him, not splatters of blood.
How long had Steve been there? Had he dragged himself to the rubble before Tony had opened the box, had he died waiting because Tony had been too slow, too stupid, too scared to finish his job in time?
. All I can do is protect him the best I can.”
And because Tony was Tony until the end, he replied, with as much conviction as Han Solo had, “I know.” He sounded the way he always did when he couldn’t stop smiling. “And you know I love you too. So long, Steve. See you in a century.”
A riotous beauty in constant motion (but still at the moment because he slowed down for Steve; he always did), someone who could go miles and leave the whole world in his dust but, miraculously, unfathomably, returned every time, no matter how far he traveled.
They ignore it.
It was an early morning in Manhattan, and everyone was back to their daily routines, going to work, cursing the MTA, lining up at food carts. Cranes filled the sky and clean-up crews shifted detritus away, a constant drilling, banging, and beeping polluting the air.
His soulmate would be his confidant, his home. He would tell them things that he couldn’t tell anyone else, place all his deepest hopes and fears in the safest hands he knew.
His words had come in.
He stayed quiet.
His legs could no longer support his weight. He dropped to one knee and placed a hand on the ground for balance. The grass was wet under his fingers, the dirt cool and damp from the rain that had fallen that morning.
It would have been so much easier if Steve hadn’t been a soldier. He would have been able to squirrel Steve away in one of his apartments then, see him whenever he liked. Pamper him; give him everything he wanted; keep him safe, comfortable, and happy, as far away from the war as possible. But Steve would have never been okay with that, didn’t want a life like that, and that was why Tony loved him in the first place.
“And what if that’s not enough?”
Steve gave a crooked smile. “I don’t think you ever were.”
A hand reached out to hold the bag in place.
Natasha lay in an unnatural position not too far from him, eerily similar to how she looked in his nightmares. Tony couldn’t bring himself to check whether she was alive or simply unconscious and knew that she wouldn’t want him to, not when Mantis was pulling her to a more sheltered spot and all of their efforts had to go to stopping Thanos as soon as possible.
But silence has never served the two of them well, and Natasha wants them to break it, to avoid the same pitfalls as before, leaving things unsaid, letting too much time pass. They’ve both been hurting for too long.
A bird took flight, mute except for one short, morose cry as it circled above them.
“He’s the bravest man I know, and I never told him that.”
“I knew it,” Steve said, low and disappointed. No, not disappointed. Dismayed. He sounded as if he wished he were wrong, as if he didn’t want to see Tony this way.
The words came in as Steve dragged himself home from the game, sharp enough to make him gasp and clutch his left wrist. It was one of those sweltering July evenings where the cover of dusk did little to alleviate the humidity and the heat left him groggy and slow, but the unexpected pain cleared the fog from his mind. He dealt with pain often enough that he was almost used to it, but this was different, unfamiliar and needlepoint precise as it lanced straight through him down to his marrow.
It was 1985.
“You always gotta prove everyone wrong, huh?” he asked.
“I do have a thing for older men. But I mean it.” Tony’s voice sounded faded now, an echo of a memory. “Make a life for yourself here. For me.”
Pain. Anger. Loss and heartbreak.
“I did consider signing the Accords,” Steve reminded him. “I wasn’t convinced by them and I don’t agree with how you treated Wanda even if I understand why you did it. But I thought that we’d have time to work on it together after we dealt with everything in Siberia and came back, to address the issues in it and make it better like you said.” Steve picked at a thread that had come off his sweatpants at his knees, twirling it absentmindedly, lost in thought. “And even with Zemo, I knew you’d help if you could and you proved me right. You have no idea how happy I was to see you.”
Tony held onto him, firmly, and Steve answered him with a gentle squeeze of his own.
“Together, huh?” Steve said huskily.
Hulk wrenched the Gauntlet off of Thanos’s arm as Gamora and Nebula tore into him, knives carving thick, punishing grooves into Thanos’s face from top to bottom, down his eyes to his chin. The blinding rays emitting from the Gauntlet winked out immediately as the Gauntlet dropped, Thanos roaring with anger and pain as several on their side joined Hulk and the sisters.
An unexpected voice on the line. One that he hadn’t heard in years, one that he hadn’t been sure he would hear again.
“I don’t need you,” he wanted to say, but he smiled and said nothing, and maybe that was answer enough.
The answer hadn’t been enough then, and it wouldn’t be now. They were being picked off with ease.
