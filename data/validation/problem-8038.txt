"You don't have to be here because you feel
. There were smudges of dark, heavy bruises under his eyes, as well as curling around past his shirt cuffs and collar. There'd been bruises all over his body earlier, Steve had seen, before they'd— before they'd gotten dressed, and Steve could only imagine how bad they must look now, huge finger-shaped marks of purple and deep, dark greens from his neck to his feet. And Tony still hadn't shaved, so his meticulous goatee had softened into a full beard, the unkempt edges curling around his lips and jaw. He had a tall glass of… something, in his hand, and Steve would bet dollars to donuts that Tony was more booze than blood at this point.
Tony looked stricken. Steve would be in agony if he knew this wasn't for the man's own good. "Honey‒" he started; he coughed to clear his throat. "Steve, honestly, the spa? You hate the spa."
," Steve gasped. "S-so good, Tony, that's so good— good boy." He reached out to stroke and touch Tony's face, spread his legs out wide so he could wrap them around Tony's hips again. "Tony, Tony," he murmured, petting Tony's cheeks. "Look at me." Tony's hips stuttered on the next thrust and he shuddered, eyes blinking blearily open so he could stare down at Steve's deep blue, soft and shining eyes. "You're so good, Tony," Steve told him, clenching down tight around Tony's cock. "Thank you for giving this to me—" Tony gasped, felt his raw, ugly emotions rearing their heads once more, but Steve kept his hands clasped on either side of Tony's face. "You're such a good boy," Steve moaned, and pressed a kiss to his lips. Steve came, sighing in relief almost, come dribbling out of his chafed, red, angry cock, and then he was mouthing gently at Tony's lips again. "Again," he begged, licking into Tony's mouth. "Again, please."
Steve smiled, pulled on the collar of his robe until it pooled on the floor beneath them. "Let's go to bed, Tony," he said, pulling back the thick, quilted comforter and burying them both inside of it. Tony shivered again, and Steve pulled him in close, pressing Tony's head into the crook of his neck. His legs slipped between Tony's own, the thick, corded muscle impossibly warm and soft as they tangled their bodies tight together. Tony could hear the strong beating of Steve's heart, the heavy thudding of his pulse in his throat. He could feel the soft dusting of hair on Steve's calves and thighs, the coarse curls of the pubic hair at his groin. Steve's fingers crawled up to pet the nape of Tony's neck. "You're so good to me," he praised, and Tony's breath hitched in his throat, a soft, sound stuck in the back of it.
," Steve moaned brokenly, and then he was coming, shooting down Tony's throat, in his mouth, down his chin. Tony's jaw ached, clicked when he tried to close it, so he just let it hang open, laving his tongue over Steve's cockhead even through his wet, shaky gasps and jittering hips. The dildo fucked into him and Tony couldn't still his hips, couldn't stop the gentle rutting against the cushion and then Steve's cock was slipping from his lips and Tony fucking
," Jan said. "
and you want me to stick my dick back in you?" Steve asked angrily, giving him a little shake. "What's the matter with you?"
"I can't—" Steve's lashes were fluttering, and Tony could see the veins in his neck bulging outward. "It won't stop."
—" he sobbed, his hips stuttering and trying to eke out the last vestiges of pleasure from his sweat-soaked, tired body.
"Shh," Steve whispered again. "'Gotta make sure you can get the dildo in first, Shellhead ‒ it won't do us any good to hurt yourself before we even start." And god, Steve was right, Tony had no business trying to rush him, if Tony got hurt before Steve had a chance to fuck him‒
"I have no idea what this is," Jan admitted, pushing back from the microscope and yanking a hand through her hair. "His body's obviously working to metabolize it, but it's staying in his system and I have no idea why."
Tony swirled his tongue around the tip of Steve's cock again, lapping gently at his slit and sucking away the salty-sweet precome that dripped from him. It was heady, the weight and the taste of Steve on his tongue, the way it jerked when he bobbed his head or played at his foreskin. Tony wondered if he was this sensitive everywhere. Would sucking on his neck warrant the same response? His nipples?
Really, this entire week was an exercise in Tony's dick being harder than it had ever been, more
"You're so close already," Tony murmured, lightly awestruck. God, and that was one of the hottest things about Steve, how he could get so worked up over the simplest things, like Tony blowing him, how he took care not to grab Tony's hair and drag him down without warning, how he always managed to rein himself in to practically the point of pain, but he couldn't hold back how
"You… what?" Steve's breath caught. He felt off-kilter, out of time, like he'd just woken up again and found everything flipped on its axis, but this time it felt
There was a knock at the door and a soft "Hey, Shellhead," and Tony was flying across the room before he knew it, wrenching the door open and‒ Oh.
"You have
"Sorry," Tony murmured again, lifting his head so he could nuzzle against Steve.
of you," Tony wailed, trying to cry into his fists again, but Steve wouldn't let him, wouldn't let his face go and just pulled him forward until their heads were knocking together and Steve was rolling his forehead to Tony's and breathing each other's air. Tony fisted his trembling hands, pulled them into his lap and tried to get his breathing under control. "I-I
It wasn't long before Steve was squirming, before he was actively holding off his orgasm, his legs shaking and teeth digging into his lip in an attempt to stave it off. "O-oh, Tony, Tony— I can't, stop, I- I'm too close, I—" Steve stuttered, shaking his head. Tony immediately let go and Steve's dick slapped up against his stomach, and Steve nearly sobbed at the intense
"That's my boy," Tony murmured, burying his nose into Steve's hair and inhaling deeply. "That's my good, good boy, Steve, thank you," he praised and Steve felt awful, mortifying tears prickling behind his eyes. When Steve gasped another lungful in, he cried out, just a hair, and Tony hummed and kissed him again, ran a hand soothingly down his flank. "I tried to push you too hard too soon, I think," Tony said eventually, lips brushing Steve's cheekbones. "That's my fault, darling, I'm so sorry."
Tony was throwing some bottles of electrolyte drink into an ice chest when Steve snapped awake, a soft, questioning noise in the back of his throat, and Tony was there immediately, sliding back onto the bed, one hand rubbing across the broad muscle of his chest.
," Steve moaned brokenly.
Tony was about to just say fuck it and roll back over when there were big, strong arms wrapping around him, and Steve was lifting Tony in the air, shifting the plug agonizingly inside of him. Steve shushed him, pet a hand through his stringy, sweat-damp hair. "Can you stand?" he asked.
"Dialysis would only work if we saw the cells making their way to his endocrine system, but so far it all seems to be concentrated in the brain."
"Come on now, Stark," Steve said lightly, dragging his fingers through the curl of Tony's hair. "Y'gonna hide that pretty face from me?" His foot shifted, sole sliding across the carpet, and Tony's eyes tracked the movement of his thigh, thick and golden-dusted and oh-so-mouthwateringly tempting as Steve spread his legs, drawing attention to the heavy, spit-slick cock between them, already thickening and filling up with blood again. "I bet I know what you need," he continued, twirling his fingers just so, so that they caught on the thick strands. Tony could feel his breath quicken, his heart begin to pound inside his chest. "You need to suck me, baby, don't you?" Steve asked, his lips curling into a kind smile, the blue of his eyes darkening against his lust-blown pupils, and God, oh God
The scientist went flying, crashing into a wall of shelves. Cap pulled a particularly nasty-looking shard of glass out of his jaw, spitting blood onto the floor, and stalked over to where he was stumbling up amidst the broken beakers. There was another string of Russian, something Tony didn't quite catch, and then the scientist grabbed an Erlenmeyer from the shelves behind them and smashed it on the floor. Bright sticky powder, some hideous fluorescent orange, splattered across the three of them, painting them with the force of it as it billowed all around them.
, was the damndest thing: Tony's cockhead, flushed and dark and red, like sweet cherries, bobbed and twitched above his neatly groomed hair that would've got him called a sissy back in his time (Well, maybe not for the hair, and maybe not
"I just can't seem to help myself when I'm around you," Tony confessed, pressing kisses up and down his jawline, his own hips starting to roll back and forth in the air. Before Steve could chastise him any further, he reached into Steve's pants, fingers wrapping around his bare cock, and Steve gasped, captured Tony's lips in a heated kiss. Tony started to stroke him messily, and Steve whimpered into his mouth, lifting his arms up so he could tangle his hands in Tony's hair, fuck his cock into Tony's fist. "Remember not to come, darling," Tony reminded him, then surged forward to capture Steve's mouth again, his tongue diving in and claiming him once again.
"Mm, last I saw he was in the gym trying to run a marathon on that fancy treadmill you got him," Jan piped up, rolling a pencil back and forth across the table.
excited," he admitted roughly, staring down at his socked feet, the one fraying strand at the edge of the sole.
"This doesn't make me any less of a man," Tony whispered to himself, bending over to dip one leg, then the other into the panties and sliding them up to his hips. He shivered at the feeling of the lace and nylon stockings on the bare, freshly waxed skin, the way the buckles of the garter felt clipping into place, curling low in his gut and throbbing hotly, making him nearly dizzy with desire. "I like how I feel wearing these," Tony whispered to his reflection ‒ and besides, Steve was at this moment in time putting on‒
. I want you. You know I do." Ever so gently, Steve lifted his leg up, tangled it between Tony's calves, bumped his still hard cock to Tony's groin. "You can feel how much I want you, can't you?"
"Don't worry then, my dear, I've got you," Tony whispered, lifting up on his knees and grabbing the base of Steve's cock from him. "I've got you darling, just let go, I've got you—" He sank down, probably more quickly then he should've, but there was lube on Steve's dick and his ass was still a little soft, so it was only minorly uncomfortable—not nearly as bad as what Steve had to be feeling. Tony rolled his hips, grit his teeth and squeezed his eyes shut and tried to work Steve's cock further into him.
There actually was a stash of chocolate bars next to the water bottles and ration packs, but Tony figured Steve could use them more, so he popped a couple squares in his mouth to appease the mother hen before shoving the rest of the bar plus two more at Steve. He chewed on them silently with a blissed almost-smile on his face, pacing up and down the deck with a little bounce in his step, snapping his fingers restlessly against his thigh.
Steve whined, felt it catch and turn into another shout in his throat as Tony's mouth latched onto his hole. Jesus, he— how was he supposed to focus on
at how worked up, how far under he felt already, from kissing of all things. "S-sorry," he blurted before he could stop himself. "I don't know what's gotten into to me tonight."
"Hi," Tony murmured, nuzzling the side of his face to Steve's pec.
Steve smiled then, something rare and precious and beautiful, and it clenched the quiet, secret, squishy parts of Tony to see it. He ruffled a hand through Tony's hair, helping him to stand up and lean against the wall so he could move to strip the sheets.
"Hey, hey, killer," Tony soothed, both hands sliding up to cup at Steve's face. Steve could smell himself, the sharp, musky scent of his desire, and couldn't help the shudder that went through him again, wrapping Tony up in his arms like he'd get bored and leave if Steve didn't hold tight. "Hey, my love, hey, it's alright," Tony murmured, kissing his hair, his forehead. Steve could feel the hot brand of Tony's cock on his abs, inches from his own, but Tony didn't even grind against him as he kissed Steve sweetly, sensually, guided Steve's jaw open so Tony could lick into his mouth. Steve whimpered, let his mouth fall slack so Tony could just— take, what he wanted. It'd be alright if Steve let him take charge for a little bit, wouldn't it?
"I was hoping you'd say that," Steve said, smiling brightly as he leaned over and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to Tony's lips.
flexed and moved on either side of him, the soft golden hairs catching the light from the lamp on the bedside table just so, glittering. Tony could feel Steve's feet flexing into the sheets, his hands fisting the coverlet, the loud, jagged moans ripping from his throat as he pulled in and out, kept fucking in and out of Tony's mouth. His cock ached, and his balls were heavy and tight against his skin, and Tony had to physically stop himself from reaching down to jerk himself off.
, but all Steve did was drape himself along Tony, reach one of his big, warm hands down to Tony's cock. "There you go, baby," Steve whispered, low and sex-rough as he rubbed his thumb over Tony's sensitive tip. He whimpered again, biting back a sob as he felt his cock pulse, his legs jerking in the cuffs.
," Steve growled, shaking his head.
"I love you, Tony," Steve whispered, kissed him, and let himself sink into the tub.
"M-mm-mm," Tony hummed, shaking his head wildly from side to side. Steve fingered his balls again, and Tony gasped and writhed in his grip. "C-came close once or twice. My refractory period isn't yours, y'know? Didn't really see the point."
"It— it's more than that," Tony whispered, his eyes falling to the side again. He screwed his eyes shut, a grimace twisting his lips. "I-I, I love you, and I-I'd do anything for you—" Tony sniffled and wiped at his nose. "And I'm nowhere good enough for you."
Tony whimpered, tried to squirm in Steve's grip. His mouth felt wet, and slack, like he'd been drooling into his beard. He sucked in a breath through his teeth, hard, in an attempt to keep himself from making an even bigger mess of himself. "I-I-It's not necessary, big guy," Tony whispered, tried not to tremble too obviously as Steve started grinding in against his sweet spot again.
"Really?" Steve asked, suddenly shy, or possibly embarrassed, another cherry blossom flush painting itself across his cheeks. "That's— that's something you want?"
," Tony whispered, wrapped his arms around Steve's middle. He felt his own heart pounding as if it was going to burst from his chest, overlarge like the Grinch on Christmas morning.
," Tony moaned, squirming against Steve in the way that told him this was one of Tony's 'out there' kinks, that he was a little self-conscious about the whole thing.
"Nay," Thor rumbled, his massive golden arms crossed across his chest. "The good Captain has not yet arrived."
"That means you gotta stop kissin' me, stud," Tony teased lightly, nipping at Steve's earlobe.
in tandem with the harsh jerking of his hand around his cock, and holy Jesus, he was not going to be able to hold off now.
Tony groaned, biting down on his lower lip. "G-good," he replied. "That's so good, sugar." Tony allowed himself another slow grind of his hips before sliding down Steve's body until his feet and knees hit the floor beneath him. He bit lightly at Steve's inner thigh, letting the rough scratch of his goatee follow.
By the time Tony made his way to the gym, Steve had graduated from the treadmill to the punching bags. He was drenched from head to toe, and he must have been at it for a while considering how long it took for Steve to even break a sweat. As he watched, Steve reared his fist back, slamming it into the bag with a grunt; the bag split at the seams and sand started spilling onto the floor, and even Tony could see from the door that his knuckles were torn and bright red with blood.
"Honestly, I hesitate to give him much more of anything right now," the woman, Nguyen, admitted, reaching out to manually take Steve's pulse. She looked at her watch and frowned. "We've given him enough to put down an elephant and then some, and his heart rate is still climbing. I'm afraid if we give him much more, it could shut down his entire central nervous system."
Steve moaned below him, and Tony's gaze shifted back, to the droplets of sweat clinging to his bangs, the fluttering of his lashes as he gasped unashamedly into Tony's fingers fucking into him, his hips circling as if he couldn't get enough of the feeling.
It didn't take long (Tony wasn't particularly surprised, given how responsive Steve was) before Steve was tensing up underneath him, his hands and thighs trembling and a steady stream of
Before Tony could say
Tony sighed, blissed. "I," he started with a conspiratory whisper, "am going to give you so many blowjobs."
"Sign me up for the next available slot," Tony murmured, signing his name at the bottom of the form. He took a swig from his thermos, some fruity vodka concoction he'd thrown together in the limo. "And I'll see you Monday for chemo."
Something hot and squirmy rolled in Tony's belly. He nodded, flushing a bit further, and turned on his side, pulled his knees up, let himself relax again. "M' all yours, handsome," he whispered, and then Steve's hand was on his tailbone, and the tip of the enema pipe was gently easing in. His body was still soft and loose, and Steve obviously knew it he was doing, because there wasn't even a pinch or any awkward movements from the soft silicone - just one quick, easy slide. This, Tony was very familiar with.
"Nonsense, dear," Tony simpered, folding and unfolding his fingers one-by-one, watching the way the joints interconnected, how the servos whirred and vibrated under his skin. Steve's cup and undershirt hit the cement floor, then he moved on to yanking off the boots. "What's the point of having a billionaire fund you if you don't take advantage of the perks?"
He was on top now, pawing at the mouth that was under him, slack and sloppy and open. Steve grunted, had to dig his forehead into the sheets and groan, push his cock in and as far back as the throat would allow. Three thick drops of sweat slid down his forehead to his nose.
, Tony thought to himself, petting through the sweat-soaked strands of Steve's hair.
, he thought hysterically, and a sharp whine came from inside the bedroom.
, Steve."
make a load of sense? What would be more… more humiliating than Captain America, paragon of wholesome restraint and virtue, reduced to some mindless, rutting animal? Too wound up to fight (to think even), just an overactive amygdala and an overwhelming sense of need.
, god, now his ass was in the air, his hole flexing against the cool lube and even cooler air. He exhaled slowly out, settling onto the ramp; he could already feel himself slipping back into his headspace as Steve pulled his arms and legs to the sides, clipping in his ankles first before shuffling forward into Tony's field of vision.
more embarrassing? Was he so hungry- so slutty for Steve's praise that just a simple 'good boy' had him rocketing up to the edge of orgasm?
"God look at you," Steve whispered reverently, fingers sliding out of Tony with a wet, slick sound. Behind him, Tony could hear Steve slicking up his cock, and a shiver slid up Tony's spine at the thought that
"Tony, yesterday I shot spunk up my own nose," Steve told him firmly, and Tony giggled half-heartedly into the porcelain. "I think it is safe to say that anything I could see here is not half as bad as that. Besides," he continued, petting through the sweat-slick hair at the nape of Tony's neck, "you just went above and beyond for me — how could I not do the same for you?"
, he just had to hold off a little longer—
"Nuh-uh, not a chance handsome," Tony murmured, crawling over Steve's side so he could tuck a leg under Steve's hip. It was a testament to how out of it Steve was, how much pain he must have been in that he let Tony do that: let Tony wrap his knees around Steve's ribs and roll him onto his back. Steve's hand didn't stop, but it did slow, his flushed, tear-stricken face staring blearily up at Tony.
"Mmm," Steve agreed, nosing the curls at the nape of Tony's neck. "My pleasure, Shellhead." Tony felt Steve's hips start to move again, the steady, back and forth rocking. Had Steve gone soft, even once? "Mm, I haven't," Steve murmured, and Tony flushed to realize he'd asked the question out loud. "How could I when I've got such a gorgeous guy in my arms?" Steve sat up, pulling Tony up with him so Tony was kneeling in front of Steve, the rolling swell of his belly out on display. Tony could hear Steve's cock, the squelching, sucking back and forth of it in and out of his hole, could feel the heat of it well up in his ass, practically up in his chest. And Tony, he- he knew that was impossible, Steve's dick wasn't
Tony still hadn't answered his texts.
Steve was doing a loop of the second floor (his room was still being… steam-cleaned, so Steve had a few of his things in a guest room for the time being) when he passed by Tony's room and heard—
"Mm, nine?" Tony asked sleepily, his lashes fluttering as he gazed adoringly up at Steve. "Ten? Did you come twice that last time?"
, Tony," Steve said, voice hushed. "You're so good to me," he continued then, lips glancing along the side of Tony's goatee. "Even I may need a nap after all that."
"There's a— ah," Tony called back, unsure, suddenly why he felt so embarrassed. "There's a— a hose in the bag."
Steve flushed, felt the dizzying rush of humiliation at Tony's words. He couldn't be that obvious, could he? He pulled out of Tony's arms, trying hard not to clench his teeth. It was— it was one thing when Steve was the one driving, when he was the one calling the shots. It was easier then, to sort of let go with Tony. But when it came to
When Tony's face was scrubbed and his breath all minty-fresh, Steve piled the two of them in Tony's overly large and comfortable bed, pulling the covers around them both. Tony immediately set to snuggling them together, tangling his cold feet in between the warmth of Steve's calves. Without the robe now, Steve could see more than ever the stark bruising, the mess of black and blue spanning his torso, hips, and thighs.
"Yeah, there we go," Steve praised, thumbs massaging gently around the edges of Tony's chest. "I'm gonna sit back against the headboard now, and pull you in my lap, okay? What's your color, Tony?"
, you moron—"
Tony made another noise, something soft and high and wanting, and then he was sliding forward, softening his jaw and huffing through his nose as Steve's cock slid further into his mouth and down the back of his throat. Tony moaned, felt the tremor of it on his tongue, had to put his hands on Steve's knees to steady himself. It was true, all of it. As much as he loved to talk, he loved sucking Steve's cock more; he, couldn't help himself, really. Everything about it — from the smell and taste of him, to the way he felt in Tony's mouth, filled him to choking, sometimes, to the way Steve hardly ever let himself go, was always so, so gentle and careful with how the two of them made— made love.
"T—" Steve's tongue was thick in his mouth, like it was stuck in syrup, sweet and slick. "Tony—" This, this was something they should talk about, this wasn't something Steve should just let slide—
"It was—" Tony's tongue felt sticky again, and he smacked his lips, pressed a kiss to Steve's palm. "It was absolutely wonderful, my darling," Tony confessed. "Ten out of ten, would sub again—"
"Don't be sorry," Steve said, trying to slow his kisses down even as the felt them getting hotter, more sensual in the way Tony's tongue traced his, and the leg trying to hitch itself over Steve's hip.. "You're injured, and I-I'm just makin' it worse, hell."
Tony snorted, took a sip of some bubbly concoction sitting on the bedside table. "Honey, I'm a genius, remember?" When he turned to Steve, Steve gasped, one hand darting up before he could stop himself, pressing ever so gently to the giant bruise on the side of Tony's face.
"You got this," Steve told him, then Tony could really feel the stretch of what had to be the widest part of the plug (
It was goddamn bliss, is what it was.
A loud, embarrassing noise built in the back of Tony's throat and he hiccuped, sobbed once, trying to keep it inside. "
"It was absolutely perfect," Steve confessed, and rolled over to bury himself in Tony's arms.
"Cap, I'd like you to go down to Medical," Tony started slowly, one hand very, very carefully reaching over to the emergency shut off for the treadmill.
It was just… a bit humiliating, he supposed, the self-proclaimed playboy Tony Stark feeling inadequate because his dick looked tiny compared to Captain America's. Tony sighed in resignation, turning away to grab pull open one of the transport crates when Steve's hand shot out, fingers lightning quick snapping around Tony's wet, sticky arm.
Tony felt so good afterwards (so

"Whatever you need," Tony promised, and Steve was clenching finger-shaped bruises into Tony's sides, pressing soft kisses to Tony's cheek and jaw and lips as he rutted against him. Tony hissed, and moaned, felt his cock harden in his soft silky panties. It felt like he hadn't come in so long, and the- the thought of just rubbing against Steve like this until he came was so tempting it made his entire body throb with need. "The sky's the limit here, Cap," Tony continued, mouthing at the edge of Steve's jaw. "I can jerk you off. Or you could fuck my mouth? Work off some of that energy that's got you buzzin'."
Tony moaned.
Because of course that would be Tony's main concern — that he wanted to make it
"I can go get whatever's at the door?" Steve asked, moving to stand.
"Well, we're not going to let that happen, darling," Tony murmured, and brought his knuckles to his lips for a kiss. "You could, um— could you get my duffel for me?"
Tony loved the spa.
"Mm," Tony hummed. "That sounds great, thank you dear." Oh, but wait. Steve was at the bathroom door already, but Tony managed to sit up, water splashing up against the edges of the tub. "Oh, wait— Steve, dear, the door's locked. To my biometrics." Steve stopped in the doorway, turning back to Tony with a frankly adorable frown of confusion on his face, and— God, even now with Tony on the verge of passing out in his own filthy bathwater he looked absolutely delicious. Tony smiled, a wry quirk of a thing, and shrugged self-consciously. "You ah," he continued, clearing his throat, "you attacked Thor, darling, when he came to bring us something to eat. Very viciously, I might add, so we thought it might be best if we limited contact with anyone else for the time being."
"Oh honey, I really want you to fuck me," Tony confessed; he shut his eyes against another shudder and tilted his hips up, hoping Steve would get it. A cool rush of air slid over his damp asshole and he moaned, hips jerking at the sensitivity.
"Never let it be said I'm not prepared," Tony murmured to himself as he dug through his medicine cabinet. Would Steve potentially need an entire roll of gauze? Better throw it in the bag. Could he benefit from one of those heat patches for sore muscles? Tony threw that in the duffel, as well. Steve was still only semi-conscious when he dropped the bursting duffel bag at the foot of the bed, so he ran downstairs to grab a bunch of drinks and protein packs.
And, well—
," he whined. "Steve, Steve,
"Wh—" Tony shook his head, tried to understand what was happening. Steve's cock, though not completely soft, was still bobbing half-hard out in front of him, glistening with come, and other fluids.
"Tony—" Steve breathed.
Whatever. Steve knew that Tony was tired, and he could use a break and the chance to feel soft and pretty and not worry about the state of the world for a few hours. The problem was, Tony needing a break and Tony actually
He'd already done enough of that this week.
Steve nodded, brushing one huge, hot hand across the span of his shoulders as he reached past him to twist on the taps. "C'mon, let's get you in," he murmured, pressed his hand firm against Tony's back to brace him. When Tony slid in, his breath hitched, the weight of the plug sliding more fully, more directly against his prostate. "Want me to take it out for you?" Steve asked, innocently enough, but the half-hard cock in Tony's face said otherwise. When Tony reached for it, however, Steve snorted and shook his head, pushed Tony's hands back into the hot, soothing warmth of the tub. "I wanna focus on you for a little bit," he admitted, a bit gruffly, but his hand was still soft when it smoothed gingerly down his flank.
"Look at that pretty cock, huh?" Steve murmured, nosing behind Tony's jaw. And it
"Honey, that‒" Tony swallowed. "There is no way the dildo I used on you is going to fit into me." But oh, heat was pooling in Tony's gut, and he remembered the way Steve was gasping for it near the end, crying out and raw and sensitive from getting fucked for nearly an hour straight on the highest setting and, god, he'd been a wreck, all spit-slick and wet with come and lube and strapped down like a good little toy, begging for it. And Tony had wanted that, wanted the hard, mechanical precision, the unrelenting steady pace that only a machine can provide (and Tony did not have a

fell on you—"
"Look at you, huh?" Steve murmured, thumbs sliding slickly down the curve of Tony's backside, ass spread wide around the fat, heaving spear of Steve's dick. Steve rolled his hips, the motion made smooth through the mess of lube and come; it foamed up around Steve's cock, dripping and sloshing from Tony's soft, sloppy rim, and when Steve leaned forward to whisper in his ear, Tony shuddered, hard. "You were so tight at first, but you're pretty loose now, huh sweetheart?" Steve murmured.
Tony, Steve thought with some chagrin), the way the all-over body flush warmed his olive-toned skin to a healthy warm-brown hue. Tony responded so sweetly, alternating between clenching tight and opening up to him, the soft, persistent drag of his knuckles over Tony's insides.

"You're thinking too hard," Steve panted into his ear; Tony could feel the heat rolling off his body in waves, the first sheen of sweat clinging to his skin as he massaged and coaxed Tony's insides open. "I must not be doing my job," he teased, biting at the meat of his back, and Tony could

"Steve, Steve,
"My gorgeous guy," Steve was still murmuring, his hips rolling and out of Tony at a steady pace. His hands were cradling Tony's stomach now, the outward bulge of it made obscene by the framing of Steve's thumbs and fingertips on either side of him. "You're so full of me," he sighed, blissed, fingers caressing Tony's hips, the usually sharp vee of his pelvis made soft from the evidence of Steve's love for him, Steve's pleasure. Steve groaned, pressed his lips to the crook of Tony's shoulder. "Thank you so much for this, honey," he murmured. "I-I don't know how to tell you how beautiful you are. My beautiful boy, you're so good for me, Tony - thank you."
of the monitors in tandem. Steve slipped his finger in a little farther, testing the give, stretching his inner walls. He slicked his fingers, spread the lube in and around his hole, pressed his finger further in. Tony moaned, his ass twitching, but Steve knew how to work Tony's body, knew what buttons he could press to make it play nice.
"You know what's also going to shut down Steve's central nervous system? This goddamn drug in his bloodstream," Tony snapped, digging his thumb into his jaw in an attempt to relax the ache he was feeling from the constant teeth-grinding. Tony knew he was being snippy with everyone, but he couldn't afford to be nice right now, not with Steve's life in jeopardy. His phone buzzed on the table and Tony tapped it to accept the call. "Jill, darling, how are you, did you get the samples I sent you?" he drawled, forcing himself to relax just a hair.
because of you," Steve continued, brushing his lips to Tony's brow, pressing Tony's cheek against his shoulder. "You fucking idiot," Steve whispered, burying his face to Tony's hair. "I don't want anyone else but
—) ring of muscle and pressed the tip of the plug in it. "Like this?" Steve asked, and the bastard sounded amused, almost, even though there was no way he'd ever used a goddamned anal plug before—
Tony jerked, and whined, and honestly almost shot his load off right then and there. He sobbed, loud in the back of his throat, and grabbed at Steve with both hands and held on tight. "T-tell you what, handsome," he stuttered. "I'll come if you take a shower and l-let me check your blood." Steve's fist squeezed over the head of Tony's cock and Tony whimpered, his thighs shaking with the effort not to come straight away. If- if he could just get some calories in Steve, and a shower (God, Tony would kill for a shower right now), he could change the sheets and clean himself up and maybe- God, maybe he could even take a nap before Steve needed to fuck him again—
," Steve whispered, breath hitching, thighs trembling beneath him. "Oh, honey, I'm‒"
"I've got you," Steve whispered hotly; the plug pulled free and was tossed to the side without a care as Steve grabbed his cock and fed it into the soft, wet heat of Tony's insides. Tony choked, gasped against the feel of it, pushing his face into the pillow. Steve hummed again, moaning softly as he fucked in and out of Tony, slow, unhurried, a barely-there rocking of his hips that had his cock rubbing insistently over Tony's prostate. "I've got you, sweetheart," Steve whispered, and reached over to fondle Tony's half-hard dick.
"I'm not doing anything I don't want to do here, my love," Tony whispered gently, biting back another swell of emotion as he slicked his fingers up, slid them down to the tightly furled entrance of his body. "Now you just lie back and let me take care of you, baby, alright?"
"I was," Steve blurted, feeling his cheeks heat again. He huffed, dug his chin down into his collarbone, flexed his crossed arms. If Tony— if
"You've been so good for me, Tony," Steve murmured hotly, let his palm rub in firm, slow circles against his sack. Tony moaned and sucked his lower lip between his teeth as Steve kept at it, that soft, sensual pressure on his balls and his cock. "'Kept me from punchin' through the walls," Steve continued, jacking at his shaft, circling the head of Tony's cock, pressing his fingers into his hot, leaking slit. "'Kept me feelin' so good. I want you to feel good, too, Tony. Don't you wanna come?"
"God, his readings are off the charts," another woman murmured, grimacing at the number readouts on her screen. "Captain, I need you to take some deep breaths, okay? Your heart rate is spiking again."
"You don't mind, do you, darling?" Tony purred, and Steve could see every shiver and twitch and jerk of his body. "My jaw's still a little sore, but I— ah, I figure this wouldn't be a bad c-consolation prize?"
"What?" Tony said, dumbly.
encrypted and I can spend a fun five minutes ripping the code apart."
"I'll go with you, darling," Tony started, gathering up his dozen or so tablets and papers and stacking them in his arms. "It'll be better if I just keep an eye on you—"
Steve shook his head from side to side, biting as his lower lip and squeezing his eyes shut as he kept playing at his head, rubbing at the slick precome smearing all over his fingers, his palm massaging up and down his jerking cock.
, Tony."
Something crackled between them. "Good boy," Tony praised, and then his lips were wrapping around his swollen, aching cockhead, the pad of one beautiful finger sliding up between his cheeks. Steve choked, felt his legs splay apart even further as Tony reached back and just… rubbed at his pucker, circled it around and around oh-so-slowly, the hot sucking heat around his dick the perfect counterpoint to the dry scratch against his hole.
"We're clearing out the labs now," Tony said into the comms, ducking low as Cap's shield went wide. Three men dropped, but the fourth one's body armor miraculously held, and he swung his rifle towards Tony with a shout. Bullets dinged his chest plate and shoulders, a few ricocheting off the jaw of his helmet and into the wall behind him. "Ugh, that's going to be a bitch of a dent to bang out," he grumbled, more to himself than Cap or Wasp, then mimed cracking his knuckles at the hired gun in front of him.
Tony was so hot inside, slick and velvety smooth, and Steve couldn't resist the growl that slipped from his lips as he slid that finger deeper inside, marvelling at the way his body clung to him like a vice. Steve rubbed his finger along the inside of that wet velvety heat and Tony gasped, a tiny "
"Yeah?" Steve whispered again, his fingers finally slipping off his angry, raw-rubbed cock. He shuddered and let himself sway, almost, into Tony's arms. "Yeah," he murmured. "Yeah okay. Y' sure seem to like it when I do it to you," he finished with a giggle, goosebumps prickling all along his skin. He was sweating again. Steve must've been hitting the peak of the current up-swing. He panted raggedly against Tony's ear. "Tony, I d'n— I don' wanna
"Wh-? Cap?" Tony stood and whirled around, his jaw dropping as Steve started jogging out of the locker room. "
"Shhh," Steve whispered, nipped at the corner of Tony's jaw, right below his ear. Tony shuddered, hard. "Shh, Tony, I've gotcha honey, I've gotcha — you just lay back and let me do all the work, okay? Let me show you a good time?" He nosed behind Tony's ear, pressed hot, searing kisses to the sensitive stretch of neck, laved his tongue into the tight cord between his neck and shoulder blade. "You're not going to be able to come like this though, what with that big tube deep down inside you. You gonna be able to be hold off 'till you get out of here?" Steve slipped his hand up, back over Tony's hip and to his cock, which was surprisingly, pleasantly already stiffening up under his touch. His cock felt hot, tender almost, smooth between his fingertips; Steve brushed a finger over the head, fingered at some the lube still there, dripping from the catheter. "You gonna be my good boy?" Steve asked, and pressed down just under his slit.
Steve's cheeks were flushed a healthy pink, splotches of the hue rolling down his pert chest and nipples. "Don't I look like I like it?" he whispered back, slightly hushed. He rocked his hips against Tony's moaning softly. "Everything's so‒ so sensitive," he continued, shivering; the tip of his cock was already leaking through the thin material of his briefs. Steve slid one leg up to rub alongside Tony's freshly-waxed leg and moaned again, hips twitching. His eyes were blown, the tiniest ring of blue surrounding all that deep black. "Oh, Tony, it's perfect," he confessed in a rush.
the idea of being bare inside Tony, so shockingly intimate, in a way he rarely was, with anyone. The feel of Tony's body clinging to his fingers was a heaven in and of itself, but how much better would it feel like around his cock? With no barriers between them?
"H-honey," Tony gasped, even as he rocked back into it. Steve just hummed and spread him further, almost luxuriating in the slide of his hot, slick dick over Tony's hole as he rutted up against his ass. He moaned quietly, a satisfied sound, and then he was reaching down to slowly guide his cock back towards Tony's hole, the other hand grasping the back of one thigh and lifting him effortlessly in the air so he could let gravity do the work for them. Tony felt loose and sore and tender, and there was a moment of clarity where Tony thought
pretty, was the thing — one of the prettiest cocks Steve had ever seen, if he was being honest. Even half-hard, Tony's cock was all flushed red at the head, twitching every so often and causing Tony to shudder hard down to his toes, goosebumps lifting the hairs on his arms and legs. It looked sweet as candy, like a lollipop, like it was just begging Steve to bend down and take a bite. "Even with that big, fat tube deep down inside you, you're still so wet, baby," Steve whispered, sucking at his skin. "What are those nurses going to think when they change your bag later and see it all filled with precome, huh? They're gonna know, Tony—" Steve bit down, hard, and Tony yelped, muffled his shout by stuffing the starchy hospital blanket in his mouth.
There it was. Tony heaved a hot, shuddering breath out, buried his face in his arms as he felt that self-conscious jittering heat wash over him, felt the way his ass spasmed and clenched over Steve's thumb and tried not to groan too loudly when Steve tugged on the loose (
Tony jerked, his body singing. A hot flush crawled down his neck and chest, splotchy and far from attractive. His fingers tapped out an unsteady rhythm against the bed. "H-honey, you k-know what I like," Tony groaned, torn between grinding against Steve's mouth and rolling over to bury his face in the covers.
"Sorry about that, darling," Tony said, breezing through the door with a flourish. "I tried to get away sooner, but you know how work is sometimes."
"That's… unusual," Tony said, considering. He took a swig of his drink, washing the taste of sweet, chalky medicine from his mouth. "Did something come up?"
Steve shivered. "Yeah," he murmured. "Yess'r." It wasn't his favorite activity, taking enemas, but he knew Tony had a thing about cleanliness, and he'd asked him to clean up, so Steve had made sure he was thorough.
's spilling from his lips, and there was barely a warning tug in Tony's hair before Steve was coming in thick, hot pulses, that sweet come filling up his mouth and spilling out his lips. God, it was all he could taste, that warm musk of Steve on his tongue and in his throat, the scent of him in his nose, the feel of him underneath him. Steve was still shuddering when Tony sat up, his throat and knees a little sore, but none the worse for wear, and he looked up at Tony through lust-blown eyes before he surged forward and kissed him, licking the taste of himself from Tony's lips. "Don't leave," Steve sobbed into his mouth. "Please don't go."
"Lucky us," Tony said with a grin, crouching down to take a peek at the screen. "You think we'll get even luckier and the hard drive they're downloading to will be unencrypted? Or oooh, maybe it'll be
"Please at least take the prescription I wrote you—" Nguyen started.
"A-ah," Tony slurred, jolting under another hard thrust. His ass squelched, the barely-there suction of his rim catching at Steve's dick before releasing with a wet, lewd noise. His whole body felt soft, and full, and God, every time he so much as moved without Steve there to plug him up, he leaked
"I— I usually insist, but…" Tony bit his lip, and full-body shudder racked its way down Tony's spine, all the way to his toes. "I don't— I don't mind if you don't," he whispered, almost shyly, his eyes fluttering down and off to the side. "It's your show here, cowboy."

," Jill replied gently. Across the table, Jan was still scrolling through the readouts, her jaw clenched tight and a furrow in her brow. "
"I know you're scared, Tony," Steve murmured gently, and had to take a moment to stifle the burning sensation behind his eyes. Hell, of course he was scared — Steve was
!" Steve snarled, grabbing a fistful of Tony's hair and jerking his head back so he could take a look at Tony. His eyes were red and watery, but it didn't look like he'd burst into pitiful tears like Tony had, so that was something. Steve's jaw clenched, his teeth grinding together, and he let Tony's hair go so he could run his fingers through it. "This has been an awful week," Steve admitted, and

Tony looked at the fucking pillow and almost lost his mind. "You got me a‒" Tony couldn't hold back his snort and started giggling like a madman. "It's red, white, and
," Steve shouted, his fist flying out and into the wall. Plaster cracked and snapped under the pressure from his knuckles, and fresh blood welled up, thick and oozing through the bandages on his hands. Steve hit the wall again, punching straight through another layer of plaster, and Tony nearly dropped everything he was carrying in his rush to get over to him.
, with Tony's body soft and open and yielding beneath him just made Tony feel so proud and accomplished that
Honestly? That pissed Steve off more than anything.
"Steve," Tony said again, and Steve finally turned back to look at Tony, his feet stomping to either side of the treadmill. The sound of it was agony to his migraine. Steve's fingers tightened around his wrist, and Tony imagined he could hear his bones creaking. "Steve, I would like for you to let go of me now," Tony said, very slowly, pulling back on his hand.
"Okay, gorgeous," Tony murmured, hot against his ass. Steve could barely hear him over the roar in his eyes. "Okay Steve — go ahead and come when you're ready."
falling from his lips.
"Don't you worry, sweetheart, we'll make it stop," Tony promised, and waited for the calvary to arrive.
"You're a fucking dipshit," Steve grumbled, spooning up behind him and wrapping his arms loosely around Tony's middle. "I want to sleep, Stark. My dick'll still be hard in an hour."
me, Tony."
Tony shuddered. "Come now, darling— all this time we've spent together and you haven't figured out I like it when you rough me up?" he rasped, shivering under Steve's attentions. His mind was— was starting to feel soupy again, soft and unfocused and completely the opposite of what he needed right now.
"I got you, I got you baby," Steve told him, pressing deep down at the base of his cock. "You wanna come now or later? Or do you want me to decide?"
it was too much - it was exactly what he wanted. "S'okay," Tony slurred, shaking his head, his temple pressed to Steve's cheek. "I's'so
"N-no," Steve gritted out, his fingers tapping a steady rhythm across his biceps. "No more sedatives."
"You're hard," Steve said, slowly, like he was still piecing it together, but it still sent a rush of heat to Tony's face and neck, intense enough he was sure Steve could see it. "For— for me. For me?" Steve sighed, his pretty golden lashes fluttering, and began to rub the heel of his hand against Tony through his slacks. Tony did moan this time, loud through his teeth and the hands he'd covered his face with.
"I need to go for a run," Steve blurted. Tony and Jan whipped around to where Steve was sitting on the exam table, practically vibrating under his skin. Steve looked at the doctor monitoring his vitals. "Ma'am, can I go for a run?"

"—rvis, thank you. And could you be a dear and bring me my pills?" Tony asked, and there was a soft, soothing touch in his hair. Oh, Tony was petting him. Normally, Steve would be irritated, would be throwing a fit over the intimacy, the— the

someone for two days straight, super soldier serum or not.
"Not great," Tony admitted, avoiding Thor's eyes as he grabbed another cooler to fill with food. "He's… he's kind of in and out of it. We're trying to wear him out, see if that'll help his body metabolize the drug faster." Gosh, when Tony said it like it, he sounded almost noble about the whole thing. Don't worry Steve! All this sex you don't have the mental capacity or choice to consent to is just so you don't die! That makes it all better, right? Tony's lip curled in disgust as he stared down at the cooler of snacks.
Tony sobbed, fingers flexing in the sheets, his biceps straining as he trembled under both Steve and the machine's touch. He dropped, the chain jangling, his nipples burning and throbbing, and whined and writhed despite himself. Steve whispered nonsense endearments, pressing kisses along his back, his hair, even as he slid a finger around the rim of his asshole. He rubbed at it, softly but firmly, edging the tip of his finger just inside him so he could fuck at Tony along with the dildo.
"I got you, sunshine," a warm, rough voice murmured, and then there was a hot, calloused hand on his cock. Steve thought he might've actually wept. He shuddered, dropped his head on Tony's shoulder.
He found Jarvis in the study.
"Not yet, darling," Tony grunted, gauntlet curling and slamming into the goon's helmet. It crunched under his fist, but must not have been enough to take him out because another spray of bullets dented his armor. "It's cute that you think that's going to work," he laughed, punching at him twice more. Then, to Wasp: "The first few computers we scanned had already been wiped, but this lab looks promising. With any luck we should be able to find out what they've been working on and put an end to their nefarious plans, with the added benefit of crushing this lovely base to dust."
Steve licked his lips again. "And if I cuffed you in," he murmured, "made you take a nice, long fuck with that dildo‒"
It should've been a simple mission.
about it, hadn't salivated after the man or come onto him or made Steve feel like he wasn't
"Of course," Steve murmured, cutting off that train of thought. He slid his hands up and down Tony's thighs, callouses catching roughly on his stockings, and it sent a rush of heat to Tony's gut.

Tony was going to die, surely. Sweat beaded on his skin, trapped between his own outfit and Steve's, the sound of fabric rustling and skin slapping loud in the room and suddenly Steve was pressed chest to Tony's back, the bone of the bustier digging into Tony's spine as Steve reached around and jerked at his cock, circling and teasing and pulling just the way he needed to be able to get off.
"Stark?" Steve called out, pressing a hand to the doorframe. Tony's room had a handprint scanner as opposed to the old-fashioned lock and key he'd given Steve's, but the light flashed green when he touched it, so he couldn't have locked Steve out. "Tony, are you in here?" he called again, popping his head in the door. Steve frowned, pulling out his phone and swiping through to call Tony.
"That feel good, tiger?" Tony murmured, sliding them deeper and deeper in. He crooked them up, rubbing insistently, and felt Steve jerk all around him.
of such an act (by Tony Stark, no less), but right now it felt like everything Steve wanted, and he couldn't help the low rumble that rose up in the back of his throat. "Oh, he's up," Tony murmured with obvious cheer in his voice; he scratched his fingers at the nape of Steve's neck, and Steve moaned, almost embarrassing in its intensity, but mostly all Steve could focus on was how
Tony was shaking his head now, his skin grey, his face screwed up in misery. "Steve, I

," Steve moaned. "Oh‒ oh honey‒
. Before he could stop himself, he jerked his wrists tight against the cuffs, sobbing down into the cushion. His nipples reminded him, once more, how sensitive and raw they felt, and Tony jerked again.
Steve's cock felt in his throat, filling him up and pervading his senses with the musky-sweet scent of him. Sweat poured over Steve, dripping from his abs and pelvis to the sides of his face, from his balls to Tony's neck and chest. His thighs, thick and hard and
. He whimpered, his chest heaving, and dug his nails into his palms, buried his face into Tony's neck. "Tony—" he gasped out. "
So it was with full knowledge of the brevity of his actions that Steve Rogers did to Tony Stark that he did best:
big, but he sure felt like it, filled practically to bursting, like if he opened his mouth, all the come and lube would come spilling out of him.
Steve came, felt the heat of it splashing up against his insides, his mouth sucking hot purple bruises to the base of his neck. "Y'gotta soften up, sweetheart," Steve rasped, tongue dragging down the prickling, sensitive skin. "You need to relax your stomach muscles a little so we can fit some more into that tight little body of yours, hmm?" His fingers slid up, rubbing slow, small circles over the round of his belly, the underside of his softened abdomen.
in his ear, gently coaxing his dick harder and harder till Tony thought he might actually start crying.
"Have you been keeping track like I asked?" Steve asked, nosing the edge of Tony's beard. "Do you need a break or anything? Water?"
"You don't have to do that," Steve said, shaking droplet-covered bangs out of his eyes with a wry, quirking grin. "My uniform works just fine as it is, Stark."
‒" Tony sobbed again and ground down on Steve's fingers, and Steve rewarded him by slipping in another finger, soft and slick and rubbing against his insides like he was made to be there. He rubbed his face back and forth against the sheets. Tony moaned, hands fisting into the covers, and Steve's fingers spread inside him, spreading him wet and slick and open and
"Lies and falsehood," Tony snarked, letting himself be manhandled into the position of little spoon in front of Steve. "I think just the right amount."
Steve fucked him hard that time, fast enough that Tony was jolted forward onto the bed with each thrust, that Tony could barely think to remember his own name, let alone clench up and make it harder on himself. When he came, Tony was still soft underneath him, his belly lax as Steve pumped him full of more of his come. "How many's'that?" Steve asked, biting gently at the shell of Tony's ear.
Steve nodded, and curled his fingers around Tony's cock, urging Tony to do the same. "Good," he whispered, shutting his eyes when Tony squeezed his dick just right. He let himself stroke Steve just like that, soft and loving and gentle (all the ways Steve probably never allowed himself to be touched), just coaxing the pleasure out of him millimeter by millimeter. Tony was starting to learn his preferences now, what really revved him up, like rubbing softly against the head of his cock, into the hot weeping slit. Steve really seemed to like a sharp bite with his pleasure; he hadn't quite found his limit yet, but Tony was hesitant to really experiment with some of the kinkier stuff with Steve so in and out of it. Who was to say pain was something Steve actually liked, or if it was just a side effect of the drug?
— "Am I hurting you?" Steve asked, pressing both palms to Tony's cheeks, his thumbs rubbing soft circles against his temples. His hair was a mess and his eyes were red, and his skin had taken on that sweaty, ghost-like pallor that let Tony know he was in the middle of another rough wave of the stuff, but all he kept asking was—
"Water and ration bars after decontamination," Steve quoted at him, and Tony made a face at the man. Steve's eyes slid down and to the right, then he rolled his eyes and sighed. "But chocolate is also good for making up those calories."
He smiled lazily, turning over to blink at Tony, all soft and sleepy-eyed. "Hi," Steve said, flashing teeth. "How 'you holdin' up?"
Steve's hand tightened on his wrist, then loosened forcibly, and he stumbled off the side of the treadmill, collapsing and panting into the tile floor. "Tony," he whispered, wrapping his arms around his middle and gritting his teeth. "M'not— I. I don't feel good."
, everywhere, all over the place. Tony was sure he smelled awful. His phone chimed on the bedside table, and then a knock sounded at the door. Steve growled, low in his throat, and wrapped his arms tighter around Tony's middle, the sounds of their sex filling the air in wet, squelching staccato. "S-Steve," Tony moaned, reaching back to smack at Steve's shoulder. "Steve, c'mon, we need to check your blood."
you, I should've found someone you actually wanted—"
, Steve thought desperately. Before he could voice it, the
Soft kitten licks drifted across his skin and Tony swore. "Oh, you're gonna kill me Winghead," Tony laughed against a moan, hands trembling as he gently finger-combed through Steve's sweat-soaked locks.
Steve huffed out a laugh. "Right, right," he grumbled and smacked one final kiss to Tony's lips. Tony laughed, pushing at his chest and twirling on his toes.
deserved.
Steve took a second to tuck that little nugget of suggestion back for future use. "Well," he said then, mouthing lightly down the side of Tony's throat. Tony's breathing hitched lightly. "Remember that package I ordered awhile back? It came in. Everything's been fitted and dry cleaned." Tony was very, very still in front of him. Steve smiled;
"Glad to be... of service," Tony mumbled, fighting back a yawn. "'Love you, honey." Steve's breath hitched beside him, fingers tightening around Tony's middle. They needed to get up and clean themselves up before they got all tacky and disgusting, before Tony leaked all the come out of his ass onto the bed, but first‒
Tony shuddered against Steve's skin, dangerously close to losing his shit again. He reached out, tightened his fingers into the meat of Steve's shoulder blades, and just… took a second, to gasp wetly against Steve's shoulder. "If— if you really m-mean that," Tony rasped, "tell me again when you're in the clear."
"It's—" Tony's voice broke, and he shivered, shuddering as Steve thrust one last time in his oversensitive body before slowly pulling out, his cock leaving Tony's ass in one slow, sucking
"I'm going to give you another finger, Tony," Steve murmured against the back of his neck, and Tony jerked and whined in his arms, trying to spread his legs even farther apart, trying to accommodate all of Steve as he pressed his pinky into Tony's ass. "Gotta make sure you're nice and open for me, Shellhead," Steve whispered, a low rumble deep in his throat. Sweat was dripping down Tony's hair, his nose, pooling at the base of his spine. Steve had to be in similar shape ‒ he always got so worked up when he was working Tony open, called it a damn
"It didn't really do much the first time," Jan sighed. "What about dialysis? Give his kidneys an extra boost to help flush out the toxins."
Silence, and then Tony could hear harsh, heavy panting behind the door. There was another noise from Steve, like he was in
the smirk on his face, but holy-fucking-shit, Steve's fingers were doing amazing things to his ass right now. "There we go," Steve murmured, scissoring his fingers apart as he curled them back against, rubbing against his prostate slow and steady, like an itch that needed to be scratched. "How's that feelin', honey? You feel just about ready for the cuffs."
Tony's face transformed then, the bright blue of his eyes taking on a new light as he beamed up at Steve. He stretched up, cupping Steve's face between his hands so he could give him a warm, open kiss. "Darling," Tony sighed, nosing across Steve's cheek. "There is
"Yeah, fella, I got you," Steve murmured, gently petting the side of Tony's face. He got up from the bed and was back almost immediately, a pair of their smaller, daintier clamps dangling from his fingertips. "Gonna clamp your sweet little nipples now," Steve told him as he scooted back to Tony's side. "They're gonna rub themselves all raw and red with the cushion here, so you tell me if you need to break at all, okay Shellhead?"
"Hey there, sweetheart," Steve murmured, brushing a lock of hair from his face. "That looked intense."
"Hey, hey, hey, it's okay," Tony soothed, running his hand through Steve's hair. "You've got a little bit of super strength there, tiger. You just fucked my face for a good long while, yeah? Poor thing was bound to bruise sooner or later." He leaned over, pressing a soft kiss to the top of Steve's hair. "You stopped when I started getting sore."
. Tony resisted the urge to pinch himself and instead leaned forward, rearranging them so that Steve was braced against the bed and tugging his wet, come-stained pants off. Steve's cock was still hard, and gloriously uncut, flushed with blood and nearly purple at the head, drenched in his own come from his navel down to his balls. As Tony stared (drank him in, really), Steve's cock gave an interested twitch, and he rolled his head to the side, hiding his face in his arm.
"Oh God," Tony gasped, and he was certainly drooling now. He grit his teeth and moaned, tried to suck the spit back in through his teeth, but he could feel his beard, his chin all wet with it anyway. "S-shower and a blood test," Tony said, though he wasn't sure he'd be able to make it to the door to get the modified glucose meter Jan had rigged up for them. If he were being honest with himself, a nap sounded like a hell of a good idea at the moment.
Tony swore, burying his face in the covers, lifting his ass and spreading his legs and making sure to stay relaxed while Steve fucked ever so gently in, the trembling of his thighs betraying just how tightly Steve was controlling himself. Tony's breath hitched and he rolled his hips back, the sharp pinch of pain worth it for the way Steve's hips stuttered and he moaned over and over into Tony's hair, fingers spasming against the lace and silk.
. "Steve," Tony gasped. "
"Now, now, darling, that was just the warm-up. You're not done already, are you?" Tony purred, brushing the back of his hand to Steve's cheek. Steve could smell himself, the evidence of his own wet neediness on Tony's hand, and his cock jerked again, another stream of precome trickling from the tip.
"Now, you don't have to say yes," Steve started slowly, but his eyes were blown black, and he was chewing on his lip a little, and Tony felt the scientist in him perk up, that little nugget of curiosity that said
"I don't have to say yes…" Tony prompted, and he even felt a little clearer than he had not thirty seconds ago, his mind buzzing with the possibilities ‒ the

just a warm body for me to fuck into," Steve snapped, dragging Tony's gaze back up from the tiled floor. He tightened his fingers briefly, gave him the tiniest of shakes. "I wanted
"I'm gonna take the clamps off now," Steve told him, and Tony blinked up at Steve, slow and soft. Steve beamed, petting the side of Tony's face. "Ready?" he asked; Tony nodded, and Steve reached up and slowly pinched the handle of the first clamp.
shaking. "No, no—I, it's—ah, it's good," Tony murmured, his voice catching, letting his legs slowly relax back down to the bed. "I'm infuriatingly sensitive," he whispered then, like it was shameful, his face a beautiful shade of plum and cream and coffee, his lips pulled into a frown behind his beard and mustache. "But I— ah, it didn't hurt. I liked it. Maybe too much," he admitted, ducking his face into his shoulder.
"Like hell," Steve grunted, deciding to give a little back to Tony and grazing his own teeth along the sensitive skin of Tony's throat; Tony shivered.
"So‒" Tony hiccuped, "
, Tony was not going to wait outside for permission while Steve was in the middle of a goddamn medical emergency.
"F-for you," Tony stuttered, keening, throwing his head back against the sheets. "All for you, h-honey."
noises loud in the back of his throat as he let Steve pull his face onto his cock, his ass back on the dildo, and Tony started rocking with it ever so gently, his hips bucking and nipples scraping and throat gagging around the monster of a cock Steve kept slamming into him.
"Why would you even
All the air seemed to leave the room. Steve would've sworn he was alone if not for the warm, comforting presence of Tony pressed up against him. But Tony didn't move, seemed to be made from stone; Steve couldn't even feel him
"Nuh-uh," Steve sang; his tongue danced around the rim of his asshole before very delicately probing inside, once, twice. "I know how you are, Shellhead," he continued affectionately, pressing a wet and messy kiss to the back of Tony's thigh; Tony felt his face flush even hotter. "Your comfort levels change on a day to day basis, and I want to make sure‒" Steve bit down lightly where Tony's ass met his thigh, "‒that nothing happens that you are not one-hundred-percent on board with." Steve moved back to suck and slurp at his ass and, oh god, Steve was touching him so
Steve hummed in consideration. If they were going to be here for awhile (God, how long had they been here already? Hours? A day? More than that?) it would be best for Tony if they used condoms (even… even if forgoing them meant it left him wet, and sloppy, and
?" Steve swore, snatched his hand away, but Tony was quicker, grabbing Steve's fingers and sliding his hand back to Tony's cock, still not hard but getting harder under his touch.
one. Tony could see Steve's cock jerk in his sweatpants, could practically see the precome dripping from his tip and wetting the soft cotton even further.
"Let me‒" Tony gasped, hands fumbling for Steve's belt, "Oh sugar, let me take that edge off for you."
Steve waited.
, Tony thought suddenly, and his chest clenched, his eyes watering again, but he just sniffled and shook his head, bending forward to lave at the sweat pooling in his collarbone. If this— if this was all Tony was ever going to have, he was going to just— just have to savor it, and enjoy it as long as he could, as sick as it sounded. And maybe— maybe when it was all over Steve wouldn't hate him—
. "Tony, you're bruised to hell a-and you have
Tony knew he should insert some witty quip here, but it was all he could do to just bend down and pick up the gauze from the floor, lob it in the garbage and go grab another one. Don't think about Cap's dick, Tony told himself feverishly. Don't think about it.
. This— they hadn't talked about something like this happening. Should Steve get up? Was he supposed to be doing something different? Steve felt his mind waking up, trying to push itself up out of the sluggish haze he'd somehow fallen into without his noticing. He needed to— Surely, he'd done something
Steve hummed consideringly. "Nah," he replied in a hot whisper, "Nah, you might like a bit—" Steve slid his hand back and slammed it forward into the fleshy part of Tony's ass; Tony gasped, choked on a hot, heady moan, "—a bit of a sting, but you like it when I'm soft with you, don't ya Stark?" Steve murmured, his huge palm cupping and rubbing at the throbbing bruise blooming under his skin. "You want me to treat you gently."
"Pot, kettle," Tony shot back with another wobbly smile. "I- I try my best, honey, and maybe I did get hurt today, but I also saved a bunch of people, and that's always gonna be a win in my books."
Tony would make it all better—
"Like I said," Steve rumbled, "you don't have to say yes‒" Who the fuck was Steve kidding? Of
"Darling," Tony murmured, moving forward to capture Steve's lips with his own, "I may need you to pinch me, because I'm certain that this was all for me.
"You need this," Steve said simply, turning Tony's face back towards him so they could share a sweet, simple kiss. "You like it when I'm soft with you," he continued, heedless of the way Tony's cheeks were blushing red again. "You
Steve flinched, and cleared his throat roughly, dropping his eyes down to the floor. "No, thank you, ma'am. 'M- I'd rather just run." He was out the door before Tony could say boo, the door slamming shut behind him, and both women in the room shot Tony a sympathetic look.
"Thor, get
It wasn't like Steve was worried. Steve knew if something were truly wrong with Tony that Jarvis or one of the others would tell him. They wouldn't keep Tony's health from him or anything like that. But…
"—eep yourself hydrated," his idiot doctor continued. "Make sure you keep monitoring your vitals and come see me or Dr. Nguyen immediately if you feel like you're getting worse—"
"There's water on the jet," Steve said, clapping him on the shoulder as he walked by. And while apparently Steve was perfectly content with getting his feet all dirty, Tony was not.
"Don't forget to drink some of the lemon water before you head out. Hydration is very important," Terrance continued with a sly grin, patting a towel to the soles of Steve's feet. "Would you like any help getting dressed, Mr. Rogers?"
"Oh, sweetheart, don't you worry," Steve soothed, dragged his fingers through the foaming mess of come on his dick, around Tony's hole. "Don't you worry one bit, I am going to make you so full-" Steve massaged the base of his cock, where he was splitting Tony in two, around the soft, sensitive rim of him.
Tony moaned, felt Steve's cock rocket against his prostate, reawakening sensitized nerves that Tony'd been ignoring so long. "Shh, shh, sorry, I know," Steve whispered, skating a hand across Tony's stomach, "I've been trying to avoid it, I didn't mean t'make it harder on ya."
Steve looked down at his knuckles, at the purple, jagged skin and blew out a long breath. "Yeah, I—" He shook his head. "Mm. I forgot. Sorry."
And he
"I'm fine," Tony gasped out; he wrenched his arm back so Steve could see the red in his face, how blown his pupils were. He took in another deep, stuttering breath. "I d-don't think I can handle you‒ there," he finished lamely, grimacing. It was fairly tight on the best of days, and considering how hard of a time he had even taking Steve anally, having sex… the other way left Tony usually feeling a messy mix of emotions he didn't like to mix with how he felt about Steve. "Fingers and mouth are fine," he continued eventually, grimacing at himself. Of all the things to
Tony shivered, felt his skin prickle with goosebumps again, even as Steve pressed his hot hands to Tony's chest. "Darling," he whispered, swayed a little on his feet.
Steve shuddered; he didn't think he'd be able to say it out loud, but— but maybe if he showed him, Tony would understand anyway. He grabbed the bottle of lubricant again, squeezed a liberal amount onto his palm, slicked the cool gel across his aching, burning cock. Steve gasped, and he thought he might have heard Tony gasp with him. When he leaned forward, looming over Tony, one hand on the bed and the other on his dick, he had to hold back a whimper, had to bite back the urge to just shove his dick into Tony and go to fucking town. "D-don't," he panted, loud in the empty room around them. "Don't let me hurt you."
Tony shivered, glad for once of the suit's ability to mask some of his more… involuntary motions, and nodded, turning towards Steve and lifting up his arms obligingly. The gauntlets came off easy enough, but the rerebraces and shoulders had discreet catches that needed to be manipulated a certain way (usually it was machine or tech-aided, but well, emergencies were emergencies) to come off. It was the same with the legs and the center chest piece, but once all those large sections were off, the rest of the armor fell off without much work. "Guess it's time for shower number two," Tony said lightly, his eyes firmly on the armor pieces on the floor as he toed out of his own panties, flinging them off and into the pile.
The dildo breached him, free of any human intervention, and Tony wasn't sure who moaned louder: him or Steve. It rocked in, rocked back out, so slow and gentle it had to be on the lowest setting. Tony panted and tried not to squirm, arching his ass back and his chest down and he moaned aloud sharply as the edges of the nipple clamps scuffed the cushion.
Steve was furious.
"I've got them, Jill. Here, Jan, take a look at this," Tony said, sliding a tablet over to her side of the desk. "So this is like, what, some kind of souped up version of ecstasy? Cocaine? Cap can metabolize that in minutes."
"Good," Steve praised, pressing another kiss to Tony's face. Tony sighed, leaned into Steve again, and Steve beamed, brushed a thick curl out of Tony's face. "So what we're going to do is brush your teeth and wash your face and then we're going to lay in bed so I can kiss you proper, alright?"
It was tight, and verging on the edge of too dry, but Steve was bouncing on his dick like a goddamn champion, and when Tony slipped lube-slick fingers up to the crack of his ass, he paused long enough for Tony to feed it into him and all around his cock to soothe the burn Steve had to be feeling inside of him. On the next slide, Steve sighed, his head tipping back to show off the long line of his throat, and Tony had to reach out and just— grab onto him, his thumbs fitting into the notches of Steve's hip bones, fingertips curling around his heated skin. Steve groaned, rolling his hips in sharp, rapid snaps; when he came there was a mix of pleasure and pain on his face, and all Tony wanted to do was reach up and smooth the tension from his face, to hold Steve's face in his hands and press soft, loving kisses to his lips and make love to him the way Steve
"Oh." Now Tony was the one flushing. "You don't have to do this—"
Tony was at Steve's side before he knew it, his hands hovering scant centimeters above the skin, and he- he didn't know what to
"O-oh that's fine, honey," Tony whispered; Steve could see him starting to get a slightly-glazed look about him, his cheeks a little flushed, breath coming a little quicker. When Steve spread a bit of lube around the sweet tender head of him, bare of any foreskin, Tony shivered and his cock swelled a little, stiffening up nice under his fingertips. "R-really, it's fine," Tony insisted. His uninjured hand darted out to curl around the groin of Steve's pants, and Steve realized with a startling shock of pleasure that he was
"What a good boy," Steve murmured, speeding up his strokes. Tony could hear the wet, slapping sound of Steve jerking him off, loud and booming in his ears, and couldn't help the sharp breath he let out, turned his head to one side to hide the heating of his cheeks again in Steve's warm skin. "You're so good, Tony," Steve continued, unaware or perhaps unheeding of Tony's hot embarrassment. "Look at you, baby. Gave me one of the sweetest french baths I've ever had and then let me throw you around like a caveman."
-" It felt so intimate, the weight of Steve's pleasure heavy inside of him, spilling out of him and frothing over his groin and thighs, and if Tony kept it in long enough, it'd become a part of him. Maybe Tony would- would gain weight, look like he was pregnant with it, the way his stomach was ballooned outward.
that, however, didn't make Steve any less pissed, didn't make Steve want to go punch a hole through the wall any less. "Why are you so determined to believe that I don't want to be here, huh fella?" Steve asked gruffly, threading his fingers through the thick of Tony's curls.
; Steve hadn't turned the machine off, so Tony was just going to lie there and take it and whine and mewl and let the fucking machine fuck him 'till Steve had his fill.
on you," he said. "I basically
Steve frowned. "Do you want me to wear one?" That was why he'd asked, right? Did Tony prefer less of a mess? Was that why he was bringing it up?
"That was so nice," Steve murmured a few minutes later, once he got his breath back. "You enjoy yourself?" he asked lowly, nuzzling softly against Tony's cheek.
Tony thought desperately.
, he thought.
"Yeah?" Steve asked.
Steve snorted, ran his fingers through Tony's hair once again. Tony's eyes fluttered shut at the soothing motion. "Now I know you're tellin' tales, mister," Steve teased gently, digging his fingers into Tony's scalp and scratching. "But I can see someone here is still pretty needy." Tony flushed, deeply, even as he felt his cock jerk and slap wetly against Steve's leg. Steve's hands slid down, the both of them, settled right above his waist, and Tony felt a zing of hot humiliation at how Steve's huge and beautiful hands almost encircled him completely. Steve lifted him, and the feeling prickled even sharper at how easily Steve could move him, how hot and—and—and embarrassing it was, that Steve could just pick him up and throw him on his lap like a child, how he could situate Tony exactly how he wanted and all Tony could do was sit there and
"Steve," Tony croaked, his voice still rough from sleep. He sat up, a bit shakily, and reached out to lay a hand on Steve's arm. "Steve, hey - honey, c'mere." Steve sobbed, then shook his head, pressed his face hard into the mattress to hide his panting. Tony made a soft shushing noise and tugged on Steve's arm, tried to get him to roll over. "Steve," Tony said again, "darling, roll over, let me help you."
"That's not what this is," Steve said, a bit harshly, squeezing the back of Tony's neck. Tony sniffed again, wrapping his arms more firmly around the toilet, and closed his eyes. "Hey, I'm being serious," Steve continued, trying to tamp back his temper before he went and made a mess of things. He ground his teeth together. "What, Tony Stark can be there for Steve Rogers, but no one can be there for Tony Stark, is that right?"
"Look at you," Tony murmured, biting down on his jaw bone. "You're so needy, Steve. I'm barely touching you and you're still about to come all over yourself." He tutted at Steve, rubbing himself bodily against Steve like a cat. "Come on, now, I think you can hold off, can't you, champ? Put your hand back on your sweet, drooling cock, handsome."
Tony smiled weakly at him, and the sight of it warping Tony's face into something… so
," he replied, flushing cherry red again.
"I'll have you know those dates are sometimes the highlight of my day," Tony sniffed, grabbing some of the industrial grade soap and scrub brushes from the shelf across from him. Beside him, Cap grunted again, pulling a shard of glass out of his half-healed skin and Tony cursed. "Oh, hell, Cap, let me do that."
," Wasp said next. Hawkeye was, predictably as ever, silent. "
And that was the fucking kicker wasn't it? Tony shook his head, over and over, tried to reach down and wrap his fingers around Steve's dick, but it was soft, just lying there limply against his thigh and that just sent another rush of humiliation through Tony, another wave of tears to his eyes.
"That good for you, soldier?" Tony asked roughly, pressing a wet, messy kiss to the tip, fingers massaging lightly at his balls. God, Tony's cock was aching, straining against the soft fabric of his slacks. He felt like he'd been hard for so long, his head was swimming with it, the need to just press his cock up against Steve's abs and rut until he came. Tony bit his lip and moaned, pressed his hand to the base of himself to stave off the worst of it. This wasn't about him; it was about Steve, and what he needed.
Like that was supposed to make Steve feel
with you, Tony," he finished gruffly, pressing another kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth, "for as long as you'll have me."
"They're gonna how much you needed me, Tony," Steve whispered hotly, reaching around to gently grasp Tony's semi-flaccid cock. Tony moaned, his good leg bouncing; Steve could see his face had gone all hot, flushed down to his neck and shoulders. He grinned, gave Tony's pretty little cock a soft, even squeeze. "Don't come, baby," Steve reminded him with a soft kiss to the back of his neck.
"What a looker," Steve murmured, almost awe-struck, curling his big, warm hands to Tony's jaw. "S'that pretty pink all for me?" Tony gave another soft, choked-off moan, breathy despite the way Steve's cock filled his throat, and couldn't help the way his skin colored and darkened under the scrutiny of one Steve Rogers. "Should I get you a gag to match that plug a' yours?" Steve asked, clearly delighted at the thought, and Tony felt his neck heat, whined as Steve pulled him further forward on his cock. "Or maybe— maybe you'd like a little piece of leather—" Steve's fingers trailed down, grazing the edge of the flush on his throat, right above his collarbone, "—maybe you'd like something with the name 'Steve Rogers' on it, instead of the American flag?" Steve asked in a hush, his own cheeks suddenly swirling with a pink of their own, something soft and self-conscious in his face, his gaze firmly locked on that section of skin on Tony's neck.
"Just like that,
"Honey please," Tony groaned, vibrating under his touch. "Steve— Steve, please, I want to feel it honey, give it to me good slugger, I wanna feel it later when you're gone—"
His throat ached again and Tony choked back his sob, turned his ministrations gentle and constant against Steve's prostate. He was close now, Tony could tell — from the tightening of his brows to the trembling in his legs, to the sweet rosy flush down his face and chest. God, he was beautiful. And, well… if this was going to be his last chance… "You're so beautiful," Tony whispered, and Steve's eyes snapped open as he came, spilling hot and heavy between them.
Steve blinked a few times, tried to keep back the wet heat piling up behind his eyelids. "You're sure?" he asked roughly. "I didn't— didn't hurt you too bad? Tony, I-I-I
, letting his jaw drop and his throat soften as the fat head of Steve's cock slip past his lips and onto his tongue. Steve moaned, the sound of it wrenched from deep in his chest, and Tony moaned back, tongue catching at the precome as Steve began to rock his hips back and forth.
," Steve moaned, like he'd just gone one-vee-one with a tank, and Tony could hear the sharp rip of fabric beneath them, Steve's forearms trembling, his biceps bulging. "Tony, I- oh
"H‒hah," Tony panted, legs trembling. He felt ready; god, he felt open and gaping already, and Steve had barely put two fingers in him (never mind that Steve's fingers were huge on his own, but Tony had to take the dildo soon, and then Steve's

him like that. "I, I know things are a little awkward with Jan right now," Tony whispered, "and you don't really know Wanda all that well, but, but there's no one on this team who wouldn't help you, alright? Not a single one of us." Tony licked his lips, felt his certainty waver, his throat tighten. "I can, I can go call Jan up and we can set you both up with an economy-sized bottle of lube and some condoms, and just- just let you two have a good time—"
"Get out," he hissed, and he could barely recognize his own voice, but he strode forward and grabbed him (

. His cock pulsed, come spilling out, striping his dick and his stomach and, Christ, possibly even his face, he couldn't tell. Tony was still sucking at his ass, moaning and grinding down into the bed like it was the best thing he'd ever put his mouth on, his hands flexing on Steve's thighs like he couldn't quite keep himself still. There were tears pricking at his eyes, and Steve couldn't stop panting, couldn't stop whimpering as his cock continued to empty itself all over his belly. His dick felt just the wrong side of too-sensitive, and Steve couldn't help jerking himself that little bit harder, trying to wring the last vestiges of pleasure out his tingling, spasming body.
"O-oh, honey, you don't have to," Tony breathed out in a rush, the lax ring of muscle spasming around Steve's finger. Tony bit his lip, blinked furiously up at the ceiling as the tip of the plug pressed against him, cool and slick with lube. "I-I mean it, I'm fine you don't have to-"
Tony hummed, pressing a sweet kiss to Steve's lips. "We fucked for eight days, handsome — the anal tissues are very fragile, and anyone would have torn after a session that intense."
Steve hummed, and it was a low sound, something dark and proprietary that left Tony trembling for an altogether different reason. He rolled Tony over onto his front, brushed soft, sensuous kisses down the length of his spine. When he grabbed hold of one of Tony's cheeks so he could spread him wide, Tony whined, tried not to roll his hips into the mess of come on the sheets and his stomach. "Such a pretty hole," Steve murmured, thumbing at it and— and Tony could tell that he was watching the mess of come drip out of him. Tony shuddered, all the way down to his toes. "S' gonna look even prettier with my shield in it," Steve whispered hotly.
"Mm," Steve said, but Tony couldn't quite tell if he was agreeing or not, staring-but-not-quite seeing down at Tony's hands as he dabbed ointment onto Steve's knuckles and wrapped him up in a swath of bandages. "I'm… I gotta go for a run," he said, standing up and shoving Tony to the side.
. Tony whimpered again, shifted a little on his hip, and Steve scratched at the base of his skull, hard enough that it felt absolutely divine to Tony's sore, migraine-infused body. Another cramp hit Tony and he groaned, ground his teeth through it, pushing his head more firmly into Steve's grip. Steve hummed, massaged at the tight muscles in Tony's neck, the base of his skull, tried to work out the knots of tension that seemed to be constantly worming their way in his spine.

"What's your color, Tony?" Steve prompted. "Any pain? Too much yet?"
"You don't need to do that, Stark, I heal up quick," Steve murmured, jerking his hands out of Tony's grip.

"You're mine," Steve rasped into his ear, and Tony felt the first splash of hot come inside him. "-And I'm yours." Tony whined, but Steve just kept up the same hard, steady pace; Steve rarely went soft if he was still inside Tony (a fact that never failed to flatter him), would probably go for hours if Tony's body could let him, so him being able to come inside Tony and

you to," Steve growled, dragging his fist agonizingly slow up and down Tony's cock. "I want you to come, Tony."
Steve was breathing heavily now, barely a hint of blue left in his eyes. Tony felt his cock throb, and he had to moan at Steve's words, pressing the heel of his hand to his dick, still trapped in his slacks.
Steve hummed, but it sounded almost amused, and he didn't chastise Tony for his chatter, so he couldn't be too terribly upset with him. Steve loosened the buckle at his jaw, tugging off his helmet so he could yank a dart out of his skin. "You'd think they wouldn't have left in the middle of this—" he started to say, but then his jaw tightened and he whirled around, fist swinging, just in time to get an Erlenmeyer flask to the face. There was glass in skin and blood pouring down his face, but Steve just bared his teeth at the spitting Russian, slamming his fist straight into the guy's plastic safety glasses.
Maybe a few rounds with the heavy bag would help calm him down.
"Hell," Steve swore, rubbing a bit more firmly on Tony's back. Tony sniffed, and wiped his face off on the cuff of his sleeve, and finally let his eyes flutter shut, a soft sound escaping his lips.
Steve beamed. "You think you can get up, or do you want me to carry you?" he asked, thumbs brushing Tony's cheekbones.
" Jill finished with a sigh. "
"Oh God, oh God, Shellhead‒ Tony," Steve moaned, blissed out of his mind. "Oh honey, you feel so good."
Tony moaned, rubbing his forehead back and forth against Steve's skin. "I can‒ I can do that, Winghead," he stuttered, legs already trembling in anticipation of how raw he was going to be later, how slick and open, and
"M' gonna have you again," Steve murmured, fingertips wrapping tight around Tony's hips. "Gonna fill you up again - full a' me."
"Baby‒" Tony moaned, panting. "Honey‒ pumpkin patch, please, I want to suck you‒"

. How was something they found in a two-bit hack's lab stumping them? "How the fuck does a group like AIM make something like this? They're all idiots," Tony snapped, flicking one of the tablets away from him. "This is far too sophisticated for this to be their first go at it."
Thor frowned in thought, stared down at the swirling amber liquid in his glass. "It is a most admirable venture you are undertaking," he said then, lifting the stein to take a modest sip, "but I would... caution you to be careful, Tony. I do not wish to see my friend hurt."
"In pigs," Tony said slowly, looking through some of the preliminary test results. "And… a percentage of the phase one participants."
"I've seen your lab," Steve shot back, and Tony snorted, rolling his head to the side so he could peer up at Steve with one watery eye. "I can't believe I'm being the mature one here." Steve laughed again, pressing a quick kiss to Tony's cheek, and then another when he seemed to lean into it. "I once jumped off my apartment building to avoid talking to Jan."
, Stark." His free hand fisted in the sheets and he groaned out loud, ducked his face into his shoulder.
Steve was quiet for a moment, then nodded into Tony's hair. "I will," he promised, brushing a hand through the silky strands.
"What? Tony, no, no, no." Steve ducked his head down into Tony's field of vision, fingers brushing the underside of his chin. "I set it up for you," he explained in a rush, and that brought Tony's thoughts to a grinding halt again.
"What? Don't have to make my guy feel good?" Steve asked, angling the plug in purposefully towards Tony's prostate; Tony choked on his spit then, bowed his back sharply as he moaned, tossing his head in the sheets. "Don't have to thank you for showin' me such a good time?" Steve continued. The widest part of the plug slipped past Tony's hot, leaking asshole, all the way in to the base, and Steve pressed his hand to it, rocking the tip against Tony's prostate in the most intimate, almost-too-much massage that had Tony sobbing in his throat, kicking his feet back against the bed. "Yeah, I bet it's sensitive, isn't it?" Steve sympathised, rolling his palm in slow, deep circles around the base of the plug. Tony cried out, clung to the sheets as the fingers of Steve's other hand came up to play at the head of his cock, purple and swollen and slick with precome . "I really used you tonight," Steve whispered, lips curling into a small as Tony shuddered and whimpered underneath him. "Yeah, I did, didn't I, Shellhead? Used you all up, stuffed you full a' me." Steve's thumb swiped across the head of Tony's dick, spreading the slick there, knuckling in against Tony's perineum with his other hand.
In the car (Sorry, Happy), in the elevator, slowly tripping from the elevator to the middle of the penthouse. Steve kept slipping his fingers against Tony's soft, sweet-smelling skin, nipping at his jaw, rolling his hips slow and sensual against Tony's.
, Steve had pulled him up and into Steve's lap, rocking his still half-hard cock up against the wet spot of Tony's boxer briefs, one hand diving into his pants, the other grasping almost viciously at Tony's jaw so he could lick every trace of come from his face, his lips, his tongue. "
you. Don't come in here and—"
Alone in the bedroom, it was a little harder to keep up the same level of confidence as he stared down at the outfit he wanted to wear. He picked up the soft, silky sheer lace and just let his fingers glide against it for a moment, breathing in the soft scent of whatever detergent it was the cleaning staff used and the barest hint of Steve that still clung to Tony and all his possessions even here, in a corner of the closet either of them barely frequented.
, and he just wanted to take Tony in his arms and never let go. "You love me?" he asked, soft, reverent almost. Tony Stark loved
it felt. "No, no, darling, just leave it at the door and text me after. You saw what Steve did to Thor when I answered the door in my robe, didn't you?
," Tony moaned, breath hitching, saliva pooling his his mouth and throat. Steve just gave Tony another tug at his cock and the clamp, flicking at the tightened nub between the prongs. "Steve, honey, baby, please," he babbled, and there it was, spit dripping from the corners of his mouth, down his chin, into his goatee. The machine sped up once more, the vibrations turned up a notch, and Tony couldn't stop himself from writhing around the machine, bucking his hips back and forth as it fucked into him, steady and buzzing under his skin and he moaned, panting wetly into Steve's shoulder. "Steve, Steve, Steve‒" Tony sobbed.
. "I got you, I got you," Steve swore, pressing kisses along Tony's neck, his collarbone. Tony moaned, felt saliva pooling in his mouth as he panted into the sheets.
, and here he was—
, "Or, or me. I could stay with you. Help you out."
Once the suit and Cap's uniform were sealed up to be carted away, Tony got to scrubbing too, even though he thought it was a bit of a moot point. Better to be safe than sorry, he told himself idly, making sure to wash his hands and where the seams of the armor could potentially have let some of the powder in. The second rinse was colder than the first, and both of them shivered and dripped while they waited for towels and jumpsuits to be passed through the little flaps in the tent.
"Sweetheart, I— I really just do not want to hurt you," Steve murmured, stroked his thumb across the sharp arc of Tony's cheekbone. "That's all. I swear it." An idea struck him then, had Steve gently disentangling them so he could dance around to the other side of the bed, slip his fingers gently under Tony's shoulder and thigh. "Scoot up a bit for me, sweetheart," Steve murmured, settling in behind Tony. He smoothed the palm of his hand down Tony's flank, careful of the hip and leg cast, brushed the inside of Tony's thighs. "Let me prove it to you, handsome," Steve whispered, hot and heavy in Tony's ear as his knuckles hit the soft, smooth skin of Tony's balls; Tony's breath punched out of him in a gasp, his legs instinctively spreading his legs a bit to allow Steve access as he tugged on the sac, played at it between his fingertips.
"No, it's—" Tony bit back his reply, stared down at the sheets between him, his eyes suddenly much brighter than they were before. Steve could see his lashes, fluttering furiously against his cheeks, and Steve felt like a thrice-damned monster. "It's— it's really, it's okay, Steve, it was stupid, you're right, let's just— I should get some rest—"
Eventually they landed at the mansion and scattered, because it would be a cold day in hell before Tony attended a post-mission briefing sober. There was a migraine, sharp and throbbing, building behind his eyeballs, and his joints were starting to feel the effects of the mission from earlier.
"Fine," Steve said, standing and stalking out of the room. He needed— he needed to find Tony, and talk to him, make sure he understood how
prostate stimulation were few and far between, and he'd always been slightly envious of how easily it came for his super soldier boyfriend. And sure, he enjoyed it (hell, did he ever), but he always needed that extra helping hand on his dick to send him over the edge. His prostate felt swollen, oversized and fucked out and reaching the point of oversensitivity, but he wasn't
At least he was using lube this time.
!" Steve shouted, his voice booming in the empty room, sitting up and dragging Tony with him. He brushed at a clump of tears on Tony's cheeks. "Tony, you're
"Jesus Christ," Tony moaned, felt the sharp curl of pleasure in his gut. He felt hard again (
Raw and tender emotion welled up in Tony's chest. "But it's hurting you," he whispered softly, hands sliding up to clasp over Steve's. "You told me it was."
"S'ok?" he rumbled, his hands digging into the soft flesh of Tony's waist, his hips hitching against Tony's. "S'ok? I can?"
"Steve, we need to do something," Tony said gently, flipping to another tablet so he could see the latest scans of Steve's limbic system. "At this rate you're going to have a stroke."
he'd snuck a glance or two in the showers before, just to… see, what the living legend was about, something for the spank bank even, but he hadn't- hadn't been
"Good boy," Steve praised, breathless almost, like he had been waiting for that simple acquiescence from Tony. He fed his cockhead into the warmth of Tony's mouth, slid one large, calloused hand tenderly down the side of Tony's face. Tony shuddered, felt it all the way in his cock, the hot jerk of it in his balls, and groaned around the crown of Steve's dick, felt the sweet salty taste of him on his tongue. Steve's thumb dug in hard, right in the knottiest part of his trapezius, and Tony whined softly, felt his neck and jaw relax even more. "You open up so good for me," Steve sighed, rocking his hips gently, and Tony couldn't help but stick his tongue out even further in an attempt to draw Steve further in. Steve huffed a laugh at the motion, tightened the grip of that big mitt of his in Tony's hair. "You love to suck me so much," he said then, petting lightly at Tony's face. "Yer' a big talker, Stark, but I pull my dick out and you fall all over yourself to stuff that chatterbox a' yours."
Okay, that was fair. Tony fought back the heat he felt crawling up his neck. "Okay, well then, why don't you just… take care of the issue, and then you can hit the gym again. Maybe- maybe lay off the punching bags though," Tony said, eyeing the bloody bandages on his knuckles. How fresh were they? How many times had he split open his skin while Tony was off getting stupid cancer advice? "Did you- I mean, have you tried the other thing Dr. Nguyen suggested? How- how long has this been an issue?" Tony asked gently.
"Good boy," Steve praised, rubbed a proprietary hand down his flank. When he lifted Tony, like a blushing bride in his arms, it looked effortless, his powerful arms, his thick, strong, masculine legs. Tony drifted, and by the time he came to again they were already in the bath, the hot water lapping at the curls of his hair. "I'm gonna take the plug out now, alright?" Steve said, and Tony mumbled something in confirmation, rolling on his bloated stomach so he could peer sleepily up at Steve.
Tony hummed, happily, and the tip of the enema pipe slid out his ass easy as that. God, the sheer-
"That bad?" Steve asked, though he looked like he was already bracing himself for the worst. He looked— God, he looked miles better than he did earlier, but there was still a healthy flush covering his nipples, a sheen of sweat on his body from head to toe. His cock was harder than it had been in the shower, but it wasn't purple or hot or irritated yet. Steve looked all there. Maybe the readout didn't directly correlate to Steve's intoxication.
God, it was bliss.
"I was hoping you'd say that," Steve murmured, setting the dildo back on the top of the dresser and gathering Tony up in his arms. Tony leaned up and Steve bent down and then they were kissing, Steve's lips hot and wet and slick as he licked into Tony's mouth, his hips grinding in slow circles against Tony's cock.
"Steve," Tony whispered, choking on- something-
," Tony hissed. "
Steve whimpered messily, but then he was falling back into Tony's field of vision, hair all askew and eyes wide and blown with lust. "Sorry Shellhead," he murmured, pressing a messy kiss to the side of Tony's face, and then the machine sped up, vibrating ever so slightly, and Tony swore as it as it shifted into place, grazing his prostate and lighting him up from his chest to his toes.
around Tony). And- well, alright, it was silly, to feel embarrassed of his size standing next to handcrafted-by-God-and-Michelangelo-himself Steve Rogers. He wasn't…
"Beautiful," Steve breathed, his lips pressed against Tony's temple, and Tony felt him coming again, felt it coating his insides, felt it sloshing around and slipping out around Steve's dick as he fucked into Tony, dripping down to his thighs, Steve's lap. Steve shifted his grip so that he was lifting Tony with one hand (and
"Tony, you were the
Steve's hips slowed to a slow, sensuous grind, as if he needed that extra energy to concentrate. "Deal," he said, then bit down on Tony's neck, his hand twisting and squeezing over Tony's red, aching cock. Tony moaned out loud, and his gut twisted with heat at the sharp sting of teeth in his skin, the tight clench of Steve's fist on his dick. Steve's other hand, the one that had been holding him across his stomach, slid down past his cock and his balls, right over his perineum. He ground two fingers in hard, almost painfully so, and Tony sobbed and felt himself come, felt it spurt out his hot, angry dick and splash up his stomach, over Steve's fist and wrist. Steve groaned along with him, moaned and jerked when Tony's body clenched up tight around him, and then he was coming too, spurting hot and heavy again into Tony's wet, sloppy, leaking asshole. Gently, like Tony was made of spun glass, he lowered them back down to the bed, rolling them onto their sides so Steve wasn't crushing him.
Tony whined, squeezed his legs together, and tried not to embarrass himself as Steve continued to fuck his face. His jaw ached, spit dripped down his cheeks and chin, and Tony could feel his throat start to flutter and choke as Steve seemed to show no sign of slowing down. One of the thrusts hit particularly hard, and Tony gagged, coughed around the hot length of him, but Steve just moaned and sped his thrusts even further. Another whine, almost a yelp, ripped its way from Tony's throat, and Tony had to reach down and squeeze at his balls, had to hump the air above him to try and get some friction on his dripping, over-sensitive cock. God, he wanted Steve's dick in his mouth forever, could write a fucking epic on how good it felt to have the man jam his cock down his convulsing, raw, overworked throat. His thrusts weren't particularly long, but they were deep and they were
"D'n'wanna," Steve grunted, and leaned forward to suck a purple bruise on the back of Tony's neck. "Stay here." There was a shift in the air, almost, and then Steve was sighing and rolling his forehead against him. "You feel so good," Steve murmured, mouthing at the stinging, swollen hickey on Tony's spine. "Like your body just wants to suck me in." He thrust again, and Tony gasped, felt hot all over (and not just from the sweat pooling in his useless, trembling limbs). His knees dug into the bed, and then Tony was being lifted up into the air, pressed right up against Steve's front.
"B-babe," Tony moaned, dug his fingers into the duvet. Lube squelched out around his ass, around the dildo as it rocked in place, dripping messily down his crack, his thighs. It (and Tony, too, he thought with a shiver) was going to be filthy by the end of this. He whined again, high and in the back of his throat. His nipples throbbed, his cock, hard and heavy between his thighs, bobbed with every brush against his prostate.
"You're so hard," Steve murmured, lips hot and wet against his ear. "You're so wet, Stark. Have you come at all?" His hand slid down, massaged lightly at Tony's tight, sensitive sack. Tony jerked, bit back a yelp as Steve tugged ever so gently at his balls, slid his fingers up Tony's sticky, wet shaft. "Even once?"
Tony was panting now — little hitching breaths that ended in a whine, high in his throat. He buried his face in his pillow, tangled his leg in between Steve's like he could actually fuse them together if he tried hard enough. "I-I won't—" he gasped, fingers tapping an unsteady rhythm on his thigh. "I won't come, honey."
"Mm'I can get up," Tony managed; it took a few wobbly attempts and a strong arm from Steve, but Tony got to his feet and scooted across the living room, following Steve to the bedroom door.
"Are you sure?" Steve asked, hands moving up to massage the backs of Tony's thighs, his ass. "I know I'm not exactly‒" And Steve ducked his head then, a bit shyly, as he gave a small, self-deprecating grin. "I'm not exactly the easiest fit, honey."
"Oh— Steve, honey, oh my god—" Tony gasped, squirming under Steve's touch. Steve grinned, crooked his finger in a little deeper, luxuriating in the way that Tony shivered and moaned in front of him. When he slipped a second finger in him, Tony clamped up tight again, but Steve just held fast, kept his fingers still while Tony adjusted. "Steve, that— that feels so good, slugger, so good, I—" Tony moaned, bit back a keening whine as his body relaxed all at once, let Steve rub slow circles inside of him.
more."
," Tony gasped, scrabbling for purchase but not quite finding any leverage, Steve's arm wrapped tight around Tony's middle and his dick rolling against his prostate over and over again. Steve rumbled out a laugh, rough and sex-low, and Tony choked on a moan when he reached down and palmed at Tony's cock, stiff and leaking against his belly.
"I know, baby, I'm sorry," Steve murmured again, petting Tony's hair. "I said I was just going to watch first, didn't I? But then I saw you all stretched out and I couldn't help myself." Tony whined, and Steve reached back, hit hot, wet fingers dragging messily along the underside of Tony's cock. He traced around the head of his dick, the sensitive ridges, the slit. "If you're very good," Steve whispered hotly into Tony's ear, "I'll let you suck me off before we're done." Then he wrapped the fingers of his free hand around the chain connecting Tony's nipple clamps and gave them a solid, sharp tug, just as he slid his fingers back behind Tony's balls, rubbing at his perineum. "You're so wet already, baby, can't you feel it?" Steve groaned, rubbing harder, before sliding back over the tight sac of his balls, his hot, jerking cock and leaking tip.

Tony sucked at Steve's rim, let his tongue spill out from between his lips and lave along his crease, let it swirl around his hole and just barely dip into the quivering pink pucker. Steve could hear himself moaning, a constant

he could at least give Steve something: some way to help him through this awful experience.
"I think‒" Tony cleared his throat, hand sliding forward to cup at Steve's cock, which jerked and leaked in his hand; Tony felt heady, like he was already halfway under. "I think," he tried again, "that if you don't fuck me soon I might very well die, Winghead."
"Does it hurt, sweetheart?" Tony asked, quiet and gentle. He reached out and ran his fingers through Steve's hair, brushed his bangs back out of his sweaty face. "Steve, are you in pain?"
"Honey, I-" Tony's breath caught and he whined as Steve shifted the both of them so Steve was fucking up against his prostate, so deep, like an itch inside Tony needed scratching even though all Tony wanted to do was buck his hips up against the sweet sensation. Tony's cock, soft and useless between them, flopped against his stomach, but Tony was so loose, so very very sweet that he had trouble caring at how ridiculous it must look. "Honey, honey, please I-"
possibilities Steve had
Steve made no mention of it, however, just kept petting his hair as the water and fluids made their way out of him. Tony whimpered, his abdomen clenching, and just sat on the edge of the tub while he emptied himself out. After a minute, the cramping subsided, and Tony could feel nothing but the cool air of the bathroom ghosting around his hole, and he collapsed against Steve with a groan. Maybe he could just nap, here, for a minute.
," Jan muttered. "
Tony swallowed visibly. "Hey, Steve, we don't— we don't have to do this tonight, or— or ever, you know?" he said with forced levity. He was obviously trying to put Steve at ease. "Some people are more than satisfied with plain ol' vanilla sex, or just taking on one particular role — and just because you don't want to do something doesn't mean it's a bad thing, alright?"
"I do," Tony whispered, feeling something shudder and release in the center of his chest, like his sternum was about to vibrate right out of him. It was all Tony ever wanted— "Steve," Tony whispered again.
, swirling his tongue around the head like it was a lollipop.
Steve rolled his head to the side so he could look up from under his golden lashes at Tony, all wet and dark and clumped together. "That's a boy," Tony murmured. "Okay, listen, Steve, listen very carefully to me, darling, you, you can't keep putting your fist through the wall, alright? You're beating yourself up faster than you can heal—"
He loved the smells of mint and lavender and whatever the fuck else Cindy put in that delectable body scrub, loved the combination of hot wax and pain-plus-adrenaline that came with getting his legs and feet waxed, the way Miranda slowly buffed all the nicks and imperfections his nails and cuticles got from working with machinery day in and day out. Most of the time, people calling him 'Mr. Stark' day in and day out set his teeth on edge ("Mr. Stark was my father,
Perhaps Steve sensed his discomfort, or maybe he was just remembering how tough it had been on his own body, but Steve's hands dropped down to his shoulders, kneading just this side of perfect. "Y'just gotta hold it in for a few minutes and then you can let it all out, yeah?" he said, knuckles making their way down to his lower back before clenching tight into his hips so he could give Tony's joints a little stretch.
"Tony," he said, soft, a little gruff, and all New York, "I
"Hey," Tony said, ducking down into Steve's field of vision; Steve startled to realize he'd sat down on the bed, hunching in on himself. Tony kneeled down on the plush carpet in front of him, one hand on the bed, ever so carefully not touching him. Tony was so careful — always so, so careful, from that first week (when Steve had fucked him
you to be here," Tony seethed, gritting his teeth against a sudden dry heave. "That's kind of the point of not returning a bunch of poorly-spelled text messages and turning off one's phone."
"Not to worry, darling, I have my own!" Tony called back, and Steve could hear his polished shoes clicking decisively on the tile floor. He knew his own doctor was still trying to talk to him, but he'd long ago tuned him out, waiting for even the barest glimpse of Tony. Even though he'd been watching, Steve still startled when Tony turned the corner, his heart rate ratcheting up at the sight of him. He looked…
"Oh, I know you can take it," Steve said fondly, thumb rubbing idly at Tony's tailbone. "God, Tony, you're so slick and loose down there," he continued, sounding almost awestruck. "I'm gonna be able to slip right inside you after this."

"Have a good day, Mr. Stark," Cindy said with a flourish of a bow, ushering her assistants out with her just as Tony rolled off his chair and into Steve's lap.
"I'm less worried about your hands and more worried about that substance you got smacked with earlier today," Tony said through gritted teeth. "I'd like to have someone check you over, Cap." Steve didn't respond and that- that really
"W-w-when you t-tell me to," Steve stuttered, still jerking at himself even as his felt his sac tightening, felt the tight pressure of orgasm building in his groin. Oh God, oh God, it was so hard, he was so
not fifteen minutes ago. Tony chanced a glance down, and yeah, sure enough, his dick was hard, the tip of his dick messy and wet, flushed a deep purple with blood.
Here's to hoping he got to keep his hair, he supposed.
"G-go slowly," Tony breathed out, shuddering, and there was the balm of cool lube slipping over his hole before Steve started gently working the plug into him. Tony gasped, and writhed underneath him, but Steve just clamped his free hand to Tony's hip and held him still, murmuring soft little soothing noises as he slid the plug in and in and Tony felt his body stretch to accommodate it (God, it had to be almost as big as Steve himself, what if it wasn't big enough, what if his body wasn't tight enough to clamp down on it and all the come came slipping back out-).
"Yeah, tiger," Tony murmured, kneading lightly at Steve's neck. Jeez, he was tense. "I could— I could help you out, yeah? With your… problem." Tony almost grimaced. God, he was supposed to be smooth, a playboy, a whore, and he couldn't even properly seduce a hard-and-wanting Steve Rogers? But, Steve— he, he moaned, long and low, and sort of collapsed, against the bed, falling down to his knees and leaning his head against the corner of the mattress. He was panting like he was mid-mission, like he was running full-speed in a knock down drag out against the Hulk, and Tony just— if he was going to propose this to Steve, he couldn't, couldn't do this without giving Steve all his options.
, Tony thought with a giggle as Steve slammed her head into the wall. She dropped like a sack of potatoes, hitting the floor with a heavy
"You're a fucking
guaranteed to send him down to that soft, hazy space, but these soft-spoken words from Steve never— never failed to bring goosebumps to his skin, to cause heat to pool in his cheeks, to make hot, dizzy pleasure swirl in his belly and take up residence in his gnarled, greedy heart. It never failed to surprise him, either — Tony had certainly never been so presumptuous as to lower himself into Steve's lap and demand the man praise him or anything like that. Steve had just… noticed, suddenly curled a hand in Tony's hair one evening and pulled, pressed a
"Oh yeah, there it is - you just needed a little help," Steve crooned, dropping a wet and sticky hand back to his ass. Steve fucked at Tony with one hand and jacked him with the other, the soft pressure building and building until Tony hit that peak and he was sobbing, a handful of tears falling down his cheeks as he spent himself, come dripping over Steve's fingers, onto the cushion, the covers. "Damn," Steve groaned, his strokes gentling. "Hell, Tony, look how much you came." Steve brought his fingers up to Tony's lips again and he sucked at them, licking himself from Steve's hand and pressing little kisses to his palm and god
"Uh…" Steve faltered, a frown twisting his lips. "No… no, that's alright, Jon, thanks. I'll just—" Steve pointed at the door behind them, already turning and stalking out. He focused on just breathing for a minute: in through the nose, out through his mouth, trying not to let his anger get the best of him.
"And if I'd killed him?" Steve asked seriously, but he was watching the play of Tony's fingers on his wrist. "Would it still not be my fault?"
"You are, Tony," Steve said again, rubbing the tightly-wound muscles behind Tony's ears. "You're so very good to me, always. You're the best," he promised, dropping a kiss to Tony's hair. "I'm so— honored, that you go so sweet for me, that you let me give you what you need. That you give me what
"Good boy," Steve praised, hushed, and Tony moaned aloud, let himself sort of rock, gently, into Steve's thrusts, tried to clench down again around Steve as much as he could with his soft, gaping asshole so he could make it a little tighter, a little better for Steve. Steve's thrusts stuttered and he groaned out loud, fingers pressing bright throbbing bruises to his hip bones. "Tony- hell," Steve laughed, sliding his dick through the hot mess of come and lube, and he buried his face between Tony's shoulder blades, latched his teeth on tight. "I'm c-close, honey, I'm gonna come-"
Steve pulled him a bath, poured in all the sweet and spicy soaps that Tony loved to luxuriate in, cradled Tony against his chest and between his thighs. They'd been together long enough now that Steve could use the fine mechanical trimmer to neaten the edges of his goatee that had softened over the course of the day, could practically do it backwards and blindfolded and certainly behind him in the bath. There were sports drinks on the lip of the tub for the both of them to drink when they had time for their more active scenes. Steve would drink any of them, but his favorites were the yellow and light blue flavors, Tony had discovered, so he made sure to stock extras of them all around the mansion and both their bedrooms.
"Ah, no thank you," Steve said, flush beginning to crawl down his neck to his chest. Tony watched it with glee, itching to follow the blush with his teeth.
A yell burst out of Tony then, suspiciously high and wet, and he threw his hands in Steve's criminally short cut so he had something to hold onto as he shuddered through his release, spattering come all over Steve's fist and abs and cock. "Oh, oh,
Tony's ears burned, and he turned his focus down to the cooler in his arms. "I don't know who you've been talking to," Tony started steadily (far more steadily than he felt, actually), "but it is
Tony was on the phone. There was a garbled, buzzing noise coming through the cell phone that Steve should really have been able to understand, but everything was so… so fuzzy, and not right, and Steve could barely tell which way was up, let alone what someone was saying eighteen inches away in a tiny electronic device.
) once he was fully in control of all his mental faculties was just too much to imagine. Once this whole ordeal was over, Tony had no doubt that Steve would be on the first bus out of here, to say nothing of whether or not he'd even remain on the Ultimates. Tony shivered again, which sent a shiver down Steve's own spine, and roughly cleared his throat. "In the meantime," he mumbled, "we still have to take care of you."
wanted (as opposed to what Steve wanted, as if their needs and wants were really that different), even though Tony was constantly giving more and more of himself to Steve.
than it had ever been, in his entire goddamn life, and he was tempted to test his own blood, see if maybe he'd gotten a second-hand high from all the sex he'd been having with his coked-up super soldier.
And it wasn't that Steve was against pleasure; Steve was probably one of the most responsive people he'd ever been with. He loved when Tony blew him, when he sucked that hot, huge monster of a dick down his throat, and Tony loved how surprised Steve was when he did it, every time, like he didn't expect Tony to want to put Steve's big, beautiful cock as far down his throat as he could (even when it made him choke and gag, and spit dribble down his mouth and jaw). He turned such a pretty coral pink, a rosy hot flush from his cheeks down to his sweet, perky nipples, even as far as his abs and thighs when he started getting close, the juddering shake and tightening of his thighs warning Tony of his impending orgasm. The harder he came, the longer his respite from the drug was, Tony noticed, so he made it his sole mission to make every orgasm even better than the last.
It seemed to take Steve a while to settle, his mind syrupy slow from the thick, hazy fog of the drug. Tony certainly couldn't move a Steve Rogers who didn't want to be moved, but he was conscious enough to help Tony shuffle him up to the bed, back against the headboard. He was still breathing deeply, but not as fast or harsh as before the two orgasms. That, more than anything, gave Tony a bit of relief. Thank
"It's okay, Steve," Tony soothed, working himself down, bending forward and collapsing onto his forearms. Tony knocked their foreheads together, rolled his face against Steve's. "I've got you, baby, it's okay, I've got you—" Steve surged forward and sealed their lips together, lube-slick hands wrapping tight around Tony's middle. He whimpered into the kiss, hips rolling up, fucking into Tony far slower than he needed to be. "Come on baby," Tony prodded, panting hot and against his lips. "C'mon, Steve— fuck me like you mean it sweetheart—"
"Oh, I'm definitely insulting you," Steve murmured, his huge, hot hands sliding slowly down Tony's sides. Tony could feel Steve's cock, hot and hard and angry up against his backside, but aside from the soft hitch of his hips as Steve snuggled further in, he made no move to deal with it. "Now go back to sleep," he huffed and burrowed his nose in the crook of Tony's neck.
, but then Steve's fat cockhead was sliding past that first ring of muscle. Steve and Tony both groaned, like it was punched out of them, and Steve surged up to kiss him as Tony began to slide deeper and deeper inside.
"That'd be a negative, Wasp," Tony sighed. "It didn't get sprayed during the fight, but we're both covered in the stuff, and the substance was airborne beforehand. It's going to need to be handled with hazmat suits until one of my techs can disinfect it." Tony didn't know if it was still in the air with them (since his suit had its own air filtration system and Steve seemed to be immune to it for the time being), but he'd rather go through decon than accidentally have all Jan's internal organs implode.
. "I'm not- I'm not going to
"Okay," Tony said simply, reaching out to drop the bottle of lube in Steve's hand, to curl Steve's fingers proprietarily around the clear plastic. He shifted backwards, his legs splaying, and Steve zeroed in on the bob of Tony's half-hard cock against his thigh. Tony shifted, moved to turn over on his stomach, and Steve reached out a hand, settled it gently over the curve of Tony's hip. "O-oh," Tony murmured, a gentle blush slipping over his cheekbones. "I thought—?"
"Let me get you off again," Tony whispered, sliding his hands through the water so he could touch Steve, his already hot and throbbing length bobbing up between them.
thought 'just the right amount'," Steve snorted, snuffling softly as he scooted forward and tried to mold their bodies together from head to toe. "Ya ever managed to shut off that big brain of yours, Stark? Even for a minute?"
"Y're thinkin' too much," Steve mumbled, swiping out and dragging Tony down to snuggle beside him. "Y' need the sleep more than I do."
"Yeah, I didn't quite take this into account when I made your uniform," Tony sighed. He reached out and tugged up on the panels, finally shimmying the uniform top over Steve's goddamn linebacker shoulders, throwing it to the floor with a wet
"Shit," Tony hissed, flipping back into the comms. "Hey Wasp? We've got an intact hard drive from one of the computers here, but we're going to need a decontamination unit as well." It was hard to tell under all the orange, but it looked like there was a flush rising in Cap's cheeks. "Sooner rather than later would be appreciated."
He fell forward, nosing into the curls at his groin, and started to lick up the come all over his skin, and Steve jolted, moaned like a goddamn porn star as Tony's tongue curled around the base of his groin, the sharp curve of his hipbone, his soft, sensitive belly button. When his lips closed around the tip of his cock, Steve gasped and gave a full-body shudder, his teeth digging even harder into his skin. Tony hummed his disapproval and reached up to grab his hand and pull it down to tangle in his hair. Steve's fingers latched on tight, and Tony hummed again, this time in pleasure as Steve tugged and yanked on the thick, short curls.
"Definitely," Steve said in a rush, pressing quick kisses along his jaw and throat.
"Yeah," Steve breathed, soft and a little shy, and then he was dragging a hand through Tony's hair and down to his jaw to thumb the corner of Tony's mouth open so he could feed his cock between Tony's lips.
Tony waited a moment for any kind of follow-up, but after about thirty seconds of silence Tony made a face, propping a hand on his hip. "So… I guess I'll just go get him then?"
There was something he needed to talk to Tony about. This was— this was something he should say to him, Steve thought very deliberately. "Not a bad thing," Steve whispered, brushing his knuckles to the back of Tony's face, gentle against his jaw and bruise, and then he reached back down and dipped a finger in, quick but not hard, just too fast for Tony to overthink it or tense up. Tony made a noise that made Steve's cock perk up in interest, and he rolled his head back.
"What?" Tony asked again.
to move it, almost of its own accord, like it was anticipating Steve's needs and clamoring to shift where it could best serve Steve.
Tony felt a shiver run down his spine. "You should," he managed to rumble back, fingers digging into the meat of his ass. Tony sighed and rocked his hips forward, delighted to see Steve was already ready to go again after the two orgasms he'd had in the car (
Straight to voicemail.
Tony moaned, again and again, kneaded his fingers into the firm flesh of Steve's ass as he tried to swallow Steve's cock down even further, tried to tell him how okay it was for Steve to push it all the way when his mouth was already so full of him. Tony's own hips rolled, and he whined, lifted his head up just far enough that he could let his throat spasm around Steve's fat, dripping cockhead. Steve shouted, like it was punched out of him, and what was left of Steve's self-control melted into nothingness. He fucked his hips forward, driving his dick deep down Tony's throat, so quick and hard that Tony could barely even suck at him, couldn't do anything but lay back and enjoy the ride.
It was… it was selfish, Steve knew, to be thinking like this, thinking of him and Tony closer than Steve had ever been with another man, hoping- hoping maybe closer than Tony had been with another man, too? He said he usually insisted, so... did that mean...? Sitting here and thinking about it, it was like a dam bursting on all his perfectly-controlled restraint, and he could feel the hazy rage of the drug tickling at his consciousness once more.
"I've got your number now, Stark," Steve murmured, cock rubbing just under the curve of Tony's buttocks, slippery and wet from the copious amount of precome he was leaking. Fingers slipped between Tony's cheeks, tugging at the base of the plug nestled inside of him; Tony gasped. "Yeah, that's it," Steve praised, fingers falling off and returning slick and cool with lube, smearing between his cheeks, all around and inside the edge of Tony's rim. His body had clenched up tight around it, but Steve was patient, persistent, almost lackadaisical in the way he fingered lube inside of Tony, how he gently rocked and eased the plug out of his body. "Good boy," Steve hummed, and Tony felt the shock of that phrase all the way down to his toes, the way his body relaxed and loosened and his head rolled back into the crook of Steve's neck as he shook and panted.
." Steve hummed into his mouth and rolled his hips up, and Tony whimpered and bit at Steve's lip.
Steve smiled against his skin and held on tight.
"Come now, darling, t-that's hardly true—" Tony stuttered out.
Steve moaned, so loudly, gripped his hands in the sheets and tried to still his hips from bucking up. He knew Tony could deepthroat, had little trouble swallowing down Steve considering the size of him, so if he was just sucking on the head, it was for a reason. Steve grit his teeth, squeezed his eyes shut even tighter, and bit back his whimper as Tony hollowed his cheeks and sucked on him even harder, letting his tongue play into the slit as he massaged at the entrance to Steve's ass.
Tony bit back a whine, sucking his lower lip between his teeth; he grabbed at Steve's thighs, spread them even further apart and pushed them up to his chest. Tony let himself thrust a little faster then, let his core and hips get into it so he could give Steve a nice, hard, deep fuck, a fuck that would light him up inside, leave him feeling heady and filled to the brim. He wanted Steve to really feel it, to feel sore like he'd fought one on one with the Hulk, satisfied like he'd gone ten rounds with the special heavy bags Tony'd made for him, relieved like maybe Tony could actually fuck the drug out of him—
," Steve seethed, totally at odds with the soft way he was still bumping his face against Tony's. "Do you think I wanted anyone else in here with me? Do you think I want to have sex with
"And w-what‒" Tony managed to say, "what might that be, stud?" God Tony felt appalled at himself ‒ Tony was
"Stop," Tony mumbled, the heat crawling up his neck, the humiliating rush of pleasure he felt at just being called 'good' by Steve. Surely he wasn't that easy, was he? Except, here he was, his cock stiff and red and drooling, a burst of precome dripping fresh from his slit with just a few words from Steve. Could he - could he
"H-honey," Tony moaned, felt goosebumps prickle down his arms and spine. When he tried to clench down around Steve, he heard a squelch, loud and embarrassingly sexual in the heat damp of the room around them, and Steve laughed, fucked his hips faster through the slippery slick between them.
"It's alright, Captain," Dr. Nguyen murmured to Steve, who was in the middle of doing the world's best impersonation of a mute tomato. "This is probably one of the side effects.  It's not surprising, considering the hormone fluctuation. I'm honestly shocked it hasn't happened sooner."
body. He bent forward so he could catch a nipple between his teeth. Steve gasped, unconsciously arching up at the touch. "Like that?" Tony whispered, humming brightly around the small pink nub. He bit down again, then sucked on it, hard. "I'm learning all sorts of things about you, Cap."
Tony's heart fluttered, and he stamped down the tiny piece of hope in him. "Okay, so no escorts, that's fine, but you know, there's always Wanda, or, or Jan, or—well, maybe not Clint or Pietro, and we need to keep Thor available in case we need a heavy hitter, so he can't be stuck in bed for however long, but I mean—"
Tony was going to say yes, "‒but I had a feeling it was something you wanted to try, and," A hot flush crawled across Steve's neck, coloring his cheekbones, his chest, and turning nipples a deep, dark red. "And you've mentioned before, how, how nice it'd be, for me to just be able to‒ to slip right in and‒"
‒ Tony hissed in a breath and traced his fingertips up the cleft of Steve's ass and Steve shuddered, hands coming down to rest on Tony's shoulders. He clung to Tony, mouthing at the shell of his ear and moving his hips in tiny, shifting circles, causing the skirt to ruffle and and twist and good
"Alright, you're green," Steve said, laughing; he kissed at Tony's hair and grabbed his hips with both hands again. "I'm gonna go one more time, okay? Sound good? Think you can hold out a little longer for me, baby?"
"Yeah, uh," Steve was frowning, Tony could tell, from the tense of his shoulders to the tone of his voice, to the way his lips felt against Tony's head, "I don't think I'll be able to do that anytime soon." Despite his words and the softness of his dick, Steve's hips were still shifting, still rocking gently against the bed. Steve groaned raggedly, reached down to tug at his dick with sharp, rapid movements. "Maybe—" Steve's voice hitched, cracking along the word. "Maybe I can get it back up—" He kept at it for a minute, trying to coax some life back into it, but it stayed stubbornly half-hard between his legs. Steve's brows pinched. Tony wasn't sure if he should be flattered that Steve seemed to care that much about his comfort to be able to get his rocks off, or horrified that he'd traumatized Steve so severely that even an all-encompassing sex drug couldn't help him keep his erection.
. I— have wanted you for a very long time." Steve sighed, brushing Tony's bangs from his face. "You seem to be thinking I'm this paragon of all that's good and right in the world, and I am
"I'd really like you to consider this treatment regimen, Tony," Dr. Roberts said once he'd finally sauntered into the man's office. "It's a little aggressive, but the results look promising, and we're seeing a shrinkage in tumor size on an average of twenty to thirty percent."
"So good," Steve murmured, pet across Tony's face with his other hand, careful not to get any more mess on his face. It twisted something in Tony's chest to feel it, that kind consideration and regard. "You're so good to me."
Tony was certain he should've said something snarky in reply, but he was far too relaxed to think of anything other than a soft hum, turning his hand over to tangle his fingers with Steve's. Steve instantly latched on, practically beaming at Tony as they finished up with the wax and moved to start lathering the body oil on.
By the time he got back to the mansion, Tony wasn't too proud to admit he was dragging. While he'd achieved a somewhat comfortable buzz from the alcohol, it didn't quite have the desired effect; his head was still pounding, his body aching. Still, some pain relief was better than none, so Tony took what he could get, and went off in search of Cap. There hadn't been any alerts on his phone or the Ultimate comms, but
"Iron Man," Cap piped up, off comm. Tony whirled around, silencing his own comm, and stomped over, boots crunching glass and debris under foot. "These still look intact," Cap said once we was closer and—lo and behold—the screen was still glowing and what looked to be in the middle of a massive data download.
"My turn now," Tony rumbled, tipping them to the side so he was the one over Steve, fingers slipping down to rub at his perineum and milk the last vestiges of pleasure from his body as Steve shook and trembled beneath him.
"Y‒you, you pick honey bunches," Tony sobbed, and he gasped for breath again because the speed and vibrations had picked up again.
Eventually, Tony sat up, and Steve finally got a good look at him — his cherry red lips, his slick, wet mouth and chin. Tony beamed, sucking at his lower lip and shuddering against him. Tony fell forward, wiggling his way back up Steve's side so he could kiss at his neck, one hand reaching up to tangle into Steve's hair. They laid like that for awhile, Steve trembling through the aftershocks while Tony gently pet his hair, Tony's cock a hot brand of iron against his leg, his lips a comforting presence under his jaw. He was whispering sweet nothings, Steve could tell, even if he didn't quite have the brain power to decipher it at the moment.
"I think I'm done tasting my own bile for the moment," he rasped, pulling on a shaky grin.
Tony's eyes filled with tears, and he had to fight back a sudden ache in his throat that had nothing to do with the cock in it.
It must have been the right call. Tony shuddered again, melting back into Steve, pressing his head into the crook of Steve's neck. Steve could hear the sounds of the monitors picking up, tied to Tony's O₂ stats, his heartbeat. Steve reached back, grabbed the lube from his pocket again. Pressed so tight together like this, Steve could feel every twitch, every hitch in his breath. He could feel Tony's tight hole, hot under his fingertip, slicky smeared with cold lube. Tony was always so tight, at first — tough to to relax, to unclench every muscle he kept on lockdown. Bottoming was harder on Tony, Steve knew; and not just physically, but mentally, as well. He got anxious (both about the actual penetration and his body's reaction to it), which certainly didn't help matters, and Steve had the distinct impression that he'd had lovers who'd treated him… poorly, in the past, to say the least. Then there was also the matter of how damn big Steve was. Honestly it was a gift, being able to make love to Tony like that, considering the numerous odds stacked against them and this time was no different, regardless of whether or not Tony's body would cooperate with them.
Steve gasped, slipped his fingers over the wet sticky head of his cock once again, and was
," Tony gasped, feeling it build in his toes and sliding up into his knees and thighs. His legs were shaking. "Oh Steve, I'm so close‒" he whispered brokenly, biting back against a sob, and Steve just swirled his tongue faster, harder against Tony's dick, and Tony was coming, shaking apart under Steve, his groin throbbing and clenching and burning wet and warm, breath catching in his throat as he tried to remember what
"N-no," Tony hiccuped, and then covered his face with his hand so he could cry some more. They weren't even quiet, subtle tears — no, these were body-racking sobs, and a raw, aching throat, snot dripping from his nose into his mustache and goatee.
Steve felt for hurting him, that he understood how Steve felt—
Tony grit his teeth. "It would make me
, Rogers," Tony snapped, spitting viciously in the toilet.
Tony's eyes widened, so bright and blue and beautiful, and then his lashes were fluttering shut, his hips rolling back. The soft opening of his rim caught on Steve's cock, and he choked, fire burning in his lungs and his veins, then the head popped in, and Steve was gone, he was so very very
to be gaping, to be able to take Steve).
Steve jerked again, his cock finally hardening up between them, messy and wet at the tip, and then he was combing Tony's hair back with his fingers, rolling his forehead affectionately under Tony's jaw. "Good," he breathed out, messily petting at the nape of Tony's neck. "Tha's so good Tony, thank you," Steve slurred, dropped a kiss to Tony's chin. "Good boy, Tony, thank you."
"Yeah, well, how can I say no to my best guy?" Tony murmured, and affection bloomed in his chest, spreading out like sunshine to his fingers and toes.
Steve frowned up at him, all grumpy and adorable, and it looked nothing like it usually did when he was all pissed off and ready to shout at Tony, because all he did was reach up to tug at the zipper of Tony's slacks, and run two huge fingers down the soaking wet fabric of Tony's panties. There was a high-pitched whine that Tony belatedly realized had come from
Steve choked out another sob, then finally opened his eyes, bloodshot and glazed over with fever and need. He blinked blearily at Tony, then looked pointedly down at his erection. "It's… it's a little difficult at the moment, Stark."
Steve tossed the filthy, soiled sheets to the corner of the room and grabbed a clean set from the closet. "You wanted clean sheets, right?" Steve said, stretching the fitted cotton over the mattress and tossing a clean blanket on top. "Come on."
"Go to sleep, Tony," Steve replied, and buried his face in Tony's hair.
the time. Tony shivered again, made a face, spit into the toilet and looked like he was trying not to hurl again. "S'a new study. Twice the chemo, twice th' drugs," he slurred. "Tryin' t' see if they can beat the tumor outta' me."
Tony moaned, opened his mouth around the curve of a word.
Tony felt like he'd barely finished shaking when Steve's legs cinched around his hips, rolled them over so that Steve was on top, Tony lying stunned underneath him. He sunk down on Tony all at once, his ass rippling like a vice around Tony's cock. Tony shouted, the sound catching in his throat and devolving into a moan, rough and rumbling deep in his chest. He was shaking again, trembling all around Steve, freezing where they weren't touching, but then Steve was digging his knees in and lifting up to fuck himself on Tony's dick and Tony forgot all about how cold he was for awhile.
Steve choked, moaning into Tony's mouth, then he dug his fingers in, flipped them over, and fucked him like he meant it.
"Yeah, sounds good," Clint said.
"I-I-I tried—" Steve's voice cracked, his teeth chattering loudly in the din of the room. "I tried her advice," he continued miserably, squeezed his eyes shut. "B-but it w-wouldn't go away, and my— I was too sore, I—had to stop."
me to tell you how good you are."
Tony's entire body felt hot. He— he knew it was embarrassing, the big, heavy, bedazzled plug he bought on a whim. He didn't use it on himself all too often (really only used it when he was feeling particularly cock-hungry, when his body was aching and throbbing and not even his pills or booze could help); it was heavy, unforgiving steel that Tony needed to be in a particular mood for, and— well, Tony knew the jewel on the base of it probably revealed more about Tony than he was comfortable with but—
giving up control…
Tony looked up from his lump on the floor. His eyes were watery and red-rimmed, made starker by the bruising under them, and the robe he was wearing was barely belted so Steve could see every slash of black and blue he'd put on the man. He was sweating and shaking, and Tony opened his mouth to say something to Steve, but turned at the last second so he could puke in the toilet. Tony's shoulders heaved as he pressed his face to the seat, spitting into the bowl and letting out a low, agonizing whine.
Tony could see when he hazed out again: his pupils dilated, his words started to stick in his throat, and his muscles seemed to ripple underneath his skin. Steve groaned and sat up, clasping either hand to Tony's jaw and licking into his mouth. "Tony," he panted, "Tony, Tony, Tony." Almost faster than Tony could track, he was flipping them so Tony was the one on his back, Steve straddling Tony's thighs, hunched over and moaning into the sheets. "Please," he whispered, hitching his hot, wet cock hitching along the crease of Tony's pelvis. "Please, please, I need—" Steve's hands slammed into the mattress on either side of Tony's head, his arms trembling.
"'Did I enjoy myself', the man asks," Tony says, words soft and slurring. "Man makes me come harder than I have in over half my adult life and he asks me 'did I enjoy myself'." But he smiled, burrowing further into Steve's warmth, tapping his foot to Steve's ankle. "Was I‒ was it good for you, too?"
, Tony thought hysterically, and tightened his grip on Steve's bicep.
, that's exactly what Tony needed.
"веселиться в аду," he spit at them, right before he started seizing and his eyeballs exploded in his skull.
," Steve chastised, his cheeks taking on a rosy hue.
Steve's fingers clenched against his ass, and then he was surging up, Tony's legs falling to the bed, and Steve was kissing Tony, needy and sloppy, whining softly against his lips. He pressed kiss after kiss to Tony's lips, hands cradling Tony's jaw so gently it made heat prickle behind Tony's eyes and emotion claw at the inside of his throat.
of Steve's needs, even needs he hadn't even anticipated for himself. Tony was— he was the most considerate lover, the most considerate friend — possibly the most considerate person Steve had ever met. It was a humbling thing, certainly, to be with him, Steve knew. Sometimes…
. He hadn't seen Tony in almost nine hours, he knew for sure that he hadn't filled his prescriptions from Dr. Nguyen, or stopped by the kitchen to get something to eat, or even come out to see
"Get ready, Shellhead," Steve murmured hotly. "I'm gonna take you."
"Ugh," Steve grunted, trying to struggle his way out of the wet kevlar-chainmail combination. Wetted down like that, it probably weighed a ton, and Tony grimaced. No way that was going to be an easy strip.
, Steve Rogers, who— who swore too much, whose best friend wore dentures because his teeth all fell out, who talked better with his fists than his words most days. Steve Rogers, a ham-handed, bumbling oaf a man, and sweet, suave, wonderful
of the lube cap echoed loudly in the room around them, and Steve watched with wide eyes as Tony reached a shiny, wet, dripping hand behind him. There was something he'd wanted to say to Tony, certainly, but now all he could focus on was the slick wet sounds of— of Tony—
Tony hummed, felt his eyes flutter shut, and the next time he felt Steve's hands they were in his hair, slick and slippery, and Tony could smell the spiciness of the shampoo Steve used all around him. It felt heavenly, to have Steve scrub at his skull, to feel his huge palm covering Tony's eyes so he could rinse the shampoo from his hair. Surprisingly enough there was conditioner next, some soft and delicate scent that had Tony slipping deeper and deeper into the soft hazy sweetness he was feeling. "Do you want to stay in the bath for this or go to the toilet?" Steve murmured, and it took a minute for Tony to hear it, to be able to lift his head up and blink gingerly up at Steve.
"Honey—" Tony gasped.
Steve smiled and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to Tony's lips. "You're so sweet right now, baby," he whispered. "So sweet and so, so under." Tony felt his cheeks heat despite himself and he squirmed, tilting his head to duck back against Steve's neck. Steve laughed, and hummed, and rolled his hips, his hot, wet cock bumping the back of Tony's balls, sliding up between his cheeks. "I know, I know, you don't like when I mention it," he teased, sucking a hot bruise to Tony's shoulder. Tony shuddered visibly and moaned, his hands coming up to grasp the shorter hairs at the back of Steve's head. The cuffs suddenly felt huge on his wrists and his ankles, heavy like they were weighing him down (weighing him down to
When Steve finally pulled his cock out, come spilled out, over his tongue and out his mouth, and Tony sputtered and coughed and gasped and dear God, Tony had never felt so turned on in his life. Tony moaned, squeezing his eyes shut as he rolled on his side, licking the come from his lips and panting and pressing the heel of his hand against his cock.
Jenna and Cindy giggled, but started gathering up the supplies. "We'll leave you two alone to get dressed," Jenna with a tilt of her head. "Please let us know if you need anything at all Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers."
"Oh Tony," Steve said between kisses. "I'm going to make this
"Oh you're ready," Steve noted lightly, slipping his fingers out so he could drag a fingernail up the meat of Tony's ass, along the curve of his spine. "You're so beautiful, baby," Steve rumbled, and Tony preened, his cock bobbing hard and heavy between his legs. Steve chuckled, and slid a loving hand through Tony's hair. He heard the clank of machinery being adjusted, and then there it was ‒ the cool, smooth slide of the dildo working into his hole, and Tony moaned, low and guttural as he tried to keep his hips still while Steve pumped it in and out a few times. Steve pulled the dildo out and Tony wanted to whine
Tony moaned suddenly, his gut clenching and throbbing as he lowered himself to swallow down more of Steve, throat rumbling and spasming as he pulled out all the stops, tried to make it as good as possible for Steve despite how short this blowjob was going to be‒
Tony shuddered. "Darling, I'm on chemo," he murmured, stroking one reverent finger down the side of Steve's face. "A strong breeze could bruise me right now — don't worry too much about it, alright?"
, he was going to be gaping by the end of this (he'd
"No need to thank me," Steve teased; he patted the side of Tony's ass, gently but firmly, rolling his hips idly, like he was gearing them both up for another round. "Just givin' my fella what he needs, right? How could I do anything less?" Steve hummed, grabbed at both of Tony's thighs and spread them so he could (presumably) stare at his dick again, the slow, sensual slide of it between Tony's cheeks, the cling of Tony's rim against his shaft. "Hmm, fella? That's what a boyfriend does, right?" Steve asked idly; Tony could feel his thrusts speeding up. "You feel so good, Tony - oh, you're being so good for me. Am I giving you what you need, honey? Everything you were wanting?"
"Wh— what are you doing?" Tony asked, glaring poutily at Steve as he manhandled him onto his side beside Steve. "Wh— Steve, come on, you're hard again, I've seen it, I can feel it—"
"We were trying to do the exact opposite!" Jan yelled back. She threw her hands up in the air. "It was supposed to calm him down and force him to change back into Banner, but we couldn't get it to work and had to move on to the Hulk sedative. I don't even know how they
the two of us could do together that would make me unhappy."
. "You love me?" he asked again, and Steve could feel his lips pulling back into a wide, beaming grin.
Tony's breath left him all in a rush, and he sobbed, pressing his face further into the bed so he could buck back against Steve again. "Thank you, baby- thank you-"
There was a sigh of heavy relief on the comm, and Jan switched them back to global. "
Tony was worried. He had a text from Jill saying she and Jan were working on synthesizing some type of counteragent for the drug, but no progress had been made as of yet.
"Whatever you're thinking," Steve whispered in his ear, "Stop." He pressed his hand to Tony's stomach again, rocked the heel of his hand against him just so, so that Tony was gasping, sobbing into Steve's hold. "That's my good boy," Steve praised, sweetly, genuinely, even as Tony felt the shock of it in his cock and down to his toes. "You're absolutely perfect - just look at you, huh?" Tony moaned, spit slipping from his lips and down into his chin and beard, shook his head furiously. "Oh, no, Tony, you are sweetheart, you absolutely are - my sweet, good, beautiful boy," Steve whispered, the sound of it so awestruck it had tears pricking at his eyes. "You're pretty sweet right now, aren't you baby? Yeah? How would you like it if I dragged that big mirror from the closet out here, hmm? 'Propped it up so you could see how big you are, how much of me I've put into you."
Tony's shoulders sagged in relief. "Will do, buddy," he murmured, knocking shoulders with him as he passed.
"I'm fine," Steve grunted, wiping at his face with a relatively clean part of his forearm. His skin was still stained the color of a pumpkin, and he was breathing a little heavy, but he didn't seem to be in danger of his eyes bursting. "Not much that can take me out," he said, jaw flexing before he spit on the ground. He made a small face, sticking out his tongue, and Tony almost laughed at the absurdity of it. If Steve was another man, Tony might have called it
"Shh," Steve soothed, finally leaning forward so he could pull the stopper out of the tub. Steve rinsed them off, grabbed a stack of towels from the warming rack on the wall, and toweled Tony ever-so-gently dry before wrapping him in one of his decadent fluffy robes the team always gave him shit for. "You please me so well," Steve murmured, grabbing Tony around the waist again so he could lift him up, carry him out and into the bedroom.
"H-honey, Steve, sweetie— Steve
- "Steve, honey," Tony said helplessly, licking his lips. "We need to get you back to Medical—"
"Yeah," Tony whispered hoarsely, pulling on a smile. "I'm surprised you know what it is."
"Mm, I don't need it," Steve said, petting a hand through Tony's hair. "M' fine with just sittin' here with you."
"You giving your dick a rug burn is not going to help the situation," Tony said eventually, snuffling against his throat. He grabbed at Steve's hand and held it, just for a minute, to try and build up the courage to suggest what they could do next. "I may—" Tony coughed to clear his throat, "have something we can try."
good, peaches." Steve pulled his fingers out and Tony immediately wanted to whine at the loss, but then Steve was shifting over, presumably reaching under the bed for the ramp cushion they sometimes kept under the bed‒
"I love you," Tony gasped, his eyes fluttering shut against the wave of raw emotion welling up inside him.
"Oh, that's perfect," Tony breathed, sucked a searing kiss to Steve's skin. "Just like that, baby. Get yourself all worked up for me. Are you gonna come?"
"I don't need anything," Steve snapped. "Serum'll take care of any bruising in a few hours." Tony—
, and he panted into the junction of Steve's neck, while Steve rubbed soft and steady circles against Tony's lower back. "'Till then, I'm just gonna sit back and enjoy the show, okay baby? Think you can do that for me?"
"It was really more like three walls-" Tony tried weakly, but Steve gave him a look and Tony wilted, slipped his hands up and around Steve so he could hold on tight. "Steve, Steve—"
"That's fine," Steve murmured, and he grabbed something from the dresser; it was a silk handkerchief and when he unwrapped it, Tony could see a slim, bright red dildo sitting there in the palm of his hand. "I got something a little more your size," he continued, and Tony could tell that Steve meant it as a tease, but his voice came out all low and sex-rough, his eyes dark and wanting as he stared down at Tony.
, like he was swimming through sweet cotton candy, warm with the thick, pulsing heat of Steve between his thighs. He never wanted Steve to leave. "Feels so
"If you'll excuse me," Tony whispered, and dashed out like his suit was on fire.
," Steve whispered reverently, both hands petting Tony's hair and face now, his legs practically jerking as his hips rocked ever so gently back and forth into Tony's mouth and Tony just swallowed and swallowed and swallowed. "Oh, oh, Tony,
, it hurts—"
Tony moaned low in his throat. "Oh baby, honey Steve please," he gasped, voice catching on the vowels, just beginning to crack and break. Steve's other hand slid around to cup at his face and Tony turned his head to press kisses on it, to wrap his lips around his digits and suck hard. He swirled his tongue around Steve's thumb and moaned. "Please please please," Tony moaned again. He was so, so close, his orgasm just barely out of reach. Unlike Steve, the times he was able to come from
—" Steve moaned.
"That's—" Tony's teeth chattered, and he had to gulp back a whine. "Steve, honey, that's hardly salacious," he stuttered, arching his ass into the touch. Steve pinched him, a bit roughly, then dragged his lips down the back of Tony's neck, not particularly shy about how wet it was, how much tongue he used. Tony shuddered, felt his body tingling all over, like he'd just crushed and swallowed a Vicodin and chased it with gin. His body moved where Steve moved it, where Steve
"Was' a sick kid," Steve said with a shrug, spinning the attachment onto the hose. "This was pretty much the cure to everything back in the '30s. You wanna stay in the tub for this?"
"But-" Tony started, frowned when Steve pressed a finger to Tony's lips.
, Tony thought dreamily.
Tony moaned, felt his dick jerk against his belly, slapping wetly into the hot dampness of his panties. Steve rolled his hips again, pulling out long enough for Tony to suck at the soft, velvety head of him before sliding back in and holding his cock right at the edge of his throat. There was a trick to it (deepthroating, that is), almost like riding a bicycle - you just had to hop back on it and start
"—this could actually be a good thing, Captain," Nguyen was saying when Tony came out of his lust-induced stupor. "Orgasm is known to set your body to a sort of, equilibrium state, it could help balance out all the adrenaline and testosterone rushes you keep experiencing—"
Steve moaned, low and desperate, and Tony could feel his insides coating hot with come, with Steve's come, felt it splashing and sloshing as Steve's hips jerked messily through the aftershocks, still valiantly massaging Tony's cock and‒ god, he was so close‒
. How are you going to be able to hold off for me if just a little kiss gets you so needy?"
"I usually prefer the latter," Steve quipped back with a little quirk of a grin; he wrapped his fingers around the base of Tony, squeezed at him, and Tony jolted out a moan, clutching at the starchy hospital sheets beneath him. "I can't really get you off like this, I don't think," he continued, alternating between just rubbing his fingertips over Tony's dick and squeezing at the shaft of him. "Not with this tube in 'ya — I don't wanna hurt you, after all."
tears of real joy, even as Steve slowly massaged the hinges of Tony's jaw and the fucking machine vibrated deep in his ass. "Please, please oh please, baby-"
Tony hitched a breath. "Please," he moaned prettily and rolled his chest up. Steve hadn't cuffed his wrists yet, but he'd placed his hands there so deliberately, Tony didn't want to move them without asking first. It was a little awkward to get the proper leverage, but he still managed to pull himself somewhat upright, chest heaving. "Please, please, yes," Tony moaned again.
," Tony begged, hips rolling up to meet his. "Honey, sugar muffin please‒ come on big boy, I wanna feel you come in me‒" Steve swore, fingers working furiously at Tony's dick even as he could feel Steve's thighs beginning to tremble, his hips begin to stutter. "That's right, stud," Tony moaned, clenching again to work him from the inside, feeling warmth starting to spread from his toes up. "Come on, big guy, you can do it, honey bunches‒"
