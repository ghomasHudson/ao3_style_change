Tony didn’t have to think; he acted on pure instinct. Before he thought about it, the armor gauntlet wrapped around his wrist and blasted him. The Skrull evaded the first and then the second beam like a proper Spider-Man, but he didn’t fool him.
Was all that just a dream? It wasn’t fading away like the usual dreams. Every detail was still painstakingly clear.
Tony turned his gaze away again, lips thinned in a white line. “It’s what we do.” He was not the monster that Blue’s propaganda machine said.
“Woah, woah! Wait a second, Mr. Stark, I’m not one of those green aliens. They are webbed down there in the back,” the kid – he was evidently a kid for some reason – blurted out. “I’m just your friendly neighborhood-”
, Tony thought. His heart was beating so loudly. God help him, this kid- “Hear me out, Pete. Don’t ever – ever! – let someone influence your opinion. Not even
A flash of blinding light and they went all flying. Vision managed to go intangible just in time, Tony cracked his head through the wall tunnel, and Spider-Man was splattered with the shallow water, coughing and moaning.
” Rhodey took a deep breath, pinching the bridge between his eyes. “Okay. Two Tony Starks. Okay” he whispered.
“Everyone who had contact with other universes already did it. Welcome to the club.” Tony announced.
Rhodes was struck dumb in front of another Tony Stark. “Uh- T, do you have a cousin or something you never told me about? Because I swear to God if this is your evil twin-”
Tony looked at his counterpart, but Stark’s expression was dark and stony, his eyes averted. “You don’t have anything to say?”
The glass sloshed when he got suddenly up and hugged the android. Vision didn’t react badly but didn’t reciprocate either.  He gently put a hand on his back, though.
Tony sagged on a stool and opened the last drawer on his left. There was a bottle of scotch there and underneath a folded sheet of paper. He took the bottle, poured a healthy dose in a cup of stale coffee and closed the drawer. Swallowed a mouthful and opened the drawer again. Tony gripped the letter and unfolded it. By now, he could recite the content without even looking at it, but he read it one more time. Just to look at the handwriting, maybe.
“We are holding them in a Hulk-proofed cell here, for the moment. A certain Captain proved the Raft isn’t all that secure after all, so we don’t have a better location right now,” Tony replied sipping from his cup, utterly unconcerned.
“Don’t take this wrong, Mr. Stark, but- I’m not all that sure that I like the other you.” He admitted. “He said something to me yesterday. And... I get that he’s probably trying to protect me but- but we are
Stark suited up while the others trailed in. Rogers was in full Captain America costume too. Vision, Rhodey, and Peter escorted in the two shackled and unconscious Skrulls. Other than that, they were just there to say goodbye. The President hugged Rhodey first; then a compliant Vision; but when he stopped in front of Peter, he hesitated. “Can I?” he asked quietly like he was expecting a no for an answer. Spider-Man’s only reply was to open his arms in invitation. Stark almost lifted him off the floor. “I should have suit up later.” He realized. “Can I keep you?”
“I don’t get it.” Peter admitted, jumping up and sitting on the worktable, legs dangling. “I thought you were from the universe closest to ours and that was why you fell here. But you are like- billions of light-years away!” He exclaimed.
“Of course Vision can make jokes, he has JARVIS’ memories.” Stark snorted. “And he was a very sassy fella, let me tell you.”
Still, Steve kept silent for awhile, long enough for him to finish changing. Tony, hands on his hips, raised an eyebrow in a mute question. That seemed to work.
Okay, now Tony was really jealous. Also kind of scared. How was he going to contain this man if he went rogue?
Tony was astonished. He never thought he would ever hear Steve Rogers talking about murder so casually. “Do you kill every alien coming down to your Earth? What about Asgardians? What about people like Loki? Thor?”
“Completely spaced out? Yes.” At Rogers’ voice, his heart stopped, then started beating wildly. Like something jump-started it. “How long have you been here?”
“I understand. Or at least… I can see why you did it.” He never thought Steve wasn’t a hero. A stubborn jackass, maybe. But Steve Rogers could never be something other than a hero.
Stark raised an eyebrow, impressed. The General stared Tony down, towering over him. He clearly didn’t have any intention to back off. But didn’t managed to reply.
When he left the workshop with Peter in his arms, Rogers didn’t stop looking in their direction, faced closed up and somewhat sad. It was a look Tony saw too many times on Steve’s face, the look of someone who saw his past, his home, his life, trailing away in front of him and could do nothing about it.
“No, but Cap could recount one of his war stories. That could put anyone right to sleep,” Stark whispered, smiling at the super-soldier.
Tony thought briefly if it would be better keep changing or put back up the under-armor, but ultimately decide against it. It was nothing Rogers hadn’t seen before, thanks to one villain or another. “Come in” he called.
But… fuck, that seemed so real. He felt every punch, every kiss, every heartbreaking second of it. Six years. Six years of a superheroes’ Civil War.
He thought of Steve’s smile welcoming him home after a long meeting. Clint and Pietro bickering on the sofa. Reading stories to Cassie before bedtime… It was all gone, another life. Tony shook his head. “You could still have it. You age so slowly- and any woman would be happy to call you their husband. It’s not too late.”
“Uh- yeah,” Peter said distractedly. He was checking the progress like a good little scientist. “Sorry, didn’t mean to fall asleep on you last night.”
Stark smiled, the blue light from the hologram reflected on his glasses and made his hair turquoise. “I once created a crude time machine from scraps of my armor. Well- Doom gave me a hand and some spare parts of his own, or we would both be still stranded in Camelot, but you get the point…”
The cell phone was there in the drawer beside the bed. He never used it. Never even turned it on. Never thought of doing it. Until now.
“Sorry.” He couldn’t actually see Steve shut off, but could hear it in his voice. He was closing up, distancing himself.
The lab at the compound wasn’t nice or flashy like the one in the Tower. It still felt new, unfamiliar. But it contained everything Tony could possibly need, so it had to do. There was someone keeping him company, he knew. Peter, until Happy took him back to Aunt May for the night. Rhodey, at some point. Vision helped him for several hours, but eventually, he had to go recharge too. And Friday. Of course, there was always Friday. For the entirety of the day, he’d never been truly alone.
“Do I really look like that?” the voice startled him. It was so fucking strange to hear his own voice when he wasn’t talking.
“I thought you would be thirsty,” Vision said in a voice he never heard before. But it was Vision. The first Vision, not the Young Avenger kid.
“I will repulsor you all the way back to your Earth.” Said Tony casually, and Peter laughed, then doubled over when Stark let him go and pouted.
Tony looked down at his naked feet. He wasn’t expecting that, didn’t know what to say. ‘Nice of you to notice’ wasn’t right. ‘I missed you’ wasn’t enough.
Tony wasn’t certain how much time had passed since Vision left. It felt like five minutes, but it probably was a lot more because light was filtering through the shades. He didn’t turned around when the door whooshed open. Friday probably did announce someone was coming, but Tony wasn’t listening.
Stark patted his shoulder. “Take care of your family.” He said, on a more serious note. “Never give up on them.”
Steve opened the door, then saw his state of (un)dress and came rapidly in, shutting it behind himself. “Hey,” said with his shoulders against the door.
The sheet rustled between his legs. Outside the windows, the New York skyline glittered like Christmas lights. What the hell was
...” he whispered, voice almost inaudible. “I should have- I should have seen it coming. Veranke- everything-”
“I’ll have to take away your suit, at least for now. Hope you understand.” Tony announced to his white haired counterpart, once at the compound. “It’ll be safe in the lab. I even promise that I will not tinker with it outside of your presence.”
“I brought you something,” Stark said, and Tony immediately snatched the cup from his hand and gulped down a good quarter of it.
“We could call Strange,” Rogers said. Tony wasn’t sure why he was still there. He couldn’t help in any significant way; he wasn’t a scientist after all.
“It doesn’t matter. The only important thing is that we have a way back.” Tony reminded them. “Put on your red shoes and click your heals, Cap. We are going home.”
“Then talk,” conceded Stark, while buttoning the shirt. At least they were looking at each other, now.
” Rogers admitted, lips thinned in a line. “But… he wasn’t lucky like me when he woke up from the ice.” He stressed, like that was relevant, like it could explain it all. “He woke up alone, Tony. He didn’t have you, didn’t had the Avengers… For that, I pity him.”
Tony shook his head to clear his vision. The readings inside the mask were all trembling and stuttering, not helping with the vertigos. When the visual returned clear, he blinked twice or ten times.
They worked in the lab all day. Between him and his counterpart, and some fresh thinking from Peter, the work proceeded rapidly, and the time flew by. They tackled the problem head on; but no matter what variables they changed, the simulation kept collapsing on itself.
“… Stark and Rogers tacked you in.” Yeah, Tony saw them. He checked on them through Friday because- well his counterpart was a tad too affectionate with Peter, borderline flirty and- yeah, he was Tony Stark, he flirted like he breathed, it wasn’t serious, but still Tony didn’t like it around a
“Friday, please give me Earth-32323.” Steve asked. The hologram enlightened the way with a gold line, traveling swiftly from the world above them to the one required. And their Earth shone brighter for a second. “Home…” the General said.
Vision gave them the rest of the tour. Explained about Friday and showed them to their rooms. The one assigned to him was common, almost spartan. As much as any room designed by a Stark could be spartan, anyway. That meant a bed, a wardrobe, a desk, and any kind of tech you could possibly need. In front of the wardrobe already hung a suit, probably one of his counterpart’s. Tony put a hand through his white hair. He felt naked without the armor especially in an unknown place like this. But, well… he guessed a suit was better than going around in the skintight onesie. Just another kind of armor.
Tony brought his eyes back to Peter, to his hair curling on the pillow. “That’s right. You always wanted kids, a wife.”
“The space tissue is worn-out,” Stark said frustrated, fingers through his white hair, glasses perched on the tip of his nose. “If we try to open it like this-”
- for almost two years,” Tony stressed and, so close, he watched comprehension downing in those piercing, hackingly beautiful blue eyes.
A moan made them all look down. Steve was waking up. Peter and this universe’s Stark prudently took a step back. Tony had no idea what kind of reaction Rogers would have to seeing him there – just an hour ago they were still enemies – but it was better than letting him see two copies of his friends. So he put a hand on his chest and bent down to occupy his entire field of vision.
It wasn’t the type of place Steve would have picked, but, even so, dinner turned out to be a nice enough affair. Steve gave most of the credit to Tony for that; he kept the conversation light and fresh, drawing everyone’s attention in, laughing and carrying on as if there wasn’t a care in the world outside of their table. Hell, if Steve hadn’t known better, he would have thought that they had all been good friends for years upon years.
Steve stumbled over his words, would have stopped dancing completely if it weren’t for Tony subtly stomping on his foot, mumbling for him to keep moving. “What?”
Steve’s body sagged against a turned over truck, taking a few moments to take the pressure off of his injured leg. “We need a plan, we need—“
Also, I'd just like to say that the next chapter definitely has a kiss in it. Prepare yourselves for some action. Finally.
He cleared his throat and the others fell silent. "I'm sorry for my behavior lately. I've been trying to.." his eyes shot to Tony for a very brief and distracted moment, "...figure certain things out for myself and I just needed…" he trailed off, hoping they understood.
The weeks after the breakup, Tony had been reclusive. He kept to himself, his lab, and nobody saw much of him unless there was an emergency. It had got to the point where even Steve was beginning to wonder if he should try his luck and find Tony. He was a few days away from doing just that when Tony had shown back up, completely himself.
Everything stopped then. It seemed the very world had somehow paused for that one silent moment.  Then the droids shifted, their attention turned to Tony and Tony alone. Hulk roared, and with that the droids seemed to snap back to life, all taking off at once heading toward Tony at alarming speeds.
He's not sure how long he actually spends moving his eyes to and from Tony, just that the last time he does it Tony is looking back, head tilted to the side.
Steve’s instinct was to smile and maybe call Tony over, but he held back and tried instead to focus on the plates. Just because he wasn’t looking didn’t mean he couldn’t hear though. He heard Tony calling out his greetings and subsequently getting kicked out of the kitchen before joining Thor and Clint in front of the TV. He listened as Tony laughed and called out advice to the both of them that seemed to end in victory for Clint judging by his whoop of success.
Clint flapped his hand and scrunched up his face “oh, no. Steve, don’t. We know, okay? We’re your team, we got your back no matter what.”
If he did, if he accepted his thoughts for what he knew they were, and of course he knew, it would make him…not gay, but definitely not as straight as he had previously believed either.
Of course, they were saved. Steve woke up in a hospital bed a few hours later, hooked up to machines and staring at an unfortunately familiar, bland white ceiling.
Tony sniffed slightly, his mouth moved open and closed in tiny abortive motions but he stayed soundly asleep. Steve found himself distracted by the sheer amount of cute he just witnessed. “I—okay then.”
Tony barreled on, “I can’t promise you that it won’t come to a fight, and I can’t promise that if things look like they’re getting out of hand, I won’t shut them down by any means. But, just trust me. I won’t do any of that until I need to.” He met Steve’s with a quick jerk of his head, eyes wild and pleading, “I’ll do whatever needs to be done to get you out of here safely.”
Steve nodded, tested out his limbs and received a sharp pain that tore through his left shoulder and shot straight down his arm. Dislocated, he’d know the feeling anywhere. He grimaced as he braced his arm at his side, he’d have to have it popped back into place soon. That was sure to be unpleasant. “Think you can swing by and pick me up?”
“Did somebody say nachos” Please tell me somebody said nachos. I haven’t eaten anything but what Dum-E brought me and I’m almost positive that it wasn’t actually supposed to be edible. Dum-E’s not a very good cook.”
Her harried voice cut in immediately “already tried, nothings working. We can’t get her even a foot off the ground.”
Tony set Steve down in and empty corridor, though Steve doubted it would stay empty for long. “What are we—Iron Man, we need to—“ Steve cut himself off when he saw the device Tony produced from god knew where.
His mind was put at ease when Tony made a noise from somewhere in the back of his throat, parted his mouth with a small exhale and gripped the collar of Steve’s dress shirt tightly in his hand, tugging Steve in harder, more insistent.
They started off talking about Peggy. Sharon told him about how it was Peggy who inspired her to join SHIELD, one of the best decisions she had made in her entire life. She told him about the tales Peggy used to tell her as a kid and got Steve to tell some of his own.
Tony nodded, lips twitching up, “right, just to be sure. Well—“ he pulled up the image of a building, not very big, but modern. “This is Bohlen Incorporated, run by founder and CEO Mattias Bohlen. See, Mattias came to me awhile back, business prospect, showed me some specs his company was working on, mostly specializing in clean energy and water filtration. Really interesting things they were proposing, so I said we’d get back, and we’ve been in contact since then in an attempt to speed up research and development.”
Steve’s lip twitched at the corner. He looked back up at everyone else “If that’s all here, I think I’ll be heading out.” He received a chorus of quiet goodbyes as he turned to walk out, Tony trailing behind him. Steve was almost to the door when he was stopped by a small hand on his arm. He looked down at the blonde agent. “Yes? Agent...13?”
Steve slumped into his seat and willed himself to pay attention as Tony talked and pointed and gestured at all the displays he had brought up. Steve wanted to listen, he did, but after realizing that there was no immediate threat around, he’d found himself unable to focus much passed thinking about how he’d love to get back to his bed.
He pushed through though. He pushed through the pain and drew snippets of his past until the future, his new life, began to sneak in.
Tony shrugged “As well as can be expected.” He kept working on his phone, eyes narrowing as the minutes ticked by. Tony paused and turned his narrowed eyes to Steve “You’re fine, right? You did go to medical when you got back didn’t you? You’re not actually internally bleeding as we speak right?”
Steve let himself relax and get absorbed in the conversation that erupted. He missed being out there with everyone. For the rest of the evening he stayed chatting until the others started to drift off to their room to sleep and he decided to do the same.
Under different circumstances, Steve could even see himself eventually getting along fairly well with Mattias who gave as good as he got, with a laugh that was so boisterous, Steve found it hard not to join in.
He opened her door for her, and accepted the kiss she gave him with a promise to call tomorrow. He made himself stand there heavy hearted, as her car disappeared out of his sight. He stood out there until it was long gone, and took the time to pull himself back together and head inside.
His hand flexed on Tony’s back involuntarily for a moment before he caught it. He resolutely squared his shoulders, looked back at Mattias and then lied through his teeth, “We had a lovely day, I hope we get the chance to meet again sometime.”
It took one look from Tony, one glance in his direction and Tony knew. He’d start talking, babbling really, about what he was working on. Sometimes he’d stop working all together and try to distract Steve some other way. They’d work on one of his many cars, go out to eat, or watching bad TV until one or both of them fell asleep. Tony just, he got it. He knew how it felt to feel the air sucked out of a room, to doubt that you’d ever be okay again when in that moment everything felt like it was pressing in way too tight.
Steve’s body went ram rod straight, hand pressing his communicator to his ear “You have an order. Stand down.” Tony stopped in mid-air, hovering in place. Steve let his shoulders sag, satisfied that Tony had listened. He should have known better than to let his guard down so quickly.
“The movie, I mean, it doesn’t seem like much. It was just a movie, so insignificant. I could have chosen the other one, just to make her happy, I was going to and then he walked in and it wasn’t her anymore. It was him, it always is and maybe it always will be. I’m going to choose him over and over and eventually she will see it too and that isn’t fair to her. She deserves to come first and—“ he sucked in a harsh breath, “I’m going to end up hurting her no matter what I do.”
It wasn’t until halfway there that Tony opened his eyes and looked around blearily “Why am I moving?"
Steve berated himself for his slip up all the way up until he got inside of the debriefing room. The others were already there, which gave Steve the opportunity to sit as far away from Tony as possible. Not that it made much of a difference when Tony kept trying to catch his eye every other moment.
When Steve was back on the ground, he leaned heavily back against a crumbling structure, unsure of whether or not he had the energy to even attempt an offer to help the other agents. He definitely couldn’t with his shoulder still throbbing at his side.
Up there he feels like he can breath, he can lean against the railing and look out at the city below that's so full of people that its impossible to feel alone even in the dead of night.
“What is it? What’s going on” Steve watched, tried to hear past the thumping in his ear. Was that him? He couldn’t tell, mind focused on one thing and one thing only as Thor continued to swing his way through the thick of it.
Tony walked right past Steve to the coffee pot where he managed to pour himself a cup, immediately bringing it to his mouth to drink.
"Tony." Fell like a whisper in the dark. Way too soft. Steve needed to reel it in. Tony needed to stop rubbing his thumb over his collar bone.
Steve grabbed his shield, ran out followed closely by the others. He turned towards the sky “what have we got Iron Man?”
He breathed a barely audible sigh of relief when Tony’s voice filtered through his communicator, breathless, but whole. “Everything’s good on my end.” He paused, irritation perceptible in his tone, “SHIELD jut arrived on site. Late to the party as usual; Though I guess they did manage to get Mattias and company taken care of, so they get points for that.”
Tony rolled his eyes "That's for Dum-E. He tries, he does, and I can't let him see me spit out his drink every time. Think of it as team morale."
Tony’s nose wrinkled “we’ll think of something.” He walked back towards Steve “Take the rest of the day off Happy, I have the suit. I’ll fly home.”
I thought it was getting better, I thought I was doing enough but all I’ve been doing is running and it caught up to me.” Steve picked more of the fabric of his jeans, “There’s you and there is Tony and I’m not sure of what I’m doing or what I need to do. The only thing I know for certain is that I’m in love with him and you deserve so much more than me. You deserve to be the beginning and the end of some lucky guys’ world and I can’t give that to you and I wish I could but I can’t and I’m sorry.”
The air must have picked up the turning tide, madness erupting all around. It was a never ending stream of screaming people, shots in the air, the Hulks roar, and then a constant murmuring coming from his communicator.
Steve was in the kitchen making himself breakfast after his morning run. The tower was empty with Clint and Natasha called away a few days previous by SHIELD for some operation that fell under the label of ‘classified’, Thor likewise occupied doing whatever it was he did when he went home to Asgard, and Bruce having taken the weekend off for a personal retreat that Steve guessed might have actually been a visit to a woman named Betty judging by the phone conversation he had accidentally overheard.
Steve did as he was told, shuffling his feet until he picked up a rhythm they could both follow. His breath faltered, heart picking up significantly, when Tony’s chin fell to rest on his shoulder. He hoped fervently that Tony didn’t notice, didn’t hear or feel his erratic pulse.
Steve scratched at the denim over his knee, a nervous twitch, but kept his eyes steady, directly on her. “I really like you Sharon. You are one of the best people I’ve met since waking up here and I don’t ever want you hurt in any way but I know if we stay together I—“
Steve could do that, it was pitifully hilarious how well Steve could do that. He nodded, a lump in his throat, he could do it easily.
Steve closed his eyes , let his his head fall back until it knocked against a particularly jagged piece of rock. He winced in pain and decided it was probably best if he just waited till Tony was done directing the SHIELD agents on what to grab and what to dispose of, giving precise instructions to the unit lead, Agent Dalton. Steve liked Agent Dalton, he was efficient and made amazing apple tarts.
Steve narrowed his eyes and cleared his head of everything before it began to spiral in a direction he didn’t want to go..
JARVIS's voice chimed in around him. "Captain Rogers, Sir has requested that I ask after your wellbeing."
Steve rolls his eyes and moves to stand up, stretching out his limbs. He offers his hand to Tony who stares at it for a moment before allowing Steve to haul him up. They both stand there, in a silence reminiscent of the one that they shared at the beginning of the night. The sun rises slowly and with it the sound of people milling around on the streets below grows louder and louder. "Thank you"
They stared each other down for moments that seemed to stretch into forever, the sound of the water crashing on the shore just behind them. Steve knew that the others were there, Thor, Natasha, Bruce and Clint, all holding back, waiting to intervene if needed.
Steve looked away from Tony, focused on a point over Tony’s shoulder trying to get the white to recede. “If that’s what it takes to get it through your head, then yes.”
. The lights flashed red in warning all around them and Clint’s hand dug in painfully. “He’ll be fine, Steve. He’s strong. Stronger than people give him credit for.”
“Before we met, I’d felt this thing, insistently and all the time. I’d been attracted to him and I didn’t want to be and then I met you. You are gorgeous and strong willed and when I was with you I was happy, I wasn’t worried about Tony or anything but the way I felt when you were around. And then you kissed me and I thought, ‘yeah, this could work. This is what I needed.’
It ended far too soon, Tony pulling back flushed and breathing harshly, his lips puffy and spit slick. Steve felted jilted, uncomprehending; he’d done that, he’d been kissing Tony, and then he wasn’t. He wanted to still be kissing Tony, found his mouth chasing after Tony’s retreating face without much more than that one thought. He only stopped at the feel of a hand on his chest, looked up to meet Tony’s half cast eyes.
He took a deep breath and placed his palms on the table in front of him. Sharon starred off to the side, the wind pushing her hair out from its place, tucked behind her ear. Steve wanted to tuck it back but he knew that he didn’t have that right anymore.
Sharon tucked her own hair back into place, leaned forward on her elbows. “I am going to need time, but I’ll try. I don’t—well, I do, but I don’t really—what I’m trying to say is, I’m going to try not to hold a grudge.” She shook her head, amused “If you were any other guy Steve Rogers, I’d tell you to get lost and storm away, but you’re not. You’re Captain America and you had the balls to tell me the truth, so for that, I’m not going to hold a grudge because Tony—“ her face went sour for just a moment before she managed to clear it again. “Tony sounds like he’s the beginning and end of your world and maybe I do want that but if I can’t have it with you then, well, I’m glad you have it with someone.”
Tony nodded his head, sure with the plan he had yet to let Steve in on, “she told me once, public displays make people uncomfortable” Tony grinned smugly, “turned out to be one of the top ten missions I’ve ever been on—Don’t tell Nat I told you though.”
It was the sound of old gears spinning, working restlessly even when they just didn’t have it in them to turn anymore. They tried though, they tried and it was sad and pathetic and all Steve could think was that they should give up.
Steve’s stomach lurched, the hand on the spoon he was using to mix tightened. He said in a strained voice “right. I’m sure he’ll be out any minute.” It was rude, he knew that he had effectively dismissed her but he also knew that there was no way he could make pleasant conversation when everything in him was suddenly hissing and whirling.
and Steve couldn’t stop the frustrated tears burning his eyes. He swiped at them roughly, his eyes focusing on the ceiling above him in an attempt to ebb the flow. He only glanced down when he heard Clint, sitting with his knees held loose against his chest, suck in a rough breath and sniffle in a way that was not at all subtle.
He could see the explosions behind his eyes, bright white lights flickering, flickering and then they stopped, and the world went dark. All he could hear was a scream echoing over and over, ripping into his gut like a knife until even it faded away leaving nothing but a long high pitched whine.
He and Tony being together were up there though; it was something so far-fetched that it caught him completely off guard when it crossed his mind.
Natasha lips thinned “I don’t think that can be classified as ‘fine’ Steve. You need to talk to someone.”
Steve wanted to go back to a few weeks ago when none of this was happening. He’d even take going back to when it was happening but he was blissfully unaware of it. Back to a time when he could go down to Tony’s lab and drag him out to grab a bite to eat and laugh about pointless things. When he could sit and listen to Tony talk about anything and everything with a smile on his face and a shake of his head when Tony got ridiculous. He wanted to go to movie night and sit on the couch squished close to Tony and feel contentedness instead of the worry that Tony could somehow see all the ways Steve had been thinking about him. He wanted to argue over the remote and debate politics and fly down to battle at Tony’s side. He wanted it all back and it was a real fear that he wouldn’t get any of that ever again.
Steve sniffed, snot and blood and tears that tasted like salt water, “It’s the red, white and blue. It creates the illusion of apple pie and unquestioning patriotism.”
The droids came in faster, hit harder. Steve took a shot to the thigh, a steady stream of blood flowing out of the wound. He heard Clint give a muffled ‘fuck’ followed close by Natasha’s low hiss of pain. Hulk was still going strong, though his enraged yells only got louder and more frequent as the droids learned to weave and dodge from his grasp.
When an hour and a half had passed by without any luck, Steve allowed himself to be pulled from the water by Clint and Natasha, his hope dangling by a thread.
Sharon leaned heavily into Steve’s side and Tony’s arm was thrown casually over the back of the couch. Steve closed his eyes and wished he was any other place in the world at that moment because right then, he felt like the shittiest person in the entire world.
He loved Tony. He loved him and that was okay. It was—it was good. He wasn’t exactly sure what he should do with that information other than what he needed to do. He needed to let Sharon down as gently as possible. After that was done—after that, Steve would just take it one day at a time.
The fight leaves his body and his eyes fall shut. This is it, he's dead. He's dead, he's dead, he should be dead.
It was a forced detox of sorts and he almost managed to convince himself that it was working; all the way up until the day Tony came home.
Steve didn’t know how much he could have before it would become too much, how much he could take without crumbling when it was over.
Tony rolled his eyes, more exaggerated than absolutely necessary, Steve thought. “Sweden, Solna to be exact. Just to make sure, how much did you not hear?”
The team had been called to stop rampaging lizards from attacking the city as soon as the creatures had slithered their way up from the manhole covers. They were surprisingly fast things, with scales that were hard and sharp. It took longer than Steve thought it would but eventually the streets were declared secure and he was able to take a moment to catch his breath.
Steve shook his head at his back fondly, relished in the swirling, tumbling, twisting sensation that washed through him. He wanted to move forward, to wrap his arms around Tony’s waist and burry his face in the juncture where his neck met his shoulder. He found himself actually taking one step before he managed to halt his movements
He jumped slightly when a cool, heavy hand fell on his shoulder, “looking a little shaky there Cap.”
Steve felt suddenly warm all over and had to make a surprisingly conscious effort not to coo like he’d heard some dames do over a soldier talking about their children back home. It was adorable; the way Tony treated his creations. Adorable and maybe sometimes creepy in the almost obsession he had, but that was Tony. He cared about his tech, his family. It was there in the sleek curves of the Iron Man armors and in the way he spoke to JARVIS, Dum-E, Butterfingers and U. It was there in the way he got personally offended if someone said anything negative to or about one of them. You could tell right away, just by hearing Tony when he talked about them. Tony had given them life and it still amazed Steve. "I'm sure he appreciates it."
“Nothing, It’s fine, it’s—“ There was a scream then, a blood curdling shout as the suit plummeted through the sky. Steve could do nothing but watch horrified as it was dragged down, splashing into the water.
Steve’s breathing came in pants, erratic as his hands gripped the fabric of his jeans. He needed to ground himself.
Natasha was in the med bay with a shoulder wound she had received on day five of the mission and Steve almost wished his wounds hadn’t healed so fast so he could be in the med bay too on one of those not-so-comfy-but-adequate beds. No, instead he was told to wait in one of the many conference rooms for debrief, keeping his head up only from the support of his hand.
It was another ten, fifteen minutes before Tony made his way back to Steve’s side, and then Steve found himself being led firmly, by his good shoulder, to a waiting Quinjet.
Steve took a breath, caught Tony’s reflection walking toward him in the glass in front of him, Mattias trailing slightly behind him.
There was an annual function hosted by Stark Industries that mostly involved everyone who was anyone in the business world making new connections with a side order of good entertainment and food. Pepper had insisted that Tony show up to actually give his speech this year, which only meant that Tony had insisted that the rest of the Avengers also attend. He’d actually made it a condition for his arrival which meant everyone had Pepper on them in a matter of minutes.
“You heard me. They are too dangerous. Let them live, and eventually they will find a way to break out and contact their home planet, and then, the entire Skrull Empire will be upon you. And believe me, you are not ready for that.”
A glass of water appeared in his visual field. Tony stared at the red hand; and then, his eyes came up to the green sleeve. His heart almost stopped again.
Tony turned his gaze away, his chest hollow. Then shrugged again. “You did that. I only gave you a room and some clothes.”
“It had to go somewhere.” Stark confirmed. “I think the tissue of the universe was already unstable for some reason, and the bomb cracked it. You two were probably stuck between universes, and when I came closer-”
“Well, that helped too. I mean- I could have gone around in my birthday suit, but Rhodey would probably have been scarred for life.” Stark said, lightening the mode.
“He was afraid.” Rogers said. Tony scoffed, but the soldier didn’t relent. “He had already lost Bucky. He was afraid of losing you, too. And because of that, he actually lost you both.” He clarified then. “He’s
The were four more people in the tunnel. Two very green, very ugly aliens, one star-spangled man, and another armored hero – all unconscious.
“Why are you still here?” the genius snapped, startling him. “You stayed here all day when it wasn’t necessary, and
Six fucking years. Compared to that, their Civil War was like a kindergarten squabble. And Bucky Barnes – even a
He reached behind the neck to pull down the zipper, got naked and took a shower in the adjacent bathroom, removing the sweat and grime left by the battle and bomb blast. He was wrapping a towel around his hips when a discreet knock came to the door. “Who’s there, Friday?”
Cap looked up, searching his gaze. Tony could barely see the blue of his eyes in the darkness. Steve seemed-
” Stark whispered, and in the blink of an eye was right beside Rhodey, helping him stand. “What happened to you?”
” Tony informed him before leaving him more space to breathe. “It seems we are in another universe.”
Tony froze. “O- Of course not. Sorry. It’s just- it’s been a long time,” he mumbled, taking a step back.
“That’s actually kind of funny. I dreamed about you. The whole thing since Miriam Sharpe died, every night for about a week, over and over again,” he revealed. “I saw it like I actually was you and- and it was just- too real. That’s when I began to understand it had to be another universe. Then, we found the tear in space. My theory is-”
“It’s okay, you need your beauty sleep,” the genius answered, changing something on the screen. Then he finally looked Peter in the eyes. “Did you have breakfast?”
Rogers fixed it on his back. “It was nice to meet you again.” He said, shaking hands with the others. Then, he turned the full power of his piercing blue eyes on Tony. Their gaze met, and he felt the same sparkling electricity in the air that he always got with the Captain he was used to. He almost expected Rogers to start a new fight.
They were transported out, helped by Tony, Reed and Bruce, all working against the clock to save them when the alarms sounded that Clint and Steve were in trouble. It was only the sudden appearance of Stephan Strange that pulled it all together; ‘with magic’ (Tony explained that part with an eye roll and wiggly fingers). Clint sustained a couple burns, a few broken bones and woke up an hour earlier. Steve got the same plus some, but the serum had already worked overtime to heal him of most of it.
Steve planted his hands firmly on his thighs, forced himself to smile good naturedly, “no Tony, go on.” It wasn’t what he wanted to say, of course it wasn’t, Steve never said what he wanted to say in these situations, only what was expected.
Steve closed his eyes momentarily. She was right. Natasha was always right. He told her as much, nudging her shoulder gently with the palm of his hand.
That first day, he tried to ignore it completely. He'd trailed out of his room after laying in silence on his bed for a few hours and went to see what the others were up to.
It wasn’t Steve’s idea of the best way to spend his night, forced into a tux that was admittedly well fitted thanks to Tony’s tailor, but still made him feel like a monkey in a suit. The mingling, the wining and dining with all these strangers, it wasn’t really him. He faked it as good as anyone though, for Tony’s sake, and for team image.
When he got back to his own room, Steve opened his drawer and pulled out the drawing book, the one full of all the different versions of Tony and turned to an empty page. He grabbed a pen and started to make a list.
“No! No, Sharon. He doesn’t even know that I feel this way. I haven’t, I wouldn’t cheat on you. Not like that. Tony…” Steve paused to scratch the nape of his neck.
Tony squatted in front of Steve, between his spread legs, using Steve’s thigh to steady himself. Steve inhaled deeply through his nose as Tony reached a tentative hand up, checking his eyes first. “I think you might have a slight concussion.” He tapped a finger along Steve’s temple, causing Steve’s next breath to come out as a hiss when it hit the tender area. “you got hit pretty hard judging by this gash here—you know, this is exactly why I tell you to leave the helmet on.”
He tried his best at a reassuring grin but, judging by the way Tony's frown just deepened, Steve had failed miserably. He picked up his book and let his face fall to what he hoped was a more neutral expression. "I'm fine. I just remembered that I have to go do a…thing." Before Tony could ask, Steve made a beeline for the door. "I'll see you later."
'. Tony's welder stopped and he turned to Steve "What are you-" He cut himself off and frowned, making a circling gesture around his face "What's with the look?"
All Steve knew for sure was that he was on borrowed time and that eventually he’d have to rejoin the land of the living. His solitude couldn’t last forever, and it didn’t.
A few months after waking up from the ice, Steve had found a little art shop tucked quietly away between a busy Chinese restaurant and a dingy coffee shop that continuously pumped out strange music that for some reason included a lot of what sounded like flutes and drums. The shop keeper had been weathered with age, with a smile that set off the creases at her eyes. Eyes that had somehow managed to convince Steve to load up an entire basket full of all the ‘must haves’. He’d walked away with a few moleskin sketchbooks, pencils, erasers, pens and a promise made to come back soon.
There were other times too, times in between all the doubt where he found the words pressed between his lips. He’d be sitting with Tony, who was half way through a long rambling explanation for how this or that thing worked and why it was so very important and Steve would listen closely, understanding maybe one third of what Tony was saying, with what he knew was an idiotic grin plastered on his face. He couldn’t help it, couldn’t help the warmth that spread through him, didn’t care that he never really understood or held much interest in all the technology Tony tried to explain to him in detail. Him listening, it was about the way Tony was genuinely interested, the way his eyes wandered around, hands jerking and tapping, narrating everything. It was about the way Tony took the time to break it all down, how he shot Steve quick smiles when Steve would catch on to something and ask a question. Steve loved seeing Tony in his element, loved being allowed to be a part of it for those moments and when he sat there listening, the most prevalent thought running through his head was ‘I love you, how do you not know I love you’. He never said it though, kept it held tight within him, but in those moments he almost thought he could.
Steve felt his heart beating erratically in his chest and he was hit with an amazed feeling at how he could have mistaken this feeling for anything else.
Steve laughed again, quieter this time, before letting it trickle into a comfortable silence that they both settled into, he really had been tired before, more now with this new idea.
Tony moved his hand away and smirked across the table. "Don't be jealous Barton. I'm sure Nat will have Hallmark moments with you if you just ask."
Thor let out a hefty sigh and got in the elevator, “Nay, friend Steven. It is time for you to rejoin us and be merry again.”
The war was there too. Not the battles, living through them once was enough, but the people he had met along the way to becoming Captain America. He’d drawn Dr. Erskine and Howard, Colonel Phillips and all of the Howling Commandos. He’d sketched Peggy. Peggy standing tall and strong among a sea of soldiers and Peggy standing just as tall and strong in the center of a dance hall. It hurt like a wound that was still attempting to scar over the first few times he’d finished a picture, it tugged at his heart to have everyone smiling out at him from the pages when he knew that that wasn’t how he’d left any of them.
Steve didn’t turn back around to face Tony, kept his shoulders squared as he paused in his stride “Just—don’t talk to me for awhile. I can’t—“ he started walking again, voice tight “I can’t deal with you right now.”
It was such a simple gesture, and it might have been the concussion talking, but Steve, brow furrowed in confusion, found himself suddenly considering that it might not be.
Steve knew it would happen. He knew that something would take place and expose everything he’d been keeping well under wraps, every secret thought, every bit of longing he’d felt. It had always been just a matter of time, and, no matter how much he’d taken, lately, to entertaining the thought that everything would remain the same, that Tony would still look at him with warm eyes and call him Winghead as if nothing had changed between them, he understood that that was most likely nothing more than an idle wish, a pipe dream.
The others had teased him about it, about Sharon being his girlfriend but he never actually considered it as anything more than friendly ribbing.
He’d wanted to see Tony smile at him, for Tony to keep his hand on his knee. He’d just wanted to make Tony happy and he
Steve felt his eyes droop as Tony’s nimble fingers ran over his scalp, making their way to the back of his neck where he squeezed once.
Tony gave an exaggerated shrug and shook his head “Fine Steve. They can have some if they want. Not Fury though, never Fury.”
Steve was awoken by a crash of lighting followed closely by the loud rumbling of thunder. He shot up out of bed, completely alert until he realized what it was.
There were occasions when Steve thought, maybe. Perhaps the way Tony looked at him, the fond expression on his face, could mean more. Maybe he would return Steve’s affections without hesitation, and Steve could grab him and kiss him the way he’d wanted to for too long now. Those thoughts always filled Steve with a bubbling happiness so strong that a flush would climb down his body as he bit back a ridiculous, giddy, smile that tried to break through.
Steve nodded and drew his eyebrows in, trying to find the words, “look, you were doing what had to be done. I—get that I guess. I don’t like how it had to be done, but, I get it.” Steve took a step closer, that urgency he’d felt during their argument creeping back up, “I just, you need to understand something too though. I will never be happy with any plan that involves you putting yourself at risk like that, especially not when I can’t stand by your side while it’s happening.”
“They seemed like a decent prospect, passed the background check and everything, which maybe suggests that my background checks need to be updated—point is, they’re good at hiding what they need to and I’d need a closer look, plant a bug to fish through the servers directly to be completely sure that what I think is happening, is actually happening.”
Steve told Tony the lab was ‘nice’ that day. What he hadn’t told him was that it made him feel small. He felt dwarfed by all the newness around him, like he was back to his pre-serum body. Down in the lab, Tony was larger than life, and Steve was just a guy trying to keep up. It wasn’t a particularly bad feeling though. He never had a problem with being small so much as he’d had a problem with feeling useless and even though they’d gotten off to a bad start, Tony didn’t make him feel useless.
As Steve made his way down to the kitchen, he couldn’t help but feel like it was the middle of the night. The hallways were still dark, the lights set low, just enough so that you wouldn’t accidentally bump into a wall as you stumbled sleepily to your bed. At least, that’s what he guessed Tony’s reasoning for the lighting situation was.
He wanted to touch him, just like he’d wanted to touch all the things he’d seen the first time he’d visited Tony’s lab. He looked at Tony and something in him screamed ‘new’ and ‘brilliant’ and he just needed to know how the other man would feel beneath his fingers. It surprised him how much he actually had to restrain himself from getting up and moving towards the other man.
Usually Steve would be offended but with the spark came a clarity Steve was never privy to before. Tony is kidding. This is... it’s a surprise.
He stuck to his original plan as much as possible, not actively going out to find Tony. It just seemed that wherever he went lately, Tony ended up.
It shouldn’t have bothered him so much, he knew that. It wasn’t that big of a deal, to side with Tony. It was just a movie, a stupid movie. He tried to convince himself, tried to see it that way, but he couldn’t because what it boiled down to essentially was that he had chosen Tony over Sharon.
Steve sat up straighter and set down his second slice of pizza. He nodded in greeting, giving Fury a quick “Sir”. He looked down at the remaining food and back up “Uh, there’s food if anyone wants some?”
He caught it again on his arm as Natasha’s voice filtered through, harried and a little out of breath, “It’s the droids Steve, they’re in New York. We can’t—tell me you guys figured something out on your little get away.”
Steve put one hand up to Tony’s face, rubbed his thumb lightly over his cheekbone. He squeezed his eyes shut as his lips brushed slowly, barely any pressure against Tony’s own and he paused, suddenly terrified that he’d open his eyes and everything would be wrong, Tony would jerk away and ask what Steve though he was doing.
It wasn’t all the time. Most nights that Tony left for this or that event, he would return home alone, just on the other side of inebriated. Then there were the nights where he came stumbling in, a pretty little dame attached to his side.
“Bucky, he’s gonna be pissed. He’s going to lecture my gravestone.” Steve startled himself with a sob, loud and unbidden, “Sam will have to keep him grounded. And Natasha, they’ve been getting along lately.” Another sob and he couldn’t speak, couldn’t get enough air in to form words. He didn’t want to mention Tony, he didn’t want to but he had to. He forced himself to breath, if only for a second, “Tony will—“ and he lost the thread again, lost his breath again, because Tony would fall apart and Steve wouldn’t be there to pick him back up.
Steve twisted his lips, “wouldn’t want to miss…” he trailed off as he looked over the giant serving platters at the center of the table, “nacho night.”
Clint and Natasha backed away, though not too far. They were worried, Steve could see that. He tried for a reassuring grin but it fell flat. “I’m fine. Really.”
Steve stood there for a moment, eyeing the elevator and the door before he shook his head. He wasn’t running. Steve raised his hand to the access panel and hesitated once more. He really should have thought to prepare something to say, but he hadn’t, he’d let himself be pep talked into going right away.
He isn't drowning. There is no water, there is no war, nobody is dying. He's in bed. He's at home. His home is Stark tower. He's in the future. He's safe. Over and over again until his breathing evens out and his grip on his sheets loosens.
Neither said anything for a long drawn out moment. Steve looked down, rubbed a hand over the back of his head and willed his muscles to stop tensing. “Hey”
A sob tore its way out of Steve’s chest, “I’m sor—“, Tony, lying surrounded by broken pieces of armor, ‘you should have stayed in the ice.’ And it was true. He had thought he was getting better, thought maybe—but no. Tony was right.
Tony sat back down and pulled the box of pizza towards him “For the record, I wasn’t bouncing off the walls. Happy is delusional.” He passed two wrapped burgers to Steve.
Steve realized quickly, that with the absence of Tony, he lost much of his inclination to participate in the conversation happening around him. Instead he watched the dance floor, watched as Tony wound his way through dance partners, man and woman, young and old, arms never lacking in stunning people to hang off of them. Steve couldn’t bring himself to tear his eyes away.
Iron Man, already hovering in the air, angled his body away from Steve, ready to take off at any moment. “They activated the droids stored here but they’re attacking blindly. I need to get out there.”
He breaths in the crisp night air and feels his body relax almost immediately. Steve begins the short trek forward to the edge of the roof when his eye catches movement to his right. He pauses momentarily, making his next step louder.
Point was, Steve was supposed to be alone that weekend. It made him all the more surprised when he saw Tony sluggishly making his way into the kitchen.
Steve awoke, covered in sweat, “—NO!” because he was still there, because he could still see Tony crashing into the ground.
Steve watched Tony’s tongue flicker out over his lips, suddenly heavily lidded, mouth parting in a way that had nothing to with playing his part and everything to do with remembering the feel of that tongue along his own.
Tony nodded, started to tap his fingers on the table “It was touch and go. The signal you were broadcasting was being blocked from all sides and when I finally did break through, their firewalls kept trying to push me back. If their technicians weren’t working for a criminal organization I’d consider hiring them for Stark Industries. The code work was fantastic. I’d love to figure out why they decided to use the sequencing that they did…” Tony trailed off and pulled out his phone “really, I was impressed. It wasn’t enough to keep me out of course, but they sure did put up one hell of a fight. There was this one line of – oh, huh. I wonder if…” he started to scan the numbers on his screen “Jarvis, pull up that – yeah the one that I was – yeah that one. Thanks”
Steve was giving up too much, he knew, but he couldn’t stop the flow of words anymore than he could stop his heart from beating. “Seeing you fall out of the sky, dragged under the water and unable to find you terrified me.  I’ve lost a lot of people Tony, but do not make me lose you too. I need you to be here in more or less one piece okay?”
Steve didn’t bother arguing, just nodded and walked out, up to his room to get ready and maybe catch a few hours more of sleep while he could.
“Yeah. I thought so. I shouldn’t have used it against you,” Steve conceded. “You said some pretty harsh thing too.”
Tony shrugged. “The universe closest are the most similar to one another, generated by a singular event that changed something, making them just slightly different from the one next door.” He explained. “Maybe there our counterparts are already dead; or we were too late, and the Skrulls won.  Maybe, in the next universe, there isn’t anyone who could find us... Or maybe this one was the fastest to figure it out.” He concluded, patting Stark’s back.
“Oh, that’s brilliant.” Tony agreed. “So it wouldn’t be universe to universe, but universe to alternate dimension to another universe. And put less strain on the space-tissue.
“I didn’t name the Iron after me, you know?” he said instead. “I chose that name because I wanted the nation to be
The General’s eyes met President Stark’s gaze. “Sometimes you have to accept the alternative would be worst,” he declared.
Steve felt himself sit up, vaguely felt hands rubbing his back but he couldn’t make out any other sound besides the whine of the gears. Constantly tirelessly whining until they eventually fell apart; until they were replaced with something new and better. Something much more fit for the future. It would be for the best.
There are still nights where despite everything he tries, Steve can not sleep. Nights where his memories grip him tight and refuse to let him go. He see's his men dying, he see's Bucky falling away, and he see's himself getting closer and closer to the water until, finally, he's under it all. He's choking on water and ice and no matter how hard he kicks there is no way he can break the surface.
He saw Fury's one good eye narrowing before repeating the question to him, a hint of disappointment in his voice. It wasn’t like Steve to zone out and not pay attention.
They were wrong when they thought he wouldn’t fight back, and they were wrong when they called him a ‘pansy’. To think that they’d been half right all along, to think that they’d seen something in Steve that he himself had been too blind to see, it drove him mad.
Steve’s private line crackled to life then, quiet voice making its way through “sorry Cap, but I can’t do that”
He didn’t know if it was really appropriate to explain all of this to her. He wanted her to understand though. “I can explain, but…” he trailed off.
Natasha walked further into the room and sat down next to Thor on couch. He looked around at them all, Thor with a large pizza in his lap, Clint with a beer in his hand and feet thrown over Bruce’s lap and Tony, a tumbler of scotch held loosely in one hand, the other digging into a bag of chips.
Steve’s throat was dry, scratchy. He just managed a rough, “okay”, before Tony squeezed one more time and let go.
Steve runs a hand over his face when he remembers his panic attack in bed. "I just needed to breath"
Tony Stark was without a doubt a man and for as long as Steve could remember he didn’t like men like that.
Tony shook his head, armor moving seamlessly with him, “You’ve had this,” he waved his gauntleted hand in front of his face, “look on your face for the past hour. Are you sure you’re fine?”
Steve yawed, sat up straight in his chair and then shook his head to clear it. He met Tony’s eyes for possibly the first time since he’d shown up in the room, bleary eyed, and got a bemused smile in return, “Where exactly are you going that requires the suit?”
The woman shook her head, took a breath and smiled “Good morning—You’re Steve right? Captain America.”
Steve clenched his fists at his sides, nails biting sharply into his palms. “You’re right, we risk our lives every time, but not like that. We don’t fly in blind and take chances. Your life is not an acceptable risk. Maybe to you, but not to me, and not to the rest of the team. Next time I give you an order, I suggest you take it.”
Steve gave up and turned his attention solely on the debrief and taking notes. It wasn’t odd behavior for him, and for that he was grateful. The others, beside Tony, hopefully wouldn’t read too much into it.
Tony rolled his eyes “don’t. After the week you’ve had I doubt you’ve slept, let alone eaten anything decent.”
Most nights he goes to the gym to swing at the punching bag until he doesn’t see or feel anything but the bag in front of him. His hand hovers over the button but all he feels is a bone deep tiredness that he rarely feels anymore. He cant bring himself to press the button for the gym tonight. He presses the button for the roof.
It was a losing battle filled with tomorrow after tomorrow after tomorrow. Tomorrow he wouldn't think about Tony, and Tomorrow Tony wouldn’t leave Steve helplessly trailing after him.
Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow. They came and went and every day Steve told himself that he would stay away tomorrow because today was just no good.
“You don’t have to say anything.” He paused, tilted his head “I know you’re going to need time, but before everything, you were my friend. I don’t want to lose you completely.”
Steve felt warmth everywhere, a steady thrum traveling under his skin. “I—Tony you know I’m trying to do the same thing.”
Mattias nodded his head and sipped his drink, “indeed.” He paused and leaned forward on his elbows, “I assume that you and Tony don’t actually get much alone time, what with your respective occupations.”
Natasha walked closer and looked down at Tony. Her stare lingered and all at once he both wanted to know and didn’t want to know what she was thinking. When she looked back up to Steve there was a grim smile ghosting over his lips, “you love him.”
Tony scowled, “I know, but do you think making a dash for it after talking won’t look suspicious? They weren’t born yesterday; they’ll know what’s going on if we just up and run off the second we get a minute alone. We need all the time we can get.”
He needed to be human enough to end it, so he readied himself and invited her out to lunch at one of her favorite places. He waited until she was settled and then took a deep breath to calm his raging nerves. “I need to tell you something.”
Instead Steve threw himself into any work SHIELD could come up with in an effort to push thoughts of Tony to the back of his head.
Steve frowned, mind racing, trying to come up with a plan of escape. He spoke aloud “no, Mattias thinks we’re together. He’ll think we just want some time alone.”
Steve liked Pepper. She was smart, competent, kind; she reminded him almost painfully of Peggy. It had been her who had shown him around the tower when he moved in, who had sat and ate lunch with him as they talked art. He liked her with Tony too. When she was around, Tony was always more considerate, more light hearted and at ease. Steve would watch them together sometimes, wistful for a time when he could have had what they so clearly had. He could see that Tony had loved her and that she had loved Tony too, very much.
He mustered up a teasing smirk, looped their pinkies and tugged till he got Tony’s attention, a fond smile, “So, does this make your top ten list?”
There was no doubt in Steve’s mind that Tony would one day know how Steve felt. Either Tony would find out himself and confront him on it in which case Steve would tell the truth. Or, Steve would build enough courage to tell Tony himself.
Steve frowned before he could stop himself, squeezed his eyes shut to try and focus. It was an act; they still had a job to complete.”
Steve and Tony waited, hidden in the thick of the trees, as Tony made quick work of scanning the grounds and buildings. His voice filtered out, precise and with the usual overlaying mechanical quality, just what Steve needed, “Lots of security, we need to make our way back to the main control room so that I can access the servers, scramble and delete it all. I’ve already got SHIELD in route for pickup.”
Steve didn’t understand, didn’t know how to begin understanding why Tony always did this, always found a way to save the day even at the risk of his own well being. Tony could curse Steve all he wanted, because at the end of the day Steve needed to know that if Tony wouldn’t take care of himself, Steve would.
He would have felt worse for his preoccupation if it weren’t for the fact that Clint was drooling on the table before he’d even sat down all the way down, Natasha had her face slumped on her propped up fist about five minutes in, and Bruce blinked so rapidly that Steve was almost sure that he wouldn’t be able to stop if he kept it up.
It was like Bucky all over again. Bucky falling away while Steve vanished from sight on the train, Tony being dragged down while Steve was stuck on the ground.
Tony talks and talks and at some point they both ended up sitting down on the ground, backs against the steel behind them. Tony requires very little input from Steve so when Steve feels his eyes grow heavy, he lets them rest making 'mhmm' noises and nodding his head every once in awhile to let him know that he's still listening. Eventually even that stops and the only noise is the sound of Tony's cool timber voice and Steve's slow breathing.
and Clint was laughing, clutching a hand to his side that was still trickling blood. “Shit, Cap, really?”
Steve stopped, body tensing. Every muscle in his body pulled taught. He couldn’t stand the conflicting thoughts in his head, couldn’t stand the urge to grab Tony close and not let go at the same time as pushing him as far away as possible. Steve just wanted to find a way to let him know how terrified he had felt as Tony fell screaming, let him know that he didn’t know how he would live without him, didn’t ever want to figure it out. Steve needed to get away, get away before he gave in. He pushed pass Tony “you are a self sacrificing asshole Stark.”
Steve spent the next week holed up in his quarters. He wasn’t sure how he’d actually managed to make it past even three days alone what with the people he lived with, but if he’d had to guess, he’d have to say they all must have been giving him space. Knowing that didn’t give him much relief, on the contrary, if they were giving him space it meant they knew something was wrong with him. Steve still had no idea how to explain it to them or even if he wanted to make an attempt at it.
Steve’s brow furrowed in confusion, “I’m fine Tony.” He looked over Tony’s shoulder at the bulk of the facility, guards walking dutifully along the perimeters, “We need to—“
Steve never figured out if it was a beginning or an ending. All he knew for sure was that he liked Tony a little more than he should and he had to stop it.
During the days, whenever Tony showed up, he’d stuck around just long enough to come up with a legitimate excuse to leave and then turned tail and got out of there.
“But I wasn’t! I wasn’t Steve. We risk our lives every time we do this and I –” He patted down his body “I’m still here, still whole. I ran the calculations, I knew the risks and it was worth it.”
Loving Tony became just another thing for Steve, another irrevocable fact. His hair was blonde, his mother’s name was Sarah, he fought in World War II and he loved Tony.
They're both quiet for a while again. Steve watches as Tony's foot taps listlessly against the ground, taping out some rhythm Steve can't even hope to pick up. He's focusing so much on Tony's foot that he almost doesn't catch it when Tony speaks again "You aren't going to ask why I'm up here of all places?"
It wasn’t perfect but it was good enough. He felt lighter than he had since before California, the worry finally trickling away.
Sirens blared, a warning for emergency evacuation, as they raced the halls disarming and knocking out every hostile in sight. By the time they had a moment to breath, barricaded in the stations core, Steve knew they were in a tight spot.
He tried to call out to Tony again, get his position. There was no response. For three full minutes he got no response but the static from Tony’s end. His blood rushed beneath his skin, heart pounding fast in his chest. It felt like it was trying to leap its way straight out of him “I want lookouts over the water, Clint and Natasha, see if you can get the Quinjet powered up and running, get Hulk calmed down, Bruce can fix where it was hit. I want scans of the area, quick. Thor, fly over head and see if you spot him.” Steve didn’t waste any more time. He dove in head first and hoped that the suit would remain sealed until they could find Tony and pull him out.
Steve stood stoically near the command, watching the scans work. He waited, patiently for something, anything, a blip on the screen that meant the Iron Man suit was detected.
Steve cursed himself bloody for not coming up with a reason to give before he’d shown up, some reason for him being there that actually made sense. He racked his brain, thinking of answers and possible responses, systematically deleting anything that left too much suspicion.
He almost expects a digging comment but all he gets is thoughtful silence and a considering look before Tony goes into a long rambling tale of how he's been working on a way to give his repulsors more of a kick without draining his suit of too much power too quickly. Steve listens to it all even though he understands only about fourth of what Tony is saying, the rest covered in mechanical jargon. Its calming though, the sound of Tony's voice. Even more calming is the way that Tony doesn't comment on what Steve said, the way he seems to understand. Hell, maybe he does.
In the time where Steve wasn’t occupied with conversation, which was often, he found himself taking moments here and there to stand back and observe Tony interact with an audience of his peers. He watched him play to the crowd, discussing techno-babble at a breakneck pace with like-minded people who hung greedily on his every word.
Steve still had no clue what he was supposed to do with the way he felt but he did know that he didn’t want to avoid his team any longer, a team that just so happened to include Tony. He’d have to figure out a way to keep himself from slipping up but he was done hiding in his room. He would hang out with the others and he would stop running away every time Tony showed up. He wouldn’t actively search for the brunet and he wouldn’t get him lunch or sit in his lab or go out for walks through the park anymore. What he would do is take what time he could get and learn to stay in control.
One thing should be noted first and foremost and that thing is that, at first, Steve never wanted to be in love with Tony. Even after they had become friends, even after they had become good friends, it wasn't something Steve had spent any time secretly pining for. It was as far away from what he'd had planned for his life as he could have ever imagined.
Ultimately Steve chose to turn his attention to Sharon and give her a reassuring smile, though he wasn’t sure what exactly he was reassuring her about. Whatever it was, her shoulders relaxed when he met her eyes, “yes it is. Steve, the movie?”
Steve held back the grin that wanted to break free. Tony was worried about him, he could tell that much just from the way he was squirming in his chair. It made something warm bubble up in him. Steve shut his eyes to reel the feeling back in and started to scoot his chair further away just to be safe.
Steve found himself nodding along with the others before he actually took in the full meaning of Mattias’ words, “Oh” Steve started to shake his head, “Tony and I –“
Steve righted himself in his chair, and shook his head. He caught Natasha smirking at him, “So glad you could make it Steve.”
Bruce spoke up from his arm chair, “You don’t get a vote Tony. You were late for sign in. It’s Steve’s choice.”
Was he obsessed with Tony? It fit in a twisted turn of events. The amount of times he must have stared at the other man to capture his every expression, the number of times he must have just sat and drawn every detail of his body. It fit but it didn't feel right. He didn't feel like he was obsessed, like he had to be around him at all hours of the day and know what he was doing every second. That's how obsession usually worked, wasn’t it?
Steve shook his head insistently before Tony had even finished speaking, saw a flash of Tony in the sky, surrounded and alone, “you’re not going by yourself Tony, if you’re right and the droids are being manufactured there, something could go wrong and you’ll need backup.”
It was inappropriate of course, a moment of weakness on his part; they were technically still on a mission. Steve knew he needed to reel it in. He closed his eyes briefly, focused on pushing the feeling back in place.
He didn’t immediately get out of bed. Instead he stayed lying down and listened to the soothing sounds of the storm. He might have stayed lying there all day if it weren’t for the insistent rumbling coming not from outside, but from his stomach.
“Of course I’m not wrong. I told Fury to send me with you guys; it was a tech facility for fucks sake. I told him as much when communication went down.” Tony smirked “the only reason he didn’t throw me out was because we both knew his best bet at finding you two was me. You should have seen the look on his face.”
The waffle iron buzzed loudly. Steve shook his head to clear it and focused just on getting his breakfast done. He filled the tray with more batter and closed it just as he heard a shuffling noise from the dining room. He looked up in time to see Tony pull Nicole close to his chest and whisper in her ear. She giggled, hands skimming up and down Tony’s sides under his shirt. His nails dug in again.
It took Tony three weeks after the California incident to find information on the droid activity and when he did, he’d sent out a request for an immediate Avengers meeting. Which, yes, Steve was glad that Tony was including the team and informing them about important details pertaining to the threat, but, at the same time, he wished Tony had remembered that most people were in bed at four in the morning and didn’t appreciate being woken up with alarms for meetings that could have possibly waited till the sun was actually out.
Tony dropped in altitude, extending his arm so Steve could step in to his side. He gave Tony quick thanks before addressing the team through com again, wind rushing against his face as Iron Man took off “okay Avengers, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and I will be on ground work, these things are in the air which means we need to focus on civilian evacuation. Thor, Iron Man and Hulk will focus on bringing those droids down”
Tony wrinkled his brow, “We—Steve, it’s just me. Do you know how many red flags would be set off if all of the Avengers show up? Mostly recon, a couple days in and out. I’ve already sent an email out requesting a look around the facilities under Stark Industries name.”
Steve was saved from replying by Natasha's sharp voice "Tony." He was still amazed how threatening she could make a name sound; he wanted to ask her to teach him how to do that sometime.
Steve felt Nicole’s eyes on him, very possibly confused by his behavior. He stared down at the batter in favor of looking up to meet her eye.
Not until the night did the thoughts come insistently, alone in his room with the sketchbook perched on his lap as Steve tried to find some sort of answer he could accept hidden within the folds. There was nothing, nothing but Tony’s eyes taunting him from the pages.
Tony gave Steve a distressed look “Your manners are sometimes really appalling. If only the rest of the world knew that Captain America talked with his mouth full.”
Steve gave Tony enough leeway to move back, but kept one hand on his back, “Mr. Bohlen, ah” he didn’t have to reach far for a flush of embarrassment, “sorry, sir, didn’t see you there. I hope you don’t mind our leaving, Tony and I just wanted to – uh…” Steve trailed off and shot Tony a slightly wide eyed look.
Steve didn’t do that though. Steve stood back, blank faced, as he let Tony walk away time and time again.
Steve huffed and tried to think of a way to escape Thor’s hold. Nothing came to mind that wouldn’t unnecessarily hurt Thor so he stayed put. “I’m fine Thor. Really. Just let me—“ Steve lost his place when the elevator let out a ding and Thor began to walk again. It was a moment later that Steve found himself dumped bodily into his chair with an ‘
It wasn’t the end. Steve wouldn’t accept having another friend lost to a fall. He didn’t jump after Bucky, he wouldn’t make that mistake again. He swung his shield to his back, ready to dive into the icy waters before he was distracted by the site of every droid around them falling to the ground, crashing and bursting apart.
Steve walked back to stand in front of Tony again and let himself stare for a moment. It was still relatively new. Attraction he understood after awhile, admitting he was in love. Still hard to swallow.
Tony walked up then, placed his hands on Steve’s shoulders, “Steve! Come dance with me.” Steve startled and turned his head too look up at Tony. He hadn’t even noticed him coming up.
Steve took a deep breath, “When it’s bad, I find myself wishing I’d stayed in the ice. It didn’t make sense, me living when everyone else, great men and woman, were just gone. Peggy, The Commandoes, Bucky, for awhile there. Hell, sometimes he gets this faraway look and it’s like he’s still falling back in the 40’s, still waiting to have his memories wiped again. How can I help him when I could barely help myself? I get angry, irrationally angry at him for getting that look, at myself for being useless, at him for not just staying dead. He’d have been safe dead, instead of just—being in pain all the time. He thinks I can’t see it, but I do and I miss him, the person that he used to be. I miss them all, but I’m glad they lived full lives, and died in peace, never feeling so displaced. It’s how Bucky should have gone, and it’s how I should have gone.”
Tony’s brows furrowed “you want to apologize?”he leaned forward in his seat, hands clasping on his knees.
There was a static crackle-pop before JARVIS’s voice filled all the empty spaces in his room “Good morning Captain. How may I be of service to you?”
Steve breathed, in and out, through his nose and clenched his hand behind his shield. Was he fine? Steve didn’t know, hadn’t taken the time to sort through the mess he’d pushed back. He didn’t know if he was fine, no, but he did know that he needed to do his job, which didn’t include letting his emotions get the better of him and distracting him from his main task. “I’m good Tony.” Deflection usually worked, “how about you, are you okay?”
When he was done, he smiled up at Steve, ran the pad of his thumb over Steve’s injured bottom lip, “You know, this is a rare change of pace. It’s not too often that
He heard Tony then, voice filtered through Iron Man’s speakers “Everyone stop!” The crowd stood still, falling quiet once more.
Steve turned back to the pot of oatmeal and gave it a much needed stir, mentally trying to gather the walls he had been building around him. It felt like a lost cause with Tony standing there, smiling at him the way he was. “Well, you haven’t.”
Tony waved his hand dismissively, already opening up a new window in front of him, “I’ll sleep on the plane. I still have some things to finish before we go.”
Steve shook his head and tested out his shoulder, pain already less than it had been. He yawned, “No, I’m fine. Thank you.”
Tony shrugs, mouth twisting funnily, making no comment on the subject. "I'm actually kind of hungry, are you hungry? Of course you are, lets go eat some breakfast. I'll even let you make me some pancakes. I know you can do it, Clint says they taste amazing. I'll be the judge of that." He's jittery, pocketing his phone and turning to walk to the elevator. This is how Tony Stark takes gratitude. Steve just allows himself to smile at his retreating back.
Rule three was the only rule he could truly count on himself to follow completely. It was rule three that taught him to keep a better poker face and rule three that got him through most days. Tony would remain oblivious and Steve was alright with that.
Steve wanted that, needed that in an intrinsic way. He wanted Tony to place a casual hand on his shoulder, to make fun of his technique at cleaning rust off of the parts scattered all around them until Steve was laughing so hard that whatever it was that had set him off that time felt as insignificant as a speck of dirt on a black shirt.
And wasn’t that just perfect. Steve cursed under his breath and tried to focus on prying the door of a totaled car open to get the family out.
Tony let out a slight hiss when Steve tapped his cheek and rolled his eyes, but he didn’t pull away. "It’s fine. Those things pack a mean tail swing. You should know, you look like you got hit a few times."
Despite Tony’s insistence on watching the movie, he was out halfway through. He snored softly against Steve’s shoulder, hands crossed over his chest loosely.
Tony had a rosy hue high up on his cheeks that Steve was almost startled to see. He smiled coyly up at Steve and then turned his gaze back to Mattias, shuffling just a bit closer to Steve as he spoke, “you know how it is, impromptu vacations. It’s nice to get the chance to, ahem, relax.”
Steve took the opportunity that the silence provided and made his way over to Iron Man, standing at his side in front of the crowd. “The safest place for you all is inside, away from the windows. Do not panic and do not leave this room unless otherwise instructed by one of the Avengers. In the mean time, we will figure out what’s going on and give the all clear when everything is under control. Understood?”
Tony turned to Mattias, “please excuse us, now that I’m warmed up I’d like to get my hands on the main course.”
Steve fell into place at Tony’s side, making polite conversation whenever he was prompted to, but for the most part letting Tony take the floor and do his thing.
Steve wasn’t sure how much time passed before he caught sight of red hair from the corner of his eye. It couldn’t have been too long given the very small amount of sweat he had worked up.  He stilled his movements and waited for Natasha to say something.
Thor’s lighting broke the sky in fragments, setting off a series of small explosions. Steve paused, turned his gaze toward the sky. He’d been around Tony enough to hear a shift in tone.
Steve kept his arm tight around Tony as they made their way into the crisp night air, walking as quickly as possible while still trying to appear casual.
Steve chanced a glance up at the other man, only to see him wink quickly before turning back to his adoring audience with all the excited exuberance of a child showing off.
There was a lady sitting at their table, a lady he had never seen before. She was dressed in a short, black, rumpled dress, her long brown hair tied messily up on the top of her head. She didn’t appear to notice him standing there, oblivious to anything that wasn’t the tablet in front of her or the mug in her hand. She had to be someone’s guest.
The doctors call it PTSD and Steve guesses that’s as good a name as any. What they don’t tell him is a sure way to fix it. They give him suggestions and he smiles and nods and promises to call them if he has any questions even when he knows he wont. He wont call when he feels like he can't breath or when every thing flashes before him too fast and too slow to hold onto. He wont call when he can't sleep at night or when he feels himself get so low that it’s a miracle he's able to get out of bed in the morning. He wont call because there's nothing they can do to make it stop.
And at first, those first few days, Steve needed that. Needed the time to regroup, to patch up all of the spots that had come undone during their fight. Then, then it was nearing day seven and all Steve wanted was to find Tony again, put it all behind them and move on.
Tony took his seat to Steve's right. "Sure you weren't. Another true fact: Bruce doesn't actually get angry and turn into a big green rage monster."
Steve felt disappointed up until Tony smiled at him, then all he could do was smile back. “You know…” Tony trailed off, looking around the workshop “the engine on the 1929 Benz, it needs s bit of work. You have some free time?”
.” And it was true, he wanted Tony there, the feeling strong and shrouded in guilt because he shouldn’t. He didn’t. He’s glad Tony is safe, wherever he is, he just wished, at least for a moment, that he could see Tony one more time before—
It seemed that Tony took his wishes seriously, seeing as he disappeared immediately after they returned to the tower and hadn’t been seen for almost a week and a half since.
Steve leaned back against the counter and continued to wait. He opened and closed his mouth a few times, trying to decide if he should just give in and get the others mans attention or just give it time until Tony was functioning enough to notice on his own.
When he was younger, there had been whispers about him. They all mostly stemmed from his slight frame and his love for everything and anything creative. He’d gotten into so many fights with boys twice his size over it and when he would go home at night with a black eye or a split lip, it had always comforted him to know that people like that knew nothing about him.
It was just as awful as he thought it would be, the acrid taste of blood filling his mouth as he bit through his already split lip.
Instead he pushed it aside, pushed it away like he pushed away the urge to touch or even look at Tony too much. Those were allowances that he couldn’t afford to take, not when he had to focus. Focus on what they would do once they hit the storage facility.
“I was thinking that we needed to do whatever it took before anyone got seriously injured. I was thinking that those flying junk robots needed to be taken out of the sky. I was thinking that I was doing my damn job!”
Steve looked back up. Tony was sitting there at his desk, his expression almost blank if not for the ways his eyes danced around, “I want to apologize.”
Steve stood waiting for Tony to notice him, which inevitably left him with time to take in Tony’s full appearance. He was dressed haphazardly in a gray suit with a purple tie that hung loose around his neck. Steve couldn’t really tell if he was coming in or heading out, ultimately deciding that it was anyone’s guess when it came to the genius.
The contact didn’t last long, but it didn’t end completely like Steve thought it would. Tony squeezed once, then moved his hand to brush down and to the side till only his pinkie laid over Steve’s, arms pressed together to their elbows.
It had been going well, he’d felt at ease, ready to chuck his reaction earlier to a fluke until Tony casually made his way into the room.
“Right. Just in case then,” He wiped his eyes quick, “I—I never forgave my dad. I don’t know how. He was an ass, especially when he drank, and it cost us everything. It cost his life, and it cost my mom’s life and what fucking sucked was that I missed them. I missed both of them so much being in that stupid fucking orphanage. I used to think having him back would almost be worth it if we could just get out of there.” Clint let his head hang, “I had Barney though, and I miss him too. I shouldn’t have let him go.”
Steve nodded “Yeah, sure, just” He looked back at Tony who was standing half out of the door, looking pointedly not in his direction. “Can I see your phone?” She handed it over and Steve put his number in before handing it back “Just give me a call.”
Sharon nodded, turned her back on him and walked swiftly away, immediately absorbed into the crowd of strangers.
Steve nodded “nice to meet you.” He paused, furrowed his brow as he took out the things he would need to make waffles “and you’re…?”
He never picked up on it until the day he grabbed his sketchbook and a sandwich and made his way down to Tony's lab. He walked up to the doors, tapped in his access code, and waited for the doors to open for him. When they did, the music turned down considerably and Tony glanced back to shoot him a flash of teeth. He wiped his hands on his jeans and made grabbing motions at the plate Steve was holding. "Oh good, you brought me food. Give it here."
He hadn’t realized how little he was breathing until he sucked in too much air too quickly. The grid blipped, latching on to a point a couple kilometers away. Steve was out of the aircraft before it had a chance to properly land, crashing down into the ground before pushing himself up and hobbling as fast as he could over to the red and gold pile washed up on the shore line.
The guards didn’t stand a chance, Iron Man and Captain America picking everyone off silently one by one until Steve’s Avengers ID card began to bleep insistently. Then all hell broke loose.
Steve had three golden rules that he tried to follow all times since accepting that his thing for Tony wasn’t just going to go away because he wanted it to.
The attack was swift, faster than they could have anticipated, faster than they could counter. Steve managed a feeble 2-second-long mayday before communication shut down and he had more pressing matters at hand, like fighting off the tall blue aliens currently shooting at them.
Steve remained on high alert for all of two hours or so before he finally found himself relaxing, detecting no foreseeable threats. In all honestly, all Steve could see were a bunch of highly excitable, and maybe in need of some fresh air, scientists who were more interested in talking about their work than actually attacking them in any way shape or form.
Tony telepathically ordered the gauntlets to detach, and they went back to the suit. The other one – his counterpart’s – was clearly less advanced, maybe a Mark 50 or 57. But how could he-
“I said what I thought was true. And I thought you are- were- a completely different person from the one I used to know,” Tony confessed.
“Yup, that’s me,” he said, taking away his mask. The beam didn’t hurt humans, just forced Skrulls to reveal their real aspect. He wasn’t a Skrull. “So there’s a Spider-Man in your universe too, huh?” Peter continued nervously.
“What a shame.” Stark smiled. “I always thought that meeting another me would be cathartic. Thought I would hate him, but you- I
That’s like following a tennis match. I’m kind of having whiplash from the speed you think together,” said Peter.
Tony thought of Rogers leaving the Divide after Miriam Sharpe’s murder, refusing to listen to him. Again. “Does it matter?” he parroted him.
“Here.” Tony said, touching the hologram of the planet right above them. “Earth-199999.” Then he whistled. “Wow, we came a long way…”
“Thank you, V,” the genius smiled, touched. “I’m a president here too?” then asked, looking at his counterpart.
He was Tony Stark. He was Iron Man. He was alive. New York was never split in two states. The Iron didn’t exist, and he definitely wasn’t a president. He wasn’t even CEO of his own company.
If they did—Steve didn’t know what he would even say. Was he supposed to tell them that recently his thoughts about Tony had become increasingly inappropriate? Or that he’d yet to go a night without pulling out his book that upon close and frequent inspection had proven to hold nothing but another Tony after Tony? That even once he’d concluded there were no answers to be found within the pages he still pulled the damned thing out and flipped through it?
Tony didn’t answer, suit zooming away from Steve’s site. Steve would have worried if he couldn’t still make of the vague beam of repulsors every few moments.
Tony crossed his arms “I think I’ll stay. Coulson’s been saying I need to turn up to more of these things.”
Steve shot Tony one quick look before turning back to the road, “Long gone, I’m holding you to that.”
JARVIS paused for only a moment “ Thunderstorms until noon with a 70% chance of continued showers throughout the evening”
Steve didn’t want to wait; he wanted to get out of there, to walk away from all of this mess before he did something he’d regret. He shook off Tony’s hand. “No”
Steve tried for a reassuring nod at Tony, but all it managed to do was make Tony stare at him as if he were a particularly challenging problem.
whoa, okay. This has  not been looked over by anyone but me so please excuse any mistakes I haven't caught.
He wasn’t sure how Tony would react to the information, kept himself up for hours thinking about it some nights.
Steve rolled his eyes, playing along with Tony’s antics. He made his voice as deadpanned as possible, “that must be it”, he clasped Tony’s shoulder and squeezed, “Never a dull moment with this one.”
It always amazed Steve how the smallest of things could turn a life upside down. Just like the day down in Tony’s lab all over again, except, maybe, so much bigger. That had been attraction then, and in that moment, when Tony had smiled at him, he’d felt—he felt something he’d only felt once before in his entire life.
His hand fell flat to the table with a resounding smack, his head jerked forward. Steve caught himself just before his face hit the table top. He blinked his eyes rapidly, sat up straight and met amused brown eyes.
Steve let her pull him up, stood there staring at the two of them for a moment longer. “Look, I really appreciate—“
On Saturday evening, as he was waiting for the elevator to pick him up from the floor that held the gym to take him discreetly back up to his own floor, he found himself caught from behind and lifted bodily from the ground.
Mattias sighed wistfully, “The missus is always on my case, always at the office, never make enough time for just the two of us. Though, it must be a bit better, seeing as you two at least work partially together.”
Tony was the first to break. He let his gaze drop, ran his had roughly over his face, wincing when he hit his jaw, “You need me out there. You needed me out there today. Those things, they were just getting stronger and stronger. You heard the others, we couldn’t take that, we needed an out and I provided one. Why can’t you get it through your thick skull that I did the right thing?”
Steve tapped his fingers on the table to keep himself awake. He wasn’t allowed to leave but all he could think about was calling a cab to take him back home so that he could shuffle his way to his room and fall face first onto his actually comfortable bed. He’d sleep for hours to make up for all the sleep he hadn’t gotten during the past week.
Tony asked again, “what movie are we watching exactly? Please, not Tangled again. I know, her hair is like Thor’s, all long and beautiful and magic” he leaned forward to lightly pull a strand of Thor’s hair, causing Thor to smile toothily up at him, “but enough is enough. There are only so many times I can watch Eugene chop of Repunzal’s hair to show his love. I think we get it, he loved her even as a brunette. Personally, I prefer blondes.” Before Steve knew it, Tony had reached up and ruffled Steve’s hair and winked at Sharon who promptly pursed her lips.
Steve closed his mouth and watched silently as Tony made his way to the couch. He squeezed his way in between Steve and Natasha and patted both of their thighs once in greeting. “Hey, so, what are we watching?”
Tony snorts and turns quickly so that his back is against the rail "Nah, I always keep weird hours. Comes with the whole genius thing."
Most people thought that you saw red when you were angry, that wasn’t always true. When you really felt it, in every cell of your body, deep in your bones, it was white. White creeping at the edge of your vision, a white noise clouding out all other sound, pure and horrible white. It was beautiful and dangerous and so easy to grasp onto when everything else was falling away.
Tony sighed, “It worked Steve, this thing we’re doing right now, this arguing? It’s pointless. I did what needed to be done, I’d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant ending that fight.”
Steve was under no illusion that this was his place, knew that he didn’t really belong here, like a fish on dry land. He was the outsider, his presence, seemingly, completely unnecessary, yet, he didn’t regret his decision to tag along. No, he was glad to be there with Tony, would have been bouncing off the walls if Tony had insisted he stayed behind, monitoring him any way he could, just in case backup was needed. Not that he planned to give Natasha the satisfaction of letting her know she was right about that minor detail.
Tony opened his mouth to protest presumably, but Natasha hushed him with a quiet murmur, “There’s always a chance things will get heavy.” Steve met her eyes, saw what she was going to say before she actually said it and he couldn’t say he didn’t approve. “It doesn’t have to be all of us, just, take Steve with you.” And then under her breath, “lord knows he won’t function if you don’t”
He caught Mattias’ eye, set his shoulders and smiled apologetically, “Sorry, just a bit distracted. It’s been a long day among many.”
Tony let out a distorted huff of air, “13—make that 12.264% possibility that they can reverse my hack and take over Iron Man, but—“
When he got there he could see Tony just barely through the window, felt the vibrations of the bass emitting from the glass doors. In front of him was one of the droids they had fought, disassembled and scattered all over the table. The sight of them made the back of Steve’s mouth taste of bile.
Everything fell away then, like he was freefalling without a parachute, the only fixed point being Tony, on him, surrounding him, keeping him from crashing.
He stood up, dragging Tony with him a second later. Tony stumbled before managing to lock his legs in place. To Tony’s credit, he managed to stay almost completely still as Steve checked him over for any signs of injury, at least all the way up until his face scrunched up into itself “Steve, you’re shot”
“Happy! Yeah—yeah, look I’m going to need you here asap with—“ He paused, turned to Steve “hamburgers or pizza?” Steve’s brow furrowed and Tony nodded his head “You’re right, you look like you could eat both. Happy, bring hamburgers and pizza, make it quick. 20 minutes or less, pay extra if you have to.” He hung up. “Happy’s bringing you food.”
He saw Bucky then, lying mangled and bloody. He heard his whisper ‘you let me fall’.  And he had, hadn’t he? He let Bucky fall and he never even got the chance to reassure him that it was all going to be okay, that Steve was going to get him help. He never got a chance to give Bucky those empty words because he was too busy clinging to the edge of a train. Watching his friend fall, unable to let go himself.
Tony’s lips twisted and then fell back into place, light bulb clearly switching on with the way he perked up, “Natasha!”
His throat felt dry, words scratching raw, “What…” He trailed off, unable to finish. If Tony had figured it out—this really wasn’t the best time or place for this conversation.
Steve felt a bone deep weariness, added onto the bone deep exhaustion he already felt. He sighed. “Is there something you wanted Tony?”
Steve heard it anyways, decided he might as well get a few things off his chest too while they were at it, “I accidentally smashed Thor’s cell phone, then slipped it into his pocket before he sat down so that he thought he just sat on it wrong. I’ve almost told him a million times but Tony said the next phone I broke, I’d have to sit through the entire process of him fixing it and then learn how to do it myself. Cars I like, phones, not so much. I’m also the one who recorded all of those sex in the city episodes, not Jan, and I’m the one who ate the last of Bruce’s muffins, I didn’t think it would make his so—angry.”
Sharon pulled back, placed her hand on his cheek “I’m going to miss doing that.” She pulled away from him completely. “I’ll call you sometime”
Tony whole face scrunched up as he laughed, “Definitely, top five for sure. I can’t wait to tell everyone I made out with Captain America.”
Steve got comfortable; he started telling her everything he could about the Peggy he knew. He let her know about the Peggy who punched a man right in the face and the Peggy who helped him save his best friend. He told her about the women who was there for him at what he thought was the very end, the women he still missed.
Tony pauses and gives Steve a startled look before laughing  and shaking his head " I don’t know if I'm going to be able to get used to that Cap. I gotta tell you, its kind of freaking me out"
“Just as good.” And that had to mean something, didn’t it? “I can see the articles now, ‘Suave Stark caught canoodling with Super Soldier Steve: Mission gone right.’
And it was true. Tony was a beautiful person. He knew that, and had always known that Tony was the sort of handsome fellow that mothers warned their daughters about. He had consistently tan skin and warm brown eyes that were veiled with thick, long lashes fanning above sharp cheekbones. He was smaller and shorter than Steve's own build, but he was also leanly muscled and carried himself in a way that made him seem as though he was towering over everyone.
Tony stood abruptly. He crossed the room, getting to the door just as it opened. “Finally, what took so long?”
He didn’t stop until he was back in his own room with the door locked, sitting cross legged on his bed.
“I could eat” Steve stood up himself and followed her out of the room. They walked all the way to the common area in companionable silence.
If he gave in, if he gave it a chance, then eventually there may not be any lingering feelings for Tony at all.
Natasha sat on the floor next to him, taking in quick huffs of air. She gave him a calm look, cheeks flushed from the exertion of their workout “Better?”
Steve took a moment to steady himself before calling out for Iron Man’s status. He’d been on his way to find him when the sky had broken open and Steve had been thrown off his feet, hitting the ground hard.
Steve thought only of his bed for a moment, “yeah, okay.” He gave Tony a quick glance, kept his eyes firmly away from where Tony’s shirt still hadn’t righted itself, “you should get a few hours in before we leave.”
Unluckily for him, or luckily if he listened to the part of himself that wanted it, Tony was all about physical reassurance. He clapped his hand onto the back of Steve's neck and squeezed lightly. "I think I speak for all of us when I say that we get it, alone time: good. Just remember next time that you have an entire house full of people who you can talk to. You know, instead of brooding." He grinned goofily at Steve and Steve couldn't help the way his eyes fell half lidded and his lips pulled up at the corners.
“I’m sure you’ve seduced enough for the both of us.” He wasn’t bitter, that wasn’t supposed to sound bitter. They were talking about food for goodness sakes.
The first couple weeks in the Tower he confined himself to select rooms, mostly his own. It went on like that until Clint and Natasha walked in and dragged him out and into the communal living area for what was apparently movie night. After that he started to explore exactly where it was that he lived now. He still found the tower as big and ugly as he had when her first saw it on the outside, but on the inside it was actually pretty nice. Steve would even go as far as to say that he liked it. When he finally made his way to the roof for the first time it quickly became one of his favorite things about his new home.
Steve barked out an alarmed “Thor!” who promptly took off toward the growing group. “Natasha get the Quinjet ready, I’ll meet you there”
He refused to look back down until he was tucking Tony into his bed and even then only briefly. When he started to leave he felt a hand grip his wrist. He startled and looked down. Tony’s eyes were still closed but his mouth fell open “thanks”
The first time they met up Steve had been nervous, unsure of what he should say to her. His worries we’re forgotten once they sat down and she began to talk.
Tony came into view then, repulsors blazing faster than Steve could keep up with. He sounded winded “I can bring them down, all of them at once.”
' and sipped more of his coffee, walking slowly over to stand next to Steve and nodding at his breakfast. "What is that?"
When she finally did speak, it was even and clear  with a blank expression, “I don’t know what to say to you Steve”
They met again and again and it was nice. He really liked Sharon, he enjoyed having a friend outside of the tower.
Steve let out an amused breath and began to draw. He never really set out to draw anything in particular, instead he chose to just see what would take shape and go with it. He was able to get lost in it, the scrape of pencil over paper in the foreground and Tony talking to JARVIS in the background. He only glanced up when he heard the sound of Tony's welder turning on.
He stopped mid line, completely enchanted by the view before him. Tony's body moved precisely and gracefully as he almost danced around the hunk of metal in front of him. His hair was disheveled as it usually was when he had been down in his workspace for too long and his face was lit up by sparks of yellow, red, and orange that flew at him. Steve's eyes trailed down to linger over the way Tony's black tank top clung to his chest, contrasting with the way his oil stained jeans hung low and loose on his hips. He was a mess, no doubt about it, but he was also lovely and beautiful and, Steve thought, almost ethereal.
There was Tony thrumming through veins, trapped behind his ribcage, squeezing the breath from him on daily. Thinking about and subsequently trying not to think about Tony was—well it was time consuming.
Steve cut him off, “It worked? You think that’s—“ Steve stopped. He needed space, he needed to hold it together. When he spoke again, his voice was much lower, ice instead of fire. “What the hell were you thinking? I told you not to do it. I gave you an order Tony. A direct order to hold your damn ground.”
They arrived at Bohlen Incorporated promptly at their scheduled time of nine a.m., and were approached immediately by Mattias himself. Mr. Bohlen was a middle aged, enthusiastic man who had an air of permanent relaxation about him. He wore his hair back in a ponytail, blond tendrils coming undone from behind his ears, glasses perched precariously on his nose, and a suit, nicely pressed but with no tie.  It wasn’t hard for Steve to see why Tony might have liked him enough to offer Stark Industries assistance.
Steve made sure to keep the conversation as light as possible after his slip up. Tony was half way into describing his work with R&D when Coulson, Fury, Agent Hill, and two other agents Steve didn’t know came trailing in. They all paused for a moment, taking in the scene before moving to take seats. Fury stood at the head of the table.
Everything would change: fact. For better or for worse, the thing between them would move forward, propel Steve away from the comfort of the standstill he’d allowed himself to settle into.
Steve had gone down in the plane, he’d gone down and he’d been frozen for years only to wake up in a time that was so foreign to him that it might as well have been a completely different place. He’d opened his eyes to a world where he was a war hero who fought villains with a group of extraordinary people which just so happened to include this man who was changing things Steve had been sure wouldn’t change.
A minute passed, just the sound of items being moved around, and then a triumphant sound that Steve just barely caught, before he was once again greeted with Tony’s considering face, leaning in towards him.
that. He’s the heart of this team. Without him it will all just crumble apart and that can’t happen, Clint. People need the Avengers.” He sucked in another breath— too fast, “People need Iron Man, they need Tony.
He’d excused himself early from dinner that night and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t convince himself that it wasn’t running away.
Steve pushed at Tony’s armored shoulder, “of course we’re getting out of here. Captain America and the Invincible Iron Man? They don’t stand a chance.”
Luckily Tony didn’t seem to catch on to the tone that had snuck out of Steve. He just got a faraway amused look and replied “You aren’t wrong there Cap.”
He should have known Tony would be working on them, they still hadn’t found who they belonged to. It wasn’t the site of the droids that turned Steve’s stomach, just the memory they brought.
Steve huffed out a laugh "Tony. Tony, you drink grass. I've seen you drink grass more than once. I guarantee you that this," he gestured at his oatmeal, "tastes better than grass."
Natasha caught his eye and pointed him towards the plates and told him to set the table which he did without argument.
He did manage to pry his eyes open the second he heard Tony shedding his armor, clanks and clicks retracting  to reveal sun-kissed skin only hidden by a flight suit that clung to lean muscles in a way that drew more than Steve’s artistic eye.
Tony stepped further into the room “Anytime.” He gave Steve an analytical look, lip pulled between his teeth. That wasn’t good, that meant he was thinking. Three out of four times that look was dangerous. He had that look the time before he jumped off the roof to test how fast his suit could catch him and he had that look when he challenged Thor to a drinking contest that resulted in what he deemed ‘the third worst hangover of his life’.
The lingering memory of the kiss earlier that evening, came unbidden, but suddenly, tentatively, welcome.
at him. But he wouldn’t, couldn’t, and Steve would flinch at the turn his own thoughts had taken. He shove them away as best as he could. He didn’t want to see that, didn’t want to mourn a moment that might not even happen.
It was all a mirage, a mirror into a false reality he had been deluding himself into believes was real. The thing about mirrors though, was that they were extremely fragile. All it took was one stone cast and the entire surface crumbled, the perfect image ruined and no matter how much you tried to piece them back together you could always see the cracks.
Steve didn’t know where to start, “okay, but—“ he tilted his head, contemplating the implications and finding himself irrationally miffed that Natasha had never mentioned she’d gotten to first base with Tony. “You kissed Nat?”  He’d have to get her to tell him that story when they got back.
Steve did believe that he could make it work with Sharon, he truly did. Months flew by and Steve was in that place right between loving someone and being in love with them. He enjoyed being with Sharon, he liked the way she made him feel, and most importantly, he was happy.
Tony staggered back, a flash of disbelief before storm clouds seemed to take over. He gripped his jaw, eyes narrowed at Steve “What—“
Steve huffed “I’m fine Tony. I went to medical right away. They said I was good, no internal bleeding, no broken bones, and no open wounds. I’m fine”
Thor landed beside Steve in a flourish, Mjollnir held aloft “It is of no use, they come non-stop from a source yet unknown. I fear the tide shall shift at any moment.”
“Not the point.” Though it seemed point enough that Tony stopped arguing with Steve for the time being. Instead he seemed to put all of his attention into disinfecting and bandaging the wound on Steve’s temple.
The debrief wasn’t actually long, though it was probably made shorter by the snide comments Tony kept letting slip out every so often. Steve could tell Fury’s patience with Tony was running low whenever his words would come out faster than usual, speeding the meeting along.
Judging by the smiles he received, he thought they just might have got it. They all went through times when they needed to be alone and they knew when to come and get him and when to ask questions.
Well, the knowing he was in love part was simple. The rest of it, Tony’s obliviousness, the part where he sort of hoped Tony would stay in the dark, that was complicated wrapped in doubt covered in a sprinkling of too much to handle.
and Clint placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder as he cried, the weight of it heavy and not at all soothing, but Steve let him, leaned into the contact. His voice tore out of him, wet and ragged and
The corners of Steve’s mouth twitched up for a beat. He looked up and saw Tony walking in his direction, grin plastered over his face even as his eyes were knitted with concern. “Cap, no longer brooding in your room I see. That’s good, brooding will give you wrinkles right about,” he tapped Steve’s forehead, “here.”
Everything went fine in the beginning, just him, Sharon, Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Thor sitting around in the living room arguing over which movie to watch.
There were other times too, when he was with Sharon and he’d go hours without thinking about him because he was focused on her. They had fun together, he liked being with her, and maybe that was all it really took. Maybe it wasn’t always the consuming rush of feeling that was Tony Stark, but instead the slow tide that was Sharon Carter that he needed all along to be able to put everything behind him.
Tony’s arms around his neck squeezed tighter, face closer as he just slightly went up on his tip toes. He looked up at Steve through thick eyelashes, his voice low in a way that shot straight to the pit of his stomach, curling and twisting till he felt almost nauseous with pleasure, “Make it good Steve, like you really want me, like—like you have to have me in your bed right now.”
Tony rolled over then, letting go of his wrist. He got out a quick “you’re…favorite” before the light snoring started up.
It didn’t sit as heavily as it once had though, not after they’d both adjusted and finally worked out a balance that clicked.  Man from the past met a man from the future, both were destined to find peace somewhere in the present. Steve snorted quietly to himself; he never claimed to be a poet.
Tony sniffed and gave him a look of pure annoyance “yeah yeah, don’t say it. Let me fly you home, you can stare disappointedly at me after you’ve gotten a good 12 hours of sleep under your belt.”
Steve lets out a breath and closes his eyes. There's no way he's sleeping tonight. He swings his legs over the edge of the bed and plants his feet firmly on the ground. He stands up straight, gives one last longing look to his bed and then walks forward. One foot in front of the other until he finds himself in the elevator, staring at the buttons trying to decide where he plans to go that night.
They continued bickering until the movie started, but even then Steve was lost in his own thoughts. What had he been thinking?
Steve felt heat all around them, the explosions were getting closer, “Sometimes I don’t want to be an Avenger. Sometimes I don’t want to be Captain America.  It’s – who I am, I guess. But there’s also Steve Rogers, and, it’s hard living in your own shadow.” Steve dropped his head back to the wall, “I wouldn’t stop though, doing this, doing good. I could never forgive myself sitting back with the ability to do something when innocent lives are in danger.”
Steve laughed, a full belly laugh, at that. He tightening his hold on Tony, “The alliteration is inspired, how do you manage it Mr. Stark?”
Steve watched as Tony stretched out once he was completely free, like a satisfied cat after a nap, before he trailed leisurely to the back of the aircraft to rummage through a compartment hidden there.
Tony shook his head, “came home early. I heard Sharon was going to be here, didn’t want to miss that.” Tony looked around Steve to catch Sharon’s eye, “How are you? Is Steve treating you well?” He gave her a charming smile that surprisingly seemed to have no effect on her what so ever.
Steve’s throat shut, air just barely managing to make its way through. He might have tried to yell but there was no sound. He stumbled, clumsy with dread, as he made his way to the railing. He couldn’t see anything, couldn’t hear anything. He tried to get his voice to work, to call out but it was useless. He stood choking on nothing.
Regardless of the outcome, regardless of how Tony took it, one thing Steve did know was that it was coming. He felt the restlessness in his bones, the tick of a clock winding down until it reached zero.
Five, Ten, Forty minutes passed by with nothing. No sign or word. Steve duck in and out of the water, feeling more and more dismayed as the time ticked on. Steve tried to stop thinking, tried not to believe that it was already too late. With those thoughts came a rising hysteria that would do absolutely nothing to help the situation.
It was all going well enough, all the way up until the whining started. It was low at first, excusable, a minor nuisance that only gained half of Steve’s attention.
He fell to his knees at the armors side. His fingers shook as he made quick work of the manual releases, heart in his throat as the final one came undone.
He turned back to the TV just as Bruce chuckled and pointed at the screen "Yeah, that one even looks like a female version of him."
The first book had been quickly filled with people and places that he didn’t want to forget. There were pages and pages full of his mother’s soft smile and king eyes and the apartment where he had grown up. Drawings of his neighbors, like the Baxters who ran a bakery down the road and always made sure to drop off what they could to help his mother out. Bucky was littered on the pages as a devilish little kid, smirking out at him, and then older, still smirking but with two dames on his arms.
He opened his eyes again to stare down at Tony’s rumpled form and allowed himself to break rule number one. He ran his hands lightly over Tony’s forehead and pushed back the fallen strands of hair there, “What am I supposed to do now, huh?”
Tony narrowed his eyes and grabbed the bowl, using the spoon to gesture at his own face "Stop with the whole face thing. You only get to use it four more times this month otherwise it won't be fair to the rest of us who can’t look like puppy dogs." Steve shook his head and watched as he slowly took a bite, eyes fluttering shut. "Hmm, S'good Cap." He swallowed and grinned toothily up at Steve. "Next time I'll just take your word."
and Steve didn’t want to think about how close he’d been lately to being in love all over again, how when he thinks of love now, he see’s warm brown eyes, motor oil, and a private smile illuminated by the soft blue glow of holograms. He breathed in a shuddering breath, “I never really wanted a simple life, I didn’t think about it. I wanted to love and be loved and I’d go along with wherever that took me, whether that be a house on a grove with 3 children and a dog, or a studio walk up with a cat.”
The music drowned out all the sound in the room, even the sound of Steve’s own footsteps on the ground. Steve cleared his throat, “Tony.”
Tony looked down at his phone, back to Steve, then at his phone again. “Yeah, I stopped in to see her. Clint’s going to stay and keep her company.”
He managed to pull in a full breath, mind put just a fraction at ease by the site. Tony had done it. He was going to kill Tony, but maybe he’d hug him first. Just maybe.
The ice is more painful than he would have thought. Its sharp, stinging him in a million places. Is ice supposed to burn this much?
Steve let his hand linger, index finger tracing the bruise idly. Steve only pulled away when his gaze fell to Tony’s tongue trailing over a small knick on his bottom lip. He shuffled back, hands on his hips before falling awkwardly to his side. He diverted his eyes to the SHIELD agents loading the lizards and jerkily nodded his head toward them. “I should go help them load up—Get that looked at.” Without another word, Steve walked away, steadily ignoring the eyes on his back.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut, “I know. I just wish I’d told him – I wish I’d said something, but, I was sure there was time left. He was okay waiting for me, I know he was, he didn’t say it, but I know. And now I waited too long and everything is fucked up and I never
Tony didn’t move for a long moment, and then Iron Mans face plate retracted, catching Steve off guard. He met Tony’s steady gaze warily, “what is it?”
When all was said and done, the explosions produced by the droids was something truly magnificent to see, like fireworks in the sky.
Steve did eventually find out though. He was informed by Natasha that it had been a long time in the making. There was something about Pepper wanting Tony Stark, not Iron man which Steve didn’t understand. Tony was Iron man, there was no separation between the two.
Then it got louder, and louder still until several people started dropping, hands to their ears, screaming bloody murder on their knees. The noise kept on, Steve covered his ear’s in hope to drown it out just a bit.
Tony checks his phone again and shrugs "I'm not sure, maybe two hours? Probably three. JARVIS, how long was he asleep?"
left, “I’ve done a lot of stupid shit in my life but being a part of the Avengers—I thought I was finally doing something worth a damn. It’s, well, it’s good. I sure as hell wasn’t done though. I need—fuck” He stopped talking, rolled his eyes skyward, “A few more years, I think. That should have covered it all.”
They just weren’t right for him, and even when he wanted Tony to find someone special, he was relieved that he hadn’t settled for any of the girls Steve had seen him with.
Then, the worst times, when he was caught somewhere in between the two. Those usually came about when Tony brought home those different girls, when he found himself wanting to calmly walk over and separate the two of them. He wanted to make Tony see that it should be him, not her, who got to have Tony’s fingers trailed down their hips, that Tony should smile that seductive smile at him before dragging them both to the bedroom. Steve wanted to let Tony know then in there that he deserved more than a quick fuck, he deserved someone who loved him and wanted him there for more than a few nights. Someone who would be there day in and day out. He could be that for Tony, he wanted to be that for Tony.
With a newfound resolve, Steve closed his eyes and tried to ignore the echo of a laugh that he could still hear in his head.
It wasn’t until they had become friends, real friends, that Steve had even set foot in the door of Tony’s lab but when he did, Steve had barely managed to keep his hands to himself and not let his fingers run over everything that caught his eye. Tony’s lab was exactly the type of place that Steve thought really looked the way Steve had always imagined the future would be. It was sleek, modern, and full of glowing images littered in the air. It screamed ‘Tony Stark’ in big, bold holographic letters and Steve had walked around with wide impressed eyes until he caught Tony leaning against his desk with a knowing smirk on his face.
He lost himself to the press of Tony’s lips, lost himself in the smell of Tony’s cologne and the way his hands moved over Steve’s body, the warm pressure of his fingers, the way Tony’s body felt under Steve’s hands, one tangled helplessly in Tony’s hair, the other running down along Tony’s spine before falling to the small of Tony’s back in an effort to bring him in closer.
“I’m sorry. He’s right about this,” Stark replied. “You don’t have any idea of what the Skrulls are capable of. They are stronger than humans; they can shapeshift and become anyone else. They sometimes even have the powers of the Fantastic 4.
He felt hollow. There just was this empty hole in his chest that he didn’t know how to fill. It didn’t hurt exactly; it was numb. Sometimes, just for a moment, he could fill it with Peter’s smile, with Vision’s voice, with Rhodey’s presence. But it wasn’t enough. And Tony didn’t know what else could it take. He felt like he was missing something, some fundamental piece without whom he couldn’t work, he shouldn’t work. But instead he was going on, and on, and on…
Steve placed a hand on the back of his neck, pushed him closer, pressed their foreheads together. “I don’t know- I don’t know, Tony. I don’t know.”
“You’re going to make me cry, kid. It’s too early. And I have a bad heart, you know?” Tony babbled, starting walking again. “Shut up. Let’s go have breakfast.”
Sometimes, Tony wondered what it would need to fill it. Pepper? The other Avengers? He didn’t know. He kept working.
Stark smirked. “Maybe one day you’ll see for yourself.” He turned his gaze on the machine. They were good to go. They didn’t need to fly to a specific location because the first jump would be to a parallel dimension. “Thank you- for saving us.”
“I really don’t care. Go to him, or go to bed. Go wherever you want. Just go away,” Tony snarled, and Rogers finally got the message. He was finally alone.
” ordered a metallic voice, and Tony raised his eyes to meet an old fashioned gold-titanium alloy Iron Man mask. A moment later the helmet retracted. “We are not Skrulls. You are in another universe,” explained the man. His hair was still black, and the suit was an old model, but he was definitely him- another him.
“I’m more concerned with something else,” Rogers said though. “What have you done with the Skrulls?”
“Is that what aliens look like? I totally shouldn’t have quoted Doctor Who, right? Oh boy... Mr. Stark, what  are we gonna do with them?”
Rogers sat up and then saw the other two. “There’s another Tony Stark now. Perfect. This day just gets better and better.”
Tony woke up with a start. Throat closed, chest constricted, heart beating. He was still breathing, still alive. Did the bomb blow? Steve. Steve! Where was Steve? He looked around frantically, but he didn’t have to look too far. Steve was right beside him. His eyes were closed, the helmet was off, and half of his face was blue and puffy. Before he could think properly, Tony put an ear on his breast. The heartbeat was strong and steady. And now that he was leaning over it, Tony could feel his chest rise and fall too.
The General startled awake, heart beating hard under his palm, breath puffing. His blue eyes stared him for a long minute while he calmed down.
“You mean- in another location?” asked Tony, evaluating the idea. They didn’t need to open it where they arrived, where the Divide was. They could do it somewhere else, where they knew it would coincide with a safe – possibly neutral – place.
Tony felt a strange queasy feeling looking at the three of them, his stomach cramping. “Are you guys going to tuck him in and read him a fairytale?” he snapped harsher than he meant to.
Designing the machine for opening the portal took less than a day. It was mostly Stark’s work, really; Tony only helped a little. What he really did was study and memorize anything he could, graciously taking the lesson from his older self.
Tony nodded back, satisfied. “Good, kid.” He concluded, then thought better of it. “You are a good kid, you know that? I want you to know that. Don’t think that I don’t appreciate you just because sometimes my patience runs short. I don’t want you to-”
Stark nodded. Now that they were walking side by side, Tony noticed his other self was a little bit taller. To his eyes, he looked still a bit dazed, but his voice was firm when he replied: “Keep your hands away from it. I know you are dying of lust and can’t wait – I would feel the same – but the suit will not work for you. Not without Extremis.”
-” He just couldn’t finish. He could feel Steve in front of him, now. Steve’s hands sort of hovering above his shoulders, like he wasn’t allowed to touch him, like he didn’t know how to do it. They didn’t know how to touch each other without doing damage, anymore.
“I don’t mind,” Stark said distracted, already passing an arm under Peter’s knees and the other behind his shoulders. He lifted the little guy like he weighed nothing, then winked. “I’m stronger than I look.” Rogers tucked Peter’s arms to his chest so they weren’t dangling lifelessly in the air.
“What the hell is this, Tones?” Jim Rhodes was there, keeping himself up with a hand on the wall. Every step painstakingly difficult even with the new implant.
“Isn’t it?” Tony cutoff. “When I brought you that matching set of pens, you almost did. You were considering signing.”
Of course, it was in the sewers, so no one noticed the bright crack of light in the tunnel. It was like a crooked smile floating mid-air.
“It’s really not. Those Skrulls are soldiers; they were following orders. We will keep them prisoner and when we find a way to get you guys back home, the Skrulls will go too,” Tony explained, stressing the last part. “They can’t stay here. They are not from this universe.”
Peter was sleeping like a rock even after Tony put him to bed. Steve covered him with the sheets, and they looked at him sleeping for a long time. The room was dark, only a sliver of light coming through the door, left ajar. Steve face was even darker, eyebrows meeting in a frown, all sharp black shadows like it was set in stone.
Tony brought slowly down his coffee, placing the cup on the worktable with excessive care. “Come again?”
a killer. Wow. Priceless. That’s really rich coming from you. No, Steve Rogers isn’t dead. He just isn’t
“Still- if it wasn’t for you, we would still be there. We wouldn’t even know we were still alive. You saved us.” He stressed. “Not only our lives. I- I don’t think you get how important were these past few days for us. We haven’t really talked for- for years, me and Steve.” Stark said in a quiet voice. He took off his glasses and started playing with them. “You gave us a second chance.”
“I had to modify Maya’s version. It’s a long story. Was a long time ago. I was dying, didn’t had much of a choice,” he said flippantly, walking around like he owned the place. Rogers looked up sharply at the last bit, shock clearly written in his eyes, but didn’t say anything.
that fucking shield anymore,” he said right up in his face. “My father made that shield. That’s Stark propriety. So you can take your self-righteous indignation and kindly shove it up your ass.”
He closed his eyes, gripped Steve’s T-shirt. “I can’t apologize for what I did. I still believe in registration, but- but I never wanted it to go
“Come on Spidey, time to call it a night,” his counterpart announced, shaking his shoulder. The kid only grumbled and kept on sleeping. Stark exchanged a look with the General and shrugged. “I’ll take him.”
“What if we opened a portal to another dimension, one we know to be safe,” Vision explained in his composed voice. “And then you do another jump from there to your universe?”
My eyes...” Spider-Man exclaimed, blinded by the bright flash. At the same time, another armored hand clamped down on Tony’s wrist.
of people will try to steer you this way or that, some for your own good and some- not. Listen to them, always listen. Just don’t let them get to you. Okay?” He stressed, patting his chest.
“It is of no consequence.” Vision reassured him, offering him again the glass half full. Tony noted that he didn’t bring one for Steve. That was practically hostile from the android.
“Alright,” Iron Man let his wrist go. “I took the liberty of taking away your armor. We needed to see if you were fine. The rest of it is just there beside the door.”
“No. No Rogers, you did that yourself,” he deadpanned. And for the second time, he was about to put the phone down. This was useless. It wouldn’t solve anything anyway.
“Yeah. I guess- I just- all these years, Tony. It was just easier think I didn’t really know you, that the man I thought you once were never existed,” Steve admitted. “I forgot you are a hero. And I’m sorry for that.”
“Unless there’s a tear in the space’s tissue! See, I can do the completing each other’s sentences too!” exclaimed Spider-Man, jumping down to the pavement.
“I’ll have to take the shield too,” Tony said, without really looking at the General. This Steve Rogers was different from the one he knew. The military buzz cut and olive green cargo pants gave him a really Schwarzenegger look. His skin was sun-baked to a gold-brown tinge. His hair bleached by sunlight. And somehow he looked older; every line in his face seemed to be cut deeper and harsher. But the voice was the same, the same baby-blue eyes, same plush mouth. Tony couldn’t stand it. “Don’t worry. I already have one to match it in storage.”
