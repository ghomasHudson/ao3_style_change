“Soulmates are- are real?” Steve asked, sitting up.
Steve’s grin was almost blinding, and then he leant forward to kiss Tony, hard, bringing his hands up to cradle Tony’s face. Tony let out a little noise of shock, and then let his hand twine into Steve’s hair. It was… thrilling, to kiss someone like this; not partially shifted, no, but with the

of the time there was a good reason.
Their lips might have both been cold, but that did nothing to stop the searing heat of the kiss. It was more than just a kiss—it was a revelation, and a celebration, and just as they broke apart for air, an impossibly loud cheer went up from inside.

So you can consider yourself dismissed, Agent Rogers.” Stark turned on his heel, storming away, but Steve, frowning now, followed.

“Well,” 3490 Tony said, deadpan, “if I must put it bluntly, you all interrupted my date night with my husband. I had not seen him in three weeks before you arrived, and before that we’d been criminally busy for a month. So today I’ve cleared both our schedules—a fact he should be discovering right around now—and I intend to fuck my husband until he screams. Preferably several times. Now, I personally don’t give a fuck what you all do or don’t know about our personal lives because really, you’re all up in them anyway. But I think that my husband’s delicate sensibilities would never allow him to look any of you in the eye again, were you still around. Capisci?” Steve had reddened to the point of being a tomato. Tony was impressed that none of the other Avengers seemed at all fazed, though Jane had a hint of a blush.

prove to 3490 that MCU was as treacherous as they feared. Did they stay and die on the orders of a 22 year old? Or did they cut their losses and run, possibly to be executed or imprisoned on another day?
“I know,” Steve said, feeling his chest tighten. Natasha took his hand and squeezed it. Steve just leaned back on the couch and closed his eyes with a sigh. “We always lose sight of it, don’t we?”
“Convenient,” James said. Tony could see the glint of silver in her hand—a small knife she’d retrieved from God knows where. Tony didn’t want it to come to that.
“Well then, what are we waiting for? We’ve got science to do,” Bruce said decidedly. Peter’s face split into a wide grin. There, now, that was the Peter Bruce knew.
“Well, I wouldn’t have to do this if you would stop trying to make me smoothies and then spill them all over yourself,” Tony stated. The bot’s hand whirred again and beeped as if in protest. “I can take care of

Stark. Busy saving all your asses,” one of the Fury spoke. Kate couldn’t tell them apart, but she figured it was alt Fury. Alt Fury’s single eye roved over all the faces in the room and he scowled. “I’ve got what you need on the Red Skull. But this is too many eyes and ears. Rogers, Romanoff, Stark, Barton—we go somewhere more private. Now.”
“He took his board to school, so I’m guessing he’s at the skate park. Or just wandering around the city, who knows,” Kate said with a shrug. She wasn’t particularly happy with Peter. She might have overreacted this morning, but she didn’t understand why Peter couldn’t just mind his own business. “Why, did you come to talk him?”
“Twenty on that big, muscle-y dark haired guy over in the corner,” Steve said to Nat via his earpiece. Natasha was on the other side of the ballroom, looking gorgeous but deadly in a backless green dress and strappy silver stilettos.
“My lips are sealed,” Tony said. It didn’t matter. As Peter walked off, wincing slightly whenever he moved the wrong way, Tony knew that he wouldn’t have to say a damn thing. His parents would know the moment they saw him. He headed back to the Avengers. Steve regarded him with scrutiny.
“Hello Francis,” Steve said to the boy who was helping himself to an apple from the fruit bowl on the table.

Chapter 40: Tuesday, November 1, 2016
When the building came into sight, Kate took in a sharp breath. Like Stark Tower at Christmas, the building was rubble.
It wasn’t until people were shooting at her for the first time in her life that Kate realized Clint hadn’t meant that literally.
“I should have clarified yesterday. I also meant, ‘Tony, I know we’re in Vegas, but please do not send

“No. I’d rather swing my sword and shoot lightning at things. But I think
now? Well I fucking thought we’d left that back in 1996—”
“I made my family miserable this past week,” Steve said. “God I—I know I’m being selfish, but—what kind of man does that? I left my wife days before Christmas. I left my daughter, recovering from a

as a couple. There was zero romantic tension there. Although, they did have that bland, straight face of bureaucracy that would as soon tell you to fill out the correct form as shoot you in the chest. Even with that, Clint didn’t think they were believable at all, but somehow they had convinced 3490 that they were dating and wished to attend a double date with Natasha and Clint.
“I knew you couldn’t,” he said, and Clint signaled Kate. She drew her bow, so fast she imagined it as a blur, nocking three explosive arrows and then drawing back and firing all in one smooth motion.
. His parents were both superheroes. They dealt with shit weirder than their kid developing spider-based superpowers on a regular basis. It wasn’t like they were going to panic and kick him out, as happened with too many mutants. Still, Peter was jittery, like he’d swallowed fifty butterflies and they were kicking up a storm in his gut.
“Mm, was there?” Tony asked lewdly.

“Kate, why don’t you come in for breakfast,” 3490 Tony called out, puzzled. There was a squeak of the floorboards and then a teenage girl appeared in the doorway. She was wearing black lace tights, a black skirt that was indecently tight and rather short, and a turquoise top that seemed to be mainly made of sequins and sheer material and showed not a small amount of skin. She had on heavy eye make-up, which was slightly smudged, around her bright blue eyes, and her glossy black curls were a frizzy mess. Now Tony could see why the girl had been waiting on the other side of the door—she’d been trying to sneak past, back up to her room. He could see a growing fury in 3490 Tony’s eyes. “Katherine.”
“I’m a New York senator! Have to live in a New York for parts of the year to stay that way,” a voice called out. Steve looked up the stairs. Senator Stark grinned down at them. Seeing Steve, he lowered his sunglasses down the bridge of his nose. “And who’s Secret Agent Schwarzenegger here?”
“Screwdriver,” he requested. Tony handed him the one he’d been using earlier from the toolkit on the bed. “It’s not silly string.”
“Cap. Steve. Gauntlet time. You ready?” Tony asked, holding the gauntlet out for him and waving it. (Even in the thick of battle, Tony had to admit it was entertaining that the gauntlet had a wrist joint and as he shook the glove the hand waved as if saying hello.) Steve stared at him for a moment. He was covered in dust from the now destroyed Great Hall, blood from the battle, and splashes of mud from where the landmines had torn up the soft earth and sent it flying everywhere. He looked great. If the multiverse was about to end, Tony didn’t mind that being his last thought, or the last thing he saw. But Steve just kept looking at him. Tony shook the gauntlet again.
. Why you? Why

And even Kate with her powers wouldn’t stand a chance against our full team. Why bring us here if they were plotting something terrible? And why haven’t they just
“Aaaaand point to Rogers,” Other Clint piped up. For his part, he was busy assembling and disassembling a set of arrows Tony had given him as soon as he’d returned. She’d prepared a little something for all of them—Other Clint received a bow and arrows, Other Natasha a set of stilettos (the blades, not the shoes), Other Bruce a pair of special ‘stretchy’ pants like their own Bruce had, Other Pepper a Louis Vuitton bag, and Other Tony a K’nex set and an admonition to stop taking apart household appliances and go to the downtown lab already. Jane and Thor had presents waiting as well, but Steve didn’t know what. In this particular case, Steve was unsure of his wife’s motivations. He didn’t know if she simply wanted to make their extended houseguests feel particularly welcome, or if it was a reward for leaving the house (and thus, a bribe towards further out of house adventures for the alts and perhaps more frequent in house adventures for them). He really wouldn’t mind if it was the second. Tony,
“Ah, I’m sure you’ll figure it out in your own time,” 525 Tony said, sounding apologetic. “I’d give you a hint, but I don’t want to disturb the way of things here.” 3490 Tony rolled her eyes but didn’t argue.
“Uh, duh,” Tony said, raising an eyebrow. “They’re high school kids. They have to work it out themselves. They don’t need Captain Truth, Justice and the American Way running over to save a kid from bullying. You wouldn’t be doing him any favors, Cap.” Steve didn’t argue further, but he didn’t move from his spot, either. Natasha and Clint suddenly appeared, though Tony had never heard them leave the car. Clint whistled.
“Fine; but Jane, let’s keep working on that project of ours,” Tony said. “Even if we don’t have access to the materials, we can work on the designs.” Jane nodded. She seemed to be taking all of this better than Pepper was—but then again, Jane had been transported to another realm prior to their universe hopping, and she’d even been possessed by an ancient weapon. Her fearlessness shouldn’t have been surprising. Neither Natasha nor Maria looked particularly thrilled—none of them did—but everyone seemed to accept this new plan. They would keep their heads down, play along with 3490, and figure out what they were going to do as they went along. It was all they really
Steve recovered from his wound with a speed that would have been astonishing had he not been used to it. After just two weeks he was back on the job, guarding the elevator door inside of Tony’s lab. He was still a bit sore, but it was nothing Special Agent Rogers couldn’t handle. He watched Tony fiddle around with some holographic modeling of something that looked like a mechanical arm for a bit in silence, as per usual, when to his own surprise he found himself speaking.
“Heimdall is used to my brother’s trickery now. He would know,” Thor stated firmly. Natasha just raised an eyebrow. Thor frowned and continued, “I spoke with my mother to gain her thoughts on the matter. She had a theory about the space stone, in particular. Of course, we know it to be able to open portals from one side of the universe to the other but—”
Flash threw the other kid to the ground. Peter moved forward, protesting, but before he could say much of anything Flash landed a right hook to the side of his face. It sent Peter sprawling to the ground. Steve moved forward, but Tony just grabbed one of his biceps.
“Yes. There are many. And they are all registered in our database under the Superhuman Registration Act,” Tony said. Tony noticed Steve’s attention on her lock on and sharpen, and his eyes began to subtly narrow. She could tell he was about to speak, so she interrupted. “How long have you all been Avengers?” They looked around at one another, as if trying to recall. Eventually Other Tony shrugged.
“It’s fine,” James said. “I’m fine.”
“Oh, gee, I fucking wonder
“Right. Ok then,” Steve said. “I understand.” Tony had to look away from Steve. He was smiling, but Tony had seen Steve Rogers bear that particular smile before. It wasn’t a happy smile. “Feel better, then.”
“A bit,” Tony admitted.
“I’m not sure he’s capable of faking that full body blush he got when he saw me in my nightgown,” she said, thoroughly amused. “Even if he’s not an amateur superhero, he’s an amateur at
“The ceiling!” Lewis insisted.
“What is this?” she asked.
“They’re wildcards,” Francis argued. “Juston? Attacked his school with the Sentinel. Robbie? Pickpocket and burglar extraordinaire. Taki’s clean. And that’s pretty much the dynamic of this whole school, let’s be honest. Look, I’m not saying it’s right, pigeon-holing them. I’m just telling you how things go around here.”
“So what game are we playing, Tony?” Steve inquired.

“Oh really? When was the last time you slept?”
“What?” Francis asked, affronted. “It’s soft.”
“So how’s it going, anyway?” Steve asked Tony. Steve took a long drink from his water bottle. His hands were still wrapped in white tape. He, of course, actually took the time at the gym to
. I can build the basics, but I don’t know how it goes from ‘blasting a hole in the universe’ to ‘blasting a very specific hole from this universe to the next one in a manner that does not rip them both in half’,” Tony said. His mouth turned down in a grimace. “The more I work on it, the more impossible it seems, to be honest. I almost wonder if they’re not just stringing us along with promises that will never come true.” Steve took a seat next to him at the table, drawing up a stool.

“Really? Well, you should—you should probably make sure he gets the point,” Tony advised him.

was. Everything that he had lived through with these little bits of metal stuck around his neck was often unfathomable to James. He understood his father very well—too well, really. He had understood his father’s thoughts and motives and feelings far too well at far too young an age to be able to cope with it. James knew that. He wasn’t sure his father really did. But for all that James understood him, sometimes it hit James how little he
“I didn’t. I didn’t hear you,” Kate’s father’s voice returned, still quiet.

“You—that’s—what?” Tony demanded without actually finishing a question. Peter screwed the back onto the shooter, then fit the thing over his wrist. He pressed down on a button in his palm with his middle and index fingers, and white webbing shot out of the device, grabbing onto the opposite wall.
“All right, Nick. I’m feeling all of my years—even the frozen ones—today, so I’ll bite. What the hell did you learn?” Steve asked.
“It’s not—it’s not that I don’t want…to know. I just—I kind of wanted to figure out what I can do before I tell anybody about it. I want it to be…I want it to be
“Do you remember when we first moved you and Peter into separate rooms?” Tony asked. The ghost of a smile crossed Kate’s face.
She knew she couldn’t afford not to. This was her junior year of high school, a make-or-break year for colleges. She wanted to get into every Ivy League she could—preferably a school out on the west coast. She wanted a change of scenery. She wanted to get away, but she’d lost all excitement for school. She didn’t know what she wanted to do. She wasn’t particularly passionate about anything except archery, ballet, and cello, and she wasn’t sure she wanted to be a music or dance major—that would turn it into work. Sometimes she thought about skipping university all together, but she always dismissed the idea quickly. She would be an unskilled high school graduate—who would hire her? Maybe she would take a gap year. She rolled onto her side and looked at her brother who was still staring up at the ceiling.
“You tired, kiddo?” Peter asked. Nicole just nodded and then buried her face in his shoulder just as she had done to her dad, her little arms clinging around his neck. “Ok, let’s go find you a free bed.” Peter wandered over to the elevator, riding it down to the 91
“What’s MGH?” Tony interrupted.
“One year. You’ve been missing one year and

“All right, I think we’re done for today,” James said. “Everybody, dismissed.”

“Love you too,” Tony said, and hung up the phone. She watched the laptop carefully.
news?” Kate asked, interest piqued. James grunted.
“Oh no, Captain,” he spoke. “I’m well aware that is a decoy. But to copy the power signature, you had to hide it close by, yes?” The space stone began to glow bright again, the air around it crackling and fizzling with that eerie blue, and then, to Steve’s horror, the gauntlet, the real one not the decoy, floated in the air before the Red Skull, contained in that eerie crackling blue. The stones were sparking too, flashes of purple and red and green, reacting, maybe, to the presence of the space stone. “And you! Captain! I shall keep you, to
“Organic webbing,” Peter said, matter-of-fact. “Should be stronger than steel, pretty damn sticky, and dissolve after a few hours.”
He felt the fire of a fight, and he felt like every piece of his being was wound tight, a string ready to be plucked and resonate beyond itself. He had experienced everything he had trained for, and unlike Peter, who had vomited in the bathroom when they got to the bunker and had, James knew, spoken with MCU Steve for a while afterward because of the guilt he felt at killing someone in the field, unlike Kate who was despondent and almost entirely unresponsive, unlike Francis who had found the alcohol and tried to drink Torrun under the table (a bad idea all around), James felt nothing. Unlike them all, he felt no guilt at the fight, no shock at the horrors he had seen and experienced. He had no regret about what he had done, and if it would solve problems, James would gladly go and do it again. Hell, even if it wouldn’t solve any problems he was tempted to go out and find an unfortunate target.
“Look, why don’t we send a team to the Triskelion to find out what they know and then make a decision from there? This can wait a day or two. They’ve given no indication that anything is about to change. If things start looking shifty, we can regroup and go from there, but as it is we need more intelligence before we can make an informed decision,” Steve said. He felt on edge now. He’d felt

is right here—is this one new, Fury? He’s new, isn’t he. Call off your dogs,” Other Tony told Other Fury, shoving the gun away. The agent shoved it back. Tony couldn’t remember the agent’s name, but she’d have to remind him of his place and his conduct later. It was

“Goodbye Dad,” he said, and then he walked out of the kitchen without another word. Peter wanted nothing more than to sock him—he didn’t, but only for Dad. His dad turned to him. He looked more drained than Peter had ever seen him. His skin was sallow, there were dark circles under his eyes, and his posture was hunched instead of straight-backed. Peter didn’t even know he could look tired like that.

himself. But, as Steve Rogers are wont to do, his double appeared to be fast developing feelings for his wife. Steve wasn’t sure how to curb and discourage this behavior. After all, no amount of his own conscious telling him how bad an idea it was to fall in love with Tony had ever really stopped him, so what hope did Steve now have as an external, rather than internal, force have? None, he figured. Steve took another sip of his coffee before turning back to Tony. It probably couldn’t be helped. But it didn’t matter. It wasn’t like his younger double would act on it. It just meant that, as soon as he was back in his own universe, he’d have even more problems to deal with.
“Maybe,” Tony said, and they lapsed into silence. Tony ate his soup. Steve’s hand never moved from his shoulder.
“No Teddy, Kate. Teddy’s fine,” James said shortly.
“I didn’t—I didn’t—he—he took control and—“ Tony stammered. Steve just shushed her.
“I need to talk to you,” she murmured, her face still half against his chest and her eyes closed.
“Doesn’t matter. Eat,” James insisted. He refused to move. Eventually, Kate took the bowl, seeming to realize that James wasn’t going to budge on the issue. Kate looked far too tired to fight him about it. He stood there until she reluctantly took one bite, then, more interested, took another, and another. Satisfied that she would continue eating on her own, James finally went to the kitchen and got himself a bowl. Beside him, Tony had finally finished his own, but he hadn’t gotten up to throw it out. Steve still moved his thumb absently on Tony’s shoulder. He might have been imagining it, but he thought he felt the other man lean into the touch. They were all in need of a little contact right now, some small comforts. James eventually sat down next to him. Steve could tell that the kid was exhausted. He ate his soup automatically, keeping on eye on the security feeds. Steve put a hand on his shoulder, but James flinched violently away and shot him a dirty look. Steve took his hand back awkwardly.
Breakfast the next morning was brighter than it had been. Everyone seemed to be happy to have James back, even if he didn’t appear to be feeling overly conversational. It brought back a certain degree of normalcy. The Commander still seemed overly quiet, but occasionally he smiled for his children, even chuckling gently at a wry joke of Kate’s. But it was clear he was still lost in his own mind, in his own grief. Tony watched him, without even realizing he was doing it. He was thinking about Antonella, and about the secret she had carried to her grave. His own Steve would want to know, so wouldn’t this one? They seemed pretty well alike in everything else. But then again, his own Steve hadn’t just experienced the pain of losing his spouse. How could he
“That I just don’t want to be Peter the Loser anymore,” he said quietly.
“OW,” Clint complained, looking annoyed. The Captain grimaced.
“Rogers,” he said. “I didn’t take you for the type to frequent a place like this.” Tony was certainly right on that front. The bar was incredibly fancy. Beautiful people in beautiful clothes milled about having conversations about charity funds and galas and ‘summering’ on Cape Cod. The lights were dimmed low, and the air smelled heavily of expensive perfume and aftershave. Steve was incredibly underdressed in his khakis and brown leather jacket.

“…But could we finish the game first?” Kate asked. James rolled his eyes.
“I know my mother loves me,” Kate said. “I just wish she could be proud of me, too.” Kate went quiet. Steve didn’t know what to say, or if he should say anything at all. It was difficult, having your teenage daughter who isn’t your daughter bare her soul to you.
“Just eyes? That Kate would probably find the exact wrong spot in your armor and stick a foam arrow in there that would make the whole thing explode,” Steve replied. Tony looked very indignant.

“Are the armors networked together?” Tony asked frowning. “We could try to take it offline.” Kate just shook her head.

“And it is my
“I would say that’s perfect, but actually I can’t use you, Doctor Banner. The gamma radiation in your cells throws off our data,” Tony said apologetically. It could have been Tony’s imagination, but she thought Other Bruce looked a touch disappointed. Perhaps it was because getting stabbed in the arm in the name of science was just yet another thing that he could not do because of the Hulk.
“Well,” said Bruce, “that’s Tuesdays for you, isn’t it?” Tony held out the syringe filled with blood and Bruce took it in his hand. He squinted his eyes and turned it so it caught the light differently. “Human for sure. Universe testing?” Tony nodded. “I’ll be as quick as I can, but it will be a few hours at least.” Bruce disappeared back down the stairs as quickly as he’d come, but that was Bruce for you. He was always in his lab. That left Tony with the incompetent Alts. She wondered whether it was worth making conversation or if she could just watch

“So, you know what I’m here for,” she said. “Is that it?” Kate just nodded and handed it over as her mother entered the room. She took it, took one look, and raised an eyebrow.

him run, and then pick him off with a well placed arrow. Peter chose option two. He turned around, not running anymore, and grabbed Clint, grappling with the archer and surprising the man. They stumbled backwards in this awkward embrace until they reached the clearing. Peter used his strength to throw the other man down to the ground. Clint, however, was ready for such a move and swept Peter’s legs out from under him. Peter didn’t mind—they were still headed towards the pond. He rolled out of the way of another blow and got up, taking the offensive and leveling kicks at the archer until he was backing up into the water. As soon as his feet hit the pond in which James and the Captain were already fighting, James screamed,
“We don’t have a dog.”
“THIRTY MORE SECONDS!” James called out.

“So we would join them? Join the 3490 Avengers?” Tony asked, incredulous.
Clint would say this for 3490—they certainly spared no expense. The restaurant they were at was one Tony had mentioned days earlier, the Skylight, a restaurant at the top of Four Freedoms Plaza, and it had a

, I don’t even know anymore—a good little family life going here. It’s surprisingly pleasant. I never…I never figured I would be the one with 2.5 kids and the white picket fence and all. Didn’t want it. I always thought that was kind of—boring. Ordinary. But our lives are pretty interesting outside of the family, and I wouldn’t give my kids up for anything now. I like a little bit of ordinary amidst the crazy that is being an Avenger. Keeps us all grounded. Another pregnancy, another baby is an inconvenience, for sure.

Peter’s reflexive abilities were off the charts, and his perception had changed to the point that he could dodge paintball bullets male Tony shot at him at Peter’s own request. Peter wanted to try something faster, but none of them were sure how to achieve that without actually shooting something potentially deadly at him, so the idea dropped. Peter’s tendons and connective tissues were over twice as flexible as a normal human.
“What do you mean, what do I even care?” James asked. His hands were balled tightly into fists. His short nails dug into his palms. There would be more blood on his hands later.
“You’re still a girl,” Clint muttered to him out of the corner of his mouth. Tony rolled his eyes. A few moments later Tony heard Peter before he saw him. He heard the hurried, heavy footfalls of someone coming down the stairs. Peter popped into the kitchen.

? 3490 Tony just ruffled her son’s already messy hair. “Peter, why don’t you get your dad and ask him to make pancakes?”
“Does growing old scare you?” Tony asked out of the blue. Tony often had those moments, baffling Steve. She was unpredictable, and Steve thought that no matter how long he would know her for, she would always be a bit of a mystery in some ways. They laid under the stars, spread out on a picnic blanket on the beach and covered with thicker quilts as the rhythmic sound of the waves soothed them, and the cold water occasionally lapped at their exposed feet.

To be totally fair, he had a perfectly legitimate reason for disobeying orders, but he didn’t exactly have time to stop and explain the details to the good, science-deficient Captain.
“Yeah, I think we’re done,” Steve said. There wasn’t much they could say within the Mansion, anyway, even if they had something to say about everything that had just happened. Thor left, and Clint and Natasha did as well, speaking quietly to one another, their heads close. Steve stood as well.

“Plenty of normal guys do it every day,” James said evenly. He wondered, for a moment, if this was why Torrun was upset. Was she upset he was leaving? It seemed odd, since they hadn’t seen each other regularly since Torrun was just in middle school. “I’ve got no right to do anything less than them.”
“Oh Steve,” she sighed, and it was part relieved and part fond and part exasperated. He could hear all the colors in it. “You know I’ll always come back

Like Stark, the interior of the plane was all about style. It was all very tasteful and very fancy, with leather seats, a flat screen TV, and even a dining area. Senator Stark sat in one of the large leather chairs, a brandy already in his hand.

Good, of course, was the last thing that Steve felt as he looked at Tony. He couldn’t read his expression well, but it looked unbelieving. Did Steve need to do more than that to apologize? He wasn’t sure he was willing to. He’d been right about Tony’s recklessness. He wasn’t about to apologize for their argument overall—just that it had gotten more heated than it should have.
There were a lot of things that simple question made him want to do. He wanted to laugh hysterically. He wanted to cry. He wanted to scream in rage and flip over the table. Was he ok? Was he ever?
Oh, who was Steve kidding. They were playing a very delicate game, and only time would tell whether or not it would end up a deadly one for either side.
Well, the superpowers might surprise her but the other part didn’t. Peter was Steve’s son, through and through, in ways that James wasn’t. Of course he would want to follow the legacy and be a superhero. She had worried that he would follow that path anyway—build his own suit if she refused to give him one, or invent something new and run into the field with it, wholly unprepared. Tony supposed that she should really be happy—at least this way he had a healing factor and superhuman strength. At least he wouldn’t go into battle with all the vulnerable points she had when she first started out. But still the thought of Peter in the field made her throat clench and her stomach churn. She could handle the idea of Kate out there. She hated it, but she could

“And embarrass the kid? Nah,” Tony said. “He’ll be fine.”
“What? No, it’s not—she loved you. She adored you. She didn’t say a single word against you. I think it was pretty clear just by talking to her for five minutes that she was more in love with you than I’ve ever been with anyone in my life,” Tony said. 3490 Steve regarded him with an unreadable expression. “But—I just—I thought you should know that she was pregnant. Two months, I think she said. Or maybe it was three. I don’t remember.” 3490 Steve sat down on the bed. Tony felt awkward. He didn’t know what to do. So Tony did what he did best—he just kept talking.

. A weird, tiny part of him that he didn’t quite understand, wasn’t ready yet to say goodbye to all of this. But then he felt Steve’s hand on his shoulder, a reassuring presence at his back.
“Speaking of getting dressed, I think I ought to,” 3490 Steve said, putting down his fork, pushing his chair out and standing up. He kissed his wife on the cheek and then left. As soon as he was gone, 3490 Tony gave a wry smile to the Alts.
“So, if this isn’t your place or your thing—what are you doing here?”
So Tony followed the kid all the way back to his room. Peter didn’t even notice, which was probably a testament to how distracting the pain must be as Tony wasn’t exactly sneaking. Tony leaned up against the doorframe of his not-son’s room. The kid hadn’t bothered to shut the door and was in the process of taking his shirt off, facing the other direction. He hissed as he did so, and Tony could see why. Even from the back he could see the edge of a large, dark bruise.
“Wouldn’t have been my first choice as a border collie substitute, but what do you know, he could be winning championships,” Tony said. As the breach closed up he lifted the face plate and grinned at Steve and Steve huffed a laugh back.

“Do you think next he’s going to tell us how he traveled through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest, past the sea of twirly-swirly gum drops and though the Lincoln Tunnel?”
If Steve was being honest, he’d have to say that he never would have thought that Senator Stark would run for
Yet just barely he could hear the voices. He wasn’t meaning to eavesdrop, but he also didn’t want to interrupt by making his presence known. They were just around the corner. Steve peeked over to see who it was. Kate had her arms around Francis’ neck, but he was gently extricating himself from her grasp.

“God fucking damn it,” Antonella swore, shutting the door behind her and marching over to the liquor cabinet. “Why are we so fucking similar?” Tony sat in one of the cozy leather armchairs, still writing out plans and equations, trying to get all the math right for his secret project. Obviously, he was working on paper, which probably would have been suspicious if Antonella weren’t obviously already distracted, if she hadn’t been distracted and distraught for days. She pulled out a crystal glass with force, popped the top on a wine bottle, and poured. She took a sip.
“Nothing. Give him his privacy. Let him cool off,” Tony replied.

“Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes? I do know him, actually. Good man,” Steve said. And he was. He was a good man, easy going, always good for a laugh. Steve had met him twice: once with Bucky, once without. That seemed to be the way Steve measured things in life, now: with and without, before and after.
“I killed someone,” Peter said hoarsely. “I didn’t mean to. I just wanted him to lose his balance. I webbed him in the back of the head and I pulled too hard and—he died. I killed him. How do I—what do I—“ Peter struggled for words. He didn’t know what he wanted or needed. His head was buzzing and his stomach was still turning. He couldn’t think properly.

. He opened up the back door and rushed inside. He went up the stairs to Kate and Peter’s room. He knew exactly which teddy was Teddy for Kate. It was a mangy looking thing with one eye and a little black mask. It had been James’ once upon a time, and before that James thought it was his dad’s. He wasn’t sure. He grabbed Teddy and rushed back down the stairs. He was in the kitchen when he heard the door open.

And yet.
about being a mother—seeing that look on his face? It was so worth it. So very worth it.” Antonella grabbed her sparkling juice again and sipped at it.
Peter just stared at him for a moment. It was weird, seeing his mother’s features on a guy. Or rather, it was weird seeing
“No, my other one.”
“Steve, if you’d let me explain—”

Tony watched her daughter from a distance as she sat in her room, doing her homework at the white desk that had been in her room since she was six years old. Kate tucked a lock of her long dark hair back behind her ear as she referenced something in a textbook. Kate was smart. She had always been incredibly intelligent, even if Tony was ashamed to say she often gave Peter more credit on that front. Peter liked the sciences, had an

He’d never felt more helpless.

Peter blinked in surprise and realized there were, indeed, booklets and pens stashed in the holders on the backs of the pew that held the hymnals. He didn’t reach for one. A favorite memory of his mother? How could he pick just one? How could he stash a lifetime of loving family memories into a booklet in the back of a pew? Kate stoically handed him a tissue, and Peter realized with some surprise that his cheeks were wet.
the bedroom was amiss.) Usually, Steve found himself drawing Bucky. Over and over again he’d draw him, in every pose and with every conceivable expression. But lately he’d found himself drifting away from his favorite subject. It was because it was easy, Steve told himself—it was easy to draw Tony, because he was usually there to see. He drew Tony working in the lab, Tony playing basketball, Tony drinking coffee, Tony in a meeting (playing on his stark phone), Tony talking to Pepper—because that was what he could see, Steve insisted silently.
“I heard about Tony. I’ll believe it when I see it. That woman has a way of appearing at the most inconvenient times just when you think she’s gone,” Fury said. Steve very near punched him. His hand

“They’re lovely,” Steve eventually agreed, politely. He didn’t know how to tell her that he would rather she left, didn’t know how to tell her he just wanted to be alone.
The avengers could hear maniacal laughter coming from the hallway.
Unaware of the storm raging inside her head, her double had decided to sit beside her. They could hear the doorbell ringing and the door opening and closing as Peter, Kate, and Francis manned their stations for Halloween. They could hear the screams whenever Peter surprised a group of older kids by jumping down from the ceiling. The television was also going, stuck on CNN. Steve had been around, but inevitably he had gotten called in for duty—there was trouble with a mutant party raging at House of M, the most exclusive club, solely for mutants, in the city. Other Pepper had been around as well, reading a book and sipping her tea, but she’d disappeared at some point, probably to find somewhere a bit quieter. So it was just Tony alone on the couch until her double sat down.

“WHAT DID YOU DO?” his father demanded of the other man. “WHY ARE THEY AFTER YOU? YOU TELL ME BEFORE YOU GET US ALL KILLED!”
“Let’s hope tonight remains our ETA,” Steve said. “And if not…we’ll regroup from there.” No one seemed to want to think of the ‘if not’ scenario, least of all Steve. First he was trapped in time, now he was trapped in an alternate universe. He really didn’t have the best of luck.
“No, not exactly, of course not, I just meant—I’m grieving too, Peter, and—“
“Actually, I do know that,” Peter replied. He felt hollow. “Whatever type of explosive went off on the 91

pleased at how fast they had managed to subdue the agents, and with minimal injury to their own people—until Peter had run to Billy, yelling about James.
“No, my other best friend.”
“He’d have meant you needed to be medicated, huh? Well, it’s not surprising. I didn’t get along with my Steve at first, either,” Tony admitted. Other Steve looked at her with an intensity that made Tony a bit uncomfortable. Had it been her Steve, she would have jumped him on the spot, but this wasn’t her Steve, and it was difficult to remember that.
“Hey, go easy on me, Spock, it’s been a good thirty years since I’ve set foot in the mansion,” Tony joked. 3490 Steve eyed him for a moment, in a way that didn’t make Tony feel entirely comfortable. It was like he knew something, or was guessing something, about Tony that Tony didn’t feel like Steve—3490 or not—had any right to know.
“Happily married for ten years now,” 3490 Tony said proudly. She did seem quite proud about it, too. She boasted a bright smile and looked up adoringly at her handsome husband. It was all very strange. Tony couldn’t fathom being in the same situation—married, living in the mansion, having two kids… It was not something Tony had ever considered seriously.
I’m a horrible mother, you called me careless and neglectful and—shit, Steve, maybe I am but that’s why I
“I can see you—now what?” Peter asked. He yelped as he narrowly avoided a kick from Clint by dropping to the ground and rolling, hitting his shoulder again as he went.
. She could do something to help them. And she wasn’t.
“Well, actually, I’m signed on with the army, so, I kind of do,” he said. Kate felt hot, angry tears welling in her eyes.
“I’m not a hero,” James said. “I haven’t done anything heroic.”
“Yeah, you’re right, the Adonis factor has been ruined completely. Seven years in the nineties did what seventy in ice never could,” Tony said. Steve grinned and Tony smiled back, but then her smile slowly disappeared. “Seriously, though? Are you afraid of getting old?” Steve looked up at the sky, filled with beautiful stars. Those same stars would not be there for his children. Light pollution would eventually ruin the scenery. But in that moment, it was beautiful. Romantic, even. He tried, in that moment, not to think of it that way, but he was failing spectacularly. It had been a year and six months months since Bernie had left him. He had loved her. But maybe she had been right. Maybe he hadn’t loved her as much as she deserved.

There was silence once again, and Francis held his breath. He had no idea which way this crowd was going to go. He was afraid that they were all about to shrug and head back inside the boardinghouse. For a second, Francis thought that their whole trip would have been a waste. But then Ava Ayala stepped forward.
“Kate, listen, I’m not trying to stop you, ok? I’m just trying to figure out the best way to get him back, all right? I’m not sure you can convince him right now. And I know I can’t,” Steve said gently. His eyes flicked, almost unwillingly, towards Tony. Despite how brief the move was, Tony caught it, as did many of the others in the room.

“Hm,” double Pepper answered. “Well I hope so, because—” At that moment, mature Tony came running into the room, wet, wavy hair streaming behind her. She was dressed only in yoga pants and a tank top as opposed to the usual fashionable clothing Pepper had seen her in. Mature Tony ducked behind Double Pepper, grabbing onto her shoulders as Steve entered the room at a jog.
that!” Antonella’s tone was wounded. Her voice cracked in the middle.
“You’re right about that,” he said. He started to walk towards the door. “I’ll let Natasha know that you’re up. Is there anyone else I can get for you? Anyone I can call?”
“Uh, actually we might not be, Steve,” other Tony—who was, as were all of the Tonys Tony had met so far, a guy—looked down at his piece of equipment which looked not unlike a smartphone. He looked up at those of 3490 staring at them with a charming smile, which Tony knew meant he was nervous. “Seems we’re having an issue with the juice—he’s already moved on to 7458, but we can’t get to the next grid point just yet…our device has to recharge first.”
“What do you know about what’s happening?” Natasha asked.

“Very astute observation Mr. Stark,” Steve replied dryly.

It was strange. He knew he’d have to keep an eye on his younger double when the alts had fallen into their laps, but he’d thought the eye he’d be keeping would be one of sympathy. Tony had informed him how he had just left the ice two years earlier (though really, Steve would have figured that out for himself very quickly), and all of Steve’s feelings from back then came flooding back. He figured his younger self might be able to use a guiding hand, might need an ear from time to time. He had completely ignored the possibility that he would have to

“Peter go put your clothes on and get ready,” 3490 Tony said.
“Morning Steve,” Clint said over her shoulder. Kate pulled away from the hug and looked up at her dad, who was, bleary-eyed, pouring himself a cup of coffee.
“Good, then you know this is one of mom’s designs pre-Extremis. It has since been integrated but stripping that code isn’t too difficult. You’ll still have JARVIS as a co-pilot, though, I can’t root him out of there, and I wouldn’t even if I could,” Kate said. The encryption screens disappeared from the tablet, and Kate set it down. She removed the hardwires from the tablet and Mark 42. She tapped on the chest plate, and the armor opened up, allowing space for Tony to step inside. For a moment he hesitated. It was one thing, to step into an armor of his own design and go flying through the air—it was another thing entirely to rely on someone
“I guess it’s different for guys. I had to tell Mom to get on the pill,” she said. Peter wrinkled his nose.

“Yeah. Yeah, actually—um,” Tony had difficulty finding his next words, which was rather unusual for him because normally he was
Steve felt his hopes soaring at the sight of his son there at the table. He’d come of his own freewill, without having been asked or coaxed or coerced or even expected. Perhaps his strategy was working—give him space to stretch his wings, and inevitably he’d fly back home when the day was done. Steve prayed it was so. James stood and shook his hand as Steve came to the table. It wasn’t a hug, but Steve would take it. James had always treated him with a degree of formality, due in large part to his military upbringing, but also due to the fact that Steve and his son had never developed a strong bond, at least not as strong a bond as Steve wanted. Hell, it wasn’t even half as strong as the relationship he had with Peter. He hated that. But, at this time, he would take what he could get. James showing up at the mansion, shaking his hand—that was thrilling, really.
“He’d been trying to warn you,” Kate realized. Alt Tony had seen whatever the agent had in his hand and known what it was. It was unlike her father not to pay any attention. Kate approached the building, trying to ascertain where the entrance had been. She couldn’t see it. The building had fallen to its foundation. It would be impossible, forget too dangerous, to go inside. If Peter had been anywhere but the roof or the basement, he was dead.

“What do you mean, our designation?” This time it was Other Steve who spoke up. Tony turned her gaze to him. It was bizarre, seeing her husband but

“Natasha,” Steve said automatically.
“Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. I should have thought about—they said you all only had six Avengers back in your world, but I didn’t think about—you know, Steve, it’s a long story,” Bucky said, stumbling over himself. There was something different about him. Of course there would be—they were separated by universes and by years and years of age—but Steve felt like it was something

“Never have I ever had sushi,” was Betty’s contribution, which made
“Hey. Take it easy. The kid’s going to be fine,” Steve reassured him. Peter had popped in earlier to let them know that James had woken up. Tony had been pretty horrified to see James in that tunnel in the state he was. He was almost surprised that he was alive.
“Because Stark Industries doesn’t perform any genetic experiments and Oscorp does and this is for my biology class?” Peter answered.
. She couldn’t even identify the look he was giving her, though that may have been more due to the fact that it was getting harder to see through the tears than her inability to read her husband’s expressions.
As if they’d been listening to Steve all their lives, everyone pealed off on his order. Steve sent the rest of them off in two different directions, hitting Hydra from the front and both sides, leaving them nowhere to go but back from whence they’d come. The breach was still open; Steve hadn’t seen a lot of them stay open for more than a split second, and it unnerved him to see it hovering there still, a rip in the multiverse just hanging open like a bloody, open wound, two worlds bleeding into each other and making it hard to distinguish which was which at the edges. Beyond, he could see buildings like the ones he remembered raiding back in the day—weapons factories, he figured.
“PULL BACK! EVERYONE GET BACK, AND DON’T LET THEM TOUCH YOU!” James called out. Natasha for once felt no need to question his orders. They fell back so that they could regroup for new orders—but Natasha really had no idea how you fought a Frost Giant. Loki didn’t exactly count.

“I’m kind of glad you didn’t,” he admitted. “I might’ve chickened out. Told Dad over the phone about Dwyer. Then he would’ve come storming onto the base and made a scene, so. Better this way.”

“I suppose that’s it then. All we can do for now. Fine. I’ll let 199999 get some sleep,” Tony said. She knew they must be tired. From their conversations she had gleaned that they had been in a battle shortly before arriving, and who knew how long any of them had been up before then. She was almost fond of the alternates, even as wary as she was around them. They had a certain innocence. It led, she thought, to naivete, but Tony found charm in it anyway.
“How’s everybody holding up in here?” Dad asked. There were shrugs and murmurs of “fine” and similar sentiments. This safe house wasn’t underground—it was in what had appeared from the outside to be an abandoned building, but was really quite a lovely apartment. There were more bedrooms—though everyone still had to share with at least one other person—and enough beds for everyone to have their own. There were windows that looked out into the world, though technology prevented anyone from being able to see inside. It had been a while since they’d had any communication with the Avengers on the outside beyond a few short messages via an encrypted line.

“You ok, Cap?” Tony asked. “You’re catching flies and getting all glassy eyed.” Steve blinked, suddenly drawn back to the real world. He shut his mouth, which
“If you’re going to come back, please make sure no one wants to destroy the multiverse when you do it, next time,” Kate added. Peter elbowed her.
By popular consensus that no one had spoken, the alternate Avengers met in the kitchen after breakfast for a meeting. 3490 Tony and Steve had both left for the Triskelion, and the kitchen seemed the most obvious meeting place. The other potential spot was the living room, but the potential for someone to turn on the television and therefore cause a derailment of the meeting was too high, so the kitchen it was. When they all sat, the Avengers looked to him.
Alts. He felt rage building inside him. To hell with his mission, to hell with his father’s stupid orders—if he had any brains, he’d be shutting the door and sending them packing off to the AIM agents himself.
It was a relief when the Avengers of Earth 525 showed up. Their job would be done twice as quickly. Tony was eager to get home to little Peter and Kate, just three years old, as she hadn’t seen them at all that day. Tony was in the air, fighting off an insistent little doombot and keeping an eye on Steve who was on the ground, when something weird happened. Steve got hit with his shield.

lecture from Mom and Dad, and grounding from anything fun at all for a month. She was also instructed to apologize to Jeanne for having used unnecessary force and abused her powers. Kate thought that was a bit of a cruel joke; Jeanne had gotten what she wanted, and Kate was going to have to apologize for it on top of that. But she went along with her punishments quietly, because she knew that she deserved it.
Thanks for reading, everyone. This is just a brief notice that this story will be taking a quick hiatus at the end of May following the conclusion of Part One of this story. This hiatus should be no more than a month, and hopefully less than that. This is to give me a bit of catch-up time with writing. After that, the chapters will be posted on Tuesdays and Fridays as normal once again. Thank you!
“Maybe,” Steve agreed. “We’re not sure about that, yet. But I don’t think she’d lie to us about something like that.”

“Prove it!” Lewis Barton, who was on the other couch with his brother Callum and Nathaniel Richards, practically bounced up and down in his seat. Lewis was only six, and Callum and Nathan, at 10 and 12 respectively, looked almost as enthusiastic.

Peter stood next to his twin, talking with Torrun, Francis, and James. Torrun was eighteen, tall, muscular, brilliant, and had thick blonde hair that reached her waist. Peter wasn’t sure he’d ever met someone so effortlessly confident in his life. Kate was confident, sure, but she had her weak spots and her vanities. Torrun, on the other hand, genuinely had no insecurities—at the very least none that Peter had ever noticed. She was very much like Thor, and everyone loved her. Torrun, in turn, loved everyone. Although, Peter had to admit, she was loving Francis a bit too much for Kate’s tastes at the moment. His sister’s left hand was balled into a fist so tight her nails must be digging painfully into her palm as Torrun freely flirted with the archer. Torrun also flirted freely with James, but Kate seemed to take her words with Francis as a personal affront. Oh, Peter was not equipped to deal with relationship drama at Christmas.

“I think this merits more than a talking-to,” Steve said seriously.
a logical explanation. Steve would say he was just being paranoid if it hadn’t been for his own Tony’s discovery. They were clearly just very good at covering their tracks, and Steve found that disturbing.
“Ten fingers, otherwise known as ‘Never-have-I-ever’,” Tony replied cheerily. There was a groan from their own Clint.

“I say we make a break for it,” Natasha said. All of the 3490 kids were in bed, except for James and Azari, who had gone down to the gym on the lower level. The safe house was small—it had three tiny bedrooms, two bathrooms, a little kitchen, a small living room with a couch and a television (unconnected to any channels, but there was a DVD player and a small bookcase of DVDs), and an equally tiny gym in the basement. It had clearly been designed for just a few SHIELD agents, and not for much of an extended stay. The 3490 kids had crammed into the bedrooms, leaving the living area for the MCU Avengers and co to settle down in. Steve wished James and Azari would sleep, but he figured they were too wound up to rest. Either that, or they were watching them on security monitors hidden on the lower level—given their little standoff at the entrance, Steve wouldn’t be surprised. James clearly didn’t trust MCU farther than he could throw them, and Steve couldn’t blame him. This was somehow their fault, Steve knew. He just wished he knew

“THAT IS SO UNFAIR!” Kate’s voice bled into the kitchen. “YOU’RE SUCH A HYPOCRITE—”
“And watch you and Francis make out on the couch? No thanks,” Peter said, wrinkling his nose.
“It’s you,” Tony confirmed, “and it’s only ever going to be you.”
It actually makes him smile.
“Fuck yes.” Tony tells him, and pulls him down into a kiss.
Next time they get back to Wakanda – and the gap is only a month, thank goodness – it’s not for business, despite what Tony’s calendar says. T’Challa, Natasha, Clint, Tony, Sam, Vision and Wanda sit down for dinner.
“You could’ve
. I was wrong, and I never apologised for that. I am sorry, for the choices you were pushed into making, for the situations I had a hand in putting you in, and for not listening when you asked us all to. I am sorry for hurting you, and I hope, given time, I can make that up you, Stark.”
He’d forgotten how much he misses living with the Avengers.
Another thing about dragon hoards; they all have a jewel.
“It would be best if we all stood back.” Thor warned – and with that cue, Tony shifted.
Jarvis was hoard, Maria was hoard, even Obadiah was hoard which Tony understood as much as he resented.
“Hi.” Tony murmured, and Steve’s lips quirked into a sad little smile. Tony raised his hand to brush a thumb across the scratch under Steve’s right eye, and Steve’s eyes fluttered for a moment as he leant into Tony’s hand before catching himself. “This- this really doesn’t bug you at all?” Tony asked, and Steve frowned.
“Right, that I get.”
A year of the Avengers becoming a family again – Pepper and Natasha growing stronger as Natasha works through her past, Coulson returning from nowhere to Clint’s open arms, and Sam following an insult to Bucky with a blown kiss. It’s Vision learning to cook but still messing up because it means Wanda steps closer, it’s Peter asking any of them for help with his homework, and Bruce coming in from the cold.
“They’re extraordinarily rare. Rarer than rare. I would’ve told you impossible but...” Steve looked confused for the briefest second and then his expression went oddly blank.

If things were different, he might’ve gotten some sleep.

of it to be a hoard.” Natasha explained, and then a debate ensued between the two of them and Bruce, caught up in the puzzle and forgetting for a moment that often, dragons kept their hoards a well-guarded secret.
“Hey Tones, catch!” Clint called out, and Tony turned just in time to bite the thrown bit of food out of the air before it smacked him in the snout. Clint whooped.

Coulson had announced them husband and husband,
“You don’t want to be rejected…” Steve finished for him softly. “God… Tony, I’m sorry.”
It’s after that that Tony stops carrying the phone, messages read. He doesn’t want her to have more proof of his heart than she already does.
“Why would you argue with me on this Steve? You can bring back Barnes, and Sam, give our son back his best friends, Thor his brother back, his
The messages remain unread.
Part of him never realised he’d stopped for a moment, back there.
“Of course I’m okay, kid. I’m always okay.
.” He murmured. Bruce laughed.
“Together.” Steve swallows, and it’s not the question Tony had thought it would be. He’s taking what Tony’s offering, without hesitation.
Tony had the
Steve doesn’t know what’s going to happen next. He’s legally Peter’s last remaining guardian, but whether Peter will want him or not… Steve can’t consider. A life without one of them sounds impossible, but without both of them… it’s not something he can do.
“Ask me.” He says, and the shock, the sheer
“I think there was always meant to be more time,” Tony tells him, using the hand Steve’s still holding to tug him closer – and Steve goes, Steve will always go now. Tony draws him in, draws him down, and Steve buries his face in Tony’s neck. “You’d think we’re owed it.” Tony jokes, chokes on it a little, and Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, hugs him tight as Tony wraps his arms around his neck.
It wasn’t their first since the Accords had passed, but it was, perhaps the biggest.
The ring lives in Tony’s bedside drawer.
He knew that he missed
“Just the same,” Natasha told him softly, “stable, and will wake when he does.” Tony whined without his own permission, and buried himself a little further into his blankets. Natasha just watched, and then moved to curl up against his chest – his wings curled round them both automatically when she shoved him to roll onto his back. “Is this okay?” she asked, and Tony nodded.
” Tony demanded. Steve’s heart clenched, but Tony was already leaning up to kiss him before he could explain. Steve was never ever going to turn down the opportunity ever again.
They had reached the pass where the figure had risen up in front of them – recognition had burst into hatred, one of the bright souls flickering madly – but then they knew, whether they had known before or not. That they would not leave to find another way speaks to the broken illusions of each man. Or maybe, simply, that they are tired.

And then she’s gone again. She doesn’t ask how Steve is, and he’s certain she’s already asked the nurses about Peter. It’s all a case of waiting now. Something still eases in Steve. “You here that Peter?” Steve tries to smile. “You brought back a whole

“Not exactly.” Tony told him, and then sighed when he realised this was going to turn into a guessing game.
” he yells, stumbling forward – his fathers both whip around to stare at him.
“Humour me, Steve. Please.” Tony stared him down for a moment (impressive given he was half a foot shorter), and then Steve visibly relaxed as he gave in – Tony hadn’t realised he’d been
– but Tony is- Tony is-
He drops down next to Steve on the sofa, carefully picking a moment where Steve’s pencil is nowhere near the paper so he won’t mess anything up. Tony had had a witty comment on the tip of his tongue when he’d decided on this plan, but now, in the face of Steve’s shock and cautious little smile, all he can do is smile back and get comfy.
“Yes?” he asked, smiling and hoping his traitorous blush wasn’t burning its way across his cheeks.
the right choice.
DEAD SHARON, AND I DON’T NEED A CHECK-UP! I NEED-” he looks away from the determined looking nurse, and stalls. Steve’s heart skips it’s next few beats and immediately starts up a rhythm that would take any one else to an early grave. “You’re alright.” Tony Stark says, breathless relief. Rhodey might be cheering, Natasha might have burst into startled laughter unlike anything Steve’s ever heard before, but Steve’s universe has narrowed down on his husband, miraculously, blessedly, alive.
It completely took Tony by surprise one evening, upon waking to Steve’s gentle hands pulling a blanket over him on the common room couch, to realise that Steve was his jewel.
“Not always though... did you know there’s a dragon who hoards Yosemite?” Tony told him, and delighted in the way Steve’s eyes went wide with wonder.
He slips on the band this time, turning his hand this way and that to watch the light from the window dance over it. The weight of it is nice, obvious without being uncomfortable. Given the circumstances, it feels constrictive, but he doesn’t take it off as he stumbles, box in hand, to find the phone.
“The forest’s life is his hoard... he protects those who enter and often blesses or curses those who leave dependant on their respect. Never gives his true name, rarely shows himself... a good dragon. Prideful.” Tony told him, and Steve’s face split into a grin, whatever sadness that had been lingering dispelled.

they knew. The entire active line-up had piled out to deal with him, Steve calling the shots and old patterns fallen into like slipping on a pair of well-worn boots.
Maybe he’ll even tell Steve as much, instead of just letting it become a day dream.
“Does he make you happy?” Rhodey asks, and Tony hopes his sincerity shows in his eyes because he can’t help but reply;
It’s not nearly been long enough, but it’s a start.
“Okay, let’s go find some kids.” Steve almost directed him to where he’d ditched Bucky and Clint with Sam and his nephews, but knowing they were going to be walking past him, he kept his head down.
“Maybe you would- tell me about it? Sometime. I know so little of dragons.” She confessed, and Tony nodded slightly, swallowing.
Steve gets up, ignoring how even his body aches at how long he’s been still, and sticks his head out of the room door – and surely they can all hear it now.

her—which, of course, they didn’t. They knew another her, one that wasn’t even a her, and it irked Tony that these people were likely basing opinions of her on someone who she wasn’t, someone she couldn’t control. Nevertheless, she stood at the head of the dinner table, with both her family and the alternate avengers present, ready to deliver the bad news. She cleared her throat.

Dinner was all together uneventful. James did in fact show up, and his and Francis’ mutual (friendly) insults were rather entertaining, especially considering the fact that they had to avoid saying swear words or anything particularly filthy if they didn’t want Steve’s older counterpart—who Steve had taken to thinking of simply as the Commander—to box their ears. Francis resorted to calling James a ‘tragic son of a rocky road ice cream cone’ to which James responded that Francis was ‘nothing but a low down banana split sundae without nuts on top’. One thing was for certain—this argument in no way resembled any of the ones James had shared with Peter. There was no real venom in their ridiculous insults, and they both seemed to take great joy in it.

James would later not entirely recall what happened. He only knew that one moment, his brother was spewing abuse to his face, and the next moment he had him pinned up against the wall with his forearm, his little sister screaming at him to let him go, a bunch of people shouting, and a supersoldier at his back, trying to pull him off.

“Peter that was
“Does that count for me too?” Azari asked, a complaint in his voice.
“N-Y-M-A,” Peter spelled out, his mouth half-full of cereal. He chewed and swallowed before continuing. “New York Military Academy. S’where James went.” Tony stared at him blankly. None of this meant much to him.
“Camp Lehigh,” MCU Fury had told them when they had caught up to him. He had been keeping his head low, living as a homeless man after the attack on Stark Tower threw SHIELD into confusion. He had hoped to get away and do some sleuthing himself. He’d made it to Jersey, where they had tracked him.
Tony Stark did not blush. He would never admit such a fact to anyone or even to himself. So Tony Stark was decidedly not turning red at that comment.
“We could have put her in a center! We could have gotten her a psychologist, a sponsor,
It was too much for her to process, and her brain could process a lot. But the possibilities reeled in her mind. Herself as a man? That was easy enough to imagine. But life without Steve? She could hardly bear the thought. He’d only been off the ice just two years and it was

“Well, yeah,” James said. “That’s where I can do the most good.” Torrun just stared at him, then shook her head.

They were silent again for a few minutes. Antonella finished her sparking grape juice and poured another glass. Tony was at a loss for words. He shut the notebook he had been working in.

“You—we—” Steve said in between kisses and gasps of air, “—should talk—about this?”

“Hey Mom, I don’t think we have any eggs,” he said, but his mother was still engaged with the older Captain. Peter sighed with exasperation. He could see the faces of the astounded Alts, and he rolled his eyes in their direction. “Yeah, they do this all the time. It’s awful.” He cupped his hands over his mouth, forming a temporary megaphone. “MOM WE’RE OUT OF EGGS.” 3490 Tony broke from Steve Rogers’ embrace briefly.
him, because Peter’s so scrawny and dorky and artistic, but he’s still made such an impact on the world already. He’s so fucking proud.” She laughed and shook her head. Steve just let her talk, continuing his sketch, afraid that to say anything would break the moment. She would realize any minute who she was talking to and stop speaking, he was sure, and he wanted to delay that as long as possible. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, Dad absolutely adores me. But I haven’t done anything to
“Action’s down here, Capsicle,” Tony said.
Finally they reached the river. Natasha glanced over to James, wondering what the boy had in mind. It was odd; he was only a few years younger than the Steve she knew, and yet he was plainly still a child. That was the effect of war she supposed. She wondered if the boy captain would still be a child at the end of these battles. Already he looked more worn than he had upon their first meeting.

“She uh—she wanted to tell you. But she—she wasn’t sure if Extremis would affect the fetus…I don’t think she wanted to worry you. And then she said there just—wasn’t a good time and of course when I was talking to her you were—well. So yeah. Uh. I’m sorry. I just—I thought you should know. In the spirit of honesty and trust and transparency and all that. And also because, you know. I guess that’s the decent thing to do. Um. Can I—do you need anything? Do you want me to go?” Tony got worried when Steve put his head in his hands. He looked up, one hand still covering his mouth.
“She’s young, she’s rebellious, she’s impressionable, hell maybe she’s trying to prove some kind of point,” Antonella said. 3490 Steve just shook his head.
universe and—Tony wasn’t sure he could keep up with these emotions. He broke their eye contact and returned to looking at his plans.
“Why tell us?” Steve asked, though he already knew the answer.
“Do they have pastrami?” he asked. Steve found the swiss, took it out of the fridge, shut the door, and shrugged. If Tony wanted a sandwich he’d have to scavenge for it himself. Tony looked a bit put out, and Steve could not fathom the audacity of that emotion given the present context. He set about assembling his sandwich. Tony got the pastrami out of the fridge.
“We’ve got this,” Tony said, just as Steve replied,
his wife’s intentions slowly dawned, and he couldn’t be happier. His wife was, after all, a genius. She had, Steve guessed, kicked everyone out and told them without mincing words exactly why she wanted them gone. Still, Steve was so content with his day that he didn’t find himself in the least embarrassed by it. While he preferred a bit of discretion there wasn’t, after all, anything to be ashamed of. So even when Other Tony walked in to the kitchen, where Steve was making coffee and reading through classified documents on his tablet, simply to rib him, he could manage only a raised eyebrow, but no blush.
“I didn’t know you were cleared for field duty yet!” Carol practically shouted over the noise. Her face went blank for a moment, and then she shouted into her comm, “No, Rhodes, stay
The last two months had been horrible. Harrowing. Exhausting. But she’d been kept busy, in one way or another, the whole time. She was too tired to think. Too tired to really feel. The whole ordeal felt surreal, and while she desperately wanted to be done with it, she also didn’t want to go back to her usual life. If she went back to her usual life, if things slowly got back to some semblance of normal, she was going to have to face it all over again, and face it fully this time: her mother was dead, her father was a mess, and her life and her own person had been irrevocably altered by it all.

“Squid? Seriously?”
“Peter go help the others,” Bruce said. Peter glanced at James, then Bruce, then left. The Avengers and the young avengers were standing in formation near the door. Steve was quietly giving orders as the pounding continued. It was a maddening sound. Bruce knew that Steve was planning a surprise attack, to open the door before they managed to knock it down—he just hoped they could keep the fight away from him and James, or the boy would never make it.
“But you sent the boys back too!”
“This will all be over soon enough,” she said. “Before you know it, honey.” Steve just smiled back at his wife, but privately he thought nothing could be soon enough unless it was

It was then, for Steve, that the penny dropped and the dam burst, and with a laugh that was also a half choked sob, he put his arms around his wife and pulled her close, his head falling to her shoulder as he cried. She ran a hand through his hair and gripped him back tightly.

for people who don’t even give two shits about it! I am so done with that! You know in the end, it’s just going to be me and Peter. Just me and Peter and no one else, because you’ll all be dead from incurable stupidity!” Kate could feel the tears falling onto her cheeks, but she didn’t give a damn. She didn’t care that James’ expression was one of shock at her outburst, didn’t care that she probably just sounded like a hormonal teenage girl on her period, didn’t care that the stupid alternate Avengers were a few feet away and probably heard their whole conversation. She just didn’t care anymore. She spun on her heel and stormed out of the room before James could say anything more. If she had stayed, she would have heard Tony mutter to his fellow Avengers,
His dad, Peter figured, must be feeling like that now. Everyone was going to leave and help. He’d be alone in this bunker, listening in on the comms and just waiting for everyone to come back, to pull through. Peter didn’t really like the idea of his dad with that vacant look in this cold bunker all alone.
A bomb blew up the car Kate was crouched atop—she had to leap from it and roll to avoid the attack. Peter, dressed in a black suit SHIELD had made up for him specifically for agility and soaring through the air, had to avoid bright little bullets that looked like lasers. It looked like something out of
“You told him—? Oh. Oh, I see. He—didn’t take it well, I gather?” Steve asked. He felt a bit guilty.

Because then it’s going to be that much more painful when what we know is already confirmed,” Tony pointed out. “We need to look at reality in the face, not hope for something better that we can’t have.” He picked up the spoon and gulped down another bite of the awful concoction. He tried not to think how long this particular can of Campbell’s had been sitting in the cabinet. Tony felt tense and sick and awful, but he knew that he had to eat

“You set a date and we’ll be there,” Steve said. “The sooner the better for all of us.” Commander Rogers smiled, and it took all of Steve’s strength to smile back and not punch the other man in the face.
Tony looked around at the team. God,

He also found himself getting exceedingly cranky since he had yet to poke around in 3490 Tony’s workshop. He’d have to ask her when she got back today. He wasn’t above getting down on his knees and begging at this point—it was only Friday and he was going crazy.
“You’re on the front lines aren’t you?”
“So pull your heads out of your asses before you get us all killed,” Nat finished, and then headed to the ladies’ locker room, the door clicking shut behind her. Tony felt stricken. Steve looked stricken. Clint and Thor just shrugged and headed into their own locker room, but Steve and Tony stayed outside the door. Tony felt the urge to scratch at the back of his head, but he hadn’t removed the armor yet, only the faceplate.
“Whatever Steve decides is more effective,” she said. “But I assume he will, in fact, just talk to him.”

“So what do we do about that?” Steve asked in an undertone, still looking at the door.
“Why are you always such an ass?” Steve groaned.

Bruce could tell him that. And now that he was actually thinking it, it wasn’t a half bad idea. But… he wasn’t sure if he
“The both of you make us all look bad,” Natasha commented as soon as they were out of the room. Steve looked at her in surprise, but she just raised an eyebrow and folded her arms. “We need to present a

“Uh-huh, whatever, just play lookout for a minute,” Tony said, looking over the insides. He saw a tell-tale blue and something in the pit of his stomach dropped.

with that expression. She moved up slightly and pressed a kiss to his lips.
“Touche,” Tony replied. He took another sip of the brandy and closed his eyes. “Even in this universe, they keep the good stuff here.”
“It wouldn’t be the first time Heimdall had a blindspot Loki managed to exploit,” Natasha pointed out.
“And just
“I know. I know. God, do I know,” Dad sighed. “But Peter she would be so proud of you. I know—I know this has to have been hard and frightening and horrible for you, but you’ve done so well. You helped get all the kids here safely. I know it’s going to be hard, but I need you to keep going, Peter. I need you to keep your wits about you, keep it together. Just for now.
