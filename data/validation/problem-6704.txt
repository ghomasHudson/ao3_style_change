Clint tried not to laugh at the panic on Steve’s face. He dropped back down on the couch, trying to be reassuring. “I mean, it’s not bad…”
“What I meant was, seeing as you probably haven’t eaten in…however long, how ‘bout I take you out for some real food? You can tell me about what other crazy stuff you have around here.”
With a huff, he sat up, swinging his legs out of bed. Blearily wiping the sleep from his eyes, Tony got up and slowly stumbled down the hallway. Stepping into the living room, his senses were assaulted from all sides as he realized that his previously pristine room now looked like a department store Christmas display.
“Ok, Tony” Steve said, lifting up his briefcase. He looked for somewhere to set it down so he could pull out all the paperwork, but every flat surface seemed to be covered. Stacks of papers, blueprints, tools and bits of machinery…he wasn’t sure what most of the stuff was.
Tony headed off to their room to get dressed, dragging his feet a bit, hoping Steve would get some food in her before he got back. Alas, when he reappeared in the kitchen, the food was still packaged and lying on the counter. He stood back watching Steve spin the little girl around, earning himself a small smile. As much as he disliked kids, it did warm his heart to see Steve so good with them.
Red and green garland looped along the doorframes and stockings were hung across the mantel above the fireplace, which was lit with a roaring fire. A Nativity scene was carefully laid out on a side table next to the couch and, as Tony sniffed the air, he could swear he smelled cookies baking.
He wasn’t happy about getting shut down, but Tony nodded in agreement. Throwing his arms up in exasperation, he groaned “So how do I do this?”
“How do I even do that? What if he doesn’t feel the same way? Maybe it’s too soon. I should wait for him to say it first. I don’t want to freak him out” Tony rambled, chewing his lip nervously.
Tony took the mug, noticing that even it was Christmas-covered, red and green snowflakes sprinkled across the white ceramic. “So, you like Christmas, huh?”
“It’s up to you. I’d never pass up having you with me though” Steve said quietly, glancing down to see if she was still awake. She was, but just barely, and as Tony squeezed in behind Steve, they scooted over to give him some more room. Tony threw his arm around Steve, giving him a squeeze.
“Sure, sounds great” Tony finally answered. “But what about these?” he asked, shaking the papers in the air towards Steve.
“No worries. I could have sold off a lot of this stuff, but everyone wants the intellectual rights and everything that goes along with that. And I don’t want to give up control of them. They’re like my babies, I guess.”
“Great, thanks.” Steve found a brush and startled untangling her curls, squeezing out the little bit of water that was left in her hair. Together they watched Tony come back in with an armful of blankets and unfold them carefully, creating a cozy little spot for her on the floor. Dragging the comforter off the bed, he folded it up to make a bed for Steve, tossing his pillow down on top of it.
“I guess” Steve said, looking around the apartment, “maybe it would be easiest if you took me around and showed me everything that you sent in a claim for.” Everywhere he looked there seemed to be a workbench, end table, or desk set up, covered in papers and metal bits. There appeared to be a robot of some sort in one corner, a chemistry set in another, and multiple computer screens set up just off the kitchen.
Steve just shrugged his shoulders. “I thought I’d see what all the hype was about. I still think it’s strange to post everything about your life online for millions of people to see. But maybe that’s just me.”
“Hey Cap, whatcha doing?” Clint asked, plopping onto the couch next to Steve. He couldn’t help but smile at the way Steve was staring at his phone so intently, scrolling through photos on the screen.
Taking Steve’s hand, Tony pulled him to the door and flung it open, impatient to get to his bedroom. A piece of paper fluttered down from where it had been hastily taped. Steve grabbed it, reading the note over before handing it to Tony with a smirk.
“Steve, I— I love you.” He stared at the floor and Steve could feel him tensing up, no doubt waiting for the rejection he always expected.
When no one responded, Tony glanced at their faces. Bruce’s mouth hung open while Clint had a shit-eating grin plastered across his face. The smallest smile played at the corner of Natasha’s lips and Tony’s face went white.
“You’ll be ok” Steve said, seeing the look on his face. “It’s not hard. We just feed her, play with her, make sure she doesn’t get hurt. Simple enough.”
“Ok, it’s not great” Clint laughed. “But maybe he won’t even notice. God know what kind of things he has happening on that phone of his, I’m sure Instagram isn’t at the top of his priorities. How many pictures did you like?”
“You know” Natasha interrupted, “I hate to agree with him, as we all know that Clint can be a real child sometimes, but I wouldn’t miss this for the world.”
“Steve” Tony said, a hint of desperation in his voice, “I don’t know anything about babies…or kids. How old is it anyway?”
“Cookie?” Steve said, offering Tony a snowman-shaped sugar cookie. “There’s hot chocolate too, though you probably want coffee?”
“No, that’s not what I meant. I mean no, I definitely don’t want to go through all of that, no matter how interesting you make it seem.”
“I don’t think so” Steve said, thinking it over. “We don’t want her to roll off. Maybe on the floor with one of us? So if she gets up and tries to wander off, we’d wake up?”
Clint just raised an eyebrow in response. “Uh huh, and you could tell Stark that you’re mooning over his Instagram, but here we are.”
“Well, enjoy. Just don’t go liking all of his pictures or anything” he joked, gesturing at the phone.
Tony started to speak, wanting to reassure Bruce that he’d find the perfect person for him eventually, but Bruce stopped him before he could begin.
She just stared at him, munching away. Grabbing a few Cheerios for himself, Tony popped them in his mouth. Chewing them he made a face, surprised by the quiet giggle it elicited. Trying it again, he made another face, earning himself another laugh. Just then Steve walked out, beaming at the scene in front of him.
“Not at all. You came up with these crazy wonderful ideas and then actually make them work! Sure, making money off them would probably be great, but they’re yours, you shouldn’t have to just give them up to make a living.
Tony rolled his eyes and Steve snickered again. “Just about. Believe me, this was not how it was supposed to go.”
“I apologize in advance” Tony said, leading him over to the largest work area, situated right in the middle of what should have been the living room. “I’ve always got a lot going on.”
“Oh sure” Tony scoffed, “he’ll just walk in and I’ll say ‘Hey Steve, how’s your day going? I love you.’”
“You can try to unlike some of them? Maybe then he won’t know. Or it could be too late, I really don’t know. Sorry man, good luck.”
“Oh for Christ’s sake! I didn’t know I was going to end up in the middle of Grand Central Station” Tony exclaimed in exasperation.
“It’s ok, I guess. It’s just…a lot of sentimentality, having to buy gifts for people you probably don’t even like, parties you have to go to…”
“First of all, breathe. Calm down. You won’t freak him out and I’m sure he feels the same way, don’t you think?”
They walked into the bathroom where Tony busied himself filling the tub up to an acceptable level while Steve dealt with the much more unpleasant task of cleaning off the little girl before she could get in the tub.
Tony was going to say something else, but was stopped by a whiff of something unpleasant. “Uh, please tell me she wears diapers. Otherwise you’re cleaning off the chair.”
“Yeah, I was going to, but then I saw Stark come in and I couldn’t resist. Had to see how that was gonna play out. Not great, I have to say.” He shrugged. “Plus, anything to put off the paperwork for another few minutes.
Steve walked over to Tony, pretending to glance around furtively. Pulling the waistband of his sweatpants away from his body, he looked down, nodding with his head for Tony to do the same.
“If you keep up this attitude, I’m not going to show you what else I bought” Steve warned, shaking a finger in Tony’s direction.
“Maybe not, but if that’s the case, I’m not in any position to give advice” Bruce shrugged. “At least you’re in a relationship.
, he thought, knowing that this call was due to broken water pipe in the apartment above. Steve took a deep breath, preparing himself for the worst. People never wanted to deal with him or argue over what their insurance covered, not that he blamed them, but it did tend to make them unpleasant.
“I’ll go find something” Tony huffed, going back to the kitchen. The best he could come up with were some small plastic bowls that had been sitting in a cupboard forever.
“Aw man, c’mon, we’re gonna miss the best part” he complained as Natasha grabbed him on the other side and they dragged him toward the door.
Steve stopped to lean against the wall, winded after climbing up five flights of stairs. He set his briefcase down for a moment, caught his breath, and straightened his tie. Feeling a little more put together, he headed down the corridor, peering at the apartment numbers in the dim light.
“C’mere” Steve said simply, walking to meet Tony were he had stopped in his tracks. Turning him around, he lifted Tony’s head to meet his gaze and kissed him softly. “Was there something you wanted to tell me?”
Tony made it back first and was coming out of the shower, thankfully wrapped in a towel, when Steve and their new houseguest arrived. Steve had the girl in one arm and a couple bags of what Tony assumed were supplies.
“Alright, well” Steve began, pulling out Tony’s file, “The company has gone over your claims, but due to…well, the fact that no one knows what this stuff is…they sent me out to clear things up a little.”
“Ah, of course” Steve nodded, trying to look serious. “Well then, we take advantage of their absence.”
“Of course.” Steve walked over, grabbing Tony by the hand and pulling him into the doorway leading out of the kitchen. “Did you notice?” he asked, looking up pointedly.
‘Fine,’ Tony tries his best not to smirk at how much he’s going to inflame the situation, ‘then Loki has to be the one to help me.’
‘My king?’ he looks over at one of the palace attendants who has just entered. ‘Princess Ororo is here to take her leave.’
‘More of a nuisance,’ he replies, voice low. He glances over at her, ‘secret weapon seems to be more your thing. Didn’t I fight you in Germany?’
‘Considering you’ve been sat in those same sessions I have with him for the past few weeks, are you honestly that surprised?’ Bucky’s tone is softer now as he comes to rest on the railing next to him.
‘Hmm,’ Loki gets out of bed and begins his morning routine, picking out a more formal Asgardian outfit that was better suited to the occasion. ‘Has anyone heard from the wizards yet?’
‘Thor you’re already looking rounder and rounder each day. Soon we shall be calling you fat!’ Loki snaps.
‘That’s one way of saying ‘intended kidnapping victim’ I haven’t heard before,’ Rhodes mutters, then starts setting out the plan of attack.
‘No you’d be right there. Alright young man, you’ll do. Now come sit next to me and entertain an old woman, all I hear from these two is technical mumbo-jumbo. I’m hoping a sensible soldier like you can actually talk about something I can understand for a change.’
Loki tries not to let the surprise show on his face as Clint, of all people, hands him a glass. ‘Should I be concerned?’ he teases.
A blinding smile creeps onto Steve’s face, and he puts his other hand up to frame Tony’s face. ‘There you are.’
Peter does as he says, raising his arms up. As the gun lowers a fraction he sets off the shooters, pulling himself up and swinging forwards, sending both the soldier and MJ through the window as it shatters. Releasing one of his webs he fires another that manages to catch her hand, stopping her fall and leaving the soldier to hit the concrete below.
Please do let me know what you thought of this chapter. I'm sorry to any comments I haven't responded to yet, I will be doing them after I have finished uploading everything.
Matt cocks his head to the side, obviously doing his own version of looking around the ice cream parlour. ‘Can we go outside?’
‘Are you two done being all mopey yet?’ Rocket asks, appearing next to them and taking a seat on Bruce’s other side before taking something out of his bag and starting to tinker with it.
Thank you to everyone who has left a comment. I do have an announcement regarding comments over the next few weeks: I'm putting a ban on any mention of what is involved in End Game in comments for the next few weeks until people have had a chance to see the film. Please don't take this as I don't appreciate your comments at all, I'm just very conscious that I don't want any spoilers creeping into the comments, whether I've seen the film or not there's a big likelihood that not all the readers have yet and I don't want anyone to have anything spoiled for them. I know I'd be gutted. If you do leave a comment that has something I would consider a spoiler in it I will delete it - fair warning! If you feel the urge to write something relating to End Game in a comment write: 'I am Groot!' Those of us who have seen it will probably be able to guess what you've said and it won't spoil it for anyone else.
‘The hell I am,’ he snaps. ‘And you don’t outrank me, so I’ll call you whatever the hell I like right now.’
as Peter Parker, and I don’t have to look after him, I’ve just got to support him the same way he does me.
‘-and you only try to look innocent when you’re up to something,’ Bucky cuts across Steve’s response.
Wade’s whole body goes rigid, and the look he turns to Peter almost frightens the teenager, if it wasn’t for the fact his spidey senses haven’t changed their tune. ‘Weasel failed to mention you were there when the two men arrived.’
‘Not yet,’ he shakes his head. ‘Seems like most have managed to get out so far, but we’re stuck down here while there’s all the shooting going on. You know what their target is?’
Where before she’d always been nervous at the thought of testing the limits of her powers, now she felt anticipation. Excitement. She smiles at Vision and creates a small sphere in front of them; when she’s comfortable with it she then starts increasing the amount of power contained in it until she’s at the limit she’s always set herself. ‘This is it,’ she tells Vision, eyes not leaving the sphere in front of her, ‘this is the most I’ve ever controlled before.’
‘Hey kid!’ Wanda tenses at the shout from one of the mercenaries. ‘You owe me a game from last time. I need to win my money back.’
His only response is his friend’s laughter as he opens the door and tells Peter to take some food down to the workshop for Tony.
Until Thanos manages to wrestle his hand free from Peter’s webs and uses his gauntlet to send them all flying backwards. Then he turns to Vision.
‘We’ll be in touch,’ Fury frowns at the merc. ‘We’ve got someone waiting downstairs to take you to your hotel.’
There's a couple of hours of calm before the team have to start their planning. Steve and Tony discuss everything that's happened since their friends returned; Loki and Thor clear the air a bit; and Bucky is still more interested in Peter's choice of boyfriend than the world ending.
‘We said we’d enjoyed it so far,’ Rocket points out, ‘it’s got a long way to go yet before it’s the best thing ever.’
‘Fuck. Do you do this shit every day at school?’ Wade’s fingers are massaging his scalp and Peter feels more of the tension bleeding from his body.
Please do let me know what you think, I want to know if I’m on the right track, or if there’s anything you’d particularly like to see over the course of the story. Thank you so much to everyone who has left kudos and favourited this story so far, I'm so grateful!
‘Well I didn’t exactly trust Vision to cook when you were in hospital. The guy doesn’t have taste buds. No offense, Vis.’
‘In what world do you think you can start lecturing me on keeping things from you considering the discussion we’ve just been having?’ he snarls.
All he gets is a weak smile from Loki in response. ‘We should get moving. If the Jotuns were near us they may make their way out of the rubble soon.’
‘Don’t worry Sam I got us covered,’ Tony says, inputting a few commands into his watch and watching half of his suit and Sam’s wings come flying towards them.
‘What is it?’ he snaps, gesturing towards his guest seated on the other side of the desk to make it clear he’s busy.
Tony doesn’t meet his eyes when he replies. ‘I made it for me.’ The tone of his voice stops Bucky from pressing. ‘It was made before… well everything kicked off with the original Accords; I just tweaked it to help you.’
‘Hey Howard,’ Bucky’s soft voice travels through the quiet as the soldier kneels in front of the two graves. ‘I know I shouldn’t really be here, all things considered, but I needed to see you before I leave again. Looks like I’ve not done a good a job as normal this time, and I’m sorry that means that Steve can’t come back. From what he told me you two had become good friends, and I wanted to thank you for being there for him when he thought I was dead. Not that I repaid you very well for that. Howard, I am so sorry for what I did; I hope you know if I was in control of my mind I never would have done it. I hope you knew that back then.
But Tony finds himself relaxing more in Steve's presence, finds himself liking the way they shoot each other down while also being equals in some ways.
Their time was interrupted when the Avengers' phone rang. Yes, that's right. It was the Captain who insisted that they have a separate, private line that no one could tap into but the Avengers, just in case they were in need of serious help or the other way around.
"Ready for what, V?" Mordo, or rather, Eternity was shocked to hear Ruby shout. "Ready to fight whatever this Sibling shit you have! Is that why you had been showing me visions of what your abilities could do? All along you've been using me! Trying to harness my body so that you could take over once you were strong enough! You know what, V? Fuck you! Fuck you too Mordo! I don't want part with whatever shenanigans you both have!"
"Ground your feet when you punch." Steve advised as he placed a new bag for her. "It keeps you more balanced."
“Hello Sweetheart.” Their attention snapped back to Rogers number 2. “Why don’t you go take a nap first before we get dinner? Have a little rest. All these activities you’ve been doing are quite exhausting to your heart.”
"Up to your rooms, kiddos." Steve ordered and the two proceeded to the elevator with both their heads hung down in defeat. Peter only gave a small sad smile before getting off his floor which Ruby returned with one of her own. Once inside her bedroom, she quickly changed into pyjamas and turned her lamp on before turning off the main switches of her lights. She just tucked herself in to try get some sleep when she heard a soft knock against the glass of her window.
Clint, who was watching the scene along with Natasha and Spidey, sensed that these three idiots would probably fall into a very awkward silence afterwards. Tony and Steve were not really a prime example of people who can speak out their feelings. So being the almighty saviour that he is, he took the monopoly set placed underneath the coffee table.
The Voice called again. This time, it was gentle; beguiling and coaxing her to follow wherever depths of this abyss led to.
If one listened closely, they would hear the slightest tremor in Tony’s voice so with a firm nod, Stephen took a step forward and began to chant a spell that will probe into her mind. If he could manage to access her memories, perhaps, he could pinpoint the exact moment and detail that caused her lack of physical response. Without even digging in too deep, Stephen instantly perceived something different about Ruby.
Sooner rather than later, Ruby let out a deep breath and whined dramatically in exhaustion. "I can't do anymore, Steve. I'm so tired." She claimed as she drank from a bottle of water then in a split second decision, poured the rest onto her head. She squealed in delight upon the refreshing feeling it gave her and Steve couldn't help it but shake his head.
He let out a fake cough to let the lovebirds know that they could have their moment after they rescue the two dumbasses who were supposed to be in school. Sure enough, he received a glare from Steve who knew him inside and out including his antics. Tony, on the other hand, didn't take the cough for anything else but as it is. Instead, he just headed out to go save the day. Naturally, the rest of the team followed.
Ruby's head was resting on Peter's shoulder while his arms snaked around Ruby's shoulder, head tilted back against the headboard. Steve just didn't have the heart to wake them up when they both looked so peaceful and serene. Now that it was almost eight o'clock in the morning, he thought that it was only fair that they get ready for the training.
“Hey, I heard that there was this new Indo-Chinese restaurant that opened just around the corner a few days ago. I was thinking that maybe you wanna check it out with me?”
So, Steve approached the workshop with the intention of forcing Tony to go up his penthouse to get some proper sleep. If he can't, well, he would just stay there and sketch until Tony gets annoyed with his presence.
"Look, you could never hurt me, alright?" Steve said in a gentle voice as she tilted Ruby's chin with his fingers. She held his gaze for a second longer before she dove hastily in Steve's arms and hugged him tight.
"Alright. Enough of my sister. Let's talk about the Avengers." Ruby glared at the man. It was all she could do, really. She’d rather look at him with hatred than cry her ass off waiting for someone to save her again.
Because he wasn't really looking towards where he was slinging, Peter slammed flat, and face first against the glass window of the Tower. Thanks to Mr Stark's design, it didn't crack under the force and thanks to his spider abilities, he didn't fall down a thousand feet below. Crawling up as quickly as he could, Peter scanned the surroundings within the radius. He checked the roads and nearby buildings for anything that could have possibly attacked Ruby or something.
However, there was an unmistakable sense of tiredness around her eyes and demeanour that Ruby could sense.
Every time someone did that, Ruby had the brains to step away from them, trying to avoid the people to question her presence with the two Avengers. It wouldn't do any good if that went public and the press decides to stick their noses in. She was already a burden as it is, she didn't want to add more stress to their shoulders.
It wasn't long before they reached the SHIELD headquarters. The staff rolled the still unconscious Ruby into the med bay and both men were advised to wait outside until they were called by the doctor. They took seats just opposite the room where Ruby was being examined.
"Okay! Go get 'em!" Ned, on the other hand, seemed completely used to at his friend's behaviour and just went back on chewing his burger. Although Ruby's not quite sure who was Parker's supposed to get. Weird.
Not with actual physical fire, no, but he was using his magic to increase her core temperature. She could see fumes coming off of her skin. Patches of her arms were melting, and blood trickled down everywhere.
She was so lost and confused in trying to comprehend what this Voice was and what she wanted from her. She has shown her a lot of things but none of them made any of these any clearer! Because of the contradicting emotions battling in her soul, it was becoming harder and harder for her to breathe. The Voice has just shown her a disturbing image of her god forsaken massacre and yet, she felt as if the Voice could give her refuge and sanctuary.
Ruby suddenly felt overwhelmed. She felt like everything is happening so fast at once. One moment she was freed from her captives, then now, Tony Stark was giving her a room like it's completely normal to have someone, who is basically a stranger, live in his tower.
Infinity smiled. Her eyes glowed with the rage of burning fire, and she took Ruby to where it all began.
There were too many of them. He had no choice but pull out a cannon to fire chunks of them. Fury's instruction about initiating contact be damned. There was no point maintaining the stealth status of the mission.
Ruby swiftly replaced her frown with a smile, hoping that the two men did not notice it. So what if she goes back to a place similar where all the bad things started? That was over now. A theme park is just a theme park. No need to get paranoid now. Besides, she thought it was a good thing to do, right? Face your fears and all that shit.
"What the hell was that?" He shouted as he darted a finger towards the living room where the TV was paused at an image showing Ruby's back, crouched down next to Peter. "That wasn't just any symbiote, Peter Benjamin! That was Carnage!"
"I told Friday not to bother anyone. I'm sorry." She muttered guiltily before taking a sip of her coffee.
What was she supposed to do? She just can't ignore him and lock herself up reading in her room when there's a human being she just met and is most likely going to be one of the people she'll spend most of her time with in this new life of hers.
Imagine what people would think if they hear a random teenage girl tell them that she once saw the Winter Soldier cooking chicken in his tactical vest while his mouth was stuffed like a chipmunk with a whole cupcake.
Two years and all, Stark had been excellent with the arm. He even came up with a number of suggestions and improvements which actually impressed the Princess. Not that Bucky would admit it to his face. God knows the man had his ego stroked more than enough to last his lifetime.
Steve sighed and regarded the kids in front of him who glanced up with glazed eyes, looking so distraught and upset. Although he admired Peter's sheer tenacity for helping people, he couldn't fault Tony for being frightened at seeing him on the local news lying in the middle of the road, about to be axed by a symbiote.
Tony’s hand abruptly stopped from whatever it was he was tinkering with and looked Steve straight in the eyes.
Beheading a demon with an energy beam, Ruby looked up to see all of them heading for her direction. Overwhelmed, she blasted the demon closest to her, pushing the rest that behind it out of the way. The one to her right managed to take a hold of her, her arm almost broke under its tight grip. Pushing all her energy into the palm of her left hand, she grabbed the demon’s claw and flung it away. Her arm was released and demon turned into ashes.
Tony and Steve would have told Friday to inform her if they were already back and even then, they wouldn't use the library balcony to come in.
"Friday, where could I make some coffee?" Ruby thought that the AI wouldn't reply so now she felt silly for looking up the ceiling, but a second later Friday answered, "For your best interests, I should not really indulge you considering the late hour. However, given that I have detected an abnormal pattern of your heart rate earlier, perhaps being up and about would put you more at ease. Am I correct to assume that trying to sleep tonight gave you anxiety?" Ruby nodded, not really sure whether the AI managed to get her response.
They fell into a comfortable silence after that. Both of them just looked up the stars to which Ruby felt grateful. It brought her comfort to know that somebody was just there, with the whole purpose of just accompanying her.
"Have you seen Steve? He's totally soft for you. I bet he'll say you're being an idiot for worrying over this." Ruby had been in the middle of her rant about what happened in the gym yesterday when Peter made this claim.
Everybody turned to Peter and Ruby laughed her ass off, lips turned upwards into a wide smile as she wiped her tears away.
"Of course. I also took the liberty of unlocking the door for you." The AI said after what felt like forever.
Soon enough, the worry she felt was replaced with excitement. She's always loved theme parks when she was a kid. Both men were actually astonished with how Ruby's demeanour changed from withdrawn to ecstatic in barely a second.
"Nah, I've read it somewhere before. I didn't really understand the whole thing but now that you've explained it, I think I get the gist of it." He gave her a small smile before continuing on with his facts.
Of course, this was the time fate chose to give her a panic attack. Ruby was sure that the sight of the Ferris wheel, combined with the presence of two large men dressed in a black soldier outfits was what triggered it to happen.
Stephen explained the best he could. Clearly, he could see that both men were disturbed by this fact. Steve wondered about how this feud was affecting not only Ruby but a whole lot of civilians too, whereas Tony took offence at the fact that Infinity was using Ruby’s body.
"Peter's going to be fine. And we'll take care of Ruby, I promise." Steve whispered in his ear before looking down at his eyes with pure determination. He didn’t know why but every time Steve uses his voice like that, it always left him breathless. Tony nodded and pulled his face plate up just as the Captain released him from his embrace.
“It looks like she’s still troubled about yesterday.” Tony commented. Steve went back to his seat and proceeded to turn to a blank page to start a new portrait of Tony.  “I’m sure she’s just overthinking like usual. She’ll be fine after spending a little bit of time at school and hanging out with her friends.”
It has been three days, had she been staying cooped and locked up in her room ever since her panic attack. Both Steve and Tony had been knocking on her door twice a day just to check in but mostly it was Steve who always made sure she was eating by leaving a food tray outside the door.
It was too late. The demon was already within attacking distance when she turned her back so Ruby had no choice but to close her eyes and prepare for impact.
"And if I said I did, what will you do to Clint's ass?" Ruby teased while wiggling her right eyebrow.
Jumping as high as she could, Ruby slammed the pipe down hard onto the creature's shoulder. It looked like the monster took a moment to register that something tickled him because it paused, then slowly turned around and looked at Ruby. It stared at her for a couple of seconds, its long tongue dripping with saliva swung menacingly in a low warning.
Ruby grimaced when she heard Wanda's request. What could she say? It wasn't like she was the most interesting person to know about. Wanda could have asked a normal 10 year old kid and they probably would have had more things to say than her.
"Natasha, Tell Fury we're bringing the girl in. I'm gonna get her to the quinjet. Tony, destroy the whole facility down once I get her to safety."
forced the poor girl to tend her own wounds. But at least, they didn't leave her bleeding to death on the floor. After learning about what happened to her, Bucky didn't hesitate when Fury gave him an assignment to hunt down any possible facilities hiding in different locations if there was more.
Tribes and tribes of different people and different cultures swung past Ruby’s vision. They all had various and unique names for their gods. Rituals and prayers were spread all over their communities and societies.
"Go get them yourself." Bucky replied with a huff then proceeded to step over Clint to sit himself beside Natasha.
Ruby gasped in shock as she let go of the Voice's hand. She couldn't shake the image out of her mind.
It didn't take long for her to get rid of the blood stains and soon she found herself reading again. This time, she was sprawled stomach flat on the carpet. Going to bed now would only mean that she would spend hours and hours of tossing around in the bed trying to sleep just like what happened in the past few days. So, she decided to just tire herself out reading until she can't fight sleep anymore.
“I’m so sorry Mr Stark. This was all my fault.” The kid believably argued. “I shouldn’t have listened to her not wanting me to walk her home. I should have known better considering her history. What was I thinking? Oh my god, Mr Stark. I didn’t even get the chance to tell her I like her and now, she could be dying somewhere. I need, I need to – I ne- “ Peter continued to mutter undiscernible words in between his hurried breaths.
Their game was cut off short when Friday interrupted to inform them that the team would be arriving in the tower from their mission in less than five minutes. Ruby abruptly stopped running when she remembered something.
"God." Bucky moaned as he chewed on the waffles and bacon. "You guys should be assigned for team breakfast from now on." Both Ruby and Peter chuckled at the thought. Little did they know that there were about 20 bags of flour hiding in the pantry and about 5 dozens of burnt egg thrown in the trash can.
"If I die, I'm gonna rise back from the dead just to kill you twice over." Ruby tried to sound threatening but to Tony, it was just like he was receiving threats from an angry cat. He chuckled.
"I gotta make sure Tony doesn't harangue Ruby about her powers." Steve joked then nodded at Bucky to keep an eye on the kid.
"Woah, sorry!" Ruby exclaimed when she bumped into someone. The guy had short brown hair and was dressed in an army green jacket with a grey hoodie underneath. He was also looking at Ruby with a weird confused expression that she couldn't really fathom.
"Get up now or I'll pour a bucket of ice cold water on you." That threat had been going on for three weeks now every single Saturday morning to the point that Ruby just called it a bluff. Nonetheless, she cracked open an eye just to check Wanda's expression. When she saw her grinning down on her, Ruby snorted and turned her back to Wanda with the full intention of going back to sleep. She didn't want to go training today. She had a late night with Peter yesterday because she insisted that she come with him patrolling up until three in the morning despite his blatant complaining.
Ruby just hummed in response and continued chatting about Ned's cat. She'd really like to meet her someday. A few minutes later, the television planted on the wall behind Ned showed Spider-Man slinging down the street, which was actually not too far away from the College, in pursuit of some kind of suspect. It looked like Spidey was busy today.
“Infinity.” Stephen told his companions. He immediately recognised her because her eyes glowed with the burning rage of fire as he saw a moment ago. “This must be her vessel before she bonded with Ruby.”
Once Natasha decoded the encrypted protection, she found a daunting folder screaming the words "PROJECT: INFINITY" in red bold letters. Windows and windows of dated journals popped out of the screen.
"Which one has the best design?" Natasha asked and Clint looked at each one as if it was a life or death situation and one wrong decision could result to hell all over. With one final look, Clint reached for the cupcake with a tree and leaf design.
Spider Man was content filling the cupcake cups beside Ruby. She found him really interesting. Although she was quite disappointed that he didn't want to tell her his name yet, she understood why. Hell, she has trust issues as well. Plus, the guy was nice enough to fangirl with her about Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Doctor Who.
And now here they are: two days after that, all of them are sat in one of the many rooms of the Wakandan Palace, finally able to relax after the battle with Thanos.
‘He even took away my entry override,’ Rhodes gripes. ‘Though you should have seen his reaction when Vision phased through the wall to say good morning. It was priceless.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Hope you all enjoy this chapter, what do you think about Wade's suspicions? Thank you so much for the comments so far, I promise I'll get round to responding soon and I'm sorry I haven't done so yet. Please let me know what you think of this chapter - and about Steve pulling rank on Peter!
Natasha feels a few threads of tension leave her shoulders; glad she’s decided to confide her worries to someone. ‘We keep our eyes open, and you keep a weapon on you at
The Headmaster looks as if he is going to interrupt, obviously not happy with the question, but Peter doesn’t hesitate. ‘Absolutely,’ his voice is steady, ‘the only reason you’d have to be scared of the Winter Soldier is if you tried to hurt someone innocent. More so if you hurt someone he cares about. I’ve never had reason to be scared of Sergeant Barnes, and I don’t think I ever will.’
‘Yeah, I’ll fill you in on most of it on the bus,’ Peter laughs, ‘and I want to hear all about you.’ Mr Harris calls for them all to collect their bags and head out.
‘Thank fuck it’s you, Snowflake, I thought I was going to have to listen to Francis’ droning. Glad to see you made it out.’
To her surprise it’s Steve that laughs first. ‘Let’s go get everyone and get started on the mistletoe challenge shall we?’
‘I won’t be able to heal you if they try to put the conditioning back though,’ she whispers, tears falling down her face. ‘I’m useless to you.’
He rolls his eyes beneath his mask. ‘I’m sure it’s not that bad. Why don’t you try for parts in horror films?’ He laughs and drops down to hang on the wall just out of Deadpool’s reach.
The next time Peter has the ball and goes to kick it he’s kicking air and the ball is sailing over his head, surrounded in scarlet light, to land at Sam’s feet.
Tony feels like his world is coming crashing down around him. ‘No…no I got it out. It wasn’t supposed to go back in. Steve, please- Steve tell me it can come out. There must be someone we can contact, there must be someone who can get it out. Tell me- please- Steve tell me we can get it out. Steve,
‘Only one more question now,’ one of aides says from Tony’s side. He sees Happy standing in the background looking menacing and can’t help a small smile at the sight of his unofficial ‘super-babysitter’.
‘I,’ Steve tries to fight down the blush, ‘I think that would be highly inappropriate considering my position here.’
‘Take care of yourself, Stephen, we’re just getting used to you. I’d hate for it all to go to waste.’
He pauses and takes a drink then continues, staring down at the liquid in the glass as he swirls it with one hand. ‘In a way it’s kind of a relief to finally know. Car crash just never sat right with me. I mean, Dad was the lead in technological advances, his cars were always fine-tuned and they
‘Alright. Look I got to go, I’ll call you back.’ Sam hangs up and goes to rejoin the group as they get ready to leave. Peter watches them all go, smiling as he sees MJ talking to Harry so he doesn’t get left out.
‘Well, Stephen,’ Stark rolls his eyes at Bucky, ‘I’d say either Sergeant Barnes and I have pissed off the same person and they’ve used this as an excuse to try and hurt both of us. Or someone is trying to ruin my prosthesis project and is willing to harm Sergeant Barnes in the process.’
‘Trying to help you,’ Strange replies, raising a single eyebrow in annoyance. ‘Although if that’s the thanks I’m going to get you can forget about it, Stark.’
‘Wanda!’ Peter shouts amidst the girl’s laughter, but instead of trying to reach her he gives up and buries his head back in the pillow. ‘I hate you,’ comes the muffled sound.
‘Peter? What are you doing? Who are you calling?’ Ned asks as they continue to run. Peter can see more soldiers surrounding the school and urges his friends towards a staircase as the phone rings.
‘What?’ Steve doesn’t get an answer to his question as Bucky quickly punches in some numbers and the door silently opens, letting the two men into the workshop. ‘Why do you have an override?’ Steve whispers.
‘I’m doing my assignment,’ Wade replies, ‘what’s your piss-poor excuse for interrupting my busy work schedule with your beautiful ass?’
‘Wade! Get in here!’ Peter shouts, continuing to stir and frowning at his boyfriend as he walks through the door.
‘You know, sometimes I wonder why you’re considered a genius,’ Steve huffs. ‘Now we going in or what?’
‘Thanks Snowflake,’ the merc grins, chewing noisily around a mouthful of burger. ‘Oh, and by the way, Tin Can, Pete phoned me and he said he’s landed and they’ve got to the hotel fine.’
‘Wade’s not because it’ll be cheating: his healing ability processes the alcohol too quickly,’ Peter says before his boyfriend can get a word in. ‘I’ll-’
‘I’ll organise transports to take us there,’ T’Challa turns to a guard. ‘Get the city under lockdown and ready the defences. Prepare carriers to transport the army. Wakanda Forever!’
Wanda looks to the side and shakes her head. ‘Sorry, it’s just…’ she takes a deep breath. ‘I haven’t celebrated a proper Christmas since… since before I got my powers.’
‘I was afraid you were going to say that,’ he sighs, then flies in to help their new allies against Thanos.
‘Nope,’ the inventor cuts him off, ‘no I didn’t. I may have not told you everything back then, but I never lied. I don’t believe it in. Even when I spoke to Ross the other day I was careful with how I worded my answers so I wasn’t outright lying.’
‘Oh really? What about the full on war someone started in our dorm after receiving a food package from his Aunt-’
He can’t deny the warmth that blooms in his chest at those words. If he’s honest he’d been looking forward to this challenge for a number of reasons, this being one of them. Despite what many would have said about him before, he would never have tried to undermine any of the team’s romantic relationships once he arrived on Earth with the other Asgardians. Despite having found Tony attractive when they first faced each other in New York. And he’ll admit to having felt a twinge of disappointment to discover the dark haired inventor and blond haired Captain had finally acted on what he’d noticed back then.
"That's really nice of you but I think your friend is in a hurry. I don't want to be a bother." Parker's attention immediately returned back to Ruby upon being called out. He shook his head repeatedly while apologising if he gave out an impatient impression, then proceeded to direct Ruby to the right hallway. They were both nice enough to actually escort her to the principal's room before they went to their respective lessons.
Ruby still continued down her way, slightly confused. More and more people scrambled away, someone even left their car in the middle of the road just to run. Intrigued about what was happening, Ruby hastened her pace and made up her mind to see what the hysterics all about was. She knew it was probably not her business but she couldn't help the curiosity that thrummed inside her.
With that, Infinity took a step back into the portal and travelled to the reality to where the three superheroes originally came from. They found themselves inside a bedroom now. There was a couple they didn’t recognise who were sleeping on the bed. Clearly, the lady was pregnant going by the fact that she had a bump. Infinity knelt beside the lady and placed the glowing orb on top of her bump. Slowly, it was taken in by the woman with a resonant glow of bright blue that temporarily flashed against the dark.
The doctor watched as Tony placed the unconscious girl on the bed while Steve and Peter automatically assumed their positions on the either side of it.
Ruby didn't know why her neck stings so much and why did she feel so… dizzy? She felt an unfamiliar pair of hands grab her underneath her armpits, hauling her away. Ruby tried to resist but her whole body felt like jelly. She didn't understand what was happening but she did remember the last time she felt like this.
Infinity was amazed at how sharp Stephen was. The entity did all she could do to mask her soul with spells. Not because she knew what she did was wrong, but because she knew that knowing about what she had done could cause anguish to some of the people involved. And yet, the sorcerer managed to see through her spells.
"I don't even want to know." Ruby replied but still crawled closer to where Peter was crouched down. She sat cross-legged in front of him, prompting Peter to do the same. Once they were sitting face to face, Peter's heart clenched at the guilt he felt seeing his red handprint on her cheek. It looked so painful considering how swollen it was and with the way Ruby winced when she touched it, he was pretty much on point.
"This is so cool!" Ruby exclaimed. She started learning Parkour with her father when she was, Ruby believed, at the age of ten? The memory was quite hazy but she remembered that they never got really deep into the training."Do you mind if I run through the course with you?"
"Are you lost? We could help you out if you want to." Ned offered but Parker, that's what Ruby decided to call Peter Number 2, looked like he was ready to bolt with the way he was tapping the strap of his backpack with his forefinger and looking at the end of the hallway.
"Having trouble connecting with my sister?" She glared at Mordo who perched himself against the door frame, carrying a smirk on his face as he twiddled with a camera.
She heard the Voice say. She smiled, hoping that the Voice could see it, before she closed her eyes.
As soon as their fingers intertwined, a surge of supreme sovereignty and power encompassed Ruby. She saw a different world flash through her eyes upon gazing at the Woman's golden fiery orbs. In there, she had purpose. Power. She could do things no human being could possibly comprehend. This Woman, or the Voice as Ruby liked to call her, could give her a world where she wasn't living as the shell of the girl she used to be.
"Couldn't sleep?" Ruby looked behind her shoulder. Steve leaned against the frame of the glass panel. It looked like he was woken up from his sleep considering that he was still in his pyjamas.
That wasn’t exactly why she asked them to do that. Although part of it was, she just didn’t want them nowhere near her when she executes her plan. Despite being able to filter her allies out, Ruby will literally become a time ticking bomb so having them as far away as possible would mean that they wouldn’t absorb as much impact as they would.
Tony Stark, the home library was extravagant yet cosy. The entirety of the walls was covered with dark built-in mahogany bookshelves. The wooden floor matched the colour of the shelves and slightly to the left, was a 4 piece beige sectional sofa which faced the full panel glass windows that led to a balcony where one could see the skyline of New York City.
What the‒? Is this some kind of a new monster suit invention? Because if it was, she’d like to ask the inventor what the fuck inspired them to create it.
"Does everybody know?" Ruby asked. Bucky had a hunch of what she was trying to ask. What he didn't understand though was Ruby's tone of voice. Why did she sound so scared?
Deciding that she would just walk home by herself, Ruby started walking towards the direction of the Tower. As she jogged, Ruby sensed that there were something wrong around her. Everyone was scrambling to the opposite way she was going. Most of them looked panicked while some looked astonished, claiming what they saw was so
"Uh, I said what's up?" Ruby covered up lamely with faux innocence. "Anyways guys, I'm glad you're all safe back in the Tower. It's 3 in the morning. I'm tired and I'm gonna go head up to my bedroom. Good night!"
Dr Banner went back to jotting down some notes on his record book about Ruby's health and she didn't know exactly what to say so she just kept quiet and pretended that the floor was very fascinating to look at.
Wanda dropped the wooden spoon next to the pot she was tending to. With a mischievous smirk, she sauntered her way towards Vision, making sure that her hips was subtly swinging from side to side with every step she took.
"If I may Sir, what makes you think that this is actually a hydra base?" Fury raised his eyebrow at the question. With no further ado, he replaced the photos with a series of documents that shows a questionable and concerning set of data.
"Ooooh, Spidey! Can you smell that from the air? It smells like failure." Ruby teased and shared a high five with Natasha who patted Spidey's back in consolation.
That would only mean getting him to sit down in his room with both of them interrogating him about what happened in his mission like the worrywarts they both were.
Ruby released the breath she didn't even realise she was holding and helped support Peter's weight by wrapping his arm around her shoulder.
"Oh come on, take the stick out of your ass, Capsicle." Tony snorted and pressed the button at the centre of his chest to disengage his nanotech suit. "I was gonna tell you but I didn't know that lovebirds here would literally take just an hour to get here from the opposite side of the country. Which," Tony paused and pointed both his left and right index fingers at their guests. "Was impressive, by the way. Don't care how you did it, but well done. And now this brings me to explain why I've called for them."
He knew that the team would go straight to the kitchen because they always turn into hungry hyenas after a mission.
"I apologise, Boss. I assure you that there is no incoming hostiles within a 10 mile radius of the tower. I am currently looking for a viable explanation to how the power supply in the tower had been shattered and I took the liberty to start our generators to account for the power outage in the meantime. However, I must inform you that it appears that the outage occurred roughly at the same time when Miss Reid had violently woke up screaming from a nightmare. She's asked for Captain Rogers and is on her way down to the workshop." Friday explained which brought both men in a relaxed stance, though the uncertainty of the cause of the outage did not escape their minds.
"You do not know what you're getting yourself into." He said in between puffs of his laugh. Natasha slashed his throat, blood spurting on her face.
“Steven Grant, if I have to tell you one more time to pick up that sketchbook, I would burn your paintings.” The captain just raised an eyebrow at Tony’s threat. It wasn’t like the sketchbook was disturbing his work. Plus, it wasn’t even big enough to occupy a sixth of Tony’s desk. He could live having that around for at least an hour. When Tony noticed that Steve wasn’t reacting, he raised his head at gave him a narrowed look.
She was now floating upright, able to see the skyscrapers of New York from such a wonderful angle. Ruby smiled when he saw Tony approaching. Instinct told her to push herself forward and even with his suit on, Ruby could tell that the man was surprised that she could manoeuvre herself around in the air.
Steve ran his fingers down Ruby's hair as his eyes found Tony, who gave them both a small sad smile.
"How about we agree you never talk to me? Dear." Ruby replied sarcastically, knowing full well that she was speaking out loud. Nobody's here so she's not at risk of being called deranged, insane and mentally unstable.
"As much as I like these cheesy atmosphere going on, I'd like to inform everybody that I'm awake now. Thank you for your concern."
"When Princess here started to leak orange thingies from her hands, I had Friday run a scan of her biology and was surprised to see that her glowing things had a similar molecular structure as those of our dearest Wanda." Tony started. "Whether their abilities came from the same origin or not, that I do not know. I would have to do some tests, of course with Ruby's and Wanda's permission, to answer that question. So you see, I thought having Wanda show Ruby the ropes of her power would be quite wise. I mean, technically, we don't know if they have the same ability but close enough, right?"
Ruby was in so much pain that she didn't protest against the Voice anymore and just followed what she said. She was so surprised, entranced and confused all at the same time to see a faint but fiery glow of orange incandescence coming from her hand.
"You know that it's alright for you to have these sort of abilities right?" Bucky voiced out which he was quite sure that this would be what the team would say as well. The girl looked up, worrying her bottom lip between her teeth, eyes glazed with doubt and apprehension. Her big blue eyes bore into Bucky's own as if searching for lies behind his words.
"Oh shit." The pipe in Ruby's hand fell into the ground with a loud clang and she closed her eyes, waiting for its teeth to sink painfully into her skin.
She began to strip her clothes but Mr Stark started with a disapproving tone. "Jesus Christ, kid, I didn't mean change here."
Peter didn't have to be asked twice. Once he was on his feet, Ruby excitedly hopped onto his back. Her legs curled tightly around his waist while her arms found themselves encircling the expanse of his shoulder. To be honest, Ruby didn't do well with heights but not everyone gets the chance to swing around the city with Spidey so she would suck it up and have fun.
"Steve, I didn't just imagine that force from Ruby earlier right?" Steve sighed, eyes focused down on the floor as he contemplates the possibilities of the incident. "No. I felt it too. This could be one of the reasons why HYDRA had her."
Steve, whose heart clenched at the display of vulnerability, enveloped her hand with both of his. "Hey, you're alright now, sweetheart. You're safe." He soothed as he ran his thumb back in forth her slender fingers hoping that she would find some comfort in that. Tony, on the other hand, opted to stand opposite Ruby. Smile in place to help her be at ease.
Upon hearing the Voice, Ruby felt herself slowly calming back down. She regained her bearings. Spidey was only a few feet from her. She hastily scrambled towards his side and propped his head up on her lap. His mask was torn to one side and was shocked to see the face that greeted her.
"Imagine my surprise when I heard they've taken you in." Mordo continued. Ruby still didn't say anything. He shouldn’t dare bring her family into this. His issue was with her and Infinity. Ruby will kill Mordo with her bare hands.
But something in the back of her mind told her to go to Tony's bedroom first. Who knows? Maybe he was still sleeping in. It was only ten in the morning. Practicing what she was going to say, Ruby knocked and pushed the door wide open.
It sounded completely nuts and it went against every single law of physics, biology and chemistry she ever encountered in her short period of life but it was real.
But Wanda was right. As much as Ruby wanted to deny it, she was, in fact, scared of her own self. No matter how much she convinced herself, she still knew that she knew nothing about the Voice inside her head. Nor where her powers came from. Or why she has them. Heck, she didn't even know what she was anymore. Yes, she use them but she would be lying if she said that she use her ability without the thought of a negative consequence happening, running at the back of her mind. Ruby gave out a silent laugh. Here she was, creating walls to block and deny her own emotions for months and it only took a few sentences from one woman to knock them all down.
"Alright. That's enough of your magic Houdini. You two," Tony pointed at Clint and Natasha. "You go explain all this to our favourite SHIELD director. And us two, Princess," Tony flicked his finger between him and Ruby. "We're gonna go flying." With just that said, Tony closed his face plate down, grabbed Ruby's waist and tucked her against his chest which ultimately muffled all her protests, before running towards the balcony and soaring through the sky.
Ruby kept her mouth shut. She didn't want to say anything about that. Actually, she was still in the middle of contemplating whether that was how she saw both men because she felt like she was betraying her father, just at entertaining the thought. Obviously, she wouldn't admit this to anyone. She didn't want the Avengers to think about some teenager that was thirsty for a father figure. They had much more important things to do, like maintain world peace or some shit.
Bucky looked unsatisfied and distrustful at her answer but thankfully he didn't press it. He just gave Ruby a knowing stare and said "Okay." before standing up and proceeded to walk out of the door.
Ruby thought back and decided to push back the Voice to one side. She could deal with her insanity later on. Right now, she just met two more of the Avengers and she really didn't want them to think that she's unstable.
Both men didn’t really know what to feel about knowing this and the fact that despite being given a second chance, the cosmic being clearly needed her for something.
Without wasting time, she immediately clothed herself and let out a happy sigh upon feeling the warmth it gave. Ruby took a good look of her face in the mirror.
Tony was reaching for the coffee but Peter beat him to it, already pouring some into a mug and handing it to him.
She sat down underneath one of the concaves of the 'm' right on the nick of time just when Peter was coming out of the fast food chain with two bags full of food in hand.
"Don't worry, kiddo. We're the Avengers. This is our thing. I'm sure we'll be fine. I'll see if I could send someone home to keep you company here." Tony reassured her as he clasped her shoulder comfortingly.
"First you web me then you slap me when I'm sleeping! So not cool. I'm starting to think you have an issue with me."
He considers his next words carefully. ‘Yes as heroes it is our job to save people and to protect them. Sometimes we can save everyone, usually when there’s smaller numbers and it’s a relatively easy situation to control, like on the ferry last year.’ He pauses for a moment and then continues. ‘And then there are times when we can’t save everyone, and all you can do is save as many as possible, while
There’s an eruption of laughter from the children at this, causing Clint to eye him suspiciously before Laura hits him over the head with a wooden spoon and chastises him for being rude.
‘I don’t know,’ Tony admits, ‘but I’m not going to let them. I’m afraid this means I’m going to have to keep my distance from you for a while until I can get this sorted. I don’t want anyone realising I’m onto them. I’ve taken enough of a risk getting your treatment moved to Stephen’s care, but some friends of mine have already got hold of your old doctor. We’re hoping to have some more answers soon. Stephen says once the infection is under control we’ll get the arm that
‘I’d be very grateful,’ Vision breathes a sigh of relief. ‘I shall look at the dates online and text you the best ones?’
‘Does it count if she brought me back?’ Peter says, walking out towards the group. ‘Or am I not as important as the others? Because if so, I’ve got to say that kinda hurts, guys.’
Thor and Valkyrie leave the facility on the start of their journey, and the rest of the team part ways
‘Tony I’m not sure you’re the person who’s going to be able to make all that happen, but thank you.’
‘I should like, Captain, to concede my prize to another. Clint was the only one able to catch me unawares and since he managed to trick the god of trickery I think he deserves the prize instead,’ he replies.
‘Same,’ Scott agrees. ‘That and Hank gets a bit twitchy if his suit’s around a Stark for too long.’ Tony just laughs and says goodbye to the two of them; Clint’s dropping Scott off with one of the jets and then taking it with him and keeping it at the farm; that way he has a quick method of transport when the shit hits the fan and he can pick up Scott on the way over.
‘We are not having this argument,’ he crosses his arms over his chest, ‘and anyway Wanda didn’t exactly run screaming when she saw them either so that just proves my point!’
Peter raises an eyebrow at him, then looks to the blond. ‘He’s not expecting an answer to that is he?’
‘Don’t even think about finishing that question,’ she gives him a weak smile, pulling her own out of concealment. ‘Go help Steve, I’ll cover you.’
Steve looks over and sees the smile that is plastered on Natasha’s face is most certainly her ‘if-you-don’t-shut-up-I’ll-stick-something-sharp-in-you’ smile. ‘Who is he?’
Bucky looks at him with a small frown, then a look of comprehension dawns on his face and he bursts out laughing. ‘Seriously Stevie? How can you be
Knowing he’ll only complain in the morning if Tony doesn’t, he folds Steve’s clothes before putting them on the chair and heading to the bathroom to finish getting ready for bed himself.
‘You can tell a lot of things from someone’s face,’ Mama smiles at him, ‘if you know what you’re looking for.’
‘I mean, kinda? Not to the same extent as I do here, but yeah I have to watch my strength and my speed and my senses. I can tell you most of the gossip at school because people tend to do it within my hearing range without realising. At first I got so many headaches until I learned to block it out.’
‘Spidey baby!’ the excitable shout is all the warning Peter gets before a red blur tackles him and they tumble over the side of the building.
‘I suggest we bring them back one or two at a time. Give them the opportunity to prove to us they want to work together again, give the public opportunity to accept them and see we’ve all accepted we went wrong, and give them the chance to learn to trust us again.’
‘Just ignore him,’ Peter replies, ‘Sam said he’d be just down the street, let’s get a move on. Maybe he’ll get bored or we can give you a lift back.’
‘Well we’re not going to be giving you a wedding date any time soon if that’s what you’re asking,’ Tony quips, his usual light tone is back.
Valkyrie literally growls at him and he snaps his jaws shut with a click. Tony had bought a piece of land along the coast that he’s signed over to Thor for him and the rest of the Asgardians. They’ve named it New Asgard and his people are already beginning to build homes, Tony had sent a company to help them build a communal hall, where everyone is currently living whilst they work to build the rest of the town. The Asgardians had wanted to build their own homes, but had compromised on getting companies in to help with the electrics and plumbing, seeing as the materials they would have used on Asgard were not found or approved of on Earth.
you!’ Peter pushes back with some of his enhanced strength, throwing the man off him. ‘Dude you’re paranoid as hell!’
‘Fury said he was from an alternate reality, right? Like Wade is?’ he’s very aware how desperate his voice sounds but he can’t help it.
Sam opens his mouth to reply when there’s an ear shattering explosion from in front of them and the two cars in front, one carrying some of the team and one carrying their escort, launch into the air. Their driver slams on the breaks and Natasha just has time to shove Sam into some semblance of the brace position before their car flips over, spinning a couple of times before it comes to a rest on its roof. Behind them she hears the squeal of tyres as the other car carrying their team comes to a stop.
Pepper laughs. ‘Oh come on, Tony, he’s completely your type! Plus he wasn’t exactly scared of standing up to you either, which is
‘You were handling it fine,’ MJ waves him off. ‘Besides I’m sure you can handle Flash after the way you handled-’
Peter feels icy dread settle into his stomach. ‘I’m an intern at Stark Industries,’ he blurts out, making them turn to look at him. ‘Ned was just asking if I thought Mr Stark would turn up.’
He hears an unimpressed huff behind him and grins, catching the swinging bag and looking over his shoulder. ‘I was trying not to disturb you,’ Peter grumbles, ‘next time I’ll just tackle you.’
‘Sure thing, boss. And boss? Looks like we’ve got another truck incoming. This one is heading for the courtroom.’
A low groan comes from the super soldier. ‘They are really not as friendly as they pretended to be.’ He manages to push himself onto his back and Wanda tries to bite back on the whimper that escapes at the sight of his bloodied face.
‘What?’ Steve demands, frowning. ‘His hands were covered in calluses from where he obviously does a lot of hands on work, so I had no reason
‘You faced it? Out of your own free will?’ he asks as they watch memory-Peter and Loki turn to leave the room.
Do let me know what you think of this chapter, I'm really interested to hear what you think of some of the interactions. Hope you all continue to enjoy this story!
‘So you want me to see what I can find out for you?’ Matt says. ‘Or do you want me to try and rescue Tony Stark myself?’
‘Glad to be of service,’ Bucky rolls his eyes. ‘Maybe I’ll tell you the story if you tell me one about one of the hunts you
Bucky takes the opportunity to look around the battlefield and assess how the initial clash has gone. Already there’s a lot of bodies, although the alien ones greatly outnumber any others, but there’s Wakandans and Jotuns laying amongst them too. So far, though, their side is holding up strong against the onslaught.
‘I’m alright,’ he mutters, sitting up and trying to ignore the fact everyone is staring at him. Harry’s on his other side, and his other friends are trying to give him some space by keeping everyone back.
‘If I answer the question do you promise to stop interrogating me on my love life?’ Peter asks as Loki takes the glass to Wade, who gives him a soft thank you. He notices his brother’s eye roll and knows Thor has worked out his kindness has an ulterior motive.
Each of Wade’s enemies had been taken out with a single shot. Clean, efficient and as humane a kill as anyone could deliver. A complete contrast to the stories that had always been told about how Deadpool delighted in causing pain to those he killed. Bucky shakes the thoughts out of his head, focus on getting them both out of here then he can take all the time he wants afterwards to sort out the fiction and the fact behind the stories that were spread about the merc.
Peter can’t help the blush that creeps up at Wade’s words. ‘I’m not some kind of girl that needs you to sweep her off her feet you know.’
Steve sighs as Natasha nods her agreement. ‘Alright, but do me a favour and wait until the following morning to leave? So, you can all head over on a good night’s sleep.’
They pull up at school and Tony gets out the car, popping the trunk and passing him his suitcase. He pulls the teen into a tight hug. ‘Have fun, Pete, and try not to think too much about super-hero stuff while you’re gone alright? You deserve a break.’
‘Wow and I thought it was only me that was able to think loudly,’ Tony chuckles, his expression softens and he takes Bucky’s hand. ‘Listen to me, Bucky. The bond is only temporary and it can be removed. Strange thinks it only formed because you panicked when a particular memory was brought up, and that Loki had a similar memory that the magic latched onto and caused both of you to black out from the panic it caused.’
‘The Council just called, they want you and me to go and see them this morning,’ the inventor replies, rubbing one eye with the heel of his hand and yawning as he reaches for the coffee pot.
A/N: Hey everyone. I hope you enjoy this chapter, and I apologise for the cliffhanger at the end! Who do we think is offering to snap in Tony's place? More importantly will he let them?
Fury visibly softens. ‘No Parker I’m not. I imagine they would have been in danger regardless because that’s the kind of guy Beck turned out to be. I’m sorry I didn’t take more steps to make sure they were protected and it got this far.’ Peter just nods, sitting in one of the chairs and leaning onto the table, staring at the top as the conversation continues around him.
Still laughing Wade picks him up and sits him on the desk, moving to stand between his legs and pulls him back into a hug where he’s now tall enough for his head to rest on Wade’s shoulder. ‘I couldn’t resist.’
‘If I was mortal that is certainly a possibility. As I am not, I believe I shall be safe. Now,’ Loki replaces the spoon in the bowl and takes out the menu, ‘does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should try next?’
‘It may take me a while to translate them,’ Loki admits, ‘are you prepared to leave me to look at them for a while?’
The rest of the meal passes with friendly chatter, catching up on the more mundane aspects of each other’s lives. When they finish eating, all comfortably full, Tony turns to Rhodes. ‘Come on old man, let’s leave the youngsters in peace.’ As they stand to leave he pauses and looks back at Wanda and Vision. He knows he needs to have this conversation, but he’s a little averse to having it the first night. ‘I need to ask you to stay inside for a few days.’
As they all head towards bed they are a little lighter than they were before. Now they’ve got a few more avenues to investigate it feels as though there’s a little more hope.
‘Kid I’m all for giving people a second chance,’ Tony says, ‘but this is just a little too far. He’s still taking mercenary jobs, he’s still
‘Tony,’ Steve says warningly, but at his innocent expression just laughs, pressing a kiss to his forehead before leaving the room.
Thanos is indeed standing there, a golden gauntlet on his hand where four stones are currently nestled into their own slots.
‘Sam and Rhodey are on their way back from taking Wanda and Vision to New York. Peter was on a video call to May when I left him to come phone you. Bruce is reassuring the Asgardians. Nick’s off doing whatever it is he’s doing right now. Wade’s still on his job.’
Steve frowns at him. ‘Bucky-’ he says in warning, but his friend ignores him and walks off. With a quick glance around the room Steve shrugs and downs the last of his drink, vaguely wondering why he’s nervous and wishing he could actually get drunk, and as no one seems to be paying particular attention to him he follows Tony out of the door.
‘Well I’m not going to be able to see where you’re going,’ Matt says with a slight smile. Peter feels himself blushing but takes the man’s arm and starts to lead him through the crowd. All the time his brain is working in overdrive trying to place that voice.
‘You know all that from looking at his face?’ Peter asks. ‘Took me months to work out he wasn’t a complete nut case!’
The last couple of days had been a continuation of preparing more of the food and decorations, but Thor decided this morning that it was time to start teaching the others the Yule dances; his enthusiasm had overridden his patience and so he had convinced Valkyrie to help him try to teach the others.
‘First off: who are you and how did I not notice you skulking in the back of my lab?’ Shuri points one of her tools at him. ‘And secondly: what are you talking about?’
Loki snorts. ‘A soldier goes where he is told and does as he is told and does not question; he is a cog in a larger machine and is useful only in the number of him there are. You are no soldier, you are a warrior.’
Sam closes the book he’d been reading and sit up straighter. ‘Pete if you don’t want me to say anything I won’t. Unless I think you’re going to be in danger, alright?’
‘What?’ Steve looks up at the gauntlet and sees Tony’s right. Somehow Thanos has gotten the stone from Strange.
‘What do you have against him, Buck?’ he asks, genuinely curious. ‘I’ve never known you so set against someone before. And don’t tell me it’s just because of his history with mind control. I’ve known you since we were kids, Buck, there’s something more to it than just that.’
Wade is exhausted by the time he makes it back to Sister Margaret’s and all but collapses onto a bar stool, asking Weasel for a drink and handing over the card.
‘You might want to reinforce the locks on the workshop doors Tony,’ Bruce grins at him from across the table.
‘We may have more positive news next time we speak,’ Strange reassures them, ‘during this conversation Wong has been tracing the mystical energy of the link and we are hoping now that Bucky is conscious, we will be able to trace it easier.’
first.’ They walk for a few minutes in silence as they follow behind the two soldiers. ‘Hey, you thought about going to visit your mom’s grave at all? Might be a good opportunity. And we could keep the others busy if you wanted to go without them.’
‘I know it’s not easy- what on earth is all that noise?’ For the first time ever Bucky hears the nurse’s tone slip into annoyance and allows himself a small grin. Someone has finally managed to ruffle Belinda’s feathers.
‘Anyway,’ Peter tries to get back control of the conversation, ‘this is Betty and Harry,’ he introduces them. ‘Guys this is Steve and Clint.’
‘Who, Tony?’ Steve sits next to the inventor now, desperately fighting against the bile rising in his throat as he wonders who this mystery ‘him’ is that may have taken his place in Tony’s heart.
Bucky smiles and ruffles his hair. ‘That’s why we’re going to work on it. I can take a lot of what you can throw at me, Pete, trust me I’ve faced people stronger than me before in a training arena. Now come on, let’s get to work.’
Unwrapping herself enough from her cocoon to take the plate from him, Wanda takes a bite. Her eyes light up and a smile crosses her lips. ‘This is incredible!’
Natasha tunes them out as Scott begins giving instructions. They’ve got even less time to get the information they need now, they need to hurry.
‘You are the one keeping a firm barrier up, Bucky,’ his voice is quiet. ‘It would be good to know why.’
‘Don’t worry, May,’ Tony laughs, giving a mug of hot chocolate each to Bucky and Steve. ‘The only one who can’t handle Peter is Bucky, and it provides the rest of us far too much entertainment to intervene.’
Making sure that no one else could see her, Ruby closed her eyes and attempted to search for that energy she felt earlier this morning then focused it onto the centre of her palms. She saw the veins starting from the middle of her forearms lined with that familiar fiery orange luminescence that reached through her fingertips. With the tiny orbs of concentrated glowing energy in her hands, Ruby's intuition told her to toss it to the space just right next to her.
Suddenly, Ruby was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of an explosion. Her eyes were narrowed as she shielded them from its blinding brightness. Soon, the blast settled and she heard Infinity’s voice again.
Thankfully, Friday interrupted to decrease the amount of suspicion the guy was currently directing towards the girl."I apologise for not informing you, Spider Man, This is Miss Ruby Reid. She was rescued by the Avengers and is temporarily sheltered in the Tower."
Ruby was still confused with what the hell Mordo was on about. Was he saying that V is this Infinity woman he's talking about and that she was abducted for the mere purpose of trying to track her down?
And just like that, Stephen, Tony and Steve found themselves back in Ruby’s bedroom like nothing happened at all.
As far as Fury knew, they had been successful. Hydra had been quiet for the past year and this had been the first time they've received intel pointing back to the said organisation.
"Okay," Ruby softly said as she clutched at Peter's hands, intertwining their fingers. "Just hold on, Pete. Hold on."
This time, Ruby's eyes slowly pried open and she barely managed to contain her surprise. "What the hell do you want from me, Mr O'malley?" She slurred, as she struggled against the ropes restraining her hands and feet against a chair.
She could feel herself submitting, soul slowly surrendering and succumbing down to this higher power.
"That's for you being so stupid." Bucky said and then proceeded to kiss her forehead afterwards. "And that's for you not killing yourself as well as staying with Peter until we come." Ruby's eyes glassed at Bucky's actions. After her parents died, Ruby felt so alone in the world. Her only family was gone after all. But Bucky was like the brother she never had. It didn't occur to her that she was starved for so much familial connection until just now.
Ruby resisted the urge to slap the waitress and forced a smile instead, "Fuck off." With a fake laugh, she patted the waitress’ shoulders and dusted away imaginary dirt at her clothes. “I’m just joking.” She said. “But seriously, mind your own business and do your fucking job.”
Natasha was in the middle of squeezing the mix into the next batch of the cupcakes when Clint tried to sneak one into his mouth. Without even looking away from her work, Natasha slapped Clint's hand away before twisting it at an angle.
"Don’t you know? That voice in your head? If she wasn't so weak she would have taken over your body a long time ago and I wouldn't have to take the trouble of torturing hundreds of girls just to find and awaken her consciousness."
Steve proceeded to tidy up the equipment they used and went up to his room to grab a quick shower. Once he was all done, he went down to the communal kitchen, surprised to see Tony already there, cutting up some carrots.
A gentle, honeyed Voice called out for her. Its bright tone, contradicted the dark starless night sky that surrounded her field of vision.
"I just wanted to welcome you in the campus. I hope you find your time here at the Empire State University eventful and enjoyable. It was nice finally meeting you,
Author's Note: Holy hell, guys! I watched End game and I think I felt my soul leave my body at the end of that movie. Honestly, it was the best. Have you all watched it? Anyways, enjoy the chapter! Thank you for all the people who gave kudos!
Peter pursed his lips in thought. Maybe they could manage to avoid running into them if they convince Friday not to announce their arrival. Peter nodded his approval to Ruby and told her to climb onto his back. She looked at him warily, a bit scared to damage his body even further but Peter reassured her that most of the injuries he acquired from the fight have already healed. Once he turned on the last corner, he sped up his walking and proceeded to climb up the tower.
With a smile, Ruby let the man have his rest while she headed to the kitchen to get some liquid detergent and a sponge. She went ahead to get rid of the blood stains on the carpet as quietly as possible so she didn't disturb Bucky in his rest. She knew he wasn't actually sleeping because she could still hear his irregular breathing pattern but providing some peace and serenity once in a while wasn't too hard of a task to do.
‘Aunt Peggy used to say the right clothes can make half of the statement for you,’ Tony shrugs, then he pauses to think, ‘you know if we’re going to be doing some more public relation stuff as a team maybe I should be looking into that with some of you.’
we go and try it out ourselves of course. Though, let’s make sure we don’t break any more beds, alright babe? I think we only
‘What do you want me to do?’ Tony asks, raising an eyebrow, still apparently unconcerned at the gun in his face.
Steve desperately tries to hold back the acrid, burning taste in his throat as Bucky finishes his story. ‘So you know who it is? The person Tony is interested in?’
He catches Thor’s eye and manages not to laugh. ‘Brother, Thanos is not yet arrived. But before we go any further, I have something for you. Call your hammer.’
Thankfully it doesn’t take them much longer to get the situation under control. Within the hour Natasha’s informing them they’re heading back. Sam notices Peter sneak out the door while everyone else’s attention is taken up, but decides not to stop him. He probably needs some time alone before Tony gets back.
‘Stark Industries will fund it, you just tell me what you need,’ Tony says. ‘One of the things I’ve been working on is setting aside some of the money the company gives to charity in order to fund projects like this. If I set some of it aside to be from the Avengers rather than SI then you can dip into that.’
‘Oh they’ve all gone to get their presents to put underneath the tree. They’ll be back soon. Come and sit next to an old lady and entertain her with what’s really been happening here. I imagine a lot of the good stories have been kept from me.’ She leans back as he sits next to her and studies him again. ‘You already look better than when you walked in.’
‘Apologies,’ Thor pauses and turns to the team. ‘Friends this is Brunnhilde, a Valkyrie: a warrior maiden of true nobility.’
‘Indeed,’ a small grin is all the answer he needs. ‘Though thankfully nothing that caused an issue. They were more entertaining than they were difficult.’
‘They’re all men I’ve worked with in the past,’ he explains. ‘I knew they were level headed and not prone to accepting other people’s opinions.’
Peter looks down and Natasha knows he’s hiding something; she doesn’t want to call him out on it though, not in front of the others. Not in front of Tony. ‘He saved my life,’ comes the quiet response.
‘I used to love Christmas,’ Bruce admits, ‘but the Other Guy used to get a bit jumpy around the holidays so I started avoiding it.’
‘Well its close enough,’ Tony smiles, taking a few steps closer so he’s now close enough for Steve to reach out and touch him.
Steve opens and closes his mouth a couple of times, and Tony can see the war going on across his face; it seems that, just like him, Steve both wants to have the discussion and doesn’t want to at the same time. ‘Are you sure you want to have this conversation now?’ he settles on asking.
‘How go the negotiations with Peter?’ he asks, trying not to let the smile tug at the corners of his mouth.
‘She’s a witch,’ Wanda explains. ‘She managed to twist my own magic against me, but I know how to fight her now. You can’t fight her without me.’ She looks to Strange. ‘She absorbs people’s magic. She’d drain you and leave you a dried-out husk. Together we might be able to beat her, but we can’t face her alone.’
They’d landed on this planet, Thanos’ retirement plan as it had been lovingly referred to, the original six Avengers, with Rhodey, Carol, Rocket and Nebula alongside them, and faced Thanos. The gauntlet he’d used to harness the power of the stones was fused to his arm and he’d been about to use it once more: to destroy the stones and any hope they had of reversing his snap. Unfortunately there had also been the remnants of his army with him.
Loki goes silent, and Bucky can feel his indecision on wanting to close the link but knowing that would not help stop the questions he refrains.
‘Well, yeah, but we need evidence first otherwise I’m just webbing up random people,’ he points out. ‘Come on we need to find a way in. And no killing anyone.’
Tony’s sure his eyebrows have disappeared somewhere in his hairline. He’s never seen Peter this aggressive; judging from Wade’s expression neither has he.
‘Be careful,’ he mumbles into her shoulder, squeezing her before releasing her and turning back to Wade. ‘Try not to be a pain in the ass.’
‘Really? Because you really don’t look like you are. You haven’t been over-working yourself have you? Because the doctors said you haven’t recovered enough yet and you don’t want to-’
A low groan comes from the super soldier. ‘They are really not as friendly as they pretended to be.’ He manages to push himself onto his back and Wanda tries to bite back on the whimper that escapes at the sight of his bloodied face.
how much he needs to hold back. ‘Besides we’re not doing the whole thing, and it’ll be good for everyone to see how someone without enhanced abilities can cope.’
‘I really want to be a superhero like my Daddy when I get older,’ she announces, ‘do you think I can become a superhero at fifteen like you? That isn’t too many years away.’
Tony sighs and turns to face her. ‘Because it wouldn’t have been fair on Bucky. Steve would always have come first, even if I tried not to, and I know Bucky would have accepted that and he shouldn’t
I hope you're all staying safe and well during all of this craziness. As I have the next stand-alone story already written I'll be starting to post it from mid week, so there'll be an update here on the weekend, and an update on that one mid-week. Hopefully that'll help keep away some of the boredom as the world goes into lock-down. Unfortunately this idiot decided to give up, amongst other things, reading fics for lent. So I'm not able to do that to help me from becoming bored. On the plus side the amount I'm writing has sky rocketed!
“We- I-I shouldn’t come into your mouth,” Steve said softly, and moved to sit up but Tony’s hand on his thigh stilled his movement.
"I d-dreamt about you a couple of times," he managed through gritted teeth, as Steve pulled out slowly and thrust in again.
He looks almost ashamed and full of regret but that doesn't douse the fire that spikes through Tony at that instant. He shouldn't have been surprised or upset to find that Steve did all of those things that hunters did.
In the face of spending a lifetime trapped with a hunter of all people, death seems like the most welcome choice.
The hunter - Steven, he has learned- visits frequently now. They have the same conversation everyday but that doesn't stop the man from trying again. Steven grills him at an increasing degree everyday, but hasn't resorted to physical torture.
And that's what Tony hates, hates that Steve is so genuine, so real. Despises the fact that a part of him trusts him, wants to help him while the other tears its hair in frustration.
Steve hasn't been this turned-on since... forever. He's feeling almost animal-like, something wild and carnal in him wants to rip off that last piece of cloth off Tony's skin and take him whole.
does he want Steve to just rip him to shreds. Tony yelps in surprise when Steve teasingly slaps one cheek, before palming it again.
"Quit being such a chicken, will you," Tony mumbles, gesturing at Steve to hold out his arms. He starts to bandage his torso with the fresh gauze.
"You're not so bad yourself," he whispers, lips brushing the shell of Steve's ear. His voice is soft and flirty, and it sends shivers down Steve's spine. Tony is making him feel like a first timer and he absolutely loves it.
Steve shut the door behind them and he hadn't even turned around fully before Tony was kissing him again.
Steve was sort of old-fashioned, in the sense that he didn't jump Tony's bones on the very first date. Which, if Tony was being honest, had been disappointing. Especially since they had so much pent up sexual tension they could have put to good use. Tony had agreed to take things slow though, for Steve's sake.
Truth be told, Tony is terrified. He has no idea what the man's intentions are with him, there is no way he can guard himself against whatever the man has planned for him. He can't, however you, let him know that.
"Oh dear, welcome!" she chirps, rushing over and throwing her arms around him. Two hugs in a day. The Rogers' were really going to spoil him.
Chopping away at the counter is undoubtedly Sarah Rogers, Steve's mother. Steve has the same striking blue eyes and the golden-blonde hair.
Thankfully, the boys troop in just then; Steve falling in between Sarah and Tony and Sam and Bucky on the couch across them.
Steve looked at him then, “Okay, you.. you were great, Tony, is that want to hear? Phenomenal. I don't know what you wanted me to teach you. You were fucking amazing and it’s-” He stopped himself, heartbeat stilling. Tony couldn't know. And yet here they were, his hand clasped in Tony's, cheeks flushed from the activity before.
Three dates however, were apparently enough for Steve and that's why here they were, with Steve's long and lean fingers stretching Tony open nicely.
"Your house is beautiful," Tony says, trying to jump right past the awkwardness and help some of his own nervousness.
From his pant pocket, he draws a piece of charcoal and begins to sketch something on his hand. Tony watches impatiently, as the drawing looks more and more familiar with every stroke until-
Steve leaned back a little then, never letting go of Tony's waist, his grip firm. There was a wicked look on his face, eyes dark with lust. He swung Tony's legs over his broad shoulders, as the latter groaned at the sensation.
good at this. He moans as he bucks his hips, feeling the orgasm erupt low in his stomach. Steve seems to be moving at lightning speed; the smack of his cock against his slick hole is nothing short of erotic.
Tony slides in next to him on the high chairs wordlessly. Steve watches silently as Tony takes the glass and brings it to his lips. Throwing his head back, he downs the liquid to its last drop, before slamming the glass onto the table.
Resigned to his fate, Tony decides that the latter of the two choices is a better and more probable option. Maybe, just maybe, Steven was of the benevolent kind and would hear him out. It was a risk he'd have to take, otherwise, once he had learnt what Steven had planned on doing with him, he'd think over the more...
"A hydra base facility was discovered in Detroit, Michigan. According to our agents, it is abandoned." He showed them photographs of the facility as he spoke. It resembled an old corporate office site that was built on the 1960s with about 10 floors.
"Stop laughing and don't call me Princess." She warned one more time but soon regretted it because the next thing she knew, Tony loosened her grip and she was falling.
The next thing Tony knew, he heard a series of consecutive grunts of pain accompanied by a familiar reverberating clang of a metal shield. Cap caught his shield back with his left hand. Looks like the west wing would be rapidly clearing.
One by one, the Avengers got off to their corresponding floors to collect their necessary weapons and equipment. When it was time for Steve to leave, he lightly patted Ruby's head.
Once she was convinced that she could get back on her feet again, Ruby gathered her energy on the centre of her palms and smiled as soon as she saw the ball of streaks of fiery luminescence in her hand. Excited that she knew she could get Steve off guard now, she threw the energy at him.
Peter could see that no argument could sway Ruby so he sighed and kissed her on the cheek. Ruby managed to contain her blush. This has been going on for a while. Ruby knew that Peter has always been a tactile person so she didn't pay attention at it at first. But ever since the fight with the symbiote thingy, Peter started to give her little hugs, pecks on the forehead and sometimes kisses, just like this one. Increasingly. Not that she was complaining, no. In fact she liked it, but it would be really nice if they've talked about it.
Peter skipped from building to building until his muscles protested in exhaustion. It was probably after around 2 hours of strolling through the city did they come into a stop near a McDonald’s and embarrassingly, Ruby's stomach announced its blatant hunger by letting out the loudest growl she had ever heard in her life.
"Come in here whenever you want to. See Capsicle over there? He claimed his place on that couch like he owns it." Steve just gave out an audible snort on Tony's remark before putting down his pencil to look at Ruby.
Tony's voice snapped out the girl out of her reverie and quickly cleared her throat before speaking. "Hi, sorry." She mumbled as she gave him a soft smile.
“It has been nice to get re-acquainted with her. I never knew that this little brat would be my one way ticket to killing the Avengers. How’s my dear lackeys by the way?  I really, really hope they’re giving you guys trouble.” Mordo continued while he strided next to Ruby. Everyone watching the screen were silent. All of them were waiting for thee man’s next move.
"So, what do you wanna do in College?" Bucky asked to distract her from whatever she was thinking. The girl closed the folder with a snap and quickly replaced her frown with a smile before looking at Bucky. It didn’t escape those who were watching her though.
Ruby smirked up at Bucky as she jumped but soon enough, her face contorted into full blown panic when she realised that she was actually falling down face first. In an attempt to soften the blow, Ruby tried to manoeuvre herself mid-air into a landing position but she wasn't quick enough and fell painfully on her right foot first.
“I want you to give me some time. Fight off as much demons as you can.” Ruby pleaded. “I think I can kill the rest all at once, but these powers that I have are still fairly new to me. I need extreme focus to differentiate their consciousness with yours so that when I blast them, I wouldn’t accidentally kill the three of you as well.”
Ruby settled her hands on Peter's broken bones which made him recoil slightly but didn't move his legs away. "Trust me." Ruby reassured him when she saw him look at her warily. Her hands began to glow and streaks of fiery orange luminescence surrounded the cast. Peter felt a faint warmness on the surface of his skin despite the thickness of the wrappings. Everybody watched, entranced with what Ruby was doing, until the glow died down again and Ruby's eyes returned back from golden amber to her natural blue ones.
She turned her head and was surprised to see Peter dangling off his web upside down outside. He, too, was in his pyjamas but he was still wearing his mask. Quickly sauntering to the window, Ruby slid the locks off to let him inside.
If one inspected more closely, you would notice the slightest hint of bloodstain in some of the beds, blurry and almost pink which resulted from a poor attempt of washing the evidence off. It could have been mistaken for some kind of discoloration.
