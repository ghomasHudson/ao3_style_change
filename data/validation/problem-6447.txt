It was too graphic of an image and Tony didn’t want to imagine it. It made him shiver. “Oh god.” He mumbled and then he took a deep breath and walked away from Harley and Steve before joining Wade and Peter. Wade needed to be at arms-length. The thoughts of him being with Peter frightened him. He was regretting trusting.
Then there was Sam, Bucky, Winter and a 2 month old baby boy feeding at Bucky’s nipple. Yet another miracle baby for them. Sam and Bucky had given up on trying for a baby and Bucky was so convinced he couldn’t get pregnant that he didn’t notice until he was 3 months along. Their son, Fallon Wilson-Barnes was a beautiful baby who favored his older sister when she was a baby with Sam’s dark skin, his nose, ears and Bucky’s gray eyes, eye shape and his big chocolate curls.
Steve came first. He painted Tony’s insides with his seed and Tony followed soon after letting everything go around the man he loved. Tony pulled off the blindfold himself and they stayed joined together – Steve buried inside him – for what felt like hours. Steve resting his head on Tony’s chest, kissing it occasionally and Tony stroking his hair. Tony was the first to speak.
Harley’s attention was caught. “So your parents made up,” but his eyes stayed fixed on the task at hand, only darting from other screens around him with information and different model designs.
The book he was reading was about the birthing process. To say Steve was scared was an understatement. He was the first man in recorded history to ever get pregnant. There wasn’t any reference material for his specific case and he had voiced this concern to his doctor from the get-go. She had eased his mind and informed him that she’d just carry out a c section on him because to be quite honest, no one was sure how else they’d be getting the baby out.
Bucky was making lunch and Sam briefly hugged him from behind. Steve smiled at his best friends and thought about how far they had come. They despised each other in the beginning until that hatred turned into sexual tension. The eventual sex gave them Winter and their beautiful little girl made their marriage of 4 years an obvious choice.
“She looks exactly like you.” Wade provided, reaching out to touch the streak of white in her hair. Anna stepped back not appreciating Wade being so forward.
“Am I attracted to the father of my child?” Pepper repeated. She laughed. She’d been by herself for so long. Maybe she was confusing her need for companionship with a attraction for Remy. Yeah, she was going to go with that. “I wouldn’t take it that far, but I do respect him.” Tony sighed in relief. He didn’t want any more drama. He was already dealing with carrying another man’s child.
Carol grew quiet on the other end, so Jacob continued, “Amelia told me you were staying at her house.” He confessed. That was probably one of her next questions anyways.
It was the same song and dance every time they had this discussion and every time he pleaded his case, Tony wanted to fully forgive him. He always looked so sincere but actions always spoke louder than words.
Steve let himself be known and then he was handed a sheet of paper. “Mr. Rogers, you’ve been served.” The paper was an issued a court order and sure enough Steve’s name was on it. “Mr. Stark is pleading for sole custody of Nicholas Rogers.” The man let that sink in. Steve was shocked obviously as was everyone else. Tony had been missing with his son for almost a month and now he was trying to get custody of the child he had adamantly expressed he didn’t want, over and over again.
“Why are you looking at me like I’m a ghost?” He noted the horrid state the apartment was in and Tony grew sympathetic.
, Sam thought, watching his husband sigh in relief and pure ecstasy. He had both hands rubbing and massaging one foot at a time. It was the least he could do after the hurt he had caused him. They were both happy to put that issue behind them and move forward with their lives together and as a family as small as it may be.
He got to his room without being spotted by anyone. He couldn’t imagine what might happen if anyone found out what they’d done. Especially Thor, in his own home, nonetheless but Harley failed to realize that Nertha was always somewhere lurking about.
“But Wade isn’t so bad. I have seen him be nothing but good to Peter.” She responded, taking a sip of her drink.
“Dad?” Peter came around the corner. Tony pulled away from Steve and watched Peter hug him. “I’m so sorry.”
Soon Tony joined them. Harley went to his mother’s arms willingly as Steve passed him to Tony. They journeyed to the kitchen so all 6 of them could get something to eat.
Harley and Jacob had been home for Christmas break for a few days now and Tony treated Harley like he was his favorite person in the world. His first baby was home and he couldn’t be happier.
“Really well. Already healing nicely.” The woman responded. She let Peggy take a look at her notes. She was pleased with them. Then she introduced Tony who was busying himself by observing the machines in the room.
“I promise I won’t touch you baby,” he explained because they didn’t have any restraints downstairs and he had to make an effort now to not touch him. Steve reached out blindly for Tony once the blindfold was on. Tony scouted over into his personal space and pressed his lips to his. He could feel the softness of his full beard on his upper lip and chin. Steve hated having a beard but Tony liked it so he resisted from shaving every chance he got. Tony cupped his face between his hands, pulled the blindfold from off his eyes, through his hair – he brushed it out of his face – and off his head, completely, tossing it to the side. Steve’s eyes blinked open and he stared at Tony confused.
“You know I love laying with you Nertha but I made plans with Jacob already.” He took her hand from his other cheek and kissed it, flashing a smile. “Maybe later.”
“But this is still a mediocre party.” She teased him. Harley chuckled, humming in agreement. “My first coronation is in the following month, for my 18th name day – birthday.” She corrected herself, remembering she wasn’t on Asgard. “You must come.” It was the first of many coronations that came with being future ruler of Asgard. No outsiders had ever been in attendance in the past, but this was another thing Thor had changed when he became King.
“I am not my cousin Harley Stark Rogers. I will not sleep with you.” She knew the nature of his relationship with Nertha. Nothing was a secret with this extended family.
A smack across his face, broke his thoughts. A smack from the person would had just given him the most intense orgasm in his entire life. Wade looked over at him in confusion.
Steve almost walked in on Tony on the phone. He’d been staying at the Stark Mansion in a guestroom of course since that god-foresaken night. He had to be there for his daughter. Tony questioned him about it one day. Didn’t he have a pregnant girlfriend he needed to be with? Steve told Tony, he hadn’t plan this. He didn’t want a kid with Sharon so the further he got away from her the better. But of course, Tony scolded him for it. He couldn’t just neglect his responsibility like that. Regardless of how he felt about Sharon, there was baby involved now. He needed to put the kid first. Steve knew he had to
“You said, you’d get rid of it.” Tony said in hushed tones; Anna and Peter's party still going on nearby.
Harley was woken to the sound of a spoon hitting the insides of a cup. The room was still very dark, and he could barely make out Torunn’s figure. She seemed to be stirring a cup of tea, he assumed. He sat up so he could see her better. Before he could get a word in, she let him know what she was making. “Moon-tea. Far more superior than any earthly contraceptive.”
“Make good choices, honey. I love you, so much.” Steve paused. “We both do.” He added, thinking of Tony who he longed to get back to. They might love Anna most of all their children, but Steve hoped it wasn’t obvious. They’d missed so many years of her life. Surely that justified their overflow of love for Anna. Steve kissed her forehead like he loved to with Tony.
“Torunn. I forgot to tell you.” Morgan glanced over at Amelia who was looking down at her phone no doubt getting the notification as well. “We found Pietro on Instagram.”
Torunn giggled and went to her mother once her feet were back on the ground. Sif kissed both her cheeks before hugging her tightly. She looked forward to holidays the most because even though she saw her often through portals, there was nothing greater than being in person. Torunn was her pride and joy, her first born. It was so hard to let her go. “My sweet girl, I’ve missed you so much,”
“Good?” Sam asked, hearing a moan pass Bucky’s lips with his eyes still closed. It was clear he was enjoying this, and it made Sam chuckle.
Morgan raised an eyebrow while she used a hand to support her tilted head. She was unimpressed. Harley said the meeting was urgent and she left setting up her house with Nathan to be here. She didn’t know setting up would be taking her weeks to do and she wanted to get back to it. “She’s our long-lost sister.” She began. “How much could we possibly know?” Morgan sassed. Harley and Peter could both see how cranky she was today.
“We’re not even sleeping together, Harley. And if you must know, we’re saving ourselves for marriage.” Jacob explained.
“Just a week –” Peter stopped himself because no matter what he said, Wade would find a way to divert from them possibly having sex. “Why don’t you wanna have sex?” Wade was ignoring him and focusing on the task at hand. “Wade?” He called out.
“Besides the sucking up,” Stephen tried to stay on track. He wanted to share this with Tony. “He said something that made me think.” He paused while Tony watched him with curious brown eyes that were glowing from the dimmed ceiling lights. “Why don’t we have a kid?”
Tony went to the nearest pharmacy. He ignored the prescription and decided to get them from off the shelf. They sooner he got back to work, the better. It would keep his mind busy and not filled with thoughts of the baby, for the most part. He could figure things out, later on. Preferably with Steve.
“He was my first love.” He shouted back. “We have so much history and we only fell apart because of Hammer. If he hadn’t interfered with our lives, we’d still be together.” He said, as a matter of a fact. He chose Stephen because he didn’t know how to repair his relationship with Steve. He wanted a fresh start and Stephen was rather ungrateful about it.
Steve pulled away with a pop in that moment, so apparently not. Tony opened his eyes soon after and held his face in his hands, meeting those blue eyes.
“If I’m being honest, babe. I don’t like the way T’challa looks at you.” He confessed, looking away from his eyes in the mirror. Bucky turned around to face him.
He found Jacob in his own dorm, smiling stupidly at his phone. He wondered how anyone could be that smitten with one single girl. “Don’t you get tired of sleeping with the same person, over and over again?” His words drew Jacob’s attention to him.
“Think about it a little longer.” Stephen pleaded. “I just want you to be the mother – the only mother – of my children.” Tony rolled his eyes at that. He knew that was a jab at Steve’s baby mama drama. “Even if it’s just one. I just want it with you.”
“I don’t know.” He took a deep breath, trying to settle his nerves. “But I love her. I love her so much.”
“You should go.” Torunn said, finishing her cup. And Harley tried to hide it, but he could not deny how hurt and used he felt. It didn’t feel good being on the receiving end of a one-night stand. He wondered if this was how he made every girl he’d ever slept with feel. It made him feel so much better about changing his life around, but he was starting to think he was growing feelings for Torunn. Clearly, she didn’t feel the same. He got up out of her bed and saw her blush before averting her eyes, providing him with some privacy so he could dress. Once he was fully clothed, he made his way out of her room, closing the door slowly and quietly behind him.
She tried to hide her blush. She could still sense that her fiancée was bothered by other things. What type of future wife would she be if she did not ask about the things that really mattered? “What else troubles you?”
“I’m so sorry Tony. I got so distracted. I didn’t even realize the time had gone by so much. I slept over at Bucky’s.” He lied perfectly.
Tonight, all three of them were at a bar, conversing, laughing, drinking way too much and having a good time. Not that alcohol had any impact on any of them. They were all immune to it.
“Steeb. Don’t you get tired of sketching me?” He quipped, advancing towards their bed. It caused Steve to discard his sketching tools and let Tony tackle him.
Steve peered down at him, settling one hand on his hip and the other on his cheek. “Wish you hadn’t.” He stated, pressing his lips to Tony’s, forgetting they had an audience.
“After we lost your twin sister. I held on to you so tightly. I didn’t want anything to ever happen to you.” Tony finished. Morgan and Harley were shocked.
Tony tipped on his toes to kiss him, resting his arms around Steve’s neck. “Shower.” He suggested. “You can fuck me against the wall.” Tony said bluntly, reminding him of times like that in the past. Steve would love that. They shared a brief kiss and then Tony dropped his robe, giving Steve a show of his naked body as he walked away towards the bathroom. Steve followed, dropping his robe as well.
The guesthouse was left mostly bare per his and Torunn’s request, with only the essentials in it. The couple wanted to decorate themselves so that every aspect of their home reflected their personalities. Tony respected that. He was just excited to have another child of his, closer to him.
Loki spotted Tony talking with Pepper. He had gifts floating around him for some time before he sent them flying over to the Christmas tree. Where was Peter?
“Just wishing you luck babe.” He pecked Tony’s lips this time. “I hope everything works out for you.”
Morgan shook her head. She couldn’t, however, agree with that wholeheartedly. “No. This is our baby. You get a say in this. We decide together.”
And Tony had read every single one. Steve scrolled back to the most recent text. Tony had seen the picture of SJ. Steve typed out another message.
“I guess.” Bruce added, when she pulled away. “It would be nice though…” It really would be, but it wasn’t for her. Nat was settling back into his arms when her phone beeped, signaling a new message. She reached over to grab it. It was a text from her sister, Tanya with a picture attached of her and her kids. She showed it to Bruce.
“Just a guy I met the other day. We’re just getting to know each other. It’s nothing serious.” Peter confessed, quite honestly but of course Morgan needed more than that.
“Pietro is very attractive.” Torunn said proudly, “and there are only six years between us.” Morgan nodded in agreement.
Tony came across the four of them amid all the excitement of the party. Eleanor quickly took a liking to Tony and vice versa. Tony expressed how wonderful and intelligent the 5-year-old was and found it hard to believe she had any of Wade’s DNA in her.
“I think they’ll be fine regardless of who Uncle Tony ends up with because your parents have managed to resolve their issues after so long.” Amelia did her best to assure Morgan because a small part of her was wishing for something similar for her own parents. “I wish my mom would give Remy a chance.” She whispered. She’d always wanted a second parent in her life, living in her home.
“Think about it Pepper. Who else could it possibly be?” And Pepper started to consider it until she saw Carol pour herself another glass and, nearly missed the glass.
“And I don’t think you should be screwing my brains out every chance you get but you do” Tony shot back, taking a sip of his martini. “What ever would Aunt Peggy think if she found out.” He carried on, running his fingertips up his unclothed arm.
“But that’s not me. And if I’m being honest, I only started messing around with her last year to take my mind off the fact that I couldn’t have you anymore.” He confessed. It took Steve a year and two months after the official divorce to start moving on from Tony. He saw Tony’s eyes sadden. They’d been ruined. How could they come back from this? “I felt lost, lonely, a little depressed.” Then he fell back on Sharon which brought him more trouble than anything else he could have asked for. “It was stupid of me to do that.”
“It doesn’t matter anymore,” Tony sniffled after which he recomposed himself. “I need you to stop blabbering about who I’m dating to everyone. It’s none of your business.”
“I just don’t want to lose my husband.” Sam confessed. “And here you are surrounded by all this chocolate. And I know how much you love chocolate.”
Tony sat before her desk while she skimmed over the computer screen, glancing at his updated weight, height, blood pressure and…
Amelia rescued him from the sight before him. He couldn’t look away until Amelia came to his aid, dragging him onto one of the balconies so they could be alone.
“But you never fully moved on. Even after years of marriage with someone else and having someone else’s child.” Sif shot back. “You just couldn’t let it go Carol.” She jeered.
Peter was sitting facing him on his lap. Wade’s hands were on his waist – they never went lower than that – and Peter’s hands were around his neck as their lips met in another open-mouth kiss. Peter pried his lips from Wade’s but kept himself in the embrace. Wade opened his eyes to find Peter staring at him with pure exasperation.
She took the gift coming face to face with him. She was only a few inches shorter than him. It made him feel small. Not many girls were as tall as him, being 6ft.
Morgan couldn’t do anything else but cry. They room got quiet with the sound of her first cry. Tony should have known this wouldn’t help. Not a party with so many people. Maybe he should have just got a cake and a candle and called it a day. Had he done that, maybe she wouldn’t be crying now. “I’m so sorry sweetie.”
“I’m not but like that’s a big deal, Mom.” Because what if he did have sex unprotected one day and he winded up pregnant when he wasn’t ready for a baby?
Court went on a break once again for Steve’s sake. Judge Brooks stated she'd heard all she needed to at this point and was ready announce her decision.
“Bucky is a good person. He loves you and he’d never cheat on you unless he was tricked into it.” And Sam understand her blatant reference to Justin Hammer’s cruelty.
but she allowed him to continue. “And I did. We did and you did a great job with Amelia. You’re a good mother.”
Pepper, Bucky and Sam talked among themselves once the man had left. Steve could feel himself sinking into a corner but Pepper assured him, she’d get him the best lawyer and they would win the case. Tony would pay for all the pain he’d caused Steve and they would get little Nicky back.
“Okay.” Wade scooped up his daughter and got her seated in one of the back-passenger seats and secured her with a seatbelt. He handed her his phone to distract her while he talked with Peter for a second.
Peter got around to calling his father but was loss for words when Steve finally picked up. “Pete?” Steve questioned over the phone. His voice was ragged and laced with sleep.
“I know Peter likes you a lot and I’m trying to understand why but…” Steve paused, shaking his head. “No.” he said again. “You need to leave. You need to stay away from my son for good this time.”
“Just no grandchildren please.” Tony begged. “I’m too young for that.” He loved to point out and casual conversations continued among everyone. Torunn and Harley watched them in disbelief.
Morgan entered the room with Peter and Tony would not let them leave until they did a group hug. “Oh I love you guys so much. My three babies under the same roof again.” He kissed each of them on the head prior to pulling away. Getting to Harley was a little difficult, being as tall as Steve, one too many inches taller than Tony but he made it work.
She struggled to find the right words, but she figured, she might as well come clean. Jacob was almost 20 years old. He wasn’t a kid anymore. He could handle this. “Your dad and I are in a bad place right now.”
“I know that now. I just wish I’d known before.” They hugged again and Steve could faintly make out Tony’s next words, uttered under his breath. “I love you too.” He had said. He had never stopped.
“Maybe.” Hela cracked a smile. “But don’t we all have some malicious intent.” Loki smiled smugly and Nertha spoke up then.
“Like that ever stopped you before,” he mused and his left leg was hiked up over Steve’s shoulder. He was pulled off the counter a little and Steve sank into him. He was tight; every single time and Steve knew he wasn’t going to last long. Tony moaned louder than he should. Steve grabbed his ass – that was now hanging off the island – with one hand and rested the other on the small of his back, holding him in place. He tried to stifle his own moans in the crook of Tony’s neck. He found himself biting down on the skin and Tony cried out.
Stephen’s tongue had slipped pass his lips and was searching his mouth when Morgan’s voice forced them to pull apart. “Geez mom. Get a room.”
Cassie Lang was an only child for 10 years. Then Hope Van Dyne and her father had her little sister, Christie. Growing up she never had many friends until her father became Ant-man and he gained a few superhero friends who had children her age. It was how she met Morgan, Amelia, Torunn, Lila and most recently Michelle. She became good friends with these girls, which would explain her attendance at Amelia’s sleepover party and, why she was called and told about Pietro.
“On Asgard?” Harley’s eyes widened and his lips parted with a silent gasp. No human, no mortal had ever been to Asgard in all their recorded history.
Steve laughed, still not looking at either of them but instead reaching around to hold one of their arms.
Jacob countered, in all seriousness. “I was hoping I could take you out first.” Her smirk disappeared and was replaced with an expression of pure confusion. “Like a date.” He explained further.
“Morgan, you should have stayed with your Dad after the divorce.” Amelia teased. Torunn agreed and Morgan actually let out a laugh. In trying to keep the conversations about anything but her miscarriage, Amelia shared something she had noticed from the days she’d been visiting Morgan. “Your dad has been spending a lot of time here.” She noted.
“He asked me if I still loved you.” Tony paused. “I couldn’t lie.” He informed him and Steve let out a half-smile. He already knew that, but he also knew that couldn’t be a good thing to hear on Stephen’s part. Still, Tony continued. “So, I decided to end it. I wasn’t happy.”
Tony then watched Steve head back inside and took off to one of the many buffet tables, aiming to get more than just cake. He smiled at the sight. His man looked good walking away and while lost in this train of thought, he hadn’t noticed someone new had joined him on the balcony.
Rhodey passed Valkyrie guiding Sif inside where Thor had also seen but not heard the whole incident. He faintly heard Sif explain to him that Carol had been the one to start their almost fight, claiming he would never put their child in danger like that intentionally, which wasn’t hard to believe; Carol had been the one to approach her after all and many people could vouch to that.
“To be honest. I didn’t even feel like they were divorced. Dad came by the house all the time. We still had family dinners, still took family trips. It was painless for us, kids. Even though I know it wasn’t for Mom and Dad.” Harley paused. “Bottom line is, we were and still are a family. That never changed even if they split up. And I bet things will be fine for your family too, no matter what your parents end up doing.” Harley hoped it all worked out well. Jacob was an only child. His mom and dad were truly the only family by blood that he had.
“Torunn basically found her snooping around Mom’s lab. Said she was working on an invention.” Harley said in a mouthful.
Jacob sat in the chair across from Harley, observing how he would undo and re-do his tie repeatedly. Harley was happy for the chance to wear a suit as opposed to traditional Asgardian wedding attire. In fact, no one expected or required him to change his life altogether. Thor admitted that if he wanted Torunn’s husband to “act” Asgardian, he and Sif would have chosen an Asgardian, although Harley and Torunn had had relations.
Tony rolled his eyes. Tony took in the scene. He loved doing this for his family and because he had way too much money and didn’t know what to do with it. There were only so many charities he could donate to. He watched Rhodey with Carol – they seemed to be on good terms again. Nat and Bruce – they looked happy. Sam was feeding Bucky and Winter. Clint and Laura were there too and Pepper and Amelia. Seemed like almost everyone was coupled-up not including his kids, Torunn and Amelia of course.
“You are with child, mother?” she searched their faces for confirmation. Her mother nodded. “Just 4 months along. A boy.”
Remy entered her room through a window. It wasn’t an issue that Anna’s room was a couple stories up. He hadn’t seen her in person in weeks because Anna was very aware of the fact that her siblings were being particularly inquisitive which meant Remy had to stay away.
he thought. He was feeling responsible for the situation they were in. He should have never given into her.
Tony moaned, feeling Steve’s last pump of cum flowing into him and hearing Steve’s almost silent groan. Opening his eyes finally, he saw Steve, inches away from his face watching him curiously as they lay on their sides in bed and Tony couldn’t prevent himself from blushing.
Natasha tried to approach Morgan too, but she wasn’t having it. “I think you should leave too Natasha.” The mention of her name and not “Aunt Nat” stung. Morgan couldn’t see her as anything but a homewrecker now. Natasha left without another word. Bruce was already heading towards the car. He was the only person she ever told about that unforgiveable night with Steve all those years ago.
“You had already stolen her ex and now you were acting as s step parent to her kid. A 16-year-old step parent.” Michelle jabbed. “At the time at least.” Peter could understand that. He had grown pretty close with Ellie but he wouldn't title it as
“It made me a better person. And though we’ve been through so much.” He paused. “And I mean, so much.” Everyone laughed. “It made us who we are. It made us stronger. So I wouldn’t change a thing because I love you so much Anthony Edward Stark-
"I was 34." He saw Steve make a face. There was a trend evident. Tony Stark always dated younger men. And Tony hurried to justify himself. "He was very mature for his age. We loved each other."
“We can’t ask her that, Morgan. I wasn’t even supposed to tell you guys about her relationship.” Peter protested, placing a hand on Morgan’s wrist. Morgan flinched. Peter noticed and he pulled his hand away. “You okay?” Peter worried.
“Okay. Let’s not forget it takes two to tango.” Rhodey added. “Steve is just as much to blame or more.” He clarified.
Tony stared at them for a moment, playing back everything in his head. This wasn’t going to work. What type of parent would he be if he let Peter continue with this? He’s just a kid.
“Gosh. I can just feel you gripping me,” Steve managed to say. He was getting closer and Tony could tell by his hurried thrusts. Not because anyone could walk in on them in this moment. Nope. Definitely not that.
Up until a week ago only the Stark-Rogers and Banners knew about Morgan’s miscarriage. Like Tony had told Pepper, they were trying to keep it under wraps. It was such a difficult time for Morgan and Nathan (poor kid took the news hard). It appeared that within the couple of days they had known they were truly pregnant; they’d already grown attached to the baby and formed some type of bond.
Remy collided with someone else however before he could get to the elevators. Anna was saved from a fall by Remy. He stared at her for a second too long, in awe of her and then suspicion.
Peter and Anna’s 18th birthday was a difficult day for Tony. He cried like a baby all day leading up to the party, later in the night. He figured he was extremely emotional because of his pregnancy but it was so hard for him to let go of his youngest children. Steve had to remind him that they still had a year left of high school and neither intended to move out yet. Tony wouldn’t hear it.
Steve bent over to pick him up and his jacket fell open, putting his mid-section on display. “You’re pregnant.” Tony realized. Steve glared at him. The first words he’d said to him in two years. Why was his pregnancy a surprise? Did Tony expect him not to move on?
“Is Dad going to hurt Wade, Mom?” Peter asked without looking at him. He was too focused on watching the two of them walk away.
Steve’s heart broke. He didn’t want Tony thinking that. Of course, he wanted to be with him. “I do want you Tony. I love you. I love you so much.”
It took her a minute to process what he’d said and what it all meant but, when it did, her eyes widened with the initial disbelief. Natasha Romanov had a son. A son that she now realized was in attendance at hers and Peter’s party. It wasn’t hard to figure out who it was and who the father was with even that little bit of information. It wasn’t rocket science. So, a smirk grew on her face.
“She has this great potential. She's so powerful and because I enjoy hurting people.” He stated, honestly. If she wanted to pry, he’d show her his worst because Amelia wasn’t a child anymore. She would decide on her own if she wanted him in her life and there was nothing Pepper Potts could do about it. “I kill for sport.” He went on. “Dare I say, I get high off the feeling and I know Amelia would enjoy it too but she's just
He smiled at her, his eyes crinkling at the corners. “I love you too.” And he meant it. They just needed some time to get pass this.
“Too formal?” Stephen thought out loud, taking his own seat opposite Tony. There was already a bottle of wine on the table and Stephen was pouring them each a glass.
Unbeknownst to the couple, Justin Hammer was watching the scene unfold from the drone-like micro-camera he manged to put on Stephen when he patted his shoulder earlier.
“What of Valkyrie?” Thor asked the table. Valkyrie had been voluntarily absent when it came to their family gatherings following their return from Earth for Tony’s Christmas party and Thor wondered what had become of his friend.
Anna gave her a thankful smile and hug. “I’m so glad you’re joining the family, officially.” Torunn couldn’t stop herself from smiling back at her. “Because who can you trust but family?” Anna added, rhetorically before walking away and leaving Torunn with her thoughts.
“I thought maybe we could have a family dinner tonight. I brought Shawarma,” gesturing to the bags in his hand. It wasn’t unusual for them to still have family dinners from time to time but what was weird was that Steve never came over unannounced. He always called ahead to make sure the kids were there because they were the only reason he ever showed up to Stark Mansion anymore since the divorce.
Steve sucked so hard, his skin was a pinkish hue. He was sure he hated pussy unless it was Tony. Tony’s legs wrapped around his shoulders and Steve lift one slightly to get better access. Then Tony’s hands were grabbing clumps of his hair, yanking at it for dear life. He’d never been eaten out before but damn was Steve doing a freaking good job. He tried pushing Steve away but with no avail. Steve held him in place firmly. Then he just let everything go, letting all of his sexual tension flow right through him and into his boyfriend’s, willing mouth. Steve gladly swallowed every bit of his cum.
She knew Peter was better off not discussing Wade so she carried on with the conversation as well. “Well…I didn’t say that. But Calvin is nice and it’s only fair I give the person that actually likes me a chance.” Peter thought of Wade. He thought Wade liked him; wasn’t that why he was giving him a chance. He asked him to wait for him. He wished he could but how long should he wait for someone who disappeared without even saying goodbye.
Steve stared at Tony in awe when Maria left them alone in the living room and headed for bed. “Are we really alone?” he had to ask, in pure disbelief.
Tony adjusted his suit jacket as he and Pepper walked out of their 3-hour meeting. They had successfully launched their new project idea and if things went smoothly, it would be effective within 6 months. He greeted his workers as he and Pepper made it to his office. He smiled thinking of what Stark Industries had become. It was better and he was happy to know that his and Pepper’s kids would uphold the new reputation of the company long after they were gone. Well, Morgan more than the others. Peter, Harley, Amelia and Calvin weren’t that interested in running the company. Not as much as Morgan wanted to.
“I’ve been trying to reach him. He hasn’t been home in a few days. And he hasn’t been answering any of my calls or texts –” She went on.
Steve turned to Bucky to hear what he had to say but he got the same thing from him. “Super gay,” he put in.
She was happy with herself for exposing Harley and Torunn. Though, she didn’t care for Harley anymore, she hadn’t fully moved pass the incident and her family rivalry with her cousin could go on for centuries and she wouldn’t mind. In her mind, Nertha believed she had hit two birds with one stone.
He didn’t get a respond; just a very nosey woman peering over his shoulder. “Is that Steve?” Sharon asked, struggling to make out the text on Tony’s phone. Tony put his phone away after that and turned to face her. She didn’t look the slightest bit apologetic.
“Even harder when your children have enhanced abilities.” Gamora provided. Her two, Zoi and Toria were still a handful and she was happy to be free of them for the day.
But “I think. I need a moment.” He explained. It was too much. Carol released his hand and took a step back. “Yeah. I’ll sleep in another room.” She went to grab a pillow and a blanket when Rhodey stopped her, taking them from her.
“Of course, they do.” She stated, adding more food to his plate. “Wade is here all the time. And he eats so much.” Harley grew very concerned as he saw Wade grin up at his grandmother.
Carol came by Pepper’s on a day when her two children were out of the house. Calvin was out with friends and as far as Pepper knew Amelia was with her father. Remy. Her feelings towards that man had changed when she noticed a change in her daughter. There was a dark aura surrounding her and Pepper feared Remy wasn’t as good as he claimed to be; it worried her. Amelia had become distant, estranged from her immediate family and there was nothing she could do about it.
“Hey Pep.” Tony sounded tired, like he hadn’t slept in a long time so maybe he was throwing himself into finishing the model for their project.
“I don’t understand how he could cheat on you like that. Anyone that could have you should be grateful. They would be the luckiest person alive.”
“Can I be honest with you?” Steve asked instead. Tony nodded. Even if they weren’t together, he’d always be there for Steve. No matter what.
“So, does anyone else want to share anything else?” Steve asked staring pointedly at Morgan, who began talking when her eyes met his.
Once inside, he noticed a new necklace around her neck. He concluded it must have been the one she had been telling him about for the past few weeks. Tony had been successful in creating a device to neutralize her powers while wearing it and embedded it into a necklace coated in Ironman-red. Remy had forgotten to correlate the two – the accessory and its purpose – and based on instinct reached out for her face with gloved hands. Anna pulled back. “Do it without.” She whispered before pointing at her necklace to remind him of its purpose.
“Do you think we have twin-telepathy?” Peter carried on. Tony realized he’d unconsciously tuned out parts of the conversation.
Maria was surprised. She pulled her hand away. “Oh no. You must be mistaken. My Tony doesn’t date doctors. Pleased to meet you though. Excuse us.” She turned her attention back to Steve and started speaking in softer tones. Steve led her away after a moment, smirking back at Stephen. This was one Stark he wouldn’t be winning over anytime soon. He wasn’t family and Maria knew it. Now if he could keep the kids on his side maybe there was still some hope left.
“She said she considered calling the cops.” Peter explained, shaking his head like that was the most unthinkable thing.
Dinner was almost finished being prepared when Sam got home. Winter was upstairs in her room watching TV. Her homework for the day was completely with her Papa’s help and she was waiting to have dinner before doing anything else.
“It’s whatever. I’m just going to go.” Morgan pulled out her chair, rushing to her room; her hand covering her mouth. Steve called out to her and was ready to go after her when Tony asked him and Stephen to leave.
“Bottom line is, we were and still are a family. That never changed even if they split up. And I bet things will be fine for your family too, no matter what your parents end up doing.”
– then she’d help Justin get rid of Stephen Strange. He and Tony had dated years ago, and Sharon guessed he wanted him back. She couldn’t quite remember it correctly. But all this was to get Tony back. It was always Tony.
Peter chuckled while Morgan’s question went unanswered. And Tony leaned in snatching Peter from Steve’s embrace. “And because you’re my last baby Peter. After we lost...” Tony paused. Steve was giving him a knowing look. Should they talk about this? They were airing everything out, right?
“Torunn knows.” He informed him. He’d been nothing but an open book with her so of course she knew he still held on to some things from his life before her.
“It was.” Tony agreed. “You gave her too much power over you.” It was evident however, that he wasn’t thinking clearly at the time. He let that insane woman, use him like a pawn but Steve knew he couldn’t put all the blame on her.
“What are we? Five?” Morgan laughed, only seconds before Peter was racing towards one of the big open windows. He pointed at a pole in their back yard and used his webs to carry himself across the lawn. He was about to land softly on the ground when Morgan appeared behind with a big thud. Not hair was out of place. Peter almost shrieked.
“Sounds like a plan.” Steve noted. He and Tony didn’t have a plan; they just did things. It worked well most of the times.
Anna didn’t hesitate, however. Not even for a second. “I don’t know anything about that.” That she could say honestly. She smiled and turned to walk away, when Morgan shot a question at her that made her pause in her tracks.
“Does it matter, Morguna?” Steve glanced over at her. He looked tired. He looked like he needed the investigation to be over and done with and Morgan was right. Steve just wanted to focus on being with Tony. He was done fighting and dealing with issues that weren’t affiliated with Tony or their children anymore.
Peter groaned and accepted defeat. “Okay but she asked for a truce. I didn't even know there was a need for one.”
“Strange wouldn’t let me see you so I figured, what good would it do for me to visit you afterwards?” Steve informed him. Tony cast his eyes upon Steve again. He hadn’t known that, but he could understand that.
“I forgot.” She murmured. He told her it was okay and that she should open the box. There was an adorable little black kitten inside. Tears weld up in her eyes again. “I love her and you. I love you. Thank you.”
Harley came home for Easter a few days later. He’d heard from his parents what had happened to Morgan. He’d sent her a couple texts and called once or twice to send what condolences he could, but nothing beat in-person conversations. That’s why Morgan was the first person he went looking for when he arrived at Stark Mansion, after his mother’s smothering of course.
“You’re the Stark-Rogers’ long-lost child?” There was laughter in his voice and a sly smile on his lips.
Tony groaned audibly. “We’ve been trying to keep this under wraps. Only immediate family knows but Morgan was pregnant.” Pepper kept quiet when he paused. “She lost the baby two days ago.” A lightbulb went off in Pepper’s head; so that was the real reason Amelia hadn’t been over to see Morgan. All Amelia was getting when she called or texted Morgan was Tony or Steve letting her know how
Steve tried one more time to talk to Morgan, but she pulled away from her father and stood by her mother’s side. It didn’t seem she’d ever be on his side again. He’d lost his daughter and son and no doubt Harley too, once he found out. He hadn’t meant to say it. It just slipped out in the heat of his anger and frustration. But it seemed more hate was directed towards Nat than Steve.
Harley could understand that. Aunt Carol was a ticking time bomb. He sighed, a thought flooding his mind. “You don’t think they’re still ‘
“Oh,” and Tony realized he really hadn’t been on a date since Steve and that was years ago. “I’m too busy to date right now. We have this new project now. And the kids. I have 3 kids to take care of, Pep. And I happen to be a single parent and –”
“I can’t remember, exactly. We didn’t see her for long before she was taken away, but I imagine she was so beautiful.” Tony sighed, sadly at the memory. “But I still have you three.” He couldn’t be happier for the three children he did have even with all their quirks.
Tony knocked on the door and called out to her. “Morgan. You okay?” There was no response and it caused Tony to worry. He was about to knock on the door again when she finally answered.
“Father said he’d spoken with him recently. He and the rest of the guardians hope to visit Earth some time this year.” Torunn supplied.
They talked some more until Steve’s phone went off. A few texts from Sharon but he didn’t waste his time reading them. He didn’t want to deal with her right now. It was at least 10 minutes later when his phone rang. It was Sharon. He answered, no sympathy in his voice.
“That could be a lie.” Morgan said. Anything to push her narrative because she was still a bit weary of her Aunt Natasha even though the affair with her father was proven unintentional
“But I am a killer, Dad. You know that.” She explained and Morgan, who had been watching silently, caught on to that. She was almost certain now Anna had killed Hammer and their father – their parents knew.
He grinned, before answering. “I’m asking Kayla to squeeze us in sooner. She needs to check you again. She must have made a mistake.” Tony would argue that wouldn’t change anything but if that’s what Steve needed to finally accept the truth, then by all means… “A week from today.” He read out loud – Kayla’s response after a few minutes.
"What? He's Tony Stark. He owns a billion dollar company." Harley answered. "How do you not know that?"
“I couldn’t give up my one chance to be a mother,” Natasha confessed. She was convinced she couldn’t even get pregnant so carrying James was a miracle for her and though not ideal circumstances, she always wanted to be a mother. Of course, she realized quickly after having hers and Steve’s son in Russia, that things couldn’t work out the way she wanted them to. So, out of respect of Steve and Tony’s marriage as she loved to claim, and her upcoming life of being a superhero drawing near, at the time, she gave her sister full custody of her red-haired, blue-eyed baby boy. “But things didn’t work out.”
“Getting your brains screwed out?” Steve smirked. Bucky’s cheeks turned red. “I know.” He provided, gesturing to his messy head of hair. Bucky attempted to smooth it out. Steve knew his best friend didn’t particularly like talking about sex while Sam was the complete opposite.
“Not right now. No.” He admitted, a glint of deviousness in his eyes while Pepper let out a small gasp. She realized she didn’t know Remy that well but as a woman running half of a billion-dollar company, she knew men like him, powers or not she knew conniving men, well. “Look, she’s old enough to make her own decisions.” He paused, having to refrain himself from using his powers to coax her into ending this retched conversation sooner rather than later. “I’ll admit though, I did try to corrupt her –”
“I think he’s going to be okay. Torunn seems like a great girl.” Anna said, as a matter-of-factly. Morgan nodded. She had to agree. Harley and Torunn would learn to love each other, if they hadn’t already and they’d be happy together. The two sisters shared a chuckle, but Anna had not forgotten the thing Morgan didn’t want to discuss.
“I was about to say I haven’t had any symptoms,” He chuckled to lighten the mood – his mood, really. “But there goes that...”
Morgan and Amelia were hanging out at Amelia’s place. Her mother was at work and Calvin was out with Michelle Jones. Things had been going great between those two. The two girls had Torunn on a video call while she whined and murmured about having to meet suitors. Her brother’s birth only paused her crisis and resumed days afterwards. It took little to no time for the focus to be on her again, being Asgard’s crowned princess. Regardless of what Nertha believed, her position as future Queen still stood.
He turned off the water, searching almost blindly for a towel when Tony caught his face in his hands and flicked the water on his eyelids away. “I chose you Stephen.” He iterated. Tony’s eyes stayed on his.
“Gunshot wound, below the heart.” Stephen informed her as he directed Steve in placing Tony on the operating table.
His words put Tony in a state of serenity. He could feel Steve kissing his forehead and it made his heart flutter. He was always a sucker for forehead kisses and Steve knew it. He wished he never messed up. He wanted Tony back. He missed what they had. Steve didn’t know if that could ever happen in this lifetime but one thing, he knew for sure was he’d always love Tony whether it be this life or the next. But for right now, when he couldn’t have him, he’d just be there for him. He’d be his support system; he’d care for him while they cared for Morgan.
Steve was miserable. He’d lost Tony. Since Christmas, his life had been a complete mess. He stopped caring about a lot of things. He stopped doing a lot of things. He couldn’t eat. He couldn’t sleep. Only sketching and painting helped. He was just living – being – day after day, and anyone could see that Steve Rogers was depressed. He knew his children and his friends were probably thinking how ridiculous his reaction was, but he lost the love of his life. He couldn't help how he was reacting
The court room is quiet while the video plays and Tate acts quickly. Tony is paying him way too much and screwing him way too good for him to lose this case. Tony Stark really was that good in bed.
“Pretty good way to die if you ask me,” Tony smirked, hopping of the counter and getting back into his clothes. Steve followed suit. He watched Tony walk away, all messy hair and glossy eyed; a massive hickey on his neck. He was perfectly, beautifully and effortlessly pulling of his just-fucked look. His cock twitched.
“Lila? Lila Barton?” Stood before him was Clint and Laura’s eldest child, waving at him. He hadn’t seen her since they were little kids but he vaguely remembered her being around Morgan’s age. She’d definitely grown up a lot. She looked good. Lila strolled towards him.
Nathan and Morgan sat on the other sofa across from them. Morgan was biting her lip and pleading with her eyes for Nathan to come out and say it. The silence was going to eat them up. Tony had to know, what was going on.
This story has really been a labour of love. I've never been so passionate about a story and it really is my baby. I'm gonna miss it but it's time to move onto different things. And writing this story and putting out in the world is probably the best thing I could have done. It brought someone super special into my life.
“Why would I be working with the man who kidnapped me and kept me away from my family? Do you guys hear how crazy you sound right now?” Anna almost laughed. This was absurd.
Steve stopped second guessing the situation however and picked Tony up before seating him on the kitchen island. They really had to be quick about this and equally quiet. Once Steve had started pulling Tony’s pants down his legs, Tony captured his mouth with his own. His shirt was gone next and their kisses were hurried and hot. He could feel Steve getting hard against his thigh and as much as he wanted to take this slow. He knew there was no time. In a second, Steve had pulled away from the kiss and dropped down to his knees, taking Tony’s erect cock between his lips. He was alternating between kisses and sucking the tip and then there were two fingers curling inside him. Tony closed his eyes before they started rolling back in his head. Steve watched as his lips slowly parted, little sounds escaping from them. Tony wondered to himself, was there really any time for this. He just wanted to be fucked. Was there time for him to cum once and still get fucked?
Harley kept quiet. It wouldn’t have been his first thoughts but at least she was taking precautions. “Oh. Cool.” He wanted to talk about last night. Were they going to make this a thing or –?
Tony forgot Stephen had moved into his home unofficially which meant most nights he was there. This omittance from his memory, left him surprised when he’d stepped through his elevator doors and found a worried Stephen standing there. He made note of Tony’s treated wounds before anything else.
“Days?” he asked in disbelief, “Harls, Bruce and I’ve been scratching our heads about this for weeks.” Harley was far smarter than people gave him credit for as people thought the only thing, he got from Tony was his old playboy behaviour with his constant change of sexual partners.
Since he’d talked to his mother about going on birth control, he’d made an appointment with Dr McIntosh to review his options.
“Father you cannot be serious.” She tried again. It had to be a joke. She can’t marry Harley, of all people.
Pepper was still laughing away, and Carol couldn’t tell if it was from the use of her name or because of her situational relationship. “Oh yeah. Let’s definitely not question it.” It was weird.
Steve ran his fingers through his golden locks in frustration, taking a few steps away from Tony. This was the most sensitive topic that always came up in their conversations. He was stupid and cheated on the one person he has ever loved his entire life. “It was once, Tony and to this day I am so sorry. You know I am. I made a huge mistake and lost the love of my life because of it.”
Steve ignored that. He didn’t need to dwell on a simple name change. “I didn’t want to interrupt your happy life.” He concluded, taking the items Tony was holding and leaving them in their original spot.
“No.” He whispered. “I just need a moment.” Wade hoped it wouldn’t be a long moment because, he was so close to a climax. He just had to remind himself to hold off longer. So, he rested his head in the crook of Peter’s neck, waiting for Peter to adjust to the new feeling. Moments later and Peter said the magic words, “Move please.” Always so polite.
“It’s 2 in the afternoon.” Steve expressed, pointing at his digital watch. He came bearing a plastic container with pastries as he entered their home.
“Tony. You’re rambling.” Pepper stopped him. “We’re doing this project together like every other project. Your kids are 16, 17 and 19. Your baby-days are long gone and you have Steve and me and everyone else. We’re always here to help.”
Don’t know why he’d say that though. I think it’s wonderful that you guys got back together. You guys have three babies together. It will be good for them, having their parents under the same roof again.” She went on and Tony smiled sadly.
“No.” Morgan began. “Tears of joy. I love it mom. I really do. I’m so happy and grateful I have such amazing parents and a really big family with so much love.” Tony lit up at that and pulled her into a hug. “Thank you.”
“Peter.” Wade mimicked his tone. Peter almost had whiplash with how fast he spun around to face him. He knew his name too and then there was a little chuckle coming from the masked man before him.
“I get that Tony. I just want to be there for you.” Stephen tried. Tony knows he does. He wanted to be involved in Tony’s life as much as possible. He wanted to be involved with the important people in his life. And it was a nice gesture, but it wouldn’t work out that well because, everyone still hadn’t warmed up to Stephen yet and Stephen hadn’t realized that.
Torunn stood on the front lawn of the Stark Mansion, with two of Tony’s hired housekeepers standing close behind her. Tony didn’t believe in having
“Still pining after Tony, huh?” of course he would answer a question with a question. “I don’t blame you though.” Stephen teased, raising his glass to his lips again. “Just don’t see how you could cheat on Tony Stark and ruin everything.”
floor. He was dressed in dress pants and a half-buttoned shirt. He greeted Tony by pulling him in for a hug. “Hey. You ready to go?”
She had screamed enthusiastically, and Peter said her name in equally the same manner. They pulled apart and Wade smothered him in a hug, remembering not to kiss him liked they’d normally do upon greeting each other. There were too many eyes around for PDA. The hug was brief, and Peter was able to introduce Anna to Wade and Ellie.
It’s a comforting thought. She could live with that and Morgan was surprised to know that she felt a bit better after her grandmother’s comforting words. Maria finished styling her hair by adding a white lily. It was Morgan’s favourite flower. “See,” she turned the chair to face the mirror again. “My beautiful granddaughter, Morgan Marie Stark Rogers.”
She pulled her drink away from her lips and spoke up. “Sam, if Winter was T’challa’s daughter why would Bucky agree to a future engagement for her with T’challa’s son?”
Steve picked Harley up the moment the door opened, and he saw his son’s face. He was scanning the room for his mother. “Where mommy?” he asked, wrapping his little arms around Steve’s neck.
Tony only found out the day before that he had been receiving reminders of this appointment, from a week ago and he somehow overlooked them. He figured though, he might as well keep his appointment and get a general check-up. He was due one anyways.
“Very good.” Was his response, before a hand journeyed up to his inner thighs that were barely concealed by his robe. From where Sam sat, he could see just how
Since Thor’s announcement, Torunn had been on edge and could only resort to her Uncle Loki for some sort of assistance with persuading her father. She could not marry Harley. She couldn’t.
“I figured what better anniversary gift than a surprise wedding.” Steve stated, pulling him close again and kissing his forehead.
Anna let out a chuckle, that had everyone staring at her. How could she find this funny? Steve was glaring at her. “Are you serious? My own twin brother.” She cackled some more. “You think I faked the DNA results or something?”
Peter was stunned. He stopped opening the smaller box and stared at Wade completely frozen until he repeated himself.
When they reached Tony’s room, Steve asked Friday to lock the door as he rested Tony on the bed, and they started to undress each other. Steve then took a moment to admire Tony’s naked form. He held one of his legs and kissed it, each of his calves and then each inner thigh. His next kiss was for his hole, getting it wet for his cock. “You always taste so good Tony.”
Sharon had surprise and embarrassment written all over her face. “Please don’t be so hostile.” Both her hands were cradling her bump at this point. “It’s not good for the baby.” Tony scoffed. She was using this baby like a shield. “We’re all going to be a family soon. We should at least try to get along for the baby’s sake.”
She ended up crashing into the table Harley and Torunn were seated at and everyone stared as Harley helped his sister and his new wife stand up from the rumbles. Many of the guests were seen leaving the ballroom, fearing for their safety. Torunn’s eyes were glowing with lightning as she scammed the room for the other person involved in the debacle.
“He does deserve to know though.” Tony was still staring at Steve, as he finally pulled him into an embrace. They shared a concerned look as both caressed Tony’s bump.
“Why don’t you just leave Tony alone?” With those words, Steve realizes how dense this poor boy must be. Far more stupid than he originally thought, and Steve lets him know that.
“Nertha.” Morgan informed her father. Steve focused on her while she elaborated further. She hadn’t addressed him directly in weeks. “Why was it, again?”
Also I'm wishing a Happy New Year to everyone since it's my first upload for the year! 🎉🎉🎉 Wishing nothing but good for everyone 😘
Tony glanced over his reflection in the mirror one more time before he went to the living room and asked his kids how he looked.
Tony was on the fourth floor of his home admiring what had become of the preparations for his Annual Christmas Party. It was 3 weeks away and Tony had to admit it was his favourite time of the year because all his former Avengers teammates and their own families would be there, just like one big extended family.
Neither Tony nor Peter got to answer before Sharon was chattering again. “You’re going to have a little sister.” And she had the audacity to reach out and grabbed both of Peter’s cheeks as if she were talking to a child.
He didn’t need to hear his 17-year-old daughter talking like this. He glanced at his wife and she looked just as concerned as he was. Laura tried to get Lila to calm down. He had struck Harley with an arrow, just minutes ago. He was getting bandaged up by Bruce and Tony as they got their stuff together to go home. Harley would be fine.
“Let me go Morgan.” Anna stated and she enhanced the pain for Morgan. She didn’t budge so Anna held onto the other hand to absorb her super strength and shoved her away. Morgan went flying into the nearest wall which was the barrier between where they stood and the seating area of the newlyweds.
He stresses that he didn’t know they were at the point where they gave each other gifts and apologizes immediately. Wade shrugs it off. “Open it.”
“Being inside –” Stephen started up again and that set him off. He didn’t need to hear this. He didn’t need to know this. He tried to hold his tongue, clenched his fist and uttered, “Don’t. Don’t you fucking dare.”
“I know. I’m sorry Morguna. Think you want to...maybe...move back in?” He tried. He would love to keep his children close, together and where he could see them.
“Hope it’s nothing too serious.” Wanda worried, staring after Pepper as she went back into the house with Gamora to get more platters of finger food. The women were seated on one of her balconies around an outdoor table with matching chairs and a large umbrella for shade above them.
Tony embraced him back and placed a small kiss to his forehead. He would never admit it put he had favourites when it came to his kids.
“Stop teasing Rems.” She begged and at her request, he rubbed the tip of his leaking cock at her centre before sinking into her. She wasn’t aware of when he undid his zip and freed his member, but she didn’t care because with each powerful thrust and the groping of a breast, Anna could feel herself getting closer to the edge.
Justin Hammer was surprisingly hard to find. It took Tony a couple weeks in fact, not until early October. He knew Harley would have found him quicker had he asked for help, but he had no idea what he was going up against therefore he didn’t want to put him or anyone else in danger. Tony would have acted alone had Rhodey not been present when he discovered the micro-camera but here they were now, getting ready to face Hammer.
Peter broke the silence. “I’m gonna pass on dessert.” He pulled his chair out, taking his plate with him to the kitchen. “I have homework.” Tony tried calling after him but it was pointless.
Amelia initiated the conversation regarding Pietro, and Cassie spared no details about her dates and the coitus that followed on multiple occasions. Lila was the most raved up by descriptions asking, “Did he use his powers?”
floor where his mom was waiting, no doubt. Tony minimized the screen projected before him from his phone that then disappeared altogether, when he saw Peter and his “friend”. Tony stayed seated while they approached him.
Steve was waiting for Tony to join them when Friday passed on a message from him, through the overhead speakers of the room. As it was recently disclosed, Steve explained by starting with, “Fury has closed the case.” Steve saw his children and Wade looking around at each other in confusion. “They found the persons who were working with Hammer and they’re being dealt with accordingly.”
“Yeah. SJ is going to be here sooner than we think...” Steve whispered. Tony glanced up at him, his eyebrows furrowed at the mention of
“Yes. I miss you and our little girl. Miss our family.” Sam advanced again and Bucky allowed it. “Wanna come home.” He begged.
“Let him in.” Tony informed her. He hadn’t seen Stephen in a while. He’d become a little bit standoffish following that conversation not too long ago, but he’d been busy with work and out of town for some time as well.
And quite often enough she got to see her younger twin cousins, Narfi and Vali who lived on Sakaar with their father, the Grandmaster. They were given titles as princes of Sakaar, something Thor could not grant them on Asgard as they were not children of the King. And the Grandmaster was ever so tempted to make Loki his Queen. Loki was hesitant.
Nathan pulled her into his arms and held her closely. “I love you too.” He whispered. They’d get through this together.
were standing over him, panic in their eyes and in their voices. Morgan, Peter, Harley and Anna crowded around him.
“Likewise, brother” she retorted, returning his smile. Although she tolerated both her younger brothers, she was closer to Loki than she was to Thor for obvious reasons.
“We’re pregnant,” Nathan finally said. And the mind-numbing silence prolonged even more. Nathan and Morgan watched them, awaiting their reaction or response or something because it was way too calm. Where was the screaming and shouting about how stupid she was and how could they be so careless and every other stereotypical thing parents of pregnant teenagers said?
Wade opened his eyes, not able to hear the tapping of laptop keys anymore. He glanced across from him, arms moving from behind his head to hold Peter’s. Peter, who had been sitting on his bed, his laptop still on his lap. His hands clasped together, however and he was staring out the bedroom window, deep in thought Wade assumed.
“Stephen?” Tony whispered, his eyes widen, and he let out a silent gasp. “What-what–” he struggled with his words. “What are you doing here?”
“Divorces are expensive.” Nat settled with that for a response. She made herself think about that in more detail. People spent so much money to get divorces these days. Not that she and Bruce were struggling financially. After they retired from being Avengers, they realized they had to start earning money to sustain their living arrangements. They weren’t living at the Avengers compound for free anymore. Now Bruce was working as a full-time private doctor and she dabbled in her own line of work so they were pretty stable financially.
“So, like are you in need of a daddy?” he wiggled his eyebrows, suggestively. Peter shook that thought away, laughing at his suggestion.
“That’s it.” Anna stated, in all seriousness, pulling away from his touch. “I’m done.” Her back turned to him at this point but he moved to stand in front of her, hoping to keep the conversation face-to-face.
Peter chewed and swallowed slowly. His eyes brighten and he found Wade staring at him expectantly. “This is good Wade. Like really good.”
“She said that even though the Winter Soldier Serum is completely out of my system, I don’t have that many eggs left. And being in my 40s, chances aren’t that high anymore.” Bucky informed him. He paused, looking away as his eyes saddened. Steve knew he really wanted another baby. He always talked about wanting plenty of kids if he ever got the chance.
“Besides the obvious, yes Peter.” Tony placed a hand on his shoulder. “I don’t want anyone taking advantage of you.”
“Wonderful.” Torunn smiled at him and he watched her saunter away from him. He never noticed it before but Torunn Thorsdottir was a sight to behold. For the first time he was seeing Torunn as more than just Thor’s daughter or Morgan’s friend.
child?” Tony did a little shrug. “That just can’t be right.” Steve continued. “Tones, may I remind you. You used to sneeze and get pregnant when we were together?”
A spark flashed across her eyes and Sif could see her fists visibly glow. Carol was an inch away from her face now. “Wanna say something else?” she hissed.
“Come on Justin. Let’s settle this like adults.” Tony mocked, sticking a landing and then retracting his helmet in the nanotech suit. “You can’t still be bumped about me rejecting you after one date.”
“Not many people do. It was years ago,” Morgan filled Michelle in. “So there’s always this awkward tension between Aunt Carol and Sif. It’s just never been this close to a fight.”
Everyone watched the pair leave, silence filling the room. Tony broke it. “So,” he said, seriously. “Does Harley get a title?”
TAGS, WARNINGS and RELATIONSHIP TAGS may be refering to the Past, Present or Both! They might be only mentioned, done in real time OR both.
He was greeted with a floral arrangement of flourishing plants and flowers, wrapped around out door seats and in those seats were members of his extended family, all smiling back at him over their shoulders. They separated in the middle, forming an aisle and down that rose petal scattered aisle was Steve standing before an arch - a wedding arch. He grinned back at Tony, beckoning him forward.
“Good.” Justin commended, reaching in his pocket for a piece of paper before turning and sliding it to Gary.
Steve calmed down a bit and Sam released his arms when he asked him to. “I’m fine Sam.” But Strange wasn’t. He stood with Tony for support as he held his bloody nose. At this point everyone’s attention was on the group – Strange, Tony, Steve and Sam – as they got closer.
Now he was getting ready for the trip to Xavier’s School after reading Steve’s text. He wasn’t aware of Stephen’s presence until he knocked on their open room door. Tony smiled up at him briefly while he put on his shoes. “Hey.”
“I don’t know. Not many gay guys at school,” Peter reminded him. It made him think sometimes that he’d be single forever because everyone else was dating, even his sister and brother.
Jacob’s hands were glowing on instinct. Nertha became amused. “It’s mind control.” She informed him. “Courtesy of this lovely spell book” Said book appeared in the palm of her hand. Jacob smirked. Okay so maybe it was a spell. Whatever. “Borrowed from my dear Uncle Loki.” It materialized just as fast.
“No.” Harley informed her, sipping on the soda in his cup as opposed to some type of alcohol he’d be drinking in the previous years. “My mom planned this one.”
“I know.” Pepper’s eyes get a little wet at Tony’s description. “One of the pains of being a mother. You can just feel your children’s pain.” Pepper knew. Even as old as her kids were, if they so much as got a paper cut, she’d wince at the sight of it.
“And what happens when she proves you wrong?” Tony put forward because that was likely the outcome and he – they needed to prepare for that.
“Welcome to the family.” Steve finished for Tony, who was choked up at this point. He was very aware of how Tony’s emotions were all over the place recently and it worried him, but he hadn’t mentioned it yet.
It was now nearing 4 years since they’d met, and they’d have a total of 4 kids by August. Twins was a hell of a surprise. Not that they couldn’t afford it, well Tony could but it took a lot out of them. They were fortunate enough to steal little moments like this – just the two of them. In those moments if they weren’t making love, Steve would sketch Tony and occasionally, paint him.
Anyways, all that talk about Pietro and Remy being hot is me letting y'all know I find fictional characters attractive. Lol. How weird...
“No.” Tony whispered. “Just leave.” He wasn’t able to look his husband in the face anymore. What more could he say? How many more lies did he have left to say? He didn’t want to be alone, but he didn’t want to be around Steve.
When two days passed, and Tony hadn’t woken, Steve demanded answers from Stephen who hadn’t left Tony’s side.
“Good luck Tony.” She responded. Then they both got up, shared a hug and Tony was able to go on about the rest of his day.
It would be fine though, right? They’d sit them – Steve, Tony, Bruce and Nat – down and they’d had a proper conversation about it. Nathan’s hand was slipping into hers, squeezing it reassuringly. She really hoped this went over some-what civil.
“So you guys are a thing now?” Jacob teased, narrowing his eyes at Harley and putting the can of soda to his lips.
Maria brushed Morgan’s hair soothingly. Morgan seemed to visibly relax. “All this beautiful hair.” Morgan’s hair was always the darkest among her siblings. It tended to get darker as she got older. Almost like Tony’s, Maria realized. She had Morgan sit by her vanity as she attempted to beautify her granddaughter’s appearance. Looking good always helps in making one feel good. Tony let her try anything, anything to get the old Morgan back.
Tony looked up at Steve who was smiling from ear-to-ear. That was their baby, Tony was carrying. That was their baby. They both sighed and Steve pressed a tender kiss to Tony’s forehead. “I told you.” He whispered, cheekily.
“Yeah. Um.” She paused, thinking about what she would say first. “It’s just my mom,” She shook her phone for emphasis. “Asking for my help with Anna and Peter’s party.” Jaime nodded. “You should come.”
He had a towel around his naked form and another drying his shoulder-length hair as he stood before the full-length mirror. Sam saw him and advanced behind him. Bucky stood up straight, not knowing what Sam was planning to do. Then he unravelled the towel around his body and let it fall at their feet.
“I did not think it was my place to say.” Nertha conceded with such poise and false remorse. To be honest with herself, Nertha had forgotten about the incident, putting it in the back of her mind until Torunn was ever so frequently mentioned.
Amelia cooed at the couple, “You guys are so cute. Makes me miss Jacob,” she stated, before Torunn smiled at her and rubbed her arm soothingly. The long distance of the relationship was always the hardest part.
Wade proposed that Tony was becoming more acceptable of their relationship and maybe saw him as family. Tony would beg to differ if asked. Peter asked Wade not to push that idea any further.
Tony was getting himself a handful of grapes when he responded. “You guys know I can’t cook to save my life.” Newly 45 as of the end of May and he still couldn’t cook. Why would he need to though? He was Tony Stark. “Your grandmother cooked right before she left for her book club earlier.”
“Your name doesn’t sound familiar.” Amelia concluded, handing the card back to him. The spark was there again. She folded her arms over her chest not amused by whatever it was this man was trying to achieve.
Eyes turned to Harley’s direction. Lila Barton was the most irritated by the news, only learning about this for the first time. She wondered who he could possibly be marrying as envy ate her up.
Nat was with Clint ordering drinks at the bar. Sam had already drunk a few glasses when he found them, but he was far from intoxicated.
On the other side of Tony’s bedroom door, Steve was rejoining Tony also wearing a robe. His brows were knitted together. “Birth control?” He asked, because maybe he didn’t hear it right as his eyes darted
The doors to the ball room opened. The organs began playing, members of the audience rose to their feet and Harley turned in the direction of the doors as he watched Torunn and Thor journey to the altar.
“No.” Wade whispered. “I’m never going to let you go. Never again.” And Peter hoped he meant it. He didn’t need another heartache or heartbreak. “I’m so sorry I left.” He finished. His apology was appreciated but it didn’t, however, explain why he left.
“Was I supposed to cry, Anna?” Her voice rose, her eyebrows crinkled, and her mouth formed a thin line. She was annoyed and her little sister decided not to respond but instead she studied her face. Anna wouldn’t cower away from her older sister’s words. That’s not who she was but Morgan hadn’t caught on yet.
“Oh, I just kept running my hands through it,” he lied too easily and tried smoothing it down afterwards. He changed the subject quickly. “And Tony was just here making martinis before he headed to his room,” Steve gesture to the glasses still at the bar to validate his story.
Also I'm sorry about my fight scene. I'm no director or producer or whoever coordinates fight scenes but I tried 😐 please be nice..
“I turn 18 in less than 2 months Morgan.” She reminded her with so much impudence, Morgan was surprised to hear her next words be so entreating. “So please don’t tell Mom and Dad.” She begged. Morgan was starting to realize how two-faced her
When Wade entered the room with Ellie, the little girl ran over to Peter upon spotting him. He got down to her level and let her hug him. She’d become very fond of Peter.
Laura had to agree. “Lila took such a long time to get over Harley.” She added, remembering her daughter’s fit after last year’s Christmas party.
“Everyone,” he commanded when all eyes were on him. “Your guest of honor has arrived.” Thor had asked of Tony, years ago to let Loki think this party was for him as his birthday was December 24
, he thought. “I think I can be a good big sister.” She explained but Sam and Bucky stared at her for a minute and then at each other. Winter had been an only child for 10 years and she’d never asked prior to this point so Sam and Bucky had to wonder where this was coming from.
“You think so?” Harley perked up, grinning and retracting his arm from around her prior to running his fingers through his hair. He was clearly very proud of himself as he got up to fix his hair in her vanity mirror. Being sure to set the cat down carefully first.
“Tony,” Steve’s voice finally broke through his thoughts and he opened his eyes. He wasn’t in shock. He didn’t look horrified. He didn’t look scared. He didn’t look angry. And if Tony didn’t know any better, he would say he look like he was in awe.
Harley rolled his eyes. “Grandma, could I get a moment with Wade?” It didn’t take more than a few seconds for Maria Stark to leave the room and Harley, stepped into protective big brother mood.
And they were at it again. Tony was left sore and half crippled after that. Where was he getting all this energy from, being in his late 40s?
Of course the couple argued that they were ready and no, Peter wasn’t pregnant. That wasn’t why they were
“Relax. I’m not going to hurt you,” Deadpool explained. “I like you. See you around, Spidey.” And he hopped off the building, landing somewhere below. Peter rushed to see where he had landed but he was nowhere in sight.
“Jaime, you aren’t on any social media, right?” Nathan started, sitting by Morgan again and wrapping an arm around her shoulder.
“I don’t think you could ever bore me Tony. I know we don’t know each other well but there wasn’t a single doubt in my mind about meeting you the moment I heard about you.”
They got Tony ready for surgery, placing an oxygen mask over his nose and mouth. Stephen’s team worked fast to get the bullet out, but Tony was left unconscious after the operation. Stephen informed everyone that was to be expected since Tony had lost so much blood.
“Yes.” Torunn said as if it wasn’t obvious. “Where else would I be referring to?” Harley shook his head. He was thinking about it too hard and Torunn became aware of it. “You must attend. It will give me the chance to show you what a good party looks like.” She gestured to the room in its entirety as she spoke.
He was still at a loss for words. “He’s coming to the Christmas party. Don’t make a scene Steve.” Tony then waltzed away, leaving an irritated Steve in his wake.
“Vis and I are thinking about getting a puppy” Wanda stated. She and Vision had been together for only a year now, travelling the world together and falling in love. It was an odd pair but it worked and no one could deny what they felt for each other. Clint smiled at Wanda and Nat sipped her drink quietly.
“Why’d you leave me?” Peter questioned, rising his head up in hopes of seeing his face. He still had his mask on. Peter reached up and pulled it off revealing his scarred face. The mask fell from his hand and he cupped Wade’s face with both hands. His eyes met Peter’s and then closed as he pressed his lips to Wade’s. He didn’t react. He didn’t move. Peter struck his left cheek, smacking him easily. Wade cried out. His eyes flew open and he found Peter glaring at him. Wade was pleasantly turned on.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “Take up for Morgan. Pretend like our daughter can do no wrong. I know she’s your favorite. But come on…what she did…what they did is not okay.” Tony knew Steve loved Morgan so much that if she killed someone, Captain America and his righteousness be damned, he’d help her hide the body.
Steve brought up school next, asking Anna if she’d had any plans for college after she’d finished at Xavier’s school. She expressed her dreams to join the X-men; to do some good in the world, and she still wanted to. Steve had regretted asking. Harley, Peter and Morgan had all expressed their interest in being superheroes in the past, long before they knew they had the Super Soldier Serum in their DNA. They knew what their parents did, and they wanted to be a part of it. Steve nor Tony entertained the idea. Peter had only ‘gotten away with it’ because he was older now, the world was a lot safer and Tony kept tabs on him.
“I know.” He responded smugly and Steve dove his tongue deeper into the tightness of his wet hole, breaking Tony’s smug expression. Licking his walls and feeling the muscles clench around him, Steve was rewarded with a moan from Tony. Steve then removed his tongue, kissing the hole once more before, moving on to the base of Tony's cock next and then the C-section scar under his belly's pudge. The trail of kisses then advanced to the faint stretch marks on his belly – proof of the four children Tony had given him.
Tony whimpered. “Please Steve…please.” Another soft kiss, below his right nipple before he suckled it. He then administered the same love and attention to his left nipple and Tony’s toes curled, more moans leaving his beautiful mouth. Steve reached his lips again and planted a final kiss there – one that became unbreakable as he sank painfully deep and slowly into Tony.
“I keep telling you, I don’t want you dating my daughter. Do that and we’d consider the debt repaid.”
He was supposed to play nice. Steve sighed, shaking Wade’s hand. A wide smile grew on Wade’s face as he peeped over at Peter to see if he was seeing this too. Peter nodded again letting out a little chuckle.
and with that thought, Tony remembered his birthday was coming up too. He hated his birthdays. Didn’t like to celebrate himself; not anymore; not like he use to when he was younger. But for Morgan, any of his other kids or any of his friends or family, he’d go all out for them. He’d throw the biggest most extravagant parties. Morgan’s was no exception because little miss perfect was turning 18 and that was a big deal.
“Thanks.” Morgan grinned. “You know you can stay with us if you ever want to.” She went on, grabbing her phone off the coffee table as it rang signalling a notification. It was a message from her mother. It was talk about Anna and Peter’s upcoming party. Tony was requesting her help with some party preparations which she’d gladly do.
“Just a sec.” Tony shouted at him. He kept his moans quiet as he rode Steve. He figured they might as well finish up. He was almost there, and he could feel Steve getting closer too.
Peter found Shuri shadowing Prince Azari. She had taken it upon herself to keep an eye out for her nephew from the day he was born. He was to be King one day and Shuri took great pride in seeing over him. The little prince was currently eating handfuls of cake with Winter and a few other giggling kids. She had not seen Peter approaching her.
Bet you can't guess who their kid is... even though he's been mentioned as a extra character as early as Chapter 7 😏
T’challa didn’t seem the least bit bothered by his tone. It was a good question. “I am visiting for business and your wonderful husband has allowed me to stop by for a meal and conversation.”
“You were planning to break into SHIELD.” He stated. Nat met his eyes. She knew what he might be thinking but she only ever said that as a joke to Morgan.
Natasha interrupted her. “Hey. It’s okay.” She promised. “I know how much you care for your parents, as you should.” Given the situation, she would not expect anyone to react any differently, especially Morgan Stark Rogers. “But just know that all is forgiven, Morgan. We’re okay.”
“It’s just a gift from a friend...” he trailed off. Tony waited for him to continue. “A guy.” And realization hit Tony. His face lit up.
Harley and Morgan were left gawking at Peter and then at each other. They would have never guessed that. Apparently, they’d been very careful and extremely good at hiding the relationship. Harley ended up speaking first. “Wow. Okay.” He was still having a hard time hearing that. There was, after all, an enormous age gap between those two. “So, she knows something because of Remy.”
“Happy to hear.” Stephen remarked and Morgan ventured off to find her friends. “Where were we?” he continued.
Steve was shocked out of his mind when he woke the next morning beside a naked Natasha in her bed. He was equally naked, and he didn’t want to believe they had done what he thought they did. Nat tried to cover her body as best she could while Steve did the same. They really did it, huh?
Wade took a seat by Peter, drawing him into a half hug before he spoke again, ignoring the mention of Ned. “Your mother threatened me.” Wade explained.
Amelia was in her kitchen getting a bottle of water and Morgan used her phone to project Torunn’s screen when a notification popped up. She only then remembered she had something to share with Torunn that she and Amelia had discovered. She had gotten a post notification on Instagram from @pietromaximoff. Morgan opened the app on another screen before her.
“Tony.” He said, a frown marring his face as he stooped down and grabbed the vitamins. He examined the bottle and his frown deepened with obvious sadness. “You wasted no time.”
“Oh. Is you-know-who on the list?” Carol tilted her head to the side a bit and gave her a knowing look.
Anna then, grasped one of her hands with her bare one and Morgan screamed out in pain from the contact. Anna retreated seconds later, and Morgan stared at her completely mortified. “Anna? What the actual fuck?”
“It might be important.” Tony assured in and Stephen sighed; frustration written all over his face. He sat up once he had his phone and began typing away in response to the message he had received. Steve had discovered some new information about Hammer’s case.
“I know you would want me to have an abortion –” He started but was interrupted. He saw Steve shake his head as he spoke.
Brooklyn also had nothing of Tony’s. Not his nose, his eyes or eye shape or ears and clearly not his hair. Tony really felt as if he was just the carrier of a baby that was 100% Steven Grant Rogers and nothing else but to be fair, 3 of their other children looked more like him than Steve. So he could have this one.
birthday was good. Vision and Wanda had even made an appearance. Steve accommodated them while they figured out living arrangements in New York. The young couple shared their future plans with Steve.
“A son,” Sif added and Loki glanced from her to Thor to Torunn and back to Thor again gauging their reactions. Yes, Thor had out ruled the law that stated
He would be. He knew it. He had so much support. He just needed to get use to the idea of Tony not being there for him or the baby. And that was okay. He could do this on his own and SJ would never be in short supply for love.
“Okay. Get going babe.” Tony fanned him off when Steve was growing quiet again and Tony realized he was staring at him again, lovingly.
“Papa.” Winter called out as Bucky finished combing her hair. He was finishing the second braid before adding accessories. He was proud of how well he did her hair. When Winter was old enough to have her hair combed, Bucky was at a lost not knowing the first thing about caring for her tight curls. Luckily, Sam’s sister had offered to help, teaching her brother-in-law how to properly groom Winter’s hair type. Bucky welcomed the help and worked hard to learn all the different styles she could wear. Now, getting her hair done was just as enjoyable for Winter as it was for Bucky. It was a breeze.
“Wade.” Tony called out. Wade quickly pushed Peter away when he found the source of the voice calling his name.
That shook Peter. “No. I can’t even get pregnant.” That was ridiculous. Tony was giving him a knowing look. “Wait. I can’t, can I?”
“Except that it is, Morgan.” Anna pulled her eyebrows together and stared at her sister with doe-like eyes of innocence. “You were angry, didn’t want to talk about mom so I changed the subject.”
“What is it that he wants exactly?” Carol urged. The two women sat on one of her home’s balconies on patio chairs, cool drinks in their hands and sun hats and shades on. It was a beautiful summer day in July.
Nathan heard voices as he came downstairs, but he couldn’t make out the words. He did however recognize the female one and looking around the corner of the kitchen’s wall gave him a glimpse of the owner of the male voice. Remy LeBeau. He and Nat were conversing in hushed tones before Remy leant forward and whispered something in her ear. Nathan couldn’t hear it. Then the doorbell rung, and she agreed to whatever Remy had said. She quickly asked him to leave and he disappeared in seconds. She went to get the door and Nathan stayed hidden around the corner wondering why Nat would be sneaking around with Amelia’s father. His mind concluded with an affair right off the bat.
It didn’t take long for Tony to find what it was and once he identified it as a tiny piece of tech, he took it down to his lab for Friday to exam.  Tony and Rhodey watched and listened intently as Friday’s voice poured out of the speakers above them. “It seems to be a micro-camera and it’s live streaming sir.”
Bucky was fresh out of the shower when Sam entered their bedroom. He had taken Winter to school. Bucky was always paranoid for her safety and though they were lenient with other aspects of their daughter’s life, they wouldn’t let her ride the school bus.
“Of course. I never said we shouldn’t support her.” Tony said. “But what happened to reprimanding her?” Steve was quiet again, thinking. He refused to believe he put Morgan above his parenting. Did he? Then Tony spoke again. “What if it was Peter who had gotten pregnant?”
Sam came out of the kitchen, a water bottle with a straw in it in his hand. He handed it to Steve and Steve struggled to swallow. It was going to be a rough week. Sam spoke up afterwards, “Steve, I’m with Bucky on this. You can’t let him get away with attempted murder. We almost lost you and SJ.”
Steve hesitated for another second before he stepped out of the way and let Tony in. Steve closed the door behind him after he did and watched Tony take in the scene of his home. There were a lot of unopened boxes of full of items for the baby. It made the apartment feel smaller than the last time he was there.
“17 years. We were all walking on eggshells around each other for 17 years.” Nat sighed. Tears formed in her eyes as she thought about the awkward situation Justin Hammer left them in.
Morgan appreciated her parents playing nice. She could probably thank her grandma’s presence for that, but she’d take what she could get. Peter limited his interactions with his mom and Steve noticed. When he inquired about it, Tony glanced over at Peter asking him if he wanted to tell his father or should he?
. Steve and Tony had a small party for her birthday complete with Pepper and baby Amelia, Carol, Rhodey and a 2-year-old Jacob, Bucky, Nat and Maria. The party was fun. Everyone had left except for Nat. Tony was cleaning up when she approached him.
“So who’s taking care of you?” Stephen looked sympathetic. “You don’t look so good.” He added that for jokes, Tony supposed.
“You don’t think Tony can handle it?” Pepper took offense. She was raising Amelia on her own and unbeknownst to them, she was pregnant again. Tony could take care of his kids and they’d be there for him if need be.
Peter had brought Wade by a day after the whole debacle. Wade wasn’t the least bit worried about it but Peter was freaking out. They rode the elevator to the 3
Tony sighed. What could they do? Anna was 18. “Well, what do you want to do Nat? Steve?” He paused, glancing over at the father of his children and apparently Natasha’s too. “He’s your kid.” Their kid.
This pregnancy was a perilous one, at Tony’s age, their baby boy was at some risk and he wouldn’t let anything happen to them. Then Tony would roll his eyes because Kayla had been very clear, a little
“It’s okay Tony. Just take care of Morgan. I’ll take care of the project.” Pepper assured him and Tony was forever grateful for her. The call ended and Pepper saw Carol enter the room; she was reminded of Carol's extended stay in her home. She thought back to the conversation they had three weeks ago when Carol snuck into her house at 4 am after the incident with Rhodey. It wasn’t until Rhodey had called the morning after that they’d talked about it.
Anna grinned at Peter. “Mhm…I don’t know. Would be pretty cool though.” And she resumed her eating. Maria had cooked with the help of some staff and it wasn’t a surprise that the food was delicious.
“Oh. I’m sorry for not seeing that.” Bucky mumbled while he pulled her into a hug. “Does daddy know?” He wondered. She shook her head. “Can I tell him?
But Stephen wasn’t convinced. “I don’t want to cause any trouble. I just want to be a part of my child’s life.” He explained, advancing towards the couple. Steve step forward as well, coming face to face with Stephen and shielding Tony behind him.
Sam knew he was at fault. Bucky was good to him. Never gave him a reason to doubt before. The one time he had asked about Winter’s paternity, Bucky had answered him truthfully. It should have been enough; his husband’s words should have been enough. He let his paranoia get to him and he did something that hurt the man he loved, the man who gave him a child. Something they both wanted for so long. He should have trusted Bucky.
“I wish you’d have called first.” Tony lectured. Steve gave him an apologetic smile. As if he hadn’t gone out of his way to buy food and make his way over there on account of Harley’s text earlier, in hopes of…what, exactly? Stopping Tony from going on his date?
“What happened?” Harley asked, leaning in closer with Morgan. They kept their eyes on whichever parent was speaking at the time.
“Of course.” She said, pulling out her pad of paper and writing up a prescription. “We need to get you started on prenatal vitamins in the meantime.” Tony hated the sound of that.
Steve had heard of Howard and Maria’s son but never met him. Tony rarely stopped by at S.I. because Obadiah Stane, acting CEO was running the company’s operations. All while Tony was indulging in the sexual comforts of any man that he could find.
Tony was sitting with Steve in his living room. They were cuddling under a blanket while a movie played before them. Steve had his hands wrapped around Tony’s waist circling his belly button every now and then. Steve was glad to say he knew 90% of Tony’s body. He knew everywhere but between his legs and even though he found it a little strange at times, he respected Tony’s wishes because he just wanted him to be happy. He just always made it work.
“I ate your ass last night.” He mumbled against his cheek. “And I wanna do it again.” He grabbed Tony’s thigh. He stopped his hands descent.
Tony without a second thought, hugged him. This haunted him for years and now he was free. “It doesn’t make you a bad person. You have every right to feel this way. You get to finally move past this.”
Steve didn’t bother arguing. Strange was right. He pulled up a chair to sit on the other side of Tony. All they could do was wait and hope Tony would wake up. And Steve hoped that was soon because he didn’t know what he would do if Tony was lost to the world forever.
“– is just your sister.” Steve informed her. “Because that’s who the DNA results says she is.” That kept Morgan quiet as she sat back in her seat.
Nova answers gladly. “Attempted murder, if I’ve ever seen it and direct harm to Mr. Rogers and an unborn Nicholas Rogers.” She puts emphasis on the last statement. “At merely 4 months pregnant. How does that make Mr. Stark the better parent?”
Steve didn’t know why he even bothered. They were like the same person now after years of being together. That use to be him and Tony. “I know.” He acknowledged. “I just couldn’t bring myself to sleep with another man that wasn’t Tony.” It was a good notion but it still didn’t change the fact that he was sleeping with someone that wasn’t Tony, even if it wasn’t a man.
“Hey.” She hugged her brother. “Where’s everybody?” She asked. She only knew that Torunn was visiting Harley at MIT but nothing about anyone else.
The appointment went as planned. The doctor checked the baby’s heart rate, looked at the ultrasound, checked Steve’s weight and gave the duo some general information as Steve was entering his 5
Tony remembered that night. How he stayed up, waiting for his husband while he was out screwing his friend. The tears travelled down his cheeks, clouding his vision but he spoke in Steve’s direction. “How could you sleep with my friend?” then at Nat. “How could you sleep with my husband?”
“How long?” Sam was asking, how long would it take for Bucky to forgive him? How long would he have to stay away from their home?
Remy then found his voice. “I’m forever in your debt Steve, you and Tony for helping us – me…” He quickly corrected himself and extending a hand in offer of a handshake, he had yet to formally thank either of Anna’s parents prior to this moment. “…get out of this mess.” He finished and Steve met him halfway for the handshake while nodding in agreement. They had really helped Remy out because even experienced killers made mistakes, made slip-ups.
It was the need-to-know kind of business and Amelia did not need to know. He also didn’t have time to respond even if he wanted to. He was waiting for someone in the comforts of their bedroom.
“Steve, I have to ask.” Vision stated. “We heard about your past…with Natasha.” Steve nodded as Vision spoke. “Why her? Did you not have feelings for Tony anymore?” Steve stayed quiet. Vision spoke up again. “I hope I haven’t overstepped.”
He got inside the building and checked in at the front desk. Eventually a nurse took his weight, height, checked his blood pressure and he provided a urine sample among other things. While waiting to see Dr McIntosh, he was reminded of the extended waiting period he had in anticipation of Anna’s DNA results. He never doubted she was his and Steve’s until his other three put the idea in their heads. As Steve had suggested, they did another test – one where they were both present. They couldn’t afford any issues this time around, but Tony was almost a 100% sure Anna was their daughter. He felt it in his heart.
Steve got the check. He cashed it in a few days ago. It was an exuberant sum of money. More than enough for an abortion but he wasn’t going to do that. He was keeping his baby. And even if he wasn't financially stable, he had so much support from the rest of the team. Bucky was doing the most, coming with him to his doctor visits, helping him making the crib, figuring out the stroller and all the little things in anticipation of the baby. Right now, he was sitting in the waiting room with Steve at the doctor’s office. It was his 20 weeks check up. He had sent a text to Tony with the time and date and place of the doctor’s appointment but as expected, he didn’t show up. He could see Tony had read the message though and he was clearly ignoring him and that broke his heart.
“My Queen you should come inside,” she led Sif inside with that, giving Carol the once over. Valkyrie even did a double take.
Pepper had heard the splash and ran out with Morgan in her arms completely alarmed. Tony had reached the house by now and Pepper took in his very calm demeanor before asking what on God’s earth had just happened. Tony replied with “nothing” and Pepper spotted a soaking wet Steve coming from the direction of the dock. What was happening here?
“Don’t pull out Uncle Steve. I want everything,” Tony mumbled and that did it for Steve. The reminder that he was balls deep in someone that he considered a nephew was what usually took him over the edge. He was a few thrusts away from coming when Tony exploded underneath him. He came untouched and Tony sunk his nails deeper into his back. He knew he was drawing blood and his hands kept going through his hair. Steve felt his hole clenching around him and his thrusts getting sloppy. He released deep inside him, still giving Tony little strokes. He looked down into his eyes, both hands now gripping his ass and he kissed him again when a thought crossed his mind. He was falling deeper and deeper into this mess with Tony. He was falling in love and he wasn’t supposed to. The day Tony convinced him to have sex with him; he told him after, that it was just sex. He didn’t want a relationship then and he didn’t want it now. That was a given, given the situation but now, he wasn’t so sure.
What woke him minutes later, was Steve pressing a sweet kiss to his lips before a damp towel was wiping his lower regions. He finished the task quickly and placed another kiss to Tony’s cheek.
“Miss Marshall isn’t done with the exam yet.” Steve tried to explain. He stood and found himself towering over Tony.
“Mom. Dad. I’m your daughter. You know that.” Anna pleaded, hugging her mother. Tony embraced her, willingly. She had to be their little girl. There was too strong of a connection on his part. She had to be because he wouldn’t know what to think anymore if she wasn’t.
“What?” Anna spun around and narrowed her eyes at her. If she was faking innocence, she was really good at it because Morgan couldn’t tell if she was sincere or not in that moment. Anna was so confusing. She started to wonder if this was some weird power she had over people. She was just so hard to read at times.
Once Amelia had heard from her mother about Morgan’s misfortune, she made it a priority to see her best friend. Amelia wasn’t the least bit upset that Morgan’s parents had tried to keep this a secret. She knew it was too sensitive a matter to be going around sharing with everyone all willy-nilly.
Tony sighed into the hug. He could always just relax in Stephen’s arms. It was nice. They pulled away a little and Stephen pressed his lips to Tony’s. Tony let out a little moan when Stephen’s hands were cupping his ass.
“He was unfaithful to me during our marriage. Nicholas Rogers was actually conceived during our marriage.”
Tony halted his cleaning. He and Stephen were going to tie the knot at some point, but they hadn’t chosen a date yet. Stephen apparently had an epiphany when it came to their relationship, some sort of rude awakening following the Christmas party where he was so close to losing Tony, he didn’t want to wait to get married. Tony, on the other hand, wanted to take things slow. He was still recovering mentally from the incident and needed space. Stephen had done the opposite however and moved into Stark Mansion officially so they could always be together.
“Oh yeah.” The bartender, his name tag said Gary responded as rehearsed. “The Mrs. is pregnant again.”
“Do you still love Rhodey?” Pepper inquired. Where did her husband fit in with her new found feelings for a woman?
“I just think doctors are complete assholes and full of themselves. And I vowed to never date one.” Tony explained, playing with his beard. Stephen looked a little insulted, so he buttered him up again. “But that’s changed since I’ve met you.” And he took some comfort in hearing that.
“Yeah. I was hoping one of you would make me an aunt already. I love kids.” Anna spoke up. “But not for myself.” She added as an afterthought.
Pepper smiled at her. She loved and cherished her and Calvin so much. They didn’t have a father. She’d been doing this all on her own. She always wanted kids but not necessarily with anyone else, so she went the route of getting inseminated, not once but twice. She often wondered to herself if she was putting her kids at a disadvantage by not having a second parent. But Amelia and Calvin were perfectly fine as far as she could see and Amelia was almost 18. She did it for almost 18 years and they never seemed to be lacking in anything, physically, mentally or emotionally.
Tony considers Steve as one of his best friends in the group. Of all the avengers. They’re probably the closest. Not Clint. Not Nat. Not Thor and not even Bruce. But Steve, he would dare say, is his best friend. That’s it. Even when they spent their nights together in the same bed. Even when they screwed so much it started to feel like they were making love, on Steve’s part. Even though all the avengers knew. Even though Pepper was clueless. Even though all that stuff happened. He was just his friend.
“It’s just a hunch.” Peter provided, after listening quietly and Morgan shot daggers at her little brother.
He wanted to say. He refrained from it, however. Wade approached him, staring him down the way he did earlier but with arousal in his eyes. Peter smiled up at him. What was happening? What happened to waiting until he was legal? And why was he second guessing this? He wanted it.
“I’m heading out right now,” Steve was drawn out of his thoughts, his blue eyes meeting brown ones and Tony hesitated for longer than he’d hope to. “But, I’m sure Morguna and Pete would love some Shawarma.” He stepped out of the doorway and let Steve in before asking Friday to let his kids know their dad was here. “I have to go, Steve. Good night.” And then Tony was gone, the door closing behind him. Steve settled in the TV room with Peter and Morgan while they ate their food and questioned them soon after, “Who’s this guy your mom’s going out with, anyways?”
Binx was curled up by Morgan’s head but on his pillow. Morgan was still sound asleep under the covers, when he shut his bedroom door softly. He knew to be particularly quiet because she was a light sleeper. He moved Binx out of the way and over to the other side of the bed where she settled into a comfortable position and went back to sleep. He looked over at her and could hear soft breaths escaping her lips. Morgan was still asleep.
The plan was he’d help her get pregnant – Sharon had been trying for months to get pregnant, but Steve was
“Stopping by?” Morgan repeated, suspiciously. “Right.” She narrowed her eyes and smirked at her father.
“Peter Stark-Rogers do you kiss your mother with that mouth.” He teased. Peter groaned, turning himself over so they could see each other.
Bucky chuckled, stood and removed his clothes, exposing his naked body and crawled under the covers. Sam, who was equally naked, hardened at the sight of him. “You’re the only chocolate I want baby.”
Tony scoffed. Was he serious right now? “And who is right for me? You?” he grilled him. He was hysterical. “I don’t think I want to be cheated on again.” Why couldn’t Tony ever get pass this?
“He’s claimed your innocence, Torunn.” His voice was firm and Torunn’s eyes grew large. It was embarrassing. Even more so when she heard gasps and murmurs behind her, coming from the table. “Something that was to be saved for your husband.” Thor continued, making her feel small.
Steve was holding a small bundle when Tony found him. He could see an indisposed Sharon, resting on her hospital bed while the doctors got around to cleaning her up. Tony’s skin crawled. He shivered seeing all the blood, remembering his last delivery. They’d lost Paige and now they might be getting her back.
Torunn shrugged. “I don’t know what to say.” Because her mind was working to come up with possible answers for this new revelation.
The day he was to go home, Bucky couldn’t make it because of work so it was just he, Sam and Nicky that would be journeying home together. Sam had called, telling him he had to turn back home and get the car seat because of course he would forget that. Steve didn’t mind, part of him was dreading going back home. He had dozed off a little once he got Nicky to fall asleep following his breastfeeding and he planned to get dress soon so Sam wouldn’t have to wait.
“I just find that a little weird, babe.” He leaned closer to her. “Just yesterday, she was totally against it.” Harley explained. He wanted to believe she gained interest overnight, but Anna was always so persistent about her lack of interest or knack for technology, in any way, shape or form.
“You better be or you’re not getting any tonight.” Tony teased; arms now folded over his swollen breasts. Tony was stark naked, and Steve didn’t stop reminding him how glorious he looked.
“Are you alone?” Stephen questioned because he was getting just as aroused as Tony was and he wouldn’t mind doing it right here before they left for their date. But the sound of Maria and Peter’s voice informed Stephen and reminded Tony that they most certainly were not alone. And then Stephen wanted to at least greet his mother, but Tony stopped him.
He stops fighting. His arms are falling from Tony’s hands and going limp at his sides. It’s happening. Everything is getting fuzzy. He’s seeing dark spots. He’s letting go.
“And I want to see you in 4 weeks if you decide...” She trailed off and Tony nodded. It didn’t need to be said. “The sooner, the better.” She reminded him.
Peter knew the obvious answer, but he wasn’t going to say it. Instead, Wade did. “Probably sex.” He said, proudly like he’s just answered the million-dollar question and got it right.
“Harls.” She spoke clearly. Harley smiled even wider at the nickname. “What’s up?” Torunn set her phone down on her vanity so she could grab a brush to aid in detangling her golden mane.
Peter was being Anna’s guide around the Christmas party, conducting introductions with everyone she hadn’t met yet. Those proceedings paused when Wade texted him to inform him of his and Ellie’s arrival. Peter had asked his mother if Wade’s daughter could attend; Tony saw no problems with that.
Torunn made a face of disgust and Morgan faked throwing up before laughing. Amelia snapped out of her trance at the loud laughter. “I have. I’m just reminiscing. Like you guys never had crushes.”
Anna walked forward and enveloped Peter in a hug. She made sure to keep her skin away from any of his. “Please don’t tell anyone. Especially not mom or dad.”
Harley moved into the guesthouse a day before Peter and Anna’s 18th birthday by himself. Torunn wouldn’t be joining him for at least another week. She still had a few duties that required her constant presence on Asgard and Harley could deal with that knowing they’d be spending the rest of their lives together after she had joined him.
Steve had put Harley and Morgan to bed and was heading back to the party area to help Tony finish cleaning when he saw Nat still there. They had discussed the situation and Steve asked that they forget it ever happened and move pass it. Nat, however, wanted to tell Tony to clear her conscience.
She was fuming, lightning in her eyes before she excused herself and left the room, hoping to calm herself down. Harley soon went after her.
“But we can’t live apart.” She reminded him. “I’ll speak to my parents.” She really had no issues with giving up her crown if it meant she could be with Harley and be happy together.
All while Anna nodded and bowed slightly before her brother and new sister-in-law. “Your highnesses.” She stated, before heading in the direction of her sister.
“What?” Peter snapped. He just wanted to do it and get it over with. He wanted to know what all the hype was about, if it was as amazing as everyone said it was. The next thing he knew Wade pulled him to his feet and held him by his waist, Peter’s head tilted back, and their eyes stuck on each other.
“Don’t say it like that.” Bucky protested, placing the empty container in his kitchen sink and grabbing a bottle of wine from his fridge. He poured them both a glass. “But we are still trying for another baby.” Bucky added.
“Maybe.” Harley wasn’t confident in saying a definite yes, but he was getting closer to it. “Maybe she actually had a thing for Dad. Hammer was going to talk, and she
Without a second thought, Steve jumped out of her bed and began searching for his clothes and throwing them on when he did. He could see from the curtains that it was still very early in the morning. Gosh, he was supposed to get home to put Morgan to bed. Steve grabbed anything else he didn’t have on and was heading out Nat’s room door. He found his keys and wallet still in his pants pockets.
“He was going to give up his accomplice in a statement the next day.” Bruce explained. Natasha knew that too, but she didn’t appreciate the allegations being tossed at her like that.
“I had absolutely no energy to work on anything after last night.” He said suggestively and then she grabbed his face in both of her hands and kissed him passionately. Her memory of last night was still fresh in her mind. They were so good together in so many ways.
“Oh no. Cassie and Christie are enough.” Hope had enjoyed helping Scott with raising Cassie. She considered Cassie her own; a good kid, surrounded by so much love from 4 parents.
Stephen decided not to force the conversation and ultimately left the room. It had been a long night and he did need to rest. They’d talk about this again later because Stephen knew with everything, he’d heard from Rhodey about Hammer, chances of Tony and Steve rekindling their relationship were extremely high. But he couldn’t let that happen. He couldn’t let Steve Rogers take Tony away from him. He couldn’t let him win.
Steve took a moment to process what was said. Winning Tony's sons over would be harder than he thought. Harley especially.
“Steve.” He breathed. “I need you to fuck me like right now.” He didn’t like when Steve was too in control of the situation. He tended to get a big head. Pun intended. So Tony let go of him and leaned back on the counter, using his arms as support and spread his legs further so he could fit between his legs. Steve withdrew his curled fingers from Tony’s hole and stood back on his feet in an instant. Tony noticed Steve still had his pants on. He undid the buckle and dragged his pants and underpants in one go as far down as he could given this awkward position.
“I don’t know Harley. What was the age of the last girl you had sex with? Done any drugs? Drank any alcohol at your birthday party?” Steve went on and with each question, came a new state of shock, horror and embarrassment on Harley’s face. He could hear both Morgan and Peter trying but failing to stifle their laughter.
The duration of the summer brought Bucky absolute joy, Winter, time to gain some knowledge of the Wakandian traditions and customs – which she enjoyed and brought Sam anxiety.
“On it sir.” Friday responded within the second. Tony then addressed Peter who was still frozen in the doorway. “Peter? Sweetie, I need you to call your dad.”
Tony had completely forgotten about his date tonight with Stephen. Work was hectic these days. He and Pepper’s latest project was being launched next month so he was forever buried in his work. And he was also trying to plan a surprise party for Morgan’s 18
She also advised him to press charges against him if he ever showed up again. She explained to Steve; he didn’t have to worry about Morgan growing up without a dad. Tony had brought everything on himself and everything that was coming his way. And Morgan would be okay. She didn’t need that sorry-excuse of a man as her father in her life. Pepper knew it was just an excuse on Steve’s part. He was probably so afraid of taking action against Tony. He was after all, a very powerful and now highly dangerous man. A danger to Steve and their unborn child. But Tony was gone, completely disappeared without a trace.
“I know and I was wrong. I was wrong for sleeping with her, leading her on, letting her think we were in a relationship and getting angry at her for getting pregnant when we were sleeping together.” Steve ignored the fact that Sharon hadn’t even been carrying his child because he was lacking that information at the time.
Steve is pretty loud and Tony has to silence him because Pepper and Morgan are only a thin wooden wall away. His loving wife and gorgeous little girl are a wall away. His family is a wall away. So he’s going to need Steve to calm down.
“I promise you this one is yours.” He teased, trying to lighten the mood and although he made a joke of it, he really did hope they were getting their daughter back.
“Of course.” Tony answered, taking the bottle of water that was being handed to him. He sat on the sofa in Steve's living room and Steve joined him there as he drank the water. Steve watched him curiously.
“What is it? A trick? A spell?” Nertha stopped him right there. She feigned a level of dismay only Nertha could.
Steve tried to apologize. Tony glanced at Nat who had gone quiet on them. “So what is it? Are you two in love?” Because Tony couldn’t conjure up any other reason as to why they would do that to him. “How long has this been going on?”
“You’ve been avoiding me.” He confronted Steve, absentmindedly tidying his living room. “I woke up in the hospital and you weren’t there. You didn’t come to see me, even after I got out and we’ve barely had a proper conversation in over 3 months.”
Morgan’s door stayed open these days. She had a sketch pad in one hand and a pencil in the other as she sat crossed legged on her bed. She looked better than his mother had described 2 weeks ago when the incident took place. She even looked a little cheerful. And to see her sketching again was a good thing. Morgan was really good at it and had abandoned it years ago. She claimed she had outgrown it.
“Yeah you are.” He laughed as well. “I’m just a nurse at the M.R. building but you really have inspired me. Your work is phenomenal. There has never been a surgeon as great as you.”
“Morgan got pregnant and you guys didn’t even bat an eyelash.” Peter complained. Morgan felt uncomfortable. “Harley was sleeping with any and every one at my age and you two didn’t do a thing about it.” Harley thought about defending his past behaviour but decided against it. He let Peter speak. “I’m literally the only virgin left in this family.” Peter reminded them. The rest of his family listened intently.
Turning to face him, Tony leaned back on the dresser and watched Steve as well, who was sitting up in bed, sheets covering his lower half, and a sketch pad and pencil in either hand.
“I didn’t know either.” He explains in a small voice because Tony is angry and he doesn’t like when Tony’s angry. Tony acts out when he’s angry.
“Just the fight and that he’s the one who poisoned me.” They made it to his bedroom, sat Tony on the bed and started the removal of his clothes. Tony stopped his hands, letting him know he could handle it himself. Stephen complied, giving him some space. Tony let out a whimper every now and then.
Wade hated that Peter was stuck and unhappy in his home. He wished he could help in some way, but Wade knew Peter couldn’t move in with him, so he had to suggest the next best thing. “Why not stay with your father?” But they’d had this conversation several times before.
“You could always stay with me.” He suggested. Harley still lived on campus at MIT and Morgan had moved out of Stark Mansion weeks ago; Peter could do it too except that would mean leaving Anna behind.
“Honestly. My AI Karen got me all the dirt on you. There wasn’t much though. Just that you’re a hired assassin.”
“So please don’t mention this to my mother. I want it to be a surprise.” Anna continued. She stared at Torunn waiting to hear her response.
They watched Wade with Peter. He seemed harmless but then Harley was joining them on the balcony and all thoughts of
Steve, Tony, Bruce and Nat were seated in the living room. They were completely in the dark about the need for such a gathering. Steve thought Morgan was inviting him over so they could discuss Sharon being pregnant, but he saw that wasn’t the case when he found Bruce and Nat waiting with Tony. Bruce and Nat couldn’t begin to imagine what this was about, and Tony was getting a little worried. Morgan didn’t even want to talk about the night before, when he mentioned it. He was starting to think this gathering and that little bathroom incident were linked somehow.
“I can’t believe you kept this from me.” Steve complained, sitting up to line his leaking cock up with Tony’s clenching pussy.
“I’m good for now.” Jacob assured him. “Look, today’s your day.” He walked over towards the door, opening it and about to step outside. “And we have to go.” He pointed a thumb out the door. “Don’t wanna keep your future wife waiting.”
“Because that baby would be a part of you. I’ll love him or her regardless.” That was true. It was something he’d have to learn to deal with, to handle but he’d do it because that innocent baby would be half Tony Stark.
little girl. He should have known, she was his. But he was also beginning to think Bucky had told him about their fight. “I hope you two work pass this. He is a good man. As are you.”
plan. Where does a baby fit in? So the fact that Steve is standing on the patio of his lake house, claiming to be pregnant with his child has Tony completely baffled and confused.
“Technically, I didn’t –” and Tony lost his ability to speak when Steve pushed pass his folds with no warning and settled deep within him, brushing against his walls.
Sif touched his arm to gain his full attention. Thor knew this was something they’d have to discuss and decide together, alone. “Thor and I will decide.” Sif informed her. She thanked Nertha for letting them know and Nertha nodded, a smug smile etched on her face.
But maybe this was Tony's fault. He didn't like being alone and perhaps he saw something that wasn't there with Daniel. He thought they were in love but it didn't take too long for Daniel to start cheating and only use him for his money. Peter and Harley saw it and they weren't sure if their father was just overlooking the obvious so he wouldn't have to be alone.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Tony.” Steve uttered, a small smile growing on his lips as they made contact for the first time with the handshake. Tony’s eyes lingered on his naked chest and biceps before Peggy spoke again. She was leaving for her office.
“That’s why you’re never getting married Harley.” Amelia teased. Harley could care less. Marriage wasn’t for him. Nor were relationships.
“Must be a pretty big gift if you guys kept it upstairs.” Morgan noted, leaning on her dad for support. Steve brushed her hair back and kissed her forehead.
That was the other thing with their father, they never found out about his latest boyfriend or lover or fiancee until he was weeks away from marrying them and there was nothing they could do about it. He never listened to them but they always tried.
“A little.” He admitted. “I thought I might lose you.” Tony reached out and took one of Stephen’s hands in his.
“It’s not necessary. We don’t need a piece of paper to show our love. We don’t need society telling us how to live.”
Peter stared at his mother in horror. “Mom. You’re dropping a lot of information on me right now. A lot of relevant information. 16 years into my life.” This was a lot.
“Very.” Morgan snarked, smirking at Harley. She couldn’t even be mad at her brother and one of her best friends. She just wished one of them would have mentioned it before it got out in the open like this.
“Tony, you don’t need to apologize for anything.” Steve promised. There was no need for him to be forgiven. He passed the entire box of tissues along. Tony pursed his lips and smiled. He let Steve continue talking. “I want you to know I never cheated on you with Sharon either.” He whispered above him. “That fight we had at the airport those years ago. I never did anything with her.”
“Right.” Gamora settled, reaching across the table for some food. “It’s almost always someone close.” Her years of fighting equipped her with that knowledge.
That was going well. Cassie was newly 18 and Pietro wasn’t opposed to going on a few dates with her. She was appreciative of Morgan and Amelia for setting things up for her. Now they were dying to get details about Pietro.
didn’t sleep together until mid-May, Mother’s Day.” He informed him. Kayla was always accurate. She was great at her job, had been for years. Steve couldn’t, shouldn’t doubt that but he did.
“It’s going to be okay.” He tried to assure her before Peter and Torunn came bargaining in. They’d heard the scream too. Peter was shocked out of his mind and stood frozen at the doorway. Torunn had her sword in hand; ready to fight at a moment’s notice. She dropped it when she saw the scene before her, running to her friend’s side. Tony let Torunn take Morgan into her arms as he spoke to Friday. He needed to act quickly.
e, leaving the conversation with Anna and Morgan. At that point they knew they needed to talk to Anna
Steve chuckled, leaning closer to kiss him sweetly, slowly. “You are so snappy today.” He kissed Tony again.
“I’m so sorry.” Nat expressed her regret, but Tony was growing tired of hearing it. Those words weren’t going to fix anything, and his anger consumed him as he started throwing glasses and plates at them. He was livid.
Shock then anger overcame Tony nd he shoved Stephen breaking from his hold.. “Get the fuck away from me!” He shouted and that's when Steve returned, shielding Tony with his body from Stephen's hateful gaze. Anger seethed through him.
“I throw a birthday party for them and they disappear.” Tony mumbled and Steve chuckled. “I feel so underappreciated sometimes.” He went on and Steve tried to brighten his mood.
“We have to trust Peter.” Tony explained, helping Steve unfold his arms and touching the crease that was forming on his forehead so he would relax. “You know he’s a good kid. He’s probably the most sensible one out of the three.”
“Okay. I understand. Thank you for telling me.” She really was grateful that Amelia willingly confided in her. It wasn’t her business after all.
“It takes time that’s for sure but don’t hinder the process any longer.” His eyes darted back and forth from both his children. “Talk to your father, let him know how you feel and try to move on. It’s hard to forget, I know.”
Lila perked up. “Okay. I’ve been talking over the phone with Nathan’s cousin or Aunt Nat’s nephew actually.” Morgan was less than pleased at the mention of Natasha. She’d been meaning to reconcile with her after uncovering the truth about the affair with her father. She just hadn’t gotten around to it yet. “Jaime. He’s visiting for Christmas and I think he really likes me, so we’ll see how that goes.”
Steve frowned; his mouth opened slightly with a gasp of disbelief. Tony had never said that before. He knew Tony wasn’t in the best of moods that day, but he never knew Tony considered it one of his worst days.
Tony had been working on a new project with Bruce for the past few weeks and he figured he’d let his son have a go at it. No they weren’t avenging anymore but creating things had always been a hobby of his so he wouldn’t be stopping that anytime soon.
“It’s not yours.” He blurted out and Steve chuckled because why would he ever believe that? What would be story behind the baby not being his? That Tony had cheated? Never in a million years. Steve knew that.
Clint shook his head and tsked. “I would.” He grabbed a biscuit from the plate before them. Natasha stared at him with confusion. She couldn’t understand the newfound resentment towards Steve, Tony and their children so she changed the subject altogether.
“Your Uncle Loki will show up soon enough. He has always been of his own way.” Thor explained. In all his years, Loki was one thing that never changed. Torunn finally turned her eyes to Valkyrie. It was nice to see another familiar face but it was strange that she would stand as a guard for anyone of the royal family. They all could fend for themselves. They were Gods and skilled warriors alike.
“Loki!” Thor spoke next, hugging his brother even tighter than Torunn did. “I thought I’d never see you again.”
Right now, her hands were glowing and Rhodey could hear and see her and Sif shouting at each other from where he stood but he wasn’t able to make out the words. Jacob and Amelia noticed the ruckus too.
Tony focused on his breakfast though. Eating one of Steve’s homemade and from scratch, pancakes. He sighed with delight. Oh, how he missed Steve’s cooking.
“Yes, but Amelia doesn’t need any of that.” Pepper assured her. When would she possibly need to use them? The avengers had left the world a better, safer place.
Stephen got on his feet and faced him. “We’re engaged Tony.” He snarked. “I’m about to be your husband and I can’t go a day without hearing about your ex.” Tony set his phone down and took a deep breath. Maybe this was a given, his fiancée was bound to get upset about all this time he spent with Steve but...
When the dinner commenced, the room was mostly quiet. His children only spoke amongst each other and with their grandmother.
“Our kids.” Tony popped the bubble whilst releasing his hand. Steve eyes opened and they both stared at the sliver of morning light that slipped under the many layers of sheet. “I feel like we rarely, if ever, see them.” He squirmed a bit, getting more and more comfortable in Steve’s embrace. Steve was budding an erection with Tony’s bare ass rubbing against his cock.
“Don’t say that.” Tony groaned. “I don’t want to ever think that.” Stephen lay back in bed and folded his arms behind his head, staring at the ceiling. Tony pulled himself up, using his elbow for support and resting his head in his hand.
“Are you really?” Carol teased. Pepper has been single most of her life. Surely even she gets lonely sometimes. Everyone craves human companionship every now and then. Not Pepper Potts apparently.
he thought but “Maybe we should hear Peter out.” He gestured to Peter who was now crying silently on one end of the sofa.
“No!” she countered, stepping out of the bathroom, her hair now in a ponytail. “This is me and Valkyrie hanging out. Being friends.” She paused, narrowing her eyes at him. “James, I can have friends.”
“What? No. That’s none of his business.” Tony rolled his eyes for the second time in their conversation. “Look baby. Thanks again for helping with the model. I’ll talk to you later. Love you” and he hung up before Harley had a chance to respond.
“It’s okay, Kayla.” Tony assured her. “Mistakes happen. We’re fine.” So, Kayla could make mistakes it seemed, as Steve had suggested, and she’d never know how that simple mistake caused Steve and Tony to question everything. Tony supposed there was a first for everything and Kayla could easily be forgiven.
“He is so precious, Sif.” Hope commented, tickling the little baby’s sides. Magni let out squeals of laughter. “Look at his little chubby cheeks.”
They had become good friends long before their kids started dating and often made lunch dates so they could hang out more given their busy lives. Carol hadn’t let avenging go so easily though. There were so many other planets out there that still needed help. She was constantly going back and forth from planet to planet. It put a little strain on her relationship with Rhodey but she had to remind him, that she had this amazing power and it would be selfish of her not to use it to help others.
When Tony woke the next morning, a Monday morning at that, he saw Steve staring at him, a shit-eating grin on his face. He felt almost clean, remembering Steve had cleaned them both up before going to sleep. Tony smiled and his mouth was soon captured in a kiss. Tony forced him away and Steve looked back at him, like a hit-puppy, confusion settling on his brows.
“Look.” Steve began, interrupting anything else Morgan may had hoped to add. “We have some news.” He paused. “Your mother’s pregnant.” Silence returned to the air.
“Let me go!” Peter screamed, turning around and coming face to face with his chest. He banged at it in anger and despair, oblivious to the tears now cascading down his cheeks. “You left me!” he huffed. Wade still held him tight. “You left me without a word. You can’t just come back like nothing happened. I hate you! I hate you so much! Let me go!” He ranted and raved. Desperate to be free from Wade’s arms. Desperate to be free from Wade. He didn’t want to care for him anymore because all he got was hurt.
Stephen’s happiness didn’t falter. He accepted; just glad they were starting this journey. Tony’s phone went off and by instinct he reached over to grab it. Stephen stopped him. “Leave it.” He pleaded, his grip on his waist tightening and his lips found Tony’s. He reciprocated, allowing Stephen to grope his ass and succumbing to the affection.
Jacob’s eyes widened at the mention of Nertha. “I am not sleeping with the daughter of the Goddess of Death. I value my life. And I love Amelia.”
Nicholas James Rogers came peacefully into the world. He didn’t cry. He didn’t scream and his eyes were closed. Steve panicked when he saw this. He grew frantic of the thought that his son might have not made it. Bucky and Sam, who were by Steve’s side tried to calm him down. He was moving too much in panic and the doctors hadn’t even closed him back up yet. But the doctors rectified that quickly, slapping the baby’s bum and little Nicky let out the most ear-splitting scream. He was alive.
“Okay.” Wade grunted out, feeling the squeeze of Peter’s walls around him. He could deal with that because he never wanted to stop either.
Tony uncovered the location of Hammer’s home. He and Rhodey were sneaking into the building dressed in full suits of armour. The place was dark and dingy, but their suits enabled them to see around. Friday scanned the area for any signs of life. The moment she detected life, a large stand of light filled the entire room and a voice was heard from a series of speakers bordering the perimeter.
I'm always afraid I give things away but glad to know my subtly is still subtle. I've actually given away alot of plot points so far ✨
day of May. He was scheduled with Dr Kayla McIntosh – his doctor whom had been there to monitor all three of his pregnancies. Tony wouldn’t trust anyone else. He would have gotten an earlier date, but she was fully booked until mid-June. And he didn’t see the need for any sort of hurry, so he didn’t bother asking her to try squeezing him sooner. He hoped Stephen would understand. Until then, they’d keep trying on their own.
Harley stared at the wall where his mother was projected moments ago prior to picking up his phone and sending a few text messages.
Tony and Tate sit up straight. Steve is hoping this will playout in his favor and the rest of the court waits patiently as the video starts to play. It’s a video that clearly shows Tony pushing Steve in the lake all those months ago. Tony walking away. And a four-months pregnant Steve struggling to get up onto the dock.
At the reception, the Princess and the new Prince were gifted with many presents and congratulated by many people from all over the galaxy. Steve and Tony, practically wrapped around each other were the last two people they talked with before they were truly left alone at their table. Harley smiled when he saw them approaching their table. He got up and hugged them at the same time.
“Oh god!” Tony screamed. He was going to cum soon and Steve knew it, yanking Tony’s pants and underwear down and fully exposing his lower half and his hole. Steve slipped a wet finger in from holding the base of Tony’s cock. Another followed soon after and Tony tighten around them as they curled and beckoned his orgasm.
Harley stuttered for a second before he mustered up some confidence. “She’s seventeen, Dad. That’s a 2-year difference. Totally legal.”
The Stark-Rogers children didn’t like that at all, didn’t like being in a place that no longer felt like home.
“I want you to suffer. I want you to watch as your family suffers, and your life falls apart before you...” His eyes darkened behind his glasses and a grin spread across his face when Tony realized what he was referring to.
“Where are you going?” Stephen asked, seeing his full outfit for the first time; he was in full black. He grabbed Tony’s arm.
“Fury says two people got into SHIELD the night Hammer was killed.” Tony explained, peering down at his phone as he sat in bed, waiting for Stephen to join him. Fury had been keeping him and Steve informed about the investigation. They were still at risk - in danger. It was hard for him to sleep at nights knowing someone else was out there trying to hurt him and there was nothing he could do about. “That’s one more person than I thought a month ago that still has it out for me and Steve.” He shouted in the direction of the bathroom.
Steve listened as Tony provided details about the murder. Everyone knew it wasn’t Sharon because she was still in custody when the killing happened. As a matter of fact, she would soon be in prison serving time while her cousin on Peggy’s side of her family got custody of her daughter, Shari Margaret Carter.
Gamora could agree. Those two were constantly trying to out-do each other but it made a good friendship. The three women laughed remarking at how easy their partners made it to poke fun at them.
“Maybe she’s finally gained an interest.” Torunn informed him, trying to justify Anna’s actions. She didn’t want to believe Anna could have lied to her.
“You’ll always be my baby.” Tony squeezed his son again. “Enjoy my love. You’ll miss it when I’m gone one day.”
.” Steve sighed, trying to lower his anger. His eyes watered because even in this moment of life or death where Tony’s life was on the line, Stephen Strange hadn’t failed to remind him that Tony was his in every sense of the word. Tony was only his to worry about. Apparently.
“What’s happening?” Tony cried, searching the other doctors’ faces for an answer. Steve watched them hook up the unmoving baby to different machines trying anything to make her breathe on her own.
“I have to make sure, baby.” She squeezed his palm, remembering his past falling outs with Steve. They were never easy, and she was always there for her son.
“We’ll do another test.” Steve stated as Tony stared at him with teary eyes, still locked in the embrace. Then he looked to his three – that he was certain of – children. “But I need you three,” He pointed them out. “To stop pointing fingers with no solid evidence.” Steve thought they were smarter than that.
Was it possible for a person to love two people the same way? Pepper had thought about it a lot while Carol had made herself at home for the past 3 weeks. She was helping herself to everything in her home, from her food to her clothes. She was in a suit of Pepper’s pyjamas right now as a matter of fact. Carol had no desire to go back home for clothes if it meant seeing Rhodey so soon, at the time. She was ashamed, humilated and disappointed in herself for falling for someone else when she was already happliy married.
The next thing he knew, Steve was working his warm hand over Tony’s hardening cock. His thumb brushed over the sensitive tip, oozing with precum. Tony moaned again and his cock was engulfed in the heat of his mouth. Steve moved up and down, wetting his cock and peering up at Tony’s aroused eyes as he did. He could feel the veins on the shaft pulsing as he pulled off only slightly before grazing his teeth on the sensitive mushroom-shaped head. He swallowed all the precum that would bead at the slit.
. They ended up in his room and Peter made certain the door was locked before jumping into Wade’s arms. Their mouths joined in a heated kiss and Wade sat on the edge of the bed with Peter straddling him.
“Steve sketched a million and one portraits of me during all 3 of my pregnancies. And took too many pics. Want me to go get a photo album?” Tony asked, poking fun at him.
“With our lives, more children are out of the question.” Gamora explained. “And Quill is already a handful.” The two women snickered. Gamora had two children of her own with Quill; a 9-year-old boy called Zoi, and a 5-year-old girl named Toria.
“What’s up?” Tony’s voice was laced with concern. Peter was radio silent. “You’re not pregnant too, are you? It’s like everyone’s pregnant these days.”
Peter decided to hang out with both Ned and Mj today. He wanted to share with his two closest friends the truce Carmelita Camacho had initiated for some sort of rivalry Peter was even aware they had.
When a day passed, and Tony hadn’t woken, Steve begged his kids to go home and get some rest. He promised he’d call them when Tony woke. They left reluctantly.
His joy turned to ash in his mouth and was replaced by a sadness, some regret, hurt and...and pain. There was a pain in his side. A pain in his chest. No. A pain below. A sharp pain right below his heart.
“They are.” He assured her. “It’s really badass, sis.” Anna smiled, happy to know she was in another family that accepted her even though her powers were so extreme.
Tony was startled out of his sleep when he heard a scream. He shot up. He could feel himself shaking all over. He spoke into the darkness. “Fri, what’s happening?”
Maria Stark let out a little cough. Morgan and Anna turned to their grandmother and snickers travelled across the table. “What am I? Chopped liver?”
Steve is shocked; Tony has only ever been this rough during sex. “Tony, stop. That’s hurting,” he pleads.
At this point, Loki had already greeted everyone and was taking an empty seat at the dining table. Maria helped him prepare a plate. “Oh, thank you Maria. And I must say you look as radiant as ever.” He commented.
“No!” he almost shouted. “I love Peter. I want to be with him. I’m not going to take advantage of him.” Steve stared at him. He could sense a hint of sincerity in Wade’s words. “I want to marry him…” Steve raised an eyebrow. “…one day.”
“Hi Dad.” Anna smiled, her voice sweet, angelic and almost child-like – her ‘dad’ voice, that Steve was sure she picked up from Morgan. She pushed Remy even further away and approached her father, meeting him face-to-chest, no longer fazed by his appearance.
“Wow. That obvious and I missed it.” Stephen sighed, closing his eyes. “Maybe it was Steve. Maybe Steve poisoned me…”
Morgan had been mum long enough. She wasn’t oblivious to the way both of her parents always babied her little brother. “Dad. Mom. What happened to no judgements?”
Upon returning from Wakanda, Sam and Bucky spent more time together making love and reassuring each other that they only belonged to each other than ever before. They couldn’t get enough of each other, really. So much so that Sam’s unsettling confession about his jealously and his audacity to accuse Bucky of giving him another man’s child was never brought up again.
“Dad aren’t you going to do something about that Wade guy?” Harley shared a few striking qualities with Steve. His overprotectiveness of his little brother was one such quality.
Harley handed Peter a box of tissues that was close by. He wiped his eyes and settled his breathing. Everyone left the floor open for him.
Morgan smiled sadly. She had no issues with still living at home before she’d decided she wasn’t going to college anymore and the incident at the Christmas party. Now, however, her home didn’t even feel like home and she didn’t want to be there anymore. Things had changed.
Loki chose to overlook what he believed to be a lie and carried on with the conversation. “You do. So why do you not wish to marry him?”
When Steve Rogers met Tony Stark, he was newly 20 years old and still being subjected to the whims of Margaret “Peggy” Carter. The Super Soldier division were running tests on him one day in July of 1996 when Tony stopped by at Stark Industries.
“Sure.” Morgan smiled before turning to Anna. “Can we talk for a second?” Harley gave her a knowing look. He didn’t want thinking blowing up at his wedding reception if Morgan tried to confront Anna and things went left but Morgan purposely ignored his non-verbal warning as was typical Morgan Stark-Rogers behaviour. He sighed.
Jacob stopped his story to address the use of the nickname. “Since when do you call Amelia that?” He raised an eyebrow, looking from his girlfriend to Harley.
“I didn’t know we were lying in this house again,” Of course his mom would guilt trip him like that.
“You spend all this time, alone with him at his home.” Tony could hear the anger and jealousy in his voice, even with his back turned as he pulled on his boxers. “You’re always texting him or talking to him on the phone –”
“Anna’s dangerous.” Harley concluded. They needed to stop beating around that fact. “And we don’t know how much she helped Aunt Nat and/or Remy LeBeau.” In his mind, he saw them as all guilty until proven otherwise.
“Anna killed Hammer.” Morgan explained, loud enough so everyone could hear, and Anna came waltzing over to her. Steve’s head spun around and Tony met his eyes as they shared a look before they both focused on their children.
“And I’m sorry Pete.” Steve swapped seats with Harley and Peter let Steve hug him. “I know we’re tough on you. I just want you to be better than your brother and sister. They’re already just so fucked up.”
all the time.” Peter started. Wade probably knew everything, really. “You know my name, my family, and my friends. You know what I look like”. He got a nod with each statement he made and even though he couldn’t see his face, Peter knew he was pretty damn pleased with himself. “I think it’s only fair you tell me about you or at least take off your mask.”
She was so lost in her thoughts that she didn’t realize she was crying until Nathan kissed her wet cheek. He wrapped his arms around her, and she smiled through her tears. Nathan was the only person she ever let see her this vulnerable. She had to be strong for everyone else; for her brothers, for her friends and for her parents.
He was sitting on his living room sofa, a book in his hand and a blanket on his lower half. Steve had had dinner with Bucky over an hour ago and so he settled in with one of his baby books, his side table lamp being the only source of light. He noticed Bucky had left his phone. He’d only left 10mins ago and wondered if he’d realize and come back. If not, Steve had already sent a text to Sam to let him know, Bucky had left it at his place.
“Come on.” She insisted, quickly downloading the Instagram app. “You’re a good-looking guy. Instagram was made for people like you. And besides you could really put Harley to shame.” Nathan snickered, as he did at all her jokes.
“Gosh. I love you so much.” He stated, punctuating each word with an upwards thrust and he flipped Tony over, so he was on top. Tony whimpered and Steve attacked his neck, his hands gripping his ivory skin so hard, Tony could feel marks forming. Moments later and Steve flipped them over again, so Tony was under him, with his legs open and seductively inviting. He was now better able to slam into Tony and cherish the deepness and warmth of the man around his erection. More groans and moans followed, and Steve finished inside Tony as they shared another kiss.
I didn't plan for this story and when I was "peer pressured" (for a lack of better words) into writing more than a one shot, I struggled after a minute...
The members of the jury mumble in agreement among themselves. Nova closes with that and Steve gives her a half smile.
Tony had been staying at Carter’s Mental Health facility for the past 2 years. Steve knows Tony isn’t mentally ill in any way but it was either this or jail. When Lance Tate had shown up dead only a day after the custody battle was lost, the evidence all pointed to Tony. Tony had choked the man to death, his fingerprints where around his neck. But Tony was always too calculated to wind up in jail. A few bribes here and there, and a couple sexual encounters with the right people and Tony’s case was ruled as a mental health issue rather than murder.
“You’re going to regret humiliating me Tony.” Justin screamed. This was getting out of control, Tony thought. He and Rhodey hadn’t fought in over five years. They were out of practice and out of shape and too old for this. He was through playing games with Justin. He shot a blast from his suit’s back repulsors that were powerful enough to destroy the source of the missiles and take down most of the ceiling and structure of the building.
Today she thought she saw Steve smile when the doctor told them they were having a girl. She wanted to go over baby names with him, but he let her know he had other things to attend to and drove off, leaving her at the doctor’s office. She finally got the door open, walked into her apartment and shut the door behind her with her foot.
As Stephen's mind wondered, Tony fell into a deep slumber with thoughts of finding Paige filling his dreams.
Peter sat on his bed first as Tony got into a sitting position. Peter placed the tray of food on the bed side table and hugged his mother before he ruffled his light brown hair. “Good morning, mom.”
“Yes. Twins.” Steve explained, proudly. “Sam’s and Bucky’s.” he finished, adjusting Nicky on his hip. He was really heavy now and harder for him to carry as he got further along.
It was like he disappeared. Not even Karen could track him down. He had just disappeared. Like he never existed. And Peter knew if he gave it a little more time, he’d start to believe it himself; Wade never existed. But he did. He knew he did. The necklace around his neck was proof of that. But it had been over a month now. And his mind was conjuring up crazy ideas.
Stephen sighed, took a deep breath and kneeled before him. He said his next words, carefully, lovingly. “But it did happen and because of it we found each other.” He took both of Tony’s hands in his.
When Steve stopped by that Sunday morning, Bucky had answered the door in a robe. His hair was a mess – Steve knew just-fucked hair anywhere, his face was red, there were hickeys littering his neck and collarbone and there was a little limp in each step he took. Bucky had to clear his throat before speaking. He was hoarse from screaming no doubt.
Tony averted his eyes. He’d heard that before. When he was younger and still new to the whole dating thing but that was a long time ago. He opened his mouth to speak but got cut off.
“Yeah. I got my mom’s name. She had me before she even met Misha and my real father had already passed.” Jaime explained, as if that was common knowledge. Morgan listened intently. She hadn’t even known Misha Kozlov wasn’t Jaime’s biological father. Did Nathan know this? She glanced at her boyfriend, who had Binx in his arms at that moment and distractingly petting her fur. At least she was aware, Jaime was short for James, but everyone called him Jaime similar to how no one called her mother Anthony. It was always simply, Tony.
He decided to call Pepper, being her best friend, she might know where she was. That was a dead end but as long a she had her on the phone he shared the events of the previous night with her. When Pepper was all caught up she let Rhodey know what she thought.
“Do you hear yourselves?” Steve wondered out loud. “You four are so spoilt and entitled.” Morgan made to counter but was quickly cut off. “And not to mention, extremely inquisitive. When are you four going to grow up?”
Tony could sense the worry in just those two words and had to assure him all was well. Steve Rogers really was such a worrier.
“I love you.” Wade stated, a smile gracing his lips as Peter stared up at his scared face. Peter caressed his cheek lovingly – he couldn’t stay mad at Wade and Wade in turn, kissed his exposed throat. “I just want our first time to be special.” Wade explained in a whisper and kissed his lips this time. Peter welcomed it, moaning as Wade’s hands travelled to his rear and it was being groped.
“We can do it again when Harley is here for Spring Break next month,” Tony finally spoke. Maria emerged from the kitchen again and they were able to start dinner.
“We would have done the same for any of you. We always put you four first.” Tony reminded them even though they knew they collectively had a favourite.
“I wanted to ask you for Dr McIntosh’s number.” Peter explained. Dr Kayla McIntosh was Tony’s primary doctor.
And Amelia almost laughed. She didn’t have a father. She was the product of her mother being inseminated and she let him know that. Amelia wondered though, after she said it if it was true. She’d never doubted it before but parents lying was like a crazy new trend as of late. She would, however, give her mother the benefit of the doubt stating, “You must have the wrong Pepper Potts.”
Pepper got quiet again, thinking things over. There he was, trying to manipulate her, praising her parenting, trying to get under her skin but she wasn’t easily fooled. “I think you give yourself far more credit than what is due.”
“Neither have I.” Peter added. They were in the same boat and Peter convinced himself he should have already known this. Wade always told him, he was the first and only guy he’d ever been romantically involved with.
“Sure, and besides,” She added as a matter of fact. “Jacob is seeing someone new and we’re okay as friends.” Pepper was a little surprised to hear that. She wondered if Carol knew. “So, what were you and Remy talking about?” She smiled, suggestively.
“You think she’s lying?” Tony met her eyes on the screen. The cooking video paused each time he looked away.
Steve was happy to hear that. He and Tony had learnt the extend of her powers and they feared for her safety and anyone else if she became involved in crime-fighting. Charles Xavier had told them; Anna was far more powerful than she realized. They didn’t know what they’d do if that day ever came.
“Mom. Hey. I just sent you the model,” came Harley’s voice as his face appeared on a holographic monitor in Tony’s lab. It was clear he was using his phone to project an equally similar monitor before himself in his dorm room. “Took me a few days but I finally figured it out.”
Tony had stayed home from work today and Stephen had come over after working late the night before. Stephen rolled off Tony before pulling out of him and tossing the used condom in the bin by the bed. He turned to face him again and started sucking on his neck. “Stephen,” Tony moaned. “I don’t want to have to explain a hickey to my kids.” Tony always thought of his children as little kids even though his youngest was 16. Stephen was confused at times, knowing good and well that a 16-year-old knew about sex and if their mother was dating again, he sure as hell would be having it.
He was going to meet Stephen Strange tonight so he told Peter and Morgan bye, grabbed his keys and opened the door only to come face to face with Steve. He was wearing a tight grey long-sleeved shirt that was rolled up to his elbows and a pair of jeans. He looked good, too damn good and he could smell Shawarma coming from the bags in his hand.
Torunn woke and couldn’t find Harley. He came home a few days ago. His finals were over, and he was on summer break. Harley was still trying to figure out school for himself after he and Torunn get married. If he was going to be living on Asgard how could he possibly attend school?
. Eventually, he met Valkyrie formally and the situational relationship became very real for him. Jacob became a little distant from the trio at that point on and was only able to block it out when they’d announced it publicly to everyone else.
Eventually, Steve pulled himself together and helped Tony wipe away his tears. He kissed his forehead and asked Tony where they’d go from here.
Morgan decided to send her a quick text. Maybe she’d be interested in Pietro. Torunn lingered on screen and Amelia went to answer her front door following the ringing of the doorbell. Pepper was expecting a package today; Amelia figured that’s what it was – UPS or FedEx dropping it off. Instead she opened the door and found herself in the presence of a man dressed in a long open coat standing before her. His eyes were red with black sclerae, his hair was dark auburn, and he had a deck of cards in one hand.
“I asked first, Wade” he countered in a heartbeat because he wasn’t going to let him get under his skin tonight.
Clint commented that the kid would really be in for something with parents like Wanda and Vision. Steve had to agree, remarking that he was now a part of a bigger family.
“No touching,” Steve instructed, sucking on Tony’s clit. He had waited months to touch Tony; to see all of him and he didn’t want anyone else to. Not even Tony himself. “I have to make up for lost time.” Tony whined, wiggling beneath him. He felt helpless with one of his sense missing.
But Wade didn't get it. He never gets to see Ellie. He hadn't seen her up close in almost two years. He just sneaks little peeks at her from a distance. His ex and her mother, Carmelita Camacho didn't want Wade in his daughter's life. Ellie didn't even refer to him as her father because she wasn't really sure who he was. Carmelita always kept Ellie away.
Today was her new baby brother’s presentation day. As the name suggested, the little Prince was to be presented to the people of Asgard. The people were overzealous to get even the slightest glimpse of their Prince. The members of the royal family gathered in the inner room that led to the palace’s grand balcony. Torunn, Loki, Hela and Nertha were awaiting Thor and Sif’s arrival with the baby. Torunn was briefing her family on the scandalous revelation that had surfaced at Tony’s Mother’s Day Brunch, the month prior. Loki sat with Torunn on a sofa, Hela stood by the window looking out at the screaming people and Nertha sat on the armrest of the sofa.
“You’re right.” He had to agree with that. Natasha Banner didn’t sound right. “You can keep your last name.” he resorted. He was ready for anything she would throw at him.
Tony’s eyes widen as jealousy and insecurity rose in his chest. “What model?” He wondered. “She won’t be naked, right?”
“Mom.” She responded in the same voice, but she also sounded delighted. “I’ve only just got you and Dad back and I would love if you guys got back together and stayed in the same house but it’s your life. None of us are babies. What you do in your love life shouldn’t matter to us.”
birthday. Steve watched his son enjoy his birthday party with his friends. This Wade Wilson guy hadn’t showed up yet and Steve was okay with that. He was enjoying his son’s party until Stephen Strange made an appearance. Lucky for Stephen – because Steve wasn’t opposed to breaking his nose again – all Stephen had done was hand Tony a gift which he presumed was for Peter at the glass doors then he was on his way until his eyes met Steve’s. So, he put on a show of making out with Tony inappropriately and groping his ass. He smirked at Steve before leaving and he found a blushing Tony when he headed back into the party. Steve scoffed.
