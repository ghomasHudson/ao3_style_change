No one says that out loud of course, so Steve does before Stark or some politician can convince them all that’s not exactly what they’re doing:
is everyone who can make it to the Compound. Bucky and Nat. Tony and Rhodey. Vision. Sam. Pepper, maybe. And Steve. It’s everyone available and yet…
“I meant Stark,” Bucky interrupts and Steve blinks, confused. “That’s the real question right? If he’s calling in doctors, what does he want from me?”
“We’re definitely not in Kansas anymore, Toto,” he mumbled as he nursed the delicate bones in his wrist, pain singing sharply.
Steve tried for a graceful exit. “There’s juice on the table, granola bars in the grocery bag. Do you need anything else?“
“No.” The irresistible smell of ripeness wasn’t enough to cover the rottenness of fear or the fact Tony couldn’t quite look him in the eye. Instead Tony’s gaze wandered down Steve’s body to his rather obvious erection and Steve had never hated his own biology more. He crossed to the door before a hand caught his wrist.
“Bed it is,” Tony says breathlessly as he tries to disentangle his limbs. “I hope you know what you’re doing.”
“Well the tea’s very good, almost worth the rough introduction.” He spots Steve’s rigid posture and amends, “FRIDAY said you were waiting for me.”
“He’s a victim too. What he did - what he was made to do…" Steve doesn't voice it aloud. "He deserves what everyone does.“
Steve backs off, a strange lump in his throat. “I know. You’re doing your best and - thank you, Nat.”
“Dr. Robert Milton Kovalchyk, Canadian psychiatrist. Born 1956 in Winnipeg to parents of Polish extraction. Medical Degree from McGill University. Currently practicing out of Toronto.”
“Not that you know of. If he made you forget the things you couldn’t live with, you’d never know. You’d just trudge along thinking you were whole until one day you’d realize your friends betrayed you - ” Steve pulled up short.
Steve doesn’t trust himself with Stark right now. He’s too flush with secondhand anger on Rhodes’ behalf. He pushes Tony lightly by the shoulders (shoulders, never the chest) away from the threshold and back into the opposite wall. All Steve has to do now is step back into his room and shut the door.
The reality is harsher. Hanahaki is fatal. The blooms hog too much blood flow, too much oxygen. They eat their victims alive from the inside, turning them to mulch. Their Chosen choke on flowers, suffocating from the beauty inside them determined to be let out. They die of burst lungs, not broken hearts.
Steve looks closer at the media conglomerate itself. It owns several 24/7 news channels nationally and dozens of local outfits across the Midwest and California, all with an anti-Avenger bent that manages to condemn him and Tony both. He can think of a dozen reasons why the Avengers need the American media onside and absolutely zero for why Tony would sleep with a man who hates him.
Steve’s grip tightened unconsciously and Tony felt the bones of his wrist grind together. He adjusted his answer. “I can’t lose you either, Steve. I won’t.” He swallowed. “Guess you’re stuck with me.”
.” Tony laughs, high-pitched and hysterical. “I even let you fuck me to keep you here so what exactly does it take with you, Rogers?”
Steve hears the door shut and slowly makes his way down the rest of the stairs. Natasha is still staring out at the undisturbed meadow, her pale fingers resting lightly on the railing. He’s careful to keep a few feet between them.
They had been on the plain. Tony had kissed him solemnly and smiled. Steve had thought him still innocent when Tony had whispered those three words he always said, ___ _____ ____, but this time they’d made Steve shiver. Then Tony had strolled behind the towering cairn and never came around the other side. Steve had searched the plain, the mud flats, the river, the swamp, the forest. He’d dived under the frozen ice and crawled into the trenches. Tony was nowhere to be found. He was gone. And Steve had screamed and screamed and if no one was around to hear him did he even make a sound?
The doctors don’t let them leave the North Wing but they do let them into the small gym populated with physical therapy equipment and exercise mats. In the corner is a lone basketball hoop which at first seems like a cruel taunt to throw at a one-armed man and instead turns out to be their godsend: shooting hoops is a two person activity in a way that hitting a heavy bag is not.
“Hell no, I am not getting razzed for my suit choices by a man who can’t figure out how to buy T-shirts in the correct size.”
Tony finally dared to look into Steve’s face. It was rare that Steve looked his age. He didn’t wrinkle like the rest of them but right now his eyes were pools of tired blue: already sick of everything they’d seen and Tony was just one more sorry sight.
“Right,” Bucky says and his tone reminds Steve of the war. “So are we trusting him or are we pulling a runner?”
He had been swept a fair distance downstream before he managed to dig his feet into the muddy opposing bank. The tendrils reluctantly released him as he fought to pull himself onshore and spat out mouthfuls of swallowed water. From where he was doubled over coughing, Tony could only see Captain America’s black combat boots as Steve joined him. A heavy hand landed on his back and Tony stiffened, suddenly aware of his nudity.
. Every bit of him convulsed in burning agony but something deep within him wouldn’t thaw. He didn’t want it to.
Kovalchyk makes a move to get off the couch and a switch flips. Tony’s eyes swing away, body language instantly back to languid as if he weren’t just hovering on the verge of confrontation. Steve can’t do that but he does take a single step back. It’s hard not to feel chastised.
“It’s beautiful,” Tony said gazing outward, like this place hadn’t been beautiful since the beginning.
“Please,” Tony croaked, all desperation and no fight. The hand around Steve's wrist had blood caked under the fingernails. “Anything you want.“
The dark line in his peripheral vision saunters forward until Steve can discern a figure in jeans and a dark T-shirt. He looks like the Tony in Steve’s better memories: comfortable and casual. Tired and not bothering to hide it. Stark always looks untouchable these days, as if he were made of nothing more than money and words, and to see him less so makes something in Steve’s stomach lurch in recognition. it's longing and helplessness tangled up with that voice that knows that even before they were never perfect.
A woman’s shriek, the smell of leek soup, the metallic clunk of a deadbolt. Background details in the racket of life and then without warning Tony was gone. Sometimes it was only a slight tremble, sometimes he’d stop breathing, eyes wide and pupils dilated. Once, at the smell of campfire smoke Tony had opened the door of the moving car and wandered off.
Nat smiles her small, uneven smile as Bucky offers his hand like a gentleman and Steve can hear the universe click into place around them. He has always believed in soulmates and now he knows, even before they do. He’s happy for them, individually and together, but he watches the soft curve of Bucky’s smile and understands that this is what it is to lose before you even knew you were playing.
and it’s killing him. Nothing so dramatic as murder but the lack of purpose is hollowing him out one spoonful at a time.
Steve crosses his arms. “It’s also against regulations to talk about classified Avengers missions with non-cleared personnel.”
“It does to me.” Tony’s eyes narrow. “Your sudden devotion to not sleeping with the enemy is inconvenient.”
Steve couldn’t stop. His fists hit flesh to the steady drumbeat of his heart. There was only one way she was never going to hurt anyone again. Not the people of New York, not innocent dinosaurs, not Tony -
He haunts the Compound living quarters on the nights he doesn’t visit the North Wing. He sits on the couch and sketches glimpses of a different time. The hairstyle Natasha hasn’t worn in years, a red dress crumpled to the floor atop red shoes, a teddy bear half-burned. He outlines the USO girl who first loved him, her face turned away, already pulling her nylons back on. The tall back of a pitcher on the mound from his first baseball game. The frazzled lines of a dark-haired man curled naked against a wall, knees to chest obscuring scars, head hanging low to hide his face in shadow.
For a minute there’s nothing but the sound of the rain and Steve’s words are almost lost underneath. “I just wanted you to know: I’m trying. With help.”
Steve experiences a moment of perfect confusion because he didn't plan for this and then it all rushes towards anger.
Eventually Tony drops his head into his hands. “Goddammit.” He pulls on his clothes and leaves without another word.
Steve doesn’t belong here. (In this place, this time, this body.) Some days he wonders if ever he did.
“You don’t like that you kill me, or you like it just fine and you don’t like what it says about you?” Tony asked like he already knew Steve’s answer. “Because if it’s the latter I give you permission. Kill me in your dreams as often as you like. Go on a spree.”
Sarah Rogers says with a mischievous grin, snowflakes still melting in her hair. She sets the brown bag down and the ghost boys race over because they’re young enough to still believe in miracles. She unwraps a large turkey, plucked and pink and -
He never figured out who’d sent for Sharon but suddenly she was in his study. Even dressed in white she had never reminded Steve of an angel. She was too grounded for that, too practical. Steve wondered how long she’d been sitting there in silence. He was skipping through time again.
It’s meant as a joke but for the longest time Steve had thought it was too late for the things he should have said and done. Now he has a second chance and his mouth feels like sandpaper and his tongue is leaden. It’s unfair that all his words and nerve are saved for Stark these days.
She catches his gaze. “That’s the way it’s supposed to work.” A car driven by Penelope Nirin pulls into the drive to pick him up. “Next week the real work starts,” there’s a twinkle in Francesca’s eye, “you haven’t seen the backyard garden yet. It’s terribly overgrown.”
“Of course, Mr. Stark,” she beams back. She scribbles down the order and flips the Closed sign on the front door before running to tell the cook who’s just shown up.
Steve forces himself not to react. He keeps his tone even and matter-of-fact. “Tanaka says the one he has is the best they can do.”
Steve looked down at his hands and found he’d assembled a small cairn of knickknacks without thinking.
“Not at the end but yes, for awhile. They worked on the bomb together and while Stark moved onto other projects - mainly you - my father didn’t. After the war my father left America and that’s where their professional association ended.” Kovalchyk’s expression turns wistful. “I was 22 when he died. My brothers and I were all at medical school. I got a phone call from Derek Collins, the police chief. He told me my father was dead and that it wasn’t an accident.”
“I don’t remember following that rule even when you had the ability to enforce it. Besides, mission’s over Spangles.”
It wouldn’t be enough. Tony had to get them out. There was no point in waiting for morning because morning didn’t exist. They abandoned the cairns and the thin snow for the flat horizon once more, trudging under the half light. If this place was a nightmare it was nearly a perfect one as Tony could imagine: a place of endless boredom but without dreams, where there was no life to keep you company except a lover out of your reach and he was angry at you because you’d told him you’d had a plan and you were beginning to suspect you lied. All Tony could do was keep pointing them towards the horizon and saying
Natasha is still staring out at the barren ground. “Why wouldn’t I? You’re always honest, aren’t you, Steve?”
He sounded defeated but Steve’s stomach fluttered, flattered that Tony would seek him out. He knew not to pry further, he got his one allotted answer.
“The arm,” Steve repeats tonelessly. He remembers cornering Tony so many months ago, demanding he stretch himself further.
Stark pays them no mind, already focused on his next mission. He jerks down the nearest svelte bottle from the well-stocked bar, more likely due to its proximity than any conscious choice. He doesn’t look up until amber liquid is safely sloshing around the bottom of a glass.
Steve doesn’t know how to gag anyone safely. And besides, he needs to be able to hear Stark speak because he still clings to the hope Tony might say
Stark stops moving and it takes Steve a few seconds to notice. He pulls back to stare down. He’s larger than Stark and has him crowded against the burgundy wall of his own office but it’s Steve who’s fighting to even his breathing as adrenaline floods his veins in confused violence or lust. He can’t seem to do anything about the trembling of his arms.
Steve has to prevent himself from sinking his teeth into collarbone in frustration because none of this was supposed to be. They were Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. They were supposed to be able to work this out. To say sorry and forgive and forget. They were never meant to break in the first place. (Steve was supposed to die in the ice. Tony was born to burn from the inside out.)
Her focus shifts back to the man in front of her. Tony’s gripping his left wrist like he could strangle the spasms away. “God dammit.”
and every time he did he saw a bit more hope leech out of Steve. When they stopped to rest, Tony would offer a hand or mouth in silent apology and afterwards he would gaze up at the sky until the colour seemed permanently etched onto his retinas. Then when Steve had determined they’d reached that ineffable hour they’d rise and start again.
The Soldier dodges Steve's first takedown easily and blood pounds in his ears. He hasn’t sparred in months. He’s not conditioned the way the Soldier is, he has to practice and for lack of partners and drive he hasn’t. He regrets it now. Every reflex feels like he’s moving through chest deep water and the Soldier is faster, stronger. Steve can’t seem to drop into that calm space in the back of his mind that lets him focus solely on the flow of the fight. He’s stuck on the surface with the panicked tumbling of his thoughts, barely keeping up with the Soldier’s counter assaults. Tony’s down, vulnerable behind him, and Steve tries to keep himself between the man and the assassin because without the suit Stark is no match for -
“Why wouldn’t he be?” It’s a non-answer, emblematic of who she is these days, like they’re back at the beginning and she can’t trust him.
Stark’s AIs are excellent predictors of behavior when the subject at hand is Tony. The screen explodes in blue again and Steve tries and fails not to look. Most of the multiple windows close before being repopulated, all with articles featuring the same man. It doesn’t take FRIDAY long at all.
“Whoever gave you this,” Steve’s thumb stroked the bondmark and Tony ducked his head. “I can’t, Tony, please don’t - “
This is how it starts: the Soldier pulls the bloodied shield from Steve’s hands and it drops to the floor with a sound that echoes for miles. The corpse at Steve's feet is faceless; as if the artist couldn’t fathom how it felt to die under crashing metal.
Vision nods like Steve’s made a wise decision and hasn’t just stated the obvious. The android serves him a third helping of lasagna because soothing emotional distress with comfort food is another accidental lesson that’s stuck. Steve eats mechanically and lets the angry voices wash over him in waves.
He's surprised by the immediacy of his answer. “Stay. I want to stay. If that means I have to trust Stark… “ He sinks another basket effortlessly. “For now.”
Suddenly there's a hand on his shoulder and Steve whirls, fast and combat-ready. For all Tony’s tech and intelligence and words, Steve was made for physical confrontation. It’s over before it begins and the unworthy part of Steve is thrilled at how easy it is to overpower him. He takes Tony to the floor in a single move; one hand bracing Iron Man’s gauntlet watch to the ground, the other splayed across his ribcage, keeping his chest pinned.
It’s not like Steve wasn’t prepared. He knows Stark’s washed his hands of the endeavor taking place in the North Wing. Tony’s shuffled off responsibility to other parties, absolving him before he even has the chance to make the wrong decision just like with the Accords but Steve knows righteous anger will get him nothing here.
“He never lost me.” Rhodes looks as unflappable as ever. “Believe it or not between my own shit and Tony being Tony this happens about once every five years or so. I met him when I was nineteen, we’ve had a lot of practice.”
“They put him in the courtyard facing my window. I hadn’t even met this kid and there he was, dying for me.” Tony's eyes shone with unshed tears. “Is it worse if I watched or if I didn’t?” He looked at Steve like there could possibly be an answer to that question. “I’m not going to let that happen here. I can’t watch it again. I won’t. I can’t, I can’t,
Tony couldn’t come up with a plausible lie fast enough. “No. I have no idea what the fuck I was thinking when I brought us here. I don’t recognize anything and you'd think I would have remembered the haunted forest with an obsession with stealing my stuff.”
Tony breaks their stalemate. His lips twist and he turns away to conceal whatever emotion he doesn't want Steve to see. “FRIDAY’s back up in ten.”
She does, even if she never answers him anymore. The globe shudders and the data from the weather radar satellites update in real time. The swirling mass of the typhoon is approaching the Accords-blue cluster of islands that are Maldecia and Steve’s fists clench tighter with each iteration as it inches closer. From above it looks harmless, a messy swirl of colour. From ground level it is the closest thing in existence to the wrath of God.
Steve spends the next day in research. It was never in his job description: he went from dancing monkey to front line soldier to Avenger. The behind-the-scenes work was left to Army Intelligence or SHIELD. Still, FRIDAY is as helpful and unhelpful as a silent AI can be and none of her databases are off-limits.
Tony’s eyes dart warily to the huge cotton expanse and back. “You don’t like beds,” he says flatly. “Too decadent as I recall. I bet I can convince you to stay right - ”
Steve said nothing but a moment later one of his boots landed on Tony’s lower back, pushing him back into the mud. Tony was reduced to a man with a simple mechanical task. All it required was spit and motion and pressure just-so. It wouldn’t make up for whatever the hell he’d promised Cap before but a brief moment of respite in this place was hardly a generous offer. It was a selfish one at heart; Tony
Steve waited forty agonizing minutes before he used his override codes to enter the locked suite. Tony was stepping out of the shower, skin pink from hot water and scrubbing, but intact, whole, alive. Steve just crossed the room and hugged him tight, buried his nose in Tony’s still dripping hair and inhaled, hunting for the familiar scent he once knew so well. That mix of metal shavings, ionized air, and
The tension ratchets upward until the damn breaks. Tony’s left hand disappears under a layer of gold and Steve instinctively pins his wrist to the table by the sleeve of his shirt, unwilling to touch the pulsing metal. Steve's Pavlovian response to Tony’s instigation has a secondary component though and part of him wants nothing more than to force Tony over the table and prove to him that Steve is still in control.
Steve had carried that secret for years, cradled it desperately close, bled for it, killed for it, only to have it dissolve at Tony’s words like a sugar cube in the rain. It turns out it was never a secret at all. Bucky always knew how much Steve cared just like Tony’s convinced he knows how much Steve doesn’t. Steve swallows down the words Tony’s not ready to hear.
. He hadn’t fallen off the wagon, he didn’t avoid touch. He didn’t have any new scars where someone would have had to force Tony to submit because he didn’t bow his head for anyone. He still smiled and laughed. He was still Iron Man. He still had sex.
“Can I help you, Stephen?” Steve asked, still engrossed in the latest road rage pantomime being performed before them.
“She runs the Avengers. I don’t just mean the team, I mean a lot of the behind-the-scenes stuff too. I can’t do it all by myself, so… Natasha. Round Five of the Black Widow vs the Idiot.”
He means the words to be a comfort but they hit like a blow. Tony shakes his head, agitated again. “What makes this time different, Rogers? Don’t say house arrest. Nothing’s changed.”
“If I take you back, you’ll die.” The cursed wound in Steve’s breast would kill him as soon as they stepped through.
“Don’t come tomorrow," Bucky says and every muscle in Steve’s body tenses. “Just… I need a few days. Thursday, maybe.”
The man tries to pick himself off the wall and Steve doesn’t let him. His hand smothers the scar across Tony’s heart as he pushes Stark back.
The rescue party comprised Bucky and Logan. Both dead or non-existent on the other side, both willing to step into the unknown.
“It was my mistake.” Steve used to tongue and nip at Tony’s gland, basking in the glow of trust even knowing it would go no further. “I know you don’t want me to. So I won’t.”
Fortunately, Tony has never waited for Steve to catch up before forging ahead. Wrists free, he snakes one hand between them to dip under the waistband of Steve’s sweatpants. He palms Steve through his boxers and Steve lurches forward, driving himself into the pressure. Anything feels better than repetitive drive of his own hand.
Steve doesn’t get the chance to go to the council because two hours after FRIDAY comes back online and gives him the runaround, Natasha walks in and drops a thin file on the breakfast bar in front of him.
The storm is no one’s fault. It couldn’t care less about any of them: Steve or Tony or the people in its path. It remains perfectly blameless and all they have left to turn on is each other.
It's frightening, the magnitude of his feeling. He breathes through it and touches Stark like he’s glass. For once Tony seems grateful for the careful attention but he still winces as he steps out of his dress pants.
There’s nothing wrong with Bucky sharing with Tony. It’s what Tony could tell Bucky that causes anxiety to well in the pit of Steve’s stomach.
Steve stands next to Tony as the patter of rain slows. “It’ll be enough for what comes. We’ll be enough.”
Tony didn’t answer, just got to his feet and exited the bathroom in a nervous trance, leaving Steve to follow in his wake.
The sixteenth of December is just another day. The agents milling around either don’t know its significance, don’t care or are too professional to express either. There are no emergencies, no attacks. It’s a beautiful sunny day and the Avengers machine carries on, marching to its own relentless internal beat, ever forward. Tony built it well.
. We broke the Avengers and it only happened because the bad guy knew exactly how much of coward I was.”
“I was the Devil,” Tony whispered hoarsely. “I had come to destroy them all, wearing the skin of their most hated enemy. The Captain was their saviour. He’d sent the Usurper Stark down to Hell and caged the demon they sent back.”
It’s the heartbeat of grace before the fall. After Tony realized he’d lost before Steve ever told him they were playing; when he realized he’d compromised himself for someone who would never do the same for him. Before he fell to wrath and his other clambering demons. One last look before fate took them all.
“Seriously?” Tony’s laugh was unkind. “You remember me as well as I remember you. I did everything I could to keep you trapped in the Ether. I pulled every trick I had: sex, lies, secrets, suicides. It was breaking you, I could see it, and I thought to myself -
The North Wing gym is being emptied a piece at a time. They’re in the process of moving Bucky to an offsite apartment but Steve still visits, a habit he can’t seem to shake even when Bucky’s not here.
Tony’s mouth is warm and sure, and the pleasure in Steve’s groin builds until he realizes that besides the obvious he doesn’t know how this is going to end. He has little idea to what modern etiquette requires and when he lurches his hips back Tony’s mouth just follows. He can’t figure out an appropriate warning and when he goes to ask nothing comes out except a sharp, bitten-off exaltation. He holds on as long as he can but it’s nearly too late before he succumbs to temptation and touches. He threads a hand through Tony’s hair to tug his head away.
Tony wrapped his legs behind Steve’s back, preventing him from withdrawing. “I’m fine, Steve. Seriously.” He leaned up and kissed him softly, like Steve was the one who needed to be comforted. “Make me feel good?”
“Maybe he was following someone else at the meetings. Ross or one of the lawyers.” That’s the type of thing Clint and Natasha would set up: one working from the inside, one from the outside.
Some acknowledgement that Rhodes leaving hurts but that this isn’t what he needs. Not for the first time Steve thinks he’d trade sex with Tony for the ability to just… talk.
Some of the other Avengers had been starting to shoot Steve concerned looks but the overlap between those with the Sanctum on speed-dial and those with sufficient influence to get Strange to go against his non-intrusive nature was slim. Steve’s hand clenched around his ice water. He wondered what favour Tony had called in.
“I may not be your Team Leader anymore,” Steve nearly growls and Tony nods, damn right, “but Natasha is.”
A fly landed on Steve’s flapjacks, spoiling them. Its wings become saturated with maple syrup as it gorged itself before realizing it would never take off again. Steve watched it drown slowly in sweetness; a fitting end for a glutton. He could feel the blood leaking through his stitches, through his T-shirt.
He doesn’t seek out Stark that night. Instead he takes his frustrations out on the heavy bag in the gym long past the time when the day shift’s gone home. Natasha’s back which means so is Rhodes and Steve tells himself that whatever messed-up impulses he’s had are just cabin fever. Isolation driving him to things he’d never do otherwise.
“Do you remember?” Steve croaked as the last of the inferno bled out of him leaving only ashes and ice behind.
“You’re going to have to. You aren’t leaving this room until then.” Steve crosses his arms. “I have all night.”
Steve smiles, sharp this time. “You’re not going anywhere and I don’t see you holding up too long to the Black Widow. Think of me as practice.”
“I’ll deal with Tony.” Her voice, belying her words, is soft. She shifts her gaze to Steve’s face. It’s a warning. “Don’t go looking for him.”
He sets out to seduce Steve all over again with art galleries, good food, and great sex. With gadgets and donations and gifts. Steve smiles in all the right places, he’s appropriately grateful. When they hold hands Tony can feel Steve’s wedding ring against his fingers. It’s like the good ole days except for the lingering perfume of flowers ever lurking in the background.
Steve closes his eyes and counts down from ten. “Just tell me why.” He’s sure he’s not going to get an answer until -
“No, plan’s off. We’re not risking Tony’s life to get him out of a rough heat. He’s not a danger to himself. It’ll last three more days at most.”
Stark runs a hand over his face. “I lied to the docs two weeks ago. I don't think they believed me. Earth’s mightiest heroes aren’t allowed rough sex apparently. Looking like this twice in under a month is just going to lead to some very awkward questions."
Steve got back. Pain or not, that wound looked like the type that wouldn’t surrender to a few stitches and a prayer. They were running out of time.
“Of course you’re going to make it!” Tony snapped. Steve had no doubt about his mortal body, it was his soul that was wearing thin. Tony’s voice softened. “Just a bit longer, Cap. I’m not killing you and you’re not dying. Reed and T’Challa will have us out soon.”
Tony shook off his trance, lips twitching. “So hey, you have terrible taste in men regardless of moral alignment. At least you’re consistent.”
“My name is Dr. Robert Kovalchyk,” the stranger lifts his teacup in acknowledgement, “and you are Captain Steven Rogers.”
might cause a minor aneurysm. He feels like a frog placed in boiling water, nearly cooked by now, and Sam seems to be the only one alarmed.
Rhodey smiles, eyes shining with unshed tears, and Tony cackles until he chokes, desperately gasping for air.
Steve remembers when every other reference out of Tony’s mouth flew over his head. “It means he likes you.”
“Difficult when no one gives you the slightest bit of cooperation, isn’t it?” Tony says, panting in effort.
Sam just observes him like he expects something different. “What are you still doing here, Cap?” he asks quietly.
Stark stops walking and Steve knows exactly what he’s feeling, heart plummeting, because Steve feels it too.
She launched herself at him and Steve was waiting. He caught her by the throat, fingers squeezing automatically as she dangled from his outstretched arm. The toes of her leather boots made scritching sounds where they grazed the floor as she tried and failed to alleviate the strain. Sin was enhanced, she wouldn’t die. The act would have killed an ordinary human. It had. And it hadn’t. Because Tony was still out there, breathing. Alive and five thousand miles away because he hadn’t answered his Avengers alert, because now of all times Tony had decided to be merciful.
He didn’t do anything more. Tony’s strength simply gave out and he slipped silently into the hellpit. Steve didn’t remember any sounds it was all just… blank tape. The soundtrack excised.
Tony stopped pretending to smile. He hunched like a gargoyle on top of the parapet, beautiful and grotesque. “You’ll die.”
The entreaty has the opposite of the intended effect. Frustration surges back into Stark’s frame, his mouth twisting. “Where was all this can we talk crap six months ago? You came back for him, you’ll beg for him, you'll throw yourself at my mercy. You’ll even say please. All for him. Why?”
It takes a moment for Steve to figure out what she means because her plans have always zigged where his have zagged.
.” The bottles and jars in the fridge clink. “Why, in a building that houses Tony Stark, is there no beer?”
Their visits take place in a secured room now. Neither of them can pretend that they aren’t being recorded. The exposure makes Steve’s skin crawl but Bucky doesn’t even look alive. His skin is sallow and pale, eyes red-rimmed. He drifts in and out of the perfectly compliant silence that is the Soldier’s default programming. He still eats like clockwork but he can’t keep anything down. Steve would suspect poison if he didn’t know better.
“What always happens with us. We were allies and friends and then we fell apart. We fought, I lost, but not before I did my share of damage; including killing the man the Captain actually loved. He caught other-me but apparently torture and hanging was too light a sentence, so when I came through he got a second chance. He took a different approach that time.”
One more time than he can justify to himself. Steve’s reached the end of his rope. He never anticipated how hard it would be to climb up again.
It’s been four days since Steve’s latest mistake. He’s not as immune to them as people want to believe Captain America should be. Bucky just nods slowly like he suspects that whatever truce between the two of them is fragile enough he should let sleeping dogs lie. Steve can’t expect Bucky to understand, not when he doesn’t even understand it himself.
“You always do this Steve. You make promises and then you break them as if having good intentions saves you.”
Then Tony’s on his way out and it’s too late for so many things. He turns for one last parting shot and Steve is mesmerized. The gold undersuit is leaking out of his palms, streaking colour across his neck and face, the metallic hue made more vibrant by the late morning sun. “…upgrade was supposed to fix this,” Tony mutters as he flexes his fist, trying to get the tremors and the reactionary gold under control.
The Mansion door opened without triggering any of the Avengers alarms, the monster knew all the failsafes and passwords. He’d designed them himself. The team had frozen; a half-dozen wary stares following him as he wove his way through them without a word. He had come on a mission. His carefully curated suit was worn in the laissez-faire way only the truly rich could afford. His black, unruly beard was now a carefully groomed mustache, his hair was the perfect mussed that indicated mousse and not swamp water. Sunglasses hid the colour of his eyes but not their spark. The collar open at his throat exposed tan skin instead of the ropeburn of a noose, or the blue-black span of handprints.
“I’ve been leaving you though.” Bucky’s small smile is rueful. “’Sides, the docs are here, I won’t be alone.”
He had walked a lot in the Ether. He had traced out the boundaries, following the seams far off into the horizon as they curved ever so slightly in their perfect geometry. Nine circles, one encompassing the other, all them holding within wonders that flickered between horrific and beautiful in the eye of the beholder. He’d always returned to the same spot he’d started.
He thinks the actual worst part of this whole sodden affair is how the blooms have robbed him of the simple joy of laughter.
Since Steve came back Stark owns his life. He lives under Stark’s roof, eats his food, punches SI’s extra-strength heavy bags into submission every night for hours. He obeys the rules; the ones the lawyers have made explicit and the ones that Steve gleans from the hesitation in Vision’s voice and the reproach in FRIDAY’s silent, lagging fulfillment of his requests. He’s sure on the days his chest aches for no reason that Stark even owns the air he breathes.
“Breathe, Captain. Just breathe,” the stranger says in a soothing baritone, concern written across his features.
It can’t be good for people to see the world like this - from above and at will. It could fool someone into thinking they’re above it.
What right did Steve have not to be? He spent five months being worried and making stupid bets. Tony spent four years being stripped of his humanity. “I’m fine.”
“Still here,” Tony says with barely a hint of a tremor. “Feeling a bit like a Peeping Tom to be honest.”
Tony let him. Steve wrapped a hand around Tony’s throat and wondered just how far that blind trust went. If the lamb would go to the slaughter willingly or like a billy goat and how Steve wanted to punish him for either. He pressed harder.
“You don’t get to tell me what I really want,” Tony said blankly. A spasm that could have been mistaken for pain ran down his spine and a wave of heat pheromones rose off him. “I want to get fucked and I want you. Yes or - ”
Outside, the rain’s stopped. They leave the porch and the dark soil is absorbent and alive under Steve’s feet. The air is heavy and damp and clean. It tastes sweet, cleansed.
The Ether held on to what each of them tried to forget. The bountiful meadows gradually withered as if an illness spread through the soil, leaching life from their roots until only mud or desert remained. The rivers were poisoned by blood and rust. The sun and moon abdicated; replaced by an indifferent grey cloud. Their castle was abandoned and the stones worn down to ruins. Reminders of death piled up around them: broken gravestones and mass graves. The sky rained cold fire as their world rearranged itself into nine concentric rings. The Ether was no longer a kingdom but a prison, and at the very centre Tony built them a new home: a frozen saltwater lake, Steve’s first grave.
and Steve has let him win too many times. He unbuttons Tony’s shirt carefully and underneath finds skin marked in places, both temporarily and permanently. He ignores the scar tissue in Tony’s sternum but finds a series of faded burns on his left wrist. There are callouses across both his palms and a healed blast wound on his right shoulder. There are injection points dotted at intervals along his arms and high across his chest, the skin around them slightly pink.
Tony shook his head. “Not what I was doing, that was all selfish too. You were right, bond shock should have killed me when I came back. But it didn’t." He gave a tiny, hollow smile. "I brought just enough of the Captain back with me to keep me alive.”
The church next door was engulfed in flames and all the occupants were safely outside by the time Steve made his way over. Firetrucks had arrived and streams of water did nothing to dampen the raging inferno. The fire ate and ate and ate. The white paneling of the church became black with soot. The winds funneled the flames into a pillar reaching for the sky. The smoke rose as if the Holy Spirit too was evacuating the place. The roof collapsed piecewise, each crash causing fresh ashes and embers to kick up and rain down like fireworks.
“The Avengers can’t afford for you to be you right now.” There’s no way Natasha misses the way Tony suppresses a flinch. “We need you here, sober, and not in Boston blowing up tombstones.”
Today the target was MODOK throwing a hissy fit in Times Square. He was delivering his monologue with his usual impotent vigor and Steve’s eyes glazed over.
In fact, Hell was a half-baked compromise. Steve split the difference with an atheist and ended up in Dante’s Inferno. God couldn’t find him in the Ether, His Word hadn’t mattered. Tony’s did.
“Jesus Christ on a stick,” the stranger swears viciously from the floor, the curse at odds with his dignified portrait. “You take tea seriously ‘round here.”
Stark’s pulse spikes in a way unassociated with arousal when Steve looms over him and while Steve hasn’t done anything with that yet, the ugly urge to press any advantage he has left lurks under his skin.
“I can’t - I can’t lose you,” Tony confessed. Here he could keep Steve alive and Tony was a selfish man.
“Dammit Tony.” He didn’t know. It’s not like they’re actually sleeping together - they barely get undressed half the time. He doesn’t see Stark naked often enough to keep track of scrapes and bumps. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Steve tries to swallow down his anger but his voice still comes out low and accusatory.“You don’t get to hide behind projections and a piece of paper. Their government’s wrong but since they’re going to get their own citizens killed that’s fine with you.”
“Did the council at least send you somewhere with a beach?” Steve asks with a small smile when he finally catches her walking off the jet and into the hangar.
Every time he visits Francesca he brings flowers back from her garden. He gives them away to gas station clerks or diner waitresses. Some end up in the North Wing on Tanaka’s desk, others are gifted to Kovalchyk when Steve passes him late at night in the halls. The ones that avoid those fates end up in the kitchen in a glass of water. One night Steve finds the flowers neatly rearranged, stems cut, in a vase and he smells the old familiar scent of the sea. Rhodes is alone in the living room despite it being a Thursday all of which means -
Stark immediately gets to his feet. He heads towards the door without a backward glance. “Fri, find me Natasha. Let’s see if the ambassador likes me any better after going several rounds with her.”
Steve doesn’t want to go back to drawing and see what new past awfulness flows out of his pen. He doesn't want to dwell in his memories and he can't let Tony do the same faster and more immersive and worse.
Steve remembers a time when incoming American planes carrying help to Europe were greeted with cheers. Instead Natasha pleads the Avengers’ case to a closed session of the EU who tell her, in considerably nicer words,
Steve reaches for the file but Natasha pulls it back just out of reach. Her next words are deliberate. “Kovalchyk’s not a threat.”
Steve was crying silently, tears running down his cheeks and Tony wondered if they’d be as cold as ice water. "I can't do this anymore, Tony. I don't want to."
“You’re right,” Steve whispers and Tony freezes. “I’m not helping. I’m not fixing anything. I’m just using you.” He feels the last sliver of himself slip away. He is no longer a soldier, or Captain America, or a good man. “I trust you to do what you think you need to. I trust Tanaka with Bucky, I trust Nat and Sam. Rhodes and Vision. You don’t need me.”
(It’ll all be worth it later.) Steve leaves his shield, his uniform, his skin, in a pile at the dead man’s side and doesn’t look back because if he does he’ll be lost. They have to run, they have to run right now. Then Bucky leads him out and the chase begins anew.
The doors slide open, melody and drums crashing out. Steve only hesitates a second before entering. The volume is loud - painfully so - but the man in charge of it doesn’t seem to care. Tony’s bent over a workbench in the remnants of his tuxedo, sleeves rolled up and stained with oil. He has a pair of his close-work glasses on and Steve can see the bright neon yellow of earplugs because Tony always liked to feel his music as much as listen to it. His hands are busy repairing the broken BARF glasses. Steve wonders who asked Tony to fix them.
Iron Man curled naked against the wall is a pitiable enough sight that Steve does as asked. He pauses on the threshold of his room to look back. Stark is shaking, minutely but enough, and it’s not from cold. Steve’s heart aches. Tony wouldn’t want him to see this; so much more intimate than anything they just shared, but any offer of comfort is tainted by their history. It’s still not in Steve to give him privacy, shutting the door feels too much like abandonment.
He breathes in and feels the cloud of lust receding. When he raises his head Tony’s studying him with guarded eyes but Steve’s gaze is drawn magnetically to the remains of scar tissue marring his chest.
That was thirteen hours ago. Night’s fallen and Steve’s been locked out of the active floors. Instead he’s studying the holographic globe in the empty situation room. It’s the map Stark and the agents consult religiously every time the Avengers are called. It’s a soft blue orb with political divisions marked out. A bright band of cyan marks Accord signatory countries as it runs across North America and Europe, dotted through South East Asia and South America. It’s a stark visual reminder of how many people think Steve is wrong.
“Not all of them. The perennials you only need to plant once and they’ll regrow provided the conditions are right. The annuals only live one season, they don’t survive the first frost.”
Steve knows there are parts of himself that Tony fakes for the world but Steve already knows all the soft, vulnerable bits that lie under Iron Man’s armour. Tony pasting on some concealer and a smile isn’t going going to make Steve forget. He doesn’t want another Stark performance: he wants something of Tony that's real, and Stark will give him a house, a shield, his body, and an army of lawyers but he will not trust Steve with that.
“Thank you.” The stranger takes his drink and limps into the living room. He slips into the corner seat of the couch and Steve stands opposite, blocking the exits.
Tony doesn’t argue that point, like he thinks Steve has walked away unscathed from every fight simply because his skin doesn't hold onto pain.
“Tuesdays and Thursdays both,” Natasha says easily like the past year never happened. “I’ll make time.”
“Not really,” Tony’s expression was grim, “but if this place is my hell then the key will be at the centre and that means...” he waved across the dunes.
Tony’s brow wrinkles in confusion before he hits upon the memory. He snorts, as if it wasn’t important at all - a tidbit thrown in the heat of the moment. “I was six, Rogers, I will not be held accountable for my questionable taste in childhood idols.”
But it isn’t and instead of a lover’s caress he gets an elbow to the ribs, and instead of sweet nothings he gets uncharacteristic silence, and instead of passion or love (or friendship or camaraderie), he gets this and it’s not fair or right it’s -
Steve never turned him down. He would bury himself in Steve’s bed and they would sleep. It was the best rest Steve would get all week, knowing that Tony was back and safe. Sometimes Steve woke to him throwing up, his body rejecting whatever substances he had substituted for a good night’s sleep the rest of the week.
“Don’t sell yourself short Cap, hate sex with science’s perfect specimen isn’t much of a burden. You needed a release valve and I got to keep you at the Compound. As a bargain it was working until Belgium. You’ve accused me of whoring before - Congratulations, it’s true.”
Rhodes looks at him with concern and his tone softens. “They’ll be fine, Steve. Pepper knows who Tony is. We’re just giving them a night to themselves to have it all out, yeah?”
He forgets about the blooms until the morning after when they’re tangled up in bed, Steve’s heartbeat steady beneath him. He can feel the petals threatening his throat, his thoracic cavity feels stuffed as he rushes to the bathroom. The large rose comes out easily enough but it’s not alone and Tony pulls the long trailing stem out of his own windpipe like a tapeworm. Its thorns catch on the sides of his trachea, drawing blood that he aspirates onto the mirror.
“I hurt myself last night,” Steve answered succinctly as he poured himself a coffee. He could lie very well with the truth these days.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky says in a small voice, drawing Steve back to the present. This was supposed to be Bucky’s Christmas gift to him. A shared memory from the past.
“Yes.” Steve helped himself to some pancakes too. Sam shot someone a warning look across the table, he couldn’t tell who. The crowded room sobered a bit but no one brought up the topic again. Hushed voices carried the conversation around him like a river around a rock.
“You spent a year grounded in Big Brother’s house and the best you can give me is fine? It had to be balls out nuts from ground level; Jim moved out, Philly revolted against Stark, Natasha got shot, you grew a beard of sorrow…”
Four years without the armour hadn’t dulled Tony’s battle skills nor had they honed his self-preservation instincts. One minute Iron Man was flying Hawkeye to a new vantage point, the next Steve was watching a dinosaur swallow him whole. If Morgan le Fay thought a giant lizard was going to take Tony away from Steve again she had another thing coming. He saw his opening and took it. She crumpled under Steve’s shield, went down under his left hook. Barely lifted her head to meet his crushing straight right.
Steve can hear the sounds of people running down the hallway towards them. He doesn’t have time. “Just let me go. I can help in Antwerp. Then I’ll come back or stay away, whichever you want.”
“No,” Tony said. He expected a rasp but his voice was undamaged. “That’s sort of the point. I know I’m getting us out of here. I know we’re going that way.” He pointed across the desert.
The blooms are supposed to mean things in the language of flowers. Pepper frantically tries to decode them:
The meteorites should have been Tony’s first warning: gravity didn’t work right in this place. He fell like Alice down the rabbit hole; slowly through inky blackness, eyes wide open but with nothing to latch onto. A bright, sharp sting broke his fall with a heavy thud. Tony lay there, desperately trying to realign his reality before he realized that the pain he felt was
Tony had been right, getting the body out had been terribly difficult. Steve had paced like a lioness waiting for the retrieved corpse to wake to the new world in perfect innocence. Except in this version Sleeping Beauty awoke to a Beast instead of a prince.
“Don’t crash us while I nap. Also I hope you know the way back because FRIDAY gives directions exclusively in Spanish now and I don’t know why.”
His orbit changed. His basement lab was taken over by Reed and Bruce for the veil. Doctor Strange still dropped by weekly as if unable to break the habit. Logan of all people became a near permanent fixture in the Mansion. He’d never been a prominent fan of the Avengers or Tony in particular but now he’d lounge around the common areas at all hours. Steve was never sure if he was there for food or poker or Tony.
The youngsters on the team gathered around the fallen armour, suitably awed. Miles looked over at Steve. “How did you know it was empty?”
The reaction is not one he was expecting. There’s a look of all-encompassing surprise on Kovalchyk’s face. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Congratulations, Team Leader,” he says softly, beaming. He wants to hug her but restrains himself. It wouldn’t be as welcome as it once was. “You know the Avengers were always yours, right?”
Steve touches the folder in front of him reverently. “I didn’t want anything like that to happen again.”
“I don’t care. You’re the one who’s going to end it,” she says harshly and then softens. “Steve’s been more… withdrawn since he came back. Probably since before. You’d have noticed if you’d been paying attention.”
“You don’t need to worry about me,” Steve says, aiming for casual. “It’s really not that bad, just boring. I’ll take it over the alternative.”
Non-graphic implied rape, sexual coercion, religious themes. It’s a body horror story from an outsider's PoV. It'll get worse in Part II and warnings will be updated.
Steve stares toward the elevators as if he could see through them. Pepper being back means the bubble Steve shared with Tony has well and truly collapsed. Tony loved her - loves her still. It’s an ugly realization; how little of the real Tony Steve ever had to begin with and how frightened he is to lose the last inch of it anyway. He has no right. It should never have been him. It should always have been Pepper.
“We’ve already done I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” Tony says but he steps aside and lets Steve enter. Every surface of the workshop is covered with contraptions and marvels built by Tony’s own two hands.
It was not as wholly silent as Tony had first believed. He could hear the faint rush of water in the distance and he stumbled like a newborn ibis across the flats, navigating by ear until he found the river. Like the sky, the river was hardly archetypical of its species: it was narrow but the murky navy surface was streaked with stripes of white scum racing violently down the rapid course. Not for drinking then but it’d do for washing.
When Tony speaks again his voice is calm. “I knew better than to trust you the second time. I knew but I did it anyway because I’m an idiot and you…” His voice trails off and he shakes his head. “So this time ‘round I know. The moment Steve Rogers decides he’s done with me he’s going to pick up Barnes in whatever hopefully non-homicidal state he’s in and you’re going to hand him the keys to a Quinjet.” Steve heart swells when Natasha doesn’t dispute it. Stark nods like he expected nothing else. “You’ll manage to land on your feet I’m sure, and I’ll be here: sober and ready to suit up. That good enough for you?”
Steve feels the familiar urge to seek him out and set him straight but Natasha beats him to it. She has Tony cornered on the balcony overlooking the meadows. There’s no one else around to rescue him save Steve who’s tucked well out of sight.
Instead Steve sits on the edge of the bed, hunched. Tony takes a long time. Long enough that Steve would be worried if enhanced hearing couldn’t pick up a body moving under the shower head. Even once the water is shut off, it’s another decent stretch of time before the door opens and humidity floods the room.
Steve kissed him and Tony had been wrong: Steve’s tears were warm. A hand cradled the back of his neck.
“I did. The others didn’t. Most died knowing exactly who to blame.” Tony’s gaze was glassy, fixed at a middle distance. “The only thing I ever did that hurt him was talk about Barnes. So I exaggerated, I lied. I made us best friends and lovers over your dead body. I knew just enough about Bucky to make it plausible.“ Tony’s breath was a slow rattle. “My punishment was watching. He found other-Tony’s apprentice and gave him a martyr’s death. I’m not religious, I never realized how long it took.”
Hell wasn’t other people, Hell was betraying every value you held and then being left alone deal with what you’d become. Hell was loneliness. Hell was empty.
“No, it wasn’t.” A Russian accent seeps into her voice, distorting the words from what he’s expecting. “Do you think the truth would have been better?”
Which means Bucky still doesn’t know he's sleeping with Stark. Tony hasn’t told him. The secret safe and unsafe at once.
In the split second Steve hesitates at the door, Bucky takes a swing at Tony. The prosthetic arm lashes out and it’s a good thing it isn’t HYDRA’s model because Stark’s turned to face Steve and barely manages to avoid the incoming fist.
After the doctor leaves Steve flips through the black and white sketches of faceless men and women and thinks
It wasn’t night and Tony didn’t feel the least bit tired but he did as Steve asked. It turned out to be a fortuitous decision because less than an hour later the storm hit. There was no warning: the sky was the same mid-range grey it always was and then the storm announced itself with a thunderclap. The winds raced across the plain in great gusts, howling as they ripped past Tony’s eardrums. The cold rain was whipped up in a frenzy and the great cairn only provided partial shelter as the wind chased them around the base of the tower. Forked lightning descended from the clouds like brilliant, jagged tears in the universe and flared brightly for longer than physics should have allowed. Despite the circumstance Tony doubted there was a man alive who could have denied the marvellous sight it made.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Martyring yourself on the altar of my questionable choices isn't a good look. Not all of us are repressed and pining, one of us is me. I know what I like. Getting pushed up against walls by built blonds who need a little stress relief? Absolutely A-okay.” He smiles wickedly. “If you want proof I’m sure I could dig up some of the footage from the Founder’s Gala…”
.” Tony grimaces. “Back then I was pretty sure affection was a conserved quantity. I thought if you never existed then maybe he'd have liked me better. I hated you because you were dead and it still wasn't enough.”
The landscape began to change: dirt giving way to piles of rubble strip-mined from a quarry. The rocks were piled up in lonely ten-foot towers that were dotted across the landscape like oil wells in rural Texas. Scattered around their bases were offerings of broken liquor bottles and old, smashed coins.
Steve met Tony’s wild eyes, his voice was barely a whisper. “I want you to be okay. However that happens.”
Under his palm Steve can feel Tony panic, breath shallow and stuttering as Steve looms over him. Instead of guilty it makes him feel powerful. His forearm is resting across Tony’s artificial sternum with heavy pressure and for a few pounds per square inch more he could snap it as easily as if it were bone.
Steve thinks that maybe the serum fixed something in him that shouldn’t have been fixed. He has nightmares about the cold, but never about the war itself. The echoing artillery shells, the gunfire, the stench of bodies are just the backdrop to his memories. They don’t live in his head the way Bucky falling does - and
Tony doesn’t like to talk about the missing either. “Not a peep from Bruce since he ran off with my jet and my science buddy. Nothing from Thor either but I thought maybe he’d try you first?” Steve shakes his head and Tony sighs, “I ran into Lang dressed as a waiter in New York. And Clint was stalking me for awhile.”
“And you’re not an Avenger anymore,” Tony throws out spitefully as he starts walking towards the elevator and out of Steve’s reach. “It’s not your problem.”
It’s been a nine months since Sam departed to serve out his time in DC. Ten since he’d stepped off the plane ahead of Bucky but behind Steve to be arrested on the tarmac, seven since he was formally discharged from the army. It’s been three weeks since their last video call when Sam had expressed his horror at Steve’s new beard.
“Off,” Steve grunted eventually and when Tony didn’t move fast enough he was wrenched out of the way as Steve came silently, stroking himself. He made no sound as spurt after spurt of his seed soaked into the saturated ground.
“Maybe,” Tony granted. “I’ll call Leonard when we get back to New York. I’ll try to limit the word vomit ’til then.”
Eventually the mud gave way to firmer dirt and upon it rested the ruins of some ancient castle dwelling. The formation clearly marked courtyards and rooms but the ravages of time had brought the stone walls so low they no longer provided any protection. Nothing remained save the rock; textiles and wood long since rotted away. The ruins were older than anything that could have been dug up in Greece or Rome. Tony stood in what remained of some princely bed chamber, now flattened dirt and not much else.
He hears the roar of the car’s engine long before he sees it. He already knows what it means. No one can outrun the future, not even the healthiest human specimen on Earth. He could try to flee but God help him, Steve is the type of man who can’t help but look back: to Bucky and draughty houses and the small scales of human endeavour that have all but disappeared. Critics would say he has been rewarded as such a man deserves: skewered in a futurist’s private collection.
Steve… had no idea. Away. It’s becoming harder and harder to envision life outside the Compound, object permanence dissolving at its borders.
Steve's hand ran through the damp strands of Tony’s hair before stilling, the heavy weight of it slowly burdening Tony’s neck muscles, pressing him further and further down Steve’s cock with each pass and making it harder and harder for him to pull up. Tony didn’t think to fight it. He just swallowed more, breathed less, and ignored the water welling up along his lower lashline. When he inevitably choked Steve let him pull off only to patiently watch him sputter and cough.
“You promised me I wouldn’t remember,” Steve’s voice cracked. That had been the final of Tony’s betrayals.
“I didn’t have a single drink over there. Three years, two hundred and forty-six days.” Tony’s eyes were unfocused, drifting closed. “Beer was literally safer to drink than water but none for me…”
“Maybe he’s telling the truth.” Steve can’t quite look Bucky in the eye for the envy he’d spot there. “And even if he isn’t - none of it was your fault.”
Tony’s bleeding from the mouth - he must have injured it on the way down. The blood is a stripe on his bottom lip and it streaks across perfect white teeth, crimson bright. Stark’s favourite colour. It’s the first blood either of them have drawn since Siberia.
They lapse back into silence but Steve fidgets, questions he has no right to ask clambering for exposure.
“Stephen tried. I said no and everyone was too busy trying to keep me alive across an interdimentional rift to argue. Can’t really fault their priorities.” Tony let out a deep exhale. “It was easier to keep it all inside when no one knew.”
Tony couldn’t outrun Steve across the lake. He hadn’t made it very far last time. He wondered if the next time he woke he’d be here on the ice, or if Steve would carry his body all the way back to the beginning before he regained consciousness. It didn't really matter. The two of them would begin in hope and end in betrayal; be it in the forest, or in the mud, or on the ice, as Steve tried to cajole his gaoler into remembering enough to reveal the exit before realizing why he should never let his quarry go.
“Getting sucker punched isn’t fun is it,” Tony pants, scrambling to find purchase where there is none. “That’s what it felt like,” there’s a flash of teeth, “in Siberia.”
Steve nods. He’s not entitled to this. “Might be good for her anyway,” he offers with a half-smile, “gives the old girl character. Scars.”
“It was,” Tony said mildly. “The small punishments I could live with; half a day in the gag, three without food… My first escape resulted in one person from every house I passed to be drowned. He found me through the bond ninety-six hours later. They died for nothing.
It takes the sting out of their fights, burns off the excess energy until the memory of the aftermath replaces the anger at the beginning. The careful balance is difficult to maintain, made more so since sex with Stark lends itself to extremes: absolute control or abject surrender. Steve’s the one who reaches out but Tony’s the one who follows through. Even when he’s on his knees it’s still his show. He drags responses out of Steve’s body like he’s playing an instrument.
Tony sounds sincere enough but there’s an underlying thread that Steve only hears when Tony’s yelling about Bruce. Like he’s desperate for him to come back but showing it might kill him.
Tony hesitates for a second before he grabs it and drops into the wicker armchair. “If it’s quid pro quo do I get to accuse her of being a Hydra agent and then ambush her because I think she’s going to kill Rhodey?”
. The rare pulmonary illness characterized by parasitic plant-like tumours growing in the lungs. The quintessential symptom is respiratory distress caused by irritation to the bronchi. The body undergoes coughing fits in an attempt to expel the irritants.
“I wasn’t supposed to tell you. I wasn’t supposed to tell anyone. He asked me for one thing and I couldn’t even do that.”
“What do you think?” Steve asks and watches as Bucky does a double take, like he’s not quite used to thinking of them on equal footing.
He takes a deep breath and puts all his worries and fears into a small box, shoves it down into the pit of his stomach. “Merry Christmas,” he says with as much cheer as he can manage, extending the box wrapped poorly in today’s newspaper.
Tony’s hands skittered around the edge of the well as another wave of dizziness took him. His skin felt too hot and his tongue felt like cotton. He collapsed and slammed his shoulder into the stone. He couldn’t have told you which way was up.
Natasha nods towards the man in the cell. “It won’t be pretty." It’s said too sagely for it to be entirely hypothetical to her. "He’ll need you after.”
It came to a head in Amsterdam with a sea serpent. Tony had ignored the battle plan from the off and every tactical adjustment since. When he refused the command to move those civilians out of the way and instead flew off in the opposite direction, Steve hit his limit. He didn’t know what Tony was doing and he no longer cared. The Avengers couldn’t afford a wildcard in the fight. He had Vision physically remove Iron Man from the battlefield.
. It took him even longer than that not to feel cheated. As if upon getting Bucky back he was somehow owed a second miracle. “I think he likes it here.”
“I know.” Tony stared at the stained glass. “He knew it too. He didn’t hurt me, not really. His Stark had to deal with all the physical tortures, the Captain was bored of them by the time I came through. The bond was my punishment. He made it as tight and strong as he could. He could feel every bit of my distress like it was his own and he hated me so much it was worth it. He’d just look at me and it was like I was drowning inside my own head, in his contempt for me, his outrage. Every time he marked me he had to restrain himself from tearing out my throat.” Tony’s breath curled in the air. “And the bond made me want to please him anyway. How fucked up is that?”
Steve makes himself as small as he can under the covers. This is their tightrope and Steve is starting to wonder if there’s anything on the other side or if it just stretches out ad infinitum.
He moves with too much purpose towards the edge of the roof and in a flash Steve is on his feet and at his side, one hand wrapped deep in the back of Tony’s jacket, digging into the T-shirt below. Steve knows he’s stronger, faster, heavier than Tony. He knows he won’t let go.
Tony taps his glass of lemonade on the table and hesitates. “They weren’t those kinds of meetings, Cap.”
The use of his first name hardly registers because Steve finally manages to grab hold of the freed bedsheets, shove Tony approximately lengthwise and throw them back over him. Then he's pulling on his own shirt and crossing the room to the door. He pauses at the threshold and looks back at Tony sitting bolt upright under the covers with a look of such confusion it’d be comical if Steve didn’t suspect dark undercurrents ran underneath.
Avengers missions were routine but now they took on the flavour of monotony. Recon, raid, repeat. AIM, Roxxon, Hydra: they all bled red, and when Steve stripped his gloves off afterward the smears left behind never bothered him like they used to. He’d press a bloody thumb to the calendar on his desk, still turned to April despite it being late July. Time had run away from him but a row of red thumbprints marked the cycles.
Natasha rolls her eyes and Steve winces. “Stop being dramatic. Steve lied to protect you. We both did. He’s always pulled his punches with you. Barnes is the one missing an arm - ”
The door opens and closes. Steve can hear the metallic click as Friday locks it behind him. Then he’s alone.
Steve’s tongue feels like sandpaper. He’d missed Tony calling him by his first name. Now he never wants to hear it again.
Here time flowed like water. It was a ticking metronome in the back of Steve’s mind and the constant drip lent itself to a different kind of madness. He wouldn’t suffer it. He kept irregular days: thirty-two hours, then twenty-nine, then thirty-four. The sun rose and fell and Steve didn’t notice. Keeping the days had been Tony’s job.
“I want a lot but I deserve a lot less. You’re nothing like him and I can’t figure out why. I’ve given you every excuse you need. I stood against you, I betrayed you, I told you
with you while innocent lives are in danger. I can make it an official Avengers sanction or you can take a vacation. Choose.”
Maybe the Winter Soldier didn’t do it and Bucky’s just remembering old names in passing. Maybe HYDRA used a different hitman. Maybe Grzegorz just forgot how to swim and Steve’s making a big deal out of nothing.
Steve lept over the railing to face Sin and she turned, waiting for her cue. He was meant to call out that it was all over, that the Avengers had already stopped her plot and it was time to step down and come quietly. But this time Steve didn’t want her to come quietly. He wanted a reason. He let the silence stretch.
It was evening before he gave himself permission. The bedroom was empty but the bathroom door was open. Inside, the glass walls were decorated with cloudy smears of blood - enough that Steve could taste the iron in the air alongside acrid stench of vomit. Tony was fully clothed under the shower, curled up in the far corner, awake and unaware.
“How’re you holdin’ up?” Bucky asks once the visit’s winding down. He asks that a lot these days. Steve supposes he gets it from his therapists.
Bucky starts walking towards the exit where Dr. Tanaka and a technician are coming to retrieve him. “Who knows, maybe this Gregory Kovalchyk guy just really likes tea.”
Steve realized, was the argument they kept having over and over again in running street battles and darkened rooms.
“You didn’t know that when you sat me down.” Kovalchyk picks up his cane and his voice is kind. “It means you’re not too old to learn from your mistakes, Captain.”
She says nothing and plays with the hospital band around her wrist for a long time. “If I knew that…”
Natasha tentatively reaches out. It’s a rare gesture these days, pale hand curving over his shoulder. Tony shrugs off her hand like it offends him and it burns Steve to see something genuine rejected with so much contempt.
They’d done it all before. It was all variations on the same theme: life or death, future or past, red or blue. Steve could hardly blame them for picking up the oft-worn script. He’d spent lifetimes going through familiar motions even knowing it led nowhere and changed nothing. Walking in circles. Steve won’t damn them for the same. Maybe selective memory was the secret to sanity in such a system. Maybe it was the only way people could be happy.
The last straw turns out to be a blank postcard. It shows a sunset over a shear rock face in Yosemite National Park. It’s addressed to Natasha in a tight scrawl Steve recognizes as Clint’s. He slowly turns the card over and over in his hands. Outside the window Vision, Falcon, Iron Man and War Machine are practicing aerial formations and attacks. Someone’s laughing.
“No.” The answer is immediate. It had no right to be Stark and it occurs to Steve then that it had no right to be him for Tony either. “What about Pepper?”
But it’s the rest of Stark’s torso that causes Steve to stop breathing. There are other bruises; lighter ones, already fading to yellow and green. Older and healing and not at all a concern except Steve knows exactly how Tony got them because Steve put them there.
There’s a mottled smear with yellowing edges across the top of Stark’s right pectoral where Steve had braced his arm as he pressed Tony into a wall. There’s a particularly deep violet circle in the soft tissue just north of Tony’s hipbone where Steve’s thumb dug in. The marks around the other hip are lighter and incomplete but if Steve traced them lower he’s sure they’d clearly outline the shape of fingers. He wonders what else he’d find if he stripped Tony bare.
thought we were doing. You were always so angry at me and I was always so angry at you… We couldn’t fight, and we couldn’t talk without it leading to a fight.” Tony still isn’t looking at him. “I just took what I could get from you because it was the only thing I thought you’d give me. It was selfish but I thought we’d burn off all the anger and at the end…" They'd get back what they lost. "But there’s nothing left, is there.”
.” Steve can almost see the thin threads in Natasha's hands as she tries to hold them all together. “You two can hurt each other too easily,” her voice is tired and brittle, “but you’re the one who bruises.”
The chrome doors slide open and Tony comes tumbling out into the common area. Steve didn’t even know he was in the building. He’s dressed in his workshop clothes and gets halfway to the kitchen before he squints towards where Steve is looming over the stranger. To Steve’s eternal surprise the next thing out of Tony’s mouth is not directed at him.
Natasha ends up in emergency surgery before they fly her back Stateside. Helen Cho is on her way from Seoul, Rhodes is presenting to the UN, Vision is onsite in Turkey, and Stark is doing damage control on all PR fronts. There’s no one left to stay by her side except Steve and mercifully after a few sharp words no one objects. He doesn't leave her side for close to 68 hours and the beard he’s starting to grow makes him look like a stranger.
“James Buchanan Barnes. The Winter Soldier.” Steve advances and the stranger retreats into his chair.
Tony must see the wisdom of that suggestion because doesn’t fight the command. He disappears into the bathroom, closing the door after a brief moment of confusion when Steve doesn’t follow.
“I know.” Tony taps his water glass. “So I drove around to the six nearest restaurants because you missed breakfast and you can’t afford the calorie deficit.” The food comes and he nudges all three plates towards Steve. “Eat.”
Rogers? He has absolutely zero problems saying no to me regardless of the consequences, up to and including breaking international law and going on the lam. Barring that, he’s a super soldier with at least 40 pounds of muscle on me and last time even the suit didn’t stop him.”
He can’t lose either of them but he’s going to, isn’t he? He isn’t good enough to keep them both. He always ends up choosing and it’s not fair because they both know it’s not really a choice at all. But Bucky will still be incredulously grateful and Tony will hate him anew, and Steve tells himself he can live with it as long as no one dies.
Bucky snorts and it’s almost the same. Steve loses the next game by a respectable eight points. If he ever actually wins, Bucky’s competitive nature might compel him to wear the new arm purely for mechanical advantage.
“Yeah,” Stark says thickly, “I should be there and I’m not,” he looks at Steve, "and neither are you."
Tony dreamt of fire before he remembered he could not dream. He watched the horizon as a snake of orange cut across the sloping landscape, the thin line of colour blazing against its feeble surroundings. Tony made his way towards it only to see Steve already silhouetted against the aurora, standing on the bank of yet another polluted river. Patches of oil and kerosene burned in pools suspended on top as the water flowed lazily downstream. The orange flames were almost alive, skating across the surface like ice dancers.
, they seemed to say. On screen, his lips moved in a mute coup de grace and the interviewer reared back, her face convulsing in silent delight. Tony leaned back, a satisfied smile on his face.
Tony looked out across the mud plain and saw only more barren wasteland. It was an unimaginative landscape: no mountains, no hills. Sans life of any kind. There was no grass to trample underfoot, no maggots in his wounds, no vultures circling for an easy meal. The sole marker of distinction was some remnant of an iron gate half-buried in the ground. Its rusted tips protruded like knives; a tetanus invitation should one have the inclination for lockjaw. Tony traced his fingers over the ironwork and watched it crumble to dust. Even the metal was dead.
Bucky insisted on accompanying him and Steve didn’t object. Bucky took up Tony’s role as Steve’s permanent shadow and night after night Steve threaded them through the grid-like street of Manhattan, trying to find the gentle curve of his memories. The moon hung like a pearl above the harbour as Steve traced out the borders of his new prison, each nested one within the other.
Some days Steve resists and they part angry and alone. Some days he lays in wait in the garage for Tony’s return with an old, well-trodden argument at the ready.
"No, it was worse than that. Howard was my idol. He got to build amazing things and everyone loved him - or so I thought. And he loved you. Not romantically, you were just… the only good thing he ever had a hand in making. Or maybe he just missed the war when having a talent for making money and blowing shit up wasn’t
“No, just - ” Bucky waits for Steve’s shot to miss and ricochet the wrong direction off the backboard. “…long, I guess.”
His stomach grumbles loudly. “I - uh,” he starts, embarrassed, as Tony’s eyes reopen, “I was wondering if you wanted to stop for dinner on the way back.”
Tony’s teeth clacked shut and Steve knew he wasn't going to like what was coming. “He didn’t. Barnes infiltrated one of the castle celebrations. He impressed some people it was good to impress and I was his very public reward. No one turned down the Captain’s favour.” Steve’s fists clenched below the table. “I don’t remember much of it, I was pretty out of my mind in heat. He didn’t get caught but right now he won’t be anywhere near me regardless of how many times I tell him
He should have been grateful Tony wasn’t afraid of him but instead he spent the passing days in existential fear of faraway church bells and docile german shepherds.
Stark walks deliberately into the kitchen and holds his glass over the sink. His expression is still defiant. “I’m not going to Medical.”
“I don’t - “ he falters, trying to find the words, “I don’t not trust him,” the distinction will not pass the Widow by, “and I
There was no response Steve could give that Tony couldn’t twist however he wanted. It wasn’t a fair thing to ask. Once upon a time, a bond with Tony was everything he wished for. But now -
She actually waits for an answer and Steve nods, the keycard heavy in his palm. This is Natasha’s true gift to him: the reminder that his word still holds value, that the promises he makes aren’t worthless.
They didn’t work well enough. Tony was gentler sure, but he still pushed Peter away, fobbing him off on Banner or Rhodey.
Tony’s lying on his back, focused entirely on the hole in the ceiling where FRIDAY broke through. “Why wouldn’t I be?" It falls far short of flippant.
Steve learns more about Stark in the following months than he ever wanted to know. He fixates on the details because the larger act is too big to contemplate. Tony is an assault on the senses that can only be parsed afterward: a jumble of sights, smells, and tastes that Steve's memory won't let him forget. Salt water cologne mingling with harsh petroleum undertones, scar tissue raised in pattern like braille. Stark’s circumcised, he’s mouthy, he
FRIDAY’s petty. The coffee machine doesn’t even turn on so Steve has to settle for cold, leftover sludge and a night on the couch. He’s still awake at nine when Tony comes into the kitchen. The coffee machine miraculously works for him and when he leaves for wherever he goes Steve finds half a pot left.
“Best guess differential of how far I can move Probabilities 1 and 2.” Stark shrugs. “Team composition matters a lot. You’ll be happy to know that there are several countries who’ll trust the Avengers only provided you’re at the helm. Granted there’s a longer list of countries you’re prohibited from entering on principle. It’s nearly as impressive as mine.”
He raises his head just in time to see Tony’s posture snap upright. Good. Steve can’t regret spoiling the moment; wrestling them both back down into the muck. Neither of them gets to pretend they’re who they used to be.
The worst thing Steve ever learns about Tony is revealed the day after the Avengers return from a recovery mission in Brazil. The team has finally been released from their debrief and Steve watches Iron Man walk out of the conference room in the direction opposite to that of the MedBay. He retreats to the Avengers living quarters as the suit dissolve piecewise - some bits retracting elegantly while others drop to the floor with heavy clunks.
Steve can tell the moment Tony’s found it by the expression on his face. It morphs from anger to self-disgust to hollowness. He stares, unable to look away from one of the worst moments of his life, immortalized now on a whim. It’s the best and only drawing Steve’s completed in 365 days and for all the pain it caused him, he never thought of what it could do to its subject.
“I know. But you know the definition of insanity…” Tony’s head knocked back against the wall. “We couldn’t keep going around in circles, Steve. Something had to change. So I left. Reed was close to a solution. He just needed a first-hand account.”
“FRIDAY, update,” Tony orders. He’s not climbing into the armor but he’s pulling on as many clothes as possible to compensate. The Iron Man suit shadows him.
He packs light. It’s a one-man stealth mission, the Avenger equivalent of a smash-and-grab. He wants the information, nothing more, and he won’t compromise civilian lives to do it but he has to try. He still can’t bear to look at the wrapped shield when he grabs it from under his bed and slings it into a bag. He has to cross the Avengers active area to the Quintet hangar and the one advantageous side-effect of his long stretch of house arrest is that his presence no longer attracts attention. He walks through the hustle and bustle of agents and none of them give him or his duffle bag a second glance. He turns down a deserted hallway lit by a glowing exit sign. Eighty feet to total commitment.
He realizes he has Stark’s hands pinned to the wall, palms aimed back and away so non-existent repulsors can’t fire. Steve drops his wrists like they burn. He wants to mumble sorry but the word sticks in his throat. Apologies are never just apologies between them.
“What about the rest of it?” Tony’s expression isn’t unkind, just curious. “They’re paid to notice bruises and I’ve picked up a couple of interesting ones. You must have noticed.” A shiver runs down Steve’s spine and it doesn’t escape Tony. “Yeah. You should see the ones around my forearms.”
“He’s safe,” she repeats blandly. She wouldn’t lie, not about this. “Laying low isn’t new to him. The American government doesn’t have the time or inclination for a full-scale manhunt. He’s fine.”
Tony looks at himself in the blood-speckled mirror. The dark crimson rose is stained with splatters of red.
Steve would check them into a seedy motel and they’d sleep in the same room in separate beds, the gulf between them unbroachable. Then in the morning they’d clamber into the car and Steve would drive them vaguely east, Tony asleep in the passenger seat like he hadn’t rested at all the night before.
Steve looks back, fight momentarily forgotten. He spots Tony slumped in the opposite corner of the mat, arms crossed protectively over his chest where Steve had shoved him. His brown eyes are wide and wild.
“What do you remember?” Steve had asked warily. This cycle had gone fast. Tony was unpredictable like that.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked dangerously. The bright meteorites reflected off the dark of his pupils, lighting them from within.
There’s a rebuke in Natasha’s stare. “As long as you’re complaining about rules being broken: Tony’s letting you drop curfew, Tanaka lets you sit in on classified procedures, and I gave you access to the North Wing.”
“I had to know for sure.” Steve held out his hand to the shimmering portal. He took three steps through the veil and instead of the lurching nausea of being spit back out into the lab there was a cool breeze and the tingle of electricity against his skin.
The anger that lies dormant in Steve’s belly surges as if Tony lying about his health was somehow a virgin offense. “You’re injured.”
Steve grunted. SHIELD would have told her everything they knew. Sharon had once rescued him from a different pocket dimension. She knew every ugly part of Steve but she’d lacked that talent for dragging out worse, whole cloth, as they went. That singular distinction went to someone else.
“You don’t fuck me when I’m drunk,” Tony replies brutally as he tries to brush past Steve into the room.
Stark doesn’t get mean when he drinks, far from it. He gets flirty and generous, giving away gifts and pieces of himself. The liquor smooths over his sharp edges, directs them all inward. Steve can see how tempting it is to enable this; to let Tony keep coming back to this place where he’s happy and his tongue mostly dulled.
There is no mystery to Robert Kovalchyk: there are thousands of other doctors with greater distinction. That’s what makes no sense because Tony is remarkable. He's a charismatic genius born to wealth and fame; he’s never known ordinary. (Not like Steve did, and that chip on his now extraordinary shoulder grates.) Tony likes remarkable people and Robert Kovalchyk - model citizen that he is - does not fit.
“Oh come on, this isn’t the worst place we’ve been stuck. It’s not even the worst place I’ve woken up naked without my memory and you pissed at me.”
Steve didn’t move so Tony started across the marsh, bare feet sinking ankle-deep into quicksand with every step. He only made it ten feet before Steve tackled him. The soft surface of the swamp broke Tony’s fall as he fell face-first into the shallows. He inhaled reflexively and his lungs flooded. The mud shoved into his mouth was deja vu before a strong arm looped around his waist to haul him up. He choked on air, dizzy.
She switches the television back on to the same awful news program. Steve knows when he’s been dismissed. He leaves her in the empty foyer to the echoing list of her real and imagined sins.
Tony takes the cigarette lighter from his pocket and flicks the flame. It takes the bouquet awhile to catch, the flowers are too stubborn at first - of course Steve bought the fresh ones - but the newsprint they’re wrapped in burns easily and soon the cloying floral scent is covered by the smell of smoke. Tony dumps the torch onto his mother’s gravestone and retreats to watch his marriage dissolve on a stone altar. A burnt offering: ash and flame and cremation. He fancies he can hear the flowers screaming.
Steve stared up at the grey ceiling and remembered a hell of their own making. He loaded the single word with contempt as he pushed it through his teeth, aimed like a weapon:
Stark was just waiting for permission. He immediately licks a path up Steve’s shaft from root to head before swallowing him down. It’s almost too much but still not quite enough to silence Steve’s apprehension. It shouldn’t be Tony but it’s clearly going to be and
It takes Steve a moment to realize the loud, harsh breathing in the empty hallway is coming from him. The skin where Stark’s punch landed throbs in sympathy with his racing heartbeat. The buzz of adrenaline in his system is a massive overreaction: there’s no true threat here.
That explains why the envelopes in Steve’s hands are crinkled but unsealed, the insides having been gutted and replaced multiple times. The fronts have been left blank. “There’s two here.”
“I really don’t know. I’ve yet to meet a man who could claim to know what goes on in Tony Stark’s mind.” Stephen looked at him keenly. “Are you alright?”
Rhodes and Sam share a look. Then Sam claps Steve on the back. “Grab your coat, you’ve been requisitioned for an important Avengers meeting. Don’t wait for the Colonel to make it an order.”
Tony had been innocent that time. Or maybe he had been just as guilty as all the other men before him. Steve wasn’t going to let Tony get away with it. Tony had cheated his way out of giving up the key just like he had cheated his way out of the fallout from their Civil War, out of his stunt in San Fransisco, out of the Incursions. Sometimes Steve believed he was merely a projection of Tony’s, like the sun or the moon, and this was Tony’s Hell alone because
He goes back to one of art’s first principles: drawing what you see and not what you know. The figures he sketches are incomplete but honest: people as they are and not as he wishes them to be. Tony’s face is drawn and lined, Nat’s is lost and contemplative, Bucky’s subdued but content. Steve’s not in practice enough that he can change their expressions without losing the essence of who they are.
Steve had no idea how he got back to the Tower. He went through the motions with perfect precision but the actual journey was static. He was calm. It was probably denial.
The blood was Tony’s. The pain was Tony’s. Something in Steve’s hindbrain came alive, buzzing frantically in the background. He couldn’t sort through his thoughts. “He shouldn’t smell like the sea.”
Steve feels a chill sink into his bones. “Maybe. Probably,” he amends. “I just walked in and you and Stark…” He stares at the empty mats. “I couldn’t let it happen again so I couldn’t let myself get distracted.”
Steve drops back. All the righteous roiling anger in him breaks like a wave and retreats, leaving behind something heavy and hollow that catches in his throat. He’s breathing too fast like he’s run a marathon without the serum and his vision refocuses.
“You were gone.” Bucky’s stare was blank. “You were dead over there and the world fell apart. It was all their Stark’s fault. He murdered me and probably Logan and dozens of others. Then he was arrested, tried, and executed in the name of the Lord. There was even a song about it, they sang it in pubs.” His expression darkened. “There was another song about how he made a deal with the Devil to come back.”
She’s standing stock still in the middle of the room. “I was visiting the North Wing well before you. Why did you think I had night access to give you in the first place?”
Tony’s eyes are still closed, no more in a rush to face this new reality than Steve is. When he finally speaks his voice is desperate and annoyed in equal measure, like he’s betraying himself by having to ask. “Why?”
Clint was confused. “I don’t have super-senses but you’re the one who smells like they took a dunk in a vat of Ocean Breeze. Tony only smells like the sea after he spends the night with you or are we all still pretending we don’t know about that?”
. Tony didn’t remember that but the cold drip of poisonous guilt in his gut meant his body certainly did. Steve remembered though and he was pissed. He had his arms crossed, feet stubbornly planted on the opposite bank as if daring Tony to defend himself.
Strange had been more accessible. “Stark’s armour would have disintegrated when he walked through. By our clock he’s been missing for five months,” a pause, “for him it’s been closer to three and a half years.”
Wanda doesn’t come back. Her application for a US visa is rejected on the grounds of previous ties to a known terrorist group. She’s rerouted to the Netherlands who take more kindly to her situation. They remain heavy proponents of the Accords though and Steve is already prepared for the day that her gratitude towards her new home eclipses her hatred of Stark. Clint doesn’t come back either. He says he’s be better off in the wind and Steve just nods. No one not an Avenger ever learns Scott Lang’s name. He slips back into the US and Steve scans the daily reports for any news of his arrest.
“He’s killed fewer people than you,” Tony argues. “Fewer than Wanda, than the Winter Soldier, the Hulk, Thor. Me, of course. He’s ahead of Natasha as far as I know which isn’t that far. Barton’s somewhere around there too.”
Sam frowns. “What the hell, Steve. They’re trying to replace you, while you’re right here, and you’re not even going to fight it? You can’t possibly think this ‘superhero by committee’ crap is fair and I know you didn’t ask, but I turned it down. I’ll ride this Falcon shit out as long as I can but the moment they try to dress me like a flag I’m out.” He shoots Steve a look. “That’s my own personal line in the sand, nothing to do with you. I just prefer a uniform that doesn’t have targets painted on my chest and head.”
He wonders if Tony told her they’re still falling into it together, if she knows Steve’s already broken that promise.
“You know what pisses me off the most?" Tony asks hoarsely. "You keep pretending like you didn’t choose him then and you aren’t choosing him now. The Avengers matter to you - great - but stop pretending you’re looking out for me. You’re here for Rogers, Rogers is here for Barnes, and Barnes is here despite my previous best efforts. You and I aren’t friends, Widow.” Regret colours his voice. “We had our chance.”
Tony made it to the edge of the copse in a daze, panting from exertion as Steve crept up nearly silently next to him. Stretched out ahead was an uninterrupted view of the desert. The dunes rose in peaks and troughs following some unknown pattern. The flaming rain streaked slowly through the atmosphere like the slow-motion debris from some hidden inferno. Spitting embers to make up for the absence of stars. The orange against the dark sky seemed so very alive as the meteorites fell and buried themselves in the sand before dying.
