“Doesn’t sound like he’s much of a boyfriend,” Steve said softly, letting his fingers tighten and shift on Tony’s hip. “Leaving you here all alone with a scary guy like that around. He shoulda stuck around. Kept an eye on things. Made sure you were taken care of.”
Tony leaned over the back of the chair, put his arms around Steve’s neck and hugged him.  “I know you are,” he said into his ear.  “You’re not going to be in this thing forever, baby.  The serum’s still in there, still doing its thing, it’s just going to take some time.”  He kissed his shoulder.  “I know this sucks, but you’re doing great.  I’m proud of you.”  Tony felt a hitch in Steve’s chest and tightened his arms around him.  He held him while Steve sniffed and wiped his face with the back of his hand.  He only let go when Steve squeezed his hand.
Tony shook his head, and while he had been able to keep himself from touching his hair, he grasped Steve’s wrist briefly, relishing the warmth of his skin against his palm before he let it go. “No, it’s okay. I’ll come with you. I can hear Bruce’s salad calling my name from here.”
“Steven? Hello. It’s Howard. Howard Stark. I wonder if I could meet with you tomorrow morning? Tony said you work at a diner downtown. Would it be alright if I came and spoke with you? I won’t take up much of your time. I could be there at nine. Let me know if that doesn’t work for you...or if you would rather not. There’s no pressure, son. Call me at this number if there’s an issue, otherwise, I’ll see you at nine. Have a good night.”
Steve left his bag where it fell, and eased himself down into one of the seats.  Tony picked the bag up, stuffed it away in a cabinet, and went to the cockpit.  “Ready when you are, chief.”
Steve nodded.  "'Kay."
“I wasn’t talking about you sucker-punching me.”
“Stop it.”
Tony could never resist that.  Ever.  He was a weak man and he knew it.  He leaned forward, hand still working them together, and kissed Steve’s neck, licking it, sucking on it, marking it with bruises that would fade in minutes.  But he’d know they’d been there.  So would Steve.  It was a secret between them.  Just like Steve only marked him under his clothes where no one else could see.  Just knowing they were there was enough.
“Christmas lunch?” she said skeptically.  “Sounds exactly like that.”
you up there.  I didn’t know where you were.  I didn’t know if you were alive, I didn’t know if you were dead, I didn’t know--” he swallowed hard, “I didn’t know if you were fucking dust.”  Steve stopped, breathing hard, the fury running out of him.  Fresh blood, dark and red, ran from underneath the bandage, staining it.
“Nothing happened while we were together, Pepper,” he said.  “Please, honey, you’ve got to believe me.”
Tony continued to suck, working him through his first orgasm with blithe efficiency. Steve had read somewhere that once you did something thirty times, you were an expert. If that was the case, Tony was definitely an expert at this, and it showed. He knew just what to do, just the right amount of suction, just how to move his lips and tongue to leave Steve a shuddering, liquid puddle of gratification. It was familiar, but never boring. Never quite the same no matter how many times they did this. Tony was an expert at that too.
Steve nodded. “Uh-huh. Kid. Daughter.”
“Is there anything I can do?”
“No, I kiss yours.”
“I’m not going to defend it,” he said weakly.  “They were necessary.  I believed in them.  People had died.”
Tony ran a frustrated hand through his hair. There was a bandage wrapped clumsily around it, a tiny bloom of blood just showing through the white. His hair stuck up in bed-head spikes. It wasn’t the first time he had run a hand through it since they got here. Nor would it be the last. “I can’t call him, Sam. I can’t.”
“You think he’s crazy.  Like literally crazy?”
“Aquarium?”
Steve nodded. “Well, I guess that’s okay then.” He took another sip of his juice--more to have something to do with hands than anything--then leaned forward in his seat. “What did you want to talk to me about, Mr. Stark?” he asked. “I mean, this is...kind of interesting. Talking to you like this. But, my break’s only twenty minutes, and I’m pretty sure you didn’t want to spend the whole thing talking about orange juice.”
“And we acted like it wasn’t a date, but I think we both kind of wondered if it was a date.  Didn’t we?”
He couldn’t stop the tears from falling. He’d been able to stop them with his mother. He’d been able to stop them with Sam, but not here. Not now. Not with Tony. He couldn’t stop them. He couldn’t stop the way he curled into himself even as he stood in Tony’s plush office, either. He was tired. Hurt. Sick with worry and fear and loneliness.
The intercom clicked off and Tony stood up.  “You want a drink?”
“I’m going. Right now. I swear.”
. Thad Ross’s life hinged on Steve’s next words.
Fury grunted, but kept walking. Sam and Tony had the good grace to wait until he had disappeared into the general fray before dissolving into laughter. Steve would have been a little angry if Tony hadn’t put his hand on his arm while he laughed, holding onto him, his fingers gripping the muscle of his bicep, his palm warm against him. When that happened, Steve didn’t feel mad at all. All he felt was a tingly sensation in his stomach that he had felt before...but not for six years.
As he opened the door and greeted the star-struck kid, he heard the chair whisper across the floorboards.  He heard the back door open, then close.
"Okay," Tony said finally. "Okay, baby. Come with me."
He left.
“I already know that, baby.”
. Like I did back then. And itchy. Like there was sand. ‘Cause there was always sand. In everything. All over everything. We called it Moon Dust.” he laughed shortly, the sound jarring in the enclosed space. He looked at Dodger. Ran his fingers over the top of his head, and repeated the words, softly. Quietly. “Moon Dust. Like it was a joke.”
Wanda’s eyes closed.  Her breathing was long and slow, matching Steve breath for breath.  Their entwined hands clasped in the space between them glowed with an eerie red light as Wanda began to work her magic.  Tony’s eyes met Strange’s.  Neither man spoke, neither man moved, and finally Tony let his eyes be drawn back to the red mist twining around Steve and Wanda’s linked hands.
Steve ran a hand through his hair. “Hey.”
“I like the naps that happen while I’m supposed to be watching documentaries.”
“Thanks.”
She smiled at Steve. “A hundred.”
Howard nodded, smiling a little. “Not necessary, son, no,” he said, “but could I join you anyway? Just for a moment? I really would like to talk to you.”
“I don’t think so,” Steve said.
Steve shrugged.  “Go back to work.  They still need you.  I know Fury wants you back.  I heard him ask you.”
“Just a friend with benefits?”
Steve followed him inside, and Tony watched his reaction.  The front of the house was the same.  Everything branched off the newly-expanded kitchen.  Steve glanced that way, then stared at the bedroom door.  The bedroom they had shared.  The bedroom where Tony now slept alone.
“Yeah. You are. You’re staring.”
“What about you?”
“Guys, she would never do that.  She loves Steve.  You should have seen them together.  She would
Steve laughed. “They’re Sam’s. He’s left so much shit over here, he practically has his own drawer.”
And now.
Then the hatch opened.
. He always denied it. Still does.”
Nat’s eyes softened at the same time as Tony’s.
He stood up, grabbing his tray. “Gotta go,” he said. “I can’t be late.”
“God, look at you,” he whispered, then met Steve’s eye.  “May I?”
“No. I’m going.”
“What? Why?”
“Yes, you do,” Tony agreed. “Best pillow ever.” He leaned in and pressed his lips to Steve’s. “I’ll take her to bed,” he said. “Then we’ll have that talk, huh?”
It was too much.
A moment later, the door opened on the lobby level.  No one was down here now except the doorman snoozing away in his chair.  Steve touched the wall of the elevator.  He knew it wasn’t her, and even if it was, she wouldn’t feel it, but he had to touch something.
Tony shook his head again, but this time, he paired it with a horrified face that would have made the pickiest of five-year-olds proud. “
“He saved the universe, Ross.  He
After dessert--simple ice cream and chocolate sauce that was absolutely perfect, in Tony’s opinion--Tony went back into the main living area. There was a gas fireplace built into the wall, and he turned it on before flopping down onto the couch. It was soft. A lot more comfortable than it had looked when he first saw it.
“And what would that be?” He heard Steve breathing behind him.  It was steady, intense, and deep.  Tony did not move his hand.
Tony watched him go, then after he was out of sight, closed his eyes and leaned his head against the upper cabinets, training his ears on Steve’s progress.  He heard the whisper of the chair, the opening of the linen cabinet, Steve’s muttered, “Fuck,” as something fell--Tony smiled at that, indescribably proud of his bad influence--then the cabinet door closing again.
Tony glared at him.  "You are such a dork.  Dad-jokes are never okay, Steve.  They’re not funny.”
That’s what Pepper had said. No fighting. No screaming, no yelling, no accusations of...anything. Because there hadn’t been anything to accuse each other of. It just wasn’t working. That’s all. They still loved each other. They still
Making the wolf howl ;) ...and other stuff.
“I’ll call.”
be doing it, so he just kept his mind busy with other things. His brain didn’t need to be bothered with that part right now. It had other things to focus on. His body said he needed it. His shaking hands said he needed it. His slow, stupid tongue said he needed it. His heart thumping gamely along in spite of everything said he needed it, so he shut his brain out of the equation and just let his body decide this one for now. It needed it, so he did it. He’d let his brain in on the situation some day. Just not today.
"Has there been another attack?"
“The light
them about it over the phone, and still.”  He shook his head.  “Bureaucratic bullshit.”
“I’ll understand if you say no,” Steve was saying.  "I know you've got a girl--”
“Would you be scared?”
Bruce picked up his own cup and stirred it.  “I think it suggests this isn’t the first time he’s been put under hypnosis.”
“The same thing I’m going to say to you,” she said. “Not yet. Maybe someday. But not yet. This is your time. Your time to be together. To make something together. You have never been able to have that before, but you’ve got it now, and I want you to make the most of it.” She kissed the top of his head, and he curled closer in her arms, letting the sound of her voice lull him just like it always had. “Besides, it’s not like you’re going to be that far away. It’s only a few miles. We’ll still see each other almost every day. And you’ll still have your bedroom here and the apartment downstairs for when you want to spend nights. Nothing is really going to change.”
“We were really happy, Nat,” he said.
Pause. Pregnant, waiting pause.
They had written a few times after spending the night together a while back, but it hadn’t lasted long. Tony wrote about school, and work, and his friends, and the weather back in New York, and how he and Howard had rewritten some of the contracts with foreign distributors, and how he was working on a source of clean energy within SI, and a hundred other things. He signed the letters,
“Yes?”
Finally, Rhodey stood up and whistled piercingly loud.  Steve and Tony stopped in mid-rant, the words “goddamn drama queen” wilting on Steve’s lips.
He rubbed his smooth cheek against Tony's shoulder, then kissed him there before lying against him again.  "You're so smart. Have I ever told you how much I love that? How smart you are?"
“It was perfect, Steve,” Tony said into his chest, and pressed closer into him. “It was so fucking perfect.”
We are getting closer to the end. One more chapter, I think (maybe two, we'll see how it shakes out) then after that, I think there's one more story.  I really do think that will be the last one. I am going to try and post it in March.  That will mark the one-year (!!!!!!) anniversary of me starting to write this series.
Bobby must have thought so too.  He couldn't seem to take his eyes off of him for longer than a few seconds at a time.  It wasn't sexual--at least Tony didn't think so--but it was definitely worshipful. Tony thought it was sweet.
Steve thought about what he was doing here, the whole reason they’d even met, and swallowed down the guilt that bubbled up to the surface with another mouthful of coffee.
the work. He needed to work. He needed to keep his mind busy, and all he had was work. Because he didn’t date. He didn’t have the time. Or the desire. He needed work. Just work.
“Awesome-”
She laid her hand against his cheek, doing it so her thumb was over his lips, silencing them.  “It’s alright,” she said.  “I came to help you.”
Nat laughed and took hold of Steve’s arm, tugging him a little.  “Come on.  I think it’s time to retreat, Captain.”
Tony drew in a deep breath.  Ross’ words were concentrated poison.  They were designed to break him, to wound him, to bring him low.  Ross was a brilliant tactician.  He could read people.  Find the chinks in their suits of armor.  And even though he was wearing a hand-made Italian suit on the outside, Tony had always worn a suit of iron around his heart.
“Tony,” Strange snapped.  “Help me.”  He grabbed the girl and tried to pull her away, but Steve had her hands locked in his like a vise-grip.
“But-” those eyes. Drilling into him. Begging him to look into them. “But you’re still my boyfriend, right?”
“Yes.”
“Different how?” Sam asked.  Tony shifted, and Sam explained, “We don’t need, you know, details, just tell us why it was different.”
He opened the door and walked in. The room was dim, but Steve could still see Tony sitting on the chair in the corner. See the way he smiled when Steve came into the room.
“Oh, yeah?”
Tony lifted his head and guided Steve’s mouth to his.  It was soft, sensual, sweet.  A perfect kiss.  A perfect moment.  “Think about that, okay?”
,” Tony went on, feeding off their laughter, “we could get
The door slid open.  “Welcome home, Captain.”
Steve sighed and reached into his pocket. He took out a folded slip of paper. Opened it. Looked at the numbers written inside. It was a phone number. Ten digits. He’d copied it off of a poster hanging on the bulletin board at school on Friday after he, Sam, and Tony had gone their separate ways after lunch. He had carried it in his pocket ever since, switching it from one pair of jeans to the next when he changed, keeping it close, keeping it as a reminder and as a safety net.
“Yesterday.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. That too.”
“Yeah.”
Steve gave Sam a warning look, flashing pleading eyes at him. “Nothing,” he said lightly. “Just dumb stuff.”
“What?”
actively avoiding me?” he asked. “Because that’s what it feels like.”
A feeling of utter shock ran through him, and then she was giggling, more like a child than ever.  He shoved her lightly with his shoulder.  “Nope, no way are you staying here now,” he said in mock-anger.  “Go back to your own room, traitor.”
He traced another letter with the toe of his shoe, adding a V to the S,T, and E.
“No,” Steve said quickly.  “I just know you’re busy.”
“You know I’m not going to do that.”
“I wanna be snuggly every day.”
“It’s not a big deal, Tony,” Steve said, but that didn’t stop him from stretching out along the length of the couch and settling his head against Tony’s chest. It didn’t stop Tony from wrapping his arms around him either. From holding him as close as he could. From planting a kiss to his forehead. From running his hand up and down Steve’s back in a way that he hoped was comforting to Steve, because it was definitely a comfort to Tony, himself. And he needed it. After hearing the things Steve was saying, he
He looked up fast. He knew the voice. The second it was in his ears, he knew the voice, and all of his memories and thoughts and feelings about that voice came crashing down onto him.
Tony looked at him at last, brown eyes flashing with annoyance.  “Why do you think?”
“You really don’t mind if I stay, do you?”
“Of course, Captain.”
almost hear his thoughts:
It was too easy. It always had been.
“FRI?” he said, and she spoke up in his ear.
like Steve.  “Fine.  What was the news?”
“When I come back in the fall to go to school, you’ll pay for it, like we agreed. You’ll pay my room and board, and my other expenses. You said you would, and you will.”
Steve bent his head onto Tony’s shoulder, holding him closer. “Now that you’re here, it is,” he said.
Steve’s shoulders eased.  His eyes did not.  They were direct.  Frank.  Filled with hot, caged want.
Howard nodded, like it was just as he had expected. “Yes,” he said. “She’s very lucky to have you boys to be with her.”
“What?” Tony asked.
“Who’s in charge?” Tony asked, glancing around.  “I need to talk to the boss, the warden, whoever the fuck--”
“Oh my god.”
Steve didn’t answer.  Tony stood for a moment, just brushing his hand through his man’s hair, feeling its softness between his fingers, the gracious curve of his skull.  It was frightening to think that everything that made Steve who he was was contained within that shell.  It felt so delicate beneath his hand, so fragile, so easily broken.
He wanted a shower, but was afraid Steve would call while he was doing it, so, instead, he just changed his clothes, checked his phone then went out onto the deck.
radiating.
“I didn’t kick you out,” he protested softly, and his hand finally slid under Tony’s shirt to touch his bare skin.  “You left.  And besides, you broke in in the first place.”
“Uh-huh.”
She laid her head against his shoulder.  “Kinda makes you miss the days of Hydra agents and assassins, doesn’t it?”
He turned his attention back to Steve instead. The skin of his neck was right there. Right there as a perfect distraction from his irritation with the stupid people on the stupid movie that were blaming that poor AI for their own incompetence. He brushed his fingers over that smooth bit of skin. It felt good. So good. Almost too good, and he was afraid he would not be able to go another second without putting his mouth on it. Without kissing it just a little. And why shouldn’t he? It was dark. There was a movie on the screen. Nobody would even know what he was doing except for him and Steve. Nobody knew that Tony liked to claim every part of Steve’s body that he could on a nightly basis. The super soldier serum did its job very well. It healed his bruises quickly, which not only hid Tony’s possessive streak, but also gave him a beautifully blank canvas to work with whenever he wanted. And right now, he wanted.
“Yeah, I get it, Bill,” he said.  “Youth and agility trumps experience.  I understand that.”
Tony smiled.
He was trying not to stare, but it was getting more difficult by the minute. The couple--young and obviously very much infatuated with each other--seemed to be just getting started. They were still in separate seats, but from the look of things, they wouldn’t be for long. The guy was tugging at the girl’s hair while she sucked on his tongue. They didn’t have any food in front of them, just a couple glasses of water, and Tony wondered if they were waiting on their order, or if they had just come inside the restaurant to get out of the heat...so they could make some heat of their own. And if that was the case, they were doing an excellent job. It certainly felt like a mini-furnace was kicking out the BTUs in their little corner of the world.
The two men looked at it for a moment, both thinking different thoughts about the same man, unified in their love for him.
Steve bit his lip. His eyes rolled up to the ceiling, then closed, trying to keep the tears back. “My mom,” he choked out, and Tony closed the distance between them. He grasped his arm again, holding him tight in his fist.
“Be patient, baby,” Tony said.  “I promise I’ll make it worth the wait.”
“No,” he said lightly. “Just an interested party.”
He left the bedroom and glanced up at the loft again.  Sometimes, after he’d pulled four or five all-nighters, Steve’s body would simply give in, and he’d sleep the clock around.  Tony hoped this was one of those days.  Steve knew he’d been working with the Avengers, but Tony had not told him about Ross’ occasional meetings.  He hadn’t had to.  Had, in fact, forgotten they even existed.  His mind had been a bit preoccupied of late.  What with Steve’s eyes across the table, and Steve’s voice on the phone, and Steve’s body in such close proximity to his own during their leisurely pre-bedtime movies.  Could he really be expected to remember such mundane details as a fucking
“Yeah, but he wasn’t playing against
“Nah.  I wanted you to have some time to yourself.  You don’t have to babysit me all the time.”
“Hmm. I needed her,” Tony said with not a trace of self-consciousness. “Especially after Morgan left. Apparently, I can not be left alone anymore.”
Lots.
Alone.
He glanced over and saw Strange in front of Wanda, smoothing her hair back from her face, speaking in a low voice.  Her eyes were open but unfocused, a runner of saliva depended from her lip.
“Here, baby,” Tony said.  “I want you right here.”
Tony leaned closer. His shoulder pressed against Steve’s, and he tipped his head until his lips were close to Steve’s ear. “It’s just a house,” he said softly, and there was no trace of humor, no trace of sarcasm. All Steve heard was warmth and comfort, and he felt his muscles ease in response. Felt some of the tension leave his body.
Steve ducked his head automatically, the blush heating his cheeks like a brand. “Don’t tease me,” he breathed, knowing full well that Tony was doing anything but. He
to let the others in. And it wasn’t that big of a deal in terms of the world at large, but he still thought it was a miracle. A small one, maybe, but still a miracle.
But he wasn’t unraveling. He wasn’t. He told himself every morning he wasn’t. He was
A small smile played over Tony’s lips, looking one second confident, the next, unsure.  “How does it end?”
“No.  Don’t apologize.  It’s okay.”
Ross held it out, butt-first, and she took it gingerly, a look of disgust on her face.  She didn’t like guns.  Tony could relate.
“Tell me what you want, baby,” Tony said.  “How do you want this to go?”
“He is dangerous,” Tony agreed.  “But only to dangerous people.”  He leaned forward again.  “Does that include you, Ross?  Is that why you’re afraid of him?”
Really am promising a happy ending, though. It might take a couple more chapters of dramangst, but we'll get there!
“I think that depends on the situation.”
Steve sighed again.  “God, you’re perfect.  Why are you so damn perfect?”
Steve shifted a little beneath him. “I’ve got one more thing for you,” he said.
“What about Romanov?  They’ve always seemed very...close.”
“I don’t want to be in there by myself,” he said.  “This was supposed to be our first night together.  Are you really going to make me spend it alone?”
That’s how tonight had gone, and that was what Steve was doing now, not sleeping, just dozing, lying on his back, one hand on his own stomach, the other curled loosely into Tony’s t-shirt.  The rain outside the window was quiet and comforting.  The bed was soft, warm with their combined body heat.  Steve had never felt such perfect contentment in his life.
. Just thinking about it made his head spin. Thinking about all the years he had spent being lonely and sad. All the years where the only bright spot was a phone call from his mother or Sam, or those few fleeting moments he and Tony had stolen together. All the years he’d spent hiding his longing--his
“I swear to god if you say you’re sorry again, I will literally kill you.”
“Are you sure about that?”
Tony swallowed. Closed his eyes. “Can I look now?” he said. “Are you decent?”
“Okay.  Well, thanks for the gesture, but
“You tell me, Steven,” Howard said. “
“I’m serious, Doctor.  If she gets distressed…”
“When do
A pink blush stained his cheeks, his chest.  “I haven’t ever with anyone, really,” he said.
“Go to bed, Tony.”
“No,” she said, the tears already starting. He could hear them, and he put his head in his hand.
He put his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed him long and hard. His right hand clenched in Steve’s shirt, the left moved restlessly up through his hair, to his neck, his shoulder blade. He licked along the seam of Steve’s lips, and they opened for him, letting him in, his tongue delving deep into his mouth, moving hungrily against Steve’s own.
“Hey,” Tony said softly. “Are you okay?”
Light in his eyes, and he moaned. “No.”
Steve thought of her again, thought of her red lips, how they’d tasted.  His hand still tingled.  He clenched his fist and another jolt of that raw, powerful electricity ran up his arm.  “No,” he whispered.  “She was anything but that.”
But right now, he was sipping his water, thinking about how good it tasted, how cool it was going down his throat. How soothing after the fight this afternoon. How much he was enjoying it. How nice it was that Steve had gotten it for him. How nice Steve was in general. How nice it was that they were friends. How nice Steve looked tonight with the sun glinting on his hair, turning the blond into gold. How nice it was when he threw his head back and laughed like he was doing now at something Natasha had said. How much he wished it was something that
“I love you so much.  I never wanted to hurt you.  Please forgive me.”
Steve nodded. “Me too.”
“If I’d known that, I would have stayed in there,” Tony said, and Morgan giggled from her stool. He leaned over and kissed the top of her head, then patted Dodger as he stepped over him to get to Steve. He slipped his hand up Steve’s arm, touched his neck, touched his cheek, let one finger caress the skin under his eyes. “Still pale,” he said, frowning a little. “Do you ever sleep?”
“Fuck you,” Steve answered.
Tony nodded. “Yeah, baby,” he said quietly, almost horrified to realize he was close to tears. “I’m fine.”
Sam--and Tony--really did love dinosaurs, so after they were done with the Mayan exhibit, they went down to the dinosaur rooms and wandered around, talking about how cool the raptors and Tyrannosaurus Rex were. When they finally got tired of that, they got a burger, then, since neither had anything better to do, went to a movie.
“Captain Rogers?”
. We’re-” he sighed again. “We’re, you know,
“You and me.”  Tony rested his hand in his hair.  “I can’t leave my best guy, can I?”
“I miss that sometimes,” Nat said.  “The four of us.  I know that’s an awful thing to say.”
go well, and I don’t know if your mom-”
“Of course, I am.  It’s just the two of us now.  We’ll need each other.”
He drew Steve into his arms and kissed him. “It really is okay, baby,” he said. “I do understand. It’s not your fault. Hell, it’s not Carlos’s fault either. I’ve had to swerve to avoid hitting a kid on a longboard fifty times. Guess I’m lucky there’s never been another car close to me before.”
...and shoved it away, feeling small.  This wasn’t about him.
Steve tore his eyes away from Tony’s and looked at Wanda shyly.  Wanda looked back, the fragility in her eyes breaking Tony’s heart then mending it again in the space of a second.  They looked so alike, they
Steve shifted on his bed. He was suddenly very aware that he was only wearing a towel. That he had really only been with three people in his entire life. That it had been a
Steve kissed his palm again, then just held his hand.  “The less the government’s involved in our lives the better,” he said.  “They’ve fucked us up enough, Tony.  I don’t want them to touch this.
the next time, anyway.
“I didn’t say I don’t know how.  I’m just saying it-” he lifted the paper covered in scratched-out words, “-
And if he happened to get himself hard and get off one more time in the process, all the better for him.
Natasha reached out and grasped his fingers, tugging them gently and repeated, “I missed you.”
Small seeds of anger began to take root in Steve’s stomach.  “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
serious.” That urge again. Tony beat it back down. “It’s nothing.”
“AM, Tony,” he said quietly. “Three
Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair.  “Maybe it’s important,” he said into his ear.
“We were looking for a kitten,” Steve said.  “This thing’s old.  And...you know, it looks really pissed off.”
Steve shook his head, his anger collapsing into bewilderment.  “Whatever, Tony,” he muttered, and walked out.  As he left, he heard the fridge door open, then Tony yelling, “FRIDAY, who ate my goddamn chicken?”
Steve shrugged again, but slid over a bit. There was room, but just barely, and Tony sat pressed against his side. Steve didn’t mind. It was nice. Like hearing the birds overhead was nice. Unexpected, and nice.
Steve laughed, gasping it out in a way that sounded like a sob. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, it does.”
“Boss?” FRIDAY said, her voice tentative.
“Yeah.”
Steve touched his shoulder tentatively. “Tony?” he whispered.
kids. Like when we met the first time.”
He sat the clothes down on the floor, and went into the kitchen, trying to give Steve a little space. He loosened his tie, and called in to the office. He told them he wouldn’t be in, and his assistant just said, “Sure, Tony, no problem. See you Monday.”
Tony closed his eyes, the sheer weight of his relief almost unbearable.  His hands clenched into fists, one at his side, the other still on Steve’s chest.  Steve put his hand over it.
“Are you going to stick it to the fridge with magnets?”
“Yeah,” Steve said. “Sorry it took so long.”
“What the fuck is happening?”
“Do you need a hand with history?” Tony asked, his eyes dark with concern.
Steve smiled a little, and went to the bathroom door. “I won’t be long.”
, yeah, of course, because deep down, no child--either young or old--really believes their parents are anything but immortal, untouchable, god-like creatures, even if they know better. So, shocked, yes.
“Don’t,” Tony said in a soft, almost pleading tone. “Please, Steve. Baby, please don’t ask me that. Please don’t do this again. We’ve done this. We did this a long time ago.
to become a master of it. If you didn’t, you could fuck up. If you fucked up, somebody might end up dead.
Steve shook his head, smiling a little. “Whatever you say,
It was Tony.
“Fine with me,
“I just need to tread carefully.  He’ll tell me, he always does, he just needs to do it in his own time.  His own way.”
Dying alone.
Steve flushed.  Tony
Just a one-syllable-name kind of guy.
They’d driven around for awhile after leaving the cafe on Saturday afternoon, just listening to music and talking, catching up on some of the years in between eleven and seventeen, then said an awkward, shy, hopeful good-bye when Tony dropped him off in front of his building. They hadn’t talked to each other since, and Steve had spent the rest of the weekend nervous about what would happen on Monday when they inevitably encountered each other at school. He had been afraid they would just go on as they had before, that Tony wouldn’t really want to talk to him in school. Wouldn’t really want to hang around with him where his friends could see. But here he was, looking beautiful and golden in the noon sun coming through the high windows of the building.
Tony pressed his face into Steve’s chest kissed him over his heart.  “I’m sorry, baby,” he said.  “I know that wasn’t you.”
“You’re paying them on salary, son,” he’d said, pouring another drink. “Get everything you can out of them. I can guarantee they’re stealing from you. This is where you get it back from them.”
“The very fact that you’re asking me to repeat myself, tells me you heard me just fine.”
“To the Tower?”
Steve closed his eyes. Gripped his glass. Wished brilliantly that it
So thinking, he took another drink.
Tony nodded without hesitation.  “Yeah.  I am.”
Tony snorted a little and shoved his hands in his back pockets.  He was wearing one of his endless band t-shirts.  Led Zeppelin.  Steve had tried listening to them.  He wasn’t a fan.  “Come on, soldier, spit it out.”
“It is?”
Hi everyone. I just wanted to drop a quick note before the chapter to say how much I love you all. These have been tough times lately. Stay safe, stay strong, love and support each other, please. I love all of you. I can't tell you how much.
“I promise.”
“Don’t,” Tony said sharply.  “Please don’t.”
Tony moaned as Ross staggered back, blood spurting between his fingers, as he clutched his face.
“Are we waiting for Tony?”
He was sitting at the table in an office chair, a cup of coffee on the table in front of him.  He was skinny, his face gaunt, his eyes wide and dark and haunted.  He was wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a robe open over them.  They looked rumpled as if he’d slept in them.  His hair, always so neat before, stood up in spikes as if he had run his hand through it constantly.  It had gotten grayer at the temples.
“That’s right.”
“Wow.”
"Well, why the fuck not?"
you hurt?”
. The fucking lunch-date guy that Tony hadn’t wanted to meet with in the first place. He was late, and that screwed up the entire day.
“That’s why.”
“What about Mr. Stark? What does he have to do with this?”
“Yeah,” Steve replied.  “I think I’m his bad luck charm.”
“What are you even doing here?”
“‘Kay. Just us, then,” Tony repeated, his hand slipping back down the length of Steve’s tie. He buttoned his jacket over it. Straightened the lapels. “Talking. Or something.”
Tony pressed his lips to Steve’s forehead.  “I’m not going anywhere.”
A whimper.
“Good.  Stay.”
“Oh yeah,” he answered, then kissed him again, long, hard, and deep, ran his hands over his chest, his shoulders, reaching back to touch his thighs. “So…”
Tony let his head fall back and looked at the sky. He laughed a little. He couldn’t help it. So much time. God. They’d let so much time just go by. Wasted.
The bright banks of fluorescents lit his work bench, his tools, the two cars he’d bought to work on, and the old leather couch from his lab in the Tower.  He’d had the couch shipped up especially.  It had seen him through too many sleepless nights to just leave it to gather dust while he was on sabbatical.  Who knew, he might end up on it again tonight.
Steve is staring at the orange juice brick when Tony takes up the courage to talk to him about it. His cheeks are red and his eyes seem a little wet and Tony's heart goes crazy for the worry, he almost runs to him, putting a hand on one of his and Steven jumps a little but doesn't put distance between them like he usually does.
"Everybody here knows that you would be the first to pop the question, I'd lose too much time finding the right way to do that, probably"
«So what, he gave you a kid who loved me? ... I don't understand»
"Steve, I'm hurt, you didn't propose me yet, all the world is waiting for you to make a move"
He whispers because he doesn't know if it's the right thing to show him how much he's filled with joy, what if Steve didn't really want to be in love with him?
Steve nods again, because it's the only thing he can do to respond to that. He clenches his fists, he doesn't know why Tony has to be so harsh with him.
«I'm the only one who doesn't understand what is going on, right?»
It seemed surreal, a fantasy his desperate mind made up to sweeten the realty he was in — alone with the love of his life at arm's reach, but too far away, probably on the verge of either sacrificing himself or losing him, like many times before.
Tony just sits on Steve's legs like it's nothing or Steve is just another piece of furniture.
«I guess this is my last chance, Steve»
«Jesus, you're perfect at this, Rogers. Watch me have a perfect sleep schedule for the first time in years.» Steve can't help but laugh, carrying Tony out of the room, he kisses his head so more, Tony purrs.
However, back to the important matter, someone is sleeping on Tony's chest, and he doesn't know who they are: whoever decided Tony was comfy enough to be used as a pillow, must have access to the compound, but whoever is in his arm right now, is too light to be anything but a kid.
Steve does blush.
The other man inhales sharply, his hands clutching at Steve's shirt. He pulls back to give him an impressed look.
Would he have kissed anyone who happened to be alone with him at the time?
He rolls his eyes when Tony waggles his eyebrows, but he's very tempted to do as he asks.
Pepper is about to get out of Tony's office when he arrives and her face does a funny thing when she sees him.
His voice sounds way too whiny and distraught, his face must be no better. He didn't intend to appear so pitiful, but it's too late, Tony is already looking at him with softer eyes, lifting his lips in a weak smile.
Steve is inexplicably angry, he just wants to tear apart the cover of the magazine, there's a picture of Pepper and Tony kissing at the bottom, now he notices.
«I won't let you use me and cheat on her, Tony, I'm sorry. I love you, but I have some dignity left. I don't want to ruin your happiness»
“I love you”
«You're touching your lips, old man. Did you finally talk to him?»
Steve realizes then that Natasha never truly explained what she meant — her words were vague and her behavior suspicious. He'd have noticed if only he wasn't so focused on Tony and his feeling.
From times to times, he finds himself reading some of the stories they write about them (although a lot of them have scenes so filthy in it that he closed the web page embarrassed).
«We should go to bed, Tony» he murmurs, his hands feeling Tony's warm skin under the shirt.
He didn't expect Stevie to react so strongly to the suggestion, Steve has met Strange just a few times. He holds Tony even tighter. «He talks to you too much. I don't want you to like him more than you like me.»
«So glad I took my chance that day»
«Since the first time I saw your face? When you opened up your helmet in front of me the very first time.»
"Maybe I'm wrong, but you wouldn't let anything stop you if you really wanted to be with me, you know, I'm the one who pines quietly because he knows he won't have you" Only when he realizes what he said, he puts his hands behind his head to appear casual, hoping he's not blushing and adds "I mean, I would be, not that I am"
«I'm just worried about you, Stevie, there's something strange happening»
«Is it magic? Oh. god no, please, do I have to call Doctor Strange now?»
«Ssh, don't say that, you're my favorite.»
«He can't just ... go on as it nothing ever happened.»
«Marriage...?»
Nat texts Steve!
His mind is so fogged up by the lust, he was giddy with desire just a few moments ago. A selfish, stupid part of him just wants to have this, without thinking about the consequences.
He tries to kiss him again and Steve is so weak that he almost lets him, his knees buckling. Tony doesn't relent, nosing at his neck, putting his lips on it and making Steve's life very difficult.
So, the Captain wasn't hiding any skeleton in his closet, too bad. He probably never saw Steve smiling so much before, though, and he's baffled by the number of words that just got out of the child's mouth. Tony needs a strong cup of coffee and someone that could please tell him why this kid wants to be all over his personal space.
Tony crosses his arms on his chest, his expression thunderous, he opens his mouth but then freezes, gaping.
«She won't come back, I promise, we're safe, we can do whatever we want to...»
He clears his throat, getting up slowly with the boy still clinging to him, he's got work to do.
In the end, Tony Stark's mind will always be a little mystery for him, but it's okay as long as Steve understands his heart.
«So the things Stevie said to me ... and his constant desire of being cuddled by me ... »
«Who cares. You know what I want? You»
He still has accesses to their base, and he's immensely grateful for that.
He senses sweet, tiny kisses being pressed on his head, on his neck, any point Tony can reach and lets out a sigh.
She opens the door slightly and gestures for him to come closer, Steve can barely breathe thinking about the fact Tony is in that room.
Steven freezes at his side then and Tony decides he can't deal with this alone without losing his mind, so he asks Friday to summon everyone who's still staying at the compound, they'll figure out something together.
«Wait, what?» He's practically squealing, Steve can see his lips moving, repeating the words he just said, only slowly.
«Yeah, wonder why, Steven» Natasha says and then launches Thor's phone at him, positive he'll catch it, while Thor complains loudly «Loki says thanks, by the way»
He's sweet and bashful, and he's driving him insane at the same time.
The other man holds him, humming under his breath, content, his hands never leaving his ass.
«Because I wanted to kiss you for ages?»
«Ssh» Tony rests his head on his chest,
Tony laughs a little, because the kid is way too adorable, but he almost falls on his butt when Steven tugs on his shirt. Rhodey looks at him to check if everything is alright, he nods, still smiling and then there's a flash of a camera. Wanda is back in the room with them, she looks down at the Polaroid she's just taken and squeals happily, showing it to everyone. It wasn't the perfect moment : Steven was alarmed and Stevie had his arm raised, angry at the other one.
Tony grins a little, his thumb caressing Steve's bottom lip. He has to close his eyes because it's too much.
Steve is a little dumbfounded, he points at himself, making her tilt her head a little.
They're sticking to questions for now, trying to understand if the kid is from another dimension, another time or if he has some kind of connection with their Steve.
Apparently, Steve is not the only one who fantasizes about him and Tony running hand in hand towards the sunset: thousands and thousands of people do the same every day (and they don't stop there.)
«That little shit. She PLAYED me. I was heart broken and confused, she just wanted me to talk to you»
«Finally» she mutters, smiling a little and nodding at him. «You two should really talk, it's good that you didn't tell anyone you were coming, who knows what he could have done then»
He seats straighter, staring down at the boy. Stevie — always better than Tiny Steve — is trying to seat on his lap and appears kind of hurt by his surprise, Tony pets his hair without thinking too much about it and his face softens immediately.
Obviously, his beliefs were completely crushed by Tony Stark.
Everyone else on the team keeps smirking at him and the Steves, they agree he's innocuous. So, nobody is in a rush, and they're just scattered around the living room, enjoying the little show they're putting on in the middle of it, because Tony keeps standing and the two keep on gravitating around him. Wanda is even searching for her camera to immortalize the moment.
his brain supplies, but it doesn't make sense : Cap would crush him if he lied on top of him like this (with his giant, muscled, hot body — nice, another thought he has to erase from his mind.) and plus, Tony doesn't think he would ever do that with him.
Steve doesn't even know if he really said that, it seemed impossible to breathe, let alone moving his lips. He's pleading, but he doesn't care.
Natasha dragged him out today, said he needed to feel how warm the sun was and to see how many people were around, happy and safe. They're sitting in a cafeteria, she's pretending to read a magazine — actually studying him while sipping some iced tea, and he's doodling, avoiding her eyes.
•~•~•~•
«What about Pepper, Tony?»
Steve open his mouth to protest, he was just shocked, Tony silences him with a tiny kiss «I'll send Natasha a bouquet made up of knives or something, I love her. This morning, I told her how much I loved you and how I thought you hated me after that kiss and she sends you to me.»
Either way, even though they're friends and Steve now knows a lot of things about him, sometimes Tony would do something and Steve wouldn't even start to comprehend why.
«I know what happened, Steve. Tony really needs to stop hiding his head under the sand»
Feigning calm and security is easier than confront Tony about his doubts and when Steve doesn't stress too much about it, it's actually funny.
Bruce is the only one who's trying to take things seriously, but Stevie cried desperately when he suggested taking a blood sample and Tony knows for sure Steven doesn't like the idea of being examined too, so he gave up, studying the three of them from under Thor's arm.
Tony's arm shakes a little when he puts a hand under his chin. He can't ignore his fingers holding his jaws, forcing him to look up. Not because of their strength, but for their gentleness. — he was avoiding his stare : he didn't want to see Tony's disgust or pity.
If looks could kill Tony would probably be the only one still alive in the room. He has the distinct feeling there's something the team is not telling him. Thor, especially, has an arm around Bruce shoulders and his eyes glued on his brand-new phone, laughing to himself and not intervening in any way. Natasha seems smug and pleased. Rhodey is the only one who's looking at him and not at the two Steves, so Tony tries to make sweet eyes at him and when Rhodey doesn't meet his gaze he knows something is up, but then Stevie distracts him.
He feels like a child, jealous and egoistic.
His eyes widen, and he touches his lips, still tingling like it has been moments and not days from that kiss. Natasha smirks knowingly and he regrets ever telling her anything.
Tony's shirt is crumpled, his blond hair are going in every direction, his lips are shiny from the kiss. His eyes are restless, happy, his pupils blown wide.
For being a kid, he sure knows how to be solemn, it's a little bit dramatic. Stevie even looks at him in the eyes, his hand on his chest like he's promising something. Tony almost blushes, imagining an impossible world where Adult Steve says this kind of things to him.
«You know I'm strong and I can do anything for you.»
«I'm not here to ruin your happiness, okay? I swear I will be happy for you, but I can't ignore that kiss, Tony. It was important to me»
«What do you mean? Stevie was some kind of gift to you?»
Steve always underestimate Tony's influence on him. The regret in the other man's voice pained him in a way he didn't expect, he thought he was ready to hear those words.
«It's ... okay. I'm not mad at you» he babbles, his face warming in shame, he tries to do something with his arms, failing uselessly at his sides.
«Love came a little later» he whispers then.
It's been weeks since all this no-sense started and it's the first time Tony actually asks him what he thinks about them being so shipped.
His hands are a little rough, calloused, warm and so different from his armor — they keep wandering on his face, his neck, his shoulders and collarbones, leaving warm trail behind.
Steve isn't worried about it.
«Loki wanted to make things easier for me after I saved Thor's life in battle last time»
“Sure I did,” she said, then kissed the top of his head again. “But I had you. And I had my work, and my friends, and Adelle Perkins, and the church.” Steve snorted a little, and she squeezed him against her side. “Don’t laugh. It was a real comfort to me.”
Maria had liked to ride, and on the few occasions the family had come up here for the day, she had ridden out alone and not come back until nearly dark.
gross!”
Steve frowned a little, looking at him, scrutinizing his face, and if anything, the frown only made him look even more beautiful. More perfect. “You’re okay though, right?” he asked.
Tony huffed a little laugh.  “Say his name.”
“Are you sure you want to do this, boss?”
Strange sighed.  "Thaddeus Ross," he said.  "It looks like Thaddeus Ross shot him in the stomach and left him to die."
Tony sighed. “It was hard. She was excited to go, but she didn’t want to leave. You know what I mean?”
. I’m still kind of. You know. Keyed up. I think a little distance might be a good idea tonight.”
She laughed and ran her hand through his hair. “You boys,” she said.
“Oh.”
“Heathens.”
Steve lifted his head fast, frowning at Tony in confusion. “Alone?” he asked, then smiled a little. “Stark Industries must be a helluva busy place, if they don’t even let your wife come home long enough to help with homework and bedtime.”
“Can we do this now, Stark, please?” he asked.  “We don’t really have time for you to flirt.”
“Unless and until he does something that warrants my attention,” Ross said, “he’s no longer my concern.”
“That’s right,” Tony said. He licked the curve of Steve’s ear, his hand finally making its way into Steve’s lap. He gripped him through his jeans gently, but with enough firmness to make Steve moan. Make him really feel it. “You like that, baby?” Tony asked, massaging his cock, the friction through the denim almost unbearably good. “Does that feel good? I want you to feel good. You should always feel good. You should
“Yeah.”
Steve gave them one last look. Sam, his best friend. His mother, wearing his favorite blue dress. There was a chance, however small, that he would never see them again. And if this was to be the last time, he wanted to burn it into his memory. The two of them, standing close together in the rain.
Steve came for him again, but Tony was ready this time.  As Steve moved toward him, Tony struck out with his foot, pistoning from the hip, and drove it into Steve’s bad left leg.  A flare of sorrow shot through him--
“Rogers.”
Tony put his arms around Steve’s waist and pulled him closer.  “Okay, Captain Grumpy, what is it?  You’re being all cagey and I don’t like it.”
“And he has been interred in a public hospital since then?  Co-mingling with the general population?”
“Clint, Rhodey, and Lang.”
“Another refill, Mr. Stark?”
Steve sighed, and eased even more into Tony's grip, not pressing against him--
“We can’t have that,” he said, and they went up the stairs together.
“How you feeling, big guy?” Tony asked.
He felt him before he saw him.
On his knees, Steve was directly eye-level with Tony. Tony loved that. Loved that, for now at least, they were completely equal. Completely on the same level. Tony touched Steve’s face, his cheek, brushed down the slope of his nose, touched the center of his bottom lip. Steve’s mouth opened obediently at that gentle touch, and Tony let his finger come in contact with the warmth of Steve’s tongue. Steve’s eyes never left his as he gently suckled just the tip of Tony’s finger.
“Babe led the AL in home runs
Thad rolled his eyes. “You’re acting like a child.”
“Mom,” he said, and Sarah shushed him.
The plane taxied down the runway, then finally stopped.  Tony felt it.  So did Steve, but they both sat still until Jerry came on the intercom.  “We’re here,” he said, then Steve was on his feet.
I've got this pretty well mapped out, but I never know for absolute certain what's going to happen in my stories until it's down on the metaphorical paper. I thought Bucky was going to show up here, and yay! He did!
Nobody but Tony and Steven himself is surprised by his sudden burst, he lets go of Tony's shirt and looks around startled, taking a deep breath «I mean... his possessiveness is worrying, right? He's too fixed on Tony»
Steven splutters, his cheeks going impossibly red, Tony feels kinda bad for him, he knows how much Steve hates to be in the spotlight, and they're teasing him mercilessly, Stevie included.
He hopes his face doesn't show too much surprise, pretending is harder when Tony looks him in the eyes.
«Don't say that, Steve. If Nat told you everything, you know what I truly want»
His heart is in his throat when he steps in the elevator, he hasn't worked up the courage to ask Friday to announce his presence to Tony yet.
He's being a little dramatic, but he's always been attracted to Tony — he was always torn between the desire to hit him and the need to kiss him up against a wall, to be honest.
He's whispering against his ear, that day he did the same. Steve gasp when he's aware of sharp teeth nipping tenderly at his chin.
Barnes is way too amused, eating a plum and shaking his head softly every time Steven pulls Tony even closer. Tony would like to shake him, imploring him to explain to him what's going on in his bestie's mind because Steve never acted this way before.
"I'm bi, actually, always been"
Tony's fidgeting on Steve's legs, like he's waiting for something big to happen and Steve raise his head to look at him again, thinking maybe he's missing something. (Tony can't mean what Steve thinks he mean, right? It's just a hypothesis, he's joking, right?)
Tony gestures vaguely between them, he's uncomfortable and taken back from his visit, that much is obvious. It seems he's looking for a way out. Steve winces, trying to stay calm and not let anything stop him.
«How did you even reach the cabinet to take the blanket?»
«I know, my mind can't think about funny things with you holding me like this»
Steve probably should be irritated by all his fixation on his butt cheeks when they're having their first romantic moment, but he doesn't care : Tony's touch always feel good.
"Really? You don't have anything to say about it?"
"Oh you really put some thoughts into this, handsome. You're not wrong" Tony pauses and Steve doesn't meet his eyes while he continues talking, scolding his feature in something reassembling a thoughtful expression and not a desperate one. "But what if I really valued our new friendship and I wanted to test the waters before acting on my feelings? I mean, you never really said you were gay"
There's a weight on his feet, then, and he realizes Tony is standing on them, to have some leverage.
«No, I meant you'll sleep. I'll hold you all night long and then ,maybe, you'll fuck me in the morning»
Steve nods a little, they're both awkward at this. Communication is not their strength and it's a miracle they've now learned how to speak their mind without yelling at each other's face.
Stevie hides his head against Tony's neck, and he just sighs, doing a perfect impression of a wounded puppy.
And then she goes, like leaving his future husband alone with the man he kissed a few days ago is totally not a big deal to her. He's suddenly envious of their relationship, but he shouldn't be surprised : Tony always trusted her with his life, and she obviously does the same.
Years ago, it seemed reasonable that their inability to have a serious conversation, at least without screaming in each other's faces, was getting in Steve's way to understanding the man.
«Because I'm a coward and I've almost lost you once and I couldn't risk it, it was impossible a man like you would ever love me back, anyway»
Now that they're actually friends, Steve knows it must be a Tony-thing (or maybe a I'm-too-in-love-with-him-to-function-around-him-thing. ) that made it hard for Steve to grasp everything about him.
He'll ask Tony why he did that, and then he'll be honest, and they'll both go on – waiting for this confrontation has done nothing but give him useless hope.
But he felt the word whispered against his mouth, he felt Tony's breath warm on his skin and his cold, armored fingers gently cradling his face. Tony was kissing him, the pressure of his lips was so sweet and hesitant, a contrast with the scratching of his beard, his body desperately clutching at him.
So, either Cap was hiding an illegitimate son from them and then the poor baby escaped, seeking for freedom and comfort in his arms or someone pulled the de-aging crap on them again (Honestly, he doesn't know which of the two is the worst case scenario.)
«He kissed me.»
«To sleep, Tony, you have dark circles under your eyes»
She's beautiful and elegant as always, her hair in a pony tail, her lips red and her face a little tired. Steve can picture her so well, in a white dress, walking down the aisle, Tony waiting for her at the altar. He has to stop before his heart hurts too much.
«Is that ... me?» Hearing his deeper voice is a relief, but then again the kid who's rolling his eyes and holding Tony tighter is very much real and now they have a new thing to figure out.
«Yeah, I can see that»
This is the last chance he gives himself to confess his love.
«I thought things were getting better between us, I don't want to lose this again»
Stevie moans against his shoulder, like he'd do on a Monday morning when he has to get up early for school or something, clearly upset by Tony noticing the new presence.
Steve's eyes, bluer under the kitchen light, widen again, and he scratches sheepishly at his hair, he doesn't look at Tony when he speaks again.
He doesn't even know what to say but Tiny Steve doesn't notice that something is wrong. He just nods, beaming, his tiny fingers closing around his sleeve, his tiny body making space for himself in Tony's arm (and Tony should stop using the word tiny so much, but it's impossible not to, he's used to Steve being so much bigger than him.)
Looking at Tony always made his heart tremble, a movement slowly expanding through his body. He always longed to touch, to bring him closer.
«He wishes. Tony's mine now.»
Tony was beside him, his helmet was off, his eyes were pointed in the distance and a part of Steve's mind knew he should have been afraid, but he couldn't bring himself to think about anything else. That could be the last time he'd see the man he loves with all his heart, and he just wanted to relish in the moment, noticing every little detail about him : his warm intelligent eyes focused on something, his thin mouth silently moving, his beard and his upturned nose and his hair now blonde and ruffled, the lines slightly marking his beautiful face.
«That you, her and Pepper talked about the marriage»
There's a blanket carefully draped on him, his tablet is nowhere to be found, and he obviously dozed off.
«YOU COULD HAVE HURT TONY.»
He could remember the dryness of his mouth, his skin buzzing with need under the leather of the suit.
He knows Tony wouldn't push him so much and that he's mostly jocking but he shivers, making him smirk.
Besides, he's feeling really comfortable with Tony so close to him, and he'd do anything to let him stay here a little longer.
«I know, it's my fault, I shouldn't have done it»
Is he really Steve Rogers?
Don't get him wrong, Steve wants an explanation, but he's just not ready to hear him dismissing what happened, so he doesn't push it, hoping for the best.
It makes sense, though. Tony always loved her and now that the world is at peace, he can finally have the perfect life they dreamed about.
As a matter of fact, he likes to browse on the Internet just to check why everyone seems to think they would be perfect for each other.
On the grass, Steve murmured something into Bucky’s ear.  He nodded and sat up, scrubbing his arm across his eyes.  Steve let him go and Bucky stood up.
Steve laughed softly. “I like watching documentaries.”
Steve shrugged.  “Well...yeah.  Kind of.”
up.  Are you?”
But even now, two weeks later, he couldn’t say he
“Stop it.”
Tony nodded.  “Yes...sir?”
They weren’t hiding it--neither of them were interested in hiding anymore--but since they were taking it slow, it still felt like they were keeping it to themselves. Keeping it
“My favorite.”
“I’m serious. For your own good. And the boy’s.
Steve nodded. “He said everything was okay.” His frown deepened. He swallowed. It seemed like a sign of weakness, but it happened before he could stop it. He knotted his hands together behind his back. He wanted to keep them out of sight. If they shook--which they undoubtedly would by the end of this conversation--that would be a sign of weakness too. He could at least control that. He had to. “But everything’s
He shook his head, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly. “Don’t look at me,” he said. “I’m abstaining. At least until the beard goes.”
“Would you like me to order the vitamins?”
Tony reached toward him languidly, not touching him, trying not to, to make his point.  “But you’re still all the way over there.”
It didn’t take long to get there, but it seemed like a long time. With Steve beside him, and the thought of what could be waiting for them at the end of the drive, it felt like it took forever. Tony was a good driver, calm and collected under even the worst circumstances, but he missed a turn once, and honked his horn angrily when a guy on a bike darted out in front of him. The guy flipped him off and kept going, and Tony grumbled about it for the next four blocks, while Steve smiled a fond, teasing smile in his direction.
Steve tucked his debit card back into its slot, then folded his wallet. He shoved it in his pocket. Tony reached for him as he passed, but Steve brushed by him without a glance. “I’ll be in the car,” he said to Nat, and then he was gone.
Bruce gazed at her mildly, not giving an inch.
Tony nodded. “
She snuggled closer, and he heard tears in her voice when she said, “But I’ll miss you, though.”
Tony nodded.  He knew Strange couldn’t see him.  He didn’t give a shit.  “He doesn’t write back.”
They drove for an hour without speaking. Tony turned the radio on, and it played softly, song after song, interrupted by the DJ only a couple times to tell them the time in a voice that spoke of a late night out and limited coffee this morning. Sometimes Tony sang along with the music coming from the speakers. Not loudly, but well, and Steve put his head against the window, watching as the city fell behind them, comforted by the sound of his voice and the feeling of him sitting beside him, existing in the same little pocket of space, even if it was for only this short amount of time.
Tony shifted beneath him, but sunk his fingers into Steve's hair and scratched at his scalp in the way he knew Steve liked. “I don’t mean Nazis, baby,” he said. “I mean regular people. Our friends. Do you think they hate us?”
“Steve,” he said, his voice on edge.  “I’m here.  Okay?  It’s me.  I need you to look me in the eye and know that it’s me.”
“Anything interesting happen while I was gone?”
“I know,” he said. “I know you have to work, but...don’t you think you should come with me? This is hard on Mom. She needs us.”
Tony leaned in and pressed his mouth to Steve’s.  A tiny jolt of electricity seared his lips.  Tony kissed him harder.  “Me too,” he said when he pulled away.
“How long has he been there?”
very cosy, aren’t you?  Two peas in a pod.”
“Just not around me.”
“What happened?”
Tony raised an eyebrow.  "How'd our test go?" he whispered weakly.  "Did we pass?"
“But that’s
“If that’s what you think, you’re not nearly as smart as I thought you were,” Steve said softly.  “I’ll be there to fight,” he said.  “Other than that, I’ll stay away.  And when everyone’s back, I’ll leave for good.”  He began to retreat, one slow careful step at a time, as though there were landmines all around him and snipers above.  “Tell Rhodey I’ll do whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes to get our people back.”
“I don’t know.”
“Okay.”
He knew there was still someone between them, and that
Steve closed his eyes. He drew in a deep breath and shuddered it out, but he didn’t let go of Tony’s hand. He held it tighter.
“Alright, smartass,” Sarah warned, and Steve laughed again. He felt good. God, he felt so good. Sam, and now his Mom. And Dodger--all on his side. They were always on his side, and all of a sudden, he couldn’t wait to get home. Get home and call Tony.
The meeting broke up shortly after, and Steve joined his usual group for coffee. He abstained from the cigarette someone jokingly offered with real regret. He was going to Tony’s after, and he didn’t want him to taste it on his tongue. Tony frowned on cigarettes.
Tony talked for thirty minutes, showing him the improvements he’d made to both maneuverability and weaponry.  Ross, to his credit, seemed pleased, and Tony was beginning to think maybe he didn’t have to hate ol’ Thunderbolt as much as he wanted to, after all.
“Here here,” Bruce said, and Steve and Tony both subsided into moody silence, listening, but not contributing, while the rest of them calmly hashed it out between them.
“No,” he said.
He stood up and cleared the dishes, then ran hot water in the sink.  There was a dishwasher, and he wasn’t above using it, but he liked the methodical act of washing by hand.  It was soothing.
“Sure, when they’re acting like idiots, they’re my kids, too.  I see how it is, Rogers.”
“Then what?”
And don’t ask me that.”
“My birthday’s this weekend.”
“Bad-ass and smart-ass aren’t the same thing, Stark.”
Tony laughed again and lifted Steve’s arm so he could slide out from under it.  Steve whined in the back of his throat, frowning, his eyes still closed.  Oh god, how had he lived without
Steve lifted Tony’s hand to his mouth and kissed it.  “Good.”  He kissed his hand again.  And again.
“Not fair.”
“Are you really that selfish?” Tony asked, knowing it was harsh, knowing it was the one thing that would shake him up, and it did.
Pietro sighed and came to where Steve stood by the door, keys in his hand. “Honey,” he said in a slow, firm voice, “I can’t. I’m sorry, but your mom will be okay. She was just a neighbor.”
He took a step back.
Tony hated the toneless sound of his voice.  There was nothing behind it, no anger, no hurt, just emptiness.  For a split second, Tony wished Thanos was here again, just so he could kick him in the nuts.  He bit his lip as a desperate, liquid laughter rose up in his throat.  He fought it back before it could escape.  Letting it out would be beyond cruel.  Steve would never understand, and Tony would light himself on fire before doing that to him.
Steve shook his head and squared his shoulders.  “How do I look?”
--that set him aflame with jealousy and he refused to speak to either one for two days.
Nat laughed and laid her cool hand on his arm.  “It’s just us, Steve.  And besides, it’s
The car was nothing like the ones he usually drove.  It was a Bentley, a big old dinosaur of a thing.  It had belonged to Howard and had been in storage since he died.  Tony brought it back to the Tower and set it up in the garage.  He changed the oil and the sparkplugs and replaced some of the hoses.  Minor stuff.  Stuff a kid could do.  He took it out for a drive when he was done, rolling down all the windows so the fresh air could come in.  It helped a little, but he bought an air freshener just in case.  It was strawberry.  Not his first choice, but better than the musty scent of age that had been there before.
Tony thought with zero attitude and a sickly respect for her.  Because he was using her.  The same thoughts he used to get hard for her at night were the reason he shouldn’t be here with her at all.  They were what he was using her to
“Um. Great. Thanks.”
He scrubbed a hand over his face and Sam said in a low, barely audible voice, “Tony, on your six.”
And there he stood. In a shaft of New York afternoon light.
They began to leave after the food was gone.  There was still not much talk, but Steve heard Nebula and Rocket pass a few words as they left the room and Scott asked Thor about the eggs--”Did I taste goat cheese?  That was awesome.”  Bruce skulked around the doorway, letting Tony and Rhodey pass, until Natasha stood up.  Steve saw simple longing in his eyes when he followed her out and he rooted him on, silently.
Steve looked up suddenly, meeting Tony’s eyes for the first time. He tried to smile. Tried to be brave. Even if the world was crumbling again. Tony looked back. And Steve saw that his world was crumbling a little too.
Steve blinked, and his eyes cleared. Lost that hungry edge, as they glanced at the doorway again. “Coming, Sam,” he said.
They ordered burgers and fries, and ate while they talked about the movie. They disagreed about it. Steve liked it. Tony didn’t.
But right now, it hurt like a bitch.
“I wonder if I could power down for a bit?” she asked.
in here.
“Are you sure you don’t mind dropping Dodger off?”
--had nearly died.  Where Steve had nearly killed him.  The first time.
they suffer enough?"
Tony heard the music as soon as he stepped out of the elevator. He blinked a little, surprised, and smiled. Steve had eclectic taste in music. Jazz, 80’s New Wave, Seattle grunge, old country/western stuff Tony hadn’t heard in thirty years. He reminded Tony of a bird sometimes. When he heard something he liked--a particular guitar-riff or scrap of lyric--he picked it up. He didn’t care what it was. Like a crow with something shiny, if he liked it, he brought it home to feather his nest. Tony liked that. And hearing it now, some old pre-war song with a lot of trumpet and moody vocals, he thought again how lucky he was. How it felt like Steve was feathering
Steve was looking at the unfamiliar airstrip.  Nothing so grand as an “airport” here.  There was a long runway, a small terminal with twenty or so cars around it, dormant in the dark.  The lights were on in the terminal, however, and a few people milled around inside.  Tony was struck by how warm and intimate it looked from  here, standing outside in the cold.  If he could have reached out and taken Steve’s hand, it would not have been quite so lonely, looking at that island of light in the darkness.  As it was, he felt lonelier than he should have.  Colder too.
“Is it party-time?”
Steve shifted, squeezed him tightly, and bent his head to kiss the back of Tony’s neck.  “Will I get to come home soon?” he asked, and Tony said “Yes,” with no hesitation.
“See?” Steve said, raising an eyebrow at Tony. “She functions just fine too.”
Steve ran a quick hand through his hair, and threw the door open. “Hey,” he said, happy and puzzled at the same time.
“How was everything here?”
Instead of answering, Steve just turned to Tony and shrugged.
Tony reached out and grabbed the arm of Steve’s sweater. His fingers curled into the soft weave and held on, his eyes were darker now, but Steve couldn’t read what was in them. He was afraid he might have lost the knack for that too. “Stop talking like that or I’m going to kick your ass,” Tony said.
“Consequences,” Howard said plainly. “Consequences for one’s actions.”
“She seemed to think you were in distress.”
The car went fast--as fast as the 'Cuda--and Steve liked to drive it as fast as it would go.  With the top down, it was almost like flying. He didn't tell Tony that. Didn't tell him how often he punched the gas pedal to the floor, and just let it ride at the highest speeds, on the loneliest roads, just feeling the wind on his face, whipping through his hair, the motor loud and comforting, the good scent of sun-warm leather and burning leaves, or apple blossoms, or coming rain surrounding him, but he did it a lot.
Bruce wrung his hands, but he laughed a little too. Tony joined him. “PDA is not necessary,” Bruce said. “Some things should be kept private.”
“You know,” Tony said, his voice deceptively light.  “The pangolin people.”
, Steve.  When I need Rhodey,
He said his name at four o’clock, and Steve roused immediately, coming to full wakefulness in a second. His eyes darted from place to place, taking in his surroundings, and only when he realized where he was, did he relax again a little. Neither of them spoke, but Steve kissed him deeply before getting out of bed and going into the bathroom. Tony heard the shower again, then the sounds of him brushing his teeth, a time of silence where he was probably shaving, and when he came back into the bedroom, he was already dressed.
He had no illusions about this place, though.  There was no safety here.  But here he was.
But Steve shook his head.  “I don’t,” he said.
"Yeah.  He was proud of them--saving up the money for the bakery themselves instead of asking you for it--but you're right.  He wanted them home."
apply since it was broad daylight. He nodded, feeling a little shy but still so happy.
Steve looked at his hand for a moment, then shook it. “Yeah,” he said. “Um. You too.”
Tony resisted an almost insurmountable urge to reach up and brush a soothing hand through Steve’s hair. “Nah. Not serious. Pretty
“We’re going to get you to Wakanda,” he said.  “Shuri’s going to fix you.”
“Your mom
“Fuck,” Tony muttered.  “You’re right.  That’s not enough.  They’re the most trafficked mammal in the
Sam frowned. He sat forward in his chair and grasped Steve’s hand. “What are you talking about?”
His left hand clenched automatically. He looked at the fingers. Thought about how long it had taken him to get used to wearing a wedding band once upon a time. And then how long it had taken him to get used to
Steve came up the driveway just as Rhodey was leaving.  He invited him to stay just as Tony had done, but Rhodey turned him down, too.  Meetings and missions, he said.
How many times had he thought of this?  Their bodies moving together, sliding against each other in a smooth, synchronized rhythm, their breathing raw and harsh, hands exploring, mouths open, eyes closed?  How many times had he imagined Steve writhing on a bed beneath him?  Never this bed--that had been beyond his foresight--but some bed, somewhere.  Tony’s name fell from Steve’s lips like an invocation.  Steve’s came from his own in a Pagan chant.  They mixed together to create something more holy than either ever could have achieved alone.
"Happy to do it," Tony said, and stretched in his chair.  He took another sip of coffee and watched out the window as Steve and Bobby lifted an armoire down from the truck.  "I'll bet you're glad they're moving in."

place, and then the bed dipped, and a damp nose was pressed against cheek.
?” Tony asked. “Do you think he’s okay?”
“Hmm.  I just don’t know why you wanted to cover it up in the first place.  You don’t cover the Mona Lisa, Steve.”
“Because Rhodey needs you.”
“We’re a brotherhood, Captain, who--”
He was just sending off his last email to Fury when it hit him.
“No,” Steve said, then reconsidered.  “Well, yeah, I mean, I guess that’s a part of it, but you know, the--” he paused, sighed, “
“Me too, Tony,” Steve breathed, wrapping his arm tightly around Tony’s waist. “I love you, too.”
Steve cupped his hand around the back of her head, holding her gently but firmly.  “I'm so sorry about Vision, red,” he said into her ear.  “He was a good man.”  Wanda nodded, not lifting her head from his chest, content to be held, content to be comforted.  “I would take his place if I could,” Steve went on.  “In a heartbeat.”
“Want that,” Steve said.  He put his free hand over Tony’s, moved it to his mouth, and kissed Tony’s palm.  “I don’t want that.  I’d do it if you want, Tony.  You know I would, but--”
move his own fingers a little. Just enough to make room for Tony’s to slip in between them. And they did.
“Fuck you,” Steve muttered, and Sam and Tony both laughed again while Steve shoved his book in his locker and locked it up. He kept his back turned a little, purposely shutting himself out of Sam and Tony’s space. He wanted to see how--or if--they’d interact with each other. He didn’t want to admit how important it was to him that they get along, but it was.
He didn’t do it for Steve. Oh, hell no. He did it for Clint. And Pepper. And Thor. He did it for everyone who voted on the Fourth. And why not? They were all his friends. And he liked doing nice things for his friends. His
"You need to come.  Right now."
Tony went to the back of the car and popped the trunk.  He reached in, grabbed the chair, and wrangled it out.  It unfolded easily and he rolled it over to Steve’s door.
“Yeah,” Sarah said.
Steve wet his lips--nothing sexy about it now, just a man preparing himself for a chore that could prove difficult--and moved the footrests out of the way.
day,” Tony agreed. He pushed his face into Steve’s neck and kissed his smooth skin. “I missed you so much.”
“Really?” Tony heard the icy strain in his voice but couldn’t seem to prevent it. “Skipping out on meetings? Family dinners? Feels like you’re avoiding me.”
“Um,” Steve said, biting his lip. “I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s something I can do right now.”
“Who’s is?”
“Don’t be a smartass,
“It’s a cat.”
He breathed deep, and under the smells of concrete and exhaust and hot tar was the scent of cherry blossoms.  The scent of summer right around the corner.  Steve filled his lungs full of it.  When he exhaled, he pushed the air of the prison out.  The scent was still in his pores, but it would go away soon enough.
“You two have been down here a long time,” Rhodey said, coming in and glancing around the room.  He looked at Steve then Tony, scrutinizing each of them in turn.  “I’m not seeing any blood.  And you’ve both got all of your limbs intact, so I guess that’s a good sign.”
Tony ran his hand through Steve’s hair. “Yay,” he said in a giddy tone that made Steve’s heart thump double-time. “
Steve let out a reluctant breath.  “There was this one guy,” he said carefully.  “A nice kid.  Blake, I think.  Or maybe Black.  He was from Nevada.  I remember that.  He had a keychain with some dice on it.  He said he’d gotten it in Las Vegas, and he carried it to remind him of home.”
Nothing.
“No, Tony.”  He stopped, and Tony heard him swallow, heard his ragged inhale, felt the hitch in his chest beneath their linked hands.
you happy, Stark?” Ross asked sincerely.  “Are you really happy?”
Nope, not heartbreak anymore.  What was the alternative?  Old age?  Fine.  Old-man tears were allowed.
Tony held the phone, but he didn’t dial anything yet. He just sat with it in his hand. His tongue stole out and probed the corner of his mouth. There was a small cut there too. A shallow gash over his right eyebrow. His clothes--t-shirt, jeans, leather jacket--were wrinkled and dusty. “What do I say?” he asked, his voice and face both dejected and sad. He looked up at the cop. “What do other people say?”
“Not yet.  Give me a minute.  Let me try and fix this.”
“I would prefer it if you went and fucked yourself.”
would be a perk.
“No you didn’t,” Tony countered. “You took some time. Not the same thing.”
“Almost there, baby,” Tony said, when they got back into the car.
Tony closed his eyes.  He was sure there was a world spinning outside of this booth, and people living lives that had nothing to do with this, but right now, he was having a difficult time believing it.
“Do you always dress up so nice to get bagels?”
"Me? Jealous? Of a younger, prettier version who got to have birthday-sex with you before I did? Noooo. Never."
“Do you really need an audience to make a gauntlet?”
Tony leaned against the railing.  He was near enough to touch Steve, but he didn’t do it.  “Why?”
“I said, do you hear me?”
Steve stopped frowning, but his face stayed serious. Tony was glad. He liked how serious Steve was about things that mattered. He loved it. “Okay,” he agreed.
Steve started to walk away, but Tony grabbed his arm.  “No.  No, it can wait ‘til morning.  Stay here, okay.  Just-just stay with me?”
“I hate you,” Tony sulked.
, he’d written.
“I told you I didn’t think anybody would come up here right now.”
“Okay,” Tony said, nodding encouragingly.  “Okay, sounds good so far.  What else?”
a kid. Sixteen. Maybe seventeen. Surely no older than that.
“Fuck the loft,” Tony said.  “This is where you belong.”
he thought.
“Steve,” Tony pleaded.  “Hey, come on, open your eyes and look at me, ‘kay?  I am not Johann Schmidt.  He’s gone.  Far away, remember?  Nebula told us he was on some other
“Okay, okay,” he relented.  “Why don’t you want me to say
"It'll never
“Yeah,” he said, smiling his little Cheshire Cat smile, “nobody ever accused me of that.”  He picked up his plate, sat it in his lap, then took Tony’s.  “Come on, check the locks and put out the candles.  I’ll do these.”
I thought of this scene really early on in the story. I thought it would be a fun little ending to the whole "Thad" situation, and I was really excited about writing it. I live in America, and as most of you are aware, a lot of shit involving the police has happened here since then. A lot of bad shit. And I debated for weeks about whether I should write the scene the way I had conceived it earlier, or if I should try and change it to just exclude the whole thing. It's not a huge part of the story, and I would not want to offend anyone, but I decided to leave it in. I'm not sure if I made the right choice, but, it's the choice I made. I was going to just have this be a part of the whole long last chapter, but I decided to post this part on its own, so we can have the good part--the happy ending I have promised from day one--be its own thing without this part, in case it bothers anyone. I kept it super light, because this is fiction, and light is the whole tone I wanted from the time I thought of this scene in the first place.
He shook his head. “I want to,” he said.
Howard kept his smile. “Then you understand what I’m talking about.”
excited, he was too. “We’re taking it slow. Really slow. In case it doesn’t work out.”
“Is he coming back?”
“You don’t mind?”
“Yeah.”
.  I don’t want to hear one more word out of your mouth about her.”
had never sounded so much like a bad thing. “Then what’s wrong? Why are you so angry?”
“Nothing,” he said, looking back down at the table. “I was just thinking...maybe we could study somewhere else today.”
Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair, relishing the texture between his fingers. “It won’t be forever,” he whispered, kissing him again. “I will promise you that. Just another few years, and then I’ll-” a strange look passed over his face, both relieved and endearingly worried, “-retire. I guess.”
Tony stood.  “What happened to you?”
like he could get it right, if…
Tony let out a surprised laugh.  “You switching teams, Colonel?”
“But, it is, Steven,” Howard said in a curiously gentle, curiously kind voice. “It
“Hello, Stark.”
“A thing?”
Steve nodded. “Okay,” he said, and smiled when Pietro kissed him again. “But really come over when you’re done. This is important too.”
And now, he was a little worried.
But as much as he wanted to make it fly, none of the scenarios worked out.  This was Strange’s Sanctum.  Pepper was here-willingly and comfortably.  Tony was here-reluctantly and rather
“I can’t discuss his treatment with you.”
“Very hot.”
“Who said anything about talking?”
“Of course, we will.  We’ve gone this long without trying to kill each other, haven’t we?”
“I hate you.”
They were silent for a moment, just looking at each other, Steve lying prone on the bed, Tony sitting overtop him, legs intertwined. Tony was acutely aware he was still wearing his suit pants--his cock was letting itself be known, pressing uncomfortably against its fabric prison--and even more aware that Steve was not wearing anything, except…
“Are we going to stay at the cabin, Tony?”
Pause. “That could mean a change in the parameters of your situation.”
Tony laughed again.  “Wow.  I’d be mad at you if this wasn’t so adorable.”  He squeezed Steve’s waist, then took his hand.  “Okay.  I can’t believe I’m saying this, but you two need to make up.”  He pulled Steve to the table where Sir Purr sat.  “Pet him.”
“No, Tony, don’t go,” Steve said.  “Stay.  Let’s talk or something.  We can’t keep avoiding each other.  I can’t.  Not with Than--”
He shook him harder, and Steve jolted awake, his eyes glassy and unfocused.
Steve pulled back just a little, just enough to take a breath, then laughed it softly out. “Wow. Guess that’s okay, then?”
Steve nodded up at him gratefully.  Tony watched out of the corner of his eye and shook his head in disgust.  Stephen Strange to the rescue, once again.
“Alright.  Contingency six, then, everyone.”
He leaned heavily against the glass, holding the phone to his chest now, tears falling, body wracked with sobs, and the screaming was back, pounding in his brain in time with his pulse. It was cold. Freezing. The phone was still in his hand. If it had been his pistol, he would have used it. He would not have hesitated. Not for one single second.
mad. Steve could hear it in his voice. “Baby,” Tony said. “I’m not mad. I just want you home.”
“Yeah.”
“Do you want me to make you a plate?”
Pietro glanced at the little table on Steve’s side of the bed. Well, the side that
“Oh, really?”
“How many years?” he asked, curious in spite of himself.
Tony was shaking his head.  “I don’t care,” he said in an off-hand kind of way.
“Stay--”
He never sent them.
Because that was
Tony,” she said, and held out her hand.
“It’s--”
“You kissed me.”
“Lie still, sweetness.”
Sorry this is incomplete. I'll be better. I promise. I'm blaming it on the cold and snow.
The kid.
, he said.
Tony laughed with him and undid another button. “Yeah, well.”
“I love you.”
“I’m not gonna break up with him just because you want me to,” Steve said. “I won’t do that.”
Just because someone else’s birthday happened to be the same day did not even enter into the equation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony laughed.  “Talk about something else then,” he said, curling his free arm through Steve’s and letting him lead him back to the kitchen.  Dinner was on the stove.  Spaghetti and homemade marinara.  Garlic bread on the counter all ready for the oven.  Salad in the fridge.  Bottle of chianti on the table.  “I want to listen to you talk all night.  Okay, baby?”
“It’s kinda dumb for you to sleep in that chair.”
He came toward Mr. Stark and Howard extended his hand. “Steven,” he said, smiling, “it’s good to see you.”
“In case you’ve forgotten, Thaddeus,” Fury said.  His voice was loud but calm, his lone dark eye ablaze.  He was not used to being overridden.  “Captain Rogers never did sign the Accords.”
“I know so.”
through that, you mean. I know you’re still scared of her.”
“Better to be over-prepared than under,” he said.  “But I’ll see you tomorrow.”
For just a moment, Tony’s mind was flooded with images.  The lake house, the wheelchair, Thanos, a tiny blonde woman in a house dress, Natasha, dirty, disheveled, and absolutely goddess-like in her beauty, a barn, the bunker in Siberia, Thaddeus Ross outside of a dark cell, grinning his triumphant, shark-like grin, that grassy hill in Central Park, a young Sergeant Barnes resplendent in his dress uniform, the common room in the Tower.  And himself, of course.  He saw himself a dozen times, a hundred times, a
“Shut up, Tony.”
“Holy shit, what did you do?” Steve asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You don’t like it,” Tony said decisively.  “It’s okay.  We can go.”
“Sounds like it back-fired.”
“Good for him to see you.”
“Yes.”
“Nope.  No more stalling.  You’ve been full-on Grizzly Addams long enough.”
He really
after all the time, and all the struggles, and all the grief and hurt and pain, he was able to do it. Finally able to give Tony what he deserved.
I ever dress up as a cheerleader, you can take all the pictures you want.”
“Suit yourself.”
“However, upon closer review…”
Beside them, Dodger shifted from foot to foot. He looked up at Steve and whined, his brown eyes almost seeming to look worried. And when that happened, Steve’s cleared. That sharp edge to his gaze softened, and it was Steve again. Just Steve. He reached down and patted Dodger’s flank. “It’s okay, Dodge,” he whispered. “I’m okay.”
“Did I do something wrong?” he asked, and Tony laughed, latching onto his neck, sucking and nipping at it with his teeth before pulling away.
“Thank you, FRIDAY,” he said softly.  “I’m sorry.”
She brushed past Tony and clambered up onto the big bed. Steve pulled the covers up over her. She held up her arms. “Kisses.” He kissed her, smiling when her little arms closed around his neck and hugged him tight, tight, tight.
“Yeah, it is usually my fault, isn’t it?”
Tony let out a relieved breath. “Good. Puppets freak me out.”
But his brain catches up with reality.
Tony keeps petting him just to have something to do with his hands and because he can't really stand that sad face (Captain America's orders would be much more effective on him if he'd use that face too), Stevie holds him tighter.
The team was calling for them and Tony stepped away from him, putting on his helmet and acting like he hadn't just shaken the earth underneath Steve's feet. It was too much too soon, but Steve knew they had a job to do.
Steve always believed himself to be a pretty empathetic and intuitive person : he always thought he could somehow understand people way of thinking or their actions, given time and observation.
Steve deeply breathed in his scent, his fingertips uselessly trying to feel Tony's skin under his gloves. He wanted to take everything he could. But just as he was trying to put his arms around Tony's waist, to kiss him deeply or say something about his feeling, it was over.
It's not what he came here to say and it's not even completely true, but Tony seems relieved.
Lately, for instance, he's really concerned with Tony obsession for their fan base.
«We ... can't. Natasha told me about the marriage and you said that's what you wanted. We can't do this»
«I know Pep, I know, this is not the proper way a business man should sit in his office, but let's be honest, when do I ever do things properly? I just need to relax a little, all... wait, why aren't you talking over me like you always do?»
