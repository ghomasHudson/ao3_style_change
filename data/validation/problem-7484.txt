“Is it always like this?”
He began making a routine of it. Every time Steve left on his little recon missions, Tony would wait for the sound of the metal door closing and then another hour after that. Then he would go down, carrying a candle and a blanket.
His voice had softened to a whisper.
Tony didn’t say anything to that. Was that a warning? Was he supposed to start running now?
Tony didn’t move from where he was curled up on the mattress, facing the wall. The mattress was wet and cold beneath his cheek.
Tony forcefully discarded that train of thought.
Its right arm darted out like a snake and went straight for Steve.
“Did he - did he hurt you?”
“I think everyone would be happier if he just stood quietly in the corner and looked pretty.”
He kept up a steady stream of soft assurances as he took a step back and pulled.
“Fuck me. I’ve never seen anything like it. Pack it up. I’ll bet we can find many fuckers salivating over this.”
Tony blinked for a second.
It was still breathing evenly, deep gulping breaths like a dog sniffing the air. Its eyes were fixed on Tony’s neck.
“Odd choice of a name, but that’s what Steve gave me so I’ll roll with it.”
“Now what?”
Steve huffed a laugh. “I don’t doubt that.”
Being alone was good. Being alone was safe. He had to keep telling himself that when the quiet became unbearable.
He looked up, and his eyes roamed aimlessly over the room.
“Spare me. I don’t need your apologies, and I don’t want to hear your pathetic attempts at making yourself feel better.”
“The sun will rise soon" the voice was quiet, as if afraid the noise would make him shatter. "I need to make sure upstairs is safe. You - Do you want to wait here or … or you can come upstairs.”
Hi everyone! Thousands of apologies for how long it has taken me to update this. Real life has been getting in the way, but I can promise you that this fic will never be abandoned. I have it all plotted out and hopefully, over an unknown period of time, we'll all get to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
When it took its first step towards him, Tony’s knees almost gave out in the effort of standing still.
The small Bible had been resting underneath the sketchbook. It was utterly undistinguished, but Tony thumbed through it anyway a few days later out of utter boredom. All the boxes had been sorted through, all their belonging rearranged, all the old novels read, the mystery of the metal arm still out of his reach without any tools at his disposal.
The fabric peeled away from a pale torso, thin to the point of starvation.
“Steve” his voice broke. “Steve, please.” To his shame, his eyes filled with tears. ”It’s not just my life you’re gambling with.”
“He? Who the hell is he? Do you think there still is
Steve turned back towards him.
“So him going for your throat is a normal Sunday afternoon?”
to go?”
A wave of boiling anger suddenly evaporated Tony’s terror.
He knew what was inside before he saw the silvery glint of the gun.
Steve. He needed Steve. Steve would know how to handle this.
His eyes shot to the man’s face and he realised with a start that he was still not watching him, his gaze lost somewhere in the middle distance.
“Safe houses? You what? So the new plan to prepare for their next visit is to leave me alone
Tony thought of its eyes, that animalistic intensity which bled into insanity, and wondered how much time Steve had spent to convince himself that a man still existed.
The thought of being carried made his skin crawl.
“He definitely offers advantages in the home-security department. When he deigns to actually be home, of course.”
Its hair was obscuring most of his face, but the rhythmic heaves of its body were unmistakable. Tony vividly felt like prey.
Tony blinked after him, watching him rush to the basement door and disappear into the dark.
He walked towards the door, not a hint of hesitation in his step. Over the heavy noise from within, Tony made out the sound of metal scraping against metal. A high and piercing screech.
He was careful not to let his fingers touch skin.
So Steve had checked. He had come down and opened the door. He had opened the door even after seeing the mauled bodies. He wouldn’t abandon it. He never would.
so fucking special?”
Tony turned his head and looked at Steve. There was a cut high on his brow bone, but the blood looked odd, like it had already congealed. The wound was disproportionately small to the amount of red smeared on his face.
THUMP.
Tony slowly backed away towards the staircase without turning his head, chasing the thin sliver of light in the corner of his eye.
He came back and nudged Tony through the hole, into a small damp room. A wooden staircase to the right. A basement then. A door to the left, metal. On the -
Tony crouched next to the tub and tried once more to catch his eye, to no avail.
“I recognized you as soon as I saw you. To be fair, I had my doubts that Tony Stark would be in an alley in the middle of this wasteland… but then you told me your name.”
-----------
His gaze slid to the shuttered windows.
Steve was out again, looking for a new place they could hide away in. And Tony was down there again, sitting on the wooden steps and thinking about how he shouldn’t judge Steve for how mental he was given his own obvious lunacy.
Around the metal fused into his flesh, grotesque in its brutality, the skin was shredded and bloody. Deep gauges cut diagonally across what was left of his pale shoulder, and Tony remembered the bloodied hand of the creature that had stepped out of that basement door, fingers dripping red.
-----------
“What else are you gonna do though? Wanna bet how long it will take them to find you? It’s that or some gang. I don’t have to tell you what they do to Omegas, do I?”
He yelped and jumped back, panting madly and trying to push past the panic clouding his mind.
“Steve?” Tony whispered.
Tony stood there and watched.
With Steve not objecting, Tony kept carefully turning the old pages. They stayed like that, in a companionable silence, Steve leaning against the opposite wall and reading an old book, until Tony fell upon a drawing that made him chuckle despite himself. Even drawn in charcoal, the uniform was unmistakable.
He hesitated another second.
“No, I usually let the sunlight in. Today I blocked the windows before I left, just in case I wouldn’t make it back in time. But you don’t have anything to worry about, the place is like a fortress during the night and others give this place a wide berth during the day. It’s the smell, I think.”
He was so lost in his own nightmares, that he didn’t hear the shuffling of another body, and didn’t understand what happened until the heavy body was lifted from his.
“So what’s the plan, Stevie? Offer me up as a chew toy for
The flashlight fell to the floor and rolled towards a wall. Torn flesh and clotting blood spilled out of the darkness. The memories from earlier came back to him all at once, and bile rose sharply in his throat.
“He’s not a monster.”
The lurching cold spasm in Tony’s chest felt like drowning.
Then all sound stopped.
“I won’t stray that far again. I’ll make sure you’re safe. I promise.”
Steve didn’t answer.
Feet were scraping frantically against the floor, while the sound of harsh breathing was intercut by Steve’s sobs.
that. Just believed it in the bone-deep way a drowning man needs to believe there is a shore ahead.
But the creature didn’t flinch. He hardly reacted, its empty stare still fixed on his face with all the intensity of a starved animal.
There’s nothing human in there left. Now it’s just banging its head against the wall because he
“I’ll admit, there is also the aesthetic advantage.”
Tony was now sure he must have been a soldier. He reminded him vividly of the men he had seen come back from the war, their silent despair and pained stiffness.
“So now what? You take him out to play? Or do you want to scrub me up first?”
He had been prepared for violence and giving away parts of himself, but the creature he ended up facing tapped into a fear so instinctive and overpowering he had completely lost any lucidity.
THUMP
Steve hadn’t explained much about their water supply, the need to conserve it obvious enough. But Tony found himself letting the water flow freely into the large tub. It came out hot and steaming, courtesy of the wood boiler in the house.
-----------
“Sorry - I - Sorry. I just wasn’t sure - sometimes I’m not sure what is - I had to check if - Sorry. I’ll go.”
“Well, at least it looks like it’s got potential. Jake, you go check out those boxes on the right while we - What the fuck are you doing, Matt?”.
He went for the window. But of fucking course, Steve would take care to lock it just in case Tony got any stupid ideas.
Tony rolled his eyes.
Distantly, he was aware of the stupidity of his rash words. But he was just so tired. He’d already seen enough of what happened when stray Alphas ran into an Omega after so many years of isolation and violence. He might as well give things a nudge just so that he could either go back to breathing or properly work himself into being terrified. Anything but this constant fog of fear that always clouded his mind and put a strain on his already frail body.
Its head turned towards him and fixed there.
It was so unnaturally quiet that for a second Tony had the irrational certainty that he had been already buried. That he would turn and there would be no door. No way out.
He was breathing raggedly, his clenched fists twitching. He seemed a breath away from grabbing him by the throat.
“Bucky! Bucky, it’s me.”
Steve’s eyes didn’t waver from the purplish tint of the horizon.
He had washed and eaten another can of beans. Steve had even magically produced a small offering of cheap chocolate, wrapped in stained aluminium foil. The sugar had helped more than anything, even if he couldn't tell the taste.
. Let go of - “
He hadn’t lasted more than a day. He told himself it was boredom.
What threw him was not the words, but the calm and normalcy of his voice. As if he was asking if he’d like to go out for coffee.
He obviously had access to water and a fairly safe shelter.
Tony blinked at him. He took the offering. “Oh. Okay. I’ll - I’ll be here when you’re back.”
“Who’s Bucky?”
Its fist slammed into Steve’s throat with enough force to crush his windpipe, sending him down to his knees.  Tony barely heard the horrible wet noise of his gasp over the growing drum in his ears.
Tony looked at the quickly filling bathtub, then back at the clothes.
The kid laughed nervously. “Common, Matt. He could be back any second.”
Sometimes he could swear the voice of reason rarely reverberating around his head sounded like Pepper. He should listen more. He should have listened more while she was still alive.
Steve nodded at the floor, his shoulders relaxing minutely.
Now that they were upstairs, daylight still pouring through the windows, he was suddenly unsure what to do next. He considered just staying there and waiting for Steve, but then remembered how that had ended last time.
----------
“I don’t care if you decided to adopt a rabid animal I’m - “
It would be either Steve’s patience or Tony’s sanity, but
Steve turned off the electric light and lighted another candle.
I can also promise there will be a new chapter in the next couple of days.
The sounds of the struggle continued. Another crash, a heavy body hitting the floor, a guttural whine that sounded like both pain and fury.
Steve’s face flashed with a mix of emotions Tony couldn’t even begin to understand.
“He’s not - “
“You’re supposed to choose which way you think you’ll be better off.”
is here?”
“Tony. Sorry. I’m sorry. Are you okay? Tony, look at me.”
dragged me into? Go find the nearest monster to rip you to pieces?”
“I should go? Go where exactly? I wasn’t even aware I
“And you don’t care what you have to do to save him, do you?”
He spent his days sleeping and absently thinking about his past life. Every time he woke up in the gray mist of morning and realized where he was, he only turned away from the light and burrowed back beneath the blanket.
Tony started frantically going through all the ways he knew to incapacitate someone. To hurt.
“Bucky! Please - please, Bucky. I’m so sorry.”
“You said you won’t hurt me.”
Tony scoffed.
The first thing that hit him was the utter darkness inside. It didn’t look like shadow, but like pure nothingness. Something was moving within, like water swirling in a deep lake.
“I just wanted to tell you - You should go. He seems to be growing more and more - wild, and I - I can hold him only for so long.”
----------
“I’m here. Steve, I’m here.”
My life has been a bit of a mess lately (a feeling I think most of us share), and I want to apologise for letting you wait for so long between updates. I'm writing this now because I want to assure everyone the story is not abandoned, and it is all planned out. All it's missing is the time to polish it and let it see the light. But I promise you I will get there.
Steve’s hand abruptly moved from his arm to clutch at his shirt and promptly slammed him against a wall.
Tony kept wondering if this rated as the stupidest thing he had ever done or the risk of immediate and spontaneous disaster gave it extra points.
A monster hiding under your bed.
He quickly scanned the room and cursed himself for his stupidity. He had been in that room for days and he had barely bothered to look around. He almost rushed to the nearest stack of boxes to look for anything useful, when the first step of the wooden staircase creaked.
“And how exactly do you plan on moving him?”
Something slammed against the door.
Then he remembered, like an image from a nightmare, a bloodied and empty sleeve.
He was shockingly young.
The stump of the shoulder immediately drew his eye. It was encased in metal, gleaming dully in the neon bathroom light. Tony stared.
Tony pressed his body tightly against the wall, his palms against his ears. The sounds were permeated by such stark despair that they were too agonizing to listen to.
wouldn’t be enough to hold it and Steve’s underlying certainty that he would stand there on the other side until the very end, and went straight to anger.
Tony kept his eyes closed for a few seconds more. He thought of his old home, the warm sheets and the subtle smell of coffee that permeated every room. He thought of Pepper.
me and all it can conceive is a way to get to me like the monster it - ”
Tony ended up taking the mattress. Steve had retreated to a far corner of the room, insisting Tony be comfortable. After deliberating on whether or not he should point out that Steve’s regard for his comfort had become irrelevant the moment he had dragged him in the path of his slavering boyfriend, Tony accepted.
“I’m sure as fuck not staying down here.”
“I’m sorry, I won't touch it anymore. You can let go. I promise I won’t touch it.”
He saw Steve’s violent flinch but he didn’t wait for a reply before going into the bathroom and slamming the door behind him.
When it was merely a few feet away, Tony saw its eyes. They were startlingly blue and empty.
Brickface pulled away with a grunt. “You’d shut the fuck up with your shit if you could
him. Actually see him beyond the shape of a nightmare he had been so far.
it. I’ll take my chances outside. Now
Tony scoffed.
The creature quickly followed with a swift kick to the torso, its movements fluid like water.
Nothing happened. Tony inhaled slowly.
Tony again contemplated waiting in the bathroom until Steve turned up.
The water was blissfully warm. Tony tried to be quick, he really did, but he couldn’t help the first few seconds of almost painful pleasure when the water hit his body. He told himself it was only water that trickled down his cheeks.
It was still night, the steel blinds firmly shut. The room was empty.
Steve set his jaw and didn’t respond.  Tony wasn’t sure whether Steve’s increasingly obvious self-awareness was making him feel better or worse.
He held up the sketchbook he was thumbing through.
As more awareness began trickling back to him, he had to start actively shying away from many of his thoughts. Fragments of darkness and cold, cave walls and moist breathing, a searing pain in his thigh. A cold blue gaze watching him like prey.
So he waited, staring down the man before him.
But he followed.
He looked dazed, his eyes out of focus, having just followed sleepily while Tony tugged him up by the wrist. Now he was just standing there, swaying slowly.
“Hey.”
He kept well away from his neck.
“I know.” He closed his eyes and rubbed a hand through his short hair. “We’ll have to move soon. It’s unlikely they came here without telling someone where they’re going. And this place is not at full capacity so we can’t exactly bunker up in here. Besides, I don’t want to risk having to fight off a dozen Alphas while Bucky is in this state.”
“That was clever.”
“You’ll die of pneumonia out here, you know.”
The corridor ended with a wall where a dark hole lay gaping, mostly hidden by an enormous boulder. Steve let him go and put down the flashlight, it’s light spilling towards the crude entrance. After steadying himself against the slippery floor, he pushed it out of the way with his bare hands.
He almost opened his mouth to plead, but instead he bit his tongue until he tasted blood. He had sworn never to beg them again.
“Tony -”
Tony’s breaths were shortening and he could feel his heart beating quicker, but he thought again of wild animals and resisted the urge the struggle.
“I’m sorry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony froze.
“I haven’t lost him yet.”
-----------
After Steve had waited for him to get to his feet and ride out the first wave of dizziness, he had led the way to a nearby tube station. He had made no move to touch him or nudge him along, simply walking ahead, trusting Tony to follow. Down into the darkness, he had magically produced a flashlight, not acknowledging Tony after his first reassurances that the distance was short and that food was already stashed away.
--------------------------------------
He still remembered the one that had attacked his father many years ago. He had been too young to properly understand what he was seeing, but the image of the creature coiling and writhing on the carpet was still imprinted in his memory. Broken glass cutting its skin while it jerked with the electric current of the tasers embedded in its flesh, the blood staining the white wool as red as its hair.
Dearest readers,
He was unnaturally warm.
That wasn’t Steve. That sure as fuck wasn’t Steve crashing through the window in the middle of the fucking day.
“I was pretty much on my own after that.”
Steve didn’t say anything and kept dragging him forward, his laugh leaving behind an empty echo.
.” He kept his voice calm and firm by force of will alone.
He went back to reading, but then he added, almost like an afterthought. “Some people said he came back. Before the war.”
Tony had to get out of there. Only someone desperate would break into a house that reeked of Alpha in broad daylight.
There were never any other sounds, no growls or banging. It seemed calm when just Steve was there, allowed him inside and back out without a fight.
Steve’s body made a heavy thud as it crumpled on the concrete.
When the banging started, Tony had fled. He didn’t go back.
“Yes. Some time ago.”
At first Tony had assumed Steve was just staying in the basement. But then one day he had worked up the courage to creep down and check. The room had been empty. The boulder firmly put in place.
They began rummaging through the room, turning over boxes and clearing out shelves, crashing like animals into the careful tidiness Steve so obviously preferred.
Tony could imagine him like that, sitting on a floor next to a shuttered window, his temple leaning against the wood. His own voice the only sound in the room, his breathing the only fracture in the still air, the rhythmical metallic thud of a door the only measure of the years that slipped by.
He didn’t release the wrist.
The words were cruel, but the man was still acting as if they were discussing the weather.
They kept methodically going through the room. They were obviously well versed in this. Get in, grab the goods, get out. Take the goods and lock them away so you can fuck them in peace.
“Relax, would you? He’s not here now. Besides, it’s always the Alphas who have the goods.”
He went and sat down on the opposite wall from him. A careful distance away from the mattress.
“I was just - cleaning up - fixing the window upstairs," Steve told the floorboards. "I’ll take the - the bodies out at sunrise. Try to get some sleep now. We’ll talk tomorrow. And - Tony - don’t - “
“Steve… you - you
Sometimes he would hear faint sobbing coming from the other side of the room, and he would crush the pillow over his ear and refuse to feel Steve’s pain.
“About - about yesterday. I’m sorry I wasn’t here.”
He barely said a word to Tony. Their sparse exchanges were contained to topics of survival. Food, shelter, water, security. Steve kept him updated on their resources and reassured him of their safety. Tony nodded and didn’t pretend to be reassured.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony carefully folded the letter and placed it back among the yellowed pages. He pressed his fingers against his eyes until the tips turned white.
“I’m Steve, by the way. Steve Rogers.” His back was no longer to the sun, and his features became more visible. He was smiling softly. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. I keep forgetting things are different now, and you can’t just come up to people without getting stabbed or making them faint. Not that I thought you’d faint - still, it was rude of me.”
He wondered if it missed human touch, locked in that dark room.
“-ny. Hey, Tony. Look at me. Tony, look at me.”
He followed.
And that just begged the question:
“I hope you die in there like the monster you are.”
Instead of drawing his restrained hand back towards himself, Tony
“I guess I envy you. You having someone like Steve by your side. He is completely batshit, mind you, but he’s here, and be will never leave you. Even if you already left.”
realize on some level - ”
Steve stepped back quickly, alert and poised like a cat. He was leaning slightly forward, his body no longer that of a harmless man.
“Don’t go yet. Please don’t. Peggy, don’t go. Don’t leave me alone here. Please.”
“Yes? Can I help you?”
“Why? Do you want to know if experiment 2.0 was successful?”
The younger one moved towards the cloth covered table and grabbed at the dark fabric. It slid heavily towards the floor, revealing the strange shape that had caught Tony’s eye days before. Almost despite himself, he leaned over to see what was underneath, and his eye caught on a glint of silver.
“Was that it? Is that why you brought me here? You think just because I used to be a Stark I deserve whatever happens to me?”
When he woke up the sun was high up in the sky. He wasn’t sure if it had been hours or days.
Tony reached out tentatively and rested a hand on his right shoulder.
“Did you see what he did to those men?”
Tony felt Steve’s hand tightening on his shirt and remembered drowning, alone in a cold cave.
Smooth lines blended into a prosthetic years beyond anything Tony had ever seen outside of his own lab. The metal plates fit seamlessly, creating the impression of muscle and sinew
The light was slowly dying. He shivered.
His chances of getting himself killed had dramatically diminished now that the sun was up, so Tony allowed himself to calm down.
There was only one table, near a window covered in a material that looked so dense it might have been metal.
Tony startled. Steve was eerily silent when he moved. After their odd little talk more than a week ago, there had been an awkward tension surrounding every interaction. Like Steve was almost scared of him, and Tony felt wary of any sudden shift Steve’s emotional state might undergo. He felt almost certain now that he didn’t have anything to actively fear from Steve, the keyword of that sentence being “actively”. Steve was like a moving shadow at the periphery of his vision. Who knew what it would materialize into.
Steve looked at him a beat longer, seeming to weigh Tony’s sudden calm. Or his own resolve.
Tony woke to the sound of stone scraping against stone.
“Hey. It’s - it’s me. I just wanted to say thanks. For taking care of things earlier. And for not attacking me. So yeah. Thanks.”
“I’m sorry, Tony. I really am.”
“I don’t - I didn’t expect him to react like that. He must have seen me as a threat now because of your proximity. I didn’t think - I didn’t realize the instinct would run so deep. He’s not that kind of man.”
“Why are you sorry?”
Tony took them wordlessly.
“Don’t you fucking dare, you fucking coward! You are the one who got me into this, with your lost fucking love and your fucking misplaced ideals. And now you expect me to sit around and wait to be picked up by the nearest gang of hormone-run scavengers or hunted like a rabbit, while YOU go mope on a bridge and cry about how terrible the world is?”
He walked up the stairs backwards, one step at a time, keeping up a firm and constant pressure on the wrist in his hand. He could feel the blood pulsing gently beneath the skin.
“Don’t take it as a compliment. Right now it’s between you and whichever Alpha gang lurks around. You can bet our visitors yesterday have friends nearby. Friends who will get curious about their whereabouts very soon.”
He kept pacing the room. Back and forth, back and forth. For a split second after each turn back towards him, Tony could have sworn he saw Steve’s lips move soundlessly. Minutes passed before he managed to spit it out.
“I always forget how fucking useless you Betas are. Fucking clueless even when it’s right under - “
“I didn’t mean - I’m not throwing you out! You can stay here as long as you want. Just - he is more dangerous - more than I thought he would be, and - I wanted you to know you can - should leave if - if you want to.”
Pages and screens flickered in front of his eyes like roll film, the words neatly arranging in his mind.
Tony’s anger flared again.
he was. His blond hair was greasy but it had obviously been washed fairly recently. His clothes were shabby, patched and sweat stained, but they weren’t dirty. His teeth still looked healthy and white.
Brickface held Tony by the throat and leaned forward.
Steve had seemed more present during his little tactical speech than during the whole time Tony had known him.
Tony sat back down. The man’s hand was resting limply on the edge of the tub, and Tony covered his fingers with his own.
THUMP.
The silence felt soothing now. No pity or judgement, only the emptiness of his loss echoed back at him.
No voice answered him.
Tony turned towards the man before him, letting himself see him.
Steve turned halfway but still wouldn’t look at him.
Coming near him with a blade or scissors would be suicide. So he gently grasped the edge of the torn shirt and waited another second.
He sat heavily down on the mattress. He knew he should be glad for regaining his awareness, but sometimes he missed the blanket of numbness. His chest hurt, and he wrapped his arms around himself and held tightly until the tears came again. Heavy sobs that constricted his ribcage.
"You stay right here and wait for me, sweetheart. Nice and quiet."
Tony scrambled off the mattress.
Tony raised his head from the dark waves of panic and tried to breathe.
The sleeve falling down from the pool of blood was empty and torn, contrasting sharply with the bulging muscle of its right arm.
“Jesus, Matt, if you wanted someone to fuck we could have found something somewhere other than an Alpha-stinking hole.” The third man was leaning against the opposite wall, scratching absently at a ginger beard that barely masked his pockmarked face.
A hand grabbed his shoulder suddenly. Too suddenly. Tony jerked back and choked on a scream, his exhausted heart giving another painful constriction.
Tony turned around and fixed him with an incredulous stare.
Ok. Hierarchy of needs. Food. He should definitely feed him.
overpower him.
“Look, the sun is setting. I can’t in good conscience just leave you here, I think it’s obvious why. I realise there’s no reason to trust me whatsoever, but I swear I won’t touch you.
His dog tags made a soft sound as he shifted his body more towards the window. Tony watched him as he enfolded them in one hand, his fingers absently stroking the metal. He saw it then, as if it was now bathed in the morning light.
“Just shut up and move, Jake,” a third voice snapped.
Tony laughed.
The Alpha’s eyes kept coming back every few minutes to rest on Tony as if drawn by a magnet. Tony could guess at what images were playing behind them.
“I’m not taking on more step in that direction. Are you seriously telling me it’s safe? That you know it? That it’s your pet and you’re all friendly?”
Steve was completely unbothered by the smell permeating the tunnel. He kept walking slowly ahead, as if… as if he was used to it. As if he knew exactly what…
He knew instinctively Steve didn’t mean the intruders. Anger pooled at the back of his throat and tasted like venom.
“I’m not going as far without you this time. I will be able to smell the coming.”
The repetitive movements lulled him back into a more reasonable heart rate. He carefully went over his chest and back, the length of his arm, his fingers.
Behind his eyelids, the red glare of the setting sun turned dark. The voice sounded closer.
“Tony, there’s nothing to fear. Please, come with me.”
“Okay, Tony. Now listen. I promised I won’t hurt you and I’ll keep my word. I’ll take you to a safe place. There’s no need to panic.”
Tony smiled sadly.
Steve tensed.
It had all been gathering inside his head, the hours upon hours of fear and shock, and it was now beginning to overflow. He wasn’t sure how much more he could take, so he quickly took hold of the waist of his sweatpants and pulled them down before he had a chance to think any longer about any of this.
“It’s okay. We’re okay. Just - just let go. Just let me go.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered after a beat.
There was a strange quality to Steve’s voice. He sounded far away and not entirely aware Tony was even listening. He was still looking at the sunrise.
Obviously, the man didn’t move an inch. Tony looked his way again and this time forced himself to maintain eye contact. He was standing between Tony and the setting sun, so his features were hard to distinguish. The huge bulk of his body was not.
But no, that wasn’t right. Steve loved him. Steve would never have hurt him.
Love,
“Goddammit,” he muttered. “God. Fucking. Dammit.”
“Will I wake up in that cell?”
He didn’t so much as twitch a muscle. His body couldn’t afford the extra energy. Only his heart jerked wildly in his chest, beating a wild staccato. He closed his eyes.
“That was the plan. So if you wouldn’t mind, I’d rather do it in peace”.
Tony made an effort to breathe slowly.
He took a step closer and waited for a reaction. When none was forthcoming, he continued, the words more a comfort to him than anyone else.
“Jesus Christ, Matt, I swear even I can almost smell it. Whose fucking brilliant idea was it to pick this one?”
“Only one of them was an Alpha. Broke his nose and that took care of it. The others were scared shitless but couldn’t pinpoint why. So I guess the thought of scavenging around here was enough to convince them to stick around.”
Tony needed 5 full seconds of mental coaching before he gathered the will to move a muscle. He got to his feet with all the grace of a centenarian.
He could imagine him at that moment as the man Steve was so determined to see him as. The man he had loved.
Steve was still staring at him, his gaze turning anguished. He reached out and very lightly pressed the back of his fingers against Tony’s cheek.
But going with this stranger…
After what felt like years, a metallic screech pierced through.
He had the bearing of a soldier.
It opened with the same metallic screech like always. When the smell and the fear came, Tony thought of cinnamon and embers. When a body took form out of the darkness and came towards him, Tony refused to step back and close his eyes. He extended his right arm and pressed his palm against a heaving chest. Only the barest pressure of his fingers and it stopped advancing.
The last sentence held the lilt of a question. But only silence followed, and words kept pouring out of him like poison from a wound.
“Yes.”
“Hello.”
Steve always came back minutes before the sunset. It always made Tony restless, and he wondered every day whether Steve would make it. Some days he was afraid he wouldn’t, and he would be left alone. Other days he wished for him to never return.
that was hours from now. Hours he didn’t have.
“Shh. It’s okay.” he murmured soothingly.
“Ok. Ok, common. Let’s sit down.”
Tony found the piece of yellowed paper pressed between two of its pages. He carefully unfolded it, the texture fragile like a membrane.
He sometimes brought back food, other times clothes, other times nothing but a quiet exhaustion.
One day he would explain about field effect transistors. Another day he would practice his French. Another day he would talk of Pepper again.
it said.
“And I’m supposed to believe you’d be better?”
“Why is Steve this invested in you anyway?” the words spilled out of him, almost too loud in the darkness. “I mean I get the whole long-lost love and eternal devotion thing. But keeping you locked up in his basement
Some nights he woke to the echo of a scream and wasn’t sure who it belonged to.
“He’s not a monster”
“I’m sorry I put you through all this, Tony, I really am. But I would do it all over again and I will probably keep doing it. Because there is nothing in this world that means anything to me anymore. Before there had always been a battle and people who needed me, but now everything I can save is an old ruin. It’s like everything faded. I’m not sure if it’s my memory or my eyes or just my hope. But the only things I see are him and the dust. And If I do lose him, nothing will remain.”
----------
But, for the space of a breath, Tony had seen his eyes, that luminous blue, meet his own.
-----------
Then Steve came down the stairs, and Tony realised just how terrified he had been of being left alone. The relief slammed into him so forcefully his knees trembled.
-----------
There was nothing in the bathroom. Nothing he could use. Not even a fucking razor. What the fuck did Steve even shave with?
them. They weren’t looking for a cure. But
Nothing. He was still swaying slightly, in time with his heartbeat.
Tony swallowed. He let his eyes fall from the piercing gaze of the stranger before him, and looked around. He watched the dying light for a few seconds.
Steve’s harsh breathing and his body slumping in exhaustion against the metal frame.
so unbelievably calm that Tony wanted to claw his eyes out.
with both hands until his captive fingers were only inches away from the Alpha’s face. Slowly, he stretched his fingers back until he could feel the warmth of his breath. Tony waited another second, then dissolved that last bit of distance, the backs of his fingers catching on the tender skin of his lips.
The table was partially covered by a piece of dark cloth, which instantly caught Tony’s eye since it was the only object in the entire space which looked even vaguely untidy. It looked like it had been haphazardly thrown over a misshapen lump cluttering the table. Tony couldn’t see what it was from that angle, but he caught a glint of metal in the shadowed electrical light.
He didn’t wait for Steve to come back down. He just curled up on the mattress wrapped in one of their few blankets and ignored the disarray all around him. He would clean up tomorrow. He would figure out what to do next. He would deal with Steve. He would stop cowering like a weakling and keep surviving. Not just for himself.
Another candle. The soft light made Steve's face look like marble.
Tony’s mind stumbled at the sight, taking a moment to process what he was seeing.
A slightly hysterical laugh escaped Tony’s open mouth.
When he walked out of the bathroom, Steve was sitting next to a window. The shutters had been pulled up, and a soft sunrise was beginning to bloom on the horizon.
He tried to make another run for it, making a wild approximation of Steve’s position in the dark and darting past him. All he got for his troubles was a hand clamping inexorably on his arm.
Tony kept his eyes on the steps - partly because after everything he had been through he refused to die of a broken neck - but mostly because he couldn’t bear looking at him. He raised his head only when they reached the top.
Tony took a deep breath. Another. “Ok. It’s okay. We’re good.”
The fabric was bunched up underneath his armpits now. Tony held the shirt up with one hand, while he ran the other down the length of his only arm until he reached the elbow. He gently guided the arm upwards until it was extended up above his head. His eyes were still not on Tony, stuck somewhere in the middle distance.
Continuous, rhythmical, terrifying.
He shakily got up on his feet. The lowered position suddenly seemed too vulnerable. He savagely wished for the thousandth time for the burn of alcohol to wipe away his thoughts.
“You were in love with him.”
Tony startled awake. The amber light of sunset was spilling into the room as he looked around, unsure what had pulled him from sleep. Then he heard it.
him, in deep lungfuls of air.
Tony jumped right over the implication that a
was going to snap.
Nonetheless, it felt disturbingly safe. They hadn’t figured out a new place to move to just yet and the looming threat was still ever present, but for now they were orbiting around one another in a precarious balance.
He barely saw Steve after that day. He would wake up each morning before Tony, before dawn, quietly dress, press the few buttons which pulled up the shutters on the windows and walk downstairs. The metal door would open and then close. Half an hour later, twin metallic screeches would sound again.
“There’s no need to panic?
“You did choose, Tony.” Steve enunciated slowly. “And I need you to come with me.”
He seemed genuine. But axe murderers were supposed to seem genuine too. On the other hand, what would have stopped him from simply picking him up and carrying him away? There was no need for this long debate about the virtues of being the sex slave of one man instead of ten.
Beneath the dark hollowness of his eyes and the overgrown beard hiding most of his face, Tony could make out pale, smooth skin. His eyes were a deep dark blue, and Tony could imagine how luminous they would have been if not marred by pain and insanity.
His voice had risen to a shout, and Steve’s eyes finally shot to his.
Steve was nowhere to be found.
go. I take it you’re done with me now? You’ve tried me out so now you’re gonna throw me away like a chewed up toy?”
“Is that an invitation? Or are you planning on more experiments? Is that what happens now?”
He often thought about his arms enveloping a warm and trembling body, an agonised whimper reverberating through his own chest.
“How did they not smell him?”
He made an effort to look. The most striking thing about Steve, other than the sheer size of him, was how
It moved towards him in a slow and measured step. Tony thought of the black panthers prowling in the night.
He had a moment’s spike of panic every time Steve shifted, aware of all the other uses he might find for him now that his function as a sedative had proved ineffective. While the creature downstairs instilled a primal terror in his very bones, Steve scared him in the way someone fears the depth of a frozen lake. His words earlier had been both baffling and terrifying. He could see now the deathly grip Steve had on his own sanity, and how tenuous that grip was.
When its arm rose again, Tony pressed back into the wall and tried to dodge to the left. But his muscles barely registered the signal to
“Believe me, Steve. You not being here yesterday is the least you have to apologise for.”
… Get away from me. Why did you bring me here? And where is it? I can smell it. WHERE THE FUCK IS IT.”
“What the actual fuck - Matt, is this - fucking Christ! It’s a metal arm!”
Steve looked at him a few seconds more, then turned his head back towards the door.
Something cracked nearby.
Steve was staring at him now.
Before he could take another step, the man’s eyes flickered. It was the barest movement, a candle flame trembling in the wind. It was so sudden and brief that he wasn’t sure if it had actually happened. When he looked back, the man’s eyes were again on the gently sloshing water.
“I need to - I need to go - I’ll be back soon. I just need to - “
“Tony. I’m glad to have met you though. I know it’s dangerous running into people, but I can’t help but be happy to see someone else survived.”
He was staring absently into the water, the husk of a man long gone, his arm like a band of steel.
Tony sighed. “You’re an idiot, Steve. And I’m the bigger idiot for believing you. But ok. Ok - you’re right. We do need to move. So just go do your thing.“
“Of course not. Captain America died a long time ago.”
Tony shrugged.
Thank you so much for bearing with me for what it has now been years. I am still shocked so many people actually care about whatever words I manage to scrape together. Every time I remember this story and all the people that were kind enough to read it, I am filled with joy.
“I still don’t think - “
Instead, he grabbed at the lock and lifted.
Steve moved around and inspected all the covered windows, then disappeared up the stairs for a few minutes. He returned and began lighting a few candles which he carefully placed on windowsills and next to the mattress. None on the table.
He stopped a few feet away from the door and stood there, frozen, for thirty-nine breaths. When he finally spoke, the sound of his own voice made him startle.
“You a Captain America fanboy? Wouldn’t have seen it coming.”
After the barest second of contact, he snatched his hand away and exhaled roughly, his eyes closing.
Love, Maya
“There’s someone else here -” he managed to choke out. “What - You...” He felt his voice fading in the path of his panic so he struggled to take another breath.
Without the blurring edge of panic and adrenaline clouding his mind, Tony could
The floor was soaked in blood. Tony tried to keep the flashlight away from where he thought the bodies had been, but rivulets of clothed blood were running beneath his feet everywhere he stepped. The smell of feral seemed even more overwhelming now, mixed in with decay.
“Tony. Calm down, please.” His voice was
“They’re beautiful.”
“It’s safe here. You can - you can stay for a while.”
Someone was inside.
“No, I’m the one who crashed the lightbulb. It was dark the whole time.”
But now he closed his eyes and tried very hard not to think about anything at all.
it whispered wetly on Tony’s skin.
“It’s his name. Well, that’s what people called him. James Buchanan Barnes.”
The heavy hand lifted off of Tony’s neck. He felt himself slip down until his knees hit the wooden floor. The sharp pain felt distant, a numbness spreading through him from the places the Alpha’s skin had touched his.
Once again, thank you for not giving up on me.
“I know. But I figured I should start somewhere. And it’s something I’m truly sorry for.”
His fingers skimmed over the wrist, the touch a shocking warmth against his fingertips.

The continuous, rhythmical, terrifying noise.
He slowly walked up the stairs. He had a slight limp.
The stairs creaked faintly with every step.
Steve huffed.
“It’s okay. Tony, it’s okay. It’s me.”
. Do you think I can’t smell it? What the fuck are you on? This whole fucking tunnel smells like feral Alpha and we’re going
“That’s not what I - Do you always keep it locked up in that room?”
THUMP.

Why do you even deserve a second chance when everyone else in this godforsaken place had to go on by themselves or be left behind? What makes
He was already moving towards the basement when Tony jumped to his feet.
When he came out the room was empty.
“I’m sorry, Tony. I really am.”
Both of which Tony desperately needed, especially in his state. And he couldn’t afford to be selfish, not now.
“Ok. Let’s try that.”
Steve startled. He looked at him with an intensity that would have been intimidating had Tony not been at the end of his fucking rope.
Tony’s eyes watered from the sudden light, but he forced himself to look anyway. He didn’t answer.
“You’ve lost someone you loved. I know - I know how that feels.”
“They - at first I wasn’t sure what they were. I couldn’t tell - if they were human bodies.”
The man - Steve slid down the wall and settled there, his shoulders curled in, his head a bit bowed, his hands resting on his knees. All he was missing was a cardboard sign saying I AM NOT A THREAT.
Steve nodded and stood up. He had been crouched with his back to a near wall.
Tony looked at him and thought back to the moment he had just witnessed. He felt like he was perched on the edge of a cliff. But, almost despite himself, he took a step.
Alpha.
“Don’t go down there again. Not - not for a while.”
“It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay."
They were walking down a deserted underground tunnel. Tony wasn’t sure if the fact that it was deserted was working for or against his sanity.
In the next moment, it moved.
The smell hit him next. The stench was so overpowering he nearly doubled over. The acrid smell of sweat and blood was wrapped in something far shaper, a red jagged smear of poison that screamed at him
The voice was tentative.
Then he came towards him, and Tony made the conscious decision to stand his ground. But Steve stopped an arm’s length away from him, his gaze unwavering, and offered him the bag.
The grip was firm around Tony’s left wrist. Unyielding. He began to feel cold.
When he could breathe again, he opened the bag.
When he reached the door, he pressed his palm against it for long minutes.
The admission seemed to be torn out of him, and Tony began to realize how much Steve had really thought his little crazy experiment would work. Or maybe he hadn’t even
“What happened?”
He kept his grip incredibly gentle, and slowly wrapped his free fingers around the Alpha's wrist. When he tugged, with the same force he would have used to nudge a bird, the fingers wrapped around him released and hung limply.
Still. The way he was telegraphing his intentions was so
Articles, books, news, all useless to him now.
The darkness upstairs was so deep, Tony had the disconcerting feeling that he had actually walked further down, burying himself beneath the ground. Steve’s steps had been too quiet to follow, so he just stood there at the top of the stairs and waited.
“Uhm. Tony.”
He staggered out into the light, Steve’s hand on his elbow.
Love,
Where
That was Steve’s voice. He had run into Steve. Steve who was supposed to be
“No, Tony. To tell you the truth I don’t care who you are or what your name is.”
Steve's voice kept splintering, strangled into a visceral ache.
-----------
Tony almost took a step towards the boxes containing their food supplies, but when he looked down and prepared to let him go, the dried streaks of blood running up his only arm gave him pause.
Redbeard rolled his eyes but moved away from the wall.
Tony’s breath shook slightly.
It took shape out of the darkness like a nightmare.
Steve nodded, then hesitated and walked further into the room to kneel down next to a perfectly indistinguishable floorboard. He lifted it up in a practised manoeuvre and rummaged around the hidden space for a second before pulling out a small bag. The floorboard slipped back in seamlessly.
No response.
Someone was inside.
Tony shook his head.
A small huff escaped Steve. He was still looking at the door.
The clothes looked caked in blood and dirt, but the material was still sturdy beneath it all. It didn’t look like fabric left to rot for years, so Steve must have taken better care of him in the past than he currently managed. Tony wondered how abrupt the shift had been, how violent and how quickly he had gotten in order to prompt Steve to lock him up in a basement and go prowling for homemade therapies.
He was curled up against the wall now, watching Steve pace around the ransacked room like a caged lion.
“Not always. But I… I have to.” He said it with the air of a man who admitted the necessity of an amputation.
He could feel the muscle beneath the skin. He would never stand a chance of moving him. So he began gently running his fingers up and down, from wrist to elbow and down again.
The seconds stretch in silence.
“You're pathetic. I know I’ve done nothing but lie on your filthy mattress for God knows how many days, but I think I deserve some time to feel sorry for myself given my current lot in life. And I sure as hell won’t spend the rest of my days in this hellhole listening to your sob story and dealing with the shitshow in the basement while I wait to die!” He took a breath. “I’ll go wash and pull myself together after the horror show I’ve just witnessed, and when I come out you can either be here to help me figure out how we can survive, or you can go find some rope to hang yourself with. Feel free to dive into the ocean, but I won’t get dragged down with you.”
A crash. Deep voices coming down from upstairs, whispering through the darkness.
Tony heard a sharp intake of breath in the silence. Whatever came after was lost, because the weight on his lap vanished and the quiet was broken by the sound of two bodies slamming together.
“We’re good. You’re good. It’s okay. Come with me.”
Tony gritted his teeth against a wave of burning hatred. He
Brickface straightened up from the boxes he had been scavenging, and his eyes again fell on Tony. His thin lips twitched into an oily smile Tony knew too well.
was lurking here in the dark.
“I’ll be back. I just need to go for a bit - “
That pushed him over the edge.
“She was one of the first people to get infected. Nobody knew what it was back then. She just came home one day and collapsed in my arms. I was so busy scrambling to save her and reverse engineer the strain killing her that I didn’t realise what was happening outside, how quickly it was mutating. Two weeks later she slipped away, and I woke up to a world on fire.”
"I do realize how this will sound, but do you want to come with me? ”
He realised it was the first time he had touched his skin.
He did smile then. And it was possibly the most human expression Tony had ever seen him wear. A touch embarrassed, a touch nostalgic. It was warm, but it still didn’t manage to thaw the sadness that always enveloped him.
The look the man was giving him now was not cold or angry, but speculative in a way that made him wary. Tony wondered if he could smell the pregnancy on him, and if so, if that was more or less likely to get him hurt. Pregnant omegas gave off a scent which was supposed to engage protective instincts in others, encourage empathy and nurturing. But who knew if such biological mechanisms still had any sway over men hardened by war and loss.
“So. Steve huh. He’s a character, I’ll give him that. Would not have been my first choice of a post-apocalyptic roommate, but beggars can’t be choosers.”
Love,
"Damn, you still got some blood in you. Your Alpha must like you feisty."
can. I can help you find a cure. I’m trained in maths and science and engineering and pretty much any subject other than poetry. I will find something to help him. I can - ”
He looked around again, slower this time. Steve hadn’t left him any weapons, probably afraid Tony might stab him in his sleep. A wave of anger clouded his mind for a second. Steve had just up and disappeared and left him alone in this house defenseless and with no weap-
There was a faint rustling around him, the wind gently shifting through leaves and paper and plastic bags. He was sitting with his back to a brick wall, his body mostly hidden by the trash cluttering the alley he was taking refuge in.
But Steve wouldn’t come back until nightfall. And judging from the light still glaring from the windows
He wasn’t sure if he had fallen asleep at all when Steve’s hushed voice weaved out of the darkness.
The bathroom door slammed open and smashed into the wall.
“You are all in for a treat,” Thor said with a tired smile. “Lady Sif and her friends are a merry group.”
“Back towards the city,” Bucky said.  “It’s going to be damned difficult to find them.”
“My friend!” she cried. “It has been too long.”
“And this ancient scientists works are worth killing for?” Steven asked.  He didn’t ask who Mr. Banner was, even though it killed him not to.
Tony had listened with a growing sense of disbelief at the the fairy tales woven by Ross and his compatriots.  He’d had a feeling it would go down like this even before entering the chambers--it was hard to get to the truth when over half of the major players weren’t interviewed.
"Indeed," Lady Oxford said.  "How nice."  She turned back to Lady Frigga, making it quite clear that Steven no longer mattered.
“Do you think there really is some sort of dangerous knowledge hidden in the tablets,” Steven asked Tony.
"You sound just like Loki and my husband," Lady Frigga said.
“Yes sir,” Captain Rogers said, taking a deep breath and squaring his shoulders.  “If you’ll help, I think we’re all ready to start making things right.”
"When is your last date?" Jarvis asked.
“Loki's father isn’t important enough to matter to them,” Thor said.  “I have to go after him.”
“Yes,” Samson confirmed.  “The Binary Augmented Retro Framing, or B.A.R.F. technology.”
Steve hadn’t shared how he personally planned to make amends, though Natasha seemed to have some idea (thus the arguing).  He had said that they were to start at the farm and work their way from their, trying to find who had taken Clint’s family.  Barney was waiting for them on the ground with whatever he had been able to discover during their flight in.
He’d only wanted to cheer Steve up.  He’d looked for people who stood behind Cap and were willing to take a stand for what was right.  And sure, those people were on there, and some of them were nice, normal, seemingly sane people who trusted in Cap to make good decisions.  But there were also the people who backed Cap up because ‘no damned dirty foreigner is going to tell Captain ‘Murica what to do’.  Sam didn’t think Cap would want to see those.
"Ah well," Lady Oxford said.  "You may be safer staying away.  Bolton and his cronies can be ruthless players, and they only play for high stakes."
Her face relaxed just a bit.  “I know, James.  But you have to admit that you and trouble have been good friends these long years.”
A hologram popped up in front of him.
Jarvis's face contorted in distaste.  "I'm sure we can come up with something better than a smelly horse and cart," he said.  "You can come and work with me."
"Why isn’t Steve on crotchless panties?" Darcy asked. "I'd buy those."
In the wake of the revelation at the carnival, Philip was at a loss for how to deal with a moping Steven.  The young man spent the next few days wandering around the Natural Science museum, lingering over magnificent specimens and filling his sketchbook.  Philip followed him, worried at how listless and quiet his young charge seemed.  While he was glad that any burgeoning relationship between Steven and the Stark boy had been nipped in the bud, he hated to see Steven so sad.  Sarah Rogers had wanted Steven to settle down, not break his spirit.
Either way, Brucie-bear’s lingering trust in Tony warmed what little was left of his heart.  He didn’t know if Bruce knew the whole story, though.  He doubted it, if he was sending word to Tony and not Natasha or Steve.  Tony wanted nothing to do with it, but as a favor to Bruce, he would make sure that the information got to Wakanda.  Maybe it was time to book a meeting with the King.
Lion Mask and his men entered the room with the scrolls and tablets, and after a few minutes punctuated by the sound of the cage doors swinging open, they returned with the tablets in hand.  They returned to the Great Court, where the rest of the armed cadre still held the attendees at gunpoint.
“Mr. Borson’s family has been most generous,” the curator said, frowning.  “Very well, you may stand over there and sketch while we finish showing the tablet to Lord Oxford.”
“And this is where it gets awkward,” Natasha grumbled, fidgeting in her chair.
Hogun and Fandral split them into two search teams; Hogun took Steven and Thor and Fandral took Bucky and Phillip.  They split at the main junction, with Steve’s group going left and Bucky’s going right.  They searched between the rows, even tapping on some of the boxes that would be large enough to hold a full-grown man.   At the end of the main pathway, a set of stairs led up to what were presumably the quarters and bridge.  Hogun crept up the steps, peering into the dimly lit space, wary of any dangers.
.  On the next morning, he packed up some of his small devices and more obscure tools, keeping anything that he might need in case of a problem with The Great Oracle.
“Boss?” Friday said, dragging Tony from his thoughts.  “Got something for you.”
“For this to work, we must all deal in good faith, and have a common purpose.  And our only purpose should be the protection of innocents from both direct and collateral damages.  The Accords, should they survive in any form, must provide a framework that protects all involved, while acknowledging the mistakes made and find ways to mitigate the risks to the citizens of Earth.”
“Natasha, I’m sorry,” Phil said.  “Trust me, this was not my idea.”
"No.  They will find some way to stop me if I do," Tony said.  "And it will be easier to keep you out of it."
One does not ordinarily realize a lifelong dream at the tender age of twenty three.  But Steven Grant Rogers was no ordinary young man.  His father, God rest his soul, had called him a dreamer and had despaired Steven ever settling down into the family business.  His small group of friends did not understand his fascination with art and history, and teased him for burying his head in paintings and dusty old tomes and papers until the ink was dyed into his fingertips.  The young ladies of his acquaintance sighed at his height, his strong muscles, and his prospects, but they despaired of ever turning his head.
“Just a moment,” the man said.  “I am quite aware of Tony’s past and his circumstances.  More so, I believe, than you.  So do not bother yourself on my account, and leave us be.”
Steven’s shoulders slumped.  “Myself,” he whispered.  “My family, they already have to listen to people gossiping about my scholarly bent, saying that my parents indulged me beyond all reason.  If our circle were to find out that I had other unnatural proclivities...”
Hogun turned away after a quick look and made his way back towards the center of the ship, where they would hopefully find their comrades.  Steven and Thor were not as light on their feet, but they managed to follow him with little effort or noise.  The ‘walls’ around them were not much more than frames with sturdy canvas; Steven supposed a method that tried to offset the weight of the crates below.  It meant that they had to be very quiet, but it also meant that they would be able to hear any conversations, and hopefully hear Loki complaining to his captors.
The frown on Sarah’s face belied her thoughts on Bucky’s likely influence.  “James Buchanan Barnes, if I hear that you have been leading my boy astray…”  The threat was unspoken, but no less terrifying.
"I just wanted to see if they had a cool Hulk shirt," he said, weakly.
When it was all gone, he sat down and made a list of incontrovertible facts in this new reality.
“You’re high profile, kiddo,” Clint had said.  “If they catch you, it’s going to get ugly.”
The door opened again, and Lady Sif returned, followed by three men bearing trays of tea and cakes. They set them upon the desks, and turned to Thor.
“Please do not misunderstand:  I still fully believe in accountability for those who wield powers like my suit or the Super Soldier Serum in Captain America’s blood.  Much is expected of those to whom much is given.  No, my issues stem from the vulnerability of these Accords to manipulation by those with other agendas than protecting the citizens of this world.”
"Hullo sir," he said, jogging up to the fire.
Clint had checked his email with a zealous regularity since receiving they had arrived.  He knew that he couldn’t risk contacting Laura, but that didn’t mean he hadn’t kept an eye on them.  The kids never knew it, but Clint’s brother Barney lived in town.  He’d left the FBI and wanted to settle down, and at Clint’s request had bought a butcher’s shop in the town where Clint and Laura lived.  He kept his distance, not wanting to draw any attention to the little family, but he kept an eye out when Clint was off working.
The man dropped the hookah mouthpiece into his lap.  He dipped his left hand into a small pouch at his waist while his right hand offered a packet of coins to Rahul.  "This should cover your payment plus the refreshments," he said, with a grim smile.  "I must be off to book passage and tie up loose ends here."  He picked up the mouthpiece with his left hand and gave it to Rahul.  "Enjoy."
Maybe he shouldn’t have protected her from that.  If she’d know just how badly he’d been affected, would she have agreed with him going to help Cap?  Probably not, but maybe she’d know that it wasn’t about him not loving her or the kids.  It was about repaying debts.  It was about giving a hand up to someone who had been knocked down too many times by life.  It was about taking his weaknesses and trying to make them stronger, and helping another victim do the same.
"That title died with my father, Thor," Mr. Borson said.  "I have no need of it.  I have my family and that is all I need."  His wife smiled and took his hand in hers.
And it was time he shared his findings.
The taller man, quite the opposite of his friend, shook his head.  "Please excuse Loki," he said.   "I assure you he means no harm, despite his abhorrent manners.  I am Thor, and he is Loki."  He held out his hand.
Hogun chuckled. “I can see why you like them, Thor.”
"They can look at my son all they want," she ranted.  "But no trollop will ever carry the title of Lady Oxford.  I will not stand for it."
Philip would not let the matter go.  "Is this why you have not offered for any of the young women back home?" he asked.  "There are several who have been throwing themselves at you for the past two years.  Good girls, from good families."
"That okay?" he asked, just a hint of uncertainty in his voice.
Steve worried that they wouldn’t be enough.  That someone would go after Tony for the mess that was the Accords, and they wouldn’t be able to stop them.  He should be there.  He should be protecting his former team mate.  His friend.  He’d sent Tony the phone, praying that he would call and tell Steve that he needed him.  That he had forgiven Steve for lying.  But the phone sat there, day after day, doing even less that Steve was.
"Mr. Rogers, how do you find London?" Lady Frigga asked.
"It seems to be a residential ruin, with some intact mosaics and frescoes," Loki said, his eyes glinting with anticipation.  "We shall see," Loki said, shrugging.  "Are you available on Tuesday next?"
“They are amenable to many of the changes that Mr. Stark suggested prior to the events in Germany,” the king said.  “Especially that of making sure that enhanced individuals have representation on the committee.”
T’Challa had provided a relatively secure method of connecting to the internet, promising that they could keep up with the goings on in the world and not have to worry that there was some sort of CSI Cyber bullshit tracking their every move.  Sam figured the only ones who could track them at this point were Stark and his AI, and Stark seemed pretty ready to just write them all off.
“You don’t have to hurry,” Loki said, slightly abashed.  “Please finish your meal.”
Steve stilled.
“Yeah Cap?” Tony called as he stood up from the sofa. He recognized that tone of yell. The combination of abject horror coupled with a good dose of humiliation, rounded out by soupcon of sheer, bloody panic. Something had gone horribly, horribly awry on the internet.
“I will accompany you as well,” T’Challa said.  “I don’t know that I will be of help, but I have other business to attend to at the U.N.”
Bucky rubbed his hands together in glee.  “This is much better than a museum,” he cackled.
"My lady," Loki said.  He dropped a quick kiss on her cheek and handed her the flowers.  "This is Steven Rogers, our American.  He has been joining us on our excursions."
Steven had the grace to blush.  He did not have much experience with the fair sex.  Everyone chalked it up to his being so serious in his studies, but deep down, he had always wondered why his heart never beat faster when one of the eligible ladies his parents paraded in front of him made his pulse leap.
“Why did you return?” Steven asked. “You don’t sound like you have many good memories of your time there.”
“Calm yourself, Stevie,” Bucky said.  “We’re just going in to do a little investigating.  You said that not everyone there is looking to bed the hostesses?” He directed the last to Fandral.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony hurried down the bustling alley, dodging washerwomen and delivery men in a vain attempt to make it back before Obadiah missed him.  He did not want to explain himself and his absence, and he knew that Obie would find some way of dragging the truth out of him if he suspected anything.  And Steven Rogers was a secret he did not intend to share.
"I suppose I do," Steven said.
“There is a new technology that was developed to help trauma survivors go back and observe their memories,” Samson said.  “It hooks up to the hippocampus and creates a link between it and an external framework.  Then the user can reference the memory and the framework to revisit the memory in a palpable way to find a resolution."  He had a distinctly uncomfortable look on his face.  Steve understood immediately.
Whew.  This chapter was a beast to write, even though it's not that long.  I tried to do some research and be as accurate as possible with brain stuff, but at some point you just have to hang a lantern on it, you know?  And yes, what we learn here will have more ramifications than just Bucky.
“This one is from in town near the Avengers facility.  It happened after Steve and his gang left for London.  If she had stepped foot out of the facility, she would have been forced into a confrontation,” Tony said.  “Do you have any idea how that would have ended?  It would have ended with someone dead, and her taking the blame.  You think the Raft is the worst thing that could happen to her?”  Tony paused to take a big breath.  “Should I have talked it out with her?  Sure.  When?  When I was on the plane to my godmother’s funeral?  When I immediately afterward had to try to keep Steve from becoming a fugitive?  If you all could have shown me just the tiniest amount of trust…”
The airship crew lowered a platform to the ground.  Lion Mask handed off the tablets, which were then hoisted up to the ship, along with half of his men.  Steven thanked God that no one else had been killed, though Bucky would have a hell of a headache.
Uh, so.  I totally forgot about this fic.  I would like to take it back up if there is interest.  Have a new chapter to chew on while you decide if you're interested in seeing it go on.
"I could not," Tony said.  "She is yours."  He tried to tamp down the feeling of elation at Jarvis's offer.
Steven took his hand after a slight hesitation.  "Pleased to make your acquaintance," he said.  "My name is Steven."
Once he left that thread, however, he soon discovered a section that he probably should have guessed was there.
“Good afternoon, Steve,” the king said.  “How are you doing?  Is there anything I can get for you?”
The second show went smoothly.  Rumors of the disproven skeptic had filtered throughout the crowd, and the tent was even more packed as people vied to see the Great Oracle.   Herbert, who spent his days looking after the animals, was told that his daughter would marry the son of a wealthy merchant, bringing tears to his practiced eye.  Pepper helped them con a young woman who doubted her lover, and Whitney helped them fool an old tailor.  The crowd was as awed as ever, but Tony could not look at the evening with any sort of pride.
The engine room itself was a mess already. Whoever was in charge of maintaining the machinery was obviously an idiot. Really, it was a miracle the thing managed to get off of the ground at all. It would not take Tony long to render it dead on the ground.
Tony wants to be so much more than he is.
“Friend Thor!” one of the men exclaimed, a giant whose girth was only slightly dwarfed by his height.
Tony stopped to consider that for a moment. Then he shook his head and tried to will away any attempt at an erection. He was fairly certain Steve would not appreciate it. He instead sat down in front of the laptop to see what in the hell Steve was on about. Sure enough, the super soldier’s grinning mug gazed out from a pair of well filled boxer briefs. He glanced up to the web address and sighed.
“Agent Coulson,” he said.  “This is a little unexpected.”
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man: “My last girlfriend was a CEO.  I have standards.  Well, I’ve developed standards.”
They had almost escaped relatively unscathed when two of the armed men appeared at the back, behind the table where Thor and Loki were huddling.  The men grabbed Loki by the shoulders and pushed him towards the platform.  When he struggled, one of the men gave him the same treatment as Bucky, and they had to drag his unconscious form.
The Day Before:
“That’s not true!,” Clint yelled, standing up and clenching his fists.
The man in questions sat in the middle of the room, legs crossed in front of him.  His head dipped down so that his chin rested on his chest, and his hands were clasped in his lap.  He was in a prison jumpsuit and slip-on shoes.  The only movement that the normal human would be able to detect was the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.  But Vision wasn’t human, and he wasn’t normal.  He perceived the Captain’s heart beating and the minute twitches that were ever-present.  The super soldier serum had enhanced Captain Rogers energy levels to the point where it was nearly impossible to stay still, though he was making a good act of it.
“And who might that be,” one of the curators asked.
“You may be facing them from the Raft,” he’d argued.  “Or someplace worse!”
They ended up in what looked like a war room, once they had convinced Lila to go be with her mother for a little while.  The other woman, who had introduced herself as May Parker, Tony’s assistant, brought in a pot of coffee and an attitude that would have scared Fury himself.  She and Rhodey positioned themselves on either side of Tony, with Vision hovering behind him.  Phil sighed internally.  He might have lost any goodwill he had left by bringing Clint, but he owed it to him to at least try to help him reunite with his family.
“Anything else?” Rhodey asked with a snort.
“It’s a noble thought, Captain,” T’Challa said.  “But what of the others?”
"Very true," Tony said.
Hogun stroked his beard, deep in thought. “I might be able to help track the airship in question. Can you give me a better description.”
Once they had that part confirmed, it was relatively easy to deduce the likely suspect.
Vision wanted to enter the chamber.  There were questions he wanted to ask.  But he should not be here, and he would not give anyone ammunition against Mr. Stark.  So he sat.  And watched.  And looked for anything that would give him insight into just what Captain Rogers hoped to get out of this play.
As they neared the center of the ship, they heard a commotion below, back in the cargo section.  Fearing that Bucky and the others had been caught, Steve rushed forward and slid to the floor, trying to get a look down the ladders that ended in the cargo space.  There were armed guards carrying two bundles that squirmed and struggled against their captivity.  Steven prayed that Loki was one of them.
“I’m fine,” the Captain replied.  “How are things going for you?”
Steven sent a slightly panicked look to Philip.  "May I invite my friend Philip?  He's over there skulking about in the shadows."
"My father doesn't quite understand my love of history," Loki confided.  "He's in industry, you know.  With the rising cost of ice harvesting, he's developing better methods of refrigeration.  He's made a fortune."
He knew what King T’Challa had gotten out of it.  The public that had been skewering the king alive for what they perceived as his betrayal were suddenly back on his side.  Instead of a villain, he was again the sympathetic figure, recently orphaned and trying to do the right thing.  He was even able to parlay that sympathy into a softening public opinion of the Winter Soldier.
“If you truly think that, if you think it will put you in a worse position, we won’t do this,” Steve said.  “If it's me, well, maybe I deserve it.  But it’s the only thing I can think of.”  He buried his face in his hands.  “God, I miss Tony,” he mumbled.
Thor placed his hand on Hogun’s arm. “They should come. It is their right.”
“No, no experiment-y,” Rhodey said.  “Can I talk to Helen about this too?”
Steve’s face grew stony.  “Just me.  They were following my orders.  I’ll tell the UN that I lied to them to get them to help me.  Whatever it takes to keep them free.”
The made the rounds as Loki showed off more of his artifacts, and then exited out into the garden.  The space was lovely, and one of the most beautiful traditional English gardens Steven had seen.  There were a few strange blooms here and there, but mostly it was laid out in a vibrant, but familiar, rainbow.
“Well, actually, I was thinking that I could turn myself in to you.  You can tell the United Nations that I brokered a deal with you, Bucky’s safety for my freedom.  Tell them that it was the only way to bring me in with no further casualties.  Tell them that we’ve been in Wakanda making sure he was secure, and that as soon as we were sure, you brought me back here to face justice,” Steve said.
Steven looked away and noticed Baron Hammer smirking at him.  Loki looked ready to commit murder, and Lady Frigga's nostril flared a tiny bit, which Steven took as support for him.
"Pepper said you had Captain America footie pajamas," Steve said, finally looking up at Tony.
“How much of this is trying to make things right with him?” T’Challa asked, not unkindly.  He sat down next to Steve, close enough that their shoulders bumped.
"I'm not sure," Philip said.  "But I think we have lunch plans."
“See, here’s the thing.  I think Bruce would have agreed with a lot of the ideas behind the Accords,” Tony explained.  “Now, he would have balked at the whole Ross bit of it, but that’s because he has developed a fine nose for bullshit.  But he’s like me in that he has a long record of being very aware of the consequences of his actions.”
"As-salaam Alaikum, sahib," Rahul said, with a nod of his head.
He was fairly certain that the fugitives would react to Laura Barton’s disappearance, so he wasn’t surprised at all when Norberto Benitez made contact to let them know that Hawkeye was bringing his compatriots into the US on a cargo plane.  Phil was just glad he’d had enough warning to be able to greet them on the tarmac.  Considering that neither of his former charges were supposed to know he was alive, he wasn’t quite sure how this was going to go.
I am so sorry that it has taken so long to update!  Life has been insane (in a good way--yay new goddaughter!) and I haven't had time to edit.  That being said, this is un-beta'd, so please let me know if you see anything weird/confusing!
As for how he saw himself, Steven knew he would never fit in with his family's circle.  He did not care for politics or business.  He did not care if the cut of his coat was fashionable.  His mother's dinner parties were torture, and he shuddered to think of what happened when he was pressured to ask some unfortunate female to dance.  His head was always somewhere else.  He wanted to see the world.  To see the great cultures that came before, to understand how they viewed the world and how they depicted their lives.
“I will do my best, Mother,” Steve said with a watery smile.
"Their family is quite well off," Mr. Borson said, rubbing his chin.  "And they make a point of letting us know that we're not."

"It's a clepsydra," the man said.  "Egyptian.  They think it's from the 4th century B.C."
“He has worked so hard, both of them have, to do good.  I think he’s finally realized that it doesn’t mean he has to do it alone,” Tony said, shrugging.
Angela R. had worked at a coffee shop near the Triskelion in D.C.  When a piece of one of the helicarriers had crashed into her workplace, she and two others had been trapped for six hours before they were rescued.  She said she was really lucky she was young enough to still be on her parents’ insurance, so she was able to afford the help she needed to deal with the PTSD she was suffering.
“They were already on the jet and airborne before we realized,” Shuri said.
When he clicked through to the forums, that was when it all really started to sink in.  The first thread he clicked on was one arguing that Colonel Rhodes should have been in charge of the Avengers in the first place, not the so-called ‘Captain America’.
"It's lovely," Steven said, leaning in to take a closer look.
“Good.  Gentlemen, pack your gear.  Wheels up in an hour.”
This is what happens when you combine coffee and gelato.  I thought we might need a moment of crack.
"I had not heard of it," Steven said.  "What sort of ruins?"
“And he let her and the kids in?” Captain Rogers asked.
<Friday: Sensors Active:  Stark Manor>>Kitchen> <occupants:  Stark, T.; Parker, M.; Parker, P.> <new occupant: Barton, L.>
Steven found a quiet spot behind a display and leaned against the wall, tipping his head back to rest on the cool stone.  Seeing Tony again had stirred up all of his emotions.  He shouldn’t be so bothered; they had only known each other for a matter of days before Steven found out about Tony’s lies.  But he had felt an immediate kinship with the other man, and he had to admit, an attraction.  He supposed that he looked young and naive, and perhaps he was.  Philip had warned him, but Steven had only seen good in Tony’s smile and his pretty words.
“What about the fire breathing?  I’m not a dragon or that annoying kid that hangs out with Richards,” Rhodey asked.
“So Bruce, he’s stuck.  One hand, he is terrified of hurting someone.  On the other hand, that big heart of his won’t let him not help people.  So he tries to find a place where he can help.  Where he can make up for the destruction that Hulk has caused.  Usually, he thinks that place is as far away from civilization as possible.”
"It is official now," Loki said, throwing an arm around Steven's shoulders.  "You're part of the family.  That means you have to go with us to the exhibition."
Wanda wasn’t saying much.  As the person with the worst PR aside from the Winter Soldier, they had offered to leave her behind in Wakanda.
“Perhaps,” Hogun said, a cryptic smile on his face.  “Or perhaps not.”
Sam closed his browser window, unable to read anything more.  He told himself that these people didn’t know what they were talking about.  That they didn’t know Steve, and what an inspiring leader he was.  But a little voice inside his head asked if he had really questioned Steve’s methods enough.  Was he so used to following orders that he followed the man blindly down an unnecessarily violent and damaging road?
When Steve had introduced him to Rhodey at one of the parties that Tony had thrown at the tower, he had to admit he’d been a little star-struck.  Not as bad as the giddy feelings he’d had when he met Cap, but pretty damned close.  Rhodes had a calm, competent air about him that spoke of experience and loyalty--the ultimate airman, and Sam was constantly reminding himself to stand up straight and look him in the eye.  Until, of course, he heard Rhodes tell Stark to shut the fuck up and hand him another beer.  Just like that, the tension had been broken, and suddenly there was a very real and very approachable man in front of him.
“You cannot help your friend if you are dead,” the owner of the hands whispered.  Steven recognized the voice, even in the din.  Tony.
“It is most interesting,” he said.  “Most of the work is done in scroll form, but there were tablets found as well.  Steven, why did you leave?”
Lila was the first to notice them.  She saw Vision first, and grinned at him.  Then her smile dimmed into confusion when she saw Phil.  When Clint stepped out from behind them, her eyes grew wet with tears.
“Let’s all calm down,” Thor said, laying his hand on Steven’s arm.  “Steven, come along.  We’ll let these gentlemen get back to their studies.”
“You and Loki?” Steven asked, his eyes wide.
He introduced Wilson, Lang, and Maximoff, none of them having heard of him but seeming to understand his importance simply from the reaction of the others.  Only one of their merry group hadn’t come forward, the one he needed to talk to the most.
"There was no way to acquire the tablet," Rahul said, settling in for a long bargaining session.  "I brought you the information to help you get the tablet.  You owe me."
“In 1988, they made an accidental discovery.  One of the techs, a Nikolai Sorokin, made a mistake.  He brought him to the lab too soon after waking him up.  Mr. Barnes’ brain was still hovering between stasis and not.”
He was about to head off to the carnival and track Tony down and demand an explanation when Steven made yet another new friend.  Philip was waiting while Steven sketched a conch shell when he saw two men enter the gallery together, pointing out interesting items and laughing softly together.
“Basically, coming out of cryo-stasis, the brain functions like a computer reboot.  It’s physically resetting and having to bring every system back online,” Samson explained.  “That’s why you have to reboot a computer whenever you add new programs or make operating system updates; the reboot goes back and looks at the code and adjusts its operation based on whatever is stored in its operation code.”
Tony had designed
“I don’t know, Tones.  He runs away rather than taking any sort of accountability,” Rhodey said with a frown.  “Running away isn’t the answer.”
“So,” the man in the mask said. “You must be the golden goose.”
"Of course, m'dear," Mr. Borson said.
“This will be quite helpful,” Hogun said. “If you will excuse me, I will show this to my contacts.” He gave a small bow and left the room.
“Please, have a seat. I will arrange tea,” Lady Sif said, stepping back into the hallway.
Rhodes had taken Sam under his wing, no pun intended.  Sam wouldn’t say they were close, but they had shared many an eye roll when dealing with their respective hard-headed best friends.  Seeing Rhodes on the field that day, with blood and the wrecked suit, had been devastating.  So much so that he didn’t even begrudge the shot that Stark took at him.
Steve grimaced. “I’m coming too,” he said. “Loki is my friend, and I’ll do whatever I have to in order to get him back.”
“So what Hydra found, is that if they could insert the conditioning as the brain was coming back online, they could manually override the existing ‘code’ in Mr. Barnes’ brain.  And then when the brain came fully back online, he was primed for whatever they wanted to do.  They basically took root access to his mind, something they could never do to someone without the serum.”
Steve wasn’t so sure that peace was what he deserved.
"Indeed.  We are the best of friends," Loki said, smiling.
Things are afoot.  Also, the whole Nakia subplot was decided upon before any casting decisions were made for Black Panther.  Great minds think alike?
"Much more intriguing since meeting Loki and your son," Steven admitted.  "They have been quite kind in showing the uncultured American around."
“Yeah, she never lets up on him,” Sam added.  “Seems personal.”
“Either way, it’s done,” Steven said, finally.  “Had he been honest with me, I could accept his ‘profession’.  But he wasn’t.  I would never be sure if he was telling the truth, and he would always remember me accusing him of being a thief.”
“Then we have two goals,” Steven said.  “We need to rescue Loki and stop those men.”
“I know where they are going.  I must do everything I can to keep them from exacerbating the situation, for everyone’s sake,” he said, already ringing for his servants.  His personal jet had most everything he required, but he would need his armor and weapons, which were in his chambers.
His clicked back to the search results and found a veterans forum.  The image on the splash page was Colonel Rhodes in his Air Force uniform.  Sam remembered when he’d first met the man.  Rhodes was a legend in the Air Force, especially among the younger African American members.  No one could say that he hadn't risen to his rank on his own merits and bravery.  And while some folks grumbled underneath their breath about how being the Stark liaison hadn’t hurt either, most people thought that dealing with the younger Stark was enough to have earned Rhodes a couple of stars.
“They want me.  They need someone to blame, and frankly, I’m the one who deserves the bulk of it,” Steve said.  “I should have never put you in the position of risking your nation to protect us.  It was selfish, and no way to repay your kindness.”
Steve thought his face might actually burst.  Bucky looked intrigued, and Philip looked thoughtful.
Breakfast was a scattered affair the next morning. Steven saw a brief glimpse of Tony as he made his way in for coffee, but the engineer left without saying a word. Thor was up and pacing around the small area, setting Steven’s nerves on fire. He managed to still his tongue, however, knowing that his friend was terrified for Loki.
They joined Loki and made a quick trip to the buffet.  They settled around one of the small tables and listened to Loki wax poetic over the scrolls.
Steven sighed. He gave the window one last look and then went to find Bucky and Philip.
Unlike the previous scholarly functions he had attended, there were as many ladies in fashionable evening wear as there were academics and professors.  Loki explained that many of the wealthy families were patrons of the museum, and they attended the premieres of the exhibitions as if they were just another event in the Season.
Loki stopped in front of a series of beds.  He took a pair of garden shears from a bench and knelt down.  He clipped off blooms from a hydrangea bush, and then snipped a handful of purple irises.
“That one,” he said, gesturing at a woman who looked to be in her early thirties.  “She won’t stop staring.  I knew I should have gone to a tailor.”
“This is from T’Challa.  It has information on it that might help you track down the people that bombed your tower,” Phil explained.
“Fair enough.  I know we’ve put you in an untenable spot.  If we’d known more about the situation here, we might have been able to stay put, but Clint, he…  his wife.  His children.  They protected us when they didn’t have to, and we couldn’t sit by while they were abducted.”
"What about Thor?" Darcy asked.
"Thor's mother is the younger sister of the Marquess of Southampton," Loki explained.
And now Tony was here with that other man.  A man, Steven had to admit, who was handsome, and seemed quite protective of Tony.  A man who spoke as if he came from an educated family, at least, and possibly one of some circumstance.  A man who hadn’t appeared to be concerned with Tony’s activities.  Someone Tony could talk to and be honest with.  Steven closed his eyes and banged his head against the wall.
“Bring it up.”
"He is too kind," Steven said, trying to will away the blush he was certain covered his cheeks.  "Where is he?"
“The carts.  Which way did they go?” Steven asked, desperate to cling to any sliver of hope.
"Not a bit," Tony said.  "It will be his own fault when I finally make a break of it."
“We have to wait for the others.  Hopefully Tony has finished disabling the ship,” he whispered.  Just then, a sharp whistle caught their attention.  Hogun looked outside and nodded when he caught sight of Fandral and their friends crouched near a stack of crates.  He turned to motion them forward when the first explosion occurred.
But there were no noises coming from the rooms.  In fact, aside from the two men on the bridge, they hadn’t really seen anyone since boarding the ship.  That fact alone was enough to worry Steven.  Surely they wouldn’t leave the ship unless there was nothing to guard anymore?
"Because let me tell you, nothing would inspire me when I was kneeling down in front of a guy like seeing your face in front of me," Tony said, suddenly feeling a little reckless.
“She is currently on a quinjet out of Wakanda, with all of her friends,” Shuri said.
Their discussion had reached a volume that other people in the room took notice.  Most especially, Tony and his friend turned around.  For one brief moment, Tony smiled in delight, but when he saw Steven’s countenance, his expression shut down and he leaned over to say something to his companion.
"We shall take our leave, then," Loki said, rising to his feet.
“Your machines are amazing,” Steven said. “The one that we saw at the carnival, even if I disagreed with the purpose, was elegant. You could see the care that went into crafting it.”
"Hammer," Loki said.  His jaw was rigid and Steven noticed how white his knuckles appeared.  "Lady Oxford.  You are as lovely as ever."
"Mr. Stark," Philip said, returning the handshake.
Mr. Banner was waiting for him, already attired in his evening dress.  Tony had no appropriate clothes of his own, but Mr. Banner had offered to lend him attire.  Tony changed into borrowed finery, and the two men grabbed a steam coach to the museum.
“Have faith, Steven,” Thor said, patting him on the shoulder.  “Remember that they took two bundles from the ship.  Perhaps your Tony was simply caught.  If he is still alive, we may yet find him.  And Loki.”
He had to step into an alcove only once, when he heard a couple of crewmen climbing up the ladder he needed to go down. He managed to stay perfectly still and in shadow until they passed. He waited until their voices faded before he quickly climbed down the wooden ladder.
“Indeed,” Thor said.  “We have been close since we were in school.  We were both miserable there, both outcasts.  We found comfort in each other.”
“Most of them are delightful,” Fandral said, grinning.  “It is a place where the rich and the educated meet.  You’ll see politicians, nobility, financiers, those sorts.  It’s set up as a Grecian temple, although all of the rooms have a special theme--quite decadent.”  He leered at them and waggled his eyebrows.
“Steve, you can’t keep going on like this,” Natasha said.  She scooted her chair closer to him and took his hand.  “You drift around here and I can’t tell if you’re mourning Bucky or Stark.  It’s eating you alive and it’s killing us to see it.  You deserve some peace of mind too.”
The Borson household was run with a gentle, but firm hand.  The servants, what few Steven saw, were both cheerful and respectfully affectionate towards the family.  Heimdall, the butler, greeted them at the front door.  He took their coats and hats, and led them to a small parlor where they found Lady Frigga and her maid.
“You will have to make do with sketches,” Thor said.
“Steven, you know how to act in polite society,” Bucky said.  “All of those parties your mother dragged you to back in New York.  You’ll be fine.”
"Wa-Alaikum As-salaam," the man replied.  "Do you have news?"
"What’s the matter?" he asked, entering the kitchen.
“Email to your private account, boss,” Friday replied.
“No fire, promise,” Tony said, making an ‘X’ over his heart.  “But I could probably program in some bitching powers, if you’re feeling all experiment-y.”
BFF Hijinks.  Never read the comments on the internet.
“They may,” Tony said, shaking his head.  “But Mr. Banner and I have found no schematics to speak of, and no one has managed to decipher enough of the writings to say one way or the other.”
"Wonderful," Loki cheered.  "Now, what trouble can we get into in the mean time?"
“I come bearing information that might be of use to you,” Coulson said.
“Mad men, apparently,” Steven said with a chuckle.
“Won’t she be keeping a low profile?”
“When they originally put him in cryo-stasis, it was to preserve his body while they conducted more research.  The went through dozens of test subjects, trying to find a more efficient method of controlling him, one that did not rely upon damaging tissue that would ultimately heal and undo their work.  When they had any sort of promising result, they would bring him out of cryo-stasis and try it out.  Ultimately, it would fail, and they’d put him back under.”
“It will not be easy,” Hogun warned. “They are settled some distance from the other ships, with little cover around them. A small group, though, maybe.”
Wallis broke up the uncomfortable silence by returning with tea.  She placed it in front of Lady Frigga, who poured out for all of her guests.  Steven took the delicate cup into his large hands, and was reminded of playing tea with one of his cousins and her child-sized tea set.  Loki handed him a cake and they concentrated on the excellent pastry as opposed to the rude guests.
Just outside of the exhibition, one of the armed men brought the curator to Lion Mask.  The armed man demanded that the curator turn over the keys, but the curator refused.  Lion Mask pulled out a pistol and shot the curator between the eyes, causing several of the women to scream, and others to weep uncontrollably.  Lion Mask dug inside of the man’s jacket until he pulled out a familiar key ring.  He led his men into the exhibition just as Tony and Steven settled behind a sarcophagus.
“Yeah, but maybe we should have let Tony try,” Clint said.  “I can’t believe he would try to hurt us, not really.  Even in Leipzig, you have to admit that his people weren’t there to kill us, they were just trying to stop us.  We were the ones that went for the killing blows.   I mean hell, do you realize how easy it would have been for Scott to kill one of them when he went big?  We let the mission mean more than our friends.”
The day after the bombing, Barney had written that someone was casing the farm.  Less than twelve hours later, he emailed in a panic, saying that Laura and the kids were gone.  Clint had been ready to leave at that moment, but Natasha had insisted that they all sit down and plan.
“Not exactly,” she explained.  “It is more of a combination of that and a gentlemen’s club.  Not all of their hostesses are in the trade.  Some are merely decoration.  Some have...well, other talents”.
“Well, first off, they didn’t have Friday keeping an eye on things,” Tony said.
Tony found Jarvis sitting outside of the ship in a folding chair reading the paper.  His assistant, Parker, was preparing tea over a small fire, humming to himself.  Tony couldn't help the enormous grin that broke out on his face.
“Sir, I’m merely an interested viewer,” Steven explained.  “And a bit of an artist.  I am doing the sketch as a favor to my host this evening.”
"Me too," Bucky said.
Laura had been adamant about going to Tony, and Phil was surprised to find himself agreeing.  Tony was fiercely protective, especially when it came to kids.  And from Phil’s perspective, Tony needed a soft touch to see him through.  With Pepper out of the picture, he needed a quasi-maternal figure to help him rein in his actions.  Laura, after dealing with Clint’s bullshit for years, would be more than a match for the heroes living under Tony’s roof.
“And Steven, you can rest easier.  The children overheard one of them mention ‘Stark’ as they moved the prisoners,” Hogun said, kindly.  Steven felt the air make its way back into his lungs as he nearly collapsed next to Bucky on a sofa.
Thor launched into the tale of their journey thus far. Steven noticed that Lady Sif, in particular, rolled her eyes at the first mention of Loki, but her mien turned to concern as Thor finished his story.
But as much as he was frustrated with the fugitive Avengers, he would still back his people as much as he could.  He knew that Barney was keeping an eye on Clint’s family, but the elder Barton was kind of an idiot.  So when Phil’s own set of eyes reported that some ex-Hydra goons were seen in the area, he’d taken it upon himself to swoop in.
Tony and his friend joined them.  “Do you have any idea why they might have taken him?” he asked.

Three weeks later, when Tony arrived in his bedroom to find Steve dressed in nothing but a smile and a pair of red crotchless panties with Tony’s face on them, he decided to give Steve full access to Etsy. He would need to replace them once Tony was done with him.
“Lady Sif,” Thor said, hugging her close to him. “It has indeed. And now I come to you in need of your help.”
Lady Frigga's maid went to order their repast while they settled onto the sofas.  Steven had his normal problem of fitting on furniture made for people a foot shorter than he was, but Thor was even taller than Steven and if he fit, Steven could find a way.
The room erupted.  Ross looked like he was about to have a seizure.
Tony’s shoulders went rigid. “I’m aware of what you thought of the purposes of my machine,” he said. “And what you think of me. It would be best to leave it be until we find your friend.” He pulled away from the wall and went to climb up towards the cockpit.
“Steven, that’s Lady Ward.  She’s looking at you because her husband is seventy years old and half your size.  She’s much less worried about the cut of your jacket than what’s underneath it,” Loki said, a smirk dancing over his lips.
When Tony took the podium, he was addressing the delegates from the 111 remaining signatories to the Sokovia Accords.  Since the incident with Zemo, several nations had removed themselves from the deal, some citing their agreement with Captain America’s actions, and some not so much as agreeing with him as disagreeing with the way it was handled.
They had spent the last few days listening as the fact finding panel had made their report on the incident, let by Everett Ross.  Tony had checked, no relation to the Secretary of State, so he probably was just useless, not evil.
Rogers stood up abruptly, sending the chair flying.  “How can they blame him for that?  Dammit!  That was not supposed to happen!”  Vision thought the anger, at least, was real.  He remembered that look of righteous indignation.  Vision observed the elevated pulse and blood pressure, indications of true emotion.
Steven stared at him with confusion and a little bit of awe.  He didn't quite know how to respond.  As if on cue, Steven's stomach rumbled.  "No sir, I have not had lunch."  That seemed to be the only question he could answer at that moment.
Tony, Steven, and their companions prepare to set off after the kidnappers.
In the far corner, two men stood in front of a tablet, one making quick sketches and the other one explaining something with quick gestures.  Steven gasped as he recognized the second man.  He knew the worn hands and the strong shoulders because he had first seen them in this very museum.  It was Tony.
To be honest, Clint had been surprised that Steve would leave Bucky in Wakanda, but the man seemed to be more than willing to trust T’Challa’s doctors if it meant getting back to New York to check on their former teammates, and to start to make amends.
Thor gave the driver a set of directions that took them into the city to Right Bank, near the Les Halles market. Philip explained that the red light district was well-regulated in Paris, and most establishments were within a defined neighborhood. They stopped in front of an establishment with a small sign out front that read ‘Le Monde Arborescence’. A tall, striking woman opened the door and threw her arms around Thor.
“Thanks for the vote of confidence, Boss,” Friday piped up.
“That’s good,” the captain said.  “Have you heard anything from Tony’s camp?”  Vision thought that the worry sounded sincere, but then again, the Captain had proven himself quite the actor.
T’Challa watched the fighters in the sacred circle.  The two women circled one another, with weapons drawn.  They were fighting to join the Dora Milaje, the deadly personal bodyguards of the King of Wakanda.  Since his father’s death, T’Challa had been dealing with unrest in his kingdom.  By opening up the ranks to young women from all of the tribes, he hoped to build a coalition that would enable him to keep the peace and help Wakanda prosper.
Thor patted him on the shoulder and then pushed him back into the main space.  Loki had emerged from the scroll room, and was chatting with an older gentleman.  Steven glanced around, but found no sign of Tony or his friend.
“That is not what I asked,” Vision said.  “Unless this information is locked in his brain, in which case I will be more than happy to carve it out.”
"So American," Loki said, settling into a chair.  "What brings you to London?"
“Then you are a fool,” Tony said.  “These men are here for some nefarious purpose, and they do not strike me as men who would hesitate to kill anyone who gets in their way.”
“Get some sleep,” Tony said. “We’ll be in Paris soon enough.” And with two quick steps up, he left.
Steven and Bucky sat across from him, next to Phillip. They had all been surprised when the chaperone had insisted on accompanying them, but he had surprised them by picking up a set of pistols from Odin’s trunk and checking them with practiced ease. Tony had seen the shock on Steven’s face, and had chuckled to himself. At least someone in their little group was prepared.
"Ah, the famed American," Lady Frigga said, beaming.  "Come sit, both of you.  Wallis, can you please ring for tea?"  She handed the maid the bouquet as well.
He was almost surprised by the ringing slap across his face.
The captain of his bodyguards joined him on the dais.  She perched on the arm of his throne and studied the young women with a frown.  She would always find them wanting, because in her opinion, no one was better suited to guard her brother than she herself, Shuri, Princess of Wakanda.
Bucky had the grace to nod his head  vigorously.  “Yes ma’am, Mrs. Rogers.  You know I’d never let anything bad happen to Steve.”
Phil grimaced, and the man next to him flinched.  “Vision, please.”
Tony’s shoulders hunched in defeat.  “I do hope you may someday give the chance to explain,” he said, quietly.  “But no.  More along the lines of weaponry.”
Barton, L. >Designation-Boss Lady: “Good.  That’s sorted.  Friday?  Make a note.”
“You have said that you wish to leave home,” Thor said.  “You wish to travel the world and study.  Surely once you are out from under their constant scrutiny, you can live your life as you wish?”
Vision supposed that was what had prompted Captain Rogers.  By lying through their teeth, the captain and the king made sure that the public was once again ready to forgive Steve Rogers and Sergeant James Barnes.  And with that, the rumblings against Mr. Stark were starting up again.  The words ‘persecuted’ and ‘loyal’ were thrown around with respect to the captain, and the word ‘arrogant’ and ‘self-centered’ were used about Mr. Stark.  It was difficult to stay silent, but Vision couldn’t speak out.  He knew people would take one look at him and see nothing but Ultron.  Something to fear.  Something different.  A mistake.  Tony Stark’s mistake.
“No, Natasha.  If you and Samson want to go talk to him, I don’t like it but I won’t stop you.  But you have to tell him the truth,” Steve said, eyes watering.  “I can’t lie to him again.”
“I’m very good at making things explode,” Tony replied with a grin. Steve couldn’t help grinning himself at the look of pride in Tony’s eyes. “They won’t know what hit ‘em.”
“The Egyptians were always carving things like that,” Thor said, with a bored wave, trying to change the subject.
“Agent Coulson,” he said.  “Why have you brought him here?”
“How do we get in and find the prisoners,” Philip asked.
Thor looked at him for several long moments.  “I notice you’re most worried about the legality than any nonsensical worry about ‘unnatural’ acts,” he said.  “England has not put anyone to death for sodomy in over forty years.  And I am in no position to pass judgment.”  He said the last bit quietly.
"That's very kind of you," Steven said, taking an armful of blooms from his friend.
They waited until the men had exited down the ramp to drop down the ladder.  Hogun motioned them forward until they could see outside.  The two bundles were unceremoniously dumped into the back of a wagon, and once the guards had climbed aboard, were driven off into the night.  Thor pushed his way to the ship entrance, but Steven held him back.
He walked toward Steven, hands out in a placating gesture.  “Steven, please let me explain,” he began.
"You should have no guilt at all," Jarvis said, frowning.  "Obadiah Stane has abused your good nature for too long.  It is time you are on your own."
“Honey, I get a thousand emails on that account every day,” he said.
"No, no, no," Steve whimpered.
“Can you take us there?” Thor asked.
Steven followed him and they stood on either side of the entrance to the bridge.  Two men were checking gauges and levers on the console, oblivious to the intruders.  A table with maps and charts stood to one side, with a large map hung on the wall, with pins stuck into it.  It seemed to be of the Mediterranean.  There was a large pin in Egypt, and several in the small islands that dotted the waters between Italy, Greece, and Northern Africa.  Steven did his best to memorize the positions, though he could not say why it seemed so important.  In the corner of the map was a symbol.  A grinning skull with six swerving lines beneath it.  It unsettled him to his bones.  If this map mattered to these men, it was important.
“You should sleep,” Tony said, leaning against the wall. “We won’t be there for at least ten hours, and who knows when we’ll get to rest after that.”
Steve had the grace to look ashamed.  “I know.  I am still uncomfortable with the language behind the Accords, but I’m starting to see why they were needed.”
“And if they decide they want you around?  I’ll bite the bullet and put up with you.  But that is Laura’s call.  Because unlike you, I’ll actually ask her what she wants and try to honor it.”
“For the moment,” the king said.  “His public persona is taking a bit of a beating.”
Steve grimaced.  “Yes.  They’re staying with Tony.  S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives removed them before the HYDRA goons had a chance to grab them.
“I will not be left behind,” Thor roared.  “I will not let Loki suffer one more minute in captivity.”  He stormed from the room, slamming the door behind him.
“Bucky will be fine.  And he is much safer unconscious, where his mouth cannot get him into more trouble,” Tony said, a wry smile on his lips.
“Yes you are,” Thor said.  “And it is most unattractive.  Steven agrees.  Don’t you?”  Thor looked over at Steven with a teasing glint in his eye.
“Firstly, effective immediately, I am announcing not only my retirement, but the retirement of Colonel James Rhodes and the being known as the Vision.  We can not and will not operate under the current  framework, which has been twisted to imprison without due process those who have acted in what they felt was good faith in the protection of citizens.  Should the unthinkable happen and Earth find herself once again under attack from vengeful aliens, we will be there, but we will no longer put ourselves and our freedom under threat from petty tyrants looking to settle a score by manipulating the good intentions of others.”
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man:  “Ow!  Stop hitting me.  I am well aware of that and eminently grateful, Mrs. Parker.  I, however, cannot control what these assholes print.”
“With that as my guiding principle, I feel that I have no choice but to make two announcements.”
“We’ll keep him on the straight and narrow Mrs. Rogers,” Bucky said.  He threw his arm around Steven’s shoulders.
Thor introduced Steven to his father, Odin, who was nearly as warm as Lady Frigga in his greeting.  He launched into a discussion of the Egyptian exhibit, and was earnest in his entreaties for Steven to join them.  The discussion turned to science and history, and Steven's travels.  It was quite obvious that Lady Oxford was unhappy to have the conversation moved from her list of approved topics, but she managed a stilted smile, nonetheless.  It was soon apparent, however, that the shift would speed up her departure, much to Steven and Loki's relief.

"No sir," Tony admitted.  "But, I could afford a horse, perhaps, and a cart.  That way I could travel and take whatever jobs I can find.  And once I have a little funding, I could build something a little more suitable."
"New York?  How delightful," Loki said.  "You must tell us all about it.  I hear they have airships larger than any we've constructed here.  Is everything steam-powered there?  Have you visited other places in your nation?    Have you had lunch?"
She regarded him for several long moments before stepping back to him and throwing her arms around his neck.
With that, Tony left the podium, with Rhodey and Vision taking their positions at his side.  Not that long ago, he would have left them with a peace sign and a blown kiss.  But that Tony was gone.  This one just stared ahead and dared anyone to get in his way.
Thank you all for the warm reception!  I have to admit, the comments and kudos make me want to keep writing.
"Safe journey, sahib," Rahul said, accepting the pipe and taking a long drag off of it.
“Now, from what I’ve been able to decipher from the documentation, Hydra’s neuroscientists originally tried manipulating Mr. Barnes’ hippocampus using a combination of external stimuli and drugs, starting off in a lucid state and then applying pain stimuli in concert with injections.”
He had left Steve innocently surfing thinkgeek.com, trying to find a birthday present for Bruce amongst the assorted t-shirts and gizmos. Tony had been leaning towards matching xkcd tees for both he and Bruce, a sort of Science Bros bonding thing. He tried to remember if the site had any sort of scandalous items, but he couldn’t for the love of Tesla think of any.
He quietly removed the fittings on the main steam pipe. It would have been quicker to just take a wrench to the bloody thing, but it also would have attracted a little too much attention. He took a screwdriver to the gearbox next, and then jammed a wrench into the control panel, making it impossible to move several of the levers. It should take them hours to fix it, if not days.
"Enough, Barton. And as for the rest of you, have you broken our super soldier?” came the calm voice of Agent Coulson.
"You are too kind," Lady Oxford said.  "Will we see you at Bolton's card party on Wednesday?"
“Thor, myself. Our friends,” Hogun replied with a shrug.
"Your family is connected?" Philip asked, dodging a flying mug, luckily empty.
*****
“Hawkeye,” he said, walking towards his friend.  Barton’s face was devoid of emotion, right up until the second he drew back his fist and punched Coulson in the face, cracking his sunglasses and potentially breaking his nose.
Thor’s father had been invited because his father had left a legacy to the museum, which insured that his heirs would always have access to the collections.  Unfortunately, he had stayed at home that evening with a chill.  Thor, to Loki’s glee and Steven’s mortification, had asked Bucky to accompany them in his father’s stead.  He had left them as soon as they entered, intent on young ladies and free food.
“I learned, years ago in a cave in Afghanistan, that we must all be accountable for our actions.  Mistakes happen, most assuredly, but many times they happen because we are not vigilant, or we enter a situation without the necessary information.  I will admit that the Accords were such a mistake for me.”
Tony made no move to pick it up.  “And why in the hell should I think that he has any concern about that?” he asked.  “T’Challa and the people he harbored have shown no concern for me and mine, except to try and kill us.”
“I don’t care,” Steven said.  “Whatever it is, I don’t care.  I just care that you’re lying to this poor man as well.”  He gestured to Tony’s companion.  “Using him to get you in?”
"Perhaps," Lady Frigga said.  "We haven't decided."
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man:  “I am right here.  Two inches from you.  Can you not?”
“What else did he say?” Steven gritted out.
As before, it was Vision that answered the door.  He took one look at the delivery and closed it in Phil’s face.  Phil sighed, and knocked again.  This time, Vision didn’t open the door, he merely phased through it, making it obvious that he was not going to let them in.
“Do not trouble yourself,” Fandral said.  “They will make all of the conversation you need.”  And his eyebrows waggled yet again.
The best guess was the young man with him.  He was slightly shorter than Tony, with dark, messy hair.  Steven felt a sharp stab of jealousy when the young man said something that made Tony throw back his head and laugh, but Steven pushed it down.  It was easier to be irate that Tony had conned someone else.
“You can’t do this on your own,” Steven argued.  “We need to talk to the authorities.”
Tony didn’t seem to mind his hesitation.  “Of course!  And Brucie-bear should be turning up soon, too.  He and Helen should be more than enough to convince you.”
“Perhaps we should invite her down to give them some competition,” he said, not missing how his sister’s brow furrowed at the thought.  “Or the two of you could give them a demonstration.”
Steven looked up from his plate.  “Me?  I’m not that good.”
"Since school.  My father could afford to send me to the best schools, but he didn't have enough money to make people forget I'm the son of a tradesman," Loki said, with a pained chuckle.  "But Thor didn't seem to mind.  We've been friends ever since."
2 Days Earlier
Steven saw Mr. Borson and Lady Frigga stiffen slightly.  Thor and Loki looked as if they were ready to leap over and throttle the woman.
"This Saturday," Tony said.  "I am going to an exhibition with Mr. Banner on Friday night, and I can bring my things over on Saturday.  Then I can leave right after the show."
The curator had just finished locking the cage when they heard loud noises coming from the Great Court, followed by people screaming.  Steven tucked his notebook away and hurried to the door, worried for his friends.
Loki started at one side of the door, and began to slowly make his way around the perimeter of the room.  Steven paused just inside the door to get his bearings, and see if there was anything beyond stone tablets and scrolls to pique his interest.  Soon enough, he found that there was.
Rhodey found his voice first.  “What the fuck, Coulson?”
“What you have in your hands is documentation and proof that United States Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross has acted in his own interest and the interest of other parties in the inception and enforcement of the Sokovia Accords.  Starting with his involvement with Senator Stern, a known member of Hydra, in his efforts to remove the Iron Man armor from my possession.  Also, his previously undisclosed involvement in the conditions that led to the accident involving Bruce Banner and the creation of the Hulk, along with proof that Ross framed Banner for the incidents that took place in Harlem, New York.  Acts that, with the inclusion of human experimentation, would have placed Ross in a cell next to the heroes he has been hunting.”
“That’s him, isn’t it?” Thor asked.  “Philip mentioned that you’d had a run-in with someone who abused your good nature, and that you’d met here.”
Laura and another dark-haired woman were at the stove, stirring and adding ingredients to several pots.  The other woman hip-checked Laura, sending them both into peals of laughter.  Cooper and Lila sat at the kitchen table, while an older boy gesticulated wildly as he showed them something on a tablet.  Tony and Rhodes sat at the breakfast bar, drinking coffee and arguing over blueprints.  Tony had one hand on Nate’s rocker and was bouncing him absentmindedly.
They made it to Steven and stopped.  The shorter of the two sat down next to Steven on the bench.
“This doesn’t change the fact that we have enemies plotting against us in the shadows,” T’Challa said.  “We know who leaked the photos, but we’re still trying to find them.  We are not sure if they are working alone.”
“I have long ceased trying to explain Bucky,” Steven said.  “I’ve found that to be the safest option.”
“No, Phil.  I think I deserve to have my say in this,” Tony said.  “All I ever tried to do was keep us together and keep us safe.  Did I fuck up?  Yes.  And so did everyone else.  But why were my fuck-ups always chalked down to me being a megalomaniacal bastard?  Why couldn’t they just be mistakes?  No, anything I did that you people didn’t agree with had to be because I’m a power-hungry asshole.  Everything I did was just a step down the slippery slope to me being a villain.  Well you know what?  Fuck that!”
“I had hoped, in the beginning, to bring all sides to the table.  The original Accords were merely meant to be a springboard for the final document.  On our side, after the events in Sokovia, Johannesburg, and Lagos, I felt the Avengers needed time and the aegis of the Accords to rebuild the public’s trust in us, as opposed to continuing to act as we saw fit with no regards to the opinions of others.  From the side of the member nations, I hoped that you would take the opportunity to get to know the Avengers, and judge for yourself if we were to be allowed leeway in making decisions.  I viewed the Accords much like a teenager views a learner’s permit to drive--once we had proven ourselves worthy of your trust again, we would be able to function with minimal oversight.”
“Barton, I’m sorry,” Phil said.  “I wanted to tell you both but--”
Steve knew it would be bad, but he felt as if he was about to throw up.  He wasn’t sure he could sit through this.  He remembered what Bucky had been through at the Hydra compound during the war, and the thought that something so much worse had occurred to his friend, his brother, just shattered him.
“Hey baby girl,” he said.
“Which ones?” Tony sneered.  “The one who buried her knife in my back?  The one who sent me off to Siberia?  Or maybe the ones who buried Vision under fifteen floors of debris?  Surely you can’t mean the ones who nearly beat me to death in Siberia and then left me to die?”
“Are you more concerned that he’s here, or that he’s here with someone else?” Thor asked, settling beside him.
"Verily, my hammer is mighty," Thor said, with a pleased grin.
"Are you here for the Egyptian relics, or general interest," Steven asked, not wanting the conversation to end.  He could feel Philip tense beside him, but ignored the older man.
Thor was represented by a pair of tighty-whities with a very stylized version of his hammer dangling down in front. You also got a second pair where the hammer was thrusting up towards the sky.
"What just happened?" Steven asked.
"Marvelous!" Loki said, with a huge grin.  "As am I.  Thor here is not much of a scholar, but I do not hold that against him.  Are you planning to attend Doctor Ludlow's lecture on the Roman ruins he discovered in Cornwall?"
Steven wouldn't have used the word 'lovely' to describe her.  Formidable.  Frightening.  Fierce.  But not lovely.
He closed his eyes again and tried to drown out the sounds of traffic below.  The wind whipped around the roof, but it wasn’t loud enough to drown out the sound of the intruder who slipped over the wall.  T’Challa opened his eyes and sighed in frustration at the man in front of him.
The pub looked like the sort of place that Bucky would frequent, which was no sort of endorsement.  The barmaids were comely enough, and Steven supposed the smells wafting out of the kitchen were somewhat mouthwatering.
"Hmmm, pink roses, I think," Loki said, walking over to his rosebushes.  "They have been kind to me.  As I said, most of the people in their social circles would look down on someone whose money comes from trade.  But they have welcomed me with open arms, and not for my money."
"You've been friends for quite some time, yes?" Steven asked.
“I’m fairly certain that will be the case,” Steve said.  “Either way, I want to do this because it’s right.  He was right.  It’s all I can give him, now.”  There were tears in his eyes.
in my
Two days into their sea voyage, he had found himself staring at one of the stewards who came by to check on their rooms.  After a few hesitant discussions, Steven found out that the boy's name was John, and that he'd been at sea for nearly six years.  Steven made sure that he was in the cabin during John's rounds, and that had many a companionable chat while John replaced the bed linens and checked the lavatory.  Steven had a horrible feeling deep down in his gut as to why he enjoyed talking to John(laughing brown eyes, bright smile), but he thought he'd kept it well hidden.  Apparently not.
“Naughty boy,” he said. He kicked the ladder away, and Tony helplessly flailed as he fell. He hit hard, and a second stranger leapt down from above and placed a heavy boot on the ladder, trapping Tony underneath.
“I know,” Steve said.  “It just kills me that he is the last person I wanted to get hurt by this.  Why aren’t they blaming Ross?”
Steve collapsed onto a mat and leaned back against the wall as he removed his hand wraps, noting the blood staining the knuckles.  It was like being fresh out of the ice again.  Nothing to occupy his thoughts but the past.  Bucky still out of his reach, this time in a cryo tube, but he might as well have been in the bottom of that ravine.
“If only I could draw,” Loki said.  “Steven, I don’t suppose you would do one for me?  You are a much better hand with a pencil.”
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man:  “That depends.  What is your position on threatening your boss?  Bribery?”
“No,” Steve said, putting the full weight of any command he still had left in his voice.  “I will not trick him or lie to him again.  I’ve done enough of that.”
“Steven, I have obligations--”
"Better not be another Captain Hammer joke," Clint said.
"I will not rest until she's with her proper master," Jarvis replied.  "And to make that happen, we need to get you settled into your studies.  Since I know you will not let me help you out with the money, at least let me help you get started.  You say you have enough for a horse and cart?"
"Then there was a link to a Captain America pair. I thought they’d just have the shield on them."
"My Thor speaks highly of you, Mr. Rogers," Lady Frigga said.  "He says that you have an artist's eye and a good heart."
*****
“Excuse me,” Steven said.  The three men looked over at him.  “Would it be possible to do a quick sketch of the back?  Since it is already out of the case.”
Tony found the tablets in question in the corner of one of the smaller rooms.  Mr. Banner took out his pencil and notebook and began to sketch the carved stone.  The two colleagues were discussing a particularly ambiguous translation when Tony heard raised voices behind him.  He turned and for one moment, he couldn't keep the joy from his heart.
He wished he had prepared Shuri for taking over as Queen.  His advisors would do an admirable job of guiding her, if she listened.  Then again, stubbornness ran in the family, thought wryly.  The one thing he was completely dedicated to proving was that the fault was his and his alone, and that his people had followed his orders, even though they had not agreed.  It was the truth, and it would hopefully shield those who had done nothing but follow their king.
Tony sighed and gave his friend a pained grin.  “It’s there.  But the guest list is pretty damned exclusive these days.”
"Had you worked faster, I could have caught the shipment before it left Egypt," the man said.  "Now I have to finance a trip to England.  One half."
“Within the hour, I would think,” Samson replied.
"My family owns several cloth factories and part of a bank, ma'am.  He supplies uniforms to the army," Steven said.
"Nonsense," Jarvis said.  "At least take
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man:  “People’s Sexiest Man Alive.  Twice!”
"I'm sure they are happy that Thor has such a good friend," Steven said.  It boggled his mind that people might look down on someone who had built their own fortune.
They had known that T’Challa wouldn’t agree, so they had to do things under the radar, quite literally in some cases.  Even still, they tried their best to throw off anyone who tried to track them back to where they had been hiding--they might disagree with T’Challa’s caution, but they were still immensely grateful for his help.
Parker, M>Designation-Guest:  “I am not your damned girlfriend, Stark!”  {object: newspaper} {use: weapon} {threat level: negligible}
"Indeed," Lady Frigga said.  "I'm sure you and your husband are much more their sort of guest."
“Loki, stop it,” Thor said, and then sighed.  “Steven, I’m sure the ladies think you cut a dashing figure, in the most chaste of ways.  I believe the two of you wanted to go see the tablets.”
Loki chuckled and Steven blushed, which seemed to be the normal way of things of late.  They trailed after Thor as he made his way through the exhibition rooms, intent on a small room near the back.
“Mr. Borson, and his son Thor,” Steven explained.
“He was always known for deciphering codes,” Thor said.  “He did not do so professionally, but he has been known to assist several scholars with deciphering ancient puzzles.”
Mr. Banner managed to hail a hired cab within two blocks of the museum.  Steve and Tony stuffed Bucky inside and then helped Thor climb into the carriage.  Steve settled the larger man back onto the threadbare cushions while Tony spoke to a young boy, sending him off on several errands.  After a brief discussion with Mr. Banner, the latter set off on foot, leaving them.  Tony gave directions to the driver and then climbed into the carriage.  They set off along a side street.
Steve cursed to himself. He too stood and made his way to the stairs. “Tony, wait,” he said. He reached out to grab Tony’s arm, but the other man shook him off.
{grocery list: status} {item: ice cream, asstd. Flavors}  {purchase note: replenish daily}
"Now, son, we both know I have only been holding her for you," Jarvis said.  "She belongs with you.  Hell, she never runs as good as when you're at the controls."
Steven reluctantly agreed.  “Why are they here?”
Tony had to admit that was kind of funny. "And then…?"
“How goes it?” the Captain asked.
The sitting room at Le Monde Arborescence was barely large enough to hold all of the people inside, even without Steven and Thor pacing like caged animals.  Hogun sat on a low couch, speaking quietly with several young street children.  Sif and Volstagg had not been idle while their friends infiltrated the airship.  They had, instead, called upon a network of young children who roamed the streets of Paris.  Pickpockets, errand runners, beggars.  All of whom only had to show up at Sif’s back door for a hot meal.  And if they happened to bring news…
The tent flaps closed as heavily as an iron door, and Tony knew that once again, Obadiah had cost him something he wanted.
"Nonsense," Lady Frigga said, her mouth set in a straight line.  "You are welcome in our home any time, Loki."
Hogun rolled his eyes but nodded. “You will do as I say.”
"Lady Oxford, I do apologize.  The men do get carried away with their interests," Lady Frigga said.  It was obvious she wasn't too sorry, however.
Parker, P. > Designation-Guest: “On it.” {object: pint container} {use: medicinal} {object:spoon} {use: delivery mechanism} {secondary use: weapon} {threat level: negligible}
“There was, of course, dissent on the side of the Avengers.  There were those who refused to compromise, out of a sense of loyalty or naivete.  Some of my former team mates were just too pig-headed and distrustful to even hear me out.  But I do not regret speaking out for accountability.  The subsequent events merely showed me who and what was worth my time and efforts.”
“When my parents died, Stane took me in. My father provided for it in his will,” Tony explained. “I wanted to stay at home and continue on with his work, but none of his investors believed I was capable, so the business fell apart.” Tony seemed to curl in on himself. “Stane gave me a roof over my head. I believed that paying him back with engineering was only fair. To be honest, I was hoping that the machines I designed for him would catch the attention of other investors.”
It was the second time Howard had been mentioned that day, and Tony’s stomach did a flip.  Perhaps it was the thought of going off on an airship when his parents had met their end on such a journey.  Perhaps it was the reminder of death awaiting them at a moment’s notice.  Suddenly Steven’s face popped into his mind, and he squeezed his eyes shut at the stab of pain he had when he thought of Steven and death.
“Do you have any experience at sneaking into places you have to punch your way out of?” Hogun asked. “These aren’t society folk. They are killers and thugs. You would slow us down.”
“I invited you all to Wakanda,” T’Challa said.  “I had my own atonement to worry about.  I do not regret protecting you.  I just wish I could have kept you in one place.”  He allowed his frustration to leak onto his face.
“Okay,” Rhodey said, nodding.  “I guess I can understand that.  “Why is he coming back, though?  New York is still full of a lot of innocent civilians.”
“Oh, well then.  Guess we’re ready to get started,” he said, clicking his mouse.  “I’ve been studying the documents that King T’Challa and Ms. Romanov were able to secure with respect to the conditioning that Hydra performed on Mr. Barnes.”  He waved the red journal around.  “And I think I might have a possible pathway to a solution.”
“But that’s not how this game goes, is it?  So no, I don’t want your flash drive.  I imagine it contains information that one of T’Challa’s Dora Milaje is behind this?  And that Ross in involved?  Because guess what, I already figured that out,” Tony sneered.  “You are bringing nothing to the table but upset to people in this house.”
“Their families have long been friends with mine,” Thor said. “When our home country deserted the habit of titles, they sold their holdings and moved. My family moved to England, while their families moved on to the continent.”
“The ship landed at a field east of the city,” he said. “They have been loading supplies, but do not seem to be in a hurry to leave.”
“Boss?  I think you’ll want to see this,” she said.  The video was replaced by a live television feed.
"Thor and I prefer the company here to the undereducated and overly-pampered gentry that one finds in the more respectable establishments," Loki explained.
“Loki is quite interested in history,” Steven explained.  “He is quite the amateur scholar.”
He was due to face the United Nations committee overseeing the Accords the next day.  He would not deny his actions, and he had carefully outlined his reasoning.  He would, himself, be turned over for disciplinary action, as a signatory to the Accords, but he hoped that given Zemo’s testimony, they would see the overarching need to capture the villain and contain the other Winter Soldiers as an understandable reason.  He wasn’t holding his breath, though.
The man sat in a hookah-born cloud, taking in the sights and sounds around him while listening to other patrons chatter.  They talked about their wives, their concubines, and their business, lies and half-truths floating through the air like so much smoke.  They were all but oblivious to the stranger among them.  The man paid only a little mind, either; he was there to talk to one man, and one alone.
Very short update today.  Next chapter should be pretty long and will have some action.
“And how will you accomplish that?” T’Challa snapped.  Really, if they had just stayed put…
“Sure thing, my gal.  Secondly, as far as we know, there are no more Winter Soldiers flitting about to frame,” Tony said, looking at the delegate from Sweden, who waved uncomfortably.  Tony thought she looked familiar, but then he’d always liked tall blondes.
Steven stood far enough away to be out of their sight, but close enough to see the tablet.  He made a quick sketch, and then turned to a fresh sheet of paper for a more detailed version.  Lord Oxford lost interest, and excused himself, but the curators were kind enough to allow Steven to finish.  Once the tablet was secured again, he proceeded to copy the front and side markings of the tablet.
?” Rhodey asked.  “Is this some sort of euphemism?  Because I love you like a brother.  And not, like, a Winchester brother.  You’re the Jay to my Silent Bob.  Hetero life mates.”
Unwilling to trust anyone but the men to his immediate left and right, Tony had been doing some ‘fact-finding’ of his own.  Being blindsided about his parents’ deaths had forced him to take a closer look at the data Natasha had dumped from S.H.I.E.L.D.  Plus, he’d managed to salvage some information from the remains of Camp Lehigh that now sat on his own private servers.  He’d found some interesting information, facts that might have changed how he approached the whole Accords mess in the first place.
“Good,” Hogun said. “You can take care of the engines while we look for your friends.”
"Thank you," Steven said, wariness evident in his voice.
She led them past a parlor full of attractive young women and through a long hallway. They entered what must be a library or office, full of plush chairs and two enormous desks.
“I don’t like this,” Rhodey said, eyeing the U.N. delegates with mistrust.
“Heron was brilliant,” Tony explained.  “We are still learning things from his treatises on pneumatics and steam power.  And some of his contemporaries wrote about his experiments into the darker uses of science.”
Steven squared his shoulders and prepared to go and give Tony a piece of his mind when Loki touched his arm.  He looked over at the his friend, who was shaking his head.
"Duly noted."
during his last sojourn at the workshop.  Her sleek lines stood out from other ships, as did her flashy red and gold exterior.  It had killed him to leave her behind when Obadiah came to retrieve him, but there was no way Obie would have let him keep her.  She would have been auctioned off to the first person with enough money they could find.  So Tony had given her to Jarvis, a gift of thanks to the man who had helped Tony hone his talent.
“No.  Many are there to, ah, soak in the atmosphere,” Fandral said.  “Flirt a little, have a drink.  Make connections.  Thor said that your family is connected back in America?”
"Will you be joining Loki, Thor, and my husband at the museum exhibition on Friday evening?" Lady Frigga asked.
“It went through the fleshy part of your arm,” he said.  “And exited.  You should be fine.”
"But you did not bring me the tablet," the man explained.  "I was very specific in my request."
Parker, M>Designation-Guest: Breathing deeply. {heart rate: slightly elevated} {blood pressure: within normal parameters}
Friday needs an upgrade if they expect her to deal with this.
Steven’s eyes flew open.  “I don’t know what you mean?” Steven said, barely able to keep from shrieking.
He dragged himself to his feet and reached for the broom to sweep up the remains of the bag, wishing his other mistakes were as easy to fix.
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man: “I am attractive. I am rich.  I am a desirable partner.”
“Should the delegates wish to amend the Accords to reflect a more moderate approach, we would all be happy to revisit them in the future.  But as they stand, with the current methods of enforcement which were not explained in detail at the time of signing, they are untenable.”
The room was quiet for long minutes.  Finally, he heard Natasha sigh.
Phil had more important things than being T’Challa and Captain Rogers’ errand boy.  But he was also blessed with the ability of multitasking and killing whole flocks of birds with one stone.  So here he sat, waiting at Tony’s back door, with a message and a delivery.  He wasn’t sure how well the delivery would be received, but he had hope.
"Not particularly," Steven said.  "But ancient cultures can be quite intriguing."
“I beg your pardon!” Loki said, his face marred by an indignant frown.  “I am not whinging.”
He checked his pocket watch and saw that his contact was running late.  He took another puff and let the smoke drizzle out of his mouth, trying to remain patient.  The secrets he wanted to discover had waited nearly two thousand years to see the light of day, and twenty more minutes would not matter.  Two puffs later, he saw his contact making his way through the crowd.  Rahul was not a small man, and he crashed into nearly everyone, bring much more attention than the man would have liked.
His mother had bid them farewell at the docks as they boarded a steamship for London, England.  She wept openly, and Steven had to swallow down his own tears at leaving her to manage on her own.  His sense of duty to his mother made him question his selfish wants, but the excitement at seeing the world would not let him offer to stay.
Tony is done.  T'Challa brings home both good news and bad news.
“You don’t understand,” Steve said.  “It’s not that I think he won’t.  It’s that I know he will.  He’ll do it, and it will eat him up inside.  He’s different now, but he seems to be healing.  Bringing this back, it’ll reopen all of those scars and make him bleed out again.  I can’t ask him to do that.”
“They seem to believe so,” Tony said.  “And I have seen the wonders of Heron’s work.  It would not surprise me to find that he’d turned his hand to making weapons at some point.”
"Huh," Steven said.  "I suppose I had better finish this, then."  He returned to his work, studying the shell with fierce concentration.  The only thing that gave any hint at the new course for the day was a slight smile tugging at his mouth.
“Of course,” Steven replied. “You show us how to sneak and tell us who to punch.”
Again, thank you all for the response to this fic.  I am overwhelmed.
“You’ll need to pose as customers,” Sif said, with a shrug.  “Fandral can provide entree, as he has visited before.”  Fandral grinned and looked quite proud of himself.
He was weak, that’s why.  Weak enough to let his fear get the better of him.  Weak enough to be turned by Loki.  Weak enough to wake up every night to nightmares about Coulson’s death.  The agents he had killed.  Nightmares where Loki had forced him to hurt Laura and the kids.  He’d been under Loki’s control for days; he could barely imagine what Barnes had gone through, having to relive the memories of decades of being forced to hurt good people.
“And if he refuses to acknowledge you?”
"Our title is centuries older than theirs," Thor said.  His handsome face was marred by a scowl.
“Well, considering that I’m half of the pair, technically it would be Bisexual life mates,” Tony said, manipulating a hologram of Rhodey’s nervous system.  “And no, sugar bear, I’m not trying to get you out of your pants.  Well, I kinda have to, but mostly I’m trying to get you out of your exoskeleton.”
*****
"Actually, they’re kinda cool," Tony said.
“Explain what?” Steven snarled.  “You’re a charlatan.  All of your fine words about using your gifts for the betterment of man, and you’re really just using them to line your pockets?  Is that what you wish to explain?”
John H. had lost his car in the Battle of New York.  He and his family had been visiting the city for his daughter’s tenth birthday, and Hulk had used their family sedan to take out a Chitauri sleigh.  Geico didn’t cover acts of large green rage monsters, so John was having to work an extra job to help replace the car.  He missed being able to tuck his kids in at night, but there were just things you had to do.
Shuri’s lips curved into a feral grin.  “I would not say not to making an example out of her,” she said.  “But it is, unfortunately, impossible.”
“Clint!” Phil snapped.  The archer was trembling with anger, but he sat down and shut up.
"I'm not sure who I dislike more, that cow or her son," Loki said, once they were alone.
"You are truly an artist," the man said to Steven.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony left early to meet Mr. Banner at his rooms.  Mr. Banner lived in a modest flat near the museum, above a milliner.  The rooms were quiet and cozy, which seemed heavenly to Tony.  Whenever he visited, he left feeling somewhat jealous of Mr. Banner' situation.
"Now, the neighbor back home has a draft horse for sale, and I think we could come up with a wagon from the gear at your father's workshop.  All that is missing is you.  When do you think you will be ready to leave?" he asked.
"Hell yes that is more than okay," Tony said, resting his forehead against Steve's.
"So what wonders do you have in store for me today?" Tony asked.  "Some monstrous skeleton or exhibition on a lost tribe?"
“It might not work.  They might just toss us both into someplace like the Raft.  Or worse,” T’Challa said.
"Perhaps they have," Steven said.  "My understanding is that they will have many ancient technological wonders."
“Loki!  Where is Loki?” he cried, tears streaming down his face.
Steven Rogers just wants to see the world and not make his mother cry.  Is that too much to ask?
“I am,” Thor said, in a tone that disinvited argument.
"Let's leave my cousins out of this," Thor joked.  He led them through the main room.
“I have no idea,” Tony said, giving a chuckle at odds with the grim set of his face. “He sold off my machines, but I don’t know if he even told the buyers who built them. As far as I know, they believed that Stane created them himself.”
Steven's head whipped up and he nearly dropped his pencil.  "Pardon me?" he asked.
Clint slumped down onto the ramp, hanging his head between his knees.  “They’re okay?”
“Tony, I can assure you that your teammates were very worried about you,” Phil said, trying to smooth things over.
I just want to say, nobody in this fic, with the exception of Thunderbolt Ross, is irredeemable.  Do they have a lot to learn?  Yes.  But I believe that with enough work, nothing is broken that cannot be fixed.  I mean, you have the ultimate mechanic on the case, right?
Clint nodded.  Vision phased back through the door and unlocked it.  He let the two men in and led them through the hallway and into the kitchen.  There, they found a controlled chaos.
“What is it, my gal Friday?” he said.  He stood up and shuffled to the coffee pot, grimacing at the dregs of the batch he’d made somewhere north of four a.m.
“Well then, it is safe to return,” Steven said.  He stood and brushed the crumbs from his hands.  “I’ll go make your sketches.”
The others filed out, leaving Tony and Steve alone. Tony reached over and gave Steve a comforting pat on the back. "Buck up, Cap," he said. "If it makes you feel better, tell yourself that it's nothing more than grownup Underoos. It makes people feel more confident knowing you're there under their jeans and such. I had a pair of Batman Underoos when I was growing up, and look at me now! Dashing, rich, and using my brain to fight bad guys. Just like Batman!"
Cooper was more wary.  He scowled at his father, and then glanced over at Laura.  She and the other woman had turned around at Lila’s words, and they silently watched.  The other woman scowled, and had a protective arm around Laura’s shoulders.  Laura’s face was completely and utterly neutral.  No hint of emotion at all.
“Steven, you can’t fool me,” Thor said.  “You weren’t talking to a mere acquaintance in there.  You were speaking like a scorned lover.”

Hounslow Heath was the site of London's largest airfield.  When Tony arrived, he marveled at the vast number of ships that dotted the landscape.  He bypassed the commercial ships, hulking behemoths that blocked out the sun, and headed for the private berths to the north.  Once there, he had no trouble finding his greatest creation, a shining jewel in a midst of dull gray.
“Oh,” Steven said, letting the information sink in.  “You think these men think there is information about designing weapons in this exhibit?”
“We will need to disable the ship, just in case they try to leave,” Tony said. “I don’t want to be caught in the air on that thing with no way off if they take off while we’re nosing around.”
Parker, M>Designation-Guest:  “If you mean I might catch something from you, I agree.”{error:  conflicting definition} {interrupt loop}
I lied.  You get three chapters :)
Finally some action!
“Please be careful,” Sarah said, brushing a stray lock of hair from Steve’s face with gentle fingertips.  “I expect you to return home in one piece, young man.”
“They have certainly chosen a lucrative endeavor,” Tony said, looking at the tabulating machine. Steven saw his fingers twitch, and he wondered if Tony was tempted to crack into it and look at the inner workings.
“I want to help,” he said.  “And I can’t fight my way out of this, and frankly, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m not politically adept enough to talk my way out.”
Steven filled his days with trips and outings with the two men.  Loki procured tickets to several lectures and demonstrations, all very edifying and only slightly sensationalistic.  Thor balanced things out with showing Steven and Bucky more earthly diversions such as horse races and boxing exhibitions.  He and Bucky were becoming fast friends as much as Steven and Loki.  Loki even invited Steven back to his own library to see his collections.
"Can we cut the guy a break?" he asked. He changed the subject away from Steve by clicking onto the other Avengers. "Let’s see, the lovely Natasha is represented by the red hourglass on a black nightie, Clint, ah. Clint has an arrow with a charming little phrase: 'Always make sure the shaft is firm and straight'. Lovely."
After Jarvis left, Fandral poured out steaming cups of tea and handed round the plates of cakes. Tony finally sat down and accepted both a cup and a cake, though he stared off into the distance as he ate. Steven wondered what had the man so lost in thought.
Thor stiffened. “They are most honorable,” he said, a growl of warning hidden in his deep voice.
“Please note that a copy of this has been sent to every major news organization in the world.  Take your time reading it.  It’s a page-turner.”
The first thing Tony did after he read Steve’s passive aggressive little letter was drink himself stupid.  Actually, no.  The first thing he did was wing that fucking flip phone at the wall and watch it shatter.  The second thing he did was to drink himself stupid.  Once the hangover was gone, the third thing he did was throw out every bottle of booze in the joint.
"Frigga, Odin.  I believe we shall take your leave," she said, during a lull in the conversation.
“What is Les Danaïdes?” Bucky asked.  “Brothel?”  Steve elbowed him in his side and gestured towards Sif.  The lady in question rolled her eyes.
*ducks behind the sofa*  Sorry for the absence.  Life has been pretty tumultuous, and I'm just now starting to see a resolution.  Not necessarily the resolution I wanted, but a resolution nonetheless.  I will try to post a little more regularly, so thank you in advance for your patience.
I've lost the notes I had where this whole story was plotted out.  This will make things slower, but also will allow me to change some things up.  I'm shooting for a chapter every week to ten days.
Except for General Ross.  Fuck that guy ;)
The scene that greeted them brought Steven up short.  Hovering above the Great Court was an enormous air ship.  Airships were forbidden from venturing past the outskirts of town, which would have made the sight odd enough.  But stranger still were the long ropes suspended from the gondola.  Steven saw men descending along the ropes, with guns slung across their backs.
“And never go home again?” Steven asked.
“Save it, sir,” Barton sneered.  “I don’t have time for your bullshit.”
“Sir,” he said, settling back into parade rest, face still blank.
Thor stood and embraced the man. “Volstagg! It is good to see you my friend!”
"Nonsense," Loki said.  "He has rescued us from utter boredom."
Parker, M>Designation-Guest: “This!  The papers think I’m dating this asshole.”
“Now, here,” Samson continued, shaking it off and zooming in, “along the edge of the cerebral cortex on both sides, is the hippocampus.  The hippocampus is vital for the formation of short-term memories, and in taking those short-term memories and creating long-term memories.  Easiest example is that if you look at the brains of patients with Alzheimer's, you’ll note that there is early and significant damage to the hippocampus.  The tissue damage makes it impossible for them to form new short-term memories, and prevents them from accessing the long-term memories as well.”
"And until then, we'll have tea and cakes," Loki said with a warm smile, deftly changing the subject.
He set the journal down and clicked the mouse again.  A hologram of a human brain popped up over the middle of the table.  Several of the Avengers jumped, but those that had worked with Tony were used to such things.
It was the first time Rhodey had seen that particular smile since before Ultron.  It was the joy of creation without fear--a look that Rhodey had missed.  Tony was at his most brilliant when he was creating things that would help his friends.  He let his imagination go in a way that he couldn’t back when he had been designing weapons or when he was designing items for mass market.  But when he was making something that knew would be in safe and responsible hands?  He let his mad genius run wild.
Tony wasn’t sure if it was physically possible for the man to turn any redder. He clicked to the store’s main page. Each of the Avengers were represented.
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man: “Wait, why is she ‘Boss Lady’?”
“Perhaps,” Thor said.  “But perhaps not.  I think you should speak with him, away from all of this.  Away from his family and your Philip.  You don’t seem like a bad judge of character, Steven.  I mean, look who you’ve befriended!”  He gestured to himself with a wave of his hand and a gave Steven a beaming grin.
Steve finally starts thinking.  And asking for help.  But is it too late?
Steven thought about that for a moment.  He was able to pursue his interests because his family’s money allowed that.  He wondered what he would do if there wasn’t money for books and trips around Europe?  Would he do what he had to in order to help his family?  Even if it meant bastardizing his dreams?
"How did a search for Hulk shirts lead you to this?" Tony asked.
Phil watch as Clint broke down.  He reached over and put his hand on Clint’s shoulder.  The uncomfortable silence was broken by the new AI, Friday.
“I know,” Steven said, reluctant to leave. “I have never been aboard an airship before, though. It is certainly a thrilling experience.”
"Thank you sir."
Parker, M>Designation-Guest: “Do you realize that everyone I know is going to see this?  They’ll think I’m your flavor of the week!” {dictionary: flavor of the week} {context: sexual partner} {meaning: temporary tryst}
Steven bit down a squawk.  “I would never--”
"My face!" Steve managed to get out, pointing wildly at the laptop. "My face is on someone’s crotch."
"If you mean American, then yes I am.  New York, actually," Steven said.

“There’s a reason people call him one of the smartest men on the planet,” the Captain replied, with a smile.  Vision wasn’t a great judge of human emotion, but the smile looked sincere enough.  He wondered if Rogers was putting on an act for the security cameras.  Surely he wouldn’t need to lie to the king, although perhaps the ruler wasn’t privy to the entire plan.  “Is he okay?” Rogers continued.  “Have there been any other moves against him?  Are they safe?”
"Tony—"
“Think what you will about Stark, but he would never let innocents come to harm if he had it in his power to save them, especially if he feels he owes them a debt of loyalty,” Phil said, no small amount of censure in his voice.  They all looked away at that, shame evident on their faces.  “I don’t know how you all lost sight of that, but I think you need to remember that before you go off half-cocked again.”
“All I can think of is that he tried to keep us together.  And that’s the only way we could have beaten this.  Together,” Steve said, quietly.  “I forgot that.  We were never as strong as when we were both focused on solving a problem.  He remembered it.  He got it.  He listened to me.  I just want him to know that I finally listened to him, too.  It took too long and too many people got hurt, but I finally get it.  I have to be accountable for my actions.”
Tony announces a death of the family.  Meanwhile, in Wakanda...
“What you’re telling me is that even without the Avengers, the proper authorities managed to do their job with no loss of life,” T’Challa said, no small amount of snark in his voice.  “It’s almost as if there are competent people who aren’t superheroes.”
Thor threw back his head and laughed.  “I should think he does,” he said.
Steve thought he might cry.  “He never did come up with a better name for it,” he said, resting his head on the table.  “If that’s our only option, then there’s nothing we can do.”
“I expect nothing less, Captain.”
Steve grimaced as another heavy bag exploded in front of him.  He’d gotten used to the reinforced bags that Tony had given him, which stood up to his favorite method of stress relief.  While the bags in T’Challa’s gym were good, they weren’t Tony’s.
That being said, none of the fixes will be quick.  And some of them might not be resolved in the spaces here.  But I think there will be enough of a resolution to let me (and hopefully you) rest easy.
He spent the rest of his time divided between working on the large machine and conferring with Mr. Banner.  The young scholar had managed to get a list of objects in the exhibition, and the two men pored over it to make sure that they did not miss any items of interest.  When Mr. Banner needed to return to his studies, Tony devoted himself to making sure the machine was in top condition.  While he did not wish to remain a slave to Obadiah, he did not particularly wish them ill, and he wanted to do as much as possible to ensure at least Pepper's wellbeing.
“Yes they are with Stark.  At Laura’s request,” Phil said.  He took advantage of the shock.  “She rightly assumed that the safest place on the continent that wasn’t a SHIELD base was with Tony.”
"And he wants you to follow after?" Steven asked.
“As far as I know, Cooper, Lila, and young Nathaniel currently have the run of a mansion and a red and green AI for a best friend.  And Laura is bossing Stark around like she was born to it.”
Tony looked him straight in the eye. "Then again, maybe I’d rather look up and see your face."  He wasn't expecting the blinding grin Steve gave him.
He was on his way back up the ladder when he saw a figure stepping out of the shadows above him. The man with the lion mask chuckled, shaking his head.
The last of the men descended from the airship.  While most of the armed men were undisguised, the last of the men, obviously their leader, wore a lion-shaped mask like one would see at a fancy dress ball.  He ordered several of the men to follow him as he made his way towards the exhibition rooms.
“What they found is that they were able to get temporary results in this manner.  He would be somewhat obedient for a certain period of time, but then would relapse and his original personality would begin to reassert itself.  Now, remember that their technology was nothing like what we have now, but even then they were able to see that the damage to his hippocampus was healing.  Due to the serum in his blood, he was actually regenerating brain tissue.”
“Why?  After all we have done to keep you out of custody?” T’Challa asked.  “How will this help?”
The Captain was just as different, but people saw it as a comforting difference.  He was old-timey and warm.  Vision, and by extension Mr. Stark, was the unknown.  The bleeding edge.  He was progress that always demanded sacrifice.  He was uncomfortable.  He was unpredictable.  He was the wild pioneer spirit that would strike out in search of something new and better.  He was the man who strapped on an untested hunk of metal and tech and went flying.  People like Mr. Stark were never understood in their time, and only truly appreciated when looked at in historical context.  The world would never see Tony Stark as he truly was until he was long gone, when they didn’t fear him anymore.  And when it was too late for him to feel their appreciation.
“And you trust him?”
Steven tried to surge forward, to go to his friend, but strong hands pulled him back into the exhibit.
Her second stipulation was that he have companions.  His choice was his friend Bucky Barnes, the youngest son of a neighboring family and one of his few friends that didn't seem bothered by his scholarly ways.  For her part, his mother chose to send along her trusted employee, Mr. Philip Coulson.  He was loyal to the family, and had been blessed with a solid head on his shoulders.  He would be well equipped to keep Steven and Bucky out of trouble.
Never read the comments on the internet.
Lady Oxford was the worst sort of guest, in Steven's opinion.  She dominated the conversation, only allowing her son or Lady Frigga a chance to speak when she asked them a question.  Steven and Loki exchanged miserable glances every once in a while, especially when she launched into a tirade on the dangers of young women showing more than an inch of skin at parties.
Parker, M>Designation-Guest:  “I will threaten my boss as often and as intensely as needed to get things done.  My forgiveness can be bought with college scholarships for my nephew.”
“So how do you plan to fix it?” Sam asked.
“Tony hates her more,” Natasha said, looking up from the scarf she was knitting.
Philip looked at Steven with a fond smile.  He never pretended to understand his charge, but that didn't stop him from liking the young man.  And for all of Joseph Rogers’ bluster about Steven being so much unlike him, Philip recognized the passion and intensity of his old friend in the blue eyes peering back at him.
Philip chuckled.  The two men might be slightly insane, but at least Steven didn't look like he'd just lost his puppy.
"Everything went well?" Lady Frigga asked, settling her husband and son on either side of her on the settee.
“Because he’s starting to realize that maybe the Hulk isn’t the threat that he’s always assumed he is,” Tony said.  “Before Ultron, he and Natasha were getting pretty close to having the Hulk issue managed.  He was a full member of the team, he listened to strategy, and saved all of us on more than one occasion.  Hell, I once found him standing over a litter of kittens, protecting them from falling debris.”
“I will accompany you, my king,” Shuri said, falling into step beside him.
"I would imagine that while there are many women who would love to have Steve’s face on their crotch, he probably has a large gay male following as well. I mean, have you looked at him?" Natasha asked. "Muscles, clean cut in a way they just want to mess up. He’s gold. Where as Tony has a long and well documented association with girls who wear crotchless panties."
“Steve--”
"Still want Captain America underwear?" Steve asked.
"Yesterday?" Tony said.  "Truthfully, I would stay to finish out the London run of the show, and then I will be ready to leave.  They should be able to fill their coffers enough to make it through the foreseeable future, as long as Obadiah keeps Zeke from gambling it all away."
"Actually, Loki brought me flowers from his gardens," Lady Frigga said.  "And he brought their new friend to meet me.  May I introduce Steven Rogers, from New York?"
Steven’s jaw dropped.  “You?  Are you...?  Does Loki know?” he asked.
“Well,”Steve said.  “I’ve got a super spy I could lend you.  Point Natasha in the right direction, and let her take it from here.”
Lady Oxford turned to Steven and looked him up and down.  It finally occurred to Steven just who she reminded him of—his first teacher back home.  She'd been a handsome woman, though hard.  And she'd made his knees quake in fear, much like Lady Oxford.
“I really don’t like her,” Steve said, glaring at the television.  The former Avengers sprawled across the media room in the apartments that T’Challa had provided.
"Come on Steve, it’s not that bad," Tony said. Thor, Jane and Darcy joined them around the laptop.
Parker, P. > Designation-Guest: “Oh God.  No, just.  Please never use those words again.  I’m just going to leave, now.  After I grab ice cream.  Maybe the brain freeze will remove this memory.”  {heart rate: elevated}  {skin: flushed}
It was a fine June evening, warm without being hot, with clear skies and a slight breeze.  The Great Court of the British Museum glowed with the seeming thousands of the new steam-powered electric lights strung up above them, crisscrossing the sky like shooting stars.  There were large buffets set out around the Reading Room, and staff milled about providing the elegant assembly with glasses of punch and wine.  If Steven had felt small on his first visit to the large complex, he now felt both small and under-dressed.
As the days had stretched on in Wakanda, it was amazing the kind of perspective that they had all gained.  Sam had shown him the posts he’d found with normal people voicing their fears of the Avengers.  And while Clint still disagreed with the Accords as written, it was starting to sink in that no group of individuals could act without the consent of the people they were trying to protect.  They wanted to be heroes, not tyrants, benevolent or not.
Sands interrupted them with another visitor.  "My lady, Lady Oxford and her son, Baron Hammer are here to see you."
Barton, L. >Designation-Boss Lady:  “Of course you are, Tony.  You’re a pretty, pretty princess.  What’s all the drama?”
window.  “Jarvis is an old friend of my father’s.  He is well-traveled and familiar with the Continent.  And how?  Well, I’ll show you when we get there.”
“Taking a version of Extremis that Helen and I modified and letting it work it’s techno-magic on your spine,” Tony said, an excited grin on his face.
Steven had no idea what to say.  He knew he should be appalled, but that would be hypocritical.  Thor and Loki had been nothing but kind, and Steven would not abuse their friendship, or their trust.
“Difficult.  I understand,” T’Challa said.  “But this is the path you have chosen.  We simply have to get through it, and hope that we can reforge ties and repair trust.”
“Pathetic,” she growled.  “Even that Russian would be better suited than these.”  Ever since their run-in in Berlin, Shuri had held a bit of a grudge against Agent Romanov, much to T’Challa’s amusement.
Steve ignored the references to Tony’s sex life.  “If Pepper is gone, he’ll have to step up, right?” he asked.  “Who else is there?”
Tony paused.  There were a handful of people who had that address.  One of them lived on the floor below him.  One of them died in a second-rate armor in Malibu.  And one of them had left him a couple of months ago.  The only other person who had that address had skived off after Sokovia, trying to bury his big green head in the sand of an island in the southeast Asia.
For Tony, salvation came in the form of a letter from Jarvis.  His old friend had left the workshop in the country and made his way to London.  He didn't dare risk coming to the carnival himself, so he sent a messenger to find Tony and ask him to visit the airfield west of town.  The carnival was closed on Sunday, so Tony headed off early that morning before Obadiah or his family was up and about.
"If it makes you feel better, at least she looked at you," Steven said.  "Then again, she didn't talk to me either, so maybe I win?"  He grinned at Thor's parents, and they laughed.
It was Steven.
"I am interested in all things mechanical," Tony said.  "I'm not much for appreciating art, or old bones, but I am deeply jealous of their technical breakthroughs."
Thor surged forward, yelling for his friend and brandishing a candelabra from the table.  Lion Mask raised his gun and fired, and Steven saw his friend stagger back.  He shook off Tony’s hands and raced toward the Great Court, arriving just as Lion Mask and his men were hoisted from the ground and up to the ship, along with Loki.
“You built her?” Steven asked.
“Here is a normal human brain.  Or, relatively normal.  I used Mr. Lang,” Samson said, spinning the brain around.  Sam and Clint chuckled while Scott looked offended.  Samson looked up.  “Oh, I meant, uh, not knowing how his suit and the Pym particles might have affected his brain function and chemistry.”  He blushed.
Barton, L. >Designation-Boss Lady: “I’m going to ignore that.  May?  Tony?  Can you make Friday’s suggestion work?”

And that smile was the only reason Rhodey was even thinking of letting Tony have his way.
Six heads snapped to him.  “They’re with Stark?” Clint asked.  “Phil--”
"I just searched on the Hulk," Steve explained. He sat down next to Tony and buried his face in his hands. "The item I originally saw from this store was a pair of green boxers with 'HULK SMASH' on them. I thought they were funny."
“Daddy?” she asked.  She bolted from her chair and flung herself at Clint.  He picked her up and held her tight, and Phil could see the tears on his cheeks.
“You don’t know that, Steve,” Natasha said.  “Let me go and talk to him.  Maybe I can make him see reason.”
Tony smiled. “Indeed. And Phoenix is a beauty, if I do say so myself.”
“Tony!” Steve screamed from the kitchen.
Maybe if he’d been able to talk to Laura about how much Loki had fucked him up, she would have understood why he needed to go.  He’d tried so hard to protect her and the kids, to keep all of the ugliness of his work far away from them, that he’d kept just how fucked up he was from her as well.  He’d woken up with night terrors and left her sleeping in the bed while he went out vent his frustrations on targets.  He hadn’t told her how it felt to see his once-friendly co-workers stare at him like he was about to snap and kill them all.  If he hadn’t had the Avengers, Clint wasn’t sure he could have kept any semblance of sanity.
“Perhaps,” Steven said.  “But that leaves the problem of finding someone.  I don’t have the same kind of situation you two had.  How does one even begin going about finding someone else with the same desires, let alone court them?”
“Us?” Steven asked, weakly.
"Aye," Jarvis said.  "And when might that be?  Do you have the money saved up yet?"
In the Great Court, attendees and museum staff huddled in clumps, overseen by even more of the armed men.  Thor and Loki were hunched down behind a buffet table, and Bucky was...  Oh Lord.  Bucky was yelling at one of the armed men.  Two young women cowered behind him, and a third one--the smart one--was trying to slip away and into the crowd.  The armed man finally raised his weapon and knocked Bucky out with the rifle butt.
“What, like using science to trick people into turning over their money in a confidence scheme?” Steven asked, unable to resist the dig.
“I’m sure you’ll figure it out,” Loki said.  “It is a shame that your Tony turned out to be so untrustworthy.  He was most pleasing to look at.”
The man slipped out of the bar, and headed into the night.
Heh.  He wondered if anyone had ever checked Ross for a ‘666’ tattoo.
“Nonsense,” Thor said.  “We’ve seen your journal.  You’re quite the artist.  Please?  It might make Loki stop whinging.”
“Tony’s technology,” Steve said.
Tony paused outside of the museum.  The people streaming in were dressed in the finest clothes, and the women had gems draped all over them.  Tony was certain that someone would take one look at him and have him removed, but Mr. Banner showed their invitation, and they were granted entrance with only a bit of a raised eyebrow.
“He would have come to find us,” Steven said, unable to catch his breath.  Tony.  With his clever hands and bright grin.  Tony, who he had judged.  Who he had looked down upon.  Tony.
"Grand Tour," Steven said.  "Well, whichever stops on the Grand Tour have historical or artistic merit.  I'm quite interested in history, you see."
"Really," Steve said, skepticism thick in his voice.
Steven wanted to wrench away from his friend.  He wanted to grab Tony by the shoulders and shake him.  He wanted to demand to know why someone of Tony’s talents would use them to fool poor, uneducated people.  But he did none of those things.  He listened to his friend and he walked away.  They left Loki to study scrolls and went to get a glass of something strong.
