'This guy is a god. I'm certain of it.' Tony thought as he finally did as he was told and went to go get dressed.
Two hours later Tony was dancing around to celebrate his victory (Steve had gone easy on him), and Steve was laughing at him.
'His lips taste like something.' Tony thought as he lost himself in kissing the blond. 'Oh, they taste like paradise.' He finally realized.
"Tony took Steve's hand in his. "I thought it was sweet, it's not every day you find a gentleman." He said, shooting Steve another smile.
"Wait! Steve! I'm not! I stopped! I'm not that person anymore! I want to be better! Steve! Don't leave!"
"Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, I am Iron Man. How are all you beautiful people doing tonight?" The man said into the sparkly red mic he was thrown.
"What is it, what is it?!" Steve said, yanking open the bathroom door (Where he had been for most of Tony's short dream).
"Ooo, responsive, you don't get many of those anymore." The man raised his eyebrow at the crowd who gave a collective chuckle.
When the smoke cleared a thin, tall man with long black hair and a green costume stood in the center of the stage.
"What is wrong with you?" Steve said, his voice twisted in disdain. "You're just a screw up and a whore. How did I even let you touch me?!" Steve made a sound of disgust and slipped away from Tony, back into the smoke.
"Look Stark, I've got work to do, if you're done get to work! I plan to work the hell out of you these next two weeks!"
Luckily though, Loki got out of the chains without slipping just in time and then the part of the act that most of the people in the club had been waiting for began.
Steve was led backstage and given a room to change back into his clothes. He changed quickly and was about to go back out to his friends when he caught sight of 'Iron Man' still in his costume, chatting with a performer Steve hadn't seen before and that guy in the purple who had been part of Loki's act. Steve looked at the man, the smooth slope of his ass and the way he stood, the goatee that for some reason attracted him even though he'd never had a thing for facial hair. And that smile. . . Steve could tell it wasn't real, and he really wanted to see the real one. So he squared his shoulders and marched over there, prepared to try his luck.
The man surveyed him again. "Just come backstage again and tell them Tony is waiting for you. Someone will lead you to my dressing room."
Tony smiled and snuggled close to Steve, something else he wouldn't usually do. "Yeah it was. . . It was amazing, and so are you." Tony said, enjoying the happy blush that spread across Steve's face.
Part of him wanted to push the other man away as he continued to nip at him through his clothing, the other part of him was feeling way too good.
"Thank you for telling me." Steve said cupping Tony's cheek and tilting the brunette's chin to look into his eyes. "But I still think you're amazing. And what you just told me makes me think so even more. You made something good out of your life, If you let me. . . I'd like to stick around to make it something great."
"Tony, what's wrong?" Steve asked to sit beside Tony on the bed. "Tell me." He said, giving Tony those puppy eyes again.
They had just finished explaining to Steve when the first few bars of Ke$ha's 'Take It Of' came across the speakers.
"Well well, a Blushing volunteer, how quaint. Alright Blondey, let's see what we can do with you. . . " The man walked around him, surveying his frame.
The beefy blond noticed them and made his way over. "Steve! How did you fare this night?" Thor asked, before he noticed Tony. "Ah! Man of Iron, My conquest has mentioned you before. I am pleased you are enjoying my friend's company. He is a good man." Thor said with a smile.
Tony kissed his cheek, "Well I am certainly surprised. Is this going to be the nature of our relationship?" His asked as he wrapped his arms around Steve from behind. "Are you planning to spend our time together spoiling me?"
He'd marched in and told Fury he was giving him his two week notice. Fury's only show of emotion was the slight raise of his eyebrow.
Tony's heart had skipped a beat as he imagined Steve asking him to marry him and he'd known this was the right decision.
"Yes, It has been upon my thoughts since you agreed Steve, What made you finally surrender?" Thor asked as they finally found a good table.
Tony didn't correct Steve this time, laying there wrapped in this unreal man's arms he could almost believe him. . .
Steve pulled off, "It's okay, go ahead." He said before taking Tony back into his mouth. Tony again pulled the blonde's soft locks, moaning as Steve sucked him off. Before long Steve had moved beyond just sucking, he began to nip at him and let a single finger slip down to stroke his entrance and.
Tony choked, "Oh my heart!" He said, reeling back and clutching his chest dramatically, "All this cheesy cliche romance is going to give me a heart attack!"
They spent the day together, Steve took Tony out for his second cup of coffee and they sat there talking and learning more about each other for hours, till it was time for Tony to get ready for work.
Steve nodded, "I want a relationship with you Tony, if you don't want that that's fine, just tell me. I'll be sad about it, but I will respect your feelings. If you do want that though. . . " He looked at Tony with those hopeful puppy eyes that had already driven him crazy before.
Steve bit his lips as he thought, an endearing action that made Tony smile. "How about we go out for burgers?" Tony asked. "There's a great place just around the corner."
“Gotcha,” Tony said, and Steve had no idea what he had worked out, but he led Steve over to an empty chair next to an older man who was patting a large black cat.
But he’d faced tough before, and he’d do it again. He flung his arm back with the shield clasped in his hand and let it go in a wide arc.
“More like a beloved family heirloom. I grew up hearing all the stories about you. The Star-Spangled Man with a Plan.”
Stephanie wasn’t given to much gossip. Mostly because she had no friends in the camp, and she tried to avoid being around groups of the other cadets as often as possible. But even she couldn’t avoid hearing about the Dunmer that helped run the armory that followed the company from training ground to training ground.
“You think you’re clever,” Steve mused, low and tense. He felt the warmth of that foray against the back of his neck even though they were in the dim, red-lit room of some vaguely-formed basement. If Tony could see, he’d probably pout and glance at Steve with a pitiful, pleading expression. It was one of the reasons Steve had returned the favor and blindfolded him.
Tony blinks at him, mind shooting off in a thousand different directions until he connects the dots with the expression on Steve’s face. The careful determination coupling with the blush and, ah. Tony covers Steve’s hand and squeezes it.
Tony is a notorious flirt. Everyone knows it. What every doesn’t know, he’s also extremely shy in certain situations. And this is one of them. He’s full-on blushing by the time Steve is kneeling at his feet to measure his inseam.
“Then, I’ll just have to give you something to remember me by,” Steve said, and he peeled Tony’s briefs off, scraping his teeth down Tony’s pelvis until he got to his cock.
“And he’s a History teacher,” Tony said, finishing Pepper’s sentence with a mock of her voice. “I hate History.”
Steve pulled back then, despite Tony’s attempt to keep him close, and brought Tony’s hands down from his head. Tony watched him stare at his hands, thumbs swiping over Tony’s callouses.
A creak and a yank that pulled Tony forward, and then pain bloomed across his face and left him reeling as he blinked at the sudden sunlight. It was blue, so blue, and at the last moment, Tony managed to turn his palms away as the repulsors fired at a capacity they shouldn’t have been capable of. He hit the corner of the Home Depot and the parking lot of cars around it.
He doesn't need any identifiers on the post cards. He doesn't need to see the places they showed or the names, almost-faceless, people. He knows who they're from.
Captain America threw Iron Man bodily into the wall. He felt no regret as he watched the armor slide down, metal scraping the cement on screeching impact. Tony struggled to right himself under the weight of the suit, forcing it to obey so he could come up on one knee. Steve felt the rage build in his throat like the roaring in his ears.
He can see Tony's head turn towards a monitor, can almost 'feel' his creator's eyes in his schematics like a physical touch. He knows that Tony can see the code, can see what Jarvis wants without the consciousness to want it.
Nightmares of colors streaking out from his fingertips and changing the world, but it was never for the better.
“Right. I’m assuming no hospitals still… so am I calling someone else for you since you and the good doctor are on the outs?”
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Tony cut in dismissively, though his ears burned at the insinuation. Once upon a time…
“It’s fine. I mean, I admit that I was expecting something more like a sandwich shop, but…” He craned his head to the side to peer at the bag hanging from the crook of Steve’s arm, “
“Sir, the thorium has been completely consumed. Radiation levels are still peaked, and any civilian still alive will need to be quarantined and treated immediately for poisoning. I estimate the loss of life to be in the low hundreds despite their best evacuation efforts. The remaining passengers aboard the planes have survived with minor injuries, but will also need to be quarantined.”
That is until Tony begins to notice that Steve, over the course of the next hour, is steadily inching closer to Tony in increments. Silent and never looking at Tony when Tony looks over, Steve has a datapad in his hands and a furrow in his brow. That’s enough for Tony to finally set his tools down.
“Doesn’t dinner come before you getting into my pants?” Tony asks, trying to find his wit and charm. Its effect is muted from behind his palms, but he finally drops his hands, letting them fidget between their bodies.
His throat closed fully and he had to look away before he squeezed his eyes shut. The realization that it was Steve who’d come was a slow heat creeping up his neck. He’d called Steve instead of Victor, and he’d sealed his fate. There was no way Steve had arrived at the scene of the accident and not found-
“I’m so fucking proud of you, baby,” Tony croons, pushing the sound gently back inside again as he slides his fist up. Steve sobs again, chest heaving. “Keeping so still for me, aren’t you? Do you want to come like this? Can you come like this?”
It took far too long for him to get his phone to light up, and even longer to find Victor’s number. It didn’t strike him as strange at the time that the digits looked wrong, but before the phone even finished connecting the call, he closed his eyes. The phone clattered to the ground beside him and he sunk into unconsciousness.
Tony scowled and bit out, “I guess all private conversations weren’t so private either.” That hurt more than it should have, adding another layer of betrayal to the growing stack between him and Steve.
So Steve doesn't even think too much about it. Instead, he finds another way to share. He draws his sketches of his sights on blank postcards.
“Of course, Director Fury,” Rogers agreed, “Two hours is more than enough time to get into trouble and get him home in one piece.”
“It wasn’t that short, Tony,” Pepper admonishes, but there’s warmth in her tone and Tony knows he’s pleased her by remembering.
“Did you just… Do I even want to know what it is? Please tell me it’s just regular… Tell me it’s something I’ll know.”
The vibrations continued for only a minute or two, just long enough for Tony to shift a couple times, and then they were gone. He had breathed out, and gone on with his morning.
“Naturally, but files indicate that Captain Rogers requested the re-enlistment. Notations suggest that SHIELD psychiatrists believe that he thinks being out in the field will help him adjust more quickly. One note reads: ‘Captain Rogers dislikes being idle. It leaves him too much time to think and focus on his loss. It’s possible that Captain Rogers could be a liability. Against Director Fury’s recommendation, Captain Rogers is being approved for active duty, per Councilman Pierce’s direct approval. Director Fury concedes as long as Captain Rogers reports for his weekly therapy, he will remain on active duty. He will be monitored closely.’”
Tony doubled over and choked out between peals of laughter "Your. . Faces! Oh my god! I've never. . .!" was all he got out before he started coughing. Steve patted his back in concern.
Tony eyed him, trying to figure out if he was being condescending or not. He didn't seem to be, so Tony answered truthfully. "Actually, I always wanted to be an architect. But school wasn't what was on my mind when I was in my early twenties."
Natasha and Bruce stood close as they clapped, and Tony gave a small smile as he remembered his part in their closeness. He'd introduced them a couple months into dating Steve and the two, after a bit of an awkward start, soon began a relationship no one saw coming but at this point no one could see ending.
The man raised an eyebrow, as did his companions. They all shared a look and Steve could tell they were trying to figure him out. He knew how these people were used to being treated, but he could never possibly bring himself to treat anyone that way.
Later that night Tony rolled away from Steve, as his subconscious was entangled in a web of dreams and lies. . .
Sure enough Sam and Nat both dragged his protesting frame to the stage and practically threw him on it. Steve tried to look to Thor for help but discovered the other blond was gone.
Tony just shook his head, "I'm not sure if you're super naive, out of your mind or just a plain idiot. But you have to be the biggest optimist I have ever met."
Steve surveyed Tony sadly, It was obvious to Steve by now that Tony did not think as highly of himself as his behavior on stage suggested. "I'm sure someone will come along Tony." He said. Privately thinking that he would be that person if he could be so lucky.
Tony chuckled, Loki was a haughty bastard, and even though Tony had had the hots for the taller man when the other had first started working at S.h.i.e.l.d, he now just pitied the guy.
Moments later they were falling into bed. Tony tried to get on top, expecting to be the more experienced of the two of them. But Steve just shook his head and gently moved so Tony was beneath him but not crushed. "You're used to taking care of other people." Steve said in a gentle voice. "Now let me take care of you." He said in barely a whisper.
The man finally nodded slowly, "Ah, sure. I get off in about 45 minutes. . . If you want to wait till then."
'I'm fairly certain there were no blueberries or pancake mix in my kitchen.' Tony thought as he peeked his head into the kitchen, clad only in a red towel that was wrapped around his waist.
And like that, Tony saw that the blushing, awkward man he'd met on stage that night was nowhere to be found. Before him now was a man who was confident and knew what he was doing. It sent a thrill down Tony's spine. He watched in awe as Steve mirrored his own moves from earlier in the night, shimmying down Tony's front till he was level with his crotch.
Tony was almost disappointed when they reached the parking lot of his apartment. But when Steve offered to walk him up he didn't mind so much.
As they rocked Tony's bed Tony had the presence of mind to realize this was the first man from the club he'd ever let into his bed, everyone else had either been at their place or the club, or somewhere else, never here. Somehow this man had gotten Tony to trust him so much already.
Steve drove him to the club and let him go with a long kiss. "I'll be back for your show but I've got a few things I've got to do. See you then?" He said with a hopeful gaze.
"Hello Ladies and Gentleman." Tony began. He could see Steve at his table (the same he'd had that very first night) with a confused expression on his face. He knew how the act was supposed to go by now and it was clear he was wondering what Tony was up to.
Loki began to swing back and forth till he was flying over their heads in great arches. During one arch Thor reached up and, with the softest touch so as not to disturb Loki's flight, slipped a bill into the aerialist's thong.
"Now I know what you're all thinking. 'This guy couldn't be farther from a hulk of anything if he tried.' But I caution you ladies and gentlemen. Not all is as it seems." And with that the man disappeared in a flash of purple smoke, only to be replaced with a Huge man with green tinted skin and a purple speedo.
Tony gave him directions and they set off, Steve more than satisfied with how the night had gone already that he was almost considering letting the night end now. . . Almost.
Steve smiled again, "Alright, I'll see you after the show then. Oh, and my name's Steve by the way." He said as he gave a wave and walked back out to rejoin his friends.
Finally his name was called and Tony walked up the stairs to receive his diploma from the president of the university.
The man looked up as Steve approached surprise lighting up his eyes. "Oh, hello again." He said slowly.
"Careful there Sam." Natasha said mischievously, "Steve could actually turn into a tomato and then this will have all been for nothing."
Tony shot up in bed, looking over to the bed beside him and feeling panic shoot through him at the empty space.
"Just let me finish?" Tony said, shooting him a look. Steve nodded and let Tony continue. "The truth is I did go to college, I went to Cornell for a year, but then I made some friends, the bad kind. They got me drinking, smoking pot, and doing lines. And soon that's all I did, that summer when I went home I just sat in my room in a state of blissed out hell. My Dad found me like that and threw me out.
Tony looked at him for a moment before answering, an act Steve had now gotten used to. "Ah, sure. What did you have in mind?"
Tony led him through the club and out the back door into the alley. They walked in silence at first before Tony finally couldn't take it anymore.
"So did you drive to work or is it okay if we take my bike?" Steve asked as they crossed the street.
Tony was used to the burn, this wasn't his first rodeo. But he was not prepared for the way Steve somehow managed to hit his prostate dead-on so many times. It wasn't every time, but it was nearly.
As he took the stage moments later he didn't do his usual routine. Instead he took the mic early and motioned to Maria up in the sound booth to bring down the music.
"After I undressed him in front of an audience he asked me if I would like to go out to dinner after the show and I said sure." Tony answered.
Tony nodded, "Unless, I don't know, you want to come in?" He asked as noncommittally as possible, looking at Steve out of the corner of his eye as he fumbled with his keys. His heart skipped a beat when another of those pure-as-angel-tear's smiles flashed his way.
"Yep." Fury had said looking back down at his paperwork. "Said something about finally finding a worthy mate. My guess is that Odinson guy finally asked the bastard to marry him."
"Nothing, It's just. . . My friends like to tease me and they're in the lane next to ours. Just. . . don't let what they say get to you okay? they can be asses sometimes but they mean well, really."
Tony grinned back, "Maybe I am." He said as he lead Steve to the bedroom pausing when he reached the door.
"Um, When your show is over would you like to go get dinner with me?" Steve said in a single breath.
Steve glanced at Tony as they rented their shoes, He wasn't quite sure what to make of him. On stage he was every inch the performer and tease his profession required, but here now he seemed like just another guy. Sure he carried himself with a certain grace you didn't see in most men, and he held his head high as if he owned every place he walked into. But despite these few things he seemed . . . normal, and Steve wanted to treat him like he would any other guy he was interested in. He knew that he could get sex from Tony at a word and a flash of green, but he didn't want that. Because as naive as it might seem Steve was one of the few people left in the world who still believed sex was better if you actually loved the person you were having it with.
Tony scoffed but didn't move his hand. "If I quit I don't really have any other way to support myself."
Steve was having a hard time wrapping his head around the very image of this man and so almost missed the end of his speech.
When he landed face first on the stage he contemplated playing dead and hoped the very hot guy in the red and gold booty shorts would just kick him off the stage. But instead he was helped to his feet and led over to the other man.
"Well, now that I've gotten you fully disrobed, well almost. I will let you go." The man said, taking a step back.
It was Saturday morning, Steve didn't have to go to work and Tony of course wouldn't be working till late. So when Steve got up, instead of grabbing his pants and going, something Tony was still expecting to happen at any moment, he just walked into Tony's kitchen to make him breakfast. Tony hopped in the shower and when he got out 30 minutes later the smell of blueberry pancakes was emanating from the kitchen.
There was a moment of light clapping as music started. "First on the stage tonight." said Fury over the speakers. "Is S.h.i.e.l.d's very own Prince of Asgard, Loki is a renowned contortionist and magician."
"What about you?" Steve asked, "Is there something else you would like to do or are you happy with what you do now?"
"What is wrong with you?!" Howard shouted again, "You are an idiot, Tony! And I am done paying for you to lounge around at college smoking pot and getting drunk. You're wasting your life! I'm cutting you off. This is it, get out!" Howard shouted, grabbing a stunned Tony by the arm and throwing him out of the house.
After they ordered their food and found a table Tony started asking more questions. "So, do you work at one of the schools here?" He asked.
He'd just laughed and said that was the point, it was enough that he got the 'whore' treatment at work. He didn't want it in the streets. Not that he couldn't take care of himself if he needed to, it was just less of a hassle. And he liked these clothes anyway.
To pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and leave their pasts behind them. . . like glitter on the floor.
And now here he was, this was it. Steve didn't know what was coming. Tony wanted it to be a surprise.
He wasn't looking for anything, it was against his entire code to have sex with someone from a place like this. He did not want a one night stand, that would never work for him. Sure he would have sex on first date but only if he knew for certain the relationship would go somewhere.
Over the next five minutes Steve found himself holding his breath almost continually. Because not only did Loki have to wiggle free, he also had to make sure he didn't just slip out of the chains and fall to his death.
"Don't 'Dad I' me young man! Where did you get these?" He asked, shaking the bags of marijuana and coke and bottle of liquor in Tony's face.
Tony could barely catch his breath, stunned at Steve’s words. His heart raced, betraying him to Steve’s ears, and the chuckle at his ear was proof enough.
Steve waited breathlessly for a moment, wondering if Tony would try to steamroll over him with another interpretation of domestic bliss. The previous assaults still slid over Steve’s skin like a warm caress, and he stepped away from where he leant to stand at the edge of Tony’s table. He watched Tony’s head try to turn to the side, but he couldn’t quite make it all the way, so he righted it, facing Steve unerringly. Drool continued to trickle out of his open mouth, soaking into his goatee and the straps of the harness.
Tony shook his head slowly in bemusement, turning to shuffle towards the window. He’d found himself standing there more and more, in the same spot he’d seen Steve standing in when he’d first woken up. He tried not to think too far into it. He smiled humorlessly at the glass, his reflection barely visible as he focused on the outside view.
“Jarvis,” he croaked as he turned the sink on and splashed his face with water, trying to resist the urge to drown himself under the faucet.
Tony can feel him now. Steve’s presence is a solid wall of negative space slightly behind Tony’s right. He thinks wildly that he should run, but his legs won’t move.
“Eff!” Tony jerked and shuddered, tongue shoving against the ring as he tried to say Steve’s name, the grunt of it thick and wet.
“Yet,” Tony said, leaning back against the bar and rolling his head side to side to loosen up the tightness in his shoulders. “Jarvis will plow through the blockers soon enough. I’ve got him focused on that while Friday takes over D.C.”
He turned just as Steve’s palms slid up his stomach so they ended up on Tony’s back. Tony tipped his head back a little and kept the scowl from his face from practice. He covered Steve’s arms and traced the muscles there.
Tony rolled his eyes, hooking his cane on the booth back. He unrolled his silverware and wiped the napkin across the table before crossing his arms. Fury looked amused. Well, as amused as he could look when he wasn’t a smiler. He opened his mouth to say something snarky, but a shadow fell over the table as a peppy server bounced up to the raised section of the booths and greeted them.
Despite his initial lack of domestic skills, Tony was, above all else, a charmer. And after a month and a half of teaching Tony things like shopping and cleaning and, after the horrid shrunken shirt business, laundry, Steve found it was nice to be able to just relax and watch Tony do what Tony was good at. Charming people.
Natasha merely hummed, watching Stephanie closely. “Your eyes are very blue, like the sky, like the ocean. Both open and promising more of life.”
Tony absolutely didn’t flinch at the bluntness of Steve’s words. His tongue was sharp as he spit his own venom. “That day in the kitchen, you’re right, you asked me if I trusted you, and I said yes. That was the truth then. I did, and fuck, it was so true. It was
Tony swears under his breath then bites harder at Steve's mouth, and they kiss again, teeth clacking together with the force of it.
“You’re a…” Stephanie trailed off, staring at the elf with wide eyes. She didn’t mean to, but she’d just assumed the elf in the armory had been male. No one had ever...She’d never heard anything about Stark being
She started towards the soldier holding the elf. The cap the elf was wearing caught against the wooden planks and pulled free as he dropped down to catch the soldier in the balls with the heel of his hand.
The next day, he finds himself against a rocky outcropping, picking at strips of green fabric and wondering why his mouth refuses to make an ‘N’ when he should be more concerned about how high the snow goes. He thinks this is the longest it’s taken him to get through the alphabet, wonders if he’ll be able to form the letter ‘S’ when the snow takes him that far, wonders why he cares.
“That’s my cue, J. Take the car home?” he asked as the car pulled off the next exit. As it rounded the curve, Tony was already armored up and jetting off through the opening roof in the direction of the airport. The car continued on, the roof reclosing, and directing itself towards home.
Tony bucked his hips, the feelings still not enough for him. So Steve pulled off again. "Lube and condoms?" He asked.
When he went back to his room he quickly changed into his 'street clothes'. A pair of worn denim jeans and a black band t-shirt. Pepper used to always tell him that if she didn't know she never would have suspected he was a stripper or even Bi from his street clothes.
Tony waited nervously below the stage for Bruce to finish the intro to his act. Two weeks ago he'd gone to Fury's office as soon as he'd gotten into the building.
Tony grinned and spoke for the first time. "Well, friend for now." He said with a smirk and a look that made Steve blush.
"Good evening, Ladies, and Gentlemen." A Voice said from the smoke. It soon cleared and revealed a man in a plain black tux. Nothing seemed remarkable about him at all, Steve was seriously confused.
Suddenly a large metal egg rose from the center of the stage. and out stepped the owner of the voice.
And as Tony accepted the scroll he saw, all the way in the back, a sensibly dressed Fury. His heart swelled as he walked off the stage. And moments later when, with the rest of his classmates, he tossed his cap in the air and was quickly surrounded by his friends he felt his heart swell.
Next to them stood Sam and Clint, now partners in crime and two of the best friends Tony had ever seen.
Tony finished coughing and nodded looking up into Steve's eyes with that smile Steve had been looking for. The real smile he had known was there somewhere. Steve smiled and wondered if it was too soon to kiss him. His thoughts were interrupted however by Natasha.
Tony again waited nervously to take the stage. Only this time, instead of glittered hair, red and gold booty shorts, and stripper make-up, he was wearing a cap and gown and Steve's engagement ring on his finger. The blond had proposed to him last summer, and their wedding was already scheduled for this July, two weeks after Steve's birthday.
Steve is in the single chair on Pepper’s left, fingers curled to white in the expensive fabric of the chair’s arms. His eyes are almost closed, gaze darting between Bucky and Tony relentlessly.
All it took was one rippling shift of the cellular nanites in the suit, and Steve was like an untrained dog, rutting forward against Iron Man’s leg, grunting one curse then another as his motions dragged the metal rod against the alloy. Tony gave a mechanical hum and set the sounding rod off.
When, obviously, no request was forthcoming, Tony moved further forward into Steve’s space, forcing him upright once more. Tony didn’t stop there, and Steve felt the full length of Tony’s leg press against his body. The shifting hip panel bumped against the gag, jarring it between Steve’s teeth and displacing some of the drool that’d built up behind the ball. It eased out of the corners of his mouth to slide down his chin. He contained his whimper at that, but couldn’t when the rest of the leg settled into place, the alloy alternating from cool to warm in different sections where it pressed from Steve’s chest to groin.
“You’re here...now. You’re here…” Tony tugged at Steve’s shirt. “You couldn’t have known. No one… He… I didn’t want...I love you. I love-”
Scarlet Witch walked out of the warehouse with Frank right behind her. He wasn’t quite holding a hand against her lower back, but it was close. When the door shut behind them, Iron Man sighed heavily and began to relax.
Steve’s hands fisted in the sheets beside Tony’s shoulders, back bowing with his orgasm as he stuttered out a thrust or two more. He slumped into Tony, pressing sweat into sweat, heat and sticky semen spreading between them.
Jarvis’ response to that was lost in the echo of the trashcan, and then Tony was collapsing again, already blacking out as his body gave in against its fight to stay awake. Later, he was briefly aware of touch, of motion, heat all along his left side, but it was too much effort to surface, to pry his eyes open.
There isn’t much interaction Steve can parse through after that. The heroes are all too busy. The fight is brutal, expansive. Bucky and Steve are locked in hand-to-hand combat until Steve is distracted by a light as bright as he’d expect a supernova to be. Long before the cause is visible, Steve is deafened to everything but a high-pitched whistle before he sees Tony slam into the ground atop Carol. The force of it, aided by Captain Marvel’s power and Iron Man’s repulsors, craters the ground out around them, taking out the street and the buildings to their left.
Iron Man was quiet for a long moment then: “Fine,” he said, as Tony’s lip curled. He didn’t like letting Pierce ship those materials, but if that’s what it took to get Castle’s help… He could always ask Victor to keep a closer eye on them. If Victor chose to listen, and if he could depend on Castle to at least stick to his word.
“I’m still not letting you get me naked, Tony,” Steve said over his shoulder as he disappeared into the kitchen. “You should be pulling together all of your notes anyway. You left them all over the floor upstairs.”
They chose to go left outside of the Amara’s, walking with only a little space between them. Steve was a solid wall of heat on Tony’s right side, and he found it very distracting. His fingers twitched, and he wanted to reach out and hold Steve’s hand, but just shoved them in his pockets to avoid the temptation. A few moments later, Steve followed suit.
Here is it, ChibiSquirt! I'm so sorry it took so long! I want to thank everyone who has been with me to the end of this journey. Thank you to everyone who helped, who cheerleaded, and my amazing artists.
Tony didn’t get to finish his sentence as Steve’s hands cupped his face and tilted him up into a kiss. His grip on Tony’s jaw was gentle, easy, but his mouth was intense, a demanding pressure that Tony could’ve melted under. As it was, he did part his lips, let Steve’s tongue sweep in along his own, deep, claiming. The moan, when Tony heard it, was shaky and his own.
Tony poured the scotch into his glass until it just kissed the rim. “Don’t judge me,” he muttered to Victor, to anyone really, and bent a little to slurp the whiskey away from the top of glass. Successfully stopping any risk of spillage that way, he picked up his drink and turned around.
“Missing persons,” Tony supplied. He stepped past Steve when they reached his car. Opening the door, he turned to face Steve. “Activists. Rioters. Disagreeables, I think Pierce once called them. Anyone old enough to buck utopia’s system. If they aren’t old enough, then their parents.”
“You keep saying that, Tony, but you’ve got no proof. Director Pierce has done nothing to try and get to you since you’ve been here. There’s no sabotage, no funny business, nothing. Your theory is drowning in dead weight with nothing to support it.”
Steve licks and sucks at Tony's cock, the tip of his tongue tracing every vein and throb until he finally, finally, presses the flat of it against the underside and closes his mouth around the head. He pulls Tony's hips up just as he starts sucking at the tip, and Tony can barely keep the moan from being embarrassingly loud.
“You know, I’m getting really tired of you trying to kill my boyfriend,” Steve growled. He stood, the bloodstain spreading down from his shoulder along his spine. Tony started scrambling at the chains wrapped around his legs.
He pushes away from the docking station of the Mark VI and the wheels on his stool squeak once as he wheels over to the closest table between Steve and him. He folds his arms over the tabletop and rests his chin on them, watching Steve with a fond smile.
“Aye, because of me. If it wasn’t for me, your father would’ve drowned you the second you were old enough to speak with that smart mouth of yours.”
Tony leaned back against the glass of the elevator carriage and looked down over his shoulder as the hangar came into view.
“Not a problem, Sam. Can I call you Sam? Or do we need to keep this strictly professional?” Tony smiles and shakes Sam’s hand.
Stark’s lip curled faintly and stepped forward to reach for a lock of the General’s hair that had fallen from the tight bun. Tucking it behind Peggy’s ear, Stark said, “It’s this smart mouth that’s kept me alive here. And it’s this,” Stark poked Peggy’s chest, “that keeps me here. I hope this plan of yours doesn’t backfire,
'Stop' he mutters to himself as he yanks the drawer open and stares at the multitude of cards sliding around loose.
“I see he put up a fight,” Tony comments, crouching down to turn Steve’s face one way, then the other. His nose is busted, his left eye swollen shut.
“Eugh, Tony,” Pepper says in return, but she’s smiling and Tony kind of wants her to rub her hands together deviously.
Tony couldn’t even open his eyes then, but the beat was softer. It didn’t hurt as much. Ty must have finally turned it down. He should thank him.
Steve’s world went a little fuzzy, but he didn’t care because he was sliding into Tony and it was hot and tight and he sounded so good. He slid his hands up from Tony’s ass to map his spine, frowning as the skin beneath his palms felt supple, too smooth. The body in his lap, rocking and grinding was too lithe, too lean, and Natasha’s expression was furrowed in concentration. Her mouth parted on a husky sigh, and it startled Steve enough that he woke up in the quiet of his darkened room.
“Tony!” Steve cries. “TonyTonyTony.” He’s chanting, clearly overwhelmed and yet, still conscious of his hips. Tony’s so proud of him.
Tony is away from the desk now, sliding a hand along Pepper's jaw and cupping her face as he kisses her. She's pressing back into the suit, and Jarvis imagines the rustle of her attractive suit catching against his seams and angles. The mechanics of one of his hands twitches, and Pepper breaks the kiss to look down at his hand.
“Vy khotite ispol'zovat' naruchniki?” he asks, and receives only an absent nod as Tony strides over to the window across from where Steve will hang.
Natasha was grinning as she got up to check the food on the stove and Bucky groaned quietly as they continued hashing out their weekly plans.
"You're not cleared to be out here, Stark," and that wasn't Steve -it hadn't been since Tony had woken up- it was clearly Captain America ordering him back inside the base.
There was a mask over his face when awareness tried to take control again. It pumped fresh oxygen into him, leaving him lightheaded. His vision swam as he turned his head towards the noise beside him. There was a woman there, dark-haired with glasses. She was holding a folder, and when he tried to lift a hand to the mask covering his face, she glanced at him and the rattle of metal connecting his wrist to the bed frame.
“Three people do not a meeting make, Stark. There were a lot of people who didn’t show. Can you blame me?”
He dreamt of a carousel and a lion chasing a polar bear, a cheetah leaping beyond them both. It spun and spun until the polar bear was sinking, sinking, sinking into the dark depths of the frigid waters. And Tony lie on the bow, a gauntleted hand still outstretched towards the water. Behind him, Steve’s displeasure and disgust were evident.
Steve tensed then straightened back to look at Tony sheepishly. His smile was endearing and Tony wanted to punch him in the face.
He doesn’t know where those words had come from, but they’d earned him a bruising backhand and a ban from Howard’s lab for a week for sassing. He’d cried into his mother’s dressing gown as she’d returned him to his bed.
“I know you’re listening, because you can’t do anything else,” Steve said through the clench of his teeth, the ticking muscle in his jaw, “Tony, I’m going to say this once. Give in. Now.”
“Have you need of a doctor?” Steve tries again and the man groans and brazenly uses Steve’s shoulder as a bracing post to get to his feet. Steve rises with him, gaze resigned about his need to make sure the stranger is okay, but weary with the prospect of having to deal with him. It has been a long day for him, after all.
The flames engulfing Crossbones’ head brought Iron Man up short. He cut power to his repulsors, dropping to the ground and bringing his hands up to fire just as Crossbones shot a beam from his face.
Tony doesn’t flinch, but his face is covered in Pepper’s blood as the bullet tears through her and cuts across his cheek before it disappears into the night.
“I just wanted to make sure you were okay. You are, right? Okay, I mean.” But Steve’s expression was off, almost distant, and Tony’s senses were starting to pick up into protective instincts. “I-I won’t ask to come in, because you should rest, but-”
“Jay, blow this up, focus on the left gauntlet.” Tony climbed out of his seat to get closer to the screen where the proposed Iron Man was poised mid-flight.
Steve’s gaze darkened and filled with tears, and he tugged his chair close in, so he could stroke a hand through Tony’s hair. “You’re okay. I promise you. We’ll get through this. He can’t hurt you anymore.”
The argument, for their voices had gotten very loud by that point, faded to a buzz of conversation that Tony couldn’t quite decipher. He kicked off the wall to take the few steps across the hall to the windows. Looking out over D.C., Tony felt a lying sense of peace. The cherry blossoms were bright and pink and filling the air with their thick, floral scent. Tony knew, though, how much of a lie it really was. If one got close enough to the trees, they’d see the browning petals, the buds dying that would never get the chance to be full blooms. They would see the ground littered in a graveyard smeared over pink and yellow.
So fucking grateful that he doesn't mind being shoved up against a wall again, but this time they're chest-to-chest, and Steve's smile tastes like margaritas and the promise of a good ride.
to touch me with the hands that caved my father's face in and pulled the goddamn trigger against his head. And you were happy." Tony slinks into Steve's space, movements manic, tone wet and hollow with suppressed rage. Steve can't speak; his tongue is too thick, his throat too raw.
“The evacuation has caused panic, but the civilians are complying with personnel. There are two planes still connected for boarding in Terminal B. Sir, the core material has eroded at too rapid a pace. Meltdown imminent. You must retreat to a safer distance.”
Time comes to a standstill. Rhodey doesn’t blink, but his mouth moves silently as Pepper frantically retracts her helmet and begins prying at the shield in panic. Blood wells up around where the edges of the damaged suit slice into Rhodey’s throat. Rhodey doesn’t want Pepper to cry. He lifts a hand towards her. The suit is heavy.
“You’re letting your feelings blind you to the situation. He wasn’t the only one at the accident, and we both know it wasn’t a hit-and-run, so where’s the other person? A body? Anything!”
Tony startled as two bots were dropped on the table in front of him, and he blinked at them through the screen of data he’d been viewing. The sounds of the SHIELD employees going about their day drowned out again as the door to his claimed lab finally slid shut again.
“Come meet me. I’m going to bring in our strongest weapon,” Ronin interrupted, disappearing in the shadows between buildings.
“I’ll be by in the morning,” he promised, walking towards the door as he pulled his coat on and buttoned the two middle buttons.
Tony feels like a monster, like a toxic sludge that’s sucking Steve down and he wants to tell Steve to run, to save himself.
“Yes,” replied Tony, “It was the twentieth anniversary this past December. The city threw them a huge celebration on my dime. I don’t doubt for a minute that Pierce didn’t stay long. It’s hard to stomach when you know the truth, and the people don’t. They celebrate brilliance and forward thinking, and they mourn senseless death at the hands of alcohol. They shake their heads and whisper behind their hands about how ‘it’s such a shame he got himself and his wife killed drunk driving.
“I was supposed to save the world,” Tony slurred, sedated. He stared at crisp white sheets above his wrist and wriggled phantom fingers.
Needless to say, Steve and Bucky are both surprised when Tony confronts them in their bedroom that evening.
He tested into MIT when he turned twelve. And by the time the first day of the school year rolled around, he’d made himself his own prosthetic. It was silver and more Terminator than functional, but it was the first project he’d finished on his own that worked flawlessly.
“Skip the origin story. I want present day,” Tony interrupted, settling his hands on the wheel and taking control of the car. He pushed the sleek vehicle faster through the D.C. traffic, heading for Dulles Airport (IAD).
Steve doesn’t brush off the reminder. He knows how serious they both are about the safety of it. He nods once, twice and let’s the air he’d been holding out in a soft, long breath.
Tony had to force himself -and seriously, he’d examine that thoroughly later- to avoid the date-like setting of dinner with the Captain. He made a thoughtful noise, like sucking breath through his teeth.
“If this is the long game, then I need to decide if how I feel about him is worth more than what he’s done,” Steve finally answered, quiet but firm.
“You will always be Titanborn,” Natasha said, cutting her off. She opened a chest near the forge flame and hefted out large weapon.
Bucky drags himself upright, and there’s a gun in his hand. Tony punches in a code, and the chamber begins to fill with a cryogenic solution. Steve can’t hold his breath, can’t do anything but let it happen as Tony uses a small adhesive disk to destroy the buttons of the console.
“Excuse me?” Steve blinked and actually took a step away from the tables and the Iron Man suit that was standing at the door. “Why would I do that? Why would you want me to do that? You spent months fighting me to get it back!”
Tony scribbled note after note along Steve’s spine, words and bars taking up the broad expanse of his muscles. He worked on it for another hour until the words finally stopped scrolling behind his eyes. He capped and tossed the marker and sank back against Steve’s side, sighing in satisfaction. He kissed Steve’s shoulder, lips going slack as he fell asleep.
“You leave me in here, and I won’t make it to a prison cell. Pierce won’t risk leaving me alive,” Tony said flatly, choosing to split his attention between Steve’s rising frustration and feeling out the bandages around his head. He saw Steve’s gaze dart to his hands, and there was a moment where Tony thought Steve might reach out to pull his hands away, but he didn’t.
“Come on, Howard. He’s just a boy,” a smooth voice interrupted. Tony’s hackles raised instantly at Pierce’s voice, and he longed to yank away from Howard and run and run and never stop.
“You save everyone you can, and yeah, that’s not always everyone, but I’ve seen all your tapes, all the footage. And God, why can’t you see this yourself?! Tony, you care more than most of the agents in this base. If you didn’t- If you didn’t, you wouldn’t have stopped the doctors.”
“It’s fine. I’m fine,” Steve promised against Tony’s fingers. “I don’t go anymore unless I really have to. This, this isn’t one of those times, but I could use your help bandaging it.”
Tony's mouth was hot and wet, and the suction was tight, sliding along Steve's shaft like Tony could drag Steve's orgasm out of him with one powerful twist of his tongue. He was looking at Steve through his lashes, gaze dark and hungry.
“You, Tony Stark, really aren’t that good of a liar,” he pointed out, unable to help the fondness coloring his tone.
Tony winced at the volume of Steve’s voice, and Steve immediately shrank back, hunched in on himself. Tony reached for him, or intended to, until realized his left hand was heavy.
Bucky is on Tony’s right, forced to sit up much straighter in a chair from the dining room set. His control is being tested more, ensuring that he doesn’t snap the fragile wood of the arms under the strain.
Tony could deal with Steve breaking his heart, could deal with Steve proving himself to be just like everyone else. But he really couldn’t deal with losing his faith in superheroes, couldn’t lose his faith in the living legend who’s stubborn will would probably save the world one day when Tony wasn’t around to see it anymore.
“Because someone has to,” Steve replied softly, and he could see some of Tony’s anger deflate from his posture. “Look around us, Tony. There aren’t… There aren’t that many of us. This world needs all the help it can get. And even I know I’m not enough, but I’m trying. I’m trying to do what’s right and what’s good and save a little of this planet for the ones who come to fill our shoes. I thought…”
“No touching,” Tony reminds him, backing away and watching as Steve starts to crawl backwards up the big bed.
Tony is reeling, so aroused that the drunkenness seems like an afterthought. He turns his wrist to get a better hold and then shakes Steve's hand off to work the plug himself.
It goes on this way through the rest. Each death is methodical, calculated, and effective, breaking Steve over and over until even the asset feels it behind his ribcage. But this morning…
“Uh yeah? I aced it so I didn’t have to keep doing it.” Tony snorted like it was obvious, and Pepper just rolled her eyes.
“Oh, that’s… I probably have a spare in the car,” Tony hedged, hooking a thumb back towards the elevator. He laughed slightly, “I’ve always got that crap lying around, you know.”
Steve buries his face in Tony's throat and begins moaning like he's being paid for it, and he could expect payment after this, but Tony doesn't give a fuck, because he's going to make Steve come on his cock alone and then he's going to pull out, rip the condom off and come on his perfect fucking face.
“I honestly don’t see why I should even bother, brother. He’s obviously freed himself of most of the bindings. I’m sure the rest are no problem for him.”
Pepper's hair is coming loose from the tight bun she'd had it in, and Jarvis' hands are pressed against her stomach and hip, helping her remain upright as Tony watches from between her legs.
“All I can ask is that you consider it,” Iron Man replied, head turning towards her. “And I do ask, Scarlet. That you even came…”
“The news said there were at least fifty bodies in the containers,” Hydra Bob helpfully informed, “not to mention the employees. Most of them were dissenters that had been previously reported missing.”
Steve woke up on the cold concrete of a warehouse floor. He kept his eyes closed, taking in the bruised, hot feeling of his skin and the way it felt stretched too tightly over his bones. The weight of a metal muzzle framed his jaw and kept his head pinned to magnet in the floor.
There was a soft chuckle and a ruffle of Tony's hair before she sat his food in front of him. Beneath the table, Tony kicked his leg, but only slightly, because he was six in two days, and six-year-olds were meant to be above that sort of childish behavior. But he delighted in the colors of the light matching his Fruity Pebbles, an indulgence his mother let him have.
“I don’t want to embarrass them,” she decides and Tony leans back against his desk as he adjusts his tie. “They need to learn restraint.”
The breeze tries to take the slip of paper. And Steve lets it. Lets the words 'Return to Sender' go with the first choked-off sob as he buries his face in his hands.
“Sir, if you’d please, my rooms are just on Praed Street. If I may assist you there, my valet will fetch a physician for you,” he said. “I’d like to see that you’re taken care of.”
“He prefers his professional setting,” Pepper says, and Tony can hear the smile in her voice as he cradles the phone between his shoulder and ear. He’s covered in grease, his hands buried in the wires of the Mark 42. “Though, he was quite agreeable to blocking out your appointment. So you won’t have to deal with other clients. Are you sure you want to do this? Monsieur Moreau will be devastated if he finds out you went somewhere other than La Rukico.”
A reporter was speaking from offscreen, a different language to the English captions that lagged five seconds behind their speech. Steve didn’t need those, though. He understood exactly what was happening. The East Coast was welcoming its first official candidate for office against the incumbent Pierce since he’d stepped in to take charge.
“Daruĭte!” he called down to the bartender. When she looked over, he held up his empty glass. “Dva? Bud’ laska.”
It came to him then, sudden and staggering. The sorcerer that had mind fucked him the day before, the green light that had pushed the blue of his own wider and stronger than it should’ve been.
“You brought me into this without asking, so I’m not asking. You’ll strip and do as Tony says then meet in the living room. Do we understand each other.”
His coding trips and tangles when Tony shifts sharply, causing Pepper to cry out in pleasure, and purposely moves one of the suit's hands between Pepper's legs.
Tony turns around, closing his pants up, in enough time to see the man suck his fingers clean. He straightens his jacket and strides out of the alley with the man strolling out behind him.
“To happy endings,” Sam quipped, toasting the bottle the bartender brought as Steve could only offer a laugh in return before draining his shot and smacking the glass down to the bar.
Steve was quiet, then he pulled Tony into a hug. He waited until Tony finally brought his arms up, too, to return the gesture before he spoke.
“I’m not trying to butter you up or whatever crazy idea just went through your head, so just cool your jets,” Fury smirked, “I just don’t like Taco Tuesday.”
“Fighting with the overwhelming smell of shrimp in the air is not the same thing,” Tony replied archly, “In fact, I think it only encourages the consumption of seafood. We could order in, make a picnic of it.”
, got stuck in his head. He kept his back to the restaurant doors and waited for the maitre d’ to return to elegant podium.
Tony doesn’t need to be told twice. He’d face the wrath of welching on a bet over pissing Pepper off anymore any day. He shuffles into the bathroom, leaving the door open to hear her say, “They’re dead. I’m going to kill them with my bare hands.”
“They what?!” Tony exclaimed, heart pounding in his ears. His vision swam with it, and all he wanted to do was to fly to SHIELD then and kill them all. Steve’s lips pressed against Tony’s fist, drawing his attention.
The man stepped out and seeing the job was done, clapped his hands together. “That was fast! Now that you’re done, bring your bike into the yard where it will be safe and come on inside.”
“Well I’m glad it didn’t come to that,” Laura told him, looking concerned. “Surely your parents would’ve helped?”
“Tell you what,” Tony offered, leaning next to him on the table. “I win the next one, and I get a kiss.”
Vision suddenly popped free of the cart with a whoosh, and Tony only had a moment to feel a rush of triumph before he felt two strong hands on his calves, and he was yanked out from under the cart with a squawk.
When the rain finally stopped, they headed out again, making for the sea. Tony had only ever seen the sea once on a holiday as a kid, so he’d known that when he picked his town it would have to be on the coast. The idea of waking up every day to the beautiful blue water was high on his list.
“After you?” the woman said, rolling her eyes. “Someone’s tooting their own horn. But I agree about Miss Carter.”
“What the fuck? What the ACTUAL fuck,” Tony swore staring up at the sky, as the helicopter flew off into the distance.
“I do. Seems to me like some folk around here need to be shown I married the most accomplished omega in the East.”
The man stared and then snorted. “Oh wow, really? That was old when I—“ he stopped changing track. “I mean, that’s a bit of a cliche.”
“Oh I see.” Tony tugged off his cloak, folding it by the door before grabbing his own bowl of stew. He went to sit by the kids but Stíofán reached out, pulling him to perch on his knee.
“Your Cap boots have lifts! It’s basically the same thing, stop whining.” Bucky adjusted the lens. “Now lean up against the wall since you’ve got the balance of a baby deer, and try to flirt with the camera.”
As he got close to the pen, several of the fauns came to the forefront, leaning on the fencing to better show off their assets. Stíofán could see several pairs of fine furred legs, flashing beneath fine silks, and finely polished hooves and horns. They were all very fine, Stíofán thought. If these were the ones the Stables rejected, he couldn’t imagine what the higher-level ones looked like. Some of the more brazen ones wagged their tails, making it clear they were ready to mate, and Stíofán was forced to breathe through his mouth to keep the desire from shooting south.
(Minor Warning: Tony and Steve experiment with roleplay (including some very light humiliation) - it's spur of the moment so they do not discuss it beforehand, but they're in a loving, trusting relationship so both feel safe and able to stop proceedings if they need to, and a good time is had by all)
“Gets into a lot of fights huh?” Tony asked, as Bucky entered the fray, pulling one of the bigger guys off the pile.
- fuck, you know what? Drop the duster. Here.” He handed Steve the bottle of champagne. “Spill this over your tits.”
He felt his eyes burn with tears, and though he tried to hide, when his alpha pulled back with a flushed, roguish grin, it dropped from his face when he took in Tony’s expression. “Are you alright?”
He didn’t even look at Tony as he headed into the bookshop and through to the apartment stairs. When he got to the living room he packed his clothes into his duffel, all the while trying to memorise every single detail. He was happy here, like he hadn’t been since he’d woken up, hell, since before Bucky had died.
Reminded of the fight, Stíofán felt the energy still bursting beneath his skin, seeking an outlet. Stíofán stepped forward, wrapping an arm loosely around the doe’s waist, pulling him up against his chest. “Well, I had a good incentive. I don’t think I’ve seen a more beautiful doe in my life.”
He kissed a little longer but pulled away when Steve tried to push for more. Steve rolled onto his side, almost pouting, which was flattering. And cute. “Uh, uh, uh, come on, up. I want pancakes.”
Sam waved his hands reassuringly. “Alright Sheriff, no need to growl. Bucky didn’t mean it, did you, Buck?”
Steve was looking at him with a slight frown on his face and, now Tony could see him clearly, an undercurrent of hurt. “How do you have that?”
Tony felt the rest of his anger slip away and sighed. “It’s alright. Yes, you should’ve told me you were safe, but you’re right too. Being married is new for both of us, and there are bound to be some bumps in the road. I just didn’t like feeling so helpless.”
Steve reached out, and Tony let himself be tugged into the alpha’s lap. “I know you don’t blame me for being away when Peter was sick--”
He’d seen Ana do this. It couldn’t be that difficult. He placed the bristles on the floor and swung the handle to brush against the wood. He began to sweep, the dirt and dust collecting in little piles. He gathered it all into the kitchen before he deftly swept it out the front door and out into the garden.
Steve walked forward, carrying Tony with ease. He closed the bedroom door behind them, not even bothering with the light as they tumbled onto the bed.
Eventually, the creak of the door announced Steve’s arrival, and it took everything in him not to squirm in anticipation. The alpha stripped down to his long johns and climbed into bed. Steve rolled to his side, like he did every night, and his arm came over to hold Tony against him, just like every night, except this time-
“I told you,” Natasha said with a raised eyebrow. “The plant on my window sill. That’s the important one.”
It was a great, hulking beast, heavyset muscles beneath the thick fur and the sharp teeth glistening. Stíofán charged forward, swinging his sword. The manticore swatted at him, an angry roar ripping from its throat. He used the shield to block, the claws making a horrible sound as they scraped down the metal. He slashed at the legs, managing to catch the edge of one and drawing a shallow wound.
“Yeah, course we can.” He took Tony's hand, leading him away, and called to Sam on his way past. “You got this?”
“I don’t like Sca’ fever,” he grumbled against Steve’s shoulder as they headed over to hitch a ride in Sam’s cart.
They had to get home. It was getting dangerous. And for some reason, Tony couldn’t help but see Steve’s hopeful face in his mind, waiting for him outside the bakery for the party. He was going to think Tony stood him up on purpose and that...didn’t feel good.
“We have training most of the day, then time spent with the doctor to check our health, then the evening meal. Then those of us who have been here a year or more are allowed to spend some time in the meal room before bed.” He rubbed his hand gently over Tony's lower back. “Not every
Tony laughed, half amused, half relieved. “Not at all Sheriff. I am as eager to make sure our match is above board as you are, so we might get started on getting to know each other.”
“None of that.” Tony chided. “You said last night it wasn’t my fault, I remember, so it’s not your fault either. Can we agree on that?”
Steve wolfing down breakfast on his couch while Tony sipped his coffee was becoming a familiar ritual, and Tony soaked it in, their hands tangled together between them.
“I don’t know what you're doing, but off the wood pile now please,” Stíofán said, watching a few of the poles shift.
“Tony!” His mother called, looking proud. They might not always have gotten along as Tony wished, but witchcraft was the one thing that had allowed them to bond, that his mother understood about him in its entirety, and the times spent learning the craft from her were his favourite memories. “I can’t believe it’s time for you to go! It’s only yesterday you were charming flowers to grow in the back garden.”
“It is,” Tony sniffed. “Doesn’t mean you couldn’t do something stupid and noble.” He flinched at the blood on Stíofán’s cheek. “You’re hurt, we need to—“
Tony shuddered, and Steve gave him a squeeze. “Nurse Banner says we have to head back to the house.”
“I'm just worried that Tony’s still sore about the other day, " Steve admitted. "He was really angry. And I get it, but I know I was in the right too. I do have to be careful not to show favourites, but if he’d told me there was something else going on I would have reacted differently. I don't know Sam. It's just difficult being a good Alpha and also the Sheriff when you know people are always looking for a reason to question you."
“It looks like some big grown-up omega lives here,” Pops said, looking around exaggeratedly. “That can’t be right, what happened to the little pup who wanted to sell all her stuff and go live in the woods?”
Bucky wiped a hand across his face, looking around the studio. “Maybe you should sit down? Or we could try the one in front of the fireplace -”
They worked for a little longer, managing to get the base structure down. Tomorrow they’d have to start building the frame - based on Tony’s design, which had endeared him to the village for its success at keeping out the cold and the rain. They set to stripping the wood they’d need for the poles with their horns.
Tony sighed, closing his eyes for a moment, before turning back and opening his mouth to speak to Steve. However, instead of seeing all those muscles up close, he instead caught sight of Steve sprinting away down the street. That guy was in a hurry - he almost took out an old lady who waved an annoyed umbrella at him - and disappeared around the corner before Tony could even really register what he was seeing.
As soon as they hit the park though he relaxed, and let Peter lead him excitedly over to the fenced-off area that acted as the dog park. Peter was nearly vibrating, squealing when they got close enough to see the dogs. “Daddy look!”
Antonius seemed to fall into the rhythm, dragging and sucking, hot and tight and Stíofán couldn’t do much more than grunt. “Use your hands, come on sweetheart.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “I’ll see you soon. Get home safe.” He looked around for a moment before ducking closer. “I love you.”
Steve drove off with one last wave, and headed for the way out of town. As he reached the corner, he looked back to see Edwin watching from the porch. The old man gave him one last wave, then disappeared inside.
Tony snorted. “You didn’t have to. I’ve seen the looks you give some of the bigger families in town.”
“And I was kind of shocked, since my words are kind of specific but I said, ‘This is an animal shelter, not a toy store’ and then we did the whole soul glow thing. Freaked the cats out a bit but it all worked out.”
“Well, it’s just,” Tony ran a hand through his hair. “Bruce said that the reason your heat came on so fast was because you were near a compatible alpha. You know, me. I'm the compatible alpha.”
He moved to a chair near the ticket office and took a seat. He’d wait for the crowd to thin, and hopefully, the alpha would find him.
Tony’s eyes widened, and he walked over to take the files that were sliding off the top. “How are you carrying all this?”
He was checking one of the shelves for baking powder when a group of omegas entered the store, chatting in hushed voices. Tony was tucked away from view, and they clearly hadn’t seen him, as it became pretty obvious what they were talking about.
Stíofán watched him go, anger still bubbling, but left it. Instead, he knelt down brushing a hand over Tony’s horns. “You think that’ll teach him?”
Stíofán sheathed his sword, and grit his teeth. He took a few steps back, digging his hooves into the dirt. He took off at a run towards the edge, launching himself off the edge. As he neared the other side, he slashed the shield into the wall. The sharp round edge cut into the dirt, sticking fast. Stíofán clung to his keeping his legs out of reach of the snakes, who snapped and hissed at his hocks. He heaved himself up, digging his hooves in and forcing himself over the edge. He moved fast to dislodge the shield, knowing he wouldn’t have much time before the fighters moved in.
on the other side, their shields and swords raised in preparation. And behind them, the final challenge. A great winged manticore, it’s strong lion body pulling against its binding, the scorpion tail swishing in challenge as it roared.
Tony opened his mouth to answer when there was a shout from the back. The man smiled again, holding up a finger. “Sorry, just a minute.”
But she also knew that if she got into trouble or if the same thing happened to her, she’d be welcomed home with open arms.
Tony pushed a strand of Stíofán’s blond hair behind his horn. “I’m glad I have you. And I’m glad our kid will have you to protect them.”
“True enough. Though I’m sure you’ll get a hefty discount on the new linen-cleaning device, once Tony gets it off to patent.”
“Yes. Flirt, Cap. Trust me, there are a handful of rich widowed omegas who’d love to shove money in your tux for hungry orphans or puppies who need operations. You just have to sweet talk them a little, maybe bounce those pecs of yours.”
There was a pressure at his entrance, bigger than the two fingers he’d had previously. He expected pain, but while the stretch burned at the beginning, the sensation of fullness took over, and Tony felt the weight of his alpha press him into the bed.
Antonius shook his head. “We share large quarters with many of us all together. Before this, I shared a sleeping mat with two others.”
He could barely feel his fingers as he wrapped them tighter in his coat, the raindrops settling on his lashes. He tried to think of something else, anything to take his mind off the cold, and his head filled with memory, the ball at Mr Rhodes’.
“I could--” Tony began because this was his chance. If he could show Steve he could be good at it, maybe Steve would think again about having intimate relations.
Next, he went for the framed poster hanging on the wall - Cap enthusiastically promoting war bonds - taking it down and placing it on the floor, the image hidden. He grimaced at the large shield floor rug but tossed his coat over it, hoping that would be enough. Then he looked at the replica shield, his prized possession, and grabbed it carefully before wrapping it in a towel and hiding it in the shower.
Tony felt a little better, taking a few more bites of the sweet bread. “I’m going to do better. I swear it.”
Tony huffed. If Rogers was only going to be friendly once he knew Tony was a witch, he had another thing coming.
It was still dark, and he could see the moon still high in the sky through the gap in the curtain. He frowned, his hand moving till he came into contact with the source of the heat.
“Thankfully only a little harm done,” Tony told him kindly. “But since there has been a little harm, perhaps I could persuade you to rest up?”
Mr Rogers was of course free to come and go as he pleased from the estate when he wasn’t teaching, so he would often take a walk to town. It was on one such walk that Tony himself had business in town and had ridden to meet with the banker.
Tony swallowed, his eyes caught on the way the guy’s muscles shifted beneath his too-tight shirt. He cleared his throat. “Steve. Right. Yes, as long as you ask Steve if it’s ok to pet Dodger.”
Tony felt a swell of relief, glad they were on the same page as he nodded. “Yes. Please yes. I’ve missed you too. I hated being without you.”
Tony kept walking not wanting to be seen. He didn’t need that rubbed in his face by some Wall Street-hopeful jackass.
“Except she’s expecting a cat to hold,” Pepper explained, waving her phone in the air. “And we don’t have a cat.”
“You there, big guy,” he called, approaching the man worryingly stroking a semi-automatic. “You think we can get some more water? I’m parched.”
Steve gestured down the street. “There’s a park just over there. Maybe we could take a walk, finally get to actually talk?”
The alpha rocked back on his heels, then seemed to realise something. “Where are my manners? Here let me take your bag.” He took the carpet-bag, hefting it without any effort whatsoever. “Are you ready to go?”
“I got mine too,” J.J said, sliding an envelope over. “I got it a few days ago, but I wanted to wait till Riri got hers. Didn’t want it to be awkward.”
“Oh sure, well congrats! That’s such great news.” He gave them both a hug, revelling in how happy they both seemed.
Tony snorted. “It’s fine, he knows. He swapped all his best pieces for cheaper ones that looked the part and left them in plain view for her.” He nodded his head towards another man in the opposite corner. “Over there, that’s Mr Loki Odinson, second son to Lord Odinson. He tried to marry a young heiress for her fortune, all the while knowing his brother had been courting her. It was a huge scandal, neither brother talking to the other. I imagine his older brother wasn’t unable to attend or he’d never show his face here.”
“Yea-NO! Uh, I mean it’s broken, sorry.” He picked up a jumper and began to tug it on. He heard the sound of Steve rolling onto his back. He struggled to find the head hole, and so it took a moment for him to realise Steve had spoken.
Tony snorted. “I’m sure there’ll be lots of different ones. And they’ll all be fluffy and love playing with little boys. As long as..?”
Sam waved at him. “Damn, Steve, when you said your boy could shoot, I admit I had doubts. But he’s a crack shot.”
“What you got there is basil. I buy the fresh plants because they taste better than the dried ones.” She shrugged. “Then I toss them out.”
There was another rattle, quieter this time, and then it faded away. Steve came over to them, still holding Dodger tight. “You guys ok?”
“Of course. Do call me Steve, nothing would please me more.” he looked a little shy then, but determined. “And might I call you Anthony?”
“Mrs Wilson told me it’s important for healing.” Tony grabbed the basin of water and a cloth and placed it on the bedside table. Then he began to unbutton Steve’s shirt.
And well, Tony considered himself a pretty capable guy, but there was something kind of...hot about knowing your boyfriend had just beaten up a bunch of guys to rescue you. He felt like he should ask about them, about what this meant for them now: could they have a future after all? But what came out instead was, “so how much can you lift anyway?”
“It’s not impossible. I can do it. I will, for you, and for them. Our kid will be born free in my homeland, Tony I swear it.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Tony agreed, watching as the door closed behind her. He moved over to Steve’s desk perching on the corner. “What was all that about?”
Tony stumbled back to Pepper, letting her pull him down to rest on her lap as his head began to ache all over. At least his people were safe.
Tony figured he was probably a little sensitive about his height, so he changed the subject. “We’ll be working together then?”
But, he trusted Fury’s word. If he failed, Tony and the kid would be free, and he could leave them his saved coin and a letter for his Ma so she could take them in.
He got to his hooves, wetting the rag once more and offering it to the doe who looked up at him with those dark eyes. “Clean yourself. I’ll fetch our meal.”
Tony pulled away, just far enough to press another kiss to Steve’s forehead before he sat up, putting some distance between them.
Stíofán rolled his eyes. “Well, it would certainly mean I didn’t have to worry you’d been skewed by a hot poker or knocked by a stray hammer.”
Steve walked up quietly, nodding to Dr Banner, who patted Steve’s shoulder on the way out and pulled the door almost all the way closed, leaving them alone.
There was a wet feeling between his legs. It wasn’t entirely new, but the times it had happened before had been few and far between. And he’d certainly never had it happen while he’d had a strong, strapping alpha between his thighs.
“I know, I know,” the one called Rhodey said, biting his thumb. “We called the repair guy, but who knows when he’ll get here.”
Tony sipped his tea as she put it all into a basket. He wondered if she had any tonics for attracting an alpha – something that would drive the Sheriff wild, tearing off his clothing and taking him till he was satiated. He shifted in his seat. No, he couldn’t admit they were having troubles, even if she might be able to tell. He hoped the Sheriff’s scent from sharing a bed would cover it, though if someone was sniffing for it, it’d likely be obvious. He couldn’t ask. He felt too fragile for that kind of shame, and Natasha clearly held Steve in high esteem, so no doubt she’d recognise he must be at fault.
Bucky bit back a snort, hurrying into the elevator before he could get an earful of his best friend getting it on. Maybe Sam would be up for a beer or something. He only turned back for a two-fingered salute, already planning to get a high five at breakfast tomorrow.
Steve had worked in several houses, with a number of children born into wealth, and although he often bonded with them, their parents usually remained aloof. They were kind enough to him, treated him well and gave him nice accommodations, but rarely was he more than a guest. Not so in the Stark household. Instead, he ate dinner with Mr Stark and Peter every night in the smaller dining room, and more often than not, Jarvis joined them making them a very merry party. When Peter was sent to bed, unless he had business calling him away, they would spend the evening playing cards or sitting in simple companionship as they read.
Their voices got quieter as they moved away, and S’Teve was left staring down at his PADD, even as his Lanovian counterpart was still enthusiastically explaining their secure databases. They hadn’t noticed S’Teve’s preoccupation, what he had just heard swirling in his mind.
Tony swallowed back the lump in his throat. “I found out he was dealing weapons under the table. Obie, I mean. He was selling to some bad people, and I had to actually face what our weapons were doing for the first time. I saw who they were really hurting. Civilians,
“Oh god, I am so sorry,” a voice said from his chest, and then a weight was lifted as the owner of the voice presumably rolled off him. Tony was pulled to his feet. It was so disorienting going from standing to floor to standing again in such quick succession that it took a moment for Tony to tip his head down slightly to focus on his helpful assailant. The first thing Tony became aware of was a pair of bright blue eyes.
“I guess I’m sorry that I didn’t explain what I meant and it upset you,” Tony offered, feeling magnanimous. “I didn't know.”
He spent the rest of the evening with Tony, helping him feed the cats and cook dinner for the two of them.
“Well, there was no need for that!” Jarvis hissed, fur standing on end. “Of all the rude, insufferable-”
Bucky snorted. “Nothing I haven’t seen before, pal. Save it for Stark.” He lowered the tripod. “Also for your information, bearskin isn’t as comfortable as it looks.”
Tony huffed. “I may have gotten into a few arguments over the years. Some people thought Cap was just a propaganda thing and they were wrong.” He looked away for a moment. “You were part of the reason Rhodey and I went independent. I got back from Afghanistan and I thought, what would Cap do? And I realised you’d say help people.”
Tony huffed. “You’ve been acting strange -- strange for you at least. Did something happen?” He leaned in, lowering his voice. “Have you been dreaming about the cryo-chamber again? I told you, you should speak to the ship therapist--”
Maria twirled the spear a few times, getting used to the weight before jerking it forward to see it pop back into place. “It’s amazing. I’ll have to thank her.”
“I missed you.” He kissed her cheek, rubbing their horns together as he did. When they pulled apart, she had tears running down her cheeks and he knew he did as well.
Sam gave him a knowing look. “I’ve been where you are. Don’t let it get you down. It’ll happen when you least expect, and it’ll be perfect, no matter what.”
Tony hummed. His hand came up to brush over Stíofán’s horns which had flourished without constantly being butted during training. “You do have a fine pair of horns. Very intimidating.”
Tony snorted, but moved out of the way, letting her check on him. He got to his feet, grabbing his broom which had snapped in half on impact. He winced but gave it a pat. “Good job, bud. You did what I needed. I promise, your next upgrade will be even better.”
“Not a lot of hot baths on the trail,” Steve admitted, brushing pointlessly at the dust covering his shirt.
He pulled out his phone, hitting call, and for a moment he worried it might go to voicemail. But then he heard a phone ring behind him, the tone familiar, and he spun around.
“Big barbarian buck,” Tony snorted. “Who are you trying to fool with that? You carried me to the forge the other day so my hooves didn’t get muddy.”
using any spells. He’d just finished, cleaning off oil he’d gotten on his hands when he’d had to reach in and actually physically remove a loose part so his magic could do its thing in the Colonel’s kitchen, when there was a shout from the living room.
Tony didn’t turn around, still staring at Peter. “Yes but we talked about this, didn’t we Peter, we recited it on the way over. What is the rule?” He was trying to reign in his frustration, but it was there, at the edge of his voice.
“Holy shit,” Tony managed, and the man’s eyes snapped to his, a small smile curling his lip. Then his eyes went wide.
“Pups are cute,” Steve shot back. “Liking the idea of something ain’t the same as needing. Or being unhappy with my lot.” He gave Tony a squeeze. “You’ve been thinking about this a lot, huh?”
He could imagine doing this. Coming every week, watching Tony dance around the room charming people, and then settling in to sit on Steve’s lap, wrapped in his arms while they talked to the residents - a tabby leapt up onto Steve’s lap and he smiled - looking after the cats. Being introduced as
“Not to worry. I’ve arranged for him to deliver it to the Sheriff’s office when they take the new supplies to the General Store within the hour.”
“Holy shit,” the farmer said, brushing his hands through his hair and dislodging his hat. “I mean don’t get me wrong: I believed you could do it, but seeing it actually happen is something else.”
That was rather charming. A big guy like Steve willing to put himself on the line for others. Then the last of what Sam said made Tony’s ears prick up. “Steve’s big on soulmates then?” That didn’t bode well for his chances of a nice roll in the sheets.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ve heard it all before,” she pointed at the guy still trying to slap at Bucky’s face. “You say something dickish?”
Suddenly his last-minute run that morning made a lot more sense. God, he’d put so much time and energy into keeping Dad from getting too manic and making sure they were all set and never letting on that he was hurting.
With one last opponent to go, he used the shield like a ram, battering it against the other satyr’s own. He shoved hard sweeping the other’s hoof with his own, taking off balance and sending him into the dust. Stíofán put his sword point to the other buck’s throat and looked to the Emperor.
“I hear a lot of yapping and not enough letting these nice omegas go on their way,” Steve growled, and it was
“Great,” Tony sighed as the backup generator kicked in, bathing the room in a greenish glow. “JARVIS needs twelve minutes to reboot.”
S’Teve could feel the strong muscles forged by regular sparring and hard engineering work, and smell the rich cologne the man always wore. He didn’t limit himself, letting the almost all-encompassing feeling of wanting Tony to guide him. He wanted him, and he wanted to
Mr Rogers wasn’t interested in him like that. It had become clear to Tony that Mr Rogers’ attention was elsewhere much to his bitter disappointment.
we can go - if your arm is better. But Steve, baby? I need you to stop insulting guys who are beefier than you. And travel in packs.”
“You got it. Oh here, let me tidy up the bed.” And before Tony could stop him, he picked up the duvet, shaking it out and letting it fall onto the mattress.
“Umm, hello?” The sound had changed direction slightly, and this time, Steve realised there was a man
“I’m sorry that happened to you,” Stíofán said, placing his hand over Tony’s, and the doe gave him a weak smile.
“Mr. Stark, I have come to this event to make an incredibly generous donation, only for the Captain to insult me. Do you intend to do something about it or shall I take my money elsewhere?”
Tony chuckled. “Ah yes, I've heard of this, I think I might have just the notion.” And with that, he leaned in, pressing his lips against Steve’s.
Hammer made an affirmative sound. “The does? Sure did. I hear they’re the cast-off fauns from the Matchmaking Stable - didn’t make the grade but still fine enough to look at if the ones I caught sight of going into the
Rhodey caught Steve’s eye and Steve threw a thumb over his shoulder. “The man’s restrained. They need to come pick him up.”
“What?” Tony asked, sipping his beer. He looked over to see Rhodey staring wide-eyed over his shoulder and frowned. “No seriously what?”
Tony couldn’t really focus, but he was pretty sure it was the adrenalin crashing as he realised they were safe. Because they were. As soon as Tony had realised Steve was close, he’d felt instantly like things were going to be ok. It was heady that feeling, and it made Tony want it all the time.
“Yeah, he does.” Sam took a sip of his beer. “Don’t get me wrong, he’s not a total asshole.  It's usually for a good reason. Steve’s pretty big on fairness, so I imagine that guy was hassling some woman out with her friends, or said something bigoted, or, in this case, since he’s going easy on them, they probably just said shit about soulmates.”
“Alright, I’ll be here bright and early tomorrow, we’ll get the frame up,” Stíofán called. He wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Come on, let’s have an early dinner. Ma, Rhodey, you’ll join us?”
Tony could feel his cheeks heat even as he kissed back, all the want he’d been feeling for the last few months rising in his chest and pushing him forward to tangle his fingers in Steve’s hair and hold him close.
They dismounted and trudged the rest of the way up, Steve oddly subdued. He perked up though when they hit the rise and could see the field next to the shore, the dirigible floating big and bright in the distance.
Steve hummed. “And maybe a few rides. Just a couple. Definitely at least the Cyclone: I have a score to settle.”
Sam looked over and sighed, putting his face in his hands. “Just one time. I would like to go out and just have a nice drink.”
“Anthony, please, I want to talk to you,” the alpha tried to walk ahead of him but stumbled, grabbing on to Nomad’s saddle to steady himself. “Can we talk please?”
Tony nodded, letting Steve tug him around the coffee dripping onto the floor. The glow was almost effervescent standing this close together.
The alpha took the seat opposite. “Are you ready to talk to me now?” The question had a slight tone to it, which Tony did not care for.
Jarvis mewed in worry, but before Tony could do anything, he heard loud talking from in the back of the shop. He leaned to get a look down the passage, his curiosity piqued.
“I didn’t do anything! He was standing there and then he was on the ground,” Tiberius hissed frantically.
“Are you kidding? You think Captain America is cool because of the muscles? No way! The guy is like five foot nothing, skinny asthmatic, who grows up with not a lot in Brooklyn, but he spends all his spare time getting beat up by bullies because he can’t stand to see people being pushed around. Then he tries to enlist, not once, not twice but
Steve wanted to explain but what could he say? His teeth were chattering and at the sound Mr Stark removed his cloak wrapping it around, the warmth of the man’s body still trapped inside.
“Goodness no. No, we are not like that.” The man fidgeted with the blankets. “I had rather hoped that you-- no, nevermind, I am about to make a great fool of myself. Please, don’t pay any attention to me.”
Tony put his pie on the table, making sure to lay it out nicely and precut a few slices, while Steve spoke to a couple and congratulated them on their nuptials.
Tony swatted his arm. “I know your game. You just want me buttered up so I’ll try that new chocolate cake recipe from your Dame. But you’re out of luck. I didn’t have cocoa on my list so I--” Steve reached into the basket to pull out a packet and waved it. “You sneaky alpha.”
“I’m putting my foot down,” Rhodey told him sternly. “You need a break. Ms. Van Dyne’s sewing machine can wait.”
Wilson gave a low whistle. “Some alphas get all the luck. I’m still cooking for myself while my omega’s away, and I can tell you I’ve got a whole new respect for her skills.” He moved aside to let Tony enter, and Tony walked inside to see an empty office.
Steve revved again and started forward, his feet lifting up as he pulled out of the driveway, and then between one blink and the next, as Steve nudged the accelerator, the bike went from rolling down the street to zooming into the air and up into the sky.
He liked to wait though, draw it out and let it build. He ran his hands over the trembling flanks, leaning down to kiss those soft lips, happy when he was welcomed, the doe returning the kiss eagerly, the soft whimpers muffled as he continued to move.
Tony nodded in relief, but couldn’t help feeling a little bold. “Could there be more kissing if we do?”
“I see. Well, the crew will be sure to attend.  And though I’m sure Commander S’Teve will bow out, I can’t imagine he’d be offended in any way.”
“Well, I think I saw there was a cafe two floors up,” Steve said, and he led the way, Tony following dutifully.
“But look at these strapping young satyrs,” Stíofán countered. “So free and wild; dancing among the buttercups, nibbling on the thistles. The sun shining on their speckled fleeces, their horns, their--”
Tony let the doctor help him off the bed and into his coat, telling him what was probably vital information, but Tony couldn’t hear a word of it. All he could think about was the tiny pup growing inside of him.
“I should’ve caught you, but I was too focused on reading the briefing packet, so I’m sorry about that,” he looked frustrated, but Tony’s eyebrows nearly shot off his forehead. Caught him? The guy was like a foot shorter and half his weight: Tony probably would’ve crushed him.
He let himself be led, feeling a spike of worry as he didn’t recognise the tune, but then he heard the beat, counted the steps and realised it was nothing more than a simple two-step. He picked up the movements quickly, and it wasn’t long till he was completely in time.
Tony felt a growl of frustration, and he wished again that Steve was here. Those muscles of his could carry Peter like it was nothing. Or better yet, Tony could pass Peter to him safely on his damn horse!
Kamala burst out laughing, trying to cover it behind her hand and Maria felt her stomach swoop. “I’m good, thanks. But how about we go check out the coffee situation? I saw a kiosk in the quad.”
The colour was coming back to Antonius’ cheeks, fortified by the wine. “It is more privacy than we are given at the Stables. You have a solid door for one. And no one to share with.”
Steve huffed. “I was informed no home was complete without a dog to defend the house, which I heartily disagreed with. However, I was also told that only a truly callous man would leave his omega unprotected, and while I was arguing the point – you and your gun are a far better option – I had my pocket picked for the price of this little rat catcher and sent on my way. So, this little fella is yours.”
Steve felt an irrational rush of jealousy at that. Tony knew what he wanted, where he felt comfortable and had made it happen. He looked comfortable in his own skin and Steve
“No need to fret, Ms Maximoff, we’ll get him out.” Then Bucky caught sight of Tony. “Mr Rogers, what are you--”
“I see them,” Tony said, unable to stop from smiling. He opened the gate for them to step through closing it tightly behind them. “Ok, now let’s--”
Suddenly, every touch Tony gave him was electric. He was one of the few on board who touched him at all, the rest of the crew avoiding it out of respect or discomfort. S’Teve could always rely on a pat of the shoulder or a nudge of an elbow to his side when Tony was around, though, and he found himself anticipating them, revelling in each one, and revisiting them during his meditation.
There was a sharp intake of breath, and Tony turned his head on the mattress to look back at Steve questioningly.
He trailed them over, revelling in the sensation, knowing that his cheeks had to be green if Tony’s delighted grin was anything to go by.
He kissed the top of her head. “But not too careful. I want you to raise hell just like you always have and be whatever you want to be.”
“Excellent!” the Chancellor replied, clapping their tentacles together. “Our visitors usually report they had a good time so I’m sure you will find the same. Come, let us speak to your Captain about the arrangements.”
They wrapped Peter up in the blanket Tony had carried him in and in a pair of socks borrowed from the Doctor’s neighbours. Peter was trying to be good, but it was clear he was getting fussy.
“That’s real kind of you, Ms Maximoff,” Steve told her, manners impeccable as always. “Perhaps you might have Tony over for some of those Sokovian steamed buns you make as well.”
“That would be— wow, I guess I hadn’t really thought about how I would use my specialty, just that I wanted to. But I could make a business out of it?”
“Much provocation?” Tony hissed, and his voice was like steel. Steve knew he had to step in to stop it from escalating. It wouldn’t do to get on the wrong side of the man who sold them their food.
Peter lay against the sheets, looking tiny in the big bed, and his cheeks flushed. He had a damp cloth on his head, with a light sheet covering him, even as he trembled beneath it. It was such a stark contrast to his little boy who had been gleefully shovelling down cake at the tea house just a couple of days ago.
“I really appreciate it, I was missing my basketball buddy.” He pulled out his phone and showed Tony a video of him dribbling a ball while Alpine ran at him to knock it away. Tony snorted and Sam grinned. “She tried a couple of times without the prosthetic but her balance was off and she’d just flip over until I picked her up for cuddles.”
“By yourself? That’s a mite risky, wouldn’t you say?” The man took a seat next to Tony. “I heard a lot of omegas were coming west to keep alphas...
“I’m sure I can lend a hand while the goose has his nap,” Steve said. Giving Sam a wave, helped Tony into the back of the cart bed and handed Peter to him. “Go on ahead. I’ll saddle up Nomad and follow.”
Stíofán watched them, his chest near bursting with emotion. He figured if a satyr could die from happiness, well, maybe that wasn’t such a bad way to go.
“My magic,” Tony snorted. “The way my magic works. It makes things do what they’re made for to the best of their ability. And you Steve Rogers have been going on and on about how that thing was going to make you fly! You didn’t build a bike, you built a flying machine, and my magic knew it.” He laughed again, almost unable to believe it.
He was sick of being on the back foot, realising he was free to do what he wanted now that his secret was out. He reached over, and tugged Tony forward by his shirt. “I’m going to kiss you now.”
“You bet.” She held him close, breathing in his scent and memorising it. He’d always been around when she needed him and it felt strange to let him go, knowing he wasn’t just next door. She squeezed him again and then let him step away. “Send me a pic of your dorm when you get in ok? I want to see it.”
Steve grumbled but obligingly glared right at the camera when Bucky finally managed to press the shutter through his giggles.
He looked up to see Steve smiling at him. “Yes, I think that’s quite enough excitement for one day.”
Steve blinked. This man had grown up the same time he had, how did he know anything about it? “I--uh--”
“Sure, yeah. Why are you here?” Tony asked bluntly. Who was this guy to come here and seduce his familiar? Honestly.
He was still asleep, whatever the doctor gave him was still holding strong, and so Tony made sure to keep him warm and check for fever regularly before he went to the main room to curl up on the armchair to rest. He didn’t want to risk hurting Steve if he moved during the night.
“About last night,” the alpha started, and the thought of talking about it was near unthinkable. Tony held a hand out.
Dad snorted. “Ah, my terrifying offspring.” He pressed a kiss to her hair. “You can have anything you want.”
“That’s so cool,” Steve breathed, sounding awed. “I’ve seen you fly, it must be so great being able to do that without a machine.”
“I am so sorry Mrs Bonneville. I can't stop, but if you head on over to the office one of the deputies will be overjoyed to offer you some assistance.” He hoped he didn’t sound too much like he was brushing her off, but the woman was as nosy as anything, and the last thing he wanted was her spreading the news around town. He was hoping to get Tony settled before they had to face that.
He started forward at a quick pace, and Tony followed as if in a dream. It was as though his soul was outside his body, watching himself stumble after the deputy, his baby in the alpha’s hold, quiet and face flushed, lacking his usual pep and bright-eyed curiosity.
Sure enough, as he stepped into the living room he was greeted with excited chatter. His parents were there and all his parents’ friends and clients in the community. This was a big day for them. Their only son off to start his Witch’s Journey, a feather in their cap for sure.
Stíofán huffed a laugh and placed a last apologetic kiss to his cheek before he started working Tony with his hand again.
The man grinned, smiling wide. “I’m sorry. I wouldn’t want you thinking we’re all reprobates. I’m James Barnes.”
“He will,” Tony assured him, rubbing an affectionate hand through the boy’s hair. “But you’ll have to be good and perhaps do some of your lessons with Jarvis or me for a few days while he rests. Can you do that?”
“Ah, I see you caught my accent,” Ana said with a chuckle. “It has softened, with all the years I’ve lived here. I am from Hungary. I came to America during the war, when the Nazis invaded. Edwin helped me get out.”
General Carter watched her leave the tent and, not a moment after, a new voice piped up. Low and husky, the words were muttered from the rear of the tent.
“What happened? Why-” He cut himself off and shook his head a little, trying to recall just what the hell had occurred. “Where are we?”
“Been there, done that,” Pierce smirked, dragging Tony up one last time to press the barrel of his gun under Tony’s chin, “Goodbye, Tony.”
There's a memory just below the surface of the asset’s thoughts. It sits just out of reach as he moves around the kneeling figure to stand behind her. Red is spilling, falling, curtain-like down her back. She clutches a simple arrow necklace in one of her fists, her hands bound behind her.
“You just don’t get it. He called me, Nick. He called me even though it risked everything. And yeah, it definitely backfired on him, but he still did it.”
When Captain America came to the Academy, Tony’s heart stopped. Seeing the legend in real life was intimidating and amazing and Tony might have just been a little in love.
Two supersoldiers were definitely sneakier than girlfriend number three. He’d never once seen them. But in the middle of being scolded by Pepper in conference number whatever -who honestly was counting at the point, certainly not Tony- the vibrations had gone from 0 - 60 in between breaths. He’d tensed, the sensation rippling up his spine with the warmth of the sun.
Steve groans, the sound punched from his gut as he jerks back against the plug, grinds against Tony's hand as Tony presses the plug deep as he can. He twists it, and Steve emits a low enough noise to avoid being a whine.
Tony smiled, this time fake, fake as anything he could do with sunglasses on. “For a moment there, you almost had me. I’m always aware of what revolves around me.”
There’s a new tailor in town and Tony’s heard nothing but good things. Even Rhodey has given the guy his hard-won approval when he comes to the next military fundraiser dressed to the nines in expensive fabric.
“Not to mention, you’ve got Captain America on your ass,” Frank said, “Are you going to try and get him on your side too? Because I’m pretty sure after you dropped the Port on him, he probably hates your guts.”
“Afraid of me dying on Latverian soil, Doom?” Tony smirked, saluting Victor with his drink before taking another healthy -or unhealthy- swallow. “Don’t worry; I’m made of stronger stuff than that. Debris just tore through the webbing. It’s not quite up to snuff yet.”
“Jarvis,” he growled, watching the bot that had thrown him. It seemed to watch Tony for a long moment before it was joined by four others and began to walk down the street towards him.
Steve’s heart stops, and he can’t hear anything else but Pepper and the suit crumpling. Just like that, Tony’s entire world is gone. Later, Steve will wonder if Tony realizes the significance of what’s happened. He will wonder if Tony ever let himself mourn their passing. He reaches for Pepper’s body as it falls, but before he catches her, Bucky’s metal fist connects with his temple and the world goes dark.
It reminded him of the ice, so cold it burned before it consumed him. Consumed him like Tony was consuming him, with his cock and his steady, calloused fingers that knew everywhere and exactly where to touch to spur Steve on. His thighs worked tirelessly, lifting and dropping his body to follow Tony’s rough-spoken commands. His back remained arched, the belts and ropes still connected together and ending in the tight grip of Tony’s hand.
“You didn’t see yourself on that table,” was Tony’s low response as the door swung shut after him. Iron Man’s faceplate turned towards Steve, empty and eerie.
It was also flooded with a thousand different middles to songs he’d instantly want to sing under a window like a lovesick moron.
"But you-" Steve cuts him off, leaning down with a swift, hard kiss. One hand plants itself beside Tony's head on the covers and the other takes Tony's hand and brings it back to Steve's ass.
Fury paused and smirked. He held his hand out towards the door and said, smug and triumphant, “Be my guest. If you can get Captain Rogers to release your suit.”
"Sweet dreams," he said to himself with a roll of his eyes. By the time he showered and fell into bed, he’d pushed the weird dream to the back of his thoughts.
“I love you too,” Tony says after a long silence. He feels loose and shaky, drained and tired. Steve’s still steady around him and Tony doesn’t really feel the slight headache forming from where he’d bumped his head. “Thank you.”
He tries to stop, tries to bite back the words, abhorred by the very insecurities that led him to this point. But Steve is patient, big hands rubbing methodically up and down his back. One hand leaves briefly and Tony barely catches the sight of Natasha as Steve waves her silently out.
“No! What? Shut up, and look! Whoever this is, they know the suit… but they don’t know how it works. Look!” He made a few frustrated gestures at the screen, to Victor, and back to the screen.
It left Tony bristling in indignation. “Siri is an assault on humanity, Steven Rogers! I swear to God you better drown that crappy tech!”
Tony’s breath froze, the table digging into his spine as Steve pushed into him. He caught at Steve’s arms in return, twisting his shirt up in his fists.
On his back on the roof of his car, everything loose had been scattered around. His suit’s case wasn’t among them, but the windows had been shattered out, so it could’ve fallen out in the fall.
“And what does Captain America have to say about your offer?” Tony asked sardonically, “Pretty sure he hates me as much as I hate him.”
Tony snorts. “He won’t even know. I’m not going for a wardrobe, Pep. I’m just going to get a... What do you call it?”
What was unknown to her was the angry scuffle taking place not two meters out. From where Stephanie stood, she couldn’t make the figures from the shadows, but it was obvious there was fight starting.
doing is being acerbic and bratty,” Victor replied, setting his glass down on the bartop, “and clearly, you have no head for this tonight. Perhaps after you rest, we may speak more of this over breakfast.”
“Get him up there,” Tony instructs shortly, pushing to his feet by bracing his hands on his knees. He indicates the set of hooks suspended from the ceiling. They’re on cabling not quite as strong as Steve’s shield, but Tony had tested them with one of his suits. They held.
“I’m finding it hilarious, to be honest,” he said flatly, “You actually think I didn’t plan for this. There’s always been the chance that you’d find me out, Nick. You’re not an idiot. It’s just a shame your lawyers are.”
The man, Steve, was beginning to look nervous. Right. Date. Motion. Tony stepped forward, finally taking off his hat and the glasses. His smile was wide, wider than it should’ve been. It probably looked fake.
The noise that rips out of Steve is a broken and ragged version of Tony’s name and Tony can feel Steve’s orgasm building through his balls up through his cock. The first spurts of semen spill out around the sound, yet Tony is still strict in how careful he pulls the rod out.
okay?” Tony asked, kneeling close to the curving edge of the turbine. He braced his hands on his knees as he peered down at Rogers. The smile he was given in return was pleased.
But then, suddenly, the gag was gone, had been gone, and Steve’s aching jaw no longer ached. He was still mindless, still blindfolded, but he was no longer bolted to the floor. Instead, he was straddling Tony’s hips, knees braced against Tony’s sides so tightly that he was sure to leave bruises. The cock inside of him was hotter than anything Steve had ever experienced, burning him from the inside out.
Tony continued to clutch at his guitar like a security blanket, contemplating on using it as a defense if he had to, but Pepper’s touch was soothing, and he felt himself relaxing next to her.
“Oh my god, no! Are you crazy? Pep’s in Malibu. The only program I trust enough to cover Malibu is Jarvis.” Tony narrowed his eyes suddenly as Victor closed the distance between them, using his glass to point at Victor. “What are you doing? Why do you care where I stick my AIs?”
He dragged the closest bot towards him and pried off the jetpack to get to the panel beneath it. He ripped into it and past the wiring, searching for something that would prove it wasn’t really from Victor. He would know. He would.
Ronin shrugged. “The masses are just dumb, blinded by Pierce’s accomplishments. It’s pretty obvious once you look at the big picture, plus I’ve seen what Hydra’s done.”
“No, your kind just shuns everything and everyone until you’re alone.” Carter turned in her seat to eye Stark.
“Excuse me, sir,” Steve calls out as he nears. The decorative cane in his hand clinks on the stone path before passes it over his shoulder to his valet and crouches, wanting to help the man up. “Sir, you need a doctor?”
A door slammed shut as Tony tried to break through the haze of disorientation, feeling like his limbs were weighted down, like his head was in the clouds with a wet towel wrapped around it. There had been voices around him, but he couldn’t make sense out of the words. He thought he reached out at one point, but nothing reached back.
It wasn’t easy, rounding up the eight Doombots -and wasn’t that shit, that only eight of those bots were able to cause so many problems? Especially when the clock was ticking down faster and faster, and all Tony could think about was adamantly denying that Victor had anything to do with this.
“Lock the suit up, Mr. Stark,” he murmured, nose brushing along Tony’s hairline, “You’re under house arrest until further notice.”
“What are you- What did you do to Tony?!” Steve growled, shoulders bunching as he pulled at the cuffs on his wrists. “I swear to God, I’ll rip that pretty smile off your face if you- if you-”
“Steve.” Steve ignored Tony's voice, nuzzling at his throat and jaw. He was trying his best to leave a mark that no one could mistake, the burn of climax just beginning to curl his toes.
The next time Steve searches for Tony through the mingling crowd of tuxes and dresses, he notices that the billionaire is missing. There’s no moment of panic as Tony always makes a random escape, the pressing, simpering adulation even too much for Iron Man once in awhile. So instead, Steve makes a polite excuse to the senator he was speaking with and exits the main ballroom.
“I’m not here to discuss Captain America. He’s interfered enough, and I lost Crossbones because of it. I’m asking for your help. When it’s time to confront Pierce, can I count on your help?”
He hesitated, knowing outside meant almost immediate freedom, but there was obviously a wealth of evidence in this warehouse. If he had enough time, he could probably get all the information he needed prove there was a fake Iron Man and Pierce’s involvement in the whole scheme.
“So, he’s probably some stick in the mud. Blah blah stereotypes, blah blah. What can I say that’ll offend you the most, so I don’t have to do this?” Tony shoved the pen into his hair, took the pick from his mouth, and strummed his guitar a little. The notes were twangy, thin, since his guitar was unplugged, but that didn’t stop Tony from playing the song out. His foot tapped in time with the music in his head, mouth moving silently to words he hadn’t written down.
“Good. Guy was a pain in the ass,” Fury said, sitting back. “I think you’re looking at this all wrong, Tony. They’re supporting you overwhelmingly, your voters. The people don’t want Alexander Pierce anymore. They want Tony Stark. They’re holding you up as a pathway to a better system of government.”
He felt split open around it, and he’d nearly cried out when Tony had delicately worked the rod into him. He’d bitten his tongue to prevent the noise, but he couldn’t stop the rutting of his hips the first time the rod had gone off. It spread wave after wave of electric stimulation that seemed to come from the very heart of his nervous system centered solely in his cock.
"Everything I’ve done, I’ve done for you. And you will remember every agonizing second of betrayal long after I'm gone, and you will know what it is to truly feel the weight of your failure."
“Generally, SHIELD deals with my R&D Department; this was just a courtesy call.” Tony waited a beat for the inevitable protest, but when none actually came, he tipped his head to the side a bit. A lock of his hair fell across his brow. He watched Rogers’ gaze track the movement. “But I'm sure I could make an exception to give you the initial tour of your new inventory, Captain.”
“No! There’s no- I don’t have magic!” His fingers let go of the cup, letting the last of its contents splash against the floor as it landed with a soft ‘thwip’. “It was just a dream I had. I was just jok-”
“Are you?” Frank asked, “Because from where I see it, you’ve just been growing softer. I don’t think you got what it takes to take on Hydra anymore, and fucking forget Alexander Pierce. He’s not going down without taking the fucking East Coast with him, and I ain’t about to risk that because you got a hate boner for the guy.”
“He’s not even lucid! If you want to cuff him to the goddamn bed, then you’re going to have to move me to do it.”
“I believed in him, though. Your father, I mean. I saw what he could do with those engines and I read about the work he’d done with the government that was never in the papers. He was… a brilliant, overwhelming force of unbridled thirst for knowledge and the future. On paper, he was a great man.
“I’m well aware of that, Captain,” Victor said, retracting his mask and letting his hood settle about his shoulders, “Anthony is currently being dragged before Pierce while you play around in this… warehouse.”
He wants to keep them forever. He wants to be a part of them forever and, if he hadn't been an AI, he'd suspect, too, that this is happening quickly.
On the HUD, Tony eyed the rectangle forming between The Holland and the Home Depot. It was at least a block away and he still had to deal with the immediate threat of the five fighting Doombots just in front of him.
“Do you think that’s true?” Scarlet Witch asked, one leg swinging absently. “What a time to be in where the good guys are the bad and vice versa. Very exciting.”
“Look at you.” Tony clucked his tongue, the sound echoing strangely in the metal. “You’re so fucking hot for it, why don’t you just give in? Ask me, Captain: may I please come? And I’ll say yes.”
Across the field, a flash of dark skin -so rare among the Nords- caught Stephanie’s gaze, drawing it in until she met eyes that were as red as flame even from a distance.
“Tony’s… No, he was fixed. He was… His therapy’s been going well. The reports… He and Bucky have…” Steve’s heart clenches, jealousy and guilt twisting together, then a clear, dawning understanding. “Oh my god, they planned it. He came for Bucky...”
Tony bends him over the table and takes him apart with his mouth and fingers. Later, over dinner, they sit and they discuss what Steve wants to try until Steve can talk about it without blushing and they both understand the safety and instructions when performing an act like this.
Tony refills Pepper’s wine glass. Her shoulder is a warm weight against his, and he signs the next contract.
He thought he already climaxed once, humiliated by the thought of how easy he’d made it for Tony. Overwhelmed and blindsided, it felt like he'd exploded around the sounding rod within the first few minutes of stimulation without even realizing it. He could imagine the evidence, almost see his cum well up and spill out around the sleek rod as his cock twitched even further at the thought.
“No, I’m just in from the colonies,” Steve says with a hint of confusion. He straightens a little and wonders if this man will be prejudiced against his choice. “Will that be a problem? Will you let me assist you?”
He bit down then let Clint force his hands around the bow. He attempted to snicker and offered up another muffled, “That’s what she said,” at the same time as Clint fit his own hands around Tony’s calf and knee and popped the bone back into place. He valiantly tried not to scream, but he did black out again for at least a few seconds.
He shrugged out of his shirt and dropped his clothes on the floor before turning to crawl up Tony’s body. His boyfriend’s blue briefs were lopsided on his lean frame, and Steve placed a tender kiss on the revealed
A warm weight was against his side and his fingers absently played with the ring on Tony’s left hand where it was tucked in the crook of his elbow. He smiled at the hint of amusement in his tone. He didn’t have to open his eyes to know Tony’s right hand was busy with his phone.
And Steve understands. As would the rest of their team. Everyone has moments like these where they just need to be alone, need to express themselves in some way that can bleed out their anxiety, their worry, their demons. Tony, sometimes most of all. Oh, how Steve understands.
“The news’ always painting Iron Man like it’s all his fault. Clearly it’s not. It’s obvious he’s trying to stop even worse people, right? I mean, he saved my mom’s life in DC. If it hadn’t been for him, she’d have died at the airport, and everyone on that plane along with her.”
“Coulson says you haven’t eaten since you got to work,” Steve said, nudging the tray a little closer.
It isn’t the first time, he remembers that. He remembers stiff fingers plucking at the fabric and almost, almost…
There are less people here, only a handful stretched along the dim hallway. As he walks away from the grand doors, the, frankly sometimes, overwhelming music begins to fade away. It’s soon replaced though by something different, softer, yet grander still for all of that.
His hands press into Tony's ass cheeks, holding him still as Steve bobs his head down, taking Tony to the back of his mouth like he can't get enough. He moans around Tony, the sound rocking down Tony's cock and up his spine, and those hands shift. His fingers spread Tony open, dip between to rub and test and tease at Tony's entrance.
“What, ‘n’ get myself turned into a toad or somethin’? No fuckin’ way. Pierce don’t scare me near as much as that guy.”
"Go back to sleep, Tony," Steve says again, tone soft but not pleading. There is no shame or worry in it, only warning. "You’re safe here."
And through it all, he knew now that Tony had somehow managed to fall in love with him. The part of Steve that was terrified of what it all meant wanted to be callous, to call Tony out on an emotion that surely had to be fake. How could someone like Tony ever trust enough to fall in love?
, and she caught him as he dropped, hauling him up and tossing him to the side in the dirt. “Stay down!”
“Now, I know you’re just yanking my chain,” Stephanie said, letting herself relax a little. “Beautiful is definitely not something to describe me.”
“Yes, definitely. I’ve seen what you can do and I have to say I’m jealous that you worked on my friends and they waited so long to tell me,” Tony says, following Steve as he leads them back to the fitting stations. One is opened and ready for them. It’s spacious and comfortable with a steady, foundation for Tony to step onto when he’s ready. There’s a plush chair in the corner and the decor is simple and tasteful.
Tony’s chin dipped briefly towards his chest, sunglasses -his personal protection- perched snug across his nose. Inside the pockets of his dark gray slacks, his hands were fisted to stop them shaking. The famous saying ‘eavesdroppers never hear good about themselves’ seemed to be spot on that day. Fury, of course, wouldn’t have a rebuttal satisfying enough for Captain Rogers.
Tony snorted. “You came back to me, Doom. You wanted my company’s good name to help you facilitate good relations with the U.S., and you wanted my good name to prove you were going on the up-and-up. It just so happened that I needed your help too. Mutually beneficial arrangements abound,” he finished dryly.
“Colonel Rhodes, you must get up.” Her voice echoes through all of their comms, whether the wearers are still conscious or not. Rhodey makes it as far as his knees before his strength gives out, and he’s left relying on the suit and his braces to keep his legs locked in place.
She blinked and tried to look anywhere but right at Stark, but not before she saw Stark settle a hand on her hip.
“Captain!” Before his title was even finished, Steve was halfway across the room, striding towards that redheaded agent as if his conversation with Tony hadn’t been life altering. The woman eyed Tony, and he forced himself to turn away, waiting until their steps had faded before he braced his hands on the table. After a moment, he sunk down and pressed his forehead to the cool metal, breathing out in counts of five to calm himself.
It’s just...Did you get a tattoo?” the girl asked, blushing furiously. Several other students murmured their agreed curiosity.
“Anthony, would you please do us both the favor and just spit it out already,” Victor pulled away from Tony, fixing the placement of his vest over his shirt.
Dinner, it turned out, consisted of two bowls of black truffle gnocchi, and two main courses: one, a lobster ravioli with roe, and two, a beef tortellini that Tony wondered if Rogers would have eaten had he known what it was. They both came with a sprig of mint and three pieces of lightly-glazed asparagus, ostensibly held together by a thin strip of scallion. Pretentious and expensive; what Tony thought most people expected him to dine on as a normal person would dine on Pizza Hut or Burger King when they didn’t feel like cooking that night.
The line went dead, and Tony wanted to hit his head against a wall, but he’d have to remember to do that later.
More prepared this time, Tony pressed it into Steve instead of trying to take out a kidney, and then Steve was wrapping his arm around Tony’s hips and hauling him up on his cock. Tony’s shoulders dug into the brick wall now, but he looked far beyond caring, fucking himself onto Steve’s cock much like he had in his last attempt at distraction.
The kicker is, he's talking to his friend. To his friend that's thousands of miles away and can't hear. Hasn't tried to hear him.
And what could Tony do, but believe her? He closed his eyes and let the darkness of his nightmares take him away.
Tony has no problems meeting the man's gaze straight on; the man bites his lip and tilts his head subtly towards the door. It's enough. Tony finishes his whiskey and pushes the bartender the customary tip before he grabs his jacket and heads for the door.
He couldn’t even muster the energy to pull up his data files to input all of the specifics of the incident. He’d have to rewatch the footage later when he wasn’t dying. He coughed weakly and scrambled up for the trashcan.
If you asked Tony today what he’d said in response, Tony wouldn’t be able to tell you. It was a blur of begging, terror, and tears. At ten years old, he’d been no match for his father. So when Howard hauled Tony over the metal press, Tony had pissed himself in fear.
“Oh, well geez,” Rogers laughed softly, reaching back to rub the back of his neck, “I certainly hope I can come up with better questions than that.”
He’d told Tony months ago, brushed off his suspicions, that he didn’t think Pierce was as bad as Tony thought. The truth was, though, that Steve hadn’t been able to accept it. Accepting it had meant accepting that he’d died for nothing. He’d failed when he’d sacrificed himself to stop Hydra, and now…
“They were torturing you,” Tony answered, a flat tone used as a mask Steve had learned was to cover any emotion that got the better of him, “and I stopped it.”
“Tony, please.” Steve’s voice is barely audible, and he thinks he might just die from fear alone before the process starts. He feels guilt as he thinks the others’ deaths had been easier. Mercies.
“Hi, good morning, folks! My name’s Candace, and I’ll be taking care of you this morning. May I start you off with water or something else to drink?” She smiled, but it wobbled a little as she clearly tried to stave off a yawn. She set a fresh basket of rolls on the table with a couple appetizer plates.
Shock is powerful thing, Steve knows, but his gaze goes over her shoulder. Tony approaches, helmet under his arm. His expression is drawn, pale. For a moment, Steve feels hope -bittersweet- that maybe the shock of Rhodey’s death has snapped Tony out of his brainwashing.
Stephanie had always admired the General. The very ideal of the perfect woman. Average Nord height, pale skin, and eyes that promised the feeling of a win in battle. She was in command, imposing without being brutish and ugly. Stephanie was jealous, and attracted, but mostly envious of what she could never be.
Later, Tony will add further restraints, including the substances, that will keep Steve from being too coordinated. That won’t happen until the asset’s second gift. Clint hadn’t screamed, but he’d sworn and cursed until the asset had taken his tongue. Tony, on the other side of the wall, had laughed as it’d silenced the archer’s words. It was edged and hysterical, and Steve had struggled against the hooks holding him up, making the restraints creak in warning.
“Your temporary insurance policy,” he answered after a moment, and Steve’s expression went softer still. He relaxed against the pillows, taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly.
A smear of red, black, and gold was the first sight to greet him when Steve managed to pry his eyes open. For a moment, he was confused, and when he realized what he was looking at, his heart beat gave him away on the monitor above his head as his sense kicked into alert.
Whether he’s that tin can or not, he’s gonna need your help or he’s going to be a smear of red on the pavement either way.”
Steve had no choice but to bury his hands in Tony's hair, to mess it up and finally make Tony less than perfect. He pulled Tony up by his hair to lick and nip at his swollen and damp lips. He worried his teeth at the chapped bow of Tony's lower lip until it split. The result colored their kiss with the sharp tang of blood, and Tony grunted, pressing the heel of his hand against Steve's pelvis. He didn't jerk out of the kiss, spreading the blood along their tongues instead.
Steve with his perfectly pressed suit and combed hair and gentleman’s respect. Steve was fresh air compared to Ty’s toxic presence.
“Shall I begin to compile a list of pet names for Captain Rogers, as well?” Jarvis asked, and at Tony’s grunt of negation, continued, “Consistency with the tampering notwithstanding, Helicarrier Beta would have stayed up approximately one point four hours after the final malfunction in the turbine caused an overload in its other engines.”
“Excellent,” Scarlet Witch answered, buttoning up her coat. She pulled up her hood, fluffing it over her curls. “Goodbye, Iron Man. We will speak soon.”
“Just stop. It’s not all your fault. It’s theirs too, but after Tammy, I thought we had an agreement,” Pepper retorts, pacing angrily. Tony can’t see her, but he can hear the click of her stilettos.
He takes those postcards and he mails them. Every single one. He never lets himself wonder if they're received.
“I should beat you black and blue,” Steve murmured, fingers framing Tony’s head to press behind his ears. He forced Tony’s chin up a sliver, earning a grunt. “Maybe if I mark you enough you’ll remember who you chose to belong to.”
A sharp, piercing pain tore through Steve’s daze, sending blazing needles all along his spine down to his toes. He wanted to jerk, to squirm, to cry out, but his body wouldn’t move, his mouth slack under the mask. The monitors behind the nurses remained steady, if not a little elevated, and Steve was on fire. Moments like these, when time slowed down to a fevered crawl and where he knew nothing but agony, he could absolutely understand why Tony wanted to watch the world burn.
“Once upon a time, you were just a piss-poor diplomat. So, if you’re not going to let me drown my injuries in alcohol, then yeah, you better put that mouth of yours to better use instead of bringing up shit from our past that neither of us wants to actually discuss. Or would your pride prevent you?”
“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that sounds like you weren’t planning on living to see the consequences,” he said flatly, almost accusingly if the one-eyed glare he was sending Tony could be heard.
“Oh my god!” He shouts, forgetting to be any sort of contained. “You have one?! Were you in the testers program? That’s a shit question, of course you were. Look at my baby, all grown up and attached to someone’s body already. Ah, the childhood just flies by, doesn’t it?”
There was a dark tone of amusement curling under Victor’s words, and Tony bared his teeth at the man.
Tony drops his forehead to the wall, letting the fire chase the alcohol poisoning in his veins, and gets his eyes focused enough to watch the man work his hand into Tony's pants.
“Not that I’m complaining, mind you,” Tony began, making his voice low and amused, “but to what do I owe such an honor?”
Tony’s legs had given out, and he watched with a weird double-vision as the floor swam before his eyes. He’d braced himself, tried to push up, but had been left blinking at Ty’s shoe. The black, pristine loafer had come down on the back of Tony’s hand, dug into the bone with a breaking forcefulness.
The heavy steps stopped, and Steve’s head was forward, facing Tony standing right in front of him. There was silence only interrupted by the near-inaudible hum of the sounding rod and Steve’s forceful, controlled breaths.
“I tried calling,” Tony heard himself say, very aware that Steve was still quiet, still in the doorway. He’d dressed in loose sweats and a shirt dark enough to hide any evidence of injuries, but Tony had already seen them. “SHIELD said you’d come home, so I was worried when you didn’t answer. Is-”
Tony tipped his chin up and had to remind himself that Steve was completely different than Ty. Ty was lean and dark where Steve was broad and light. Ty was obnoxious and
As for Tony, himself, he tried his best to avoid having to turn up to SHIELD for anything. He usually never had an issue with it, but it seemed like equipment after piece of equipment wanted to malfunction lately. Tony only trusted himself enough to fix each one, so his arrival was expected.
The klaxon alarm is loud, ringing out above the music of the Christmas party before the jovial atmosphere disappears almost instantly. Shutters are already falling down over the Tower windows as the Iron Legion appears on the communal floor to begin escorting the civilians to safety.
“Tony,” Steve says again, a sighing moan of his name as Tony gets Steve nice and slick, paying more attention to the flared head of his cock than the shaft. He spreads the lube up and over his slit, massaging the lube into Steve’s skin as Steve lets out little, uncontrollable ‘uns’ under his breath.
He’s huffing against her shoulder and she’s stiller than a dead person - not even that thought could kill the climax ripping through his system. His knuckles are ghost-white around the handrail and his eyes are squeezed tight against the sight of the company floors passing by.
As Tony settled behind the wheel of his Saleen, he traded his current sunglasses for another set. Those were tinted normally, and as he started the car, a blue HUD coalesced in front of his gaze. The car pulled away and left the garage, engine a low-set, promising growl as he peeled out into traffic.
Bucky waves him off. “It’s fine. We can talk later if you want after your fitting.” He rests his towel over to his shoulder and steps over to Sam who’s scribbling on a pad.
Rogers broke out another blinding smile, at ease now that his suggestion hadn’t been outright rejected. “Good, that’s good. Agent Coulson said you never took a break for lunch, so I feel it’s my duty to drag you away and make sure you get something more nutritional than the sludge they call coffee here.”
Tony knew immediately that he'd gone one step too far, and as his helmet -he'd forgotten Steve still had it in his hand- slammed into his face after Steve threw it at him, he thought 'yeah, I kinda deserved that'. The ramp on the jet closed, taking away the sight of Steve's pinched and pale expression.
Steve’s fingers curl over the datapad for a moment and Tony’s scrounging for what he could’ve left out that would make Steve react this way. When Steve finally moves his hand, Tony wildly expects to see something strangely vanilla like nipple-play or orgasm denial.
Steve surged up Tony’s body to kiss the words away from him. He cupped Tony’s jaw, thumb digging into the bolt of it to keep his mouth open wider. It was messy, but Tony didn’t care, chasing Steve’s tongue with his own on a desperate moan.
Jarvis can pinpoint the exact moment when everything changes, when Ms. Potts becomes Pepper, and when the always-careful space between a controlled suit becomes a hand on an alloy shoulder, a nudge of her elbow as if to share in her exasperation over his creator. His creator. Their Tony... Tony...
No one else comments Rhodey’s attempt at showing off on a shuffle is laughed off by Clint. There’s a short scuffle across the tabletop and Thor’s laugh booms out.
Steve didn't think Tony cared; he'd offer to clean it off if he had to, drag his tongue over every filthy inch of the suit until Tony was pleased and let him come. He would eventually have no choice but to beg, finally realizing then that he had no way to tell Tony to stop, that all he could do was break all of the restraints and
Steve trailed off as Doom stumbled from a clap to the shoulder. A tall, broad-shouldered man stepped from the portal, bearing a grin that fought back that gloom of the warehouse.
He wined and dined Natasha, who watched him with a faint smile (the expression practically screamed approval) and sipped her whiskey. He flirted with subtly with Bucky, which only seemed to amuse Natasha more, and made something ache in Steve’s chest.
“Why do I have to wear the tie?” Tony complained. “I’m one of the guests of honor! I should wear what I want!”
think about. Her shoulders were too broad, her arms too thick. The muscles from carrying her frame across her back were thick and too manly.
Tony strokes himself once more and shudders. Steve grabs Tony by the hips and shoves him downward until they can flop boneless against each other.
“And to you as well. I’m sorry to cut this short, but I must get back to work. Perhaps another time,” Tony said, not returning the smile in any way.
It happens quickly. There’s a flash of silver as Bucky’s arm cuts through the air, a sharp, crystal-clear clang as he strikes the edge of the shield almost perfectly, and then the shield is shuddering to stop, finding purchase in the upper body of Rhodey’s suit.
Fury was silent for a long time, taking longer and longer sips at his margarita until he simply plucked the umbrella from the side and drained the glass. Tony listened to the ice clinking around, focusing on the bright colors of the umbrella. The glass came down onto the table and Fury was leaning in again.
The first fight was not exactly a surprise. The tension had been building ever since she step foot inside the training grounds. Whispers followed her across the field towards the armory shed, louder and louder as she went. When she opened her chest to find her things missing, she knew.
“No, but thanks. I, um, didn’t know exactly what to get, so Coulson told me about this place a few blocks past the National History Museum. I hope that’s alright.” Rogers looked like any negative response might make him sink into the floor, so Tony huffed out a smile.
“Forgive me, Captain, I’ve forgotten the introductions,” Victor said, lifting a hand in an easy shrug, “This is Thor, son of Odin. He’s come to solve the little problem of Anthony’s copycat.”
“-nd she refused to do the exam! I had to fail her, and she had the nerve to blame me for it. I tell you, kids these days do not respect teachers. It’s not like I’m getting paid a lot to do this. I genuinely want to help them learn.”
Steve only smiled as he set the radio back down and clicked it off. Silence poured into the modest living room. Tony angrily swayed his foot back and forth where it was slung over the arm of the recliner.
…He thinks it is an ‘M’. The thought startles a harsh, frozen laugh from his chest as his brain starts to hum the sound of the letter. What good does an ‘M’ do for him as he hunkers against a rocky outcropping? A battered, green cloak whips against his side, and he’s left wondering where it came from.
Tony’s fingers twisted around the cuff grips, smacking his hands against the wall. Steve ignored him, ducking down to nuzzle into Tony’s cock. He licked his lips then licked from the base of Tony’s shaft to the tip, sucking lightly at the dripping slit. He made sure to avoid the carefully-tied ribbon around his balls and base.
Tony’s left hand was flat against the strings and pick-guard as he spoke to his audience. His hand was healed, perfect, and glinting with the engagement band Steve had surprised him with ten minutes earlier.
“Now, let me get you into some armor that actually fits you,” Natasha purred, dragging Stephanie inside.
Against his better judgement and those instincts stirring, Tony stepped past Steve into the living room where the television was playing the news and the kitchen’s light illuminated the back of the couch. He turned towards the kitchen, observing the dark cloth on the floor and the table covered in strips of gauze and tape.
“Code Tammy?” Pepper hisses at him, voice low and lethal. And Tony’s trying to keep a lid on it, trying to reign it in, but another woman enters the elevator and the small crowd shifts and Tony shifts and there it is, the telltale tightening of his muscles.
“You used yourself against me,” Tony whispered, and he hadn’t meant to sound as betrayed as he felt. He was sure on some morality scale, he wasn’t allowed this feeling, but he couldn’t stop it. It swept over him in unceasing waves, stealing his hearing on every second pump of his heart. “You made me think-”
Ronin didn’t look like he was going to give up, and Tony rushed to get the heavy shotgun cocked properly. When Crossbones gave a loud roar of anger, the energy crackled and Ronin swore.
It felt like forever to Tony until the car smashed into the road below, landing on its hood and jarring every part --broken or not-- of his body. By the time it settled into a rocking motion, he’d blacked out.
“Maybe, maybe not. You start running for something like the Presidency and screaming about how the government killed your parents, others will start to put the puzzle together.”
-- climb to his feet, but he couldn’t stop the rage, teeth bared inside the suit. He wanted to scream, but instead, he fired everything he had left in the suit. He didn’t wait to see the ground collapse under the Captain’s feet, or the debris from the previous explosions fall into the crater after him.
“The DNA sequence we picked up at the airport matches the DNA sequence I’ve just scanned from the internal dampeners on the turbine. Casting a wider net within the hangar alone, the sequence occurs again exactly three times. I project that the affected equipment will malfunction within the next three hours, in two days, and in one week. If not attended to, of course.
Tony watched the spray of blood that followed as if it happened in slow motion. “Steve! No!” He rolled towards the end, shoving his hand into the waters.
“Under no circumstances are you to get anything with the word ‘fried’ in the name,” Tony said, affecting a snobbish air. He even lifted his nose. Rogers’ smile went a little less ‘real’, and Tony breathed a sigh of relief, then mentally smacked himself upside the head for the whole stupid situation. “Unless it comes with the word oreo.”
Steve’s hand is warm on his calf and he’s looking up at Tony through his lashes. His mouth is curved in amusement and Tony flushes.
Crossbones walked easily with him towards the smoking remains of his car, and with a laugh, mused aloud; “I’m really not interested in anything you have to say.” He tossed Tony down and kicked him into the car, “So why don’t you just be a good boy and bring Daddy your armor.”
By the time he’s finished and he’s dressed again, Pepper is still pacing. She stops as he comes out of the bathroom and arches a brow at him.
“Ten, nine, eight, seven…” Tony starts counting backwards, trying to calm the rising panic in his chest. He would absolutely give anything for an alien to come busting through the windows, Doombots to try and take over the city. He’d give anything to break up the party.
“There isn’t one to hear about! That’s what I’m saying,” Steve said, “I don’t get it. He flirts like air, like it’s just him breathing, but…”
“They don’t make the Cucinelli in the color basil, I’ve checked.” By that time, Tony was rigging up another panel into the pulley system. Strands of his hair began to slip down over the goggles, and he blew forcefully up at them. When that didn’t seem to work, he leaned into the paneling and used a combination of ducking his head and lifting his elbow to try and work the goggles up into his hair.
A familiar weight landed at the foot of his bed, and when he looked, the expensive case holding the Iron Man armor stared back at him accusingly. It gave Steve’s accusing stare a run for its money. But beneath the accusation in Steve’s gaze lurked disappointment and the slant of his shoulders spoke volumes to resignation.
“You’re a giant tease.” Tony pouted, crossing his arms, and didn’t care how ridiculous he might look. “And I’m going to tell ‘em you’re still not using their first names. You’re going to make Pepper make that face, and then we’ll
“Okay, it’s not just vodka. She called it ‘Samohonka’. Apparently her father made it. He’s in Ukraine. She just got it the other day.”
“Only five?!” Tony’s damaged heart skipped more beats than what was safe, and the rest of his flight was filled with a stream of curses. The black and red of his armor stood out in his reflection from the airport’s windows as he banked around a side and headed straight for Gate 49.
Not for the first time, Tony had to remind himself that, though Victor had stopped his terrorizing ways, his moral compass was still clearly lacking; especially when it didn’t concern his own citizens. It did mean, however, that something political could have happened while Tony was out unsuccessfully stopping the radiation bomb.
“It’s a garage sale,” the engineer pointed out. “You’re supposed to buy strangely compelling, useless crap.”
“Whomever tampered with the thorium containers at the airport has access to at least one of SHIELD’s helicarriers,” Jarvis finished, “as the equipment is all from Helicarrier Beta.”
“I’m the cloying, pervasive itch in the air, the chaos beneath your skin. I’m the magic behind the mask, and that’s all you need to know for now. We’ll meet again soon enough, but do duck down, or you might lose your head.”
“Peachy, all things considered. You didn’t come to the meeting.” Tony reached up to wipe the sleet from his face, pausing a moment to look at the red on his fingers.
“You beautiful, beautiful man,” Tony whispered, staring at Steve’s dripping wet form where he knelt beside the soldier’s body.
“I don’t expect it will be either, will it?” Pierce seemed amused. “You’ve just opened Stark International, I’d assumed that would be keeping you rather busy. Especially with the recent requisitions from SHIELD, and all of your… extracurricular activities. Captain Rogers was correct when he said your time was fairly valuable.”
Tony put a finger against Steve’s mouth, stopping him. “Keep that up, and no, I won’t have time for lunch.”
Three days later, Steve sits on the edge of Tony’s bed in the penthouse suite. He’s nervous again and Tony wishes he could offer his lover just a bit of alcohol to ease his nerves. But it wouldn’t work on Steve and Tony’s going through a forced dry-spell. Besides, he wants to be completely sober for this experience and wouldn’t put Steve at risk -even with his enhanced healing- from unsteady hands.
“Precisely, sir,” Jarvis answered, “If you can make the time, a dead zone can be created stretching here and here.”
“That explains it.” Tony dropped his hat and glasses under the table by his foot and futzed with his napkin in turn. “I’m sure she told you she’s my godmother. She won’t be satisfied until I’m happily settled down.”
rose-on-the-mountain said: “tony WHY.” “its a garage sale, you’re SUPOSED to buy strangely compelling useless crap
It's a spectacularly bad idea. The whiskey doesn't even burn anymore as he swallows it down, down to the bottom of his second bottle. Not that anyone would notice or care; certainly not the bartender whom Tony is sure to tip well. The guy's gotten used to seeing Tony these past few weeks, knows Tony isn't there to cause trouble or get sloppy drunk.
"Who?" the word cracks and Tony knows he sounds scared and he desperately wishes he had his suit. "Steve, I… I don’t understand."
“Come on, Vic. Where the fuck are you?” he muttered, casting frantic glances between Steve and Pierce. He watched Steve take a step forward, swore, and grabbed at Steve’s uniform just as Pierce fired again. Without Tony to stop the momentum, Steve wheeled backward, tripped over Tony, and fell into the harbor.
Tony made no move to stop him, but twisted just a little to take Victor’s glass from the bartop. He saluted Victor with it and purred, “Down the hatch, Victor,” smirking as the other man went to his knees.
Tony stared at Victor’s back, the tense and tired lines of it, and in another life, he might have stayed, might have reached out and tried to ease whatever burden was on Victor’s shoulders. Instead, he turned on his heel and marched out. With a snap of his fingers and Jarvis’ assistance, the Variant followed.
Tony prayed; he prayed hard in the span of a breath, knowing what was coming and knowing that he couldn’t give Steve what he wanted.
“I really hate you sometimes,” Tony muttered, rolling his eyes as Victor’s laughter tumbled around his speakers.
“They brought me into your relationship. Now, I’m going to show them how it’s done before I bow out.” Pepper snaps her fingers. “With your permission, of course.”
He looked over to Tony then, and if he was surprised to see Tony awake, he didn’t show it. Perhaps he’d noticed the change in Tony’s breathing, the shift in the atmosphere when you’re no longer the only awareness in the room. He just kept talking like Tony had been listening the entire time.
Warmth, unbidden, flooded through Tony at Steve’s exclamation of delight. Always the same, day after day they met, always pleased and still just a little surprised, and always sweeping forward to offer his hand to Tony. They didn’t shake anymore, though, because Steve had taken to just holding Tony’s hand for a moment or two longer than Tony should have liked, but found he didn’t really mind.
“You know by now that I don’t really keep a schedule, but right now, you’re at the top of the list, Cap,” Tony replied, “Though, right below the Marian Koshland Science Museum today. There’s a group of prospective engineers visiting, and I wanted to surprise them with Dum-E and U. I figured the robots would get a kick out of it. They love playing with children. So I ca-”
Jarvis understands that, while its not explicit consent, it is tentative. So he does the very human concept of giving in, and lifts the suit's hand to Pepper's side. His alloy fingers clutch loosely at the expensive fabric of her blouse, and he hears through multiple speakers the shaky sigh she gives to Tony's mouth.
“The same thing you made me think,” Steve interrupted, words clipped and tone short. His hand had made a fist against the case. “Don’t pretend you’re offended when you lied for months to my face.”
Tony swore, low and vicious, and banked sharply to the right as a structural warning for the Holland Tunnel blared across the HUD. It brought him into the middle of the attack as he slammed down to the ground in the mouth of the tunnel and immediately destroyed two of the closest bots with a repulsor blast. In the next moment, his panels were opening to dispense his projectiles. Their ion trails glowed blue in the flickering lights of the tunnel as they pressed all along the collapsing concrete ceiling. Blue webbing spread out between them, their humming pitching higher as they all connected and drove upward as one to support the tunnel’s shape.
He’s an asshole. He’s such an asshole. Only an asshole would want to risk civilian lives and the safety of his friends just to feel needed, useful.
“I know it’s really out there,” Steve starts to babble. “Just by the, um, general responses I got back from searching more about it. If it’s too much, I-we can try something else. I just,” he sighs. “I just thought I’d show you.”
Steve lets out a shuddering moan, sounding punched out from the gut and he’s nearly biting through his lip. “M-Move it,” he orders, words barely audible over his moan.
The champagne was flowing freely, among other things, and Tony was just about to finish his last glass and find Pepper. He’d sworn that’s where he was going, following the sound of her soft laughter. But suddenly, he was in a completely different room, a warm mouth on his and hands sliding up under his shirt.
“America’s Sweetheart?” Tony offered blandly. He followed behind Steve as he created a path through the lunch crowds.
“Mr. Hogan has been cleared on all levels, sir,” Jarvis responded, and if Tony wasn’t mistaken, he sounded a little uptight as if Tony had insulted his AI by even questioning.
He touches her with the thick, blunt fingers of the gauntlets, slides over her skin with careful strokes. He cups her breasts, learns the shape of her bottom and the strong muscles of her thighs.
Which would mostly likely occur if he couldn’t get the stop bleeding everywhere. If Crossbones didn’t kill him first. He blinked dazedly up at Crossbones, tipping his head back against the car’s fender.
After all, all he could blame then was that the copycat simply wanted to ruin any chance of Tony revealing his identity for fear of reprisal. It couldn’t be that simple, could it?
“I think it’s great,” Ty said, spreading his hands. “Clean it up a little and fix the sour notes in the chorus, and I think you’ll have another number one, Tones.”
“This isn’t something you mentioned when we were first talking about...kinks,” he gets the word out with only a slight hesitation, but then he’s soldiering on. “But when I was searching the internet about some of those things… I found this. And… It’s… I’m…”
They stared at one another for a long, tense moment, and then Victor huffed, the sound of his surrender. He dragged his fingers down from Tony’s shirt, smearing blood down further as it came to the fastenings of Tony’s pants.
“If I say yes, will you vote for me?” Tony asked, batting his lashes at Steve. The effect was muted due to the sunglasses he’d finally put on, but Steve still rolled his eyes.
“Yes, exact number undetermined. Survivors appear to be barricading themselves inside the Newport Center and emergency services cannot break the line to retrieve them. There are multiple officers down.”
Despite Tony’s melancholy, Steve was insistent. Mouthing at the base, he slid his lips up Tony’s shaft to the tip to taste, and Tony moaned softly, body twitching into hardening awareness.
Tony wants to pull his hands free, drag Steve's hips forcibly into each thrust, but Steve's grip is tight, unyielding, and he starts to meet each thrust on his own. His skin is positively slick with sweat, the beads of it dropping to splash against Tony's skin.
Two days after that lunch, an explosion took out three terminals in the Fort Worth Meacham International Airport. Tony wasn’t even in the country, let alone Texas, but to his furious realization as he watched the news, the world thought Iron Man was. And by all accounts, he was, but it wasn’t him… Victor played the tapes over, reviewing the footage, as Tony combed through the data the investigators had gathered or left behind.
Tony couldn’t stop arching his back. He kept pushing against Steve’s hand, pushing into Steve’s mouth. The heat of him, the wet stroke of his tongue, the tightness of his throat. It was maddening, driving Tony higher and higher, until he was left with tremors under his skin that radiated out from every point of contact with Steve.
“Sometimes they want to do tests,” Steve said with a shrug, “Which, yeah, I can see why, but when they want to make the injuries worse just to s-”
“Now wait just one minute!” Steve shook himself out of his confused daze and turned around again in time to see Thor haul another person through Doom’s portal. This man was thinner, paler, and giving off an aura of bored detachment.
“I just need to borrow Mr. Stark. We’ll send you the mock-up,” she says and then she’s dragging Tony out of the chair and the plug ratchets up further and his knees buckle, but Pepper’s grip is tight and she’s dragging him out of the cafe and to the elevator. His pants are shifting all over his cock and he’s panting now.
She smiled. “I know. I am sorry that no one else answered your call, but Hydra is formidable. I’m not surprised.” She patted Iron Man’s chest and turned to Frank as he approached.
“Our Lady of Loreto,” Rogers replied, his grin matching Tony’s then turning a bit sly. “District Champion four years in a row.”
“-nd then they start taking off the tires! Now, Buck was definitely way more interested in things like that, but I gotta admit that it looked real neat. When the car started to hover, I think everyone thought it was just a magic trick, so they weren’t surprised to see it fail. But…”
