That caused Tony's eyebrows to knit together. Alright, he could admit that was true. Once he went back to Malibu following Stark Expo, he did check to see if anything went missing in his lab and had JARVIS to a total system scan for any files that were changed or tampered with. The only changes, uploads, and downloads that were done while she was there were ones that he had done himself. Likewise, there was nothing suspicious that happened after he left her alone in his lab while he talked to Steve. Nothing was touched while he had his back turned and once he left to go deal with the crazy rock guy, the only thing she did – according to both Steve and JARVIS – was turn off the holographic screens and the lights in the lab. That was it.
Steve held on to the wire he had grabbed onto for dear life. While waiting for Tony to give him the go-ahead and hit the lever, a group of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that had been turned by Loki ambushed him and during the struggle, he ended up getting knocked off the ship. Fortunately, at the last second, he managed to grab onto a wire dangling from the ship. He tried to use it to pull himself back up to safety but was finding it difficult given how thin and smooth the wire's surface was. Over the coms, he could hear Tony straining as he tried to get the turbines up to speed. He tried to hurry. If he didn't get there in time…
he mentally added.
"Oh really?" Pepper raised an eyebrow. "And you got you medical degree from…?"
"You don't understand," Freeman said. "The press is absolutely…"
Happy Deadpool Day! Please don't be too pissed that this chapter once again only features original characters.
As he was dragged, Loki saw there was no point in keeping up the façade and tried to fight back as best as he could. Although whatever had been wrong with his spine had now been fixed, he was still in an immense amount of pain from the other 128 broken bones throughout his body. Nonetheless, he still tried to hit, kick, twist, and do anything he could to get this person to let him go. He shouted that he was the (now former, but he didn't mention that) Regent of Asgard and demanded that they release him immediately and even tried to stab his captor with one of his concealed daggers. They immediately grabbed his hand and arm, twisting his wrist until he let go of the dagger with a loud and agonized scream. Once it hit the ground, the stranger quickly scooped it up and held the blade to his throat.
"Besides, you ended up not recommending me anyways," Tony said. "So, it's not like it mattered in the end."
"It couldn't be helped." Bruce turned his gaze to the envelope inside the box. "Is there anything else in there?"
"Mmhm," Tony agreed as he stared disappointedly at the center screen. Pepper gave him a friendly peck on the cheek.
"I'm okay," he assured again. Steve nodded before glancing around the room.
people would have called 911 or taken him directly to the hospital. No one takes a distressed person back to their house, especially if they're intoxicated."
"Why you're trying to use a dead woman's personal information." Carol could only blink in confusion.
physiology and health, I was ignored." Tony frowned.
"Steve." He broke out of his mental anguish and looked at Tony again. He had rolled over on his side, so he was facing Steve and his lips were tight with concern. "Are you okay? You seemed like you were a million miles away there for a second."
Where am I? What are this? Who are you?
"Didn't you?"
"Or kids," Betty added.
"I take it there's a difference?"
"Are you an expert on that?" Steve asked.
"Other than the Howard thing," Tony said. "No, I didn't."
Obviously, his beliefs were rather radical and didn't do much to help him make connections or find friends, so he spent most nights alone, studying the men he admired most: Fidel Castro, Mao Zedong, and Karl Marx. Occasionally he could charm a girl or two, but often it ended much like this night, with him walking the streets back to his dorm room alone.
"Do you have anything going for you? Anything at all?" He brightened up at that question.
"I think you'll find, sir, that Agent Romanoff will be more than capable of getting Mrs. Sharpton to talk." Hill nodded, giving Natasha permission to go ahead and join Sharpton. As Nat turned, she heard the Chief give a loud guffaw.
Tony shut his eyes as Steve's arms wrapped around him. He felt him press a kiss to the side of his head, and Tony buried his face in the juncture between Steve's neck and shoulder. He took a deep breath in and savored the moment. Steve wasn't going to hold him like this forever or ever again. He needed to cherish it.
"Alright," Clint said. "I can kind of see how that would be creepy."
"No, I don't know," Clint said. "Because it's normal to become attached to people."
"You just look a little pale," Steve said. "And warm…"
"Ah," Lara commented. "One of those mornings." She tried to get a look at what he was doing but found it hard as from where she was standing behind the counter, Bruce's writing looked upside down. It also didn't help that English was her second language. "What are you doing? Anything I can help with?"
"Wait," Steve said at the same time as he scanned the screen of his cell phone. "Natasha just texted me back. No word from S.H.I.E.L.D. yet, but the EMS system in the meeting room is reporting an explosion somewhere near Hell's Kitchen. She says it's probably best if we're on standby to respond."
"A nuclear deterrent," Tony finished for him. "Because that always calms everything right down."
"It's just…" Margot sighed. "As wonderful as ascension is, I'm just worried I'm going to miss this."
He was running up the hill, running to the farmhouse. He once again froze when he saw the sheer amount of destruction, his heart sinking, his universe collapsing. Continuing to follow the same pattern, he ran up to Natasha when he saw her sifting through the ruble. He said the same lines he said a thousand times, but this time something unexpected happened. He could hear her.
"Then count me in as well," Bruce said.
"Not that kind of sick, honey," she said. "You're not that kind of sick, and even if you were I would never allow you to be put into an asylum. They would have to step over my dead body first. I would never let you be treated like that. No one should ever be treated like that."
"Not the kind I know," Steve said. "And certainly not the kind you want."
"Precisely." Tony handed the tablet back to the woman behind him.
They spent much of the afternoon and night sleeping and chatting. The conversations weren't too heavy – given that neither of them felt like crying again – just about whatever came to mind. No one disturbed them. Natasha came in to give them their dinner, but she didn't say much and made herself scarce as fast as possible. It was just them being quiet and holding each other close. After the day they had, it was the kind of peaceful night they deserved. It was nice.
"Do you know why Romanoff sent you the video, though?" Pepper looked around, unsure of how to answer.
"Second-degree murder, first-degree assault." Dante visibly winced at that.
"Thank you for inviting me," Bruce said.
"It was a false alarm," Carol said. "Stark paged me accidentally and I was too hasty in my response."
"I'm sorry," he said. "What's your name? I didn't catch it before."
"Already on it," he said. "I've had HR put the word out and they've sent me a few profiles."
"I'm sorry," she said. "I should have listened to you and stuck with the plan." Steve shook his head as he pulled back.
"Alright," she said. "You two done trying to prank everyone awake?" She didn't wait to see Tony and Lara's nods of the agreement before telling them to get out. They both complied wordlessly, still seeming somewhat stunned by what had just happened. Natasha closed the door behind them and turned back to Clint with arms crossed. "What the hell was that?"
"And by taking the time to allow us to recover properly." Clint sighed.
"No," Steve said. "Can that happen?"
Tony's heart swelled. A smile was on his face as he leaned forward and kissed Steve's cheek. Steve responded with a kiss on the lips. Settling back in to get some rest, he could feel his entire body buzzing with ecstatic energy. It took a while for him to fall asleep properly, but his last thought before he drifted off was
"I must have muted him," Tony said. "I was already three bottles gone, so I wasn't going to listen anyways."
"Well, probably any American cheeseburger would have sufficed after experiencing that hell," Tony said. "It just so happened that Burger King was the closest burger joint to the airport at the time, but that's not the point. Eat up, Cap. I know you're probably starving."
Lara brushed her hair out of her face before settling her hands down to rest in her lap. The way she looked up at the ceiling – as if she were searching for the words of God himself – told Tony she was carefully considering the words she was about to say. She only did this when she had something important to say and wanted to be sure that her English was as clear and precise as it could be. When she felt sure of herself, she looked Tony directly in the eye.
"Why are you still even talking to me?" Steve asked. "If you knew all along, why didn't you tell S.H.I.E.L.D.? Why do you keep wanting to be with me? Why did you let me sleep in your bed with you?" Tony's face went pale.
"Not now," Tony practically groaned. "JARVIS, send him to voicemail."
"You're already familiar with each other," she stated.
"And the fact that coincides with Happy Hour at T.G.I. Friday's has nothing to do with it." This time, Tony shot Lara a glare.
Steve had to admit, he was decently surprised when the plane touched down in Washington D.C. He wasn't sure what Tony's plan was, but he could already say the man went above and beyond all expectations for a date – let alone a platonic outing between friends.
"Following's not really my style," Tony remarked. "Nor is it really yours Mr. Sneaks-Across-Enemy-Lines-Against-Orders-to-Save-His-Best-Friend."
"My mother was a nurse," Steve explained. "When I was a kid, she'd take any work she could get at any hospital, including the sanitarium. She didn't work there long, though, only a day. No amount of money could make up for the horrors she witnessed there."
Lara tried getting ahold of Tony once again, but still, all she got was a busy signal. She tried calling Pepper next, but her phone rang several times before going to voicemail. She then tried Steve, hoping that he was with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Tony as well so that he could pass on the message, but no dice. She thought about calling either Tony's bodyguard Happy Hogan or his best friend, Col. James Rhodes, but both were on the other side of the country and were unlikely to be of any help. Finally, Lara called 911, just to make sure they were on their way. That ended up being the most productive phone call as the police needed details that JARVIS just couldn't give them, such as identifying marks, the attackers' demeanor, and what exactly they were capable of. Lara assumed a lot given how painful that punch to the face was.
For about twenty minutes she laid awake before she realized she wasn't going to fall back to sleep. Seeing as it was only thirty minutes or so before she needed to be up anyways, she gave up on sleep and started to get ready. Having showered the night before, all Lara really needed to do was get dressed and put on her makeup. By the time she finished, the hotel's phone rang, notifying her of her scheduled wake up call.
But being able to actually
One day Tony and Morgan set their stuff on the beach chairs next to their spot, and Steve raises an eyebrow in confusion.
“And right now that I’d actually have thousand of things to do, I can feel my dreams shattering but I can’t think about anything but you.”
Tony’s hand is still holding his, and Tony strokes it with affection. “Whenever you’re ready” he reassures him with another smile, and Steve thinks this is what love sounds like.
Tony’s brows draw closer. “Is this okay? I assumed you were interested but maybe I jumped to conclusions-“
Steve makes a face at it, confusion clear in his eyes, and Tony raises an eyebrow. “Are we- hanging out?” Steve tentatively asks, and Tony frowns ever more.
Tony on his own lips; to look him in the eyes at such little distance; to
He asks himself if the situation might be different now that Steve’s next to him, but the truth is that his chest will still be empty, and the room will still be dark.
“I was actually hoping for you to do this a long time before,
“Yes, honey?”, Steve shifts even closer, his chest pressing on Tony’s back, his chin resting on his slightly curly hair.
“But I want it to be you to wear it”, Tony adds and quickly answers to Steve’s questioning look, “so now when it’s all dark, and I see a blue light, I not only remember I’m alive, but that you’re with me too”.
“Me too” Steve replies right away.
Morgan’s friend groans. “Here he goes” she mumbles. “I’m here!” she then exclaims, waving her arms.
Tony stares at it for an instant, feeling a little off-balance- if because of the hot sun or the hot stranger he doesn't really know.
“Or maybe we could rotate this tower right here, in this way it would be proportioned” the other small voice talks again. “We would just have to make that fort a little wider.”
When it’s finally their turn, Morgan and Mary take a large chocolate ice cream, and Tony already dreads about the moment he’s gonna have to wash away the stains on Morgan’s dress.
A few seconds of silence. “Actually, the height is double time that side, so we should add three
Panting because of his back ache, Steve finally closed his eyes and inspired deeply only for a brief moment. Then he opened his eyes once again, not looking in front of him but on his left, and while smiling softly he nodded nostalgic.
Eventually they had learnt to get along with each other, but Steve knew that lowkey there was an implicit bond within the two of them that just stated they had to respect the other in order to ensure peace.
Hearing it loud and clear suddenly frees his chest from a very heavy weight, and Steve lets out an exhale, smiling too. “Thank you” he murmurs.
“And you’re a big mouth” he claps back while Mary keeps on giggling. He stays quiet for a couple of seconds, waiting for the little girl to give him her response.
The rush of the previous attack has left him quite worn out, and even though he has now come back to all his senses, he still feels tired and kind of sleepy. He’s starting to feel a hint of anxiety pooling in his stomach again at the thought that he’s about to spend another sleepless night.
“Yes, yes he did!” Steve confirmed “He’s a hero, Morgan. Your dad is a hero”, then hugged the little girl while mumbling again “Tony is a hero”, perhaps mostly to himself.
The man chuckles. “Yeah, it’s a little annoying when they remind you just how dumb of a child you were in comparison” he jokes tilting his head, a small embarrassed movement that Tony finds adorable.
Tony walks holding her hand, and there is a very annoying voice inside his mind which reminds him that he has another hand, and Steve has one too, and it would be easy for them to hold each other, but Tony decided not to do this in front of the little girls, so he keeps his arm along his body, shutting down that voice.
“This sounds incredibly interesting” Tony claps back with a resolute tone. “I love art, even though I’m probably too dumb to understand what’s going on.”
“When my wife passed away,” Steve prompts after a while. “Mary was stil very young. Sometimes it pains me more to know she won’t have any real memory of her, more than what
And still, it’s not like this kinda friendly date is so important, but it’s the first time Steve is going out since his wife passed away, and Mary is well aware of that.
Mary gives him a sheepishly smile, but her eyes are bright, and Tony suddenly feels uncomfortable. “You’ve met her today?” he asks to his daughter. Sounds weird that the beach of Palm Springs hosts two little geniuses at the same time, but yeah, life is full of coincidences, so.
Tony looked at him, gratitude in his eyes, heartfelt thanks for having collected his broken pieces from the ground, for trying to put it back together but it still, it
“Don’t leave” he left out in a whisper, and for a moment he really thought he had not said that out loud.
, how he likes this guy!
He cheers in his mind, and goes on drawing, contently looking at the piece as it starts taking life under his pencil. Tony has such a perfect bone structure that it’s truly a pleasure to Steve to impress it on paper, and he’s not a little bit annoyed by the fact that he has to look more minutely at Tony’s features to get them right.
The thing highly pleases Tony, and when the blond man waves his hand and turns to walk away, Tony pushes himself to be a little bolder.
He arrived at the end of the path, right where the grass and the flowers were now replaced by the sand of a hidden shore that directly led to the ocean. He stopped from proceeding further and with some difficulty he sat down on the sand.
“I love you too” she says, imitating Morgan’s confession.
“Quite nice” he comments with a grin, and he smoothers his thumb over Tony’s wrist. He can spot Tony shivering at that, his gaze growing more focused on him.
Tony can almost see a light, a tiny flame trembling like his heart; his hands quieten, they are no longer strained with terror, they now feel like limbs again, and softly fall on his lap. His teeth loosen a little, but his lips are still parted and swollen with tears.
Steve turns on the spot, and flashes him another bright smile. The sunlight of the golden hour hits him ruthlessly, and he looks like a damn greek god under it.
Tony sticks his tongue out at it, confirming his statement, but then he keeps on helping him anyway.
Steve grabbed both of his hands, forcing him to step closer, then placed one hand on his back and quietly rested his head on the socket between Tony’s neck and shoulder.
“We should go too” Steve proposes nodding at the girls.
was the only thing he could think about.
Steve gives him a lopsided smile. “Yeah, I always worry with her” he confesses. “People look at her with a judging face. She’s not the typical five year old child, and not everyone is comfortable with that.” He tightens his lips. “I don’t want her to feel judged, you know.”
And when he had found out he was starting to feel attached to Steve, he had felt so scared. Because he was sure the more he was going to enjoy his presence, the more it was going to hurt when it would all end.
Steve cackled, and for the first time that morning he felt a joyful stitch in his chest “You used to call me grandpa because of my doubtful fashion choices, but now that I really look like one, Tony- Oh, you would have laughed
He looked in the distance, his smile slowly dying: upon the ocean dark clouds seemed to approach. It was going to rain that afternoon.
"Bullshit!"
"Have they been in anything recently?"
"He asked for you by name," Dr. Fox said, but had to add "Lord only knows why." Tony didn't care. If Steve was asking for him, then Tony still had a chance to really talk to him. Tony turned and looked at Fury expectantly. The Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. gave Tony a hard stare.
"I'd rather not put anything on my stomach right now." Steve nodded in understanding. "Besides, you're my guest. I should be asking you that question."
"Uh…" Pepper looked up at the ceiling, trying to recall. "Me, Lara, Happy… Romanoff and Barton… I think Dr. Banner…?"
"It means
"Shit," Hill cursed.
"So, we're back to a first name basis now, huh?" Tony pushed himself to sit up. Steve felt like he'd gotten the wind knocked out of him. His gaze went down to the floor. "What? Nothing to say to that? You seemed to have plenty to say before."
"You're serious?" Bruce nodded. "Holy hell! I didn't realize you've been holed up in there since September. How have you not gone stir crazy?"
"Nothing we can do about it now." Tony kept his gaze fixed ahead of him.
"Rhodey," Tony said. "But you already know that. Besides, there's only so much he can do from California."
Steve and Natasha confronted the people who sent the biological weapon to Avengers Tower and learn that while the virus is no longer contagious, anyone infected with it only has a 50/50 chance of survival.
"So, they were specifically targeting us?" Lara nodded in response to Bruce's question. "Then why were you telling us not to be concerned before?"
"How about this," he said. "I have the key to all the rooms. If you stop harassing me to get ready, we can go wake up the others." Lara's face lit up. Yeah, he thought she'd like that.
"Okay…" Without another word, Tony was enveloped by the darkness of sleep.
Steve was absolutely devastated by the words. Even if he knew it was coming, it didn't make them hurt any less.
he thought.
"I beg your pardon?"
"My room?" Tony questioned.
Quiet. That was the first thing Tony observed once he flew through the portal; everything was quiet. He was deep in the depths of space. He wished he could say that he was impressed. Growing up watching things like
"Yeah," Tony agreed. "It does…" He frowned. Something about this gave him a bad feeling. His brain was telling him that there was probably a connection there, but he so badly not wanted it to be true. He really didn't need that right now. He didn't need any of the problems that were on his plate right now but there was really nothing he could do other than face them head-on. Lara, meanwhile, looked slightly defeated as she raked a hand through her hair.
"So," Bruce said. "If you don't mind me asking, when do you start therapy?"
"Hey, Lara," he said. "The ten-forty to Philadelphia starts boarding in a few minutes! We have to go!" Lara watched as Lucy's face fell.
"Private homes," Steve pointed out.
sitting around at home," Lara said. "Seriously, I got a lot more entertainment sitting in the ER waiting room watching patients come and go. I even started on the first draft of a TV pilot based on what I saw down there. The working title is
"We're S.H.I.E.L.D.," Clint argued.
"You, too." She then made her way to the door but paused as she came to stand in the frame. She turned to look back at him. "By the way, text me in thirty minutes." Tony's brow scrunched in confusion.
"Yes please."
Tony sighed.
"James! Rebecca!" she shouted. "Didn't I tell you to go play outside?" Bucky most likely gave some sort of response, because the next thing she said was "I don't care what Rebecca did, I told you kids to go outside, so go!"
Carol hesitated a moment as she approached the entrance. For a moment, she questioned whether the door was alarmed or if it really was open for the public. Pulling the door handle back, she found it to be unlocked and took that as all the permission she needed to proceed.
"Well, don't scream at him and grab him," Lara said. "That's probably a start."
Gathering up all the wrappings and tags, Carol threw them in the white bag, along with her previous set of underwear. There was no way she'd be able to wear them again, so she was better off throwing them out as well. Collecting the johnny off the floor, Carol draped it over her arm before crumpling the bag into the tightest ball she could. She then left the stall, tossing the bag in the trash on her way out of the bathroom.
"Just tell me yes or no. Was there water in that glass?"
This time, Steve complied, sliding into the seat next to Tony. He suddenly seemed a little tense and that wasn't the first time tonight. Tony wanted to put his hand on Steve's shoulder again, but he worried that would just make things worse. So, he settled for purely verbal forms of comfort this time.
"It's nearly midnight," Morse pointed out.
"Yeah," Bruce said. "I hadn't planned on that. She found me and I just pulled her into that whole mess." Bruce ran a hand through his hair. "I put her in such a bad position. She even tried to sell her mother's necklace to get us enough money to get to New York. I got it back for her, but still…" Bruce lifted his head up, allowing Lara to see the glimmer of sadness in his eyes. "It's just best that I'm not around her. She's safer and better off that way." Lara frowned.
Tony was sitting upright before he even fully woke up. He panted hard and his eyes darted around the room. His panic increases as he failed to recognize his surroundings. The dark blue walls and the paintings hanging on them were unfamiliar and started closing in on him. That was until he looked down to his left and saw Steve peacefully asleep in the bed beside him. It was only then that Tony had the presence of mind to try to relax.
Only a small one, though, as he was only halfway to Steve. To get the rest of the way there, he had to go around to the other side of the penthouse and take the local elevator up to the apartment. On the way there, he passed by the archway that led to the communal kitchen. He popped his head in to make sure Steve wasn't in there and saw Bruce at the stove, cooking a meal that Tony could only guess was a type of curry. It smelled good and before he left, Bruce told him to tell Steve that dinner would be ready in ten minutes. Tony told him that he would, but honestly he doubted he'd remember to once he had Steve close, even if the food smelled
"I'm fine," Steve assured once again. "I was expecting something bad anyways."
"Why?" Steve questioned. "What's wrong with Tony?"
"Alright," Pepper said. "I'll see you then." The call then ended. Tony then slipped his phone back into his coat pocket and followed Wallace down the maze of hallways that led to the chemical engineering department.
"I'll tell you in a minute," Dr. Smith said. "Just get back into bed."
It would be a long time before Rhodey would question Tony's mental state like that again. In that time, Tony would have publicly acknowledged his bisexuality and put those tapes far behind him. The name "Tiberius Stone" would become forgotten to the distant past, and Tony would learn to roll with the punches and grow a thicker skin about what the media had to say about him. He would get kidnapped across the world, have an electromagnet placed in his chest to save his life, be betrayed by the man whom he had come to consider a father figure and a friend, and become a superhero. It would not be until Rhodey caught a glimpse of dark lines crawling up Tony's neck and watched him carry out the most reckless behavior he had ever seen that Rhodey would let the thought haunt him again. Even then, he would struggle to accept it.
However, as he walked into the room, he caught a glimpse of a figure lying on one of the exam beds through the door leading to the med bay. Right away, he went to investigate and found Lara fast asleep. Careful not to be too abrupt, Bruce called out her name until she started to stir. She seemed slightly out of it and quickly mumbled an apology and said something about staying in the guest room downstairs. He helped her make her way back to bed. After that, he went about the rest of his night, heading to bed around ten o'clock.
Thank you to mfaerie32 for the review on FFN! It really means a lot!
"Nah," Lara said. "Pepper already ordered us food, so we're good." Steve looked relieved, clearly glad to hear that Tony was eating as he should be. Knowing that he appreciated that, Lara moved on to different matters. "Hey, Natasha. There is something Tony wants you to do. Would you mind doing it?"
"Tony…" Pepper started to say but was quickly interrupted.
"You tell me." Natasha sighed.
, but it was nice to get a sort of broad-scope view of what had happened in the time he was gone and physically seeing some of it would probably help his understanding when he went do dig deeper into some of these topics later.
That was why he and Steve were going to keep their interactions as low-key as possible in front of the press. Steve wasn't ready to come out of the closet yet and Tony knew that if they didn't do it in the right way, the press would rip them to shreds. It was probably best that they didn't take that step right now anyways. After all, they hadn't even been out on a proper date yet.
"Sir, are you okay?" Tony took a shuddering breath.
"Yeah," Tony said. "That's just previews. This is opening night and Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right? He wants flowers, he wants parades. He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered…" Right then, Tony's eyes went wide. He quickly pulled out of the embrace and his hands went to the phone in his back pocket. It only took one tap of the screen for Tony to find what he was looking for. "Son of a bitch," he cursed.
"I don't hate it." Tony gave Steve a disbelieving look. "Okay, I think it's obnoxious, but you like it."
don't have to do this.
"Son of a bitch!" Rhodey wanted to say so much worse, preferably while punching Stone in the face repeatedly. He deserved that in the very least, especially with what he knew was about to happen.
Bruce could only imagine what Lara responded to that with. Sighing, he got up and opened the door to his bedroom.
"Uh, no." Pepper's hand moved to adjust a non-existent loose piece of hair. "Actually, could you take a seat? You might want to be sitting down for this."
"When it takes me away from you?" Tony questioned. "Yeah, I do." Steve gave him a sympathetic look.
"What, Mommy's mad that I kept Stevie out past curfew?"
Which was natural to assume. After all, a guy dressed like Michael Myers just put a camera over a hotel room bed. Anyone with half a brain cell would assume that someone was about to be raped and murdered on camera. Hitting the fast forward button on the VCR, Rhodey retrieved the phone from its cradle on the side table, trying to remember what the number for the FBI was.
"Yeah," Tony said. "I'll talk to you Monday."
"That saying sounds so weird when you say it," Tony deflected. "Something with the accent."
"Shut up," she grumbled.
"Oh," Carol said trying to stifle a laugh. "Lucky for you, I can remember this." Tony gave her a questioning look, but Carol acted like she didn't see it. "Uh, it was hard," she said, pulling herself together more seriously. "I'm not going to pretend like it wasn't. I mean, as tough of a choice as it was to make, it was even harder to stick with it." Tony nodded in understanding.
"I highly doubt Romanoff would go to the trouble of acting as your PA for the day just so she could steal office supplies." Tony snapped his fingers.
Honestly, Steve wasn't sure what to make of Captain Danvers. He did feel indebted to her for finding Tony and getting him to safety during that whole debacle in D.C. However, at the same time, he questioned why she was not up front about her abilities from the get-go. Tony, he understood. He did not seem surprised by Carol's powers, so it was clear that he knew about them, but at the same time, when he last saw her, he was very heavily intoxicated. It was quite possible that Carol had demonstrated her powers to him and he wrote it off as an alcohol-induced hallucination. Conceivably, he could have known about it and not known at the same time, so Steve could easily give him a pass on that one.
"Clint…"
"Sugar." Tony's brow immediately furrowed. "A bunch of other weird flavors I can't identify…" Tony took the burger from Steve's hand and bit into it. It tasted like a regular cheeseburger to him.
"What is this?" he asked.
It was a very flimsy story. She had no way to verify it if questioned. However, outside of posing as a recruit herself – the idea of which gave her one of the worst bad feelings she'd ever had – it was her best way of getting answers without hurting anyone.
"But none of those options seem likely," Duran said. "I mean, why go breaking into the headquarters of one of the top international corporations if you aren't trying to make some sort of statement? I don't know about you, but to me, it has the words 'extremist cell' written all over it."
"I don't know about that," he said. "I mean, anything's got to be better than the prequels." Bruce hummed non-committedly while Natasha shook her head.
"I can do this," Tony assured. "Trust me, I can." Steve nodded.
The one silver lining was that Steve had stayed by his side the entire time; even through the worst of it. That was like a blessing to Tony. He honestly didn't think he would have made it out alive if Steve hadn't been there. Deep in his heart, Tony knew that he was going to owe him for that forever.
Hanging up the phone, Rhodey headed back over to the TV, not even chancing a glance at the screen. He kept his gaze on the VCR's stop and eject buttons until the screen went blue and the tape popped out of the loading bay. As soon as it was out, Rhodey took it and stormed out the front door of his house, heading straight for the driveway.
"No one's come or gone," he said. "And Selvig's clean. No contacts, no IMs." Clint followed Fury up to the platform that held the machine that was controlling the Tesseract. Just looking at the cube, it wasn't apparent that anything strange was going on. It just sat there, glowing the same light blue color it had been for the past few months. If Clint didn't know better, he'd think that everyone was getting all flustered about nothing. However, he did know better and he had his own suspicions about what was going on. "If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end."
"That man I was talking to before," he said. "Stark… Tony… Can I see him again?" Dr. Fox stopped in his tracks and hesitated a moment.
A beat of silence passed. Tony squeezed his eyes shut as if that would protect him from their pity. He could feel Steve softly rubbing his thumb over his knuckles.
"Shawarma?" Natasha shrugged.
These were only the first ten entries on Tony's list of horrible things that could happen to someone that would keep them from calling you. Normally Tony wouldn't be worried about something as silly as a phone call, but he just wanted to know that Steve was okay. He knew none of these options were even likely. He wasn't teasing Steve when he said that the super soldier probably didn't know how to work a phone. However, writing all of this down did ease his fears a little bit. Plus, it was serving as a good distraction from the thorough chewing out he was getting from the members of the board, so that served as a nice bonus.
"What was that?" Natasha didn't even bother to look at him.
"No problem," Conroy assured.
"Prevention?" Steve questioned.
"Oh yeah," Pepper agreed.
"Agent Romanoff could hear," Steve pointed out.
"No, they're not," Natasha said. "We didn't do it on the basis of your sexualities."
"Yeah," Bruce slowly agreed. A concerned expression crossed Betty's face.
"And you'll tell us, right?" Hill nodded.
"Well, I also sat here for a while wondering if I could modify that defibrillator to put out enough volts to kill me," Stark said.
Tony then explained the events of the past two weeks. He had to condense it down a lot, but even the condensed version was quite shocking. Well, at least it sounded shocking to Tony's own ears. Rhodey didn't seem surprised at all, but that was probably because he had experienced many of Tony's drunken antics first-hand. It was all old hat to him, which only made Tony feel the slightest bit more guilty. It took a while to get it all out, and by the time he was done, Tony was sweating.
"Yeah," Tony said. "About as sexy as a truck stop men's room."
"No files have been recently downloaded," JARVIS said before Tony could finish asking the question.
Easier said than done. There was nothing happening. Even when Tony increased the video speed hoping to get a glimpse of something, nothing happened. Watching paint dry was more entertaining. He was beginning to think that the video file had somehow been tampered with to cover up the robbery. Then, something he didn't expect happened.
"Loud and clear," Knežević said. "Now do you want to explain to me what the hell that was?"
"You… You might not like everything you find," he said. "I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of."
"You too, ma'am," Steve said.
"Do you have a restraining order out against him?" he asked.
"Of course," Clint said. "You know better than anyone that nothing can be kept hidden from that woman." Natasha had to laugh at that. "Besides, even if I needed to, I don't think I'd be able to keep this from her. Not with the dreams I've been having."
Tony had been staring at the video footage for almost two full hours. He kept meaning to get into the shower, but he was so engrossed in figuring out the mystery of the video that he kept putting it off. Every time he rewound the video and played it back again, the still images would switch one second sooner. Tony was wracking his brain for some sort of an explanation for this but came up with nothing. He hoped it didn't just turn out that it was a headache and the flu making him see things. Otherwise, that meant he had just wasted two hours chasing after a red herring. That would just make him feel stupid.
"I can see that," Fury said. "Considering a whole block of New York City is gone."
"Why not?" She sounded more confused than angry or upset. "What's wrong?"
Danvers.
"I wouldn't have been in the way." Natasha raised an eyebrow to that.
Eventually, some of the officers stepped back into frame. Four of the officers paired off, each pair holding open one of the double doors. The rest seemed to form a wall on either side. Steve was unsure of what they were doing until a stream of people started to flood the path created by the officers. They were kicking out a huge group of people, probably a party judging by how disheveled and uncoordinated the people in the crowd looked. Steve frowned and leaned closer to the screen, trying to get a look at all the people in the crowd as they rushed by.

The elevator doors opened back up again, depositing them on the first level of the penthouse. They walked out into the hallway and around to the foyer where the express elevator was located.
"Oswin," he repeated. "That's a strange name."
"Yes," Pepper said. "I really hate to tell you this, but they took more than enough hydrogen and oxygen to cause an explosive reaction, along with sodium, aluminum, and carbon." Tony's eyes immediately widened, and he almost didn't notice Wallace had unlocked the door for him to come in. His mind began listing off all the horrible things that one could make with those combinations of elements. As Pepper had already mentioned, hydrogen and oxygen had an explosive reaction when combined, but the other ones had reactions that could be just as devastating.
"Stark! Come on! You need to get up!" Steve pulled her back from the door.
"Still," Tony said. "There's a time and a place for everything. My front lobby isn't it."
"Ah, yes," Tony said. "I really liked that moment. Care to revisit it?"
"Any ideas on who they might be?" Tony asked.
Without warning, though, he saw a flash of red go by and the shooting came to a halt. Steve rushed to his feet and made his way down to the doorway where the shooter had taken up his position. Looking inside, he saw the shooter knocked unconscious on the ground and Tony lying motionless a few feet away. The lights in the helmet's eyes had flickered out.
"I don't want to hear it," Lara said. "Get out."
"Go ahead," he said. "Say what you're going to say." Salinas' face turned red faster than a stoplight.
"Mr. Stark, Miss Potts," she said. "I have something you need to see." Pepper frowned.
Tony stopped talking when he heard what sounded like a weak whimper come from the other man. He stood to get a better look at Steve's face. His eyelids twitched at a rapid pace before coming apart to reveal the clear blue irises hidden beneath. Tony grinned.
was Tony's only thought as he melted into the embrace.
Yes, just asking his AI to look up therapists for him made Tony feel wrong. He didn't know why he felt wrong, he just did and that alone disturbed him to the point where he was shaking. Time slowed down. Every second felt like a year. All Tony could think was
With that in mind, he turned back around to face Tony. He was going through a pantry but didn't need to look up to know Steve was watching him.
He watched for several minutes as his accomplice made her way through Stark Industries. A few times he heard the second set of footsteps approach her and every single time his pulse quickened with fear. However, every single time the person would go by as if they didn't even notice her. No questions were asked; no one even seemed to give her a second glance. It was both nerve-wracking and freaky.
"Uh," Steve said. Tony could easily detect the slight nervous edge in his voice. "What is your point? What do any of those things have to do with each other?" Treasa scoffed
"Yeah," he said. "The cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? Doors open from both sides."
"As it is you," Adoniram said. "Come. We can talk somewhere more private." The last thing Carol thought they needed was more privacy, but she obliged anyway, stepping through the door he held open for her. The two women in coveralls followed closely behind her while Adoniram exchanged words with the woman behind the panel.
"How?" a woman asked.
Steve, the pervert, didn't even bother with the courtesy to
bit of resentment coming from you that you were just expected to get up and get back to what you were doing without being able to properly mourn what had been taken from you."
Tony just shrugged, not agreeing but not fighting it, either, and Steve changed the channel again and said, "If I went on-record with how much I hate that song, you think I could get it banished from existence?"
"Tony," Steve said to quiet his babbling, and Tony miraculously shut up for a second, "yes," he stressed. "I agree. I completely agree."
Bucky and Sam exchanged somewhat perplexed and worrying looks, and Steve looked between them and said, "What?"
"Yeah, pretty sure this is the first time I've ever gotten pregnant."
The next time he opened his eyes, Olivia was fussing in her carrier, and Tony was actually feeling halfway decent.
Steve. It was always Steve. It was this— this
Tony just stared at her. "Could you be any more cryptic?"
“And annoy me,” Steve said and stepped onto the elevator once the doors had opened.
"Is that why you're talking into my neck?"
He looked down at his purple tank top and black yoga pants as Natasha dropped her hand from his mouth. "Why? What's wrong with this?"
"Oh, nice to see you, too," Steve said but still put a hand to his lower back and gave him a chaste kiss in greeting.
"I don't have a problem with you marrying a man, Tony," Bruce said. "I just don't think it's something you'd want us discussing."
"Out," he finished for him. "With the Avengers. Look, I don't know if Nat told you, but—"
Steve just shrugged. "Guess it's just one of those things."
"So, you just left Steve up there with the others?" Natasha asked and set Tony's one foot aside then motioned for the other one.
help acclimate Barnes back into the real world through…pretty nasty Wii bowling competitions, it looked like, so after sequestering himself in his lab, and with his machines and his stupid 'bots there to give him comfort, he called up Pepper, and the moment she picked up the phone, he said, "I think I've officially worn out my welcome with everyone."
Steve's pointed look went a little surprised at that, but it still stayed pointed.
"Oh, definitely worse if he knows Tony's having a baby while he's out in the field," Bruce agreed.
"Baby, I'm just not sure that's the one you should get."
"Ugh," he said and let Steve pull him back into an embrace. "Sounds so… Sounds like the kind of name you grow up hating because your parents were assholes and didn't think about the logistics of naming a kid 'Antonia.'"
"Yes, you do. You don't say anything unless you mean to say it. I can't tell you, Steve. And now you're doing that thing with your jaw where you're tensing it up because someone's telling you something you don't want to hear and you're thinking hard about what you're going to do next to try to convince me to tell you."
have always been a creator, a nurturer, a being concerned with harmony."
"Anyway, I think there's a Starbucks around here somewhere," Tony added, his attention now turned back to the road. "The stuff back home will be cold by the time we get back, and I know you prefer home-brewed over any of the chains, but you're the one that had the freak out and then went running down the street, so, now you've got to deal with the consequences."
him about it?"
"It looks like it hurts," she said and turned his wrist over to inspect it more fully, but he shrugged.
"Iron Cap," she repeated, drowsiness evident in her voice. "I always sleep with Iron Cap. Did that man take it?"
Tony frowned and looked from Barnes to Natasha to Bruce and back again. "But that— That doesn't mean anything. Look, you don't know about this, but Nat remembers— Last year? When we were on the run from SHIELD, or who was really Hydra? Remember when they targeted us? Bombed the bunker? We survived that—"
," beside him.
"Uh, so," he said and nodded at her purple t-shirt with the cartoon Avengers emblazoned on it. "They mass-market the Avengers?"
"Baby, I think that's a little tough for you to chew yet," he said as she bit down but then made a face and dropped the bagel back onto the table. She looked up at Tony like the bagel had personally offended her, but Tony just held out the small bite of sandwich and said, "Or you don't like cream cheese. Here, you like peanut butter and jelly, though."
His Steve was never coming home.
"Wait," Steve said and put a hand out to stop him. Something told him to do this or else miss his chance, and so with Olivia curled against Tony's chest, Steve brushed his hand over the top of her head one more time and whispered a quiet, "Good night, doll baby," and kissed her forehead. He lingered, brushing the tip of his nose against her forehead and inhaling that sweet baby scent then sat back and nodded that he was done. Tony tweaked a sad smile at him then got up and switched off the television, leaving Steve alone on the couch.
Unless this is all some bullshit Hydra plot for
"We're two
Steve blinked at him.
When the doors opened, Olivia bounded back into the living room and over to the coffee table, and she plopped down on the floor and said, "Here, Papa! We'll draw here!"
"I'm not saying that because I feel bad for myself. I'm just stating facts. Pep and I will weather this. No biggie. Now, go have fun on your date. Try not to get married while you're at it."
"Tony—"
"What?" Barton sounded personally offended. "You're the one that started it!"
It mattered not that the King was one of
(Except Peggy's, but Peggy was...not a path he wanted to travel down at this moment — not when he could still remember how her lips felt on his and the hopeful promise of a date that was never to be. He wondered briefly if she went anyway, even if just to have a drink in his memory. He couldn't even go and do as much — toast to a what-might-have-been. The club wasn't there anymore. He'd checked.)

that one? How—?"
It was stupid. It was fucking stupid, and he knew it was fucking stupid, but Jesus Christ, he was an
. So, yes, sorry for all that. I didn't mean to offend any of you."
"Oh, I'm sorry." He looked down at himself. "Do I or do I not have a super soldier spawn growing inside of me? I am allowed to say whatever the fuck I want."
Tony screwed the cap on the bottle and turned back to Steve. "All right, I know I don't look like I gave birth to her four months ago, but trust me, I gave birth to that baby. She is a Stark."
Clearly, they were all in cahoots over
"Sarah," Cap said before he could finish his thought. "After my mother. Always liked to think, if I ever had a daughter, I'd name her after my mother."
"Feel better?" he asked.
"Why do you suddenly have a problem with 'L's—? Hey! Wait, no, Papa's too old for you to do that!" he said and tried to stop her from pulling him out of the chair. "Give Papa a second."
Emotion wiped clean off Tony's face, and he stared at Steve blankly a moment then turned his attention back to Olivia, and Steve felt like he'd stepped on a landmine.
Cap fan. He, like, worshipped the ground you walked on. Tones pretty much broke the spine of his copy of that book, he read it so many times."
Tony lay there on his side and listened to Steve attempt to find some level of comfort, and after a few minutes of huffing and turning, he said, "You know, you can spoon me if you want."
He saw the blanket and pillow from where Olivia had slept on the couch in there as soon as he walked in the door, and he stopped and frowned at it a moment, something painful tugging at his heart. He waited a moment, expecting to hear a chirped, "Papa!" before a little ball of fire rushed into the room, but there was nothing aside from the hum of machinery and motors and servos, and he shook his head and scoffed a bit and went over to his workstation.
seemed odd about it. It looked like any normal living room— Well, that wasn't exactly true. It didn't look like any living room Steve had ever been in but only because it looked so
"Can't I just go upstairs to the bedroom?"
" he breathed out and pressed his head back against the pillow, curling his fingers into the sheets and squirming as Steve held him wide open and used his mouth on him in the most
"Yeah," Barnes said. "If you asked what I think you asked, yeah."
Steve merely laughed a little. "No! No, nothing like that. It's just…" He grimaced and said, "I may have already promised him you would take a look at it. It's…it's really bothering him. Bad. He doesn't know how to fix it. I said you were a genius. You'd fix it for him in no time flat."
He pulled his hand away and looked over to where Natasha stood cradling his newborn baby girl, gazing down at her and singing something in what he took to be Russian as she bounced her ever-so-gently in her arms, attempting to soothe what Tony realized was a fussy baby.
Once again, Bruce took it once the others had finished looking and inspected it, finding once again that, if it was a fake, it was indeed a well-done one.
The Hydra agent went to say something, but Tony didn't care to listen. He just blasted the fucker back into the wall.
Bruce could tell she was getting antsy, the way she kept bouncing in her chair, but he wasn't sure it was a wise move to let her anywhere near Tony at the moment. He glanced up at the ceiling, and though he hated to intrude, he said, "JARVIS, are Tony and Pepper still talking?"
But she shook her head and said, "But not in the same way. Your blood was gained at the cost of doing what you believed would save lives."
mean nothing to Tony because Tony would have offered to do this with anyone. Tony pretended to be a heartless bastard, but he was anything but. Tony knew he felt adrift in this new world, and so he was helping to ground him in any way he knew how. Someone — probably Natasha — had told him about Steve never having learned how to dance, and knowing it was something Steve wanted, Tony had taken it upon himself to teach him. Because that's what Tony did. He gave because it was in his nature to give to the people he loved most. Steve just happened to be one of those people.
you in my bed."
"Nice to have someone have my back."
But separated from those, sort of on their own little branch, were the two that were supposed to look like Captain America and Iron Man, facing each other, almost looking like they were supposed to be kissing. He didn't know who had done the decorating, but he had to believe they'd been put this way on purpose, and it was kind of cute, if he was being honest with himself. He wasn't sure if hanging them right above the 'Baby's First Christmas' ornament was intentional or not, but even if it wasn't, he had to believe there was a reason it had been done that way, why all of this was...
He wouldn't look, but he heard Steve let out a somewhat resigned breath. "Tony," he finally said, "I love you. I know that sounds like a cliché, but I love you no matter what shape you're in."
He cringed at the word usage, but DUM-E just sped off to the blender station, and Tony called out to him, "Motor oil goes in cars, not in humans!"
"Shut up and cut the cake," Barton said and handed a knife over to him.
Steve just put a hand to his lower back, and he rubbed it a bit and kissed his cheek then went over to the island. "What's going on?"
"It is," Barton said airily.
"No, I think he did," Wilson said and folded his arms. "If I were you, man, I'd be insulted. He's your
be that interesting or that important that they have to drop everything to run out of here?"
Steve bristled a bit as Tony pushed him further away. "I can cook breakfast for us."
Pepper stared at him a moment, blinking, frowning, her hand now resting at her side. She nodded and said, "OK — and not that I'm saying it's something you should even do — but why…
" he said, his voice breathy and possessive, his mouth hot and wet as he suckled at the flesh just beneath the hinge of Tony's jaw. "Anthony Edward or Antonia Natasha. Always mine."
DUM-E whirred a little in what sounded like sadness, his claw lowering just the slightest, but Barnes stared at him a little thoughtfully and said, "Wait, you actually like it, don't you?"
or something."
"—and your history of palladium poisoning, it might put too much of a strain on your body. That said, there's no real…non-intrusive way  of—"
She never really had been his after all, had she? Fuck Bruce. Fuck Bruce for ever —
The scene from the movie flashing through his mind — yeah, he knew now why he'd wanted to crack the remote — he flexed his hands a little, frustration thrumming through his body, and instead of going back upstairs to spend time with his family — his aging family — he wrapped his hands back up and took out his— his— he didn't even know what the word was for it, but he took it out on one of the heavy bags, not stopping until he'd punched it off the mount, sand pouring from the hole he'd torn in it.
"Jeez, shit, sorry!" he said, stumbling and trying to catch himself against the person he'd stumbled into.
That seemed to give Steve pause, his head tilted and his mouth dropped open the faintest bit as those words truly sunk into his brain.
But Darcy was not deterred, and she patted his arm and said, "I'm sorry, honey. Part-timers don't get to make that decision."
Well, it was better than nothing, he supposed.
"Yeah?" Steve said and turned back from where he stood at the bottom of the staircase.
"On certain wasteful things, yes, of course," Welch replied airily. "I think we can all agree that superpowered freaks should be kept under lock and key. Though—" He looked Tony over. "I know some people that would be very interested to get their hands on
"Nat?"
"What?" Steve asked and glanced up at him.
Steve just rubbed his belly some more then said, "You know, they said it's a good idea to talk to him."
Tony was the one to break the kiss — Steve usually would keep on kissing Tony as long as Tony would let him — but he pecked a few kisses against Steve's mouth in parting and Steve leaned in and nuzzled his face into Tony's neck.
side—"
"That may be, but I didn't think I was what he needed."
The rest of the drive over to Brooklyn was punctuated by light, carefree banter and memories of earlier and less harried days. Tony was even able to forget, for just a moment, his reality and lose himself in bickering with Pepper just like they used to do, the occasional frank utterance from Happy filling in the gaps.
Tony stared at him, blinking, feeling like he'd actually gone and blown a fuse in his head. Here was Steve — beautiful, beat-up,
He never did get his answer about the suit. Olivia got her soda after that, and for as wound up and talkative as she was, she did seem to tire easily, and though he had projects to work on, and he was pretty sure he and Rhodey had plans to hit up the bar that night and catch up on the craziness of their lives the past couple months, he ended up on the couch with a four-year-old snuggled up next to him as they watched some horrible kids' show on one of those stations he didn't even know existed because they only played stuff for kids. She didn't seem impressed with his insistence that the Avengers show that she seemed to be such a big fan of was not available for her to watch on Netflix, her jaw clenched, lips pursed, eyes narrowed, and brow drawn together, forming a sharp crease in the middle as she refuted Tony's insistence that it wasn't there for them to select.
. I know that. I just… I figure why not enjoy the hell out of it for now? Not like I have a fucking
Honestly, Steve didn't know why not, but he said, "Because… We must have…known each other for longer than that. Right? I mean, we're both old enough to have known each other twenty years — maybe more than that."
"Why not?"
Steve blew out a breath. "Jesus."
should have been dead, too.
each other."
"Lab," he replied, and Steve sighed at him.
So, channeling what he'd seen Jarvis do time and again in his younger days, he mixed up the batter as best he remembered it, dipped the bread, and set it to cook on the flat griddle pan he'd found in a cabinet somewhere. Funny how well-stocked and organized a former SHIELD safe house could be (so
"The hell I can't! Watch me! You coming or what?"
Tony stopped in his tracks and turned to look right at the reporter, meeting her gaze from behind his rose-tinted glasses. He pulled off his sunglasses, arched an eyebrow, and looked dead straight at her as he said, "So what if I was?"
"You're not a bridezilla," Hill replied.
"Rhodey could be Secretary of State. Natasha could head up the CIA. I think Hill would have to settle for vice. Pep would settle for no less than Commander-in-Chief."
"Yeah, sure you did," Steve said and cuddled Tony in his arms. "Not fooling anyone, honey, least of all me."
Jesus, what if there really was an actual, physical manifestation of 'Mother Nature' — maybe even one that
"Well, I guess it's a good thing that you listened to him."
"Just make it so I can age, huh?"
But Barnes, to his credit, didn't run — just stood there and stared right back, his gaze now focused on Steve instead of Tony. Perhaps feeling emboldened, Steve took one cautious step toward his old friend. When Barnes still didn't turn to run, Steve took another step, and Barnes began to return the favor, taking cautious steps towards Steve as well, his gaze darting around like a nervous and easily-spooked animal on the lookout for any kind of threat.
Steve raised an eyebrow.
He didn't quite know what Tony meant by that, but he knew even if he asked, Tony would be cagey about it, so he just gave Tony's hand a tight squeeze and said, "God, this is all so—"
"I did," Steve said with an exhale of breath, "because I thought taking care of a boy would be, I don't know,
"Well," she said and blinked, face contorted into slight confusion, "because. I've not made the acquaintance of many of your kind in my time, which is such a shame. You're such fascinating creatures, and you bond the same as those of the other realms. You just aren't as aware of it. And you—" She put her arms out in a broad and opening gesture as though to encompass both Steve and Tony. "Well, you've got the strongest bond I've ever come across — perhaps in the whole galaxy."
Steve turned to him. "Actually, that first one, I think I understood that reference."
Tony reached up and rubbed a hand over his face. "This isn't happening. This can't be happening." He dropped his hand back down to the bed and glared at each face hovering above him. "I think we can all agree, upon pain of death,
"Nope. Always this color. Er, without the grays. I mean, she's definitely your daughter, too, I just don't know how I, uh…"
a metric ton!"
"Thinks you're annoyed with him, thinks you don't really want to talk with him, thinks you wish he'd just go away—"
Tony nodded at the small assortment of samples. "That."
Another 'rip' sounded from the floor, and Steve crouched down and pulled the little girl's hand away from a box that practically towered over her. "Hey, there, sweetheart. You OK?" He set concerned eyes on her and ran a hand over her head to check for any lumps or bruises. "They treating you OK here? This is a terrible thing to…" He thinned his lips and shook his head. No sense in being too drastic about the thing just yet. He needed to formulate an escape plan of some kind, and if that was real snow outside, he really didn't want to run out there in his skivvies.
"I tried," Tony said with a shrug and dropped the sandwich back down onto the plate. "Did she actually get anything opened yet, or has she just been ripping the ribbons to shreds?"
Barnes grimaced and scratched the back of his neck with the hand that wasn't holding the gun. "Uh…there's other… I'm not the only Winter Soldier."
Tony blinked at him. "Is this you getting me back for earlier with that stupid 'How to talk to your baby bump' bullshit?"
can be sustained. It was a ruse. They didn't have his baby. His baby was a she. If nothing else, the little pink sleeper with the cute little flowers she was dressed in (like many baby-related things that seemed to keep appearing, Natasha had pulled it out of thin air) was a dead giveaway.
"Steve, it's OK. You're a horny, dirty old man. I've come to accept it."
, Tony. What's really going on with
A nice thought that never panned out. The sole heir to Stark Industries and the young orphan that was working to pay off his mother's debts might have looked like a good match on paper — young and attractive with similar interests and an identical drive to bring out the best in each other — but real life never went that smoothly. Tony's world was one that Steve would never be welcome in, and while Tony was more than welcome in Steve's, he could never truly leave his world behind. While Howard was still alive and still running the company, sure. Tony could fuck off to do what he wanted — build, create, enjoy life with the first real friends he'd ever actually made.
Someday, he was going to take away their access to the penthouse. It would just be him and Steve allowed up here, and they could walk around naked all day every day and have sex on every single surface available. It would be awesome.
It had never, in all the years since that fateful night, occurred to him that Tony had nodded and gone along with the breakup simply because it was what Steve wanted. He was certain Tony wanted it as much as he had. He wasn't sure that, if he'd known the truth at the time, he wouldn't have done the same. Maybe he would have spent more of his time trying to explain his position to Tony, trying to make him understand that it was for the best and he was only doing it because while this might not have been what Tony
," Steve said, and Tony looked over at him and blinked.
But Bruce just smiled at him and said, "Physically, you have all the attributes of a human female, and in that case, you are not the first human female to go through this. That doesn't mean you can't be scared or nervous. I guarantee you anyone going through this says they're not, they're lying through their teeth."
"Because you turn fifty shades of red when we talk about you like this," Natasha said, humor lacing her voice, "and it's funny to see how many different colors we can get you to turn each time."
Not that he would tell Esmeralda this. The hell she could ever know just what exactly she'd done to him.
fault of their own, and the only thing he knew for certain was that his father was an alcoholic. And an asshole, but that probably didn't belong on a medical form.
"Mmm…very," he said, his lips brushing against Steve's neck. "It's even encouraged."
There were sirens in the distance and the sounds of creaking steel not too far away and the usual chatter of fight communication chirping in his ear, but for that moment, all Steve saw — all Steve heard — was Tony, lying in front of him, looking like he was about two seconds away from a full-blown panic attack.
"If you rat me out, I'll never speak to either one of you again."
" and dropped his fork against the plate in protest. Barnes smiled at Steve and said a sincere, "Thanks," to him before the look turned smug as he turned to Wilson and gave a very proud and taunting shrug of his shoulders to him.
vague about what he was trying to ask.
"Oh, no, this is good. This works. So, does Mother Wilson know about your sudden career turn as a superhero? You were, what, a counselor before that, right?" He tsked and shook his head. "I don't know. I have to say, if it were me, I'd be mighty disappointed if my son came to me and said, 'Mom—' well, I guess in my case,
sworn enemy. Hell, he even hung around with Thor, whom he spent countless hours asking about his alien-ness from the perspective of someone that was convinced he was just some foreign national pulling the leg of a bunch of gullible Americans.
"Lovin' Spoonful. 1965. All right, that one's old even for me. Look, I don't— I don't think you can really compare
He snorted a laugh. "You're kidding, right?"
"Don't mention it, babe." He leaned down and pressed a kiss to the crown of Steve's head. "You know, I wish Jarvis — the real Jarvis — could have met you."
So, even though he knew they'd end up with a few oddballs, he went with just the usual crew and then went about organizing the bash, demanding it be like a Fourth of July Picnic but awesomer and with more razzmatazz. Barton, for some dumb fuck reason, said he had 'other plans.' Bruce asked if he was moonlighting for the Justice League (what was it with people mentioning the Justice League so much?), which confused Thor, who thought there really was such a league and wondered if it was in the Avengers' best interest to aid their brothers in arms, but Barton said no, he just had somewhere else to be that day.
"About me dying? Yeah. About this being a gift? Yeah, not as much."
Because he was Steve's, and Steve was his. They were together. They were one. Nothing and no one was going to take that away from them. No one was going to force him to do anything he didn't want. He was Steve's. This was Steve's. This belonged to Steve, and Steve belonged to him.

things. Those are things you have done to get me off, and, might I add, you have done them all
"Hey, I don't mean it as a bad thing," Tony said, seeming to know that his words hadn't exactly brought comfort to Steve. "I just mean it as a... You weren't...bothered...by that sort of mundane stuff. But — hey — I only knew the myth, not the man himself. The 'myth' was fun when I was a kid. The 'man's a lot more fun now that I'm an adult."
full breakfast platters?"
"Yeah, your mother. Who's your mother?"
"And, honey, you know I love you, but you don't look like you're thirty-seven."
Steve stormed off the elevator and into the Tower’s basement garage, the sounds of that God awful racket people insisted was called ‘music’ thumping mildly in the vast expanse of the enclave.
like he was having a hard time of it. Granted, he couldn't blame the guy if he were. That would be a hell of a thing to wake up to for anyone. But it didn't
Tony nodded and followed Bruce through the door, Steve joining them a moment later, and just as the doctor began to lead them down another hallway, Tony said, "Uh, you mind if I use the bathroom first? Bruce made me drink a lot of water and, not to be too blunt, but I've got to piss like a racehorse."
Steve smiled a little and met his gaze. "In 1944, I would have said you were being paranoid and reading too much into things. In 2014? I think you're onto something."
"Uh huh," he murmured and relaxed fully into the bed, content with the knowledge that his baby was safe while Steve's scent in the duvet made him feel like he was safe, too. The lights went down, JARVIS seeming to deem that he was deep enough into his relaxed state that he was close to falling asleep, and DUM-E rolled over into what he knew to be his charging station, and the last thing he heard before sleep fully overtook him was Bruce saying, "I guess that's my cue to leave."
Tony dozed for all of ten minutes before he realized Steve had left the room, and his eyes shot open as sorrow and dread flooded his veins. The lights were off both in the bedroom and the bathroom, and Steve was nowhere in the vicinity. Which wasn't really surprising given that he was completely disgusted by Tony. By something he'd done to Tony, but that was beside the point. Tony was a freak, and there was no easy way out of this latest predicament he'd gotten himself into.
"Yeah? And what's that?"
Tony huffed a bit and folded his arms, again, making sure to adjust his arms properly not to… bother himself. God, how did women deal with this?
Steve laughed and rubbed his arms some more, but Tony saw a little element of doubt still clouding those clear blue-green eyes of his. "OK," he said, soft, gentle. "OK, we can do that."
"I didn't want to say it in front of those clerks," he said by way of explanation.
He pointed to the living room with the spatula, and Steve laughed and said, "No, I'm serious. That's some precise and detailed work! I commend you for it, Iron Man."
had been it. This had been the defining moment in time, where you'd come to a fork in the road and had had to make a choice, and that choice — that one choice — had led you down this path to where you were today.
Tony just made a 'hmm' sound and pushed closer to Steve, eyes shut tight. Steve adjusted his arms, and Barton sighed and groaned and said, "We lost them, didn't we?"
Steve ducked his head some like he was embarrassed. "I'm sorry," he murmured. "I know we haven't really been talking about anything you could relate to."
"I know, I— It's hard to explain." He then shrugged a little, smiled a bit, and said, "I like you with a cock, and I like you with a clit."
"No," Steve said with a slight shake of his head, "I said I'd take full responsibility if it
"I told you. I can offer your bonded immortality to match yours, or I can offer you mortality to match his."
here—" he jerked a thumb at Barton, "—deserves the title of 'superhero,' so I'm not sure, much as I adore him, I would use him to bolster my claim that people actually ask for War Machine stories."
"Oh, so we're back to 'Cap' now, are we?"
She rolled her eyes, obviously annoyed by what she probably thought was a stupid question. "My sister."
Tony Stark?"
"No— Wait! Stop!" he cried and gripped the back of the couch as another one of those pains overtook him.
"Sure, babe," Tony said and patted his arm, suddenly finding that his appetite had come back.
"No, but a slip of paper on the fridge meant for the assholes that eat us out of house and home is good enough for me. Besides, Barton thinks it's a girl? It's a boy."
He sniffled and blinked away the newest batch of tears that had formed.
"Lucky Strike means fine tobacco," Steve replied. "Call for Phillip Morris. No, they didn't have that stuff back in my day."
"Did she suffer? Long, I mean?"
" He scoffed. "Jesus, did he even
"What offer?"
, but
"I told you. I got turned into a woman a little while ago—"
And at that, he leaned over to Steve's plate and began to eat his dessert as well, Steve sitting back and allowing him because he was a good husband like that.
. Just more…hopeful, I guess."
while I was told to envision my cervix opening like a flower."
"Here," Tony said, startling him, and Steve turned to see Tony holding two champagne flutes filled with a dark-colored beverage. But instead of taking the one that was proffered to him, Steve swallowed and took the bold initiative to do something he had, up to that point, not been able to do.
He shrugged, sheepish and abashed, and Tony saw slight embarrassment lining his blue irises. "Well, I was in showbiz. And I
"J," he said and grimaced as he took the first step down. He waited a moment for the pain to lessen some then took the next step down, finding, like on the way up, it was a lot easier to take the steps one at a time. At least this time he could use both hands to grip the railing, holding onto it like a lifeline and hoping he wouldn't squeeze it so hard he would crack it like he'd cracked the TV remote. Which he still didn't understand. He'd never been able to do something like
"You do?"
"No," he said and exhaled a breath. "No, ah...I forget how she explained it. Something about how so many boys and girls wanted train sets that year that Santa's helpers couldn't keep up but that maybe next year he would bring me one."
, not the coffee shop," she said and hit the button for her floor.
like that—"
Steve directed some of his annoyance in Barton's direction, and Tony used the hand he had over Steve's mouth to turn his head back in his direction.
Steve raked his gaze over Tony from head to toe. "You mean it? You really—?"
," Steve practically hissed at him, and Tony winced back a little at his rather harsh tone. Steve seemed to understand that he'd gone a little overboard, and he said, "Sorry, I just— I'm not letting Hydra or anyone else get you. They want you, they gotta go through me, and I'm a stubborn son-of-a-bitch. I don't like people taking what's mine any more than you do, and you're mine. I don't care if you don't think you are. You're mine to protect and defend and love and honor and cherish, and that's that. Hydra or any of them can take what's mine over my dead body, and based on the fact that there were at least half-a-dozen failed programs in the last seventy years designed to replicate the super soldier program, I have a feeling for their aims, they'd very much want me alive."
"Yeah."
"I missed my child being born. I think we both got the short end of the stick," Steve replied.
He turned to Happy again, and he leaned forward and lightly punched him in the shoulder and said, "Congratulations, Hap, my man. She's a great gal, isn't she?"
His first Christmas Eve with his own family.
"I don't know," Pepper said, obviously annoyed by his wavy train of thought. "Four."
Bucky just hedged a little and said, "Yeah, I'm pretty sure Thor's got something like four stomachs. I mean, I thought Steve could pack that shit away — you know, after they juiced him up — and then I met Thor."
"You're staring again."
"Why did you look at
"What are we calling me now?" Tony asked as Steve wiped Olivia's mouth off and steeled himself for one more go with the bottle.
to rescue his friend the
Natasha just gave him a flat 'you're an idiot' look and took a sip of her drink, and Steve said, "It's not that." When the eyes of the table were on him, he added, "It's just…easier…I think to have a boy— to raise a son."
"Traitor," he muttered under his breath before he turned back to Steve. "Come to apologize?"
for a woman."
Olivia squealed with delight and hopped off the chair, bounding into the living room ahead of him, and Rhodey reached out and snatched a firm hold of Tony's arm, pulling him back, concern etched over his face.
"So…you're
"Honey," Natasha said, a low, warning note in her voice, "what are you doing?"
Thor shrugged but still nodded his agreement. "That is, as I believe you say, the long and short of it. Our Man of Iron must do this or face the most dire of consequences."
Steve swallowed and finally let his gaze drift up to the lighted eye-slits. "I want you."
Tony sighed and glanced over to the table at the other side of the lab.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him. "Why
"Know about what?"
I make fun of you through
"Don't even start," Tony said and reached out to slap a hand over Steve's mouth. "Look, I already told you about my…
He made a face. "Yeah, uh, pretty sure it is."
"I mean, she's clearly Steve's," Tony said as the baby nursed from him. "I've never once seen either one of them put up a fight over eating."
let anything happen to him while I'm gone.
Tony waved off his concern. "Trust me. She's too young to know what that is."
"Jesus," Barton muttered and pushed his chair away from the table. He left the room, and the others looked at each other in slight confusion for the few moments it took Barton to return, a small paperback book in his hands.
"Aw, man!" she said and sat back, pouting and folding her arms. "I want th' ones like Daddy's shield."
"No, it's not that," Steve said, frown covering his face.
"I was just trying to help," Steve muttered, put out.
"All right
He shook his head. "Nothing." He made a noticeable glance in a direction and said, "Oh! There they are." He glanced back and added, "Maybe knock off the derogatory dude-bro terminology and you might be able to get yourself a girl that doesn't have one of those little inflation nozzles somewhere on her."
"No, still don't. Still think this was a
Natasha shook her head, never faltering in her light and soothing strokes down the sides of his face. "That's not what I'm saying at all. But Steve needs to feel useful. He needs to feel like he has a purpose, like he's doing something. And there's really nothing for him to do until you start pushing. That could be five minutes from now, or it could be five days from now."
"Not sure yet," Clint said and swiped to another screen. "Haven't been able to figure it out."
thing to wish on any— Wait, in what way are you talking?"
"Wait," Tony said, "you're going to do it? You're going to give us a marriage license?"
"Fuck," he muttered, "how long did I sleep for?"
She nodded at him like he'd proven her point. "But you're comfortable enough with each other
"Rings and flowers and the whole shebang?" Wilson asked.
"Don't worry about it— What does she have in her mouth?"
Including Steve, who stood in front of the lectern and had been coerced into donning his old dress uniform — the double-breasted officer's tunic from the war with the ribbons and the collar pins and the brass buttons down the front and over each hip and breast pocket. They'd even gotten him to put his cap on and shine his shoes, and Tony thought that, if not for the relatively modern haircut, he was seeing Steve —
Steve sat back some, and the eyebrow arched higher if that was even possible.
"I'm so sorry."
"How do you even walk in these things?" he muttered over the booming sound of the music leaking out of the club's walls.
"Yeah, but Daddy says it's only for special 'casions."
"No— I mean maybe you are, but not about that. You're very… You must have had a good example to follow."
"'Yes,' what? I don't think that was a 'yes' or 'no' question. I don't think it was even a question."
" under his breath, his shoulders slumping just the slightest in what looked like the early stages of defeat.
He pulled away and went back to his plate of French toast, and Tony smiled a little and decided to accept the compliment for what was probably the first time since Steve had started this whole insistence on him being 'amazing' for doing something that, really, had been going on since the dawn of time.
Tony winced. "My god, and you're still alive," he murmured more to himself than to Steve. "Yeah, well, not tonight. Tonight, I'm driving you home."
"Are you implying we can't be
"Ready?" he asked, and Steve shrugged.
"I don't know," he said and speared at a slice of tomato. "I kind of enjoyed what we did last night."
"Yes, it's OK," he said, "It's very OK," he said, his vision blurring a little, and Steve chuckled and reached up to brush his thumbs just under Tony's eyes.
"Seriously?"
Pepper nodded her understanding, and Tony said, "I'm sorry, what was that, cinnamon bun?"
Steve's brows drew together, and before he knew it, he was pulled against Steve's broad chest, and Steve was holding him and rubbing his back and shushing him and telling him it was going to be OK.
"Your point?"
Tony tried to swallow it all, but Steve always seemed to have ridiculous amount of come, and he felt come and saliva leak out of his mouth and dribble down his chin even as he tried to swallow. Steve thrust a few more times then slid his cock out of Tony's mouth, spit and come gathering on his lips and dripping down his chin.
Steve just leveled him with the Stare of Disappointment.
Tony rolled his eyes, but Bruce made a face and said, "Uh, he's a little cranky."
"I'm the only one that matters. Right, babe?"
fault for not noticing Tony Stark and Natasha— What were you calling yourself?"
would go back and wring Howard's neck? Just more proof this was definitely an alternate universe he was dealing with here.
Oh, Jesus. This was it, wasn't it? This was the whole reason for Steve's insistence that they call everything that they did — from the soft, tender movements to the light Dom/sub stuff they dabbled in — 'making love.'
He sighed and moved over to the door, and he switched off the lights and made to go back to setting up his easel, but as he picked up the canvas, his fingers flexed around the framed cloth, and he suddenly found himself desperate to head back upstairs, something inside him screaming at him to go and see his family. Oh, it wasn't anything portending danger, he thought as he set the canvas back down. Just...some desperate need to see Tony — to put his hands on Tony and feel him in his arms and assure himself that Tony was, well, real and here.
"Does she get mad at your papa a lot?"
To be honest, Tony didn't know how average people with regular nine-to-fives did it.
Tony bent his arm a little so he could reach up and stroke the hairs at the back of Steve's head. "Kinda, yeah. You're still seeing the guy that he was, not the guy that he is. That guy died a long time ago, babe, sort of like how one Steve Rogers died when he went into the ice and when he came out, another one took his place."
Tony pulled away from Steve to check on the progress Barnes had made. "Eh, a little more. Try to get them a little brown and crispy."
a vegetarian (or was at least claiming so today), so he and Steve made their way over to the Lower Level of Grand Central and settled in for a classic American dinner of burgers and fries. Steve loved this sort of fare. He was good about the fancy stuff — he'd had a crash-course of it back during the war — but Steve was a working-class Brooklyn boy at heart, and Steve loved nothing more than to stuff his face with a good burger and some fries and wash it down with a malted milkshake.
Steve's face blanched, and it looked like the wind had completely gone out of his sails, his eyes gone wide and his mouth dropped open in surprise.
letting them call anything into question about that baby."
"I'll see what I can do."
, don't make me—"
"Hmm?"
"It's a possibility."
"I heard," Steve said with a curt nod.
Tony rolled his eyes and shook his head. Yeah, it was totally Steve's fault Hydra had attacked the power grid. Not that it was an easy target for anyone looking to cause chaos and destruction. No, it was definitely a personal attack against Steve.
"Yeah?" he asked, hands on his hips as he leaned over her. "Well, tough shit. The Iron Man suit has more safeguards and protections built into it than all of your armors put together. I'm safer in the suit than out of it. That witch may have taken away whatever choices I can make over my own goddamned body, but she is not taking Iron Man away from me."
"I know that's supposed to be an insult, but I don't speak 'geriatric.'"
"Cuppa days. Papa says he'll be gone for a few weeks." She frowned up at Bruce and said, "Unca Bruce, how long is a few weeks?"
Pepper just pulled him into the hallway, and Tony called out, "Steve! She's kidnapping me, Steve! She's making me do work!"
"So," Tony said and turned to him, folding his arms and hitching his hip against the back of the couch he claimed he wasn't able to see. "What are we doing here?"
"You're his anchor to the present," she added before he could say anything. She shrugged and continued, "If anything happens to you…"
"What dads?"
And he'd scoffed because what else could he do? "
When they finally broke apart, Steve's lips were red and wet, and his eyes were just a smidge glazed, and he watched as Steve licked his lips and swallowed, Steve's eyes skirting all over his face as he said, "So, um, is it OK?"
Steve stared at her a moment, narrowing his eyes. "What does that even mean?"
"Papa, where's Iron Cap?"
"I said
"It's a boy, Steve. Little James Steven—"
Bucky scoffed. "Nobody ever wants to go to Philly."
Bruce had a look on his face like he was equal parts amused and disappointed, and he shook his head a little and said, "That's…OK. It's not your fault."
Tony scoffed. "That just means they ran into him somewhere. It doesn't mean he's dead. It doesn't mean they found him crushed under a building. It just means they found him. Did they actually
"Olivia," Tony said without thinking. He tilted his head in a little bit of confusion as the Cap startled and stared at Tony either like he'd seen a ghost or like he was trying to make sure he'd heard what he thought he'd heard. But then he blinked and shook his head, almost as though he was trying to clear his thoughts of something.
She pointed more toward a clearing in the middle of the room. "That would be better. I don't need you falling back and cracking your head on the table. Your bonded will be absolutely unbearable to deal with if that were ever to happen."
She raised her eyebrow again.
it is!" Tony said and did his best to stomp over, but a big, overdone belly and swollen ankles probably made the sight more humorous than intimidating.
Steve paused mid-bite and stared at Tony a moment before he said, "I honestly can't tell if you're kidding or not."
. He rolled his eyes at all three of them and shook his head at their misguided notions.
"—and a grumpy, old man that'll bite my head off for saying anything less than reverential about the moody pregnant broad and probably threaten to throw me off the team for it."
know."
The men stopped and turned back to her, and knowing they were verging on making a bargain with Lucifer himself, the first man to speak that night said, "And that would be?"
She nodded and produced another bottle of water from…somewhere. Had she been holding it the whole time?
"They make
The King was still without issue.
Steve just gave him a flat, sour look in return, like he was humoring Tony but wasn't happy about the situation overall.
Tony shrugged his agreement and watched as Olivia polished off the rest of her bottle. Steve set the bottle on the table and then made to rest her on his shoulder to burp her, but Tony held out his hands and said, "Let me do that. You haven't had a chance to eat anything yet, and it's getting cold."
"Until death."
"No!"
"But I
"Insulting?" Tony said with a bit of a laugh to his voice.
God almighty, and here he was. Technically, honestly, on his way to being a mother himself. God, what would his mother have said to that? Probably would have shook her head in sadness and disappointment. Oh, not that he'd gotten turned into a woman and knocked up—
Tony just stared at him a moment, his lips pursed like he was fighting between arguing the point and admitting Steve was right.
"Hmm…" Tony murmured, considering this as he glanced over a contract Pepper had sent over prior to the call. "They believe the attempted suicide story?"
"You don't have an arc reactor anymore," Steve pointed out oh-so-helpfully.
Hence why Steve was so fucking precious with that money he'd gotten from the government for leaving him in a seventy-year ice bath. And even that he struggled with because he still didn't think he'd
"Uh," Tony said and scratched his arm, frowning as he seemed to consider this. "Huh. I, ah, honestly, I never really thought about it. I've just...always used those names with Rhodey. I didn't know you would want me to use them with you."
Hands to his hips, he stared at the enormous pile of presents piled beneath the large festive evergreen set up in the living area by the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Midtown.
Tony just hummed, his mouth a flat line, as he stared down at Steve. "I think you're holding out on me, but I know if you are, you'll confess your sins eventually, so I'm not going to press you on it. Anyway, I thought you were dead, you didn't even know you were supposed to be dead, being that I was
that he wanted to find out for sure, but just saying this fetus did, you know,
"No, but I'm pretty sure we've reached a level of intimacy that only Rhodey or Pep or Steve have ever achieved."
He sighed and stood up, and he surveyed the cake like he might a battlefield, looking for some sort of tactical advantage, and he poised the knife to cut into the top layer just as Natasha said, "Nope, not that one! You have to save that one."
She arched a thin eyebrow. "You believe this gift to be a burden?"
"So, look, if you've got problems with this sort of thing, maybe you should come back in, like, twenty or thirty minutes—"
"Honestly, I don't know," he said, which wasn't
He shrugged and considered what was in his glass. "This."
to keep this baby?" the same woman asked, disgust written over her face. "You didn't have a choice in it?"
Tony hummed a little and said, "That's sweet. Well, if you want to know—" he put a hand to his belly, "—that bullshit you just pulled with the tickling woke up the little monster, so now I've got that to deal with. I've kind of been a little bloated lately? Which is probably because I'm kind of constipated. And my joints ache like a
"No. Happy has security work to deal with tonight."
Barton scoffed. "
it was Steve's. In the next couple hours, that's all anyone's going to be talking about. Captain America's bastard child — which is bullshit 'cause we're totally married, and really? Has no one thought to check the county clerk's office for that sort of thing? It's public record."
Tony sat back and put a hand over Steve's mouth. "Stop. Don't even go there. Don't even think about it. It's not going to happen. That was a once-in-a-lifetime freak event that will never, ever be repeated. Besides, you got him back now, and he's… He's going to be OK. He might not be exactly the same Bucky that you remember from before the war, but he's going to be OK. It's going to take some time, though, and babe? I know you love him, and I know you want what's best for him, and I know you just want him to go back to being your buddy from the block, but he's… He's changed, and as I understand it, you've changed as well. So,
"Wait, you
He set Olivia in the bassinette, and Natasha murmured something in Russian then said, "You're not alone, Tony. You're never going to be alone. Maybe you don't have Steve anymore, but you've got the rest of your family to look out for you."
Tony nodded in the direction of the gallery owner. "This Ella-chick. That
," Steve said and shot a pointed look at him, and Tony stared right back at him.
," while Barnes, still wearing that stupid party hat, looked at him and said, "How old are you, anyway?"
Tony shrugged some and reached up to run gentle fingers through Steve's hair. It was shorter, softer. He must have had it cut since the last time he saw him. "Subtle differences. Steve Rogers can say sarcastic shit that Captain America could never get away with. Steve Rogers is allowed to have doubts. I don't think the Cap is."
something going on between them — which he totally thought there was — he had to say they were perfect for each other. If there wasn't, well, they were really missing out on something, but he was pretty sure there was.
but everything he'd always wanted but assured himself he could never have. Aside from the tingle of electricity that had gone through him when Tony's lips had touched his, he'd been hit with the overwhelming sense of familiarity and belonging. He didn't know how whoever had set this up had managed it, but they'd dug into the deepest, darkest parts of Steve's soul and had given him everything he'd ever wanted but told himself he could never have.
Steve exhaled a heavy breath as Tony dropped the shoes on the floor and perched on the couch cushion beside him. "What happened?" he asked like he already knew but wanted to hear the story from Tony himself, and Tony made a little face of disbelief at him.
Steve did nothing but rub his back.
"I don't have to sit here and take this abuse!"
Olivia just nestled closer to him, getting comfortable as she snuggled against his torso. "I think you're the best, Papa."
Tony shrugged. "Problem solved. Just give me one of those epidural things."
"Oh, so you're saying I'm not original?" Tony said, but there was no malice to the tone. It was light, teasing, and clearly Tony remembered that moment just as well as Steve did.
She said those last few words like they were somehow beneath her — like it was the phrasing of some poor, uneducated slob that couldn't possibly know better.
"Just a hunch," he said with a shrug. "So, what happened after that?"
Steve almost seemed bashful as he said, "I'd…kind of like it if you did."
He went over to where he'd dropped his overnight bag at the bottom of the staircase.
He and Steve exchanged glances, Steve's look sad but supportive, before Tony turned back to them and said, "Well, seeing as the nutcase that did this to me is dead, and seeing as how — according to Thor — she's the only one that can turn me back." He exhaled a heavy and somewhat resigned breath. "Yeah, I guess I am."
"They didn't try to get you to talk to anyone? Like a psychologist or something?" Tony asked as he continued eating. Hey, he was hungry, and the food was good.
What are you two talking about?"
"I loved Captain America when I was a kid, even when I knew he was this ideal I could never live up to—"
Huh? Is that what you want, Steven?"
He just swallowed and tried to process everything he'd heard himself say. "That… They didn't arrest me for that? Or drum me out of the service?"
Steve heaved out a breath as he stood there, arms folded with hands tucked into his armpits. "At the moment, there's not much we can do about it. Thor is very much of the opinion that Esmeralda means exactly what she says about the fetus's life being tied up with Tony's. Tony lets it grow and develop, he'll be OK. He tries to terminate it in any way, he'll kill himself, and that's not happening."
Tony shrugged a little. "Well, when I bother to think about it in terms like that, yeah. Sure."
, not a princess."
" Tony said and showed the note to Steve, who just shrugged like he didn't have a decent explanation for it, either.
"Nah, I'll just have dry toast. The thought of that doesn't seem to send my stomach into somersaults."
"That's not what I said at all—"
The first man looked at the vial in the hands of the second man and the sachet in the hands of the third. "But what will this
"Yeah."
"Hmm?" Steve asked, the picture of faux innocence. He pulled Tony into his arms, taking a gentle hold of his hand as he put his other hand where Tony's waist had once been. "Oh, nothing. Just asked a question."
"But what I don't get— What's the engraving?"
"Yeah. Why?"
Again, it mattered not to the Council that King Anthony would rather share his bed with his closest of advisors. It did, of course, but not in the 'sins of the flesh' way. It mattered in that the Council was utterly convinced that the High Chancellor, a former knight of the King's army called 'Steven,' was merely trying to secure what King Howard had once stupidly promised him as his young ward and apprentice.
"I notice you didn't say 'no.'"
"This is rabbit food, Steve. Do I look like a rabbit to you?"
"I am not the only person under eighty with a landline," he told Sam then directed to Bucky, "Sign me in, would you?"
" she asked. "
"You have all seen
He frowned and muttered to himself and glanced around as he tried to remember where he'd left the shoe polish, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "Honey, they look fine, and besides, with me hanging off your arm, they're
"Oh, so
He sniffled and swallowed. "I fucked up."
"Tony Stark-
"What are you doing up?"
"I made a mistake. I thought I was doing the right thing for both of us. I thought I was giving him what he wanted. We were from two different worlds. I never would have fit into his. I thought he deserved more than I could ever give him."
Steve just looked at him, daring Tony to deny the claim. Tony held his ground and stared right back, but goddamn it, that Stare of Disapproval was too much for even him to overcome.
Barnes hummed and said, "Cute. Don't know if she looks like an 'Olivia,' but cute."
"A boy," he said casually. "You?"
"No homo?" Tony finished for him.
"Yeah," he said with an exhale of breath and rubbed his free hand against the back of his neck, "it's kind of a long story. Just a..." He looked back at Tony and kept his gaze again as he added, "Something that happened to me a long time ago."
And yet, Steve could see, underneath it all, the stubborn, baby-faced
Much to his surprise, Tony found that maybe he wasn't done for the night after all.
Again, Steve just seemed perplexed and reiterated, "Tony, what in the world are you talking about?"
"A little while ago," he replied, unable to hide the slight strain in his voice or, now that Tony looked a little closer, the concern in his eyes. His heart sunk a little.
"Oh," Jim said and sat up a bit. "You trying to say he was brainwashed, too?"
"Papa?" Olivia said quietly, and Tony remembered then she'd asked him a question.
Oh, thank god. Steve was still having a harder time of it than he was. He still had control over the situation.
But that wasn't enough for Steve, and he went sad-eyed and said, "Tony, I'm sorry. You know I never meant to—"
"Sure," Bruce said, "but then you'd just outsource the running of it to Pepper."
She grumbled and folded her arms. "I want my toys."
"I don't want you to feed her — not yet."
"Yeah," she said after a moment, bashful and coy before she yawned and Tony could feel her begin to relax like she was starting to drift off. He rubbed her back and kissed her head again—
Steve cocked a challenging eyebrow at him. "Or I could have gotten you to change yours to 'Rogers.'"
"Hmm?"
, then I will totally call you 'babe' or 'Steve' or 'hey, you!' on the field and 'Captain' in the bedroom."
The collective groan was almost deafening.
was the one not quite making sense here. "Isn't this Olivia?"
She rolled her eyes. "Well, anyway. What I meant was—"
But Tony pursed his lips and shook his head. "Honey, I don't care who you are. I don't think even Captain America has carte blanche to look through other people's medical records."
Steve glowered as he stepped closer. "You told me to go."
"Mmm…let me think about it, yeah? For the moment, I'm going to say yeah, probably, but…I don't know. Let me think about it."
Bruce took a breath, and he opened and closed his mouth a few times before he said, "Tony, don't you think you're being a little hard on her?"
this, Steve."
"I am giving them what all those bonded desire. They seek to create life from their love. Earthen males cannot do that on their own. I mean, quite obviously there are exceptions, but to these two in particular, I've helped them around their pesky biology."
Tony bit his lips together to keep from snorting out a laugh. "Yeah," he said when the moment had passed. "That's what they're called."
," was all he could think to say to that.
Yeah, OK, when he put it that way… But still—
"Very well," she said, bored, and unfolded her arms to press her finger to her lips.
"Can I test them out?"
"But it
"Didn't you find that out the other day?" Hill asked him as she secured the veil to his upswept hairdo. Again,
"Shit!" he said and jumped up. "Don't move!" he said, putting his hands out as though to push Steve back into the chair he hadn't even attempted to vacate, and Steve watched as he went around the couch and made a mad dash out into the foyer and then up the stairs.
"The fuck there isn't. Chin up, boy. Starks don't cry."
"I won't tell anyone. I promise," Tony said, and Steve looked up at him, not even bothering to hide the tears.
"Nah, that would be my friend, Clint. The wolves that raised him forgot to slap decent manners on him."
"Me Tony."
Deep breaths. Deep breaths. In. Out. In. Out. He wasn't there. He wasn't trapped on the wrong side of a wormhole. He was in his penthouse, in his tower, in New York, in the year 2012. He was currently cuddling with an alternate universe daughter from the future, but other than that, there was nothing odd about the situation. He was fine. He was OK. He couldn't panic. Not here. Not now.
Because to be quite honest, he was really fucking tired that weekend, and Steve was just so fucking comfortable to relax against that he ended up dozing through most of it or just blatantly not paying attention because he had Steve there, and Steve was approaching the whole thing like he would a battle against Hydra, analyzing, critiquing, and looking for ways to improve upon what he merely thought were 'adequate' measures. He had no qualms against sharing his thoughts with the nurse — to the amusement of their classmates and the annoyance of the nurse — who finally, after Steve's tenth critique that first day, said, "Captain Rogers, do you think it would be better if
"Your daddy's on your t-shirt, too?"
"Eh," he said and thought about making a minor tweak to the size of the magnets but then decided against it at the last second. "From what I understand, it's going to get worse before it gets better— And where the hell is Brucie? He's supposed to give me a look-over or something."
Tony hummed a bit, and as the elevator 'dinged' to announce its arrival, he said, "Maybe we could fool around a
Take me down to the hilt, make me take all of you. Because I want it, and you know I want it. And I need it. Because you need to show me. You need me to beg. I'd have to come on your cock. I touch my own, I won't be able to come at all. You'll take it away from me. Come on your cock, or don't come at—
Other Tony shrugged. "Some people would call that 'kismet.'"
"What's in the box?" Natasha asked and nodded at the thin, faded box in his grasp.
. Not after
it would be a lot less
Steve swallowed, and he opened his eyes to look at Tony but couldn't find it in him to say anything to confirm or deny, and Tony nodded once like it explained everything for him.
"Actually," Tony said and put a hand on Steve's shoulder, "he
Other Tony pulled his hand away from his face and looked at her. "I really don't need to know—"
more. He would look much prettier if he
It was as he was exiting the restroom when some Long Island Lothario sidled up alongside him, drink in hand, hair a little too slicked, and wearing way too much cologne. He tweaked a smile and tried to step to the side of him, but the guy just stepped to the same side with a grin. Tony forced another smile then tried to step to the other side only to be blocked by the lecher yet again. Jesus Christ,
"Message from Sam," he murmured before Tony could ask. "Been another sighting."
"Mine, too."
Crappy clothes. T-shirt and yoga pants. He was allowed that, right? Allowed to dress down.
He grimaced at the slobber, but he wiped it off with his hand and then put it up to his ear and said, "Hello? Yes?" He held it out to her. "It's for you."
to my wedding. I mean a white dress like this. Isn't that… I mean, aren't you supposed to be…"
Bruce had intended to take her up to the common floor but for some reason, the words, "Tony's floor," came out of his mouth as soon as they got on the elevator, and JARVIS didn't even question his choice. The doors opened to the penthouse, still in the midst of being rebuilt after the trashing it had gotten during the Battle, and Olivia bounded off and ran into the living room, stopping only a moment to question it like the placement of things looked unfamiliar to her before she dashed off toward the kitchen. Bruce sighed and followed after her, and she was just climbing up onto one of the high chairs at the island when he got to the kitchen.
It was that time of year — the time of the annual Foundation gala.
He stepped away from the computer and paraded over to Steve, and Steve swallowed as he let his gaze rake over every single inch of Tony's supple and shapely body. "God, you're beautiful," he heard himself saying, and Tony tweaked a lopsided smile at him and tilted his head somewhat, standing what Steve was pretty sure his exact same height as when he...well, was a man.

that's why they left. And you know they're downstairs somewhere gossiping about this like the bunch of old biddies that they are."
"Do I get fourteen thousand dollars if I do?"
His melancholy wasn't helped by the fact that he was sore and bleeding — Bruce swore he wasn't actually hemorrhaging, but you could have fooled him with all the blood and other…weird stuff coming out of him — and tired and achy and that he spent half his waking hours being a drinking fountain for his child, even though, as he understood it, his milk hadn't even come in yet. He'd browsed the literature in the time he'd been stuck down in his lab and had discovered horror stories of nursing from other women, but so far, he hadn't experienced anything of the sort. Olivia — yes, he was keeping the name — latched on and fed without issue and sometimes just latched on for the hell of it, especially if there wasn't a pacifier within reach. Tony didn't know if that was a good thing or not, but it wasn't like he had anything else to do at the moment. The Avengers, last he'd been told, were wrapping up their battle with Hydra, even though no one had actually spoken to any of them since right after Steve had supposedly died. As far as he heard it, communications had gone down, and they were having a hell of a time getting them back up.
" Tony replied. "This is ridiculous and embarrassing."
He turned around, and Steve was caught just on the wrong side of the threshold, and he stopped, swallowed, and turned, unable to contort his face into anything other than the proverbial deer-in- the-headlights.
Steve frowned. "Tony, what are you getting at?"
"So, look, how 'bout we eat, OK? I know it's not… I know it won't fix everything. I know you still feel…" He tightened his arms some and rubbed his hands over Tony's back. "I do love you. I'm not good at saying it. I know that. But I do love you, and I'd do anything for you, and if it means letting go of Bucky—"
Tony dropped his fork, his appetite suddenly gone. "They think we're both assholes, don't they?"
For only a brief second did Tony feel any remorse that he'd given up the search for Captain America. Only a second because how the hell was he supposed to know he was still alive? The man had crashed a plane into an unknown location in 1945. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together would have figured the man had probably died on impact.
"About?"
— wasn't

Barton scoffed. "What's to rat-out? He knows what you're doing. He's humoring you. He's against it, but he's humoring you. And
He guessed a person would have to be soulless to shovel that shit on a daily basis.
Bruce just shook his head a little and pressed the needle into his skin. Tony made a slight face at the pinch, but again, he'd embedded fucking
"What? Bullshit! Half of your people dabble in that shit—"
"Wait, if the grid's down, how are we even getting this news?"
"Such as?" the clerk asked.
stew, to be perfectly honest, because he wasn't thinking about this. He wasn't thinking about some magical brat that suddenly appeared out of the blue, he wasn't thinking about the best thing that had ever happened to him leaving him high and dry, and he wasn't thinking about—
"Tony, you're allowed to rest. You're going to need it. You're—"
The first of, with hope, many in the years to come.
Seriously?
"I told you," Tony said without looking up, "if I need someone to burn the cookies for me, I'll call you."
over me, right? I have— I have reason to be pissed about that."
The man swung the little girl into his arms and turned to Steve. "You know, there's a part of me that wishes Wilson hadn't done that. If these two ever get separated, I won't know how not to take it as a bad sign."
"Why?" Sam asked.
Louise.
Tony stared up at him a moment then swallowed and turned his attention back to his very angry newborn. "Well, you're wrong," he murmured and caught one of her shaking fists in his grasp, feeling, for the first time, that maybe
Natasha glared daggers at Bruce, who shrank away some, then turned softer eyes back to Tony. "Tony, do you want him? I'll go get him. But you know he knows Hydra's out there planning something, and you know how he gets — especially about Hydra."
"Yeah, me too," Wilson said and followed Barton in retreat.
ring than that other one had, he thought as he rolled the ring back and forth between his thumb and index finger a few times, only then noticing how much the dexterity in his fingers had changed since that morning, and not for the better, but this had been the ring he'd worn prior to Esmeralda's little game, and, by rights, it was the ring he should wear once again. He went to slide it back onto his right hand when he realized he wasn't engaged any longer.
The lights flickered off while the computers and other electronics shut down, and Tony made his way over to Steve and said, "There's a Starbucks about five hundred feet from here, but I actually know this great little place in Brooklyn. Free trade, organic, independently-run and all that rigmarole." He put a hand to the small of Steve's back, firm and, if he didn't know better, just the slightest touch possessive.
"Closest thing I've been able to find is, uh—" he glanced at the tablet, "
"What?" Tony asked but let Steve take the glass from him. "I thought you wanted more?"
"I don't want her to go back," he murmured. Bruce clamped his mouth shut and looked at Tony like he'd expected as much to eventually come out of his mouth.
"OK," Steve said and rubbed a hand over his thigh. "OK. We can do that. Come on. Up on your knees."
Tony gave him a sharp look, and Steve laughed at the glare that stared back at him.
He shrugged. "There's nothing really to tell. You managed. Sometimes, you had bigger things to worry about." He motioned to Tony's plate. "Eat before it gets cold. I want to get on the road pretty soon."
"Hey, uh, you mind if I took a picture?"
he might possibly remember from that two-day horror show that, no, had definitely
But Natasha merely shrugged. "All sorts," she said rather simply — and cryptically, now that he thought about it.
"Tony can't have a baby," Steve said without fanfare. "Simple as that. He's not made for it."
"Yeah, all right. Fine. I mean, I guess I
Rhodey nodded and glanced to Bruce. "I'm going to take that as a 'no.'"
when it came to his sexual preferences, and bottoming required an insane amount of trust. It put one in an inherently vulnerable position, and Tony was not one for putting himself into vulnerable positions. Not intentionally, anyway.
He went quiet again, and Tony waited for him to pick up the thought, but Steve just concentrated on the road until, evidently, the music had gotten to be too much for him, and he glared at the radio display and said, "What the hell is this?"
"Then it shouldn't have been left out," Steve replied and paged through the chart some more.
bought them but because Tony
"You don't even know what I was going to—"
"Nope," Tony said with a curt shake of the head and turned onto his side. "'Night."
"I don't—" Steve tried to say, but Tony cut in and said, "Whatever," and began to rip the pastel- colored patterned paper off the box beside him. "Oh, right, yeah," he said as he shucked the torn paper this time to reveal a high chair. "Yeah, this is probably going to come in handy in a couple months."
But Bruce just smiled at him amusedly and said, "I don't know, Tony. Is there?"
for a woman which meant—
"Locked it with my phone," Tony explained like it was obvious then groaned as he hit a button on the phone in his hand and said, "Oh, come on!"
"You know I don't swing that way," Bucky said, "but your boy's looking fucking
"Is that the last batch?" Steve asked.
One thing Tony could honestly say was that he had never been a fan of the pump-and-grind kind of dance that was popular at these sorts of places. Sure, he'd done it, when he was strutting his stuff and flashing his feathers as a young, stupid kid. But he was in his forties now, and he was settled and had a fiancé that was older than the Charleston, and the most dancing he'd done as of late was slow dancing to ballads with a super soldier from the '40s. And to be honest, he liked that kind of dancing more. Nowadays, anyway. Maybe it was the intimacy of it or maybe it was because it was a hell of a lot classier or maybe it was just because it was Steve and he was wont to make all sorts of excuses when it came to Steve.
"OK," he replied and went over to his side of the bed and sat down. "JARVIS, put the lights down," he said, and without a word, darkness fell over the room.
"Tony," Rhodey said, gentle, not without fondness, "if you actually wanted it…I think you might have a chance to get it."
" Wilson asked, and Barnes put an arm around his shoulders.
Steve just gave him one of those half-amused, half-'you're an idiot' smirks, glancing up at him from beneath his eyelashes before he pushed himself to his feet and began to open the box.
"Get out of my kitchen."
He shook his head. "Nothing," he said and stood up. "Come on. Let's go."
Concern had slid into Steve's visage, softening the suspicion. "Tony, you're not a—"
"OK, but—"
Pepper just blinked at him, staring at him like she couldn't even fathom the words Tony was speaking, and Tony thought she'd blown a fuse until she said, "So, you got turned into a woman,
this baby, right? She didn't say anything about keeping it. I just— I mean, I guess I just assumed that we would…"
That was when he heard the voices — or maybe 'voice' was the better term. Willing himself to forget about his pain, if just for the moment, he took two difficult steps to the right and looked around the furthest support pillar over to where the fire exit was. He saw Barnes standing there, nervous, face scrunched in a mental sort of anguish, finger on the trigger but somehow unable to squeeze it. There was what Tony took to be a Hydra agent facing off with him, and he took several calming breaths and made slow, measured steps over, hands still at the ready as he listened in to what they were saying.
As they'd discovered early on in the field, they worked well as a team, and as a parenting team this was no different. Steve, as he often was wont to do, generally took charge, instituting a rigid schedule he insisted was just as much for the baby's sake as it was for Tony's. But infants didn't always like to go along with that, and both Steve and Tony suffered their share of sleepless nights when they just couldn't get her to settle, and Tony, at one point, burst into tears and said he couldn't do it any longer and he didn't know why.
"Did I say that?"
Thor smiled, genially, like he was enjoying being able to be the one to explain for a change. "As I understand it, there is a belief on Midgard of the 'soul mate.' To the Goddess and the ancients, they were 'bondmates.' Midgardians romanticize the soul mate but cannot actually sense them."
"Has he said that to you?" Bruce asked, clear interest and a little bit of defense in his voice.
"What are you doing?"
The square was also a small park, trees and shrubberies and lampposts festooned in lights, and Tony motioned for Steve to lead them up a snow-trodden path toward some benches that had evidently been cleaned off sometime earlier that day. They walked through a canopy of white and red and green lights, and as they got to the bench, Tony said, "They're like rats."
Steve went back to his magazine. "Exercise is good for you."
," Steve said with a sigh.
"'Almost' isn't 'did,'" Sam radioed back. "And I was totally watching you over the cams, so don't even pull that shit with me."
Steve blinked. "Uh, Merry Christmas?"
She smiled and folded her hands atop her desk like she was trying to be as patient and gentle with her comments as possible.
"Steve said something about you being more sentimental than you'd ever admit to anyone."
"Sparkling grape juice."
But Tony exhaled a breath and said, "All right, Captain—"
"I could give it a shot."
' sound but didn't actually vocalize a word beyond that.
Steve swallowed, and the apples of his cheeks tinged a little pink as he averted his gaze. "Nothing. Never mind."
Steve stole a quick glance at him, the amber of the passing streetlights reflecting off his face. "How'd you guess?"
"With this? I'm going to go to an actual, normal, everyday medical doctor like this? How am I supposed to explain this?"
He shrugged. "Yeah, I guess, but Jarvis…"
"Thanks."
God, these inside stories and jokes were starting to drain him. He was going to have to have JARVIS start cataloging and indexing them so he could keep them straight until he handed her off to his other self.
Steve gave a curt shake of his head. "I didn't say anything like that. I just said I think she grabbed my ass."
"It's a
Tony tweaked a smile and got to his feet. He scratched the back of his head and said, "Yeah, uh... Follow me?"
But they had never done it when Tony was like this. Not that first week he had been turned into a woman, and not in any of the time since he'd been turned into one again. To be honest, he wasn't sure Steve would even
doing it. I liked doing it for you. I liked the way you would tilt your head back and bear your neck. That's how I know you're gone — really gone. I like seeing that."
"Yeah," Tony said with a laugh as phony as his smile. "Yeah, it was— You know I'm always trying to fuck with people. Thought it might get the press in a bit of a tizzy for a while. It's what I'm best at."
Rhodey grimaced a little and scratched the back of his head. "Yeah, but I got a date—"
Tony motioned over himself — at his belly and his breasts and his general south-of-the-border area — and said, "You know I didn't have any of this a year ago, right?"
But Wilson ignored that and instead said, "You got anything on this you could share?"
. Maybe it was stupid to even potentially let himself get worked up over that, but it was hard not to because it was completely one hundred percent unfiltered sentiment. Olivia might know how to get her way, and Tony didn't doubt for a second she knew how to lie, but this wasn't a lie, and this wasn't her trying to get her way. This was a little girl spending quality time with her papa and telling him that she loved him and adored him in the best way she understood how.
"Whatever," he muttered and sat back in his chair, twirling a stylus between his admittedly nimble fingers. Honestly, the phalangeal dexterity of this body was fantastic and probably the one thing that might make this whole not-turning-back thing not as inherently awful as it could be. "I think I've finally done it."
"We may not even know it's coming — or we may not see it coming. Or maybe it wasn't as bad as it seemed? I don't know. I just know we can't risk changing anything. I don't— I don't want to change anything. I want it to happen how it's supposed to happen. I want my little baby girl that doesn't know when to shut her mouth and has way too much energy for such a small body, and I— I want that life. We're happy, Steve. She thinks we're happy. You can't— Trust me, you can't get much past this kid. If we were miserable, she would know. But we're happy, Steve. We're in love. We have a family, and I just…I want it, Steve. I want it. I don't want to risk losing it for anything."
"Huh?" Tony asked rather eloquently as Steve pulled him into his arms. "Oh," he said as he realized, melting into Steve's embrace as soon as his brain had made the connection. "You fucking sap."
understand why women have these thoughts."
"I just know these things, OK? Short of shooting you up with drugs, really the only thing you can do is let nature take its course."
would end at that point. Tony would still be a woman, as he was one now and forever, but at least the most uncomfortable aspects of it would be over with. Or what he presumed were the most uncomfortable aspects of it. He really didn't have the background to be able to say, but he was pretty sure what he was and had been going through since, really, last November was pretty fucking uncomfortable.
