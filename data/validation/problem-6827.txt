“I wish to extend this gift to you in thanks. It is an honor I hope we can repay with many years of friendship.”
“You mean the fact that we’re currently living in the ghostly past of our destroyed universe? Would we really call that a problem?”
“Let go, Tony, I want to help him alright? I won’t hurt him.” Bruce gently but firmly entreated, and Tony closed his eyes dragging in his familiar scent and when he let go of Steve his whole body was shaking, cold sweeping through him.
Selfish. Stupid. He should have kept them secret. Should never have bragged about the teachers he’d brought in to educate them, the healers who were helping them see themselves as people and not just animals. Should never have painted that tempting red X and begged his enemies to fire at will.
Rhodes departed with a chuckle and a friendly enough nod for Steve and a warning not to listen to anything Wilson said, but not before pointing out that he doubted Steve’s own sanity, what with his willingness to go along with Tony’s particular brand of crazy.
“It’s a genetic trait more commonly found in African Gata, who are closer to true Alurio.” Tony explained. “I don’t imagine you run into many black kats at the country club.”
“I’m not an animal.” Peter responded adamantly, thinking of all the times someone had said he was. Mr. Hepburn. Eugene. That mother in the park who wouldn’t let her kid play with him and Harry because Peter wasn’t wearing a collar.
“Your heart rate has elevated sir and your core temperature has spiked. Do be careful.” Jarvis warned.
Not his body screaming at him, but Captain America holding him up. Talking about him like he was special and something worthy of being proud of. Being carried off to go on grand adventures like he was James fucking Barnes, the luckiest fel that ever existed because he had hands down the world’s best Master in the world.
Tony knew he would, and rather liked that about him if he was honest. Steve just shrugged and continued moving to the music, which was something crooning and slow that tugged at Tony's memory but for the life of him he couldn't remember the name of. Not with Steve's warm hand on his back and his body pressed against his.
"I think what Tony means is it's in the past." Bruce offered tentatively. "Right now you're here and you have all of us."
“Hi.” Bruce’s lips curled into a bashful little smile and Steve felt the tension in her body slowly melt away.
“Let’s get started.” He looked at Natasha who nodded silently in agreement, but when Tony opened his mouth to call for JARVIS to open a particular file he thought would be a good jumping off point Steve pinned him with a stern stare and shook his head.
Prince T’Challa’s mouth curled slowly into a barely there smile, but Tony caught it. The tom didn’t seem to mind that either, his eyes glinting with challenge and a dark sort of promise. As if he’d like nothing better than to see what Tony was made of and the thought of going toe to toe with Ironman didn’t phase him even a little bit.
And look, it’s not like Tony has provided any of his friends with anything like regular eating habits to make a study of. Which means Rogers has paid
A thick voice in heavily accented English fills his head and Tony flinches, hands raising defensively, but there is no visible threat. They’re in a lab now, a dark dingy space without windows full of pale blue light. The soldier knows this place, but he can tell by the way that Tony’s eyes flick about quickly, taking in the strange machinery and the operation bed that the soldier is now strapped to in a millisecond sweep, that he does not.
One day Bruce had made his lunch in the big kitchen on the common floor and gone down to Tony’s lab to invite him up. He’d expected Tony to decline, and wasn’t comfortable with bullying him into it, but to his surprise Tony – after JARVIS had pointed out it had been seventy-two hours since his last night of full sleep and twenty-four since his last meal – had agreed with very little prodding.
"My friends. We thank you for graciously inviting us into your home, and for participating in our sacred traditions today. There is one yet, which we will now partake. Age after age our people have partaken of the 'benubro ' a broth made from the bones of the Benu bird of our home world. To drink from these bones is to invite visions.
“The red paint in the grooves is made from the dust of a meteor that struck my country. The mineral is known to conduct elctro-magnetic energy, which I’m sure Dr. Banner will confirm once he is through examining them. They reminded me of you and thought you might appreciate the extra boost when you are blasting your enemies.” T’Challa grinned cheekily as Tony’s eyebrows raised in surprise.
"So why are you here then?" Tony couldn't help but ask. "Thor said they'd play on our fears, and hate to break it to you Rudolph but I'm not all that afraid of you."
Like the fact that eight times out of ten he’s in Tony’s lab before his ‘be a good boyfriend’ alarm even goes off, because he knows that he could coat his magnificent abs in nip and lay himself bare assed on Tony’s bed and Tony would still be Tony.
“They’re going to want proof Tony.” Captain Killjoy reminded everyone. “How do we prove that AIM continued the project after it was disbanded and that they were the ones behind the attack at the shelter?”
Tony seemed pleased by this, but Thor noticed that the Captain's expression was pained until he turned away.
The bells in Natasha's hair jingled quietly as she turned to look at him, a single brow lifting just slightly in a micro expression of incredulity that he was becoming used to seeing the more missions they took for SHIELD together.
“She ran into a brick wall.” Stone filled in. Licking his lips in a show of anxiousness he leaned forward, encroaching into Tony’s space in a subtle way that made Natasha’s hackles raise. There was a low, intimate quality to his tone as he continued.
Tony’s voice dripped with smugness. He knew he had Fury by the balls. What he’d really wanted to do was rip them off and eat them (metaphorically speaking) but Pepper would kill him if he ruined their strategy. Much as he’d like to tell Fury where to go, Tony needed to bide his time.
Tony felt pressure around his hand and looked down, startled by the sensation of Steve squeezing his hand. Poor guy looked green in the gills. Somehow that made something relax inside Tony, after all of the two of them he was the one who knew how to navigate this kind of circus.
“Of course they were crap. You see what they did to Carter?” Tony giggled again. “But Barnes got the worst of it. Gee golly wiz Cap, you’re just the bees knees.”
Tony Stark, billionaire, philanthropist, and reformed playboy (thank you very much) doing  here you ask? Here being  a dirt road in the middle of Georgia instead of tucked into his luxurious bed beside his smoking hot fiancé eating flavored ice chips off his chest .  Or
But once they’d pulled up outside the red carpet that had been lain along the private air strip in preparation of the ambassador’s arrival silence descended once more. They were hardly alone on the airstrip. Outside the window almost as far as the eye could see there were a crowd of journalists and the like, all of them held back by security and plenty of red tape so that the official men and women who formed the welcoming party could wait where the stairs would end once the Prince’s aircraft landed.
"So yeah, I'll figure out how to stabilize my little condition but think again about knocking on my door the next time you need me. Because if you're looking for a figurehead who you can prop up while you develop more and more creative ways to exploit us, then you're going to have to find another sucker. But I think we both know that I'm the one you want most." Tony fluttered his eyelashes at Fury who looked at him in a way that suggested he wouldn't mind choking him and Tony laughed once more before continuing toward the door.
They needed to understand why drinking the broth had linked her and Steve to a man who on the surface was only connected to one of them. That was the thread they had to pull. Figure out the connection between Ivan and the two of them and Tony knew the whole tangled web would come unweaved.
The lights had been dimmed for better TV watching and the glow of the television had been almost pretty as it splashed over sleepy faces. Tony had been soft against Steve’s chest, contentment in every languid line of his body as another Star Trek episode played and Tony tried to explain to him why something called a Gorn is one of the most terrifying creatures in possible existence (it’s really not) and Steve hadn’t really caught most of it, but he’d been looking down at Tony and thinking how sweetly ridiculous Tony was being and how happy it made him.
The fact that she hadn’t said his name to the others seemed a glaring red signal too. Tony was sure everyone present minus Thor knew about Ivan by now but for some reason she didn’t want them to know she thought he was alive. Why?
Wow. Okay. Tony blinked. That was pretty intense. They must take these legends pretty seriously where Luke came from but holy cow. Thank god this was 2013 and not 492 BC because what the actual fuck.
"Well thank you, Rhuza Rhodes, for coming to our Tony's rescue. He's talked of nothing else." Ana says with a smile, opening the door wide and beckoning the boy inside. Tony fidgets, torn between nerves that Hughard will walk in any moment and too much excitement to care.
Steve frowned. More riddles. He really didn’t like the Kat Queen. Goddess or no Goddess, it was pretty clear that she didn’t care about the plight of the Gata, who only existed because of choices she’d made.
On the stage MiKall and her groom were trading their vows in answer to the question of whether or not they would be pleased by their union and then as was tradition the couple turned to Bastet and asked if she would be pleased by it.
Those who lived long tended to take their time about things, and perhaps it was because of that, that his kinfolk and those who populated the nine realms grew so recalcitrant toward change. The cycles of life and death were unending (even for so-called gods). Whether you experienced them in a few short decades or ages upon ages, death waited for everyone in one form or another and the road there held the same scenery for all. The rising of kingdoms and the falling of them. Battles upon battles for the sake of greed and love in turns.
Natasha who had been kneeling beside a dirt streaked and blood stained Clint had crooked her finger imperiously in his direction and Catman had wordlessly pushed Tony into the woman's dangerous hands. Which she'd dragged all over him, muttering what he was sure were curses in low angry sounding Russian as she examined all of his injuries down to the smallest cut. Frankly, it was a bit stifling and he was very eager to get a chance to interrogate Catman before he pulled his Houdini act again.
JOCASTA cranked the heat up regardless and Nyota rolled her eyes. But a minute or two later when the added warmth had managed to penetrate through her flight suit she uncurled her body and propped her feet up on the dash.
“Why didn’t you tell me you’d applied for an internship at Stark Industries?” Peter’s aunt May had asked the night before, after getting off the phone with Tony Stark.
For the first time that evening he didn’t feel strong or confident. He felt like the earth had just opened up under him and he was falling with nothing to catch him. He jerked as if shocked when T’Challa reached for his hand but didn’t pull it away.
Darren tapped away on his tablet, flicking through the files on the halo-screen. “Okay, in review you want ultra privacy, easy access to the mainland without compromising security, and room to stretch your legs. How much room are we talking?”
In the story of Hansel and Gretel the children outsmart the witch and find her treasure. They get to go home to their father who is free of the wicked woman who forced him to forsake them.
seeing Steve. Which wouldn’t be such a big deal if the guy hadn’t basically been the love of Tony’s life once upon a time (back when he was a stupid kid who believed in things like that) and if said guy hadn’t also completely smashed Tony’s heart to smithereens before he skipped off to basic.
Natasha touched the small lump where E.T. was secreted away in a pocket of her suit, and smiled to herself.  She settled into her perch to wait. She'd watch for a few days, make certain of their routine, and then she'd infiltrate under the cover of darkness.
"Go. Get Stark and leave this place." A rough modulated voice growled from the guy in the cat suit as he tossed something long and thin in Natacha's direction. "I will hold him as long as I can."
Tony's head was warm as it settled back in his lap, the warm muzzy scent of him was thick around them but pleasing, like a spiced drink wafting sinuously in his nose. Bruce couldn't imagine being angry about very much.
He’s fucking terrified. Okay? He’s terrified of how this ends if Barnes is too far gone to be helped. Because Tony has it within him to put the man down, but he was afraid of what it would cost.
Stark’s growling voice roared through his head and the pain intensified. Ivan clutched the sides of his skull, digging claws into the flesh attempting to get to the thing causing so much pain and dig it out.
Steve's voice cracked and he swallowed and Tony let him try and gather himself a moment before he asked, "what did you see?"
“Tony I can’t change what happened in the past, but Maya thinks these people may come after you again. I hope you know I’d never let that happen.”
A/N: Back with another chapter. Wow, I am really blown away that people are still reading this. I really hope you enjoy.
A moment later Tony was pulled inside of the helicopter, and not that he had any real plan but he came up hissing with claws extended, but whatever fight he could have put up he'll never know because something crashed against the side of his skull and after a moment of blinding pain everything went black.
Clint groaned dejectedly just as there was a knock on the door. It beeped and swished open a moment later and one of the SHIELD medical assistants wheeled in a tray with a fresh IV bag and what looked like supplies to change his bandages. At least that might mean a bit of relief from the itching.
“You were right, Tony.” Steve declared staunchly, mouth thinning stubbornly. “This is your fight. It always has been. It was Bucky's too only... I didn't want it to be. I didn't want him to get hurt. Tony I dreamed... I saw..."
He’d never thought it would be possible to see his creation like this, from the inside. A living breathing network of codes that he could almost reach out and touch.
"I didn't know Tony being Queen meant that he called all the shots. I've seen what that kind of leadership does and that's not what this country is about."
Ty hadn’t really understood why Tony couldn’t just send flowers and pay for whatever trinket Sarah wanted to give him to be shipped, so needless to say
“Disengage defense shields and all weapons Station Three.” Harley chirped, clearly talking to someone else in the room. A dry but amused sounding female voice replied.
The soldier blinks. The change is instant, but he’s used to it now. Used to how one skin falls away to reveal his true self, familiar weight of his cybernetic limb returning along with the feeling of tired tired tiredin his bones. He’s not used to the ache it leaves behind. Like that bright-eyed kit is truer than the man who had worn him like a mask.
“I think you have a very nice voice Mr. Stark.” Tink mumbled against Tony’s chest, rubbing her soft cheek against his shirt and Tony felt a rather alarming melting sensation in the region of his heart that he was going to have to have JARVIS look into.
Increased disruption of solitude had stress levels down, blood pressure evening and hormone levels at a balance he’d not observed since before the gamma blast that should have killed him and had created his feral alter-ego instead.
It really did come down to trust in the end. Trust that their relationship was strong enough to weather the grief Steve would undoubtedly feel and the responsibility to go looking, and trust that whatever he’d had in the past, that he wasn’t just going to forsake what he and Tony were building right now.
“But we won’t have to worry about that.” Tony countered, breezily. “Once we get the nanobots installed and I’m all juiced up on BX I’ll be healthy as a horse.”
Grumbling as he hobbled out of bed toward the bathroom on sleep stiff muscles, laden with a full bladder and a grumbling stomach (his body producing ten times his usual energy output seemed to mean eating a lot more) he called out, “Throw a couple of sandwhiches in with that coffee order would you Jay?”
In the penthouse, Tony jerks out of Steve’s arms. Icy cold pain ballooning in his head, putting pressure on all his nerves and he groans, pressing his hands tightly to his skull as if he fears his brains are about to leak out his ears.
Tony wants to make real things. Big powerful engines to put in the boats his father makes, along with canons and guns that make the biggest booms (because the boom is half the fun).
But her message was clear. Either he left her behind or he kept walking for the both of them. Only one of those was an option as far as Tony was concerned.
Thor related distractions were at a steady 10% likelihood due to having to split his time between Jane’s, the tower and Asgard.
Bruce smiled again, tender and almost shy and Tony couldn’t take it anymore, couldn’t stand the thought that he’d hurt Bruce and the others and that Bruce had still trusted him enough to put himself at risk. Just so he wouldn’t wake up alone. Tony reached for his collar, snagging it and pulling him in close, pressing their lips together and shuddering at the warmth that immediately flushed through him.
His father lowers him to the ground as mother approaches, the crowd parting for her like she is a great ship cutting through water. Father looks at her the way a man should look at his mate he thinks proudly. He looks at her like she is the sun, come to greet them all for the rise of another day.
“Stick to the plan Cap, we’ve got this,” Tony gasped, still trying unsuccessfully to rip the weapon from Bucky’s hand, but Bucky somehow managed to maintain his grip even with Natasha trying to strangle him with a choke wire. Yeah, look, Tony didn’t want to hurt the guy, but Barnes definitely didn’t have the same reservations about killing any of them so Natasha’s got the right idea, putting the guy down for a nap by whatever means necessary.
"I will see you soon, Ayeba." The tom called down to him before soaring away, and Tony tried not to pout that he didn't even get a chance to inspect those gorgeous wings to see what kind of metal they were made out of.
Even though he hated swallowing his craw as much as the next guy it was worth it to watch the brief flicker of surprise on her face when he didn’t say what she was expecting. Though that amused slant did return to her mouth as he bit out, "Fine. But I don't think you're any more for being a pawn for a dictator than I am, so how do we get him to talk to us?"
“Okay so the kid was sleeping, the house was quiet, and Santa had set out to deliver presents with the help of his cyber elf squad and had nearly broken the roof coming in for a landing, which you know could be avoided if Santa weren’t stuck in like medieval whatever still riding a sleigh around. What’s wrong with a jet? So Santa’s going to be in a jet from now –”
If Tony were in ancient Egypt right now his hunters would be out hunting and striking fear into the hearts of his enemies, and the toms among them would be clamoring for the chance to share a heat or mate with one of the fels and have a bunch of kits to show off their virility and vigor. And it would all be huzzah.
“How the hell did you get in here?” If there was another entrance to the barn he needed to find it and secure it before AIM found them.
“Was that a question?” Tony had to ask, because Luke was more flustered than Tony had ever seen him before and it was so far from his usual calm confident demeanor that he couldn’t help but wonder if Bruce was right and he was asking too much.
Tony Stark has never held a lover in dark or light and heard the words ‘I love you’ but he was familiar with the idea that there is more than one way to say those three little words. And that right there… that sounded a lot like love to him. So this time, when the clawing want swelled up inside and stabbed him with need, he let it have him, surging forward to grab Steve by the collar of his shirt to demand his mouth. Steve seemed happy to give. Happy to let the heat take them both.
One minute Tony was sneering up at Ty elated by the thought that even if he was tortured and killed here, that at least he was fairly certain that Tiberius Stone was eventually going to get exactly what he deserved, when the sound of gunshots burst in his eardrums.
There’s Betty who catches the janitor at her college correcting work left on the chalkboard and makes their heart flutter.
“We need to know more about the Gata brain and its psychic gifts,” Bruce agreed and with an apologetic glance in Tony’s direction he finished, “We don’t have the research but we know someone who does.”
“Yes! I’ll be at the tower and somebody needs to take care of the others. You’ll be my eyes on the inside. The shelter is the safest place to be right now, but don’t worry. From all the stories dad told us, you’ll see plenty of action before this is over,” Nyota promised with a grim smile.
Most times though, Brian just drinks alone reeking of cheap booze and muttering under his breath about what a waste it all was. He’d blown through the settlement money he got from the fancy tom’s parents in months and he knows better than to try and pull the same trick twice.
And it doesn’t make any sense, but pain is spreading through Ivan’s chest as if someone has plunged a knife there - as if he’d turned around and shot himself.
"After the war I was going to get us a little house. Something with a big yard. Bucky likes to be outdoors. He wasn't going to have to worry about anything ever again because I promised him I'd take care of him." Steve's voice startled Bruce out of his contemplation. The captain wasn't looking at him, but there was a tension in his shoulders that Bruce thought betrayed his anxiety. There was a faint whiff of it in the air, but Steve was holding his emotions together tightly. "Coulson thinks I should see a shrink."
“Natasha’s there.” Phil replied a bit noncommittally and Clint scowled. Natasha wasn’t exactly a diplomat and he still wasn’t sure how much she put up with Stark for his sake. And she had to be pissed at him for running off like that. Tony was a pill but he was more fragile than people gave him credit for and Natasha wasn't known for pulling her punches.
He doesn’t remember going at her with teeth and claws and nothing held back. He’ll see it later when it’s splashed all over the news because she dives out a window trying to escape him and the news chopper shines a light on them and catches it all.
TO ME THAT SAYS THEY HAVEN’T TAKEN THE TIME TO PROPERLY STUDY THEIR TARGET BEFORE PUTTING A PLAN INTO ACTION.
“Yeah, Uncle Steve and mom were working with SHIELD when Steve realized Hydra was behind Project Oversight.” Anya recalled and Nyota nodded.
Never. A stab of fury goes through them, that other being inside pushing to the forefront of their mind.  Never.
He didn’t even care that she was threatening him. Normally he would, but he knew he deserved it. What kind of a person just leaves their partner after learning they might be pregnant? Assholes, that’s who. But it had just been too much at once. The initial shock bleeding away he’d begun to feel the idea out, getting used to it and if he was honest, experiencing a lot of the expected terror at impending fatherhood but not without some excitement too… Having a child with Tony. That was huge. Amazing but so huge.
“I m-mean I don’t think he did. He S-shows me and Harry a lot of his stuff and I’ve never seen…” Peter fumbled to explain but he trailed off meekly when Tony tapped his phone and another clip started to play, this one showing Peter swinging onto the roof of his house and crawling into his bedroom window.
"I don't know Tony. Leaving your team behind. Jumping out of your suit. I personally think cognitively impaired was generous," she responded out of the side of her mouth and Tony thought he saw Natasha incline her head in an agreement.
“Besides,” Steve grunted, crossing to the fridge in order to jerk it open. It looked like he did it just to find something for his hands to do. “My dreams don’t even make sense. In most of them I’m not me. Sometimes I’m Bucky but sometimes I’m someone else too… For instance, last night I was the man who shot you.”
A quiet feminine giggle reminded Tony of the fact that he had an audience. Helen had raised herself up on her side and Bruce's eyes were open, blinking sleepily at him. Thor too, was just staring at him in amusement and it made Tony feel itchy.
“Good.” He keeps his eyes lowered in shame until he feels his father’s firm arm come around his back and he smiles as he is lifted into his father’s arms and nuzzled soundly as they begin to walk again. He’s going to be the Black Panther one day, as mighty a Hunter as his uncle, but he’s happy that for a few years yet he’s still small enough for his father to carry.
He couldn’t say anything but yes when he’d seen how badly she wanted this for him, especially when he wanted it just as badly for himself.
“I’m wounded Romanov,” he teased, placing one hand gently on Natasha’s shoulder to subtly nudge her back. She stared at him with a baleful expression but shifted as he guided and Tony considered it the best he could ask for all things considered. He turned toward Nakia and T’Challa, gesturing with open palm and not unintentionally bearing his wrist. The effect was somewhat diminished by the wrist guards he wore but he didn’t think the symbolism would be lost on the pair of toms.
He couldn’t see the man’s eyes through the dark lenses in the mask of his costume but the guy had to be looking at him, pressed as close as they were and… staring right at him and all.
It was easier to get caught up in the bright whirlwind nature of the kid’s thoughts, but it wasn’t safe to get inside the kids head. It was bad enough Harley was involved in their mess as it was, Tony couldn’t further screw up his life by accidently screwing with his head in ways he might not be able to repair.
“On the contrary. Though in my youth I did attempt to sneak around, I have found that if they don’t have the fortitude to stand up to the scrutiny of my Queen generally it’s because they are not worthy.”
He worked silently and JARVIS knew him too well to intrude on his thoughts while he stewed on the problem at hand.
Pepper gripped his arm in a staying fashion, but a rumbling noise drew everyone's attention to Thor who was crossing his arms and looking very displeased.
He’d felt the first wave of Heat not long after they’d returned to the tower. It had come on quick without repeating the usual build up, and had hit hard enough to make Tony fear for his life as his temperature spiked and extremis went into overdrive due to the adrenaline rush. Bruce had kind of freaked out because all their tests indicated that Tony would in fact go KABOOM if he didn’t limit the level of stress on his body, and Heats could be anywhere from a three to seven day event.
"Charlatans and louts, the lot of them," he often mutters as they drive by beggars in the street, many who Tony knows will send their women to capture your attention with tearful pleas even as their boys empty your pockets. He's seen it happen.
“You misunderstand me,” T’Challa replied with a slow shake of his head. “In a real situation like that you would never have let anyone else be on that bridge but yourself. Though it would be a foolish and ultimately selfish move for a Queen to make, that is the nature of who you are.”
Clint had never expected to be a part of a pride any more than Tony had. He know how much that meant to someone like Clint, who as a circus attraction hadn't even gotten the illusion of being a part of a family before this.
They shrink into the wall, unable to move they’re so paralyzed with fear. The fear is so strong it’s a sour stench in their nose and there’s absolutely nothing they can do to bank it.
“The woman on the right is a 99.9 percent match for McKenzie Walsh. Twenty-one-year old resident of Virginia. The feline on her left does not match with any registered identity within the prespecified margins, Sir.”
“I’m giving you a chance to save your ass, so I suggest you quit with the threats, take your knock off purse, get in your car, and drive as fast as you can in the other direction. How’s that actuator coming Harley?”
It was a beautiful thing to watch, the dawning of awe in their eyes as they saw each other in their entirety for the first time, as their eyes filled with tears and their lips vowed to be one with each other and one together before claiming each other in a kiss.
He wasn't scared of Debar exactly, and the scent rolling off him coupled with the body language was openly playful rather than threatening, but Tony wasn't used to people trying to touch him without trying to get something from him.
“Maybe someone should ask Luke if he feels up to it? He might have valuable insight on the subject.” Natasha suggested dryly.
Actually Donny was kind of a bore, but he was a staunch supporter of gata rights so you took the good with the bad.
"Besides, I'm a bit long in the tooth now." Tony made a show of sighing, knowing he looked damn good thank you very much. "How you manage to keep up with the young beauties Ty I'll never know."
It was Ivan who had picked up all her pieces when they carved a heart enflamed with passion from her chest and reminded her not to drink poison, even if the bottle said 'Drink Me' with a face hard to resist and eyes that reflect her own misery.
"This was a bad idea." Clint grumbled, and he didn't look much better off. In fact, Thor was the only one who looked unruffled by traveling through the BiFrost. At some point during the physically taxing journey he'd traded his earth clothing for his Asgardian armor and was standing there looking well... mighty.
“It works doesn’t it? I mean yeah it sucks, maybe you lose a couple billion people on earth, but if you don’t then you lose two whole universes. You know how many people die in that scenario?”
“Alright.” he grunted in response, swishing his tail as if there were some annoying fly he wanted to swat but the only annoying thing here really was Prince T’Challa and how well he seemed to have Tony’s number. He couldn’t really argue against that. T’Challa hadn’t really harmed him or anyone else in his mission and the mission itself made a lot of logical sense. Yeah maybe he’d toyed with Tony a little bit with all that flirting but Tony was a big boy (he’d literally just told Rhodey that) and had known what he was about when he’d let it continue. Hell, he’d been an active participant up until he’d decided to commit to a relationship with Steve.
Damn. Tony thought with dread, gut clenching. The fallout from this was going to be – no, no time for that. First things firsts. Take these guys down. Then he and Pepper could come up with a strategy for damage control.
He's six and Obi lets him try a sip of his dink, and even though it’s sour in his mouth and pungent in his nose Tony pretends to like it.
Well well well then, Tony thought darkly.  This certainly explained that squeaky clean record. To neat. Too damn tidy. He'd known that. And now that it was all coming together in his head, the clues had been there.
“Hello, Ayeba,” Father greets her with a smile and a familiar endearment, and for a moment her gaze is soft for him as she returns his kiss, but she’s stern once more when she pulls away and at last speaks.
“…think the recent surge in feral activity is cause for public concern? First the attack on Oscorp and just two days ago the robbery at ViXon Tech. People are beginning to wonder if the Avengers are truly capable of shutting these guys down. Are you?” the host was asking.
His lips turned up in a tentative (Tony almost dared to say shy) smile as he murmured in greeting, "Hey Tony."
It was strange. Clint got the feeling that Phil was saying more than he'd actually said. It left him with the feeling of having missed something vital in the conversation. For his part Luke just finished rewrapping Clint's bandages, and stood once more.
With all that heat sex and claiming going around there should be a gaggle of kits running through the tower, nobody caring too much which of Tony's pairings sired them because kits belong to the pride and pride means family. God can you even imagine?
“I alerted you exactly five times Sir that Mr. Debar was on his way. Perhaps if you were better rested you would not so frequently zone out your surroundings.”
“We can’t just ‘move’ a planet!” Kate scoffed, fingers moving to form quotation marks. “What the hell are you even talking about right now?”
There was something rather beguiling about Luke's sleepier variant. Kind a siren song actually. Tony was well aware that the distant urge he had to curl up beside the man all lazy like and allow himself to be petted and protected was a biological throwback that could kindly shut the hell up.
“Sir, I highly recommend you remain in the – ” he remembered that JARVIS tried but he was so far beyond hearing.
"I don't see why I can't make a corner jump if we're gonna allow that stupid rule that your king can jump two spaces just because you reached my side of the board twice, " Steve grumbled good naturedly, and just that was enough to make Tony smile despite the continuous buzzing of a headache in the back of his head.
“My mom should be at the dinner. Mrs. Keener always falls asleep to the soap operas, so I sneak in sometimes when I need something.” Harley explained on a whisper as they crept through the back door of the house. His mother left a key for him there under a pot just in case he ever needed to get inside, as his grandmother tended to lock him out and forget to feed him.
"Wait."Fury interjected before Tony could get very far. "Before you go, you should know that we've been negotiating with the kingdom of Wakanda."
While Steve would have had to be something less than human not to crave more of the peace he felt when he was with Tony, there was nothing to do about it but wait. They had to tackle one thing at a time. He couldn’t resent Tony taking care of Bruce, and there was his surgery to get through before they could talk about expanding the Pride any further.
“Because I want to believe in us too, and I saw something that rocked my faith.” Tony frowned and Steve pressed on gently. “That’s just my point. Last night I chose to have a future with you and if that’s going to work, then Sweetheart our faiths gotta be in each other. Not in dreams or anything else. Don’t you think?”
“What’s the matter with him?” he heard Mrs. Keener’s muddled voice demanding fearfully. “I’ll send you to the work house for this, mark my words Boy.”
Medical science was definitely not Tony's expertise, and Bruce kept reminding him he wasn't that kid of doctor either, but Tony always kept at least one spoon in the pot. As soon as the idea had taken root he'd called in a favor from an old friend, who'd been happy to share the work she'd been doing and critique theirs in order to fill in the gaps in their knowledge.
“Sex kittens.” Sonia amended with a sniff and a dismissive wave of her hand. “I’m sure that none of them were innocents.”
He won’t lose Wanda and Pietro like he lost the others. They will not be terminated. Ivan would kill before–
He’d taken Wanda and Pietro there the day before and they’d cased it for hours, noting every exit and every potential escape route in case things went to shit.
He shouldn’t have done it, but they are working on a new vessel down at the yard. A submarine! Tony had seen the plans for it on his father’s desk a few months ago and Hughard and Obi have talked about nothing else ever since.
Tony had always found the domestication drugs repugnant, but he’d never found the scents of other Gata as grating as he found it now. He’d been used to it before the team (everyone smelled that way besides him) but now it was like he couldn’t stand it. Not after surrounding himself with a team of ferals, and certainly not after experiencing firsthand what Andre Dyson’s probably ridiculously expensive cologne was trying to imitate.
"So the motorcycle was a good idea." Steve deadpanned and Tony rolled his eyes nudging him in the back.
Tony glared at him and the tom just continued to grin, full of teeth. On the other side of him Bruce coughed into his arm, but if he thought Tony couldn’t read his amusement loud and clear over the bond he was an idiot.
The thief curses in Hungarian as he is roughly searched. The officer, finding Tony's small wallet glances about. Spotting him standing with Yinsen beside the car his eyes widen in recognition. Few people are rich enough for private vehicles and everyone who doesn't know his Uncle Isiah says Tony's the spitting image of his father.
“Yes.” Tony took a slow sip from the literal goblet at the edge of his plate without breaking eye contact. He knew she’d see it as weakness. He lowered the goblet back to the table with a thunk and finished.
"How long have you been state side?" Tony asked the tom, smoothly filling the uncomfortable silence.
“I could always leave you on the side of the road if you’d like. Good luck finding another ride out here.”
“Yes, it is a shame that your father and I cannot trust you to your schooling and must receive endless complaints from your teacher.”
“I’m happy to note that even here in the west, bureaucracy is still the death of reason. I think if I have to sit across from one more general explaining that monogamy and fidelity are not mutually exclusive, I will not be responsible for what I do.” The prince’s dry reply floated through the room and Tony laughed. He was somewhat surprised by his genuine amusement, but not surprised at all that out of everything they could ask a real live Alurian Prince, the public seemed most fascinated by the discovery that the king of Wakanda had two wives and this was not at all uncommon in his culture.
They burry themselves in work. As long as the work is good Ross is happy. They try not to ask for extra or to reach above their station. Betty urges them to push for more. She gets frustrated that they won’t.
Like he'd been caught pissing on a national monument and was standing before some tribunal court about to be voted off the island for sheer stupidity.
He remembers trying to be good in those days. The strain of doing his best not to screw up only to fail every time wearing him thin.
"You're behind Brucie. Her parent didn't like his parent's attitude. And remember, mommy wanted to hook up with that artist guy." Tony sneered as the commercial ended and the show resumed.
“I heard you humming it quite frequently in the tower,” T’Challa admitted, a tad bashfully. Tony’s grin turned into a bit of a snicker.
Steve's head was a graveyard, full of dark spots and broken networks. Watching the lights slowly power on in brighter and brighter bursts was one of the most beautiful and humbling things Tony had ever witnessed.
"Agent Barton was sent in purely to observe." Fury started for what sounded like the hundredth time and Tony held up a finger to halt him, pushing forward with barely a pause for breath. He couldn't look at Clint.
Tony gave him a long considering look, like he was assessing him for flaws in his code and Peter shrank back into the chair embarrassed and ashamed. Why had he thought he could pull this off? He should have told Aunt May right away somebody had made a mistake.
"Destiny belongs to those who build it?" Clint echoed Queen Bastet's words from earlier and Tony opened his mouth to reply when the door opened, Thor hurrying inside the darkened room.
Thank you so much for your continued support on this fic. I still can't believe anyone else besides my derp self loves it as much as I do. I'm sorry I didn't get to your comments this week (it was a really busy one) but I didn't want to miss posting on time.
In the beginning Zero had fought, but in the end, despite all of his promises to the contrary, he chose the fire of the furnace.
Thor walked with his friends off the Skiff and saw them to the lineup, trying to keep the worry that plagued him off of his face. He'd anticipated Bastet using the hunt as a test but he'd not expected her to ban him from assisting his friends. It was very worrisome indeed.
“You’re unstable, Tony.” Natasha responded lowly, voice strained with fatigue, her eyes searching his with deep concern. “The virus…”
"Well the rest is deserved.” Tony assured, and then he slid his arm through Steve’s giving it a gentle squeeze. “You don't mind if I steal this guy do you?  Gotta talk to a man about a dog."
"I understand that Mr. Coulson is your lover and perhaps as such he grants you a certain illusion of equality, but he is still your master. Isn't he?" The aide asked.
Up next: Tony's survived surgery (still breathing with us) and the Avengers have thrown themselves into navigating their new bonds and solving the mystery behind the mercenaries and Tony's stolen tech. Steve and Natasha are forced to delay their hunt for the Winter Solider when the trail of the mercenaries leads to SHIELD's home turf in Washington. Back in New York, Tony struggles to juggle his responsibilities at the company, the new build on Resilience, and the welfare of the shelter kats up north who need growing room. Lucky for him he's got Clint and a possibly renegade royal to help out.
Natasha wasn’t having them anymore because she didn’t want to. And because she and Tony were bonded it meant she didn’t have to surrender her mind to Bucky’s pull. Not with Tony guarding it. Steve understood why it made Natasha more comfortable to give the dreams up. The idea of having someone like the Winter Soldier walking around in her head unbidden was probably the only thing dangerous enough in the world to terrify a woman like Natasha. And Steve understood perfectly well he should be scared too of giving himself over every time he closed his eyes, but he just couldn’t be.
Tony turned to Steve, who was standing beside him watching over the group of children, the glistening windows of the city towers rising behind them.
"My tower my rules Barton." Tony shrugged and Bruce chuckled, stroking the soft strands of Tony's hair, paying close attention to the hair on his ears, and smiled inwardly at the low purr that rumbled out of his chest.
“Yeah well you did kind of throw this dinner in his face.” Tony reminded and T’Challa chuckled again, nodding graciously in acknowledgement. He could afford to be gracious. He’d arranged for dinner to be catered by Carbone, New York’s finest Italian-American restaurant (which definitely didn’t cater to just anyone) and with the garden surrounded in fairy lights and the music softly drifting over the sound of the tinkling fountain wasn’t enough, the guy looked unfairly delicious over candle light.
The soap is foul tasting. Herr Vonkov grips his cheeks hard enough to bruise and jams the bar of soap in his mouth.
“She did say her spirit would be with us.” Thor added with a wry tone and Steve huffed a bitter laugh.
Observing the stunned expressions of Thor's teammates RaTu cocked her head at Tony, eyes narrowing. "Have you not successfully learned the art of bludweild? Thor led me to believe that you are a Queen, though you still smell as a child to me."
a teasing thought trickled through his mind. It reminded him of Natasha and he chuckled under his breath shooting her a glance. Her gaze met his knowingly and her lips tilted in a smirk.
Steve shuddered and bit his lip, turning his head away only to feel Tony’s fingers against his jaw nudging it back. His gaze was soft but firm as he looked back at Steve and said, “I wanted you, Rogers and like a perfect idiot I had you. I wanted
Damn. Tony swallowed thickly, suddenly finding himself unable to meet anyone directly in the eye until his gaze was drawn by a warm chuckle from Debar.
There were a pair of guards on the roof but they were either amateurs or too comfortable in the silence of the woods because they stayed facing one direction for long stretches of time as they chatted with one another, only bothering to do a routine sweep whenever it seemed to occur to them.
Tony didn’t need the glint of metal peeking out from under Barnes drooping right sleeve, or for the other kat to turn and look at him to know that it really was Barnes standing there. All those trips through Bucky’s memories and playing games of kat and mouse in his head had forged a link between them. Not a full bond by any means, but Tony would forever recognize the feel of Barnes’ mind. His distinct taste.
Tony hadn’t thought his body could be any more of a disaster, but extremis had proved him wrong. Sure, the regenerative virus had ‘fixed’ some areas. His organs were in prime condition (his ticker hadn’t been this whole or this healthy since he was fourteen years old). Basically, all the wear and tear he’d put on the old machine had been fixed by an ace mechanic and given a fresh coat of paint to boot; but out of the frying pan and into the fire and all that, because he’d traded a bum heart and a shitty auto-immune system, riding a hormone imbalance and several deficiencies, for a nano-virus that was determined to evolve every last inch of him or destroy what parts of him would not comply.
“Pallid.” Steve’s mouth was still scowling but Tony was getting better at reading his particular brand of dry humor and spotted the hint of amusement that flashed through his eyes before he turned to Harley, who was decked out head to toe in a green and red elf costume/flight suit. The ten-year-old had balked at first at the embarrassment of dressing up like one of Santa’s helpers, but once he’d learned that a condition of flying in Santa’s Jet was to get on board with the holiday requisite of looking like an idiot, he’d happily conceded.
Because yeah, Tony totally would have been burnt toast if their friendly stray Catman hadn't shown up to distract the baddy long enough for Tony to get airborne and deal with the fact that there was a supernova building in his chest, he'd just blown through his gauntlets, and his hands had looked like butcher meat.
That wasn't an option with the interference from the tower and unless she took out the guards and disabled the jamming device disrupting her tech, there wasn't much she could do about it. Taking out the guards was a last resort option. She'd have to get in and get out before someone either noticed they were missing or that there was something wrong with their signal tower. She told herself to stop being paranoid and that this was why it wasn't smart to form connections. They were distracting.
T’Challa and the Dora Milaje clearly did not have that problem. T’challa had said they’d been training since they were small children and Tony wasn’t going to be the first to call the man a liar. Tony’s forte definitely wasn’t hand to hand combat so he was happy to pass up the cocktail blend of martial arts that they were serving up, however Natasha looked (and felt) to be having the time of her life. Even recovering from an injury the woman loved a challenge
“Yep.” She lied, trying for breezy but he arched a brow at her and she knew he wasn’t buying it. Huffing she sagged her shoulders and came clean, snapping. “Fine, no I didn’t. Happy?”
He’d paid for Peter to go to school and always showed interest in his progress and never stopped him playing with Harry. He and Aunt May were still always invited for the big New Years charity gala the Osbornes always held, and Peter only had to wear the leash Harry had got him before dinner when everybody was still hung up on making the proper impression.
“It hurts.” Natasha confirmed with a smirk but when Steve winced she shook her head slowly. “Not necessarily in a bad way. A surge of endorphins and reproductive hormones is a nice built in Band-Aid. That and some just like it rough.”
“Have you lost your damn mind!” he thundered, nerves still jumping because he could have seriously hurt Steve and Steve didn’t seem all that concerned about that blast potentially hurting him.
partners. And Clint's pretty sick of the back burner. The only way he and Tony are going to resolve their issues is if they talk right? Clint would just like the record to show he hates emotional shit as much as Stark does and this is probably going to suck.
Was everything in place? He asked himself one more time, going through the endless check-list in his mind. If he died tomorrow, would he leave the others with as much protection as he could give them. Did he buy them enough options? Was there anything he’d overlooked?
He picked his way carefully down the hall, peering into empty rooms. There was a lot of noise coming from upstairs, and he figured most of the fight had moved there and that anyone on the first floor had already fled or been evacuated.
“I won’t tell if you won’t but you know Riri,” Jaime was agreeing as he slung an arm over her shoulder. “The toaster will probably have told her. I swear she talks to machines.”
Tony bristled, the burning edge of Steve's fight wreaking havoc on his senses. There was the one part of him that wanted to curl up small and appease, to soothe and gentle the volatile forces surging within Steve because he was fel and he was good for this, good for bringing a tom back from the edge; but no dice. Because he's not just some fel, who is going to tuck his tail in and mewl every time a tom gets angry at him.
“He does know this isn’t a real fight and you’re not actually dead doesn’t he?” Tony heard Clint mutter and rolled his eyes.
For once, the kit doesn't plan on getting into any trouble. He's just going to the corner store. He knows he’s only foolin himself though as he goes through the aisles, picking out groceries and placing them into the basket he’s brought.
He wondered if T’Challa had heard those thoughts too, but all thoughts flew from his head as the prince considered him with a penetrating stare and one hand reached to gently grasp his, lifting it gently to his lips. The kiss he brushed against Tony’s knuckles was barely there, but Tony felt it, deep in the pit of his stomach, fluttering in his chest like a bird taking flight.
“Mom puts up with it because she depends on Granny’s money and doesn’t want to risk the altogether insane and unfair custody battle that would ensue because, per article twelve of the Breeding Ordinances, she would have to pay a huge fine for her unlawful use of your grandmother’s property, and since your father was in fact someone elses property, that in turn begs the question of who does Harley Keener actually belong to. That about right?”
"This softer naive thing you're trying, I like it. It's different." He took another long swallow of his drink.
He was aware of the fact that they both needed medical attention. Steve definitely did. He’d taken the brunt of the blast like an idiot. Like Tony was some sort of damsel in distress when he –
"The great dynasties would not have been possible without the Alurio. We are the children of the panther god. We share her gifts, and many of us her brilliance, and through her we are given the ability to become one. The great civilizations were built in a time of prosperity, when the Alurian queens still sought their mates among the royal blood, and were woven into one heart along with their human brothers."
They’re still small but they’re someplace different now. Some place that is cold with depressingly bare walls and a single lamp. The room is just as scarcely decorated as its walls with a twin sized bed, a lone dresser and an ugly maroon rug.
She and Dr. Salek checked all of their vitals and made sure the monitors were properly working before looking up from her station to nod at Pepper and Coulson.
"You are the sixth Avenger, Tony." Thor grumbled as he opened the tower room and Tony breathed a sigh of relief.
“A kink you haven’t tried Tony? I’m shocked.” Natasha jabbed from the doorway and Tony flipped her the bird as he pushed up into the kiss. Steve chuckled against his mouth.
Jaime didn’t rise to the bait. He was a lot like his dad sometimes, but annoyingly just when she was most geared up for a fight he turned into his other father and just gave her this look like she was being the biggest brat on the planet and he wasn’t going to take any of her shit. It could be annoying as hell but she loved him anyway.
The Peppers. The Rhodeys, the Happys... he can count them on three fingers; but the way things stand now with the team, and the way Steve looks at him and says 'together' made Tony believe that might be changing.
“You loved him.” Steve guessed and Natasha nodded, visibly collecting herself. It still amazed Steve that she felt safe enough or that it was necessary enough that she could be vulnerable this way with him. It was humbling, and a little terrifying because she was one of the strongest people he’d ever met. He didn’t want her to be hurt. Not in the past, not now. Not ever. Steve reached between them to take her hands cupping them gently and she started, staring down at them as if they were somehow alien, and then up at him as if he was.
“All done!” they crow with triumph and Mama nuzzles her nose against their rounded cheek, and they giggle at the tickle of her whiskers.
"She's fine Tony. You made this room to block telepathy remember?" Bruce tried to soothe him, but Tony found it only marginally easier to breathe.
So Steve was Howards greatest creation (whatever else he says) and he never let Tony forget that (even if he seemed to, when he was prattling at video cameras and begging Tony to continue his life's work) even when Project Rebirth was abandoned again after Erskine's untimely death.
The fact was Bruce Banner had been domesticated by his parent. The destruction of certain neurological pathways in his brain made it very difficult for him to express aggression. In an effort to continue the work of Project Rebirth he with supervision from his guardian at the time (General Ross) had attempted to assist a team of scientist in order to develop a serum that would restore those pathways.
Phrased like that the prince had no choice but to be understanding and Tony was just fine with that.
"Do you want to know the real reason I stopped making weapons? It's because I realized that people only had one interest in dropping bigger and badder bombs on their neighbor just because they could, and the guys who sell them only care about the profit. Not so much about the hands they’re putting them in. I won’t be a part of that system again. But the world is the world. And we have to give our army what they need to protect our home."
"They will learn quickly not to underestimate her." Thor was sure. "Just as they learned today not to underestimate the both of you."
Tony glances up and rolls his eyes because they're looking at each other again, in the way that Tony has figured out means they want to have sex with something (probability being each other). He has a very vivid imagination that he doesn’t want to invoke.
He reached inside the suits controls with barely a thought. With a series of clicks and groans the suit locked into place like a knight standing guard, plates parting like doors to let Tony step through, clad in the skin tight under armor he'd developed for the sentry capable suit.
“You want to go off world? Just like that? No preparation and no plan, just hop into a wormhole and travel to another planet?!” Clint had demanded upon learning of Tony’s plans and Thor had resisted the urge to remind him that Asgard was not only his ally, but they had graciously lent their very prince to his cause; but he could see that there was more to Clint’s reaction than just anger at the presumed danger Tony was willing to put himself in (yet again).
It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Dad was supposed to live a very long time, and Nyota was supposed to figure everything out before the mantle of Queen ever passed down to her but it hadn’t worked out like that. Instead the whole universe had ended, and their parents had put them all on the ARK and told them to take care of each other. Now it was Nyota’s job to take care of her cousins and younger siblings and make sure they always had an anchor, whether she was fit for the job or not, because she was the only Queen. But she was only seventeen and she totally wasn’t ready for this!
He’d stood his ground even though that thing could have pulverized him and then the thing was suddenly just a smoking pile of rubble and the real Ironman was there, congratulating
"More flings?" Luke muttered beneath his breath but Tony was too busy to check for judgment because there was the mystery of Maya's sudden appearance and the fact that he didn't give a shit.
This was not a drunken stupor. This was the aftermath and whatever Steve had seen it had rocked him.
He was right, Nyota realized. If Steve didn’t step down as Consort there was no telling what that would change. It had been her papa and Tony who had lead the Pride to victory and declared their independence from the United States.
“JARVIS! Run a facial recognition.” Tony barked and a moment later the A.I. Chimed back with an answer.
Oh crap, he was looking at her now. All understanding and tender, and too damn knowing. Nyota hunched, her tail arching defensively as she turned her head away from him, suddenly finding it hard to meet his eyes.
Natasha was scared of it but she wouldn’t say so. She'd sat there staring at the file, only speaking to say it was up to him.
"That is very nice Tony." Thor, who had a giggling Clint thrown over his shoulder for some reason, beckoned at the end of the hall. "But it grows late and I fear your Midgardian constitutions were not prepared for the strength of the broth."
“I’m sure he’s got it covered. Being a medic and all.” Tony muttered as he rooted around in the refrigerator for his specialty yogurt, the one made on that Swedish farm he liked. He only really got a craving for cream once every three months or so (coincidently right around his heat) so sue him for liking what he liked.
When he’d run ahead of the team. Ignored good sense and all their warnings to stop and wait. He’d just lost it, and now Steve was hurt. Clint was hurt. It was his fault.
Lightning arced through his veins, hot and quick, burning brightly behind his eyes until he though his eyeballs would burst into flames right there in his sockets.
He was a quite baby. At first. According to his mother he slipped into the world with minimal fuss, staring in wide eyed confusion at the bright lights and the faces of the doctors and nurses, discomfited by the changing of hands, but easily captivated once more by the first sight of his mother’s face.
The probability of a successful pride bond occurring was harder to determine because it relied on too many very extreme variables, primarily Steve and Tony.
And just like that the line clicked dead and Tony stared at the ceiling in affront, as if it were responsible for his being hung up on.
He couldn’t say what it was about the guy that put him on edge, it could be blamed on his ‘sensitive’ state and the guy’s unfriendly company mug shot, but whatever. He wasn’t going to ignore his instincts.
“Tony, that’s my entire point. You can’t go through an invasive completely experimental procedure like this and not accept that it’ll be putting an already at risk pregnancy at greater risk.” Bruce sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “If there even is a child to consider. We need to test you, and depending on the answer you and Steve need to have a serious talk about how you want to move forward.”
"Did the doctor come back early?" She asked, knowing very well that he hadn't. Steve didn't even have the grace to look mildly guilty about it, the line of his jaw going stiff and stubborn as he went back to work unwrapping himself. Stark would have some witty innuendo for that, but she'd leave it to him. She was content to watch and enjoy her apple.
It didn’t matter what his sweat glands were doing or whatever the hell it was he’d been building with (not)Luke; because you couldn’t build anything real on lies and that’s what the tom had done. He’d lied to Tony from the beginning so that left them at ground zero. Attraction happened, Tony was a fucking expert on attraction and the doors it could open. He’d learned under fire.
“He’s a good kid.” He stated simply, keeping his pace slow as they meandered in the general direction of the elevator. Jena nodded and silence descended. She was young for a mother of a ten-year-old boy, and showing all the signs of being over tired and over worked. Her clothes probably hadn’t been new in years and hung off her in a way that suggested she’d lost weight since they’d been bought. There were stress lines appearing prematurely on her face and her hair didn’t look like it hadn’t seen anything but a five-dollar cut in years. She couldn’t have looked farther from him, but it was hard for Tony not to imagine his father standing in her shoes making excuses to his friends for Tony’s big mouth.
"Ah..." Ty hedged nervously away from Thor's looming figure, but he'd never been one to back down easily and that hadn't changed. "Then afterward. For old times sake? Don't you think you owe me that?"
Tony was going to tell her she didn't have the slightest clue what she was talking about, but for some reason Catman flashed through his thoughts. He was the only tom besides Steve that Tony found even remotely interesting (now that Clint had taken himself off the table).
omeone else. Someone he knows, even though he knows that’s impossible. Someone whose voice shudders through him and pulls at everything inside of him.
The longer he wrestled with it the more uncomfortable it made him. A museum of some kind would feel like trying too hard and would probably only highlight how much smarter than everyone Tony was and how Steve barely even finished school and had certainly never gone to a fancy university.
"He is dangerous." Tony reminded himself as well as the rest of the room. He'd witnessed multiple times just how dangerous. Helen had a point; he ought to check himself before he wrecked himself. "Which is why I'm going to figure out just who he is and how to deal with him."
And, if they were super duper blessed, when it was time for heat to take Tony's body and trash it for four days some lucky bastard might get to share his. Tony might even claim them as a mate. That would make lucky tom Queen Consort, which would mean they were the baddest tom in town and got the pleasure of leading the troops. All the other hunters had to listen to what they said or it was bad news bears.
And that was of course exactly why Tony had chosen to dress the way he had. It was about letting everyone see. Flaunting what they couldn’t own.
He shut the others out, seeking that particular bond he always ignored, the familiar signatures of Steve’s brain patterns that both attracted and haunted, and allowed himself to sink within them.
Fury's pissed at Tony which is one thing (because Tony's pissed at Tony) but since Fury's been making deals with Viastone, Tony's ability to give a fuck is next to zero.  Clint is chained to a hospital bed so he misses the debriefing but he makes an intense new friend and he does mean INTENSE.
Once Thor had lived for the revelry of warfare, for the presumed glory of foes vanquished. He knew better now, and had lost much in the learning. Yes, much indeed, but, he had his Jane and the Midgardians who had sheltered him in a time of great weakness for companionship and comfort. For that was the true point of it all, what even his father Odin in all his wisdom sometimes forgot in the passing of ages.
"No. My friend Bucky, he was a fel..." Steve replied gently with a wry smile. "Couldn't walk five steps without him hanging on you when his time came."
The Holiday season seemed to bring out the worst in people, including the local population of crazies. Tony wished the worst thing he had to deal with was a crazed Manhattanite at a door buster sale, but with A.I.M. fallen and SHIELD tearing their ranks apart, it's been nothing but midnight facility raids and daytime retaliatory style hiss-fits for the last week and a half.
Tony almost blushed. So enthusiastic shower sex was great and all but contrary to what the magazines printed he didn’t relish the thought of walking around smelling like sex. T’Challa seemed to read his mind though and shook his head.
Tony thought as Harley began helping him to take down the blockade, still chattering. Tony looked to Natasha, anxiousness coiling in his chest. He was just a kid, after all.
All the tension that had been in her body a moment ago melted away, replaced by such a confident mask that if the memory wasn’t burned into his brain he’d be tempted to think he’d imagined the way she’d looked so vulnerable when he’d first walked in.
A serving boy was ladling a spicy smelling broth into the bowl at the edge of Tony's plate as a resounding cry took up through the hall. Sure hands. That was kind of funny, considering that Tony's hands weren't at all sure about picking up that little bowl and putting that reddish substance in his body.
Her reproachful stare would have made her thoughts clear even without the bond, but the bond was handy for trading private little quips. He grinned wolfishly at her and thought back with a wink.
“Please don’t tell anybody.” Peter pleaded, finally looking up at Tony despite the fear he felt. He had to make him understand. “T-they’ll kill me or take me away, and I can’t do that to my aunt. I’m all she has.”
“Captain Rogers if you could take your seat please,” an annoyed sounding Dr. Salek interrupted trying to edge past Steve and the captain muttered an apology before squeezing Tony’s hand once more and making his way toward the others in the observation area.
"There we go, ten after seven. Too late to get a reservation anywhere." Tony pointed out and Steve just smiled.
And there it was. Tony didn’t have all the pieces to the puzzle but his brain worked quicker than most and he could do well for himself with just a few pieces. T’Challa was the prince. Not the crown prince, so he wasn’t going to marry the next Queen, but that didn’t mean he was free to marry just anyone off the block.
They weren't the worst battles that Tony had ever been part of but they were time-consuming, aggravating and dangerous in his current condition.
Clint reached for the remote and flicked the television off and he could practically feel Phil’s questioning look.
T’Challa inclined his head in a deferring fashion but chose not to reply. Tony had kind of figured he wouldn’t. The prince was a man of few words and seemed to have little need or patience for the kind of swaggering and showboating Tony had come to expect from his peers and had learned to master. A (very) small part of Tony kind of admired that and was envious. What must it be like to truly just not give much of a damn?
He wondered if she was still bothering the receptionist out in the waiting room with a million questions. Probably, he thought with a smile.
Tony had always known that he had to share Steve with Bucky Barnes. He hadn’t kept Steve at arm's length just for his health. Or maybe that was exactly the reason why he had.  Because alright, he knows that any relationship therapist would say that you can’t own other people and real love isn’t about possessing someone else, blah blah blah. But pretty or not, Tony’s not human, and bonding is as close to owning another person as it gets. The fact remains that choosing to love Steve was choosing to share Steve.
“Maybe it was better than the alternative.” Tony shot back coolly, hands remaining in his pockets so she didn’t see the way they fisted. He couldn’t help but bristle at the implication in her tone, like he was only paying attention to Harley because there was something in it for him. As if anyone could have walked away knowing the kid’s situation.
Bruce’s gentle thoughts wrapped around him and Tony closed his eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath.
"Thanks for the concern, it's touching how much you care." Tony sneered and Fury gave a derisive snort.
"She would never! How dare you besmirch my lady's name!" He lunged forward with curved claws extended and Tony had only a split second to process before he'd jumped in front of Clint and knocked the guy over the edge of the Skiff with a repulsor blast.
He nodded toward the other side of the room and Rhodey obediently followed his gaze to where Pepper was on her phone, motioning for one (or both of them) to come to her with an altogether too professional air. Something must be wrong, but she didn’t want people to know it was wrong.
“Aye, it is a common practice among the royal houses that is true. Though I see now how it can bring much more trouble than it avoids.” Thor answered with a grave tone and Tony knew for sure now that he was thinking of Loki and all that they had suffered and lost between them. After a heavy moment of silence he appeared to put the weight on his shoulders aside and smiled to lighten the mood.
"Relax, it was a love tap." Killian turned his head briefly toward Stone. "He'll do more damage to himself tugging against those restraints. You should get him to take it easy."
Natasha, already outfitted in some of Sif's training gear, was beside him, similarly taking stock of the weaponry on display but for entirely different reasons. She didn't stop her work, but her ears lifted betraying her curiosity.
“T’Challa wears the Nehe stone. We can be sure that the Panther God is indeed with us.” She said, continuing after a breath. “The people of Wakanda see it as mystical, but those of us closest to the Queen know that the secret to its power lies not in the stone, but in the Queens who have worn it.
Tony snorted. Speak to them? The fel hadn't even turned to look at them, staring out over the throng of hunters preparing to go into the woods as if none of this was even happening.
"Don't you have to have a first husband before you can have a next husband?" Tony heard Peter ask in a thick Russian accent as the volume in the club lowered, the up beat music fading as the DJ started to yammer something at the crowd about slowing it down.
Natasha teased, and Tony felt a quick flash of embarrassment over their bond that belied Steve’s immediate response.
Eventually it would blow and he’d never forgive himself if it hurt the Pride in some way he could have avoided with simple honesty. And besides that, Steve had told Tony the truth even when it would have been easier not to. He’d done exactly as Tony had asked, trusted in what they had and Tony’s ability to handle the truth, and Tony would have to be the shittiest person alive to repay his trust with that kind of cowardice.
“There’s not going to be a next time, not if this is how we’re going to operate. If you don’t want to have children fine, that’s a discussion we can have together as a couple. I know you were scared and upset but you can’t just walk out when-”
pride. The first in centuries this side of the pacific and it's a pretty big deal. Fury wants his little team of superheros to stay fighting fit and government approved and Pepper keeps on insisting that Tony needs to smooze and garner new contracts for SI, so unfortunately there was no getting out of that nights event.
Tony thinks that’s a trap if he’s ever heard one. Nobody wants to hear a nine-year-olds real thoughts on religion and (non) existence of god.
“T-tony.” Steve sputtered and blinked like he was coming up for air, and Tony took it as a good sign. It was a less favorable one when he turned back to (not) Bucky and tried to plead with him. “His name is Tony. He’s Howard’s son. If you just tell me where you are he can help. I can find you.”
“And you don’t think you matter to me? Did it occur to you that protecting you matters more to me than just about anything right now? Natasha replied, her eyebrows crawling upward in disbelief as an edge of frustration crept into her tone. Her gaze cut towards Steve meaningfully as she growled, “And it’s not just you Tony, you know it isn’t. It’s everyone.”
They’d talked as they ate. Bruce had asked what he was working on, which had launched them into a long discussion on improving particle acceleration and it had hit Bruce, as he’d sat across the table from the enigmatic kat blinking sleepily at him, how much Tony must trust him, to invite someone like him into his home, to nearly fall asleep in his presence.
It was like watching someone slash the air from his tires, the way that the color slowly drained from Steve's face as he stood before Thor who stood before them both in his princely alien armor, his tone more grave and sure than any of them had ever heard it.
Ivan, who had taught her that she was more than an animal (who gave her books and who told her that she would never find a monster as terrifying as the one within her in the pages of one).
Thor wasn't gata. He was an alien from an alien planet however, and that was weird enough to earn him a spot on the team. And get this, the gata that populate Midgard aren't the first cat people he's come across.
“Ah! Friend Tony,” he greeted the smaller man as he turned, the boy Harley wobbling somewhat precariously from his perch on Thor’s wide shoulders. “You have come up from your forge. Young Harley and I are decorating for Yuletide. Though there is a sore lack of proper decorations to be had.”
But he needed to set the score. Tony needed time to think through the future when his life wasn’t being immediately threatened and he wasn’t a firework waiting to happen, but he was certain that whatever path he chose it was going to be on his terms. No more playing by Fury’s rules.
Cautiously Tony began poking at it, decoding the encryption to find the messages origins. He relaxed when the puzzle unraveled without much resistance, leading back to a very familiar ship and her interface.
“How did Robert enjoy prison?” Tony asked, knowing that it was likely to bring a smile to her face. And sure enough.
Sighing Tony stopped what he was doing on the counter, setting down the pot and the cup of coffee he’d been pouring with a thunk.
They come in two genders: Fels and Toms. Which is really rather simple, except that humans like to fuck everything up by trying to view foreign constructs under a human microscope.
“This would be the doctor who is actually a Prince whose credentials were probably made up by some SHIELD intern?” Tony asked incredulously, not because he didn’t think T’Challa was off base but because Steve was the last person he’d expected to side with him. He and T’Challa were barely civil to one another and the reason why wasn’t the sort of thing toms usually found it easy to be reasonable about.
Luke, whose attention hadn’t already been on Thor for some reason, whipped his head around, his arm falling nosily to the table as he stared at the blond Asgardian with a surprised expression edging toward disbelief.
She'd been giving him the tour when Tony had finally appeared, and it was only when Clint had felt the first spark of their minds connecting and that pull, that he'd finally realized why Fury had chosen him for this gig instead of Natasha.
“It’s not a ghostly past. It’s the actual past, which means our presence here could be changing things.” He reminded her with the expression she was pretty sure he’d copied tick for tick from his parents. How to deal with irreverent Starks, Super Soldier addition.
“I know what that name means to you, and we don’t have to. Use it I mean, really, the important thing is the paper trail. The rest of us can get by with some surface work but if Uncle Tony goes digging, and you know he will, your cover needs to be as tight as we can make it.”
"Blood alone does not make a Queen." The woman sneered but before Tony could even finish opening his mouth (to say fuck this, because he was so done with this) she went on. "Queen Anthony, if you believe your hunters are up to the task, you and your Consort bring me the feathers of the Benu. If you can do this without the aid of the Prince of Asgard I shall consider it proof enough of your worthiness."
The scent of pepper assaulted Tony’s nose and his whiskers twitched. God the testosterone was so thick in this room he could bottle it up and make money off it. Stupid a la toms. Tony caught Natasha’s eye and rolled his back into his skull. He couldn’t see it but he felt her smile.
“Is it really so hard to believe after the way your husband yanked my chain that I’d have any qualms about showing the world that he has a taste for underage girls?”
The assassin turned quickly to meet the new threat and dived low to avoid the energy blast from the Nakia’s dagger, coming up from her roll with her widow-bites at the ready; but Nakia was fast, leaping over Natasha to land a few feet behind her once more and whirling just in time to deflect Natasha’s fire with an effortless whirl of her blade like some sort of samurai and pushing and pressing forward with a bright toothy grin.
Besides. It wasn't even true. A woman like Natasha didn't choose to die for a shitty replacement and his friendship with Bruce meant more than anything else Tony could buy or give him (even control over a monster he feared). Two out of five wasn't perfect, but it was a start and he was damn well gonna take it.
"No, Tony not for that... I don't think I've been a good friend to you." Bruce pushed a hand through his hair and sighed, looking tired but soldiering himself up despite it. "I know you don't like hearing thank you, but I don't know if you understand what it meant to me, everything you've done. Giving me a place of my own and a lab in your tower..."
Devi always brings silks and spices from India with him on his boat. He's impressed with how quickly Tony is picking up Hindi. Each time he comes to port he brings Tony new words and new stories about India.
“Look guys. Billy’s powers are still developing, this isn’t on him. We all saw what it did to Aunt Wanda to teleport us out of here the first time. That’s why we built the device in the first place. If he’d had more time, I’m sure that other Tony Stark would have figured out a way to perfect it. But there wasn’t time.” She said. “Well now we have all the time in the world.”
A hearty cheer went up from the guests gathered below, because apparently watching someone get knocked on their ass was just considered good entertainment.
Tony ventured into the kitchen late the next morning, yanked from the fitful sleep he’d dropped into during the early part of the morning before the sun had risen. He’d spent the night digging through the files on the trucking company Natasha had traced the vehicle parts back to. JARVIS was a big help but even so, without much to narrow their search window they were forced to weed through the company’s financial records from the last ten years, hoping to spot something helpful.
Then there’s the fact that Rogers is just sickeningly sweet and in the face of such wholesomeness there’s no helping how Tony just softens. Steve’s the kind of guy who thinks about you just because, and thinks of thoughtful shit to do for you just because he happened to be thinking about you.
Phil sniffled loudly, mewling pathetically as his head drooped and Nyota started out of her memories, wincing at the gloomy pallor that had taken over the table. Some Queen she was turning out to be. She was supposed to be lifting everybody up.
The kit blushes, eyes flying furtively to the kat who doesn’t belong, who has arched one neat eyebrow and gone stiff. It's not polite to talk about a kat's heat but everybody knows what Mr. Allen means by 'get together'.  Mrs. Finnegan, who is still looking at the bread case gives him a slow eyed look, considering.
It was the best Tony could do at an apology he didn't want to make when he wasn't any good at apologies to begin with. He was better with actions. He'd make it up to them with upgrades or in Natasha's case actually coming through with the laser knife. Wouldn't that technically be a light saber? Whatever, he was totally going to make her a light saber.
Tony whipped his head around owlishly, counting his teammates one by one and having to start over again when he started counting stone steps instead; because there were so many in the tower and so expertly constructed. Good job Asgardians. He wasn't an architect in title but architecture and engineering went hand in hand often enough it was like a.... like a good date really. Always showed you a good time and let you come first.
“Tony. Tony look at me.” Bruce grabbed Tony’s face and tapped his cheek until Tony’s eyes focused on him. “I’ve got to stay with Steve, alright, but you’re burned. You need to let these people help you. They are friends. Let them help.”
“When I was little he’d have these episodes.” She went on, a slight distance in her eyes even though her tone stayed slow and measured. “My cousins and I would get scared, but the adults would help calm him, and when it was safe my cousins and I would all sleep curled up in the big bed with him. He said just having us there was healing. When I got old enough to start studying the way our brains work, I realized he wasn’t just making us feel useful, and I knew then, I wanted to understand how to help other Gata the way my family helped him.”
"He's not interested. I think you'd better leave." Steve commanded in that 'Captain America says so' way of his that no one dared argue with, which meant Tony always felt he had to on principle.
“I want to help him. Whether or not he can tell us anything more about the mercenaries he fought, if he’s in some kind of trouble I want to help.” Tony explained. “I know Norman Osborn. He’s ruthless. He wouldn’t pay for a kit to go to school unless there was something he expected to get out of it.  It doesn’t sit right, leaving a kit at his mercy. Super-powered or not.”
She wondered where Teddy was but knew she’d never be able to find him now. She can feel the way T’Cael is trembling and wonders if they’ll feel it when that fireball consumes them.
"Maybe I'm just popular?" Tony replied in a bored tone, examining his nails with a lazy flick of his tail. Fury was going to have to get some way better material if he was hoping to get a rise out of Tony this time.
It started before Howard Stark, before Captain America and Project Rebirth, with that afore mentioned ancient civilization. Probably a few of them if we're being exact here, but it's the Egyptians that everyone remembers.
The car rocked as something slammed into its right side, pushing it squealing across the lane toward the rock face of the mountain.
“No. You must stop thinking of yourself as someone expendable Tony. You are possibly the least expendable person in the universe just as you are, but as a Queen you are the heart and soul of the bond that connects us all. And there is nothing temporal or easily set aside about it. To have that heart taken away is devastating to a Pride.” The tom warned with gravity and Tony swallowed as he leaned closer across the table, his hand reaching for Tony’s.
“Yes. It is from a plant native to my country, known for its soothing properties.” Tony watched as he crumbled several of the dried leaves and dropped them into the mug, then reached for the pot and poured the heated water over it without burning himself or spilling a drop.
He’d barely been able to eat or sleep the days before and Uncle Ben had teased him, asking Peter if he knew what he would say to his crush when he met him. Which had made Peter blush and groan that crushes were gross.
Tony sics his lawyers on AIM and Viastone and meets Harley's mom. There's a cat-costumed vigilante hanging around that SHIELD seems curiously unconcerned with and a certain medic keeps popping up to be annoying observant and kind of amusing. Meanwhile Tony's struggles to stabilize extremis lead Thor to suggest a trip off planet to commune with the cat goddess herself. In other words, welcome to the Thor flavored chapters. Magical shenanigans ensue.
The words echoed inside his head. Wasn’t that what Tony had been telling himself from the beginning? That someone like Steve just wasn’t for a guy like him.
When he stepped outside to face the rest of the unit standing beside their signature black trucks with guns raised, there was blood splattered on his cheek. He wiped it away without taking his gaze away from Killian standing in the center of his men.
“Actually, that’s my plan for Thor but we’re going to have company and I’m going to need you to cover Bruce, okay?” When Steve didn’t immediately acknowledge, Tony sighed. “Steve if you’re mad about the call we can talk about it, later, right now I gotta know you have my back.”
She didn’t say what was looming in the back of her mind. They’d had the help of earth 1204’s T’Challa and some of the leading minds in Wakanda and they’d still not perfected the device. Maybe with more time they would have, but they’d run out of it, and now it was left to the twelve of them. And as Jaime had already pointed out. They were just children. She could feel Jaime staring at her from across the table. He probably knew what she was thinking.
That was the crux of the problem. It sucked admitting when you were in over your head, when you were out of all other options but one. But Papa had taught her never to back down, and not to be afraid. Even when you saw the end. Especially when you saw the end.
team, and Tony wasn’t about to give him up just because of an old bond forged in childhood. Natasha had loved Ivan but she'd still chosen him!
Just because Tony thought it was possible didn’t mean opening his mind up to the web was anything he had any sort of practice with or knew of any precedent for. This shit was literally developing in his head as he went along.
Natasha did hesitate (she looked at the bright red apple held in the cradle of his hands and she knew what it promised). She hesitated, but only for a moment.
