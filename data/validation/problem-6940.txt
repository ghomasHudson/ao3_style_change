“Okay, fine. But I’m sticking around for safety concerns.” He smiled at Tony who grabbed his hand to pull him inward for a hug. Steve let Tony hug him before the latter broke away to run toward the robot with Peter.
Obadiah waved with a fake smile as he listened to his caller. “…it’s a minor setback. If we get the device, then we’ll be able to move forward…besides—” At this point, a Stark Industries’ investor had past Obadiah on his way into the building. Obadiah paused to acknowledge the man.
“If I don’t have anything to look forward to then I won’t be disappointed in the end.” He had tried for his answer to sound like a joke, but it was obvious that Bruce hadn’t appreciated the effort.
Steve opened his mouth to respond, but he couldn’t. After a moment of trying to prevent himself from unleashing on Bruce everything that had happened between him and Tony since they started speaking again, Steve only nodded.
Tony shook his head, recoiling as Steve continued toward him. “I couldn’t even keep my hands to myself now…I was trying to be careful in the beginning, to let you know it wasn’t just about sex, but I can’t even do that right…”
“I need some advice.” Tony immediately asked as soon as they were alone, his voice lowering. He didn’t need to soften his voice, but he was paranoid that someone might be hanging around outside the room.
Steve jumped in after Tony and strapped in. He could feel his heart pounding out of his chest, but it was a good feeling. He looked over at Tony who winked at him before putting his sunglasses on. His lab partner then ginned before pressing a few buttons on the console. The helicopter jerked a little as Tony easily maneuvered the controls, immediately impressing Steve.
Rhodey motioned with his glass toward a group of investors swarming Steve and Obadiah. “So, I can’t get into specifics…” He leaned inward so that no one could hear their conversation.
As he met Tony at the door, Steve watched Tony press an ear against the wood, listening. Steve inched closer, hearing muffled crying through the door. Both Steve and Tony glanced at each other; Tony shook his head with a sigh as he slowly opened the door, finding Peter sitting up in his bed crying.
Tony chuckled as he moved the drawings of Peter and Ned’s robot to his bedside table so Steve could get more room to lie down completely flat in the bed.
Tony chuckled. He ran a hand through his hair a few times before yawning loudly. “Well, don’t run off too quickly. Why don’t you stay for breakfast? I can make you an omelet. Peter’s aunt will probably drop him off around noon.”
Fury looked at Steve, crossing his arms. “I didn’t say anything to you all when I had the hunch because I was pretty sure there was one last person involved…Loki finally fessed up whoever contacted him in the first place and let him back into Stark Tower the day of the lab explosion.”
Steve smiled, but then he leaned back into the couch, still looking very much upset with the situation.
Steve nodded again, waiting before following Tony into the kitchen, keeping himself at a distance. Tony rummaged through the space, looking through what T’Challa’s resort staff had provided in the suites.
“…I, uh, meant to tell you last weekend…but, uh,” Tony ran a hand through his hair, “…I have to go out there to appraise some shit…or whatever…” He then crossed both arms before waving a hand around. He was sure he looked uncomfortable.
“Well…,” Steve started as he studied the sequences before looking over at Tony who was grinning at him, “I’m not entirely sure, but I think the sequence you chose Peter probably works best.”
Steve laughed as he kissed Tony once more. They held onto each other, squeezing the other tightly as their hands roamed along each other’s bodies.
Steve laughed as they watched the lights on the robot twinkle for a moment. Peter tapped again on the tablet.
Tony let go of Steve to walk closer toward the desk. Lupho stood in place much like the statutory in the room, barely giving Tony some space as he approached.
Tony removed one of his hands from Steve’s ass as he slowly traced his backside and neck before settling on gently stroking Steve’s face as they continued to hump each other. Steve wrapped a hand around Tony’s shoulder; he held on tightly as he used the other hand to hold his body at another angle. The shift in the angle elicited a sharp moan from Tony who used his legs to hug Steve’s body close against his own. He pushed upward into Steve’s body in time with him pushing downward. Tony groaned as he could feel both of their cocks growing harder with each thrust.
“…I’m really sorry, Tony…” Pepper began, casting her eyes downward, “I didn’t know he received an invitation…”
Steve laughed, now running a hand through Tony’s hair. “Yeah, I was supposed to get rid of it when Synergy first closed down…”
Tony hadn’t seen Steve since leaving the reception early. He had also been working mostly at Stark Industries after work hours to avoid seeing Steve at Stark Enterprises as the team finished up the last round of safeguards on the Synergy device.
Tony sat up straight in his chair, pointing angrily at the test marked with an “F”. “And this was a few days ago? Why didn’t anyone call us?” His voice raised a little. Steve reached over and rubbed his leg to calm him down.
“Wr400COS, delph23, epsilon2TAG…” J.A.R.V.I.S. began reading a series of random numbers and functions, but they had no logical order that Tony could understand right away.
Tony returned the laughter as he waved a hand around. “One time, when I was in high school, I had this experiment running in this room…”
Steve’s body jerked upward into Tony’s mouth as he entered. Tony grinned, holding Steve down with one hand while using the other to stroke him slowly as he licked him. Tony looked upward at Steve who had his eyes closed, moaning with Tony’s every movement.
Soon enough the table read came. Steve was immensely nervous about meeting the cast. He was used to big productions and overpaid stars, but these were different. These people were cultural, smart. Academy quality. Steve didn't think of himself as a lesser actor, but he had to admit the names on the payroll left him awestruck. Not only Natasha Romanoff was doing the lead but Carol told him James Rhodes was also doing a secondary character. She had pulled every trick she had to assemble the best cast possible. That left Steve dizzy, unbelieving how his name was on the top three.
They were waiting for Carol and Pepper at a fancy dinner. The typical LA place with the fashionable designed chairs and round white tables. There were plants and modern art everywhere. Tony was glad he was rich, because there was no way someone normal could afford even a cup of tea here.
He slowly got himself out of the bed. On foot at the time. He couldn't remember exactly what he had to drink yesterday, but apparently it was strong. His apartment was huge. Usually he loved it. But right now, thinking about how the buzzer was placed all the way back in the kitchen, he sort of wished he wasn't a pretentious douchebag. The walk felt eternal.
"Oh I'm sure it has promise," said Killian, interrupting her. Pepper frowned a bit, but didn't respond. "In fact, I think it will be a great success. That's why we got involved. That's why he can't touch it."
Tony's head still hurt. He ached for a glass of wine more than anything. But that was the exact opposite of what he needed right now.
“Tony...” she whispered, getting closer to him. Steve couldn't see her expression from this angle and didn't manage to understand much else of what followed.
"Look, I feel like we got of on the wrong foot," he said, trying to be as polite as possible. “So we should just start over. What do you say?
Thank you all for your kind comments, it made me incredibly happy you guys. I'll be posting again next Saturday!! Really excited for you to see what comes next
Killian made a long, dramatic sigh. He then watched every woman individually, calculating his next move.
Steve nodded, pleased. Nat was a graceful actress, always finding herself in different roles. She had an eye for good movie scripts and had starred in Sunset. Steve had a really good feeling about this film.
Tony shifted, uncomfortable. Killian was looking at him again. Staring. He was told not to respond to any provocation, so he stayed quiet.
"I am the world's best agent," said Jan, opening the door with a bang. Tony settled down in his comfy oversized couch and just muttered a weak "Hi Jan."
"So, Stark. You've been around the longest. Any advice for the new guy?" Steve asked him, offering a kind smile.
The table became quiet. Tony knew Carol was a fierce director and he suspected she would have asked for full control. But seeing her act so fierce in person made him shiver. He felt humbled. These talented, professional women were risking everything just to work with him. Tony hadn't felt special in years. He was starting to now.
"No, she's really in it. I bumped into her at the coffee shop. You know the one right by Boulevard 3rd? Well she said she was very happy about it and looking for a high profile actor to play one of the leads. And I said your name!" she was practically yelling at this point, eyes huge with excitement.
"Steve, you look flustered. Have you been reading about yourself again?" teased Sam while he took a seat in front of him.
They were going to shoot for about 9-11 weeks on Scotland. It was a good enough Roman look alike with the best accessibility. Tony would fly in on the summer and start filming right away. There was already a script so Carol told him a little about the plot. It was about a community set in Pompeii the day the volcano erupted. She didn't want flashy effects or big scenes of chaos, she wanted to explore the human condition in that situation of crisis. Tony would be the one of the three protagonists, a man who lost his family before the movie took place.
"Seriously I cannot stress how much you're gonna owe me for this," she yelled over the sound of the coffee machine. "I'm talking huge Christmas bonus level."
"So, you're familiar with Carol Danvers' work, right?" she asked, appearing again at the living's door frame."I think you've met her, in fact."
Miss Potts then called them all to their places. The cast wasn't so big, maybe around 15 or 20 people. They sat down on their correspondent chairs. The one beside Steve was empty and read with big black letters “Tony Stark”.
"Yeah, yeah I did. At that after party for Nat's film. She's really cool," said Tony, scratching his head.
"Lighten up Stevie, what's your problem? You're gonna be working alongside an Oscar nominee. That's way above your usual standards..." said Bucky, hopping on the kitchen counter.
“Well you know what they say. Talent keeps you young,” he answered, winking at her, “though I’m sure you already know.”
Steve crossed his arms. He needed this. He needed a good, serious movie to prove his worth. He was tired of being type casted into bad roles. He was more than a beefy action star. But if Tony Stark ruined the shoot he would lose his chance.
"I'm sure you've read the movie's pitch. Carol has a great vision and has asked for only the best," started Pepper. Right to it. That was her style. "Which is why I'm here. I can assure you, this picture has a lot of promise. The expected-"
A compromise. That was a sign of victory. For the first time since he set foot on the dinner, Tony allowed himself to relax. Maybe things would work out.
20 seconds passed and the buzzer still rang throughout all the apartment. His plan was failing. For a moment he thought that sound just might kill him. Oddly, the thought seemed funny. The great Tony Stark, movie star and Hollywood’s eternal playboy, found dead at 37 because of a stupid alarm.
Jan had been his manager since he switched companies, a little after Delusion. He was being screwed over, treated like a child and in some cases, even harassed. Everyone wanted to represent America’s most promising actor, even if they hated him. Jan was different. She was a friend. He met her in a four week long cruise through Brazil and they clicked instantly. Tony hated the cooperative approach of his former agent and Jan understood that instantly. Stane always searched for the biggest paycheck, begging him to do more commercials and brand endorsements than actual roles. Jan tried to offer him projects she knew he would like, not only cell phone deals.
"Miss Danvers, I know you mean well. Stark is a hot, charismatic guy, so he seems like a good choice. But you're new to this industry. You don't know what is like to work with overpaid stars with alcoholic tendencies," deadpanned Killian, looking straight into Carol's eyes.
"Then what is it? You're nervous about not being the only guy with lines on the film?" he interrupted again, looking away.
“Some sort of retelling of a Roman tragedy. I'm not sure yet, but they’re gonna shoot it in Europe. And guess who’s producing it?”
“Miss Romanoff. It’s truly an honor to meet you,” said Steve trying to compose himself. He was used to dealing with famous people. He was one of them. But it never grew old, meeting new ones. The feeling of pure giddiness never disappeared.
Most of the time, he was aware of the dream. He could control everything. Make his feet run a thousand miles per hour or just stretch his arms and fly. That’s why the hard, angry sound felt so out of place. Tony tried to wish it away, but it just got stronger, ripping through the fabric of his reality.
He woke up alarmed, all at once. The apartment buzzer was ringing without pause. He groaned and tried to ignore it. His head was killing him.
“Steve here was telling me he didn’t read the script,” Nat called him out, amused. “Seems to like the freshness of the first time.”
Tony looked away. They were right. He used to prance around Hollywood not giving a fuck about anything. But that had gotten him fired, beaten up, drunk and worst of all, expelled from the industry. So if this was his big comeback, he needed to put the effort in it.
The more Carol spoke about it, the more he wanted to work with her. His character would have to go through some rough times and it was up to Tony how could he interpret that. He was a very ad lib performer, he felt more comfortable when he could bend some of the lines. Scripts felt too constricted, too narrow. Tony loved to get into character and really get into the man's head. He had had a lot of problems in the past for this, a lot of proud directors telling him to cut the shit and say the lines, almost like an automaton. Carol liked to see what her actors had to offer. Tony felt this partnership could really work.
Killian kept quiet, hearing Carol's words with undivided attention. She took it as a sign to continue.
"Is not like you're gonna have a girl up here," mumbled Bucky with his mouth full. Steve glared at him.
"What brings you guys here so early?" asked Steve, watching with disgust how Bucky devoured the eggs.
Steve wasn't a arrogant man. He was simple. He lived in the same house as always, drove the same car as always and ate pretty much the same meals. But he took pride in his work. At least, in the good parts of his work.
Tony Stark losing his head, slowly, on camera. It was sad yet with a few flickers of hope. Steve though it was an honest movie. Without the in your face morals of today's flicks.
The table read was held at a big conference room in Vine Street, a few blocks away from the studios. Steve wore comfortable black jeans and a nice dress shirt. Better be looking good at least.
Tony was a good actor. Scratch that, he was a great actor. He could pretend to be smitten by this arrogant guy with his condescending demeanor.
Steve hummed and turned on the hot water. His mind went to all the range he could show in this movie. A drama. He never acted in a full out drama. Only in action pieces with dramatic explosions.
"Ladies, there's no need to get emotional. Ms Danvers, we knew you were something special. A feisty little woman," he said with a stone cold voice. "Perhaps we can come to a compromise."
"Oh please, I'm nothing without a good team. And this team right here is the best you can ask for," he said, smiling wide and bright.
“I will,” he said, trying his best to sound earnest. “I promise. No alcohol, no dicking around, no pissing of studio representatives. I’ll be on my A game. You can count on me.”
Natasha asked for a table and they settled in a corner booth. Just the main cast had gotten out and Steve was glad for it. Carol and Pepper were great, but they were their bosses. He wanted to get to know his coworkers without that pressure.
"Yeah but you can't seem too eager Steve. We have to fight for your paycheck you know," said Sam, shaking his head. Steve growled, frustrated. They always played around with him.
He stood up, following the rest. He went to chat with James Rhodes who he was excited to meet. While he introduced himself, he saw how Stark made a straight line to the door. Before he could make it, Natasha stopped him. Steve didn't wanted to eavesdrop, but he couldn't help hearing their hushed voices.
Only every part of the legend seemed true now. Stark was wearing dark sunglasses and holding onto a large Starbucks cup. With messy hair and a long sweater, he looked straight out of bed. He took short, rapid steps and circled the table, mumbling some apologies. He then sat unceremoniously beside Steve and crossed his arms, laying back on his chair .
Steve watched as Tony’s character, Bruce, gave his last lines just as the sun came up. He wiped the few tears he shed and got up. He might as well get ready.
"Well, tell me more about this movie then. What is it about?" said Steve, getting up to clean the dishes. He couldn't be sitting anymore, he was too anxious to keep still.
Pepper was undoubtedly one of the best producers Tony has ever worked with. Hell, she was probably on of the best producers ever. She was professional, hardworking and took no shit from anyone. The set was always impeccable and she made sure everyone was on their top game. They had started on a rough patch way back in 04’, with Tony’s first blockbuster movie Countdown. But after a few beers and a mutual understanding, they started working like a clock machine. They also started sleeping together. She got him in check and even managed to keep him sober most of the production. Tony’s best works had been with her. They were a great team, made six movies together. But after Tony fell out of Hollywood’s approval they had a big fight that ended their partnership, professional and otherwise. They were on good terms now, but things were different. She was on the cusp of her career, landing better and better jobs. He was thoroughly unemployed.
"Well, that would've been useful a few years ago," he joked, making the tension disappear. Everyone laughed but Stark, who looked like he rather be swallowing acid than being im Steve's presence.
“I'm sorry, Mr Stark isn't available at the moment. Please be gone,” he spoke to the machine. His voice was rougher than he expected. The tiny screen showed a pretty woman with the most eccentric yellow dress he’d seen. Jan.
"If the studio's concern is about the movie's targeting, we can come with a solution," said Pepper, probably having already thought about this scenario. "Mr Stark has a… strong reputation. We need someone to work alongside him who can counteract that reputation. There's still one of the main characters that hasn't been cast."
The other man was distant throughout the whole read. He looked at the ceiling whenever Steve read and seemed bored if he took too long. His lines were said beautifully, but as soon as he closed his mouth he shut off. He would fall back on his seat and wait without paying attention to anyone else.
The representative arrived at exactly six p.m., two hours after Tony met with Pepper and Carol. He was a tall (so tall) handsome man around Tony's age. Dressed in a smart, black suit. The whole image yelled expensive.
But lately they haven't had much luck. After Tony’s 7th drunken scandal 5 years ago, no self respecting director wanted him near them. He could only get small cameos and guest star appearances. It was driving him mad. Granted, with all the money he made in his twenties he could live out his life without working a single day more. But Tony loved acting, loved keeping his mind busy. Not working meant not acting and that lead to hours of boredom and in most cases, alcohol.
Los Angeles in the afternoon was a busy place. The chilly air swifted through Steve's collar making him wish he had a scarf. They walked about three blocks until the found a small coffee shop with a somewhat guaranteed privacy. Well, as guaranteed as privacy could be in LA.
Stark sighed and took off his glasses to rub his eyes. When he looked up, he caught Steve staring at him. He looked tired. The dark circles around his eyes made him appear sleepless. Steve looked away quickly, embarrassed. The only thought that he had besides shame was that Stark’s eyes were more beautiful in person.
"Oh I can ask for a little bit more," said Killian, following it with a sharp laugh. The women besides him laughed too, dissipating the tension. Tony closed his mouth tight. Nothing he could said would benefit him.
"She is, but she wants to make this big period piece so she needs the money," she said, nursing her cup and not quite drinking it. "Which is why she partnered up with Paramount.”
“Carol! Hi, darling" he greeted her, standing up when the two women arrived. Carol was dressed lovely but simple as always, with clear jeans and a long dress shirt. He gave her a soft peck on the cheek and turned to Pepper, who was rocking a soft pink suit that made her eyes pop. “Pep my love, always a pleasure.”
"I thought she was more into the indie scene," he responded, drinking half the cup in one go. He had two needs in this life: coffee and attention.
"I'm gonna make myself very clear. I'm here to make a movie. Not to hold your hand and praise your poor choices of delivery," Tony said, spitting every word. "Don't think for even a second that you're anything but an audience-friendly eye candy. Everyone knows where the real talent lays and it's certainly not with the guy that played Captain America five times."
Carol laughed at him. She wasn’t so used to his relaxed persona as Pepper and Jan were. Tony liked her. He could keep the asshole attitude in check by now.
She introduced Steve to the executive producer, Happy Hogan, and a few of the cast members. He recognized some from Carol’s early movies. They seemed to get along quite well, Carol must’ve kept them close for that reason.
"I'm gonna be honest with you," he said, staring at Carol again. Maybe he thought she was the weak link. "Paramount pictures can't be the face of a celebrity scandal. This movie will never be household friendly if Tony Stark is the main character. People may like his movies, but they sure as hell don't like him."
“Oh please, call me Nat,” she said, laughing. “We’re gonna be seeing each other covered in sweat and dirt soon enough, so we might as well get familiar.”
"Those motherfucking assholes love to be a pain in my ass. Shit!" he sweared, setting the cup on a table with a plum.
What was his problem? Steve hadn't been anything but nice to him. He could look past the cold stares and the general disinterest, but they had to work together. To have some sort of bond. Their characters were supposed to be best friends! How could he portray that if the man didn't talk to him?
Jan took out her coat and threw it at the table amongst her bag. Then, as if she owned the place, went straight the the kitchen.
Steve almost broke the plate he was washing. Tony Stark? The Tony Stark? He haven't heard about Stark since the 2014 scandal. He had been the most promising actor of their generation but threw it all away for booze and fame. Steve never liked the guy. Sure, he grew up watching his movies. He cried with Countdown and A father's tale. But he also saw the news, read the articles. Stark was unpredictable, unstable. He wasn't a reliable work partner.
They ordered some coffee and a few biscuits. Jan had told him about the meeting in the car. They were supposed to meet first with Carol and Pepper to plan the attack on the studio’s agent, who was going to come in after. Carol seemed firmly decided that she wanted Tony for the role. She explained that the character was this bigger than life merchant with a kind heart but a shit ton of flaws. Tony had that easy, confident charm that was surely going to bring nuance to the character. The only problem was that the studio had told her no.
"Have they cast anyone else?" asked Steve. If he was hand-picked it meant Carol had a pretty good idea of the direction she wanted to go with. The rest of the cast could already be on board.
Steve had an addiction. He loved reading about himself. So there he was, checking out his name in Google News to see if someone had thought about him. It was a peaceful morning, the sun was shining with quiet modesty and the kitchen window let in some white noise from the street. Steve was content. And then he heard the apartment's door open.
"What did she say?" he asked, trying to keep his tone in check. Pepper wouldn't let their past relationship damage the movie. The question was if she thought Tony would damage it or not.
But there was one person that increasingly made him uncomfortable. Stark spoke only to Natasha and Rhodes and glared at Steve everytime he tried to stir the conversation his way.
Pepper Potts received him as soon as he opened the door. She was a tall, beautiful women with a strong pose. Ever since he got into the industry he heard a lot about Potts. She was the kind of boss you would dream of having, but never dared disappointing. She took no bullshit.
Then, inevitably, he watched Countdown. Tony Stark’s masterpiece. The movie that marked him as a legend all those years ago. It was as raw and emotional as Steve remembered it. Stark had an ability to act with his whole body, putting grace and charm into every motion. But what knocked it out of the park were his eyes. Those huge, round eyes had mastered every microexpression to form a truly breathtaking performance. Countdown had been a showstopper when it first came out. A tale about a man dealing with addiction in the late 70’s. It had
"Mr Stark is a three times Academy Awards nominee. He is loved by the public and critics alike," jumped Jan to his defense, words flowing effortlessly like a sales pitch. "He can make any movie be memorable and that is what Paramount should be focusing on."
Tony had had it. Opened his mouth to say whatever insult his mind could conjure but Carol rapidly spoke over him.
Stark turned his head to look at him. Or at least, Steve thought he was looking at him. He couldn't see his eyes behind the sunglasses. Then, Stark looked ahead and sighed.
Jan hummed and went back to the kitchen. Carol Danvers was a young director, but she had a lot of promise. Her movies were inspired and creative, always bringing something new to the picture. Natasha had introduced them after the premier of their latest movie, Sunsent, a small but delightful film they did together. Tony wasn't too drunk at the party and he ended up having a great time with Carol. She was smart and witty, they played really well off each other. She respected him but didn't allow him to walk all over her. He liked her.
"I'm flattered, but Scott Lang is a comedy actor. He doesn't have the range," said Carol with a polite smile. "This character is witty, emotional, impulsive and kind of a jackass. Who best to play it if not for Mr Stark?" she said with a little laugh.
"Okay okay..." said Bucky, putting down the fork and composing himself. "First you have to say we are the best managers slash lawyers slash agents slash friends in the world."
"Well she's doing a big job now. I'm talking huge numbers," said Jan, returning finally with two cups of coffee. She placed one in Tony's hands, which he was grateful for. Then, she layed back on the opposite end of the couch.
The table fell silent, with Tony’s gaze still on Steve. It was an unnecessarily rude comment, but Steve could let it fly.
Tony groaned loudly and fell back into the couch. It was always the same. Someone really wanted to work with him but for one reason or another, he was vetoed. He hated big commercial studios for this exact reason. They were more concerned about their image and box revenue than actually making art. They had discarded Tony as "extremely difficult to work with" five years ago and he couldn't get a decent job since.
Twenty heads turned around to see how Tony Stark entered the room. Steve felt immediately starstruck again. Sure, he might think the guy was an unprofessional asshole, but this was Tony Stark. He was one of the best actors of his generation. And he was walking towards him. The legend in the flesh.
"Hey, Stark!" he called after they all left he cafe and said goodbye. "Can you hold on a minute? I'd like to talk."
“Tony! Let me in. I have something big to tell you,” tiny Jan said, her enthusiasm palpable even though the mechanic filter.
Steve felt enraged. He wasn't going to allow this arrogant asshole talk to him like that. He was trying to make peace with the guy and in response he just snapped. Fine. So be it. Steve could stop playing nice for a change.
"No, more like- what's your problem?" asked Steve, irritated. Stark laughed and shook his head. They were still standing on the street and it was getting late. Steve felt tired, he hadn't slept a thing.
“We’re going to grab a cup of coffee with the guys. It’s good for the morale,” she said patting his arm.
“To the café around the corner. Carol wants us to get along," he said, nodding towards Stark, "to play nice, you know?"
“Yeah, no skipping the gym for this one,” said Nat, shaking her head with a smile. “I take it that you haven’t read the script yet?”
But Steve not only focused on his character. Felix was a foreigner who wandered into Pompeii a year before the eruption. The man who opened his arms at him was Stark’s character, Maximus. They quickly became friends and that relationship was the emotional core of final act, where the three protagonists would have to escape the fire. Steve looked at Stark and wondered if they would ever be able to portray something like that.
"Aldrich," intervened Pepper, voice strong." I can assure you Mr Stark is a professional, besides what tabloids may say. I can vouch for him." Tony gave her a quiet smile. Pepper always had his back, even way back when he might have not deserved it.
He hadn’t been able to sleep the night before. He fumbled around in bed, trying every position imaginable to get himself to relax. But nothing worked. So, ever the fanboy, he pulled out his laptop and started watching his co-stars' films. Sunset was a simple yet powerful movie about a small town girl dealing with loss. Nat had really nailed the emotional bits in that one. Steve remembered seeing it a few months before, but now that he knew the same person was going to direct him he shivered. Carol was very talented.
Tony smirked as he crossed his arms. “The picture I have of you is almost complete. You’re innocent on the outside, but a little dangerous on the inside, right?” He continued to grin at Steve who seemed to be playing along.
Tony acknowledged the interloper before glancing upward at Steve; he smiled. “I gotta go…” he whispered, making a move to walk away from Steve, but now holding on to his hand.
“Are you asking me to attend your graduation, Rogers?” Tony smirked. His hand, which was now on Steve’s shoulder, tightened with every step.
Steve inhaled once more before shuddering; he gasped a quiet and unexpected “shit” before convulsing on top of Tony. Tony, after hearing Steve swear while coming, couldn’t help himself as he let go.
Strange exited the car, and Steve and Tony followed him to enter the park. “If we don’t do something soon, I’m afraid it’ll get even worse. Who knows how many others have contracted this virus and are unaware.”
“Is that even a good idea? I don’t know what you said to him, but Steve’s a fucking mess. I’ve never seen him
“If you let something like this bother you, the rest of your life will be even more difficult. Trust me.” Tony continued with his back facing Steve.
Steve crossed his arms, still expressing his confusion with Tony’s statement. Tony backed away again almost up against the elevator, now angry with himself for bringing up Sharon again when he and Steve were trying to repair some semblance of a relationship.
Steve unzipped his pants before helping Tony with his, removing both their shirts. Steve laid down on Tony, feeling his chest with both hands as he kissed Tony’s neck. Tony moaned as he squeezed Steve’s ass, spreading his cheeks a bit to rub him.
Tony laughed back. “I have noticed it, but…honestly…and this might sound silly given the situation…that’s one of the things I appreciate about you, Steve…you’re just trying to be helpful…”
Tony looked out the window in his office at Stark Industries, telling himself that he needed to do what he should have done a long time ago. His mind whirled before the inevitable knock at his door interrupted his mental entanglement. Tony turned as the door cracked open to reveal Steve.
Tony couldn’t stop his insides from turning in on themselves; of course Obadiah would do something so meddling and deceitful, especially after Tony officially disclosed his relationship with Steve to the executive committee.
Tony considered it before shaking his head quickly. “No, it’s okay. Remember, nothing out of the ordinary.” He cracked a worried smile that fell flat with Steve.
Steve nodded; he couldn’t believe how great it felt to be that close to Tony. He shuffled to lie halfway on top of Tony; he couldn’t stop his hands from roaming everywhere.
Bruce had to prevent himself from falling out of his chair. He took his time answering by readjusting his eyeglasses.
“Fuck it.” Tony let out as he walked over to pick up his phone. He tapped the call button to phone Steve.
Steve nodded before turning his head to kiss Tony. Tony kissed him back, slapping his ass again, kneading it with both hands before settling on Steve’s hips.
like?” Sam smirked. He placed Steve’s drawing to the side as he got up from the table to grab a beer from the fridge.
Bruce shuffled around before standing still. “…are you feeling any better…you know…from the party…?”
“I’m sorry he didn’t even say anything to you. I know he’s going through a lot, but he should have said something at least.” Bruce walked toward Steve before stopping short.
Steve breathed deeply, thinking quickly about how to salvage the conversation. “Tony, I care about you...you’re my friend.” He tried as he took a hold of Tony’s hands much like Tony had done before.
Steve nodded slowly, hanging his head as his expression changed, betraying that he knew what Tony was referring to.
Steve shook his head to regain his resolve; he had seen the helicopter before, but this time they weren’t on a tour. They were on their way to put the Synergy device into practical use.
Without responding verbally, as he was unsure what to say without spoiling the mood, Steve squeezed Tony through the hug. He felt a hand slide across his thigh, heightening his heart’s fluttering.
Steve felt weirder about the fact that there’s a photo of him and Tony clumsily talking to each other than anything else, but it would only be one of the many and probably forgotten soon.
Steve grimaced. “Mr. Beck? Tony, what are you talking about? The boys talk about him all the time. He’s their favorite teacher, remember?”
“…Mr. Stane? Your package is here…” The guard looked back up at the carrier who looked wholly unbothered by the entire situation, “…yep…okay…I’ll send him up with a guard…”
Tony gasped again as he felt Steve touch him. He wiggled, now trying to remove his pants. Steve stopped touching Tony to pull his pants off. He then unzipped his own pants, trying to remove them with ease as he had seen Tony done before, but he struggled to get out them, almost falling over on the bed.
The robot blinked an array of colors before straightening up in its restraints. Both Tony and Peter backed away about a foot or so, however, both were transfixed by the robot’s potential mobility. The robot rose from its restraints, rocking forward before turning its head side to side.
“Right away, Sir.” J.A.R.V.I.S. answered, “you have a meeting at 10am. Afterward is the board meeting. Following lunch, you have a phone call coming from the west coast with Ms. Potts. Mr. Parker will be home later this evening and his school report is due tomorrow.”
“Tony, I’m good. Promise.” Steve managed to mutter although he had the silliest grin on his face. Tony only responded by chuckling some more, keeping his hand firmly in place.
“Sorry about that.” Steve appeared about five minutes later, taking his time sitting down. He looked solemn, but not upset.
Pepper sighed before responding. Tony could tell she was trying to figure out the best thing to say.
“One of your team members was assaulted not too long ago. Did that have anything to do with Synergy?” One reporter managed to shout over the rest.
Tony contorted his face, steeped in suspicion. “That’s not exactly what I meant, and you know it…” He stopped himself, relaxing his face before trying again,” you didn’t have to kiss me…
Tony sighed again as he looked at Natasha. “Romanov, get Fury. He needs to hear this. Also tell him to just keep this between himself and the team.”
Steve nodded back, blushing now because of how confident Tony seemed to be in him. “Thanks, Tony. I really appreciate that.”
Thanos laughed to himself. “In the beginning, the point was to prove that Synergy was unstable, too unstable to justify your company, Mr. Stark, following through with a government contract. This allowed Mr. Stane to convince your board of such, thus delivering the device to me once the program was shut down,” he paused, “it
Tony waited for Pepper to reply before gathering his things on his desk. As he prepared to slip a document of an annotated image of vibranium into a folder he stopped to think about Steve sketching in the lab. Tony smiled as he inserted the image into the folder, still smiling as he zipped his bag before turning the lights off in his office.
“I’m going to take a shower,” he then turned to shoot Steve a conniving grin, “feel free to join me if you want.” He added with a wink before walking to the bathroom that was connected to the bedroom.
Ever since leaving the party, Steve had trouble trying to understand Tony’s actions. His behavior was erratic and too difficult to navigate without causing more problems. Steve knew Tony had issues when it came to relationships, but he found himself becoming less patient as time wore on. Thankfully, Sharon appeared unaware of the drama; they met up once more that weekend to peruse a farmer’s market before eating lunch, but all Steve could think about was Tony.
“Fucking figures. Obie’s a cad. He likes to stir shit up. You know that.” Tony shifted a bit but was clearly agitated by Obadiah’s antics.
Steve switched on the light to the master bathroom. He was starting to feel better; the first therapy session had turned out not to be too terrible and he could already feel his strength returning.
“Poor” would be a good way to put it. Look at the way he had treated Pepper and it hadn’t even dawned on him that he was being a terrible partner until it was too late. No, Bruce wouldn’t make a joke about this, especially since his friends knew he was trying to get back onto the dating scene with as little baggage as possible.
Steve let Tony pull his face to look at him directly. He told himself it wasn’t a big deal, finding it easier to do so from Tony’s energy. He nodded back to indicate that he understood.
Steve had called Tony that morning to see if he was free to grab coffee. And of course, Tony was both elated yet confused by the call. Dinner the night before had been really nice, so nice that it was easy to forget that he and Steve were no longer dating.
Fury clasped Tony’s shoulder. To Tony, it felt like the grip was on the verge of crushing it, but Fury only held on tightly. Even so, the feeling made Tony squirm.
“Since we know that the device can be easily manipulated, have your person proceed, but wait for further instructions.” Thanos coolly commanded.
started seeing each other…” Tony croaked out, rolling his eyes in the process. Steve nodded; he was close enough to Tony’s neck so that the latter could feel him.
Tony scoffed as he leaned back in his chair. “Well, I guess you’re going to have to find another date because I am
Steve peered over at Tony as he placed the Synergy device on the ground. Although he tried to not let his dream bother him, worrying about it had unfortunately translated into avoiding Tony a good part of the week until the day of the board presentation.
Steve’s expression slowly betrayed his discomfort. His face turned red as he looked away from Tony again.
Steve sighed again as he reached into the bag, slowly withdrawing the diary. He then turned toward Tony’s general direction who was facing a console, humming to himself.
Even though Tony had initially kept the trip away from him, Steve still felt close to him, close enough to consider their relationship serious although they hadn’t said anything out loud. Steve wanted to have that conversation but knew better not to bring it up while Tony was dealing with his past childhood trauma that weekend.
Steve leaned back into his chair. It hurt thinking about Tony not being able to trust him, but he did think they had been good together up until that point. He could call, but would Tony even pick up the phone? Steve figured he should give himself some time to figure out the best way to approach Tony without their conversation escalating.
Tony had to prevent himself from expressing amazement at Steve’s offer. He was sure he definitely looked goofy trying to act cool in front of a crush.
Steve’s mouth almost fell open. Wasn’t what he had just witnessed not too long-ago unnecessary danger?
The team hadn’t gone on any other field missions since their first assignment. They mostly worked in the lab or ran practice simulations. But Steve and Tony had been working perfectly together on anything they were tasked to do. Well “perfectly” might have been too strong of a word to describe it: although the two managed to work without causing any problems, it was obvious that a difference remained between their opposing personalities.
"Two weeks to Shield is it then," Tony said immediately. There was no chance in hell that he’d return to a city where a criminal waited for him.
“I was in daddy’s belly, right? Aunt Tasha said so.” Morgan couldn’t see the scar through the thick foam of their bubble bath, but she still stared intently at where she suspected her hand was.
"How could I not," escaped Steve and he blinked, just now realizing that Tony must be uncomfortable with his erection still inside of him. "Oh, fuck. Sorry, Tony, you must be sore, I'm sorry. Wait, I'll pull out. Just don't move now, doll."
Steve sighed deeply and grinned dopily at Tony before letting his head fall back onto the mat. Tony instantly started nibbling at his chin and jaw. The butterflies in his stomach that Steve had ignored up until now, starting squirming again. “I'm glad, Tony… and you’re a freaking tease, you know that, darling? I just couldn't resist any longer. Been wanting to do this for so long...”
“Yeah, Thor comes in handy with the heavy lifting and Bruce apparently can talk tech with me. I like him.” He concluded and raised his hand in thanks to the two of them before his eyes found Steve's again. “Steve, do you… I mean- would you like to...” He gnawed on his bottom lip. “Uh, maybe you- err, your team would like to, uh, spend the night? Here, I mean? I got some spare rooms just next to the main workshop and you guys look like you need a few hours of sleep. And it would also be better if I took another look at your ship tomorrow morning when the hyperspace engine is fully back online. We could eat together and you could tell me what happened to you after the, you know… that day… But we don't have to, if it makes you uncomfortable-”
“Love is when you care for someone a lot.” Steve took over from Tony. His chin was still pressed to Tony’s wet hair and he had his fingers interlaced over Tony’s belly. “I love your daddy. And your daddy loves me. We love you, Harley, and we love your sister, Morgan. And we also love your brother, Peter. We care for you. A lot. You are the most important people in my life. In our lives.”
Tony shook his head once and watched his family, exhausted but perfectly happy. “No. Let them sleep. Just for another moment.”
He leaned back and enjoyed the warmth and the peaceful atmosphere. Their giant bathtub was big enough for the children, their toys and Tony. He relaxed, slid back until the foam was up to his chin. Tony loved moments like these. Moments when the world was okay and he could close his eyes and let his mind wander for a bit.
Their children looked at them with big shiny eyes and Tony had to blink a few times to get rid of the treacherous tears that pricked his eyes at Steve’s heartfelt words. Before he could collect himself enough to say something, Steve continued. His voice was low and sweet, like he was sharing a secret with them.
Six days after their embarrassing appointment at the obgyn’s office, Tony woke up in the middle of the night because the lights in the kitchen were suddenly switched on. He stretched where he was lying on the couch in their living room and winced when his joints cracked at the movement.
I'm incredibly sorry that it took me so long to update this story. But here it is. Chapter 4. Finally!! Enjoy!!!
Tony glanced quickly at Steve, making it obvious that he feared they could have a malfunctioning device on their hands again.
“Virginia? Tomorrow, I’ll be at the press event at Stark Tower before flying back to the conference to give a presentation on Anthony’s face thing…”
They spent about a few hours on the process. Steve took notes as Tony worked at the console. It didn’t take much for them to find a sold rhythm; in fact, it surprised Steve that they were already working so well together.
Bruce stayed silence before continuing. He was leaning against a table, mimicking a thoughtful pose.
Both Tony and Pepper glanced at each other before Tony reached for the envelope. After opening the envelope, he flipped through a few documents until his expression hardened.
The carrier coughed a few times before answering. “I have this package here for a ‘Mr. Obadiah Stane’.”
“The board is looking forward to it, especially to see how well you work with the device, Mr. Rogers.” Obadiah opened his office door for Steve. Steve nodded once more before standing in the doorway.
Tony smirked. “He’s more than fine, he’s doing fantastic. I think he might know more about the device than I do.” He had a silly grin on his face as he thought about Steve working with the device.
“…okay, let’s get some sleep…” Steve whispered back, kissing the back of Tony’s head before settling.
“I…I think I’ll just go back to my office then…” He pointed behind himself, turning slightly so that Bruce couldn’t see how emotional his expression was becoming.
Once inside the building, Steve steadied himself before pressing the number to the penthouse, which was left unmarked for security purposes. He took his time pressing then waited. The intercom clicked before buzzing, indicating that the private express elevator had been unlocked for Steve to access.
“…how did you get it to finally stop shaking?” He asked as the scientists on the other side of the glass reflection gave him and Thanos the signal that it was safe to remove their glasses.
“Yeah, he seems really excited to finally meet you.” Steve volunteered as casually as possible although he didn’t want to talk about Sam wanting to meet Tony.
The investor looked relived as she listened to Obadiah ramble on some more about the project. They discussed some other business items as Obadiah rode the elevator down to the lobby with the investor. He escorted the investor to her car, lingering as he watched her driver whisk her away down the street. Obadiah then looked downward at his wristwatch, smiling to himself.
He inhaled deeply. He tried to look as calm as possible, but he needed to get out of there. His face had become flush with embarrassment and he dreaded having to carry on at the party as if someone who was integral to his current employment hadn’t just accused him of sleeping with his team leader.
Both Shuri and Bruce responded verbally. Tony then turned to face Steve. “Rogers, we’re going to help Thor track Loki, but we need to do it off hours. Thor, figure out his usual hangouts, but keep us in the loop and we’ll get him with you, okay?”
Suddenly, Tony began to feel the dull pain in his chest as Steve’s hand lingered. He started to panic, praying he wouldn’t have a panic attack or worse in front of Steve.
Steve stared down at Tony. “…I need…to know where this is going…we haven’t really…talked about it out loud…”
“Tony, what’s wrong?” Steve asked, appearing unaware that Strange was teasing Tony about his relationship with him.
Sam was sitting at the kitchen table. He was smiling widely while taking a huge bite out of a giant breakfast burrito. Steve stopped short near the kitchen as Tony continue to stop in front of him. Both shuffled around awkwardly: Steve looked around himself as if he had forgotten something and Tony felt around in his pockets as if he were searching for something.
Tiberius’s eyes widened with curiosity. “Well then…what if,” he wedged himself into Tony’s personal space, “the three of us went to that chalet out in the Alps? You remember the last time—"
Steve kissed Tony on the neck as he pulled his fingers out. He used both hands to pull Tony’s body toward him at the waist before feeling his chest. He leaned forward to lick both of Tony’s nipples, taking his time at each one, making small noises as he licked Tony. Tony moaned some more as he rubbed his hands through Steve’s hair, losing himself from the sensation.
Steve nodded as he slid a hand across Tony’s chest. “Well, let me know if I can help with anything…”
Tony took a moment before responding. “I really appreciate that, Steve…it’s just that…the shit with my dad is taking me longer to get over…I hadn’t realized it until the trip…”
The team busied themselves in the conference room as they generated material and equipment Natasha, Clint, and Thor needed to help people get off the island safely, while the rest of the team worked to track Thanos’s weapon.
Tony sat up in the bed as best as he could, prompting a now awake Steve to slide his body on top of him.
Steve shrugged. He wouldn’t necessarily call himself an “artist”, although he sketched frequently and recently got into painting.
Steve continued to rub Tony before unbuttoning Tony’s shirt slowly, slipping a hand underneath the fabric of his shirt to feel his skin. Tony moaned softly as Steve rubbed and pinched his nipples with both hands before using one hand to rub his body as the other kept feeling his chest. Tony pushed his body into Steve’s, rocking forward and back, moaning quietly from Steve feeling him.
“Rhodes, how did you get into my office?” Tony dropped his work bag on the floor as he slouched into his chair.
Not too long after, the entire Synergy team gathered at the round table at the helm of the command center at S.H.I.E.L.D. to meet with Fury before interrogating Thanos.
Holding onto Tony’s wrist, Steve pulled him close. He slowly dragged his hand along Tony’s wrist to his shoulder then to his face, cupping his cheek gently. Tony inhaled sharply as Steve closed the gap between the two of them by moving his face closer toward his. Both men closed their eyes as Steve leaned downward to kiss Tony, drawing him nearer with his free hand while the other stroked Tony’s face.
Pepper waved Tony off before he could continue. “Tony, why do you do this to yourself? From what you’ve told me, it sounds like Steve has never given you a reason to think this way and you know how honest he is. Don’t you think he would have told you something like this by now, especially if it happened with a close friend?”
Tony shuffled back and forth on his feet again as he crossed his arms. He looked away from Steve, closing his eyes before slowly opening them to look directly at Steve.
Tony nodded with a smile as Steve wiggled underneath him to sit up a bit. Tony straddled his waist, looking downward somewhat.
“I live here, but I don’t drive here, Tony,” Peter started, annoyed with Tony already giving him such a hard time, “that’s why I need to practice.” He sighed as he inched the car forward and backward, trying to get close to the curb, but was still quite a ways away from it.
He walked past one of the Synergy labs and peered inside. There, he saw Natasha and Clint talking to one another, both holding a cup of coffee. They waved at him before continuing their conversation. Steve waved back and pressed on toward his own lab—or Tony’s lab.
“So,” Mr. Beck opened the drawer to his desk and shuffled around a bit until he produced two sheets of paper. He placed the sheets out neatly in front of Steve and Tony on his desk, “these are two tests that Peter took along with the class earlier this year,” Mr. Beck pointed to the test on Steve and Tony’s left, “and one a few days ago. I’m sure you see the difference.” He ended by pointing to the one on Steve and Tony’s right.
Obadiah let go of Steve’s hand with one last shake, his expression morphing back into that insincere smile, before walking away. Steve stood paralyzed, horrified by what had just transpired.
As the couples surrounding them began to dance slowly in time with the music winding down, Clint bowed theatrically in front of Natasha who sneered at her friend’s staged behavior. They then sauntered to the other side of the space, still within Tony’s and Steve’s view. Natasha positioned herself somewhat behind Clint as he handed her a miniature tablet. Natasha accepted the tablet before inserting the chip. After tapping on the tablet, Natasha found the mansion’s construction documents.
“I’ve been looking through the footage from the last couple incidents related to the Synergy device…” Natasha leaned forward to drop the envelope onto Tony’s desk.
Tony laughed as he pushed down harder into Steve, moaning loudly. Steve could feel himself coming to the brink, arriving there faster than he had ever before. Something about the suddenness of feeling Tony against him underneath water was driving him wild.
Tony and Steve hadn’t spoken to one another since that Monday: Tony kept to his office either at work or at home. Steve, too worried that he would upset Tony even more by trying to explain himself, stayed in the lab. Once or twice he thought about seeking Tony out, thinking he could try to talk to him either in his office or on the phone. However, the way Tony reacted to him keeping the diary alarmed Steve; of all their arguments and misunderstandings, Steve had never seen Tony upset like that before.
Steve smiled at Tony before letting out an unexpected, relieved-sounding sigh. Something about it puzzled Tony; even though in his lowest moment he oscillated back and forth between breaking up with Steve and worrying about losing him, it never occurred to him that Steve might have been fretting about them breaking up also.
Tony grinned. Something about it was alarmingly charming. Well, more like arrestingly captivating, to say the least.
“Everything will work out accordingly, my boy.” Obadiah nearly whispered with the most disingenuous expression that made Tony sick.
Steve only responded with another nod as he placed his head into his hands to rest on top of the table.
“Is everyone talking about me? Am I really that obvious?” He tried for a playful tone, but he was sure he also sounded a little irritate, especially after being reminded that he was terrible when it came to relationships.
“Stark, you and I need to have a formal meeting with the Synergy executive committee, but I think it’s still fine to proceed with the promotional tour. We can’t push it back any further.” Fury continued.
“…hey,” Steve started on the other end, “…I was…just about to call you…” He laughed quietly, but to Tony he sounded nervous.
fucking hard.” Tony breathed as he stroked Steve for some time before leaning downward to suck on his cock.
“Of course, Rogers. I wouldn’t miss embarrassing you.” Before Steve could ask for an explanation, Tony side stepped next to him, pulled out his phone, and snapped a picture of the two of them. He had his hand around Steve’s waist, instinctively pulling him tight.
“I didn’t think I would get a chance to work with you, Mr. Stark.” Steve hoped the statement didn’t sound offensive.
Tony waved before walking quickly off the stage handing the microphone to Pepper. Both Rhodey and Pepper were trying to talk to him about how great the presentation was, but Tony needed some space. He nodded as he listened, but he could feel his chest restricting, almost as if he were close to fainting.
Bruce chuckled before he proceeded. “No, I’m serious, Tony. You work well with people who don’t take your shit and well, Steve seems to be your best match.”
Steve could hardly control himself as he felt Tony’s body squeeze him as he lowered. Steve instinctively bucked up into Tony’s body, trying to slow down, but the sensation was too great.
Tony squinted before inching closer toward the projected numbers. He noticed that a few of the equations inputted into device were incorrect.
“Watch it be someone totally out of left field like…Tony Stark.” Sam joked which prompted Bucky to continue laughing uncontrollably.
Tony, as he let Steve hold him, groaned again. “Steve, it’s not about winning or losing. It’s about safety.”
“…everything seemed so abrupt…as if they already had their minds made up and were just waiting for us…” Tony concluded.
“I would say as soon as we break. And just for a couple hours.” Fury circled their destination before rolling up the map to hand to Tony.
Steve blushed as he let Tony pull him downward for a kiss. Steve laid down on top of him, rubbing Tony’s cock through the fabric of his briefs. Tony moaned as he felt Steve then push downward into his body, rubbing his hard cock against his.
He sighed loudly, swearing to himself before reaching for the bedside table drawer. Tony slowly withdrew the envelope from the drawer, turning it over before lifting the flap. He stared at the folded letter, groaning before pulling the letter free.
Tony laughed loudly. “No, Rogers. He’s still too young to own a phone. I made him a watch that he can send me messages through, well, emojis really. J.A.R.V.I.S. is also wired to it, but besides that, it’s really just a high-tech looking wristwatch.”
Tony smiled back. “It’s only great because of the company, Rogers.” He held his glass up for Steve to cheers and they clinked their glasses together. Eventually, the two waded through a comfortable silence, just one of the many they had prior till now that you can only truly have with someone you trust or are beginning to.
“Hey, Steve.” Shuri waved at Steve before turning toward the projector to set up the call with Fury.
Later that evening after eating their home-made pizza and cleaning up the kitchen, Steve and Tony tucked Peter in his bed. They then spent some time out on the balcony before going to Tony’s bedroom.
Shuri looked back and forth between Tony and Bruce, still wearing a smile. “That’s a really great offer, Mr. Stark—”
Steve walked back into the bedroom as Tony kept searching around. “Uh, Rogers…” he called for Steve as he walked into the bedroom, “…I think there’s only one bedroom…”
“Hey, Rogers. Missed you last night.” Tony grinned as he walked up to Steve to give him a quick hug and kiss.
Tony tried not to eye Steve suspiciously. Remembering how he takes his coffee wasn’t something Tony was expecting from their burgeoning friendship.
Tony moved his hand on Steve’s waist to caress his face. Steve sighed. “I feel comfortable with you, though, Tony…”
Steve slid a hand along Tony’s chest to pull him in for a kiss. “We should probably get back to work.”
Tony nodded as he backed away awkwardly to give Steve some space, suddenly remembering that this would be the first time Steve visited him at his place since the party.
As soon as the elevator doors opened into the space, both Tony and Steve were met with the entire Synergy team, accompanied by Rhodey, Pepper, some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and a few board members, clapping and cheering for Steve.
Tony had been more than supportive as they readied themselves before making their way to the space connecting the backstage to the main stage which was facing a huge crowd of people waiting to hear about the device. Steve had never seen anything like it; he had never attended a design expo, let alone one on this magnitude. It was both simultaneously thrilling and jarring.
Tony shook his head as he crossed his arms. He kept his eyes trained on Bruce to avoid accidentally looking back at Steve.
The board members murmured to each other, but no one appeared offended. Actually, every single one of them appeared impressed that even their high-level security clearance couldn’t even get them close to the device.
Eventually, Tony nestled himself back onto Steve’s chest, wrapping a hand around his waist. Steve held Tony with one hand, kissing the top of his head. Tony smiled to himself, rubbing his body against Steve’s until he found himself succumbing from the exhaustion brought on from not only being with Steve for the first time in a long time but also from the back and forth over their relationship. He closed his eyes, feeling Steve, his body finally relaxing until he ultimately fell asleep.
“Why does it take the government so damn long to get anything done around here?” Tony repeated his usual line as he stood behind the holographic image. Steve was standing at the edge of the stage half-facing the crowd.
He turned to face the mirror with the stripped shirt. The more he looked at it, the less ugly the shirt appeared. Tony shrugged as he proceeded to change. He then joined Peter in the kitchen to wait for Rhodey.
“Oh, hey!” Steve greeted his friend who he hadn’t seen all night. Bucky was visiting once more before finally relocating to New York to accept his new assignment. Both friends hugged each other before facing the board member.
“Mr. Stane? You wanted to see me?” Steve was standing in the threshold of the door to Obadiah’s office.
Riri looked even more guilty than before. Tony waved her apprehension off with a smile to indicate that he was not offended.
“I don’t know…did you hit your quota for today?” Tony asked; his joking tone suggesting he wasn’t sure he would allow Steve to stay over.
As he approached his usual workstation, Steve finally checked his text messages. He found a few from Sam asking him how his trip with Tony was, undoubtedly wearing that goofy smile while crafting those messages. Steve sighed to himself as he thought about the entire trip.
“Okay, so I’m only going to say this once. And if you don’t answer me correctly,” Tony pointed to a manic-looking Thor as he was now being held back by Steve and Bruce, “I’m going to sic your brother on you and he looks like he wants to beat the shit out of you.” He shoved the tablet into Loki’s face.
Tony stared at Steve as if he had sprouted a third eye, but he remained quiet. Steve could tell that he was already offended by his reasoning.
Peter and Tony army crawled out from underneath the robot before running to the console to watch the sequence again. As soon as the computer finished with the numbers, both Tony and Peter hi-fived each other before running back over toward the robot. Tony pulled out a device from his back pocket, handing it to Peter. Peter accepted it before tapping on the gadget a few times. After a second or two, the robot began to flicker with a hodgepodge of colors before rising from its restraints.
Just a heads up about the next chapter: I may be a little late...it’s my birthday next Sunday and I have some other things to work on/things to be at, but I should be able to post on schedule! It just might be later in the day then around the early afternoon. 😅😅😅
A jolt reverberating throughout the subway car forced Steve’s body to bump into a shorter older woman. Steve instinctively held out a hand to help the woman, and she gratefully thanked him for stopping her from falling over. Steve smiled back, but on the inside, he felt miserable.
Tony nodded, holding onto Steve’s arms, looking away as Steve gave him a firm hug before finally letting go. Tony cleared his throat and straightened his clothes out as Steve smiled at him before turning to walk over to a worktable.
“We’ve been looking through your company files and we’re very impressed, Mr. Lieber. You seem like someone we could do business with.”
“Nice to meet you…Loki?” Steve hadn’t meant for the greeting to sound like a question, but similar to when he met Thor for the first time, he was confused by the choice in nickname, because surely “Loki” was not Thor’s brother’s real name.
Tony pointed to the ceiling as he walked to the center of the lab. “J.A.R.V.I.S., meet Steve Rogers. Rogers, meet J.A.R.V.I.S.”
Tony rolled his eyes before he answered Clint. “Because we’re running a secret government program and I don’t want the media circus to see it.” He sighed heavily.
Tony and Steve were in the former’s bedroom after putting Peter to bed who was still way too excited about Steve staying over once again, although it was becoming a regular occurrence.
Bruce pointed at Thor as he nodded in agreement back at Clint. “Couldn’t have said it better myself.”
As he walked away from the scene, Tony couldn’t help but stare back at Steve, completely transfixed that they had just made out again. However, he needed to stay focused or their little act would be quickly discovered.
“Ever wonder why it takes so damn long for anything to get done around here?” Tony asked rhetorically as the audience kept cheering.
Peter rolled his eyes, looking over in Steve’s direction, pleading for mercy. Steve laughed as Tony looked at both his kid and his husband as if he didn’t know why he was being ridiculous.
Pepper shook her head as she leaned inward over the table. “No, Tony. Please listen to me. I care about you and I want to see you happy.”
Steve nodded back before turning to face the device. It glowed some more before humming quietly to signal that it was almost done constructing the detonator.
Pepper sniffled. She wiped her eye before smiling. “Tony, it’s okay. I’ve accepted that you weren’t comfortable discussing it with me.”
Tony pumped his fingers in and out of Steve, scissoring them at one point, making Steve squirm each time with another moan. Tony kissed Steve’s neck, feeling his chest as best as he could with his free hand before slowly pulling out his fingers. Steve had been so caught up in the moment that he whined as soon as Tony pulled out.
“Uh…nice to see you two ladies on such a lovely evening…” Obadiah managed as he straightened himself out.
He ran down the corridor, shoving people away as he tried to get through the mangled mess that was the remnant of his lab. He jumped over fallen glass panels of the façade, seeing Steve lying in the middle of the lab unconscious.
“It’s almost dinner time. How do you feel about lasagna as a welcome home surprise?” Steve smiled at Tony and kissed his nose.
A few hours later, after a much needed shower and a home-cooked meal, Steve finally got the chance to ask JARVIS what Tony meant by ‘size queen’. The answer he received went straight to his dick. Needless to say that Tony was very enthusiastically lending him a helping hand the following night.
What they hadn’t known then, was that Peter had already planned to put them in costumes. That’s why Steve was wearing a suit on a sunday, and a short black wig. His upper lip itched with the black fake moustache he’d applied with some special glue that smelled like lemons. And Tony was all dolled up like he was going to Hollywood… or a funeral. The cherry on top of his whole outfit was the long black wig Peter had made him wear. It clashed a bit with his real goatee, but shaving had been off the table in less than two seconds.
Tony pulled a giant shirt, pants and a cloth that resembled a scarf from the duffel bag and stood up. Then he paused. "Um, and where exactly am I supposed to change?"
"You're in the outer wastelands of the west, Tony. Nobody cares about decorum. You can either ride with me, or one of the others. Whatever you prefer." Steve's voice was calm and he spoke quietly to Tony. Maybe he did sense how uncomfortable the situation was for him.
It hadn’t been long since the last time he had seen Tony’s skin shine like that. Gasping, he had been hovering above Steve, with his knees bent and his hands on the blonde’s chest. Tony’s warmth had engulfed Steve wholly. The force around them had connected them deeply and the taller man had held on tightly to his beloved’s slender waist.
"Nooo! Daddy! It tickles! Harley, save me!" Morgan squealed and started squirming in his arms, trying to get away, but he held her tightly in his embrace. The water around them sloshed dangerously and they made a mess of the carpet next to the tub.
He was pulled from his thoughts when the sheriff suddenly stopped, and he bumped into the alpha’s back. It was like walking into a wall. Tony stumbled backwards and rubbed his aching nose.
“Here we go again. The sheriff’s savior complex is rubbing off on you… That’s so typical of him, he never thinks things through. Always picking up strays. He couldn’t just leave him alone, could he? The guy obviously doesn’t want to talk about it.”
James nodded at his companion. “I don't trust you, Tony," James stated. The blunt comment made Tony blink, but he was glad that James didn't beat around the bush. Tony could deal with that. "But the sheriff found you and I trust him. And you don’t exactly look like a criminal or a peddler either. So, what happened to you?”
Tony took a deep breath and grabbed the duffle bag that had been hidden beneath his bench. He pressed it to his chest, incredibly glad that the bandits hadn’t seen it. At least he still had this. Trembling, he opened the duffle bag and peered inside. The white lace of his wedding gown was a soothing sight.
Tony had met many alphas in his short life, too many for his liking, but none, literally none had smelled like Sheriff Rogers. The man smelled like apples, leather and caramel. It was a surprisingly sweet scent, and incredibly distracting. It made Tony's head spin. All the alphas that Tony had ever met before had smelled tangy, woody and sometimes even sharp. Just like Natasha, who’s scent reminded Tony of snow, metal and earth.
Tony’s goatee scratched over his chin and lips as they stood and kissed languidly. It was everything. Steve’s thoughts were blessedly empty. At this moment nothing else mattered.
“Then come with me.” Breathless the words stumbled from Steve’s lips before he could hold them back. He saw Tony’s eyes widen in shock and surprise but it was too late. And if he was true to himself, then Steve didn’t want to take the words back. He barreled on, summoning all of his courage. “Come with me, Tony. Leave this place behind and join us. Live with us among the stars, away from the Hutts, away from the seclusion… Live with me after we finished this mission.”
A cheeky little smile pulled at the corners of Tony’s mouth. His lips were a deep red, almost like fresh blood. “You stole that quote, oh husband of mine. And it’s not Tony today.”
"Tilt your head back, Morgan. I don't want you to get shampoo in your eyes." Tony brushed her hair back again and Morgan fell back against his chest. She looked up at him with her big eyes and smiled brightly. In her little hands she held her Thor and Loki themed rubber ducks that her uncles had given her for her birthday. Tony proceeded to rinse out Morgan's hair until it was free from bubbles, even though he knew it wouldn't last for long. "Okay, now you're clean from head to toe. You almost sparkle, can you see that?"
From time to time Steve even imagined he saw Tony's eyes follow him. And maybe Tony touched him a bit more than what was appropriate for heterosexual friends, seeked him out more often than the others. Those thoughts were what had led to Steve having ill-timed boners in the most awkward of situations. Steve had a very active imagination, okay? And secretly he still hoped that he didn’t imagine it all, and that maybe, perhaps, possibly Tony could one day look at him, like Steve did.
"Fuck you, oh my God, fuck you, Steve!" Tony chanted and rocked forward into the heat between their bodies.
The larger man was chasing his own pleasure. He had being on the edge of coming ever since Tony had taken him into his mouth. And the brunet gave as good as he got, squeezing down onto Steve, following his thrusts and circling his hips in sync, while his fingers had found Steve’s pecs once again, which he kneaded and touched to his heart's desires.
Little Peter watched his parents fascinated. The moment was over when the door to the waiting room opened and a young woman in a blue shirt and white pants stepped into the room. She held a clipboard to her chest and looked all business. She reminded Tony of Peter’s aunts Pepper and Natasha. It was a bit unnerving to be honest.
Gently at first, Steve dug his strong fingers into the tempting flesh of Tony’s small but deliciously round ass, relishing the fact that he could fit each buttcheek in one of his hands. Tony never broke their messy kiss, stubborn and proud as he was, even when he was being messed up by a much larger man. First simultaneously but then randomly, Steve moved his hands and flexed his fingers. He pulled, pushed and kneaded Tony’s asscheeks, spreading them wide before squeezing down again. An endless stream of small but enticing sounds fell from Tony’s lips onto his own, breathless encouragement and approval.
Bruce was a highly talented chemistry professor, who had worked on Coruscant, now the capital of the Galactic Empire, after the fall of the Republic. But he was also an excellent doctor, even when he insisted that they should ask a real medic instead of him, when one of them was injured. Bruce had fled the planet when the Order 66 had been executed, afraid to loose his life because he'd had casual contact with the Jedi Order. Sometimes Steve wondered why the two of them had never met during his time as a Padawan, when he too had lived on Coruscant. Maybe it was because the Professor had been kind of known to be a very gentle person, but his angry outbursts had been said to be scary and unpredictable.
“I-I can’t,” Tony admitted reluctantly, too tired to start a fight. He stared at the ground in front of him and clutched the reins of the horse a little tighter. “I don’t know how to.”
It fitted Tony perfectly. It was tradition for an omega to wear their mother’s wedding dress to their own ceremony, but since Tony was a man, his parents had had a tailor change it slightly. Now it consisted of a button down with wide balloon sleeves, a short crimson waistcoat that could almost be misinterpreted as a corset, and dark pants. Around his neck he wore his mother’s necklace, a filigree silver pendant with a blue crystal in the middle.
Yeah, Steve's dick twitched dangerously at the images that popped up in his head, and it took all of his willpower not to come right then and there. "You're playing dirty, Stark," Steve chided him, but there was no real heat behind his words. The prospect of having Tony's small frame writhe on top of him, having that lean figure impaled on his enormous dick, taking all of his huge member… it was thrilling. It was a wet dream come true, one that he’d never thought he’d be able to realise.
If he agreed to let the alpha help him, then he could give his legs a break. Tony was a weak man. Wasn't it pathetic how willingly he threw his pride away for the opportunity to have someone pretend to care about him?
The dull thumping of heavy steps and the clinking of silver spurs announced the sheriff’s approach. Tony slowly sat up. He couldn't remember how he'd gotten down to where he had been sleeping on a foreign jacket as a makeshift pillow. It smelled heavenly.
The minutes ticked away and the sheer endless forest which they were passing through became boring after a while. The sheriff didn’t talk to the other deputies. He and Tony were the last of the group, and Tony wondered if it was because of him or if Rogers was always this quiet.
The Captain knew he had a thing for Tony. Steve was man enough to admit to himself that what he was feeling towards the other was definitely not friendship.
Then he bent slightly forward, one of his hands sneaking down between his spread legs and vanishing behind his balls. Only the wet sounds and Tony’s ragged breath indicated that he’d just started stretching himself on top of Steve. His free hand found purchase on Steve’s abs, still glistening with a copious amount of hand lotion.
“Did- did you just tear my pants apart?” Tony shot back, equally red and flustered. His voice was rough and took Steve’s mind out of the gutter. The blonde’s gaze drifted upwards but got stuck at his kiss-swollen lips. Distracted by the sight, he opened his mouth to maybe apologize to Tony -even though he didn’t feel sorry at all-, when those tantalizing lips curved into a delighted grin. “No shit, that was so hot, babe.”
"More- more than okay… I- I think I just- just need a little break…" Tony was still sitting on top of him, looking thoroughly fucked, but smiling nevertheless. Steve had just enough brain cells left to catch Tony when the man could longer hold himself upright and he sank down on top of Steve's chest, heaving. Steve wrapped him up in his strong arms and pressed his face into Tony's sweaty neck, inhaling his scent deeply and not caring about the sticky mess between their stomachs, that would soon dry and start to itch.
“Should we wake them?” Steve whispered into the darkness, fondness audible in his deep voice. He was relaxed and content, and Tony knew that Steve did not want to send them back to bed just yet.
Clint appeared before him and wordlessly took the box from him to store it in the belly of their spaceship. He and Nat had somehow managed to scrape up enough money to get their hands on enough food and medical supplies that they wouldn’t have to worry about that for at least two months. Sure, they would be eating ration bars for a while, but those were substantial and nutritious. Though that didn’t mean that they were tasty.
I am incredibly sorry for leaving this fic for so long, I am sorry, I am trash, I'm hiding under that stone over there, please don't hate me...
“No, actually I thought he was with you in the lab.” Steve frowned down at him. “He’s pretty closed off lately. I was thinking about talking to him. If that Flash guy is bullying him again, then I’ll have words with his teachers!”
“Yeah. You say it all the time, pops.” Harley rolled his eyes dramatically at his alpha father, which made both parents snicker. “But why does it not hurt when you say it to dad? Why does Peter hurt?”
Tony startled and fell backwards on his butt when suddenly the face of the sheriff appeared above him. The alpha looked over the back of the horse and how was he so tall?! This was so unfair!
Steve’s blood rushed through his body and seemed to gather in his middle. He was rock hard and as he glanced down at their bodies, he realized that Tony was too. Steve’s heart skipped a beat. And suddenly he realized that he was tired of their games. They had danced around each other long enough, he decided. It was time to do something.
Suddenly Steve was keenly aware of their size difference in the way Tony's black wife beater rode up and revealed a few inches of his smooth skin, when he stretched to grab his favorite mug that Steve had accidentally put on the highest shelf in the communal kitchen once again. He recognized it in Tony's posture, how he clasped his hands behind his back and bounced on his feet when he was standing beside Steve without his armor. And he saw it when he looked down into Tony’s eyes and could count the golden specks in his warm brown irises, and marvel at the way his dark bottom lashes threw delicate shadows over his cheeks.
“Oh, no, Steve, darling… I love you so much for taking care of our baby boy when I wasn’t home. You're a great father. Really, you are. But… you really should have left that to me, honey, no offense.” Tony wrapped his arms around his pouting husband’s waist and pressed a sweet kiss to his chin and his strong neck. “Steve, darling, let’s be real. JARVIS showed me the video. You used a salad bowl to give our son a bowl cut. Peter looks like a tiny version of John Lennon.”
With that the whole robber band collected their loot and swiftly exited the train. They were gone just as quickly as they had appeared.
"Hey. You're home." Tony smiled at their son. The teenager looked up from his shoes and Tony was once again stunned at how much Peter resembled him. Where Harley had Steve’s fair hair and blue eyes, Peter and Morgan looked a lot like Tony when he had been their age.
Steve had left the room, beet red and embarrassed. He was by far no monk, but getting advice from an alien God on how to properly jerk off was definitely not what he’d signed up for.
“Oh my God, Steve!?” Tony called. His eyes widened in shock at what he had spotted. “Why do you have a bald spot on the back of your head?!”
The attacking stormtroopers were retreating back to the door and Steve ran forward to give his team more time to get to safety. The engines of the Quinjet whined behind him and he heard Thor call his name but… Steve turned around to search for Tony and found him at his workbench. He held two glowing devices in his hands. The brunet’s eyes were haunted and filled with fear. He had no weapons.
“Here you go, Tony. It'll warm you up.” Bruce handed him his own mug of tea that he gratefully accepted. The cold from the icy river water was still clinging to him. Various members of the group watched him a bit sceptical. Tony felt himself tense up under their gazes and busied himself with his herbal tea. Internally he sighed and prepared himself for a long evening.
Steve’s heart broke a little in his chest. He pulled Tony forward by the hand in his neck and their foreheads touched in a tender gesture. Closing his eyes for a moment he drew in Tony’s scent and felt the pull of the force that told him that it was time, time to move. It was time to go.
“Yeah, it is.” Steve raised one hand to Tony’s neck and carded his fingers through his short hair, relishing the fact that he could do that now. He knew that telling Tony their next destination was dangerous, but dangerous was also the planet in itself where they would be going. It was no use to hide it from Tony.
“Yup!” Morgan confirmed with a grave nod. “Can we visit him in the hospital? We can bring him jello!”
The men panted, both overwhelmed by the sheer fact that Tony could take Steve’s huge member, and soon the air was filled with the wet sounds of skin meeting skin and choked-off words. Steve suspected he should be taking it slower, to give Tony more time to adjust to the angle, his girth and the force of gravity, which let Steve’s cock reach new depths with every thrust and that it could be too much for Tony, but…
Steve kissed the crown of his head, smiling to himself. “We love you too, Tony. It’s good to have you back. We missed you.”
Tony buried his face in Steve’s strong neck for another moment before kissing Steve’s jaw softly. Then they turned around to wander down the hallway to the living room. They held hands like on the first date.
Rolling his eyes, Steve pinched Tony’s butt lovingly before turning around to walk to where Peter was still busy giving Darth Vader a pink lightsaber in the next room. Tony watched him go, still smiling. He loved his husband and his son to the moon and back, but sometimes he wondered who was the one with the crazy ideas in their relationship. The engineer was about to follow the soldier when he suddenly saw something else that made him pause.
“Of course, peanut!” Steve nodded gravely and raised one hand to his heart. “A promise is a promise.”
Steve loved to hear his husband laugh, but this time he really wanted the floor to open up and swallow him whole. His face burned from pure embarrassment. Crossing his arms over his chest, he stared a hole into the carpet of the dining room. Peter was sitting at the small table in the living room next door, busy and happy with his coloring book.
The blonde snickered. It sounded good, if a little rusty. "No. We're not even close to the borders of the forest." The sheriff shook his head with a grin.
"S-Steve, Steve…" Tony finally said, his amber eyes locking with Steve's blue irises. He held himself upright with his hands on the larger man's abs, but his arms and thighs were quivering.
Her tone was friendly if also carefully neutral. Tony wasn’t sure if he wanted to trust her. She radiated much more danger than the man who’d just tried to talk to Tony, even though she was a petite woman.
Steve moaned shamelessly. “Shit, yeah, I do…” He admitted and threw his head back, enjoying the feeling and how it sent sparks through his body. Absent-mindedly, he noticed how Tony tried to rut against his abs, trying to gain some friction on his poor, neglected dick.
“Tony! I’m gonna-” Steve growled and forced Tony’s hips down, making him take Steve as deeply as he could, before he came with a grunt, finally giving in to the pull behind his navel. He shot his load deep inside of Tony, feeling how his cum filled the nonexistent space between them and connected them in a twisted sense of amorous poetry. It was sticky, wet, warm and absolutely magnificent.
Last but not least: bidding week for Marvel Trumps Hate has started. So if you want to spend money for charity and get something nice out of it just follow the link here:
“So you already met them?” Steve asked him. He stepped back to grant Tony more freedom and already missed his proximity.
Silently the Twi'lek had come around to stand on the other side of Steve and Tony. Her hands rested on her weapons on her hips and she raised an eyebrow at the scene in front of her. “Natasha.” She said simply and went to stand next to Clint. Single words spoken in quiet Twi'leki reached Steve's ears and he was glad he didn't understand them when Natasha and Clint started snickering.
“That’s okay, dear. Neither can I.” Steve leaned in and very gently kissed the shorter man’s lips, so he wouldn’t ruin the make up his husband had on. The dark eyeshadow and pale teint let Tony look like a vampire. It was enchanting. Tony’s eyes fell closed and Steve inhaled his scent through his nose.
“You know, this suit really accentuates your ass.” Tony purred quietly, his lips close to Steve’s ear as they waited for more instructions from Peter, who was still talking with the photographer. His hand found its way to Steve’s butt and squeezed.
Steve growled in the back of his throat and let go of the torn fabric of Tony’s pants to grab his slender hips. Sighing happily, Tony returned the favor of feeling him up and slipped his hands beneath Steve’s shirt, shoving it out of the way so he had free access to his pecs.
Tony rubbed his hands over his alpha’s forearms. He loved how protective Steve was of their children. But Tony was also sure that Peter was not acting weird because he was being bullied again. That had been different.
"Nope, no touching my dick, or I'll come right away. And I refuse to come without that cock inside of me. Steve… I want it, I get it. I licked it, it's mine now..." Tony placed a kiss on the side of his erection, never breaking eye contact with Steve. His huge doe eyes seemed to become even bigger, and Steve, well, Steve was a weak man in the end. Tony's voice was a purr when he continued. "I can take it, babe. Want to be reminded of the shape of you when I wake up tomorrow, all raw and fucked out. And then we'll do it again until I can't walk in a straight line anymore. Please..."
Reluctantly he rose from the bed and grabbed his pants. Naked as on the day he had been born, he stepped forward into Tony’s space and simply watched his face in wonder. Without a word he leaned in and pressed his lips to the shorter man’s. There it was again. The spark that linked them. The former jedi wondered if Tony could feel it as well. He certainly hoped so.
“Clint? Natasha? I think I know where we can get the ship patched up. I've got a good feeling about this.” He told them, still looking at the display.
“I hope this doesn't explode in our faces! I still don't trust that mechanic.” With a kick Clint opened the heavy iron door to the workshop, when they arrived back to the little port some time later. It slammed into the next wall and Steve slipped through the gap before the door came back crashing into his face.
Steve took a deep breath to focus on the present. He'd never heard word of Tony being killed that day. But on the other hand he'd also never heard word of Tony surviving. Steve swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat. Dwelling on the past would not make their ship repair itself for free. They still needed to get the Quinjet fixed on Tatooine, if they wanted to leave that desert-ball of a planet again. He pulled an index list of every workshop in Mos Eisley up and skimmed over the names of the shop owners. The back of his neck tingled when his blue eyes landed on an unfamiliar name. It was a strange feeling. He ignored in in favor of reading the rest of the list but his gaze repeatedly landed on that one particular name.
With nothing else to do, Tony could feel his eyelids become heavy. In the end, the steady wobbling of the horse, the sheriff’s scent and his exhaustion got the better of him. Tony fought against the sleepiness that crept into his bones. He jerked awake when he realized he’d fallen asleep for all of two seconds. Rubbing over his eyes, Tony hoped that the sheriff hadn’t noticed it.
“Okay, where to, Captain?” Clint asked him, pushing various buttons as he slowly piloted them to the city.
Tony came back a week later and had to actually leave the room again. Steve colored at his reaction.
Steve watched Tony go back inside and stood there for a long time. The gentle wind of Coruscant tousled his blonde hair and he looked up to the sky. He knew he mustn't feel this way, Jedi were not allowed to develop intimate feelings for another person. But his heart did not care about the stupid rules. His heart loved Tony more than he even wanted to admit to himself. Warmth pooled in his stomach, when he thought about their date after his ceremony and a spark of nervousness tingled in the back of his head.
"We were worried about you, Peter. Have you been at Ned's?" Steve asked carefully and retracted his hand.
In the light of day he finally got a good look at his savior. Rogers wore a cream colored shirt that he'd tucked into his denim jeans, above which he wore brown leather chaps. The silver sheriff’s star on his chest and the golden ring on his finger twinkled in the early morning sunlight. Just like the rest of his group he had a stetson on his head that hid most of his fair hair. On his belt hung two menacingly looking colts. All of the people of this group carried weapons. Tony knew his way around guns, though he'd never used one himself.
“We can take him with us now. Have some fun before… you know?” Accent guy laughed and made a crude gesture with his hands and hips. “Might make us some money too.” Then he bent down and grabbed Tony’s neck. His grip was vice-like and Tony hissed in pain as he forced the omega to look up into his dull eyes. The man’s bad body odor almost made him gag. With his free hand he followed the line of Tony’s jaw. “You’d make a pretty little whore, wouldn’t ya?”
“Yeah, dinner sounds good.” Steve smiled at him. His hand was still in Tony's and he felt every nerve ending like it was on fire. How could this simple skin to skin contact make him feel like he was in free fall?
Steve rode out his orgasm, while his cock continued to twitch inside of his partner. All he could grasp in that moment was the feeling of Tony's slender body beneath his palms, his weight on top of him, the comforting warmth and scent that never failed to wrap him up in a tight embrace that was filled with belonging.
Steve remembered that Tony had been very young -barely twenty-two- when he took over the position as the CEO of his late father's weapons company, ten years ago, before the political conflict escalated into the clone wars. He himself had been merely a Jedi Youngling back then. Steve had known Tony for half his life and even though their upbringings were so different from each other, the two had become friends after a kind of rocky start.
Tony grabbed his hand and held it there. He grinned. “Good to know that at least someone likes it. I let it grow because of other reasons than beauty care.” His eyes searched Steve's face for something, even though Steve wasn't sure what it was. When he opened his mouth again, his voice was quiet. “It's been some years, right? How about we celebrate this reunion with dinner? The suns are setting and you look like you need a break. I could- I mean we… I can tell you everything that happened, but not right now. Okay? Maybe after dinner?” He looked up to meet Steve's gaze, his voice had become small and yet hopeful. The unspoken question if Steve would stay was hanging in the air between them.
With Tony’s head on his shoulder, his warmth next to him, his breath on his skin, his scent in the air… This. Steve wanted this. He no longer wanted to simply survive. He wanted to live. He wanted to live with Tony next to him. He wanted his life to have a new constant that was this man. Like a pendulum in his core, the force shifted something in him into place that had been off before. It fixed his broken self.
The omega smiled into his tea, pulled the scarf a little tighter around his shoulders, and when he raised his eyes again, he saw the alpha sheriff looking at him from across the fire. Their gazes met for a long heartbeat, before Rogers raised his mug slightly and smiled at Tony tentatively.
Steve took his hand and rose to stand next to Tony. He sighed deeply and rubbed over the bridge of his nose. “I thought getting frozen in an iceberg for seventy years was the weirdest thing that could’ve happened to me, but here I am, a one hundred year old, male senior citizen on my way to an appointment with my obgyn.”
"Fine. I'll talk to that mysterious sheriff. Where is that guy?" Tony exclaimed. He could feel a headache approach. A bit wonky, he rose from where he had been sitting on a log, but the combination of the sudden movement, his exhaustion and the mead made his head spin. The omega raised his hands to his head and stumbled backwards.
Tony pressed his lips into a thin line, trying to keep himself from laughing. Because that would only make things worse. “I’m sure it’s not that bad. Lots of parents have those problems,” he tried, but promptly shut up when Steve’s blue eyes bore into his own and he was confronted with the ‘
On the spur of the moment he took the blonde’s hand. The sheriff swiftly pulled him up, grabbed him around the waist, and before Tony could blink twice, he was sitting in front of the alpha.
“Okay. Okay, Tony.” Steve breathed through the fog of memories that was always looming in the back of his head. He didn’t want this moment to be ruined. He wanted to keep this peace in him.
"Fuck, yes, I do.” Tony moaned and planted a kiss on Steve’s lips. It wasn’t as rushed and needy as before, but still deep and intense. “You're not the only one with a size kink, babe," Tony breathed into his mouth when they separated for air.
“So- so- so frustratingly observant and attentive and gorgeous and you’re driving me crazy, you asshole!” Tony ground out, aiming for pissed off but missing by a mile. Steve couldn’t see how he pulled his fingers out, but he could hear it. The engineer was all gentle edges and soft curves, slightly pink, and his eyes glistened in a post-coital haze. He gnawed on his bottom lip and pouted. “I wanted to come on your dick, not my fingers!”
Tony groaned to himself. He knew he would probably run into Bucky again at the hospital but figured he would also be with Sam.
Tony smiled back, giving himself some credit for making a good move finally. He then looked downward at his phone, realizing he was down to one percent battery power.
Steve moved from side to side before turning his back to look at himself from behind in the mirror. He was wearing one of the new safety uniforms Tony had created.
As Steve stepped into the elevator, he knew he cared about Tony and wanted him in his life. He hadn’t regretted last night; he missed Tony, too. But from their argument, it felt like Tony wasn’t willing to commit. Steve knew Tony was keeping him at a distance; he thought that maybe if he communicated to Tony how much he cared about him, maybe that would show Tony that he could be vulnerable with him again.
Some time passed as Steve humped Tony’s body before Tony sat up straight, kissing Steve as he held onto him before flipping him over onto his back. He kissed Steve along his neck and then the side of his body, stopping short to feel Steve’s cock with one hand.
“Hey, what’s going on? You know how into Tony Steve is. Why can’t you just deal and be happy for your friend?”
Tony pressed another button on his clicker to show what it would look like if the Synergy device was used improperly. The holographic image turned an assortment of contrasting colors while shaking uncontrollably.
“I miss you, Steve. We used to talk all the time. Now I never hear from you…” Bucky sounded hurt which made Steve feel terrible.
