He waved a hand around as he pointed out certain architectural features. The group came out on the other end of the walkway into the one of the main buildings. As they entered, they were met with the sounds of a few wedding guests walking around and enjoying the resort amenities.
Sam smiled. “I know this sounds contrived, but this will work itself out. You and Tony are great together. Right, Buck?” He glanced over at Bucky who looked unamused.
“Rhodes, it’s more than fine. I know that,” Tony shook his head a few times as he interrupted Rhodey, “and Banner is a fine substitute.” He tried, half-grimacing as he thought about the upcoming weekend.
“Showtime.” Tony jogged over to the table where Steve was working with the Synergy device and picked it up before exiting the lab. Steve followed closely behind him.
Tony turned around with a smile and a lime La Croix. “Here ya go.” He held the can up for Steve as best as he could, but Steve was holding him too close to his body.
“I’m pretty sure I was a big baby last night because of the trip.” Tony attempted to joke, but Rhodey frowned.
Tony grinned. “The
“Of course! They demoted Pluto a while back.” Tony explained out loud as he let Peter put the mask on his face.
“…I should have had you in there with me during that meeting…just to collaborate whether I sound paranoid…” Tony finally volunteered slowly.
Steve blushed from the comment, turning just as red as Ned had been. It felt great knowing that Tony had talked with Peter about their relationship.
Steve gawked at the robot before looking back at Peter and Tony then back at the robot.
Considering the intercompany politics, Obadiah had to be involved: there was no way Selvig and Loki could tinker with the device’s mechanical wiring without confidential project information that had been distributed to the committee. And unless Fury and Pepper were also conspiring behind his back, Tony placed all his bets on Obadiah being the missing link. He just hoped waiting to gather more information on Obadiah didn’t lead to another unfortunate incident.
Access codes to lab have not been disclosed. Need to proceed with plan B. Whatever you think is best, however proceed with the utmost caution. Will send the device dossier in a secure package. And wipe all email traces.
“…the Synergy device is more than capable of replicating the materials you’ll need to diffuse it.” Fury concluded.
“Fury,” Tony barged back onto the helm, “it’s the tech expo thing on Roosevelt Island. Thanos had Obie take the weapon there.”
Tony chuckled. “J.A.R.V.I.S., run the sequence,
Sam scrunched up his face. “My read? What do you mean?”
A bit later, Tony found himself alone in the kitchen with Pepper, chatting about everything besides work.
As soon as Steve entered the café, he spotted Sharon sitting at a table in the front corner of the shop. She saw him immediately as he entered, waving with a smile. Steve smiled back awkwardly before joining her. As soon as he reached the table, Sharon got up from her chair to give him a hug before sitting back down.
witness protection or whatever…” Loki demanded, although he had no leverage this time.
Steve’s weekly routine consisted of spending five days out of the week, sometimes six, at the public defender’s office in Brooklyn and taking the subway to Morningside to teach a class at Columbia’s law school once a week. It seemed as if Steve was headed in the direction he had always intended with his life. However, despite all the professional success and opportunities, Steve found it difficult to get over Tony.
Tony rested both hands on his hips. “What do you want me to say, Steve?”
, Cap?” He repeated.
All eyes turned to Steve and Tony as the huddled group realized that the photographer had mistaken them for a couple. Both Steve and Tony quickly glanced at each other, both turning red before awkwardly shuffling to the right. Tony almost tripped and Steve took a hold of his arm before he fell over, adding more to the palpable tension.
Obadiah looked away from Tony at the door leading into the conference room before returning his gaze.
Natasha had been shuffling around a bit to get Clint to give her some space, but for some reason Clint was too unaware or preoccupied with the size of the room to notice that he was smothering his friend. Steve watched Natasha glance toward the other side of the room in between shuffles. He turned slightly to see that she was watching Bruce, who looked extremely uncomfortable. Steve thought maybe he could finally ask Tony what was going on between those two; he felt that he had gotten close enough with his lab mate to discuss more personal subjects along with their favorite things.
busy that I probably won’t get a chance to sit them down until another week or so…I mean Pepper already knows we’re seeing each other. Wouldn’t be surprised if Fury and Obie are already aware. Just gotta be transparent or whatever.” This time Tony managed to make his statement sound like a joke toward the end which prompted a smile from Steve.
Steve finally emerged from his bedroom, a little later than normal for him, even on the weekends. He hadn’t been sleeping well the last few nights; the fight he was having with Tony had worsened and he continued to scold himself for being the cause of it and not clearly explaining why he did what he did.
Tony meandered through the restaurant, instantly spotting Rhodey at their table. Tony waved as he walked over. The two friends were meeting for breakfast at one of the resort’s many and diverse restaurants.
Tony barely nodded back, that sinking feeling forming in the pit of his stomach as he began over speculating what Steve might be referring to at such an inopportune time.
Mr. Beck coolly clasped his hands together. “The policy at the school dictates that for any serious academic offense, we speak to the parent, parents, or,” he looked directly at Steve and Tony, “guardian or guardians of the student in person.”
As soon as Tony settled the bill, they walked to Steve’s apartment, mostly discussing Synergy. Suddenly, Tony, out of the corner of his eye, as Steve unlocked the front door to the building, spotted a motorcycle parked near some of the resident cars. He looked on curiously as he walked toward it, noticing that it was sporting a small decal representing Steve’s unit from when he was in the army.
Tony smiled through the kiss as he managed to pull Steve toward his bedroom. He walked ahead of Steve, trying to get to the room as quickly as possible, yet too stunned to comprehend that he was finally going to be with his crush.
“Natasha is super nice!” Peter exclaimed.
“Oh, you have
“…Tony? What…happened?”
After a while Tony finally nodded back. “Yeah, sure that sounds great.”
“Steve…” Tony started, letting Steve pull him nearer to his body.
Steve patted Tony on the back. “The newest iteration of Synergy is the best it’s ever been.”
Tony barely acknowledged him as he began sobbing quietly with his head in his hands. He could hardly function after it was discovered that the Synergy device had been the cause of the explosion. Not only did it almost kill Steve, but the device was becoming more of a liability for the company.
The room went noticeably quiet as Shuri then tapped on the tracker again, slowly and carefully, to find the weapon’s precise location.
“Steve!” Tony ran back into the bedroom, looking around frantically until he found Steve on the floor next to the bed helpless.
“Okay, I know I look so lame.” Steve added.
Sam rose from the table, rapping on it lightly with his knuckles. “Nothing’s going to be solved tonight. Let’s get dinner then see a movie.”
Yet, despite all of this, Steve remembered the good times with Tony which outweighed anything else. He also never felt close to anyone like he had with Tony; Steve could be vulnerable with Tony. Tony was there for him when he needed him. They had always been there for each other.
Steve back away from the elevator so that Bucky wouldn’t collide into him. “Uh, well…”
“If you don’t want people to think you’re messing around with Tony, maybe you shouldn’t have him spend the night.”
Tony shrugged. “I’m always fine with pizza.” The comment caused Peter to nod emphatically in agreement.
“Well,” Thanos began, “if you seem to know everything, you don’t need for me to inform you.”
“Will you excuse me for second?” Tony nodded at Obadiah before walking briskly away from both men.
Tony cleared his throat before trying again. “I, uh, had a nice time with you tonight. Thank you for having dinner with me.” He glanced over at Steve who was looking back at him.
The robot blinked an array of colors before straightening up in its restraints. Both Tony and Peter backed away about a foot or so, however, both were transfixed by the robot’s potential mobility. The robot rose from its restraints, rocking forward before turning its head side to side.
“Talk!” Tony shoved the tablet further into Loki’s face which stopped him from laughing.
“I’m going to look through those legal documents before going to bed. Should I meet you in the lab the same time tomorrow?” Steve waved goodbye as he turned to leave.
“Okay, are you ready now?” He grinned.
They hugged each other for a minute or so, both gasping for air, before Tony let go to sink down on the other side of the tub. Both Steve and Tony looked at each other: Tony’s hair was damp and messed up in a way that made Steve smile uncontrollably.
Tony looked at Steve, thankful he didn’t try to hug him, before looking away once more, sighing heavily. He wanted to believe Steve that this could work, but the reason they were in the mess they were currently in was because he got scared and ran away. He wanted to tell Steve that, especially in light of what Sam told him at the press event, but Steve was with someone else and he was right when he had told Tony he had missed his chance to make things right.
Bucky sipped from his mug again. “The resort staff forgot to change the living arrangements at the last minute and put Tony and Steve in a couple suite.”
Tony chuckled as he went back to work. “It’s fine. A friend of mine is watching him tonight.” Tony figured he didn’t need to elaborate on who the “friend” was. Besides, would Steve even care? They were just having dinner at his place like how Tony had been daydreaming about all day.
Tony nodded as he tried to consider the suggestion, even though he was still incredibly frustrated with Steve. Bruce quickly changed the topic of conversation to Peter, much to Tony’s relief. They chatted a bit longer before Bruce said goodnight before heading home.
Peter and Ned cheered as their robot finally completed sentences.
Bruce slowly nodded as he let out a sigh. “Tony, to be honest, I’m not really sure why you ended things with Steve in the first place…I know you thought your past would ruin your relationship, but you guys were great together…I’m just glad you recognize that now.”
“Tony…” Steve panted, “I don’t think I can last much longer…sorry…”
“Actually, I’m glad you’re here, Banner. I think we should start out as early as possible,” Tony shuffled some files on his desk, “the quicker we get in, the quicker we can get out.”
Steve reached out his hand to shake Rhodey’s. “And this is Steve Rogers.” Tony finished.
Tony shook his head again before backing up one step. “I don’t know…the device won’t generate the detonator.”
“I was out of line. You wouldn’t have said what you said if I hadn’t spoken to you that way…” Steve looked downward at Tony, smiling, but his expression was pained.
Steve nodded; his smiled widened with relief. “Okay, great.”
Tony shrugged; he didn’t want Steve to think he was pulling away. He was mostly concerned that he would turn into an emotional wreck in front of him.
Natasha lowered the helicopter so that the team could help Steve and Tony inside before they flew straight to Mount Liberty.
“Despite those unfortunate mishaps,” the board member took her time drinking out of her glass, “I think you’re all doing a fabulous job, Mr. Rogers.”
“That’s right. CEO Virginia Potts will be on later to talk about the rebuilding effort.”
Rhodey rolled his eyes as Tony let go off him. He looked around the restaurant, spotting Steve making his way over.
“Although the first time we kissed was hands down
“Should we, uh…” Steve started again with a contained laugh, “go to the bedroom…?” To Tony, Steve’s voice sounded strangely tentative.
Steve smiled back, retaining a tender expression. To him, Tony no longer appeared upset about the kiss, yet Steve remained wary; he told himself to wait for Tony to continue.
“Buck’s going to be
The press pool began clamoring for more answers as both Rhodey and Bruce fielded their own questions. Tony kept his eyes on Steve; his expression was soft, yet it was accompanied by an affected grin.
Natasha turned slightly to glare at Clint who immediately took the hint.
Steve nodded as he walked up to Tony to give him a hug. “We have so much to clean up.”
Crisis adverted!
The groan to himself felt excruciating.
The only thing that was keeping them together was Synergy and now that that had fallen through—mostly because of Tony—what was the reason to keep Steve in such a failure of a relationship? Steve could have anyone; Tony knew that Steve cared about him, but he could be with someone better than Tony. Someone who hadn’t made so many dangerous enemies.
Tony laughed quietly to himself at the last statement that was more of a thought than anything. Steve looked even more disappointed, but then Tony told himself not to get hung up on it as he tried to explain.
Peggy looked at Steve for a moment, she was angry at him for he had been doing and it will be a struggle to forgive him for a while. But she can tell he’s been struggling and has obviously hasn’t received the right help, “Well first off you need to seek out professional help, then you need to work your way back to the leader you use to be and then maybe you’ll be able to apologise to Tony the right way and who knows you could start over with him” she said firmly but also with kindness in her voice.
Hope you like this one, now it’s going to be more interesting from now on, let me know what you hope to see in any future chapters
“But I thought you and Steve are on better terms, aren’t you romantically bonded?” Thor ask innocently.
After the birthday incident thing became tense around the tower, Tony felt alone. But it seems he’s not quite alone as he thought.
Clint just shook his head and chuckled, “ don’t get all defensive cap, we understand that you’re human and needed a little me time. Sure it’s with Stark, but if the rumours are true I’m sure he gave to a run for your money uh”.
But anyways Rogers was speaking and tony didn’t really listen was thinking about last night, but he listen to the last part of what Rogers was saying “.....you should try and be like us that might actually help you and it might even benefit the team dynamic if you try and be as healthy like the rest of us Stark”.
“I love you too dad” Tony said in a whisper and as Howard physical form started to vanish Tony could hear his dad saying “goodbye Anthony” then everything went white.
But as peaceful as it is, Tony has work to do, “right here we go” he said to himself. Tony walks into the woodland area, when he comes to this place he always drawn to the woods, he never knows why exactly but he always conclude that this is where his soul is located.
But instead of giving tony an answer, Rogers lean down and kissed tony again, it wasn’t gentle by all means, it was rough and lustful. Then Rogers pulled back and smirk down at tony “I think that gives you an answer, but yet it might not. Anyways I better go thanks for the talk Stark I think we understand each other better now” then he walk out shutting the door behind him. Tony was stunned to say the least what did he mean but yet again he guess Rogers wants a second round, well fine by him if this keeps Rogers happy and not shout at him then so be it and hey at least it’s good sex so a win win situation.
“Don’t you DARE, how dare you all insulting my DAD like this. You all know nothing about him so how can you judge HIM!” he shouts not realising what he has revealed.
“Hey J is Thor awake by any chance?” He asked his AI
Well fuck my life, Tony thought. Since that lovely visit from Fury things turned in a rather strange turn.
[Back at the tower]
He continues to giggle which Steve found adorable and also made him laugh. They never laugh together and well Steve enjoyed Tony’s laugh and wanted to hear it more.
So they talked and talked about everything, his dad told him though not in graphic detail, but still told him how his birth came to be. It was hard to listen and upsetting to, but after weeks went Tobias excepted what has happen in the past and tried to move on and be there for his dad.
Enjoy 😊
His open without so much as a knock on the door, he not nervous as he ready his pistol. “Relax Nick it’s just me” Peggy said calmly.
But other than that hope you like this one and sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
Rogers just smirk at him probably admiring his own handy work after all they did fuck throughout the night.
Steve humourlessly chuckle “yeah. I just hurt so much and I know this isn’t an excuse and I should have known better but Tony was just... was just” “easy to direct your anger towards” Peggy again finished the sentence. Steve could only shake his head in agreement, god he was such a mess.
But it had to wait he needed to go and he also got the gala tonight too. Tony sighed and looked at Steve “Ok, we won’t argue or whatever we do that isn’t the norm, but I can’t today got things to do you see. But I promise we can talk tomorrow, is that okay?” He asked with uncertainty.
Please feel free to comment or kudos
Steve didn’t know how to answer all of that, in fact he wondered what happen to that man himself. He took a moment to think then answers “I ur.... I think that man was lost” Yeah I think that’s right Steve thought. He was looking down ashamed to look at Peggy, but he can feel her eyes on him.
Tony Sighs “believe it or not Bruice bear I didn’t do anything” he told Bruce.
He wasn’t a team player. It was simple work together on the mission and listen to the leader, which was Steve. But does stark listen, no he does the exact opposite and goes rouge and puts everyone in danger.
Clearly he’s hear for a different reason Fury thought, but first need to deal with these two idiots. He look at Romanoff straight in the eyes and simply said “No”.
Fury sigh god he hopes others should be here soon so these idiots can get their heads out of there ass. Speaking of the others, Agent Barton and Doctor Banner have just arrived.
Both the agents nodded, they seen their director like this before not about a person. Both of them didn’t know what to make of this was Fury right, have they misjudged Stark.
Tony froze for a moment, What! that can’t be true there’s no way that can be true. Did Daniel have something to do with it, do the avengers think I killed them surly not. “What do you mean dead?” he rasp.
Howard was looking at him with what appears to be joy but yet sadness as well. “I’ve been waiting for you for quite some time now, but I’m glad you made it” Howard softly said as he step closer to Tony.
Tobias heard the elevator door open and with joy on his face he saw his grandmother. “Grandma, here let me help” he said as he rushed up towards his grandmother to help her to the couch, “oh darling now, now you didn’t have to get up on my account I’m still able to function like a normal person you know” she gently chastised her grandson.
Tony didn’t know what to do or what to say he turned to his son who looked guilty and mouthed sorry to him. Tony didn’t want to see his Bambi scared so he placed a comforting hand on his boys arms and gently squeezed as a sign of comfort.
Rogers was trying to order him to come back, but that was pointless tony just wanted to go somewhere safe and it was only one place he could have think of.
The doctors also told them that they can leave any time as Natasha didn’t need to stay for over night observation.
The trio hope to get there way but they were soon mistaken.
“ when we were looking at my old files there were some old houses that was under Daniels family, but when we looked into it further there was no lead” Davis informs them through the video call.
So after that commotion, things turned even more strange, SHEILD rebuild its self and Fury came back to life and decide to make the avengers a things and he (force) politely ask Tony to place the avengers at his tower and Tony reluctantly said yes as despite what people say he was a team player in a sense that it would make sense for everyone to be in the same place even if Tony didn’t like most of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry sir, but Mr Thor would like to speak with you, he said it’s important” Jarvis replied. Tony was curious as to why Thor wanted to talk, but he always has time for him so... “let warrior bro in J” he said.
Hope you guys are safe and well
Hope you like this chapter
So tony nodded he needed to make it up for pepper they may not be together anymore but he does care for her greatly she is apart of his family after all. “ yeah sure thing pep” he smiled and pepper smiled back.
“Uh, my apologies.” Obadiah took a handkerchief out of his breast pocket to wipe the beads of sweat off his forehead, “I’ve seemed to forgotten that our esteemed CEO, Virginia Potts, has a few words to say…”
Pepper stared at Tony as he walked into the elevator, making it evident that she didn't believe him, but she let it go with a nod.
“Hey, I’m staying over at Tony’s tonight.”
Tony laughed as he hugged Steve back. “We’ll take care of it tomorrow, baby.”
Steve smiled before letting go of Tony’s shoulder. “I did.”
Tony shook his head, trying to keep cool. “I don’t know, Rogers. I’ve never seen this before…”
Tony laughed as he leaned back in the tub. “Fucking amazing?”
Tony nodded back, nearly half-grimacing. “So, how do you know Steve?” He asked, hoping by some miracle they were just friends.
“Like diffusing an explosive?” Tony joked.
Steve nodded again. He reached out a hand to caress Tony’s cheek.
Tony glanced at Steve. He was smiling; his facial expression was its usual soft and inviting countenance. Tony sighed in his head before finally climbing into the bed with Steve. He settled next to him, body near the edge. He heard Steve say something else, but something about how soft Steve’s bed was and how worked up he had been since the weekend forced his body to give into exhaustion. He drifted off to sleep next to Steve with his phone fully charged next to the bed.
“Ugh, fuck…” Tony interjected.
Steve laughed, feeling as if a huge weight had been lifted. “Well, the bridal party thing is still at T’Challa’s private resort on Long Island. He’s airlifting us in with private planes.”
“Tony, I don’t want to make assumptions about your relationship with Steve, but you have no idea that’ll happen.” Tony could sense the sincerity in his friend’s voice, but it didn’t help.
Steve waited near the door before joining Tony on the edge of the bed. He took a moment before addressing him again.
“Obie, you’re very quiet.” Tony eventually observed aloud with a slight edge to his voice although he was sure not biting enough to make the situation any more uncomfortable than it already could be.
Steve nodded. The two were facing each other on their sides. “…during my last relationship…I don’t know…we really didn’t do much…
“Yes.” J.A.R.V.I.S. answered back.
Tony sighed as he looked up at the sink counter. He closed his eyes, trying to remind himself about all the good times he’s had with Steve. Yet, as the sinking feeling returned, all he could think about was their relationship falling apart like his past ones.
“I mean, how was your first day
When he finally reached the glass doors, Steve spotted Tony inside whose back was facing the entrance. His lab partner was standing with his arms crossed. He was wearing clothes similar to the clothes he wore yesterday, but this time he was also sporting a pair of headphones. Tony’s head was bobbing up and down to the tune filtering through his ears. As Steve inched closer toward the glass façade, he could hear dull thumping from the base on Led Zepplin’s “Kashmir” percolating through the material.
They both stared at each other until the elevator stopped and the door opened. Tony shoved his hands into his pockets as he huddled into a corner, and Steve rubbed a hand through his hair. Tony swore underneath his breath as soon as he realized he had taken the employee express elevator and
The comment forced Tony to stare at Steve. His eyes were already red from the small pool of tears forming.
Steve shook his head as best as he could considering that he was lying face down. His breath hitched as he felt Tony grab his ass again before squeezing it. He heard Tony squirt more lube into his hand. He felt Tony rub his body a few times before he felt a hand drawing nearer. Steve squeezed his eyes shut as he felt Tony rub him a little with the tip of his finger.
Bruce nodded slowly. “I’m sure it was tough seeing Steve again...”
Tony readjusted his sitting position in his chair, expressing that he was irritated with having such a petty conversation with Obadiah of all people so early in the afternoon.
Pepper nodded enthusiastically. “Of course, Tony. I would love that.”
Steve looked to be considering the idea before he answered, smiling shyly. “I would love to, but I didn’t bring an overnight bag with me and we have to work tomorrow.”
Tony inhaled sharply as his sometimes-personal doctor and friend, Stephen Strange, shook his head before turning around to close his medical bag. Tony let his feet dangle back and forth while he stayed put on top of his desk. Both men were in Tony’s Stark Industries office.
Sam sighed, but he smiled at Bucky. “You know how Steve is. He cares about the people closest to him, but I think he would like it better if you told him what was up instead of being weird around Tony.”
Tony lingered before stepping to the side to let Thor into the room. Thor stopped at the threshold of the door before walking up to Loki who recoiled in his chair as his brother approached. Thor shook his head before standing on the other side of the room.
Tony pointed toward the chip in Steve’s hand before walking around the conference table to retrieve his work bag.
Both Tony and the intern were laughing loudly at whatever Tony was joking about. Steve took a moment before approaching them; he could feel the palm of his hands sweating and his cheeks becoming flush. He watched Tony glance over in his general direction, smiling widely as he finished his sentence. Steve could feel his patience rapidly fall to an all-time low, however, all those times fantasizing about what he would say to Tony when they finally saw each other again were forgotten in the moment.
Tony watched them leave, smiling to himself before jogging after them. “Also, what the heck is a ‘healthy’ pizza?”
After the ceremony, they found Steve speaking with one of his professors. He waved at them as soon as he spotted them. With a handshake, Steve greeted Tony first.
“Rogers,” he began in a low whisper, practically dragging Steve down the hallway again, “you need to relax. They’re arms dealers. They’re not people persons.” He tried lightheartedly, but the joke fell completely flat with Steve.
“Steve,” Steve looked downward to see that Peter was tugging at his pants, “…you can sit next to me.”
Everyone was on edge at that point, even though tony and some of the team don’t get along, however they do agree that a civilian should not be harmed in anyway.
In fact he was pleased he cared for Peggy deeply, after all she save his life. So it’s best suited that he in return help Peggy by protecting her son even if it’s the people that live in his home.
With sheer anger, thor glares at Steve and within a split second he stands up and grabs Steve by the his t-shirt and slams him up against the wall, which caught steve by surprise. “Why do you hate Anthony so much, he has done nothing wrong to you and yet you dislike him like he’s one of our enemies. You use his body for your own needs but you don’t ask him what he wants, you slate his name like you know him for years but yet you know him through a piece of paper rather than talk to him like a person. What kind of leader are you to treat him like that” He roars.
Steve was shock at tony he didn’t expect to be nice to him, maybe this was his change to get to know the man without all the tense and shouting.
Hope you like this chapter and I apologise for any misspellings or bad grammar
TBC........
She knew that her review on Stark was accurate.
“Well Anthony, you may have master in seeing, but there was one little thing I forgot to mention to you. You see with your abilities you can enhance other areas of your body to help you, the gift my mother gave you was like an energy you could say, you could direct it to any area at will with the right training of course” Thor informed.
Tony gasps for air, as he jumps out of his bed and hits the floor.
Fury chuckle “of course you do” he said kindly and motion her to sit next to him, “let’s see these then” he said to her and Peggy chuckle and walk towards the empty chair.
Hope you like the chapter and I will see you next time
Daniel grunted so his Anthony told them all about him, well no matter they could use to their advantage.
1.......
Steve look down in shame he knows he hurt Tony and he will do anything to fix and to start is to swallow down his pride and help Tony into tracking down this scum bag first. “Ok” he spoke softly and Tony nodded and then starts to walk away. Steve knows that he should keep some distance with Tony but something inside him tells him otherwise “Wait, can I come with you” Steve said suddenly, Tony stop in his tracks and look back at Steve “uh, why do you want to do that?” He questions “surly you should go and see the spy twins at the crime scene”.
That what Natasha heard first, then the smell of burning tires, metal and even human flesh (she will never get use to that smell). She was slowly coming out of her haze, she can feel pain in her shoulder most likely dislocated and pain in her leg (feels like burns).
Daniel is out there, plotting his revenge.
Steve help Tony to his feet and held him close, “So ur... what happened?” Steve nervously asked. “There’s so much to explain, but to put it simply I found my soul and now I can use my abilities to its full potential” he said. Steve was happy for Tony “that’s great news...um so what was your soul like?” He asked another question.
Steve could only shack his head in agreement he didn’t want to open his mouth to say anything else that Fury could find offensive. Fury just grunted “Good now get the hell out of my sight” he shouted and with no further agreements Steve bolted out the room.
He was narcissistic, he always talked about himself. Always brag about how great his life was, how he can get anything he ever wanted, god it aggravated her.
Tony talked and talked about the events of last night. He told Tobias about everything even prior to last night, Thor, the training and lily. He and his son were both emotional at the end, they cried and hugged for a while after that.
[outside the tower]
“Well Rogers this is my tower and I owned this kitchen, so excuse me I’d like to use my facilities” tony snark
She guess that Clint just wanted to take his frustrations out on someone who is from the same social group. Both of them know that he was in the wrong and Natasha will have to talk to him about seeing a therapist again once this is all over.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
God this was such a messed up situation, the man who was his childhood friend, a man who brutally raped him for some kind of fucked up revenge is now escape from prison and possibly planning another sort of fuck up revenge on him.
“Where are we thor?” Tony ask
John smile drop and stared sadly at the door “please stay safe” he whispered.
Daniel gives him a sinister smirk and a deep chuckle. “Oh Tony you have no idea how badly I want to hurt you” He then proceeded to spread Tony’s legs wider and thrust in one fluid motion.
The door behind him open which brought Tony out of his thoughts and looked behind him and he was surprise to be Rogers that open the door.
Tony roll his eyes and motions Steve to follow him, he feel Steve happiness from behind him and it was annoying him, but he can’t help but smile a little maybe this was a good first step for them.
And of course Natasha his friend had suffered in the hands of the red room and, Steve lost his entire life. And stark, he just had everything, got the money and the life style and never had to work for it.
Both of them calm down from their laughter and just look at each other, Tony felt something there for a moment but he couldn’t quite figure it out, what was this feeling?
Tony smirk and challenge “ well why don’t you show me Rogers or are you too.... wha hey!” Before he could finish Rogers in one swift motion lift up tony and tore his very expensive pants off until he was bare. And before tony could complain two fingers were shoved into his mouth. “Suck” Rogers demanded and so tony did, he doesn’t want Rogers to fuck him dry.
The one thing you should never do is piss off thor.
Now to some people this might be luxurious, but to Tony this is rather tacky. “Fuck” Tony whispers to himself, he needs to get out of here as soon as possible.
They tried to speak but fury wouldn’t let them “I swear to god if you try to interrupt me I’ll fucking through you out off here do you  understand” He ask in annoyance. They all nodded.
“Tony” Steve said worryingly as he notice and plane heading at there direction how did they not notice that invisible shield maybe, Tony’s eyes widen as he notice something “GET DOWN” he shouts and a small missile hits the tower causing a small explosion.
Thor just nodded and decided to join the other in conversation, whilst they were doing that Tony looked out the window and wondered what today’s event going to be like, he hope it goes well, it has to for his and there sake.
The trio were taken aback from the tone that their director voice, it sounded that he didn’t like what they were saying, but that couldn’t be right, right?

“I should have chased you, hell I should have listen to you in the first place and never took you to that fucking club. You should of stayed home were I could kept you safe and happy but in stead of being an egotistical jerk that I was.. I’m just so sorry Anthony” this was when Howard started to cry and Tony never saw him cry not even once. Was this even real? Was this all in his head? Tony couldn’t tell.
Speaking of Tony, he and his son Tobias went to the penthouse to spend time together before Tony went off to his training. Steve really wanted to speak to Tony but he knows it will be the wrong time now, and they needed to separate themselves for awhile, which made Steve sad but he knows this is the right thing to do now they can talk later.
Tobias locked himself in his room, crying into his pillow, wondering if what his dad said was true and his mom was this type of monster. But how could that have happen and why did that happen, he wanted to know but at the same time he didn’t want to face reality at that moment.
What do you guys think and what would you like to see in the next chapter ?
Hello everyone sorry I took so long to do a new chapter I just been on holiday so I’ve been rather slow on writing this up.
Overall stark is a selfish, spoiled bastard and Clint hates that and no one can change his mind.
And turns out he does pay for it, the super secret boy band, band together and fight like a team and they won, it was quite spectacular actually, Tony confronts Loki like a bad ass and almost gets mind controlled but doesn’t some how again tony needs to figure that out.
Fury’s eyes widen in shock, he stood up quickly and speed walk towards Peggy, “What! Since when I didn’t agree to this, Peggy answer me” he shouts. But Peggy just chuckle as she continue to walk, “I trust you Nicky I know you do right by him if I’m not around, anyways I must go bye Nicky” she tease.
Rogers didn’t slow down as he was chasing his own orgasm and continue his brutal pace, until tony heard him moan, then Rogers stilled for a moment as his seed was covering Tony’s walls.
But then all the shit comes back again two years later, SHEILD wanted him to be there consultant, well fuck them Tony wanted to say. But Pepper his beautiful girlfriend, the light of his life manage to change his mind and what do you know he was thrilled. A derange Demi god comes to earth and wants a war, well that got Tony’s curious mind going, so tony decides to help and went to Germany were all the drama was happening and along the way he meet, the lovely spy herself and her spy man friend , a man with anger issues who turns into a green monster,that tony loves and later they become bros, another demi god who is much lager and more attractive than his rock of ages brother and of course there was the 90 year old super solider who comes back from the dead that his old man wanted more than him what a fucking treat that was.
A couple minutes later Thor enters the lab with a concern look on his face. “Anthony where have you been Steven said that you insulted a lady and left the gala rather abruptly what happen?” He frantically ask.
He was sitting in his office looking at the plans that his agents and himself have thought out, it was coming together smoothly. Sure Anthony got his family in his tower but no matter they are not important right now, what is important is making sure he can tear the Avengers apart and then finally he will have what he wanted his sweet boy.
Once he got to Starks floor, he walk toward the bedroom. He knock on the door, “you can come in you know” Stark spoke through the door. God stark can so obnoxious Steve thought, he considered not going in. But then again.
The general grunted “you better make sure you do not fail, remember our deal Captain” he spoke once more and then walked away.
Once he reach Thor’s floor, Steve proceeds to knock on his door then waits.
~~~~~~~~~~~
He nods his head and gestures to them to sit it’s going to be a long story.
“ why yes sir, it seems Master Thor has been up for the last hour should I notify him that you want to see him?” Jarvis replied
After an hours drive Tony finally made it to the house, his looked old but homely in a way and it reminded Tony of his moms old house that he use to stay at and where his son was raised.
TBC........
So yeah Davis was one of them and even help tony train when his mom couldn’t and also help train his son too, he was grateful and Davis was apart of there family circle. But recently he hasn’t been in contact for several months, but now he resurfaced tony might need to make a little visit himself.
“I’m sure big guy, I want to do this” tony simply said.
He sighed he doesn’t need them he has Thor and maybe Bruce they are science bros after all. “I think about it Bambi” he smiled to his son and Tobias in turn smiled back.
TBC........
“What’s going on captain, why are you here really, it seems you came here for a different reason?” Fury asked calmly.
Hope you like this one and hope our going to be intrigued about what fury will say to the trio.
Hope you liked it and hope you all be excited for the next couple of chapters it’s going to be a rough ride for Tony and the gang
Tony slowly turned around and suck a sharp breath at the woman who hurt him all those years ago. “It’s been a long time Tony, I was hoping we can talk” lily that was her name Tony remembers. That same woman you beat him, that same woman who fucking raped him along with Daniel and those two other guys, this bitch who tried to ruin his life but instead gave him a beautiful son.
Anyways hope you liked it and I’ll see you all for the next chapter
“ I also know who killed them and why they did it” Fury stated, which interests the team.
“Ur thanks cap, you didn’t scare me I don’t get scared easily, but thanks for the concern and as you can see I am peachy” he spoke trying to sound confident but he wasn’t sure if he pulled it off.
Thor told that he should stop as the training they did would drain too much energy for Tony which could lead him to collapse. He agreed as he wanted to go a see his son, he even promise Thor that’ he could even meet his Bambi at some point.
Thor and Steve were starting to get anxious at how Tony was taking so long in his meditation state. “Does this always take this long?” Steve asks, this gives him a death glare from Thor “sometimes but Im going to take this as a good sign that he’s gone pass his pervious barriers” he said bluntly. Now Steve was nervous he knows that Thor might actually kill since that while incident, he wasn’t to calm the tension between them “Look Thor I just want to say that I’m...” “Steven now it’s not the time so please just be quiet” Thor growls, Steve immediately shuts up and waits.
Again sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar enjoy.
Hope you all are doing well and see you soon 😊
(See the end of the chapter for
With Peggy she was beautiful, inside and out. She had the confidence that nobody else had, she was funny, snarky and intelligent no one else can be like her.
“Bruce” Steve said in a panic and he saw Bruce fall unconscious. He turns towards Tony who is also knock out, that wasn’t the only thing he saw there was a large man standing over Tony wearing a gas mask, “there you are” Steve heard the man say. The man picks up Tony in bridal style, then he saw Steve was still awake “ah Captain still hanging in there I see” the man teases. Steve tried to get up he needs to save Tony, “leave him alone you’re not taking him anywhere” he sneers.
The Avengers have made their plan of action, but Steve needs to figure out what he needs to do and there might be a little talk with a certain someone.
Whilst Tony ponder he realise needed to protected his other family too. Pepper, Rhodey, Davis, and... ah shit his mom. He needs to get her at his tower no way in hell he’s going to leave her at that home god knows what Daniel would do if he knew his mom was there.
So in Bruce’s perspective tony has good and bad characteristics and no one can change his mind.
All three stood close together, “here we go” Thor announces as he lifts up his hammer and before Steve’s eyes a white bright light engulfs around him.
Tony was surprise that she wanted to give him something he usually didn’t want his mom to that, “mom you don’t have get me a present” Tony replies back.
“Sure thing J and how do I look by the way?” He ask with a smirk. “You look impeccable as always sir” JARVIS replied with a hint is sass to it. “Aw J you always know the right things to say” Tony tease “well sir you did program me” he sass back.
So a quick warning there is mention of rape in this chapter.
The night was peaceful tonight, the dark sky was clear and the stars were shining. This reminds him when He was younger, his mom would take him to a little cabin that his grandfather owned, its located in Canada in the middle of the woods it was very peaceful from what Tony remembered.
“Ouch... what the fuck was that for?” He asked, Natasha gave him a dark look. “Listen you idiot what Steve said was too far and you shouldn’t have jump to conclusions” she growled.
~~~~~~
Steve a blush little bit at Clint’s words, “uh yeah I guess you can say that. Look I don’t really like Stark, we are not lovers, partners or whatever romantic thing you like to think, it’s just sex, it’s good for the both of us really. We don’t shout as much at each other as we use to do and we are more civil which is good for the team, I am not jealous that he may or may not be sleeping with other people” Steve stressed.
So just a quick note
Steve was shock at Thor’s anger, why would thor defend Stark like that. Did Thor really think that about him. “ Thor listen, you got to understand that Stark is disobedient selfish man, you got to see that. Tell me one thing that tony has done that you think he deserves respect?” He challenged.
But he doesn’t want the nightmares anymore and he doesn’t want the tense between them. After a few minutes of debating with himself, he finally made up his mind. He walk out the kitchen and got the elevator “ Jarvis can you take me to Starks floor please” Steve ask, “of course captain” Jarvis replied.
And also apologies for any misspellings or bad grammar
But Fury just rolled his eye, “Yes agent Barton I did listen and it’s clear to me that you are the ones that have been disrespectful towards Stark. Agent Romanoff when I have you that assignment, it wanted to know what was going on with Stark, but the real reason why I gave that to you. Was to see you’re a better agent like I thought you would be, but you let your judgment of him clouded over the mission that made you compromise” he ranted
Tony was tired and it was nearing the end of the event, so Tony decided that he deserved a little break from. So he excuse himself from the crowd and walk outside to the balcony.
Now tony was piss Rogers doesn’t know nothing about him, “oh really and what’s that spangles” he asked
“Why so scared Tony, aren’t you having fun” the Male whisper was closer to him now. Tony panic, he kept flailing his arm to try to push him away, but to no avail.
Thor frowns at Steve’s words, “ why do you want to speak about Anthony, is he alright?” He said with worry. Steve shook his head, “ no stark is fine I think I haven’t spoken to him for a while. Look thor I’m going to be direct with you and stark seem to be rather close all of the sudden, are you two by any chance imitate with one an other?”.
He does care for Anthony and no one can change his mind.
“But Sir I think....”
“Sir I’m afraid that Captain Rogers is still asking to speak you, he’s not taking no for an answer. He also said that he will wait all night until you let him in Sir” Jarvis reply’s
Howard had a look of shock and guilt in his face ‘too fucking late for that Tony thought’. “ I’m so sorry Anthony, I wish... I wish I could go back and fix my mistakes that I did to you, I thought at the time if I push you to a certain point you’ll become a great success and surpass me that’s how my father taught me. But I realise that was wrong and what my own father did to me was abuse and in turn I became him which I wish I never wanted to become” Howard takes a shaky breath “ I... I shouldn’t have left you I was an idiot and a coward I didn’t want to face that had happen to you and knowing it was my fault that happen to you” Tony look confused at this point, after the rape happen he never once blamed his father for that he only blames bone for leaving but never the rape itself.
Steve shouldn’t be surprise about Starks bluntness but he was, does he want to go to his room, does he want to be fuck buddies he wasn’t sure.
Slowly but surely Tony calms down and was now focus where he was, “Jarvis hows Tobias?” He asks his AI.
Hope you all like it and apologies for any misspellings or bad grammar
“Your welcome Captain”
Will he succeed who knows
Steve sighed and look down staring at his hands “I know, your grandmother told me the same thing. I promise you that I will seek help I’ve been avoiding it for some time and it’s causing people pain and I hope you know that I’ll do anything to gain Tony’s trust back and I’ll never again hurt him like I’ve been doing you have my word Tobias.” Steve said with emotion in his eyes. Tobias looked at him for a bit, he used his abilities to see if what Rogers was saying was the truth and what he say brought a ever small smile to his face it seems that the Captain was being genuine  and that gave Tobias relief. “Thank you for being honest but this doesn’t mean i forgive you yet” he said as he stood up, Steve stood up alone side him “I know” he simply said with a smile of hope.
Thor in turn chuckled “your not very subtle Anthony, but if your intimate, why is steve not more supportive of you?” Thor ask
Tony was exhausted, all he wanted to do was go to his room and curl in his bed and pretend this was all a bad dream. But this wasn’t a dream, this was real and he has now told his past to the others, and he doesn’t know how to feel about that.
Enjoy 😊
[present day]
Hello everyone I’m back with a new chapter
“Come in” Thor booms at the other side of the door.
Oh for fuck sakes. He repeats “Oh for fuck sake Rogers how do you always know and why do to always have to get up so early?” Tony snap back
~~~~~~~~
TBC......
Oh shit.
So Tony continue “but first we are going to have a big hearty breakfast and then after that I make sure that Daniel will never hurt me or you or anyone again” he said with determination in his voice.
So cold.
“(Sigh) ok you figured it out, but it’s nothing anything more than sex ok. It’s like a stress relief you know” steve tried to defend the reasoning behind his and Starks relationship.
You see today is the 29th May, his birthday. He doesn’t like his birthday anyway since he was 13, but today the team had a mission. Fury explained, that there were hydra agents in a ‘super secret base’ blah blah blah. And their mission was to rescue captured civilians that were apparently been experimented on.
~~~~~~~~~
“I can’t believe this, why didn’t you tell us Tony?” Steve mindlessly ask. To that Tony scoff “are you serious Steve why should I you hate me and I didn’t want you to despise me more knowing who my mother is. And not only that if you somehow blab about my true heritage could you manage the scandal, the backlash of it all I will not allow my family to be harm by that” he ranted and that shut Steve up.
Please feel free to comment or kudos
Tony give a small chuckle “that I did Thor so now o can kick Daniels ass” he spoke. As he got up he slightly lost his footing and felt dizzy, he was about to fall face first on the grass until Steve caught him just in time. “Woah easy now, are you alright?” Steve questions with worry. “ My hero” Tony jokes and Steve huffs with laughter “you can thank me later okay but right now you need rest” Steve gently spoke. Tony wanted protest he needed to see what his new abilities could do but Thor jumps in first to speak “ The Captain is right Anthony we should head back to the tower and you rest for a bit, and once you’ve rested we shall continue your training as quickly as possible” Thor said and Tony sigh in defeat “ okay fine” he just said.
“Sigh” why does that not surprise him. Contrary to what people thought, Fury cared for Tony greatly, he may not show it emotional but he does care, sure he kept secrets from him like what happen to certain people in his life that damage him or that Fury was his godfather, he still remembers how Peggy actually made him Tony’s godfather it still makes him chuckle.
Bruce
Fury was relived he didn’t want anything to happen to Tony’s kid. “Good, I’ll make sure that your mom and Davis will be at the tower by morning you have my word, I see you soon ok and take care of yourself” then he hung up.
“Why?” Peggy suddenly said, Steve turn to face her with a confused look “What ..” “Why did you do it? Why were you so harsh to my boy, he’s been nothing but kind to you, sure he can be an arse but it’s not intentional it’s a mask to hide his true feelings” Peggy takes a breath. Steve wanted to speak out but Peggy hush him “what happen to the man who hated bullies? What happen to the man I once loved, the man who will protect anyone, to fight for anyone. You were once a kind hearted, understanding man, so what happen to that man Steve?” She whispers, with tears threatening to come out.
Tony pulls away from his son “right so I’ll be gone for half hour or so I’ll be back soon” he said to everyone and walks to his smaller lab. Before he disappears Steve stops him “wait what are you going to do?” He asks, Tony turns to him “just a little project that might be useful in this situation” he simply replies and walks off. Everyone just stands there not knowing what to do, until Peggy spoke “why don’t we speak to Fury and Davis they might know something by now” she said to everyone Steve’s agrees, “Jarvis put Fury on the line” He ask the AI.
Now his family was surprise at first his grandmother thought he would take over SI someday, but his dad always said he can be anything and didn’t have to follow the path that his grandfather gave his dad.
Time and now he realise it from its pain.
Thor simply smiled again, “I think it’s time I’ll tell you another story, come Anthony have a seat”.
Steve was bewildered, when he was coming here he thought he would simply talk to thor peacefully, he didn’t expect Thor to defend stark.
The man gave a sickening laugh, which made Tony to want to curl into himself even further.
It has to work, he won’t let Daniel hurt him again.
Tobias wanted to protest but he knew nothing will come of that, so sighed and nodded in agreement. “Ok dad, but please can you get the other avengers to help you I know you don’t get along with them but they could help you” his son pleas.
Tony was confused his mom and Davis never mention that, “ok if that’s true why am I just been told this now?” Tony ask.
Not only that stark disobey Steve’s orders again from there last mission and they had a very heated argument in front of the team.
Bruce turned to Tony to apologise, but Tony put his hand up as a sign to stop him. “ Don’t worry about it Brucie bear I know you didn’t mean it” he smiled and Bruce couldn’t help but smile back, Tony was always so nice to him. Now he even feels more guilty, “Don’t feel guilty Bruce I’m still your science bro aren’t I” Bruce look straight up at Tony how did he know what he was feeling, “hehe silly Banner” Hulk chimes in ‘huh’ what was that suppose to mean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fury was surprise at how Tony found out about Daniel, but right now that wasn’t the point. Despite was people thought he cares for Tony and would do anything to protect him.
He couldn’t breath, his lungs filled with ice water.
Thor was deep in thought, what tony just said about the captain, Thor will need to have a talk with him about his treatment towards Anthony. But first Anthony was the main priority here.
To Thor’s surprise Steve laughs which he felt slightly offended by. “ oh god thor that’s not what we are that’s just ridiculous. It’s just sex, something like a stress relief for the both of us, it’s easier to deal with Stark that way. I didn’t realise that you care about stark that much how come?” He said through a chuckle. Thor felt slight anger towards Steve, how dare he be disrespectful towards Anthony in front of him. He knew that some of the other avenger didn’t like Anthony, he could never understand why they do. But saying this in front of him he would not stand.
Tony grinned as he inched closer to Steve. He held a hand out but then kept it to himself. “It’s not tight enough in my humble opinion.”
There was more shouting and screaming as someone yelled that they could see someone lying on the ground in the lab.
He felt Strange place a hand on his shoulder. “Do we ever know what we’re doing? Every new event in life forces us to start over. No one is ever really good at anything unless they try.”
nice.” He turned to leer at Steve.
Steve smiled, now thinking about Tony being inside of him and how great it felt despite a little pain at first. It was nothing like anything he had ever experienced before and he definitely wanted to try it again.
“Hey, Tony.” Steve said which made Tony jump somewhat.
Fury walked to the front of the room. “Okay, first, I’ll need the team at S.H.E.I.L.D. for some debriefing…”
Thor crossed his arms in a defiant huff.
“You okay?” Steve asked as soon as they were alone, placing his hands in the front pockets of his jeans.
“Uh, yes. That was just…a friend of mine is in charge of my kid today and he was just updating me on their whereabouts…” Tony explained, stumbling.
Peter giggled with delight as he ran back toward the robot.
—that things are going to fall apart? That’s no way to live.”
Bucky stared at Tony then back down at Steve before walking to the other side of the room. He leaned up against the wall, crossing his arms. The atmosphere grew exceedingly intense and silent, filled only with the sounds from the machines keeping Steve stable. After about thirty minutes, Sam finally appeared. He rushed into the room, panting from jogging through the hospital.
Steve shrugged. He tried to remain calm. “Uh, I thought I should just let you sleep.” He attempted with a half-hearted smile.
Bruce knew Tony well from working closely with him at Stark Industries, and it was obvious that the two mirrored the other in their love of science and all things nerdy. Steve could tell from their constant banter that they were probably best friends.
Tony struggled with opening the lock because he couldn’t think clearly enough to unlock it. He could sense Steve standing right behind him before feeling two hands around his waist.
“Well…” Sam began, he squinted his eyes away from Steve who was staring intensely in his direction.
“Steve…” Tony stepped toward Steve, feeling his eyes well up with tears, “I…I…” he struggled, stopping to stand in the middle of the office.
“Yes, it’s been discovered that the company has been struggling with safety precautions since the Synergy program's inception. A source close to the program has told reporters here at Metropolis that there was a recent explosion in one of the company’s labs and a member of the team was seriously injured.”
“Who knew…” Tony started, “…it would only take getting you into bed to hear you swear?” He exhaled, trying to sound cool but he was too amazed with how he felt as he continued to cup Steve’s ass.
Pepper smiled. “That sounds great. Bruce have anything to do with that?”
After initial talks concerning the project, Obadiah had then reached out to a scientist who had worked for Stark Industries when Howard Stark oversaw the company, Dr. Thanos. Under Tony’s brief regime, Thanos had been let go after leaking tech secrets; he subsequently went to work via the black market. However, Obadiah had managed to track him down and convince him to redirect Project Synergy.
Tony closed the gap between himself and Steve. “Yeah, coffee sounds great. I’ve been up late the last few nights trying to finish a few things before coming out.”
Tony rolled his eyes with a sigh. “Come on…really? This,” he gestured back and forth between himself and Steve, “whatever
Tony cringed as Sharon spoke. He could feel himself bubbling with anger over Steve keeping their relationship a secret, now leading Tony to believe that Steve probably thought that what they had didn’t mean anything to him.
Bruce looked to be pondering the idea. “Try a
Steve hobbled down the hallway and into the kitchen. As he approached the opening, he found Peter and one of his friends playing a game on the floor. Steve smiled at them as he entered.
Tony shook his head as he proceeded to walk around the lab, pretending to be surveying the remaining damage.
Even given the situation, the last statement seemed to bother Bruce the most. Tony mentally filed it away to tackle later as he was too concerned about Clint’s behavior and the missing sequences.
“Not to sound overly intrusive, but he did spend the night here last night, right? Why would he do that if he weren’t interested in you?”
Thanos stepped closer toward him, mere inches away from his face. “If you trust my methods, then you’ll trust that we’ll produce this ‘super’ weapon to its full capacity.” He made sure to emphasize the word “super”, showing his frustration with everyone referring to his masterpiece so trivially.
“Uh, we’re here to help, officer. Tony Stark.” Tony reached out his hand again for the officer.
“So, uh…” Tony stood next to the bed, “Steve’s coming to the party tonight…”
Tony started groaning as he leaned forward to kiss Steve before kissing the underside of his chin. He moaned some more as Steve felt that wet slick feeling between the two of them. Tony straightened up again, rocking forward faster, holding onto himself as he came.
Later in the evening after work, Steve and Bucky had walked together to the local drug store. As soon as they entered, Steve quickly headed toward the back of the store.
“Ah! Found it.” Clint grinned to himself as he typed the code to get into the lab.
To Tony, Steve’s expression looked serious. Perhaps a little too serious.
Steve uncrossed his arms he watched Tony reposition himself underneath the robot with Peter. “You’re probably one of the smartest people I know, Tony, but sometimes it does help having another pair of eyes.”
“…if you had told me about a year ago that I would not only be working at Stark Industries, but would also get close to a famous person, I wouldn’t have believed you…” his voice trailed off, still very much shy about being this close to Tony.
Bruce turned around to face Tony. “…how unstable do you think?”
Tony kept grinning as he walked over to the nearest console, motioning for Riri to follow him.
“Can you get her to stop doing that please?” Loki pleaded with Tony as he tried to rub the back of his head but his hands were tied against his body.
hung up before.”
Riri looked at Tony before looking back at the image, hesitating before reaching out to manipulate the image with her fingers.
Tony missed being with someone who cared for him deeply. He groaned once more as he banged his head up against the headboard. If only he could figure out how to function in a working relationship, maybe he could actually meet someone who would stay with him.
As Fury explained, Tony walked to the other side of the conference room to get away from Steve who stood still, and the palpable tension between the two made everyone exceedingly uncomfortable.
Tony’s mood then fell rapidly as he thought about how hurt Steve looked and sounded the day he had broken up with him and how difficult it was telling Peter that they were no longer together.
Peter flipped through his notebook with purpose as it became clear that he was trying to find something difficult for Tony to answer.
Steve took his time turning around from his station to face Tony. He looked downward before glancing upward slightly.
Peter reached out for Tony, crying even louder as Tony hugged him. Steve watched them from the doorway, not really sure what to do.
Steve observed that referring to Tony as “in charge” seemed to have irked Obadiah, but the older man barely flinched beyond an apparent facial tick that gave him away.
Bruce approached Tony. “What are you doing, Tony?”
Tony then drew Steve nearer to kiss him, a kiss that moved quite slowly between them as Tony used his thumb to stroke Steve’s neck. Steve rested his hands on Tony’s waist and squeezed. Both men breathed deeply into the kiss before Tony broke away.
“Uh, no…w-why do you ask?”
Tony shook his head, not really sure where to start. “I don’t know what he wants…we, uh,” he paused, rolling his eyes, “we…uh…slept together the other night…”
Clint nodded before shrugging. “Well, it was nice knowing you guys.”
Steve chuckled. “I’m glad you think so, Tony.”
Tony inhaled sharply as he continued working, hoping he would eventually find a way to get back to at least working smoothly with Steve like they had when they created the algorithm together. But before he could really think of anything productive, his phone rang loudly, playing the Beastie Boys’ “Sabotage” on the loudest volume possible.
Steve spun around to face Tony. “But, uh…Sam and Bucky are sharing a suite before the wedding.” He tried to reason out loud.
Tony shook her hand as he shook his head. “Just Tony. This is Steve Rogers, one of Synergy’s finest.” Tony motioned toward Steve who meekly shook the doctor’s hand.
Steve, unamused, expressed his dissatisfaction with the insinuation. “Why would you even think about that, Tony? Does Peter know about this?”
likely doctored that file.”
“An artist. A chef. Steve has no limits.” Sam cut in, sending his friend the most annoying grin.
Tony swiveled in his chair as he sunk down lower into it.
Steve smiled back, but he was sure he looked edgy. Tony grinned toward the direction of the crowd outside, which was growing restless with anticipation. One of the backstage managers walked up to Tony and Steve, motioning with her hands that the presentation was ready to begin.
Tony attempted to ignore Steve’s outstretched hand, but by this time, Steve had scooted himself closer to the edge to peer over the side of the mattress, wearing a kind-hearted smile. Tony was incredible annoyed, mostly with himself, but also with last night and the entire trip, but something about Steve’s jovial presence managed to break through his misery.
Riri looked even more guilty than before. Tony waved her apprehension off with a smile to indicate that he was not offended.
Tony looked at Steve who still looked confused by the situation. “How do you feel?” Tony asked quietly.
and the black river of loss
Steve nodded. He blinked a few times, wiping his eyes with the back of his wrist. “Thank you, JARVIS.”
“Soldiers risk their lives for this country, and they are brave. Teachers who jump in front of shooters to save their students are also undeniably brave. But do you think that is their duty?”
“JARVIS, notify the rest of the team immediately. Any word on Cap?”
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, and then he was stretching up, his mouth taking Steve’s in a deliberate, devastating kiss that sent shivers all the way to Steve’s toes. He hooked his thighs around Tony’s waist, using his heels to drag him in closer as Tony kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him. Steve could hold his breath for ages and still he was lightheaded, and when Tony pulled away he gasped like he’d been drowning, oxygen filling his lungs in a dizzying rush.
Tony licks his lips, swallows whatever else it is he wants to say. He glances at Natasha, her green eyes narrow as she tries to find the lay of the land, before pursing his lips. “Fine, I guess somebody call Hill. But I’m telling on her to Pepper.”
“And after?”
, he thinks, moaning. He’s wanted to do this for ages, but both times Steve had completely assailed him. His mouth is watering, spit running down the hot length of Steve’s cock as he licks around the head, slipping his tongue a little under the foreskin and moaning at the musky taste of him, the smear of pre-cum on his tongue.
Firstly, he’s olive-skinned as his mother, so green is really not his colour. More than that, it’s not even a good green. It’s the kind of green that looks bad on everyone. And
“You and Cap are plotting, thinking about expanding the team. I know you, Tony, and I know Steve.”
“I mean, we did talk about her,” Tony says, considering. “But he said they aren’t really friends. They’re…allies?” He rocks his hand back and forth in the universal sign of ‘eh, maybe, who fucking knows’. “She went totally postal on me, though, come on. She nearly fried Barton.”
“Lucky I’m rich, then,” Tony said, and he was grinning now. “Not that you’re so destitute yourself there, Captain.”
He doesn’t know what this means, any of it. Tony being attracted to him, wanting him, was never in question. Tony was not subtle about his attentions, and he flirted like he breathed. His eyes were expressive, and the lingering looks that Steve knew intimately had graced most of the Avengers at one point or another. The fact that he was the most common recipient of them hadn’t escaped his notice, but still; he doesn’t know what it means, that Tony was willing to kiss him on the couch when they hadn’t talked yet. Was that an answer? Is the answer yes?
“Myself, my father, the council and his advisors. Now, all of you.” He coughs. “And Loki, of course.”
“And we know Tony’s at least gonna have to be quarantined a few days, so it’s not necessary,” Steve filled in. He nodded, considering, then shrugged the sweatshirt on. It was too small, tight around the shoulders, but he immediately felt safer. Held.
He’d said it kindly enough, but it was too late for that. He’d already violated the most basic rules of both biology and society. He’d shown the worst possible side of himself to the one person in the world that was supposed to love him unconditionally.
"Where are
Steve moaned again, the only answer he could provide as Tony held his mouth open like this. He was fucking slowly in and out with his fingers now, saliva pooling under Steve’s tongue and dripping over his chin, his jaw. Then Tony pressed his cock to Steve’s lips, his fingers still inside, and Steve let out a soft cry at the thought of it.
“Alpha,” Steve murmured, deciding distraction was the better part of valour, and Tony turned back to him, burying his face in his neck. “Do you have any plans for today?”
“Don’t get all emotional on me now, Bucky Barnes. My heart can’t take it.”
Steve loved this, the feel of Tony on his tongue, of being useful to his alpha, of being close and buried deep in Tony’s scent. But they rarely did it this way. Steve liked to be on his knees, liked for Tony to take charge, loved when Tony made him take it. He’d been selfish, maybe, with his wants. He loved Tony, more than he could even bear sometimes, so much he could feel it as a phantom pain: in the obvious places, like right under his heart, but sometimes in places that were strange. Tony would say something self-deprecating, and Steve would feel heartbreak spike along the outer edge of his hand. Tony would get hurt, and Steve would feel his own weakness unspooling tension behind the backs of his teeth, filling his mouth with slobbering anger. Sometimes, he felt as though he could slaughter every moving thing in the cosmos if it would spare him pain, or even if it made Tony happy. But Steve didn’t know what to do with that feeling, besides give himself utterly to Tony’s desires and let himself be claimed. Maybe that wasn’t fair. What did he know?
Steve closes his eyes.
“Peter?” Tony says, eagerness lurking under his careful tone. “Peter, did you see something?”
We will have a brief pause now. If this novel were a theater, you could go out into the lobby, wait in line for a drink, or for the bathroom. Give people a chance to admire your clothes, hair, or jewels. Step outside for some air or a smoke. Backstage the crew would be busy transforming the scenery, actors would change their costumes and redo their makeup. Some would be done until final curtain, others awaiting their first entrance.
a favour and
“Which is so unusual and strange that it terrified me,” Pepper deadpans. She fetches up against her desk, folding her arms and eyeing Tony with suspicion. “This is about the last fight. Because you lost people.”
“Um.”
“Of course,” Xavier says. “He expects an arguably unreasonable level of competence from those around him. It is what inspires trust: if he knows that he can count on someone in word and deed. But there is little Stark cannot do, and he forgets that this is not the case for everyone. His intelligence sometimes surprises even himself.”
When that doesn’t work, he sits up and rubs a hand over his face. “JARVIS, is Natasha awake?”
“I thought so,” JARVIS replied. He didn’t sound at all disapproving. If anything, Steve would colour him amused. “Sir will be glad to see you.”
Tony drops the spanner with a startling clang. "What do you want me to say, Steve?"
“Ew!” Steve ignored Clint’s heckling.
A pale, towheaded boy sticks head out from around the shadowed doorway. He blinks big blue eyes at Steve, dressed head to toe in pyjamas with cowboys and rearing horses printed all over his little body. He’s wearing spaceship socks and clutching a large plush cowboy that Steve recognises from a children’s film about talking toys.
“Yeah, yeah,” Steve says, straightening up. The look he graces Tony with is fond, and he leans in for a kiss even as Tony tilts his head up. His lips are slightly chapped, still caked with dried blood, but it’s sweet all the same. The slow slide of his fingertips in the groove of Tony’s spine makes him arch up onto his toes a bit, and Steve grins into the kiss. His eyes are bright and gleaming when he pulls back. “Can I ask you something?”
Steve shakes his head. There are so many things he wants to say. He wraps a hand around Tony’s wrist where he’s cupped Steve’s face, presses his thumb to the veins and wishes he could feel enough to count his pulse.
, but nothing of the sort happens.
“So,” Sam pants up at him when he slows to a final stop, “what’s your game plan? Not that I don’t like getting my ass whooped, keeps me humble.”
“Come up here,” he tells him, but Loki ignores him, sucking a biting kiss to Tony’s thigh then bending Tony’s legs backwards. Tony lets him, waving a hand at the drawer.
“And, it’s true, what they say—alphas talk, right? Howard was…he was always saying stuff I didn’t agree with. About O’s, like we called 'em back then. About lady omegas, specifically, but sometimes beta ladies, too. And we all just laughed about it, because it was Howard. He was harmless, right?” Steve looks up, then, and his blue eyes are fierce. They pin Tony to his seat. “But it isn’t
“Oh!” Tony waves a finger at Thor. “And he protected me from your crazy ex-girlfriend.”
“I should go.”
“Can I what?”
when you are fallen
“There’s a Lichtenstein, too.”
Tony swallowed, acutely aware of the fact that he and Rogers were here, alone, mostly undressed in the middle of a blizzard. The smile that Rogers offered him was small, approaching wicked.
are legit and fuckin awesome, as are female
For another, who knows you by heart.
“I love you,” he said, and Tony blinked at him. “And there isn’t an alpha in the world who could love me half as well as you do.”
They’ve settled in the main library. Books upon books are crammed into every available space, piled on the floors, on tables. Some of them seem to be breathing, moving of their own accord, but like all strange things around Stephen, he ignores them as best as he’s able. It’s better for their friendship, that way. A cup of tea is clutched in Tony’s hands, even though he can’t stand tea. He spends far too much time with people who enjoy it.
“What happened to nine?”
“About you and the Captain.”
Stay safe kiddos.
Tony doesn’t tell Natasha he loves her for it, either. She’s never been interested in the obvious.
“Tony-”
He closes his eyes. “Steve. Don’t.” He turns a sharp glare on Steve, who’s looking down at him with a strange kind of stubborn tenderness that doesn’t reassure Tony at all. He decides to go on the offensive. “This is just the intermission. You’ve already shown where your allegiances lie. You’ll be glad when this nightmare is over, and you can march off into the sunset with your platonic ideal of brotherly love and the niece of your wartime girl, like that isn’t incredibly weird. And I’ll go back to my fiancé, and get married, and have two kids and a big smelly dog and an annoying spider babysitter. You already chose Barnes over me. Remember?”
Tony Stark doesn’t know why Steve Rogers loves him. All he knows is what he has: a broken heart patched up with bomb scraps and a crystal pane of glass; a team who calls them mom and dad, who thinks he’s clever and kind and worthwhile; and a man, chopped up and jumbled into a mess of memory and action, something torn out of him and dropped back in the wrong place. He has Steve, fuckall he’s supposed to do with that. Maybe the infatuation was Amora, too.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Tony tells him airily. “That’s why I came to California. Pepper’s here, and Happy, and Rhodey, and everything is sunny and normal. And Rhodey is an enabler who doesn’t ask me difficult questions, which is why he is the best. He loves me.”
“Are you ever not going to fall for that?” Loki asks, lounging over Tony’s shoulders, and Tony rolls his eyes heavenward.
“Well, there’s your penance, then. Read the whole thing through, in English, and see how you feel about it afterwards.”
“Turn on the jets,” Tony tells him.
Peel your image from the mirror.
The doors opened sooner than he would have liked them to, his ears crackling a little at the pressure of having gone from one of the top floors of the tower to the deepest subbasement Tony could legally build. Steve wasn’t sure that he’d have gotten the permits if City Hall had known what they were for, but it was too late for them to do anything now. By now, New York had come to love the Hulk, in its own way; he was angry, and he protected his own, and he didn’t take any shit. If anything, he was basically the city’s mascot.
Ghost puts up a good fight, Steve will give him that. He takes a chunk out of Logan’s arm, swipes ineffectively through Kitty’s vital areas. He tries for Steve’s body but is quickly turned away by Logan. Slowly, they back him into a corner. Slowly, Kitty’s hits build up until whatever it is—his suit, or his body—begins to give up on him entirely. Patches of skin, human and pale, shine through the shimmering grey mesh of static and shadow in glitching patches. When he speaks, it’s almost impossible to parse his logic. He wanted to kill Tony next, is mostly what Steve gets out of it. It would be an understatement to say that Steve is quite pleased that they never got to that point. He wants nothing more than to go home, in his own body, and curl up in bed. He wants to go for a run. Spar with someone. Read a book. Draw for a few hours. He wants some time alone to process everything that’s happened.
"What did you do?" Pepper says, sighing. She pinches her brow with a free hand.
“You can’t possibly want me like this,” Tony blurts out before he can stop himself.
“I’m sure you are,” Cabe says, insinuation dripping from a filthy purr, and Steve tries desperately to reign in the jealousy that flushes through him. Tony’s car salesman grin doesn’t help the situation, and Steve takes a breath and presses the button to close the privacy window.
Steve stayed at the railing, sipping his coffee. Below him, on the landing pad, he could see evidence that Clint had been outside for his usual meditations; a few footprints in the thin layer of snow there, a spot on the edge where he’d crouched for long enough that the snow had melted in a small oval beneath him. The light in the communal kitchen spilled out onto the snow, and Steve wondered if Bruce was downstairs cooking something.
He sets the wrench down, puts on a tired smile, turns around. Natasha is standing with her hands folded behind her back, expression flat neutral in the way that Tony has learned to be weary of. She’s dressed in comfortable blacks, her hair pulled up behind her head. She must have changed and come straight here from her flight.
Steve frowns. “That’s it?” he asks, because that seems awfully easy, but the priest just goes on talking.
Tony frowns, then glances over his shoulder at her. “What?”
“You’re dressed,” he says, waving a hand at Tony vaguely. “I’ll just have to. You know.” He hooks a thumb over his shoulder, feeling awkward when Tony’s expression doesn’t change. “See you in fifteen?”
“Rogers! Answer me, damn it!”
that idea, you kinky fucker, holy shit-”
Tony clearly has nothing to say to that. He huffs a put-upon sigh. “I want Rhodey.”
“Right…” Steve scratches at his head. He glances over at Hulk. “Okay. First thing’s first, you’re hungry, right? Why don’t we get some food in you, and then we can figure out the next step.”
Their first breakthrough comes with unexpected results.
“I think about him or say his name and then he just shows up,” Tony says flatly, and Steve raises an eyebrow at him. There’s a pause, where both of them are maybe waiting for a miraculous
“Oh my god, you’re
Steve shakes his head a little, a slight blush coming to him as he tries to get his mind on right. He’s standing on poured concrete, in some sort of cavernous space. It’s bright, lit by the kind of overhead lights that Steve has only ever seen in underfunded hospitals and depressing office buildings. It was evening in New York, and it seems like it’s probably some time outside of the workday here too, wherever here is. There’s no one in the building.
Amora’s mouth is open in a scream Tony can’t hear, hands clapped over her ears. Fire encircles her, spreads out from the edges of the bright shield. It catches electrical cords and the scientists’ papers, electricity sparking dangerously as the rubber melts and the cords fray. Smoke tinges green as it weaves through the cavernous space, and Tony hovers to avoid a tendril of fire snaking its way towards him. He hisses as one of the machines behind him begins to spark.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Because you two are souped-up and I’m just a fleshy mortal.”
“I’m sure!” he shouts, spinning into a barrel roll as the gun barks. It glances off the helmet anyway, twice, three times, and Tony curses. “Hundred percent sure. Legolas, you’re gonna have a new sniper buddy to play with if Cap ever gets his way.”
. Tony’s wanted him, and with the dizziness of arousal swimming through him he can’t think of why he shouldn’t… just…
“Liar,” Tony grumbles, licking back into Steve’s mouth to stop him from talking. Steve hitches a thigh around his hip, dragging him in with a foot hooked around his waist. He moans when Tony settles between his legs, rough and unashamed in his pleasure.
“Some of those people died because they weren’t reached in time. Tony was found safe, under the rubble. Do you think your time would have been better spent clearing the hospital?”
The first time Tony lets the suit envelop his skin since Steve’s unexpected rebirth as a ghost, it’s 3am on a Tuesday. Tony’s been on the brink of something bad for at least two hours. Steve can tell, and he’s immediately on edge. There’s been no alert. Tony hadn’t read anything particularly alarming on the holodisplays, as far as Steve saw. But an upset Tony is an unstable Tony, and he’s a little worried that Tony’s about to go and do something very stupid. Pick a fight with someone just for the hell of it, maybe.
The thing was, Tony wanted to tell his traitorous mind, it wasn’t all sunshine and roses. Rogers was a stubborn man, hellaciously so if he’d got his teeth in something that he felt wasn’t right. They’d fought countless times: about the war, about Tony’s refusal to ever touch a gun again despite his sharp shooting, about how best to take care of the town. They’d fought about Tony’s drinking every single damn day since they’d met. Rogers could be a real clodhopper sometimes when it came to his civic duty, and Tony had told him again and again not to go rustling Roxxon’s men, fine good it had done him to run his trap. Rogers was crooked as a Virginia fence, which was why he’d rode off to Red River Pass all on his lonesome to go after a pack of bandits. He hadn’t even had the good sense to wait for Wilson to get back from settling a minor ranching dispute. He’d thought he could handle it, and truth to be told, so had the rest of Timely.
Steve recognises this moment. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake had hit six major provinces in the country a few weeks ago. Hundreds were injured or dead, and over a thousand people had been unaccounted for. The Avengers had flown down to help with the clean-up and try to find survivors among the rubble. It had been a long series of days; entire buildings had been pitched sideways and become terrifying death traps. Bruce, JARVIS, and Tony had spent hours mapping the city out, finding better ways for the search and rescue teams to get to the worst buildings most likely to hold survivors. Tony hadn’t slept for much of the time; there were buildings that were easiest for Iron Man to get to, with the combined power of flight, his engineering brain, and the suit’s laser technology. At night he was running numbers, setting up drones to run through unstable buildings, and running minor repairs on his tech.
“I’ll help you.”
“Just fun,” Tony repeats, and Happy hmms noncommittally. “Cap and I aren’t fully bonded, yet, anyway.” He tilts his neck to the side to show his unmarked boding gland. “No bite.”
Alarmingly, Tony seems to know exactly what he’s thinking, because his head turns towards Steve. Amusement and shock war on his face before he seems to settle on amusement, and Steve remembers with a dizzying rush of embarrassment what Tony had said about sometimes being able to feel strong emotion. He reaches out and takes Tony’s closest hand into his lap.
Thor smiles and looks down at his hands. “You know that I thought Loki dead after he saved Jane on Svartálfaheimr, only for him to return and cause trouble again. Yet there seemed no plot in it, which was unlike him; only mischief, like that of when we were children.”
“You don’t agree?” Steve asks. JARVIS stares to demur, but Steve cuts him off with a wave. He tilts his head up to the kitchen camera, pointing a spoon at it. “You’re always real careful about how you phrase things, you know that?”
“Steve,” Tony says, in that tired, exasperated way that Steve has always hated. “I’m putting a lot on faith here. I don’t even know you are who you say you are. I don’t even know if you’re real. So we’re gonna run some brain scans on me, and see if Friday is able to pick anything up, and then we’ll go from there. Okay?”
“No,” Clint says, flipping his dough over. It’s perfectly cream coloured, and perfectly flat. He brushes his hands together to displace some of the flour, then turns over his shoulder to fix him with a squinted eye. “You wanna talk about what’s happening with you and Cap?”
“Your ego can handle it,” Steve deadpans, and Tony snickers. He takes a bite of sandwich, and Steve watches him chew with guilt sitting in his stomach like a lead weight. “I’m a mess.”
“We could turn it into an educational initiative,” Jaime says. “Host some informational booths.”
“What the fuck is wrong with me?” he’d asked JARVIS on the third day, when it seemed like it might go on for a week.
“Steve,” Tony parrots evenly. He taps his foot, then shuffles a little to the side. Steve stares at him. The elevator dings. “Well, this was fun, let’s never do this again, c’ya-”
“Brother?” he says, wonderingly, and Loki’s expression sours into something jaded and petty. Thor rushes forward to embrace him, but his hands move right through, and Loki dissolves into golden light.
The silence continued for a while, but Steve stopped on the stairs up to the exit, curious himself. He hadn’t even thought about it. Outside, daylight had already begun to break, thin blue light filtering in from the wide rectangle of sky. Steve could hear the faint calls of birds: chickadee, cardinal, sparrows, and titmouses. Sometimes Sam took him on birding walks, and he liked being able to identify the sounds. It felt like hearing a secret language, all its own.
Steve stared at Tony for a moment, completely turned around by the shift in conversation. “I’m lost,” he admitted.
“No, no, don’t.” Tony gasps out. He presses a shaky hand to the arc reactor, squeezes his eyes shut. “
“What do you need?” Tony asks him, and Steve takes a slow breath.
“She barely has a scent most days,” Steve said. “It’s…while you were gone, the longer time passed, the more your scent was replaced with the rest of the pack’s.”
“Fuck, that’s hot,” Tony groaned, and Steve’s head snapped back to him sure as a rubber band. “When is this fucking torture gonna be over?”
“So, what, you want to cart everyone into see you?”
“Uh oh,” Clint laughs, “what happened last time?”
"Excuse me?" he asked, and Steve took a deep breath.
“Who’d you spend the night with?”
“Casper,” Steve repeats.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
Steve is perched on the front of the float, legs hanging over the side. It looks good, Tony’s gotta say. The Empire State building is lit bright and gleaming, the Old Croton Dam and the Brooklyn Bridge framing it on either side. The Old Croton Dam spills real water down into the East River under the bridge, the water on a cycle pump that Tony’s quite proud of considering that this baby has to drive. Steve sits on the front edge in old-fashioned construction worker’s garb, looking every bit a boy of his time and unfairly handsome in his little pageboy cap and coveralls. The employees had put together a playlist of their favourite Irish and Irish American musicians, mostly filled with solid rock standards that are likely to get the crowd going. Jamie and Grace are up there with him, all of them dressed up and sharing coffee in tin cups, and Tony snaps a photo with his phone and sends it to Pepper. They look adorable, honestly, and Tony’s pretty proud of what they’ve managed to get done.
Beth whirls to face him and levels him with a sharp look. “How did you know?”
“You didn’t do anything wrong,” Tony tells him. He smiles a little, even though it hurts like hell. “You’re perfect, Steve. But I’m a mess, okay? I’m a mess, and all I do is ruin things-”
“Tony…I think I’m…going to come.” Steve whispered.
Tony smirked before rising from the couch. He walked over to Steve to retrieve the charger. Steve held the charger out, continuing to smile, and Tony nearly forgot what a smartphone was.
“How do I look?” Steve managed awkwardly.
, Thor.” Clint interrupted with an eye roll, “no wonder you haven’t been invited.”
Gamora looked behind herself before motioning for Nebula to follow her out of the room. They glanced down the corridor to see their father speaking with his team of scientists before the group walked into the testing area. Gamora motioned again for Nebula to follow her down another hallway.
“Yeah, I was trying to finish reviewing the facial alteration device specs so I could focus on our side project…” she turned around with a cup of coffee, “I took another look at your father’s schematics, Tony…but…”
Tony reached out a hand toward Steve as he took another step toward him. “Steve—”
Steve expressed terror at Tony’s suggestion. “What does that even mean?”
“…you know, I could probably scale the building if I exited through the window…” Tony offered before peeking out through the curtains.
Tony clenched his glass to steady himself, interrupting Sharon as soon as she finished a sentence. “Uh, would you excuse me for a second? I see someone I should be coaxing into investing in the company. It was really nice to meet you. Hope you enjoy the party.” Tony spun around to walk away from Sharon before she had a chance to respond.
Tony craned his neck to look directly at Steve who looked solemn. He didn’t realize how much he missed Steve until it was too late. But maybe trying to be friends again would work out for them in the future. Tony thought about his plan again as Steve waited for a response. He thought about what Sam said and he thought about the way they were before they broke up.
Nebula rolled her eyes as she listened, but after a moment or two, she shrugged. She looked directly at Gamora before looking past her down the adjoining corridor toward the testing area.
“You did
Pepper took a hold of his hand and lightly caressed it. “Tony, you’re just lively and expressive. Those are good traits.” She smiled.
Help. I have no idea what I’m doing.
Tony was sure his anxiety was palpable; he almost declined visiting Clint, continually reproaching himself for his teammate’s attack.
But Steve tilted his head as best as he could with curiosity. “Why would you say that?”
Tony then turned slightly away from Steve; he no longer felt the closeness he had been experiencing with him up until now. And Tony knew it was his fault; Steve hadn’t called him out on his poor response to his love confession, but Tony couldn’t think of a productive way to try to explain himself, especially since it had been several days since.
“Hey, so,” Tony walked toward Steve, but he stopped short, “I know this is kind of last minute, but I’m having a thing at my place this weekend if you would like to stop by…?”
“Drive safe and let me know when you get home, okay?” Steve asked, tapping his hand a couple times on the frame of the door before turning around again with a wave.
“Look, Steve I—”
Tony’s answer barely satisfied the team as Fury then began explaining possible next steps. Both Tony and Steve remained silent as the rest of the team discussed the options. As soon as the conversation ended, Tony marched out of the conference room without saying a word, and Steve quickly followed him. Despite whatever personal conflict they were having, Steve knew he needed to apologize to Tony for arguing over Synergy in front of the team.
Tony looked away for a moment but then turned toward John, “Well it’s a long story” he simply said. But John just smiled “ I got time for you kid” Tony smiled and told him everything. Well not everything, he didn’t speak about Rogers about his ‘relationship’ with him, but he told him about New York battle, the mandarin, the team and how they treat him, Thor and his training. It felt like he was talking for hours and John just listen.
“J time?” Tony ask
So that was a 6 months ago and well things got even stranger. The mandarin, god that was a pain and the PTSD didn’t help either. But it was all fine in the end, well almost, tony promise Pepper he will stop being iron man but in the end he couldn’t, so Pepper had to let him go. It hurt he thought they had something but Tony knew it was too much for Pepper since the battle of New York.
Clint looked at his friend in confusion “what Nat?” He simply said. But Natasha didn’t answer, no instead she walked in a fast pace. “Hey what are you doing” she yelled, that’s when Clint notice the young agent who was supposed to bag the evidence. But instead Clint saw that she was destroying it, at this point Clint ran towards the car.
It was time for Tony and Tobias to have a talk.
Pain, pain so much pain going through Tony’s body . The cold air send shivers down Tony’s spine as ran and his blood was everywhere.
TBC.........
John chuckled lightly “sure thing kid, have fun at the gala alright don’t get into too much trouble” he teased and Tony smirk back “ oh you know me trouble is my middle name” and then Tony was gone.
Tony was surprise that his family was apparently different from any other and that got tony curious about what he could do with his gift and if he could master it, maybe he could help his son and train him better to help him protect himself.
He later had surgery with a little of with extremis, to help to remove all the shrapnel in his chest. But he ask if they kept the reactor attach to his chest, despite what it was meant for it was apart of him and tony wanted to keep it like that. But with a few minor changes so the reactor did not effect any of Tony’s internal organs and it can be removable as it’s not attach internally.
“Well what do you know, I guess you do follow orders after all” Rogers tease which brought tony out of his daze.
The mission was like something that came out of a cheesy scifi comic book. The mission was simple kill all the giant swaps that are invading New Jersey like what the fuck. Apparently a made scientist created these insects but they got loose and well his own creations killed him along the way.
Tony would not feel intimidated by this no way, so he turn to face Rogers fully, looked at him directly in those deep Blue angry eyes and with a smirk said “ or what?” That all he said and that broke the camels back. Because the next thing tony knew warm, harsh lips were on his.
Sickening laughter echoed all around him, that made him want curl into a ball and disappear.
He had a plan, he grab his phone off the coffee table and dialled. The ringing felt like it went on forever, but then he answers.
