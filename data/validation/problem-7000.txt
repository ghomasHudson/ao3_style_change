“Do you want something to eat? Agh I need coffee ASAP” Tony starts to prepare the coffee maker and Steve saves the water in the fridge again.
“Agh! I’m out of here. You are a son of a bitch Daniel!” The girl yells again and someone throws something to the ground and in that exact moment, someone in Tony’s bed sits down abruptly, waking up violently.
about the warning signs, died. The kiss was warm, and slow, and Steve ended up letting himself be carried away, moving his lips too, kissing him back. And
The smell of lemon hits his nose when he opens the door, and everything looks so organized that it surprises him they don’t use this bedroom for photographs in decoration catalogs. He haven’t walk into his parents room in a… long while. So it’s normal to feel like he doesn’t know this part of the house at all.
“Agh God, this is going to be a terrible hangover. But whatever, wanna make out?” He blurts a laugh a bit louder this time and someone shush him from across the room.
. It was the normal thing people did at parties. Tony muttered something in his lips, with Aaron’s name and then, he threw himself to the side and groaned when his head hit the pillow. Steve stood there, with a hand on his forehead, looking at the dark ceiling trying to calm his breathing for a good five minutes before untangling Tony’s legs from his to put Tony’s body completely on his side of the bed without any part of him, touching Steve.
“Would you please listen to me for a second here? I think they are sleeping together.” He interrupts.
Aaron is insane. The college play? He wouldn’t go there willingly. Ever. “Are you joking? I hope you are joking” 17.46pm
“So… where were we?” Tony asks seductively in a whisper, smiles and he puts his lips into Aaron’s. It’s soft, and a slow, and the rooms keeps on getting bigger and smaller and moving a little, but when he tries to intensify the kiss like he
“Are you even listening to me Cap? I asked about your architecture project. The one you told me about last week.”
and ever since Tony is distant. Steve tried to be his normal self, but… Is hard when Tony isn’t. He just wants to give him his time. But the fear of Tony needing space forever has been starting to kick in. He doesn’t really get it. Tony kisses everyone, he doesn’t know why Tony got so caught up on this anyway.
There is nothing going on between Bucky and Steve. He got that conclusion because it was the logical and rational one. There is nothing going on between Bucky and Steve.
“For god’s sake this is my room!” He yells and Aaron elbows him. “What? They should be grateful I don’t kick them out to fuck you”
This is the last time he craves for Tony’s attention. He did nothing wrong and Tony cut him off. Well great. Tony can go to hell.
how, something happens. The kiss is too…. great. He doesn’t want to move or to do anything else but kissing him like this. Is warm, and fast but slow and is familiar but different at the same time. He is probably too drunk to spice things up anyway, so he ignores the nausea feeling he gets all of the sudden and keeps on kissing him.
The whole lunch goes well, more than well actually, everybody laughs and talks and they steal most of Natasha’s fries until she gets angry, and by the time lunch is over and everybody leaves, Tony walks with Thor to the library. If he thinks of it, there were a few times when Steve meet his eye, or the other way around, and Tony felt weird enough like to look away, but other than that, it was fine. That’s when he decides that he needs to talk to Rogers about this someday, but today, is not the day. (or the week)
Tony always sleeps around, that was no big news. And he also makes out with everyone at parties, it’s just the fun of parties in the first place. He made out with a bunch of his friends too, like Bruce or Natasha. It’s not a big deal,
got a hangover later, the bastard, so Tony knows he is just in a bad mood 'cause he didn’t have enough sleep.
He remembers. The comfortable feeling. How different and yet familiar it felt. He remembers that night, the warm strong body under him, and how he didn’t wanted to stop the kiss.
And God, this is going to be bad. He turned around trying to fall asleep, but Tony’s cologne was all over him and it shouldn’t feel good. He also shouldn’t be thinking about how Aaron gets kisses like that all the time. Or how everybody gets kisses from Tony like that.
“Hey!” Some girl yells sleepily and Tony doesn’t even bother to say sorry this time. He is too busy entering his bed and noticing the warm body inside the covers. Thank god Aaron is here right where he left him. They can’t exactly sleep together in a room full of people (Tony is not that much of a pervert yet) but at least they can make out.
Bruce rolls his eyes and closes the laptop. “What do you mean there’s 'something' going on with them?”
He climbs on top of Aaron, and he tries to push him softly saying something but Tony grins and catches Aaron’s face in his hands.
Bruce finds him in the hall. “Oh thank God” Tony yells grabbing him by the arm and pulling him close so they can walk side to side.
“There’s something going on between Bucky and Steve!” He slammed the door and walked in to sit on the bed.
“Yeah, I get it but… I don’t know, you are right, maybe I’m just confused. I can’t like Steve. We are friends. Let's forget about this and move on.”  Tony breathes, smiles the best way he can and then he clears his throat. "You were saying?" He gestures towards the now forgotten phone on the table.
Aaron turned and stared to walk again. “Bucky. I thought that dude was his boyfriend. They are always together and they spend a lot of time on Steve’s room. I live in the same foyer remember? Bucky even came at midnight the other night and he left in the morning with him. Where did he slept? In Hyun’s bed?”
hangovers when they party because he doesn’t drink that much like to get one and plus the few times he did, he did
So okay. They do spend a lot of time together but… that’s what you do when you know someone from your whole life. Tony met his friend Rhodey when he was a kid and you could say they spend an awful lot of time together even if Rhodey is in the military now. So it was normal. It was fine.
“Wow” he yells when his feet lands into something. Putting one hand on the nearest wall he remembers that there’s two mattresses on his bedroom floor, with at least five people sleeping in between them, ‘cause it was too late for them to return to their homes.
He also takes his jacket off, which he doesn’t remember when he put it on in the first place, and then takes a deep breath.
. Tony shaked a little, like he was about to fall and Steve instinctively grabbed him by the waist. And in that moment Tony kissed him again. Softer this time, like he meant it. And Steve ended up throwing his arms around Tony’s back and kissing back shutting up all the alarms in his head. They were drunk, this was a party and Tony did this kind of thing all the time, he even kissed Bruce once, it was
While Nat and Aaron stop like normal people would do when they almost crash into some of their friends in the foyer, Steve and Tony stop like if they had been suddenly glued to the floor, and Tony clears his throat. Steve almost rolls his eyes and says “very subtle Tony” but he fights the urge.
“Yeah, I didn’t mean to get the house wrecked but yeah, it was fun Jarvis. Does any of my friends still here?”
Aaron said they were always together and that was something Tony couldn’t argue with. Bucky and Steve were glued by the hip and that was the first reason Bucky joined the group in the first place. Tony loves Bucky, he trusts him, the guy is crazy and sarcastic as he is and they became good friends in the last years. All of them. Bucky is smart and sharp and they share a bunch of classes since they are in the same engineer mayor, and is awesome to have someone like him around. So it’s not like Tony felt like he was forced to be friends with Bucky just to keep being friends with Steve, Bucky was great on his own and he became important on their group. But yeah, their friendship with Bucky? Pretty much Steve made it happen.
“I’m telling you something important here! This is an emergency! How could this happen right under our noses? Steve and Bucky!”
“Too much” he says and looks around the room. “Are you okay?” He asks concerned looking at Tony’s puke and back to Tony.
They keep walking to their next class, some people keep flashing smiles at both of them. They turn in the foyer and start going upstairs.
“I thought his boyfriend was the dick” Aaron shugs and lifts his shoulders up. “Oh look! There’s a play in two weeks!” He says when they walk pass a poster in the foyer and he stops on his tracks, making Tony stop too.
He opens his eyes but the bright white light makes him close them immediately. “I KNEW YOU WERE FUCKING THIS WHORE!” There’s a beep sound, a buzz on his ears and is he in a roller coaster? Oh god, his head hurts and everything is spinning and, he throws up.
Bruce kept talking about this and that while eating half a pizza by himself but Tony couldn’t focus enough.
Steve doesn’t answer his question or seems to care about what Tony is saying at all, he stirs both hands for his face and takes a couple of minutes to stand up. When he does, he stumbles a little and Tony grins.
Aaron offers a smile and a hand to high five and Steve wants to bat his hand away. But he can’t, so he smiles and then says something like “What’s up man?” that sounds way
He tries not to give it much thought and he lets himself fall into the bed without even turning off the lights. He closes his eyes and then, he remembers walking into his bedroom and falling into bed like this last night.
He presses Aaron’s face harder and separates their mouths to breathe a little. In that moment Aaron puts his hands on Tony’s waist and presses him against him and Tony can’t resist to lower his head again and put his mouth over his even if the dizziness gets worse.
There was a pause and Jim thought perhaps the suit had finally given up the ghost, but then Jarvis’s voice returned.
“Everything is fine.” His voice cracks and trills, sounding painful to even his own ears. “I've kept to my own and played by your rules. I have done all of these things to make penance and..”  Stop talking. Stop talking, what are you doing! A hateful version of his own vice shouted in his head.
Steve hung his head and finally let the tears escape. His captors had left when the explosions started. “I’m sorry.. I’m so sorry, I never got to tell you. Never got to ask you.”
“Yeah he is. Somehow I don't think you just popped by for tea though huh?” Tony leads the way inside glancing back for only a moment to observe an enormous man made entirely of metal step out and start cleaning off the windshield." Interesting body guard.”
The omega would have argued his point until sunset, but black spots were popping in his vision and a chill tickled down his spine. Everything began to blur and slide, the sight of the shiny red armor in front him began to fade to a muted umber as the world went sideways. “..Tony…”
Steve looked up when he heard giggling from the hallway, setting down his brushes and wiping a few pain smears from his hands. The mural was coming along nicely; maybe another day or two until it was completely finished.  The blonde peeked around the corner to see his two lovers making a spectacle of themselves in the hall.
This was his imagination, a horrible nightmare. No one would be stupid enough to try to pull this kind of a stunt like wearing Steve’s uniform in front of him.
The alpha sat up with his elbows on his knees and face in his hands as he listened. He’d been trying to figure out just that this whole time. Tony wasn’t a spring chicken any more and really, men his age already had teenage children. He shouldn’t be this freaked out about all of this, all of his youth he’d been pushed and prodded to settle down with a nice omega and give the Stark name an heir to the industrial throne.  He almost did just that, he was going to and then…Afghanistan happened. “I can’t be the one that tells you what to do Steve.”
They all clapped like they were told. Clint leaning over to Barnes. "This is both stupid and awesome. Kinda wish I done this with my kids."
Just a half hour later, massages concluded and the lights once again out in the penthouse bedroom - Steve woke again to the familiar tightening pain; this however, was much stronger than the last and lasted far longer.
Steve was not handling being benched well. He was the leader, a soldier, a man of action...he was also pregnant.
Of course his ridiculous brother even liked the music of Midgard and Loki was never one to be upstaged so he purchased what the people of the realm call an Ipod.  Thus began the epic journey of his musical education and ..the rather sexy side effects of an Asgardian prince ‘getting his groove on’
Mallen, for all his posturing and talk of superiority a moment ago, knew that he had met his match and if he wanted to live to get stronger, he needed to leave. Trying to floor the hero with a barrage of kicks and flames proved useless. He could slow Stark but not enough. Going for broke, Mallen charged for the exit -hoping to overwhelm the now true 'iron' man in close quarters and let Hydra act as shields for a speedy escape.
This was the first Barnes was hearing of this, considering that his friend told him everything. Then again... He wasn’t the same person and maybe Steve wasn’t either. “I didn’t know.”
Or would that backseat always be empty? Just like him...cold and desolate. Would his alpha one day realize the fatal flaw and leave him to rot?
The brunette smiled, really smiled and Steve took that as a small victory, “Well don’t get used to sugar. Daddy will be getting his van dyke back, it may take a few weeks but I my chin feels cold with out it.” Tony was silent for a moment just looking him over. They were both still just in towels. “Promise me something.”
Amora held the squirming bundle tight to her chest as she swam into the depth. The baby screamed as his bones and internal organs had reformed so quickly, the siren tisked at the infants constant howling.
Natasha still blamed Clint for the name; having started calling the puppy that and now it's all the damn thing will answer to.
Coulson shrugged his shoulders. “Well Captain I think you know by now that what Nick says isn’t always the truth. Of course, it took a while for them to... repair things as you might imagine. So at the time I suppose it was for the most part accurate.”
Tony understood of course, now was the worst possible time for something like this to happen, “How long do we have?”
Steve was trying to appeal to the rational part of his partners mind. Tony was a numbers person, he was analytical and surely, if he really thought about it he could see the wholes in the story.
“Barnes…B-buck...” He chokes and tastes hot coppery sludge spill over his lips. Tony can hear Barnes changing the clip in his weapon and doing his best to hold down the fort for the both of them. Super soldier or not – Barnes isn't a match for Mallen, not anymore.
“Oh so grouchy. I’m telling Nat on you. She’s getting much better at a disapproving face since she started hanging out with you.”  Tony spoke, always talking to diffuse any lingering embarrassment of the situation as he helped the larger man to the small ensuite bathroom.  “Your gonna have to hold the pole yourself though gramps. At least until you buy me a drink first, I‘m a classy broad ya know.”
“I thought it was all phooey. But I guess the old man hadn’t lost as many marbles as I had initially thought.”
Peter hopped to his feet and held out his hands to cocoon Carol in webbing, it was his best shot. He didn’t want to hurt her but he didn’t want to let her go.
“And my schematics, the ones I told you that Doom was after… They were taken too. Within the space of a few hours Dooms managed to probably modify his own robot using my schematics, and he’s created that. The guy works fast, seems he’s got someone working for him that knows how to build quickly.”
She tapped the side of her nose with another all-knowing glance “Your posture gives away more than you think, boyscout.”
“I love you too.” Steve panted, moving his hips to please Tony, feeling him around him which made him purr in content.
“Don’t they learn when you throw them out of windows?” She sighed, exhausted as she returned to her normal size. She was just too exhausted to carry on and nearly fell. Tony pushed himself up and grabbed her, pulling her arm around his neck.
The kiss became more passionate, and the flickers of heat between them became gradually more intense, the rubs between their body and friction alone were making beads of sweat form along their skin. Steve removed Tony’s briefs with an increasing hankering to see him in all of his refinement. He was hard, as the soldier had felt, erect, proud and not bashful at all. Tony lay there with his head tilted and a besotted smirk plastering his face, eyes filled with lust, grabbing at Steve’s hands and guiding them along his shaft. At first he gasped, but he soon relaxed, understanding Tony’s desires.
Tony laughed lightly and did the same, dusting the floor below with his hand and then taking a seat, his legs dangling on edge just above the murky water.
The intensity of the kiss continued, their little secret being an adventure in its own, but after such a long day this was just what Steve wanted.
Hammer held his hands up, palms toward the two giants that stood above him, with their heroic stature and lack of light shadowing their ominous expressions. “Huh? Th-that’s mine?”
Just when the argument began to simmer down, there was an instant trigger to boil it back up. It was emotionally exhausting to say the least.
“We’re going to have to take this thing down by force,” Jessica groaned, climbing up the ladder with such practiced ease, reaching the top in a matter of seconds. Luckily the fire escape closest to her provided a better vantage point.
Tony obeyed to the tug on his arm and began to follow Steve out down the hallway, trying to sniff out fresh meat.
“You know why you’ll never build anything like me, Stark? Because you won’t be able to. Not any more, I won’t have you getting in my way ever again.” Hammer growled, so angry that spittle flew clumsily through the air with each word he spat ferociously.
Tony mewled under the kiss, Steve took the incentive to deepen it this time, showing his dominance as his hand motions slowed, his thumb focusing circling the tip of the man’s stiffness. Their bodies were colliding the heat intensified as the more friction was generated between their bodies, arching toward one another in sheer passion and lust.
Tony circled around him to examine the damage and pulled him closer. One of the tendrils of Extremis danced off the surface of his armour and moved on its own accord to raise Steve’s chin. “Look at that, you’re bleeding…”
“I love you so much…” Steve replied finally, once they had settled themselves back into the cool mess of sheets, staring ever so longingly at the man he had just made love to.
you show me this before?” He spoke to thin air, knowing that Reed (and all of his staff) had long since fled the lab. All his erstwhile allies were fleeing, the entirety of the group driven to flight to the most distant corners of the Earth. To flee from higher forces, or those who had deemed and crowned themselves as such…Tony’s lip curled with disgust.
“One quick fire this ought to do it.” Tony mumbled quickly, powering up his reactor before sliding his shoulders back, sticking out his chest and firing a unibeam straight from the bright light in his chest, shooting it straight through the monsters that hurled themselves his way.
Lifting Steve into his arms he ducked further into the darkness of the alley, trying to avoid the main streets, but immediately reached a dead end. Knowing that he didn’t have enough power for his thrusters, he was left with no other choice but to go into the main streets that he once wandered.
“Should’ve recognised that accent.” She winked at him, a sideward smirk cast over her cherry red lips as she began to lead him inside, giving him a small push of encouragement as her palm rested comfortably on his back. It seemed as though she wasn’t scared of him at all, which was always a plus. Back in his old place others used to be far more intimidated by him purely because of his stature and previous military background; still, he appreciated someone immediately being on his level. “Let me guess too, ex-military?”
“I’m goin’ after Stane. He’s the jerk that paid to get this chip in me. They said it’d prevent the damage from the gas of all those bombs but they just lied… ” Crossbones growled as Masters finished working on his chip.
Steve’s eagle eyes remained focused on the hooded man, even as he fumbled his way to his feet. He almost slipped in a puddle, reaching for the edge of the curb to push himself up whilst his arrow and quiver remained a good meter away from him. With the mask broken, Steve was able to catch a better glimpse of Masters. Those petrifying eyes that were visible only in the shadow of skull sockets were now on display, lit by the flickering street lamp above.
“You’ve lost your rank, ex-director, you can’t tell me what to…” Steve couldn’t help but retort. His words brought an uncontrollable wide Cheshire-cat-like grin to Tony’s face, tilting his head further back into the mattress.
“Victor…” Tony whispered with shock, his own blues huge and focused on the man in front of him. There was only one way he could tell it was actually him, and that was only because those steely grey-blue was visible, giving Tony even more of a scare, so much so that he found himself gravitating toward Steve, almost leaning into his arm.
Steve’s azure eyes focused on the man that clutched to him, feeling his fingertips graze through his hair. Tony fell still and without knowing his wings lifted even more. The Captain was unsure why, but Tony’s mood seemed to have lifted from before. Perhaps it was when he touched his wings and felt that they were real, maybe that gave him faith. Either way, it was much better to see that faint smile grace his face rather than the scrutinising scowl.
There was a huge bang as Peter was struck to the ground, Steve following the falling body and catching him mid-air, doing a dip and then flying toward one of the many jets that were flying by. With the speed he was going he could catch up to a moving jet in no time, a door flinging open and hands reaching out for the fallen spider, taking him in whilst Steve flew to find the second target.
Tony gave Steve a look of worry, before receiving that nod that had such an unspoken confidence to it.
“So you’ve actually been behaving; why do I find that hard to believe?” he asked, cutting the wire that he needed to and then taking his time to hear more of the story.
Steve’s lips and tongue explored the expanse of Tony’s muscular chest, which was particularly sensitive. He could see a faint scar, a circle that was no longer there, eyes flicking up to meet his partners for a while before kissing just down it, over the brush of black hair and began swirling circles with his tongue over Tony’s nipple.
There was a hesitant nod that followed once the shapes of light began to dissipate, allowing him to see properly once more. “Y-yea, Tony--” He was still flustered, still trying to regain his bearings when he felt two arms wrap around him – one warm and the other icy cold. Still though, the embrace settled him. In return, he raised his arms around Tony’s small frame, expecting to feel the remnants of Tony’s shoulder armour around his shoulder blade but he couldn’t feel a thing. For now he didn’t question it, he just accepted the safety of being held by his co-leader. His own hand reached up for the nape of Tony’s neck, touching the wet black strands, trailing down the curve of his spine.
“Yeah, it’s good. He’s just… Having a shower now, more of that black goop was coming out of his ears and nose. You know, he didn’t sleep at all last night.”
He walked into his kitchen and slipped off his black blazer, the truth was that he didn’t wear any colour asides from black since Steve’s death; although that wasn’t a conscious decision it became apparent that he was mourning to everyone who saw him, including Pepper who decided that it was best to keep her distance for once. Tony needed space to heal, so they thought, since the man loved to do things independently, but in fact, Tony needed comfort and company. Nothing hurt him more than seeing his teammates turn against him like that and even though many times he had been accused of not having a heart but it was then that he himself felt his heart thud and ache with loneliness.
Every time he heard so much as a whisper escape Steve’s mouth he would remember the words that he said and would attempt to stop his eyes from tearing up again. He felt like a child again, scared and alone, wishing his hero was there to shield him from the pains and sufferings of everyday life.
Tony’s softer features, a smoothed jaw which Steve’s hand trailed, etching every single feature into his memory, were also highlighted by the line of light which he noticed with satisfaction. They were both filled with pain, and it wasn’t as though Tony was the only one that needed that kiss, and desired that closeness ever since they had met. Kindness and care were qualities that the soldier would always admire. And there he was trying to hide his pains because he didn’t want to be a burden, just as Steve would do. When it came down to it, despite Tony thinking otherwise, they were both soldiers.
As Steve sits back in his chair and surveys the carnage of their dinner, he tries not to think about the three or four bologna sandwiches he would have been having at home that night, leaning against his kitchen sink and looking out the window. They’re a distant memory, though. Now Steve knows what skate tastes like. He’s eaten pork cheeks that made his eyes roll back in his head. Even the deviled rabbit kidneys weren’t that bad.
Tony sighs dramatically. “I think I just skipped yesterday. Maybe Wednesday too. Man shall not live on black coffee alone. Besides, that metabolism probably needs a lot of calories, doesn’t it?” Steve can’t exactly argue with that. Tony did watch him put away about six plates of shawarma. He could’ve eaten more if he hadn’t been so tired. Saving the world, it turns out, is hungry work.
He’s just trying to figure out how to loosen his belt a notch without Tony noticing and cracking wise when he says, without looking away from the road, “You’re a great excuse to order the whole menu. I bet you’ll eat anything and lots of it.”
idling in front of Steve’s building with the top down. He stares at it for a minute with unabashed lust before he realizes that yes, that’s Tony behind the wheel. Bracing himself for some inventively mocking jab at his hesitation, Steve reaches for the handle of the passenger door, but Tony’s already getting out and coming around to the other side. “You can probably get us there, right?” he asks off-hand, like he doesn’t know that Steve has most of a stiffy for his car. Steve vaults into the driver’s seat. Nobody’s going to ask him twice. It takes him a minute to figure out how the dual-clutch PDK shift lever works, unhelped by Tony’s explanation, but by the time he’s decided to take the bridge and not the tunnel for the sheer pleasure of the drive he thinks he’s got the hang of it. They’re over the East River when he realizes that he’s grinning like an idiot and that Tony is watching him with an unreadable expression on his face. Steve braces himself for whatever’s about to come out, but Tony just raises an eyebrow, as if to say “I’m not looking at you, you’re looking at me.” Steve turns back to the road.
Steve opens his mouth and then closes it again. Tony invited him and Tony’s paying. Besides, it’s not like he can’t afford it. After the waiter scurries off, he decides that “You skip breakfast?” is a safely nonchalant overture.
Steve doesn’t have to think about the answer for very long. “Only if it’s my treat,” he tells Tony firmly.
, Google tells him, is a restaurant in the Bowery. The chef’s name is Gabrielle Hamilton. He pulls up the website, which has menus posted. He’s not too sure about
Tony remembers which building is Steve’s, of course, and parallel parks expertly across the street from it. It’s on the tip of Steve’s tongue to thank him again when Tony says, “Same time next week?” It’s only sort of a question.
He’s uncertain about leaving the car with the valet in front of the little red awning, but Tony doesn’t say anything, so Steve just folds a fifty around the keys and tells the kid to take care of it. Inside, the restaurant is tiny and unassuming, nothing like he might have expected Tony to choose. There’s an open kitchen full of bustling women and no tablecloths. The staff are also very good at pretending not to recognize them. Steve starts to relax as Tony orders cocktails.
A couple people at the other tables stare after them as they leave, but Steve can’t tell whether it’s because of the amount of food they’ve consumed or because they’ve been recognized. He can’t bring himself to care all that much. When the valet brings the car around, Tony snatches the keys with a triumphant “I’m driving,” like it isn’t his car. Steve puts the to go bags in the back seat and gets in without complaining.
It starts with a text a month after the battle of New York. Steve thinks he’s just about gotten the hang of texting. It’s kind of like sending a telegram, he reasons: good for urgent, time sensitive communication, less good for nuances of detail and emotion. He’s stopped adding salutations and signing his name to them. The text is from Tony, whose number was already in the phone when he gave it to Steve after taking personal offense to his flip phone. It says, confusingly:
“Counting on it,” Steve says, hopping out of the car. He’s halfway up the stairs to his apartment before he realizes that he let Tony drive off with all of the dessert.
Tony solves the problem by reaching over and scooping up a spoonful of the fried potatoes sitting closest to Steve. Steve retaliates by sticking his fork in the salad in front of Tony. It’s bitter and crunchy and sweet, laced with
Tony’s watching him from across the table while pretending to look at the dessert menu. Steve’s watching Tony while pretending to google "rouille" on his phone. They catch each other at the same time. Steve looks chagrined. “This was all really great, Tony,” he says. “Really great, thank you.”
, which seems dangerous but interesting, when Tony closes his menu with a snap and looks up at the hovering waiter. “How’s one of everything sound?”
They clear out the first round of food in a series of skirmishes that culminates in a battle over the last buttered turnip. An hour ago, Steve would have said he hated turnips. The staff descend on them to clear the table and bring out half a dozen more plates. They’ve forgotten how to pretend that they don’t know who Steve and Tony are, but Steve can’t bring himself to care very much. He’s too busy trying to secure the grilled pigeon for himself while Tony sucks the juice from one shrimp head after another with unconcealed relish.
Steve’s respect for the man has grown since their first prickly encounter, but he doesn’t know if they’re friends. He remembers Tony’s hand, warm and strong shaking his own, but they hadn’t spoken. They haven’t spoken since. He considers whether he wants to be Tony’s friend. He’s leaning towards yes, though some of their exchanges on the Helicarrier still ring raw in his ears. Steve knows that he was more than a little wrong in his initial assessment, and that he’d shot his mouth off when Tony goaded him. Maybe Tony has realized the same.
When the plates start to arrive at the table, Steve understands Tony’s optimism. They’re not exactly small, but a regular person would probably need two or three to make a meal. Not only is everything more or less recognizable, it also smells delicious. Tony orders more cocktails while Steve tries to figure out how they’re going to share the food.
, where the staff are willing to pretend that he’s just another customer. He looks at their flower arrangements for a long time after his grooming is done, but in the end he decides that this is probably not that kind of date. If it turns out to be, he can always send Tony flowers later, but his face burns imagining the torrent of sarcasm that turning up with flowers for a business dinner might earn him. They’re nice, though. Balanced, masculine. He buys a vase for his kitchen table and walks home whistling.
All night Rogers watched from a distance as the Billionaire smiled and made small talk, Tony was so in his element. He was like a shining star out there among all the celebs and media giants. He took it all with grace and cocky grin. It made Steve's throat dry just watching the other man gesture with his hands or sip sweet champagne . He couldn't waist to taste those lips.
Making his way to the sitting room, Loki opened the sliding glass door to let Duchess in; James did not typically let her in anymore since she was so large now. In this case, Loki was willing to spell away the hair on the rug just to have the feline like beast near.
Days turned to Weeks and weeks to a month then two, somewhere in all this things changed. Bucky went from the guest room, to the sofa in the master bedroom, to the bed.
There was a moment of silence before the Widow returned “ Nope, just left the weapons vault though. Hydra’s got a lot of new toys you might like.”
Thank goodness for those two, “Thank you Irene, actually I received the text alert to your new flavors?” Loki commented while James squared the little ones away in the booth.
Of course after a few years Steve got doe eyes looking at fathers and there little kiddes at the park during his morning runs and Tony couldn't say no to that dopey look Cap had. Next thing you know they are knee deep in diapers, duplo blocks and onsies.  It wasn't all bad, actually Tony had to admit that watching Peter grow up was pretty great. From first words and first steps to first day of school the billionaire had set out on a mission to be a better man than his father had been.
Between the yellow brick road and the horse of a different color, Steve quietly thanked Professor Erskine. Even if the Serum had changed him in some negative ways, the positive out weighed them. Steve would go through any amount of pain to see red, because red was Tony. It was loud and brash, warm and passionate. It was fire and mayhem yet sweet as apples and cherries.  He tightened his grip just a little on the alphas hand then.
Apologizing wasn't exactly something that Tony was well versed in. He was basically the King of never admitting when he's wrong. This time though, he was wrong. He did what he did to get home but part of him liked it – a little too much and that terrified him. Extremis was changing him, more than just physically and Tony didn't want that change to take away the very thing he fought so hard to protect.
Bath time went well, Steve was quietly immersed in drawing little shapes on the side of the tub. Once the little was clean his Daddy helped him out and into a warm bathrobe. It was yellow with floppy ears and one of little Steve's favorites.
“We’ve got him Tones.. Can you tell me what happened?” Bruce asked as Coulson and his team gently took Steve away from him. Simmons was shining a light in Steve’s eyes and Tony breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Steve’s head turn from the bright pen light. He was ok, well maybe not ok ..They needed to know what caused this.
Natasha set her tea cup on the table and looked the man who was once her enemy in the eye. “Because like it or not, we worry about you. Steve, Bruce, Pepper. Me. James especially. People notice things Loki, just as if I'm noticing them right now. I'm telling you the truth because I think you're sharp enough to know I didn't come all this way to do paperwork and even if I had, I wouldn't have stopped here. I'm here because I needed to find the truth. Now, do want to tell me? Or are we still having our little tea party?”
Barnes was up and out of bed faster than you could say Assemble. Walking down the hall looking all the world like some annoyed shaggy old German Sheppard on a perimeter check, alert to every little sound or lack thereof. Rounding the corner into the seemingly  quiet and empty kitchen, yet there  was a half empty glass of water on the counter top, the container still cold to the touch but the ice still mostly solid. The scattered presence of condensation beading on the outside of the tumbler in the shape of fingers told him it had not been abandoned for long. Maybe 10mins at the most given the slight chill in the air and the thickness of the glass.
Steve’s life had stopped there and then. He was frozen in the moment, mourning the love of his life.
Tony let out a quiet groan, trying to raise the white strap on his director’s uniform that he’d been working in, but it hurt to move his shoulder. There was a giant gaping burn creating a tear in the costume, but it wasn’t the uniform that worried Steve, it was the man inside it. “Come on director, I’ll get you patched up.”
Peter was just about ready to launch himself at Tony, but his spider sense wasn’t tingling. The boy stood there, staring at the man that he’d thought was dead as he spouted out something about the chemical compound, which was a discussion that was only held between the two in private. It wasn’t a huge conversation either, just a quick passing by sort of chat.
Steve smiled, embarrassed but proud. He wasn’t used to the attention but the constant rubs on the shoulder from Tony made it all worth it, knowing that he was standing next to someone that he truly cared for, that would risk his life for him.
“You’re alive…” He repeated. “You’re alive… And well, and… You were dead.” It was difficult at that point to choke down the emotion. He had been on an emotional roller-coaster, but all that mattered now was that Steve was alive. He could ask questions later and even though he wanted to surge forward and press his lips against Steve’s, that goop on his lips was rather off-putting. His fingers moved to cup his jaw, raising his head to look him properly in the eyes again. “I’ll get you out Cap, Zola’s been disabled. We’ll get you home…”
“Whatever, I’m sexy…me and my fantastic chin are just gunna go back to sleep then.” Tony grumbled turning over and dramatically pulling the blanket over his head.
The thought calmed her; she enjoyed the awestruck look on a pitiful human’s face. The way they looked at her and knew where they stood on the food chain. It was intoxicating to have such power.
Bruce, of course, did his best to make this exchange as low pressure as possible. Having James by his side as they sat and spoke with the Doctor about his findings, were a bonus. If he had to have sat here alone it would have surely ruined Loki's progress thus far. The omega felt his palms sweat as he gripped tighter to the war worn hand of his alpha. James just held on tighter and listened, never wavering as the words kept coming.
Loki held the sick little pup in his arms, Tony had managed to agitate a school of stinging jelly by trying to chorale the little creatures together and make them glow as bright as the ones that floated through the palace halls. He was unaware that of course that not all jellies shared such docile disposition. The little boy had annoyed the translucent creatures and found himself mobbed in retaliation for his rough play.
“We need a few things, I would have gone for them but you could go to the shops if you like.” Loki said abruptly, tugging the sheets tight around his body.
Fury had a move toward the man to try his usual technique of staring the younger alpha down, this time however he was in for a surprise.
Steve ran his hands over the armor, gears whirling as the billionaire inside was set free. Tony stood there a moment shivering in the under suit before large familiar arms wrapped around him. They didn’t say anything just then. They just breathed, It wasn’t until Tony felt the hitch in his soldiers chest did he mutter any semblance of word. “It’s over now…It’s over now.”
Steve was having a full on panic attack, gasping for are on his hands and knees. The thick bulletproof/ hulk testing glass - Tony ‘barrowed’ from Bruce’s lab to set up the prank. Now sported a huge crack, although judging by the blood smears on Steve’s carpet; the super soldier’s fists took the majority of the damage.
According to Bruce, they would know more toward the end of the year if Steve’s levels dropped naturally or not. He seemed to think they would, “Now that the serum recognizes this as a natural occurrence I doubt you’ll have a problem for the next one. If you do we know how to address it now.” the doctor had said.
The next strange acquaintance he would meet was an old friend of his fathers. She was not a mer but something else entirely. Lady Hel of the Helheim trench. She was the mistress of creatures who lived in the darkest reaches of their world. Some shunned her, saying her mother was a powerful mer witch who had unnatural relations with a kracken. Loki was not exactly sure that was true as he had her word there were other like her that preferred not to enter the higher waters.
Natasha just hummed and chewed her own doughnut, it’s amazing how she could be a murderous assassin and be sitting here with hot pink frosting around her mouth.
After this conversation is what led to a formal messenger bringing a letter to the tower. Natasha said no.  After all, she wasn't just going to make this easy. Loki wasn't hard to look at and yes he was trying. They all found out he had been brainwashed during the invasion and while Thor admitted his kid brother was kind of a dick, he wasn't normally a mass murderer.
Barnes felt his phone vibrate insistently in his pocket as he walked across the compound. Normally he'd ignore it, because if it were something important Fury would have overridden the silence feature or sent an Agent to track him down. That was before things at home had taken such a down turn. Part of him flinched every time his phone rang when he was away, he had this six sense that there was something coming. Some dark cloud looming just out of sight. James just prayed it was a storm they would be able to weather.
“How are you feeling?” Doctor Simmons asked as Steve lay there smiling thoughtfully at the captured image.
“And it brings joy  to my heart to see you such a glow with child Steven. I trust Anthony has been caring for you well?”
He was not broken….until spending months in a cave with a car battery hooked to his chest. He was not broken until he saw what his father’s legacy really meant - death and destruction. Terrorist using Stark weapons to kill Americans. The broken bodies of young soldiers, their youthful faces marred with blood and uniforms riddled with bullet holes. Limbs bowl off by bombs bearing the Stark logo.
Tony leaned back in his chair and pinched the bridge of his nose, he was getting to old for this shit. It seemed like that was becoming his new mantra ever since the grey in his hair was threatening to put down the deep brown."I don't want to know what you did and you need to leave. I know for a fact Thor has you on curfew."
Tony did not let it show, but this information worried him. Steve was one of those ‘never leave a man behind’ types … even when that man might just be trying to kill you. The good Captain liked to say he could make the hard decisions but the fact still remained - he couldn’t kill a friend. That good faith in honor and humanity was going to get him killed one day. Tony just hoped it wasn’t going to be any day soon.
Love is a tightrope of emotions and despite the deathly spiral below – you finds yourself willing to run head long down the narrow way. It is accepting things when your stubborn heart wants no part in it, it’s saying ' I believe in you' when you're terrified.
From there things disintegrated, when Steve looked up Vengeful was barreling toward him. Steve dropped back and slammed the shield up to bank the side of the suit.
Tony put down his coffee with a theatrical put out sigh, “Party pooper, come on baby cakes.”  The alpha started, walking up and rubbing his shoulders. “I was thinking about what she said ya know, I’m not going to pressure you into anything but I’m game for making this little team Iron Shield a thing ya know? Considering that we have the minions on the way and all. Why wait right?”
Maybe she hadn't seen, what was there to see..he just liked to mess with Cap that's all. It was innocent really just a touch of a hand, a few well turned innuendo...a kiss. It wasn't anything so scandalous.
Tony rolled over and eyes his omega, he had been up way too long.  Long gone were the days of 72-hour invent-a-tons, now he was beat after your standard workday and chasing around two little ones. Today had been a nice reprieve, he only had one SI meeting to attend then took Steve out to dinner at a nice fusion restaurant. A really classy sort of joint that you have to reserve a month in advance. All in all, it had been a good night. “Steve, if there’s a point to this I’d love to hear it babe. In 10 words or less if you can manage.”
A little bit of old fashion brute force and the hinges gave way. What he found inside wasn't anything he'd ever want to see again.
Entering a dark room wit floor to ceiling wood paneling and blazing amber colored lights. They stoop around what could have been a shrouded coffin. Stark took an edge of the red velvet and tugged it away.
“Brothers!” Thor boomed throwing his arms wide, apparently he’d expected everyone to run forward and hug him and was disappointed when they didn’t.
Thor offered to take Loki back to Asgard; he said maybe one of the kingdoms healers could help Loki. The omega hadn’t said a word since that night at the hospital. It had been three weeks, they buried their daughter - James named her Cecilia. It was one of the names on a list Loki had started to make, something about it seemed right. Like he could picture himself chasing a toddler and calling ‘come on Cece’, he wasn’t going to get to do that now.
Steve never saw himself as a ‘good omega’  not before the serum and not after. Before he’d been too sickly, and then… then he felt like a freak. Yet, Phil had a point. How often had he lorded over the others when they were hurt or fretted over people eating enough. Even in the field, he gravitated toward comforting civilians and trying to protect those he saw as vulnerable. “ I understand, I could manage with just the team but, it’s the world know that worries me.”
Tony nodded, the fog finally starting to clear from his head. “Yeah, thanks guys but I’m not waiting.”
Loki took the little dogeared photo of smiling child with big bright eyes and sprigs of wild sandy blonde hair. The little boy had a few thick scars on his cheek and neck but it did not distract form his wide gap-toothed smile. “He's adorable.”
"Come to enjoy the magnificent view Banner? I would comment on if the lovely scenery was worth the effort but..."he gestured halfheartedly at his hazy irises." I have not much of an informed opinion on ascetics these days."
“Jane!” Thor shouted, he had been separated from Asgard's newly crowned queen in the madness. He now found her and hurriedly pulled her to him, “you must go with my mother and the others, secure the little ones and get as far away as you can!” he commanded as the guards rushed forward and Mers scattered in terror.
“Nothing important, So. How are things at the school?” Her tone was conversational but even in that airy tone he could see it in her eyes. A predator that smelled blood in the water. He wasn't going to give her this… it was different now. He had his full mind at his disposal. He wouldn't be goaded into a fit of pique like before.
Tony grinned back and pulled up a chair, “And here I am with out a set of dominos. That means having an actually conversation.”
There moments in life that feel so pure, when the sun shines it's brightest and the air tastes sweet. Days of gold where everything feels blessed. Unfortunately, these days can never last and life is seldom so easy.
“Darling...please refrain from..” Too late, the omega took a huge bite and was now moaning louder than Loki had ever successfully been able pull from him. Really, he was a tiny bit offended. What did that greasy fatty monstrosity have that he didn't? Well there was bacon...and bacon was amazing.
“You’re so beautiful like this.” The alpha whispered, peppering open-mouthed kisses over every inch of flesh he could reach. As cliché as his brain told him it was it was true. Something about seeing Steve laying here by his side so warm and plait with belly swollen with life. Knowing he put it there was both terrifying and beautiful. “I love you, I want you so bad baby, want everyone to know you’re mine.”
That the house, the work, living out in the work and reconnecting....but then, this wasn't Loki's world was it.
“Yeah yeah,” His hands move mine and he’s smiling, that cocky little grins and crinkles his eyes. Not that to big press conference one he uses when he wants something. “Good news though, I didn’t break Captain America, I just…added on an extension.”
However, right now this wasn't just Loki standing before her crumbling. This was the omega of her pack brother, that's who James was to her – weather he like it or not. By extension, Loki was hers too, and she never left pack behind.
Fury could see how this was going to end, Hydra would have its new world order if someone didn’t do something. The question was…what that something was.
“Tony...” The profound uncertainty was clear in Steve's voice. “Are you sure it will work? I just don't...I can't lose you.”
Bruce spent his days video chatting with Dr. Cho and other bio-mech specialists, each one offering a little more than the last. The Doctor felt he was slowly getting somewhere on his research of Extremis and the possibilities of the nanotech. Consulting charts and investigating blood and tissue samples were a daily occurrence between checking in on Pepper and Natasha. They both felt he was working too hard, but Banner would not hear it. This was for Tony, a man who was as confusing and annoying as he was loving and generous. A man whom had become a brother to him. This was his family and that was something that Bruce thought he would never have the joy to know. So if he could do anything to help Stark, he would.
"Such intelligence, you obviously like your fathers. I'm sure you will be very good at murder Frisbee and ...whatever Stark does. "Now, I am Loki."
Thor had been looking for his nephew at the time when he saw the cluster of gelatinous cnidarians swarmed around the small boy. Thankfully for Tony his Uncle reached into the angry mass and yanked the limp little pup free. Given Tony’s size, if he had not been found he very well could have died or suffered irreparable damage.
“They just want us to know; now we do. That doesn’t mean anything is for sure…hell, I should have never made it this long with all my questionable life choices- but I have, and look at you. We are the epitome of underdog success and this kid is gonna is going to be the best of both of us. Smart and devilishly handsome like me, and strong with the biggest heart and sharpest sass just like you. If anything we should be worried more about all the hearts our little boy or girl is gonna break.  Cause you know what they say right? They are twice as bad as you. I pity Barton when his kids hit that pre teen phase, we may have tiny archery fiends running wild.”
Natasha walked over and wrapped her arms around the beta's middle pressing her face between his shoulder blades. “You're a good man Bruce. Don't ever doubt that.”
Tony spotted the blond seated alone at the dinning table after the sun had set. Stark was a bit of a night owl himself and considering the excitement of the last few days- he was still feeling wired. It hadn’t gone unnoticed to the alpha however, that since the meeting about Barnes; Steve had been aloof from the pack. The soldier hung around the fringes of conversation or disappeared to the training room for extended periods of time. When dinner rolled around Steve would beg off to shower and come back to eat alone.
"Why did you do it...I thought you were ok, I thought we...were ok.." Steve shuffled through pictures trying to make sense of it all. Trying to look for some sign there in prints that would pin point the moment it all went wrong. Then again, maybe it had been wrong for so long that it meshed and melted with everyday. Every smile that did little to warm those brown eyes, every laugh that was a little forced. Looking back it all felt so different now. He questioned every conversation and tried to recall every single word they spoke in anger. "I should have seen it. You should have told me..." Then the darkness comes and he blames himself. "Would i have listened?"
Back at the tower an increasingly worried AI had discreetly paged the towers only other omega to the penthouse.
Any other time there might have been a pair of Bruce’s spare pants, or even one of Tony’ clingy under suits. No such luck. Today he was with Natasha, and she only had one thing handy.
Just when the soldier thought the world was turning to putty, his husband pulled back with a wet pop. “Get the lube babe.”
“Noted. Jarvis get us some chow from the great north will ya buddy.” Tony dropped his libido in favor of staying on good terms with his omega. Moreover, he knew Steve well enough to know that after lunch he would get all snuggly and then if the inventor played his cards right - snuggly turned into horny quickly. God he loved those hormones sometimes.
Scorpio, like villains’ do - brought reinforcements in the way of a mechanical army. Why did they always have to bring an army…?
“As have I.” Loki replied gently leaning back into his soldiers strong chest. “Will you pour the wine?”
Normally Steve would have balked at the order but his head was still a little hormone fuzzy and having Tony tell him what to do felt nice. He'd get a little grumpy later but for now his hind-brain was content to lie back down and let Alpha take care of him.
“Steve! It’s your call.” Natasha’s voice rang over the ever-nearing sound of choppy water and rumbling beneath the sea.
In retrospect Tony should have seen this coming, of course Steve would want to be on point for this mission. It was Hydra, it's what the man lost 75 years of his life for. Anytime they had a Hydra mission Steve was always chomping at the bit to get on deck. This time wasn't going to be any different. Yet...it was different. There was a lot more to lose this time around .
Loki was strong, Bruce knew that intellectually. But it wasn't until the broken toilet, fridge door, front door, coffee table, and several sets of silverware later – that Bruce really got the message. Loki had a tendency to 'express himself' very freely on the things they owned. It was lucky that Banner was currently on the Stark Industry payroll or he wouldn't be able to afford all of the repairs.
Stark looks down at himself for the first time and the question sinks in. Its like changing gears in a car the way his mind shifts and he feels...shame. On the one had this new body is amazing, on the other it’s like there's something changing him.
Tony looked over, noticed the shine in his dates blue eyes, his attention narrowing on the omega as he lifted there joined hands, and kissed the back of Steve’s.  A sweet gesture made the other smile again, so Tony counted that as a job well done.
Nothing about what he was currently looking at had anything to do with traditional delicacy or dishes to promote a healthy offspring. This was fatty over-processed crap.
“You may wanna go with a traditional ladder, rope ladders can be dangerous “Natasha commented as she and the Captain engaged the oncoming jeeps in tandem. A rocket is launched whizzing past her as she quips about Barton’s weekend projects- earning her an odd look from Steve. “What? …he get’s excited when it’s his weekend.”
Still, things seemed to be going well enough (which if you’re Tony ‘well enough’ is a relationship milestone). Neither of them had given a name to what they had, it wasn’t necessarily -courting, in the traditional sense. It was more of a trail run, or as Tony might say a ‘testing stage’.
A swarm of snowmobiles and jeeps breached the hill; this was the largest installment of Hydra they had seen to date. The loud roar of the engines cut through the air sounding like a swarm about to descend. The team readied themselves for the assault, boots digging into the powdery snow.
She didn't say anything, thinking about her conversation with Bucky. The way he was so sure Loki had been into see Bruce. The omega had lied, but was it a malicious lie or something else? It wouldn't be hard to imagine that Loki would be nervous about being around Bruce despite every effort Banner had made since the ravens return to earth.
It felt strange but it wasn’t the first time he’d said something to the unborn twins. However, before he never expected them to be listening. Sure, the baby books said that the fetus could hear and distinguish pitch and volume; he just couldn’t see how they could be too sure about it. It seemed like a silly, but in that moment, it felt right. He wouldn’t begrudge the omega who placed headphones on there stomachs or sang lullabies to children they couldn’t even hold yet.
For the next hour Tony paced around the room like a chicken with its head cut off. Just watching the man made Steve dizzy. Still there was something endearing to the madness - it showed how much Tony cared and that made Steve feel things he knew were dangerous. There was no way Tony thought of him like that; Steve had told himself that repeatedly.
The woman rolled her eyes, one was dark and black, the other milky white. “I know your father; tell that trickster that Hel sends her regards. Now, you boys follow me I will take you along the north side of the trench and from there you can surface and return to Asgard. By then the beast should have sought out another resting place. Let this be a lesson to you both.”
Peter was so pleased with his first place blue ribbon and Tony cried, (Shut up Steve it's my allergies)
They both knew why but thankfully, Hansen didn't call to make this an uncomfortable conversation about a one-night stand over a decade ago. She was kind enough to explain how the nano techknowledgy had expanded to encompass a branch of study that had led her down a path that no one should tread. "...Extremis is the solution to the sought after super-soldier serum, I never meant for it to be that but when I saw what it could do. It got away from me, I trusted the wrong people.”
The group loaded up the ship, another gift from their benefactor, with all the tools and supplies they would need and caste off. They set a course to an area known as ‘the dark pool’. An anomaly somewhere in the northwestern seas where the water was so deep in a certain spot that it appeared as a large black pool. Sailors never crossed fearing that the depth may hold a beast, and arrive at the location was often met with turbulent seas. Stark was sure that if could convince a group to go there, that’s where they would find the sirens.
Steve shook his head, “Your Daddy’s a lunatic..” drumming his fingers over his stomach. “Guess its just us then.”
Natasha didn't think much of the occurrence until she heard more than humming and looked over to find her partner singing and bopping along with his binoculars .
The tap of motorcycle boots echo through the dusty old warehouse. She tucks her hands into the pockets of her vest and walks along under the row of industrial lights. The place is quiet, desolate, vacant…or is it.
“Ah, I suppose that would be a give away wouldn't it.” Thor comments, scratching his head before hanging his hammer on the coat rack. The weapon looking comical next to a collection of rain jackets and umbrellas.
“Chill out and don’t be an ass. You ain’t going back out there, we have this handled.” Barton spoke up before confirming over the calms that they had Tony and were headed in.
There was a slight a slight spark that dances up Loki's spine when the human took his hand. Something warm and cloying that curled up in the back of his brain. Something that whispered 'this is what you've been waiting for'. It was absurd to think the human would understand his actions or the repercussions he had just unleashed.
Loki tugged off the over-sized sweatshirt he'd stolen from James. He felt warm and a bit disgusting, the idea of a long lazy shower sounding more and more pleasant.
James just smiled and held his face in his hands. “Because I love you. Because you are worthy baby.. because you're you. I'm sorry that you have to ask because you should know that by my actions. I haven't... I haven't really been there for you.”
Steve frowned working over the words, he knew Bruce was just trying to help and in these days ‘options’ wasn’t the dirty word it had been back in his time.  “You mean if I decide not to take the risk? If I just… give up now rather than later?”
If Steve chose his old friend, Tony would step aside. It would hurt but he would, but he’d have to hear those words. Steve would have to tell him to leave. Until then, he was in this with all he had. Seeing Steve laying on the ground bleeding had done something to the inventor. Something about holding the omega when he feels apart, he needed Steve and part of him truly believed the other man needed him too. Maybe he had felt this for a while now, biology be damned. Even if Steve had been an Alpha like the stories said, Tony would still be standing here wanting him. Needing him…and falling in love with him. He would still be making his case even if it was a losing battle.
It felt like a sudden pop, like when you sit down in a dark bathroom and fall right in the cold water because someone left the seat up.
Coulson left the meeting feeling apprehensive. There was no reasonable doubt in his mind that Fury couldn't, and potential would go through with the threat. However, that would be contingent on something significant going wrong in the tower. Stark would need to get a handle on his current power, and they would need to pull Loki out of the deepening darkness before the man cracked.
This little snippet of intelligence was deemed ' Need to know ' by the powers that be - something that James was on the fence about.
“Stark!” The soldier shouted before launching himself at their opponent’s back- this turned out to be a mistake as Mallen's body glowed and discharged a massive electrical jolt. Barnes found himself on the floor smelling of burnt leather and singed hair. His teeth ached and vision blurred, everything in him screaming to get up. He couldn't just lay here with Stark being pummeled; he had a promise to keep.
“Of course, take all the time you require.” He leaned in close with hesitation, she allowed him to place a kiss on her cheek as though they were brother and sister. “I love you Amora.” he wanted her to say it, to look in her eyes and maybe see something change.
He declines Thor’s offer, he knew how Loki felt about Asgard. “I’ll handle it.” the solider assured. “I can take care of him. He just needs time.”
The beta smiled and slipped on a pair of gloves, “Ok Steve I’m going to check your gland, and then I’m going to do a quick saliva based test to assess cynical output of your o-estrogen as well as your current A-Testosterone, progesterone and cortisol. This will tell me if we can try and hold you off heat, or if we should go ahead and try and get you through it by giving you an o-estrogen a boost.”
He could feel all that and more now through testing his new limits with Extremis. Each time he uses it he feels euphoric. It's a high that he's never known before, better than any drink or drug that he's ever experimented with in his years of being a club kid and party boy. It's like sex, love, happiness and joy all experienced at once and when it's over...the world seems duller.
After the failed attempt at domination back in 45, Schmitt found himself torn through space and time. Unaware of the world or worlds he passed through, or of his existence on the world that found him.
“Welcome home Papa.” Peter said softly as he smuggled into Steve’s side. Tony, who was on Peters other side, wrapped his arm around his husband and kissed his cheek. Things were going to get better, and this was just the first few steps toward that.
Just as he’s trying to figure out how long it will take him to get from Red Hook to the Bowery on his motorcycle, factoring in evening traffic, his phone pings with a text:
Bruce notices how anxious Tony is getting so he puts the phone down on the table and turns his body towards his friend. Puts a hand on his shoulder. “Look, you are attracted to him, hell maybe
“Babe?” James reached over and clasped his hand. “If you need it, I'll leave the car unlocked and you can come out here ok? If you need to get away for some quiet time alright?”
He would not make the same mistakes as Odin had, he would never hide his child's parentage like a dirty little secret. Loki would tell his child the truth early and often. He would inform them how they were chosen over all others to be his and James' how their family was empty before they came. The once noble would make sure his child never felt the sting of a lie like he had. Never the bitter crushing of what once was a joyous life.
Steve knelt and placed a single rose before the grave, he kissed his palm and touched it to the etched name. Anthony Edward Stark. "You were the right partner.."
Steve inhaled deeply through his nose and closed his eyes, “Stark…you covered. My Shield. In Rhinestones…”
There was that smile of Steve’s, that big, crooked, almost childish smile. “I hear someone one else likes him too, and you used to accuse me of running into trouble.”
The coppery smell never left, the tingling of his raw skin calling out to the atmosphere for protection only mimicked the longing for a touch that would never come. A comfort of strong arms and a steady voice that was just distant memory. A memory that was also twisting into nightmares. There were nights when he would see Steve standing at the foot of the bed - blood bubbling out of his moth and reaching out. Tony would shoot up screaming with the lingering disembodied words of his husband’s broken voice ‘you weren’t there when I needed you.’
While Captain America slept in a frozen grave the world moved ahead by leaps and bounds. Leaving him a man out of time. A shining example that would grace the halls of museums and dazzle children’s stories. They would have no idea what really happened.
Stressed from work, yeah Steve guessed that could be it. It wasn't his business anyway. “You training today to or did Fury pull you for a mission.”
That was actually worse in the grand scheme of things. He couldn't imagine not being there to see his little girl walk down the isle. Seeing his boy graduate, lying next to Steve when the blond in the soldier’s hair turned silver. God willing Steve would still love him then. That maybe they would be one of those couples you see walking in central park on a temperate spring afternoon. Walking hand in hand, one with a cane and both with there cardigans and scarves. They would be slower then and would stop half way at a familiar park bench and watch the sun light up the city skyline in hues of gold and magenta. Steve would probably harp on him for not wearing gloves when there was a light chill in the air. ‘you know how you’re hands ache.’ he’d say and maybe Tony would roll his eye, ‘that just means it’s going to rain. Plus, I have you to keep me warm, right soldier boy?’
“Yeah, yeah ok…sure.” Howard moved to gather up the bags of gold when he noticed the siren step into the cabin. He wasn’t immediately alarmed - she had just saved his child’s life after all. It wasn’t until he saw her reemerge holding the buddle babe that his brows furrowed.
There were times Tony had wished Steve wasn't so damn self-sacrificing, then again look at some of the stunts he himself had pulled. Then something else occurred to the alpha. “Steve...could you be... I mean, hell I don't know if you could tell but..” Even the thought of this now worried him. “Could you be pregnant.” It was too much to hope for and maybe selfish considering the state of things in the tower, not just between. After the talk he'd had with Barnes Tony knew there was enough bad news to go around. He'd love to have one spot of sunshine right now.
Ever since Thor had shown up with the gangly little brat all those years ago. Tony watched this kid grow up...he shouldn't look at him like this.
In a few years, Tony would surprise everyone by perching on Sleipnir back and speeding through the current whooping at the top of his lungs. Not that anyone would question…mischief must run in his blood.
Avengers Tower, Tony wanted them all there. Bruce was actually already there and had his own floor just above the Labs and Tony’s workshop. Between that and the common floor there were four vacant floors, above were three more and then of course the Penthouse.
He should have known something was wrong when Pepper came into the lab with Bruce and Happy. Should have seen that "group solidarity, let's keep Tony from losing his shit." look in their eyes. Should have noticed how pale Bruce looked before the good doctor gathered up Peter and walked out before Pepper even started.
One could almost see the AI roll his electronic unseen eyes. “Shall I file it with your Sasha Grey collection Sir?”
"Can you breathe alright?"  Bruce was touching his face now and the doctors hands felt nice and cold.
“Doubtful.” Loki chuckled. “I do apologize if my absence has been inconvenient. I will understand if you have to find someone to take over my position.”
It was difficult for the alpha to touch down in central part alone, knowing that for everything his omega had done, and he had commit even worse sins. The only difference that separated them was a mask. No one knew who the winter solider truly was. The public had seen grainy images from a distance and shaky cell phone footage of the street fight in Washington. Steve and his pack, the avengers, they made sure to keep Barnes name out of the papers.  Steve in his infinite protective nature.
The agent had glanced over to see Jemma speaking to a group of teens and captured her eye before leading Loki away to an adjoining lab. She tilted her head in understanding and trigger a button that frosted the glass between the labs for privacy.
It may have been comical if there had been a cricket in the tower at that moment. However, Jarvis maintained strict anti pest protocols. Therefore, the room was silent save for a soft ‘wow’ from Clint.
Behind them, the team would snicker and offer various comments of ‘get a room’ or something to that effect.
When Steve came back out dressed in a pair of track pants and tank top, he had to pause and just watch his little family for a moment. Peter was laying there tracing the lines of the arc reactor with his fingers as Tony talked to him about his sleep over with Aunt Tasha and Uncle Bruce. Apparently, Uncle Bruce let him help make salsa and they watched Tarzan.
“Indeterminate... What the hell dose that even mean?”  Tony scoffed tossing the medical work ups to the side and reaching for a small leather bound journal that had been in the envelope as well. He knew immediately by the handwriting who had penned the notes before even reading the name.
There was a beat of silence before the lift doors open, clearly the AI had thought better of his orders. Considering Tony's hatred of constantly having to repair something around the city following an assemble. A code green in the tower would in no way end well.
“Since they've been back he hasn't exactly been sociable. We all knew that and for a while it was the best thing for the pack to interact slowly considering the past. I just thought things had gotten better for him when Bucky told me he started teaching. Last time when I picked the twins up he just didn't seem like himself. Distant I guess.”
He poured out a mostly full cup of tea and headed to get prepared for the day. It would have been easy enough to snap his fingers and dawn a familiar suit and vest. Somehow, Loki couldn't bring himself to do so.
Tony shifted his blurry gaze to the voice reaching out through the ringing of fear. He sees the being gleaming in the water before him and thinks for a moment that it is one of the ‘Norns’ his father told him about. Tony used to laugh at those stories armored shining spirits that protected their people. Directly gazing at the glowing face and shield Tony wondered if the Norn had come for him.
Any doubt that may have resided in Steve's mind was gone. He could do this, and he is keep doing because it is worth it. Everyday it's worth it.
The door to the penthouse opens and Steve feels guilty for wanting to get up and leave. This is his Alpha, his love, his husband and yet...he doesn't feel Tony at all. It's as if all they have built is broken. Like this man, walking down the hall with such familiar footsteps is someone all together different.
“Stebb..” Tony’s groggy voice asked, his glasses where askew and lines from the blankets stood out across his face.
“No, you’re not ruined. You’re just a lil heartsick, bit I’m right here and I promise we’re gonna make it.” James’s voice cracked as he pressed a kiss to Loki’s neck, nuzzling above the omegas bond mark. “We’re gonna make it.”
Steve felt a little better having someone to commiserate with in times like this. Plus, Natasha was in the office watching the video feed from the Shield Jet and staying on coms with Clint and Phil. She would know if something happened. The omega tried to take a deep breath, nothing was going to happen. Bucky was there, Phil, Clint, and the Shield team. Tony was capable; this would be a milk run and his alpha would be back in their bed tonight. Tony would be there to tuck in Peter and Wendy, to tell them stories with the voices.
Beck shook his head at first but then the gauntlet began to tighten around his throat. “Y-Yes! I-I’m Sorry!”
It was in these early days that their luck began to wane. Holding their tiny child between them in a world build for two, the Rogers would soon find a wolf at their door.
The armors arrived moving the partition just as Steve sank to his knees, staring at his knuckles as they slowly healed.
The old man grumbled a bit and pilled a cigar stub from his uniform pocket. “Ya do the same, go to work, help with the pup. Don't be a slouch and change diapers, washin a dish won't kill ya and keep lovin em. When you're mad and the boss man is breathin down your neck, when the bills come in, dosen't matter. The old man grumbled a bit and pilled a cigar stub from his uniform pocket.”
So perhaps a political or government official? Neither of these was favorable. Stark was in no mood to put on his press smile and talk about executive committees or some feel good ribbon cutting invitation for the avengers. He was certain he'd throw up if he had to attend another such event. Surrounded with people that couldn't care less the state of the country or its citizens. As long as their pockets were carefully lined with precious tax dollars and their brats got into Ivy League schools.
Steve rolled his eyes and let the shield fly - knocking back a row of approaching combatants. His adrenalin thrumming through his veins and his team together and now Tony at his side. They where gonna give Hydra hell..
The omega had no idea how long he had been mindlessly staring. “Fine, holiday break coming you know, have to test my students and calculate averages. Just thinking.”  His lie went over, if a bit shallow in effect. His alpha seemed satisfied enough and that was enough.
These thoughts and feelings were even more clear the farther the group delved into the documents from the golden realm. Finally, after sifting through what was little more than old wives tales and hearsay, Bruce happened upon what appeared to be a scholarly journal on the frost giants. The official style of the text was much more fact based observation than emotional opinions on what should be done about 'beasts'. Included among the writings was an especially interesting section on the social habits of the Jotun.
Pretty much everyone in the tower realized this one right off. From the vent crawling to the "perching". That last one, Tony. Would later argue took years off his life.
For a moment Steve felt complete calm, like a switch had been tripped and everything that had been so unsure before began to settle. He felt grounded and strong.
“I help?” Loki felt the tug on his pants before the little request was voiced. Looking down he spotted Peter. The little pup looked adorable, sporting a wild case of bed head and clinging to his teddy bear.
“Is...Is he ok?” Tony felt his heart breaking. Why hadn't he felt that sooner? The whole time he hadn't felt Steve at all. No pain, no fear...now that he thought about it. He didn't feel anything.
Tony genuinely liked spending time with another Alpha. Someone to challenge and just hang out with, someone he could talk to and on some level confide in. They were connected in a strange way; Tony was a tie to Steve’s past, so much like the man he once knew - yet not at all like Howard. It grounded the solider in this new time, gave him something familiar and safe.
Oh great and there's Steve looking beautiful, skin still flushed from heat. “Shower first, ok? We...we might need to leave.” Tony said, trying not to betray any worry in his voice.
Like after New York, sure they all tried going their separate ways but somehow they all gravitated back together. Watching out for each other, lending an ear for late night calls when nightmares came. They had formed this odd little group that somehow worked.
Sneering at the billionaire in his shining silver armor that's gleams under a spray of blood and gray matter. “yes it would seem so, then again perhaps I should ask you...one vile creature to another. How does it feel, to be a monster?”
Tony got up and moved a seat closer; leaving behind the remnants of the popcorn, he’d been mindlessly snacking on. “Care to share with the class Mr. Rogers?”
James cannot help but worry, he does his best to be there every moment. Brushing his lover’s hair in the morning and trying to coax what little food Loki is willing to accept. In the days when all Loki wished to do was curl up in bed- James was there too, curling protectively around those long slender limbs. The alpha did everything he could to pour out as much love onto the broken doll his omega had become. Early mornings spent whispering sweet words and evenings bathing the once prince when the other man could not bear to move a finger.
Peter reclined against his uncle’s chest as Loki read the story. He liked how his Uncle's voice sounded; it was almost as good as when Daddy read to him, daddy did all the voices in books. Papa was good at reading at night too because he cuddled and smelled good in a way that made him sleepy. It was different with his Uncle Loki, the way he spoke and even sometimes when his uncle would show him magic and make the pictures in the books step right off the page.
Tony hacked every computer and cell tower he could in the area, he didn’t eat or sleep because really he was so pissed he thought he’d vomit from sheer aggression alone. When he got his hands on these guys…
Yet nothing seemed to help. Sure, Loki was not spending his days under covers shrouding him safely away from the world, but he still managed to separate himself. Maybe he had been doing that for a while now. With his sharp tongue and worries. Now that James really sits there with this knowledge, he can see the last year in such painful clarity.
The long lean form presses against his chest and shivers. When did it get this bad? All James can do is hold on and whisper softly that he's here, that he's not going anywhere. “It's ok sweetheart, It's ok I promise.”
There was a time Natasha had made the drive up to the compound at least once a week while training the new SHIELD recruits. Other times she'd head up with Tony to make repairs or adjustments to the quinjet.
Now Tony found that he was the one thinking to much and what point was it for them to watch a movie when no one was actually watching it.
Tony could see the wheels turning behind those blue eyes and interrupted the negative thoughts with a kiss, offering another suggestion “Nope, you’re back can’t take that and I don’t want to risk you falling. Try getting on top.”
Barnes held his omega and tried his best to sooth Loki. Telling him how strong the ravenette was and how their baby had to be strong.”
Steve loathed mentioning it aloud; as if the perfectly natural function was some dirty secret, he leaned in and muttered it low in the alpha’s ear. “..I’m…wet….there’s a lot of slick. Down…there.”
This was one such day, like so many others when Bruce entered his apartment at the tower and found a very pensive Loki glaring at a Stark pad. Glares were not good, glares meant someone had said or done something and now Loki felt compelled to make some sort of grand statement to the contrary. The last time one of these glares got out of hand- Tony was turned into a ferret for a week. While that wasn't necessarily dangerous...it did make for a small fuzzy and highly volatile billionaire scurrying around and stealing everyone's keys, watches, cellphones,...everything. So Bruce tried to be a little more observant moving forward from that little slip up.
Steve laughed and watched the kids make a run for their playroom. “That's just going to get worse the older they get ya know?”
“No Doctor Banner, See I have processed. “ Tony interrupted standing from his workbench and walking right into his friend’s personal space. He almost wanted Bruce to hulk out. Maybe he could see if Vengeful had the same chops as the Hulkbuster. “I have processed, I have self examined and reevaluated. I have meditated and fuck me even prayed. I did all that transcendental bullshit you love to preach about for about two seconds and then I realized something. None of it will bring Steve back!”
Tony realized, to his horror, that it could be possible. They didn't really know how extremis worked yet, as it never had a human clinic trial – and for good reason. “An army of immortal healing soldiers, yeah that sounds as fun as a colonoscopy with dental tools.”
Sure enough, Tony fired up the suit and the right boot sputtered and smoked. Enraged the Vengeful armor used its remaining booster to launch at the Captain.
Natasha Romanov was sitting on a bench in Battery Park, having just gone on a morning run. She had been quietly staying just in the shadow of Stark Tower - keeping an eye on the owner. Her phone began to vibrate, glancing at the unknown number she swiftly moved her thumb across to accept. Not just anyone could get this number. Not even a mistaken dial could, there was the number and then a code one would have to use.
Bruce moved around to ease the billionaire back into a chair. “Good job Tony not only did you manage to impregnate a national icon but you’re an over achiever.”
Rhodey rolled his eyes. "Yeah but he made the mistake of marrying that idiot so we are." Snapping shut the face place and taking to the sky.
His alpha shrugged and lay by his side, his wonderful work worn hands moving downward to Steve's belly. “Well I never do anything half way. You should know that by now.”
“Loki I can't do that, your body temp is too high and given what we know about your resting temperature it could be dangerously high for you. I need you to let me help you, and answer a few questions if you can.”
“If you want the best for me, let me do something I know how to do. Let me show them all that there is more we can learn from the above! I’m not going out there being stupid! I’m innovating!” Tony screamed, fists clenched before storming past his father.
The soldier stood there looking down at him pulling a handgun from his belt. He motioned with the gun for his captive to stand.
“Tell me what I said..” he blurted out, “ If.. if you’re Steve, tell me what I said in your dressing room before we got married. Tell me exactly what I said to you.”
“Spread your legs for me honey. Yeah just like that, up on your knees a little beautiful.” Tony said trailing finger tips down the backs of Steve’s thighs.  Rough hands palming and spreading him even more.
AN: Ok, I wanna address this before I get chewed on by fans, yes I know there is some debate on who created Falcons wings, some people say Black Panther, some credit to Stark Industries.  So just for the sake of this fic, I’m siding with Stark Industries as the manufacture. This is not a slight to Black Panther fans in anyway; it’s just how it works in this ficverse so there ya go.
There's an indignant huff on the other end of the line. “Well hell I thought SHIELD was! You'd think a shadowy organization devoted to the protection of mankind would keep better tabs!”
“Bruce is there anything you can do for him?” Loki prays there is because he's seen men go mad before and if Stark is truly dead then the children will need their surviving parent all the more.
Steve relaxed into the embrace things finally felt like they were getting back to normal. While it was true that nothing would never be the same, it didn't mean it had to be bad. “That sounds good to me. Jarvis, would you?”
The idea itself was purely accidental; he received a package to his office that should have gone to Phil. Coulson and his damn memorabilia.
