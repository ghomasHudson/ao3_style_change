I reached the part for the Age Play, finally XD.
But then, Phil had fetched one diapers from the drawers – the guest room ended up being the room Steve was turning into a nursery, the same one Clint had told him about with a delighted expression on his face, as he had never seen so many toys – and that was enough to upset Tony once more. He had tried to run off the room, though Phil had been able to react rapidly this time and blocked his way. He had also stopped him from locking himself inside the bathroom or the closet too. So, feeling trapped, Tony had curled up into a small ball on the furthest corner of the room, and he had stayed there for the last twenty minutes.
“Tell who what?” Steve asked without taking his eyes off Clint, who was sitting on the floor very close to the TV. Phil had asked him to get away from it because he was going to harm his eyesight, but if Clint tended to be a bit too careless about these things, his Little self was worse.
“What?” Steve sounded stunned, “Why? You already know why I’m going to look for him,” he admitted, like if that statement explained the pressing necessity about why he had to leave.
“First,
“What are you doing?” Tony asked after several minutes, peeking around the pillow.
After a few more minutes, Steve’s insistence paid off. Tony began stirring, unconsciously leaning into the touch of his hand – Steve loved that – as he slowly came awake. His eyes blinked open, and for a moment he stared at Steve without really seeing him, his eyelashes fluttering several times more before he became aware of his surroundings.
Because no matter how hard he tried to avoid it, Steve couldn’t help visualizing Tony in Clint’s place. He couldn’t help wishing it was Tony instead of Clint the one who smiled broadly whenever he offered to play something fun; the one who worshipped him just for making him a milkshake – behind his daddy’s back – the one who felt asleep listening to him reading out loud a story; the one who ran away from him, laughing so hard even if Steve hadn’t caught him yet to pin him down and tickle him. He wanted Tony to be the one he could take care of that way.
But Tony being Tony, and in his stubborn mood being more Tony, decided to ignore the warning tone of Steve’s voice, and in the seconds when his anger was bigger than his logic, he took the plate of pasta in front of him and threw it right on Steve’s face. The plate fell down to the floor, breaking into pieces, and Steve’s face was left decorated with cheese, tomato sauce and some noodles. Now Tony did stay still, literally feeling how all color drained from his face. Regardless still being angry, he could realize he just screwed it up big time.
“Agent Barton is already in the elevator, waiting for you to allow him into the floor,” JARVIS answered.
“Yes. Well, unless you’d used my tablet before. When you use it, all the pop-ups usually show me advertising of painting tools and things like that,” Tony informed, turning a bit around to he could lean his arm on the back of the sofa, facing him. “So, I was intrigued when the ads showed me something different today, because there was no doubt they had to do something with the last things that were browsed in here," Tony said, raising the tablet so Steve could see what the screen displayed.
"What's wrong?" Tony asked when he heard Steve ending the call and felt him getting up from the bed.
“Wait a minute,” Tony heard Steve saying when he was few inches away from the living room. Those were good news, Steve hadn’t left. He might have gotten bored and had come outside to watch some TV while Tony slept. He hastened his steps, the urge for being cuddled by Steve becoming impossible to quell, and Tony would have run towards him instead stopping dead if Clint hadn’t been standing right between Steve’s legs, struggling to get away.
to give it a try. That was pretty much decided. It was a possibility Tony ended up not liking it, but it was also probable that if he didn’t let himself experience what the whole Age Play thing was like, he would never get that peace of mind he desperately looked for and needed.
“Don’t worry, actually, it wouldn’t be convenient if you felt little right now.”
“I’m just saying, Sir, if Dummy, You or I have to see you pacing back and forth for one more day, there might be a possibility we learn to feel that sensation you call dizziness.”
Why the hell had he come up here in the first place? What had he been thinking about? What was he supposed to say now? “Hey cap, would you like to be my daddy?” That was so lame. So inappropriate. So sick. Damn nightmares and their ability to unsettled him, Tony would have still been safe in his workshop if it hadn’t been them.
“Clint! I don’t have time for this!”
____________
That had been exactly what Steve wanted for Tony. That had been exactly why Steve had wanted to give age play a try. It was supposed to be a way for Tony to relax, to forget about everything even if it was only for a short while, to leave aside all his responsibilities and concerns so that he was able to let go, to allow himself to be taken care of, to focus only on being loved. It was true that Tony had progressed a lot since the first time they age played, and he had been clearly getting more used to his role as a baby, but Steve had been afraid that Tony wasn’t really enjoying the experience, that he didn’t know how to slip into that headspace as Clint did.
“No,” Tony denied when Steve tried to push him away for him, throwing his arms around his neck to refrained him from going away.
“Well, your deduction skills seem to be getting a little bit rusted. If you don’t stop this bullshit once and for all, you will end up hit by a lot of more things. Considered yourself warned,” Tony threatened, folding his arms against his chest, almost pouting.
“In my defense, I can’t make myself do anything else until I finish a drawing. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with an idea, and I need to draw it, otherwise I can’t go back to sleep.” Steve confessed, a hand scratching nervously the back of his neck, already knowing this wasn’t what Tony would like to hear.
“I’m afraid you’re doing it again, Sir,” JARVIS warned.
“Whoa, whoa, Tony, sweetpea, wait.
“He did tell you sir, he went down to the workshop yesterday at night while you were working on the new design of the suit and he told you about it. I can show you the footage if you like, sir,” the A.I. offered. Tony could detect a bit of disapproval in his voice. It wasn’t the first time Tony was totally oblivious of something due to being too immersed in whatever he was working on. “Do you want me to try to reach him, sir?”
Steve tightened his embrace as he turned his face so he could look at Tony. He smiled, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to smile back, making Steve purse his lips in disappointment. Looking after two kids couldn’t be easy, and Tony understood that. It would actually help if Tony ended this nonsense, stopped pretending to be little, and helped Steve take care of Clint. But he still didn’t want to, and looking at Steve comforting Clint in such a loving way made Tony finally realize why. Tony was jealous. Steve was
"I'm so sorry, kiddo, I'm really sorry," Steve apologized, overwhelmed with guilt.
Finding himself constantly craving for those things he claimed not to need was beyond shocking, and Tony didn’t know what to think about that. Whenever he was too stressed, he had a bad day or he was a bit under the weather, the only thing he wanted to do was going to look for Daddy and let him make it all better the way only he knew how. The feeling that nothing wrong could happen while being in daddy’s arms was the thing that Tony missed the most, and even though Steve hadn’t broken the habit of hugging him every chance he had, it just wasn’t the same sensation.
“Sir, I know you want to make sure everything gets properly signed, but I highly doubt Ms. Potts is going to be happy when she sees you’ve signed three times the same sheet,” JARVIS commented, snapping Tony out of his stupor.
Steve would have liked to say that Tony fell asleep no longer after that, but he didn’t. Tony kept dozing on and off for almost an hour, stiffing several times when his eyes opened and his adult mindset was stronger, whimpering almost imperceptibly when his little mindset had won the battle and he could sense the pain coming from his hand. But thankfully, Tony didn’t try to get away. All Steve needed to do was to pull him closer again and to keep rocking him, humming a lullaby he didn’t even recognize. Tony had been craving for this his all life, he just needed a push in order to gather the enough courage to take it, and Steve was more than willing to give that push.
A bit hesitatingly, Tony waddled further into the nursery and headed for reading corner. For a moment Steve thought the bookshelf would be Tony’s first selection – something easy and not that incriminatory to begin with – but his baby went past it and extended his left arm to reach for the back of the rocking chair. Wary brown eyes glanced at him, as if looking for approval, and it was clear some of the tension left his shoulders once they ran into Steve’s smile.
Little or big, Steve was trying to make Tony get use to ingest something nutritious before eating junk food. Tony wasn’t very fond of the idea, though he hadn’t really refused to it either. As long as the quantity of healthy food wasn’t more than the junk food, there were no complains. Clint, on the other hand, would have definitely protested if Steve had told him he had to eat some salad before the pizza. That was why Steve had refrained himself from even proposing the idea, he didn’t want to give Clint more reasons to want to leave.
“What?” Tony exclaimed, clearly taken aback.
“I won’t even start on how wrong and blasphemous that phrase was,” Steve commented, a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. A low groan escaped from Tony’s lips, the sound muffled by the mattress and the pillow. “How are you feeling?” he asked. Tony mumbled something not even Steve’s supersoldier hearing could comprehend. “Okay, I don’t know about you, but I think that pillow’s in the way.”
“Jeez, you take me by surprise,” Steve expressed as he rubbed the back of his neck, “I won’t deny I’ve done those things, but it’s not like I’ve forced him or anything, they just happened. And he’s never seemed to mind, to be honest,” he excused himself, and he truly thought so.
“Yes, baby?”
“Wait a bit more sweetheart, these things are stuck,” Steve said just before a sob escaped from Clint’s throat.
“You won’t have to lift a finger,” Steve assured, already visualizing the arguments there would be when Steve asked everyone else to do their assigned chores (no need for Tony to complain for an umpteenth time how useless it was to do chores when having a cleaning staff, it was all about acquiring discipline, learning to be responsible of their own home and it also served as a bonding time) and they saw Clint doing nothing.
That didn’t help to ease his anxiety or shame at all, because right after Steve said that, he lifted Tony’s hips and slipped the diaper under him.
“Can you tell Steve to come?” Tony asked as he sat up, feeling bad enough to crave for Steve’s care.
“I only wish to make sure you know the effort won’t be in vain, Sir,” JARVIS insisted.
The rocking started to make Tony sleepy again, and Steve’s heartbeats were making even harder to focus on staying awake – when the hell had he leaned his head on Steve’s chest? Bit by bit, Tony’s yearning to leave faded, and all vestige of anger completely vanished when he looked up and his eyes caught the sight of Steve: his head was leaning on the back of the rocker, his eyes closed, his Adam’s apple moving to the rhythm of the lullaby and his expression showed complete peace.
“It’s okay champ, Uncle Steve’s here,” Steve soothed, as he sat down on the other side of the couch where Tony was, swinging Clint’s legs up so that he was sitting sideways. Clint let out a sob, and hid his face against Steve’s chest.
His bladder clenched again not happy with the hold-up, taking Tony out of his stupor. He needed to go
“Hey, no Tony, no climbing out,” Steve warned as he approached him, scooping him up and balancing him out with ease.
And denying that part of him consumed a lot of his time and energy. Perhaps that was why for a while he had been a mess of a highly-functional alcoholic.
Tony looked at it, then he looked back at Steve and then at the hand again, deciding whether to take it or not. Steve was sure Tony knew that, if he took it, he would end up sitting on his lap, so he gave him enough time to make up his mind. He liked having Tony close when they were going to address something serious, since he had realized physical contact helped Tony to speak up, but that didn’t mean he would force any kind of closeness if Tony didn’t want it.
(See the end of the chapter for
It sounded like a good plan. That way Tony wouldn’t have to beat his brain out trying to figure out what he was supposed to do or how he was supposed to behave. Tony had read a lot about Age Play, but Steve had more experience in this area, surely the time he had spent with Little Clint must have taught him a thing or two.
“And I told you not to tell anyone,” Clint said, kicking him in the leg with his bare foot from the other side of the couch.
Nonetheless, he should have known that his secret couldn’t remain hidden forever.
Tony remembered clearly the day he was summoned to his house out of the blue. It wasn’t his birthday – not that it mattered anyway, he had never had a birthday party or anything like that–, and it wasn’t Christmas either. It’s was a Wednesday, in the middle of the school year, all holidays or vacations still very far away. He felt uneasy, having no idea why his father wanted to see him all of a sudden. His hands had started to sweat as he walked to his father’s office, millions of thoughts about why he was there were zooming through his mind. He knocked on the door and went in, and he could feel his knees turn to jelly when he saw his father sitting down behind the desk, holding a package of pull-ups in his hands.

If you saw any mistakes, please let me know :)
What the hell was wrong with him? Did he really feel like crying just because Steve was leaving? Yes, he had come upstairs because the urge to be comforted by daddy had become unbearable, but that didn’t mean he had stopped considering that idea irrational or stupid. If Steve had already something to do, he shouldn’t cancel it because Tony felt like getting some cuddles. It was just not right. Age playing shouldn’t interfere with their activities, that had been something both of them had agreed on.
“Or why don’t you build a nice big castle with your Legos? You like playing with Legos, don’t you, sweety?” Steve continued, hoping one of his suggestions ended up interesting Tony.
“Don’t you want to go with me to order the pizza?” Steve questioned when Clint refused to stand up, his focus still on the straps of the overalls.
“Hey!” Phil complained, but he was completely ignored.
“Never again,” Steve promised, pulling him into a hug once more. This time, Tony hugged him back.
But don’t misunderstand him, Tony wasn’t saying he would have agreed if Steve had asked. He knew perfectly well Steve had never meant to give it a try with the intention of humiliating him or a way to get aroused, Steve’s mother hen trait had always been so tangible that Tony was sure Steve only wanted to take care of him. And, truth to be told, all the research Tony had done about age playing after their argument – no need for Steve to find out about that – had shown him how fulfilling it could be for both parties.
“You’re such a brave boy, daddy’s so proud of you” Steve whispered in his ear. Tony would’ve like to beg to differ, but he already was way too close to his headspace to argue. It’d never cease to amaze him how Daddy’s presence never failed to make him feel very small.
“So, what happened? Are you really here to get some sleep?” Steve asked, still sounding a bit startled.
Tony, which was even worse. It was true that Phil had done everything he could to look after him, however, Steve knew – and little Tony left that clear – that the only person Tony wanted taking care of him when he was little was Steve. Perhaps in the future Tony would be comfortable around another ‘adult’, but not for the time being.
The ice feel of the duvet under his skin made Tony wonder if he was running a fever, but before his hand reached his forehead, it came across with something fluffy. He lifted his gaze and raised an eyebrow when his eyes saw his stuffed dinosaur: Raawry (in his defense, Steve had been the one who had named it, not him, though he wasn't sure when he had started to use that name to refer to the stuffie)  How had Raawry emigrated from the playroom to their bed? Tony had no idea, though he was too exhausted to care. He wasn’t really feeling little, so he pushed him away and reached for Steve’s pillow, closing his eyes and pressing his face into it. It smelled like Steve.
For some reason, he had thought that once he slipped into a littlespace, his adult self would somehow go to sleep or something, and that would be when a younger version of him would go to the surface and take control of himself. That was the only way Tony could make sense of how a person could behave like he had seen Clint doing. Clint cried, had accidents, amused himself with toys, made mischiefs, and so on. No even once had Tony gotten the sensation Clint was faking it. It felt real. Tony couldn’t see that behavior happening if the adult side of a person was consciously there.
Tony’s poor choices had screwed everything up, and now the problem wasn’t whether Tony was going to give Age Play another chance or not, but rather if Steve would take him back. Chances were he wouldn’t. Why would he? Tony had shown him how unreliable he was, how volatile. Steve might even kick him out of the team as a precaution. As the Captain, he couldn’t afford to have a team member who couldn’t play well with others, and since Clint hadn’t done anything wrong, Tony was the one who needed to go.
“What?” Tony blinked in confusion.
Okay, maybe it would take more than an hour to have both littles tucked in.
Tony didn’t answer him at all, he just stared up at him. There was something in his eyes that Steve couldn’t read, and Tony continued breathing with difficulty.
“I’m not saying you are, but won’t you feel better if you knew that, even if you had one, you’ll stay dry and clean?” Clint shook his head once more, “I promise to take it off if you wanna go potty,” Steve persisted.
“Yes, I promised Phil I was going to help him train the newest agents,” he informed as he stood up and tucked the shirt in. Tony would never understand why he kept doing that. “Today’s just the welcome speech and stuff like that, you know, so I should be back in two hours, tops.” Steve walked closer to him and placed both hands on Tony’s shoulders. “I wasn’t kidding, please go to bed right now, I’m gonna call later and ask JARVIS if you’re truly sleeping. If my memory serves me right, you’ve been awake for more than two days, I know your personal record is higher, but I don’t want to come back and find you passed out due to exhaustion,” he begged, looking directly into his eyes, Tony couldn’t help looking away.
“I guess not,” Tony hesitated as he squinted at him, not completely convinced of what Steve had said.
Steve pulled the covers up around his baby’s shoulders as carefully and quietly as possible, afraid he might wake up at the slightest movement or sound. Steve even refrained from putting up the drop-side of the crib just in case that disturbed his sleep as well. It wasn’t like Tony would fall out of the crib, and if by any chance something like that threatened to happen, Steve wouldn’t allow it, since he had no intention of living the room while his baby remained there.
“Yes, young agent, pizza,” the A.I. confirmed. Clint got up from the floor instantaneously and ran to the door as he warbled ‘pizza’.
Sadly, Steve had decided to wait for Tony to initiate anything related to age play (though every passing day it became harder to remember why he’d chosen to do such thing) and he was firmly resolved to be true to his word. It was necessary and vital for Steve to confirm what his baby liked from this role-play, but also for Tony to finally acknowledge all that himself; otherwise, he wouldn’t really be able to make the most of the whole experience. It’d certainly take Tony quite some time to come around, he was too stubborn for his own good sometimes, but Steve was anything but patient.
“Oh, c’mon, don’t look so surprised, we both know that’s what you want,” Phil assured, bending his head a little and looking up at him.
With hunched shoulders and evasive eyes, Tony reached for the now-free pillow and hugged it against his chest, lowering his head and pressing his mouth against the soft material. “I dun wanna.”
Tony stared at him, hands restless and mouth partially open as if to protest, but no words left his mouth.
“I’ll go and get it,” Clint proposed, putting face of good bot. Phil didn’t buy it.
And that’s how everything started. That last thought was the one that made him suit up and punch and kick everything around the room – no repulsor beams, though. He wanted to smash what was in the room, not the room itself.
“I’m sorry if I did something that made you believe I’m leaving you, I promise it wasn’t on purpose. And I mean what I said, I have no intention of breaking this relationship, neither as your boyfriend nor as your daddy, unless you–,”
“No,” Tony denied, pushing the book away, unsuccessfully.
Had Tony not been so distracted, Steve wouldn’t have had to shove him out of the way and receive the attack that had been meant for him, a strike a fully-focused Tony could have dodged easily.
It had been four weeks since the last time Tony and he had shared the bed, and it was just getting unbearable for Steve to wake up in an empty cold bed every single day. It wasn’t like Tony slept with him
Anyway. I needed to distract my mind and this was the result. I hope you like it and sorry again for taking this long to update.
The choice of taking a shower or a bath was presented to Tony, together with the option of cleaning himself up without help. To Steve’s delight, his baby had chosen the bath, and with some cute gestures he had admitted he preferred it when he was given one. Steve had also found out Tony liked it when he fed him, and even if his baby had wanted to sit down on his lap while they had lunch, he’d shaken his head vehemently when Steve asked him if he wished to get rid of the high chair.
What did Tony expect to see? Steve bottle feeding Clint? It wasn’t even a fact that Steve was a part of Clint’s Age Play! Though Tony’s brain didn’t seem to be able to understand that, and a couple of days later, he broke his own promise, getting JARVIS to display the images of what those two were up to once more. And another time after that one. And some others more.
“Don’t run!” Steve ordered, out of habit.
"Would you like another one, sport?" Steve asked, pointing at the pile of shaped pancakes in front of them. Clint nodded, and Steve served one more on his plate, refraining himself from commenting on how unhealthy it was to add as much whipped cream as Clint was doing. Seriously, the pancake couldn’t even be seen anymore.
“Are you gonna be okay?” Steve asked, raising his chin to point at Clint.
If Tony had thought peeing in his diaper was the most difficult part of all this, he had been more than mistaken. Going through a diaper change was more difficult and more embarrassing, especially when Steve didn’t cease to praise him.
Steve had been very nervous imagining what would happen once Tony woke up and saw Clint there. His heart melted when Tony appeared in the hallway, rubbing his eyes with one hand and holding his teddy bear with the other; but then a feeling of dread sank into his stomach when he saw Tony’s expression. Getting mad, yelling at him, refusing to continue age playing, kicking Clint out, those were some of the many things Steve had imagined happening, so it had been a kind of relief when Tony just panicked and clung to him.
Even though Raawry never left the crib – something Steve made sure of, as Tony’s little side had been especially fond of it – Steve couldn’t help noting the soft toy was positioned differently every time he entered the nursery; and unless it had been possessed by some spirit like it happened in those movies Clint had made him watch during movie nights, the only explanation there was for that was someone must have been moving it. It wasn’t like Steve found Raawry on one corner of the crib one day, and on the opposite the next day, it was more like it was a half-inch to the right or to the left where it had previously been, or its face was slightly pointed to a different direction, or it was leaning more on the pillow than before, as if somebody had tried to place it exactly like it had been but failed.
"Wait, let me explain you," Steve interrupted, clearly seeing now what all this was about.
“Why’s he wearing
“He is physically fine, sir. He appears to only be upset,” the AI informed.
Every new thing Tony tried allowed Steve to draw a further line to the limits. He might have called himself ‘daddy’ in the hope of encouraging Tony to do the same, though he refused to answer if he was called ‘Steve’ and not ‘daddy’ not before Tony himself had used that word for the first time. Cups and glasses were taken away as soon as Tony showed him he didn’t mind drinking from bottles and sippy cups. Cutlery stopped being placed on the table after Tony made known that using his hands or being fed was something he was willing to do too. As long as it truly didn’t disturb Tony, Steve was determined to not let him back down once he had moved forward.
“If you hadn’t been so concentrated on looking for the cookies I told you not to eat, you would’ve realized you wanted to go potty,” Steve scolded, though his tone of voice was anything but angry. Clint ignored him, still sobbing behind the cushion he was pressing against his face.
But then, there were the other things Tony couldn’t stand. Like how Steve seemed to not understand how difficult it was for him to slip into his Little mindset, how anxious, uneasy and panic stricken he felt – it was no wonder really, after all, Tony had spent a lot of years believing this was completely incorrect – and trying to help him with this transition would just make him moody and angry. But Steve thought that going on Daddy mode when Tony was in his adult mindset was a good idea to help him. It wasn’t. At all. That just made Tony feel much moodier and angrier. Didn't Steve know Tony was a busy man? Didn't he know he had a business to run? Inventions to develop? A world to save? Updates to make? Couldn’t he understand he did need to be an adult? Couldn't Steve just leave him alone? Couldn't he just leave him sulk and struggle with his headspaces in peace? Why did Steve have to be all over him, paying attention to any hint that told him Tony was starting to get caught between his two mindsets?
“Easy, baby, Daddy got you,” Steve soothed, tightening his embrace. Tony hid his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, not wanting Steve to see the blush that had surely appeared on it. Seriously, why did that word uneased him that way? “We’re going to get you dressed and then we’re going have dinner while we watch a movie. There are some that look really good, and JARVIS assured me you haven’t seen them,” he informed on their way to the bedroom.
Steve’s presence always kept those irrational thoughts at bay. Daddy’s presence always kept bad guys at bay. Daddy’s arms around him could protect him from anything. Daddy would never let anything bad happen to him. The problem was, daddy was nowhere around.
This wasn’t the first time Steve looked after them at the same time, and he had no problem with doing that. But, somehow, his gut feeling was that this time wasn’t going to be as easy as it had been the last time. While he left the bedroom with a sobbing baby in his left arm and an energetic toddler by the right hand, Steve mentally wished they could spend an uneventful afternoon.
They headed towards the guest room that somehow had ended up turning into a playroom for Tony over the last weeks. Steve had taken out all the unnecessary furniture and had refurnished the room with stuff more accurate for Tony’s little self. The only thing that Steve had kept was the bed. Now, there was a street map carpet that covered almost all the surface of the floor; several chests, baskets and shelfs to keep all the toys he and Tony had bought – which were a very considerable number – a bookshelf with plenty of books from which Steve liked to choose and read to Tony, sitting on the rocking chair next to it; a changing table big enough to support Tony; and some other stuff. Steve had even taken the time to repaint the walls and now one of them showed cartoonish dinosaurs on it – the fact that Tony had acquired a certain attachment to a tyrannosaurus rex stuffie hadn’t gone unnoticed.
Tony broke into tears and buried his face in his hands, determination all gone.
"Stop moving," Phil ordered, scrubbing Clint's back as fast as he could without being too harsh.
, just indicated Phil that he was trying to get back to his normal headspace, which mortified him more. According to what Clint had told him, being caught between two headspaces wasn’t fun.
After a lot of coaxing, Tony had agreed to let himself be fed with some veggies (Steve's word, not Tony's) and some chicken nuggets that had undoubtedly been meant for kids – Tony didn’t recall seeing adults eating animals-shaped nuggets ever. The only thing Steve had allowed him to grab with his hands had been the sippy cup filled with apple juice. A sippy cup which Tony hadn’t been too keen to use, he was perfectly capable of drinking from a normal cup and he was sure there were plenty of cups with childish designs among the ones Steve could have chosen from.
Yet, three hours had passed and Tony wasn’t even halfway through. Maybe he should really mute JARVIS, because having the A.I. constantly telling him that he should go and hang out with Steve for a while was distracting him more and more, especially when he had been craving for daddy desperately for the last two hours.
“I know sport, but hang in there a little bit more, please. Just let me convince Tony to get out of there, and I promise we’ll go downstairs and I’ll make you a milkshake so you can drink it while I read you a story. How does it sound?” Phil proposed, and he smiled sympathetically when Clint nodded enthusiastically, or at least as enthusiastically as he could, taking into consideration how exhausted he seemed to be feeling. “You’re such a good boy.”
“This is nice,” Steve informed before brushing a kiss over his forehead. Tony looked up at him, his cheeks growing faintly pink; and even if he smiled back when Steve smiled reassuringly at him, he ended up hiding his face against Steve’s chest. “Sweetpea, I was serious, I meant what I said. I’ve got no problem with being your daddy again. I
After lunch, they moved back to the nursery. Now that his baby was a bit more relaxed and with a full tummy, choosing what else he wanted to keep didn’t take as much time as it had before. He still complained when Steve informed him he had to pick four items now, but he hadn’t tried to get out of the task. The bookshelf, the changing table, the playpen and the mobile (okay, the last one had been a little tricky as it could have easily been taken as a part of the crib, but Steve had decided to let it slip) were the things Tony ended up selecting.
With a nervousness he still couldn’t understand, Tony swung his legs off the bed and stood up slowly. After he was sure he could keep the balance, he walked towards the door. Or rather, he waddled towards it, the diapers that Steve put on him were thick enough to widen his gait a little, preventing him from walking normally. His cheeks heated up, that only made it impossible to ignore the fact that he was wearing a diaper. He wouldn’t have this problem if Steve was there to carry him as he usually did whenever they age played.
“Baby, Clint needs me right now, I’m not gonna leave, I’m gonna be right here next to you,” Steve insisted, but the only thing he managed was make Tony cling harder to him.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Steve repeated, earning a confused look from Tony.
Tony started to blink more and more often. Perhaps if he closed his eyes just for a few seconds once in a while, Tony would cheat his body and make it believe he was already resting. He shut his eyes and opened them again after counting mentally to ten. Tony repeated this action for a while, eventually closing them more frequently and for more time without even realizing it. Needless to say it didn’t take much for him to totally doze off.
Steve’s brow creased. “Sorry? Sorry for what?” Tony gave a shake of his head as he curled up tighter. “Oh, no, no, no, we’re not doing this, Tony, not anymore.” Steve warned, “I don’t want vague or incomplete answers that are probably going to lead me to draw incorrect conclusions. We’ve been doing that, and look, it hasn’t gotten us anywhere good. So, please, stop hiding and tell me what you’re apologizing for,” he finished, a note of firmness in his voice. He wanted Tony to know he was bound and determined about this.
“I don’t know,” Tony muttered.
Steve let out a harsh breath while he grabbed the sippy cup and got up to head towards the kitchen island. He opened the doors of a cabinet, took a plastic glass from there, unscrewed the lid of the sippy cup and poured the juice into the glass. “Be careful,” he asked again as he placed the glass in front of Clint.
Steve leaned over to kiss Tony on the forehead before pulling him gently towards the sofa. “What do you feel like watching?” he questioned, sitting down and guiding Tony to do the same. Tony shrugged his shoulders, squinting his eyes at Steve when he took the mug from his hands and placed it on the coffee table.
There were security cameras all over the Tower, in every single story. It wasn’t like they were there so that Tony could spy on their guests – when he had installed the cameras, he hadn’t even known he would have the Avengers living under his roof – but rather than detecting uninvited people and keeping a watch on some of his inventions which sometimes tended to wander around the building. It would have never come to Tony’s mind to use them to invade his friends’ privacy, because that was exactly what he would be doing if he looked at what Steve and Clint were up to through the cameras.
Tony shook his head stubbornly. “Yes, it was. That blow was meant for me, and you had to step in because I was too distracted to dodge it,” he explained, still whispering, words muffled by his knees.
Tony was jealous, yes, he had no doubt about that. But he was also sure Clint himself wasn’t the one he was jealous of, but his little counterpart.
Then, there was the matter of the blanket. Every time Steve went back to the nursery, he found creases and wrinkles on it, regardless of the fact that he always straightened it out before leaving – a habit he’d picked up when he was in the army. Or the matter of how the crib bumper pads seemed a bit looser and dented, as if someone had stepped on them or kicked them from inside.
It felt really nice to be able to hold Tony, his baby, like this after such a long time. It wasn’t like they hadn’t had any kind of intimacy over the last weeks; once the issue had died down, once Steve had decided it was better not to bring up the topic about Age Play for the time being, Tony had stopped avoiding him and things had apparently gone back to normal. Though it had just not been the same.
“What’s the matter?” Steve questioned with a frown on his face, straightening up a little as he turned down the TV volume.
Needless to say, Tony didn't either remain still or close his eyes. He struggled, cursed, punched, hit, kicked and even tried to bite Steve, but this one didn’t even flinch. On the contrary, every time Tony managed to release himself a little, Steve pulled him closer again, never loosening his grip or stopping rocking back and forth. Steve even started to cooing him by humming a lullaby. That just frustrated Tony more, writhing and stamping more, but nothing freed him from Steve’s hold.
“I’m sure he hasn’t given up on the idea of having a pool in the living room,” Steve commented, earning a chuckle from Phil. Little Clint didn’t seem to understand that they already had a pool in the Tower, no matter how many times they had explained it to him. “But seriously Phil, you don’t have to worry, I’ll keep him out of trouble. See you when–”
What worried Steve was how embarrassed Tony got every time they played. Tony’s face acquired a red shade as soon as he was diapered, and didn’t disappear until he fell asleep. Don’t get him wrong, Steve had always thought Tony looked extremely cute when he blushed, and if Tony had that reaction when he was wearing a diaper and hugging a stuffed animal tightly, well, Steve just wanted to cover him with kisses. The problem was that, while Tony was embarrassed, he refused to do anything but hide.
“So?” Steve prompted His baby screwed his eyes closed and curled into himself as if he didn’t want to be there when the inevitable response was enunciated. “What made you assume I’d leave?”
“No,” Tony repeated.
Programming was something that Anthony FUCKING Stark could do while sleeping! And yet, he was coming across a lot of glitches he didn’t even understand why they were there, it was so frustrating. He didn’t know why he just couldn’t concentrate. Well, he kind of did, but if it was something he hadn’t wanted to deal with a week ago, so, obviously, he didn’t want to deal with it now either. He should have finished the prototype at least three days ago. Pepper hadn’t tried to get a hold of him yet, she always tried to give him enough space when he was dealing with one of the Board’s requests, but Tony was sure it was a matter of time before she started calling him because she couldn’t deal with the greedy assholes in the Board anymore.
Unless Steve didn’t consider himself Tony’s daddy anymore. It had been that thought the one that had made Tony lose his temper, because it could be perfectly possible. And the worst part was Tony wouldn’t have the right to complain about it, since he himself had been the one who had drove Daddy away.
Tony bent down and pushed a button on his suit, which immediately pulled all the pieces together and flew them out of the room. Feeling surprisingly heavy, he walked toward the door with the intention of leaving once and for all. He would take care of the mess later, otherwise he was sure the remorse – which he wasn’t really feeling yet – would make him try to put everything back together again.
“Always happy to help, Captain.”
"Daddyyy," Clint whined once more, leaning against the wall and closing his eyes.
“It’s not that,” Tony half-lied.
But nothing was never easy when dealing with Anthony Stark. He wasn’t just going to give up. He knew this had nothing to do with whatever unfinished gadget he had over his desk. This was because he just didn’t want to face Steve right now. He was still mad at him, he did remember that, and staying with him would just lead him to do what he was successfully avoiding to do for more than a month now. He couldn’t let that happen again. He promised himself he wouldn’t do it again, and he had all the intention of being truth to his word.
“You wouldn’t let me go,” Tony murmured, unconsciously leaning to the touch.
His heart beat rapidly, thick beads of cold sweat ran down his entire body, and his breathing was heavy. Typical reactions of a nightmare, Tony had experienced them way too many times to not recognize them. No matter what he did, he had never been able to avoid nightmares. And he had literally tried everything, from not eating before going to bed to sleeping sitting down. Eventually Tony gave up, due to his lifestyle they were inevitable, so Tony figured it would be a better idea to focused on dealing with nightmares rather than trying not to have them. With the help of his reasoning he could downplay whatever he had dreamed.
“But I don’t want to do either of them! You can’t force me to do anything!” Tony declared, stopping some meters away from the door, being too close to Steve could provide another opportunity to pin him again.
Without any warning, Tony felt how Steve slid his hands under his armpits and lifted him, and before he could register what was happening to do something about it, Steve had put him inside a box and close it. And Tony was the one who played dirty!
“Then go and see your boyfriend already, don’t make me drag you to his room,” Natasha warned. There wasn’t the slightest doubt that she’d fulfill that threat, so Tony turned around and walked down the hall. Entering Steve’s room on his own account would be definitely better than being shoved inside. He even stepped up the pace when he heard her groan behind him.
By the sixteenth time, the food had gone cold and Steve had already lost his patient. He tried to cool off by breathing slowly, and, not even bothering to drag him anymore, he put an arm around the other man’s waist and lifted him just a bit to carry him to the table. Tony surely wasn’t quiet or still during the process, but he certainly couldn’t do anything against Steve’s unnatural strength.
Running wouldn’t be a good idea either, besides the fact that Steve was much faster than him, Tony was so tired he would probably end up falling flat on his face. Asking help to one of the others was out of the question too, what would he say? “Please, help me to hide so Steve doesn’t put me on a diaper”? No fucking way.
Steve squinted his eyes at Tony, then he remembered Tony couldn’t see him. “You weren’t signing anything when I went for you, you were working on your suit,” he accused.
“Yes, sweetheart?” Steve asked as he stood in Tony’s field of vision. Tony would never admit it, but he felt uneasy every time he woke up and didn’t see him around when he knew Steve was supposed to be there.
Steve didn’t insist, and Tony couldn’t be more grateful for that. He wasn’t sure how, but he would have to find a way to live with his face pressed into the pillow, because there was no way he could take it off. There he was, laying on a bed completely naked except for a diaper his boyfriend had put on him. Just the thought of it made his face feel on fire all over again.
“There’s something very wrong with you calling me
Determined to get a hold of himself, Tony wiped the tears with the back of his hands and looked around in search of a chair, a sofa or any surface where he could sit down and try to control his breathing. That turned out to be not such a good idea after all, because that made him really pay attention to his surroundings for the first time since he had wandered into the tower, and he did not like in the slightest the place he was in. Of all the rooms there were in the tower, why did he have to end up in the nursery? Wasn’t he supposed to head for his workshop whenever his mind was on autopilot?
understand why you’re doing it, and Clint feels sad because of how much you miss Tony, but I’m afraid he won’t want to hang out with you anymore if you keep babying him,” Phil stated. Steve remained quiet, not really knowing how to answer to that. It would be awful if Little Clint pushed him away too. “I gotta go, they’re waiting for me,” Phil announced, “Please, don’t take this the wrong way,” he asked, sounding truly contrite.
“I don’t know,” Tony repeated.
Steve couldn't help chuckling. “I'm not naked,” he assured, opening the door of the nursery so Tony and he could step inside.
____________________
“Always!” Clint whined.
Grabbing his teddy bear, Tony got out of the bed, and stayed right beside it. It had been a good idea indeed; he could feel he could actually do it this time. He pushed a bit, feeling confident, and he couldn’t help wincing at the sharp burning sensation it caused. He had been holding it for too long. Pulling his bear against his chest, he tried to relax. After a couple of minutes, a spurt of pee escaped without much of an effort, but Tony clamped down, mortified. It didn't last long, though. Before he knew it, pee began to come out unstoppably and soon a hot and wet sensation spread all over his crotch. Tony squeezed his eyes shut and curled his toes, groaning quietly when the ache in his lower regions were gone.
But, of all the possible scenarios Steve could have encountered when going into Clint’s living room, the one that appeared in front of his eyes was one he would have never imagined.
“Then you will have to be given time-out,” Steve shrugged, turning around again to take the plates from the counter. Being thrown things didn’t actually trouble him, it was just a matter of respect, really.
“You’re just going to hurt yourself, you know. Quit that and go to take a shower, you really need it. Don’t be so stubborn.” Steve said, as he took the ingredients he needed for the pasta.
“Daddy doesn’t like it when you lie,” Steve informed, “if you don’t need a change, how come all the rattles on your diaper disappeared?” he asked, smiling fondly when Tony started to pull his t-shirt down in a vain attempt to cover his diaper. “Come here, sweetheart, let daddy get you out of that icky diaper,” he said, walking closer to Tony.
“Then tell me what you feel like eating, I’ll cook whatever you want,” Steve offered, voice as tender as he could manage.
Still, Tony knew this behavior wasn’t normal at all, what kid wanted to be babied? Most of them were anxious to grow up as fast as possible to be able to do whatever they’d like. So, even though he had managed to get a packages of pull-ups, he didn’t let himself wear them unless it was one of those days when he was certain his bed wouldn’t stay dry, and not just for the pleasure of it.
“Does my baby have a wet diaper?”
Tony irrationally wanted daddy to hug him right now, to comfort him, to help him get rid of that annoying fear and anxiety which refused to leave him alone. He didn’t want Steve to stay, but he wanted daddy to stay. That didn’t make any sense, what the hell was wrong with him?
“Good, because I’m not planning on wasting the afternoon, Pepper won’t be happy if I don’t meet the deadline,” Tony stated, voice determined. That was a lie, of course, because Steve knew the only times Pepper really got mad at Tony was when he missed a meeting or fell behind in the paperwork he was supposed to look over and sign.
Tony looked down at the paper he was signing – when had he started staring into space? – and groaned loudly when he saw three of his signatures at the bottom. How on earth had that happened
“Yes, it is. You’ve been reading that book for hours! What’s the point of making me come to bed if you’re not gonna pay attention to me?” Tony protested, totally overreacting.
Tony looked at the stuffed animal and then at Steve, hesitating. But when Steve moved it closer to his neck and rubbed the Teddy against it, making him giggle almost imperceptibly, Tony took his Teddy away from Steve’s grip and held it tighter against his face, giving him free access to his jeans.
It turned out Captain America did know about his infantilism thing. He had known from the moment they both met. He had known before he became a popsicle. He knew. He knew because apparently his fucking father had been a frustrated writer and had decided to keep a diary when he started to not being able to talk to anybody because he mistrusted them. A diary where he wrote down every single detail of his condition, beside other things. And somehow, said diary had ended up in Steve’s hands.
Everything seemed to indicate that Phil wouldn’t be able to catch his breath just yet.
Sorry for the late update. I've  been more than busy with work and I just couldn't get around to writing anything. Right now I just couldn't make myself work, and I needed a break, and here's the result. Sorry if it's too short.
“Well, I don’t want to answer. That’s it. End of the discussion! Get the fuck out of the way!” Tony shouted, a vein popping out on his forehead, throbbing.
“Please be careful, sport,” Steve asked, nuzzling Tony’s hair.
“No! I don’t like broccoli!” Clint expressed, kicking his legs once. Phil took a deep breath, and wondered if he would witness a tantrum for a first time. He wished he wouldn’t.
What Tony wasn’t counting on was how difficult it was for an adult to piss himself willingly. There was that mental barrier he needed to smash first, a little voice in his head told him peeing in a diaper was wrong, only babies or sick people did it, and Tony was neither of them. Also, there was the fact that, after years and years of ordering his body to hold it, Tony couldn’t really expect to let go just like that, he unconsciously clamped down every time he felt he was finally ready to lose control.
, before it burst. Tony could stand up, maybe if he was in the position he always was whenever he peed, he could fool his brain. It made a lot of sense, Tony never went while being laid down nor seated – those few times he actually did didn’t count, he had been too drunk to stay on his feet – so that might actually help.
However, wanting Steve’s complete attention had nothing to be with being embarrassed. Jealously? That could be a reason, since the beginning Tony had shown certain reluctance to let Steve go with Clint when he was little, so it would make total sense if Tony was jealous of Clint. And if that was the case, Steve needed to clear things up.
“Don’t like it,” Clint complained, scowling. Or that was what Steve thought Clint tried to do, because his pushed-out lips and pink cheeks made it look more like a pout.
Wow, it took me forever to write one more chapter for this story. I don't know, I've been kind of busy, I was hooked with other to stories and I guess I wasn't really in a mood of writing lately.
After some minutes, Steve put Tony down on the changing table and hurried to gather all the supplies needed to proceed in stripping him off.
“Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re doing!” Tony warned, fisting his hands that rested on the table.
Tony would have to leave the Avengers who would surely make fun of him once they found out about this. He would have to kick them out eventually not being able to put up with the constant jokes – a shame really, because Tony had gotten used to living with them. The Board would somehow find out too and would make him quit his own company, not wanting to have a boss who was so fucked up. The news would be talking about this for months, making it impossible for him to ever leave the Tower again. Tony got the felling he was going too far with these speculations, but he didn’t feel like being rational right now, because Steve knew. He knew!
But Tony doubted his patience would be everlasting, and maybe this would be the last straw. Perhaps this would finally drive him up the wall and make him back off. What would he do if that happened? How would he handle this situation on his own? Because he may hate when Steve insisted on Tony letting himself be Little when he hadn’t been for a long time, but at the end of the day he was always grateful for that.
"Wow!" Clint expressed after Steve opened the door of the former guest room. "Can I really play in here?" he asked, excitement clear in his voice.
The rest of the afternoon was an ordeal. Phil never imagined how stressing looking after two littles could be, and the fact that Tony was sick and Clint was overtired just made everything worse.
Why was Tony already there? He didn’t even know that himself. He had had one more hour to think up something, but apparently his brain was rusting, because he could literally think of nothing – or at least nothing that wouldn’t end up in a spanking. Maybe during dinner Tony would come up with a brilliant idea.
“So I’m imagining things? You don’t behave differently every time we have Clint over?” Steve remarked.
Truth be told, Tony was a bit hungry. But going to have some dinner meant they both had to get up from the bed and Tony didn’t want to leave his current place.
Tony sighed heavily and grabbed his cup of coffee, taking a sip of it. Cold. Why was it cold when he just poured it…? Four hours ago. OK, that’s why it was cold. He stood up, stretching, and walked toward the sofa he kept there for nonexistent naps – seriously, when he was working on something that kept him from going to bed, naps were the last thing on his mind, but if he had the sofa over there people thought he did rest and left him alone.  Dropping down into the couch, he rubbed his temples for the umpteenth time that day, letting his eyes get closed and rest while he tried to calm himself down, the last thing he needed was a headache on top of all.
After what seemed forever, his brain began registering his surroundings, realizing he was in fact not back in any cave and there was nobody trying to drown him. His breathing went back to normal little by little, and, with his heart still beating faster than normal, he flopped back down to the bed, grimacing when he felt the cold and sweat-dampened sheets under him.
“No! I was just trying to set them as an example, which I really shouldn’t have,” Steve promised, running his hands though his hair as a sign of frustration. “Please, let’s sit down, let me explain you,” Steve pleaded when he saw Tony standing up in a brusque way.
“Of course you are, sweetpea, you spent all afternoon making and cleaning up a mess,” Steve chuckled, pressing a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Actually, the reason why I went down to your workshop was to ask you if you wanted to go out and grab some lunch. I guess it’ll have to be dinner now,” he acknowledged, tightening his embrace after Tony snuggled closer to him. He shouldn’t be sitting down on Steve’s lap, he only did that when they were age playing, and they weren’t, not really. But if Steve didn’t mind, neither did Tony.
Clint had ended up going to sit down in front of the TV and played by himself, clearly upset.
“Stop that, Clint,” Steve ordered when he saw him trying to unbuckle the overalls.
"Can we talk now?" The blond one asked, getting no answer because Tony was more focus on cleaning the tears with the back of his hand. "I asked you something, Tony." this time he got a nod as an answer. "I'd like a verbal answer, please." And this was the part Tony hated the most when he wasn't lectured while being spanked, because like that he could take the situation as an excuse for not giving answers and not facing him at all, but a lecture after the spanking meant that Steve wanted him to pay complete attention, and that was so difficult when he just wanted to curl on a corner and ignore reality for a little while.
Saw any horrible mistakes in the grammar or spelling? Please let me know.
“I’ve got work to do.” Again, Tony turned his back on him, pretending to be looking for something.
To be honest, Tony didn't quite remember what his train of thought had been in that moment. That afternoon he'd been feeling Little, which had led him to drink in spite of JARVIS's disapproval, but those urges were starting to get very annoying and Tony had just wanted a break from them. After he was kicked out of his workshop – seriously, that learning system he provided to practically all his creations always came back to bite him in the ass –  the elevator took him to his penthouse, where he had to struggle a lot to make it to the hallway without falling down or stumbling on something. Somebody must have relocated the rooms, because the door Tony could have sworn led to his bedroom ended up leading him to the nursery; and instead of turning around and leave as he remembered deciding, he found himself going deep into the room, trying to put the side of the crib down, and when he failed, he clambered into it – something that took more effort and time than it should have.
Phil smiled sympathetically as he placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “I’m sure it won’t, but won’t you feel more relaxed knowing you have some protection just in case?” Tony shook his head, and Phil bit his lips, unsure of what to do.
“Ms. Potts won’t like it either if you give yourself a concussion,” JARVIS said when Tony banged his head down on the desk, a bit harder than he had intended. “May I make a suggestion, Sir?”
“Want my daddy,” Clint said pitifully, tears starting to well up in his eyes.
But it wasn’t, this wasn’t okay. Tony was an adult and he shouldn’t need someone to comfort him after a nightmare. And yet, Steve arms around him made him feel so good that Tony couldn’t bring himself to regain his composure and send Steve away. Instead, he let Steve console him.
“Yes, but whatever it is what you’re working on, it’ll stay there until you go back. Why don’t you rest a little? We can hang out, watch a movie,” Steve proposed, knowing Tony almost never turned down an invitation to spend time with him. Tony pursed his lips, and nodded after a few seconds.
"I got distracted checking some things, but I do have to go downstairs to finish some things," Tony informed, his eyes fixed on the tablet in front of him. He looked very concentrated, up to the point of not kissing him back as he usually did. Weird.
Though this afternoon, Tony couldn’t help focusing more on the advertisement that was displayed on the websites he was visiting than on the content of the websites themselves.
Why hadn’t he gone back to the bedroom and gotten changed? Tony was certain that Steve wouldn’t have stopped him. Then, what the hell was he doing there? Why the hell did he insist on clinging to Steve? It was true that, even if he couldn’t seem to understand why nor how, Tony was feeling little, but he could easily change his mindset if he wanted, unlike Clint, who seemed to be deep in his little headspace and do need someone to look after him. Then, why didn’t Tony do that?
"N-not li-little," Clint argued, making Steve sigh. Clint might be into Age Play, though there were some times in which he didn't like feeling little and he tried to remain “big” – as Clint’s little self referred to his adult self. Especially when Phil wasn't around.
A few minutes later, after he’d gotten a little bit more hold of himself, Tony felt tempted to turn his head around to look at Steve’s face to see his expression, and that desire only got stronger when Steve failed to utter a single sound. Why was he so quiet? Was he waiting for Tony to proceed? Was Tony supposed to list the things he liked and disliked at that very moment? Or had Tony been wrong and Steve hadn’t been paying attention to him and, consequently, he hadn’t heard him?
It wasn’t like Tony didn’t have the ability to drive Steve out of his mind – because he definitely did and he definitely had – though this was something that would never bring out a feeling of anger or resentment in Steve. If anything, the only thing he was feeling now was a rush of determination clawing through him. Determination to show his baby that he wouldn’t turn out to be like everyone else, that he was going all in with their relationship, that tough times wouldn’t make him back out, that he would work hard on becoming someone completely reliable no mattered how long it took. As long as Tony wanted him around – and even if he stopped doing so, there was going to be some sort of resistance until proven to be the right choice – Steve would be there.
“I don’t like it anymore,” Clint affirmed, Phil couldn’t help rolling his eyes.
Clint. Since that night Phil asked him to look after him, Clint had been more open about the whole situation. If by any chance he needed to spend some quality time in – what Steve had come to known as – his little headspace and Steve happened to be around, he would just slip into it.
“I told you I’m not feeling little,” Tony reminded Steve when he surrounded his waist with his arms.
Pouts, those Phil could deal with, as long as Tony didn’t decide to run away one more time, there wouldn’t be no problem. What Phil hadn’t been expecting was to hear Tony starting to cry again all of a sudden for no apparent reason. That had certainly made Phil uneasy, because he was afraid there was nothing he could do about it; if he tried to sit Tony on his lap in order to soothe him just as he usually did with Clint, Tony would surely refuse. And the fact that Tony was calling for Steve, sometimes saying his name and sometimes saying
So, if Clint dealt with stress by pretending he was a kid, it was alright for Steve. Because that had been exactly how it had felt cradling Clint in his arms, alright.
"Clint, pleased stop moving," Steve begged, trying to catch his knees to prevent him from continuing squirming.
“I love you, kiddo," Steve said, smiling when Tony pressed himself more against him.
Without having to tell JARVIS where he was heading, Tony rode the elevator to his floor, and made a beeline for the bedroom. He collapsed onto the bed as soon as he was in front of it, his muscles throbbing in protest. Kicking off his shoes, Tony gathered enough strength to crawl to the center of the bed; lying down with his legs over the edge of the bed was not a good idea anymore, that would surely cause him more pain after a while.
Shaking off the idea that the elevator was moving up quicker than usual, Tony leaned heavily against one of its walls and rubbed at his temples. What was the matter with him? He’d fought back against terrorists, sociopaths, supervillains, space creatures and even a deemed god. Why on earth couldn’t he go face Steve and put an end to this once and for all?
“I’m not forcing you.”
"That's not true, it's bigger. I want a bigger one," Clint demanded as he pushed away his plate.
It was undoubtedly easier to scrub Clint when he wasn’t attempting to get away from him, and in less than five minutes, Phil had already rinsed him, taking him out of the shower and dried him off.
“Are these… toys?” Steve exclaimed, sounding surprised, “why do you have these many toys?”
“No, I-I wa-want my da-daddy,” Clint declined.
“Tony! Are you OK?” Steve asked as he approached him, but Tony was already on his feet, pulling up his jeans. “Jesus Tony, I asked you to stay there. See what happened. Did you hurt yourself?” Steve reprimanded as he tried to get closer to check if there was any kind of injury, but Tony moved further away.
“It’s a deal then,” Steve declared, gathering him into a tighter hug this time. “You don’t have to worry about anything, baby. Let daddy take care of everything.”
“Not helping at all,” Tony murmured.
When they finally were in the middle of Steve’s living room, he dropped him on the sofa not in a very nice way, but not rudely either. Tony didn’t even hesitated to run toward the door once he was free, but the blond guy was already a step ahead of him.
"No, you're not! You're pairing up with capsicle in here!" Tony continued whining, stamping the floor. More mature reactions, damn! "We're not leaving then! We're going to stay here for the rest of our lives and our corpses will be found until they start smelling bad!" And yeah, that sounded even more childish, but he didn't care anymore, because he was already getting mad. He mentally kicked himself, what a fucking great idea had been to give the A.I. the potential to learn! It was a fact that one of the reasons he had created JARVIS was to look after him somehow, but this wasn’t taking care of him at all.
All that made sense, and Tony understood it. However, understanding and accepting were two different things, and Tony couldn’t bear the idea of his Daddy looking after someone who wasn’t him. He didn’t want his Daddy to be anyone else’s daddy, regardless of the fact that Tony wasn’t willing to be his baby anymore. Or was he?
“Oh, I’m sorry baby,” Steve apologized after he heard Tony whining, clearly annoyed because he had stopped reading. “… his heart sank faster than he'd just dived…” he continued.
Another shake.
"What’s the matter sweetheart? Didn't you like the toys Daddy picked up for you?" Steve questioned, pushing a rubber duck closer to him. Tony stared at it, not really knowing what to answer.
Everything he had tried to do to make Steve realize he had changed his mind about the Age Play had been nothing but abortive attempts. Steve hadn’t gotten any of the hints. Tony hadn’t been read to bed, he hadn’t been fed, he hadn’t gotten Steve to play with him with some drones he had especially built for the sole purpose of playing, and even the time Tony had tried to get Steve to bath him, they had ended up having shower sex. It wasn’t that he was complaining about that, but that was definitely not what he had had in mind when he sneaked in the bathroom seconds before Steve.
“I’m my own version of
“What? Who says that?” Steve expressed, taken aback by the answer.
“Yes, you were. We were already a step from getting over with it, and you backed off for no reason at all. You would have left and you would have gotten very moody as you usually get whenever you start struggling against what you want,” Steve explained, pulling him closer and rubbing his tummy affectionately. “It would have gotten you more time, but eventually you would have ended up where we already were. I just wanted to save us some drama and get over it already.”
Slowly and hesitantly, Tony raised his head just enough to see Steve out of the corner of his eye – if he wanted the answers for those questions he was afraid he had no choice but to face Steve – and Tony didn’t know whether to smile or cringe at the other man. Steve was looking at him with such affection, with such unbridled love and with such stubborn pride that Tony felt compelled to wonder if Steve hadn’t meant to look at somebody else. The ease with which Steve showed the intensity of his feelings never failed to be a bit overwhelming.
"You will, but first I need to finish showering you, and I won't be able to do that if you keep moving," Phil argued. There was no way he was going to let Clint lie down on the bed while he was still covered in milk. And chocolate syrup. And cookies. And marshmallows. And sprinkles. And whipped cream. And cherries. And who knows what else Clint had put in the milkshake he had tried to make.
Steve couldn’t help chuckling. He liked this, he liked how light the atmosphere was around Phil and Clint, and how both of them didn’t care to show their daddy and little side even when they weren’t age playing. It showed how comfortable they were with each other, how stable their relationship was. How awful it would have been if they had kicked him out of it. How painful it would be if Tony and him never reached that level, because it would have been all his fault.
“I–,” Tony trailed off, his heart pounding so badly that he was sure he would be able to see his chest bounding in and out if he peeked under his t-shirt.
“I guess this means you’ve missed me too,” Steve said, a smile edging his mouth. Tony continued without saying a single word, though he clung to him even more tightly.
But Tony must have been thinking too loud – if that was even possible – because then Steve gave him the other look, a look Tony hated even more, the whatever-you-are-thinking-on-doing-will-just-make-you-end-up-over-my-knee look. Steve’s looks could be so explicit or Tony could get a little bit paranoid when he felt trapped, or maybe both.

, just much much lamer. My creations don’t turn against humanity, just against me. And they don’t even have the intention of killing me, just making me miserable,” Tony complained, sounding more melodramatic than necessary, according to Steve.
Should he ask Phil to help him? Should he print all the information he had found online and give it to Tony? Should he get JARVIS to display to Tony the websites he had visited? Should he just sit down with Tony and explain him himself? Steve had no idea of how to proceed.
And what to say about bedtime? No matter what, Steve always managed to run into Tony whenever it was time to go to bed, a glass of warm milk always held in his hand. There was even a time when Steve went to his workshop almost at midnight, Tony had been a little bit upset when Steve had asked him to stop working because it was way passed bedtime. But Steve hadn’t left even if Tony had angrily ordered him to. Contrary to that, Steve had sat down on the couch in front of Tony and started to chitchat about something that turned into an unusual fairytale a while later. Tony wasn’t sure about this, though. When Steve began to tell him about HYDRA and dragons, he was already dozing off. Tony woke up on the couch the next day, a blanket wrapped around him, with no memories of how he had gotten there at all.
“I don’t have another one. Drink from your bottle now, and I promise I’ll buy you one tomorrow, you can even choose it,” Steve offered, pressing the nipple against Tony’s lips. Tony pushed it away once more.
“What?” Steve asked, still sounding a bit confused.
“No, I don’t! So stop it!”
Whenever Steve tried to stand up to put him down in the crib, Tony would wake up and refuse to be put away. Steve got it, he wouldn’t have minded holding his baby all the time he slept, but he also thought it was a good idea for him to take the nap in the crib after having acknowledged he liked it. Therefore, Steve waited patiently, and after several more minutes and two more failed attempts, he was able to move Tony around without waking him up.
Clint took a sip of soda, thoughtful expression. “I’m not sure, I guess I never really thought about the possibility of someone else besides Phil knowing about this.”
“You know, online advertising is very annoying sometimes,” Tony mentioned from the sofa, his eyes still glued to the screen. “But people have to admit it’s very ingenious too.”
“You know that you don’t get more done when you multitask, don’t you?”
“That’s why… I thought I didn’t want it, but now I’m not sure, I mean, I’m sure, I
"Why don’t we take advantage of the fact that you’re already awake and come to the kitchen with daddy, sweetheart? You can tell me what you'd like to drink," Steve proposed, palming his behind a couple of times. Tony froze, and his stomach twisted when he felt Steve squishing his butt. "Did you… did you use your diaper?" he questioned, sounding too enthusiastic for Tony's like. "You did, didn't you? Oh baby, that's great!" he expressed, placing his hands on Tony's sides and holding him out and up as he spun, a gleam in his eyes telling Tony how pleased he was. "Daddy's so proud of you!" Tony blushed more furiously, and the way his diaper swayed didn't help at all. "Let's get you out of that icky diaper, we don't want you to get a rash, do we, baby?" he expressed as he lowered him on the bed.
In the end, it kind of worked for his father. He got what he wanted, because Tony thoroughly repressed his Little side. He never got his hands on diapers, pull-ups, or any other of the things he wanted again. Every time he felt his mind slipping into that headspace, he forced himself to stay out of it. Yes, Howard achieved his goal to make Tony believe this part of him was wrong, incorrect, disgusting. But one thing was for certain: repressing and getting rid of it were two totally different things.
Steve sighed. “Let him in,” he said, getting up from the sofa and walking towards the elevator, voice hesitant.
“You still haven’t answered to my question!” Tony complained, trying to change the topic.
At the beginning, Steve had thought about taking it slowly, restarting with the things that he had already done when he was trying to get Tony into Age Play. Steve knew from the start he wanted Tony to be a baby, not a toddler like Clint, but he doubted Tony was going to be so keen on giving that a try. So, taking it little by little would help the idea to sink in Tony’s mind.
His eyes lied on Tony, who continued kicking the door stubbornly. Come on, he was to one who built it, he surely knew he wasn’t capable of destroying it with some simple kicks. If stares could kill, he would be already dead, because Tony glared at him when he chuckled after hearing a whimper made his way out of his throat. The door felt even harder when punched.
Thirty minutes after the movie started, Tony’s mind was still blank. What if he just let Steve have his way? After all, it was kind of Tony’s way too. What if he just accepted this was something he needed? Something that he wanted? What if he just let himself enjoy it and save himself all the drama he usually caused? Tony could actually do that. He wanted to do that. But what if Steve took that as a green light? What if Steve thought he could push Tony into his Little headspace whenever he felt it was necessary? Tony certainly didn’t want that to happen.
I hope you enjoy it. Thank you so much for your kudos and comments, I really appreciate them ♥
As Steve rubbed slow circles onto his baby’s back with the intention of helping him to drift off more peacefully, he looked around the nursery. Tony had basically chosen to keep everything as it was and Steve would be lying if he claimed that didn’t make his stomach flutter. There had been a tiny part of him which believed Tony only allowed him to baby him as much as he did to please him, so knowing now for a fact that Tony did enjoy playing such a young and vulnerable role took a burden off that Steve was pretending not having been carrying.
“And how was I supposed to know that?! Are you all right?!” Steve said, confusion in his voice, as he got out of his shock and stood up, approaching Tony.
There was no way Tony thought he might have been mistaken. There was no way Tony wanted all those things back. That couldn’t be.
Slowly, Steve took his hand and pulled him with the intention of getting him to stand up. Tony refused, shaking his head effusively. Steve waited for a few seconds before pulling again, but Tony kept resisting, he really didn't want to look at Steve's face. It was until the third attempt that Tony allowed Steve to pull him closer, and that sensation of feeling very small took over him again when Steve made him stand between his legs.
"No! I don't wanna wear that! It's for babies and I'm a big boy!" Clint complained as he managed to dodge Steve again. How was Clint doing that while laying right in front of him? Steve had no idea. Perhaps he was being way too careful afraid he might hurt him again, or maybe his movements were a bit restricted by Tony, who was standing right behind him, hand stubbornly clutched at his t-shirt.
"Again,
“That,” Tony said, pointing at the rocket-shaped sippy cup Clint was currently drinking from.
"Yes, sport?"
I hope you all enjoyed your holiday, and even if it sound like a cliché, Happy New Year :p
“Well, excuse me, but someone has to bring home the beacon,” Tony said sarcastically, looking falsely offended, “if I don’t meet my deadlines, Pepper won’t pay me.”
And what to say about the technology? For a long time, Steve had stayed away from any gadget and the only ones he used were the TV, a cell phone – though only for phone calls – and appliances. It hadn’t been that he didn’t know how to use them – it was a complete misconception that Steve couldn’t handle electronic devices because he came from a different era and he couldn’t understand them, he was a smart guy and he surely could – it had been that he hadn’t wanted to, a bit against how people seemed to be obsessed with them.
Phil held out a hand, smiling encouragingly at Tony, but he just stared at it without any intention of taking it.
“Tony, kiddo, I need to get you ready for bed.”
"Why? I'm OK with this, I promise." Maybe if Steve kept insisting, Tony would end up agreeing again.
Tony would never be able to explore his little side like Clint did if he continued with that behavior. Because, contrary to what Tony believed, Steve was sure Tony could achieve that little mindset too. If Tony didn’t slip into it may be due to unwillingness or lack of knowledge of how to do it, Steve couldn’t really tell. The only thing Steve was sure of was that, as long as Tony continued getting practically inert as a result of his embarrassment, he wouldn’t enjoy their play dates as he was supposed to.
Smiling warmly, Steve leaned forward to press a kiss to the side of his baby’s head. Then, taking advantage of the nearness, he groped under the pillow behind them and straightened up once he found the three items he was searching for: a pull-up, one of those normal white diapers meant for adults, and one whose aliens and spaceships design showed it’s been created for Age Play purposes.
"No, I haven't," Steve denied.
“Ohh! You want to keep the crib, is that it baby?” Steve asked, and he was truly impressed by how much redder Tony’s face could get. With long fast strides, Steve bridged the distance between them and reached for his baby’s head to ruffle his hair, “Well done, baby boy, Daddy’s very proud of you,” he praised.
But Tony hadn’t been able to help it.
Up until that point, Tony had thought that that sensation of smallness he began experiencing every time Steve and he age played was what a Little headspace felt like, and even if feeling little was certainly a characteristic of the headspace, on that day, Tony learned it went way beyond that. He wasn’t sure if he was comfortable with everything it entailed.
Sorry for taking a lot of time to update. Life's been too stressful lately (My students had been just awful, but the parents are the ones that get on my nerves most of the time) and I just haven't been in a mood of writing.
“You can’t be by yourself, kiddo. Remember you promised your daddy you’d stay with me when you’re little and he’s not here,” Steve reminded, leaning enough to reach Clint’s knee, which only caused Clint to curled in tighter. “Don’t you want to be with me?” he asked, and he couldn’t deny it hurt a bit when Clint shook his head. “Come on, let’s go and order another pizza, I’ll let you dial.”
Steve tucked the bottle under his arm so that he could scoop Tony up, and headed to their room. There was no hesitation in Tony’s movements when he wrapped all his limbs around Steve’s neck and waist, and he even tightened his embrace after Steve whispered in his ear how much he loved him. He also grunted when Steve began to pat his behind.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can do it tomorrow… or later,” Steve suggested when he looked at his watch.
The following morning, when Steve had failed to show up in their room, Tony couldn’t help wondering if he still was with Clint. After an internal struggle whether to invade their privacy or not, Tony succumbed yet another time and had JARVIS show him what was happening in Clint’s living room.
“Hey, hey, take it easy Tony, it’s okay,” Steve soothed, voice a little shocked, embrace tightening.
With long and hasty strides, Steve walked into the tower and stepped into the elevator, and he couldn’t help feeling a bit perplexed when it started going up instead of down when he asked JARVIS to take him where Tony was. Why wasn’t he heading for the workshop? That was Tony’s favorite hideout, wasn’t it?
“Would you go back to the bed so we can get done with this? I’m getting kind of hungry,” And frustrated, but Steve didn’t say that out loud.
"Well. Then we're not leaving this room until one of these two things happen: you rather let me diaper you or you tell me why you changed your mind." Oh yeah, if Tony thought he was the only stubborn one here, he was so wrong.
Sorry for taking too much time to update. I've been having too much work, and a couple of days ago was my brithday and some friends insisted on going out to celebrate, which I appreciate, but socializing does drain my energy. Right now I'm supposed to be getting ready to go and have lunch with some friends who just gratuated, but I really don't feel like going out, so I sat down in front of my computer and finish this chapter.
“No!” Clint refused right before he screwed his face into a grimace, teary eyes looking up at him as if Steve had betrayed him in a way.
Unfortunately, to that day, Steve was still clueless about that much-needed reason. Whenever Steve had brought up the topic, Tony had literally shut him out. His level of anger began to increase every time Steve ignored his petition of not discussing that topic anymore, until one day he got so mad he stopped talking to him for a whole month. Steve might have wanted to have Little Tony back, but that didn’t mean he was willing to lose Adult Tony, so he eventually had to let it go.
“Anthony!” Steve yelled, interrupting him again, he really didn’t want to know what the proposal was going to be. “Would you please stop changing the topic?! OK, I get it, I know you don’t want to talk about what happened the other day, and again, I’m really sorry, I shouldn’t have gone inside without knocking or something, I assure you it won’t happen again. I just wanted to talk to you to tell you it’s OK. I already knew about that.”
,” he said as he pointed at the splint, “was
“Done,” Tony repeated, a pout reappearing on his face.
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but I get the feeling you’re a bit jealous of him.”
“B-but I-I wann-na pla-ay with th-that,” Clint said in between sobs, pointing at the bucket Tony kept pressed against his chest, hugging it tightly.
“I won’t!” Clint repeated cheerfully, reaching for the glass in such a hasty way that it swung hazardously for a few seconds before Clint could steady it. Steve squinted his eyes at him at the same time he crossed his arms over his chest, but he his exasperation faded considerably when Clint gave him a puppy-dog look.
But the Board’s requests weren’t the problem. Adding new stuff wasn’t the problem either, he already had thousands of ideas. The problem was he just couldn’t put his mind into it. He’d been locked in his workshop for more than…, actually he couldn’t remember how many days, but at least he was kind of sure it wasn’t more than a week. His cell phone was turned off. No alarms rang to summon him to SHIELD. Bruce was off to somewhere around Africa doing who knows what to ease his mind, so he didn’t share his space with anyone at the moment who could distract him. Even DUM-E hadn’t set his workshop on fire! He hadn’t had any distraction at all! And even like that, he hadn’t been able to completely concentrate! And that’s what was starting to give him a headache.
"No, Sir isn't sick," JARVIS answered to him, and Steve could swear he heard a bit of mockery in the A.I.’s voice – though Steve didn’t know it that was even possible. It was common knowledge that when Tony got sick, emerging from the workshop was the last thing he did.
After a lot of persuasion, Steve had managed to remove the pillow from his face. Tony hadn’t last too much without covering his face though. As soon as Steve had pulled him into a sitting position and manipulated him into a t-shirt, Tony had curled into a little ball and hid his face behind his arms, realization hitting him hard. There had not been any pants or shorts in sight, which could only mean that Steve planned to leave him just in a t-shirt and diaper. A diaper that had proved to be crinkly and thick enough to not go unnoticed, but far from being as uncomfortable as Tony had thought.
Sighing deeply, Phil decided it wasn’t such a good idea to contradict Tony, at least not for the time being, “okay, let’s go to your room and see if none of your jeans fit.” It would actually be great if one pair did, that way Phil wouldn’t have to deal with a grumpy little for the rest of the afternoon. “C’mon.”
With that in mind, Steve turned the stove off and poured some milk in a bottle after retrieving it from over the counter. It was a bit too hot, but by the time Steve fed Tony with it, the milk would be cool enough. After adding a little honey, he twisted the nipple into place and headed back to the living room with the bottle in his hands, leaving the pot to be washed later.
“Tony, sweetheart, let me pick up Clint, just for a moment,” Steve begged.
“Well, once you get used to it, the taste’s quite good,” Steve commented.
Steve pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head before getting off the couch, tilting his chin to the kitchen when Tony turned to look at him questionably. Tony opened his mouth as if to protest, but after a few seconds of obvious internal struggle, he fixed his eyes again on the screen in front of them and said nothing. That surprised Steve a little, even if he wasn’t going to go far or for long, Tony had shown reluctance to separate from him during a play date. However, Steve got the feeling he knew the reason of Tony’s behavior, so he decided not to brood over that and made a beeline to the kitchen.
Steve might not know how to bring up the topic with Tony yet, but he was convinced now that ‘as soon as possible’ was the time to do it.
If Clint knew that, by leaning that way, the waistband of the pull-up he was wearing was totally visible, he would definitely get mad.
(See the end of the chapter for
“First, I didn’t give you that, you wanted me to, but I didn’t.”
“Me? Do you want daddy to help you out of that icky diaper?” Steve inquired, biting back the smile that wanted to form. Tony nodded shyly, a strong flush creeping up his face. Cute. “Okay honey, I have no problem with that, quite the opposite actually, I like to make sure my baby doesn’t get a rash,” he complied. “Can daddy place you on the changing table?” he asked, getting another shy nod for answer.
“I'm sorry buddy, but your daddy's not here,” Phil informed, regretting letting those words out of his mouth almost immediately. Tony’s sobbing worsened considerably. “Hey, hey, take it easy buddy, your daddy’s not here, but Uncle Phil is,” he dared to say. Hopefully, referring to himself using such term would make Tony feel more comfortable with him being there. Or that could also cause him to retract more.
So, it's going to take a bit more (not that much) until Tony wants to give it a try. Let's see how this develops.
“Wait a minute, sweetpea, daddy needs to calm Clint down.” Steve explained, Tony shook his head for the umpteenth time that day. Steve took a deep, deep breath.
“I really have to go sweetheart,” Steve affirmed, apologetically. Tony felt his face even warmer because of the endearment Steve had just used. “I promise I’ll come back as soon as I can, and we’ll talk about this, but right now I do have to go with Clint, can you let me go?” he pleaded, and Tony shook his head even if his embrace loosen considerably.
“Is it here yet?!” Clint asked with a huge grin on his face, pout completely gone. Steve raised a questioning eyebrow at him while he lifted Tony from the counter and held him in his arms once more, enjoying the way Tony latched to him immediately. “Is it?”
“Open up, baby boy,” Steve asked, brushing the nipple against his lips. Tony’s body tensed up for the umpteenth time that day. “It’s warm enough to drink now, if we wait more, I’ll have to heat it up again.” Tony looked up at him, and had to look away immediately, inexplicably uncomfortable under Steve’s affectionate expression.
“Clint, seriously, I need to go upstairs and you can’t stay here by yourself,” Phil informed. There was no way he was going to leave Clint unsupervised, who knows in what state he would find their floor once he came back. Phil was not in the mood of spending his free afternoon cleaning crayon marks from the walls, or drying the remainders of Clint’s attempts to have a pool in the living room.
Requiring more effort than it usually did, Steve rearranged the two of them until Tony was sitting sideways between his legs, with both his legs draped over one of Steve’s, shoulder pressed against his chest and back against a crib handrail, avoiding that way to support all Tony’s weight. Being able to have his baby this close and hug him was worth the discomfort, though Steve didn’t want to force his body more than he already was or the healing process would take more time.
“No, I told you I don’t want to do this anymore, so leave,” Tony demanded, but the order didn’t sound like one due to the nervousness in his voice.
“Clint, get down from there right now!” Phil ordered, face lifted towards the ceiling.
“Well, it’s not something I could carry with me,” Steve explained.
“N’body.”
“And you’ll play with me?” Clint questioned with his mouth full.
“Oh my God Steve, would you please tell me what’s this all about? I agreed to come here without telling me what for, but you’re taking forever,” Tony exclaimed, exasperated.
What really caught Tony’s attention were those LEGO toys. Without exaggerating, JARVIS had gotten him more than five thousand bricks in different sets. Tony had spread all of them on the floor in front of him and, with the help of the manuals that were in their packages, he had built an entire city, including police stations, hospitals, parks, office buildings, schools, and even an exact replica of his Tower. Tony was very satisfied with the result, he had even made the cars move by themselves in the streets. Certainly, no kid would have been able to do that. And that exact thought had been the one which made him feel disappointed.
Taking him more time than it usually did, Tony reached the door. The feeling that he was doing something he wasn’t supposed to accompanied him while he walked down the hall, which was stupid. It was his room, it was his floor, it was his Tower, so he could do as he pleased. And if Tony wasn’t supposed to leave a room without notifying Steve, well, then Steve should have been there when he awoke.
Tony sat down on the floor, glaring at Steve, who just look back at him, kind of smiling. Why on earth had he agreed to do this? What had he been thinking? How the hell had Steve managed to convince him into doing such a thing? The captain might not be as good as him at talking people into doing whatever he wanted, but Steve sure had some aces up on his sleeve too. Although, even if Tony didn’t want to acknowledge it, Steve might not have gotten him to do anything, Tony might have agreed willingly.
Steve had apologized thousands of times, he had pampered his baby as much as possible, and he had been all over his boyfriend doing everything he could to make up to him for what had happened, everything that was necessary to lighten the burden of guilt off his shoulders. For the next couple of weeks, there wasn’t anyone else other than Tony for Steve.
"Just because," Tony said as he crossed his arms over his chest, pouting. Steve sighed loudly. That pout meant that Tony was in what Steve started to call "sulking mode", and when he was in sulking mode it was impossible to talk him out of it.
Sighing heavily, Tony robbed his temples, his head started to throbbed, maybe because of all the thinking he'd been doing since he got into de helicopter. Thinking which, by the way, had had nothing to do with his plan of escaping. Fuck. How would he dodge Steve? How could he make him understand that there were a lot of things he needed to take care of and couldn't age-play now? How could he make him understand that age-playing wasn’t the only way he could cope with stress? That actually dealing with what was stressing him helped too?
“C’mon Tony, it’s not that bad, I’m pretty sure you’d like it! I mean, I’ve been showing you how it’d be like and you haven’t really hated it, have you?” Steve risked saying, because pointing out that wasn’t a good idea right now.
As Steve kept agreeing to whatever crazy idea Clint came up to put on the pizza – some of them Steve was certainly not going to allow, but he saw no point on telling Clint that right now – he proceeded to finish diapering him and dressing him. A huge pout appeared on Clint’s face when he realized that the orange polo onesie and the plaid overalls shorts had been meant for him and not for Tony, but Steve didn’t have any of Clint’s clothes within reach and that outfit was one of the only ones which Tony owned – the perks of Tony and Clint having almost the same build – that didn’t look very babyish.
“JARVIS, what the fuck?! Open the fucking door now!” Tony totally ignored the question he’d been asked. “Damn you JARVIS, I think you broke my nose!” He accused the AI, a hand covering his nose.
But Tony wanting to stop this role-play because he thought Steve would leave and thus, he would be left without a daddy, well, Steve’s mind didn’t even know what to make of that. What on earth had he done to make Tony believe he would leave him?
“And I told you I took it back!” Tony found himself stamping the floor again. He was doing that more and more recently, and he certainly didn’t like it.
“Unless you tell me you like to wear tutus when you’re alone in order to relax, I have no intention of talking about this any further,” Tony pointed out, causing Steve to chuckle a little.
“M’tired, wanna sleep,” Tony announced, rubbing his eyes, as to prove his point, before looking up to give Steve those huge puppy eyes which would make him conquer the world without thinking it twice and gift wrap it for Tony if that was what his baby wanted.
"Phil made me promise not to tell you anything about it," Steve informed when Clint brought the topic up.
, he thought to himself.
“What is it, kiddo?” Steve asked, shaking his head a little as though that would help him to feel less sleepy.
“Dummy’s asked me if you had problems finding the way out, Sir.”
“Steveee,” Tony said whiningly as he hid his face against Steve’s chest.
And that was absolutely terrifying. Needing someone in such a way could cause many consequences Tony didn’t know he was prepared to deal with.
- - - -
“Oh, no, don’t worry, I totally get it, I won’t do anything that might bother him,” Steve promised.
"Y-you h-hit me-e," Clint accused between sobs, hands pressed against his left side. "I-i'm te-tel-lling dad-ddy."
“Sorry,” Tony mumbled. It sounded like Steve had had some plans, and Tony had ruined them because of the mess he had made.
It was a shame that that feeling of relief lasted less than a minute. Phil was expecting to find a sleeping Clint on the bed, after all, he had already been sleepy and it had taken Phil quite a long time to deal with Tony; but what never occurred to Phil was to find an empty bed. Where the hell had Clint gone? If Phil was dreading the idea of having to look for Tony all over the tower in case he ran away and hid, having to do the same for Clint was even worse. Tony didn’t climb vents, but Clint did.
“Sweetpea, please,” Steve pleaded, but Tony shook his head. “I’ll be right here with you, I promise.”
“You broke my fingers, I think you broke my fingers!” Tony accused, seeing how his hand literally throbbed.
“What? ...Oh,” Steve expressed, even though that information wasn’t surprising at all – quite the opposite, actually. A sight escaped from his lips as he let go of Tony’s ankle to press his thumb and middle finger into his temples, attempting to fight off the headache that threatened to start and he somehow knew it had nothing to do with his injured state.
- - - -
Steve struggled with all his might to resist the gigantic urge to scoop Tony up, and the hurt pout on his baby’s face made it even more difficult. Turning down his incitements had been fairly easy when Tony had been in his adult mindset, doing it when he’d evidently slipped into his little headspace was proving to be tortuous. Not even halfway through their way towards the nursery, Steve couldn’t take it anymore and held out a hand to him. Guilt flared in his stomach when Tony took it with both hands in desperate contentment.
"Tony, if you don't want me to look after him, you can tell me, I won't get mad or anything," Steve promised, trying to sound as sincere as possible. “Would you mind if I look after Clint?” Tony squirmed, but he didn't attempt to move away. “So?”
Of course, at the beginning, Clint had been very shy, insecure and twitchy. He wouldn’t really interact with Steve unless it was strictly necessary – like Steve being near something Clint wanted to grab or still having some food on his plate when Clint’s had been already empty and he was still hungry – staying beside his daddy – Phil – almost all the time, and even hiding behind him sometimes.
“Wot?” He tried to ask, and that’s when he realized his thumb had somehow found its way to his mouth while he was sleeping.
“No, it’s too small,” Clint said, sulking.
"Kiddo, are you ever going to let yourself go without doing all these things?" He used the word "things" in order to avoid saying "tantrums.". He didn't want to distress him more. "Why didn't you come and look for me if you were feeling like this? I've asked you many times to come and look for me when you feel like doing something this... extreme.".
The doors of the elevator opened as Tony kept waging war on his own head, reveling Steve. Looking up at him, Tony mentally wished Steve wouldn’t go away, he was certain that having to chase for him would just make him lose his determination and walk back to the workshop.
Steve brushed a kissed on Tony’s head and stroke his hair with affection, “alright baby, why don’t you get changed while I put away everything else?” he proposed as he pushed his baby away just enough to be able to stand up without shoving him by accident.
have bars.
“I’m afraid you never stopped, Captain.” Steve had to chuckle at that.
Internet had proven to be a very helpful tool to find cute baby stuff that fitted Tony, and Steve made sure he got as many as possible. Tony’s face had been hilarious on the day he found that the side of the closet Steve had never filled because he refused to buy more clothes than necessary, was now full of things that Tony could wear on their play dates.
“Hey! Don’t do that.”
“What are you doing?” Steve managed to enunciate.
“No! I-I w-want the bri-icks,” Clint refused, just as he had been doing over the last fifteen minutes.
Not wanting to believe it, Steve sighed deeply, because, despite what he wanted, what JARVIS had said made sense.
I couldn't sleep yesterday, and I felt like writing, so, here's the result. Kind of a short chapter, though.
“Are you sure?” Steve insisted, getting just a nod as an answer. His eyebrows drew together in disbelief. “Do you want me to stay?”
“Let’s go,” Steve said.
“I told you I’m busy, and you already made me lose a lot of time,” Tony said before leaving.
Once they were in the kitchen, Steve hurried to the refrigerator and took out as many ice cubes as he thought necessary and wrapped them with several napkins. He returned to were Tony was standing and sat down on the nearest chair, drawing Tony and pulling him down so he ended up sitting on his lap. Tony was so tired, sick, hungry and in pain that he didn’t even think about getting away. So he just sat down there, still holding his hurt hand with the other one, feeling a little ashamed about it. He had had far worse injuries during battle, so this should be nothing to him. But not having adrenaline running through his veins due to the rush of the battle just made the pain unbearable.
Without further notice, Steve slid his hands under his armpits and scooped him up. Tony tensed, and let go of the teddy bear he hadn't realized he was still holding so he could cling to Steve. No matter how many times Steve did that, Tony’s brain refused to understand he was not going to fall.
Yes, if Tony hadn’t seen that morning scene, he would undoubtedly come to think his jealousy was the kind one experienced when it was suspected one’s boyfriend might be romantically involved with someone else. But that wasn't Tony's case.
“Well, then, looks like someone needs an early night,” Steve corrected as he waved his hand in order to get JARVIS to vanish the hologram of the watch Tony had been supposedly working on. “Let’s go upstairs, I think you’ve worked enough for the day, or for the week, I haven’t seen you for more than five nights,” Steve commented nonchalantly even if Tony could tell there was certain scolding hidden in his words.
What the actual hell? How could Tony be frightened if he didn’t even know what he had been dreaming about? It was stupid. After all he had been through, being unnerved because of a dream sounded illogical.
"But then tell me why."
The vents were out of question, he would never be able to jump over there before Steve caught his feet to pull him down. There was nothing he could use to blow the damn door down. In his floor he might have some weapons hidden all over the place, but Steve being an expert in body combat, those items were kind of useless for him. Surely his shield would have to be somewhere there, but hey, messing around with a partner’s weapon was not something he did even if he was completely mad.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Steve informed before pressing another kiss to his forehead.
“Yes, sweetheart?”
“I’m out of here,” Tony announced as he swung his legs off the bed, not liking Steve’s answer and failing to realize it had been a joke. Steve leaned over and grabbed Tony by the wrist before he could get out of reach, pulling him firmly, but gently, until he was back on the bed.
When fatigue took over both of them, Phil couldn’t have been happier. He sat down on the rocking chair and watched them sleep for a long time, wondering how two very handful littles could look so angelic when they were sleeping. After cleaning as much as possible all the mess Clint had caused during the day, Phil took a quick shower and got ready for bed. Inopportunely, when he was still figuring out where he could settle to catch some sleep, Tony woke up, and he evidently didn’t like not finding Steve.
“There’s nothing physically wrong with Sir, Captain. However, he seems to be experiencing a lot of distress,” JARVIS said. Steve stepped up the pace at that, his super soldier hearing already detecting the sound of tiny strangled sobs that became stronger the closer he got to the nursery. Tony was crying, and everything was wrong with that. Steve was hit by an overwhelming desire to comfort him, as a boyfriend or as a daddy, it really made no difference to him.
It had been a surprise, actually. Steve was definitely not expecting Tony to use his diapers anytime soon, especially not when he was clearly struggling with things Steve considered sort of trivial and easier to accomplish, like calling him ‘daddy’ or playing with toys. Therefore, waking up and finding Tony with a soaked diaper that night had taken Steve by complete surprise. A pleasant surprise. Tony was trying very hard to make this work, and Steve couldn’t be happier.
Now that Steve had finally succeeded in keeping Tony still and getting rid of his trousers, the only thing left to do was diapering him up. That’s was a problem, Steve had no idea how to do it considering that he had never tried it before – it wasn’t like he had a lot of opportunities to be around children with the war and everything that was going on before – and he wasn’t sure he could do it. Even worse, the diaper had ended up a couple of meters away from the bed when Tony had accidentally – or intentionally, Steve wasn’t sure – kicked it in the middle of the struggle. Sighing exasperatedly, Steve tried to reach it while continuing to keep his partner in place, but it was impossible, the serum had made him unnaturally strong, but it hadn’t given him any kind of elasticity.
There it was, without beating around the bush. If Tony wasn’t really paying attention to him, he was now. Steve had considered cushioning the blow, but he thought nothing good would come out of doing that. Sometimes it was better to catch Tony off guard, otherwise, he would have enough time to come up with something that could get him out of the uncomfortable situation he was in. He was very good at that.
“Come here, let me help you with that,” Steve ordered, beckoning Clint to walk closer. He did, and Steve hurried to try to undo the buckles, but Clint’s constant jumping and squirming was not helping at all, “please stop moving,” he asked even if he knew Clint was doing that as a way to avoid losing control of his bladder.
“This morning, he wanted to block the door and deny you the access to the workshop, I had to promise him you wouldn’t get lost there, Sir.”
“Lunch’s served,” Steve announced, startling Tony out of his stupor.
Regardless how futile he knew it was, Tony kept kicking, hitting, yelling and swearing all the way to Steve’s floor, he wasn’t the kind who gave up that easily. He even attempted to hold onto anything that could prevent the captain from keep walking, but his strength was no match for his. The elevator’s doors wouldn’t close because his feet stood in the way of the sensor, and when Steve realized it, he got so distracted trying to move them out of the way, that he didn’t notice Tony pushed all the buttons, causing the ride to take more time than necessary.
Tony kept his eyes fixed on him for some more seconds before turning around to see the outfits. His face contacted a little, the frown marring the skin between his brows indicating he was actually trying to make decision. Good. He hadn't showed any signs of wanting to back out so far, and Steve was extremely grateful for that.
“All done,” Steve announced, patting Tony’s left thigh a couple of times as he leaned further over to kiss his tummy before helping him to sit up. “I bet you feel more comfortable now, don’t you baby boy?”
“No.” Steve sighed.
. There was no way Tony was going to call it anything else. Because it sure as hell wasn’t a nursery. An adult man couldn’t have a nursery. An adult man shouldn’t have a nursery.
Then, Steve began to do some other things. Things that made Tony feel uneasy, because, as much as he tried to denied it, he liked them. But it was sure as hell he didn’t want to like them. Being in charge of most of the cooking, Steve started to make cartoon-shaped pancakes, peanut butter sandwiches – his with the crusts cut off – milkshakes, cookies, cheeseburgers, nuggets; all kinds of foods a child would certainly love. It could be said that the others may have found it weird, but they were just glad to eat whatever Steve put in front of them, everything he cooked being too delicious to be declined.
That was indeed something not easy to do, and also the reason why they hadn’t had a play date in over a month. So much for having his daddy back.
“What are you eating?” Tony questioned several minutes after they both had sat at the table and started to eat. He felt a bit stupid when Steve raised an eyebrow in confusion. He had already told him what he his menu was.
How was he supposed to handle a situation like this? The way both Tony and Clint had slipped into their headspaces hadn’t been precisely ideal, though Steve had actually imagined himself spending a nice afternoon with them. Who would have thought that after only an hour, he would be about to witness a double meltdown?
Not waiting for an answer, Steve stood up, pulling Tony up with him and leading him outside the room. Tony just let himself being pushed, too focused on the pain of his hand to be able to refute. It really hurt.
night – Tony would never change that habit of his of locking himself in his workshop for days in a row – but he did try to come upstairs at least a couple of days a week.
"What's wrong with it?" Steve sounded truly disappointed. He had spent a lot of time choosing it.
“S’rry,” Tony apologized as he hugged the pillow tighter.
"Thirsty," Tony hurried to lie. If Steve thought he was thirsty, he would go and get him some water and Tony would have more time to come to terms with the fact that he had just wet himself.
"Let's go then," Steve suggested. He turned around after holding Tony's hand and walked towards the elevator.
“Because you were being unreasonably stubborn.”
“Jeans,” Tony said, making a face at the outfit while he pulled down his t-shirt, as if he was trying to cover his pull-up with it. Phil found it ironic how Tony seemed to be more embarrassed now than when he had been in front of him practically naked.
"Glad to see that, and I hope your plans for the afternoon include an eight-hour nap," Steve commented, "please don't make me ask JARVIS to lock you out of the workshop.” He turned his head to look at Tony, the expression on his face warning Tony he wasn’t kidding. Tony nodded a bit shyly, an answer that apparently satisfied Steve.
Saw any mistakes? Please, let me know :D
“I was kidding!” Steve said, trying not to laugh at Tony’s glare.
That was weird indeed. Tony didn't cry often, not even when he was Little. He could get clingy, moody, fussy, even playful, but not teary. Not really. Maybe after a spanking he kind of did, but hey, it was a spanking. Steve asked him one more time what had happened, becoming more worried when his Little sobbed a tiny bit louder this time.
“Why not? What is it?”
“Promise?”
What on earth had been that?
Confusion took over Steve, taken aback by Clint’s reaction, his brain unable to process what was going on. That wasn’t the first time he had hit Clint during a training session, and it was certainly not the hardest kick he had ever delivered either, so Clint’s sobbing made no sense.
“I don’t know what to do,” Tony confessed with a tiny voice, looking away. He couldn’t look at Steve in the eyes, not when he was sure his face was as red as a tomato. He had colored up as soon as Steve had brought up the topic.
“What do you mean?” Phil asked, raising an eyebrow to emphasize his confusion.
Not wanting to extend the process more than it was necessary, Steve hurried to clean Tony up, tossed the soaked diaper into the trash and a put a new one on after sprinkling some powder between his thighs. By the time Steve snapped the onesie shut, Tony had closed his eyes again, and when Steve got away from the bed to put away all the supplies, Tony took advantage and rolled over his tummy, hugging a pillow tightly.
So, I can truly see Clint and Tony acting like that. With that I'm not trying to say they're gonna be brats or they're gonna be very mean to each other, but they might not be like best friends like we've seen in other stories. They might in the future, but I don't know yet. Who knows n_n'
Steve shook his head in disapproval, “no wonder why Pepper gets so angry with you sometimes. But don’t worry, we’re already here, you’d be able to go back to your workshop to continue stalling your duties,” he promised. Although, if everything turned out the way Steve wanted, Tony would stay there, having some quality time with his daddy.
Anyway, let me know what you think.
Eventually, Steve knew that he –or maybe Tony himself– would get it refurnished, he had already been looking through a lot of websites –JARVIS was very helpful for this– where children’s stuff for adults were sold. He had already thought about getting some stuff, but restrained himself from doing it, afraid that Tony would get mad at him for it. Despite that, it was still a shame that Tony had destroyed all of the nursery’s furniture; the furniture might not have been pieces of art, but everything that he had built had been simple and symmetric, yet beautiful.
