The last thing they needed was for Captain America to turn his back on his country and wander around like some homeless nomad.
“Sure, let’s get this show on the road. Any of you got siblings?” he asked idly as his fingers flew across the keys of his phone.
So it was little wonder that it was Jarvis, when Tony was four-years-old and trying not to cry that his circuit board wasn’t functioning correctly, which took his hand and placed a rag in it and told him to help clean the lower windows. He had, obviously, thrown a tantrum at the very idea, but there had been no one except Jarvis to hear it and the older man hadn’t been swayed by crocodile tears and young, healthy lungs. Eventually, Jarvis won and Tony sat dutifully on the floor at the man’s feet, helping to clean the huge windows that took up an entire wall of the manors sitting room.
conversation, the comfort of the workshop with its familiar whirling and the lights of the bots and technology was one of the only things to keep them at bay. Tony wasn’t about to deny her a safe place to sleep, even if it meant he had been doing all his work without his usual deafening decibel of music as company.
Giving a small nod of his head, though he still had no idea why they were suddenly going to be heading for Timbetpal with such urgency, Steve left the engine room and headed once more for the front of the ship. He had to tell Clint that they needed to change course if they wanted to reach the planet with any kind of expedience.
Steve was surprised when Jane made a beeline for Thor himself, the man suddenly stopped his celebrations of successfully winning his game with Clint, in order to stare at Jane with an equally surprised look on his face.
“What can you tell me about this job?” he continued, eager to get the meeting over with and move out to where he could question Tony away from curious ears.
“So this kind of thing is… normal, then?” Steve finally clarified, eyes once more focused on the genius as he moved a plate to the clean side of the sink.
But, Steve pushed all those thoughts from his mind, he was the captain of the ship and his immediate worry was to the crew and ship now, not what had happened in the past.
Steve looked back at the women just in time to catch Jane following Darcey’s line of sight, and he saw her freeze as shock registered on her face. Before he could say anything, Jane shoved the small pumpkin into Darcy’s chest, the woman fumbling it for a moment before clutching it in her hands. Jane then took off towards the ring toss.
“What’s the situation?” Steve asked, falling into Captain mode as he looked out the large window into the Dark.
He could just avoid them in the Tower, that wouldn’t be too hard. Sure, the kitchen on the communal floor had the best coffee maker, and he might miss the team dinners and movie watching that they had done, but it wouldn’t kill him to no longer be a part of that. He was Tony Stark. As long as everyone else was happy, he didn’t need anything else.
“Hey, Steve,” he didn’t look at the Captain as he spoke, eyes still locked on the book. “I know it’s a bit out of our way, but I really need to go to Timbetpal. The sooner, the better.”
“No, Steve, please. You have to know who you are; you’re Captain America. We’re part of a team. Remember Clint, Natasha, Thor and Bruce. You were a soldier in the second World War, but you were frozen for decades. We saved the world from Loki only a few months ago.”
“Come on, Stevie, baby, come on.” Tony muttered, hands sweeping over Steve’s back and up into his hair, gripping tightly for a moment before going down again and finding his bum to squeeze.
Reaching the central control area, Tony allowed his mouth to keep talking, keeping everyone’s attention there as he casually slipped a small chip onto the side of one of the glass screens, giving Jarvis a point to start hacking his way into SHIELD’s system. Tony wasn’t going to be kept in the dark about what the hell Fury was up to, that’s for sure. He was tired of all this ‘need to know’ crap.
Looking over at Doctor Traveller, with his crisp white doctors’ coat and trustworthy old face, Tony relaxed slightly with the feeling that everything was going to be okay. It was a good idea to tell the doctor how he felt, Steve even thought so and Steve would never lead him wrong. He was only trying to help Tony, after all. If Tony told the good doctor how he felt, he might even be able to spend some more time outside with Steve again. That had been so nice, such a wonderful treat. To be able to touch the green grass and smell the soil, rather than staring down at it from his three-story window with the bars to keep him safe inside.
Steve hid his surprise as he handed over the fifteen credits, eyes straying to the stranger who still held the compression core with ease, resting it on his shoulder the way Thor had done earlier.
“I need his shirt off,” Bruce said, pausing to toss a pair of scissors to Steve, who caught them and reached for Tony’s already ruined shirt to cut it away.
Finally, Bruce slowly reached out and resumed tending to the injured man before him. No one spoke as he did so, all eyes carefully watching him for some kind of reaction to Tony’s words.
“Yes, let us partake in our morning meal!” Thor agreed enthusiastically, moving forwards towards the pop tart cupboard.
“That’s it!” He exclaimed excitedly, dropping the shoe and rag as he clambered to his feet and darted out of the room.
“Tis a most pleasing way to pass the time!” he declared for all around them to hear, not that anyone appeared to be paying him much attention.
“Great, you now have a babysitter. We’re goin’ to continue our date now, try not to let anyone lynch you before dawn,” Tony said, pulling Steve away from Darcy’s amused face and Clint’s annoyed squawking.
That seemed to break whatever tension was hanging between them, and the two were suddenly able to relax and enjoy one another's company as conversation flowed freely.
“Just remember to smile for the camera,” Tony shot the others a grin over his shoulder, the public plastic one that he always wore before the cameras – the one that left his cheeks aching afterwards and felt unnatural on his face.
“If you have a minute, Mister Stark, I need you to sign these,” she held out the bundle of papers she was holding, evidently choosing to ignore the weirdness. Always a wise move in situations such as these.
Taking a as deep a breath as he could with bruised ribs, he pulled his mind away from unpleasant thoughts. Tony pushed himself up with his left hand, the other trapped in a medical blue sling.
“What in the ‘verse are you doing here?” she stomped over to Tony, looking for all the world like a mother scolding a disobedient toddler.
“Sure. Hey, want to see something really cool?” he leaned back slightly so that he could see her clearly, a grin spreading over his face.
Steve gritted his teeth as one of the laser shots passed by close enough to his arm for him to feel the stinging warmth of it. Glancing where they were headed for a split moment, he was relieved to see that they were fast approaching The Avenger.
Steve couldn’t help but agree, Tony clearly knew a great deal about the organisation. At least, he spoke of it as fact rather than the usual speculative rumour.
Tony grinned and stood himself, stretching slightly before following Steve to the counter, offering a token protest once more about paying for their coffee and food, only to be shushed before they headed outside once more in the direction of the Tower.
“No. There was a man, and he told me you’d gone away and wouldn’t see me anymore,” her voice was slightly muffled by the material of his shirt, one hand flexing and then relaxing in the cloth covering his chest. Tony tightened his arms around her.
“What’re you doing wandering around at night? You’re not even wearing any armour, are you?” Steve scolded him, slinging the bow over his back and holding out a hand to pull Tony to his feet.
,” Tony breathed and Steve glanced at him for a moment, but the brunets’ eyes were trained in horrified wonder on what was happening before them.
“I’ll see if I can locate it for her,” he agreed, with the ease of someone who was going to do no such thing.
After the deed had been done and the men had been distracted with collecting their spoils of war, Bucky had snuck back into the prison area of the ship and freed Steve, having never intended on leaving him there. They’d been fleeing the ship when the alarm had sounded and the shooting began almost immediately afterwards.
“Oh, my god, Tony!” she quickly turned back to Bruce. “I’m not a creepy stalker or anything, I promise.”
“This? Oh, just something I made that I thought you might like,” he teased, holding out only long enough to see her turn puppy-dog eyes on him.
“You’re familiar with their weapons?” Steve asked. Tony had only ever used a black-market laser gun in the time Steve had known him.
“Iron Man and Thor, you both take the grasshoppers. Hawkeye, see if you can get at the praying mantis without getting too close. Black Widow, you and me are on the two ants. Hulk, that big honey bee over there is yours,” Steve said, and the Avengers obligingly broke off to tackle their own, individual assignment.
“What are we up against, Sir?” Natasha asked; shooting Tony a look that promised pain if he didn’t shut up.
Focusing on the bundled object now sitting on his lap so he didn’t have to look at their faces, his emotions bubbled dangerously close to the surface in what he was horrified to realise were tears of happiness. He took a rattling breath and pulled apart the cloth.
Sparky’s metal body had been reengineered into a lightweight but hard wearing metal, the various joints piecing together to look seamless. Tony had made a new tail from scratch and hidden away all the electronics within the canine body. His camera eyes were hidden behind two small bullet proof glass lenses, painted carefully to resemble a real dog’s eyes. He was now about the size of a Pomeranian, though Tony had decided to keep the slightly too large jaw as a touch of character and a homage to the robotic dog’s origins.
“Yeah, because all the years I’ve gotten to listen to you go on about the guys and girls you sleep with were a picnic for me,” Darcy said dryly.
“Hey, just wait until you get older, you’ll be creaking and groaning like a little old lady before you know it,” he grinned at her outraged look.
“Steve,” Tony gasped loudly as the soldier pulled his finger mostly out before roughly shoving it back in, causing Tony to scoot up the couch.
Tony had been held, far longer than the average person if he’d formed an attachment with someone, but even just an hour with those monsters was enough to break the strongest of men.
“Oh, Cap. Let’s not lose all the mystery tonight,” Tony lent in close, his ale scented breath reaching Steve’s nose. “That’s what keeps this relationship alive.”
He hoped, for all their sakes - Steve’s most of all - that the man would take his advice and actually start trying to interact with the future beyond the occasional TV session where he sat tense in a chair, frowning more at the clear graphics and colour saturation of the screen than actually watching the movie.
“Oh, Darcy,” he felt his throat tighten as the mechanical whirling within the container started up, curious cameras pointing towards him and happy beeping sounded as wheels began to move against the steel floor. He moved back, away from the crate with a laugh, arms open wide in welcome as his three dutiful bots disembarked and bee-lined for him in excitement.
Nodding, just grateful for someone to be telling him what to do when he didn’t have a clue how to handle this, Tony moved to the couch and sat. Darcy curled up in his lap until her knees were pressed against his left side and her arms tucked between them, hands gripping his shirt as she had always done when upset.
Gently, as if she was a delicate piece of glass or a fragile piece of circuitry, Tony ran a finger down a chubby cheek, the softness warm beneath his finger tip.
Steve wondered for a brief moment if Tony would tell them the same thing that Rumiko had told him. Would he tell everyone about his aversion to his past, his sense of betrayal that led him to drug the woman he was with, steal her money and then burn her house down?
When they’d gotten back to the ship Clint hadn’t even needed to be told that they needed to get off planet as fast as possible without arousing suspicion. The pilot soon had them away from Planeta Stark and Steve had remained with Tony in the Infirmary as much as possible.
“You have been hand chosen by me to act as my PA. This privilege is desired by thousands of people, fought for in underground matches that are surely as illegal as they are flattering. You should feel very blessed to have me as your boss. Euphoric, even. Certainly, thankful enough to allow me to call you by what is honestly the best nickname in the history of appointed nicknames.”
Tony gasped in a breath and blinked hard, but the room around him had definitely changed. Gone was the half-destroyed office, the crazy outfits and ammunition pressed along his back.
It had been a week since their conversation over the comms, and Darcy was having trouble sleeping. Plagued with nightmares of
That wasn’t even including the huge glass dome that encased the entire city skyline. There was something both disconcerting and magical about looking up and seeing huge fish-like creatures swimming in the sky. Steve had even seen a creature with numerous tentacles sticking itself to the glass on his previous visit.
It wasn’t like there was a time when he had sat down and thought about what he would say to his baby sister if this was the last time they spoke? It wasn’t like he’d brooded over words, swapped and exchanged various similes and metaphors in an effort to find the perfect thing to say. It wasn’t like he’d had months of not much else to dwell on but what he would say to his sister if there was never anything else he could say-
Tony knew she was eyeing the various metal bits and pieces around the room, her curiosity peaked. It had been a rare thing for her to be in the workshop in the manor, their father having forbidden both his children from ever entering it. Tony had simply pushed all of his father’s work to one side and set up his own computer and workstation equipment to work from.
Steve was Captain of The Avenger, an ex-soldier for the Universal Security Council, and had been travelling around the ‘verse for the better part of his life. He’d face down all manner of dangers, with barely a flinch.
“You think that’s awesome? Take a look at this.” Tony then turned completely, showing Steve what he had been working on.
Looking around, Steve was surprised to find that before them was what looked like the towns cemetery, the sparsely growing treets providing something of a barrier between the headstones and the wheat field. They hid amongst the corn for the time it took for Tony to dig into the ground with a sharp looking rock, until he deemed the hole deep enough. He then moved about, locating a few large rocks which he placed beside the hole.
Clint and Thor walked past his chair, the two continuing their conversation about some kind of Core planet delicacy that Steve had no interest in ever seeing, let alone putting in his mouth.
Steve wondered if he should be concerned about the obvious correspondence Tony was engaging in, but quickly decided that now wasn’t the time for such thoughts.
The archer flopped down onto one of the kitchen chairs across from Pepper and beside Jane. He squinted at Tony, before letting out a loud sigh as he took a bite.
It wasn’t until a few minutes later that Tony veered off from the main street and headed for a sparsely treed area, that it became more difficult to track him. The trio had taken to hiding amongst a wheat field that was close enough to see Tony, but not to hear him.
Reaching into one of the pockets of his space suit, Steve pulled out a small, rectangular piece of metal that had set him back a few hundred credits on the black market. Attaching it to the lock, he pushed the small button on the side of it and took a hurried few steps back. Nothing seemed to happen for a moment, before a buzzing of electricity and a cracking sound filled the silence around them. Finally, the satisfying sound of a clicking lock was heard.
Tony blinked up at him, a look of vague confusion crossing his face before he seemed to remember what had happened and jolted slightly, breath hissing through is teeth when he slumped back onto the chair with pain.
Taking a small step back to put a bit of space between them, Steve watched as Tony seemed to pull himself together and a smile once more slid onto his face.
“Yeah, sure, you let me know how that goes,” Tony offered a short, two-fingered salute before shooting up into the sky.
“Yeah, but you can’t see what’s happening up-to-date on that thing. The Internet lets you see the news as it’s happening, anywhere in the world,” Tony said, carelessly as he selected a red frosted cupcake and replaced the dome. He turned around just in time to see Steve’s whole body tense defensively, the paper now bunched between his fingers on the table top, his blond head bowed to hide his expression.
“He wears a pendent around his neck, it’s amplifying his powers. If you can get that off of him, you should be able to capture and detain him.”
“Night, Steve,” he said, stepping into his room. "It's been real shiny." He finished with a cheeky grin, waiting only long enough for Steve to grin back at him, before he slid his door shut.
“That’s pretty cool,” Tony agreed, privately thinking how disgusting gingerbread was and how lucky it was that he missed out from having to taste test and pretend to like it.
“Still godlike and muscly I see,” Darcy grinned at him, offering him a gentle nudge of the elbow when she was safely back on solid ground. “And I’m actually here because of Tony, but seeing you again is a bonus.”
“Yeah, maybe - and this is just a suggestion - we should focus on fixing the wiring here rather than what the paint colour should be when we fabricate it?” Tony suggested, pushing away Dummy’s claw that was clutching a collection of sample colours - and honestly, where had he even gotten them? Tony was willing to put money on Darcy being the culprit; she tended to be when it came to abnormal bot behaviour and random acquisitions of useless items. She was such a terrible influence.
Tony was pretty sure that he wasn’t imagining the slight blush that had spread over Steve’s cheeks as he spoke, his eyes darting around the workshop.
“Does Tony actually know what he’s doing right now?” Bruce asked when it looked like neither Pepper or Tony was going to make a remark about the oddity happening right before them all.
His eyes took in the room again, and the cold feeling in his stomach morphed into a sinking feeling in his gut. Though many years had passed since he had last been here, and much of the furniture was different, there were still pieces of his childhood that remained. The lamp for one, the beautiful painting of an artists’ impression of what Earth-that-was had looked like hung upon a far wall, and the floor tiles themselves upon closer inspection were the same terracotta, hand painted patterned ones he recalled reading numerous engineering textbooks upon when he was a boy.
“It looks nice,” Tony said honestly, eyes tracking over the simple but clean wooden table tops with square chairs, each table holding a small vase that held three fresh flowers in various colours, no doubt picked that very morning. There was a small selection of baked goods in the cabinet at the back of the store beside an old fashion cash-register.
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed you’ve given me the side with less monsters to kill.” Normally, Tony would put up a huge fuss about that, but the cracks in his sword worried him more than he was willing to admit.
“Positive. I can’t let us keep doing weapons production if this is what’s happening with them,” he paused; mind flashing back to the sight of the company’s,
Stepping into the room, he cleared his throat loudly, delighted by the way she lit up upon laying eyes on him.
Yurma was, unfortunately, one of the more difficult planets in the Rim to smuggle goods off of, but not impossible. Frankly, Steve had been thankful for the job they’d received via wave the day after Tony’s reveal. There had been a tension on the ship after the mechanic had told them some of his history, about Dr Yinsen and the Ten Rings.
“Tony,” Darcy said, her voice worried and soft. “They told me that this Doctor Traveller guy got into your head, that he made you see things that aren’t real,” she glanced at the Avengers.
Clint and Natasha murmured together as Steve looked through the front glass once more, relief sweeping through him.
Tony blinked in confusion, eyes staring up at the star filled sky. All he could hear was the pounding of blood in his ears and a general sense of dizziness. He blinked slowly, Steve suddenly appearing in front of his eyes, mouth moving and panic on his face. Tony slowly became aware of Steve’s hands on his body, no doubt checking for injuries.
“I can’t be bothered to deal with this right now,” Rhodey turned and moved off into the heat of the Afghani desert.
“That’s in the opposite direction of where we’re headin’, Tony,” Steve crossed his arms over his chest, frustration hiding his confusion.
“Stark,” Rogers’s voice was tight, his warning about not liking the situation still in the air between them all.
“Agreed, somethin’ went down here. But, that don’t mean we can’t reap some kind of benefit from stumblin’ across the ship now,” Steve said, gesturing for Thor to leave the room and begin the trek back to the rest of the crew.
“Take Pepper and go to my office at SI,” he carefully explained what he needed her to do as he passed her the drive.
“So good for me, baby.” Steve said quietly, enjoying the way the flush deepened on Tony’s skin at his words. Pulling his finger away, Steve grabbed Tony’s right leg and pulled it as far up to Tony’s chest as it would go, taking Tony’s right hand that had been gripping the couch when Steve had moved away, he securely made Tony hold his own leg high before swooping in for a quick, hard kiss to Tony’s lips.
Steve took a moment to deliberate with himself. It was clear that there was more to the story than the woman was telling him, but he was also aware that two against his crew of six was definitely good odds in his favour should they try anything.
It was hardly his fault, really. He’s been so emotionally out of whack since The Talk - capitals most definitely needed - that all he could do was lose himself in his wok and let his emotions re-establish an equilibrium subconsciously in the back of his mind. Then, when he had eventually fallen asleep, his dreams were plagued with nightmares, reliving the feeling of the water filling up his suit as Steve told him he was worthless and that he had imagined becoming Iron Man and the whole Avengers team. Needless to say, Tony hadn’t been able to sleep much after that.
“Well, let’s go up to watch this movie then. I’m pretty sure that Darcy was about to make some popcorn when I left, she might even have some of that caramel popcorn that you like so much,” the sly tone of Steve’s voice only caused the blush on Tony’s cheeks to intensify, and he all but hightailed it to the elevators in an effort to give himself a few precious seconds to try and get himself under control.
He only had the briefest warning of the hud screen before him flashing red in the corner of his eye, before he was suddenly bowled off his feet and through a wall.
Tony shrugged awkwardly, seeming to slip back into whatever trance-like state he had been in before Steve had appeared.
“What the hell was I thinking?” he muttered, staring down at the robot and kicking himself for ever thinking he should be proud of it.
that’s got your docket and come drinkin’ with us?” Clint asked. “We’d get free drinks all night with you,” he wiggled his eyebrows, which only earned him a punch to the arm from the deceptively delicate looking woman.
The idea of fucking Tony when he still had his finger within himself, the depravity of it licked at a fire within Steve’s gut that he hadn’t even been aware existed. Looking up at the flushed cheeks and heavily leaking cock, though, Steve decided to save that particular fantasy for another day.
“Jarvis, cut the communication with the team unless it’s actually important,” Tony said quietly, and Captain America’s angry words were cut off abruptly.
It was only Steve, standing by the elevator doors when they opened, that prevented such a thing from happening. Steve may or may not have been the only acceptable reason to be awake that early after only two hours of sleep.
Steve couldn’t help the amusement that stirred within him, despite the rational part of his mind that shook its head at the man’s stupidly ballsy words.
“Surprise,” Tony muttered, blinking slow but hard, not wanting Obie to know just how compromised he felt at the moment.
“Are these your friends?” he continued, for all the world as if Dummy was talking away to him like a little kid showing off his friends to his parents.
” Clint yelled as he manoeuvred the bike towards the ship, Steve clinging onto his back as laser shots fired around them.
“Have a quick look around, I know Clint said we don’t got no one on our tail, but I ain’t like the idea of hangin’ around for too long,” Steve got a thumb’s up from the other man before starting to investigate his own area of the cargo hold.
Moving around the space without taking his eyes off the other man, Steve sat down on a chair at a semi-clear worktop and began to sketch.
“I’m almost finished up with the new plans for the Tower, how about you get dressed and we go get some breakfast?” Tony offered, smiling encouragingly.
“Who’da thought we’d get some emotional drama on our stop off that you’s two weren’t the cause of, eh, Captain?” Clint asked, looking like he’d had far too much cider and was enjoying himself immensely.
“Something about a criminal psychologist being accused of murder,” Steve was frowning now, eyes skimming over the article on the front page.
While Tony could almost count the number of hours he had spent with his parents collectively, it had been Jarvis who had raised him. Jarvis was the one to tend to skinned knees and broken hearts. It was the family butler Tony ran to when he aced his tests and won award after award. Even when Tony was sent away to boarding school, it was Jarvis who he rang to vent to about how the older kids didn’t like him because he was too smart, too young, too strange.
After the sexual desire had faded, they had firmly established a close friendship and business partnership. Tony, honestly, wouldn’t have it any other way.
It felt like he’d just offered a lot more than a space for Steve to practice his shading sketches. But Tony wasn’t sure what, exactly, he’d offered.
Sitting in a chair next to the cot was a young, blonde haired woman in a white blouse and grey pencil skirt, a book in her hand that she hurriedly lowered as she stood upon their entrance into the room.
Steve mentally sighed, recognising Natasha asking for herself rather than for any underlying motive.
“We don’t have a full-time mechanic,” Steve bit out, slightly irritated by how Tony had simply and easily cut down any and all alterations to the engine that Steve had contributed to.
This was the man Tony could remember playing super hero’s as with Darcy when they were kids? The expressions ‘never meet your hero’ had never been truer. Tony opted for lying to himself that he didn’t care what the man said, Jarvis would sniff out all of Fury’s little secrets and then he’d show the teacher’s pet.
Without another glance the man swept from the room, mutters of what a disappointment Tony was following him as he headed towards his office and, no doubt, the whiskey decanter.
“Rhodey, to what do I owe the pleasure?” Tony grinned, glad to see the young man who had been sharing various engineering classes with him at MIT for the past year.
He tried not to think too much about it, and a guilty part in the back of his mind relished the warmth that Steve gave off, his super serum enhanced metabolism causing him to run a few degrees warmer than the average person.
“I’m okay, Thor’s with me and fine too. Nothing more than bruises,” Bruce’s calm voice came over the system and Steve felt something in his stomach unclench.
Steve looked over to Tony at the sound of a low groan where he’d been lounging in the built-in seats lining one wall of the infirmary.
Working with Bruce was, simply put, fun. Tony rarely had the opportunity to work with people who were on par with his own intelligence. It wasn’t him being obnoxious or conceited; Tony was simply a genius with the intellect to match the title. While he knew, he was probably ahead of the other man in terms of electro-physics and engineering, on gamma radiation the doctor held the largest quantity of knowledge and Tony was content to keep up with him via the papers he’d read and information he’d sourced.
Turning quickly, he rushed after the surprisingly light-footed mechanic and managed to catch up to him on the catwalk in the cargo hold.
The job, it turned out, was relatively straightforward. Steve couldn’t deny that life was made much easier when most of the leg work was already done for them. Rumiko and her sources had investigated the most likely places that Doctor Cho might be held captive, and after Steve had brought Natasha down into the city dome and let her loose to do her own snooping for a few hours in the afternoon, she had corroborated with the information they’d been provided.
The return to consciousness was swift, and Tony was immediately aware of the soft sheets under his cheek and the quiet tap of fingers against a screen.
“Yes, it was a shame. You should have just died when you were supposed to, Tony, then I wouldn’t have to be missing a very important meeting with a member of the USC board regarding their firearm regulations,” Obie said.
Unable to decipher the looks on their faces, Tony allowed his mouth to do what it did best and babble away, his mind not even registering the words anymore. Something about not making them all move out just because they finally knew what a royal fuck-up he was and didn’t want to deal with that shit any more.
“Yes, is it working?” Steve asked, not even bothering to lie and seeming to be genuinely interested in how successful his guilt tripping abilities were.
“Are you telling me, that genius over here,” Clint jerked his thumb in Tony’s direction. “Stress cleans?” The incredulity was clear in his voice.
Steve wondered if Tony knew a pretty woman on every rock in the ‘verse. His stomach tightened with jealousy.
Gripping his sword tight, Tony set off at a fast pace, eyes alert for any sign of movement and ears staining to pick up any of the familiar sounds of monsters. He managed to weave around trees and not trip over the uneven land for a few minutes; till he was halfway home and his good luck ran out.
A grin pulled at his lips and, looking up at Jarvis, Tony tightened his hold on the railing in order to contain the flow of excitement that suddenly swept through him. Jarvis smiled down at him, hand moving to rest briefly on top of his head, approval in his eyes.
“Watch it, coming up here,” Rhodey warned as two paramedics and a stretcher approached the lowered deck of the plane.
“Okay, this was fun – full points for style – but, I think our little knock-down brawl is attacking more attention than either of us want. How’s about you go back inside and I go peacefully on my way?” He offered.
Tony spun lazily from side to side on his chair, eyes tracking the holoscreens again as his mind moved to more interesting projects, namely his AI.
He didn’t stop until they had reached his own bedroom and he was able to put a shut door between them and the world, the only real measure of safety in such a home. He paused for a moment, listening and holding his breath, but there was silence from the hallway. Their father had decided against teaching them a lesson this time. No doubt, Howard would spend the rest of the night holed up with the remainder of the brandy bottle as he ranted and raved to an empty room about the irresponsible and disrespectful of youth of today.
Fury’s fun-killing vibes filled the room and Tony watched as the Director had his little moment. The way Rogers lit up slightly at getting the Wizard of Oz reference was both ridiculous and cute, the former winning out in the war of emotions displayed across Tony’s face. Not wanting to listen to Fury get really worked up, Tony pulled Bruce from the room and off to the lab where they could work in relative peace.
The Avengers might be earth’s mightiest heroes, but it still took almost a full month for them to learn about Tony’s quirk after they had moved into the tower. This was despite the fact that various members had wandered into recently abandoned, half completed dishes, table wipes and even a memorable occasion where Thor ended up slipping over onto his back due to a half finished floor mopping.
“Tony, why don’t we start with you telling Doctor Traveller how you feel so we can all calm down a bit?” Steve’s voice was once again soft and encouraging.
“He brought you back to the ship because you were one mug from tripping over your own feet. Hardly date-worthy material at the time. I’m sure if you asked him, properly and soberly, if he wanted to take a short trip to the Gods statue in Aquamarine, he’d be perfectly willing to oblige.”
Steve followed Darcey’s eyes where she was staring into the crowd near the game stalls, her eyes wide and mouth gaping open.
“Hold on, Director Fury,” Steve suddenly spoke up, voice dropping those few octaves into ‘Captain America’s' register.
There was a tense moment, where neither of them moved, just stared at one another, before the large man let out an angry sounding grunt.
“Good. Now, listen up, because you’re a smart guy - not genius level like me, but you’ve got a good head on your shoulders. People love Captain America. What happened to you with the whole freezing time jump thing is awful. We can’t say we understand, but we at least acknowledge that it’s screwed up and unfair on you, which is more than a lot of people get in life. So, you need to stop letting it control yours. You’re so determined to dislike the future and compare it to your idealistic memories of the past that you haven’t even tried to involve yourself in the world as it is now. Not everything in the here and now is out to get you, or to make you remember that it’s no longer in the 1940s. The world is at your fingertips; the globe is your oyster. There is so much to do, so much to see - wait, no, that’s Disney,” Tony snorted, amused with himself despite the important message he was trying to convey.
While they weren’t exactly lacking in time, he was still acutely aware of the arguments he’d had with Tony about the man not wanting to come to the planet in the first place. Not that he seemed to care much now, not yet having returned to the ship despite the various signs around the port flickering to life.
Tony made his way out of his room and towards the elevator, mind already turning around the various prototypes he had left open in his workshop. He attempted to ignore Pepper’s curious questions about what he’d been up to recently as she dogged his steps.
Steve followed at a more sedate pace, shielding his eyes when he finally reached the ramp and the brilliant light from the two suns that Ariel orbited hit him.
Later, after Tony had proudly shown Jarvis his finished prototype and been assured that, yes, his father would be very proud when he got home next month, Tony had remembered to thank Jarvis for his help.
“Oh please, don’t try and pretend you weren’t thinking about it. You’ve been practically drooling after Tony for the last few weeks, especially when he’s cleaning and doing all that bending and stretching,” she smirked and Steve felt his cheeks redden at her words.
For the briefest moment, he was sure he was staring at USC soldiers, holding the fucking murder weapon up for everyone to see.
“He’s good, Steve,” Clint said quietly as he brought the ship in towards the sapphire planet’s atmosphere.
Phil just offered him a bland smile before pointing off to the side where he was going while Tony continued straight onto the raised platform with a large circular table that the others had congregated around.
“Fujikawa and Viastone are direct competitors. If we tried to accuse them of something like this, even if we could prove it, the public image of the company would be ruined,” Rumiko said, her mouth tight with what Steve suspected was annoyance.
The others were wrapped up in the game, but Steve briefly caught Natasha’s eye as he slinked past, not wanting to deal with the teasing of the rest of the crew until he’d had some sleep and time to process everything.
Steve spared a glance at the door to Thor’s quarter’s as he pushed open his own, but he wasn’t too worried. If Jane had wanted to kill him, or do anything more than slap him in what looked like barely restrained control, he was sure the large man could either deal with it himself, or seek the appropriate help. The woman deserved a bit of anger, as Thor had been with Steve for four years now, he wondered how long it’d been since he’d left her.
They stared at one another for a moment before Tony groaned and banged his head upon the table top in defeat, being sure to miss the plate, lest he get pancake all over his face.
“Darcy bakes,” Tony said idly, watching as Bruce headed for the kettle while Clint wandered pseudo-casually over to the cakes.
“I’ve been working on important things, Pep,” Tony pushed himself out of bed, absentmindedly noting his pillow on the floor.
intend to do?” Steve played along, keeping his tone even as he tried to work out what she was talking about.
One of the things that Tony loved about sleeping in his room, when he did make it to bed that is, was that Jarvis had complete control of the windows and prevented any light from entering before he was awake. Before Afghanistan and his new, ever present night light, he hadn’t been able to sleep if it wasn’t almost pitch black in his room. After, it was more the memory of peaceful sleep in the darkness that made him want his curtains pulled, the blue glow of the arc reactor had become something of a security blanket for him. If the room was pitch black now, well, it meant Tony was flirting dangerously close to death.
“Take the next few hours to decide. We’re not leaving Ariel till nightfall. Come back then if you wanna be part of this ship, but if not, no hard feelin’s. I’m sure you’ll keep our extracurricular activities to yourself?” He tapered off in a question.
Steve’s eyes snapped to Bruce, saddened at the reveal of the man’s feelings. A cold feeling doused his prior amusement as he mentally reprimanded himself for not noticing that Bruce was feeling out of place on the ship.
“Security breach,” Tony exclaimed, before shooting Pepper a look. “This is worse than all those sweaty workmen you had using my private elevator.”
Natasha had a particular way of coming at a man when she was planning on digging for information. She was apt at playing various roles, her business as a companion being but another within her repertoire of masks. It was only the years of experience with deflecting the – sometimes – well intentioned prying that Steve had grown able to dissect the subtle tilt of her head and the widening of her eyes to appear innocent and trustworthy.
“Right, Pepper, this is my sister, Darcy. Darcy, this is Pepper, she’s my new assistant; I hired her last month after she pepper sprayed my body guards. It was truly a sight to see, I think I fell a little bit in love,” Tony batted his eyes at the red-head who had stopped near him. The woman raised an unimpressed eyebrow, her expression a mixture of ‘you are such an idiot’ and ‘how the hell did you convince them you were a sane and responsible choice for CEO of a multimillion dollar company?’
I'm not finished with these guys either - if you can believe it - I still have a short one shot planned and I'd like to write a drawn-out date for the boys that may or may not end in a steamy time for all.
As Tony managed to kill off the last of the spiders that had been on his side of the battlefield, he felt the give in his sword and it made a loud cracking sound as it snapped, the iron blade breaking off within the spiders’ body.
Tony was still leaning over the luggage where he’d tripped before, body oddly tense and Steve’s already whirling mind immediately jumped to all manner of conclusions before he forced himself to calm down and think rationally.
“Wait,” Clint suddenly said, a thoughtful look on his face from where he was leaning against the large dining table they used for dinner. “Don’t the Japanese have a robotic dog?”
“SG merchandise goes for a high credit, but it’s difficult to move if it’s already been registered. Feels like a lot more trouble than it’s worth…” he ran his fingers over a gun thoughtfully.
Clint snorted, opening his mouth to no doubt protest Steve’s negativity, when the sound of breaking ceramic from the nearby bar caught their attention. The trio jumped back a step as a man was suddenly thrown through the window of the bar, the holographic glass flickering madly before realigning itself once more.
“I could turn you in for the reward money,” Steve said. Nothing in his character would ever allow Steve to do such a thing, but the words were worth it if they inspired just a little bit of sense in Tony.
Then, in a freak mission where the resistance had been able to force back the governments’ troops, an order had come via wave into the bridge.
He had managed to lose himself in the dregs of his coffee, wondering if he could be bothered to get up and get another cup, when a gentle hand fell on the back of his chair and Steve’s familiar cologne filled his senses. Looking up, Steve was half leaning down towards him, an amused smile on his face as if he had been able to hear Tony’s coffee contemplations.
Thankfully, as though reading his mind, she merely smirked at him, before turning to Clint and bluntly telling him not to try and cheat, to take his shot like a real pilot and be a baby about it.
“This is Natasha Romanov, a Companion; and this is our occasional medic, Doctor Bruce Banner. You remember Clint and Thor?”
“I’m not saying that the armour isn’t great, because it’s pretty awesome and I’m a little jealous,” she bumped their shoulders together again, and Tony could feel that familiar warmth he always experienced when she was proud of his creations in his chest.
“No, nothin’ that excitin’. Just lost interest in this planet, is all, time for a change,” she said.
Bruce had been operating this way with Steve’s crew for years now and Steve, perhaps foolishly, had believed that Bruce considered him to be at home when on the ship with the rest of them.
It wasn’t exactly uncommon for them for see Pepper Potts in the tower, she was Stark Industries CEO after all and was often after Tony about one project or another, or a meeting, or a gala, or whatever it was this week. But she was quietly sitting at the breakfast table with a cup of coffee and a tablet, seemingly content for the moment as her fingers flew across the screen, micromanaging one of the largest companies in the world like a pro.
“Seriously? But, there’s so much stuff here,” Tony gestured with one hand, the other still holding the handle of the cart.
He was loath to admit it, but press conferences had been instrumental in teaching him how to think on his feet.
Tony was surprised. He hadn’t thought that people would really want to spend time in his workshop. He knew Darcy was down there all the time, but he’d figured that was more because she’d grown up spending time with Tony in various workshops and she loved being with the bots. Pepper occasionally stopped by the workshop as well, but that was always due to necessity, she never stayed longer than she needed to, and she was always either telling him off for not sleeping or for not working on what he was meant to be working on. Rhodey, similarly, was hardly ever in the workshop, only coming down when it came to shoptalk or if he couldn’t find Tony anywhere else in the house.
“No,” she snapped, voice suddenly loud, and Tony could tell there was a frown on her face without even looking.
He’d managed to escape from Pepper and find sanctuary in his workshop for the past two days before Darcy had tracked him down and demanded he come up to the kitchen where she’d made caramel and chocolate popcorn. When asked why, she’d rolled her eyes and said: ‘because I want to watch Disney movies and you’re going to watch them with me’.
It might be true that Tony had maybe confessed some things to the slightly older man when he was particularly drunk and missing Darcy and Jarvis and the home that those two people inspired in him. He may have confessed to the loneliness he still acutely recalled from his younger days, before he had a little ball of energy and green eyes looking up at him with love and adoration. How he still felt completely alone when he was at the parties his father insisted upon him attending, despite the fact he wasn’t even old enough to get into many of the places they were held at.
Before anyone could say anything else, they were interrupted by the doors to the elevator sliding open and the familiar click of high heels upon the wooden floorboards.
“I’m glad you like your surprise,” Steve replied once they’d pulled apart, voice just as soft and a gentle smile gracing his lips.
Tony looked at her in surprise. Darcy rarely mentioned their mother, in fact, Tony was fairly certain that he’d never heard her speak of the woman at all. She may have asked others, but never when Tony was around.
“Tony, I need you to listen to me very carefully, okay? You have never been a superhero, never any kind of hero at all. You were drunk and stupid and hit a tree, which knocked the sense out of you. Your sister won’t even talk to you anymore because of your delusions and, frankly, you’re close to becoming a helpless case for me as well. There’s only so much I can do to try and help you if you’re not willing to help yourself. Maybe, if you hadn’t of been such a failure, this would never have happened,” Steve sighed, a great heaved upon sound as if Tony was a perpetual problem that he was forced to deal with.
“How did you escape?” Steve asked, trying not to dwell on thoughts of Tony being held by the Ten Rings, of all the horrific stories he’d heard. He refused to think about what Tony might have suffered under the hands of such barbaric people.
The launch party had been one of the usual events, the only difference being that Darcy had been in attendance. Obie and Tony had argued for an entire week about that, until Tony had finally given in when Obie agreed that she would miss the launch itself which was open to the press, and only attend the dinner and after party which was a more private affair of America’s rich and famous.
“I hate monsters. We should just find all the monster spawners and we wouldn’t have this problem.” Tony muttered.
Fourthly, Darcy was undoubtedly going to be sending him ginger-based cakes and cookies for the foreseeable future as some type of punishment for him not saying anything to her.
“You were only seven, I thought you’d forgotten about it,” Tony admitted, fingers running over the mechanical dog's body, finding small nicks and scrapes that his mind immediately started working on ways to fix.
“You’d better get going… here,” Tony rummaged on the desk for a moment before picking up two small, compact machines and throwing them over to her.
“What?” she asked, looking a little swept away. Tony could forgive her for that, he was impressed she’d been able to keep up for as long as she had.
Tony had met Doctor Ashley Kefka a few times before, had even donated money towards the construction of the Ravencroft Asylum a few years ago when she’d approached him about it. An incredibly intelligent psychologist, she was the top of her field and had been appointed the position of running the Asylum by the government itself before the building had even been completed. Tony had primarily enjoyed her company when they met at social events because of her intelligent conversations, and that, despite her profession, she’d never once tried to psychoanalyze him.
“-And that’s it. God, I think I’ve finally done it. The first one I’ve managed to pull off. Now I just need to close this up and turn you on and - I can’t believe I’ve finally done it,” Tony muttered to himself, carefully putting the wired insides back into the metal framework before reaching for the cover plate to give what would hopefully be his new workshop helper a clean finish on its metal framework body.
Stepping into Steve’s space, he reached up and wrapped his arms around the man’s neck, using his weight to pull Steve down those precious few inches so that they were face to face.
“Let’s hope we can find one, or else we won’t be gettin’ of this rock no time soon,” Steve said, the last part more to himself than his two crew members.
The thought curled through the back of his mind and took up residence with other established facts like the grass was green, Darcy baked the best cakes and E = mc
Steve was pretty sure that operating on desperate people to try and save their lives after the hospitals had told them they were as good as dead, was a minor sin in the grand scheme of things.
“I haven’t done anything to your sister, Tony. You need to calm down. Perhaps, a more familiar face will help you,” Traveller trailed off slightly, a thoughtful look on his face.
“Man of Iron, why have you filled the moving box with – Lady Jane?” Thor exclaimed in surprise, hands coming up to rest on her shoulders to prevent her from moving away from him.
A large metal claw was slowly closing around the top of the USC ship, securing it to the Reavers ship that had crashed into it, effectively pinning the vessel where it was with no escape.
Slipping out of the vehicle, Tony made sure that his present was securely concealed, before moving quickly to the front door, unable to hide his grin as it was promptly opened by Jarvis, a small smile of welcome on the butlers' face.
Tony blinked in surprise. Their father’s favourite topic of conversation was always the World War II hero, Tony didn’t know how Darcy had never heard of him.
“Try to keep it in your pants, guys. I already have years of therapy ahead of me from walking in on my brother having sex,” Darcy said loudly, causing Tony to pause for a moment as he pushed down the embarrassment that swamped him while he tried to peer around Clint in order to see how many people were witnessing this.
“Hi, Tony! I miss you - lots and lots. I’ve been helping Jarvis in the kitchen,” she explained and he could just picture her almost vibrating with excitement, the phone no doubt being held by both of her hands up to her ear as if that made it easier to be heard.
get his arms to relax enough to let her go. And if Tony spent the rest of the night holding Darcy in his arms, back in her own bed at the mansion, phone pressed to his ear as he
“Was there something you actually needed down here, or where you just searching for affectionate bots to play with?” Tony finally asked when it became obvious that the three bots were content to bask in Steve’s attention for as long as possible.
“Steve, I have so much money I’m not even sure what the total is anymore. I’m happy to pay for whatever we get here, it’s nothing to me,” he said slowly, spelling it out.
Mind focusing in on a plan, one that had a slim chance of working, but still a chance, Tony got to work.
“He’s really into what’s happening on campus and the world in general, so he makes for a great conversationalist,” Darcy continued, oblivious to Tony’s inner thoughts. “The other guy I met, Jim Wilson, he’s an arts student and really into videoing stuff on his phone.”
Looking briefly at Steve’s rooms, it still looked mostly the same as Tony had left it, with the older and retro furnishings in the room. But, it did look a little lived in, if only for the numerous piles of books that were stacked neatly in the bookshelves and on the coffee table. There was even a throw blanket folded and left on the arm of the couch. Tony wasn’t sure what, exactly, he’d been expecting, but he’d hoped for a little something… more; if the feeling of disappointment in his gut was anything to go by.
In fact, he was tempted to push her out of the elevator when they arrived on the communal floor, and then escape down to the workshop where he could lock her out and get some more sleep.
Steve couldn’t help the way his nose crinkled up as he regarded the man before him. The homophobic moron must be three sheets to the wind to think Steve would even look twice at him, no matter how many drinks he’d had.
Thinking he’d lost him, Steve had to pull up short when he rushed down an empty side street and stepped out into a quiet courtyard between buildings. Quickly moving back into the shadows of the alleyway, he peered around the corner once more and listened carefully, noting with annoyance how often he found himself in this kind of situation with Tony.
“Well, well, well, look at you. Aren’t you a beautiful sight. Hey, boy,” Tony reached out slowly, as if it was a strange dog he was greeting rather than his mechanical extra hand.
“We’ll try not to miss you,” Natasha said dryly from where she was sitting on a crate of goods off to the side of the cargo hold.
“See you soon,” she gave him a cheeky wink before disconnecting the call, her laughter still ringing in his ears.
“I want to go to Culver University, Tony. It’s the only one I’m going to apply for,” Darcy was nothing if not stubborn.
“But, I didn’t,” Tony didn’t know what he was going to say, his voice lost and his throat too tight to get anything except a whistling breath through.
When JARVIS had opened the elevator onto the community level, which housed the kitchen, everyone’s main goal at the moment, they had all come to a stop only a few steps into the room.
Yet, as Tony had spoken of Yinsen, had lost himself momentarily in memory, his words had sharpened and he wouldn’t have been out of place at a fancy party in the Core planets.
“MIT? Oh, hey, that must be Rhodey,” quickly saving his work on his personal database, Tony pushed away from the screen before him and got to his feet, back cracking loudly as he did so.
Turning his attention finally to the people waiting for him, he felt his abused heart give a particularly hard thump. Pepper was red eyed, hands clasped firmly together in front of her body as she stood tall. Darcy brown eyes glittered with tears, her hair in a messy ponytail and casually dressed, the exact opposite of Pepper’s pristine outfit. Happy was standing just behind them, the relief on his face evident.
“I’m just passin’ through. I was with another ship of scientists, but when they left planet I decided it was time for a change. My friend and me stayed behind, but we’re lookin’ to move along again. My friend’s actually lookin’ for someone, and I said I’d stick with her until she found him.”
For a brief moment, he morbidly amused himself with the idea of it being a bomb, before snorting and dismissing the idea. There was no way there’s be any room within Tony’s chest cavity for his organs and the equipment required to produce a descent sized explosion.
Staring at the pink face of his boyfriend, Tony knew he was so screwed. Completely, irrevocably and utterly screwed. The man was the personification of perfection and, luckily for Tony, all his.
Laughing slightly, he took the paper and turned it over so that he could see what she had done. In shaky, childish block letters, she had written both her name and his, followed by their last name. Seeing that she had put the ’S’ backwards only served to charm him further.
“Oh, yeah,” Steve murmured; seeming to remember something as he gently extracted himself from the huddle of bots that had closed ranks around him. “Darcy was saying that you primarily worked with holoscreens down here and, well, I was working on my light shading and your screens would be really great subjects. I was wondering, if it wouldn’t bother you, if I could sketch down here, maybe?”
Tony, for his part, remained where he was standing in his lounge for a moment, eyes unfocussed and a small frown upon his face. He wasn’t sure he liked the look that had been in Pepper’s eyes. Shaking it off, he clapped his hands together and roused himself towards the elevator to await its return.
“Indeed. How are you?” the family butler asked politely. Tony felt his heart swell with joy because even if he sounded as polite as an acquaintance, Tony knew without a shadow of a doubt that Jarvis was actually interested in the answer to that question, that it wasn’t just a social formality for him. He actually
“Uh, I’ll just have my coffee, here, I’ll give you some money,” he reached into his back pocket for his wallet, but Steve grabbed his arm and held it still.
“Think on it,” Jarvis continued in a lighter tone as he once more stood tall. “You now have someone who will need you for love and attention. When she is a little older, you will then be able to look after one another.”
Tony looked beautiful when he laughed. The way his eyes crinkled at the corners, the rich sound of his laughter and the warmth of his body when they both tried to get to the sink at the same time.
“Shut up, get undressed and into bed, Tony,” the familiar note of exasperation entered her voice as he shoved the rest of his toast into his mouth and stripped down to his boxers before climbing onto the mattress.
“I used to get into all kinds of things, but nothing ever too serious. I don’t think Jarvis’ heart was really in it when he tried to scold me, to be honest. On more than one occasion I’m pretty sure he was actually amused by what I’d gotten up to, but couldn’t let on.”
“No, unlike your sudden desire to see me dead,” Tony couldn’t help the honest hurt that leaked into his voice. A part of him, small though it was, would forever be eighteen and crying in a cell, wondering what in the ‘verse he’d done to have Obie betray him like this. The man he’d seen as a second father, who was all he’d felt he had in the world, had disliked him so much that he’d put out a hit on him. It was madness.
Natasha’s not so subtle suggestion that Steve share some of his history – no matter how painful it still was to think about – might be just the thing to open Tony up to him.
Finally, I don't know where the chicken came from guys, it just appeared and now Clint is a proud pet owner. The world moves in mysterious ways, I guess.
“What have I said about the two of you conspiring against me?” Tony whined, receiving a gently nudge from You for his troubles.
Steve had made a point to have Clint land the ship a distance from their meeting location, just in case it went bad – a more common occurrence than he would like to admit.
There was a beat before Tony suddenly stuck his head back into the den, nose scrunched up and a teasing glint in his eyes.
“Besides, who would trade an outlaws’ life such as this for anythin’?” Tony teased him, a hand reaching under the table to squeeze Steve’s knee where it was still resting against his own.
“If you didn’t want him to lecture you, then you should have just gone to the debriefing,” Pepper said, eyes not leaving whatever she was reading on her screen.
Right at the back, slightly hidden by a support pillar, was a large storage container. Blinking, Tony was a little embarrassed to admit that he’d missed the stupid thing when he’d glanced around just moments before.
“Darcy, just try to enjoy yourself, will you? This isn’t quite the crisis situation that you seem to want to make this into,” he suddenly gave her a mock-serious look as a thought occurred to him.
“Darcy,” he reached out and hugged her, pulling her to his chest and encircling her with his arms. He could feel her small fists grab onto his shirt and her face pushed against his neck; hot, fast gasps of breath hitting his throat.
“Tony, did you ever think that maybe I liked him just fine. That the things you see wrong with him, I see as quirks and I appreciate and adore him even now because of them.”
“The Ravencroft Asylum was built for the criminally insane, many of whom have some kind of superhuman power or ability, most of them are completely beyond rehabilitation,” Bruce said quietly, tense as he stared into his cup of tea.
“You’re going to a tiny town in New Mexico. It’s hardly the other side of the globe,” Tony teased her gently.
So, Tony had retreated to his room and sat down at the large mahogany desk that was normally covered with bits and pieces of metal and electrical wires, the clean table top evidence of Jarvis having tided up while Tony had been away. Really, that was code for: ‘Jarvis put everything on the desk into a box and will withhold its location until Tony does what the man wants him to’.
Tony didn’t think he’d ever been so happy to reach the Tower before. He was the first one out of the car, ‘women first’ be dammed.
The first time it had happened, Tony had made himself a bit of a nest on the den floor, surrounded by a pile of shoes and armed with shoe polish, a rag, and a problem with the propulsion system in a stealth boat he was making for SHIELD. Steve was sitting quietly on the couch, sketchpad open and pencil sweeping across the pages as he tried to capture the slightly pinched expression around Tony’s eyes, when Clint entered the room.
“If they wanted to show moral, why don’t they talk about the aid work that’s going on?” Clint argued.
“Miss Potts, apologies for the rough treatment. I’m sure you, better than I, understand why it was necessary?” Steve watched as she stared back at him, giving no indication either way.
“Tony!” Rhodey called out, pulling his attention from the phone to the soldier who came to a stop next to the open window in Tony’s door.
Rumiko had moved to sit on a small, flat bench on the side of the dock. He couldn’t help acknowledging that she looked rather pretty there in her rich clothes in the watery light of night. The clip that held back her dark hair was in her hands and the long strands spilled over her right shoulder.
Steve had sworn in that moment, breathless and squinting in the fading light at the shape of his unmoving brother on the cold, hard ground; he’d never forgive the USC for what they’d done. Steve would spend the rest of his life as far away from them as possible, making his own way with his small ship, living the free life he and Bucky had dreamed of as children.
Making sure to grip Tony’s shoulders tightly, Steve used the leverage to fuck up hard into the willing body below him, his thighs burning with excursion and his breath coming in through hot gasps of air.
He wasn’t entirely sure how long he was out of it for, but the world was fuzzy around the edges and he was so comfortable that the idea of opening his eyes didn’t even merit thinking about. He was pretty sure that someone said something, then there was a reply which sounded deeper and oddly rumbly, but Tony was content to tune them out as he relaxed into his pillow.
It did the trick and Tony tilted his head slightly, looking at Steve with a tired expression. Something about Tony’s whole demeanour appeared exhausted and in the back of his mind, Steve wondered if Tony had been getting enough sleep.
“When Tony found out, he was furious. He used a Good Night Kiss on me and I awoke the next morning in the front gardens of my house.”
“Oh, you know. Lots of parties, the people on my floor are pretty cool, and my classes are interesting enough,” she shrugged, the whole frame lifting and falling with the motion. Tony had offered to buy a house for her to live in, off campus, but she’d insisted that she liked the idea of having the ‘real college experience’.
Tony sent her a winning smile as a moment of silence dragged between the three before Pepper snorted in a distinctly unladylike way that her image of a pencil skirt and high heels would have one believe.
“Clint, put our visitors’ stuff in the cargo hold while I show him down to the engine room. Then I want you up on the bridge, let’s get this bird in the sky.”
“Well, I’ll see you for tea at 1800 hours,” Steve called out, having to make do with the vague hand wave he received from Tony who was still focused on the engine.
“No. No Googleing. We agreed that you get to test out new Stark Tech as long as you never, ever, use it to Google me.”
Looking over the catwalk down into the cargo hold, he didn’t see the familiar mop of dark hair. Steve moved on to the engine room, the closer he got causing the worry in his gut to grow. Tony seemed to always be talking, never shutting up even when everyone was telling him to. As a result, it was common to hear him well before he was seen by the rest of the crew.
“It’s alright, Darc; it’s going to be okay,” he said, throat clicking as he swallowed, heart still beating hard against his ribs as his mind whirled with all the ways that could have gone so much worse.
It was the work of no more than thirty seconds. While Steve punched a guy in the face, knocking him out cold, Clint scuffled with another before he finally gave up and Thor simply used the compression core to whack the idiot out cold, as he had done with own opponent. Looking over, Steve was about to intervene when the aggressor attacking the dark-haired man managed to land a glancing blow on his cheek. The smaller of the two stumbled back a step and Steve made to move towards them, when he suddenly pulled a laser gun from seemingly nowhere.
“Tony, we’ve been through this. You got hurt and it affected your ability to tell reality from your own imagination. Three years ago, you had the accident, Obadiah replaced you as head of Stark Industries and Miss Potts hired me to help out with your care.”
Darcy’s voice had been so soft than, if it weren’t for the complete silence of the entire room, Tony would never have heard it. As it was, he couldn’t be sure that he’d heard right anyway.
“Get rid of it, Jarvis. Please,” the please was softer that the rest of his words, and Tony cursed himself for letting emotions show through so clearly.
“Please keep us updated on the progress of finding a replacement, Director,” Steve politely requested.
As soon as they’d landed and he was able, Tony had been down the ramp and disappearing into the small town. Steve, in an effort to keep his crew safe, and suffering from a burning sense of curiosity, had quickly followed at a discrete distance. Natasha and Clint had followed him, mostly out of nosiness, while Bruce had shaken his head and said something about privacy. Thor, frankly, was no use at covert operations as he didn’t believe in hiding when he could just charge in full force.
Thankfully, it wasn’t too much further to the ship, and as Thor rode the bike up the ramp, Natasha had sprung off the bike and hit the button to raise the ramp.
“What can we do for you today, Director?” Steve asked pleasantly, ignoring the man’s clear irritation.
Tony nodded to the blond, noting with a degree of surprise in the back of his head that Steve had chosen to sit next to him on Tony’s right.
Leaving The Avenger at the North-West docking station, the rest of the crew wasted no time in finding a bar with half-decent drinks and actual food that wasn’t protein packs.
Besides, if Tony took ‘handled with the utmost care’ to mean that he rung the police department hosting the investigation and threatened them within an inch of their careers that if they didn’t pick up the pace and find his sister and get her home safe, he’d destroy their credit scores and have them on bimonthly drug busts for the rest of their lives. If Tony took ‘delicate situation’ to mean that, as soon as the police had managed to locate his sister and launch a rescue party, Tony was waiting just outside the police tape and, upon her being released, bundled the eight-year-old into his arms tightly, refusing to allow medical personal to see her for at least ten minutes because he simply
“Well, that’s different,” he absently patted Dummy when the bot nudged his shoulder, seeking attention.
“I will always be there for you, Darcy. Nothing will ever take me away from you; I’ll always come back. I promise,” he held out his hand, fist clenched save for his little finger which he extended in her direction.
“Okay,” Tony sighed, shoulders relaxing, before he turned to Darcy, her head bowed as she openly cried, silent but for the occasional sniffle.
It was going as usual, police issue laser guns were notoriously unreliable if you asked Steve, when a sudden pained sound caught his attention. He only just managed to flinch backwards, Tony’s head just missing colliding with his own as the other man jerked back against the cargo and into Steve.
“No, don’t,” the mechanics eyes were glassy with shock and pain as he gave another weak tug of Steve’s wrist.
Natasha wasted no time in smacking him on the back of the head, muttering about manners as Tony sniggered into his own fried shrimp beside Steve.
Usually, Steve was happy to let Tony go down to the workshop and fix his problems with the newfound solution, but that half finished hand print just wouldn’t leave him alone and without another thought, Steve was up and out of his chair, grabbing his sketchbook and pencil before chasing after the genius.
“Don’t be jealous, Captain Handsome, I’m sure someone will get their freak on with you soon enough,” Darcy winked at him, causing him to splutter and almost drop the pancake onto the stovetop.
“I had a bad dream,” she mumbled, only years of conditioning allowing Tony to catch the familiar rhythm of her words and deciphering them.
“You’ve got a lot of homework to do, and I know you’ll just get underfoot,” she added the latter part pointedly to Darcy.
“Right, Jane, we need to go shopping for oranges then,” Darcy said, Jane getting up as well with a nod, her magazine forgotten.
Steve felt his cheeks flush pink as he realised Tony hadn’t even glanced over to where he’d pointed. The idea that Tony was happy to go wherever Steve suggested, merely because it was Steve that had suggested it, sent a thrill of happiness up his spine.
“I think I lost a few years,” Clint tried to joke, but it fell flat with his tense posture and nervously tapping fingers.
After tucking her into his own bed, she had insisted and after that scare he didn’t blame her for not wanting to be alone, Tony went back downstairs to the lounge room and over to the toy, picking it up and staring at it with hard eyes.
His headache, which had receded slightly after arriving at SHIELD medical, came roaring back and he felt the taboo words bubble at the back of his throat. He didn’t want to say it, didn’t want to admit to the lie that had first left his lips at twelve years of age. He had sworn himself to secrecy all those year ago.
“Honestly, Captain,” he turned to Steve. “I’ve no idea what it is or, more importantly, what it does.” He removed his glasses and rubbed at his eyes for a moment before replacing them. “If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say it’s something like a cardiac infuser. It’s a practice used in patients with heart troubles, but this,” he waved a hand in the direction of the infirmary. “I’ve never seen something like this before.”
That, and perhaps a nice night out with just the two of them, no crew or near death emergencies to get in the way of their conversation.
“That’s a lot of cake,” Clint whistled from behind him, where the others had followed him into the kitchen.
“Come with me, I have something to make you feel loads better,” Tony got to his feet and, taking hold of her free hand, he led her over to his bed. Pulling out the bedside draw, he rummaged through it for a moment before taking out two cardboard boxes that he placed on the top of the table. Turning to Darcy, he lifted her under her arms onto the bed, before grabbing the boxes and holding them between them.
“She was in a horrible state though, what have you been doin' to her?” Tony continued, seemingly unaware of Steve’s brief misunderstanding and everyone else’s’ amusement.
“You laughed at me every time you saw me for the next week,” she said dryly, an unimpressed look on her face.
a few hours ago, and he wasn’t sure how to go about talking to the man just yet. Usually, when someone was mad at him, he just threw his latest creations at them, or pestered them until they forgave him. But, Steve was an unknown. Last time they’d argued, it had been silence and being away from one another for weeks before they’d really been able to talk like normal human beings again. Tony was pretty sure that approach wasn’t going to work a second time.
Pepper had proved herself to be terrifyingly competent in a crisis and before Steve knew it, she had acquired them USC soldier uniforms and strongarmed them into breaking into Stark mansion and searching it for Tony. Pepper had seemed convinced that this would be the place Obadiah Stane took Tony. Steve had no idea where to start looking so had gone along with her.
“Dummy, go fix up that table like you were meant to do yesterday,” he gently pushed the bot away, sad beeps letting him know that the bot was now sulking as it did what was asked of it at a glacial pace.
That was not an acceptable answer. He knew how slow the process could be, was intimately familiar with the last time when it had taken him nearly a week to be released.
“In a rush?” Steve asked, voice casual but his eyes flickered over her again, looking for any signs of a threat.
Through the other people milling about their daily – or was it nightly? – lives, he could make out the Yurma police officers gesturing and pointing towards them.
“I didn’t say it made sense,” the woman laughed, turning to throw her own corn husk into the flames, ending the process with clapping her hands together before her and giving a short, little bow.
For a moment, Steve tensed as he watched her eyes land on their entwined arms, worried that they were about to have a problem. However, he relaxed slightly when her eyes stayed there no longer than anywhere else they landed. She seemed to be taking them in as a whole, rather that judging their actions.
Tony had taken it upon himself to send a rather offical looking letter to SG, declaring that he would not be taking over the business, but instead intended for Pepper to take over. He had muttered for hours about how it was going to drive the board members mad that he'd been alive this whole time and simply not returned to the company. Steve had steered clear of his room during that time, the mutterings sounding a little too evil villain for him to put up with while holding a straight face.
Feeling along the edges for the release catch, he pushed it down on the first box and the lid popped up slightly with a hiss of air as the pressurised seal was broken. Pushing it back fully, Steve peered inside.
“Did she?” Darcy asked, looking him in the eye, smile faded and something soft, almost secretive, in her voice.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m going to be here for a little while. I have this ridiculously rich friend who has a huge mansion and they’re going to let me stay in one of his, no doubt, stupidly, expensively furnished spare rooms. He’s going to feed me as well, because he’s got that much money to spare and I’m only a poor college student,” Rhodey said, voice completely deadpan.
, his other hand leaving where it had been covering his wound to slide up his chest as he tried to cover something else.
“Now,” he leaned forward in his seat slightly, taking note of his fellow Avengers now settled and ready to begin on either side of him. “We’re here today to discuss the Avengers Initiative. I’ll hand over to Steve Rogers – our very own, Captain America - to tell you about it before we open up the floor to questions.”
Not that he would admit it, but Tony’s ears were still slightly ringing from the volume of Steve’s lecture.
The workshop light dimmed for a moment before returning to a white light, the blue disappearing. Reaching out, Steve slipped his arms around the genius, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder and pressing a small kiss to the skin just under his ear.
“Young Miss Darcy is in the foyer attempting to convince me that she is, indeed, doing her lesson work.”
“We’re good to go, Captain. That new compression core’s workin’ wonders and the engine is once more up and runnin’ just this side of efficient-like,” Clint reported cheerfully, before glancing back at Natasha and grinning.
Tony felt his heart swell at those words. He’d never had a best friend before. In fact, he’d never really had a friend. Sure, there was Jarvis, but while the man always made time to speak with him and was happy to listen about his newest projects, he was also there to do a job and had many chores and things to oversee on a daily basis. There were the kids at his school, as well, but they were always more interested in the fact that he was a Stark.
“Her name is Darcy Maria Lewis Stark,” Jarvis said softly from behind him, having followed at a more sedate pace.
“It’s okay, Darc. I will always protect you. I’ll always be here. Pinky promise,” he held out his little finger to her, having seen the kids at school do this when promising their friends that they would keep their secrets.
“How dare you come into me bar and say such filth!” The drunkards’ piggy little eyes were wide with rage, the whites completely visible around brown pupils.
“Well, let’s get on board and have a look,” he finally said, rolling his shoulders before pressing the intercom button.
Tony hated that guy. Not only was he the slimiest, most disgustingly useless man on earth, but he’d somehow gotten it into his head that Darcy was interested in him. Darcy had met him twice, both times she’d avoided making a scene because Tony had pulled her away to dance when she’d been about to say something scathing. Tony was positive that if the idiot ever tried anything on Darcy, she’d kick him so hard in the balls he’d never be able to reproduce… which wouldn't actually be such a bad thing.
“Firstly, not okay. I help you get away from laser tottin’ crazies and you tie me to a chair in thanks? Were you raised on a Rim asteroid? Secondly, I am not with the USC – I ain’t even sure how you jumped to that conclusion. I’m the last person to wanna buddy it up with those people. Seriously, why would I get on a ship with a crew of criminals if I was with the USC?” He paused, a thoughtful look on his face for a moment.
ahead of him. Those guests would strike out at Tony the moment they were alone and smuggle him off the planet with well bribed guards looking the other way. Obie looked like the years of lying and making himself millions while having betrayed both his best friend and godson had left him with peaceful nights and not a worry in the world.
“Buzz it for lifeforms or signs of distress,” Steve ordered, a feeling of dread beginning to grow in his stomach.
Steve couldn’t help but let out a small chuckle himself, relief mixing with disbelief that they’d managed to get away.
“Hey, I like that. Tony, when I decide to have a career change, remind me to put that on the sign of my cupcake business as the slogan,” she said, grinning at him.
“Move out, Tony,” his voice was one of command, but Tony rarely listened to it without some resistance.
“That depends; how much trouble are you in with Pepper?” Darcy asked with a raised eyebrow, her arm still stirring the batter in the bowl.
, get shot down before his eyes. Survival instinct kicked in, and he threw open the door and stumbled from the vehicle, ducking behind a rock onto the sand. Fumbling in his pocket, he managed to pull out his phone, brain fuzzy as to what the hell he was meant to do with it.
“I like to think so,” she grinned. “I don’t suppose you’re in the business of shuttlin’ people between planets?” She asked bluntly.
Steve stood up straight from his slouch to follow him, when suddenly the fat man from before was in front of him, eyes holding a glassy quality from the numerous drinks he’d been downing while Steve had stood watching Tony. The man’s face was flushed and he poked a pudgy finger into Steve’s chest.
Tony immediately knew that, no matter what the surprise was, he was going to like it. If only because she hoped he would.
He looked out the window and noted that, thankfully, only the outer glass had cracked, the protective inner glass was still intact and space-worthy.
Tony hummed lightly as Steve pulled back, and he got to watch as the brunet slowly opened his eyes, the brown orbs lit up with happiness. A soft smile curved his mouth and Steve felt an answering one on his own.
“Of course, wouldn’t want any shady soldiers sniffing around us,” Steve said blandly, unable to look directly at Nick as he spoke.
“Yinsen and I travelled together for a few months afterwards, planet hopping on anything that was space worthy. Finally, we parted ways with Yinsen headed for his home planet, and I for wherever the ‘verse took me. I never heard from him again…” Tony’s voice softened, sadness creeping into his tone.
“If you touch the engine we’ll be stranded here forever, if I touch Featherbrain, we get chicken for dinner.”
“It’s important to keep moral high, Clint,” Steve said disapprovingly, rustling his newspaper in a distinctly old man way, sending the archer a cool look as Clint filled his cereal bowl.
The companion profession was extremely difficult to get into, and brought with it a sense of respectability that a lawless ship like theirs desperately needed when dealing with the USC. While some might class companion’s as nothing more than godless whores, those with educated backgrounds and social sense knew that with a companion on your arm, you could get into almost any social event.
“Steve?” He squinted slightly at the man coming towards him, the Captain was indeed decked out in a USC uniform.
Tony’s lips thinned, clearly unhappy with the dismissal, but he just gave a short nod of acquiescent and looked away.
“No, Steve,” Tony snarled angrily at the man behind him. “We’re the Avengers - you’re Captain America, for fucks’ sake!”
“Okay, is everyone ready?” Pepper asked, standing before the assembled Avengers in the small waiting room off of where the conference tables were set up, individual microphones set up to pick up everything they said for the reporters who would be seated in front of them.
Tony landed on the balcony platform at the Tower, the spinning discs that removed his armour activating immediately. As he began the walk, Jarvis suddenly piped up in his ear.
Tony was used to mostly assertive partners, whose main goal was to get into Tony’s bed and then out of it just as fast. Steve was most definitely
Logically, he knew he should just go back into the safety of the lightened cave. But Tony was impatient, he especially hated having to wait for dawn to come just so he could move around outside without the threat of the various monsters that appeared throughout the night.
. Before Tony could fight it, the thought was nestled deep in his mind and his heart gave a thump that felt harder than any before it.
Tony lent more heavily against his side as they both stood there. Neither moved until long after the other ships were out of sight.
The thing about space that always amazed Steve the most, was the silence. Space was, as far as anyone would tell, still limitless in that no one had reached whatever the end of it was. Millions and millions of light years, and not one morsel of sound to be heard in the Dark that wasn’t manmade.
Timbetpal was one of the few planets that fell into a limbo of not being far enough away to be classified as a Rim planet, but not close enough to reap the benefits of the Core planet’s status. As a result, it had become nothing more than a simple farming planet, with small settlements located sporadically between the large fields of wheat, corn and sugar. The town they’d landed near was nothing more than a single main street, the few people who lived in town occupied the spaces above their shops, the farmers themselves living on their properties. The rarity of visitors made them stick out, the locals mostly peered at them in confusion, no doubt wondering if they’d accidentally gotten lost and landed on the planet by mistake.
“Well, I was just going to make normal ones, but,” Bruce glanced at Tony and his lips twitched, a sure sign he was trying not to laugh. “I remembered that Darcy said anything with blueberries in it was sure to draw out mad scientists from their lairs, so,” he shrugged and Tony tried and failed to frown at him.
“He got stuck on how to make the acid not corrode within an arrow head, apparently.” Pepper said, as if this explained everything to the very confused team.
There was one being in the ‘verse that all the evidence was beginning to point towards, a being so horrific that for people of the Core it was nothing but the stuff of nightmares and horror stories.
“Tony!” she cried, standing quickly and bumping the table, sending a pile of papers scattering onto the floor. At the same time a cord became visible and, just as Tony had suspected, a small speaker fell onto the cushions as she climbed over the couch to throw her arms around his waist.
The sound of a shot being fired behind them accompanied the jerk of the bike as Thor swerved slightly. Steve quickly lost himself to the familiar back and forth of a gun fight.
“It’s what people do when they make unbreakable promises. This means I won’t break this promise, not that I’d ever want to,” Tony said, as much conviction in his eleven-year-old voice as he could manage.
Once the two had effectively lost their companions in the crowds, Steve directed them towards a long wooden table that was serving up warm cider in clay mugs.
“Have we at least got the police working on possible leads? Do we know who has her? If we work out who has her, surely, we can bring up some places that they could be holding her or something,” Tony began rambling, mind whirling away.
He didn’t run into anyone else for a few, long minutes. The muffled sounds of screaming and yelling could still be heard, but there was an almost eerie silence falling around him. The only clear sound was the clanking of his footsteps and his slow, measured breaths.
He was beginning to think that the whole thing had been a waste of time when the com crackled to life once more.
He had known from the moment he’d met her that there was something not quite right about her. No way was a woman that beautiful and badass aspiring to be a mere personal assistant. Tony would have dedicated more brainpower to trying to figure her out if it wasn’t for the fact he was fairly focused on trying to find a way to not die. That, and the fact that Darcy had called the other day and left a very disturbing message about a man named Thor - and seriously, who the fuck names their kid
“Right, well, I’d like to say that this was short and sweet, but we all know that’s a lie. It was disgusting,” Tony said, eyeing the splattering of the honeybee’s insides that particularly coated the Hulk. Sometimes, wearing a suit of armour was a blessing. “I, however, have other things to attend to.” He took a step back from them and the whine from his boots signalled his imminent take-off.
What if they killed him? He might annoy them a little too much, or maybe they’d find someone else to build them bombs. Someone not as good, but they’d be compliant. He might never get to see his sister again, never talk to her or eat one of her amazing baked goods. That ridiculous conversation about pyjamas might be the last thing they said to one another. He could never say the things he should have said; about how grateful he was to have her in his life. She was the shining light in some of his darkest moments. He could never even tell her the truth, the secret of their mother that he kept hidden away from her. If he died, he wanted her to know the truth, even if it might hurt her. She’d need to hear something like that from him; no one else would be able to explain to her the reasons why he did what he did. Why he still continued with the lie. Why he’d made up the lie to begin with.
Steve reached forward and placed his book down on the small coffee table before sitting back and pulling Tony with him, the other man willingly sliding up from the ground and sitting on his lap, one leg on either side of his hips and curious hands running up his chest.
“Not to mention Rhodey’s angry phone call where I got to listen to him going on about you flying unregistered in American airspace,” she raised an eyebrow at him, a look remarkably reminisce of Pepper’s usual one.
Clicking on the link with the ship, Steve alerted the crew to their return and they pushed off hard with their knees towards the ramp of the Avenger. Once they were back on ship, they closed off the ramp and turned the airlock back on, the two boxes thumping loudly onto the ground once the gravity had been reactivated.
Tony watched as she pulled herself up to her full height, high heels making her taller than him, before she sent him a familiar, pointed look.
Steve tilted his head just enough so that he could shoot a look behind them, disguising his hand resting high on his thigh near his gun holster as him simply repositioning himself.
“I didn’t know that either,” Pepper continued her bold face lying, as if Phil was even listening to her anymore.
Tony didn’t say anything and just sighed, he’d need more than an afternoon of paperwork to figure that one out.
“Please,” Tony gasped, fingers twitching each time Steve pushed his finger back into him, pushing as far as he possibly could so his other fingers were pressed tightly to Tony’s skin.
Sorry for the late update, I feel those words are slightly inadequate for how long I've kept everyone waiting, but they're all I've got right now.
“I do like it, but Pepper does most of the stuff the CEO should. I just sign the papers when she tells me to, go to the fancy parties she says I need to be seen at and spend the rest of my time doing R and D stuff,” Tony said.
He walked into the cargo hold and up the stairs, along the catwalk until he reached the base of the stairs to the front hall. Turning left towards the bridge, he came to a stop just before it at the door to his own quarters. Pushing against the handle, the door swung backwards to expose the stairs below, and he descended.
There was significantly less screaming now, but still a lot of yelling, mostly what sounded like SHIELD directions, no doubt by now they had infiltrated the bottom floors of the building after the Avengers had cleared them.
He had made it a point to leave each of the Avengers to their own space once he’d finished putting in the final decorations and pictures. He didn’t want to make it seem as if he was hovering, that they were staying in a space that he owned and influenced. Well, he did own it, but he’d given them each their own areas and he’d hoped that they’d make them their own.
Tony stopped only a few steps into his workshop, head swinging around to where a couch had been shoved against the wall, out of the way. Sitting on it was his sister, her pretty green dress that she’d been talked into wearing by Obie, was now scrunched up in such a way that the wrinkles would never fully come out. Dummy’s head had lowered to where she had been stroking his support beam just above the camera. A reluctant smile quirked his lips as he moved over to her, undoing his tie and snagging a rolling stool to sit down on as he walked.
“Blast,” he grumbled, chucking the useless thing to the ground and digging around in his backpack in the hope of finding another one. Unfortunately it was fairly empty, only some food, an iron forged sword, seven tree seeds – he had no idea how they had gotten in there – and a small collection of the greatest treasures in the world.
“This here is Rumiko Fujikawa. She is part of the Fujikawa Industries family,” Nick made the introductions. “Rumiko, this here is Captain Steve Rogers of the Avenger. He’s out best bet at getting Doctor Helen Cho back.”
Tony kept most of his attention on his coffee and ate less than usual, nerves making him lose his already precarious morning appetite.
Tony had only been on the hunt for one of Darcy’s cupcakes when he’d entered the kitchen to find the now familiar sight of Steve sitting at the kitchen table, physical newspaper in front of him as he read the days’ headlines. He hadn’t even really thought about it, mind still occupied with the material composition of Captain America’s suit, when the words left his mouth without any kind thought of their reception.
“Apparently, Clint is going to attempt to cook pizza for lunch,” Tony read to Steve, looking up to see the amusement in his blue eyes.
Steve wasn’t quite quick enough to catch the lift before Tony was gone, but it was the work of a moment for JARVIS to bring back the lift for him and to go to the workshop, tap in his code and entre. The sight of Tony in full on invention mode, with holoscreens bathing him in blue light and a screwdriver in his right hand that he was using to enhance his gestures, was one Steve hoped to never forget.
“Ready, Captain?” Natasha’s voice was soothing, similar to that of a person trying to calm a child, as she appeared beside him, Clint slipping past and heading immediately down the stairs.
Standing up with a groan, he stretched his arms high over his head, fingers brushing the roof of his quarters, before he moved once more to the stairs. He had a ship to run, and if he stayed down in his quarters he’d just fixate over questions he didn’t have the answers to.
“Wrist brace,” Tony held up the invention innocently. “Much better than whatever crap SHIELD has had you currently using. I’m almost finished it, I just need to make the final adjustments based on fit. So, gimme,” he reached out once more for Clint’s wrist and the man hesitantly allowed him to attach the brace.
“Yes. It’s still in my chest. Medicine ain’t yet advanced enough to remove it without loss of life.”
The name had been carved, nothing more, and Steve had to wonder who it was that was special enough for Tony to request a trip out of their way just to honour them.
Tony put down his fork and sighed, he crossed his arms over his chest and lent away from the table, eyes raising to the ceiling for a long moment as he clearly gathered his thoughts.
As soon as the words had left her mouth, Pepper blushed a bright pink, one hand coming up to her mouth in a belated attempt to hold in the words as her other hand clutched the paperwork to her chest.
Tony awoke with a groan, a cold tile floor beneath him, the surface slightly abrasive under his fingers as they twitched.
“Is it lunch time?” he asked, happily dropping his pencil on the table top and turning away from his desk.
A slightly hysterical part of Tony marvelled that Traveller may have in fact been slightly psychic with an ability to see the future, as he was sure Darcy would no longer speak to him after this.
Steve quietly stared through the observation window into the infirmary, his arms crossed over his chest and eyes fixed on the now peaceful figure sleeping on the lone medical seat.
“Fifteen credit, hurry, hurry,” he held out his ring heavy hand, fingers curling and uncurling impatiently.
“Funny lookin’,” she said, pulling out her thumb in order to reach down and touch the edge of the band aid.
“When you said, there was going to be a whole lot of trouble coming our way, this wasn’t exactly what I had in mind.”
“Seeing as we all know you’re not going to talk to any psychiatrists’, we’re giving you the option of talking to us about what happened today,” Steve explained.
“Once, long time ago,” something wistful wrapped around his words for a moment before he cleared his throat. “Yeah, okay, I could do with seeing somethin’ pretty for a change.”
“Lies,” Tony forced a smile onto his face, trying to make his voice sound as normal as possible when his throat felt like it was closing up.
“Miss Potts wishes to remind Miss Darcy that she has a plane to catch shortly and that she refuses to allow her to use the private jet if she can’t get there in time for her flight.”
“Looks like a remodelled Scow ship,” Steve said, stepping into the suit and pulling it up around him.
“God, you’re so hot like this.” Steve moved back slightly so that he could see the expression on Tony’s face as he repeated the movement with his finger, the warmth in his gut almost exploding into a fire down to his toes at the expression of bliss on the other mans face.
Jarvis led him from the entrance room and up the stairs with a gentle hand upon his shoulder. They walked through the empty house that reminded Tony of the museum Jarvis had taken him to the previous Summer. Walking along the quiet hallways, they were almost to Tony’s room when worry twisted his stomach.
The door shut and Tony remained still as Jarvis turned around, a small smile lifting the corners of his lips upon sighting his young charge. In a move far too casual not to have been planned, Jarvis picked up the newspaper from the small table and deposited it atop the hanging closet, a spot Tony would have difficulty in reaching. Tony, however, wasn’t particularly interested in the paper anymore, it wasn’t like it would say anything he didn’t already know.
Captain America was cool enough to impress their father, so he had to be something extremely special. Tony figured that if he could become even half as amazing as him, one day his dad might even be proud of him too.
“We’ll figure out what we have here for now, then box them back up and deal with them later,” he said, eyes once more dragging back to Tony who was still going through the first box.
“Well,” Darcy broke off as Jane suddenly slapped Thor once more, looking a little surprised at her own action.
“Kitchen?” he said slowly, the gears in his mind trying to switch tracks from upgrades for the iron man suit, to the location of the kitchen within the Tower.
“He’ll get over it,” Steve shrugged, taking his final bite of cake, studiously avoiding everyone’s eyes.
Steve turned slightly, Tony still kept next to him with his arm around his waist, to see Bruce and Thor. The doctor’s glasses were askew on his face and Thor had a darkening red mark on his left cheek.
“I’ll make sure to remind her to do so,” Darcy grinned at him, relaxing minutely, her stirring slowing slightly.
“I believe she has it hidden under the couch cushion this time,” Jarvis turned to receive the luggage Tony had brought home with him from the driver.
“What is it?” he asked as Dummy rolled over to him, camera turning this way and that to get various different views of the man.
“Right. Remind me again why we’re the only ones here. Seeing as so many of these people are mutants, why the hell do the X-Men get to sit this one out?” Clint bitched, eyes watching the so far empty reception area just inside.
Over the course of the next hour the others trickled back. Bruce arrived with a large bag, almost bursting at the seams with what Steve guessed would be medical equipment and supplies, no doubt liberated from somewhere. Clint had turned up with a large grin on his face, no other bags, but the definite smell of the beer the planet Achernar, or
“You staying?” Tony asked quietly, leaning into Steve’s side, head pushed up under his chin and into his neck. No doubt getting all manner of grime all over Steve’s clothes.
When the Chitauri invasion had been over, and Loki detained by SHIELD - too late to be of any actual use as normal - the six newly dubbed Avengers had found themselves in a shawarma place that Tony had noticed a few weeks ago, but hadn’t yet tried out. Not much was said that afternoon, exchanges and promises to meet again soon saved for the following day when Thor had taken his bat-shit crazy brother and returned to Asgard, along with the Tesseract. Tony had then extended invitations to his Tower for his teammates, that they had a place to stay if they should find themselves in New York again.
“Please, Mr Stark, there is no need to resort to childish name calling. We are only here to help you. But to do so, you must allow us,” Traveller continued.
“Maybe. Depends on what the surprise is,” Tony said dryly, under no illusions that it was just as likely to be a spectacular mess he’d have to clean up in the kitchen, as a chocolate cake for him to eat.
He didn’t see anyone else until he had to pass through the kitchen, but there was some kind of drinking game happening between Darcy, Clint, and Natasha, with Bruce sitting at the head of the table, a chalk slate before him to keep score.
“Sightseein' is nothin’ to travellin’ around and seein’ all the planets with you. Let’s just enjoy our ale while we’re here, then we can start our next adventure when Natasha returns tomorrow.”
Tony semi-stumbled after Darcy, one wrist caught in her hand as she dragged him along, his free hand covering a yawn and rubbing at his eyes in an effort to wake up properly. They only paused briefly when they reached the elevator, Darcy almost vibrating where she stood. As soon as the doors opened, she took a step forward only to stop in surprise at the sight of Steve leaning against the box wall, his nose buried in a book.
Tony felt more like someone had slammed a cage around him and put him on display as the freak attraction at the zoo.
Steve tried to ignore the sound of a covered-up snort of laughter from the doorway, and instead raised a hand and pinched the bridge of his nose, praying for some patience.
“Yeah, you too. You even missed your birthday,” she let out a hiccupped laugh. “And introducing me to Jarvis properly. We had quite the encounter when I first got here.”
“When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?” Maria Hill asked snidely from the side.
Steve placed the damp tea towel he’d been using to dry the dishes from breakfast onto the counter with a small sense of disappointment. Tony and he had been tasked with the dishes that day and they’d turned what was normally a rather boring chore into a game when Tony had suddenly flicked him with water when he’d been telling the mechanic to hurry up as he was drying faster than Tony was washing. The two had quickly dissolved into a childish game of water flicking, laughter loud in the otherwise empty room.
“Oh, yeah they’re fine. Selvig had a drinking contest with Thor and won a massive hangover. Jane and Thor are totally sweet on each other; it’s like something out of a Nicholas Sparks movie. You know who else I saw recently?” she continued before he could get a word in edgeways. “Coulson was down here, remember, he took my StarkPlayer? He still hasn’t given it back, Tony.”
Tony paused for a moment, looking back at him with a pleased smile on his lips, before he allowed the distraction of the market to capture him again.
“It’s an awesome reason. I know you’d like for me to take more of an interest in the scientific community-”
Tony was momentarily disorientated when his vision suddenly went dark; his body tensed to lash out, only to recognize the now familiar warmth at his back and the rich smell of Steve’s cologne. It took him a further second to realise Steve had covered his eyes with one large hand, and Tony tried hard not to think about that hand touching other areas of his body.
“What’s my father doing to get Darcy back?” he demanded, steady heart or not, this was still his little sister that was missing.
“Now, now,” the dark-haired man scrambled to his feet, hands held up before him in the universal sign of submission.
Steve nodded, remaining still and waiting for Tony to continue. When he didn’t, Steve took the initiative.
sister - had been kidnapped. Tony, himself, had been kidnapped by various people three times already. The first when he had been four and hadn’t really understood the severity of his situation as he’d been given a book of mathematical equations which he’d happily worked through until a nice police officer had happened upon the room he was being kept in and taken him home. He’d even gotten to keep the book of equations which he’d finished the next day under Jarvis’s watchful eye. The second had been a year later, when a boy a few years older than him had encouraged him to leave the school yard with him and Tony, desperate for somebody -
“Are you guys going to the kitchen?” he asked as the doors closed, his voice sounding slightly strained.
“Isn’t that Captain America?” Darcy suddenly asked, eyes staring at the screen in the middle. Tony’s eyes snapped over to it, his breath catching in his throat.
A calmness settled over Steve, he was content to sit in the grass, with candles and outdoor torches to light up the area as the music played. Tony shifted closer to him, leaning against his side with a head nudging against his shoulder comfortably.
The unease in his gut increased. He had hoped that the pods would be gone, that there had been a problem and the passengers of the ship had gotten out.
Steve watched quietly as Thor and Clint descended into a pub song they’d picked up somewhere, no doubt while they’d been on a Rim planet illegally. Bruce was quietly laughing to himself as he watched the two become increasingly ridiculous with their antics. Steve drank deeply from his ale once more, eyes straying back to the bar where Tony was leaning towards the bartender, a hand sliding across the bar top towards the woman. For a moment, Steve thought Tony was actually reaching for her, but then he realised that there was a smooth exchange going on in the middle of the busy bar.
They looked up through the glass when the dot was almost on them and, though the USC Skiff cruiser blocked most of their view, they could clearly see a large space craft dwarfing the government ship.
“I hate cleaning up other people’s messes,” Tony sighed from where he was sitting in one of the seats in his armour, helmet resting on his lap. Usually he would have flown ahead to take stock of the situation, but Steve had argued that they’d present a stronger force by arriving together. Tony had argued back, but then Steve had given him one of those sad-eyed looks and said that he’d just wanted Tony to be safe and, well, Tony really needed to sit down and have a strongly worded talk with Steve about emotional manipulation of one’s boyfriend and how bad it was that he was doing it… Eventually.
Steve leaned forward slightly, affection filling his chest as the other man blinked sleepily as he sat up, a hand reaching over to affectionately pat Steve’s knee.
“No, that’s definitely your sulking face,” Darcy chirped, disgustingly amused by the entire situation.
“But, I do have something I need you to do,” he pulled away from her and stood, reaching on his desk for a USB drive.
“You know of Tony Stark?” Thor asked, unsubtly gravitating back to Jane while he spoke to Darcy, stilling only when he was at her side once more.
“You don’t know, it could be giant moths next week, a giant centipede the week after. There are a lot of bugs in the world and many insane people. It’s definitely plausible,” Jane, who had been sitting quietly at the table with Pepper, spoke up, a small smile quirking the corner of her lips.
Sitting up straight and looking around to the entrance of the room, Tony gritted his teeth at the sight of his father leaning against the door frame in a slightly ruffled suit, the smell of alcohol coming off of him so strong that Tony could smell it all the way across the room.
Steve wasn’t fooled for a moment, his well-practiced eyes caught sight of the small slip of paper Tony palmed off to the man over the countertop, disguised as a friendly slap on the shoulder as he pulled back with a small smile.
“Answer the phone, Tony, and you’ll get your coffee back,” Steve said, voice completely serious for what was, essentially, a children’s game of keep away.
It didn’t stop them, however, from manoeuvring it so that Steve ended up seated next to Tony. It also didn’t prevent Steve, when his leg accidentally knocked against Tony’s under the table, from resting it there firmly.
,” a humourless smile crossed Tony’s face. “I was injured by shrapnel, right in the chest, close to my heart.” Steve’s breath caught in his throat, eyes drawn to where Tony had flattened his hand over his heart. “I don’t remember too much of what happened next, just the pain.”
“Spill, Tony,” she said seriously, and Tony let out a quiet sigh before he explained the whole situation.
“Well, go out and see her, surprise her, ladies like that sort of thing,” Tony waved his hand emphatically as he spoke.
He was in a fairly disused sitting room in the East Wing of the mansion his family had called home since the planet had been settled upon.
by the carefully aim barbs. That, and maybe the little bit of guilt lurking in the back of his mind regarding his own words and actions in the face of the man who was all but his childhood hero.
Tony wouldn’t admit it, but the interruption of Jarvis was something of a relief. The conversation had been getting a little too close to his darkest secrets for his comfort.
“What on Earth-that-was have they done to you?” Tony finally muttered, his eyes still fixed on the engine.
“There’s no sign of scavengers or pirates. No indication that the USC changed their minds and ordered the ship to return via one of their own vessels. I even checked the logs, they’re completely normal until they just suddenly stop. Everything on this ship has suddenly stopped,” she stared at him intently, as if he knew the answer.
Feeling fidgety in the uncomfortable air of the kitchen, Tony crammed the last of his pancakes into his mouth and stood up.
“What’s happened?” He asked as he hurried down the stairs, the loud thumping of his shoes on the metal heard over the engine roaring to life as they began their ascent into the sky.
Arriving on a planet Tony swore he'd never visit again, Steve makes plans for his and Tony's future as an old friend of Natasha's appears on the scene - seeming to know a lot more about their mysterious mechanic than she should.
“I’m goin’ to check the storage holds, keep everyone on task. I ain't wanna linger here,” Steve said, ignoring the tightening of her jaw when he didn’t share his thoughts with her.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m getting there. Well, perhaps the reason that he was such a werido wasn’t anything to do with him being one of those hipster kids. He may have been an alien,” she concluded, with the air of someone who’d presented a perfectly logical argument.
“What the hell!” Clint squawked, wrenching his arm away and sending Tony a totally unjustified glare, gaining the attention of the rest of the room in the process.
Thor, however, didn’t get the memo and suddenly the blonds thick arm swung around his shoulders and Steve had to lock his knees to keep from going under from the added weight.
Tony remained half-leaning against him, arm around Steve’s own waist with his hand clutching at his shirt, and head hanging forward to press against Steve’s chest with each step they took.
“Yes, Sir. I took the liberty of ordering some coffee to be delivered to the workshop floor while you were sleeping.”
“Thor, get Tony down to the ships engine. Tony, if you can’t get the engine up and runnin' at full capacity in less than five minutes, I’ll shove you into an airlock myself.
“See, I really don’t think I do. I told them I was working on something and, here I am, working on something,” he spread his arms wide and grinned, his new holoscreen technology surrounding him in a soft, blue light.
“What kind of surprise?” he asked, very much awake now, but still holding out a slim hope that she’d give up and leave him be.
“I’m sorry, this is the ‘fun-vee’, the ‘hum-drum-vee' is back there,” Tony waved him off, no desire to listen to the other man’s complaints about his hangover again. It wasn’t Tony’s fault that the soldier didn’t know moderation.
A series of beeps emitted from the machine when Tony’s hand made contact, and maybe Tony had accidentally programmed in parameters to imitate dog-like behaviour after all, because the bot proceeded to tilt its claw slightly into the gentle petting Tony administered like it was a particularly pleased canine.
“Not Jarvis, our lovable AI overlord. I mean our butler as kids, Edwin Jarvis,” Darcy slowed what she was doing, her voice softening for a moment, before she seemed to pull herself together and projected enthusiasm into her voice.
“I’d say it’s nostalgia. Just because the human race isn’t restricted to one tiny planet anymore ain't mean that we should just forget our history. It’s important to remember where we’ve come from so we can chart where we’re goin'.”
?” Tony muttered to him, head tilted towards him, but eyes remaining focused on the scene unfolding before them.
“Darcy?” Rhodey asked, surprised as Tony obligingly tilted the phone so that they could see one another.
“I’ll have you know I looked very dashing, like a very young, genius, multimillionaire, CEO,” he put on his most obnoxious voice, pleased when she finally gave in and laughed loudly.
“Mister Stark,” Phil said smoothly, putting away his phone like everything was normal and he hadn’t just essentially broken into Tony’s brand new Tower.
“No way,” Tony breathed, half ecstatic that the bot was clearly ‘thinking’ for itself, and half dismayed that it appeared to have taken a random word from Tony’s mouth and christened itself with a ridiculous name.
Steve’s cheeks flushed both with self-conscious embarrassment at his childish behaviour, and pleasure at Tony’s obvious amusement.
“At what?” Tony asked, wishing he had his sunglasses so that there would be some kind of barrier between them.
Hoping the way his heart was lodged firmly in his throat wasn’t showing on his face, he peered over the railing into the cargo hold below.
“Stop snivelling, child! Get out of my sight!” his voice was thunderously loud in the quiet room. The glass he’d been holding flew into the heat of the fire, causing the flames to flare.
Tony,” Bruce looked pale and slightly nauseated, his eyes locked on Tony who had dropped his eyes and was now determinedly staring at Steve himself, daring him to say something.
“This ain’t the place for such discussions,” he spoke over Jane’s rapid fire talk, ignoring the glare that landed on him for his trouble.
The Skiff model ship had been popular as a small war ship decades before, but the remodelling of ship engines to make them more efficient and powerful had seen them die off in popularity with the USC. Now, they were scarcely seen in the Core, but every now and then Steve had seen one patrolling in the Rim, likely regulated to the nonessential and forgotten planets that the USC probably hopped would just die out so they’d no longer be costing them money for surveillance.
“Justin Hammer is an asshole who couldn’t weld two pieces of metal together with an instruction manual and someone overseeing him. Why the hell would I sign over anything to that bastard?” Tony spat.
“Okay, here goes. I need you to push this button on the keyboard for me,” Tony rolled the stool over slightly, so that she could reach out and with a single, small stab of a button, the machine before them initiated a series of beeps and an odd whirling noise. The duo sat in silence as slowly, of its own volition, the helper bot raised its claw-like head and they could hear the loud zoom feature from the camera. The machine turned its head until it was focused on them, the zoom feature seeming to go crazy as it assessed them.
“Maybe,” Phil acquiesced as they reached the bridge; now able to hear those of whom Tony supposed Nick Fury had deemed special enough to join the ‘Avengers’ team.
“He’s the best superhero ever. He fought for America in World War Two. He can beat any bad guy and he has this awesome shield that he throws to knock out all the bad guys and protect people. He’s the best,” Tony grinned happily.
Then, because he was Tony Stark and seriously, he just couldn’t help himself, he picked up the small electric pen and lightly jabbed it into the older man’s side.
“So, how’d you guys end up at a festival that you know nothin' about?” the woman asked once they began walking back to the main festival area.
“He wasn’t angry at you, Darc,” Tony said firmly, moving over to her and pulling her into his arms for a tight hug, her own hands clenching in the fabric of his shirt and her breathing fast.
“This is all there is right now, Darcy! There’s me, the suit and making this right,” Tony growled, frustration in his voice as he stood to pace, agitation making him tense.
Clint and Natasha had, unsurprisingly, appeared overnight together. Tony was only aware that they were even living at the Tower when he’d wandered into the kitchen to actually eat something - without his usual supply of food or Dummy on smoothie duty, he found himself stuck having to go to an actual kitchen for sustenance - and had found the spy duo eating sandwiches with Bruce. Tony had blinked, made a small ‘huh’ of acknowledgement, and proceeded to steal half of Clint’s sandwich, pushing the archer away when he’d tried to get it back with claims that he was paying for the food, ergo it was all partly his anyway,
“Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you,” Tony pointedly glanced back to where Natasha was piloting the jet, the humour leaving him.
“Ow,” Tony let out a pitiful noise as he pushed himself up, Clint snorted loudly in amusement. Steve turned back to Natasha, the man clearly hadn’t really hurt himself and Steve was intent on getting them all off this cursed ship as fast as possible.
Steve drank deeply of the cheap ale the bar was selling, eyes tracking the loud music and chatter that surrounded him.
Glancing over his shoulder, he saw that Tony had emerged from the small corridor that lead to the infirmary and spare passenger dorms, one of which was now officially Tony’s bunk. Bruce was a step behind the mechanic, and Steve realised that they’d both come from the infirmary together, a common place to find Tony when he wasn’t crooning sweet nothings at The Avenger’s engine.
“I know. Once you get an idea in your head, you’re like a dog with a bone,” she sighed, her jeans were slightly singed and dirt smeared her top, Dummy’s head in her lap and restless fingers ran up and down his support strut, a familiar action to them both after years of repetition.
“My point is; you haven’t even given the future a chance yet, Steve. Holing yourself up in the Tower won’t get you anywhere good, you need to get out there a bit. When you’re ready to do that, come find me,” wisdom imparted, Tony turned and left the kitchen, heading for the elevator and his workshop, taking another bite of the frankly delicious cupcake as he walked.
“I quite look forward to the battle, it has been too long since we faced a worthy foe,” Thor said loudly, hammer already in hand from where he peered out a small side window.
“You’re so going to eat those words when I show you my surprise of sheer awesomeness. I’mma make you throw me a party with a big-ass banner that reads: ‘Darcy - sister of the century’ in large, black font,” she poked her tongue out at him.
Finally, Natasha appeared from the never-ending stream of people passing by, the darkening sky not deterring the tourists in the least.
Many thanks to the wonderful MxGryffindorOtaku for excellent beta work! Any further mistakes are all on me.
“Sorry your murderous plan to see the end of the Stark line – and therefore allowing you to take their place without opposition – failed.”
The two lapsed into words too soft for Steve to make out, but they didn’t move further apart then to let their arms fall from around one another. Steve didn’t want to look too closely at that, but it was difficult not to think that something was going on when they’d greeted one another so affectionately. It was different to how Tony had been with Rumiko, there had obviously been some bad blood shared between them that lingered. The hug and look of relief and exasperation on the woman’s face when she’d approached Tony told a very different story.
“Obie, please,” Tony felt something fragile and childlike in his chest constrict as he momentarily flashed back to when he was five and he just wanted an adult to pay him some attention, just that tiny bit. It had been Obie who had looked down at him, who had offered a smile and a ruffle of hair as he passed by, Maria and Howard already out the door and too far gone to notice their son standing at the threshold, staring at their retreating backs. Obie had paused for that split second, had looked down at him and smiled. Tony could still feel the phantom pressure of his large hand on his head, how he’d messed up Tony’s hair, how Tony had spent the next week refusing to let Jarvis comb it as he spent hours secretly staring into the mirror, trying in vain to recreate the way his hair had looked after being messed up. How he hadn’t been able to do it, but some little voice in his head had said that it was okay, that it was alright that he couldn’t do it, because Obie would do it again one day.
They weren’t that far into the Rim yet, that there wouldn’t be people who passed between the boarder of the Core planets and the outer Rim planets, he supposed. Ariel, however, was a fairly pricey place and not somewhere he would normally go, given the many USC soldiers who holidayed there. However, money was money, and he followed it wherever it led.
“I really hope you’re bein’ honest about those favours. You’re goin’ to be on cargo cleaning duty for the next Earth-that-was month for this.”
He felt broken open, that the people before him were staring into the very yolk of his soul and his normal barriers and self-censoring were completely wrung dry and not kicking in.
He took a second to be thankful that the rest of the crew weren’t around to mock him as he embarrassed himself.
“Like their daddy, I assume,” Steve snorted, missing the flush that spread over Tony’s cheeks at his words due to Dummy happily shoving his camera in Steve’s face.
“Don’t either of you ever sleep?” there was the familiar exasperation Tony was so well acquainted with.
People seem to like the premise for this story, which is awesome as it’s really interesting to write. This sections is basically a fast forward of IM1, IM2 and the Avengers. So much assumed knowledge going on here, but I thought it’d be dull to basically rewrite the movies. I pretty much picked and chose what I wanted to include based on what gave information about the main events, adding in certain twists and conversations to cover my bases.
“We’ve tracked him heading in the direction of the Ravencroft Asylum,” Fury said, and Tony’s stomach clenched with dawning horror.
“Sure do, I checked it out and the Political Sciences program there is pretty sweet looking,” she grinned, victorious.
Out of everything she’d said thus far, this was the one thing she seemed to be particularly upset about. Apparently, encounters of the alien kind didn’t bother her as much as not being able to listen to her music when she fancied.
“No,” Tony groaned, bloody fingers slipped around Steve’s wrist as he tried to pull him away from his shirt.
“Do you understand now?” Steve asked softly, breaking Tony out of his reflective thoughts, fingers still running over Sparky in his lap.
“Anyway,” he turned to Pepper. “Here’s to us, us three, celebrating the future of clean energy,” he lifted his own flute, waited a moment for the two women to mimic him, and they clinked their glasses lightly together in a toast.
“I, uh, I,” Steve trailed off, eyes locked on the slowly rotating holoscreen before him that showed Clint’s quiver, pulled apart and expanded.
Bruce was talking to Tony as the two lounged near the airlock, no doubt continuing the conversation they’d begun that morning over breakfast.
“Official consulting hours are between eight and five, on every other Thursday,” He tried protesting again, just on principle now more than anything, he couldn’t completely deny that his interest had been quipped by the file.
“Might as well,” Tony would’ve shrugged if he could, voice strained as he pushed the suit for all it was worth, the nuke heavy on his back.
“Oh, uh, yeah. Sure, let’s go,” Tony nodded, moving to get up as Steve stepped back to give him room.
“Ah, well,” Clint pushed a lever forward slightly and the ship spun to the right, bringing the USC Skiff cruiser into view.
The sudden onset storm, coupled with the arrival and departure of Thor and Loki, made them pause their conversation and Tony was happy to leave the Captain behind as he went after the two gods alone.
“Mmm, that’s because he didn’t grow up with you,” Tony said shrewdly, sending her a bland smile when she huffed.
Steve knew he had to get up though, knew he couldn’t fuck the other man without lube, despite what Tony might try and convince him of while he was blissed out. He knew that doing it with just spit to ease the way would end up with Tony sore for days. Honestly, Steve wasn’t sure he could go through watching Tony in pain for days because of him, nor could he miss out on his daily sex quota that Tony was only too happy to fill.
“Sure, be back in a moment.,” Steve grinned, heading towards the counter where a chirpy looking girl, no older than Darcy, greeted him by name and with an enthusiastic smile.
“Heaven forbid the paper ever just report some of the good stuff that’s going on in the world,” Clint snarked.
Suddenly, Steve reached out and took hold of Tony’s shoulder in one of his large hands. The grip was bordering on painful, but it served the purpose of getting Tony’s attention to focus on Steve’s baby blues.
“Okay, everyone, let’s get goin'.” Bruce, Clint and Natasha all nodded and, holding what they’d found, headed back without argument. Steve, too, began moving forward before glancing back at Tony, the unusual silence alerting him to a potential problem.
The small, pleased smile on Steve’s lips when Tony stayed for the entirety of the debrief (snarking his way throughout, he would never be the poster child for well-behaved) almost made up for the hours of his life he’s never be able to get back.
He had known James Rhodes for a year now, and had picked up that talking about feelings or anything similar was not his forte. To know that Rhodey had taken it upon himself to come out to Manhattan, just to ask Tony a simple question that he could have asked over the phone.
“Come on, Thor, let’s go ice your bruised cheek,” Bruce said, having deemed everyone in the bridge in no immediate danger.
“My control, snapping,” Steve managed to flick open the button, pulling down the zip as he licked from Tony’s shoulder to ear where he sucked lightly on the lobe.
“I wouldn’t have been able to adapt to the world I found myself in so well,” Steve said, honestly ringing in his voice.
“I’m being molested here! Bad touch!” Tony exclaimed, doubling his efforts to try and push Clint away from him.
The woman laughed at them, not seeming at all bothered by their lack of belief in the harvest god they were currently at a festival celebrating.
“We need someone sellin’ compression cores,” Steve said, eyes tracking left and right as he led the way down the middle of the main street at the North-East port on Stuttgart.
The room around him was neat and tidy, crisply white and clinical. No holes in the wall, no rubble on the ground, although there was a spilled tray of food on the floor around him, where his armour had once been. No dead body of a security guard was slumped on the floor, only white tiles stretched from one end of the room to the other. Tony looked around in confusion at the bedroom, a single white bed pressed against the wall, with a small window to the outside world split by steel bars. The ridiculous outfit Traveller had been dressed in was gone and in its place, were hospital scrubs that employees in all medical facilities wore. The arms around him, however, were still holding on tightly and some twisted part of him took a measure of comfort from that.
“It was completely unexpected, I wasn’t thinkin’ I’d fall in love on your ship, but I have to thank you for pickin' me up.”
“Nah, you won’t,” his voice became practically cheery. “I’m a loveable stray, you’d never get a wink of sleep from the guilt.”
“No, I mean,” Steve looked at the workshop as a whole once more. “This whole place is… really something, Tony,” he finally turned to look at the genius and Tony felt the pride in his chest grow.
Steve made his way through the hallways and down the stairs into the cargo hold, heading over to the airlock that would connect to the other ship, Natasha at his heels. Thor was already there, pulling on a space suit as was custom for unknown ships, one never knew if their oxygen levels were holding steady until they’d physically stepped on-board.
He could begin any damage control while he waited for his cake, staying close enough to hear if the topic of his parents was resumed, or if he could relax once more.
“If I’d wanted a cheap knock-off, I’d have bought one of them instead of making a state-of-the-art, highly advanced technological canine.”
He had been thinking about this for months now. Admittedly, he probably would have approached it much more slowly and progressively, but as he was on a bit of a time limit these days, he figured that this was something Darcy wouldn’t want to have to be burdened with if the worst should happen.
“So, I was just saying to Jarvis, I might be coming to visit you this weekend,” he said, unable to hear himself finish as excited squealing filled his ear, enough to force him to pull the phone away until she’d calmed down slightly.
Tony was so excited that he couldn’t stop his leg from bouncing as he sat in the back of one of this fathers’ chauffeured cars that had picked him up from the airport. He absently patted the robot next to him on the seat, his jacket covering it so that there was no way the surprise would be revealed before it was time. He had been slaving away over his newest creation during his spare time for the past month and a half and it was finally ready. Well, he knew he could probably have done some more work on it if he’d had the time, but he hadn’t seen his sister for almost two months now and he was anxious to get home and give her the present.
He pulled her into his arms and squeezed her tight, causing her to erupt into giggles and thus breaking the heavy atmosphere that had been weighing down the room.
Glancing around the room, Tony felt himself consciously relax. Maybe, he didn’t need to be so alert around these people.
“Let me go - you asshole!” Tony tried to squirm out of the grip, but it wasn’t working. If anything, Tony found himself crushed harder against the strong chest, the feeling of numerous small cylinders in a cross shape digging into his back. God, Tony would bet his whole fortune that those were blocks of spare ammunition strapped to the guys’ chest.
The rest of the crew worked quickly to get the ship back into the sky and, in a matter of minutes, they were leaving Timbetpal behind.
