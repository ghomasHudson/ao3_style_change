kiss."  He ran a hand through Steve's hair, then brushed behind his ear teasingly.
"You're staying," repeated Tony, heart pounding.
.  Now he's going to turn into an Alpha.  And a girl."
Steve blushed crimson.  "So...what's after this?" Steve asked, trying to sound casual, inspecting a piece of cucumber with a smile. "More spa stuff? Dinner? ...bed?"
"It's not shit," replied Dan, a bit defensively.  "Alpha organizations exist to protect omegas. They're not all like Steve, Tony.  Most of the omegas here got rescued from really shitty situations. And Alphas United funds a lot of pro-omega programs.  Education, technical and vocational training, reassignment--"
He came out wrapped in a bedsheet, hair wild.  There was no mistaking what he and Steve had been up to.
"We're not soldiers!" protested Tony.
how territorial they are--"  Everyone was laughing. "--and I'm running around the back yard, covered in yolk up to my knees, getting chased by the biggest damn gander you've ever seen, hackles up, and my pop was running after me with the camera, going, 'I knew it, I knew that boy was an Alpha!'"
"He doesn't shake," said Lowenstein, swatting his hand down.  "Does Mr. Rogers have any representation yet?"
He watched with a sigh as Tony bolted out of bed and to the toilet. He went to go get him a glass of water, holding it out do  Tony when he was done.
Tony perked up slightly.  It was the wee hours of the morning, three or four am, but she was here, just like she'd promised, not a hair out of place.  Tony had always admired her ability to compose herself on short notice.  She was wearing a navy skirt suit, looking like she'd come straight from the office.  Tony wondered if she even had any non-work clothes.  Their relationship had always been professional; Tony couldn't imagine her walking around in a t-shirt and sweatpants, even though he would have liked to.
Gideon's expression twisted in confusion, like he didn't know how to comprehend the two-letter word.
"Thanks," said Tony.  His tone was flat, and distracted.  It was clear that his mind was elsewhere.
"Sorry, he's running kind of slow, I'm trying to download the last season of
"We're actually doing this," Steve kept saying. "Oh my God."
Pepper got up.  She didn't like the way Tony was acting, which was... normal and responsible.  "What about Steve?"
. There was everything Steve could possibly ever need and more. He'd raided some gym supplies, stealing some clothes that were probably Happy's. They were tight on him, but only Tony was going to see him in them so it hardly mattered, right?
He'd used to shove his fingers in his mouth when he'd occasionally touched himself in his shared apartment with Bucky. Steve had always wanted to keep quiet and hoped that the other wouldn't notice. He wanted to think of Steve as pure, not committing dirty acts...but sometimes he'd just gotten so frustrated...
Eric shook his head with a smile.  "So the rumors about you being a playboy are all true?"
He yanked.  The wires tugged, then went limp.
Steve let out a ragged breath. He would
"Please, Bucky.  Please, just a little farther, take my hand--"
"It's just a scribble," Steve insisted and dropped the pad down on the desk before moving to grab the tray. Now it wasn't quite a
"Oh. Oh wow."
"But we're not SHIELD anymore."
! Do you think you can still be the same kind of role model for the omega community now you're in a trio with three Alphas?"
" asked Sam, eyes narrowing.
"You been acting weird ever since you got back Buck," Steve whispered. "Can't even feel you anymore, you know?  It doesn't matter. Probably for the best, right? You didn't really... I mean, shoot, this is what you always wanted." It wasn't a question; it was a statement. Steve had already made his mind up. He flicked his cigarette onto the ground. He could smoke now his lungs weren't made of shit but he never much liked the taste anyway. "I'll see you inside Buck," he said and then disappeared inside with a smile that didn't meet his eyes.
He yanked open the door of the car and leaned out to gag.  "Oh, fuck me... Maxwell's Equations, that hurts..." he gasped, spitting onto the pavement of the parking lot.  "S-sorry... I g-guess I'm still... getting over..."  He gagged again.  The headache that had flared up so suddenly was already ebbing, leaving Tony feeling worn out and shaky.  "...no one told me I'd have hangover flashbacks," he joked weakly, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes.  "What was I saying?  Right.  We're in this together."
He pushed those feelings aside.  He and Steve were bonded, and they were public about it, and that was that.  HYDRA was messing with his head somehow; maybe they'd found a way to hijack bonding to torture people psychologically; Barnes was dead, and there was no use worrying about him.
He fixed his hair in the mirror, neatening his appearance before heading into Tony’s room.  He arrived with coffee and set it down on the bedside table before reaching out to squeeze the man’s shoulder.  Tony had fallen asleep in his clothes.  His jacket was rumpled.  “Tony?  Time to get up.”
?  So he can kill more people with them?" He was looking at Tony.
Tony examined the scuff on the shoulder of the suit.  He didn't really remember flying it over.  But he'd definitely hit something on the way.  He sighed and ran a hand through his hair.  Eh... that was probably buff out, maybe.
"What's that?"
they could have those conversations. "Okay. You want to make your mate happy, sure, I get that...but what about yourself? You don't like fighting. You don't have to fight to be a good boyfriend." DeSoto seemed to find Steve's use of the term 'boyfriend' strange, frowning again. "If you don't want to fight, tell him and if
Who knew about Steve's other bond?  Pepper and Rhodey, who Tony trusted.  Fury, apparently, who Tony didn't trust one bit.  Natasha, who Tony felt threatened by and also found devastatingly attractive, which complicated matters.  Basically everyone at SHIELD.  Which Tony was trying to join.  Ugh.  Well... they were a super-secret spy agency, right?  They could keep a secret.  Maybe it would never leave SHIELD knowledge.  That wouldn't be so bad.
Steve smiled politely, saying nothing, but his eyes spoke volumes. There was something dangerous glinting behind blue eyes.  He was almost daring anyone to ask about life in his century.  No one did.
"How's it going?" Steve asked, taking the bench opposite her.
"I think Fury's been nice, considering. We don't have a good track record. I think he's pretty exasperated with me. Maybe I'm not worth quite all the effort he's gone to, to get me here."
"I'm fine with that.  I'm ready to get out of here.  This conference is creepy and weird."
Steve huffed in discomfort as Tony pulled out of him but he'd rather that small instant of pain than Gleason see him like this. Sure, he'd technically stuck up how fingers up Steve's ass but Steve would still prefer to retain some decency.
"He's
"Neither of them is blond; I'm blonde," replied Sixteen.
"Someone wanna tell me what's so funny?"
"We had a good day. It was relaxing. We made pizza and stuff," Steve said and felt bad for holding back about Clint's family. But it wasn't his secret to tell. Once they were closer maybe Clint and Natasha would tell him themselves; Steve hoped so at least. He didn't like the thought of keeping something like this from Tony forever.
"Yes, they are magnificent, aren't they?  The jewel of our military strength... the elite," said T'Chaka, a pleased looked on his face.  "A pity my wife has passed. She was a quick wit... you would have liked her very much, Captain.  She was among the Dora Milaje's best warriors... one of the greatest our country has ever known." He had a distant look of fondness.
"I'm sorry if you got the backlash from that," he said, and he meant it. Steve glanced over at the auctionees. "Do you think... do you think I could go talk to them? Or do you think I'm a no-go for them too?"
"...why don't you go have a girls' night out with Pep and Aria?" suggested Tony, desperate to get rid of her.  "I don't think me and Steve need five bodyguards in our own house, right?"
"We thought you might want to ring in the new year by making a Morgan sandwich," purred one at him.
"No, with a velociraptor," said Tony sarcastically.
"I think Steve's right, it would be good for the omegas there to hang out with him.  And listen. So the only way they'd let Steve in is with a collar, right?"
too real for my liking."
Steve was essentially bossed around for the next ten or fifteen minutes. But he was fine with following Tony's weird requests, lifting and bending what was too heavy and stiff for him. The man's hyperactiveness was infectious and Steve moved around quickly at Tony's word, biting back a fond chuckle when the man was so frustrated with Steve not knowing what a heat sink was. He had learned a lot at his time at Stark industries but none of it really had any bearing on engineering.
"I think you're giving him exactly what he needs right now, Darren," said Nadine gently.  "If he wants more from you, the important thing is that he knows he can ask." Darren nodded.
"I don't want to mate," was the first thing that came out of Steve's mouth. In about ten minutes he'd be pliant and probably wouldn't protest, his body would want it and his mind would accept that but right now he could still be stubborn. Right now Steve could still be mad at Tony. Mad at him for pinning him down on the floor for an hour as he bled and mad at him for saying he wanted to break their bond.
Right, realized Tony.  He'd missed the sixties.
He didn't move as the film suddenly jumped a few times, the projector slapping the reels together loudly.
"First of all, your money isn't liquid, Tony.  When you give money to the bank, it's not the same as storing it under a mattress.  Your money is tied up in the company and investments and bonds and savings... and frankly your suits.  Your entire workshop is a like a tire fire that you're tossing bills into.  Those Iron Man suits are a black hole for your liquid finances.  Which I remind you about every single quarter that we go over your expenses.  So, no, I can't just send you ten million dollars right this instant."
Aria took a long gulp of wine and leaned forward on her elbows. She nursed her glass carefully as he gaze fixed on a point on the wall behind Pepper. "Howard was very inappropriate with him. Handsy, that kind of thing. But then, so was the president," Aria snorted. "Omegas  weren't people back then. It was hardly surprising. And even with the serum, I don't think Howard got ever saw Steve as more than ‘just an omega.’ He tried to sleep with Steve a lot. He never did, though. Or at least, he said he didn't."
"Both her parents were omegas. She understands," Steve said quietly and his eyes flitted out to the kitchen briefly where he could hear Aria talking with Pepper.  Enhanced hearing and all that. He couldn't catch words, just their voices, but that was more than Coulson and Happy would be aware of. "What if… when we auctioned off all the flowers, we used that to create some kind of hostel where kids from camps could go to. I'm sure the problem for a lot of them is there's little alternative. If your parents sent you there then going back home wouldn't provide a solution."
A pause.
"When in doubt, talk about equal opportunities and education for the next generation," advised Tiberius.  "And remember, everyone getting up on that stage is on your side, okay?"
"I'm going to pretend I know what metal music is," Steve said, a half smile on his lips before he polished off a piece of garlic, licking the butter off off of his fingers.
"If you're not defying status roles while you're getting dinner then what's the point, right?" Steve said, a small smile on his lips. Pepper smiled back. Steve rubbed at the back of his neck. "Is that... what people are calling him, my primary Alpha?" he asked, not sounding happy about it.
"Giddy was an excellent Alpha."
"I mean...I'm not opposed to the idea. Maybe not in the same context as last time," Steve murmured and curled into Tony's touch, resting his cheek against the other's chest. The edge of the arc reactor was cold against his cheekbone but he didn't mind it much. It felt good to feel Tony's chest rising up and down and the steady beat of his heart underneath. Although it was slowly beginning to accelerate as he felt and heard Tony getting distressed. Steve just moved to curl his arms around him and whisper sweet nothings in his ear, stroking his mate's hair until he eventually drifted off to sleep.
Tony crossed the room to get another cup of coffee, but only filled it halfway.  He topped the rest off with vodka from the bar, then walked into the living room to tap DeSoto's shoulder.
"Perfect!  Much better!  Wish he could be this productive every day!  Must be your influence, Captain! See here, this is a
They charged up a flight of stairs, a stream of men jogging down in the opposite direction.  When they walked toward the right wing of Level 1, he suddenly realized where they were going.
"What about Jarvis?"
Steve looked over, a glint in his eyes. "Not very well."
Tony huffed (his breath came out in a puff of steam) and then he looked over to Steve.  "Welp. This is the first stop, Cartier. Then we've got Bulgari right after that." They were on Fifth Avenue, which Steve had last seen when he'd woken up.  A year unfrozen hadn't made it any less confusing or noisy or flashy. The crowd was thick and there were signs everywhere. But it didn't escape Steve's gaze that there were six strategically-placed, well-dressed men in a semi-circle around them.  Of course they weren't going anywhere without the detail; Tony's entourage had followed them from the hotel and was currently scanning around them, even though, in the hustle and bustle of the sidewalk, no one had immediately recognized either Tony or Steve.
The guard moved forward to wave a keycard at the cell door and unlock it.  He gestured for Bucky, who strode over and stepped into the cell obediently.  Steve ignored him; he was still glaring at the man in the suit.
And of course, there was the small matter of what had happened in Afghanistan, but Tony planned to take that particular secret to his grave.
But he wasn't thinking about evacuation.  He'd crossed the empty hanger in a split second, making for the woods that surrounded the bunker.
"No suits.  Got it," said Tony, imagining himself wearing cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.
"Good luck," Rhodey told him, only half joking.
"What?  No, sorry, I don't do sidekicks," said Tony.  "My shop is my sanctuary.  Only I'm allowed in there."  He paused, cocking his head.  "And my assistant, but I don't currently have one."
In the end Steve was dressed in yoga pants and a soft white tee, his usual yoga get-up; clothes that were conveniently designed to get a bit sweaty in. Downstairs they found Aria at a table; surprisingly enough Maria Hill was sat opposite her, sipping on an espresso. In the living room a film crew were milling around, setting up lighting and cameras. All of them betas.
"Oh, yes, very much," said Peggy without missing a beat.  "But he was funny, too, and quite a charmer."
Without thinking, he was reaching up, rubbing the scar on the back of his own neck.
think you would be able to behave yourself?  I don't. And would your Alpha ever allow such a thing?  ...actually, he might. He already let another Alpha take you, didn't he?"
Downstairs, one of the policemen was trying to get into Tony's shop.
? Now it was going to be
Steve slouched onto the bed with his sketchbook, his back against Tony's chest, his pad balanced on his left knee.  Tony set his diagrams on his right knee, his phone beside him on the bed; while Steve began doodling, Tony annotating his diagrams, scribbling crammed equations into the margins, his attention only half on the television, which was some British drama show that had a stunning woman involved in a love triangle with two men who were both Alphas.
Tony's grip on Steve's hand didn't loosen.  "He's
"Yeah, you won."
He lapsed into silence suddenly.
"I didn't hurt my omega," said Bucky, rising, glaring at them.  "I
you, Nick. You've ruined this relationship.  You've been lying to me since the day you unfroze me.  And you've been making
He slumped down, leaning his head against Tony's shoulder, the pose itself a startling reflection of the extent of his flexibility.
Tony moaned against Steve's skin at the words.  Alpha. Yes. That was him. He was Steve's Alpha.
The girl.
"Fuck!" Tony banked a hard left to avoid slamming into one of the monorail's support beams.  He was flying too low and too fast but he couldn't go up or he'd be wide open.  "I can't believe you were in business with Hammer, Rhodey, can't even fuckin' believe it--"
Tony blinked, trying to remember the conversation.  "Okay, first of all, my theory was
times?"
"You guys might need me.  I can shoot lasers out of my hands.  That's come in handy at least once," said Tony, rubbing the heel of his hand into his eye.  "You already know I don't read anything longer than two pages, though. So can you just give me the quick version of whatever the all the intelligence reports said?  Where are we going? How many people am I going to have to hand-laser, potentially?"
The question sounded strange in the past tense.  If you were bonded, you were bonded.  End of story.  They made it sound like you could just turn a bond off and everyone know that was impossible.  Only the worst of the worst Alphas would ever sever a bond, and omegas couldn't.  Bonds generally only disappeared in death.
Enjoy!  - Tony aka Apollo
"So Luke...?" asked Tony.
Tony was outside.  He leaned over the balcony, the pool glowing behind him, trying not to look at the several party guests that had gotten naked and jumped in.  He was smoking a cigar, staring out at the ocean. It was a clear night; he could see the lights from Santa Monica pier, the Ferris wheel and the neon lights...
One of the technicians looked up.  "How many times do we have to tell you people
"JAMES, MOVE!"
reputation."
"Dr. Brazinski is the head of SHIELD's psychology department," said JARVIS.
'Plan B' consisted of black slacks, a dark red shirt and a dark grey waistcoat. The tie was black and plain to match but the left breast pocket of the waistcoat had Santa's cartoon head peaking out of it. It was cute. For Aria, at least. "There you go," Steve told him with a bemused smile and leaned down to kiss his cheek before pulling away to get dressed himself.
He found himself wishing there were a bar on board.
Then he dropped the mic and ran after his friends.
For a brief moment he was seated in the cell, the cage,, the blood hot as it trickled down his neck. A thin streak of it made its way to the drain in the center of the cell, the floor tilted downwards...
"...I think you did the right thing and I'm 100% on your side..." Natasha continued on the other line.  "...but you can't burn bridges with the agency, Steve, SHIELD needs you, right now they're all doing damage control, but I talked to Fury myself and I think he's willing to work with you--"
But Bucky must think he was dead, if Bucky was alive.  Assuming Bucky, at his age, was even still mentally fit.  Who knew?
The only thing Steve couldn't help but notice was he distinct lack of Howard. Maria featured more than her husband but even then, in his younger years it was apparent that Jarvis, Ana and Peggy were around more than anyone else.
Fortunately, Tony didn't wait to be asked.
He put the sketch book down slowly and swallowed. "Please just promise me you won't hate me not matter what you see?"  Steve whispered, gaze drifting away to the bed sheets.
Tony pulled his goggles off and tossed them aside with annoyance.  "That's kind of the problem, Steve... it's not going anywhere," he grumbled.  But he knew Steve wanted to go to Banksy's party and that he could work on the suit later.
Aria stood up straight, a little shakily. "Are... are
Over Steve's shoulder, the little model building was wobbling out of orbit around the shield prototype.  Its movement in the otherwise still shop was distracting.  It finally came to a rest.
"Yeah?  ...your buddy Rhodes is with the Undersecretary of Defense right now, trying to keep them from stripping all four of us of our citizenship and shipping us to Guantanamo."
got to decide, huh? What kind of goddamn play was this?
Steve was a man of action; he wasn't good at the long game. He didn't want to wait. He wanted to make it up to Tony
Bucky had a lot of complex thoughts and he was having difficulty sifting them into anything resembling a coherent thought.  He knew that he didn't want to go on a killing rampage and he also knew he didn't want Steve to be in an unsafe place.
"You won't take it off," he repeated.  "...brat.  Fine.  C'mere, then."  He jerked his head to the couch and finally sat up, patting the seat behind him.
"--maybe we can-- just talk about it later," mumbled Tony finally.  Briefly, he felt annoyed at that shitty doctor in Tijuana who had snipped him the first time and apparently not done it correctly.  He wondered if he could go get a refund after twenty years.
Clippings  Blueprints.  Film reels.  Loose papers.  Tony laughed without a trace of humor as he opened the first lab notebook; it was completely unreadable, its pages rippled with water damage, its ink smeared, running illegibly off the pages.  "Oh, great... just great... this one's ruined.  Well, we're off to a good start."  He sniffed the lab notebook experimentally and threw it down in disgust.  Whiskey.
A gun that Carter and the other agent were fighting over went on and a bulb above their heads shattered.
The place was perfect. It was small enough so that they wouldn't be recognised easily and looked family run going by the lights outside. Steve took Tony's hand once their helmets and hair were off and fixed and let his alpha lead him through to the courtyard out the back.
He slipped his arm around Steve's waist again.  The only thing Tony really found comforting was the knowledge that Steve could tear a regular person limb from limb.  He wasn't small, or weak, or sick; Steve was capable of handling himself. With his shield, he was deadly. That was a small comfort, at least.
"You're all done," said Tony lovingly, running a hand down Steve's jaw tenderly.  "Italian now?"
"I'm terribly sorry, sirs, but the phone call is urgent," said JARVIS.
"Lovely," said Tony, unconcerned.  "PEPPER!" he yelled suddenly. "WE GOT FIREWORKS, RIGHT?"
Then Steve's eyes rolled back in his head.
Tony ran a hand down his back shakily.  "There's semen on my face," he stated, voice cracking slightly.  He cleared his throat, then added, "...that was... really good, Steve."  He laughed quietly and reached up to wipe Steve's cum from his beard. God, if anyone had told him a year ago he would think this was normal, he would have thought they were insane.
Thanks for joining us for part 1!
It made the woman laugh. Steve hoped he got the point across.
Ty looked up at him, something fierce in his eyes. "Indeed."
Natasha snorted a little.  "Are you joking?  I didn't realize you were such a romantic, Stark.  How many orchids have you gotten so far?"
"Supposed to be having-" He fumbled around and found a first aid kit beneath one of the seats. Adrenaline, awesome.
"Wonderful. So unless Mr. Stark has any queries...?" Hawley glanced sideways at Tony. "Then we can remove the monitors."
Donner let out another pained groan.
"Because I care about you, and I care about Steve!"
It was one omega out of sixteen hundred, but Steve still felt like a failure. They'd saved so many kids today. But he couldn't save Donner, his own goddamn cousin, from just one man. He was physically shaking with anger and there was a tightness in his chest, like he almost couldn't breathe. Steve leaned against a tree heavily for support. The bark felt rough under his fingertips. He belatedly noticed he had red knuckles from when he'd punched through the wall, the odd splinter sticking out of his skin. He hadn't even noticed the pain before but know it felt like it was burning. Steve's eyes watered. "You're a monster," he seethed.
," said Tony.  He took a step toward Steve and pointed.  "You have no right to be mad at me.
According to Natasha, Steve had been out of the country for most of the last two months, unlike Tony, who had been holed up in his lodge in Colorado.  He had finally worked up the courage, only a week ago, to check the press about him and Steve.
"I don't expect you to know the answer immediately.  I would like you to think it over."
Eric beamed at being remembered.
Tony was panting, growling, occasionally found himself holding his breath and almost forgetting to breathe; he shuddered on top of Steve, cumming all over again, all the while listening to Steve's whines and the sound of his name and the persistent, shrill, beeping alarm from Steve's phone on the ground.
Tony looked up finally.  "My dad was on that show.  The Boswell Mackabee Variety Hour."
"Right," Steve said. Lila began poking his neck with the dinosaur toy. It didn't hurt, so he didn't comment on it. But it wasn't great having some random child poking at the fresh scar. He couldn't help but feel uncomfortable.
"Juice?  So that's what they're calling it nowadays?" Steve replied, sounding amused as he cracked one eye open to look over at Tony.
He didn't know the other two agents behind the director. They looked a little wary of him in all honesty. When Steve caught Phil's gaze in return he offered him a small smile. It was good to see him.
he'd felt truly uninhibited and happy; he was like a puppy rolling in the mud, carefree and unashamed.
The two guards looked at Tony, then looked at Steve.  One of them was edging back, looking like he very much regretted coming here in the first place.  Tony raised his palms and both dropped from a single shot. He was paying zero attention to the man crawling away down the hall; his attention was focused solely on Steve; he dropped down to his knees and grabbed his wrists and buried his face into the back of his neck, smelling him.  He was so aroused it was painful; the suit was helping, he hadn't exactly designed it with erections in mind.
"Squirrel suit.  Got it. Yes, sir," said Tony, repeating the curtsy before swaggering off, whistling, like this was all a big joke.
"Hi, Steve!" called Tony, patting the barstool next to him and ignoring Sam's question.  "Man, I feel way better, a couple of drinks was just what the doctor ordered.  I can't believe how weird that was.  ...I bet they use salvinorin, I bet you anything that's how they do it.  What were you guys arguing about?"
"Just hold on, okay, Donnie?  Gimme two minutes."
Steve almost flinched at her words and watched her saunter out of the door with wide eyes. He really didn't know what to say to that.  But he had more important things to handle.  Like terminating the party before it turned dangerous.
"...maybe after breakfast we could just run down the block... get a bottle of scotch or something?" he ventured hesitantly, aware that asking at this time in the morning probably made it look like he had a problem.
"Well, he hasn't treated you in an excellent manner, has he?"
Gideon laughed again.
"Mr. Stark has joined line 1," JARVIS informed them.
Even though they'd dismissed the call, it bugged Tony.  He liked knowing things, hated being out of the loop.  He was pretty sure it had to be about the Expo, something he really didn't want to handle for at least a week.  Hadn't SHIELD said they'd taken over the investigation?  Tony would call Pepper later, have her prep a statement for him.  Right now Tony didn't want to relive the Expo; he was actively working to forget about it.  Seeing Steve in danger had been one of the worst experiences of his life.  Right now, he just wanted to focus on this, on their bodies slotted together like puzzle pieces, on the ride and fall of Steve's back as he breathed, his breath syncing automatically with Tony's.
"We're going to the base hospital," said Natasha.  "...Steve... I wish you'd called me. Instead of Sitwell.  You know I would have answered. You know I would've come."
Karpov waved at him irritably.  "--do you have any idea what I've been dealing with these last few weeks?" he hissed into the phone.  A beach ball rolled past him. "And now you're telling me
Piper showed up with two drinks; she offered one to Eric and one to Tony.  Red wine. Tony sipped; it was a Merlot with a dry finish. Not bad.
"--because that's me and Pepper's traditional and it's Christmas Eve.  If we leave by noon and speed like crazy we can get there before four, maybe even by three."
"Oh my God, it's so pretty!" gasped Taylor, eyeing the drink.  It was opaque and bright blue and smelled like the strangest mixture of chocolate, wine, and something fruity.  Underlying all that, of course, was the smell of alcohol.
"  Natasha sounded absolutely murderous.
He checked his watch surreptitiously.  It was still midday; in the McLaren, they could make it to the base in a couple of hours, assuming no traffic.  Tony hadn't actually felt especially nervous until now.  Now, he was wondering just how bad it would be.  He wished he could have one more drink, just to take the edge off.  Steve seemed to think that would make things worse, but as far as Tony was concerned, it could only help him to relax.
"Hi," said Tony.  "...you here to serve me a subpoena?"
"Welp!  I've got a lot of work to do.  Rhodey, I'll see you at that award ceremony, if you can get Stern.  George, are you on Donner-duty?"
Pietro stood wordlessly and walked out, his face blank but his eyes stormy beneath the surface. Steve swallowed as he watched the omega go. He'd said the wrong thing, maybe. Steve sighed and leaned against Bucky.
Tony's mouth twitched; he sidled up to Steve and put a hand on his shoulder, feeling a strange sense of pride in him.
Maria had promptly trashed the entire experiment and yelled profusely at Lupita and Aaliyah for letting Tony keep open bowls of battery acid in his room, while Tony had yelled in the background, furious at his mother for dumping out his precious teeth, which, he was sure, were hours away from degradation.  Alas, he would never know, because the rest of his teeth were either swallowed or confiscated by overbearing nannies who'd been scolded earlier by his mother.
Malick's eyes narrowed.  "...what the hell do you think you're doing?"
He wasn't sure where the hell "fucking omega slut" had come from but in the moment it was incredibly, over-the-top sexy to him.
"Have you left the lodge at all since..."  Rhodey paused. "...January first?"
Tony found George's utter lack of politeness and offensive sense of humor refreshing; several people in the room looked upset, though, so he decided to switch the topic back to that great unifier of people, pizza.  "So... lunch. Ian needs his gluten fix," he said.
"I don't think it works like--"
Had kneeling for him and buying collars not been enough of an ego boost? Steve frowned. What was he supposed to do? He wasn't good at this. He wasn't sexy (appearance not included).  Or rather he was good at
Steve leaned his head on his shoulder. It was comfortable like this and he almost missed having a partner that was taller than him. With Tony he had to half curl in on himself, or slide down to put his head on his shoulder. This was comfortable, or would be, if he wasn't starving and locked up.
"In a house this big, they could be anywhere."
"Maybe we should use a condom, if we do that again," Steve mumbled into a pillow. "Surely tricking my body like that ups the chances? I dunno, should check with Gleason..."
Happy slammed the brakes.  The car behind them swerved and blared their horn, narrowly missing them.  Every bodyguard in the car was already reaching for their hip holsters.
Gideon wasn't even looking at him anymore. Steve was thoroughly amused, although ginger couldn't stop staring. Maybe he was a fanboy before Steve's true status was revealed.
"...hey, you still want that coffee?" yelled down Clint suddenly, breaking the silence.
"...that's the most disgusting thing you've ever said," said Pepper softly.
"Oui, oui," said Tony gliby.
"...you know she knows we fuck, right?" asked Tony, rocking against Steve's body.  He leaned down to murmur in Steve's ear. "You know I could never love her like I love you, right?  You know you're the only omega in the world for me, and I love you?" He nipped Steve's earlobe. In his hand, Steve's shaft had gotten hard; Tony could feel it throbbing.
Sam offered Steve a weak smile.
"I mean, I don't know much about them. Like the suppressants stuff. No one's ever even mentioned it to me. And unless people do I just have no idea," Steve tried to explain. Omega problems didn't make into national headlines very often, especially before he came out.
It was awkward. They were both teary, for different reasons, and Steve had to wiggle where he was half squished by Tony. But he managed to hold Donner's hand from the back seat. The omega's fingers felt sweaty and shaky. "It's o-okay Donner, m'not going anywhere."
the genius.  Meditation, compartmentalization... there are tricks.  You can cheat at any test.  You've got a week to prepare."
"I don't know what a Möbius strip is..." Steve admitted in a murmur, fingers trailing down the muscle of Tony's forearm. He watched his Alpha staring into the distance and frowned a little. How could Tony be so close but sometimes feel so far away?
"Doesn't Steve know how far Washington DC is?" he grumbled.  He and Charlie were sharing an egg salad sandwich on the steps leading up to his private jet.  They'd been hanging out just outside the hangar for thirty minutes.
Besides, what good were words?  His smell was probably communicating what words couldn't, anyway.  Hurt.  Betrayal.  A disloyal omega was easily the most insulting, emasculating, derogatory, embarrassing thing that could happen to an Alpha.  Tony felt like he had in Afghanistan. Suddenly, he was back in that cave, with Raza holding his wrists, pinning him down; Steve's smell, once familiar and pleasant and safe and warm, was suddenly threatening.  It reminded Tony of the smell of gunpowder and cigars and a damp cave and sex and fear and burning flesh.
"A girl," repeated Donner, as Richard handed him the gooey mess.  Her umbilical cord was still trailing; Tony was actively gagging over Steve's shoulder.  "A... a little girl. A girl!" He looked around the room, beaming, eyes watering. "I-- I have a baby!  A girl! A baby girl!" he exclaimed.  "A... beta?  She's a beta!  A girl!"
Steve froze as Tony spoke, Bucky's voice numbing his brain. Because no, they hadn't asked Bucky to
Surely he was only paranoid because Danielle and Banksy had scared him a little.  He and Tony had been bonded for seven months and they were doing okay, right?  Banksy and Danielle had only just met him and they couldn't possibly understand.
The door was still open and the sound of music and chatter and laughter was almost overwhelming.
...he really needed to stop letting Clint try to help educate him.
"Nope."
He and Gene shared a warm handshake and then Rhodey was off to the Triumph.  So far, so good.
Tony grabbed her hips and flipped her around, nosing her hair (smelled wrong), running his hands over her curves.  She let out a breathy little moan and Tony fought the urge to tell her to shut up.
"Are you going to bet Piper?" asked Tony, his tone one of deliberate neutrality.
Kate, not a nurse, had told Steve he could go whenever he liked, as long as he took care of himself.  They had dressed the bullet wound on his leg; fortunately, the slug had exited on its own.  They had cleaned him up as best they could but the doctor had explained that he would be bleeding and spotting for probably another day or two.  The bullet wound on his leg was neatly dressed and Steve understood the spotting she was talking about wouldn't be coming from that.
Steve shuddered underneath him as Tony's wet and hot mouth dragged over the curve of his neck. He couldn't help it. It was an instinctual reaction. He wanted to squirm underneath him, whine to encourage Tony to suck at his neck more...but he didn't. He resisted. This was just cuddling.
"Steve left, Steve's old Alpha, Bucky, he's here, he's close, he's coming for Steve, he said so, I gotta find Steve--"
- Tony (aka Apollo)
He woke up early, with a headache, feeling ill and shaky.  The whole night before felt like a bad dream, except that the heavy metal suitcase was still on the floor at the end of their bed.
. Steve would totally be himself. "You don't have a little, you have
"Hey. Hey it's okay. I know you're sorry. It's okay Tony I promise," Steve said in a mantra of words and moved to pick him up in one easy movement. He carried him into the bedroom and set Tony down on the bed before going to fetch a towel and wrap around him. Steve curled the towel around his shoulders, putting himself in front of Tony's distant gaze so he could see him. He was still wet himself but it didn't matter as he wrapped his hands around Tony and rocked him gently.
Clint said nothing.
"And I'm lucky too. I didn't even realise that's what you were... I just remember not wanting to leave. Even when you were pissed at me and you were dying, I didn't want to leave your side." Steve remembered being drawn to him. He'd blamed it on Tony's charm and charisma at the time, but he guessed it had been more than that.
Steve moved to dry his hair, then the rest of himself before pulling on comfortable clothes as he spoke. "How's Clint doing?"
"...thanks for being so understanding with us," said Tony suddenly, looking up, unusually appreciative on Steve's behalf.
"Yes," said Piper.  Tony looked at her wrist; she had on several bracelets made of braided embroidery thread, like something a kid would make at summer camp.
"Yeah, I guess," said Tony with a shrug.  As good as things would ever be, he figured.  "...he got me flowers," he added, nodding toward the roses on the table.
"It was nothing to do with you," Steve assured him, a smile tugging at his lips. "And I'm not currently speaking to SHIELD right now," he added and sighed. "I found two bugs in my apartment last night after you fell asleep. One was in my
Steve's eyes had been closed. He hadn't really been trying to sleep but he'd figured just resting would be nice. And if he didn't at least look like he was sleeping then Tony was unlikely too. But then the other asked a question and Steve's eyes fluttered open again.
The shop was the only truly personal space to him; now that the shop was safe, he left the team of police to their work and went upstairs.  He had a pretty good idea of where Steve was.
"--but he's dead.  He's dead, isn't he?" pressed Tony.  He was avoiding looking at Steve.  Oh, God, it hurt; the memory of he and Bucky with their forehead pressed together, smiling at each other before the war...Tony had barely come to terms with the fact that his omega was previously bonded and now he'd seen inside his old Alpha's head, and it was terrible, knowing that Bucky had, in his own way, loved Steve.  It made Tony feel sick to his stomach.  He was beginning to develop something of a vendetta against tulips.
is about electronics, not for people suffering mania," replied Phil.  He peered down the hole, pushing a cable aside.  "No, there's no magazines up here.  Can we come down?"
A twinge of anxiety flared up in Tony.  He had felt so blissful, so at peace.  But now he remembered.  He wasn't the only one to lay claim to this omega.
He wanted to believe what Steve had said, about how he was good person, if not a good Alpha.  But he was well-aware that might have been some sort of manipulation tactic.
before the door closed behind him. He had no phone (his was dead, anyway). Nothing on him. He just knew he had to get out, or get to Bucky, or-- what was he thinking?
Steve's breath hitched and he froze as Bucky nuzzled into the back of his neck.
Tony threw back the rest of his drink.  He was unused to making Captainesque speeches, or to being serious for more than a few minutes at a time, so he added, "I mean, obviously, if you wanna kneel and wear a collar in the bedroom, be my guest, that's hot as hell, but y'know, don't kneel 'cause anyone tells you to."
"See?" said Tony, gesturing with a grin.  "No, wait!  I think the phrase is...
"No.  Leave him," said the director.  "Frankly, I don't care whether or not we can reset him or how unpredictable he gets.  Project Guiding Star is over; the Winter Soldier project has Captain America now; the only real purpose the asset serves is for breeding.  Lucky stud." He chuckled a little before growing serious. "Perhaps we could have him come here, have him order the asset to bite over Stark's mark.  Does that work? Can you just replace it? If that doesn't work then I suppose we'll just have to let the witch after him. I'm sure she can handle Stark on her own.  She'd been begging to get her hands on him for years, anyway."
Tony sighed.  "Never mind. Thanks for putting up with my nerd shit, Steve.  I love you even if you
Twice, they doubled back to avoid guards.
Tony was already gone.  Finally, he’d made it to Pepper.
Happy prompted blew through a red light on accident.  Tony looked absolutely scandalized.
Donner let out an unearthly shriek.  "
"How long's it gonna take?"
apologise?"
Bucky ran his tongue over the new mark; it looked much better.
"The bike sounds good," Steve said and perked up noticeably at that. "You wanna ride?" he offered tentatively, knowing Tony had expected to last time.
"I thought you said everyone was real supportive of Steve," said Tony grimly, staring down at the crowd in the street, mixed with police, who were trying and failing to control downtown traffic.
"Tell 'em to suck a dick," said Tony.  He was sitting cross-legged on his bed, a little pinball game in his hands.  Under the plastic there was a maze with three balls in it and the goal was to get all three into little slots at the same time.  Tony could get two but right when he got the third, one would roll out. He'd been at it for hours.
"Yes, yes, of course." Phil hesitated. "I... Nick just wanted to say, he's sorry."
Tony swung out of bed and hurried into the main room, excited to know when Steve had found the time to let someone paint an American flag on his perfect stomach.
A memory rose to his mind suddenly: back when he was still young, in his twenties, full of vim, Obadiah had insisted on his gelling down his hair.  It was the early nineties and it was fashionable, but, more importantly, Tony was, as Obie put it, "young, dumb, and full of cum," and his dander would often rise in board meetings.  Obie was of the opinion that Tony ought to have control of that by now, similar to facial expressions, but Tony honestly couldn't help it no more than he could help how expressive his face was.  He'd grown his beard because Obadiah had told him to and invested heavily in hair gel because Obadiah had told him to, and now, decades later, he still maintained his facial hair and styled his hair carefully, even though he'd long since learned to control the rise of the hair on the back of his neck and most of his facial expressions.
"Seven point eight!" Tony would yell back.  Someone would plug it into a calculator to confirm he got it right, but he always did, and then they'd all cheer and hand him a shot.  Rhodey had dragged him away after finding him vomiting outside.
"So... Fury, right?  I love that name, it's a very cool name... sorry, do I look at the eye or...?  If you could, uh, turn your head so that I didn't have to look at the patch... I'm honestly going cross-eyed... I'm really hungover, I had a birthday party last night... you weren't invited, is that what this is about?  ...are you going to introduce me to Dark Angel and this guy... he looks like he's DEA or something, is this because I smoked some pot in college?  'Cause I'm not gonna apologize for that."  Tony glared at all of them.
The dog walked over to Steve, having finished licking the floor, and set his chin on Steve's knee, looking up at him lovingly, clearly hoping for more toast.
Sam flexed his fingers. "Sprained, maybe but not broken. Thanks... I think."
In the end they'd only sent one guy with a gun.
"...maybe.... maybe I can just go visit him?" suggest Donner hopefully, delicately, trying to compromise.  "Maybe I could just go with him for dinner or... or one night...?"
"No," Steve whispered. "There was nothing."
Tony laughed softly at the sound of his name.  "Steve," he murmured back, drawing out the long "e," wiggling his hips into the other's.  Steve's arms and legs were tangled around him, drawing him in, and he could feel his body tensing, toes and fingers curling with pleasure.  It was hard to tell where, exactly, he ended and Steve began, but that didn't matter.  Steve's body was warm and wet and tight, but his fingers in Tony's hair were soft and sweet and gentle.
the Alpha you're pair-bonded to."
Aria and Pepper had gotten to the gala early to get everything sorted. Steve and Tony were actually due to arrive about ten minutes after everyone else so they could have a 'proper' entrance. It didn't really sound like it was Steve's thing but it was for charity and with Project 84 due in about a month, they needed all the help they could get.
"...because I wasn't dominant enough.  ...fortunately, if you look at the math, you'll see that, in the grand scheme of things, it no longer matters.  Seventeen hundred women. Three men. Ratio-wise we're talking a tenth of a percent, and every woman means that ratio gets closer and closer to zero.  Mathematically, I can wipe it out. I can fix it. Obviously, being with Steve, I'm currently in a lull, but I think, after behaving myself for over half a year, I've earned a couple of flings."
"It's okay, Steve, we got this..."
"Least everyone won't think I'm pregnant anymore," he sighed and leaned back against the sofa, Steve's head on Tony's shoulder. He finished the fourth piece and sucked he tomato sauce from his fingertips. "How was your day?"
When he'd had semi-heats in the forties he'd had to look after himself. Those had been some of the most frustrating days of his life, where all he had for relief was his fingers and Vaseline. Steve didn't miss it, certainly not now when he knew just how good it could be. And it was good, so fucking good...
"I need to talk to him and Pepper.  Probably more Pepper than him. You guys aren't cleared for the party you're planning, Captain," said Rhodey.  "Not considering the... situation."
"I don't have the key," said Tony glibly, which was true.  Steve did.
"...ah, first week of December, last week of November, thereabouts.  Is this your first pregnancy?"
"You're almost as smart as you are entitled," said Clint.
"There you go again.  Being Captain America instead of Steve..." she said, rolling her eyes.  She gave his tie a tug and pulled him forward; their lips brushed.
"How's the neck?" he asked bluntly and Steve's smile didn't falter.
Tiberius's hand was warm on his arm and Steve smiled a little. "A little nervous, but I'll be fine once I get out there." Once the adrenaline rush hit him Steve was usually good at thinking on his feet, at least. "So, am I just answering questions or...?"
Tony leaned on the railing overlooking the ocean, watching the distant freighters on the horizon slog slowly past, little bright specks of light in the otherwise dark sea.  The waves crashed far below them. Steve swiped at his face and looked away.
," snapped Pepper.  She checked her watch.  "We've been here less than an hour!"  She and Aria both went to fix Steve's tie at the same time.  Tony slumped in the doorway, the bass pounding behind him in the main room.
"Who's gonna see?" demanded Tony, gesturing.  "I live in the middle of nowhere, we're completely isolated... and it's not like either of us have anything to be ashamed of... Steve looks like a Greek god and I'm pulling my weight... what, you think people don't already know we've got dicks and hang out naked together, we're
After more fussing Steve had Tony tucked up into bed. "I'm going to go out for a run, when I get back I'll wake you up and we'll get ready, unless...." Steve remembered Tony binge drinking because of the damage done in Wakanda by Stark weaponry and hesitated. "If I stay will it help you sleep? Because then I'll stay."
"I-- yes, Alphas get aggressive during their mate's heats," said Pepper, sitting up groggily.  "You already knew that, Tony."
"Cool," said Tony, sarcastically.
Pietro glanced into the mirror above the sink.  There was no denying he looked a little flushed.  He looked back to Wanda. "...what do we do?"
Pietro let out an ear-splitting scream and suddenly the pure white was splattered with crimson.
“They’re thinking of taking your company off you, Mr. Stark,” Steve stressed, something Tony already knew.  “You need to get up there.  And, for the record, I don’t really need a nickname.”
He cried out as Tony's tongue moved back up to tease at his balls and cock.  Steve's body tensed impossibly and then jerked.  Steve came, his knuckles white against the sheets. It was bordering on painful, the white hot searing rush of relief that tore through him. He gasped and squirmed, whimpering in pleasure and panting as he came down.
than Steve... someone like Piper... where would I go?  I mean, surely you get to check out the goods before they auction them off, right?" asked Tony.
That's what it boiled down to, really.  Tony was entitled and always had been. His station, status, everything about him put him in a position where he got what he wanted, when he wanted.  Steve had been challenging that notion a lot lately. Actually, almost constantly. Steve had put a damper on his drinking and his partying and Tony hadn't slept with a woman since May.
Steve disappeared and returned with the pizza. He set the box by the poolside hopefully. He had gotten Tony's favourite: pepperonis and peppers
Dr. Gleason withdrew his fingers and stripped off his gloves.  He looked at Tony, waiting.
He was feeling more confused than normal.
"Oh my God," said Morgan as they pulled up the long drive and stopped at the circular entrance.  There was still broken glass on the ground, still a shattered window and a crumbled interior wall and some overturned furniture.
triples."
"I'll explain later."
The crowd cheered and dozens of camera flashes went off.
"I don't know," he said.
"Thank you," said Bucky, who had no idea what she was talking about.
Tony had crawled into Steve's lap and wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and was nosing around his jaw, nipping and murmuring little love phrases to him, his heat irresistible.  Having been sated with the fruit, he was now entirely focused on Steve again.
George sat upright and banged his fist on the desk; several people in the office jumped.  "
"Except Canada and England."
to be equals, they just want an Alpha to take care of them and yeah, okay, maybe their Alpha happens to marry a beta or whatever but it doesn't mean you like your omega any less, right?  I mean, Dad loved Jarvis to death, but he had Mom, too, and..."  Tony paused.  Steve looked seconds away from throwing a punch at Tony and, for the first time in his life, Tony actually felt scared of an omega.  Even worse, Steve's eyes looked
"You're still my mate.  I still care about you," he said quietly.  He leaned forward and nuzzled Steve's nose.  "...sometimes I need space. Sometimes I need time to process.  Seeing you... like that. It was hard. But I'll always get over it.  I'm good at getting over stuff. I just need space sometimes. ...you get that, right?"
He replied to Peggy's text as the car started up and got them out of the studio's grounds. He was so excited to have some form of contact with her his hands were practically shaking. Her approval meant so much to him.
Those two words earned him a retraining session.  By the end of it, his brain was static, electricity having swept away the remains of the ashes of those words, and even if he could have remembered them, he wouldn't have dared uttered them again.  They sat him on his cot and he didn't move, eyes unfocused, once again unburdened by emotions, feelings of arousal, memories, or fog-drawings of wings.
"Do you like it?" pressed Tony, clearly desperate for Steve's approval.
"You just ruined offers for me," Steve complained and nipped lightly at the fingers that stretched out to him before diving back under.
"Phil Collins was a singer.  He wrote
"Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?  You want me to read you one of those letters? You want the rest of my strawberries?  Pepper never puts strawberries on waffles for some reason. Dunno why." Tony looked anxiously at Steve, but Steve seemed distracted, lost in thought.
Across the room, a small crowd of men in suits and women in evening gowns had gathered around two omegas that they'd instructed to fight; one was thoroughly thrashing the other, ruthlessly throttling the man he'd been standing by pleasantly only moments earlier.  The man with his hands around the other's throat was looking up for instructions, looking hopelessly torn between obeying and not killing his maybe-friend.
Pepper's grip on his arm loosened a fraction and she gave him a sad smile as if to say
Natasha pitched a snowball at Cooper that missed and came dangerously close to hitting Clint.
"Hello again, Stark."
"Mm-hm.  Got bonded one year before they outlawed it, and he cried through the entire bonding ceremony.  'Course they don't have ceremonies anymore, thank God, what a lot of stupid pageantry and work--"
"When you say inside me," he murmured. "You mean in my mouth or
. This Steve hadn't anticipated or ever expected.
"I know we made a mess of things-- we both did, in our own ways." Steve slumped against the countertop in his kitchen and slowly slid down till he was sitting on the floor. "But I wouldn't mind... trying to figure out things together. You made me feel a lot of things," he admitted quietly. "I always thought the idea of submitting to an Alpha was awful.  But with you it’s... the opposite.  It feels... I dunno..."
From the bedroom, Tony heard the word "auction."
Steve walked over to where the chain was attached to the wall. He couldn't break metal but he could break the wood it was attached to.
...this really
As they spoke a man stepped forward. He was a beta but his body language was almost timid. From his appearance and demeanor he could be mistaken for an omega. He was in baggy jeans and a flannel shirt and he had a small but friendly smile. "Louis, I assume?" Maria said, getting off her chair to shake his hand.  "I hope you understand SHIELD being here. Of course, you'll have to sign confidentiality agreements.  Steve, say hello."
, Steve, but it doesn't affect how I'm going to approach working with you.  Seriously, Steve. This is a big deal, sure, but also not my business. I think coming out with it as soon as possible is sensible, personally. Scarves really don't suit you."
"Sometimes it is," Barb disagreed gently. "And no one else is doing it. No one of us would be here without you, Captain. Even if we only save a handful of children out of this, it would be worth it. But we're going to save hundreds of them from that camp tomorrow. And all because you cared enough to do something about it. So," she placed a hand on his arm. "Thank you."
He took the syringes and threw them against the glass. They shattered and fell to the floor in pieces. Steve noted, with disappointment, that the plastic was not sharp enough to be used as a weapon.  One of the scientists sighed and reached into her bag to get out more; they'd evidently anticipated this particular issue.
Steve coming out had been an utter shock to everyone.
It was such a simple question.  No one had ever asked him that before.  Yet he didn't known the answer.  He felt confused and upset that he didn't.  Was he?  At times he'd almost felt like he and Karpov were pair-bonded.  They were, after all, inseparable.  Karpov had been his handler for as long as he could remember.  But they were both Alphas.
"I'm going to be a paleontologist when I grow up," said Cooper.  He considered for a moment, then added, "Or maybe a fireman. I don't know yet.  Maybe I can be a fireman on weekends. Anyways, these are my Pokemon cards." Steve was suddenly handed a binder.  Lila had commandeered the plastic dinosaur and was gnawing on its head, drooling copiously down her dress and Steve's shirt.
As a child, his father had been too busy to worry much about his son, and as he got older, his mother had grown distant, too.  She and Tony had grown apart; he resented her for putting up with his father's alcoholism and she spent more and more time involved with charity work, probably trying to steer clear of Howard, who was unpredictable when drunk.  Jarvis and Obadiah had worried about him in their own way but they seemed to share the opinion of Howard: that Tony was best left to his own devices.  Besides, Obadiah was more worried about the business and Jarvis was more worried about Howard.  The only other people who had cared for him in childhood were paid to care; Tony had had two extremely worn-out nannies whose sole purpose was to wrangle him away from electronics.  (They were only partially successful; anything with circuits was like a siren's song to Tony, and he took apart dozens of appliances as a child, which inevitably caused Howard migraines and ended in a massive family fight.)
"What?
them were very different things, and he didn't want to alienate himself from the Horseshoe Society entirely. But then he also wasn't really sure he was their style, being a soldier and all that. But then, Steve liked Danielle too...maybe he was biased. "But I'd need to talk to Aria about it. She has all my dates down, and everything."
Steve and Tony sat respectfully through the usual prayers and quiet memories.  It wasn't until the priest invited Boswell's mate to say some words that things got interesting.
"I don't know."
Piper nodded and then she rushed away.
Steve sent Tony a bemused look. "That's... nice of them."
"Go kick ass kid," Steve told him before James/Doug headed out through the door. Whatever his name, he was one of the omegas of the future Steve was investing his trust in.  And it was people like Doug that made him feel at least a little less nervous about the press conference and performance in the morning.
Bucky growled.
But right now, at least, the prospect of sobriety paled in comparison to the immediate need to mate Steve again.
"It means it's classified, Rogers. I need you to trust me."
"I'm glad I'm home," Steve murmured, blushing and looking away when he realised he was staring.
Tony was still trying not to choke on his drink, still trying to grasp this new information.  The file had probably mentioned they were an arranged bond and he was kicking himself now for not reading it.
"Meddling kid," mumbled Tony under his breath.  He didn't want to talk to Steve. He wanted to get drunk and black out watching
Tony's hackles had risen.  ".
"It just looks like a big splatter of ink.  I'm sorry, I'm really not the creative type."
"Can I take your picture?  No one will believe I met you."
Then again, he hadn't been able to picture Steve shirtless with an America flag painted across his abs, and he'd seen
Banksy nodded sombrely. "But you don't owe them any details Steve. Or any explanations, remember that."
Steve could hear bird song as he closed his eyes and floated on his back. It was pleasant, serene and he felt better already. The echo of Bucky's thoughts in his head distant and no longer so unnerving. He let his eyes slip and heard Tony pad off into the house, smirking a little when he felt a little twinge of arousal in his own belly. But it wasn't his own. It was almost cute... how polite Tony was being about it.
Tony pulled Steve to him happily, basking in the warmth of the bath and Steve's solid frame against his.
Tony kissed him back automatically, eagerly.  "I need to eat before I die," he murmured against Steve's lips, smiling, staring into his eyes.  "And then... I dunno... whatever you wanna do."
"You got company."
It was fourteen hours of testing before they have him moved into a permanent hospital bed.  It was on the ground floor and there was a window, so Steve could see out onto the base. The room had only the one bed and no television or other entertainment, but the window seemed to imply he wasn't actually being held prisoner.
"We don't know," Phil said apologetically. "It depends who they believe. But we'll fight it; we won't let him get away with this."
"It appears the reactor has accepted the modified core, yes.  All functions are nominal; energy output is steady.  Congratulations, sir."
Tony frowned.  "To who, Odin?" he said with a roll of his eyes.  He thought religion was for fools.  "We'll just pick up some Plan B or something.  JARVIS!"
"What's climate change?" asked Steve through a mouthful of cake.
"Definitely can't get a metal one then," Steve pointed out, tucking his hands under his head as he got comfy in the sheets. His eyes were half drooping shut again.  "Was my neck still... bad?" he asked hesitantly. "Bad as last time? It didn't hurt for me at all. Well--" He blushed again. "Not in ways I didn't like."
"If we set alarms on his phone, they might actually do it," Aria sighed and took Steve's phone out of his back pocket without asking. It was fine. He was more interested by Clint on the fridge and Tony bickering. He frowned.
"There you go," he whispered softly.  He kissed Steve's bottom lip. "Good omega... so good."
"You can find him later."
The mug had chipped, but hadn't broken.  Tony picked it up with the glove, set in one the table, and threw the oily dishrag over the puddle of coffee on the floor.  It wasn't big enough to cover the rapidly spreading liquid.
and I'm here. I kneel for you because I
"They're not firing him."
to take it."
There was a snap as the gauntlet snapped onto the wrist, covering his hand.
"Yessir.  My grandfather's brother was the cousin of Joseph Rogers."
Tony cocked his head, then looked at Steve.  "You know what? I have no idea how Clint ended up with SHIELD, actually."
"Yes, sir."
Steve smiled. He was glad he could still make jokes.
"James, it's time for you to leave," said Pietro quietly.
"Well then you have to trust that I'm strong enough," Steve insisted. "I know what it's like to have someone stuck in your head who you don't really want there. I know what it's like to have someone cling to your every waking emotion and taint every single one. I know what a shit bond feels like. I lived through it. This is nothing compared to that. This is like an echo of that and I can handle it. If anything, it makes me punch harder."
"Pretty sure he knows," said Clint.
"Now, I need to talk to Donner, Phil. I'm sorry, or that really was for nothing.  At the very least, Donner got to hear Gideon saying he doesn't care about him, and maybe he won't go back to him."
"Heard you had a spot of bother today," Pierce said through a tight smile, turning back to Steve. "I'm sorry to hear that."
"Untreated post-traumatic stress disorder can be devastating, Steve.  And-- I'm sorry, I think they called it shell-shock in your time-- and it's not a sign of weakness to have it.  You've been through more than most soldiers ever go through. But now the war's over, and it's time to start focus on caring for yourself instead of finding battles to fight," said Dr. Brennan.
All of the Alphas looked mortified that Tony was letting Steve walk in front of him.
He reached out with his right hand and drew a curved line, then another straight one under it, and another straight one under that.
Then he found it.  It was subtle, but Steve's reaction was not; his eyes glazed and his lips parted in a half-sigh, half-groan.
"You're really calling it that?" asked Sam.
? Jesus Christ, was he
"I thought I wasn't- I didn't know. I don't know. I wouldn't have let Tony if I thought-"
Steve broke about speed limit possible getting them out.  He felt oddly guilty about stealing someone's car, about leaving Kate, about everything.  He could only hope Kate was okay, but Nick was bleeding out on him and he didn't have time to hesitate. He found the nearest hospital he could and then hoisted Fury up into his arms again.
!  It's always about
The asset didn't think; he reacted.  He was after the blond in an instant, all semblance of thought gone.
The soldier considered this tentatively.  "Some people are more equal than others," he explained finally.
"The Alphas play a big poker game the first night," Abby explained. "It can get pretty intense."
He sat on the stoop and put his face in his hands.  The air was fucking frigid, but he didn't want to go back into the club and watch Rogers having the time of his life.  It was better this way.  Them just being pals.  Buck deserved this, after what he'd put Rogers through.  He'd saved his life, sure, but also been a real jerk about it.
"Yes... yes... yes... yes..." Tony hooked him fingers into Steve's collar and tugged him to the side, pushing him to roll him over; Steve was like putty, practically mind-reading what he wanted; he was already on his knees, head down, legs spread invitingly, presenting himself, and Tony was climbing onto him, pushing himself into his warm, inviting entrance.
The tapping persisted. He ignored it.
Against the wall, Pepper sighed and checked her watch.  It was getting late, Tony was clearly high as a kite, and she was watching carefully for the moment she'd have to swoop in and keep him from banging Steve right there on the dance floor.
"Congratulations.  I think," said Tony.  "Don't you still feel the bond?"
He wondered, distantly, how long it would be before Tony noticed he'd left.  But it was nothing more than a passing thought.
The drive home was mostly quiet; Tony was clinging to his hand with a look of forced calm, and George was half-asleep, waking only to hum softly with the radio.  Donner, as usual, had nothing to say; he sat quietly, watching Tony discreetly, as he was the only Alpha in the car.
"Thank you," Steve smiled. (Last yoga session he accidentally ripped his leggings; it had been an awkward walk to the car.)  "It's always nice to see clothes in my size."
Tony barely glanced down at it  "I hit a building.  It's fine, the suit took most of the impact.  I need Pepper; she's got all the contact info for my legal team-"
Then Steve blinked and cocked his head. "And what the hell is a topiary artist?"
"Well, I didn't come here to see him Captain. Just you. But, of course, I will be happy to say hello," Stone said with a polite smile as he took a seat. Steve sat opposite him. It was strange. He was almost expecting Stone to reach over and take his hand and talk about his feelings. There was something big brotherly about him.  Yet the overwhelming creepiness of his smell made all of the hair on Steve’s arms and neck stand up.
Aria looked over at Tony, her eyes narrowing a little. "Do you have an artist booked yet?"
"So I'm supposed to believe you brought some some homeless omega out of the goodness of your heart?  Give me a break, Tony, I was sixteen once, too," scoffed Howard.  "And I thought I told you to
Steve looked down at Tony with red rimmed eyes and blurry vision. He rubbed a hand over his face, then his eyes. He sniffed softly. "I don't usually cry so easy," he whispered. Neither of them mentioned that he'd hardly cried over something small.
"Fine, fine.  Have your little charity.  But as I said. No guests, no performances, no mention of any status-oriented groups.  Stick to the scripted apology."
Tony fished around his drink for the olive and gave up after a while, letting it swirl around the edges of the glass.  He licked the gin off his fingers.
She tried again.
"Nope."
and you should do it, absolutely; everyone loves her," said Tony, nodding eagerly.  He gave Steve another squeeze.  "Steve, I want you to go out there and really... show everyone what you're made of.  And I'll be behind you every step of the way.  Especially if I get to meet Taylor Swift. I have, like, a huge crush on her.  Don't tell anyone, though, she's kind of a pop star.  Pepper knows and she and Happy never stop teasing me about it.  Like I said, though... I'm sort of a sucker for sweet wholesome-looking blondes."  He kissed Steve's temple.  "You don't have to do all that stuff this week, though, right?  We're having 'us' time.  You know... honeymooning it up.  I mean, we're still doing the Expo, obviously, it's
Within a few days, though, it had become apparent that Steve's personality wasn't what Tony had expected.  Steve was helpful, yes, because that was his job. But he acted... not like the omegas Tony was used to. Tony was used to omegas being quiet little shadows, shoe-elves; Steve was big and bold and acted like he expected to be treated with respect.
"So... are you attracted to omegas?" Steve asked, suddenly curious.
Steve watched her pull out her phone. "He's not doing this for Fury's benefit," he said quietly and Natasha looked up at him. Her gaze lingered a second too long, like she was trying to make a point.
Tony flopped down onto a deck chair and held out an arm, inviting Steve to lie down with him.  He was still holding the Bloody Mary in his other hand, though he was nearly finished with it.
"Are you sure the serum definitely got rid of-" began Natasha
He waited until Steve left, then threw back a final drink before following him toward the bedroom.  He saw Steve was already curled up in bed.
Natasha, stirring her coffee, had contemplated his question for a moment, regarding him coldly, then finally said, "Very."
, Pepper recognized that, for someone who had lived through the twenties and thirties, Steve wasn't such a big fan of slasher flickers or electric guitars.  Steve and Pepper both liked lighthearted movies, and Steve was fascinated with modern animation. She took him shopping (something Tony would rather die than do; he had several shirts in his wardrobe that were several decades old) and occasionally dragged him to a concert or art show that she thought they'd enjoy.  Tony was happy to have her around again; she seemed more willing to come by now that Tony was in a stable relationship.
Sixteen was chewing on her thumb nervously and giggling, eyeballing him not unlike Joan and Maria had done.
"Sometimes I think it would just be easier...if I just got on my knees and started being the omega everyone wants me to be."
him.  He needed someone he could trust to be there for him before he faced what had just happened and then melted down.  Because he felt like if he didn't have some sort of anchor, he'd start screaming and screaming and never, ever be able to stop.  He was teetering on the edge of a precipice, on the brink of ferality.  He'd heard of Alphas going crazy; now he understood.  For a brief and beautiful moment, a singular glistening moment of time, Tony had been happy.  Then it had been ripped away from him and he was left empty and broken.
Tony was already circling them.  Dirt, dirt, dirt. Yes, this was all perfect.
"He just keeps going on about how he'll be a terrible father!"
"If," echoed Phil.
"Where to, boss?"
"I don't know if I can make any sort of point here, Tony," he groaned. "I don't think anyone here will listen to me. And what right do I have to come along and say they're all living their lives wrong, and are being oppressed? I don't. Everyone has individual situations."
"I've never heard of any of those of those brands," Steve admitted, forcing himself to refocus on the topic at hand: collars. "And that's okay. Let people speculate. It's really no one's business what we're buying or not buying." He paused for a moment. "I was kind of hoping we could some custom ones, with hidden messages on the inside-- something like, I dunno,
"Louis Theroux," JARVIS informed helpfully. Steve blinked.
He walked in on Tony using his toothbrush and found himself smiling. Steve moved to turn on the shower, waiting for it to get warm before he took Tony's hand and dragged him into the shower with him. It felt good as the hot water ran down them and over the curve of his back and ass. It would feel good to watch away all those dried...fluids. "Sam is a
"Hey, Kate," Steve replied a little a awkwardly, eyeing the blonde Alpha with some degree of suspicion. She was overly cheery and comfortable and apparently knew who he was. Something didn't quite... click. "You alright?" he asked her, and Kate smiled prettily, but it didn't meet her eyes.
"Steve, why didn't you tell me?" she asked, and she moved over to envelop him in a hug.  Tony watched, feeling left out. No one had ever hugged him over the whole Bucky debacle.  Granted, pushing Steve was had been his fault, but... well, he'd thought Peggy, as a fellow Alpha, might at least understand some of the hurt there.
judging my drinking habits, now, too," warned Tony.  Since Steve had moved in, JARVIS had picked up a new dimension of sass, which included the occasional old-timey curse.  The first time he'd casually exclaimed "Horsefeathers!" Tony had laughed until his sides ached. He thought about resetting JARVIS, but he sort of liked how Steve was influencing him.
"To be fair, it's not like she couldn't have guessed.  Howard had a reputation," said Fury, crossing his arms.
"Don't smoke in my house," added Tony.  "I can still smell--"
"A couple of glasses a night isn't especially--"
Natasha cautiously darted forward, head still down as she grabbed the shield and then moved back to the wall. She held it in front of her, position defensive. "Sam? Have you got the bird out front?"
Yet life wasn't boring.  He let Tony whisk him away to New York for his birthday; they visited his old haunts in Brooklyn, many of which were no longer recognizable.  They shared a meal at a small pizza place; the evening ended rather dramatically when Tony unfurled Steve's birthday present.  ("Ta-da!" he'd exclaimed dramatically as a woman walked in wearing a heavy leather glove.  Perched upon it was a bald eagle.  "Her name's Liberty!" he said; Liberty shrieked and flapped her wings, alarming everyone in the restaurant.)  (Steve texted Aria and Pepper to ask if they could find a suitable refuge for Liberty, not wanting a rogue eagle flapping around the Stark mansion and overturning orchids.)
Unsurprisingly, all of them were Alphas.  Except Sean.
"Steve. We need to talk about you said--"
not illegal.  Scentings are legal."
Tony nosed against Steve's neck.  He kept poking and prodding but none of his touches elicited the same reaction as Maggie's touch had.  He wondered what the omega dinner would be like... if they would all loosen up a little or be as bland and shallow as ever.  He wondered if they all just sat around talking about their Alphas. And he wondered if poor Rex would even be allowed there.
She tried Rhodes. Same story.  She felt frustrated; she had no idea what could trigger this sort of reaction.  Tony had reacted with less hysteria to Obadiah's betrayal and death, to his own heart problems, and to his ninety-three day capture in Afghanistan.
The only thing Tony really knew was where Steve lived.
"Happy Christmas," he said, his gaze meeting the soldier's.  He held out a tiny box, wrapped in silver paper.
"I still visit her when I can. But she is absolutely, positively not a threat to our bond.  Our romance ended in 1944.  We're just friends now.  Just a friend. That's the truth, I promise."
"But it's still there?"
Rumlow's hands were rough. Like Bucky's. They were soldier's hands. Steve liked the feeling of them.  He shoved his hands in his lap, gripping the edge of the coat around him. It smelt of Brock. Steve was swaying a little, enjoying the fingers in his hair...
.  It's the twenty-first century!  Omegas should be... you know."
to get sued..."
Oh wonderful. The girls grabbed Steve a little too hard and he was bit scared that the groping Tony had warned him about would finally materialize-- just not in the way he expected. "Bye," he told Tony, already looking a little lost as he watched the other loud, dominant Alpha drag his mate away.
Pitbull's crew was already dragging him away with the enticing offer of more drinks.
down," said Tony.  Gently, he pushed Steve onto his back and duck down to kiss his torso softly, brushing the skin with his lips.  Steve's smell and taste were familiar, though subtly difference. Not bad. Just... different. Tony didn't comment on it.  He didn't know if Steve was aware how his body chemistry had altered but figured it would kill the mood to remind Steve about what had happened in Yemen.
Steve then reached up, put a hand on his shoulder and winced as he pushed it back. A horrible clicking sound filled the room and everyone who could hear it recoiled.
"--was thinking I could implant magnets into myself and have myself by like a transmitter and basically send out a constant radio wave frequency that the suit could ID and-- oh, good, the shower's ready!  You go in first, I'm not going in without you, you stink, not in a bad way, I love the way you smell, you're my mate, but obviously you've been working out, how far did you run today, here let me help you."
At the SHIELD base Steve didn't know what to tell them. He thought everything they were doing was stupid and foolish, and reminded the scientists of it at regular intervals. They were clearly getting equally frustrated with him, running off statistics and numbers like he was supposed to understand. "Look," one of them said, pointing to a video monitor. "Sometimes it convulses, like this." The blue energy around the Tesseract twisted, the pattern circular and uniform around the cube. But no space window.
Kerry flipped him the bird and George grinned devilishly.
There was a muffled rumble from downstairs (an explosion?) and a moment later, black smoke was pouring up from the basement door.
Sam and Natasha looked at the car parked next to the McLaren.  It was a white Honda Civic.
"...quite fascinating, actually.  When Alphas and omega bond, they have a connection, mentally.  Generally a very shallow and subconscious one.  We're not yet entirely sure how it works.  In the case of trios, the Alpha can serve as a link between omegas.  This is actually very interesting.  I've never seen two Alphas and an omega.  As far as we can tell, Rogers is acting as a go-between for Barnes and Stark."
He picked up a piece of bacon begrudgingly and chewed on it slowly. "So today is for relaxing... huh?"
"Alphas versus omegas is fine," she said.  "Derick and I can be on Steve's team, and Charlotte, you can play with Callum and-- Dr. Stark."
"--right, so he's on suppressants, but what about omegas that don't want to take suppressants, are all the Alphas around them supposed to suffer just because they don't want to take suppressants?"
"You know Tony can walk away from this unharmed, don't you? If he screws this up he'll be fine. He'll just be 'playboy' Stark all over again, and he'll have screwed Captain America.  Another conquest for Stark.  Bragging rights. But Steve doesn't have that luxury. If his first-" Aria shared a look with Pepper and sighed. "-first
Steve grunted and arced up as Tony pushed inside. He was bigger than he remembered, or so Steve thought, in that moment. He clenched around him tightly and curled his arms around Tony's shoulders, drawing him in closer. "F-fuck..."
He hadn't had any dreams; he'd passed out from the liquor and was positive he hadn't had any nightmares plaguing him.  So if Steve had had a bad dream, it had to have been--
?" Frond asked, frowning at him like he was an idiot.
"I've always known I was doing the right thing," Steve breathed. "But ever since I woke up I've not being so sure anymore."
He walked backed out to find Steve floating on his back.
JARVIS didn't respond and Pepper realized Tony's override was still in effect.  JARVIS would only take orders from him until it was lifted.
... Steve was so lithe and muscled and blonde and--
There was a glint of metal under the stretch of the light from the arc reactor. But it was gone as quickly as it appeared.
The room reeked like desire, like sex.  Tony could smell the slick between Steve's legs.  But he couldn't just let Steve...
Pepper sighed and reached over to put a hand on his shoulder.  "Okay, I'm going to call a doctor for you and Steve to talk to tomorrow, okay?  I'll find someone who will do a house call and sit both of you down and talk to you.  I think you need to go upstairs and talk all this over with Steve.  No sex.  Just talk."
Phil hung up.  Steve wondered if Phil appreciated the irony of telling him, Captain America, not to behave rashly.  Steve had always acted on his gut and that had always served him well.
He could fall asleep like this, the water was so lovely, but he forced himself to get out. Steve didn't really want to get all pruney.
he wasn't being oppressed. He exhaled slowly. He could do this.
he thought, certain that Steve was probably already on the second draft in his head.
, Steve wanted to say. But he just nodded and gave a somber swallow. "I'll be fine, V, honestly. I'm a big boy." Steve waved her off and reached for another bottle of water in the fridge.
He knew the first time he'd seen a hypercube on paper though.  It was in his father's notes.  He had seen it, then, as a mere curiosity.  Now he was wondering.  If Howard was in SHIELD... and SHIELD had this thing... then surely...?
"...let's say, ah... how about nine-thirty tomorrow?" said Rhodey.  "I'd like to have breakfast with him."
"They also said they were sending in a psychologist tomorrow," Sam added quietly. "You know, they're...worried about you."
"While they still have that witch with them I'm useless," Steve shrugged. "You can't ever be sure it's me."
Tony glared at them, then looked back at Steve.
He bit into a cinnamon donut and tossed a few crumbs to a pigeon standing on the W below him.  Several more birds flocked over.  "...it just keeps getting better and better, kids," he said to them, throwing more donut pieces down.  One of his personal heroes, Tesla, had died like this, mad and talking to pigeons.  Tony chuckled to himself sadly.  He had to laugh, had to maintain a sense of humor, or he'd have a total breakdown.  He didn't want to die
.  Shit.  Is Banksy there?"
He cast a look around, feeling hopeless.  He pined for Steve and for Karpov, and now the twins had abandoned him, too.  He was alone in the world and all he had was the clothes on his back and the notebook under his arm.
They let Tony gripe the whole way home, where his mood shifted a little as he began talking about the fight he was allowed to fight.  The one for Donner.
Pepper had given Steve multiple dire warnings about Tony's mood swings and bouts of futile depression; it was best, she'd told him, just to let him ride it out.  Also, she mentioned, she watered down all the alcohol during the month of March, as a precaution.
"Sorry!  Sorry!"
He passed the program to Steve.
"Okay, okay, okay," said Tony quickly, snatching the shirt from Steve and wrestling it onto himself.  "Now gimme my kiss. Rhodes, wanna see what I'm working on downstairs? I have this idea for self-assembling--"
"...Tony!"
"Said the military doctor," said Tony with a roll of his eyes.  "I don't think this is a problem, unless you think, realistically, Steve's gonna get attacked by the Winter Soldier. Who, let's be real, only shows up, what, once every decade or something and probably isn't even--"
Pepper let out a noise of protest; Aria was already trying to shoo Steve toward the stairs to get him dressed.  The fact that he was already dressed didn't matter; she was going to go over inch of him to make sure he was presentable.
He paused, then added, "Besides, I don't know if I can handle five more presentations.  Did you see how they got a redhead, and my favorite whiskey? These fucks know exactly what pulls my strings.  I'm used to people sucking up to me, but holy shit. These guys are taking it to another lev--"
Steve let out a ragged breath. "Is there anything I can to make it better?" He asked softly, knowing there was nothing he could do to make it actually
Steve turned back around to face Tony, tilting his head in an almost coy sort of manner. "So, where'd you want me?"
, Steve.  ...you know I lost five thou' because of you?  Naw, it's good, I don't care, that's walking around money... oh my God..."  He flipped the paper and pointed to a picture of Steve lounging, shirtless, a smeared American flag on his naked skin.  "This is the sexiest thing I've ever seen."  His eyes scanned over the paper.  "
Donner and Piper both sat without a hint of hesitation.  Tony recognized only one other omegas, DeSoto, by his black eye.
Steve woke at seven am. He checked Tony's temperature again. Then he fetched him a glass of water and left it by the bedside, using the glass to hold down a note that read
Aria rolled her eyes.  "I was talking to Steve."
Tony appeared by Steve's side.  "...was that Katy Perry?" he asked with delight.  "She's the one who kissed a girl and liked it! JARVIS, is she on my To-Screw List?"
"It's not true, what they're saying, Steve. None of it." David said, fixing him a serious look and Steve swallowed down the last piece of bacon.
"I'll get up in maybe thirty minutes," mumbled Tony sleepily.  "Can you make me coffee, Stevie? That'd be great." He stifled a yawn.  "I'll come down... bacon, too, make some bacon... love you." He rolled onto his stomach, dangling an arm over the side of the bed.
what I'm talking about. Breeders like you who only cause trouble--"
to sleep with Tony was gross. Did he have no loyalty to his own Alpha whatsoever? Was there no shame?
"Er, yes?"
He began pacing.  Steve's smell was so rich, so complex.  He was trying to breathe through his mouth but he could practically taste it and his whole body was quivering with desperate anticipation.
Tony grinned at Maria.  "You like what you see?" he asked, slouching down in his chair.  He was wearing sweatpants and his erection was obvious.
"Cookies?" asked Lila, getting excited.
"You were bonded."
doesn't want me..." Steve looked down at his hands in his lap.  How in the hell had he managed to lose two Alphas in a row? "I'm damaged goods, aren't I?" He shrugged with a weak smile.
to be in charge?" he asked in a whisper.
They fell quiet again.
Tony and Steve didn't talk much about Bucky in the following week.  Tony was, being Tony, cripplingly allergic to any sort of emotional discussion.  Instead, encouraged by Steve's positive reaction to their mating, instead opted to fuck Steve stupid at least once a day, channeling whatever frustrations or insecurities he had into unbridled mating that obliterated large portions of their hotel room.  Clint had been absolutely correct in his advice; when Steve acted submissive, Tony's insecurities melted like warmed butter.
Phil produced a needle from a small case in his jacket pocket. Presumably to try and stop Steve's heat. Gently, Phil took one of Steve's arms and trailed his fingers around, finding a good vein.
"That he's alive, and he's an omega.  He gave this big interview about it and everything."
"Thank you, Barton.  I built it myself," said Tony, crossing his arms over his arc reactor.
me. Jesus, maybe in today's standards but not in the forties," Steve huffed, looking more annoyed than anything else. "He didn't do anything the president didn't do," he added and Maria quirked a brow up at that.
"Wait, you ran a mission?  Aren't you in post-heat?" asked Steve, brow furrowing.
It had taken a fair bit of arm-twisting to convince SHIELD to let them go on a ten-day vacation, since they were supposed to be checking in weekly, but it had been allowed in the end because, after all, it was their first anniversary and the nation expected them to go on a getaway.  Pepper had booked them a suite at the Langham, which was near Hyde Park. Tony had insisted on a hotel with a spa, and had also insisted they be near the park because he knew Steve would want to go running, little cardio bunny that he was.
but still. I won't need to do daily check-ups anymore. Maybe I should come back on Sunday, just to give you a final once over?"
"You need to stay hydrated. You'll be doing a lot of talking and you don't want to fuck up your voice for later," Aria told him.
omega, like Trickshot, say, where would I go?"
"Hey, Charlie," said Tony flatly.  The two of them exchanged a fist-bump before Tony got on the plane, flopping into the nearest chair with a heavy sigh and turning to stare out the window.  He didn't move for the whole trip, not even to get a drink.
As the sun set, many of the kids began to disappear, being taken away by Child Protective Services or paramedics or the police, to be processes, interviewed, examined, placed in foster care, or taken to one of the hostels set up by Project 84.
Phil was the one to take the lead.
Pietro was there, but he couldn't tell if he was very close or very far away.  He opened his mouth and his lips moved but there was no sound. Fine gold strands of smoke twisting away from his mouth.
Donner's brief moment of possible independence crumbled and he let George take him inside.
Kate marched up to them. She didn't give a shit if she was treating Captain America or the goddamn queen of England. Kate was already
.  Uniform or not, he certainly felt like a selfish jerk. He'd made his and Tony's problem everyone else's problem, too.
Then Steve's heart sank when he saw one guy left on stage. Number Nineteen.
"Bucky was everything, especially after my mom died. He was my best friend. He kept me safe- he is, hands down, the only reason I'm alive today. I don't want to think about where I would have ended up without him. And I'm grateful to him, for everything that he did, but since waking up in the twenty first century I realised something...he treated me like shit. Like, I was a commodity to him. Or something. I was an omega and that was always going to factor into our relationship. I don't blame Bucky, really. It was the times- it the way things were. He cared about me, but he didn't respect me."
They turned toward the short wing on the left, a beta woman was leading six children in a single-file line.  They were dressed in uniforms, with the girls in a navy skirt, knee-high socks, and white blouse, and the boys in a white button-up with navy slacks.  They all looked between ten and twelve and perfectly normal and healthy. They were all omegas.
"Not gonna--" Steve let out a quiet gasp. "--last long like this,” he warned him, head tilted back in the sand as his eyes rolled back too. He trembled underneath him, squirming in the sand, his cheeks flushing as he grew closer and closer. And Steve really didn't think he could last long like this, even if he wanted to. Tony's mouth was wet and warm and inviting. Steve let out another undignified sound and hummed, unaware and uncaring about anything else round him aside from Tony.
"Good morning sir.  The time is eight-fifty a.m.  The temperature is eighty-four degrees with clear skies.  Surf conditions are excellent with six-to-eight foot swells.  Stark Industries is up point two points, opening this morning at six hundred and twenty-nine points."
"Well, technically, you're not allowed... Captain." The waiter looked about twenty; dark hair flopped over his face. "But I'm sure I can bring you some '
"I thought we were here for information about the Winter Soldier.  Not your ex," he snarled.
Irshad leaned in to Steve and Tony conspiratorially.  "I'm sorry for your loss.  I think it's very brave of you to come here through it."
"You mean from the people who tried to take him before?"
Tony was yanked from his reverie suddenly, violently.
Steve grunted. "I don't know. I feel kinda gross." He had Tony's dried semen all over his thighs. He didn't really remember last night all that well; he vaguely remembered them having sex and his nails digging into Tony's back as he pushed inside of him. But Tony had been totally out of it too, neither of them were really accountable--
"I... do?" Steve didn't sound surprised, just a little sad. He didn't know Tony would be able to smell it on him. So now, even if he couldn't
"Ste-
Maggie Frond, despite her diminutive stature, commanded a presence like no other when she slammed the door behind her and walked to the front of the room.  "This is Discipline in the Home. I'm Maggie Frond," she said brusquely. "There's two things every bonded omega wants, needs, and craves. That's whelps, and approval.  An omega that is properly broken in is a happy omega. Omegas with direction, omegas with leadership... these are omegas who are truly fulfilled. An omega who serves is an omega who is content.  That is their natural place in the world. That--" She pointed suddenly to Steve. "--is not a happy omega. ...everyone omega in this room has the need for approval in common. They are desperate to be told they are good, to please their Alphas.  They're hard-wired to want it. Discipline is therefore not only for the Alpha's benefit, but for the omega's, too. When you put an omega on their knees, you're strengthening your bond. Discipline isn't about punishment. It's about setting expectations for the omega to follow.  When they obey, they get rewarded. When they disobey, they get disciplined. It's a simple principle that, sadly, few Alphas today seem to be able to wrap their heads around."
"Wow, a Cap speech!  Couldn't have seen
"Hey,
He tried to think of a joke to lighten the mood.
"I'm not coddling you," Steve said. "I'm just saying I'm here if you need me to be. I'm not trying to mother you. If you say it's fine then it's fine." He nodded and pulled out the key, taking the collar off. The skin underneath was red but not swollen like it had been the night before. Steve still felt bad for it all the same though.
His head poked back up over the surface of the water and he watched Tony with a mischievous sort of glint in his eyes. "Well, don't you wanna swim?"
Steve rose.  "Yeah, sure.  You wanna go outside?  The view's nice."
"Why's it all about him?  I was there, too," interrupted Tony.  "I got my hackles all itchy for him. ...aren't there any news stories with my name in them?"
Jack made a small sound in his arms and he mentally swore, because he knew what he had to do, and it wasn't going after Steve.  Every fiber in his body was screaming at him to get to his omega, cover him, protect him.  But that wouldn't be what Steve wanted.  Steve was selfless; Steve would want everyone to be safe, not just them.  Steve would want Tony to neutralize the threat.
showroom.  Please, we're not buying anything from here.  We're meeting a rep named Lydia to look at a private collection."  He hooked his arm into Steve's and gave him a pat. "Steve, you killed Nazis.  You can try on a couple of collars. Just to be clear, we're not even considering anything less than a cool mil.  C'mon."
"I don't think it's
(a recommendation from Jarvis) and he remembered one line in particular that had given him chills:
"Right, come on. Into the shower. Let's get you cleaned up properly."
of Bucky's cryo tube.  He'd felt Bucky, his emotions, his fears.  His confusion and his loneliness.  He'd seen inside his cyro tube, the sarcophagus where Bucky was being held because there was no one else to put him.
One of the back cars appeared on the road ahead and stopped right in the middle of the road. Fury swerved but didn't quite manage to keep going. They were forced to stop.
"I said no."
"I think he wasn't feeling too good. Pepper took him to one of the bathrooms."
Steve sighed, steeling himself for the worse. "It's not...normal, to buy a life partner. You meet them first, get to know them, go on dates--"
"Also... HYDRA never knew we were mated," he pointed out. "My bite mark was gone on the surface, after the serum."
been a blur.  And when did a honeymoon period really "start?"  He had fucked Steve before really properly mating him.  There were a few days before they were officially mated that were sketchy.
Dr. Richards was chatting it up with a woman Tony recognized from Natick labs.
Untouchable.  Yes, that summed it up nicely.  He was untouchable.
"No, we're just draining his arvicolina," said Gleason pleasantly.
"Paul, that's Donner."
"Why do you have two bite marks on your neck?"
"We're supposed to be keeping an eye on you for occurrences like that one," Mackenzie reminded him.
He looked down at the files, eyes wide. "When do we have to do all this by?"
"...I'm glad you're home again," said Tony.  "...even if you come with a big crowd of protesters and Barton excludes me from your special little meetings.  I swear to God, Steve, if you come home with a special decoder ring or something, I will
"I don't know," Steve said after a beat, unsure of how to answer all of her questions or in which order. "I mean-- yes, Tony is here.  He's fine.  I mean.  Physically, yes." Although that had been a close call. "He's only had one drink in the past like...thirty-six hours." Which was seriously a good record for Tony Stark. Steve would be happy about it if he knew this wasn't all part of a much bigger issue.
He rolled off of Steve and grabbed his sweatpants.  "I'm gonna go get the orchids that are outside."  He brushed Steve's hair softly as he passed by him.  The fact that his couch was probably ruined was unimportant to him.
"HEY!"
Worst, there was an agreement for a background check.
"They were great, Dave, really, thank you... okay... well, if no one else has anything, then you've got the floor, Steph.  What's going on?"
"I was
But nothing compared to losing Bucky.  Nothing compared to being unable to stretch that last, critical inch and grab his hand.
"He was working late. I don't actually know," Steve admitted sheepishly. The doctor opened his mouth before Steve continued before he could speak. "It's the anniversary of his parents' death. Not a good time for him right now."
Steve eyed the drinks cabinet briefly like an old enemy before he went to take his seat.
He could still remember seeing a pane of glass in the darkness, his breath steaming it up. Steve had seen the
The sleep he had after they'd mated was perfect and uninterrupted, and it was just what the doctor had ordered.  Steve had not been sleeping as well as he normally did because of his test on Wednesday, the one that would make or break his chances of being assigned to more serious missions for SHIELD. Steve knew the physical side of the test would be easy; he'd pass, no problem, with flying colors. But the mental test...Steve was scared to see how far they'd push it.  They didn't just rely on pyche evaluations; they had new technology now, technology that let them go into your brain, implant dreams, watch them like they were movies. Steve had seen it done once before; they injected the subject with a drug (who knew what), sat them in a chair with dozens of electrodes over their head, and monitored everything from cortisol levels to the lucid, mental reaction of the person in the simulation.  The test could simulate an almost infinite number of different scenarios. It was clever, he'd give them that, but it also meant SHIELD could see how Steve responded when he was dying, because in that machine, he would think he actually was.  Steve was still getting used to microwaves; SHIELD's top-level, cutting-edge technology was frightening to him.
"...there was more than one Captain.  I think it was just a title.  I think there were like, three or four different guys who threw on the mask and picked up the shield--"
Steve went and cooked them breakfast. It was pancakes, his mother's recipe. He still remembered how he used to peek over the top of the counter in his young age and listened intently as his mother explained how to make them as fluffy as possible. So he made them sweet and fluffy and dropped pieces of banana and blueberry on top before following with maple syrup.  The access to all sorts of fruits, even in winter, was mind-boggling to Steve; it felt like just yesterday he was living in a world of ration cards.  Breakfast smelled good; Steve was sure Tony must be awake by now.
"She's a baby," said Donner.
"Clearly, you're mistaken.  If he were dead, there would be no live signal to pick up in the first place.  Death severs the bond.  You can't access a person's feelings if they're dead."
She managed to set the plates down beside them with glasses of water without really looking. Pepper then went to take Phil his plate of food, leaving it by the edge of the tent. "Phil?" She called over the music. "I've made you food."
"Anyway, I promise tonight I won't do that.  Today's just for us, okay? Tomorrow is your big speech and so I wanna make sure today is relaxing.  ...how about I finish with this and you let me serve you? I can probably fry bacon without screwing it up."  (Tony had never fried bacon himself, but how hard could it be?) (He had once made a turkey using a microwave oven he built.  The microwave had been twenty-something kilowatts and had had no door, so he'd tested it in the garage. The turkey had taken about twenty minutes to cook before bursting into flames and Tony had also melted the paint off one of his dad's cars and shorted out half of the house's electronics.  It was one of few times that Aaliyah had actually hit him;
"...can everyone see the poster?  ...I asked for a projector but, once again, the event coordinator sort of dropped the ball.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is a Punnett square. A basic predictive model of gene inheritance and traits.  Today, over the next hour, I'm going to explain to you how this all works so that if you want to select a good breeder and boost your chances of having an Alpha whelp, you can.  I know most of us here think with our knots instead of our minds--"
"And I wasn't the only one who was forced bonded," Steve muttered and then stood, carrying Lila in his arms as he smiled down at Cooper. "Sure, lead the way."
"This was absolutely not terrible." - blu3stocking
"Yay," said Donner quietly.
"...Why?"
"I'll be careful Peg."
When Steve was having bad days usually he went to town on dummies or punching bags. He wasn't good at just sitting still and dealing with it.
"Hey-" Steve stood as Tony did. His brow was knotted tightly in concern. He reached out and took Tony's shaking hands in his own. "Tony, it's ten in the morning," he said softly, his point clear. He squeezed. "Please don't go out and get a drink. It won't make you feel better- sure, in the short term it will, but in the long term, it won't. You nearly died once. I can't watch you hurt yourself all over again." And Steve wasn't sure he literally could. It would kill him to watch Tony start drinking at ten in the morning.
Steve moved to run a hand down Tony's arm before threading their fingers together. "Tony," he murmured and blue eyes flickered up to meet brown. "You saw that place. You saw that chair. They had militant scientists who were willing to kill themselves for a cause. We saw that, that's
Tony tucked his arms in and sped down, dropping with a clank onto the main stage.

"Which means you're in big trouble for paying a half-million for that used-up spade."
Steve's phone rang in Rumlow's hand; he silenced it immediately.  Steve's eyes were still unfocused and unseeing. Rumlow patted his arm again.  Steve was clearly tense, probably from feeling vulnerable, but Rumlow was relying on his natural charm to calm the omega.  He had very specific orders. "Don't worry, Captain. We're taking you somewhere safe," he promised.
Pepper looked up and immediately heaved a world-weary sigh, crossing the room to redo Tony's tie.  The only knot he knew was the half-Windsor; she began retying it into an Eldridge. "That watch doesn't match," she observed.
Kerry snorted. "We don't want to have to be suing ourselves too."
"Shut up!  What do you know about self-pity, anyway?  You're just a bunch of lines of code."
. "If I had listened to men like you in the forties, I wouldn't be standing here today.  And so God help me I am
"Tony?" Steve stuck his head into the bathroom to find the other in the shower. He stepped in, the air damp with steam from the spray. Tony always liked the shower on hot. He could still see the bruises from Tony's work and sighed internally. "Mind if I join?"
Pepper was seated on the sofa opposite to them. "Malick is requesting you see him this evening. I think he's pushing to the front of the queue."
Peggy put away the albums, closing the cover on Bucky's goofy smile, and they spent the rest of the evening chatting.  Peggy wanted to know all about what Tony had been up to. She and Steve reminisced about the past. It was strange, her role: to Tony she was a parental figure and to Steve, a peer.  Tony unbuttoned his shirt to show her his chest.
She actually sat up on her knees and turned to face him.  "Those were forever ago. I haven't done any acting since, like... well gosh, at least ten years now."
Steve blinked when Frond walked away, almost as if he were waking up. She was talking again.
T'Chaka beamed at the approval. "In Wakanda we believe that the stronger the omega, the stronger the bond. We appreciate the kind of example you set, Captain."
"Yes. Gideon Malick," Steve nodded, blushing a little as Laura gave him a double portion of French toast to start with. "He tried to order my lunch for me."
Bucky looked up sharply.  The smell of fear was sharp.  "What happened?"
"Yes."  He struggled to think of something more to say.  "My omega was sick.  I couldn't mate him.  He was always so angry at me.  But I didn't want to hurt him.  We were pals, ever since we were kids..."  His accent sounded unfamiliar, even to him now.  "...but I had to keep him safe, he was always gettin' into scraps, he was so stubborn.  Then I signed up for the war.  And when I saw him again he didn't need me anymore.  The mark was gone.  And he said he couldn't feel me."
In the farmhouse, Clint and Natasha were transformed.  They were no longer deadly assassins with glocks tucked into their boots and knives in the smalls of their backs.  Natasha was warm, hugging Lila on her lap, and Clint was a typical dad, complete with cheesy jokes. Most remarkably, Clint's interaction with the two women was domestically balanced.  He and Laura shared touches, glances, smiles. But Steve also caught Natasha touching the back of Clint's neck and nosing him in passing. Natasha and Laura got along like they were old friends, and the truth is, they probably were; judging by the family pictures, Natasha, Clint, and Laura had carved out their relationship at least nine years ago.
Tony seemed unconcerned with that, just as he seemed unconcerned with meeting African royalty.  He'd met with lots of diplomats in his days.  "It's just a light little brunch. I'll express my sympathy, give condolences... he'll probably fill me in on what's up with their refugee crisis... maybe we'll exchange some numbers, have our people talk... it's not any different than your meetings with Irshad at the UN, really.  Except I guess that we're, y'know, meeting a king. But the Wakandan ambassador to the U.S. will brief us in the car and let us know if we have to kiss his ring or anything weird like that... no, wait, that's the Pope that you have to kiss his ring. Well, whatever, you know what I mean.  ...you know I'm lucky to have you?" said Tony suddenly, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist and lying his head on Steve's back.  "...lots of people never meet their scent-mates. I'm glad I met you. Glad we bonded. Even though it wasn't exactly well planned-out."  He kissed Steve's skin; it was warm. Always warmer than normal.
But that moment never came.
Tony stood between him and Steve, tense, hair up, lip raised.  "Don't
"I have some aspirin in the bathroom, yeah," Steve murmured. He smiled a little, expression and tone soft like he was afraid he might scare Tony off. "I'm going somewhere good," he promised him. "But... I kinda want it to be a surprise. You'll see tomorrow."
"I want you to help me feel him."
"I want Stan," said Tony stubbornly.
"Sssh." Banksy placed a finger over Steve's mouth. "Nonsense. We omegas have got to stick together Steve.  You and me, you and your cousin..."
Phil caught Steve's eye and raised his right pant leg just a little bit, revealing one on his own ankle.
He sat down to wait for Karpov to come get him.
Tony nodded.
, Tony thought frantically, squeezing Steve's hand.
Rutgers:
Steve heard a door click somewhere. "...Tony?"
"Considering your very recent trauma, I find it a little concerning you decided to go to that conference, as well," said Dr. Brennan.  "Being surrounded by a hundred hostile Alphas seems, frankly, self-destructive. I think we need to talk about that."
for soldiers who've just come back from war."
T'Chaka laughed but T'Challa just scowled.
"What's the stuff you guys inject me with, exactly?  Psilocybin or something?" asked Tony curiously.
He squinted at the clock next to the bed.
"Sleep?" repeated Tony, a bit disappointed.  He wasn't that tired. High, yeah, but not tired.  "...I thought you wanted me inside you." He reached between them to pull at Steve's clothes.  "Clint's boring. Why can't Clint just say whatever he needs to on the phone like a normal person?  How come you gotta go to some safehouse? Do you even know where it is? Do you want another blowjob?"
?!) omegas, but there were only two that he could identify as hers.  One male, one woman. They both stood off to the side of the room in heavy collars, watching her reverently, hands clasped in front of them, bodies tense like they were ready to leap to her aid at any moment.  Which they probably were. They didn't look happy, or sad, or anything, really. The intensity of their expressions didn't allow room for any other emotion.
"NINE!" yelled Donner from across the room.
Pepper shot Aria a small smile.  She was finding Tony's efforts to be unexpectedly endearing.  It was more than she could have hoped for, really, especially considering it was early March.
...assuming they let him out of whatever nursing home he was in.

"You mentioned before it was a hard time of year for Tony. How are you coping with it?"
"I'd just like to say one thing..." His voice was scratchy against the mic. "We are people and we are priceless!"
Steve was almost surprised to find he truly meant those words.
He didn't need support.  He had Steve.  What else could a guy ask for, anyway?
It was quiet for a few minutes and then Steve spoke up. "I just...I just realized I haven't wrapped your present yet."
Rex frowned. "You're not...?"
Steve felt bad as he walked over and saw Donner begin to squirm. He was just going to make things worse again. Oh, God. He sighed internally. Why was Donner afraid of
Sure enough, Tony was down in the shop struggling to wrench open the valve on an oxygen tank; he had the wrench fixed and was pulling with his entire body weight on it, the muscles in his arms popping, but he'd been awake all night and exhaustion was starting to set in.  He half-smelled, half-sensed a familiar presence; he looked up to see Steve.
. "I want to do this," he murmured. "It's just-- this is hard."
The girl stared at him with those creepy red-amber eyes, sitting crossed-legged on the bed, her hands weaving an invisible string in front of her.  "...so you're just leaving? You realize he's thousands of miles away?"
Tony plopped down into his office chair; he had an impressively large desk with a vast array of monitors that looked like alien technology to Steve.  "JARVIS?  The records," he called, and on cue, JARVIS brought them up. Over a hundred recordings popped up on screen.
"You said that already," said Happy gently.
Tony groaned as he sat up.  His whole body ached.  Every muscle, joint, tendon, ligament.  There was a stabbing pain behind his eyes. His stomach twisted slightly at the smell of food.
"I am
back then was poor.
Tony grabbed the bowl and began wolfing it down.  In his shop, Tony often treated eating like an unnecessary chore, an interruption to his work.
Steve was still mewling.  Every noise he made hit some weird primal part of Tony's brain; he could've lost an arm and still tried to comply with Steve's wishes.
"Yeah, I'm starving,"he said gratefully, letting Steve start handing him food.  "We've gotta be there, nearly... CHARLIE! HOW MUCH LONGER?"
not changing
"It isn't," Steve admitted. "Someone sent the tickets to make fun of me."
Dan stared; Tony stared back.  For a moment everything was frozen.
The two men stood by while Steve chatted.  Tony wouldn't let go of Steve's hand, so in order for the two of them to have separate conversations, they were twisted at a weird angle, like in some sitcom where two characters had been accidentally handcuffed together.
pressed inside and Steve suddenly felt so overwhelmingly full and so overwhelmingly
"Yes."
"Sit down.  You're distracting us.  Look, he's taking questions."
Tony played with a short strand of Steve's hair, his other hand stroking Steve's back.
Mackenzie looked at his watch.  "It's a bit early for me."
"Perhaps that Captain Rogers is balls-deep in you?" recommended JARVIS.
Steve asked if it was him.
"You know how to play pool, right?" asked Tony to Charlotte, feeling thoroughly anxious that he and Callum were going to get their asses kicked.
By the time Tony got her into the bedroom he'd heard most of her autobiography and was drunk enough not to care.  They tore each other's clothes off with reckless abandon and he practically tossed her onto the bed; their making out was fast and furious and desperate and didn't feel like anything at all.
and other
The man whipped around.  "
Tony wasn't surprised when Steve fell asleep curled up next to him.  Actually, he ended up dozing a little, too, waking up only when JARVIS informed him that the pizza had arrived.
"Tony.  Talk."
"Just read the report." Steve said quietly, all emotion devoid of his voice and then he walked out, feeling Natasha's hand on the small of his back briefly in comfort.
Tony's eyelids were already feeling heavy.  "Yeah... it's got... pretty strong... output... electromagnetically..." he said, struggling to stay awake.  He looked over at Steve.  Sleep was clawing at him, trying to drag him under.  "See you soon, Rogers," he slurred quietly.
"Okay, Nat, I think I see you.  You've got a guy approaching from your southwest but he's distracted, looks like his firearm's jammed up.  Coulson, watch your back, please, two dudes coming at you from the right, around that trellis."
"This isn't a negotiation.  He has my omega and I want him back," said Tony, teeth gritted.
"Even if Tony's in a bad mood, he'll still treat me like a person," Steve said, reaching over to take his Alpha's hand.
"This one's Joan, and this here is Maria," said John.
Maria yanked away, rolled, grabbed her gun, and stood.  She pointed it at Tiberius, eyes red. "Drop him!"
Clint sighed and put his hands on his hips. "Time to confirm it. We each hit a possible base. Find out which one Steve is in, if he is, and make a plan of attack. We only get one shot at this. If they know we're coming they might get a chance to move him before we get him."
wrote Bucky, adding a question mark next to it.
"Yeah, you know, like, teaching Alphas how to... do their thing."  She shrugged a little. "It's not glamorous but I get everything taken care of for me so that's nice, I guess."
"--I'll have Steve call you back okay?  He's having a freak-out. Ciao. Jarv, hang up now... Steve.  He's gonna be okay. We got him out and he's got you and Banksy and George, all great omega role models... he's gonna be fine.  Seriously. Like Gleason said, he just needs perspective, that's all."
"Something big."
Enjoy! - T
had done something wrong. This was so typical.  Right when Steve felt like he was going to grow a damn backbone, he looked at Bucky and just melted.  And the thing was, Steve
"Congratulations," said the bartender.  She gave Steve a little nod.  "...Captain."
him, could it?
Now more people were listening. They were probably expecting some romantic and heartfelt story. Steve wasn't sure if lying was better or being honest was. So he paraphrased:
"Right, right, Morgan!  Morgan, this is Stan, he's my new PA... I know, not as cute as Pepper, but damn, look at these guns, huh?" he said, giving Steve's arm a squeeze.  "He's gonna put Stark Industries out of business, am I right?  Here's your drink back, babe--"  He handed her the empty martini glass.  "--make sure you say hi to Rima for me, she's here too... Rima won the title this year--" he informed Steve.  His words were slurring just the slightest bit; he didn't specify which title.  "--not that I'm saying I won you, obviously, you can't win a person, that's not what I'm saying--"  Tony's mind was a three-ring circus, capable of thinking multiple things at once; he had bounced back to the previous topic but a moment later he was rubbing shoulders with another women in impossibly high heels and impossibly blonde hair.
was not the word Steve would have used to describe them, even before the coffee spill.
But he wasn't supposed to feel pain so he tried to ignore it.
"Well I certainly didn't send my

way tickled him.
If Steve had been a beta, Tony would have praised him for his idea, using the shield.  But he didn't because he didn't want Steve to get the wrong idea about them.  The kiss had meant nothing; it had been impulsive; besides, Steve had been playing Tony, spying on him, for weeks.  Their friendship, brand-new and fragile and just starting to bud, was over, as far as Tony was concerned.
"At least fish and chips hasn't changed since the forties," he said through a mouthful of fries, covering his mouth with his hand.
"...I'm an omega of the past.  But you're the omegas of the future.  And you're going to kick ass," said Steve.
Beneath him, he could feel Steve rubbing himself against the bed; Tony untangled their right hands and reached down to grip him.  Over the last six months he'd grown comfortable touching Steve. He hadn't gone down on him and Steve hadn't asked him to, for which he was grateful.  But jerking off Steve was easy; he jerked himself off all the time, after all. Of course, Steve's anatomy was different. No knot, which Tony had initially found extremely weird.
It still didn't move.
"Hey, yo, Nate!" called one of the boys.
"Hello, everyone, welcome, welcome to the fourteenth annual Omega Auction for Charity..."  More clapping.
Steve sighed. "I think I'm going to focus more on my charity. And maybe start actually asking for things, rather than just raising 'awareness.' Don't think that really did any good... I think it just made me
"No, once again, you're not in trouble.  You're a very good omega," said Tony. His patience was wearing thinner and thinner.
"Nothing," Steve straightened up. "Is there anything else? Would you guys like... coffee, or something?  I'll go to the appointments but I really don't think I need them."
"I don't know," Steve admittedly quietly. "The scientists guessed a lot of things wrong so far. The infertility thing is pretty much confirmed.  But that's okay.  I'm a soldier" He pressed his lips together in a thin line. Did It bother him?
"Mm... well... I was thinking lunch, bed, maybe a little bit of sight-seeing, bed, dinner, bed," said Tony as one of the women placed new cucumber slices over his eyes.  "My end goal is to break my dick."
Steve sighed.
is sufficient.
Happily, a lot of the remodeling was loud, so Tony had a built-in excuse not to talk to Steve.  The more time they spent not talking, the more temporal distance they put between themselves and that kiss, the better.
Steve was still chatting with some reporter.
a fight, people slipped into certain mentalities. Steve himself was guilty of it.  But the guy in front of them now felt like exactly the same man who'd been all shoulder pats and smiles around Steve during their tour a few days ago. And Steve didn't... like it.
Changing a simple bandage on the back of his neck was far more painful than it had any right to be. Steve had clenched his hands tightly in the sheets as the nurse had pulled the bandage back, his knuckles turning white as he fought the urge to let out a sound. After the display he'd just made it was time to toughen up.
"...Steve has to be our top priority.  Not the Winter Soldier," said Sam.
This was different than before. Steve could feel everything in vivid and burning detail. Before it had been like being high, the thrill of being mated sending his mind into overdrive. But now he was so aware of
"Tell Fury I'll call him back later," Steve instructed JARVIS as he stood, not letting go of Tony's hand once he was on his feet. He was still a little shaky on his feet but he wasn't trembling anymore.  He leaned his forehead against Tony's for a minute and let his eyes slip shut, overwhelmed with gratitude for how well his Alpha had dealt with all that.
to him. And if you actually cared about him, just a
"You're wasting your time.  No sense of humor, that one," said Boswell.
He trembled as the tension left his body, both hands down from the headboard now.
"Until then," said Aria, fixing Steve with a look, "We've got a lot of work to go over regarding Project Eighty-Four."
"He's n-not d-dead?"
"Oh, cool, you're singing for your apology?" asked James, aka Doug.
Steve nodded. He sort of felt bad about it. But then she'd never corrected him once when he'd worked for her, although he'd mostly just called her 'Miss Potts.' He glanced sideways at Tony. "This really isn't a big deal, you know."
He blinked.  "...w... what?"
"No, thank you," Steve sighed, standing too.
"Really?" Phil whispered, voice strained.
A sudden, inappropriate memory: when Tony was ten or eleven he remembered reading a comic book series called
Buck was glad, though, glad that their bond was broken, because now, Rogers could have anyone at all he wanted, and that Howard Stark was probably one of the most dominant Alphas Buck had ever met in his entire time.  He hadn't even been aware bonds could break, but Steve had said it himself.  He couldn't even feel him anymore.  And that was for the best too, because now Buck knew exactly why Steve was so furious at him.  For years, he'd been hurting, desperately wanting to be mated, and Buck couldn't do it.  He would rather be the bad guy, rather be hated by his best friend, than risk pregnancy.  A pregnancy would kill him, no doubt, and deep down, Buck was pretty sure they both knew that.
"...obviously," said Tony dryly.  Were omegas also not allowed to drink?  It was like he was on another planet. Was this what it was like for Steve in the forties, being ignored, treated like a pet or a piece of furniture?  "So... the vice president..."
"Swapped," repeated Gleason.
"I think it's time for injection number two," Phil said lightly and moved to open the suitcase.
The way Tony teased at his hole had him practically quivering. Steve was a desperate mess and he couldn't stop letting out small, high-pitched little sounds every time Tony dove back in for more.
interested in Steve Rogers," Brooke interrupted him, her eyes fiery. Steve swallowed. He'd never even considered in his life he could have something like this.  He'd never been on top.  He'd never penetrated anyone. Especially with Tony's past, he'd never let Steve take control like that. Ever. And a part of him had always wondered what it would be like, to actually be with a woman...
They held hands as they walked through the park, the space mostly empty. It was quiet. Peaceful.
Donner shook his head.  "It's not the same kind of auction," he said.
The worst part was that Tony didn't feel at all surprised.  He'd always had a vague suspicion he wasn't
The serum meant both of them had heightened metabolism and a much higher demand for calories, but they didn't have that sort of time. They needed to switch cars within the next twenty minutes. Natasha has taught him well. Although honestly, in all this busy city, they might be quicker on foot.  In any case, there was no time for food, even if Steve was sort of hungry, too.
Probably because Tony was here.
The beta doctor piped up. "We've seen this kind of thing before, once or twice--" She promptly ignored the look Richards and Coulson gave her. "When an Alpha turns up without any context, and unexpectedly-- there's a few explanations we can offer."
It bounced off the wall, bounced off a desk, and then hit the model shield Steve had set on the floor, spinning around it, like a little planet in orbit.
"Love you," he said dreamily, in a sing-song voice, beginning to thrust into Steve's willing form.  He loved how Steve could simultaneously go limp beneath him and also have every muscle tense up.
whether or not they want to be... shot at by Nazis," said Tony haltingly, realizing immediately after he said it how stupid he sounded.  Oh, boy. He was drowning.
A grim sense of smug satisfaction twisted in Steve's gut and he sent Sam a look as if to say
"Oh, nooo...." said Annie.  "This is
"...it occurs to me that, as a guy who was born in nineteen-eighteen, this might be a little overwhelming," said Tony as Happy pulled up to the curb.  A monorail glided above them; below them, a bassline was pounding up through the concrete.  Neon signs were everywhere.
"Everyone loves Banksy, he's a delight" said Pepper, almost dismissively.
"Well, what good is being your godmother if I don't get to embarrass you in front of your mate?  ...I found some old baby pictures--"
He glanced over at Pepper. "So...do they let like, betas and Alphas go to the rallies?" he asked curiously.
"I'd already chosen you," Steve whispered. "Don't forget that Tony. I've been yours for almost a year now..."  Their anniversary was only a few days away.
"According to Mr. Pierce, the WSC gave no orders to your team."
"You people?" repeated Clint.  "...are you
Tony was in the front of the jet.  He had gone from complete hysteria over Steve's death to complete hysteria over Steve's being alive to complete hysteria over discovering that his mark had been mangled by another Alpha, and was currently sitting hunched in a seat not designed for hundreds of pounds of metal exo-suit, sipping a bottle of scotch and staring off into the middle distance.  His nose was bleeding on and off into his beard but didn't seem interested in treatment. He hadn't been able to provide much context about the twins; Clint had been able to give a little bit of information but not more much.
"Well come on then!"
He had never, not in his whole life, or at least in his memory, been in a position to grant anyone anything.  It felt good.
Dr. Brennan looked disapproving.  Being an Alpha, both Steve and Tony sensed it; Tony glanced at her and his neck prickled.  "...you guys can go now," he said dismissively.
Steve slithered off through the crowd, leaving Tony alone in the middle of pounding music and colored lights and warm bodies.  Tony was surprised at how utterly alone he felt.  He was in his own home, surrounded by the most beautiful, rich, intelligent, powerful, and influential people in the world... and yet, he felt nothing.
"Why?  I'm among friends, aren't I?" asked Tony.  He pointed to Pepper.  "Start getting the wheels turning, because we're announcing this charity thing soon.  Steve had ultimate say-so in who he hires, though."  He reached up to pat Steve's bare, damp shoulder, and looked up at him with a fond, almost gooey look.  "So proud of this guy.  ...didn't I pick the best one?"  He leaned his head on Steve's shoulder.  Barefoot, their height difference was noticeable.
And then he kissed him, Steve's hand braced against his chest.  Eyes closed, leaning forward to press their lips together, he let Bucky push his tongue into his mouth and he concentrated as hard as he could.
I called dibs!"
Nothing, he felt, could go wrong in the world, and he looked forward to his and Steve's upcoming second anniversary.
He took the next curve a little sharply.
"Because, erm, we need you to, er... leave? We're clearing out the school."
He tongued the edge of Steve's foreskin delicately, swiping his tongue over Steve's head again before slipping the shaft back into his mouth.  This was easier than Tony's other experience, not just because of the lack of the threat of imminent death, but also because Steve didn't have a knot.  Tony couldn't swallow his whole length but he could take a little more than half which, all things considered, he felt, was a decent amount.
America, I, um- you're- thanks."
"Isn't he something?  Shame it's so hard to find a good one these days."
Tony watched the hotels of Scottsboro pass by longingly from the window of their car.
A woman next to him nodded fervently.  "Ashtray fought against his bond and one year he just didn't show up anymore.  What do you think happened to him, hm? Do you think he went to
He reached down to pull his stiff cock from his boxers, against which it was straining uncomfortably; he watching Steve, stroking himself slowly, enjoying the sight.  He
Flashes came to her, sharp colors and smells and emotions.  And suddenly,
He was almost crying, he realized as he brought a hand up to his face. It was hardly surprising. It was hard to sit there in front of his old mate from inside a cage. It was hard to sit there and hear Bucky say it was his goddamn duty to breed him even if he didn't want it.  It wasn't that he was scared or even sad.  He was furious, indignant, and helpless.  The worst possible combination of emotions.
The car made it past the gates, leaving the crowd far behind them, and they all stumbled out of the car and into the house with mutual sighs of relief. Aria went to go fetch her and Pepper's things from the kitchen before they went out. Happy waited to take them back out again and Bethany wrote down her own number for Steve, giving it him with a small smile.
Clint followed.
"Don't say that, Pietro," she scoffed.  "
"Why don't we go see the lock thing today? You seem most excited about that," Steve said. "Then we can... stay in for the rest of the evening."
"Okay, so, obviously, the main problem is that I don't want them to like, y'know, break anything when they attach!" hollered Tony.  He paused to lower the shield. "I think that's all of them."
"That was before the serum," Steve corrected, sounding proud. And he had been. He remembered strutting all around their apartment with bruised knuckles for a whole week and Bucky being absolutely furious with him (but secretly proud, Steve knew, even if Bucky didn't say it).
. "Donner is okay, for the record. We found him."
Steve handed it Tony. "Drink."
"It was an accident," Steve said with a gentle laugh as he took the offered hand, making sure not to squeeze too tightly as he shook back. Stone appeared to believe him. Or at least, he knew not to press further. "It's a pleasure to meet you too, sir; I've heard a lot about you."
"I'm just saying.  Worst case scenario.  If HYDRA was experimenting on your mate and found out he was your mate... maybe they found a way to recreate parts of him, simulate his smell or something."
Gene got a slow smile and cocked an eyebrow at Tony.  "Oh?"
"That's classified!" Maria announced.
In this chapter: a big announcement, Pepper's origin story, cookie foreshadowing, and the offspring of The Devil in Pink.
"You need to watch less television," she said disapprovingly.
"I literally just said it was not."
Outside of Steve's Westwood apartment, Steve had just turned when his phone went off.
tried to kill me," he said.  He was surprised at how calm his voice was.
Steve was halfway through typing in the words 'blai-' when Tony said those three simple words. He blinked in surprise and something fluttered in his chest as he watched Tony's lips move over his hand...exploring. He felt his cheeks turn pink again but for an entirely different reason than they did before.
"Oh, I wouldn't say that.  At the very least, Erskine and Stark and the SSR saw something in him... that's why they injected him with the serum in the first place," said Cece, stirring her drink.
It was paying off now, though, because Tony was discovering most of the materials he needed lying around the shop.  He gutted one of his bots for parts and tore apart his desk searching for components, slowly building a pile in the center of the room.  The collision point would go
The witch watched him curiously. There was no malice in her eyes, not like the man's.
.  Surely Tony understood he couldn't remain cooped up like this forever.
to look to him. What were these people looking to Steve for now? Photographs?
"Hi, Daddy.  Win anything good?" asked Piper sweetly to Eric.
Gleason appeared remarkable quickly, with a large bag under his arm, as Steve was tearing his way through the waffles Aria had made. He didn't have the patience to put toppings on. He just ate them as they were but he seemed delighted with them anyway. "I'm too hot," he whined.
"Don't supposed it's too late to fool around a little?" asked Tony hopefully, closing the door behind them.
His heart was hammering.  "Wait, it's over? ...but... but... we won, right?"
"Oh you did look so silly with those little wings on your face. Did Philip ever give you that outfit back?"
Of course there was some bad stuff.  Speculation on which Alpha was dominant.  Plenty of forums and boards where people called Tony a homo.  He'd expected that.
"Hal is my real name!" protested Hal, looking a bit offended.
"Oh, Lord," said Maria, hands flying up to her face.
"Thought he was Russian, though, not German."
Against the wall, Pepper watched with a sigh.  "...I feel like I'm chaperoning a high school dance."
," commanded Pepper.
They were over the Atlantic and if there was one thing Tony needed at that moment, it was a drink.
touch his arms?" he asked, almost in a whisper.
He swallowed and looked over.  Steve was standing there.  Steve, the omega Tony desperately, desperately wanted to be good enough for.
Steve mumbled something about sleep and Tony felt like that was the most brilliant idea he'd ever heard.  He wanted to sleep so badly; his whole body was screaming for it.
He glanced up.  He was looking into a mirror.  His eyes were wide.  His skin was pale.  He had a beard.  He was wearing a vintage t-shirt, from '78.  His lucky shirt.
Apparently
For just a split second, he'd been worried, worried they were going to end up with a kid and a hard decision to make.  Tony didn't need anyone to tell him that Steve, despite his progressive stance on omega rights, would probably think about it long and hard before he terminated an embryo.
"I mean 84! Not Donner... I mean, I'm sure he's lovely, but the poor thing's not quite all there, is he?" Banksy sounded sympathetic but not surprised. He wasn't in shock like Steve had been at first.
"...yes, fine, whatever fancy stupid water you want.  March!" barked Pepper. The two of them staggered out of the bathroom together, drawing a confused look from a stagehand who was going in.
Steve hesitated.  "...no," he said, because he felt he could at least tell Clint that much without breaking Barney's trust.
...but he'd felt good enough!  ...sort of!  Granted, he'd known he wasn't well enough to have Bucky's whelps and had been guilty every time he got sick, which was often, because then Bucky had to take care of him and make his own meals and iron his own shirts but--
"Raise," said Malick, across from Tony.  He threw a collar down. "Two nights. ...that's more than fair, isn't it, Stark?  Two for one?"
"Aw, geez, it's been years since I learned this... uh... okay, so there's two genes.  The LMG-1 gene carries a dominant allele for being a beta and a recessive allele for being either an omega or an Alpha, and the LMG-2 gene can shut off the allele for beta expression, but I... I think it's recessive?"
"I think we just have to let this run its course," said Pepper, frowning.
He was starting to warm up to the idea of going to a workshop, if only so that he could take off his collar and air the back of his neck for an hour.
forget a condom?
The contents were telling.  Tony learned that Steve was one of those people that put bread in the refrigerator and that he preferred whole milk.  Tony closed it and wandered over to a bookshelf to start reading the titles.  It was like a Museum of Steve and Tony's curiosity was piqued.  He explored with the sort of unapologetic, naked interest of a child.  The whole place smelled like Steve.  Tony was happy here.  Every little detail made him happy, with the possible exception of the picture of the guy on the door of the fridge.
Steve's fists were balled up around the couch's fabric, threatening to tear it.  Tony let go of one of Steve's wrists and slipped his hand under Steve's stomach, finding his erection and wrapping a hand around it, jerking Steve in rhythm to his thrusts, Steve's precum warm and slippery on his skin.
"Pleasure to meet you. Hi. Hi." Steve shook everyone's hands and grinned when Judy gave him a wink. "I was hoping maybe I could help with some of the setting up. I saw you were still putting some tents up at the other end and I'm pretty good at heavy lifting. Oh! And I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch your name?"
He demanded an Eldritch knot on his tie from Pepper and spent at least fifteen minutes playing with Steve's hair.  Tony had strong feelings on hair; he spent an inordinate amount of time on his every morning, sometimes up to thirty minutes, and that didn't even include trimming his goatee.  Tony had spent ages in the bathroom grooming himself and had even asked Steve to shave, even though Steve, being an omega and blond, only shaved once a month, tops, and rarely grew anything more than a fine, downy fuzz that couldn't really be called a beard at all.
...it was Steve.
"No, his
Steve imagined that Gleason had repeated that speech a lot through out his life to many different Alphas. He knew that Tony's probing came from a place of concern on his behalf, but Gleason had to no doubt deal with many skeptical Alphas who questioned his credibility all the time. His confidence was reassuring. Steve offered Tony a small smile before he moved to sit down, Gleason standing as he did so.
"Correct, sir," said JARVIS.
Even though he wasn't crazy about all the visitors, he knew Steve needed the interaction.  Steve was getting cabin fever, being cooped up in the house, even as large as it was. He spent long hours in the home gym and more than once, Tony had found him pacing around.  Steve's metabolism meant he ate more and slept less and was often twitchy with energy. Tony didn't complain when Sam came by, knowing that Steve was desperate to keep working out.  Sadly, though, he doubted Steve got much by running alongside Sam; Steve didn't wear out like normal people. In one week alone, he destroyed every punching bag in the house, including Happy.
Tony leaned over the DJ table in his suit, face plate down, addressing the crowd with a sort of casual smugness that was only validated by how entranced they all were by him.
sorry."
He rolled off of Steve so quickly he rolled off the couch and onto the floor with a thud.
Tony's face broke into a huge smile at Steve's sleepy, heavy accent.  He loved it when Steve accidentally slipped up and dropped the G off of his verbs, spat out hard consonants and elongated his As.  He loved when Steve sometimes blurted something like you'd hear in an old noir movie, calling someone a punk, or saying something was swell.  Not to mention the occasional "gee!" or "applesauce!"
is going to have any trouble getting to Washington."
"The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium," announced JARVIS.
Steve groaned quietly. "I
"Does it occur that I don't want you to die because of me to prove a point? If you'd had the suit with you, it would be different," Steve conceded. "But what if he had
"...see?  See how you inspire people?  She was an omega, too," murmured Tony into Steve's ear, his breath hot.  He nuzzled against the side of Steve's face.  "...so... proud..." he whispered, barely audible, his fingers ghosting along Steve's collarbone.
your birthday... but one of our nights here I am going to get you to dance, just so you know," he warned him playfully.
It was Natasha calling. He answered. "Nat? Hm?" He tried to sound normal, like he hadn't been impaled on Tony's dick about ten seconds ago. "What is it?" Steve asked. "Now isn't a good time..."
Bucky shook his head adamantly.
"Did no one ever teach you any of this?  You're forty years old, Tony.  You two are obviously scent-mates.  Just accept it."
He followed the setting sun until he hit the beach.  Then he just stood there.
"My Steve."
"You know I haven't spoken with any of those guys since," Haley said, sipping at her wine. As a waiter passed as she grabbed a glass of champagne off of a tray and handed it to Steve. "They were all kind of assholes."
Suit was on.  Charged.  Ready to rock and roll.
"I respect you as an omega," said Tony diplomatically.  He wasn't sure if he could respect Steve as a captain.  He wasn't a military man and he treated Rhodey like crap most of the time.  Tony loathed taking orders; Pepper could attest to that.  Tony liked doing things his own way, and he always had.  Maybe that was part of the problem.  Tony rarely got told "no."
"Oh my God. I
"Go ahead and cum, and then I'll clean you up," said Tony, dragging his tongue slowly up Steve's vent, up his balls, up his shaft, letting him know exactly
"The serum took our mark away," Steve murmured. "But I had a scan. It's still
, Pepper--"
Champagne and drinks were passed around whilst Gleason delicately took Steve aside. The doctor sank down onto one of the sofas in the next room heavily. He looked tired. Steve would offer him a bed but he knew from experience that David would insist on driving home. His partner left for work early in the mornings and they didn't like the kids waking up in an empty house.
The front door opened and Tiberus walked in, directly onto the "set."
"JARVIS, don't you dare!" shouted Pepper.  Could she gag her boss?  Too late.  She hadn't known Tony had a lockdown mode that was kept secret from her and she would have felt hurt if she wasn't dealing with their current crisis.
"But they can't... they can't believe
"Tony?  Tony?" prompted Maria gently.  "Would you like something to drink?"
"It's about to get worse," said Happy, looking up at them from the rear view.  "Ready?"
The one he had was running on nothing.  If the levels of toxicity it was dumping into his blood was any indication, it had already suffered heavy neutron damage before powering the suit.  The thing was probably a wreck now.  Tony needed to change it immediately, needed to get back to the shop and fix it.
After a moment, he mumbled, "...you smell different.  Since..." He trailed off.
, behave yourself," said Pepper after a moment.
A bad feeling panged in his chest as Tony sat down and watched TV, his back turned to him. There had been a moment for a second - a moment when potentially he thought they might talk, connect in some way but then it was gone, over, the opportunity lost.
Tony drove north, eyes blank.  The radio was still on but he couldn't hear it.  He was on autopilot.  He barely registered anything the entire drive, parking in the circular driveway, locking the car automatically, walking into his home with a steady stride.
"Well... that's HYDRA," said Sam with a small shrug.  She hummed in agreement and the two of them lapsed into silence for the rest of the flight.
"Yes, Tony, I know," she said wearily.  It was late.
"Whoa-- hey!  Steve!" protested Tony as Steve began dumping flowers all over the floor.  "What the hell, that's a hybrid gemstone orchid, are you cra--"
Eric's hand flew up.  "Giving the initial incentive," he recited.
"Oh my God!  Steve! Be careful; lay back down; you're-"
The only fly in the ointment was that Dr. Gleason still hadn't called.  Now that it was less than a week from Christmas, Tony was officially getting worried.  Steve's last heat had come on hard and fast, and he was due for another one soon. Tony had been trying just not to think about it, but it loomed over him, its presence increasingly threatening.
Pepper frowned at her tablet.  The first negative story had finally surfaced, courtesy of Vice:
"No, no, in theory, you could impregnate an omega with a turkey baster!  Knotting is just more fun," said Richard, grinning, and the audience laughed.
"Rogers," said Fury, with a calm, level voice.  "Don't turn around.  There's a couple of men on the balcony across from us.  How well do you know your neighbors?"  His hand was slowly moving toward his pocket.
Oh, please.  There's nothing SHIELD can toss at me that I haven't already gone through.  I just want to make sure we're doing this on
Pepper turned to Donner.  "Make sure you're only drinking the chamomile tea.  The Darjeeling and Oolong has caffeine in it. Bad for the baby."  She turned on her heel and walked out.
After dinner they were given coffee and hot chocolate (or in some people's cases, more drinks).  The drinks remained light.  There were no mixes or hard liquors; the omegas were only allowed champagne and dessert wines.  Still, better than nothing.  Some of them (including Lola and Fred) had managed to get fairly tipsy.
"Your Alpha would really get pissy if we went to the gym? You've been
Steve walked her to the other side of the room. "Don't try to touch me again."
"Bingo.  Obviously, the omega needs to know what's in it for them to behave.  Personally I recommend pressure points. The three basic pressure points on an omega are over the arvicolina, on the back of the neck, and on the two scent glands just behind the ears, near the junction of the jaw and the skull."
Bucky felt slightly annoyed.  The exhibit was talking at him and he was missing valuable information.
"What I do outside work isn't your business."
-" Steve's breath hitched as Tony pressed inside of him, and his arms curled up on instinct to pull his Alpha closer, one leg hooking around him with his heel pressing into the small of his back. Steve let out a high-pitched please sound and let his head fall back against the sofa as he rocked back with him.
background check.  You know it's a felony to hack into a national security database and forge data?"
Karpov sat with him until he fell asleep.  The Winter Soldier was a shaking, drooling mess.  Karpov brushed his hair off his face, feeling an almost paternal affection, mixed with disgust.  Years of delicate programming, undone in an instant. His obedient, loyal soldier, reduced to this.  And still, Stark was alive, Rogers was inaccessible, and they were no closer to their objective than before.
"I don't think you're capable of behaving yourself," Steve hummed, trailing a few fingers down Tony's chest. He shivered as the other trace over the scar, now even more prominent ever since the mess of the inducer on the HYDRA base. He nudged their noses together gently and then ducked his head down to nip his bottom lip. Steve smiled against his mouth. "But I like you that way."
Natasha appeared in the doorway looking stoic, hands clasped in front of her. She walked up to Tony and Steve but kept to a safe distance, knowing Tony could easily get defensive right now. She looked over at Tony, meeting his gaze.
"No he's not. You've got me."
Bucky checked his reflection in a window pane on the way out.  His skin did have an unhealthy waxiness to it, to be honest.
They must have tried to stop Karpov from leaving.  He'd been trained by the KGB; the poor fools had probably never stood a chance.
Well, technically it was-- but Steve didn't really deserve it.
"What about before, your other Alpha, huh?  Weren't you good for him? Did he let you go?" asked DeSoto.  Everyone knew Steve had been previously, or was currently, bonded to another Alpha.  "...is it hard having two Alphas? If they give you two different orders do you pick the one with the stronger bond or what?"  He seemed genuinely interested. "...Mr. Stark isn't very dominant," he added, unnecessarily.
"Yeah, that's because he's a ghost Pokemon.  He evolves from Haunter," explained Cooper.
"Love you too," Steve panted out, his own cock hard and pressed into the sheets. He would make a mess of them no doubt but they'd been replaced many times before (because of both sex and that time Steve got shot.) The friction of each thrust almost burned and he thrived on it.  "Fuuck," Steve gasped softly, eyes rolling back as Tony pressed inside of him. He shivered at the stretch and took it well, clenching around him invitingly as he lazily rocked back into Tony's thrusts. "Tony. Yes, that's-" fingers curled over his own, almost pinning him down as he curled and squirmed at the touch.
"Camo washes me out, though," said Tony, jogging across the now-empty courtyard to turn the bodies over.  He checked them both over.  "Fuck.  Neither of these guys has an access card.  Sorry, Romanov."
"Yes, well, technically I'm ninety," Steve pointed out impatiently.
"What's in the box?" asked Tony eagerly, slipping his hands over Steve's, tonguing the hollow of his throat.
"I'm okay," Steve whispered and finally let his gaze drift back to Tony's face. He swallowed. "I just...I just..."  He reached up and his fingertips ghosted over Tony's cheek. "I just wanna be good for you," he whispered.
Steve gave the camera the most shit-eating-grin imaginable.
Tony let out a wheezing gasp of pain and managed to gag "
DeSoto nodded his head against Tony's leg, his fingers reaching up to caress the fabric of Tony's slacks.  Again, Tony resisted the urge to slap him away.
, he thought.  As if sucking Captain America's dick in his garage wasn't already kind of bonkers.
The butler was trying to look small and inconspicuous as he swept up the soil from the plant Tony had overturned.  In part because it was his job, but also because, as an Alpha, Tony's pheromones were ones of pure aggression.  If the president or the vice president hadn't been betas, Tony would have considered simply leaving.  He was teetering on the brink of ferality.  But he wasn't about to lose it, not here, anyway.  Steve had a dream and God damn it, they were going to fulfill that dream.
