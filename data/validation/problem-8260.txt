Steve looked at him quizzically.  “I’ve what?”
Tony weaved his way through the crowd, ignoring the looks he got from other party-goers for deserting the bride on the dancefloor.  He shot a quick text to Rhodey to wish him luck with the blonde Air Force colonel he was talking up at the bar before ducking out of the reception.
“Don’t get mad,” Tony said quickly, which was probably the wrong thing to do because Steve went from looking perplexed to distressed in a record-breaking 0.25 seconds. “I need you to hear me out before you jump to any conclusions, all right?”
“Of course, not,” Tony lied through his teeth. “That’s a ridiculous notion and, quite frankly, a terrible idea.”
Steve spends the rest of the night scrubbing the scent of magnolias and vanilla off his skin.
After all, the mansion is only a few blocks away, and it’s a beautiful night.
“I’m merely seeing things as they are,” Tony said, resolutely. “I haven’t been doing anything except delaying…
“And men,” Bruce repeats, “raving about how ‘hot’ you are, and ‘
to suppress his grin. “It’s sweet, Tony.”
Tony looked at him worriedly. “What?  Is it too much?”
“Enjoying yourself?”
The room was a comfortable temperature, Tony always made sure of that, but there were some nights where Steve could still feel the chill of the ice deep in his bones.  The episodes were random at best, and occurred much less frequently than when he had first woken from the ice, but that didn’t make them any easier to endure.
be under the impression that you two are engaged.”
Steve sighed.
“Now you’re Tim Gunn all of a sudden?”
, Ty—”
you,” Steve replied.
The fact that Steve truly believes he isn’t important to Tony hurts, and Tony knows he has no one to blame for that but himself.  Tony’s spent his entire life building walls to keep others at a distance, believing that he couldn’t get his heart broken if he didn’t let anyone near it in the first place.
When the team re-convened in the middle of all of the wreckage, Tony had opened up a compartment in his armor and pulled out a bag of licorice.
“Oh, no,” Tony said with a groan. “You’re going for a metaphor now, aren’t you?”

Steve started up the shower and went over to the sink to brush his teeth as he waited for the water to heat up.
“Why is there a life-size marble bust of Natasha in the hallway?”

The kiss never deepens, but Tony finds himself clutching at Steve’s shoulders, his arms, any part he can touch.  If this is all they’re going to have left, then Tony wants to remember the feeling of having Steve near him.
“This is gonna be a thing, isn’t it?” Sam says with dread. “As adorable as you two are, I don’t think I can handle watching you guys do
, he said—but he also told me about your kindness and your compassion,” she added. “Your ability to see the best in others—”
There was more to Tony Stark than just his standoffish exterior: beneath the mask was a man who always went above and beyond what was ever needed or expected of him.  He was a man who didn’t have very many friends, but revered the ones that he
Tony doesn’t realize he’s shaking until he feels Steve’s arms around his shoulders, steadying him like an anchor.  He’s murmuring something into Tony’s ear, but Tony can’t make anything of it.
already did.”
Because Steve isn’t sure what to make of his discovery, so he does what any reasonable person would do: he asks.
“I… have no idea what you’re talking about,” Tony says stubbornly.
Steve is 25 when he becomes Tony’s first in every
Tony sighed dejectedly.  “Steve, I’m not the healthiest person around, and I never really have been.  Considering everything I’ve put my body through over the years, it’s a wonder I’m alive and talking to you
“So…"
be,” Steve insists. “It’ll only be until my ma’s bills are paid off.”
“Yep.”
He finds it funny that the place where his life really started is going to be where it ends.
“Why do you ask?”
Even now, as they’re standing in the middle of the dance floor, Tony is hyperaware of Steve’s hand in his, and he idly wonders what it would be like to brush his thumb over Steve’s finger and feel the smooth metal of a ring there.
… and we know that we’ll never be able to pay you back, but—”
“You want a distraction; I want an escape,” Steve states.  “And I’m a man in my twenties with a stressful job and a lot of pent-up frustration. I have needs.”
Steve responds with a pointed look.
The kiss had started out innocently enough, but then Tony raised his hand to clutch at Steve’s robe and draw him closer, and it seemed that was all the permission Steve needed to deepen it.  One of Steve’s hands settled on Tony’s waist while the other cupped Tony’s face, gently urging him to tilt his head.  Tony obliged, barely registering that Steve had pulled away before the man slotted their mouths together again.
“Best night,” Tony said, cutting him off with a chaste kiss. “Ever.”
“Hm?” Tony was still too dazed from the kiss to think properly.  He opened his eyes—he didn’t even know when he had closed them in the first place—and saw that Steve was blushing.
“I’ve been away at boarding school since I was eight,” Tony informs.  He takes a seat in the middle of the king-sized bed.  “I went straight to college after that, and I couldn’t exactly slip in the fact that I like cock into a two minute phone conversation.”
Admittedly, it had taken a bit of time for the two of them to finally got over their egos and actually start
“Nope,” Tony says sincerely. “Everything’s perfect.”

.”  Tony knew it was petty, but he was already well aware of the age gap between him and Steve.  He really didn’t need any additional reminders of the fact.
“I can hear y’thinking,” Steve muttered a minute later.
“No, it’s okay,” Steve replied. “I’d rather not have any alcohol in my system for whenever you guys decide to interrogate me.”
“There is only one explanation for why Tony did what he did,” Thor said, “And it’s because he believes you are worth it, even if you do not believe it yourself.”
Steve seems to hesitate before answering: “There aren’t a lot of people I trust.”
Thor turned away from the painting to face Steve. “You are gifted in the arts?” he inquired.
“Why would I want to see him?” Steve asked, even as he pulled the sheets off of his body and swung his legs over the side of the bed.  Was he really that predictable?
“What?  It’s better than 'Jim,’” Tony defended.  He scratched behind the cat’s ear again. “What do you think?  Do you approve?” Tony asked, getting another purr in response.
“And now I’m back home safe and sound,” Tony countered.
“Tony—”
So Tony talks about what he did after Steve left for work.  He talks about what he had for breakfast (oatmeal and berries), and an article in a scientific magazine that he, Bruce and Hank had gotten into a heated debate over.  He talks about his plans for a new suit of armor, the upgrades he made to the quinjet, and the forty-five minutes he spent on his hands and knees picking up the hundreds of nuts and bolts that Dummy dropped on the floor.
Tony straddles the other man’s lap and licks a stripe of frosting off of his cheek. “And you are absolutely delicious.”
“You?  Steve Rogers, Captain America,
“The drink itself is not what inebriates the drinker.   The drink merely adjusts itself to the drinker’s desires: it will not do anything that you do not want it to,” Thor explains.
Steve is 25 when Hill gives him the number of a new client.
"It’s Tony Stark!"
“Yeah?”
in Steve’s eyes, he finds it very hard to care.

, and it's a nice distraction from the airheaded party-goers.
star named after him.
It’s nearly four in the morning, and Tony can’t sleep.
It’s a Saturday—one of those extremely rare nights where he has no (pressing) obligations—and he can’t think of a better way to spend it than in his church.
“You two have been stepping out together for quite some time now, and Natasha mentioned something about—”
“What kind of Avenger would I be if I can’t even protect my own friends?” Tony asks, pained.
initiating things.”
know it.
“Me?” Tony feigns shock. “Why, I would never!”
Steve looks drunk out of his mind.  His face is red, and lips swollen from their kissing, and Tony still gets a thrill from the knowledge that he’s the cause of it.  ”Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?”
Tony desperately tries to make sense of the entire situation: the last thing he had been expecting when he woke up this morning was a proposal, let alone a
“Tony?” Steve called out, his voice laced with concern.
“Look,” Tony said, resigned. “I thought I could make it work with Pepper, but that just blew up in our faces.”

“You’ve had her here for almost two weeks now,” Steve states.
…but kisses were usually reserved for people who had feelings for each other—for people who were in
“Steve,” Tony tried again. “I’m always here for you.”
Still, Tony sits back and watches as Steve’s hair and face are touched up before being shoved in front of the camera.

“You told me you
Steve’s just walking through the front door of his apartment an hour later when his phone chimes with a simple, one-word text message:
Between the shouting, and the bright lights, the police storming into the room, and his kidnappers crying on the floor, Tony felt like he was in the scene of a movie.
Tony huffs, and his eyes crinkle.  They sort of sparkle when he smiles like that; it’s amazing.  Tony is one of the most attractive people Steve’s ever met. “You’re
.  Maybe he really likes our coffee,” Tony lamely suggests.
“You have a couch, right?  A floor?” he offered. “Hell, I’ll even sleep in the bathtub.”
Tony didn’t know if the Doombots had some sort of personal vendetta against Steve’s clothes that night, but he really couldn’t give a damn with Steve’s perfect physique staring him in the face.
“What?”
“You really tensed up, I just—”
“I already apologized,” Steve growled, hackles rising as Tony started shouting again. It was like the engineer couldn’t have a rational discussion. At least the rain was cutting through all of the tension in the air. “I didn’t realize I needed to ask permission to look for my friend. Or do you want to collar and track me like SHIELD did?”
"Was that really necessary?" Steve says, looking down at the mess on his chest.
Steve smiled triumphantly. “That’s what I thought.  Oh, here’s the cat!” he said excitedly as it approached. “Hey, fella.  Wanna say ‘hi’ to Tony?”
“C’mon, Rogers,” Tony badgered. “Have a little faith.  Flirting is easy.  Anyone can learn it.”
Tony shook his head.  “No, you see,
“I like it,” Thor confessed, to the surprise of no one in the room.
“And you can call me ‘Joseph,’” the King adds. “Stephen has told us so much about you.  It is nice to finally put a face to the name,” he says, and it feels like a weight is lifted off Tony’s shoulders.
Steve staggers back. “What did you say?”
be a disappointment?”
Tony, however, had never sought solace from a bottle, instead choosing to immerse himself in his work.
Tony eyed the plate cautiously. “Uh, I don’t…”
Tony reached forward, taking Steve’s hand in his and lacing their fingers together. “I’d rather without it, if that’s okay with you,” he said.
Tony pulls back enough to look him in the eye. “Me?”
“Then it’s settled,” Bruce interrupted, giving Tony a look that dared him to say otherwise. “Steve’s going with Tony.”
“That’s what you get when you build up something your head. Trust me, she doesn’t bite. Well, unless you ask.”
“Yeah, go ahead and send them down.”  Tony turns back to Steve.  “Seriously Steve, keep the tech.  You are in desperate need of an upgrade, and that flip phone hurts my soul.  Besides, if you’re not great with computers, you’re exactly the type of beta tester we need!  We have to make sure these models are user friendly and powerful.”
Tony breaks first.  “She’s not wrong,” he concedes.  “We sort of have been, just not the type of dating that I have any experience with but possibly might like, considering how everything has gone so far even though I still don’t know if that counts as
At long last, Tony speaks.  “This is a horrible decision.”
It seemed pointless to deny it after that; actually, it was somewhat of a relief to have someone know about his double life.  They quickly settled into a pattern of sorts, where they’d meet once or twice a week to practice maneuvers they’d most likely see in battle.  Natasha got plenty of practice being propelled off of his shield, and Steve learned how to block a few of her most common kicks.  Only a few, though.  He doubts he’ll ever be able to best her entirely without relying on his enhanced reflexes.
He fully expects Steve to reject him, which is why it’s so surprising when Steve says yes.  Well, in for a penny…
Steve can’t help but think that it must be nice to have the option, to hold that name in your mind and be able to whisper it in private moments. “Still, it seems so formal when you know his name.”
“Stay back!” Steve warns.
“What the hell?”  Stark’s shocked voice emanates from somewhere on his left and Steve breaths a sigh of relief.  The inventor’s a bit dirty and his hands are fanning smoke away from his eyes, but he looks relatively unharmed.
“It’s wonderful!” Steve gushes, eager to steer away from the topic of windows that shouldn’t be breakable.  “I found that newspaper article you told me about, and I was able to read the whole thing, and after I finished, the computer started recommending other articles I might like to read.  It really is great.”
It takes him far longer than it should to recover from Steve’s dramatic exit.  Well, it wasn’t really that dramatic.  It was just a kiss, on the cheek no less, something that hundreds of people have done over the past four decades.  Still, it’s something else when it’s coming from Steve.
Steve clings to the broken parts of Tony’s answer, hoping desperately that he’s interpreting those fragments correctly.  “Yes,” he answers cautiously, “now.  Like you said, an alien invasion does sort of prompt you to reconsider your life choices.”
Steve gathers himself, trying desperately to ensure this meeting goes better than their last.  “Mr. Stark, I think we got off on the wrong foot – ”
Tony’s brain immediately translates:
thinking about Steve straddling the leather and chrome of a Harley and zooming through the streets of Manhattan.
Just say no, he tells himself.  Spare yourself the misery and just say no.
“Not everything’s that clear-cut.  I think they’re going to try to restore the ones that aren’t in pieces and then seek donations for the empty pedestals.  I thoroughly expect the mayor’s office to come knocking any day now.”  Because clearly, he doesn’t have enough things to pay for.
“I kind of sensed that.” It comes off sharper than he intends.
“So I heard you got a bit of a show this morning.”
, and all of those things come together to make one lust-inducing yet eternally unavailable paragon of human perfection.  If he’s going to be wallowing around in angst and self-loathing, then dammit, he should be getting sex out of it:  mind-blowing, athletic, slightly-guilty Steve sex with kinky foreplay and feeling-laced orgasms.  Instead, he’s living the life of a fourteen-year-old girl who’s nervous about going to second base.  (At least, he assumes this is what fourteen-year-olds do; at that age, he was already at MIT, and his ‘dates’ involved a not-insignificant amount of alcohol and other such substances.)  And, unfortunately for him, actually getting to second base will ruin everything.
“Oh.” It’s an oddly flat retort. “Yeah, I don’t mind. Press conferences and stuff,” she mumbles.
“Nice try, Captain, but I’m a lot harder to get rid of than that.”
“What would I even say?”
“But none with the transport capabilities of a Helicarrier.  How is SHIELD supposed to monitor a crisis of they can’t provide adequate technical support?  Without the best possible equipment, they can’t keep a situation from escalating.”
“I'm self-aware enough,” she begins, “to admit that I’m far from a pleasant person when I'm showboating in public. That woman is a deliberately obnoxious persona. The few times that we've interacted when I haven't been wearing the suit, you get out of my presence as soon has possible. Not to mention the fact that I actually know what you look like when you're happy. So whatever this is that you're trying to pull, this secret torch deal? Complete and utter bull shit!”
“The thing is,” Tony starts slowly, “when something like this happens, you can’t help but stop and reevaluate everything.  Everything you think you know gets thrown up into the atmosphere and you can’t help but wonder where the pieces are going to fall when they hit the earth.”
smack dab in the middle of New York City.
“Once you go Stark you never go back,” he answers.  On reflection, that statement sounded slightly less pervy in his head.  Moving on.
This time it’s his turn to pull Tony in, so grateful that his brilliant, stupid man is
“Well, we wouldn’t want that.  It took me two weeks to get here.”
” he says, voice rising.  “I’m pretty sure that’s the literal definition of an Act of God.  So by all means, go ahead.  I’d love to see Fury try to argue breach of contract.  Plus, it’s not exactly the best idea to piss off the guy you’re asking to build your engines.”
“I’ve read your file.” Fury pulls a thick file folder off his desk, cracks it open, and starts to read. “Seven attempts to enlist under false pretenses, which is illegal, by the way. Moving behind enemy lines, against direct orders on an unsanctioned rescue mission with commandeered government property and civilian backup. No, Cap, somehow, I don’t think you’d have a problem fudging the truth to get what you need. As far as I can tell, you spend most of your time either down in the gym beating up your problems or locked in your room. So, this whole well-adjusted thing you’re trying to sell? I’m not buying it.”
“Food!”

"Do we know the connection?"
Natasha sits up a little bit against her cushions "Serves them right. Honestly, this whole thing is beyond ridiculous. The one time I actually get shot, and it happens in street clothes. At a
When she charges toward him, he honestly doesn’t know what to expect. It almost seems as if she’s going to attack him, but he honestly doesn’t know what level of harm she could inflict outside the suit. He throws up his arms to shield his face, if necessary, but she stops a few inches in front of him. Her hands keep going though, past his face and around his neck and —
His evening just got a lot less relaxing.
Steve made his way into the lab, his habitual messenger bag still slung over his shoulder.
“What?”
“She’s bringing the statues to life.  The first calls that came in reported that the Central Park Pilgrim was marching around the conservatory.”
“You like him?” she repeats, although her tone is loaded with patent disbelief.
– but he doesn’t.  Being Tony Stark is dangerous enough, as evidenced by the whole kidnapping, ransom, illicit arms smuggling saga, but being Iron Man seems exponentially more dangerous.  He lives and works in a tower with his name on it for Christ’s sake!  Why not send hand engraved invitations to the Villain of the Month?
Amazingly, the lighting seems to have no effect on whatever it is they’re fighting.  Instead of being electrocuted or fried by Thor’s astonishingly bright bolt, the creature seems to be
Tony snorts, “It’s like you know me.”
“Fair enough. All right, let’s do this.” Natasha grabs the remote and seamlessly navigates to whatever movie is next in his and Iron Man’s digital queue. Steve lets her, used to ceding the television controls to his more tech-savvy friend since Iron Man is an admitted remote hog. He wonders how that shakes out between the two of them.
Tony’s smile is equally brittle, but he tries.  “Have you gotten ‘Time heals all wounds’?”
“Mr. Stark, those Helicarriers are essential to a lot of people.”
Steve’s throat muscles work, trying to clear the obstruction.  He chokes out a few weak coughs, eyes still cast down toward his clenched fist, before sputtering, "You can't be serious."
Steve cocks an eyebrow.  “Be serious, Tony.”
Tony, not JARVIS supplies the answer.  “All of Stark Tower draws its power from the arc reactor in the subterranean levels.  We’re independent of the city’s power grid, so we’re still running at one hundred percent.”  Tony stands, gazing out the dark swath below.  “I don’t understand.  What’s causing all of this?”
, like what even
So Steve may have staged a little intervention later that night, politely requesting that Tony go see a doctor to make sure that the excessive amounts of sugar weren’t affecting his body. Tony agreed, but not without a dramatic sigh and roll of his eyes. The next afternoon, he had walked into the kitchen with a very smug look on his face, and slapped a piece of paper in front of Steve declaring that he had a clean bill of health.
“Shut it, Wilson,” Steve admonishes.
Tony nodded, taking that as an invitation to approach the bed—and really, how was it fair that their room only had one bed while Natasha’s had
“Rover,” Steve repeated. “I like it.”
“All right,” Bruce said, setting the turkey at the center of the table. “Dinner is served.”
“Wha—Oh, uh, yeah.  I
Like their namesake, the stars are an ideal—a constant in Tony’s life, guiding him and steering him in the right direction.  They’re something that Tony can aspire to be, but a status that he doesn’t believe he’ll ever be able to attain.
Tony scowled.  “And why not?  He’s such a mother hen; why is
JARVIS chimed in.
He and Steve were perfect complements, constantly keeping each other in check on the battlefield and off.  They grounded each other, never afraid to knock each other down a peg or two when necessary.  He and Steve could engage in a shouting match that nearly ended in physical blows in the morning and be perfectly fine by night, lounging in the living room and laughing at absolutely nothing.
“Whatever you want,” Tony promised.  He didn’t hurry, but he managed to thrust harder, getting impossibly deeper inside Steve.
“Then lie,” Tony said simply. “Keep doing it, and hopefully, one day, you’ll actually believe it.”
"What if they’re a serial killer or something?" Tony asks, straightening his tie in the mirror.
After missions, Steve tells Tony exactly what he wants to do to him by tapping morse code onto the armor, which results in some very uncomfortable and painful debriefings (but mind-blowing

Steve shrugged.  “Occasionally… I mostly just sketched, or worked with charcoal.  Paints were expensive—still are—but moreso back then.”
“I mean,
“You really wanna start talking about recklessness now?” he dared.
“Why aren’t you resting? You’re going to pull your stitches or… or something,” Tony said, his voice lacking any heat.  He wanted to be angry, but in truth, he was just exhausted from worrying over the other man.
Prompt: Have you ever thought about tony being in bed watching steve sleep telling him how much he loves him in a really soft whisper. every night before bed, because that's the only way he can get a good night sleep.
“I guess that depends,” Steve replied, scratching his throat.
Pepper shakes her head. “I woke up this morning and saw the headline in the paper.”
in 1985,” Tony answered, understanding why Steve had taken him to see the revival tonight.
Steve bypasses them all and heads for the exit, taking the long way around by walking along the perimeter of the room.  He takes one last glance around the ballroom before slipping out into the lobby of the hotel.
"Ridiculous," Steve repeats, trying to wipe off some of the frosting on his face.

Steve merely rolled his eyes and shrugged his navy blue jacket off his shoulders and held it out in Tony’s line of sight.

Steve was still unconvinced, and it must have shown on his face, because Tony just shook his head and linked their hands together.

Tony pops the cookie into his mouth and makes a sound of approval. “I don’t know if I should be flattered they know my favorite foods, or a little creeped out.”
Steve is leaning against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest.  If it were any other day, Tony would expect him to start lecturing, but Steve remains silent, waiting for Tony to speak first.

“You’re going to sleep already?” Steve asks, getting off the couch.
But could the same thing be said about their home life?
“Or what,” Tony replies while dutifully cleaning the espresso machine.
“We’re really good at the whole communication thing, aren’t we?” Steve says lightly.
“You’re kidding me, right?” Natasha huffs angrily when he doesn’t respond. “So you're really gonna do this?  Fine,” she says. "He has no idea that you're even here.  You could walk out of this hospital right now and Sam and I can act like we never saw you, and you can pretend that you didn't spent an entire day fishing for his

“It just did!” Tony says. “He was here for that talk, remember?  I walked with him to the lecture hall beforehand and then after he asked me to dinner.”
“What?” Steve snorted. “Kill me?”
“C’mon, Steve.  We all know you are.  Everyone’s always afraid of disappointing you.”
"No, I haven’t,” Steve argues.
Steve snorted. “Why don’t you teach me, then?”

“Wouldn’t matter.  You’d still have more money than you know what to do with.”
Who says "I love you" first?
The woman had gotten so upset with Tony’s inability to spare time for her that she had stolen his car and crashed it into a tree.
“There’s no guarantee this will work,” Richards says as he readies the machine.
“–with these big, innocent brown puppy dog eyes and I couldn’t look away, Tony,” Steve said dramatically. “I tried to walk away, but it was physically impossible.”
The only sounds in the room were their heavy breathing.  Steve carded his fingers through Tony’s hair as Tony lazily mouthed at his collarbone, leaving a bruise that would be gone in only a matter of hours.  They lay there for what felt like
“Yeah.  I know you have meetings all day, but it’s our last night here,” Steve explained. “You said you really wanted to go to that restaurant over by—”
Tony shook his head. “Nevermind.  You’re right. We can talk in the mor—”
Steve furiously blinks his eyes, and suddenly becomes even more aware of the sea of faces staring at him expectantly; the swarm of phones and cameras being held out to capture his ever word and movement.

“Thanks,” Tony muttered.  He looked over at Natasha, who seemed to be deeply engrossed in the sports section of the morning paper. “Nat—”

"So will you marry me, or what?” Steve asks again, laying him down on the bed.
Tony wakes up with a headache, but surprisingly, it isn’t one of the worst he’s ever had.  He looks over at his nightstand and finds a couple empty water bottles, which helps explain his not so unbearable state.
“What did she show you?”
Tony huffed a laugh. “You could tell those guys anything and they’d believe it.”
Sam looks dumbfounded. “Wow, both Captain America and Iron Man ask me for help in the same week?  I’m dreaming, right?”
“This wasn’t the worst thing to happen to the company, Pep, or even any of the Avengers for that matter.  Remember Clint’s 4Chan debacle?”
“Given the fact that there aren’t any other
“Whoa,” Tony says, with a dramatic wave of his hands, “are we gonna have to cut you off, Rogers?”
The next one is at the bottom of his favorite mug and Tony chokes on a mouthful of coffee when the liquid drains away from the bottom to reveal a sodden piece of paper.
“Well, at least
Steve pushed the thought in the far back recess of his mind—the last thing he should do was get his hopes up.
“How are we supposed to take care of
Tony drew a deep, shuddering breath. “I was selfish, okay?  I was stupid and selfish.  When we first got together, I couldn’t believe it.  I mean, I’ve loved you for years, and for it to finally be happening was just too good to be true.  I knew it couldn’t last, because you deserve so much more than me,” he explained. “I’ve just been hoping that you’d eventually have enough sense to finally leave me so I wouldn’t have to do it.”
Good night, Tony.”
Tony shrugged. “Built circuit boards?  I don’t know.  I’ve learned to just kind of block out my childhood entirely.”
Steve felt himself blush as the memories of last night came flooding back.  Nothing could have prepared Steve for that night: kissing Tony, touching him, holding him, being inside him… It was unlike any other night Steve had ever had, and he was sure the image of Tony coming apart underneath him would be forever ingrained in his memory.
A few days after taking up residency at the tower, Steve had found a box of doughnuts in the cabinet beneath the sink. A week after that, he found candy wrappers in between the couch cushions, and half of a chocolate cake with his name on it (literally, on a post-it in obnoxious lettering) in the fridge. The blond was also surprised to find out that Tony liked his coffee light and sweet, and not black as he had originally thought.

“I thought you were gone," Steve says, eyes glued to the pavement.
Tony rolls his eyes because of

“That would affect the team—”
Steve makes impromptu visits to Tony’s office with the intention of bringing him lunch, but that usually just ends with Tony sitting at his desk, knees spread as Steve takes Tony’s cock into his mouth.  Tony’s lucky his desk is so large because his secretary walks into his office during one of Steve’s visits.  The fact that he’s able to manage an entire five-minute conversation with her without her suspecting anything is a feat in itself, because Steve’s mouth, Tony has learned, is
“Their articles are very insightful!” Steve protests.
.  It’s like music to Tony’s ears, and it makes Tony want to be the only one to get Steve to make those sounds.
Steve approached him slowly, tentatively reaching out and taking Tony’s hands in his. “All I want is
“Well, it isn’t,” Steve said, standing up and encroaching on Tony’s space. “What I want is to date you.”
“Ugh, fine.”  Tony moved off of Steve and settled on his back again, pulling the covers up to his neck.  He stared up at the ceiling and waited for the gentle lull of sleep to finally come.
“It’s a valid one,” Steve shot back. “Are you okay?”
“I’m not drinking again, if that’s what you’re thinking.”  Tony hated even
“That night was an outlier,” Tony refuted.  His hands settled on Steve’s thighs. “I hadn’t gotten laid in over a year.”
Natasha gapes. “Are you kidding me, Stark?” she says, slamming her fist on the table.  “You wait around here for
“You know, I didn’t think it’d be cute for a military man to lose to a bunch of soccer moms,” Natasha quipped, watching Sam flirt with the group of women almost twice his age. “I was wrong.  It’s adorable.”
And if Tony takes a little comfort in that for even just a few minutes, he doesn’t say it out loud.
He and Pepper had promised to stay friends after their break-up, but to this day, there was still a disconnect between the two of them, regardless of how hard they tried to bridge that gap.    “Something on your mind?”
Steve directed a smile at him and squeezed his hand in reassurance.
“Our firm upholds the utmost professionalism,” Hill says.  She promises him good benefits and even better money, and he finds himself signing a contract by the end of the day.
“I’m very okay,” Tony assured.  “Can you—I wanna kiss you.”
Tony looked away. “You don’t know that.”
“M’kay…”
It took a couple minutes for Tony to come to, relishing in the feeling of Steve’s fingers gently stroking his spine. The blonde shifted under him, sensing the change in Tony’s breathing.
Tony glared at the nearest camera in the ceiling. “I
“Right,” Tony said, trying to sound as convincing as possible.
Pepper sputtered. “Wh—what?!”

Now, Steve was younger, yes, but he didn’t look thirty.

“Keep it,” Steve said to Tony. “Just, next time, ask us before you do something this…”

“Then shouldn’t you be thanking me for being such a thoughtful and considerate date?” Ty backs him up against the kitchen counter and places his hands on Tony’s hips. “C’mon, baby.  It’ll be fun. I’ll show you a great time—”
Steve blushes, and Tony resists the urge to pinch his cheeks–he still needs time to guage what kind of PDA would be appropriate.
Steve starts to back off a bit—even if Tony insists that it’s
Steve frowned. “Why is that?”
“No.  You passed out right after you came,” Steve said, smugly.
Tony doesn’t know how to communicate: his failed relationship with Pepper is evidence of that (he’s over it, really he is; they may have loved each other, but they right
“No,” Steve replied with a smile that mirrored Tony’s own. “Not anymore.”

animals, Tony?” Steve said, exasperatedly.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony said. “I mean, two people alone in a strange city—it’s easy to get caught up in the moment.”
Natasha shakes her head. “No, it’s fine.  He’s okay,” she assures. “Put him on the clearance list.”
Tony swallows. “I… I think you should go, Ty.”
“Did Steve tell you guys about his huge crush on Tony, yet?” Sam asked as he and Clint approached the table.
“What?”
“So you tried different things, right?  It took a while, but eventually, you figured out something that worked—”

“Ten million.”

has been trying to woo me over the past two weeks,” Tony counters. “I think all of that pales in comparison.”
Then there was Steve.
"Are there—"
“N-no,” Tony stammered, suddenly feeling warm all over for reasons that had to do with more than just Steve’s proximity. “It’s fine.  You did fine.”
could have anyone you want.  The reason why the media dismissed those dating rumors so quickly is because they didn’t believe that you would stoop so low as to date someone like me.” “Why do you always say things like that?”  “Because it’s the truth,” Tony said.
One thing Tony wasn’t prepared for, however, was getting snatched and thrown into a moving van by a group of large men while doing some last minute gift-shopping for Steve’s birthday.
Steve kisses his temple. “The only thing that matters to me is that I’m with you.”
He has no idea how Steve has been able to wedge a permanent place in Tony’s life in the span of three months, but he has, and it’s as thrilling as it is terrifying.  Tony’s relationship experience prior to Steve was basically nonexistent, and Steve’s… well, it was safe to say that Steve was much better versed in the art of romance, but Steve never minded.
, too,” Tony reasoned. “I’d be more than happy to provide you with some books.  I know sex education in the 40’s wasn’t as good as it is now.  I mean, not that it’s that great
Tony gave a sigh of relief at the sight of Pepper forcing her way through the crowd. “Pepper, what—”
“Yes.  It was the night of my husband’s fiftieth birthday.  The festivities were just beginning, and there he is, looking guilty as ever with the largest lovebite on his neck that I have ever seen.  He likes to think he’s quite the sneak, but that boy cannot lie to save his life—”
Tony coughed. “Uh… I’m good.  I don’t really…” he trailed off.
Sam, and so Tony’s surprised when the latter three give him the “shovel talk” before Bucky does.
prompt from musicalluna:
Steve did.
“C’mon Cap,” Clint wheedles. “We’re not planning on getting drunk.  We’ll restrain ourselves, just for you.”
Tony’s jaw dropped when Steve unzipped one of the compartments and started rummaging through the contents. “You came
Natasha approaches him. “Tony,” she says, shaking his shoulder, “did you hear me?”
“A sword?” Clint finished.  “Yeah.  Cliché, I know.  Luckily, it wasn’t too deep, and with your serum, Banner and Cho are convinced you’ll be back in fighting shape in just a couple days.”
“I thought you were some kind of genius,” Steve said, his voice breathless as he started to open himself up.  He hadn’t done this in some time, and he knew he probably wasn’t being thorough enough, but he really needed to get Tony inside him.
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose. “Something always happens when the two of you conspire against me.”
Steve was always observant.  Heightened supersoldier-senses aside, he always had an eye for detail.  As such, it was no surprise that after a mere two weeks of living in Avengers Tower, he noticed a number of surprising quirks and habits that his teammates had.
“That’s the way it is.”  Tony decides to sink the last nail into the coffin of their relationship.  Lord knows it’s dead anyway.  “To be fair, you more than held up your end of the relationship.  Your puppy-dog eyes and bulging biceps were more of a distraction than my bachelor antics could ever be.”
“What?”  Steve tilts his head, as if the motion will clue him in on some crucial detail that he’s missed.
“Steve, if I listened to everyone who told me I shouldn’t do something, nothing would ever get done.”  He stares at the horse, which is fucking huge this close up.  Not only is the stallion larger than life, but it’s rearing on its back legs in a way that would be nearly impossible to cast without magic.  It’s easily twelve-feet tall and who knows how heavy.
“Not to mention the fact that I’m Tony Stark.”
And that was just…actually, that made no sense.  That sort of crosses the boundaries of Steve being a good friend and strays more into the realm of…something more.  Tony freezes, convinced that if he moves too suddenly he’ll spook the super soldier, and tries to parse out
“On the most basic level, but that’s a ridiculously narrow attitude to take toward a phone.”  Tony reaches out and grabs both of Steve’s shoulders, trying to ignore just how high of a reach that it is.  “Steve,” he starts, “if Windows Vista and Samsung had a sleazy one night stand, that phone is their torrid love child. And it’s not a pretty child either, Steve.  That phone is the kid that sits on the edge of the playground eating dirt while its parents wait on the farthest bench and pretend it doesn’t belong to them.  Seriously, if I ever see that flip phone again, we can’t be friends.”
“You know,” she drawls, “you don’t exactly have to wait up.  I haven’t had a curfew in decades, and I’m pretty sure even when I did have one, I didn’t pay attention to it.”
“What is this?” he asks, gesturing to the rectangle. Steve stares at the strange little device. It probably does something ridiculously complex, but he has no idea how to answer.
“Nothing, it’s just I can’t believe you’re real.  People who read that doorstop are generally classified with the wooly mammoths and unicorns.  I should probably march you upstairs to Customer Relations so they can worship you as a god.”
Steve texts back almost immediately.
“Look, I’m not saying that you – Stark is – is not as if I’m – you and Stark just seem really – ”
s, wait, no, hedge.  Into the – no, Over.
“She a friend of yours?”
“Of course you don’t,” she answers disdainfully.
“So that’s it?  You come back, and the first thing they tell you to do is come yell at me?”
Unwilling to accept what his tech his telling him to be true, Tony rips at the clasp of his helmet and throws the offending piece aside with a vehemence that he’s never before shown to his armor.  Steve his
Instead of gracing Thor with a response, Tony turns back toward him.  “Space is
Tony’s hypothesizing about the behavior of free electrons when his screens suddenly black out.  It takes him a moment to fully understand what’s going on.  His tech has powered off, and his tech never powers off without his consent.
“Does that happen to you often? Knowing one of the actors?”
To his infinite shock, he actually has a good time, and not only because Steve’s there with him.  Someone out there has crafted the only possible exhibit that would catch his interest: “Picturing Math.”  The assembled pieces were compiled from the Met’s collection of drawings and prints and were meant to demonstrate the way in which 15
“Steve!”
Steve pinches him on the side. “Stop that, you know they love you” Tony's yelp gets lost in the air, as Steve’s hands move to Tony's hips. “Not as much as I do though.”
“Sometimes you say things, and I'm not sure if you're joking or you would actually go there.” Bucky says.
Steve looks down at him. “When you fell?”
, you're so helpful, really.” Tony deadpans.
Steve stares at Sam.
“... Tony?”
“You sure look like it.” Clint argues, egging him on.
Tony sighs. “Sure, if it makes you happy.”
“I was all muddy okay?”
“I'm sorry.”
Bucky splutters, giving him an incredulous stare. Clint smirks, and wiggles his eyebrows at Bucky, as if he just won the argument. It only serves for Bucky to throw his apple right at Clint's head.
“To—“ the name dies on Steve's mouth. There's nothing he can say to stop Tony from leaving.
Steve sighs. Bucky is right, he could just confess his feelings all over again. But he's afraid that now his chance has been blown.
“Oh god.” Tony whines behind him.
. Always will.”
Tony shakes his head smirking. "Okay, Romeo”
“But—“
But what they don't see is Steve’s silly side that Tony manages to bring up so easily. He forgets his reservations the second Tony looks at him. Nor do they see Tony in his quiet moments, when he's trying to solve an equation, or sleeping peacefully on Steve's arms after he's been on a twenty four hours binge, or how he actually prefers to keep his valuable things private. They don't know that Tony's ability to see the
“Where are you bleeding from?”
One thing he does know for sure is that Tony was also there.
“Yeah. I didn't say anything afraid it would break the team.” Tony laughs humorlessly. “Yet it still happened.”
Tony keeps murmuring “I'm sorry.” Over and over again. Steve wants to tell him it's not his fault that Steve can't simply live without him anymore. That when he received Rhodey's call, he felt the ground break underneath him. That life has slapped him right in the heart with a preview of what would be for him if he ever lost Tony like this, and he could have lived without knowing so.
“Huh, that wasn't weird at all,” Tony murmurs sarcastically. He looks down at the paper and shrugs. He unfolds it and almost chokes. He reads it over and over again to make sure he's not reading it wrong.
“You can't be by yourself, Tones.” Rhodey explains.
“I know this is a shock. I get that. But Tony, I'm not messing with you. I did truly fell for you. And I'm telling you because I'm tired of keeping it to myself. It doesn't make me happy to live in a lie, even when it's just affecting me mainly. Yes, we fight, but I know it's all misplaced emotions. At least it's for me. I'm hoping that coming clear, will help in that aspect. I'm not blind to say that we won't fight anyways; we're very different people. But I want to fight because you spend too much time in the lab and forgot to eat. Or because you left your clothes on the floor. Not because I'm scared shitless that you might die in a mission. I'm hoping that by telling you it shows you that you've someone here that cares a lot about you.”
Bucky doesn't even take his eyes off from where he's been focusing for at least fifteen minutes. He frowns deeper instead.
“Fuck you.”
Steve kisses him as his answer, and it's nothing that Tony could have ever imagined; it's way better. Tony's heart is trying to leave his body when they come apart.
Steve rakes his brain all day, even ask people that were at the party if they noticed anything happening between him and Tony. But nobody has any idea what he's talking about.
Steve smiles softly because Tony does know him. That along gives him all the courage he needs.
Steve nodded. “Tony, we might have our differences, but one thing will never change. I still love you, and I don't think I'll ever stop.”
“Yes, I feel the same. But Steve, you can't love me.”
“After everything?”
The rest of the day all Tony can think about is the note and the date. Tony goes, only because he's sure Steve is just fucking with him. Even though his brain reminds him that Steve is not that kind of person.
“You should.”
“Maybe.”
“Right back at you.” Bucky says.
Steve started to chuckle.
“Can we...” Steve stutters for a second. “I just wanted to tell you something, if that's okay.”
Steve tells himself to just breathe. “Anything else?”
“Tiny, very tiny, concussion.”
Steve exhales shakily. “You scared me.”
Tony takes it curiously, and before he can ask anything about it, little Peter is running out of the shop.
Bucky is currently seating on the opposite side of the couch and keeps narrowing his eyes at them. Steve frowns, then ignores it for a while, paying attention back to the movie on the TV. Until the staring starts getting on his nerves.
Steve isn't laughing right now.
“Bucky.”
Tony rubs his hands nervously over the blankets. “I broke my leg.”
“Are you asking me if he's sixteen, or are you telling me he's sixteen, yet he's a junior in college?” Bucky asks now very confused.
“Don't treat me like a kid.” Steve said exasperated. “It's what it is, and you better accept it.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Alright, we're doing this the hard way then.”
“A second chance?”
“Are you fucking serious, Steve? You brought him to mom? When did that even happened?”
“It's about us. You becoming the man I always thought you to be, and me coming to terms with how I feel about you.”
“Fine, bleed out for all I care!”
“Alright, everyone. Can we just, stop this?” Steve pleads. “Everything is fine. Stop making it seem like it's not.”
Call him a coward, but after that realization, Steve avoids Tony all day. He will talk to him of course, once Steve can remember what sort of idiotic thing he did last night. Did he give the jacket to Tony? Was he cold and Steve was just acting polite? Or worse yet.... did he confess his interest in Tony?!
“Remind me to never let Pepper and Natasha get together.” Tony says, voice a bit scared, next to him.
Natasha points a finger at him. “Hey, I kept your secret. The least I could get from it is some fun.”
He can't wait until tomorrow, and for a future with Tony.
“I promise you this is very real.”
“Yeah, but Rhodey sleeps in the same dorm room with me, so him not finding out was quite impossible. And once Rhodey knows, then Pepper knows too because she's supposed to be my guardian while I'm here. I swear those two have made a pact to tell each other on me.”
“You're not helping me at all.”
“I still don't get what is this all about.”
“Steve?” He hears Tony’s worried question, but can't bring himself to say anything past the knot in his throat.
“AaaaaCHUUUUU!”
“Well that's done then.” Steve claps his hands, putting his attention back to Tony. “Alright, give it to me.”
“Only partially, really.” Natasha amends. “I mean, if this guy hurts you, I will cut his balls off with my knife.”
“Steve you're being very weird right now. What's going on?” Tony asks still wary. “Do you want to leave?”
“Uh, yes I can.”
Turns out Steve didn't lose his jacket because Tony Stark is wearing it. He thinks about confronting him about stealing his jacket because he can't fathom any other reason as to why his crush is wearing it like that. But Tony doesn't need to steal a jacket, he has plenty himself.
“Wow look at his face, if he could drool, he would right now.” Clint comments.
“I'm in love with you,” Steve says it quickly, to stop the ranting he knows is coming when Tony gets worked up. The last thing he wants right now is to argue with him.
Bucky punches him on the shoulder. “Are you an idiot?”
Steve turns to look at Natasha. “Yeah?”
They fake fight for a few minutes, falling from the bed. Once there, Bucky asks for a truce, and they lay on the carpet catching their breaths.
Tony grins. “Well, Steve. I can't help it if I'm very interesting.”
Tony glares at him. “How is that possible?”
“So, you must be Natasha.” Tony starts, holding his hand out to her.
Tony takes his hand again, and Steve gladly accepts it, keeping his grip strong as they walk into the diner.
Bucky scratches his mop of hair, getting a few strands loose from where it's tied. “Okay. That makes sense, I guess. And I will take your word for it until I see how amazing those things you say are.” He rests his chin on his hand. “Why did you let us believe he's older? And why the heck have you been keeping all this from me?”
“Well, Pepper is informed. And now we have a minor problem.” Rhodey says coming back to the room.
“Nah, not until you're better at least.” Rhodey confirms.
“Yankees will be always better! Steve is with me. Right, Steve?”
“Because we weren't true to ourselves.”
“Damn.” Bucky murmurs.
Clint shrugs. “It's what he gets for keeping this Tony a secret.”
“Totally.”
It's all Steve needs to break, he's moving before he can think about possibly causing more harm, and embracing Tony as if he will never let him go. Tony grunts painfully, and Steve almost lets him go immediately, but Tony won't let him.
It takes him few more minutes to calm himself completely, but once he does, he feels lighter. He pulls away, aware that he probably looks like a mess, and surprised that Tony looks the same. Steve kisses him softly on the lips, takes another breath. “It wasn't your fault, so please don't blame yourself. It was an accident. I know that. I'm just—“
“So you were just texting him then.” Natasha, who had been staying out of the whole conversation, sidetracks him with a knowing look. “How's that going anyway?”
“Did anyone see my jacket?” Steve asks, rummaging through his closet.
Steve resists the urge to nervously laugh. He created all this confusion, now he has to clear it up. “He's just sixteen?”
“No arguments.” Steve says before Tony can say anything.
“Bucky, we're going to be late and the garage is going to close before—“
“Ugh, this is not fair. I love it when you manhandle me, but I'm so mad about it right now.”
And so Tony will wear the jacket, every day until it's too old to wear.
“I'm sorry, Tony!” Steve squeaks, embarrassed. He helps Tony up, who is still wearing his jacket.
“I will be more careful.” Tony says eagerly.
“Oh, I am. That's why I wouldn't let you ruin something that's so good for you.” Bucky says warmly.
Steve stops him, pulling him back. Tony easily lets him do it, and Steve kisses him again. This time, it's a bit too heated for a public setting, but Steve could care less. He's just bursting with how lucky he feels to have met Tony. With how much he loves this sometimes complicated boy, and how he wouldn't have it any other way.
“Holy shit dude, she was joking.” Clint interrupts.
Now the city is safer than ever with Fisk gone; and if anyone tries to come and cause trouble, they will not only have a hot-headed sheriff to deal with, but also Tony wielding the armor. Of course, that begs the issue of Steve getting shot again. But Tony thinks he might have found a solution to that too; will Steve call him crazy for it? Maybe.
Tony grins, accepting the handshake. “Likewise.”
His friends are loud, okay? And intrusive. They mean well, Steve knows this. They're all looking out for him, and they're probably concocting the worst case scenarios since Steve hasn't been too forward about the whole situation. But he wants to get to have Tony all for himself, before everybody else in his life gets to share a piece of him.
Steve blushes, and again Tony couldn't melt more even if he tried. The urge to gently rub his fingers on that tinge of pink over Steve's cheeks is very strong, but he stops himself, still unsure of what's happening.
“I'm thinking somewhere in that head of yours, you do know.”
“I will like to speak with you.”
Steve kisses the curls on Tony's hair. “I'm getting there.”
“Why?”
“I would fight him to death.” Steve says seriously, then grins.
“Then why are you in my lab, being all serious, and—”
Steve smiles at the text message fondly, completely ignoring the ruckus happening at the lunch table, where Clint had decided a few minutes ago to test Bucky's temper by arguing about who's a better team between the Yankees and The Patriots.
“I mean, it's been, what?— Almost six months since you started to go out with this guy?” Sam adds noncommittally.
They can't afford another breakup because of Steve's pent-up emotions. Nor Tony's.
Tony shrugs. “Well, they're your friends. They just want the best for you.”
. I suggest you don't join him on his suicide mission.” Sam mutters, trying to make sure Bucky doesn't hear anything he just said.
Then Tony comes out of whatever it's going on in his brain and pinches himself. “Ow! Son of a...”
Steve smiles to himself.
“And yet you teased me endlessly. You're a cruel woman, Natasha Romanoff.”
“He wore the jacket, that you gave him last night. I'm pretty sure you haven't completely blown it yet.” Bucky murmurs as if reading Steve's thoughts.
Tony's ears flush a little.
“Well, at least you look cute.”
“Nope. Rhodey is right. You're going to stay with me, then.”
“So, we're all good with the plan? Tony stays with you until at least Pepper is back?” Rhodey affirms, after watching the exchange.
“We eat, and then we go back to my place.”
“I'm glad to see you so happy.”
He doesn't say anything for a while, trying to figure out the best way. Until they go undercover to destroy The Cabal. It's a mistake in part because he can see the arguing starting to happen again. But also they manage to not kill each other, and some breakthrough happens as they're trying to get rid of Red Skull.
Steve huffs. “Shut up.”
Once again, as he watches Tony's retreating back, Steve is left feeling like the worst person in the world.
“So, are you ready for some burgers? Because my soul is calling for some grease.”
“Steve, let me drive you to the hospital. You can't ride your bike shaking like that.” Bucky pleads. “You're going to have an accident, and then what?”
Now sitting here in the tower's kitchen, with the rest of the team eating pizza after a long hard fight in which Tony almost dies, might he add, he decides to tell Tony about his feelings.
Tony salutes back, barely holding his snort.
“Hey, little Peter! What brings you to my humble place.”
“Your pants are soaked through with blood, Steve.”
Tony reaches for Steve's jacket and pulls him closer to kiss him again. “That got your answer?”
Tony reels back. “What?”
“We fix what we broke.”
Now he has managed to fuck up everything with Tony.
Steve takes a steadying breath before getting up and out of the room.
“Okay, good. We're here.”
“Still a scratch.”
Steve nods. “I'm glad I can remember this one,” he mentions dreamily.
Now both Tony and Bucky look at Steve.
Steve groans angrily. “I can't believe I lost my jacket.”
Tony laughs, and then regrets it. Steve is right there to support him while he gathers his breath again.
Tony nods again, still bonelessly resting against Steve. He must be tired again, so Steve moves them to a more comfortable position, until they are lying on the bed.
“We're doomed.” Tony laments.
Tony huffed, his whiskers moving annoyed.
Not the way he wanted for Bucky to meet Tony, but it will have to do. He turns to be able to face both. “Tony, this is Bucky. My best friend, basically my brother really. Bucky, this is Tony, my boyfriend who I'm going to mother-hen until he's better even if he doesn't want to.”
“I already told you not to worry about it," Tony says wringing his shirt. “It's not your fault. You never drink.”
Steve takes her advise, and takes it on a stride. Makes sure Tony eats a meal three times a day. Moves around the house with his help when he needs too. Snuggles him in the sofa, as they're currently doing, while he takes an afternoon nap that possibly will extend to the evening—and Steve will probably have to wake Tony up for dinner.
“Yeah sorry, been busy,” Steve says nervously. “That jacket looks good on you.” He says as an afterthought.
“You're going to bed.”
Of course Tony sees right through it, and just stares at him.
Steve blinks. “What do you mean up close?” His eyes narrow at Natasha, who looks at him knowingly. Steve gasps. “Oh my god, how long have you known?!”
Sam shrugs. “Alright then.”
~^FIN^~
first?” Bucky says frowning.
He just....
“Steve, hey, are you okay?”
“Okay...guess I see where you're coming from. But Steve, baby, I just wanted you to be part of it. I'm not telling you all that stuff to make you feel like you have competition.”
Bucky's frown deepens. “Huh, he must have great genes because he looks younger than us.”
“Don't even try it, Sam. He's jumping the walls already, and I promised I would take him here with me so he can meet the rest of the group.”
Clint clears his throat.
“Love you too,
“What? She's going to murder me with her stilettos?” Tony jokes again, but actually sounds a bit scared.
” It probably comes out harsher than he intends to, but he's a mess of nerves and his chest hurts just from how hard his heart has been beating all this time.
“I know. I'm so sorry.” Tony says pained, hugging Steve as strongly as he can manage. “I really didn't mean for this to happen.”
“Oh crap!” Steve says, rushing to help Tony out of the fountain. “I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen.”
Steve's eyes turn soft. “Thank you.” He smiles at her, before going back to pay attention to the banter.
“Yup.”
“You haven’t presented me your friends yet, and they probably don't know much about me.” Tony states. “But I get it Steve. If I could just have kept it between us longer on my side, I would have done it.”
“Why would you think that?”
“I'm in love with you, Tony.”
“Why would I think that?”
“It doesn't mean that I didn't mean what I said.”
“Steve!” Tony shouts, catching him on time. “You idiot.” He mutters, trying not to get pulled down by Steve's weight because he's out of the armor already,
Which brings Steve's attention to Bucky being in the room with him.
Bucky chuckles. “You're being a bit dramatic.”
Steve laughs, rising his head. “Yeah, let's go.”
Clint fake gasps. “Steve, are you ashamed of your college boyfriend? Is that what this is?”
Steve sighs. “Why are you staring at Tony like that?”
“Can't I just kiss my boyfriend however I want to kiss him?” Steve asks, acting affronted.
And that's how Sam finds out about Tony.
He's never felt this way about anyone. It's like they are pieces of a puzzle that match together. And if someone saw from the outside, they would think Steve is crazy. Because they look like they shouldn't be together, that they shouldn't work at all. Because from the outside, Steve looks reserved, while Tony is flamboyant. Steve can only see things either black or white, while Tony always sees the grays. Steve is better with physical things, and he gets by in school; Tony is literally a fucking genius, and his mind is ten steps ahead from anybody else’s.
But Tony can't afford to lose Steve. The first time almost destroyed him. So much so, that Tony hasn't even touched a drop of alcohol in the past six months to make sure he's sober enough to protect Steve next time.
That's all it takes for Tony and Clint to get into a friendly argument, in which they then drag Bucky into it, and Sam is in the middle, trying to keep things calm. Steve watches the exchange with a fond smile in his face. His fear that his friends could had been too much for Tony completely trashed and destroyed as he sees his boyfriend go toe to toe with Clint.
“I've been in bed for three days, I’ve had enough of it.” Tony responds.
“Tony.”
“And?”
Of course in his haste to search for answers, his luck runs out, and he crashes into Tony.
~^FIN^~
“So you decided to take a bath in this waterfall.”
Tony smirks. “Yeah.”
“Holy heavens,” is all Tony can manage to say.
Tony doesn't like to dwell on why Steve is so important to him. It does nothing but forces him to wish for things that will never happen. It's a waste of his time when he has so much to do.
“Well...”
Steve snorts, putting his cellphone back in his pocket. “I'm staying out of it.”
“Cap?” Tony says raising an eyebrow. “What brings you to my humble abode? Do you need something?”
“That moment where I was lying on the mud, all I could think about is the things I never did, and the things I was too coward to accept and act on.”
Steve turns to Tony, looking to see any signs that Tony is actually not okay with this. He sees none, and Steve expected it because Tony adores his mom as much. “Yes, that's the plan.”
“Why?” Tony asks, voice barely audible. This is obviously affecting him more than Steve thought it would, and part of him is regretting saying anything. The last thing he wants is to cause Tony pain.
“Excuse you?” Tony says offended. “I'm not that young!”
Tony's heart can't help but melt at this whole side of Steve he gets to see. “Curiosity got the best of me,” Tony quips.
“MOM KNOWS HIM?!” Bucky shouts.
Tony shrugs. “If you say so.”
“Hey Tony,” he salutes to make his presence noticed.
“But you spend so much time with him. And I see how much he makes you laugh, and you won't shut up about all the things you do together.”
Steve gets out of the car with weak knees, but he takes a deep breath to calm himself down. Rhodey didn't sound super concerned, mostly annoyed. If it was really bad, he would have told Steve over the phone, right?
“Me too.”
It got to the point of being so toxic, they had to step away, and that's when the dismantling happened.
Steve would lie if he said he didn’t expect Tony to be the worst patient ever. He should be, if he goes by how hard is to keep Tony still sometimes. But Tony isn't up much for moving, and that alone tells Steve he's feeling worse than he's letting on.
Tony frowns. “How is that a problem?”
“Nothing like that.”
Then he remembers the party last night, and that he got shit-faced, and can't remember much about it.
“Yeah, it was a great thing to see your best friend falling to his possible death.” Rhodey pinches the bridge of his nose.
Tony groans. “That traitor.”
Steve cringes. “Oh, yeah. Um, you were out with Sam for the better part of the afternoon doing that class project with the cars. And Tony was free, so I brought him home to meet mom.” Steve explains, apologetically.
“I'm fine,” Tony responds, patting the dirt off his jeans. “At least I’ve finally found you.”
Natasha shrugs. “It wasn't my secret to tell.”
“Yeah...”
Natasha draws out her boot knife. “Do you want to find out?”
Steve waves his hand unconcerned. “She will be fine with it. She adores Tony.”
“Steve—“
He then sees the arrow under Steve's name pointing towards the back of the paper and a muted squeak leaves his mouth.
“It's not much. But I think it will get us by.” Steve responds, moving toward the blanket. “Join me?” He asks, sitting on one side of the blanket.
Rhodey raises his hand, palm up to stop him from talking, his mouth into a thin line. “You're banned from roofs. Actually you're not allowed near anything that's high enough to kill you.”
On the other hand, he’s tangled so deeply in a web of lies that he’s probably not going to be able to escape without hacking off a few limbs.  He’s Tony Stark, but he’s also Iron Man.  He’s dating Steve, who’s also Captain America.  But Steve doesn’t know that he’s Iron Man, and Steve doesn’t know that Tony knows that he’s Captain America.  They’ve saved the world together twice, but Steve remains blissfully unaware of their combined awesomeness.  And Tony’s all for keeping it that way.
“I’m not leaving until we at least talk about this.”
Clint’s reply is breathless but strong.  “I did not join an elite paramilitary organization to fight Balto!”
“I’d like one.” It’s an understatement.
At least he has until the pair of them get back from D.C. to get his head on straight. He’s nearly managed to get the two of them out of his head when a voice rings from the room’s speakers, dragging the whole sordid situation screaming back to the surface.
“JARVIS,” he calls, “bring up the files on the prototype I was working on the other day.”
“These are just a sample of Sir’s questionable wardrobe choices throughout the years.  I must add that all of these images were taken willingly, with Mr. Stark’s full knowledge and enthusiasm.”
There it is.  That’s the bait.  Now all that’s left to do is for Steve to pick it up and they can talk feelings and shit.
"I got these for you,” Steve says, offering Tony the bouquet.
“JARVIS, what the hell is going on?”
“Tonight,” he affirms and exits, all the while thinking to himself that while that wasn’t as bad as he expected things to be, he much preferred the world he thought he inhabited before this morning.
“Great,” he says, smiling brightly.  “In that case, I’ll see you later tonight!” He turns, leaving the room before he did something crazy, like start gushing to Steve about how amazing he was.  Nothing good ever comes of his mindless babbling.
Clint’s hand comes up to his head.  “Yeah.  Not all of us can have a sugar daddy like Stark,” he answers, rubbing his scalp.
It’s lucky for him that Tony’s back is turned, because Steve’s pretty sure he spent a good minute standing in the doorway with his mouth open and clutching a greasy sack full of tacos, which is probably not the best way to start the evening.  He gives himself a minute to appreciate the sight in front of him before he steps fully into the room.  Whatever flame-inducing project Tony is working on is probably stopped him from hearing the doors, so Steve waits until Tony’s between strokes to speak up.
“Isn’t Disney an animation company?”  Steve still looks perplexed, but overall he’s taking the information overload rather well.
“Well you’re going about it in exactly the wrong way.”  Tony moves closer and sits on a nearby barstool.  “Look, don’t take this the wrong way, but if you’re looking to make up for twenty years of living in a bubble, reading…” He reaches into Steve’s messenger bag and pulls out a thick book with a look of slight distaste.  “...
Fortunately, the timestamp lets him know that he’s only missed the text by eight minutes, and he quickly shoots off a reply in the hopes that Tony will still be able to respond.
“The internet, Sir.  Everything can be found on the internet.”
“Right, sure.”  Clint nods, but sarcasm is still thick in his tone.
“Good to have another scientist on the team.  Maybe we can get something about space out of Thor that doesn’t involve ravens, trees, or giants that asexually reproduce by sweating.”
There's no precedent for this situation. If he — she — were in the armor, he'd clasp her on the shoulder, but that very familiar gesture of comfort seems almost unbearably intimate as he looks down on a closed-eyed Natasha. And flesh is so much warmer than iron.
Steve scrolls through the alarmingly long list of results, clicks three images at random, and forwards them to Tony.
– yet time after time he’s left with the corpse of yet another burned out reactor.  He’s going to have to hold a mass funeral soon to get rid of all of the tiny, mangled tech carcases.  Maybe a funeral pyre would be appropriate, since they seemed to enjoy spontaneously bursting into flames.
Her statement immediately puts Steve on his guard.  Things have been relatively quiet on the intergalactic front since the Chitauri invasion, but this woman is making it sound as if Earth is acquiring a sudden reputation among alien spheres, and that thought scares the hell out of him.  Sure, this woman seems alright, but he’s still pretty hesitant about anything with otherworldly origins after his experiences with the Tesseract.
Steve can’t tell exactly what’s going on – he rarely can when it comes to Tony – but he doesn’t need to know the details to appreciate the sight.  There’s a long piece of metal, there’s a belt grinder, and there are sparks.  Tony is presumably doing something very constructive and very important my applying said metal to said belt grinder, but for the life of him, Steve can’t figure out what that is.  He’s far too concerned with the way the sparks from the worked metal are creating a soft orange glow around the inventor, the chiaroscuro casting his muscular profile into stark relief.
“Needs must.” Natasha breaks eye contact and stares at the floor, unwilling to carry the conversation any further, which leaves the threads for him to pick up.
“In addition to that, the films will be useful themselves. People just sort of expect you to know a set number of movie tropes.  It’s kind of like a social right of passage.”
Steve nods once and crosses his hands over his chest.  “Okay.”
“I know that.  You just seem to be really enthusiastic about it.”
“That’s enough commentary from the peanut gallery.  Up the dose, J.”
“Listen, Steve,” he says, “this thing with Tasha been going on for a while now.”
“What did you do?” the inventor demands, his voice inflected with shock.
“Right,” Tony answers, giving the room over to an awkward silence.

Steph.  You are a penguin.  Pen-guin,” she stresses, armored finger bumping against Steph’s chainmail with each syllable.  “And I, for one, refuse to scrape your star-spangled carcass off the streets of New York City.   I am a superhero, Stephanie, not a janitor, do you understand me?  And I’m not a taxi service, either, so you can get that through your thick cowl, and I’d appreciate it if you—”
But his problem child continues to be problematic, and Steve, damn him to the darkest pits of a technically bereft hell, is laughing under his breath.  Tony briefly considers running after Dum-E, but there’s something about chasing a cell-phone clutching robot around the lab that seems undignified.  He glares darkly at Dum-E’s retreating form and turns back to Steve, muttering “I know where he charges.”
Steve still looks dazed, but he attempts a sentence.  “The ship – the water – the ship was going down, and I just…I couldn’t watch it sink.”
It’s slowly driving him insane.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, his voice just a tad bit more reserved than before.  “I don’t think we’ve met.”
“All right, Tony,” he acknowledges.  “Then I’m Steve.”
Steve nods.  “Right.”
Tony knows.

Tasha pauses one more time, her eyes roving up and down Steph’s seated figure.  “You sure?”
“Ummm, pretty much the exact same thing?”  he snaps back.  “As far as I can tell, SHIELD flew Captain America and Co to Germany to intercept Loki, but Iron Man was the one who brought him in.  As far as New York goes, the Avengers took most of the hits, while Fury floated above the city like the world’s most useless helicopter parent.”
“You’re wonderful,” he says as he opens up the bag.  “Lunch is on me.”
“Since the Central Park invasion.”
And just like that, the elephant’s back in the room. Or rather, Steve qualifies, he’s not in the room where he’s supposed to be, serving as the only point of contact for two people who have very little else in common.
“You’re babbling.”  Although he hopes that babbling is indicative of good things.
Steve stares.  “I’m not sure how much clearer I can be,” he says, as if it’s remotely reasonable to go around without a decent phone or a laptop.
“And that’s why it has to be you.” Fury sighs, stand up, and crosses to sit on the corner of his desk. He leans forward, trying to engage Steve with mere proximity. “No one will ever be able to talk techno-babble with Stark. He’s one of the smartest men on the planet, but he’s also one of the most stubborn. He doesn’t need someone to tell him to get things done; he needs someone to convince him that it’s the right thing to do.”
“Can’t we just blow it off and apologize later?”  His voice may or may not resemble a whine at this point.  Slightly.  He’s really not up for speaking to…whomever he’s supposed to speak to, and Jimmy Choo’s are a great way to say I’m sorry.
It takes several precious seconds for Iron Man to reply, and the response comes out with very little inflection.  “I hear you.”  He extends his arm, and the familiar weight of the shield drops into Steve’s hands.  “The Group of Bears has broken through the barricade on 79th,” Iron Man intones.  “They’re headed this way.”
He won’t.
He holds on the back of Steve’s hand, but he moves the other to his shoulder, ready to shake the man into consciousness.  “Steve!” he yells, his voice a croaking parody of its usual self.  “Wake up!”  Shake.  “Don’t you do this to me.”  Shake.  “Not now.
Steve’s not the most scientifically minded guy, but he’s got enough instincts to angle the shield so that the oncoming statue-zombies fall in the path of the reflected repulsor beam.  After a few successful hits, he and Iron Man work out an unspoken system, in which Iron Man will send out short bursts of energy as Steve redirects the shield.
And that...that sends his mind to dangerous places. Apart from now knowing that his friend has hair, Steve has very little knowledge of his friend’s features inside of that armor. With so little to work with, it was hard to imagine his faceless, formless friend engaging in such an intimate activity.
Steve hesitates before answering.  Natasha is easily the person he’s closest to in this century, but he doesn’t know just how deep her loyalty to SHIELD lies.  Somehow, he doesn’t think she’d much appreciate Stark’s views on SHIELD’s motives.
“That…that is
“Tony.”
“Might I suggest an image query?”
“You assume correctly.”
Steve finally responds.  “Probably so, JARVIS.  Can’t say I regret it, though.”  Nope, not one bit.  Satisfied that he’s pegged JARVIS as a future ally, he settles down to wait until it’s safe to take his habitual place on the couch.  Opening up his sketchbook, he absentmindedly starts a brief pencil sketch, but the doodling is really not enough to stop his mind from straying to problematic thoughts.
“Well if that’s the way you want to go about things,” Tasha drawls, bending slightly to grab her helmet, “we’d better continue this discussion at home.”  Helmet on, she pulls Steph toward her, extending one booted foot.
Ms. Stark's current whereabouts and status are unknown, as moments after shots were fired, she was carried away from the scene by Iron Man, who was with her at the time of the attack but unable to prevent the gunman from taking fire. We have received cell phone footage of the event, but please exercise caution, as this video may be upsetting to some viewers.”
“Well, I suggest you get to figuring that out.”
“Motorcycle,” Steve interjects.  “A Harley-Davidson Softail Slim.”
“Well now I have to!”
Admittedly, it wasn’t his best line. But so long as the content comes across clearly, he’ll eventually forgive himself for it. “You don't have to you know. Pine.”
“I’m not sure exactly what you want me to do.  You’re clearly working on the more important project, and I don’t want you to change your mind.”
He’s just about talked himself into moving forward when a voice from the shadows startles him.
when he’s interrupted by the buzz of an incoming message.
“Whatever we want it to mean.”  At the moment, he’s willing to settle for it meaning Tony doesn’t permanently bar him from the lab.  “I just didn’t want to wait too long and miss my chance.”
He doesn’t feel any better about things the next morning. The previous night’s events run through is mind on an intolerable mental loop, and he does not look better for the replay. Neither Iron Man nor Natasha is responsible for his feelings, and it’s incredibly unfair of him to let his emotions bleed out so recklessly. The next time he sees them, he assures himself, he’ll have more control.
“Me and Iron Man,” she echoes. Her tone betrays nothing and the room is, if possible, more awkward than before. After a moment, Natasha continues. “Did you need anything else?”
“Good thing you’re putting a ring on it then.” She stretches for a moment before wrapping her arms around her pillow, and just for a moment Steve can see the tell-tale flash of bluish-white shining from her chest.
Tony’s eyebrow goes up.
And he sleeps a lot. His mom assures him it's all because of the painkillers, and his body healing from his injuries. To not look a gifted horse in the mouth, because he will be screaming to the sky once this stage of healing passes and he won’t be able to keep Tony in one place anymore.
Steve is in love with Tony. He can't quite point out when he discovered his feelings, but he does know they're there and his realization came after they've broken up the team. Part of him wonders sometimes if not knowing this was the reason for it.
“Why?”
“It's not imposing. You're coming with me once they let you go.”
Bucky huffs, annoyed. “You're such a

know him.” Bucky says pointedly.
He follows the candle-lighted way, nerves twisting his stomach into nausea. Said nervousness disappears as soon he sees Steve; standing next to a blanket on the grass, and smiling in surprise. He probably thought Tony wasn't going to show up, and that makes Tony feel sadness, even though he knows why Steve would think such a thing.
“Good. Now if you don't mind I'm going back to the dorm and sleep until the ulcer you just caused me is gone, Tony.”
Steve smiles at him, trying to ease the tension that he brought up to the room. “Yeah, pretty much.”
Steve chuckles shaking his head. This is going to be interesting.
Tony doesn't stop murmuring things into his ears the whole time, and hearing his voice is a reminder that he's still here with Steve. He uses it to anchor himself, to shut his mind off from his fears and anxiety of what he could have lost when Tony is right here, in Steve's arms. Battered and weak, but warm and alive.
“Born ready.” Tony says with a blinding smile starting to walk toward the diner.
“Confronted with the reality that we both are way too emotionally involved and probably screwed for life?” Tony jokes, but his voice is trembling as he says it and it falls flat.
“Fucker.”
Steve lets him do it. He can barely think straight right now, and his body is just weightless to him. They get in the car, and when they're almost ten minutes away from the hospital, Steve starts to hyperventilate.
And he thinks: Yeah, I'm happier than I've been in a while, and it's all thanks to Tony being in his life.
“What?” Bucky asks innocently.
“And then you won't be able to get rid of me. Nice to finally meet you.” Clint salutes.
“A kiss?” Steve sasses.
Bucky finally looks up to Steve. “You said he's in college, right?”
Tony huffs. “I might have bruised a few ribs too, one might be actually broken.”
“I would never think that, Steve.” Tony assures, rising his hand to comb back a straight golden lock back into Steve's hair. “We should probably do the presentations soon though, or they'll take matters onto their own hands.”
“Like the first week when you started talking about him.”
His time apart allowed him to rationalize his feelings, and the hard truth came to punch him right in the face.
“Everybody deserves one, Tones.”
Steve smiles back. “Thanks—“
Steve sits up, heaving a sigh. “I don't even know
“I need to meet this Pepper chick.” Bucky comments from his corner.
Tony is hurt. Tony fell from a freaking roof. What if he's too late? What if when he gets there Tony is gone? What if he doesn't at least get to say goodbye? What is he supposed to do? Tony is his
Tony laughs. “Do you still want me to wear your jacket?”
Tony nods, and doesn't say anything as Steve waits expectantly next to him for the questions that are brewing in Tony's head. “But why?” he asks, his need for understanding the world getting the better of him.
When he gets to the place, he is so surprised by what he's seeing that he holds his breath too long and black starts to waver in his vision. Tony tells himself to breathe.
“Nah, I think I will keep that trick tucked away for future use.”
“You kiss your mama with that mouth?” Bucky goats, cackling when Steve tackles him.
“You know why.”
Tony wipes the grease away from his new invention, as he smiles proudly at it. He can't wait to put it to test to revolutionize the train system. Putting the object down on the table, Tony takes a look around his shop for his next project, and it strikes him how much things have changed.
Tony nods content with that answer. “So, now what?”
“Here's your jacket, Steve.” Tony continues, ignoring Steve.
Steve finds Tony seating by the campus fountain. He seems deep in thought and doesn't realize there's company until Steve says hi. Which startles Tony right into the water.
“Maybe we went too far. He seemed kinda upset.” Sam reflects.
Tony points a finger at him. “We never kiss like that in public. Not that I didn't like it, I did, very much.” His eyes go dazed again, and Steve has to hold a chuckle. “But that's beside the point. What's gotten into you?”
