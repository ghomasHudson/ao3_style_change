"Wait," Tony says, the words surprising him even as they leave his mouth.
Steve raises an eyebrow. "Why you and not me? I mean ..."
They descended into silence again, but this time it was more companionable than awkward. As it turned out, the music montage was the conclusion of the documentary segment, and Natasha stopped the program once the credits were rolling, taking them back to the main menu of the streaming video service.
And while he was definitely interested in finding out, he was understandably, forgivably distracted by the feel of Steve’s hand, warm skin and callused fingers, giving a first tentative touch to Tony’s own bare skin, as it slid inside his briefs.
He catches a cab milling about, and it's clear the driver was hoping for a Hightown tourist, given his surprised look when Steve announces, "Lowtown," as his destination.
“Tell that to Spider-Man. He’s probably still trying to pay off that hot dog cart. Remind me to send that guy some money.”
"What interest would they have in Madripoor?" Tony wonders.
." Steve bristled defensively, even though he knew that Tony had no way of knowing that Steve had very legitimate reasons for being out of touch with popular culture. It was all the more irksome that the film currently rolling looked like it came from Steve's era; he must have only just missed it, maybe during the war or just after going into the ice.
“Fuck,” Tony gasped, tipping his head back against the decorative throw pillows. It had been all of ten minutes since they got through the front door, and here he was feeling dangerously close to getting off with all the finesse of a horny teenager.
"Like I did?" Tony asks. His tone is unmistakably bitter, but not quite angry.
Steve dropped his head back down onto Tony's thigh and closed his eyes; it was getting hard to concentrate, with the snow leeching the rest of the warmth from his limbs. They had stupidly run outside without any coats on, and it was beginning to feel uncomfortably like being frozen all over again.
I grew up hearing about how awesome Cap was. I had your poster on my wall until I was eight."
"Oh."
Falcon stared at him for a moment, mouth agape. “I just lost about a thousand bets.”
"Hey, Cap," Tony greets.
Tony sat up straight and, before he quite realized what was happening, found himself tugged onto Steve’s lap. Steve cupped his hand at the back of Tony’s neck and pulled him in close for a kiss, and ... well, that was definitely a surefire way for Steve to take Tony’s mind off things. He had difficulty thinking about very much at any length when he had Steve’s tongue in his mouth, and really, even while Tony had come down here more for simple company than anything else, he could not deny that he found physical intimacy with Steve a great means of winding down after a stressful day.
“Huh.” Tony frowned. “I never knew that. Dad didn’t really talk about the war.”
Zemo's smile only widens. He grabs Steve's chin roughly, and jerks it up so that Steve is forced to look him in the eye. "Tony Stark has been dead for
"It wasn't me," Steve says honestly.
"Okay," he says, turning to expose his jaw to her. "Make it look good."
with that. Steve was gorgeous, weirdly noble, and pretty kind, and Tony didn’t even know the guy’s last name, for all that they had been sleeping together on and off for months. The thing was, Tony didn’t
"Okay, good," Tony said. He sounded relieved. "Smart as Dummy is, I wasn't sure about being mother-henned by my robot."
“When have you ever known me to do the honest or reasonable thing, J?”
At the appearance of the needle, Tony stiffens in apprehension. "Even you can't be that crazy," he says desperately.
"You can do whatever you wish, and I'll support your decision," Jarvis said. He paused, then added, "Unless it's illegal, then I'm afraid I'll have to object."
saved the world.”
Steve Rogers finishes skimming the story of his own retirement, and tries not to find the idea surreal. He lowers the newspaper to the table in front of him, as the rest of the column devolves into a puff piece about Captain America's many accomplishments; Steve remembers it all quite vividly, and has little interest in reliving his 'glory days,' so to speak.
Tony laughed, an awful grating sound that he couldn't believe came from his own throat. "You're the best, Jarvis."
"Hmm." Steve rubbed lightly at Tony's neck, thumb and forefinger offering the barest pressure. "You actually don't have any bruises yet. I'm sure it'll be a few hours before they start to surface."
"I'll stop flying in front of things when you stop getting in the way all the time," Tony answered.
"Maybe later," Steve mimics, and surprises a laugh right out of Tony with his dirty joke.
Iron Man shot into the building, past Cap and toward the Krampus. "Hey, ugly!"
Tony laughs softly. "I'm not sure I'd call all of that
Tony was fairly quiet on the ride over to the house being rented by Steven Larsen and Natalie Rushman, and Steve wondered for a while if Tony was having second thoughts, but once they got inside and stomped the snow off their shoes, Tony made a bee-line for the living room.
Steve hooked his fingers in the waist of Tony’s sweatpants, then made a surprised and pleased little noise when he found they were
"Tony," Steve murmurs. "Do you want me to stop?"
"Uh huh." Tony raised an eyebrow. "It knew I went over the spending limit on Secret Santa, so out with it, Cap."
Steve nods without finding words, mouth slightly agape and eyes wide as he looks up at them. Tony has a large enough ego to know that he and Anthony have to present
"Just a little run down, is all," Tony says. He tugs off the repulsor gauntlet and begins unbuttoning his shirt.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said, having learned a long time ago it was a bad idea to sneak up on or otherwise startle most of his teammates.
"The most realistic way," she says reasonably, "is for me to bring you in as a prisoner."
Steve throws up a hand to protect his face as the surge of energy explodes out. It hits the floor near Madame Hydra's feet and the concussion throws her back several feet, where she lands on her back in a sprawl and lies still. Dead or unconscious, Steve is selfishly unconcerned with her, as across from him Tony crumples to the floor.
Tony took Steve’s hand and guided him back to his apartment, and swore to himself he was going to do something soon, before this could all blow up in his face.
"I guess so." Steve shrugs. "It's ... noble, though. They both accepted their responsibilities."
Natasha didn't comment, but her gaze was a little sharper as she looked back at Tony, thoughtfully tilting her head to one side.
"Well," Pepper says. "See to it that you do - and if you go anywhere interesting, you know you owe me the story first!"
“Maybe if you were a better minion, I’d --” Tony began, but Jameson’s next words gave him pause.
"We've got someone in there who has a real medical degree, too," Banner adds.
Steve woke up from his nap feeling disoriented and a little sluggish. The television had droned on with several more episodes of the show he was watching while he slept, and Steve fumbled for a confused moment before managing to switch off the entertainment system. He rubbed his hands over his face after he sat up, and checked his phone; he had a text from Natasha, reminding him that she would meet him at the party. No getting out of it, then, he decided.
Peggy sighs. "We haven't known the entire time," she says. "We've been tracking him for a few months now, keeping an eye on him."
"If you're sure," Cap said, still looking unconvinced.
Watching Anthony, spooned up against Steve's back, fucking Steve slowly and lazily, perfectly in tune with the languid feeling of the early morning, is even better than Tony would have imagined. He stays on his side in front of Steve, bracketing him in, offering soft kisses and watching the play of expressions over Steve's face.
"Yes." Steve dangled the bottle just in Tony's line of sight.
Tony threw back his head and laughed. "Am I?"
The force of it flings Tony back into the wall, and he barely makes out the concerned yells of Steve and the others before everything goes dark.
The bedroom here is fairly Spartan in design and decor, but it does at least sport a larger bed than the one in Tony's cabin on the dirigible.
Namor adjusts the lamp and sits down at the room's rickety table, gesturing for Steve to join him.
Tony groaned softly for how
"Twenty-six."
worry actively - and often - about messing up a good thing where Steve was concerned.
"I know," Steve said softly. Even if Tony hadn't already mentioned it earlier, that information had also been part of what Agent Coulson imparted when Steve first woke up in the twenty-first century, that Howard Stark's search was continued by SHIELD after his retirement.
"Hey," Tony said after a while.
Steve closes his eyes. "I have responsibilities," he says softly. "I can't just run away from them."
Steve is flushed and breathing hard with the excitement and adrenaline still pumping through his veins. Tony knows the feeling well; he still experiences it each and every time the Iron Man's jet boots take him off the ground, and he's been doing this for years.
By the time Steve's phone finally beeped with the critically low battery warning, it was almost lunch time and he'd blown through a few episodes of the show he was (not really) watching. He debated for a moment between getting his charger to keep playing, and putting the game away - he was up to level 19! - before reluctantly saving and exiting the program.
Tony shook his head. "Don't be," he said. "I'll be fine. I'm pretty sure Jarvis never thought I'd take his advice and run off for twenty-five years, anyway. He never said anything to me about it whenever we talked before he passed, but ... well, I could always tell he didn't exactly approve."
"I'll get the rest," Steve said. "Don't hurt yourself."
Tony was silent for a moment. “I don’t know,” he said at last. “I wouldn’t be so sure.”
Tony is a bit arrogant about it, ultimately; Hydra's disregard of the honorable rules of war aside, he's too valuable for them to kill, and there is absolutely no way they don't know who he is. Tony just hates the thought of riding out the remainder of the war in a POW camp - he definitely isn't giving up
"Then what?" Tony asked.
"All right," said Natasha. "Let's go over it again. You are ..."
Tony sighs, setting his cigarette aside. He reaches up and covers Steve's hand with his own.
"Hmm." The sound Tony made was non-committal; he drank from his beer, then asked, "So, Steve. I can call you Steve, right? What's your story?"
“He’s dangerous, Steve,” Tony said, his heart caught in his throat. He wasn’t sure whether to be touched that Steve was trying to look out for him, or if he wanted to throw up because he had just inadvertently given Steve the knowledge he needed to stop Tony dead in his tracks. The armor had its own separate reactor, but
Steve is dressed down, in just his olive drab Army uniform trousers and a white cotton undershirt bearing the logo of the Strategic Scientific Reserve, when Tony answers the door. He gives a shy smile, eyes darting around to see whether they are alone before he says, "Hi."
It occurs to Steve how that sounds as soon as he sees Tony's face darken. Something in Tony's blue eyes grows sharp, and he goes on the attack.
Tony smiled back. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
While they're preoccupied with each other, Tony grabs the lube and a condom from the bedside table, before settling back to his previous position, content to simply watch until Steve finally pulls away from his kisses with Anthony.
Steve takes the comic book back from Tony, prying it gently from his hands. “I’m sorry. I don’t think it’s easy for them to replicate silver. I can write to Mr. Jameson, see if it can be fixed -”
The door slams open and a tall, broad man in a black and green uniform steps inside. Obviously unprepared for anyone to be present, he only begins to turn at the first sign of Steve's movement, and by then it's too late - Steve hits the Hydra agent soundly with the butt of the gun and watches him go down like a heap of bricks.
In the app store on his phone, Steve searched for the JARVIS application, purchased, and downloaded it. He didn't think he had much use for something like it, but the app was highly rated and had a high number of downloads; at about two dollars, it was rather affordable, but Steve supposed a few million purchases started to add up. He opened the application briefly after it was installed, and was entertained by the pleasant, English-accented voice that greeted him.
"I'll make sure the place is secure," she said. "And I'll bring Steve's car back when I leave. Yours is ... not exactly great for keeping a low profile."
Steve pushed back his cowl and frowned at the other man in concern. “Tony?”
"Steve?" he asked. "If you're not feeling it, I can -"
"Just let me talk to him. Maybe I can figure out what's going on." Steve doesn't mention that he just wants the opportunity to ask his own questions of Tony, but Peggy seems to read it on his face.
“Is it too sappy for me to say I think we’ll always find each other, no matter what life throws at us?” Tony asked.
They shook hands with a sense of urgency, so that Tony could put his back on the leaning stack of cupcake boxes in relatively short order.
“Hey, Tony,” Peter Quill - the man otherwise known as Star Lord, leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy - answered. There was a deep familiarity in his tone that belied his team’s earlier attempts to stop Iron Man in his tracks.
“I read up on you,” Steve admitted after another moment. “After we met. I read about the convoy, and your time in captivity, and ...” He took a careful breath before finishing, “I want you to know whatever it is, you don’t need to feel self-conscious with me. If you just
“Worked together before?” Tony asked. “I rest my case.”
a thing, I don't want to think about it." He paused. "In fact, it worries me a little that you
Steve resolutely attempted to put all that from his mind, but if he was going ahead and flinging himself into associating with Tony - instead of wasting these days prior to the holidays and the start of the next semester simply getting used to the town and soaking up the local color - he supposed he should get to know more about the man.
"You know what?" Tony said. "I don't even wanna ask."
"I didn't expect it to take so long," Tony says, groaning.
“I … you know, I don’t know, either.” Steve paused. “Maybe because you get into an office and your brain won’t shut off, and you come up with young superhero scholarship funds.”
It was obvious to Steve, now, that it was ridiculous of him to feel jealous of whatever bond Tony shared with the outlaw known as Star Lord. Trust was as important here as it had been on the battlefield, and there was no reason for Steve to doubt
"It's Commander now, actually," Steve says with a tiny smile. "But just Steve is fine."
Steve took the lead once they were further inside. Both he and Iron Man had studied the blueprints, and while Iron Man was armored, Cap was in a better position for close quarters contact right now, especially as the corridors narrowed and allowed the armor less space to maneuver.
"I saw the covers of
"My research," Sternberg mumbles. "Mustn't let them get their hands on it ..."
On the other side of the room, the woman laughs. "By my count, Commander," she says, "you're out of ammunition. Come out, and we can discuss this like civilized adults."
"The more he does know," said Coulson, "the more he'll give himself away. I believe the key is forcing Stark to a point where the evidence is irrefutable."
That did not, however, preclude the place from being booby-trapped. As Steve grabbed the comparatively small box they were after and tucked it under his arm, he handily forgot everything he ever learned from reading
Steve brushed his fingertips around the metal lip of the casing, then smoothed them across the surface, huffing a little laugh of surprise. “It’s warm.”
“I just wanted to apologize for earlier,” Quill said, “and make sure you’re okay.”
“Some things do, some things don’t,” Natasha said. “In this case, we err on the side of caution and say, if there
for the second time in a day.
Steve shifted, pushing up on an elbow to look down at Tony. “Is that what they’re calling it these days?”
"I wasn't just being nice," Tony says.
Anthony nods. "Iron Man," he answers, and looks at Steve. "You're still Captain America?"
Steve Rogers is amazing. Seeing him in action as Captain America is a wonder, and the man beneath the flag is every bit as good and noble as the cause he supports. But Steve is also funny, sarcastic, stubborn, and not afraid to stand up to Tony, which is not something Tony has experienced very much in his life. In fact, Tony has something of a tendency to surround himself with those few people who won't deal with his bullshit; Jim, Pepper, Jarvis, and now Steve, they're all willing to take Tony down a notch or two when required.
>>Not really.
Catching the hand that Tony has in his hair, Steve brings it to his lips and presses a kiss to Tony's knuckles. "We're together
"Alright?" Tony asks, leaning down for a kiss.
"I might be convinced to slow down ever so often."
"God, Steve." Tony pauses for a moment, hands gripping tightly at Steve's hips. "I forgot how badly you always wanted it."
"I'm awake," Tony says, running his hand further up Steve's thigh. "Mm, someone else is awake, too."
"I asked how you slept," Natasha told him. She didn't even try to make it sound sincere.
"Morning, Phil," Tony said.
"It's ... different," Steve decided. "I'm trying to make myself useful. Keep busy."
"Shut up," Steve says, and kisses him.
- was still watching him warily, as if he expected Tony to run away screaming in the face of chiseled perfection.
"Because we don't have to be ... more than that," Steve went on.
"Well, D-U-M-hyphen-E, pronounced
on Steve's hair. Steve responds to the rougher handling with a moan, and picks up the pace, drawing a surprised sound out of Anthony. Only when the noises Anthony is making get higher pitched, more desperate, does Steve pull off, experience with Tony telling him - correctly - that his efforts are bringing things a little
"When you kissed me," Tony leads, breaking his resolve just a little.
"What is the meaning of this!?" Sternberg demands.
Assistant Principal Philip Coulson seemed to share exactly two things in common with Tony Carbonell: a love of doughnuts, and a particular interest in Captain America. It was therefore unsurprising when Tony appeared at first sight of the box Phil brought into the teachers lounge, with a Captain America coffee mug clutched in one hand.
"She's coming back with me from New York, you know," Steve answers. "She wants to visit. Jarvis is coming in the dirigible to pick me up."
Steve smiled. “Good.”
"I'd like that," Steve said, smiling as he wrapped his towel around his waist. "I should get back to my room for clothes, though ..."
"I'm sorry," Steve said again, feeling frustratingly helpless. "Is there anything I can do?"
Anthony blinks. "Yes."
. He broke away from the kiss to cry, "Get down!" before throwing himself bodily into Tony.
"I need transportation," says Steve. "A way into Madripoor without detection, and I know you still have connections in Buccaneer Bay. You can get me in without papers."
“Negative,” Steve said. “We’d be dropping a bomb that would blow up half the city.”
Now was the tricky part: pretending that the Captain had just snuck aboard, that Steve and Tony had not known each other for weeks now. Steve was not a great actor, but he infused command into his voice as he asked, “What’s your endgame, Stark?”
"I've always liked being on the cutting edge of technology," Tony said, laughing. "App development was a good way to make money, when smartphones took off. No one really thinks much of you building a new house and buying a nice car when you're a self-made millionaire."
Anthony tips his head back against Tony's shoulder when he comes, pulsing out over Steve's chest and hand, and the way he clenches around Tony is enough to take Tony along for the ride in relatively short order. Tony's hips falter and he hauls Anthony back, getting as deep inside as Tony can go as he comes long and hard, muffling any noises he might make against the skin of Anthony's shoulder.
"I get it." Tony nudged Steve in the side with his knee. "Look, I'm sorry if I left you in suspense. I'm not too good with the whole feelings thing."
"I don't know." Peggy gets down a teapot and cups from the cabinet. "It's ... suspicious. I can't say Tony Stark isn't a person of interest to us right now."
“So,” Tony said after a moment, breaking the silence. “… can I come read reports with you more often?”
"Come for a visit any time," Steve adds.
She only shook her head in response. "Nothing."
“I’m not getting any younger!” Tony couldn’t help calling after Steve’s retreating back.
“I was just getting ready to open this up,” Natasha said, gesturing to the box.
The next morning, Tony wakes up to find Steve and Anthony in the small kitchen on their floor, Steve making pancakes for breakfast. Tony makes a bee-line for the coffee pot, joining Anthony at the breakfast bar just as Steve begins to set out the plates. Anthony looks better today, less morose and verging on cheerful in Steve's company, freshly showered and dressed once again in a set of clothes Tony recognizes as his own. Yesterday's downer attitude may well have been the result of post-stasis sickness, and undoubtedly a night of real sleep has done wonders for Anthony.
"It is," Steve insists, shaking his head. "I should have been more careful. I should have watched my own back."
Tony makes a sound of agreement, leaning over to rest his head on Steve's shoulder. "And what will you do here in Madripoor?"
Tony pauses, wanting to wait and hear what Anthony has to say about it, independent of any urging, but as the pause lingers, he wonders quietly, "Having second thoughts?"
"Iron Man, wait!" Cap shouted.
"Thanks," Tony said, smiling at Steve.
"Clint is just being a child," Natasha said, with a roll of her eyes. "He's upset that Coulson didn't choose him instead of you for this assignment."
Suddenly bathed in the blue-white glow of the arc reactor shining from the center of Tony’s chest, Steve hitched a breath.
"Gloating," Tony says, stopping himself at the last moment before he can reach up and touch the side of his neck. "That's all."
"Huh." Clint looked thoughtful. "You think you've got trouble?"
Tony clears his throat and makes his footsteps louder than necessary to announce his presence. Anthony drops his hand from the tank like he's been burned, and abruptly turns to Tony.
these days."
Steve closed his mouth; opened it again. "Why?"
I call you?"
By virtue of working in a building where the Fantastic Four lived and worked, the civilians inside knew better than to test fate; they were dispersing like the ants in a scattered hill, moving away from the danger in a surprisingly orderly fashion.
"I'm SHIELD's mole," she says quietly. "I can't carry identification, so I don't know how else to prove myself to you, but I'm lowering my weapon to the floor right now."
"Steve," Tony says. "As glad as I am to see you, I'm having trouble figuring out what you want from me."
Coulson raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "As a native Iowan, you run the risk of having your cover blown." He politely refrained from pointing out that he knew that the law enforcement officer who came to deliver the news of Clint's parents' deaths was from Cedar Falls.
. Which was Tony’s entire reason for not being able to give up sleeping with him. Really. It had nothing to do with him being good or noble or kind or ...)
"That gauntlet you had fit like a glove," Steve says. He winds his arms around Tony and pitches his voice low. "I'm sure you can make armor that's like a second skin."
"The hotel?"
Steve took that as a good sign, and closed the rest of the distance between them, to wrap his arms around Tony’s waist. Tony relaxed as he leaned into the embrace and Steve relaxed with him, relieved that some of the tension between them had finally ebbed.
the Avengers started trying to kick our asses.”
“It could be booby-trapped,” Steve says.
of us like to face our fears."
"Well," Anthony says, obviously trying to lighten the mood. "I hope no supervillains try to attack the second we get home, because I'm way too sore to fight them off."
"I guess it's not hard for me to think of Jarvis as a father figure, either," Tony admits. He shakes his head, and Steve reaches for his hand under the table, squeezing it lightly in reassurance. "Sorry. If I keep getting hung up on all the differences, we'll never get you home."
"Okay," Steve said. "Pretty sure that just limits me to 'don't drink Swedish vodka' ..."
"But his appointment with you -" Steve begins, before his enhanced hearing catches a sound that is out of place: a sliding door? "Are we alone, Doctor?"
>So no plans, then?
Peggy urges Steve back to his chair with a gentle but firm hand on his shoulder. "Howard Stark's closest friends and family didn't know what was the matter when he started to change."
Tony made a completely undignified noise that was definitely not a squeak (it was
“Morning.” Steve took a sip of his coffee, before shuffling to his feet, taking the bagel along as he headed over to examine Tony’s work.
The living room was a mess of shredded wrapping paper, packaging, mugs, and glasses. Steve picked his way around the room cleaning it all up, careful not to disturb the sleeping super spies. When he was finished, though, he
"I was just going to ... hit the showers," Steve said. He meant it to be an invitation, and wasn't sure it had worked until Tony reached up and pushed the cowl back from Steve's face as well.
He knew what Coulson's plan came around to: make the evidence so irrefutable that Tony could no longer deny his identity. But then what? Tony obviously wasn't just playing around here, a billionaire on holiday, the way that SHIELD presented him. This was a man with a life, a job he obviously enjoyed, friends, and a place in the community.
we doing this in a bed, again?"
Tony holds up the hand that Steve just released. "If you're going to say, 'doing his duty' or 'looking out for the welfare of the American people,' then you can save it, kid."
," Steve said, nipping at Tony's jaw. "We're not doing that, standing up, in your shower. That's an accident waiting to happen."
>My plans canceled. I'm sitting here with a lot of beer, movies, and Chinese food, if you're interested.
"How did you know what that thing was?"
"Sorry," Steve says quickly. "Just -" And he can't think of anything to say that isn't too much, that isn't pinning his heart right on his sleeve, so he tugs Tony back up so that they can kiss.
Natasha didn't judge when Steve asked about Tony's current whereabouts, and she drove him to the middle school without question. It was still early in the morning and the parking lot stood nearly empty, except for Tony's car in one of the faculty spots. Natasha parked, and silently handed Steve a key. He let himself into the school, where he finally found Tony in his science classroom.
"Tony!" Steve rushes to the man's side, and gathers Tony into his arms. "Tony?"
While Tony paced restlessly, Steve shifted to look at the things on the desk: a pile of Christmas cards from his students, a Teacher of the Year award, that ridiculous Captain America coffee mug. He sighed to himself. There was an entire life here that Tony was giving up. It didn't seem fair.
Anthony groans, tipping his head back against Tony's shoulder as he
The masked hero, whose identity beneath the winged cowl remains classified, had a hand in a number of Allied victories during the war. For his work as leader of the campaign against the Nazi science division known as HYDRA, Captain America was awarded with a number of accolades, along with the unidentified members of his specialist team, known as the Howling Commandos.
Tony snorted softly, waving a hand in a flailing fashion that narrowly missed clipping Steve on the chin. “So, what, you think there’s a world where we’re all good guys?”
Sternberg immediately crosses to the counter and begins gathering up bottles and vials. He uncaps them hastily, and pours their contents down the drain of the nearby handwashing sink.
"So," Tony goes on after a moment. "While Zemo was still in the process of taking over, Howard got paranoid. He knew there was something after him, he just couldn't figure out what it was. Couldn't get his mind clear enough to understand it, to articulate it to anyone else. So he got paranoid, decided the Iron Man - which he meant to be a robot - was the solution."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said. "Steve can come back and play with you later." He plucked the bag of food from Steve's hand, and inhaled deeply. "Ahh, just in time. I am starving. Rhodey is missing out - more for us."
"With pleasure," Zemo answers. The repulsor charges up with a whine, and he spins to turn it on Madame Hydra.
"I'd appreciate it."
Steve gently plucked the card from Tony’s hands and looked at it; he took out the photo and looked at that, too, and whatever he was looking for in it, it made him smile. Then his gloved index finger ran down over the spot where Tony’s dad signed, and he exhaled a sigh, reaching up to push back his cowl.
Steve thought her step was a little
to get with you in another universe?"
Steve drops his face into his hands and takes a deep breath, trying to pull himself together. Peggy is still staring at him, he knows, but the whistling of the kettle makes her turn away. When he looks up again, Peggy is setting the tea service on the table.
Natasha raised her eyebrows. "You're going to put up a tree on Christmas Eve?"
In what felt like a rather deliberate move on Steve's part, Steve came first, moaning low in his throat as he pulsed out over his own hand. He surged forward as he did, taking Tony so deep that his nose ended up pressed into the dark hair surrounding Tony's cock, and then Tony was coming without any warning, right down Steve's throat. Steve swallowed every last bit, and even licked him clean before pulling off.
Iron Man set the box aside and turned to look at Steve. She was tall for a woman, and sitting down, they were nearly at eye level with each other.
“I’m not ...” Steve paused, taking a deep breath, and forced himself to remain calm and objective. Except that objectivity was difficult for him, when Peter Quill’s easygoing smile kept popping into Steve’s head.
Steve laughed, an exhilarated sound. "
Steve frowned. “Some kind of instinct. Muscle memory. Like we ...”
Steve would grab Tony down corridors after press conferences, press him up the wall and get a hand down his trousers sometimes and jerk him off right there, rutting against Tony's hip until they were both messy and Tony's - mercifully dark, usually, on those occasions - suit would be a complete ruin.
Tony's expression took on a searching appearance as he walked over to pat Dum-E somewhere just below the reindeer antlers. "Meeting my robot and original experiment into very rudimentary artificial intelligence and that's what you take away from what I just said?"
"Naughty, yeah, yeah," Iron Man answered, barreling toward the Krampus.
Tony Stark looked up from repairs to one of his armor boot jets, in time to see his own armored face flash across the screen, followed by the questionably good company of the Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Falcon.
did, in fact," Tony said, grinning as he recalled his earlier words.
Tony blinked, trying to figure out if she was messing with him. Captain America was alive, after seventy years spent sleeping in ice; his partner could very well be a very convincing robot, for all Tony knew.
“We're all on the most wanted list, but have any of us actually taken a life?” Tony said. “I'm guessing we're not very good at being bad guys.”
Any doubt that might have been in Steve's mind that Tony was simply humoring him was laid to rest by the way Tony kissed him, like Tony was worried Steve might be the one with second thoughts. Steve struggled to slow the kiss, a difficult but not insurmountable task even with Tony's tongue in his mouth, but he didn't fight the way Tony had rucked up the hem of Steve's ill-gotten shirt.
“I hope for both our sakes you’re right,” Tony said softly, leaning into the touch. “Because it’s gonna be a hell of a disappointment if this is all there is.”
The next day was Christmas Eve, and Steve woke up and went on his usual morning run, noting all the Christmas decorations lining the street along the way. The house that he and Natasha were sharing looked plain and a bit sad in comparison. Steve figured it was understandable, considering they had only just moved in - and were not, actually, permanent residents - but he decided that they needed at least a tree.
It wasn't that Steve
Steve folds himself into the chair opposite Namor, and places his hands on the tabletop in clear view.
Finally moving at that urging, Tony shifts closer and lets Anthony reach up and grab his hip, drawing him in. Tony moans quietly as his cock slides past his alternate's lips, into the hot wetness of his mouth and over his tongue, and fuck, Tony has always thought he must give an excellent blow job but there's no way like
"Family to visit," Coulson said (lied). "I've got a sister in D.C."
And there were also nights like tonight, where Steve dropped in through the open window and molded himself against Tony’s back, and they ended up making a complete mess sweeping papers and parts off Tony’s workbench so that Steve could bend him over it.
“Don’t worry about it, gorgeous,” Tony said, and he meant it. A pair of ruined trousers was a very small price to pay for what he found inside Steve’s. Tony wrapped his hand around the man’s dick, and even half-hard it was impressive, eagerly swelling under Tony’s attentions.
Tony opened his mouth, gestured silently again, and closed his mouth when it seemed no words were forthcoming.
Tony wishes desperately that he were conscious enough to take advantage of that fact. "Sorry."
"I really hope you don't mind me sticking close," Steve said, once they were inside. "I'm a little worried if I lose you, I won't find you again before midnight."
Steve isn't entirely sure how to answer, still isn't sure whether he can trust Tony. Even telling him this might be too much.
“Nah.” Tony stepped aside and gestured at the single pot on a burner next to the griddle where a pair of sandwiches seared away. “It’s just grilled cheese and tomato soup.”
, but Steve always brushed off the suggestions. When the right person came along, Steve would know.
Tony was entirely uncertain what to
Steve pulls a face. "Let's not go getting ahead of ourselves."
“It’s okay,” Tony said honestly, reaching out to pat Steve’s arm. “Little hard to go from babysitting your boyfriend to, uh ... yeah.”
mean a lot to me, Steve," Tony blurts, almost awkward about it.
Steve weighed the possibility. "But there's proof ..."
"I still need to come up with a game plan," Tony said. "I don't think waltzing into the boardroom demanding my birthright is going to go over as well as it does in the movies."
The thought was enough to jar Tony back to reality for a moment - to wonder what the hell he was doing - but then Steve kissed him again, soft and sweet, and he batted Tony’s hand away to stroke Tony off himself, his large hand engulfing Tony’s cock in warmth and the kind of friction that sent a shiver down his spine.
” JARVIS replied.
"I'd like that," Steve says.
"Dr. Sternberg ... I'm just trying to look out for Mr. Stark's best interests. Is there anything you can tell me?"
A moment of awkward silence passed before Steve cleared his throat. “So, uh ...”
Tony drops back into the pillows after he's disposed of the condom, and reaches for Steve.
"Quickly, quickly," he urges, closing the door as soon as Steve is over the threshold. Sternberg clicks two deadbolts and a chain into place before shuffling past, the gun still clenched loosely in one hand. "What can I do for you, Captain?"
, Tony?"
,” JARVIS answered, “
Tony peeled out of his torn clothes and left them in a heap on the bathroom floor, and dozed his way through a shower, spent mostly leaning against the tile with his eyes closed. He half-heartedly scrubbed at his skin, but for the most part let the pounding spray of the shower blast off any dirt and ease his aching muscles.
has sex hair, anyway.
"I wanted to say I'm sorry for your loss," Jarvis said. "I know that Howard was getting along in years, but I believe we'd all rather begun to think he'd live forever."
"I've got lube in the --" Tony began.
“Okay,” Clint said after a beat. “I’ve got half a dozen pizzas coming with my name on them, so I’d better head upstairs before Thor and the Hulk eat all of ’em.”
This one is a woman, but Steve doesn't hesitate for that fact, quickly swinging his leg out in a kick at the backs of her knees. She goes down, but twists with the momentum to land on her back, bringing her pistol up to bear.
Steve smiled. “A conflict of interest, to be sure. But you still didn’t answer my question.”
Tony yelped in surprise as he was lifted off his feet, and he reflexively wound his arms around Steve's neck and his legs around Steve's waist. "Oh my God," he said, laughing nervously. "You are something else, Steve."
"Um. Hello?" Steve called.
When the doctor came out to announce the long awaited Anthony Edward was, in fact, Natasha Elizabeth, all eyes in the waiting room turned to the expectant father.
"No." Steve sits up straighter, tries to control the racing of his heart, the way his hearing is nearly drowned by the rush of blood to his head. "I haven't seen Tony in two years. No one has."
The back of Steve's neck feels suddenly hot with the anger that surges through him. "You
Steve shrugged. "I'm sorry I lied to you."
"Nine." Natasha split away so that they could sidestep a pair of slow-moving tourists. When she moved close again, she added, "Coulson's back in town."
When Steve closes his mouth over the head of Tony's cock, tilts his head to take Tony into his mouth, Tony makes a sound that banishes all of Steve's doubts. Tony cards his fingers through Steve's hair, and Steve goes at it with relish, licking and sucking until Tony tugs at his hair in warning to stop.
Tony's nose has stopped bleeding by the time the bath is filled, and Tony steps into the large clawfoot tub after Steve, allowing Steve to draw him back against his chest.
Steve shrugged. "Nice, I guess."
Steve dropped his hands from Tony's shoulders; he could feel his own face fall, but he tried to fight it. "Is that what you want?" he asked.
It has been days since they were last able to find time for this kind of intimacy, and Tony very much
“If it was dangerous,” Tony says, “the Nazis wouldn’t be carrying it around on a submarine, would they?”
Once he settles in behind Anthony, Tony moves slowly in pressing inside, and it isn't hard to take his time; it's an amazingly tight fit, Anthony stretching around him while at the same time Steve's cock is hard against Tony's own. Steve feels more tense than either Anthony or Tony, his thighs rigid with the effort of not moving, and once Tony finally has his hips flush against Anthony's ass, they're all breathing hard from the intensity of it all.
Tony peered at Steve for a moment. "He's spoken pretty highly of you to the other members of the faculty," he said. "I get it, though. Don't wanna talk about your new boss the first day of the job."
Steve laughed. It definitely sounded nervous. "Undercover work just ... isn't my thing."
Steve reached up, cupping Tony's cheek in his hand. "Like I said, I know a little something about what it's like to leave the life you've known and try to fit in a new one. And ... I'm sorry."
"Well, come on. Let me buy you a drink, Cap, then I'll show you the Iron Man. I have it on good authority that you're dying to see it."
Steve pulled a face. "I'm not sexually attracted to the Grim Reaper, Tony."
kind of what this line of work is about, Steve."
"Get me in close?" Cap asked.
"I just told you, Commander, it is secret." Sternberg waves impatiently.
"He was a veteran, too. After the war, he had a hard time finding work," Steve says. "So he drowned his sorrows in the bottle. I think ... in a way, he gradually slipped away, too. Became someone else, someone unrecognizable."
“No way,” the Hulk rumbled.
The first touch of Steve's hands, to each of his feet, sent an anticipatory shiver running down Tony's spine. Steve's touch was careful, the pressure that he applied to the arches of Tony's feet gentle but firm. Tony was a sucker for a foot rub, like anyone with a job that had them on their feet a lot, and Steve was good at it, his big hands more precise and skilled than his appearance would let on.
By the time Steve got back to his temporary home, the house was dark except for a light in the kitchen. Steve let himself in and was surprised to find Clint in the kitchen, making breakfast.
“Tony,” Steve said firmly. “You did what you thought was right, what was necessary. I might have been frustrated by it at the time, but if you had been out there worrying about what happened to everyone else, then it would have made you a liability. I know we’ve had a lot of arguments over this in the past, but in this case - it was right. You saved the world.”
Steve knows from experience that Namor could be more difficult than this. He'll take what he can get. "Fair enough."
“Okay, Steve,” Tony finally managed to say. “Call me Tony.”
"That's true."
Tony declared that he rather liked it that way, anyway; that a memento to remind him of the hard times was a much better means of keeping himself grounded. And, he'd admitted, he sort of liked being able to look down and see his heart thrumming away strongly in his chest, free at last of the repulsor pump and the hundreds of volts of electricity that had kept it going for years.
lie - to Steve and to the rest of the team - and it wasn’t as if it was just a personal issue between them. Captain America was functionally Iron Man’s second-in-command, so it was Steve’s responsibility to confront the matter, but he didn’t have it in him to argue.
Tony’s stubborn expression softened. “Steve,” he said quietly. “All I want is to look outside and see this city is still standing, and
Steve laughs softly, leaning over to kiss Tony, but he pauses when he notices a trickle of red in Tony's mustache. "Tony - you're bleeding."
"Hmm?"
?" Tony demanded.
“How about a warning next time?!” Hawkeye demanded as he righted himself.
"Rogers," says Namor, curt and pleasant as ever.
The quinjet rocked beneath them again, as alarms began to blare from the controls.
Steve spent part of the day acquainting himself with some of the art supplies he'd picked up in town - the set of beakers he got at Tony's party came in handy as holders for his pens and pencils - and enjoying some time to himself. The peace and quiet was good for reflection; Steve hadn't much liked being alone with his own thoughts, early on after waking from the ice, always finding something to keep himself busy, but now he appreciated the opportunity to sort the jumble.
Steve didn't look at her scrutinizing expression for long, just worked on cracking eggs into a bowl. "He invited me to hang out."
"I need to do some work today," he says after a while. "But ... being here with you, it's nice."
Tony couldn't help blurting out, "You are?"
," Steve said, even as his hand settled on the curve of Tony's ass. "But I have a hard time saying no to you."
Tony laughed softly. "No. Just ... hmm, you know, gotta gloat a little."
"Can I help?" Tony asks.
"Hmm." Steve raised an eyebrow. "Turn over? I didn't get your front."
Tony blinks down at the comic book he's now holding, a bright new copy of CAPTAIN AMERICA #8, so fresh off the press that it still smells heavily of ink. On the cover (which probably has very little to do with the contents of the interior, a thread Tony has found rather common in comic books), Captain America has clearly been caught mid-jump away from an explosion, held under his arms by the gauntlets of the Iron Man armor.
A part of Steve thrilled, in spite of his exhaustion and the numerous other things weighing on his mind at the moment. Getting to be in a
to install a washer and dryer for you.”
Tony stared. "But - we're just going to get dirty again?"
"Shh!" Steve interrupts in a harsh whisper. "Doctor, please try to remain calm, but there's someone else in the house."
“Cap?” she asked, voice ringing with a note of concern. “Are you with me?”
"What," Iron Man said. "Doom was feeling festive?"
," Steve said sharply. "Stop."
"So," Anthony asks, once he's popped the last bite of syrupy pancakes into his mouth. "What's on the agenda for today?"
"Hmm." Steve still looks skeptical, but that doesn't stop him from kissing Tony again. "Okay, be careful. Try not to wake him up until I get back?"
“If that’s what it takes to make you blush,” Steve said, “then I’ll go up to the roof of the tower and sing your praises.”
Deliberately, Tony set his fork back into his container of rice. "You mean you've never seen
Tony was sitting on the edge of his desk, staring blankly forward at all the seats, usually occupied by his students, and standing empty now. The lights were out in the room, but the early morning sun seemed too bright as it reflected off the snow outside and filtered in through the blinds.
Tony shrugged, swallowed his bite of doughnut and slurped at his coffee. "Nah, just the party. You know, the one you're missing out on?"
"That's what I've been trying to figure out," Coulson said. "I've been in deep cover as the assistant principal at the junior high where he works as a science teacher. We've managed to acquire DNA for testing, and even the man's dental records. He's a match for Stark."
"I don't --" Tony began, but he was cut off by Steve's heavy sigh.
Natasha looked like she couldn't come up with any compelling reason why not, so she shrugged in return. "Okay, then. You're awfully cheerful today."
At midnight, they decided to go ahead and exchange gifts, and Steve didn't argue, given he couldn't imagine either Clint or Natasha feeling up to it the next morning. He was touched by the gift of a novel and a new notebook from Natasha, and laughed good naturedly at the American flag boxers from Clint.
It isn't exactly what Tony expected. He shakes his head, leaning forward to meet Anthony's gaze. "I'm sure any number of people would say it's me finally coming to the realization that the perfect person for me is, well,
"Sort of." Tony pushed up from the desk and wandered over to the row of computers. "I always had an interest in robotics, since I was a kid. Back before I ended up on my current career path. My interest didn't evaporate fully, obviously."
"So impatient," Tony says, turning his head to kiss Steve's knee, hitched up beside him. "We finally have all the time in the world, and you're in a hurry."
“And we care
to go to a three o'clock meeting," he said, trying to keep it casual, but his voice was ever so slightly hoarse, and his mouth still looked far too well-fucked for Tony to think he could get away with looking anything but.
Steve stomped snow off his shoes and kicked off the shoes themselves, leaving them by the door as he walked further into the kitchen. He peeled out of his cold weather gear and draped it across one of the kitchen chairs, then sat down at the breakfast bar that separated the kitchen from the tiny dining room area.
Steve drew out after giving himself a moment to recover, and Tony made a soft noise of protest before Steve hauled him up and pushed Tony back into his desk chair. Steve had an intense look on his face, eyes dark, brows drawn together, as he went down to his knees in front of Tony and leaned in.
"He fits the profile," said Coulson. He set his files and his tablet down on the desk, and went to the filing cabinet by the window, where a single-cup coffee maker sat. He loaded a single serving coffee pod into it, set his mug under the dispenser, and pressed the button, trying very hard not to rub his aching forehead while Barton persisted.
It was just as well, at any rate, as Steve chose that moment to emerge from the bedroom. He was dressed similarly to Tony, in a pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt (and yes, the t-shirt was just as criminally tight-fitting as Tony imagined it would be), and he had his nose stuck in his phone as he walked, fingers moving rapidly over the screen. Tony could hear the sounds of Tiny Robots coming from the phone as Steve walked closer, and it brought a smile to his lips.
Everything is ostensibly over; the Hydra agents have been rounded up, Madame Hydra has been arrested, and Agent Drew is in with Agent Carter for debriefing. No one tried to invite Steve along; even General Fury's usual scowl softened upon looking at Steve, when he showed up with SHIELD's specialist a little while ago.
Steve Rogers had his own washing machine - a dryer, too - back at his apartment in DC, up until SHIELD rolled in and stripped the place bare of all of Steve’s personal effects while he was Public Enemy No. 1, leaving the poor guy to start all over … again.
Steve leans in and Tony does his best to stoop down in the unwieldy armor - usually, he finds his designs sleek and graceful, but today could see a compelling reason to streamline - but the War Machine (Jim had not gone subtle with his moniker, even rejecting Tony's cheeky suggestion of rebranding as 'Iron Patriot') is on the approach, carrying Steve's partner on his boot.
"Uhhh. Tony," Steve said. "What are you doing here?"
Tony's blue eyes are still tired and heavy lidded, but the little smile he gives back is the most beautiful thing Steve has ever seen.
“You see right through me,” Tony said. “It would just be a more ... subtle way of lending him a hand. Financially speaking.”
Anthony shakes his head, laughing softly. "No. It's a little late for that, isn't it?"
Steve cocks his head to the side, putting a hand out to rest on the small of Tony's back. "What?"
"Hold that thought," Steve says, oblivious to what Tony was about to say, as someone knocks on the door. He rolls out of bed and hops into his pants, stepping over to the door.
"What we can't determine," said Fury, "is whether he's hiding for a reason or if there's something the matter with his memory. I sought out Stark a few years ago on business with SHIELD, and he denied being Anthony Stark, or even knowing who Howard Stark was."
"I'd only hoped, much as I believe your father and mother did, that you would be a little older when all this became yours to worry about."
"I know." Tony smiles down at Steve, and tries to let go of his worries relating to Anthony. "Steve, I -"
“Did you need something, Hawkeye?” Steve asked.
Crossing over from Lowtown to Hightown is like entering another country. The streets become well-paved, the shops and buildings kept up to a high standard of attractiveness, gleaming signs beckoning to the wealthy. The Sovereign Hotel is the largest and most luxurious of all the hotels in Hightown, and the prevalence of western travelers means that Steve is spared hardly a second glance as he slips through the lobby. Espionage work has never come easy to him - even if General Fury did once say he was amazing at bullshit - but Steve has learned, over the years, that simply moving like you have a purpose can be amazingly useful in keeping questions at bay.
The faceplate snapped down again, and this time Tony took off without looking back. He crashed through the glass and took the bomb with him as he went, flying straight up and away from them and the city below.
Tony's entire body felt like one big bruise at this point, after being slammed around in the jungle without any armor. He didn't like admitting to his own shortcomings, but Tony knew that out of the armor, he was outmatched in physical prowess by pretty much all the other members of the team, even the ones who were regular human beings.
"People don't know who I am," Steve said. "Officially, it's not been disclosed that I'm alive. Most of my old friends are dead. The time I've spent here ... it's the first time I've really felt at
Steve huffed. "Grim Reaper's mask looks like a salad fork."
"Whatever your reasons were for leaving, Tony," Steve says, opening his eyes again. "I'm sure they were valid ones. Look, I ... shouldn't have said some of the things I did about your leaving. I was just hurt that you didn't say goodbye to me, but I know it's not about me."
"Fine," Tony relents. "What would you like to talk about, Commander?"
Their hips fit together neatly that way, and Tony wrapped his hand around them both while Steve rocked into the friction of the touch. Steve felt a little self-conscious of the knowledge that he wasn't going to last very long like this, but even in their short time together, they'd danced around this attraction enough to set them both on edge.
"I'm getting the idea," Steve says, leaning in again. "But ... I might need a little more convincing."
"Tell me about it," Steve said, laughing softly. He knew Natasha would chide them both for not sticking to their cover right now, but there was no one around to hear, and they swept the place for bugs on a daily basis.
The thought clearly did not deter Tony, or his own desires; Steve’s attempts to wriggle out were clearly doing more harm to his cause than good. What
Steve sent back a response of "Merry Christmas!" anyway, and was surprised when his phone pinged again a moment later.
"I'm not sure how much more I have to tell," Steve says honestly. Eventually, Pepper will have to start making things up, or the stories in
"We went to college together."
A chorus of greetings went up around the room.
“Wagner,” she explained. “Ludwig was fascinated by his operas. The painting on the lid is from
Steve used one of his hands to grip Tony's hip, and slid the other down between his own legs, and it was all Tony could do not to let his knees give out as he watched Steve reach inside his sweatpants and stroke himself. That urge only grew worse as Steve tugged at Tony's hip, urging him forward.
"So ..." Tony cleared his throat. "If I were to ask you back to my place, would there be a ... conflict of interest?"
Steve unfastened Tony's jeans, and slowly went down to his knees in front of Tony; if anyone were to walk in on them now, there would be no denying what Steve was doing. The thought made Tony's arousal peak rather painfully, his cock hardening until it was a relief when Steve finally tugged down Tony's boxers and let Tony's erection spring free.
He gets up and tugs on his trousers, and double checks the apartment to make sure all signs of Tony's presence are gone. In the light of early morning, the place looks even shabbier than it had the night before. The living space is divided up into a sitting area, which half runs into the space where the bed and a rickety dresser comprise a bedroom of sorts. Under the window is a tiny table with two chairs; the surface of the table is covered in precariously stacked papers.
Steve was cheerful, humming to himself as he went about breakfast, cracking eggs into a bowl and setting bacon sizzling in a pan. The smell of food brought the other Avengers in the tower trickling in after a while, of course, and Tony was secretly relieved, even if it didn't escape his notice that Steve actually looked disappointed by their arrival.
"Steve," Tony says, gravely serious now. "I spent almost the entirety of the war running missions in the Iron Man, part of that time powering it with my own heart, which was already bad. I can hardly go up a flight of stairs now without getting winded."
kissing, to a bit of canoodling and some heavy petting, Tony remains conscientious of Steve's professed lack of experience. Steve has recently seemed eager to find enough privacy for more extensive exploration, which led them here tonight, but it's still a surprise when Steve is the one to say, "Come on, let's go to bed."
any more cliched, Baron?" Tony demands, grunting as one of the soldiers nudges him roughly toward a chair.
It was a good thing, in fact, that Iron Man had brought him along, as they finally reached an area that was impassible by the armor, where it looked as if an explosive had collapsed a portion of the wall. Steve squeezed into a gap in the piled broken stones, and shimmied a few feet in before he called back, “It’s too deep for us to dig out. I can go ahead, grab the artifact.”
“Well,” Steve said, “I only made it that far because Peggy Carter enlisted your father to fly us into enemy territory so I could make the drop. It looked like a suicide mission at the time, but Howard never flinched.”
Steve kisses further down the side of Tony's neck, and pauses with his chin resting on Tony's shoulder. "Why not?" he wonders.
"Be hounded by the press for the rest of my natural life," Tony added, when Steve looked up. "Jump through hoops to prove I am really who I say I am."
Tony sighed to himself. He had been hoping to avoid a lecture from Steve, especially on the heels of the bet he practically lost, but really, Tony knew it was unfair to blame Steve for that.
Tony blew out a slow breath. “I may be operating outside the law, but I
, but the noose is tightening.
The elevator doors opened - Steve silently cursed the elevator for being so efficient - and Tony broke free of Steve's grasp to rush out. Tony hurried through the common area (Hulk and Thor were too distracted debating over what must have been fifty take-out menus spread on the counter in front of them to notice) and Steve jogged after Tony, confused and more than slightly hurt by the aversion.
Well, Tony supposed, he wouldn’t have carried on with Steve this long if Steve were dumb.
And yet, after several years of working together, Steve would count Iron Man among his closest friends. He was just as comfortable sitting in the belly of the dirigible, waiting to deploy, across from this stony-faced armor, as he would have been with Bucky or any of the other Invaders.
,” JARVIS added.
magazine always portray him as dirty and grizzled. The man that Steve meets today is clean and neat, with an immaculately groomed mustache and dark hair parted so straight it looks like it was done with a ruler. Even casually rumpled in shirt sleeves and trouser braces, he looks much more the business magnate than the hardened adventurer, and Steve has to fight back a wash of momentary disappointment.
“What’s that?”
"It's a really fun game," Steve said. "I might be a little addicted."
universe."
"Absolutely not."
“Clint Barton, used to be part of a goofy gang called the Circus of Crime.” Tony gestured to an image of Hawkeye in a very different, garishly colored, costume. “SHIELD took him in but he escaped custody. Pretty sure the lure of scrubbing his DNA and records from the SHIELD databases would be enough to attract him to a place where we can pick him up.”
"Good. Now where were we?" Tony slid a hand around the back of Steve's neck and tugged him in for a kiss.
Steve laughed softly. "It does make me a little bit less nervous about starting work."
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said. “You hungry?”
Steve sets down his shield, letting it rest against the nearest counter - reminding Tony he
Steve glanced around him, and had to concede the point that, for all the strangeness of a twenty-first century Christmas party spent with people he hardly knew, he had been enjoying himself. "Yeah."
Tony startled awake and spent a moment blinking in sleepy confusion before accepting Clint’s hand up. “I see the answer to ‘are we there yet’ is ‘yes.’”
In other ways, though, Anthony seems softer, almost younger, even though he and Tony are of an age. The earlier death of Howard seems to have something to do with that, though in touching on the big subjects in their game of differences with each other, Tony also learns that the war sparked by the Superhuman Registration Act played out differently in Anthony's world. He and his Steve fought, but they reached a compromise before things went too far. Steve never died, he just received a promotion. Anthony never became Director of SHIELD, never was disgraced by Norman Osborn, and consequently, never lost his memories. The Skrull invasion was over almost before it began, thanks to a united front of superheroes to bring it down.
Steve."
perfectly aware, since it occurred to Tony a moment later that he'd been staring with his mouth hanging open.
Natasha shook her head. "We're not completely sure if they're suspicious of us, or if Stane has just had someone watching Stark all this time."
Tony groaned, but it turned into a laugh as he fell back against the bed again. “Point taken.”
“Junk, maybe?” Bucky asks.
Steve winced as Tony dropped the placard into the wastebasket without ceremony. It landed with a dull thud. "That's it, then?"
Steve could sense Tony was about to follow that up by asking him what was the matter, and Steve was having none of that; he shook his head, sliding his hands down to hook his thumbs in the waistband of Tony's boxer-briefs.
has plans for a uniform station for Steve, down here in his workshop - and steps closer to the pods. The glow of them reflects a distorted green off his face, like he might be on the other side of the glass; the thought doesn't sit well with Tony.
"I love that game," Clint said.
Steve makes coffee, then they all settle together around the workbench Tony and Steve had dinner at earlier, while Stark picks at the food. He still looks pale and a little listless, but much more alert than he had just a few minutes ago.
Surprised by the mixture of bluntness and slyness from Steve, Tony glances at Anthony.
By the time he was on the road, Steve had just enough time to pick up the food order - Tony had texted him the name and address of his preferred place; as it turned out, Tony also placed and paid for the order ahead of time - and make it to Tony's house by the appointed hour.
"Oh, God." Steve furrows his brows. "God, Tony, I'm so sorry."
Steve looked up at Tony, and his expression softened. "I guess so."
"Tony," Steve says. "You wanted to see me?" He stops short as his gaze slides to the left and comes to rest on the group of pods, which have been arranged in a neat row. "Ah. I think I see why."
"That's a little different, then," Anthony says. "In my world, Steve goes by
"The cure to what?" Steve asks. Sternberg slumps, and Steve shakes his shoulder. "Dr. Sternberg? Doctor?"
"Wait!" Steve says, rushing to his side. "What are you doing?"
want to watch, don't you?" he asks Steve.
"We've got our specialist in with him," Peggy says quietly.
"I know," Steve says. "But they weren't kidding about their whole
Tony set down his soldering iron and pushed back from the workbench. “JARVIS, rewind that and give me a closer look at the footage, will you?”
It continued on like that for a while, Tony being convinced to dawdle around a little longer in the suits each time; once or twice, he even donned a suit at Steve's request - "put on the suit" having garnered all new meaning from the first time Steve ever spoke the words to Tony - for the sole purpose of sex.
"Good. You went to college on the east coast, so why settle down in Iowa?"
As the two of them grapple with each other's clothes, Steve's coat and Tony's jacket hitting the floor, followed by shoes and shirts and trousers, to fall naked onto a too small bed in a cramped space, Steve can't help but be transported back to an earlier - easier - time in their lives, and he wonders if Tony is remembering the war right now as well.
Steve groaned. “Yes.”
does Tony know that expression from having worn it enough times on his own face. "Then why don't you come here and join in?"
"Thanks?" Steve said, making it a question. "I think."
By the time he finishes reading it, Tony feels the first trickle of blood from his nose, and is sorry he won't be here to make any of that come true.
"Are you trying to make me nervous?" Tony asked.
That was exactly the problem. Tony silently willed JARVIS, who he knew was listening, to
Steve's warmth at his back was perfect to soothe his many aches, and Tony was just drifting off to sleep when Steve asked, "Ah ... what happened to your closet?"
Barton sat down in the chair across the desk and, at Coulson's warning look, did not put his feet up. "Fine, but ten bucks still says that Uncle Sam blows it."
Anthony tips his head back and smiles up at Tony, slow and seductive around a soft moan that Steve drags out of him, and
“Starving,” Steve admitted. He tugged off his gloves and tucked them into his belt. “You need any help?”
Drinking in excess had always been out of the question for Steve, even before the serum made it irrelevant; alcohol was an expense his necessarily frugal budget hadn't allowed, though Bucky had sometimes shown up with enough Scotch or bourbon left in the bottom of a bottle for them each to have a nightcap.
Steve set aside the card, peeled off his gloves, and stretched out next to Tony. “I know, Tony. For what it’s worth, I’m sorry you felt that pressure. You’re your own hero.”
“Alright, let’s see what we have here.”
Tony made a protesting sound when Steve pulled away, but he didn't argue the reason why, as Steve yanked the ridiculous shirt over his head and tossed it aside. Helping Tony out of his own outfit was a bit more difficult; it was like the Grim Reaper's costume had been poured on, but Steve was happy to peel Tony out of it.
worried that you keep putting yourself between me and dangerous situations."
Tony took the photo and stared at the figures in it: Steve, in a more utilitarian, old fashioned version of his dark uniform, stood next to a dark-haired man in a domino mask, carrying a sniper rifle; another was pointy-eared and wore a haughty expression despite the fact he was nearly naked, and the fourth rounding out the group was holding a ball of fire in his outstretched hand.
"Clones?" Steve asks.
Tony closed the door behind him and walked over to the bed, where Steve had settled onto the edge. "Penny for your thoughts?" he asked.
The trinket was gold gilded, with embellishments in enameled white and blue. The lid was painted with a surprisingly complex scene for such a small surface, and while the extravagance of the style was not Steve’s preference, he had to artistically appreciate the skill that must have gone into painting such a thing.
"So impatient," Steve muttered, but he complied in tugging down Tony's trousers and boxer-briefs, just far enough to expose Tony's ass and free his cock from the confines of fabric.
"Is that why you're still wearing your parachute?" Steve asks.
"Thanks."
"You think you will stall by keeping me talking," he says flatly. "I'm not a fool, Stark."
"The last anyone saw of you in public," Steve said, trying not to laugh, "was in the background of a tourist's photo at an airport in Florida. You were still wearing Mickey Mouse ears."
"I couldn't sleep," Tony said. "Too used to early mornings, I guess."
"Go ahead without me," Steve says. "I'll be along in a second."
Steve shrugged. "I learned about it during the war. I spent a lot of time in that region."
"Go for lunch on your way back, if Reed doesn't keep you too long," Tony suggests. "Steve, you should take Anthony to that sandwich shop you like between here and the Baxter Building."
The Captain raised a hand and pushed back the dark cowl that obscured his features. In the dim light of the penthouse foyer, his face solidified into a full picture, high cheekbones and a straight nose joining the strong jaw and terribly blue eyes. His hair was blond, suiting his fair skin well. “You can call me Steve.”
Steve pushes up onto an elbow and looks between Tony and the heart bubble, before he sets a hand delicately over the glass. His large palm is nearly enough to cover it, to shield it, entirely. "He worked on the armor?"
The house was small and tidy, the doors in the hallway - except for one that Tony figured was probably a closet - all open and offering inviting glances into the rooms beyond. The hallway emptied out into the living room, where Tony found Agent Romanoff - Natasha - sitting on the couch, watching television; it looked like a documentary.
"Stark was grabbed outside the hotel this morning, right before you got back," Agent Drew says grimly. "Hydra has him now."
Iron Man looked up, surprised, like she had forgotten Steve was there. Or, more likely, maybe she wasn’t expecting him to make conversation. Iron Man shivered, obviously cold in her inadequate clothing, and Steve moved even closer under the pretense of getting a better look at the crate, to help shield her from the cold. He would have done it for anyone, really, but he got an idea that Iron Man would not enjoy the thought of being treated any differently now that her secret was known.
"Nevermind, bad joke," Tony said. He carefully pushed himself up to sit, and reached a hand out to rest on Steve's cheek. "Regardless of how I feel about you, Steve, the world would be a lot worse off without you. I know we let them get Hyperion, but we took him down once. We can do it again."
Tony blinked. "How'd you know that?"
"They're here, and they're fine," Tony says. "Still in stasis. We woke you up because your unit was malfunctioning."
“What does it do?” he asked instead.
"Steve," Tony says, with the tired air of a man making an old argument. "Regardless of my reasons for leaving, did you really think it could last? You'd be amazed to know what people are willing to overlook when a war is on ... and what they're not, once it's over."
Even with that taken into consideration, Tony still whined when Steve's fingers slipped free. He had his hands twisted up in the covers, chest heaving like he had just run a mile. Steve used less care in preparing himself, hastily rolling on a condom and slicking the remaining lube over it.
Steve didn’t quite look at Tony like he had turned out to be made of glass, but it was a near thing. “Then it’s even more beautiful,” he said at last. “Because it’s keeping you alive.”

: keeping tabs on them through his satellite network, and coming to their aid when necessary.
The first time Tony Stark goes out on maneuvers with Steve Rogers, he knows that it is truly a match made in heaven. He isn't given to much romantic fancy these days, not with a war on - though he certainly has been guilty of
Steve, Tony realized with a sinking feeling, was too good to understand.
Iron Man groaned and sat up, swatting the bots aside with the wave of a hand. "Ugh. This is the last time I babysit New York while Reed Richards gets to do something fun like go to space," he complained, creaking to his feet.
Tony shook his head a little. "No, it's good. Keep going."
Adaptability was where it was at.

The coffee maker spluttered to a stop, and Coulson handed over the fresh cup to Barton.
. It was sort of hilarious, considering he'd been the one to suggest their probably ill-advised
"That, and curious about your impression of him," Steve says. "It's strange, being in the room with two of you."
Steve clearly can’t contain himself any longer (in addition to Marvels, he loves comic books; the man is a huge fan of the Midnight Rider’s exploits), and after a second more, he bursts out with, “Well? What do you think?”
"Here, you should have this before it gets cold," Steve said, pressing Tony's neglected coffee mug from earlier into his hands. It had already cooled considerably, but was still warm enough to drink.
," he said, moving his grip to Tony's ass and sweeping him up in one smooth movement, "I'm not sure it's a good idea."
Steve is quiet for a beat, his hand roaming down Tony's stomach. "Well," he says at last. "I didn't say
“As long as Iron Man is there to catch me.” Steve smiled, squeezing Tony’s hand. “Come on, let’s get some rest, then we can make a plan.”
"I kind of thought you were messing with me when I asked back at the school," Tony said.
Steve wanted to move close, to hold Tony, to do something to comfort him and make them both feel better after a very long day, but he held himself in place and asked, “What do you mean?”
"Well, hey," Clint said. "It's progress."
Steve squirmed a little, hoping Tony couldn't see his discomfort.
"As long as you don't have a Captain America poster hanging over your bed or something," Steve said, fighting to keep a straight face. "That might be a little weird."
Steve, shivering from the cold - and probably the blood loss - let out a short laugh. "This probably isn't the best time to tell you: I'm not exactly who I said I am."

"I mean, we
complaining about this turn of events. He was a grown man and happened to be great at multi-tasking, and was more than capable of getting himself the rest of the way out of his clothes even while rocking shamelessly into Tony's grip.
"Yeah." Steve glances up from the papers, looking Tony in the eye. "I went to art school, before the war broke out."
“Just ...” Steve said, not wanting to upset the moment but needing to get it out, “next time I have an idea you think is bad or unnecessary,
"Well." Tony shrugged. "You're pretty young, you probably had better things to occupy your time. But when I was a kid, my bu ... uh, my ... babysitter ... used to always put it on around the holidays."
"You would care." Tony rocks his hips, pressing up into the circle of Steve's hand. "They'd have you court martialed."
When Steve arrives back at the Sovereign, the suite is empty and Steve is grateful that he took a key with him on his way out. It looks as if housekeeping has been in and tidied up the place, but a note on the desk bears Tony's scrawl:
Obadiah was another matter entirely. Tony felt worse than he would have imagined possible over that betrayal. Obadiah had always been so encouraging and supportive of Tony's wishes and his happiness; having Obadiah and Jarvis in his life had often provided Tony with a place to turn when friction with his father became too much. Twenty-five years was a long time, though, and surely it didn't take too much of Tony's absence for Obadiah's attitude to sour. Obadiah probably thought he was owed the company after a quarter century of caring for it in Tony's absence; it was the sort of thing that, actually, Tony could have felt - and once did feel - grateful for, if only Obadiah hadn't crossed a line.
," Tony gasped, unsurprised at his own breathlessness. "I really,
What Steve wanted most right now was to brush his teeth - his palate was permanently damaged, he was sure, by the fuzzy coating of sugar from all the cookies, hot cocoa, and apple cider - but his stomach rumbled agreeably at the idea of bacon and eggs.
"Hail Hydra," a very familiar voice says from behind her, and Steve tries not to start in surprise as a hooded figure steps out of the crowd.
, it answered for itself.
“Come here,” Steve urged gently.
"I'll cross that bridge when I get to it."
Tony turns in Steve's arms. "I did miss you."
"Yeah, well." Tony shook his head. "He's a greedy, backstabbing, murdering liar who's spent the last twenty-five years getting rich off my father's name and a bunch of half-assed weapons that he double deals to terrorists. I only wish I'd listened to Fury the first time."
"I'm aware of the Hydra problem in Madripoor, Rogers," Namor goes on. "Little happens there that I don't find out about. They're led by a woman who calls herself
"Not long enough for us to have any fun."
Cap nodded, and glanced around. Half a dozen H.E.R.B.I.E.s had hovered into the room; one, wielding a clipboard, floated up.
Bucky pushes his goggles into his hair and glances between Steve and Tony in a distinctly pointed fashion, a sly look on his face as if he can tell what they were doing without needing to witness it. "
"Tony Carbonell is a fan of our war hero," Coulson said patiently. "I dare say Captain Rogers is his ... type."
"Sorry," Tony added. "I get a little chatty when I've had a few." He held up his beer.
Tony sighs gustily and turns to toss back the rest of his drink. He stubs out his cigarette and, without another word, turns for the door, leaving Steve scrambling to follow.
“So, uh - how does this work, exactly?” Tony asked between kisses. He should have been embarrassed over how breathless he was, how his chest was heaving like he had run a marathon, but he absolutely, somehow, did not care. “Do you, uh - keep the mask on, or ...”
Tony raises his head with a questioning look, and Steve feels himself flush.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Please. I’ve seen what the cosplayers do; I’ll get it 3-D printed.”
"People would talk," Tony says, his voice straining for control as he hardens in Steve's grasp.
Tony offered a lopsided smile. “I don’t know, I thought I was a pretty okay villain. Okay, maybe more of a vigilante, antihero, Han Solo type.”
“You tell me: what made you save Falcon?” Tony asked, sitting on the edge of the computer console.

long before he became Captain America, so it had been a surprise to him to discover that Tony Edwards was, to some extent,
, not ...
Steve nodded, then he turned concerned, looking up at Tony. There were shadows across his face from the way his splayed fingers blocked the light. “Is it powering your heart?”
Tony didn't seem suspicious, at any rate; he just dumped the rest of the bag onto the table, and the contents settled into a pile of fortune cookies, packets of soy sauce and other condiments.
," Steve says, when the first of Tony's fingers eases into Anthony and adds pressure against Steve's cock. "That is - are we -"
Steve offered him a flat look in response. “Have you ever
Christmas this year."
“I understand why you didn’t tell me, even if I don’t agree,” Steve said. “I’m sorry if I overreacted. It was just ... for a moment there, until Sam figured out what happened, I thought I would never see you again.”
When Tony leaned down and kissed him, Steve tried to respond, but it came out disappointingly halfhearted and Tony pulled back, raising an eyebrow.
“It’ll destroy you,” Steve said quietly.
"Captain," Steve says. "I appreciate your meeting me here."
Steve cleared his throat and closed the door, clearly determined to try again. "I brought you some aspirin."
"It seems like a lot of trouble," Steve said doubtfully. "A lot of resources to expend, just to keep an eye on someone who's already set on staying out of the way."
Steve reminded himself, again, that Clint had been the one to get through to Tony earlier, the one whose conviction had convinced them to stand down.
Steve’s laugh was deep and warm, resonating through his chest and vibrating through Tony’s body where they were pressed together. “Come here, I think I can help you with that.”
Shutting off the shower, Steve steps out and towels off. Just as he opens the door back to the bedroom from the en suite, the sound of crashing glass from the front room reaches his ears.
Tony grinned at him like the cat who ate the canary. “I can.”
Fortunately, Steve rarely seemed to worry about anything of that nature ... or, if he did, he never mentioned it to Tony; Steve was great that way.
Steve, lost somewhere in that ramble between 'pitchfork' and 'whatever,' placed his hands on Tony's waist to steady him, and leaned in for a more enthusiastic kiss than earlier. It was true, he really
"I'm sorry," he stammers. "I shouldn't ... I overstepped my bounds. I'm sorry, Tony."
Dr. Banner looks regretful, but answers, "Yes."
," Steve spits. He doesn't have to work hard to summon the vitriol to his voice.
By the time they made it home to Avengers Tower, Tony had fallen soundly asleep, chin tilted down to rest against the lip of his armor. Steve sighed softly and went to rouse him, but Clint beat him to it, jarring the shoulder of the suit with a punch.
They fell silent then, and with neither of them having gotten much rest the night before - Steve's more a state of pain-related unconsciousness and Tony being awake dealing with SHIELD debriefing and everything else - it wasn't long before they drifted off together.
"Actually," Steve said, as they walked inside. "Could you help me out of this?"
"Oh, God," Steve gasps, fighting the urge to tense up. He takes a deep breath and tries to relax, knowing it will only make things more difficult if he doesn't. It's been a long time, but Steve's body remembers this, and opens to the intrusion after a moment of Tony's careful touch.
"You don't approve of my humble abode?"
Namor scoffs. "I owed Stark a debt, much as I owe one to you. I agreed to transport him to Madripoor, but I didn't ask questions. I wouldn't be surprised if he has since run afoul of these Hydra operatives."
Steve put his head down on the windowsill and wondered - certainly not for the first time, and probably not for the last - exactly what he was getting himself into.
“Powerless?” Hawkeye sputtered.
"Did he actually tell you any of that?" Steve wondered.
Tony paused. “Too weird?”
"SHIELD is only paramilitary," Steve answers, his lips curving in a smile against Tony's skin as he leans in for another kiss. He loves arguing with Tony, especially when he can make Tony lose his train of thought.
Steve blinked.
It was help Tony most certainly did not need, and probably should not have invited.
Tony laughs softly when Steve's socked foot actually teases at the inside of his ankle. "You're in a good mood," he says.
“I’m counting on her desire to take down Hyperion outweighing her need to avoid other villains,” Tony said. “And that she’ll be worried about Thor and Hulk botching the job, so she’ll try to steal it first.”
“Sounds good,” Steve said. His stomach rumbled loudly, prompting him to add, “And smells good.”
“You’ve changed a lot, Tony,” Steve said. When Tony began to tense under his hand, he added, “And I mean that in a good way. When we put the team back together, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But you’ve really stepped up. Now ... it really doesn’t feel like a team so much as a family.”
"I'll see you when you get home this evening," Steve said cheerfully, on his way to the door. He paused with his hand on the doorknob and looked back over his shoulder with a smile. "And Tony? I'll help you out of the suit."
Steve nods, still frowning.
"I want to watch you, at least for now," Tony says, tossing the lube in Steve's direction.
“Have you ever killed anyone?” Steve asked, squeezing the hand that he still held. “Endangered civilians? Carelessly caused collateral property damage?”
"Well, whatever it was," Tony says, "you've got excellent taste in movies, Captain. Damn downer of an ending, though."
Steve squeezed Tony's hip in response, a curt reminder not to get distracted. Tony obliged, rocking his hips forward until he was fucking Steve's mouth, losing himself in the friction and the hot wet slide as beneath him, Steve's big, beautiful cock continued to thrust rhythmically into the tight grip of his own large fist.
Steve got to his feet, gathering the dishes, and Tony bustled around the kitchen while Steve did the washing up, putting things away and wiping down the counters. Steve wouldn’t have imagined, when they got the team back together all those months ago, that they might end up here. It was bizarrely domestic, and undeniably comfortable, even if Steve was washing dishes in his uniform.
"Uh," Steve said. "Pretty weird, I guess? Sorry, I don't really know Mr. Coulson that well yet."
Natasha shrugged. "At least he actually missed that one."
Steve tugged off his gloves and tossed them onto the coffee table, then he was returning the favor, fumbling at the buckle of Tony’s belt like an excited teenager. Tony’s zipper went down, followed by the rip of cloth and an apologetic, embarrassed “sorry” from Steve.
Steve sighed. “Believing that the ends justify the means -”
"Don't worry," Tony said when he pulled away. He glanced toward the window, which was nearly whited out by the snow outside. "I think I've got another day or two to come up with a game plan."
, Steve thought, holding the thought fast in his mind — stumbled from the ship while Thor retrieved the Hulk and brought him back to solid ground.
"It's not like we're obligated to do anything," Steve said, as he walked over to sit on the edge of the bed, a companionable distance away.
Steve hurriedly tugs on his socks and shoes, and gets to his feet, tucking in his shirt. "Is Tony in immediate danger?" he asks.
Someone else had apparently decided that what they needed couldn’t wait, however, as the cabin was filled with a trilling noise, like the ringing of a phone.
Tony lifts his faceplate and leans in to give Steve a kiss, once he's sure all prying eyes have moved on or are otherwise suitably distracted. "Go," he says. "I'll mop up here and be on standby if you need me."
,” JARVIS said dryly.
Steve refused to rise to the bait. “Tony, your decisions could have had consequences for the entire team. And not just the Avengers, but the Guardians and the people of that planet, too.”
“Without looking like a handout,” Steve added. “I like it.”
"You got me," Tony said, rocking forward into Steve's grasp with a quiet groan. "That was definitely worth the time and effort."
"I can't make any promises," Tony says, a warning note in his voice.
were based on true events, if sometimes embellished for entertainment value (or toned down to avoid compromising information).
Tony has seen shock before, but never this close and personal, unless he was the one experiencing it.
"How are you feeling?" she asked.
“And I’ll tuck you into bed,” Steve countered as they headed toward the en suite - a quick reminder that they could take care of each other.
Steve wasn't sure he could put a name to this thing growing between him and Tony, yet, but it was certainly one facet of the twenty-first century he was looking forward to learning more about. Still, he figured it couldn't hurt to keep surprising Tony, so he made sure to grab his handy-dandy StarkPad on his way back out of his room; even once Steve caught up to this day and age, he didn't see any reason he couldn't keep moving forward.
