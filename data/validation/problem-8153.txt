Clint offered one to DJ, one eyebrow arched.  "Oui?"
He picked up Steve’s bag, and carried it over, offering the strap to Steve.  “Sometimes even the best men need to be reminded to do the right thing.”
He was so close, and so familiar, and despite everything, Steve wanted him so badly that it hurt.  Even he knew better, awkward and fumbling and stupid as he was, he knew better.  This was neither the time, nor the place, too many things unsaid, too much hurt and fear and uncertainty.
“Is it about bartending?” Jessica asked him.
“Sorry, but those are the rules,” he said, as Jarvis collected the pillow and blanket.
Shuri mimicked Nakia’s pose, crossing her legs neatly at her ankles.  “Nakia.”
“Really big jar,” Tony agreed, ruffling his hair.  “Big enough to hold all sorts of things.”  He picked up his jacket, shrugging it into place.  “I’d bet that if you asked nicely, Steve would paint your name on it.”  He paused, looking at the tool rack.  “And really, I should get you your own-”
Tony waited until they were gone, the door shut behind them.  Then he threw back the covers.  Ignoring Jarvis’ disapproving look, he shifted to the edge of the bed, bracing his hands on either side of his hips.  “I need to talk to Rhodey,” he said.  “We’re going to have to contact Hammer.”
“Happy fucking birthday,” Tony agreed.  He paused.  “Get a bow.”
One of his shoulders lifted in a half shrug.  "Magic," he said.  "Some asshole apparently has a hard on for making my life a living hell and turned my bot into a little boy.  We're pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be permanent, but-" He made a face.  "Dummy had other ideas.  So now we've got a kid.  Who's sometimes not a kid."
And then they were rolling away, across the silent grounds.
Steve shrugged.  “Bucky likes her.”
“Excellent,” Jan said, offering her a platter of pastries.  “Take one.  They’re small.”
“Okay!” she said, grinning wide and bright.  “So would you like to buy a pass?  The show floor is closing in just about-” She picked up her phone, squinting down at the face of it.  “Just over an hour.  So I can sell you a one day pass, but it’s really not worth it, and the full pass is only worth it if you’re staying until Monday, but we have a weekend pass that’ll get you in for tonight and tomorrow, so that’s-”
“No,” Tony said.
Tony stared at Clint.  “Tell me she’s wrong.”
“Ask the man to dance, dumbass,” Jessica said from behind the punching bag.  She wound up and landed a blow that threatened to send it crashing off its chain.  She grinned, wide and bright.  “Unless you don't need practice with that.”
“Why?” Val asked as Carol and Jess walked up behind her.
Stark took it from him.  "It's not this one."
“Are we being healthy?” Harris asked her, only mildly curious.   He considered the cups of carrot sticks and yogurt parfaits.
Okoye glanced at Nebula, who shrugged.  “It didn’t take.”
“Sounds like a few girls I know,” Rogers said.  “I knew one who could break your jaw with a single swing.”
“Probably the same place he’s been every night since he broke that lock; having his run of the grounds.  Maybe he saw the fire, or maybe he was out there before the fire started.  Either way, he wasn’t here when our intruder walked in.”  Steve sank down to the edge of the bed.  “Here’s what I think happened,” he said, his arms braced on his knees.  “One of the hired guards was approached with an offer.  Probably through a third party, probably someone he already knew, someone he trusted.  Perhaps someone he’d done some odd jobs for before.  Maybe legal, probably not.
“Go home.”
Strange clamped a hand over his mouth, words muffled behind his fingers, words that Steve were pretty sure he wouldn’t have understood even without that barrier.  Finally, Strange let his hand fall.  He took a deep breath.  “You will do exactly as you are told,” he said.  “As long as you are here, a stranger in a strange land, as long as I am responsible for your well-being, then you will do what you are told.”
Jan raised her hand, prim and proper as a school girl.  After a beat of silence, Steve nodded at her.  She gave him a bright grin.  "So, now that we've agreed that we're united in our desire to stonewall people we don't like-”
"Huh."  Tony stroked his fingers over his goatee, his eyes narrowing in consideration.  "I could've sworn you had shoes.  Very nice new shoes."  DJ shook his head, and Tony nodded, his hands braced on his hips.  "Well, we'll just have to get you some, then."
Steve's dog tags shifted across his skin, the wedding ring gleaming in the cool light of the arc reactor, and Steve was suddenly so achingly aroused that he was dizzy with it.
“Well, be nice, and you can have some sliced fruit and a boiled egg, too,” Tony said.
“You’re not fat, and even if you were, it wouldn’t change how I felt about you,” Steve said, as if Tony hadn’t said a word.  “Health wise, I am a bit concerned about your cholesterol levels, because your eating habits are kind of terrifying and-”
Peter braced his hands on his knees, his shoulders rising and falling with the force of his breathing.  "I'm TRYING," he said, his voice tinged with insult.
Jarvis made a considering sound under his breath.  “You may have as many eggs as you’d like,” he said, reaching out to smooth DJ’s hair away from his face.  Tony watched them, his chest aching, the memory of that touch so strong that he could nearly feel it against his own skin.  Jarvis flicked a finger against the tip of DJ’s nose, making him laugh again.  “Do not accept the castoffs from any other plates.  Manners above all, young sir.”
“This is the sixth,” the blonde said.  He sounded very tired. “I’m getting really sick of weird looks from cabbies, honestly.”
Across the counter, Rhodey nodded back.  “Too soft,” he said, taking another bite.  “Overcooked?”
“I'm an idea man,” Tony said, waving the tongs in her general direction.  “Full  of ideas.  I leave the execution to other people.”  Pepper's eyes narrowed at him, and he pasted a bright smile on his face.  “Brilliant, organized people.  Who I value very highly.”
“I'm working on it,” Bucky said.  He scowled at nothing in particular.  “I'm pretty sure he knows we're dating.  I just don't know if he thinks Misty's dating both of us, too.”
"Release the hounds," he said, and Steve was right beside him, almost shoulder to shoulder, as they stepped through the doors and out into the plaza.
“Steve?” Sam's voice echoed out from the penthouse, and Steve was very grateful for the interruption.
“They're now mixed up with our lunch trash,” she said.  “Go pack something else.”
“How many books do you have?” Tony asked, setting it down on the table.  Under that was 'Stranger Than We Can Imagine: Making Sense of the Twentieth Century.'  He grinned.  Harder than it should've been, probably.
“Oh, Deej.”  Steve hugged him tight.  “He’s right here.  Promise.”  DJ nodded against Steve’s chest, and Steve smiled down at him.  “Want me to wake him?”
“Perhaps-”
But it wasn't like Tony's sleek and modern midtown penthouse, or his warm and cozy Queens house.  It wasn't much, and caught himself wondering what Tony would think of his worn, paint stained wood floors and his framed mass market posters.
Marjorie was a short, round woman with a halo of blue curls that almost exactly matched the flowers on her pale yellow dress.  Steve wondered if she changed her hair with her clothes, or if she matched her clothes to her hair.  Either seemed equally likely.  She pushed a pair of orange cats eye glasses up her nose, frowning down at her tablet.  "Barathea?"
“I guess you can call that a benefit,” Bucky said, but he was smiling, as much as he did, anymore.
Maps.  Maps.  Panel rooms and video rooms and autograph rooms and hallways and vendor space and artist alley.  Harris’ eyes snapped across the page, looking for-
Tony sighed. “Would you like a book?”
“It is not a cat,” Agatha said, as the cat shaped creature curled around the back of her neck and peered around the far side of her head, its eyes glinting, blood red for an instant, then fading back to orange.  “It is a being of ancient power, one that has lived since before the rise of human civilization.  One that has seen not just the collapse of governments and countries, but entire religions and magical disciplines.”
“I never kid,” Coulson said at the same time that Clint said, “He’s never kidding.”
Isaiah stomped across the room, his cane thumping against the floor with every step.  “I subscribe to Stark’s YouTube channel.”  He snatched the hanger out of Steve’s hand and shoved it against his chest.   “Rang the little bell for notifications and everything.”
Tony nodded, his chin bumping against Steve’s shoulder.  “Get Thor.”
“The same person who did your last three tattoos,” Rhodey said.
Tony gave a laugh, and it felt like a sob.  “Cursed to be a bachelor, I suppose.”
“No, he's right, he abdicated the couch, I win,” Bucky mumbled into the cushions.  He was now flopped out, face down, along the full length of the couch, one leg trailing to the floor, the other propped on the far armrest.  “Want my socks back.”
Seek’s stealth capabilities had kicked in already, and he pushed himself back, hsi legs aching as he tried to maneuver himself under a nearby table.  It wasn’t perfect, but at least no one would trip over him.  Legs flashed by, right in his line of sight, and he frowned.
Harris took it.  His hand was unnaturally warm, but somehow, not uncomfortable to touch.  “His Stephen Strange, I take it.”
“Apparently so, because here you are.”  Tony waved a hand at DJ and Rogers.  “The small goblin has not attempted to smuggle any of my tools out of the workshop today, and thus, should be rewarded.”
Tony grinned around the tines of his fork.  “I was eight.”
Steve's free hand swept up and down the plane of Tony's stomach, his touch familiar and comforting, slipping beneath the fabric of his shirt to settle against Tony's skin.
Or any of the rest of it, really.  The constant conversation or the disapproving looks or the snarky comments or the way that Steve had managed to integrate himself into every single element of Tonyy’s life in a surprisingly short amount of time.  He didn’t miss the way that Steve checked the locks on the doors and the windows, hovering, fussing, with that worried look, as if he actually cared if something happened to-
Natasha pushed the door open.  “Rhodey's back, so dinner will be served in twenty minutes.”  The cat wandered past her, and her head swung in a slow arc, watching it with a bemused expression.  “What is this?”
“Yes.”  She looked at Franklin, who shrugged, his shoulders twitching up.  She heaved a sigh, and turned back to DJ.  “DJ?  Do...  Do you want to talk about it?”
“And now he was,” Tony finished from behind him.
She glanced at Maria.  “I'm honestly surprised the Avengers doing have their own PR team.”
Bucky considered him, one eyebrow arched.  "'S a shame," he said, licking some bright green guacamole off of his thumb.  "I haven't slept in, like, seventy hours, and I've got an hour 'til my next pickup."  He balanced the burrito on one palm, holding it aloft like a holy relic.  "So.  Not really feeling much sympathy for you."
"You have a hard life," Pepper said.  Behind his back, she mouthed 'Lemonade?' at Jarvis.  He gave her a slight nod before slipping back into the house.  Pepper turned her attention back to the paperwork Tony had given her.  "What's this?"
“Oh, God,” Rhodey said, his head falling back.
“It’s not-” Steve looked at the watch, at Tony’s fingers as he removed the case, the movements deft and precise.  The case was bent, the cheap metal having given way at some point.  “I doubt it’s worth fixing.  It didn’t cost much to begin with.”
“You absolutely do.”  Tony rocked forward in his chair, folding his arms on the edge of the desk.  “You’ve got that ‘so pleased about my socialist child’ grin on your face.”
“I'll find you a bottle of 'No More Tears,'” Rhodey said.  “Do not sneak out without talking to Steve.”
Tony braced a hand on the table.  “I blame you,” he said, propping his other hand on his hip.  “I'm charming.  You just-” He waved in Steve's general direction.  “Loom.”
“Yeah, well, we know that NOW,” Tony said, pinching the bridge of his nose.  His head was throbbing, despite a cup of coffee that threatened to melt both the cup and his molars, or maybe because of it.  He risked another sip.  He'd prefer to die caffeinated.  “Surprise.”
“You think that we have the board support?” Pepper said to Marcy.
“Don't worry!  I got this!” Down below them, the older man was already stomping his way across the apartment floor, his cane thumping hard on the wood floor with every step.
Tony looked up at Dummy’s charging station.  He wasn’t overly surprised to find it empty.  “Dummy!”
“Seven thirty,” Jarvis said, and Tony groaned again, even more heartfelt this time.  “Indeed, sir.”
“Is he actually okay?” Steve asked Carol.  “Hello, by the way.”
“Very funny,” Harris said, but he was smiling as he piled pancakes onto his plate.  “So we have, what?  Costumes representing different facets of your personality?”
Jarvis looked at Tony, who busied himself with signing whatever paperwork had been left on his desk, whether they needed a signature or not.  Jarvis looked back at Peter.  “You are, of course, the soul of discretion,” he said dryly.  “But perhaps you should go downstairs and assist your aunt in setting the table for dinner.”
She waved him off.  “I’ll get you both a cup of coffee.  Just…”  Her eyes slid towards Steve.  “No mopping, you hear?”
"Shouldn't you be upstairs, sir?" Natasha asked, pouring the coffee with a neat twist of her wrist.  She held the cup out to him.  "In the dining room?"
Steve nodded.  ‘Thank you.  For talking to me.”
Steve liked it anyway.
Tony blinked, his head falling forward. “What?”  Steve was silent, and Tony took a deep breath.  “The serum-”
“But we’re going to have to deal with the fallout,” Natasha said.  Her head turned, just far enough for her to meet Clint’s eye.  “And there is going to be fallout.”
The boy was eating with the quick, almost desperate movements of someone who’d been hungry for a long time.  His eyes came up, catching Steve’s, and he made a deliberate effort to slow down, chewing carefully.  Steve gave him a smile.  “I’m Steve,” he said.
“That I am.” Nicholas gestured at the table.  “Please.  Have a seat.” When Steve opened his mouth to object, the king pointed at the seat.  “Captain.  Sit.”
“Shouldn’t have put on the music,” Pepper said, her voice breezy.  “It reminded me I needed a break.”
“Absolutely not,” Jan said from between gritted teeth.
“Is…  Is this on the clock?” he asked at last.
“Put.  It.  Back.”
“Everyone else puts too much butter on it and not enough cinnamon,” Tony said to Pepper.
“More important, you think there’s even a chance that you’re in danger, drop the phone and run for it,” Steve said.  “Understand?”
“Boys!” Mrs. Parker headed down the stairs, shaking her head.  “If you’re done playing, you have a job to do.  Can we please focus?”
Ellen leaned forward over her keyboard, pulling up her email with a couple of keystrokes.  "Not yet," she said.
“Maybe don't go to jail?” Natasha suggested.  Her hands were still on her weapon, her fingers just ghosting over the gleaming surface of the metal.  She looked up, and her eyes were locked on Gyrich, not Clint.  “Have you considered maybe not going to jail?”
“Yes, sir, Mr. Jarvis.”  Mickey took the envelope, and picked up his cap from the sideboard.  “I will, sir.”
Tony glanced up to find a young woman hovering in the door to the back room, tall and gangly, wearing a heavy canvas apron over her plain dark shirt and pants.  A white handkerchief pulled her dark curls away from her face, and a pair of wire rimmed glasses, very similar to her father's, were perched on her nose.  Tony held up the ring.  "Yours?"  he asked.  She nodded, a flush spreading across her cheeks.  Tony smiled.  "You've got a real feel for metal work."
Tony's shoulders twitched in something like a shrug.  “For being like this,” he said, and Steve's chest ached.
DJ smiled at him.  “Love you.”  Shutting the car door, he slipped through the front gate and jogged up the path.  The massive round window, several stories above him, caught the late afternoon sunlight, and he squinted up at it.  Some days, he could swear he could see its pattern changing every time he blinked  Today, though, it was still, gleaming silver-white against the stone background.
Fury smiled, just a little, a twitch of his mouth.  “You keep doing just what you're doing.  When they send these things out into the city-”
Steve stared at him, blindsided by the question.  His heart was pounding in his chest, his pulse spiking in an instant.  But there was no threat in the boy's eyes, no rage, no accusation.  Just...  Something like desperation.
Stark gave her a suspicious look.  "Fine?"
Tony gave him a lopsided smile.  “I think you have your own problems,” he said, his voice arch.  “Besides.  What’s the point of a grand PR gesture if I’m not seen being properly affectionate?”
DJ nodded.  "Know," he said, around a mouthful of paper.  "Know!"
There was a beat of silence.  “This is the best day of my LIFE,” Franklin Richards said, his voice shaking with the force of that sentiment.
Tony dragged his feet up, giving Bucky access to the cushions.  “Get a knife.”
DJ beamed up at him.  “Welcome,” he said, letting Bruce take his basket from him.
“Darcy,” Harris said, pushing himself to his feet as the door opened.
“Right.  Don't...  What?”
He took the bottle from Tony, and this time, Tony let him.  “Or he’d be back to handle me.”
Because if Steve wasn’t with him, Tony was going back out himself.
The voice was half amused, half scolding, and the man at the counter grunted, flapping a hand through the air without even looking up from his work.  The curtain that closed the front of the shop off from the back twitched aside, and a young man leaned out.  “We’re open.  What do you need?”
Jan blinked up at him, her finger still hovering over the doorbell, as if she was going to ring it a second time in under 60 seconds.  Right behind her, Tony was standing, his arms crossed over his chest
He turned it over in his hands, studying the stenciled words on the front.  Project: Rebirth.  He wasn’t sure why, but the words made him uneasy.  He took a deep breath, and held it out to Pepper. “Put it downstairs.”
“Yes,” Jesse said.
Steve held up the white plastic bag in his hand.  “Then I guess I've gotta eat this all myself.”
“He will be your spy in the court,” Shuri said.  “I, meanwhile, will be a street urchin, gaining low information in the markets and back alleys.”
“At the pool party, that was a little odd,” Sam said, and almost against his will, Steve laughed.  “But here, a sweater is weather appropriate.  Put on a nice sweater and a pair of chinos.  I’ve got a spare Santa hat that I can lend you, but I expect you to give it back.”
Jessica Drew (Referred to as Jess here)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Woman_(Jessica_Drew)
DJ looked down at the carpet.  The tea hadn’t left a mark.  He picked up his tea cup.  “They were trying to protect me,” he said, very carefully.  “Protect everyone.  Made a mistake.”  He set the cup back down.  “We-  All do that.”
Jarvis blinked at him, his eyebrows arching.  "Ah.  Am I, sir?"
Steve gave a short, hard laugh.  “As it turns out, he was right.”
“I mean, yes, but also we come with more super villains than the average Kardashian party,” she said, her voice wry.  “So there’s good points and bad points, honestly.”  She reached for her three ring binder, flipping through the pages.  She was wearing earrings shaped like strings of Christmas lights.  They glittered every time she moved, catching the light with each turn of her head.  “But if Bunnie doesn't-”
He plodded forward, trying to ignore the exhaustion that tugged at him.  “That…  Might’ve been too much,” he mumbled, and his tongue felt heavy in his mouth.  He shook his head, trying to get his blood back where it belonged.  He didn’t want to stay here.  He didn’t want to spend any time here, that he didn’t have to spend.  He took another step, and the world seemed to tip sideways.  Tony sucked in a breath.  “That…  Was too much.”
“Why?” Harris asked, and Tony groaned.  Harris flapped a hand in his direction.  “You were going to ask, you were just going to do it when I wasn’t around.”
“Why do you hate me so much much?” Jan said, her voice rising to a dramatic pitch.  She slumped forward, resting her forehead on Steve's breastbone, half of his wardrobe pinned between them.  “Why?”
Jarvis nodded.  “Then will you send him back?” he said, his voice soft.  “For however long it takes you to buy an orphanage?  Will you-”
“Mr. Stane,” Steve said.  His eyes darted from Tony to Obie and back, but he followed May out of the room.
He stood up.  “I know I seem harsh.  I know, the world seems so unfair, sometimes.  But when I inherited your father’s estate, even though no mention was made of you in his will, even though no provision was made for you, I knew you would be part of our family, and I would do anything I could to keep you safe.
Because, as Pepper liked to remind him, he was far more sentimental than he'd like to admit.
Franklin watched her go, his hands braced on the ground on either side of his hips.  “She just wants to help,” he said to DJ.
Tony held his pose for another second before cracking.  "No, I didn't," he said, reaching for the menu.  "I found a busboy who was smoking behind the dumpster and paid him an obscene amount of money to swipe me a vest and tie."  He flipped to the back, his eyes narrowing at the entree listing.  "It was good enough to get me through the kitchen."
“Also you involved Thor,” Rogers pointed out.
She glanced back at him.  “Feel free to stop by anytime, Officer.  You sure do improve the scenery.”
He could hear his mother talking, high and amused, and he risked peeking through his fingers.  Clint was grinning at him, his eyes dancing.  “Yeah, and Phil was pointing out, it’s still valid, it’s-”  He nodded.  “Not that we’re even talking about that, mind, but-”
A long moment of silence, then a slow, careful nod.   Tony smiled at him.  “All right.”  He took a deep breath.  “Did you want to see a movie?”
“Are you giving him your breakfast?” Natasha filled a serving bowl with the potatoes, fried crisp and dusted with salt and pepper.  She set it on the counter, and Stark pushed it in front of Peter.  “Miss Potts'll be upset if you don't eat something.”
One of Thor's eyebrows arched.  “I don't suppose she's single?” he asked.
“Or two, have a frank discussion as to why he hasn't invited you over,” Bucky said.
“You and your father, and the carbs,” he said.  He pointed up the hallway.  “Go.”
It shouldn't matter.  But it did.
Shuri made a gesture like a tree toppling.  “You will never know what hit you,” she said.  She headed for the inn, for the front door, where Bucky and Sam were both waiting, with various levels of patience.
“Yeah, kinda nice, isn’t it?” Carol asked, the words muffled by the fork tucked between her teeth.
“Hey!” Peter repeated.
“Did you consider, you know, giving me a word of warning?” Sam asked, the bouquet raised over his head like a club.
He slid two fried eggs onto a plate, holding it out without  even glancing over his shoulder.  Natasha took it from him on her way past, adding two pieces of toast to it and sliding it over to Bruce.  “Doc.”
“Book club?” Tony asked Okoye.
DJ shifted his backpack up on his shoulder.  “Thank you,” he said.  He smiled, and Rogers reached out, his hand resting lightly on DJ’s back.  DJ looked up at him, then to his father, and then back at the rest of them. “I’m not sorry.  That I came back.”
Tony put his cup down, and picked it back up again, his fingers twitching on the handle.  “Excuse me?”
There was a beat of silence, and then Pepper shifted, leaning up against his side, her head tucked against his shoulder.  “Do you want out?” she asked, her voice quiet, and the thought was so shattering that for a long moment, he couldn't think, couldn't speak, couldn't breathe.
“Lost it a long time ago,” Steve said, and Tony's hand tightened on his, his fingers firm and familiar.  “Move it.  I've got your back.”
Steve grinned at her.  “Maybe for you.”
“Money.”  Trip gave a slow nod. “Well, okay, that’s-”
Harris looked helplessly at Strange, and then at Tony and Fury.  Tony took a step forward.  “You’re going home,” he said, in a voice of such confidence that Harris found himself nodding.  “We got you home last time.  Didn’t we?”  He looked at DJ, his eyebrows arching.  “We got you home.  And we’ve got more help now than we did then.”  He looked at the portal, looked at Strange.  “Together.  We’ll get you home.”
“You don’t have to.” Nicholas slipped the hat on and adjusted it, pulling the brim low over his face.  “I remember you.  When push comes to shove, you will always do what’s right.  No matter what it costs you.”  He headed for the door, and paused, halfway there.  “And for that, Prince Steven, I am well and truly sorry.”
Jarvis paused.  "I do not believe that's the intent of-"
“No, I'm quite certain I'd remember if there were any other failures in my long and distinguished career, it'll just be you in a giant marble building, we'll throw some neo-classical columns up, arches, portcullises, that kind of shit, it'll be very, very impressive, and then it'll just be you sitting on a little marble podium and-”
Steve's shoulders tightened, his back snapping straight in an instant.  Across the hallway, the Captain leaned out of the door of his office.  He pointed a finger in Steve's direction.  “Rogers.  In here.  Now.”
“You'd never know he had, like, six sketchbooks of naked pictures of-”
"I can imagine."  Steve shifted in his seat, still terrified that this tiny, fragile chair wasn't going to hold his weight.  "Tony.  There was two guys out there.  Two, at most."
Steve blinked.  “No, they didn't,” he said, because of course they didn't.  They couldn't.  He wouldn't have done that.
The pen slashed across the page, and Duck leaned forward, the lenses of his glasses catching the light and going flat and white for a moment.  “Ning.”
“Ready?” Peter asked, almost bouncing in place.
“Sir!” A man in a slightly old-fashioned black suit came hurrying across the garage floor, his aristocratic, fine boned face holding just a trace of panic.  “Have you seen-”
“Somehow, I’m not surprised.” Strange shook his head.  “This way.  Sit down before you fall down.”
Harris  rubbed his thumb against the cat’s ear. “Yes, it does.”
“I’m just looking for a quick comment about the YouTube video you uploaded last night.”
Tony shifted, his face twisting in sleep, and without thinking, Steve reached over, stroking a hand over his hair.  Tony relaxed, his lips parting in a soft, almost inaudible sigh.
Sam cupped a hand over his mouth, which did absolutely nothing to hide his smile.  “Cap.  I'm shocked,” he said.
Tony glanced back as Darcy came pushing through the crowd, and he craned his head, looking behind her, annoyed that DJ wasn’t right with her.  “It’s fine!  For once in your life, can you not overreact?”
“Can’t imagine what you mean, Mr. Stark,” Steve said, wide eyed and with a great deal of mock confusion.  Behind him, DJ darted past, hopping gleefully along the hallway runner.  Steve smiled, and he just looked crazed. “Everything seems perfectly normal from what I know of this household.”
She sighed, her shoulders slumping.  “Himself,” she said, and Steve nodded.  She opened one eye, giving him a look.  “You know, I believe I prefer Okoye.  At least her scolding is honest.”
“And he'll discover a little more room when it's time for dessert,” May said.  She craned her neck, looking towards Steve's plate.  “Did you get enough, dear?”
Steve shrugged, fishing through the cartons until he found the one he wanted.  “Pepper seemed a bit worried when you pulled a disappearing act after the meeting.  I think she expected you to come back after you blew off a little steam.”
“Right,” Tony said, and walked down the hallway and back to the main hotel lobby.  He gave the sign sitting on a crooked easel a suspicious look as he passed by.  The hotel lobby had the sort of shabby desperation of a property that had once been a much fancier establishment, but at least there were people here.
“We need clearance for that,” Tony started, and Steve didn’t even look in his direction.
“In all likelihood, yes,” Marcy said. She paused. “Please tell me that you'll be interfering.”
The drawers were locked, too, and Steve braced a hand on the top, giving it a hard yank.  The lock snapped and the drawer came loose of the cabinet, files slamming against each other as the drawer hit the floor.  A quick glance was all it took to determine that DJ’s file was missing.  He looked up to where Happy was standing, hand braced on the wall.
Tony pulled a face.  “Well, when you put it like that, it just sounds tawdry.”  He punched the elevator button and leaned back against the wall, grateful for the moment of rest, no matter how fleeting.   “Sorry, Jay.  I haven't-”  He scraped a hand over his face.  “I haven't been sleeping particularly well.”
Tony nearly went over the top of the counter at him.  Steve, as if realizing this, clamped a firm hand down on his shoulder, pinning him in place.  "We needed to make an emergency landing," he said, sounding entirely too calm for Tony's peace of mind.  "Our jet's currently being repaired by an approved crew, as soon as we're able to take off, we'll be out of your hair, sir."
“Yes,” Rhodey said, his voice flat.  While Tony was still staggering under of the weight of that betrayal, he turned his attention to Pepper.  “I'm guessing that if we're discussing Tony's love life, that means we found him?”
Morrison looked out at the cameras, his smile so tight that it looked like it could crack at any moment. “And we'll be right back after these messages, stick around for a discussion of the historical context of our discussion.”
“Know what?  I'm going to lock the front door,” Steve said.  “Just in case.”
“Perhaps I can start taking classes on my own,” Tony said, dragging his spoon through his porridge.  “Be easier for me to help him if I was at University with him.”
Isaiah clutched at his chest.  “This is the way you talk to an old man?” he asked, and Eli was trying not to laugh, a hand clamped over his mouth as his grandfather staggered, his face shocked.  “I'm trying to make nice with your boy, and this is how you-”
“On several levels,” Pepper said.  Tony gave her a look, and she reached for her bag.  “Now.  If you’ll excuse me.  I need to go downstairs.”
“That, I fear, happened before I was born,” T’Challa said.  “Phillips set you up.  As guard and guardian.  As the keeper of the peace.  And now, in all likelihood, you will be king.  The king your country needs, desperately.”
"She's an idiot," Tony said.
“I did not bother to try,” she said, as Shuri set the package down and unwrapped it, pushing the cloth aside.  Beneath the folds, a familiar red, white, and blue curve of metal appeared.
“Well, I expected that would be your opening,” Tony said. He spread his hands. “Tony had a tongue, and he sure knew how to use it.”
"Also, way back in the day, horse theft," O'Brien said, his teeth flashing around the stub of his cigar.  "This whole rant of yours got a point, Rogers?"
T’Challa smiled.  “Because you are, as always, a wise man.”
"Probably not."  But Tony paused at the base of the stairs, letting Obie pull him in for a back-thumping hug.  "Seriously.  What are you doing-"
“That wasn’t pain,” Tony said, his voice a bit raw, and Steve flushed again, a wave of pink sweeping up his neck and across his cheeks.  Tony, unable to resist, leaned in, brushing a gentle kiss against Steve’s soft lips.  Steve, to his credit, kissed him back, his mouth parting under Tony’s, a soft sigh shuddering through him.
“But you sure do attract them,” she said, shaking her head.  “Like locusts, I swear.”
Steve kissed him again, hard and fast.  “Stay here.  Stay safe.”
“Can you grab me an iced tea, too?” Harris asked, digging for his wallet.
She blinked.  “Right.”  She didn't sound certain, but she said it, and then, again, “Right.”
“Oh my God,” Luke said.  He took the box from Steve. There was a pantleg trailing out of it.
“And when he’s angry, he forgets that.” Pepper gave the machine a nervous look.  Her voice dropped.  “Any progress?”
Tony’s head tipped to the side as he thought that over.  “It’s a very nice suit,” he said with a grin.  And it was.  It was a classic cut, nothing too modern or flashy, but a with nice, clean lines and an elegant weight.  Paired with a crisp silk shirt and a red and gold tie that just brushed up against the edge of garish, it suited Harris in a way that Tony was pretty sure Harris wouldn’t like.
"About Franklin, yeah."  Clint shifted on the couch, kicking his legs out in front of him.  "It's going to be okay.  You know that, right?  His family isn't going to let anything happen to him."
“Goats,” Shuri agreed.  “But my brother finds one of the guards, and asks him, what has happened.  Why has the stranger not left?  And we are told, ‘he wants to repay his debt.’”
Darcy reached out, grabbing the end of the tape and ripping it free.  Clint flinched.  “Was that really necessary?” he asked as Darcy handed the tape and the shoulder bell to the girl.
Steve tried to swallow, but his mouth was so dry it hurt.  He took a breath, and another, trying to find words that didn't involve begging.  Or crying.  His skin felt like it was on fire, a prickly, desperate heat.  He crossed his arms over his chest, anything to keep his hands to himself. “It is morning.”  He was pleased.  That sounded almost normal.  He sucked in another breath.  “So let's just-”
"What are you-" Steve rocked back in his chair.  Tony, laughing, straightened up.  He was wearing a black vest over a white shirt, a napkin draped over his arm, and a crisp bow tie.  "What are you wearing?" Steve managed.
Steve found himself smiling back.  "Well enough, my lord.  You?"
Sam nodded.. “Good evening,” he responded, his voice quiet.  He bowed, his back straight and his shoulders squared.  “Your Majesty.”
Steve gave the man a look.  “And I'm sure she'd love to find out that you're trying to set her up with a random man you don't even know,” he said, and Tony struggled to keep a straight face.  Disapproving Cap was his favorite Cap, provided, of course, that that disapproval was aimed in someone else's direction.
Marcy ignored that.  "You need to let us do this," she said.
“Why not?” he asked.  Jan gave him a look, and dropped his copies of the caterers’ menus onto the table.  “No.  Seriously.  Why not?
“Hey, don't dis punching things,” Jessica said, her eyes narrowed at the punching bag.  “Punching things is great.”
“Well, at least he was dressed?” Rhodey said, and Tony considered hanging up.
Steve nodded.  “Yes.”
Namor had outdone himself, and probably depleted a good portion of the North Atlantic Garbage Patch at the same time.
Ellen wadded up a pillow behind her.  “How'd that go?”
“Wanna get married?” Tony asked Rhodey.
“Ah, yes, sports rivalries,” Tony said.  “I do so enjoy those.”  He wandered back towards the kitchen door, and Jan stepped in front of him.  His eyes flicked up towards her.  “Ah.  You’re the one behind this most recent kidnapping attempt.”
"Good try there, with the lying.  That was a good, solid, college try," Tony said.  "Why are you wearing glasses?"
Making deals with disembodied voices was not a good idea.  DJ knew this.  Things that couldn’t be seen couldn’t be trusted, and the voice was wrong.  It was…
Tony grinned at him, his eyes dancing.  "We're a good match, then."  He made to step around Steve, towards the door, and Steve caught his elbow.  Tony blinked at him.
Steve lifted one hand off the bed, flexing his fingers.  It took more effort than it should've, but everything moved as it should, with only a dull ache as the skin and muscles moved.  He nodded, and let it fall back down at his side.  “I think I'm okay.”
“It's a pirate movie,” Steve pointed out.  “Don't you think it should be rum?”
"That I wasn't blinded by his pure beauty?" Steve said.
“No.” The single word was flat.  Unequivocal.
“Though knowing our esteemed employer, it was presented less as an offer and more as a foregone conclusion.”  Jarvis pinched the bridge of his nose.  “A delicate negotiation even when such things aren’t complicated by other…”  His mouth went tight.  “Entanglements.”
“Wow,” Greer said.
“Maguire,” Steve said, not sure if he should stay or go.  He glanced at Tony, who didn’t even glance in his direction.  “News from Captain O’Brien?”
Rhodes laughed.  ‘Yeah, last time I passed it, it seemed like it needed a lot more than a ‘little’ work.”  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “And while Sam’s got his good points, he’s not known for his masonry skills.”
“That...  Sounds worse than what happened,” Tony said.  He peered up at Steve.  “I'm sensing history.”
“Most of them don’t have any idea if they’ll be fed tonight, so it-”
“Right,” Harris said.  He gave the cat another cautious scritch between its shoulder blades and it hunkered down again, paws flexing on the arm of the couch.  DJ tried not to look at its claws.   “So…  You sent him the money to finish his game.”
DJ nodded.  A storm raged in the movie, and he resisted the urge to cover his ears.  “Do you have bad dreams?”
“Very sure,” Tony said, his voice cold.  “Where did you drop DJ?”
"Thank you." Rogers shifted forward, bracing his forearms on his knees. "All right. Ellen." His head tipped to the side, a bare flicker of movement, his eyes sharp. "You clearly believe that. So..." He straightened up. "Why did you write it, then? If you're so opposed to that particular story being told-"
“Hi,” Steve said, and her eyes came up to meet his.  Her moth dropped open as Steve took off his ball cap.  “I hear you’ll be marrying us today.”
“Well, that’s foolish of me.” A painting shifted on the wall, and without a beat of pause, Clea turned, hurling the book directly at it with the force of a major league pitcher.  The book went right through the wall, taking the painting with it.  Clea looked at the resulting hole, her head tipped to the side.  “As was that.”
A sharp rap on the door was all the warning they got before it opened, and Director Fury leaned in. “Hey there, Starks,” he said, a hand braced on the doorframe.  “How’re we doing?”
“Where everyone will be,” DJ said.  His fingers dug into the hem of his shirt, tracing over each of the stitches, one by one.  Resisting the urge to count.  “Yes.”
For a long, weighty moment, he was silent.  Then, “What happens if it stops working?” he whispered.
Steve took a seat at the table, finding the seam of the paper and sliding a finger under the colorful paper.  He worked the tape loose, pushing the paper back with deliberate motions.  Sam set a cup of coffee down next to him.  “Maybe you should start on your presents now,” Sam said, taking a seat across the table from him.  His fingers cradled the cup, huddling into the warmth for a moment before taking a sip.  “If it takes you this long, we’ll still be waiting for you to be done on New Year’s Day.”
“Doc?” Clint asked.  “You still with us?”
"You're like NINE," Franklin said.
-Previously, A few universes over-
Tony took a deep breath.  “Do you know what a diagnostic is?”
He thought about that.  “Jazz?” he asked at last.
“Oh, definitely,” Tony said, his voice bright.  “What would be the point in dying?  Things have just started getting interesting.”
“I might be getting Sam flowers,” Greer said, stressing the word 'might.'  "It's a working suggestion.  That's all."
Tony’s head jerked back up, and DJ was visible again, DJ was coming back down, back towards them, the spec in his vision getting bigger and bigger but the glow was gone, the pale blue of the repulsors wiped free, and it wasn’t the invisibility, because something, he could see SOMETHING-
Bobbi smiled.  “Doesn’t it always?”  She paused beside a plant bed, crouching down to run her fingers over the leaves, turning them over, checking them for something.  “As it turns out, once they had my father on the payroll, they found other things for a talented chemist to make.  Worse things.”  She went still, gently stroking a leaf between her finger and thumb.  “Things that he made, because now they had his wife and his teenage daughter living right under their control.  Things he could swallow his pride, to keep his family safe.”
"No," Tony said, as DJ put the lid back on the jar.
“Yes, sir?”
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “That's not a 'type,'” he said, trying to sound stern.  “That's having sense.”
Franklin snorted, and rolled over to lay on his back, his head tipped up towards the movie.  “Uncle Johnny says he doesn't.”
Greer whipped her shirt off, tossing it towards a locker, and leaving her clad in her shorts and a sports bra.  “Ready,” she said, pounding her fist into the palm of her other hand.
“I’m not-” Tony choked on a laugh.  “Jesus.  Calm down.”  He cupped Steve’s face between his palms, and leaned in for a kiss.  “I’m fine.  I promise, I’m fine.”
Steve patted him on the back.  “Not at all.”
"Where's your gift registry?"
“It was.  By Lewis Carroll.”  Isaiah shoved the coffee machine into the trash can.
DJ considered that question.  “I am afraid of that small space,” he said at last, each word careful.  “It's...  Specific.”
“Good,” Steve said.  He took a deep breath and let it out.  “I appreciate that.”
His face a dangerous shade of red, he managed to make his head move, and May held the pressure for another second before she stepped back, leaving him gasping desperately for air.  May swung the bat back and forth, time ticking away with each arc.  “Where is DJ?” she asked.
“And that is your problem, not mine,” Clint said, ducking as she aimed a punch at his shoulder. “You didn’t ask for a long term plan, it’s-”
“Hold back on the perimeter,” Coulson said, his voice calm over the comm line, and Tony banked hard to the right.  “Falcon's keeping an eye on the Hulk, and the mechanism is out of commission.  SHEILD scientific is clearing the scene.”
"It's not-"  Tony's head fell forward.  "It's 'The Pirate Movie,' a bad eighties movie that builds off of 'The Pirates of Penzance,' Steve," he said, resigned to everything.  He slumped very low in his seat, staring at the screen from between his fingers.  “It's...  It's not good.”
DJ’s head moved, the tiniest bit, a no.
He jolted, his hand going to his hip, grabbing for the gun that wasn’t there.  Mentally cursing himself, he spun on his heel, turning just in time to see
“Fifteen,” DJ said.  “Or maybe sixteen, it’s…  It’s confusing.”
“Never, it’s StarkIndustries policy not to give into the demands of terrorists,” Tony started, and Steve hit him with the pillow.  This time, Tony was ready, and he grabbed hold of it, wrenching it free of Steve’s grip and swinging back in his direction.  Laughing, Steve ducked out of reach, sliding off the edge of the bed.  Tony flopped onto his side.  “You’re lucky,” he said, his voice muffled by the sheets, “that I’m naked.”
Yeah, Tony's tattoo shop is run by three bald ladies from Spaaaaaaaaace. 8)
“Yes, don't take it personally, darling,” Jan said, waving her fork.  “Obie doesn't think any of us should be here.  The table's full of women who've sullied themselves by engaging in trade, social climbing men dating above their station, and children.”  She paused.  “And a cat.”
Tony gave his head a brisk shake, trying to get some blood back into it.  “Watch and learn,” he said, and if his voice sounded husky and a bit raw on the edges, well, he could chalk that up to the late hour and the sheer amount of coffee he'd drunk.  But his hands were steady as he started making adjustments, his fingers flying over the mechanism, putting things to right with a speed that impressed even him.
“Well, a giant robot is trying to kill me, and I'm in a HOLE,” she said, and there was an edge of hysteria to that.  Not that Clint blamed her.
Carol made a rude noise under her breath as she tossed what used to be a very expensive piece of beachfront real estate off of the dock.  “Nice to know that Thor managed to physically wrestle him into the quinjet, you mean.” she said, dusting off her hands.
“Yeah.”  Jesse pulled her phone out of the pocket of her cargo shorts.  “''Statutory Surprise in Symkaria,'” she read aloud.  She gave Ellen a look.  “Really, you had to go for the alliteration?”
Her thumb rubbed against the side of the knife handle.  “And we agreed.  The night watch, it was dangerous.  We both knew that.  But Ben was a careful man, a reliable man, and he wanted to be able to provide for us, so Peter could attend school..”  Her thumb stilled, and her fingers tightened on the knife, her knuckles going white.  “So many boys in the neighborhood were in the factories by the age of eleven or twelve, and we were determined, that would not happen to Peter.  It would not.”
He pulled one leg up, bracing his elbow on his knee. “My mother was from Italy, and that’s, well, it’s a long way away.  She came from a very old, very aristocratic family.  Lots of land.  Lots of history.  Not much-”  He held up one hand, rubbing his thumb against his fingertips.  “Not much money.”
“Portmanteau,” Tony explained, rubbing his forehead.  “When the public or press smashes two names together.  Like, you know, Bennifer.”
Tony glanced up.  Rogers was still standing in front of the car, his hisp braced against the hood, his head one a perpetual swivel.  There was a painful tension to his shoulders, and Tony considered putting the driver’s seat into full recline.  Staring at the ceiling was probably healthier than watching the muscles of Rogers’ shoulders bunch under the fabric of his t-shirt.
"In my defense, it was her idea," Clint said, catching the eggs, one after another, and setting them aside.  He shifted the rashers of bacon on the pan and cracked the first egg into the sizzling grease.
DJ grinned.  “Love me?”
And Tony hated that.
“I'm seriously questioning this relationship right now,” Tony said.
She slanted a look in his direction.  “That you don't want to handle,” she said, her voice silken.  “And now here were are.  With a house guest for a week.”
Darcy nodded.  “So, you can’t, like, it’s not possible, or you won’t, because you don’t want to bother?”
“I bought you your own, you mooch,” Tony said.
Somewhere above them, something dropped to the floor with a solid thunk, and Steve looked up.  Footsteps creaked across the ceiling, and Steve turned his attention back to DJ.  "I'm never home, in any case, and you deserve better."  He stood, unbuttoning his pants.  Once he was down to his under shirt, shorts and socks, he pushed the blankets back on the bed and crawled in.  "We're going to find you some real parents.  Right?"
He gave the door a perfunctory rap with is knuckles before shoving it open.  “Banner.  Rise and shine.  I gave you a bed. In a room named for it.  And yet you persist in sleeping on a nasty ass couch that I think you collected off of a curb sometime in the mid-nineties, did you do this specifically to make me insane?  I don’t mean to sound egotistical, but I think you do this to make me insane, there’s really no other-”
There was a beat of stillness, as the man stared at him from behind the smudged lenses of his glasses.  Tony could almost see the instant where the situation sank in, and then the clerk scrambled for the back of the counter.
Steve froze, his heart stuttering to a stop. When it started up again, it was going double time, his head spinning. “Tony?”
“She definitely looked like she was considering taking the butt of that pistol to the back of his head, I’m not going to lie,” Clint said, giving the pan a shake.  “And Rhodes just looked resigned.  Like he’d been here before, and he knew where it was going to end, and he didn’t like it, but he was sick of fighting it.”
DJ took a deep breath, and another, and raised his hand.
Steve froze, his lips still pursed around the silly straw.  He gave a slight cough.  “So.” He squeezed his eyes shut.  “I...  Might've taken advantage of the situation.”
Tony opened his mouth, and she held up a finger in front of his face, a very clear warning sign.  Tony took a step back.  “Well, he kissed me first, that should count for something, and besides-”
“Ah.  Well.  We’re your parents, Deej, but that doesn’t mean we’re always going to agree about what’s best for you.  We both want you to be healthy, and happy and safe.  And both of us are willing to take on the other if we think you’re not getting something you need.”
“Agent, I'd watch your-”
Rogers blinked at her. "Excuse me?"
Jane, her hands held by Thor and the woman who'd been measuring him, skipped in an uneven, off kilter circle.  “Sure, you do!” she said, her face flushed.
Steve shouldn't have doubted Jarvis.
“Inu,” Tony said, pointing his knife at the card.  “That, I know.”
“Ouch,” Carol said again, snapping him out of his thoughts.
“Ah.”  Harris nodded.  The creature’s head bumped against Agatha’s ear, and her head tipped to the side, as if she was listening.  Harris’ fingers twitched on the tablecloth.  He cleared his throat.  “I don’t suppose the ancient one enjoys scritches?”
DJ rolled over, putting his back to Steve, his final word on the matter.  Shaking his head, Steve sat down on the edge of his bed, bending down to pull his shoes off.  The stove'd keep things warm until the coal burned itself out, and he was too tired to deal with anything else.
“Of Christmas Yet to Come.  We’ll talk tomorrow.”
“I mean, it is,” Bucky said, and Sam kicked him in the ankle.
Tony gave Steve a sympathetic look, but since Steve was sitting with his head buried in his hands, he probably missed it.  Amused, Tony went back to playing with his phone and waiting for this to be over.
“He can’t do it, Steve,” Sam said, dumping a healthy amount of mapo tofu onto his rice.  He waved the serving spoon in Tony’s direction.  “All talk, no action.”
Just like Tony.
“Do they not get along?” Steve asked.
“Take this,” Pepper said, putting both of her hands on Steve’s back and pushing him in May’s direction.  “I’ve bigger problems to deal with.”
His head jerked up, and she was smiling at him now, amused.  Or not.  Her eyes were sharp as steel, the light catching her teeth as she took the tiniest bite of a cookie, and set the rest back on her plate.  She left no crumbs.  She chewed, slow and careful, and reached for her tea cup.  “Clever.  But not clever enough.” Her silver spoon tapped the side of her cup, once, twice, three times.  It made no noise.
Tony's smile was luminous.  "Liar," he whispered, and it carried no sting.  "But I love that about you."  He leaned back in his chair.  "And you deserve one nice meal, one nice date."  He reached for the water glass.  "So you're going to get one." He held it up, a toast.  "Merry Christmas."
He reached for his pen.  “And now I’m going to do the same thing.”  He pulled the contracts across the desk to his blotter.  “If they show up now?  Pay them.  And make sure that they understand this is not the first payment of many.  This is the final offer.  They are to take it, and they are to go away.  If they come back with their hands out again?”  The tip of his pen carved a signature against the pages, one after another.  Ink bled through the fiber of the paper, each stroke a wound.  “I can promise you, they won’t like what they find.”
Harris reached out, patting her on the knee.  “Darce?”  She leaned in.  Harris smiled at her.  “NOPE.”
The girl’s eyes were darting between them now, huge behind the round lenses of her glasses.  “Are…  I’m so sorry for your loss?” she managed when they both swung around to look at her.  She hugged her clipboard tight, her shoulders hunching.  “My parents are alive but kind of, you know, we’re not close, she doesn’t like my girlfriend, or the fact that I have a girlfriend, or me, but, you know, they are still alive, and sometimes I don’t know what to do about that, because-”
“I like to think of us as living distraction,” Clint said as Bobbi stepped up beside him.  Her hair was tucked up under a flat cap, a heavy pair of canvas gloves hanging from the waist of her overalls.  Her clothing was dirty, but her boots were scrupulously clean.
“Because you said you didn’t want to be part of the yelling out here,” Tony said.  “And he flails unless he’s got someone to hold his hand.”
“You do realize this is an open commline, don't you?” Tony said, and Clint decided that maybe living in the hole for the rest of his life was a pretty good idea.
“Okay, you're fine, we're fine, I'll-”
"You're a scrapper, aren't you?  I mean, you shouldn't get involved, you're just a kid, but-"
“Been told as much by everyone from my Ma through to my Captain in slightly less polite terms,” Steve said. “Stubborn as a hungry hog half a foot from the trough is how my Ma phrased it.”
In the center of the mats, Thor was waiting, Jane hovering just next to him.  “Friends!” he boomed, his face splitting in a grin.  “We have come for your lessons!”
“I’ll call,” DJ said.  He gave Steve a hopeful smile.  “Bike?”
“She is moving South along the edge of the street,” Jarvis said, and the spot came to life on the HUD, a tiny spark shooting through the chaos.
Janet Van Dyne  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp_(comics)
Hitomi's number was in his phone, and he took a moment to thank God for whenever Tony had given that to him as he hit the dial button.  She picked up on the second ring.  “Hello?”
Fury stopped, eyebrow arching.  “Huh.  Nothing much good starts with a Cabal, but if you’ve got intel, I’l take it.”
“I got arrested, caught up in a raid,” Bobbi said.  She smiled, her lips kicking up on one side in a wry twist, and spread her hands out.  “Wearing clothes like this.  The arresting officers didn’t do a lot of investigation, they had much bigger fish to fry, but sooner or later, someone would’ve figured out that I wasn’t the sort of man that they thought I was.”
“So, breakfast?” Tony asked, as Clint gave him a cup of cocoa.
“Both of you,” he said.  He pushed away from the door, and walked over to the bed.
After all, the old stories all had two endings: either the hero escaped the court of the Old Ones and returned to a world that was colder, and darker, but far more real, or they lost themself to the fantasy, to the lie, disappearing into the shadows far, far below the hill, a cautionary tale whispered to travelers and children.  Don’t go too far, don’t go to deep, or you will be never find your way back out.
One of Bucky’s shoulders rose and fell in a half-shrug, drawing his worn coat tight.  “Downhill,” he said.  “Where water usually settles.”
"It's an 'I will have you murdered,'" Tony said, because he was very close and very wet and very, very hot, "which I think implies a certain level of-"
Steve doffed his cap, tucking it under his arm.  “Good day, Mr. Jarvis.  I have the report on last night's incident.” He shifted his weight.  “Miss Potts requested it?”
Steve's heart was pounding in his ears.  “That's not-”  He stopped.  “I can't.”
“Uh, I don’t know what you’ve heard,” Steve said, picking his words carefully, “but that’s not really…  That’s not part of my skillset.”
“That’s all you have to say?  ‘All right?’” Tony asked.
“No,” Okoye said, her voice taking on a firm edge, but it was too late.  With a sharp cry, Shuri touched her horse’s sides with her heels, barely a brush of her boots, but the mare lunged forward like she’d been shot out of a cannon.
He let his voice trail away, taking a bite of the still too-hot pizza, and Steve picked up where he left off.  "And assigned every file a randomly generated four digit number," he said.  He grinned.  "Now you and I are going to choose the numbers, two each."
“Do you think anyone in this household is here because he is paying us?” Jarvis asked.  “Do you think I am?”  His index finger tapped against his other hand, and Steve blinked, recognizing the movement from another set of hands.  “I am…  What you might consider independently wealthy, myself.  I’ve served this household for a long time.  If I’d wanted to retire, if I’d wanted to leave, I could’ve done that years ago.  Decades.
"Morning, Jan," Steve said, unconcerned.  He half turned to face her.  "Come on out, it's great."
Shuri flopped into her lap, and laughing, Nakia flicked the tip of her nose.  Shuri grinned up at her.  “Please marry my brother.”
The words startled him out of his reverie, and Steve shook his head.  “What?”
The old man looked at Tony, and Tony was pretty sure he could see eternity in the depths of his eyes, in the dark shadows behind his glasses.  The world spun on its axis, and he wasn't sure if it was the exhaustion or the alcohol or the situation itself, but he heard himself say “I do,” the voice echoing as if from a great distance.
“You're not the first to think so,” Steve said, and she burst out laughing.  He smiled.  “And I doubt you'll be the last, ma'am.”
“I’m going home,” DJ said, his voice soft.  “I’m getting help.  But I’m going home.”
“It's all right, Jarvis, we've got him.”  Stark came striding back, a stepstool swinging from one hand.  He gave the flustered man an amused look.  “Losing your touch?”
“Do you need a ride?” Steve asked, popping the cookie into his mouth and reaching for another.
“And look intimidating,” Jan said, smiling down at her paperwork.  “Reed, Hank’s hiding down in the lounge, probably playing a game of solitaire of his own design, I’d appreciate it if you’d go distract him for a bit.”
Not what he wanted.  But more.
Steve’s face relaxed into a smile.  “By ‘kitchen staff,’ do you mean Natasha and Clint, or Jarvis and Mrs. Parker?”
“Someone had to be the cavalry,” Bobbi said, unconcerned.  “And I didn't get fired, so apparently I made the right choice.”
“The child isn’t an orphan,” he said, and Tony stood.  Obie looked up at him, his brow furrowing.  “Tony?”
Steve gave her a tight smile.  “Think I’ve had my fill of that.”
“Okay.  I get that.”  Clint shoved a hand through his hair, then pulled his shirt on.  “What's going on, Jarvis?  Is he all right?”
Clint let out a snort.  “Oh, I'm going to end up in jail, Nat.  It's cute that you think I won't.”
Trip leaned back in her chair, ignoring the way it creaked.  “Baby, this is Vegas.  Everyone takes cash.”
Steve nodded.  “Tonight,” he said, the words barely audible.  “Who know he was going to be there?”  Happy was silent, and Steve’s eyes flicked towards him.  “It wasn’t in the papers.  It wasn’t publicized.  Who knew he was going to be there?”
“I have not,” Strange said.  He didn’t sound convinced.  “So when did I order pizza?  Tomorrow, or yesterday?”
“This is inappropriate,” Jarvis told her, filling a napkin lined basket with fresh, steaming popovers.
There was a beat of silence.  "He attempted to access the workshop,” Jarvis said.  “Not long after you disappeared.  In retrospect, I would surmise that he was after technology and information that you had chosen to keep private."
“You're out of your mind,” Sam told him.  “Out of your ever loving mind, Cap.”
“But you made it easier,” Harris said.  “A lot easier.”
Peter’s lips twitched.  “She did.  I got out.”
Tony made a face.  “I fired the chef last night,” he said.  “I fired everyone last night.”  He raised an arm, pointing in the general direction of Jarvis' voice.  “I'm fairly certain I fired you last night.”
Tony nodded.  “I’ll talk to Jane.  See if we can’t put the band back together.”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said, his voice calm.  “And yet, I shall be serving you a full meal.  I trust you to make the correct choice when presented with it.”
“Of course, sir.”
Sam sighed, hitching his gym bag higher on his shoulder.  “Man, it's not like you got him drunk and tattooed your name on his ass.”  He stopped, his hand catching Steve's elbow and dragging him to a halt as well.  “You gave him something.  He made the choice to wear it.  You did not pressure him, harass him or threaten him to make him wear it.  You aren't checking on him, to make sure he's wearing it.  You're not turning it into a way to control him, or force him to do anything he isn't inclined to do.”
“By way of Las Vegas,” Steve said.
Steve never stirred, he just let out another small, light snore, his fingers curled against his cheek.
“It’s become clear to me that I’ve been far too lenient in allowing you to skip meals,” Jarvis said, heading for the door of the dining room.  “I’ll speak to chef about a full breakfast for you today.”
Steve jolted, his head swinging around.  Rhodey was floating at the edge of the pool, his arms braced on the tile.  He smiled at Steve. “Tony keeps a wide variety of swimming costumes, just for guests, bet you can find one that fits you.”
So...
“He does like to gossip.” She dropped the bottle and reached for another.  Tony watched her, amused.  “Do you have any idea how much that bottle cost?” he asked as she emptied it.
“I can’t imagine what you’re referring to,” Steve said as Okoye came riding up next to them.  “I’ve told you not to listen to Sam.” She snorted under her breath and Steve shifted in his saddle, trying to resettle his weight.  “The man can’t be trusted.”
“It is very hard,” his father agreed.  “Will you explain it to me?”
Her index finger tapped an uneven rhythm against the desktop.  “You're really going to sit on this?”
“Are you surrendering?” Steve repeated.  “Because there’s no way you can win, not with what he’s left you.”
“It's a date,” Pepper said, brushing a kiss on Jan's cheek.  “Do not cancel on us again.”
Steve’s lips twitched.  “Oh, this is all a PR move?”
"Thank you," she said.  Then, "Or, you're welcome?  It's-  It's nothing?"  She looked helplessly at Jane, who was draped in half a dozen bolts of jewel toned cloth.  "Help me?"
She took it.  “Marry me.”
Supporting Steve's weight as best he could, Tony lowered him back down, until Steve's head settled in his lap.  For an instant, Steve was tense, his face pinched and tight.  Then, he let out a breath, and the strain seemed to go with it.  Tony smiled down at him. “There you go,” he said, and Steve's eyelashes fluttered.  “Better?”
"Breathe."
“You do that,” Aimsbridge said, giving them a little wave with one hand. “And I expect to be the one to interview you on your first anniversary.”
Steve’s eyes rolled up towards the ceiling.  “He’s not cheating on me, Bucky.”
"They're the 'good enough for Christmas parties with children, but too good for sports parties with Clint,'" Tony said.  Steve emerged from the fridge with a bowl of salad in one hand and a carton of refrigerated tortellini in the other.  He gave Tony a look.  "Do you know how many things got broken last Super Bowl?" Tony asked him.
“Steve?”
“I’m having a day,” Harris told her.
Miss Potts studied him.  “You,” she said at last, her lips curling in a smile, “are going to be trouble.”
Pepper considered him, her mouth a flat line.  “I don’t believe you.”
“Get off of me, get OFF OF ME,” Tony yelled, and Bruce's hands were locked on his shirt, his weight pinning Tony to the floor.
“Looking for crimes?” Natasha said, one shoulder rising and falling in a shrug.  She hopped up, one hip braced on the top of the wall, her legs crossed at the ankles.  “I mean, there's no shortage of those around.”
“I’d appreciate that,” Phil said.  “I have a lot of paperwork to finish before dinner.”
“Some drunk,” someone called, and Steve’s teeth locked.  The last thing he needed was a civilian getting in the middle of this.  And yet, it would seem that was exactly what he was about to get.  “What should we-”
His eyes closed.  “You’re a chef,” he said, his voice aching.  “You.  Are a chef.  Fucking ACT like it.  Put thought into every menu item.  If the only people leaving your restaurant happy are the ones who can and will adhere to your personal tastes?”
“Promise,” Steve said.
Steve flinched, and Tony wondered if he could get through this without putting his foot in his mouth again. “But I'm nobody's idea of a good long term bet, and the longer we-”
DJ blinked up at him.  “He already ate some,” he said, his tone apologetic.
“I’m not sure I’m prepared for that,” Steve said, kissing the side of Tony’s neck.
Ellen ignored him. "I outed you," she said. “And that's not something that should be forgiven.”
Laughing, Pepper offered her a forkful of pastry and cream.  “Flatterer.”
It took a few tries, but finally the flames were licking across the surface of the wood, and Tony settled down on the carpet before he reached for another log.
Steve nodded.  “Do the voices.”
Tony’s stomach turned over.  He took a deep breath, forcing it back into place.  “Steve loves you,” he said, because he knew that was true.  That much, he knew.  “So no matter what, I’m sure he’ll come see you, as often as possible.”
“Well, it is the season for miracles,” Sam said.  He paused.  “Want me to come over and be your fashion consultant?”
“Reasonably sure,” Tony said.
“For God’s sake, why?” Rhodey asked, and Tony pointed in his direction.
“She's been no help,” Jan said, waving a hand in Natasha's direction.
He stared at the schematic, rage sweeping over him like a wave, gone almost as soon as it hit.  And leaving him exhausted and swaying on his feet.  “Fuck you, Obie.  Fuck you.”
Steve set his coffee cup down before he spilled it.  Or snapped the handle off.  “Yeah,” he agreed.  “That.”
“Steven.”
“Just the ride share guy,” Darcy said, her voice breezy. “I didn’t want to leave my car at your place, and for some reason, your building doesn’t show up on GPS.”
"Yeah, I'm weird like that."  Steve wandered forward, his hands tucked in his pockets, his body canted forward, relaxed and easy.  But there was a threat in each step, a hard, vicious intent.  "So what you're really getting at is this idea that bisexual people are predisposed to cheat, which seems to be built on the idea that they just have more choices in people to cheat with?"  He paused, his head tipped to the side.  "Which seems a sad way to think about it."  He leaned in, smooth and controlled.  "Don't you think?"
“Flatterer.”  Dancing past him, Pepper ran her fingers along the line of his jaw, going on tiptoe to brush a kiss against his lips.  “Seriously.  I should be finishing the invoicing, so if you could just do me one tiny favor...”
“Yes, dad,” Darcy sing-songed, and DJ, sitting in the middle, hid a smile behind his hands.
“You are expelled from the Council of Lesbians,” Greer told Carol.  “You are out.  Done.”
They’d been slowed, just before a bridge crossing, by a herd of sheep, milling in and around the riverbanks.  Okoye, Bucky, Sam and Steve had plunged in, dragging panicked ewes back to the flock while Shuri had sat on the bridge, tossing pebbles to keep them out of deep water.  The shepherd, a shy, brawny girl of no more than fifteen or sixteen, had offered her a gift of soft, yielding cheese in thanks.
“Oh.  Is it Thursday?”  Clea leaned out of a doorway on the third floor.  “Hello, intern.”
“Sam likes a train wreck as much as the next man, that’s why he’s on this team,” Greer said with a grin.  “If he had self-preservation skills, he would not be here.”
He slammed his way out of their apartment, stalking down the hallway towards the elevator.  “I know I'm probably the dumbest person you have to deal with on a daily basis here, Jarvis, but can you please cut me some slack?”  The doors were open and waiting, and he ducked inside.
“Iriomote-yamaneko,” Steve said, yawning.  He wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, leaning into his back, his chin resting on Tony’s shoulder.  “Ohayōgozaimasu, DJ-kun.”
“I wanted to send a video, but the throwback here seems to think that he’ll find the printed word more comforting,” Tony said, and he wasn’t sure if Steve was right about that or not.  But it had saved him from the humiliation of struggling to find something to say to the unblinking eye of a camera.  Steve had volunteered, and he’d let him, because he was at the end of his rope.
“Issat so?” Happy ran a hand over his mouth and jaw.  Steve was pretty sure he was hiding a grin.  “I wouldn’t know.  I barely speak English.”   Before Steve could say something he’d probably regret later, Happy kept going.  “Woulda thought you’d approve, anyway.  We took both him and DJ straight home, figured the boss’d be safest there.”
“Bless me, boyo, what's all this then?” he asked, trying and failing to push himself up.  “You’re…  Don’t tell me.”  He stabbed the cigar in Steve’s direction.  “I know a good Irish boy from Limerick when I see one, you know Kelly?  Kelly, down at the Green Clover?  Pours a mean pint, he takes care of-”
Tony just looked at him, his eyes narrowed.  “See, if I give you any time to plan, you’re a very good liar, Officer.  If you have time to strategize, you’re absolutely impenetrable.”  His lips twitched.  “But if I can manage to catch you off guard, you are…”  Tony shook his head.  “Let’s just say, you can’t bluff your way out of a wet paper bag.”
“Information no one needed,” Pepper told him, trying her best to keep a straight face.  “So.  It would appear you’re not the only one making a spectacle of himself.”
“In general, or because of this specific mess?” Clint asked.  He raised his arm so the medic could finish patching him up.  “Because I've always known that I'm going to end up in jail eventually, Commander.  So really, the fact that I'd be facing a federal judge telling 'em that the reason that I was there was because I kept a government asset from killing a teenager?”
He let out a breath that he hadn’t even realized he’d been holding.  “Thank you,” he said, the words coming without thought, without effort.  “Is Pepper up in the office?”
“Right, you’re right, definitely yes,” Tony said, taking the cup of coffee out of Obie’s hand and draining it in one long gulp.  “It’s brilliant.”
DJ gave the stairs a suspicious look.  “Is the house-”  He looked up, watching the ceiling flex.  “Okay?”
“And I'm here to save you from this nightmare fuel,” Pepper said.  “An hour.  Two.  Tops.  I just need you to put in an appearance, Tony, it's good-”
He stopped in the doorway, a little surprised to see that Sam and Tony had claimed one of the couches on the far side of the room.  It wasn’t like there was any sort of seating arrangement, but he almost always sat with Tony.
"One time?  One time, my fine ass."  He raised his hands as if in prayer.  "Please.  One day.  One day without you running face first into something trying to kill you, or starting a public pissing match with injustice, or trying to-"
“Where is she?” he said, scanning the street desperately.  “Jay, find her.”
“You put it there, now you want it gone?” Steve asked, but he let Tony push his shoulders down, his head sliding under the water.  It closed over his face, and he exhaled, bubbles slipping from his lips.  It was warm and quiet and he reached up, tugging Tony down to him.
Happy chuckled, his broad face relaxing. “Yeah, the gardener.” The car shot forward, merging into traffic. “Before the boss hired him, though, he did go to medical school.”  He tapped a finger on the side of his jaw.  “He fixed me up, couple of months ago, and now?  You can barely see the scar.”
“It's okay, I explained, he knows you're sick, and I told him you'd talk to him tonight for sure,” Steve said.  He went down the stairs first, hands braced on the wall and the railing.  Tony fell into step behind him, ignoring his wobbly knees.
“Passes,” Tony repeated, and she nodded.
Obie’s shoulders relaxed.  “Good.  At least you’re showing sense, there’s-”
“Right, they’re going to get expelled by Security,” Steve said, pushing himself to his feet.  “I’ll just-”
“A sentiment shared by all sane men,” Obie said, chuckling.  He lifted the stopper on the whiskey decanter, swirling the liquor in the depths of the bottle before reaching for a tumbler and pouring it with a heavy hand.  He picked up the glass, and without setting down the bottle, he took a quick swallow, then turned his attention to his aspirin tablets.
Halfway to the doors, something caught his attention out of the corner of his eye.  His head swung around catching the glimpse of an elderly lady with a crown of white hair perched on one of the couches that were scattered around the lobby.  She was wearing a black pant suit, the lines clean and austere.  Her hands, folded in her lap, looked skeletal against the fabric, and her head swung slowly, her dark eyes tracking Tony as he moved across the lobby.
“Who wants to bet he used to draw a government paycheck at some point?” Clint asked, leaning back in his chair.
Steve nodded.  Secrets on top of secrets.  He looked back at the sink.  “If you're sure.”
Confused, Harris looked at DJ, who spun his chair in a circle with a flick of one foot.  “Ah!” he said, the single syllable somehow triumphant.  His head rolled on his neck, tracking Tony as the chair continued to turn.  “You figured it out.”
“Which is another reason why we're fine with comforting you,” Carol said.  She propped her fists on her hips.  “Now.  Who wants to go help clean up and make sure no one went slinking off through the back alleys?”
He looked back at the fountain, familiar and foreign, all at once, and felt more sure of what he was about to say than just about anything he’d ever said in his life.  “You can stay, if you want.”
Captain O'Brien didn't look up from his paperwork.  "Bolsheviks."
"Hrumph," Jarvis said, giving Steve a sharp look.  Steve struggled against a smile.  "It will do.  For tonight."
“I can ask your aunt if I can get you a dog,” Tony amended instantly, winning himself a pleased nod.  “Better?” he asked her.
Jarvis scooped DJ up, balancing him on his hip.  “Were you scared?” he asked.
But Tony was likely already asleep, and even if he wasn’t, there was no chance that Steve was going to go looking for him.  He reached for his doorknob, sparing one last glance over his shoulder.  He wasn’t surprised to find that he was still alone.
DJ nodded.  “Yes.”
“What?” Harris called back.
“I mean, I am,” Clint said, balancing the unicorn on his head as he dug through the shirts.  “But I live with a bunch of people who are in varying stages of a nervous breakdown.”
“So I left that world, I left that position, and I left a lot of things behind.  I don't regret it, I kept what mattered.  A purpose, Bucky, my sense of self.  I got the truck, I got-” He waved a hand around.  “I got this place.  But for a lot of people, what I did was a comedown, or an insult to what they'd achieved, and...”
“Yes,” Darcy said, and Harris buried his face in his hands.
“It’s not my cat,” Sam said, and Steve put an arm between them before Bucky could go for his throat.
“That information has nothing to do with you, Stark.  Get your digs in when you want to, but we have oversight, clearance, and control of the scene.  You are the ones who have chosen to interfere with-”
DJ nodded.  “Lot of cookies,” he said.
In the silence that followed his departure,” Carol folded her arms on the table, leaning into them.  “This place is the human equivalent of a swarm of locusts,” she said. “There are no leftovers, Jan.  You could have a delivery scheduled every ten minutes for five hour straight and it just means Thor and Luke Cage don’t have to spend all night going ‘anyone want this last one?’”
He leaned forward.  “Do you understand, Tony?”
“So.  If you’re asking me what he’s thinking?” Rhodey asked.  Steve nodded.  “Then I think he got what he wanted and now he’s wondering how you’ll take it.”  His face relaxed into a grin.  “But I’d also say that since you seem as panicky about it as he is, then it’ll be fine.”
“Yes, sir?”
Pepper gave him a look.  To Steve, she said, "I know it's frustrating to be stuck on the sidelines, but right now?"  She turned her full attention back to Steve.  "The press is in a rather rabid state.  In a few months, you'll be old news."
Steve passed the bowl over, and Tony took it with his left hand.  Steve rubbed his thumb over the ink on the inside of Tony’s left arm.  “Garlic, basil, tomato,” he said, his thumb following the pale drizzle of olive oil that traced the skin around the other images.
“Well.”  She considered that, her eyes narrowed, a finger pressed to her lips.  “I think we'll manage to keep the house.”
“We were hiding,” Tony said, pushing himself to his feet.  “From responsibility.”
He froze, his heart in his throat.  At the sink, Tony straightened up, water dripping down his face and neck, running down his bare chest.  He blinked, his lips parted, his eyelashes dark against his skin.  “Seen- What?” he asked.  He reached up, pushing a hand through his hair and he was all lean, corded muscle and tawny skin, the too-big shorts sliding low on his hips.
Steve glanced at her, and then back out the window, his jaw locked.
His head cleared in an instant, so fast that he was almost dizzy with it.  Steve.  Steve's.  He blinked at the walls, at the bed.  Steve's.
“But Rogers hasn't,” Duck said.  He considered her, his brown eyes sharp.  “Look, I might not be on the same websites you are-”
"Yeah," Ellen said, cutting her off.  "I know."
“Call him off,” Gyrich said, and Steve rubbed a hand over his mouth, trying to hide his smile.
Tony paused, his coffee cup halfway to his mouth.  He stopped.  Held up the cup.  And gestured with all the aplomb of Vanna White turning a vowel.
"Oh, Rogers's a good egg," the boy said, offering Pepper the milk.  "They'll joke with him, make no mistake, Miss, but no one's gonna cross him if he tells 'em no.”  He gave her a bright grin, his freckled nose wrinkling.  “They know better than that.”
Laughing, Tony stroked a hand over his head, playing with his hair.  “How old were you?  When he decked your boyfriend?”
His eyebrows arched.  “And right now, I want to go down there, but I can't, because-”  He gestured at the photographer.  “I have to get my picture taken.   If you can help me with that, maybe you could come down with me?”
"The game does not.  It would like me to buy 'farmbucks' with my real bucks, and let me tell you, it's not happening."  He stabbed at his phone, his face intense, and Steve bit back a laugh.
"They know who you are, even if they didn't know who you are, they know who you are," Tony said, trying to wrestle Steve's glove off and getting absolutely no help from Steve.  "You need to stop assuming everyone needs an introduction, because it's just awkward and it wastes time, and I don't care so much about the first part, but the second part will be the death of me."  He glared down at Steve's hand, still stubbornly encased in leather.  "Do you put these on with super glue?"
“He's stopped kicking me in the shins,” Clint said.  He paused.  “Mostly.”
“There's only one way to find out, sir.”  A pause.  “You have a guest.”
"He's small and wily, it's true," Steve said, half coaxing and half lifting Tony into the seat.  "Sit here until I get things secured."
Nebula’s hand flashed out, the movement so fast that Tony couldn’t even track it, and stabbed the tip of a hunting knife through the page she was drawing on, pinning it firmly to the wood of her desk.  Her head still down, she said, “Knife embedded hilt deep in the wood’s a hell of a lot cheaper, though, itsy-bitsy.”
“Invite people.”  Tony sniffed cautiously at the test tube, then thrust it in Pepper's direction.  “Does this smell like raspberries to you?”
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering if this is what insanity felt like.  “Carol, can you please-”
“I do not think she needs encouragement, but I like to give it, anyway,” Nakia said, sliding out of the saddle in a lithe, easy movement.  Behind her, the men did the same, with less grace and a lot more grumbling.  She flicked her wrist, wrapping her horse’s reins around one hand in a practiced gesture, and looked at Shuri.  “Shall we negotiate, my favorite royal?”
Greer nodded.  “So you’ll help me?”
Her smile just got wider.  “You have no idea who I am, do you?”
The ring was a smooth, polished circle of white gold, understated enough that it was overshadowed by the larger, flashier pieces of jewelry that surrounded it.  But even at a distance, he could make out a subtle, sophisticated pattern etched into the metal.  Tony leaned in, shading his eyes as he tried to get a better look.
Aimsbridge let out a soft chuckle. “Chin up, Captain.” He paused, a puckish glint in his eyes. “Figuratively and literally.”
Her eyes followed the gesture, her mouth going thin and tight.  “I'm going to do my best to-”
“Because breaking his legs wouldn’t be enough,” Steve said.
“It’s Vegas,” Harris snapped as Darcy shoved him into the back seat.  “I think they’re prepared for a hoodie and a pair of glasses.”
She set a finger against the signature line.  “Yes.”  She picked up his pen with her other hand.  “You are.”
DJ snapped back to reality, so quickly that it made him dizzy.  His hands jerked back, and this time, when his tea cup went tumbling to the ground, no one seemed to notice.  Wanda looked over her shoulder at Agatha, her chin up.  “It’s not her.”
“And you try to comfort me when I do,” Sam said.  He patted Steve on the back.  “Don't worry.  You start whining about this regularly and I'll put you in your privileged ass place.”
For Steve to be reaching for him.
“They're off to fetch the last of the apples,” Mrs. Parker said, dusting her hands off on her apron.  “And Jarvis and I have dinner to get on the table, so perhaps-”
A tear curled down her cheek. “No.”  Her jaw worked.  “Kind of...  Wanted to, sometimes.”
“At this rate, I just might,” Obie said.  He smiled, just a little.  “Tomorrow.  You and I need to have a talk.”
Tony spun the chair around so he could fold his arms on the back of it, bracing one foot on the mini sofa that was positioned in front of DJ's bed.  A handful of old toys were piled up there on the cushions, mixed with some discarded clothing and a stack of books.  He reached out, picking up a stuffed bear.  “So.  You've been having nightmares again.”
Harris’ head snapped back towards the portal.  “What-”
Steve went back to the apple basket.  “Where did he find you?”
“You remind me of my sister’s kid.  He’s three. And everything is ‘why,’” Morse said.  She straightened up, blowing a strand of hair out of her face with a quick, sharp exhale of breath.  “Why, why, why.”
“And I guess that’ll have to do.”  In the front seat, he heard Tony shift, his thumbs tapping on his phone.  “And ‘reasonably sure’ is about the best anyone can do, with this place.”
"Because he doesn't work for us," Marcy said. "And thus, I have no power over him, Mr. Stark. I can say, 'do not do the thing, you idiot,' and he then says, 'thank you for the advice, ma'am, but this is something I've gotta do.'"
“Are we done here?” Luke asked.  “'Cause we're supposed to be dancing here.  I don't mean to bring this up, but-”
Steve had done a lot of stupid things in his life.
Steve watched them go. “He can get himself ready for bed,” he said to Mrs. Parker.  “He’s been doing it for years.”
“See, he wouldn’t have figured that out if I was driving,” Bobbi said, tapping her fingertip against the brim of her hat.  Natasha’s eyes cut up, catching theirs in the rearview mirror.  Bobbi raised one shoulder in a half shrug.  “I’m just saying, that’s all.”
“Now, would I do something like that?” Clint asked, with a wide grin.
“God grant me the strength not to strangle him in his sleep,” Jarvis said, the words so tart that they were nearly curdled, and Rhodey choked on a laugh.  Jarvis gave him a look out of the corner of his eyes.  “Too much?”
When he returned to his apartment, the chairs were back at the table, the stove throwing a low, warm glow over the darkened interior.  Steve pulled the door shut behind him.  "I'm assuming I'll be able to 'find' you again in the morning, right?"
Steve watched him flip the pages, amused despite himself.  “I didn’t think your ego needed any further stroking,” he said.
“Steve knows where I am,” Tony said, cutting him off.
Bucky shouldered a bush out of the way.  “Maybe.”  He moved aside, and there, in the sandy, rocky wash, water flowed, more stream than river, but still.  Water.  Where he’d thought it would be.  Bucky crouched down, removing the cap from the first flask.  “But I’ll take your memory over mine.”
“No,” Steve repeated, taking the chopstick from him, and the other one, just for good measure.  “I’m not missing ‘A Christmas Carol’ because someone’s bleeding.”
Steve nodded. “Does he know about the basement?”  Happy looked at him, his face white, and Steve swore.  “How fast can we make it back to the house?”
Steve turned his head, catching Tony’s hand and holding it still to press a kiss against the palm.  Tony’s fingers twitched.  “If that didn’t work, I have another solution,” Tony said, ignoring the rush of heat that curled low in his belly, wiping away fear, stifling uncertainty.
“Yet much less fulfilling.” Jarvis held out Tony's jacket, and Tony slipped into it.
Tony staggered towards consciousness, reluctantly, so reluctantly, because everything hurt.  He breathed, and his chest ached, his throat ached, his head ached.  Everything hurt, and he resented it.
Not that Steve was going off the cuff on this, either.  “I…”  He stopped.  “I don’t want my reaction to it to weigh in his decision here,” he said at last.  “He clearly didn’t want me to see it, it happened accidentally, and if he’s upset about it, or mad, I don’t want to make him feel worse.”  He looked up.  “If he got it when he was drunk and now he regrets it and he’s going to get it removed, I don’t want to…”
“We have associations.  Things we hold onto,” Rhodey said.  “And Tony, well, it’s food, it’s always food.”  He drained the rest of his coffee and stood, heading back to the pot.  “So I’ll give you a hint.  You’ll find me on Tony’s right wrist.”  He smiled.  “Think of that as your Rosetta stone, and work from there.”
He took one step and stepped on Tony's foot.  He bit out a curse, the worse hissed out from between his teeth.
“Point taken.”
“Were you really going to have sex with me down there?” Bucky asked.  “I mean, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, I was right down there, Steve, can't you keep your pants on for five minutes?”
"You seem to recall you riding my best serving tray down the full length of the grand staircase like a sled," Jarvis said, catching the other end of the blanket and helping Mrs. Parker move it to the railing.  “On an almost daily basis.”
Tony blinked at him, his eyes unfocused. “Alarm,” he said.
“Less what?” she asked, holding out a bag of Goldfish crackers.
“There's no history,” Steve said, his tone dire.
“Here lies Maria.
“Yeah, well, I feel worse,” Sam said.  “Can we go home?”
“Still in the back seat,” Clint said.  “Texting in a very angry manner.”  He waved them off.  “Go ahead.  I’ll get him.”
Slowly, carefully, Phil put his coffee cup down.
“Probably more than one,” Tony agreed, taking it back from her.  He scribbled on the line she indicated, then looked up at Jarvis.  “Jay?”
“Was I drunk?”
The teenager laughed.  "Good practice for me."  The woman nudged him, pointing from Tony to the masks, speaking rapidly.  The boy nodded.  “Free.  We take donations.”  He pointed at the wooden box at the end of the table.  “But free.”  He grabbed a few from the box and held them out.  “Take one!”
Sam grabbed his shoulder before he could manage to get fully upright, snagging his cup before the water went everywhere.  "Don't even think about it, Cap."
"And Ellen Ning."
“Yours, mostly,” Darcy said.  “I pointed out he could legally adopt me without having to marry my mother, but I didn’t manage to get any traction on that idea.” She looked at DJ.  “So, what am I missing?  What’s it like, being a Stark?”
Natasha looked over her shoulder, her eyes huge and her lips pursed in a pout.  “Would I do that?”
Tony had commandeered a tray of champagne flutes and was wandering the room, distributing them with a charming smile and his usual grace.  Steve kept a close eye on him, waiting for him to work his way through the crowd, so he was close enough to see, and hear, and react, then he reached up, and rang the mistletoe bells.
“Arrange a convenient break-in?  Pay Bucky to haul it away?”
“Know what, Rhodes?  Don't want to take my reject designs?  Make your own,” Tony said, reaching for his coffee cup.  He drained the last dregs.  “Deej?”  DJ looked up at him, and Tony reached out, smoothing his hair away from his face.  “I need you to stay off the internet while we're gone.”
Tony wasn’t surprised when his phone started vibrating in his pocket.  He’d honestly been expecting it before they made it to the airport.  Clint, halfway up the stairs to the jet paused, looking back at him.  Tony held up a finger in a quick ‘one second’ gesture, and Clint nodded, disappearing through the door.
“I’m getting the feeling this is more for your benefit than mine,” Steve said, his voice full of affection, his thumb still rubbing slow, steady patterns across the back of Tony’s hand.  “Almost like these gifts aren’t for me at all.”
“I wasn’t eager to go back there, to pack up what little we had, to put Peter’s books and clothes and toys in crates yet again.  So we were standing there.”  She paused.  “He hadn’t come to the funeral, of course.   No one expected him to.  A few men from the factory conveyed their sympathies, and that was more than most got, when their husband or father died on the job.
Steve glanced back over his shoulder.  Tony hadn’t looked away from his work, his fingers darting through the holographic projections with a speed that Steve could barely track.  His fingers were a blur of movement, cutting through the light with total assurance.  From the outside, it was a dance, it was a spell, it was miraculous.
DJ broke it in half and offered a piece to Steve.  “Call?”
The girl nodded.  “Yes.  I can tell him.  Mr. Stark took the boy upstairs,” she parroted.
One of Logan's shoulders rose in a half shrug.  “Next time, don't start the party without us.”  He leaned forward.  “She okay?”
Tony stared into the dark depths of his cup, exhaustion sweeping over him.  None of it made any sense, really.  He’d been working almost constantly, both in his workshop and down in the sub-basements.  But when he finally managed to collapse into his bed, he’d found sleep hard to come by.  It wasn’t as if he missed Steve.  Sure, he missed the sex, but he’d gone without sex before, and for a hell of a lot longer than a week.
The boy nodded.  “Mickey,” he said, wiping his mouth on the back of his wrist.  “You’re new here.”
“I know that.  And so does he, or he would not have risked everything.” Jarvis reached out, smoothing Tony’s hair back into place.  Tony did his best not to lean into the contact.  “This is a rat’s nest, do I have to go back to combing it for you every morning?”
He looked up, blinking fast.  “To be afraid.”
Rogers took a deep breath.  “He would’ve built his own.  He was well on his way before we even realized what he was doing.”  He pushed his hair back, his fingertips sliding through the strands.  “He knew how to fly, he knew it was possible, there was no taking that back.”
“Yes.”  Tony reached for a glass stirring rod.
“Yeah, yeah,” Clint said, flexing his arm, testing the duct tape fix.  It held together, and he made a grab for Darcy’s churro.  She held it out of reach with a grin.  “Gimme.”
Steve gave a slight chuckle.  “I think I can manage it on my own.”
Steve’s face relaxed into a grin, and DJ felt his shoulders relax at the same time.  “I can see how that would be helpful.” He leaned back in his seat.  “I’ll pick you up at six, then.”
"Yes, there is, he likes it here, and yes, it seems like that's the sort of thing you'd remember, but he's, there's a thing on him, Stephen Strange did something, I still don't-” Sue stared at him.  Tony stared back. “What?” he asked.
Steve glanced over at the envelope.  He as pretty sure he'd never seen it before.  “Don't think so,” he said, but Sam handed it over anyway.  His name was written on the front, in Tony's strong, familiar hand.  He cleared his throat.  “Is Tony back at the tower?  I mean, he was here, earlier, and then...”  His voice trailed away, his face hot.
“Heist,” he said.  He leaned forward, ignoring when the bag bumped against his chin and pointed.  “There.”
Peter pushed open the door at the end of the hall, stepping out onto the second floor landing.  It closed behind him, the door disappearing as the panel slid seamlessly in place.  Peter jogged up the hall, his bare feet silent on the carpet runner.  The house was still and quiet, with only a few lamps left on to cast dim light across the landing.
She shrugged, and her shirt rippled with the movement of her shoulders.  “No one’s using it,” she said.  She reached up, pushing her hair back behind one pointed ear.  “Your hearing’s good.  Mine’s better.  I knew no one was in here.” She looked around.  “Besides, it’s just a locker room, right?”
Stark pried another cup loose and took a sip, his mouth moving as he gestured with the cardboard cup holder at the interior of the car.   Rogers shook his head.  He looked back, catching Tony’s eye, and Tony turned his attention back to his phone.
Steve finished pouring himself a cup of coffee, and returned the pot to its spot on the stove.  He turned back to Clint.  “You aren’t French.”
“You realize I've dug through worse for less,” Steve said, and Luke walked past, snagging the bag from Carol.
“And the general population isn’t particularly sympathetic to those problems,” Obie pointed out.  He exhaled, a long drawn out sigh.  “Tony.  I’m done discussing this.”
It wasn’t an ideal weapon, but it would do.
“I shall ask Chef to see what can be done to stretch the soup,” Jarvis said.
“Tony?” Pepper patted him on the shoulder.  “I’m front of house.  The kitchen is your problem.”
“I think you’ve got this,” Phil said, and Clint stuck the bow on his head.  Phil sighed.  “It’s not my color.”
Bucky took a deep breath, his shoulders squaring, his brow furrowing, and Steve’s head fell back.  “Don’t do this,” he said.  “James Barnes.  Don’t-”
The spike of rage caught him off guard.  Tony squeezed his eyes shut, words caught behind his clenched teeth.  He set his cup down.  “Right.  Everything’s a fucking joke.”
“I guess we are,” Steve agreed. He glanced back over his shoulder, back at the penthouse, a feeling of melancholy, of loss, sweeping over him. “But he's made his choice. I need to respect that.”
The fingers tightened, and pulled, and Steve went.
Pepper looked at Tony, her lips pursed.  “In my defense,” he started, and she closed her ledger and held it up over her head like a bludgeon.  Laughing, Tony skipped back out of reach.  “In my defense,” he repeated, “I think they were all in a bad mood before I got there.”
“I will let you know if there is any news,” she said.  “Because I hear from him constantly.”  Her head tipped to the side, her hair curling against her neck.  “In that way, you remind me of him.”  Tony arched an eyebrow at her, and she smiled.  “He, too, assures me that he’s much more suave than evidence would suggest.”
“She said you’re the best Tony Stark cosplayer she’s seen all weekend,” Harris said.  Tony stared at him, and he shrugged.  “I mean.  Plus side.  You’re the best ‘you’ she’s seen.”
“This is against my better judgment,” Tony said, but he braced a hand on the table, lowering himself down into the chair.  He made a sound that was rather obscene, and Steve grinned at him.  “Shut up.  I'm old.”
“Claymation is unnatural,” Tony said.  “It is, I don't have many strong opinions on many things, Pepper-”
“Time for a tour of the boroughs,” Happy said. Whistling to himself, he shut the door after Tony.
“Right,” Tony drawled.  He kicked the blankets out of the way.  “So.  You recover your truck?”
Coulson was a step behind the newcomer, his face an expressionless mask.  “This is Commander Gyrich,” he said, stating the obvious so that Tony couldn't later claim that he didn't know.
“Spouse, and thus, medical proxy coming through,” Tony said, because he wasn't sure if that was right, but what the hell was the point of accidentally marrying one of your best friends if you couldn't use it to throw your weight around?  He brushed his way past a nurse and what looked to be a couple of interns, plowing straight towards the bed.
Tony pushed himself to his feet.  “I'll let you know after we tell them.”
Steve was silent, his palm settling over the tattoo, cupping it in the hollow of his hand.  Then he leaned over and pressed a kiss to the back of Tony’s shoulder, his breath warm through the fabric of his shirt.  Tony swallowed, his heart pounding in his ears.  “Knew I should’ve kept my shirt on.”
Rhodey took a bite, and his eyes closed.  For a moment he just stood there, chewing, and then he reached up, covering his mouth with one hand.  “Holy fuck,” he mumbled through his fingers.
“No,” Steve said.  He softened that with a tight smile.  “Thank you, ma’am.  But no.  I’m-”  He shoved a hand through his hair, pulling a bit harder than was necessary.  “I’m not interested.”
"Mostly, but Mr. Fletcher down at the shop left a bit of meat on there for you."  Steve smiled at her as he headed up the narrow, rickety stairs of the tenement.  "Think he's sweet on you."
“I don't see why,” Tony drawled.  “Because I don't know what this big boy is looking for, but it is absolutely on the make.”  The robot stepped sideways, picking its way around a half dozen deserted cars.  “The energy usage is off the charts, and most of it's going to passive use.  It's running a variety of scans.  Some of which, I don't even know what it's scanning for.”  He skimmed the top of a building, cutting around to get in front of the thing again.  “Banner?  You got anything on this mess?”
“Martin Morrison."
Tony ignored her.  “It’s just that he’s so much fun to fluster.”  He grinned. “I’ve never known a grown man to blush that much, or that easily.”
“What can I do for you, Jay?” Tony asked, pushing his chair away from his desk.  He spared a glance for his suit jacket, but bypassed it without a twinge of guilt.
Steve couldn’t stop checking Tony’s pulse.
Danvers turned around.  “Now what?” she repeated.  “Did you give the cat-”
“Wanna know what's in a mai tai?” Jessica asked Jess.
"That was pretty judgey, Jay," Tony said from under the cover of his pillow.
DJ didn’t say a word, his teeth digging into his bottom lip.  Tony tried to smile.  “But no matter what.  I’m not…  Sending you back.  You never have to go back to Hammer’s.  Not if you don’t want to, DJ.  You can stay.  If that’s what you want.”
“Bruce locks it,” Tony said.  “He’s a bit paranoid, but it makes him feel better.”  He braced his chin on his palm.  “Did you find what you were looking for?”
Steve tried to muffle his laughter behind a hand.  “And you choose…”
Tony gave him a thin lipped smile.  “Right.  He's hooked up to every machine imaginable, Jarvis has got a lock on him, and Sam will be here soon.” He leaned in.  “He's being monitored.  But all of you-” He waved his hand at the medical staff. “Are only stressing him out right now, and that's not beneficial.”
Thor nodded.  “And that is?”

“No, you weren’t, because you’re too smart for that,  I can hear you start, and catch yourself, and it’s-  It’s-” Tony rotated his shoulders, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet, all leashed tension and strain, pulsing along the length of his frame.  “I know.  We do what we have to do, to keep our heads somewhere useful, somewhere…”
Tony groaned.  "How drunk was I?  Because, I have to say, I am very hungover right now."
“He has two,” Steve said, pulling down the rest of the signs.  “You’re reading the public one.  He…  He doesn’t run that one.”
“Right,” he said. “Never”
Steve gave him a look, but it was tempered with a slight smile.  "You could ask," he said.  "Unless you'd like to continue wasting time?"
His chair was removed from theirs, both in physical distance and in style.  Made of plain, unadorned wood with no cushion on the back or the seat, it was set at the far end of the table, well away from the rest of the family.  That was where it always stayed, and that was where Tony always sat.  Well out of reach from the heavy serving platters of savory, well-seasoned meat and crisp vegetables, gleaming under a cloak of sauce or clarified butter.  Baskets filled with bread, studded with nuts and raisins, warred for space with pots of jam and plates of pickles, and bottle after bottle after bottle of wine.
He crossed his arms over his chest.  “He knows about fifty ways out of Hammer’s place, and he doesn’t repeat them often.  He just…” His throat worked as he tried to swallow.  “Anyway.  Yes.  Figured when  you were done with your press releases, and he went back, well, no one would blame him for running away again.
The kiss went on and on, and he was drowning in it, he was losing his mind, he was losing everything, and he didn’t care.  And when Tony’s mouth finally pulled away from his, he was breathing hard, gasping against the plane of Steve’s check, his jaw, his neck.  Steve let his head fall back, somehow not surprised to find himself on the floor, Tony half straddling his legs.
"You planning on making a scene?"
Steve's head tipped forward.  "You did not."
Harris nodded back.  “Are you going to try to get some sleep?”
“Thank you, sir,” Jarvis said, setting a plate of roast beef, roasted new potatoes, maple glazed carrots and julienned green beans.  “And, if I might say, sir, a most creative chef.”
She looked at the bleach bucket.  “We done here?”
“Spin is just a matter of making sure that the story that's told in the press is the story we want told,” Marcy said.  “Because you got married.  To another man.  In another country.  It looks like you eloped, Tony.  It looks like the two of you were trying to do this in secret and you got caught, and that is not the story we want.”
It was slow.  Slow enough that he was surprised with it reached his hands, reached his hips, reached his chest.  He was already wet.  Of course he was.  The water had always been there.  Hadn’t it?  When had it gotten so high?  Why hadn’t he noticed when the sting of salt his his lips?  Why hadn’t he retreated long before that happened?
“If you would like,” Jarvis said, “I can give you a schedule, and a clock.  Then if you are unsure of what is happening, or you require reassurance as to what is expected of you, you will be able to check.”
Tony's fingers slipped beneath the waistband of Steve's pants, tickling at the sensitive skin just below his belly button.  “Are you saying I'm easy to predict?”
“Look, I don't, I don't know how he could-”  Peter scratched his head.  He huffed out a sigh.  “I don't see a way to fix this, to be honest.”
“Right,” Tony said.  “Who wants to deal with that, and who wants to make breakfast?”
Steve laughed, and Tony let his eyes close, savoring the warmth that swept through him at the sound.  “You're lucky I'm easy.”
There was a thick file folder sitting in the middle of the seat, and looking at it, Steve felt his stomach flip over, and he didn’t know why.  But when Bobbi slid into the car from the other side, his hand twitched, making an instinctive move towards it.
Her grin was bright, and for the first time, he noticed the sprinkling of freckles across the bridge of her pert nose, barely visible beneath her artful application of powder.  “Your help, if we should need it.”  Her head tipped to the side, and for an instant, she looked like half the girls he'd grown up with, clever, quick girls who survived and thrived the best they could.
“Yes, but short term, it’s an excellent plan,” Tony pointed out.
“Anyway, he was like, ‘I’d never be caught dead in one of those roach coaches,’ and you said, ‘yeah, don’t think they make one big enough to carry your ego,’ and then things got very, very quiet.”
“Let’s work up to the opera,” Tony said.
Harris’ head appeared at the end of the aisle.  “How…  Would that work?  With the flying?  And the-” He gestured at his chest.  “Missiles?”
He stopped, his mouth going into a thin line.  “Right.”  He took a deep breath and held it, just for a second, then let it out. “I'll see what I can do.”
That by the time the car screeched to a stop in front of his building, both other their hands ached.  And neither of them wanted to let go.
“Up here.”
He reached for his coffee cup.  “If you got that far, that easily, and then got caught in a pincer movement, then that means that they’d set a trap, and you were not who they were hoping to catch.”  Steve took a sip.  “So let me guess, he set someone up, letting them know that something was hidden in a seemingly worthless vase, and part of your employment agreement was to let him know who hired you?”
“I'm not sure you understand nobility, Mr. Stark, but some of us are perfectly comfortable doing the right thing for everyone, and claim no credit for it.”  He looked back at Clint.  “Or showboat to gain public approval.”  Clint met his eyes without flinching.  Gyrich smiled, cold and sharp.  “You're very lucky you're not in jail right now, Agent.”
"That he's a hired killer who was told by his employer exactly what to say to cover his tracks if he got caught," Steve said.  He straightened up.  "I've got no doubt that the communists want Stark dead, but I don't think they can afford this lummox.  Let me-"
“Right,” Bruce said, giving the boxes a wary look on his way to the fridge.  “How’d that go?”
“Denny’s,” Tony said with a straight face.  “Just in time for a Moon Over My Hammy.”
“GIANT FOAM CAT PAWS,” she said, in the tones of someone who’d discovered a holy relic, and Clint held out a hand.
DJ’s fingers picked at the fabric of his pants.  “Miss her?” he whispered.
Steve nodded.  “Glad to meet you, Pepper.”
“It’s not the only thing,” Bruce said.  He rocked forward and back on the balls of his feet.  “We’re also, uh, we’re going in circles.”  He glanced around the room.  “So, what are we going to DO about it?”
“Then, hush yourself, son.” Trip raised her hands.  “Any other-”
Only after Peter was gone, the door closed firmly behind him, did he relax.  “He’s not allowed to talk to me any more.”
“You didn’t tell me you were coming here, either,” his father said, turning his attention back to his sushi.  He picked at a roll, the tips of his chopsticks flicking away the wasabi.  “You’re old enough to make your own choices, Deej.”  His eyes came up, and he smiled.  “And you were always smart enough to make your own choices.  So.”  He straightened up.  “It’s your choice.  Can I stay?”
“I've got faith in you.”
“No,” she said.  “Those are old stories, of an old land.  The fairies are long gone, my darling boy, like the ancient woods and deep, dark places they hid.  There’s nothing like that here.”  She picked up her teacup.  “Still.”
“I don’t want a job,” Steve said, and he hated how that sounded, hated how it sounded like a plea.
“Does everyone get a double?” Trip asked.  She looked at Coulson. “Where’s yours?”
He'd loved Pepper, maybe he still did.  So why was it surprising that he'd loved Rhodey, too?  His fingers flexed at his sides, forming fists for a second before he forced them to relax.  Maybe he still loved Rhodey.
Tony reached down, picking up a familiar toy from the pile.  “Don't grow up too quickly, okay, kid?” he whispered, tucking Furbro into the curve of DJ's arm.  “Your breaking your old man's heart.”
“Thank you,” Steve told him.  “I like you, too.”  He  leaned over, pressing a kiss to the top of Tony's head.  “Let me know when you're ready for dinner.”
“And no one believes you.” Greer made a shooing movement with her other hand.  “I promise, I won’t break him.”
“I’m cutting him off,” Tony said.
“It sounds much better in Latin,” Steve said, making her laugh.  But she tugged him into the steps, firm and gentle by turns.  “Okay, is this-”  He moved with her, one smooth step, and she gave him a pleased smile.
"Is there anything you regret, from this little escapade of yours?" Joy asked. She seemed glad that the conversation had turned from legal matters and journalistic ethics. Steve wasn't sure if he was or not.
“I would’ve ended up paying for your divorce somehow, so no,” Phil said.  There was a throbbing behind his temples, and he pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Are we done with this, Clint?  Because, as you see, I’ve got some paperwork to do.”
“Do I,” Tony said, and it wasn’t really a question.
“There's an herbal blend in the cabinet,” Steve said, ignoring Tony entirely.  Tony hissed at him, and Steve tugged the blanket up over his head like a hood.  “It's good.  I got it from Strange's Van of Sketchiness.”
“So he’s dropping you off on the way?” Steve asked.  DJ nodded.  “Want me to pick you up?  Or is Stephen sending you home?”
Jan leaned to the side, looking around him.  “Is that Tony's room?”  Her face melted into a bright grin.  “Oh, I have to see this.”
DJ nodded.  “Yes,” he said, his fingers relaxing.  He looked at Harris, relief all over his face.  “Yes.  If I can?”
Steve took a sip of coffee, nodding.   “At what point did Pepper shoot him?”
“That, he already knows.”  With one last nod, Strange turned, and disappeared into the glowing portal.
Steve's lips quirked up.  “Probably not,” he said.  He stood up.  “Point taken.”
Steve smiled.  “Yes, sir, I think you would.”
“So I hear.”  Tony picked up a piece of bacon from the platter, peeking over Bruce’s shoulder.  “What is he studying?”
“It’s not-”
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  Reached for his coffee.  “In my defense, I have a root cellar, and I was trying to impress you.”
“Are these your socks?” Jarvis asked from the other side of the workbench.  “And where is your left loafer, sir, how can you only have one shoe here, whatever have you done with the other?”
"Pepper-"
The center of the city was barely contained chaos.
“All right, so I wouldn’t have, but I would’ve thought very seriously of doing it, and I don’t think he ever did.  He just wanted to see what was on the inside of it, and then, once we got it open, he just wanted to know how it worked, and I-” Tony stopped.  Took another bite of his sandwich.  “Fine.  So he fixed a clock.”
DJ thought about that, his mouth twisted to the side.  “Tired,” he said.
“Pepper will pencil you in,” Tony said, pushing himself a little higher up on the headboard.  “Sorry, Obie.”
Tony waved him off.  “I made a mistake,” he said.  “And I don't get how, but it's clear I did, but-”
“I didn’t want a cat,” Bucky told her.
Steve's eyes rolled up towards the ceiling.  “I don't know what to do with that information.”  He grabbed a clean glass from the cabinet and filled it.
Steve's lips twitched.  "Okay, a lot of them are Clint.” He started ticking them off on his fingers.  “Clint, Natasha, Carol, Thor-"
When the cushions were clear, he grabbed a pillow and blanket, and shifted DJ into a fully prone position.  “There you go,” he said, but it was still wrong.  He crouched down next to the couch, his fingers pushing DJ's hair back.   He looked so young still, but Tony could see the hints of the adult he'd become in his face, and it hurt.
“He started bootlegging,” Bobbi agreed.  “And he was good at it.  He was very good at it.  At making a product that could be relied upon to be clean, hygienic and relatively tasty.”  She paused.  “Also, wouldn’t make you go blind.”
“I’d like to point out-” Jan started, and Carol slapped the team’s takeout menu file down on the table.
“Merry Christmas, small one,” Thor said, scooping him up.  “Are you eager for your gifts?  I have one for you, straight from my mother’s hands to yours.”
Coulson brushed cat fur off of the sleeve of his jacket. “Sanitize everything,” he said.
“Yeah, yeah,” Steve said.  He picked up the cat, holding it in front of him.  “Hi there.  You need to go home.  Your mom's going to be missing you.”
The way Steve saw it, he had two choices.  He could fight his way through them, or he could jump for it.  Steve cast a sharp eye towards the ink black water of the harbor.  Fighting seemed far safer.
“No, we do not, but they are loud and clumsy, and get in each other’s way, making it impossible for them to do anything without being seen.  For now, that’s enough.” Jarvis set the plates and cups in the rack to be washed.  “Mr. Rhodes, will you be spending the night?”
Tony leaned an arm on the couch next to Steve, his eyes dancing.  “You rang?” he asked, his voice low and husky.  “Sorry.  I couldn’t resist.”
Steve smiled.  “He was always a little more overprotective than was strictly necessary,” he said.
“Recipe that Hitomi gave me,” Tony said, sweeping the onions into a pile.  “I’m trying to learn some of DJ’s favorites.  This is a chicken an vegetable, well, it’s a stew of sorts,” he said.  “In creamy white sauce.  So it’s pretty much custom made for a small person who prefers his food comforting and familiar.”  He waved a hand in Steve’s direction.  “Or my difficult supertaster.”
“Sound asleep on the pool table,” Natasha said.  “His back is going to be very displeased with him tomorrow.”
“Magical ice,” Bucky said.
“Yeah, do one cannonball into a third floor bathtub and flood two rooms under it, and people learn,” Tony said, leaning forward to press a kiss against Steve’s forehead.
His eyes snapped open.  Steve.  He didn’t know if he said it, or just thought it, but Steve heard him anyway.  The others were there, people, so many people all at once, and all of them talking, but all DJ cared about was Steve.
“I know,” DJ said, hopping off of his stool.  He grabbed his tablet, tucking it under his arm before he crossed to the cabinet where they kept his backpacket.
“Waste of time,” Tony said.  Someone nearby was selling something fried, he could smell the crisp, heavy smell of melting sugar and hot oil.  Tony followed his nose, leaving Steve to trail along behind him.  “The line for punching Doctor Doom is short.  Just saying.  We could get that done now-”
Jarvis cleared his throat, and Steve realized he was staring, something uncomfortably like lust curling low in his stomach.  Jarvis shut the door.  "Sir, you have a guest."
“Such as the US government,” Victor said, his eyebrows arching.
Jarvis considered him, a soft, gentle smile on his face.  “Of course you are,” he said, but he let Steve reclaim his pants.  “After all, DJ is staying.” He turned his attention to folding shirts.  “He will be expecting to see you again, and I know you would not want to disappoint him.”
“Don't-” Steve grabbed for the phone, and Sam backpedaled out of reach, his arms held over his head.  “Sam, don't-”
Tony took a deep breath, and let it out, his fingers stroking Steve's hair.  “Well, aren't you lucky?” he said.  “You're going to be okay, Steve.  Just get some rest.” Steve's shoulders twitched, and Tony drew the blankets up to cover him, as best as he could manage without moving him.  “You'll feel better in the morning.”
“I can go out with Clint if I want,” Tony said, because he was a contrarian bastard.
“Right,” Clint said, throwing the car in gear.  “So we have to go back.  We have to-”
She held out her hand, and Furbro, now curled around her wrist, gave DJ a disgruntled look.  “Here,” she said.  “I think this is yours?”
Stark paused, his head tipping to the side.  “Absolutely not,” he said, his voice light.
“Forth one this mornin’,” the man said.  “The cook told us which ones he was expectin’, and thems got a list out at the gate.  If someone ain’t on it, they ain’t gettin’ in.”
“I loved your father like a brother,” Obie said.  “You know I did.  And I admired what he did, how he moved mountains, how he made entire industries from next to nothing.”
“I’m living my best life, Jarvis, I promise I’ll bathe, and I’m firing you tomorrow, I’d do it today, but I’m too busy, I’ve got things to do, so many-”  There was a sound of clattering china from behind him.  He smiled. “So many wonderful things to do, so…  If you’ll excuse me.”
Tony tucked his hands in his pockets, mostly to keep them from grabbing the front of Rogers' shirt and dragging him down.  “Steve,” he said, the word felt like a victory on his tongue.
“We, at least, accept that our lives are out of our control and it’s best to roll with that,” Darcy said.  “You seem to think that if you struggle hard enough, you’re going to wriggle through a hole in the net, but let me tell you, buster?”  She dropped her tray onto an unoccupied table with a clatter.  “You’re not going to.  And talking about it is only going to make it worse.”
“You're not my whole world, Tony, but you've made my world a lot better.  You've made my life better.  And every time you smile at me, every time you hand me a spoon to taste your latest ridiculous concoction-”
Steve swallowed.  “You didn’t.”
“One, the door to the yard.  And two, the door to the pantry.”  Clint snagged a heavy earthenware jar from a shelf, flipping the cover into the air and digging out a scoop of flour before catching it.  “Message was pretty clear.  Take some food.  And get out.”
Steve nodded, and Tony studied the sharp, hard line of his jaw, the angle of his brow.  He set down his welding torch, letting it drop to the workbench from just enough of a height so it would clatter against the steel top.  It wasn’t much.  But it was enough to get Steve’s attention.  He looked over, and Tony smiled at him, stripping off his gloves.  “Right.  We’re-” His head tipped in Steve’s direction.  “Mostly Steve, honestly, but we’re working on some other angles.”
“Cap?"
“This is not a vacation,” Tony said, leaning over the back of her seat.
Tony paused just outside the elevator, caught off guard.  It had been a long time since there had been anyone else in the penthouse when he came home.  Even when he'd been with Pepper, it had been a toss-up as to which of them would get there first.  And neither of them had been much for cooking.
Agatha let out her breath in a huff.  “It’s not her,” she repeated.  She leaned forward, her eyes going into slits.  “Who, exactly, are you, young man?”
Tony straightened up, letting the water roll down his neck and over his chest.  He braced his hands on the sides of the sink, holding on like it was the last lifeline he possessed.  “And it's easier to drown myself in the sink,” he gritted out.  He blinked at his reflection in the mirror, all huge, dark eyes and chalk white skin.  “Jay, how badly did I embarrass myself?”
“Wasn't planning on making a run for it,” Tony said, because he might be on death's door, his throat might be on fire, but he still couldn't keep his mouth shut.  He scrubbed a hand over his face.  “What time is it?”
"The difference is," Sam said, cutting him off, "is that a therapist gets paid, and a friend's seen your sketchbooks."
Jarvis reentered the room, his expression resigned.  “It's quite all right, sir.”  He set DJ's shoes down on the dressing table and headed for the hallway door.  "He's all bark and no bite."  Before Steve could stop him, he opened the door and leaned out.  "Lord Odinson!” he called.  “We've just replaced two of the windows, and I should prefer it if you do not make it necessary for us to replace any more."
Pepper sipped the milkshake, one eyebrow arched.
“Your place?” Billy said as Tony ducked past Natasha, wrenching the driver’s side door of the car open.  She grabbed the door, blocking him.
Sam stared at him.  “Are you-  Look, man, if you want to kiss me, for like, practice or something, that’s fine, we don’t need to do the bell thing-”
This story was always going to end this way.  Steve was too stubborn to let himself be charmed into staying.
"Blunt force trauma," Bruce said.  "There's some burns, some cuts and contusions, but mostly, Tony, it was blunt force trauma."
Steve’s fingers flexed, an instinctive motion that he couldn’t quite control.  He forced his hands flat on his thighs.
Steve chuckled.  “Being hungry tends to make you practical,” he said, half rolling on his side.  “You can have it, if you want.”
“Too embarrassing to show you,” Steve said with a straight face.
Steve nodded.  “Nice to know he showed sense for once.”
That won him a smile.  “I'll keep looking,” she said.  “But I think this is the worst of it.  Almost everything was already in circulation.”
“Yes, because a screaming child is sure to do wonders for my public image,” he drawled.  Instead, he lowered himself down to sit on the bottom of the staircase, long legs thrown out in front of him on the polished marble floor.  “Want to go look at the cars again?” he offered DJ, his hands braced on either side of his hips.  DJ shifted position, but didn't leave Mrs. Parker's side.  Stark smiled.  “Or...”
“You were asleep under the greenhouse tables,” Natasha said.  “You're lucky I didn't turn on the sprinkler system.
"Often enough."  She waved a hand above them, at the building in general.  "We're kind of a big target, for a lot of people.  Jarvis will let him know if we've got a particularly stubborn one, or if he's not around, he'll notify us.  We make sure they at least leave with a chance."  She shook her head.  "It's not a perfect system, but if we can get them to the shelter, they can give these kids a safe place to get things sorted out.  More than food or shelter, some of them need counseling, they need acceptance."
“Yes,” Harris agreed.
Tony tossed back the alcohol in one gulp.  “Not now.  And that's all that matters.”
“If you think I’m getting between you and her right now, you’re out of your mind,” Rhodey said.  “I’m your chief designer, not your bodyguard.”
“I did.” Steve exhaled as they cut hard around a skyscraper, heading straight for the Tower.  “He's okay, Tony.  They're not coming for him.”
“Welcome.”  DJ leaned his forehead against Rogers chest for a second, his eyes flickering closed.  Then he straightened up.  “You, too,” he said to Stark.
Tony leaned back against the workbench, his hands gripping the edge on either side of his hips.  “Jay, pull anything we had from the interdementional bridge we built the last time our kid ended up in another plane of existence.”
“And a Roomba,” DJ said.
“Apprentice,” Strange corrected.
Tony took a breath, and it burned.  “But you didn’t.”
“Every party I’ve ever been to,” Steve said, his voice dire, and Tony laughed again.
"I'm HELPING," Ed said, and DJ crept towards the door, the cup cradled between his palms.  “I made it extra good.  If you're going to show up ten minutes late with coffee, it better be damn good coffee, after all.”
“If I wasn't me, I could just tell him,” Steve burst out.  He looked up at Sam.  “I could just-”
“All of them?” he asked, as the doors opened.  “Really.”  He slipped past Steve, light on his feet when he wanted to be.  “I'm hurt, Cap.”
“A bowl in his own kitchen?” Steve asked.
“And Peter will be sent to a boarding school of some sort in the morning, some sort of prep school where he will be buried under philosophical texts and mathematical treatises until we forget that he is a shame upon this household,” Tony continued.
Natasha leaned into his line of sight, her red curls framing her face like a halo.  “What's wrong?” she asked, her face half hidden behind her cup.  But her eyes were soft, and her voice was kind, and DJ felt some of the tension go out of his shoulders.
Steve leaned over, brushing an upside-down kiss on his lips, the gesture both odd and familiar.  “I already sent everything over to Pepper,” he said, and Tony groaned.
Tony looked back at Pepper and immediately regretted it.  “What makes you think-” he started.
“I am pleased to hear it.” Clea set the cake plate down on the workbench, right next to Bruce’s work.  She didn’t seem to notice the way he flinched.  She looked up at Tony, her expression sympathetic.  “I have no news, I fear.”
“Fine, you can tag in your replacement,” Jan said, waving at Tony.  “Despite his usual diet, he does actually have a very refined palette.”
Tony turned around in his pew.  DJ was at the rear of the chapel, a stack of flower crowns balanced precariously on his head.  Behind him, two Doctor Stranges stood shoulder to shoulder, mirror images of one another.  As Tony watched, DJ crouched down, and the cat hopped off of the podium, padding its way back up the length of the aisle.  As it proceeded, tail held high, SHIELD agents gave way, stepping out of the cat’s way and letting it pass.  DJ extended a hand, his fingers curled into his palm, and the cat rubbed against his knuckles.
Steve flinched, his shoulders rocking forward.  He licked his lips.  “Why-”
She frowned at him, then at Steve.  Steve tried a reassuring smile.  It didn't work.  She turned and ducked around the edge of the table.  Steve watched her go, his eyebrows raised.  “That went well,” he said.
Trip’s head swung from one to the other and back, fascinated despite her determination to not get involved in this most recent round of crazy.  “I mean, yeah, usually, of you wouldn’t be in a 24 hour wedding chapel,” she pointed out.  “But the requirements in Nevada are pretty-”
“As do I, but that poor woman needs a boss who pays more attention,” Obie said.  He glanced back down.  “You know, I remember you sitting down there with your mother.”
Jarvis blinked at him.  "With all due respect, Officer, I prefer to focus on whatever is most comfortable for you.  After all-"
“Exactly how much blood did I lose?” Tony asked.
“Heck, I’ll give you two,” she said.  “Might even give you honest answers.”
DJ looked back at them with a smile.  “Yes,” he called back.
"Strenuously?" Tony asked her.
Jarvis slipped Steve’s coat from his shoulders with practiced ease.  “I know, sir,” he said, giving the cloth a quick flick of his fingers.  “As to what you were actually asking, Mr. Stark is upstairs.”  He looked up, and for the first time, Steve could see the strain around his eyes, the tension that hovered around his mouth.  “He has been most…  Upset about your continued absence.”
Tony leaned forward.  “Oh, you think I'm kidding?” He grinned.  “I can make this happen.  You.  Me.  A van.  It'll be our hobo van.  We can criss cross the country, looking for trouble.”
Steve moved into the room, ducking down to peer up into the chimney.  “Appreciate that.  I’m…  Old fashioned myself, so…”
“What's your favorite?” he asked, as Steve took a seat next to him.
“Go back to sleep, Steve,” Tony said, burrowing down into the pillows.  A moment later, he was still, his breathing smoothing out into a slow, easy rhythm.  But his fingers were still tangled in Steve’s, his calloused fingertips rough against Steve’s skin.
DJ focused on the cat.  “Couldn’t sleep,” he admitted.  The words were thick in his mouth, losing meaning somewhere between his head and his tongue.  The cat’s tail paused, a shiver running down its length.
“It depends,” Tony said, handing him back the now useless cup.  “What’re you having?”
As the holographic numbers formed in front of him, Clea nodded.  “I do.”  She reached up, idly playing with a well formed number nine, spinning it in place.  “Stephen has, it is difficult to explain, but he is aware of me, in a way that most mortals cannot be.  He knows my movements, he knows when I approach, and more than that, there are subtle signals he can provide me if my presence is not beneficial or wanted, either due to timing or location.”
Eli laughed.  “No, thanks.”  He slid down in the chair, his hands folded over his stomach.  “Following these two losers into the food truck business.”
“Tony, I-”
"Miss Hill's never steered us wrong," Pepper pointed out.
“I don’t believe either of them considered that he hadn’t seen it in use previously,” Jarvis said.  “After all, he has been assisting you and Mr. Rhodes with far more complex pieces of machinery, and watched Mr. Hogan work on the autos in the garage.  But something about the sound appears to have disagreed with him, and he…”  Jarvis frowned.  “Reacted badly.”
“I’ve told you, you can do an amazing amount of damage with a simple pen,” Natasha told her.  She reached for a ballpoint on the desk. “Here, let me show you, just-”
Steve choked on a laugh.  "You would."
"Well, we haven't gotten sued, so lets go for the good one," Ellen said.  "While we still can."
Someone snored.
He set the spoon aside.  “And before you can ask, there used to be two.  And the apple was added later, too.”  The apple was half peeled already, the mottled red and yellow skin trailing around the three little sweets like a ribbon.  “It seemed right.”
“I think we can be forgiven for not considering that possibility,” she mused.  “Again.  Ice.  Big block of ice.”
She broke off a piece of her scone, holding it out to him.  “Okay?”
“Clint’s mad at us,” DJ pointed out, and Steve took a deep breath.
His hands were in fists at his sides, his muscles so tense that they were shaking.  He took a breath, forcing his fingers to relax with a force of will.  “Did I do okay?”  She looked at him, her eyes going wide, and Steve met her gaze without flinching.  “With him, I mean.”
“Then, no,” Steve said.  “I didn’t.” He took a breath.  “The orphan thing wasn’t your idea, was it?”
He looked back at his feet.  “Said that they’d taken a vote.  And they wanted to give me a stake in the company.  Because…”
Obie took it from Pepper, folding the page neatly into fourths.  “Children,” he said, his voice stern, “I need you all to focus.”  He tucked the paper into the pocket of his vest. “Tony. Guards. I can have them here tonight and you'll never-”
Bobbi hummed under her breath.  “Right,” she said.  “Though I think I have something you want to discuss.”  Steve glanced back, and she smiled.  “I’m hearing that you’ve been asking everyone how they ended up as part of the household.”
Franklin's eyes scrunched closed.  “Because!” he said.
“You still do need to eat.  Fuel for the fire of genius,” Pepper told him, tapping his notebook against her cheek.
“What a mess.”
Steve’s eyes opened.  “What?” he said, his voice blank.
“I'll follow you anywhere,” Tony said, and to his shock, he meant it.  He honestly meant it.  He grinned up at Steve.  “Name it.”
The wheels rolled against Steve's palm, the axle squeaking from disuse.  “But if these are heirlooms,” he said, his voice quiet, “they should be put aside for Mr. Stark's children.”
“How’s he doing?”
“Any additional pieces he steals, he’s keeping,” Rhodey told Tony.  “He’s crafty.”
"Focus," Marjorie said, and Jan made a face.
He stalked up the stairs, taking them two, three at a time, his orders clutched in his hand.  He shoved the door to Tony’s office open, his palm hitting it with a thud.  Tony was already seated behind his desk, a barricade that Steve didn’t know how to get past.  But he crossed the office, coming up short just in front of it, slapping a hand down on the polished wood.  “I already have a job.”
She stopped, right on the front stoop.  “And Tony slid into the back seat of the car, looked at me, and said, ‘so, how are you with plants?’”
Tony’s chest ached, and he nodded.  “You’ll remember us, won’t you?”  DJ nodded.  “Then I don’t want you to miss us.”
Tony blinked at him, his stomach sinking.  Not DJ.  “Who-”
Tony paused, then resumed his pacing.  Steve watched him go.  “We wouldn’t ask, but-”
“With a lot of confusion,” Steve said, reaching for a pawn.
“I’d like to, but-” Happy’s head jerked to the side, doing a quick check before he took a turn at almost full speed.  “Jarvis keeps his opinions to himself, but he’s been grumbling about Stane for a while now, and the man’s a real good judge of character.”
He looked at Tony.  “Swear to me.  On something that matters.”
“Thank you, ma’am.” He reached for the bowl, but she didn’t let it go.
“Then where's the dame?” Seamus asked, his hands on his hips. “You wouldn't put that suit on for no reason.”
“Despite all of that.”
Tony chuckled, and leaned over to retrieve a bottle for himself.  Steve jerked his gaze back to the bottle before he ended up staring at Tony’s ass.  “Could you be more of a Brooklyn hipster?” Tony asked, his voice muffled by the interior of the fridge.
DJ looked out the window, squinting into the late afternoon sunlight.  The Sanctum Sanctorum was a familiar sight by now, but he still wasn’t completely used to it.  “Yes.”  He grabbed his bag from the seat next to him, and leaned forward.  “Thank you.”  He tapped his knee, and Furbro, who had been peering out the back window, hopped onto his shoulder and scrambled down into DJ’s sweatshirt.  He wriggled into place, his head peeking out over the top of his zipper.  Grinning, DJ scratched him on the head, and the little lizard arched up into his touch.
Tony turned around in time to see Pepper step over a pile of debris that used to be a table.  “Oh.  My.  God.”  Her head swiveled around, her eyes huge.  “What-  Tony, what did you DO?”
Gentle fingers cupped his chin, tipping his head up.  Natasha smiled, just a little.  “No.  This is the part of the story where you have to admit that hurting yourself is enough.  That’s enough of a reason to stop.  You’re enough.  You-” He tried to pull away, and her fingers tightened, just a tiny bit.  “That’s why you hate drinking in front of them, because they believe you’re enough.  They know you are.  And guess what else?”
“I'll do my best,” Jane said, never breaking eye contact with Thor.  He scooped her up, his broad hands cupping her narrow waist, lifting her off her feet to spin her around.  She was laughing as she threw her arms around his neck.
“We're already late, Stark,” Steve called back over his shoulder.  “You can play with your friends later.”
"I've just met you, and I didn't want you in my house, and you clearly don't like me, and I still enjoy your company more than Hank's," Stark said to him with a sharp, manic smile, and Steve's stomach flipped over.  "You, at least, did not attempt to blow up my house."
“You can lie to me, if that makes it better,” he said, and felt Steve exhale against his temple.  Tony kissed him on the side of the neck.  “But don’t start lying to yourself.”
"So you still haven't fixed the memory leak with the OS of the StarkPhone 6?" a woman in the second row asked.
“The last tenant had geese, so the walls were well kept, and there’s an old coop around back.”  Carol Danvers was tall and long-limbed, with broad shoulders and well-muscled arms.  She barely seemed to notice the squash vines that ran wild across the pathway that lead to the front door, stepping easily over the broad leaves.  “The garden-” She gave the heavy headed sunflowers and overgrown patches of mint a look through narrowed eyes.  “Needs help.”
“Perfect solution,” Tony told him.
“Pretty sure you're right,” Tony rasped, coughing into a tissue.  His nose was running, and he mopped at it.  Steve tried to push his hair back, and Tony twitched away. “Don't, I'm going to be-”
The elevator doors opened, and Steve touched Sue's elbow.  He waited until she met his eyes, and then he smiled.  “Franklin's a very lucky boy,” he said.  “Not just because he does look quote unquote normal, not because he can pass as normal, but because he has a mother who will defend, to her death, his right to exist, as he is.  No matter what he can do, or how he chooses to live his life.  He's got a mother who will fight for him, no matter what.”
Okoye’s lips twitched.  “It’s not.”
Sitwell gave DJ a measuring look.  “You’ve got my number.  Phil’s getting-”
“Thank God,” Harris said, and he meant it.  “I need all the backup I can get.”
“And yet, this is so much better.”  Her chin came up, and she gave Steve a narrow eyed look.  “You send me back there, I will starve.”
He leaned forward.  “Did you know,” he said, his voice taking on a secretive tone, “that down in the basement, below all the other parts of the house, there's a workshop.  A secret workshop.  It's where I keep all of my prototypes.  All the machines I'm working on.  All the things I'm building.”
“I’d recommend the bean soup,” she said with an easy smile and a  wave.
Tony considered a damaged part.  “Trash heap.”  He tossed it back in the box.  “Do we throw nothing away?”
Sue heaved a massive copper pot onto its hook, barely glancing in his direction.  “Why punch when you have access to so much weaponry?” she asked, a finger tracing the bottom of the pot.
“Yeah?”
“Look, he uploaded a video to YouTube at like, four am, and that’s a time when people make bad choices, and you’re out of town, so I just wanted to make sure that he’s not cheating on you,” Bucky said.
“Absolutely not,” Tony said.  He took a sip, letting the heat burn its way down his throat.
“No,” Tony said, without missing a beat, and Steve laughed.  It was true, though.  He wanted to stay here.  Right here.  In this room.  With Steve.  “Want to order pizza?”  He shifted his weight, his hands going to his hips.  “We can watch a movie or something?”
Steve took it from him.  It had a solid weight for its size, and he let it fall into his lap.  “Thank you.”
Steve stared up at him.  "You have a French chef."
“So sparkly,” he said, and she nodded.
He paused.  “A personal gift from me, to you, for the insanity you just faced like the fucking pros you all are, and as such, I see no reason to put it down on any government paperwork, if you declare it, you’re an idiot and your coworkers will punch you in the head.”
“Thanks for agreeing to see me,” Rogers said.
“Swear I’ll kick you right into the river if you finish that sentence,” Bucky said.  He steered his horse around a slow moving boy and his flock of geese.  For a brief, endless moment, he was out of Steve’s reach, and then he was swinging back in.  “You and Wilson are the only people I know anymore, and I can’t stand Wilson.”
Steve shook his head.  “Good-bye, Sam.”
“I believe this conversation was something of a relief to him,” Jarvis said, his voice soft.  “And he has not slept well in some time.”
"I'm surprised he came at all,” Steve said.
“It’s possible,” Tony said.  “I’m not certain why you’re acting surprised at this late date, Pepper, it’s just, it smacks of a certain lack of understanding of the situation, and really, you should be beyond that by this point, it’s not-”
“Or, you know, Danvers is probably right about the mice,” Steve said.  He nudged Bucky another step back, but it was no longer an effort to separate him from Sam.  Steve let his arm drop, and crouched down, holding his hand out to the cat.  It sniffed delicately at his fingertips, and then rubbed the side of its face up against Steve’s hand.  “Besides.  It seems like a nice enough cat.”
“Oh!” Steve reached up, his fingers wrapping around the strap.  He gave it a tug, adjusting the shield on his back. “It’s a lot lighter than it looks.”
“Tony?”
Happy was waiting in the loading area right next to the elevator. “Glad to see you guys are finally on the same page,” he said, holding the back door of the limo open.
“It's a good weapon,” he said, going back to his soup.  It was silken and creamy in his mouth, warm and salty, richer than the potato soups he'd known as a boy, but somehow, still the same. He glanced up at Miss Potts.  “Familiar.”
Tony turned on him, spreading his hands wide.  “What did I say about encouraging her?”
"More relaxed?" Steve suggested.
"With Peter," Tony agreed.  "And the SHIELD crews."  He shoved a hand through his hair.  “We've got experts coming in to take over the clean up, but for now, SHIELD needs all the heavy lifters we've got.”  He shook his head.  “I can't deal with this right now, where is he?”
“Don’t they all,” she said.  She held up a hand.  “High five?”
DJ picked up his glass of juice, balancing it precariously on his pad of paper while he reached for his pencil.  “Downstairs.”
Steve shifted his weight.  “I’m sorry, Jan, I can-”
“It was only two,” Harris said, and Tony gave him a look.  Harris cleared his throat.  “And they were very different.”
"It was ONE TIME," Rogers said, with a perfectly straight face, but there was a pronounced twinkle in his eye, and his feet were moving faster now, a little looser, a little more natural.  As if he was relaxing into his own body, into the music.
