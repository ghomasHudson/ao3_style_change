To both of their relief, the tests they ran were all successful. They were able to tell the colonel as much before beginning work on the next piece of equipment needed for Project Rebirth. It would be the station that Howard himself would operate while the chamber was saturated in Vita-rays. They were going over the schematics of what they believed it should be. Tony knew this was just the first of many drafts, but it felt good to be moving ahead while knowing it wasn’t at the expense of Steve’s safety.
Before long Tony was heading out the door, after kissing them both and promising that they would all talk when he got home that night. Steve knew they had a lot of things to discuss, but it didn’t stop him from wanting to skip it and repeat what they’d done together last night. He sighed, maybe after.
“It kinda feels like you just did,” Steve said, knowing the man had full rights to remind him. “Just let me get my jacket, and we can go start asking about Bucky.”
The men around them cheered in celebration. Bucky’s eyes were slightly teasing as he met Steve’s, and Tony stood beside him smiling and laughing in the moment. Knowing they were all safe, knowing that he’d finally proved he could be useful, this was one of the best moments of Steve’s life.
take it. He had no choice really. He would never go back to what he was, empty and cold. He would never surrender his memories of Steve and Tony again. He didn’t know how, but they would find a way to beat this and get Tony back. He’d keep his promise. Tony would not be left behind to mourn them alone.
“He also handed me an envelope; it had a month’s rent in it. He said that you’d told him my husband had given it to you to give to me when he’d left his key with you. I can’t imagine where that money came from because he hadn’t worked in months.”
It was getting harder for them. Bucky thought about how it was funny, the things you began to miss in this place. The war was awful, but at least you were outside. You were able to see grass and trees, feel the sun on your skin. He’d never thought about those things before, but he did now. He was sick of concrete and metal and darkness and eating slop while still being hungry.
He guessed they felt pretty bad for not being able to help because they scrounged up a little money for him. They even offered to let him stay for a while, but Tony shut that down with a terse ‘no, thank you’. Steve and James had told him he was welcome to stay for a while, and he would gladly take them up on that if it meant he didn’t have to stay in magic central. It didn’t matter what time period he was in; that place made his skin crawl.
Dum Dum shrugged. “Cuz I can only get a decent bit of shut-eye when you’re on watch,” he answered in the blunt way of his.
Agent Carter laid out a map between them. “The HYDRA camp is in Kreuzburg tucked between these two mountain ranges. It’s a factory of some kind.”
Silence rang heavy in the room. Steve felt another wave of memories flood him, but he viciously shoved them away to the back of his mind.
Steve exclaimed over the new sets of charcoals, pastels and pencils he received. The premium sketchbooks of thick paper that the man at the store had assured Tony would add to the quality of the artist’s work, and the leather-bound portfolio cover was embossed with his initials. It would be perfect for protecting his sketches as he carried them around the city. He’d also received a new (and warmer) coat.
Bucky groaned as he came. Hot, thick ropes of it filled Tony’s mouth and throat, and he worked to swallow all of it. Once he had his mouth clear, Tony was reduced to begging.
No, you really shouldn’t, was what he couldn’t say, so he just pasted on a smile and pulled Steve into a half-hug, getting him to start walking. “Come on, man. It’s my last night. We gotta get you cleaned up.”
True to his word, Tony had booked himself a cabin somehow. Steve didn’t know how the man was able to get away with half the things he did, but he suspected that money, intimidation and the ability to confidently lie at any given time had to factor into it. He’d at least expected Tony to be interested in the ship and its engines, but no, Tony had gotten progressively quieter throughout the voyage. He’d stay tucked away in his cabin working on his gauntlet thing or staring at his cracked watch with his glasses on. Steve didn’t know why he would wear sunglasses inside a ship, but figured it was a quirk best left unmentioned.
Tony shook himself and agreed with the Cap so he refilled his lurid ‘Buttercup with bedhead’ coffee mug (Seriously Thor?) and took a long drink.
Tony exhaled heavily and began to raise his shirt. He hesitated when he got to edge of the wrappings at his chest but then thought
They eventually all settled in various places around the bed. Tony scribbled in his notepad as Bucky wrote a letter to his mother and sister. Steve was sketching some pictures he hoped to sell while Tony was recovering. The supplies Tony had given him for Christmas were wonderful. He never imagined the difference quality paper and pencils would make and warmth flooded his chest that Tony had gotten him something so thoughtful.
The light rain created a haze over the earth, but he could still see the group as they stepped into the forest clearing. Following the path Bucky had had his men make, they were almost right where Bucky wanted them to be.
Tony had woken up this morning determined to carry out his previous plan of a romantic night with Steve and Bucky. After his conversation with the butcher, that had resulted in a very grateful, very large man almost breaking his back in an unexpected hug, Tony hurried to get his morning jobs taken care of. At around noon he skipped having lunch so he could make a quick trip to Kensington to make sure everything was in order for their evening out. After last night he wanted to do something extra special.
“That motherfucker,” Tony spat. “I should have broken half the bones in his body and left him in the gutter. I swear to God I’m going to kick that jerkoff’s ass next time I see him.”
Steve shrugged. “Yeah, I guess. Bucky says my mouth is too big for my body. It gets me into trouble. I get sick a lot too,” Steve added, bitterly.
Crap. Tony hated paperwork. “In all fairness I did sign them. I just got a little distracted and forgot to send them over to you.”
I’m only starting to make peace with what has happened to me, to us, but I don’t blame you for any of it. Fuck, without you I’d still be lost. I’d still be a monster. Tony wouldn’t want you blame yourself either.”
The breakup was like a wound that refused to fully heal, despite it having been (mostly) mutual. Tony was not an ideal person to share your life with. He
“I gotta say, man” Sam said as they stopped near the counter and smiled. “I could really get used to seeing you laugh.”
“We’re better than OK.” Tony answered as he grabbed the other man’s hand and squeezed gently. “We’re together.”
“I leave you now, Captain,” Schmidt said turning back to them as the smaller man quickly fled the burning building. “I leave you to die with the insect, the rat and your delusions. Erskine’s final work will burn, and there will be none left to stop me.”
Steve pulled out all the way, then pushed back in again, going all the way down. His fingers found Tony’s nipples, and he squeezed them. Tony gagged around Bucky. His sweet boy just pushed in farther whispering, “Please, take all of me. Please, daddy.”
“Pearl Harbor happened.” Steve said harshly, too upset by the recent memories to keep his usual steady voice.
Steve’s eyes went down to Tony’s hands, looking conflicted. “I don’t know, Tony. We have no idea how I could react, and I couldn’t forgive myself if I hurt you.”
Growing up Tony spent most of his time away from home. He was usually at boarding school during the year, and he’d spend most of his summers at camps specifically geared towards science, mathematics and engineering. Then, there had been college when he’d turned fifteen.
. It’s not just from before the war, the ice or what Hydra did to you. You were my hero every day after those things because you never gave up. There was always a piece of you that they couldn’t touch, couldn’t break. Even when you couldn’t remember me, you
Steve looked just as tired as Tony felt, but he also appeared a little uncertain as he looked back into Tony’s eyes. He was about to ask Steve what was wrong when Steve said softly, “I hope I did everything right. I know it wasn’t all the stuff we discussed, and I know you’re used to more…p-pain at some moments. I just didn’t want to cross a line, and I know I’m not the most imposing person to submit to. I’m not even strong enough to move you around like I want or really hold you down, but I tried. I’ll understand if you don’t…”
“There’s a fine line between pleasure and pain,” Tony answered simply, “especially when body chemistry is involved. It can be done to help remove a person from their thoughts and focus on what their body is feeling. Sometimes the person receiving it just enjoys the pain inflicted.” Tony looked directly at him. “Speaking of which, I first need to apologize to you, Bucky.”
“Pie, Steve. Any form of thanks can be given in pie. You like your presents? Pie. If I hold the door for you? Pie. Pass the salt? Pie. It’s universal.”
He had even taken them camping in the fall for a few days. Just three friends out enjoying the wilderness, or that’s what they’d told people. They mostly stayed in their cabin and fucked on every surface, but that was only for them to know.
Bucky’s eyebrows rose. “It couldn’t have been that bad. We all got along fine in the past, and you two were gettin’ pretty close before all this happened.”
“I heard you, Steve.” Bucky said, talking over him. “I listened to every word you said so now, you’re gonna listen to me. Give yourself a break, Rogers! You are not God! You can’t control everything, and you can’t fix everything no matter how hard you try! Life has been knocking your ass to the ground since you were born, but you’ve always gotten back up, so you don’t get to think that about yourself! Do you not realize how fucked up your life is? ‘Cause I do. I know this because I’m one of the few people on the planet who could compete with you on how much life has shit on them. It’s a fuckin’ miracle we’re still here and trying to keep it together because it would be a hell of a lot easier to just eat a bullet.”
“That makes sense that it’s mostly in this country.” Sam said. “More people in America would have studied Captain America.”
Steve had been working with Iron Man long enough to recognize damage from a gauntlet blast when he saw it. So either Tony had been ridiculously careless with his tech (Steve didn’t believe that for a minute), or he’d been attacked and taken somewhere. He didn’t like the thought of that.
He walked around the table and grabbed Bucky’s hand again, pulling gently until the young man stood. Tony kissed him softly on the lips, tasting the sugar and apples from their breakfast on his sweet boy’s mouth, before using their joined fingers to pull him along to where Steve was still standing.
The boys eyes widened a bit then slowly looked Tony up and down. “Someone slip ya a micky at the gin mill, Mister? Ya in Brooklyn.” As if it was obvious. “Corner of Hicks and Clark.”
Tony could use those things himself right now. His hands left Steve’s ass as he grabbed the back of Steve’s head and pulled him in for a rough kiss. Their mouths came together harshly as he bit at Steve’s lip before pushing his tongue into the smaller man’s mouth, claiming him. Steve smelled like soap, and he tasted like the strawberry candy Tony had bought him to cheer him up. So sweet, so good.
After their quick morning meal, he kissed both Steve and Bucky before he rushed out to get started on the still long list of things he’d gotten behind on while he was on bedrest.
Bucky shook his head. “He’s been like that since me and Steve first met him, and he decided to fill our kitchen with food.”
Steve’s chase and capture of the now dead Hydra agent had probably spread through the city by now, but it was hard won. Tony closed his eyes as he remembered Steve’s screams from the vita-ray chamber. Howard had always spoken of this day as a historic one in science, but all Tony could recall was how badly he’d wanted to pull the plug. He couldn’t imagine the pain Steve had gone through. He didn’t want to.
“That guy is a disease,” Dugan grumbled as Bucky released his arm, convinced Dum-Dum wouldn’t run after the guy.
And Tony caught sight of her leaning up against a tall, young man with broad shoulders and a shit eating grin. Stupid bitch, his mind supplied. That’s when he saw Louise chatting with another guy not ten feet away from Ann the Bitch. Huh, Tony supposed “I’m going to powder my nose” was this generation’s version of “I think we should see other people”.
Steve frowned slightly because she didn’t appear to even notice Tony’s presence at his side. “We were hoping to ask someone if they knew the status or location of the 107th’s last position. A friend of ours is assigned with the unit, and we hadn’t heard anything in a long time.”
“Fair enough,” Tony conceded, “but they had it coming, Steve. I don’t regret putting those assholes in their place. No one gets away with beating on you, no one.”
Bucky tried to keep his voice light. “The 107th. Sgt. James Barnes shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.” It was a small consolation that he’d succeeded in earning the rank of sergeant after all his hard work.
The one named Steve looked sad. It didn’t know why. It answered the question the best it could. Did Steve want it to know alright? Was Steve sad it didn’t know protocol? Would it be punished if it continued to make Steve sad? No, the one named Steve said he would not punish a Bucky. Bucky’s were not punished.
After a few more tense moments, Bucky calmly stood and slowly approached him, not stopping until he was at most a foot away. Tony once again noticed how muscled his arms were and the fact that the man was an inch taller than him. Those blue-grey eyes seemed to pierce through him and see into Tony’s mind.
Tony could feel that he’d relaxed a little as he tentatively poked the tip of his tongue into Bucky, pushing past the tight outer ring of muscle and into his heated body. He slowly began a thrusting motion, each push getting him deeper into the shaking man in front of him.
Steve’s eyes widened a bit more, and Tony knew why. Steve’s father had fought in WW1. Tony knew his son had grown up believing in the honor and responsibility of serving one’s country. Tony didn’t want to lie and take credit for something as serious as pretending to be a soldier when so many people have lost their lives bravely serving, but it would explain away so much.
Thankfully his clients had been very understanding to the fact that Tony had been injured and unavailable. He still had to take it easy though. He moved a bit slower and wasn’t supposed to over-exert himself. No heavy lifting either. Tony followed these rules because he had no doubt that if he pulled open the finally sealed wound, both of those boys would force him back to bed for another three days.
“No,” Steve answered honestly, “I’m not even supposed to be here right now. Don’t know what’ll happen when we make it back to camp.”
He looked at Bucky. “It became my responsibility too when you agreed to bottom for me. That’s why I promised to take care of you.” Bucky smiled softly, Tony really had taken care of him. He always did.
Bucky was unnerved. He’d never imagined anything like what he’d just seen. Across the distance he watched as a massive tank rumbled into view. It was bigger than any he had ever seen, and it terrified him.
Steve looked confused for a moment then brightened. He got up and went to the dresser, opening the top drawer, before returning with some vaseline and a couple condoms. He put them next to Tony then moved over to kneel beside Bucky’s head.
A knock at the door tore their attention away from each other. “Who could that be this early in the mornin’?” Steve asked as he went to the door.
Tony watched his sweetheart approach him and lusted after the long, lean muscles that shifted under Bucky’s skin as he stepped in front of Tony.
Bucky, who was the only one with a mouth that was unoccupied, continued to moan and gasp as Tony reached for the little tub of lubricant. He generously coated his fingers before removing his mouth and bringing the first of them up to enter Steve.
“Anthony, you want to stay for a beer?” Tony did nothing to cover his suspicion at the request, and Howard huffed out a tired breath. “It’s not poisoned. You can even choose which bottles we’ll drink from.”
“Some manners? Tony, you…you clobbered them. I’ve never seen anyone fight like that. The things you did…”
They finally made it inside, and Tony was nearly overwhelmed as the memories of what had happened between the two men at both his sides returned. The two lovers who were leading him to the couch. The two lovers that he was in love with.
“Huh?” Tony asked distractedly from where he’d been rifling through the pages as he walked. Tony was always restless these days. “Whose day?”
They laid there together in a silence more peaceful than Steve would have believed possible before his shower. Bucky was right. Steve couldn’t keep blaming himself for the evils of the world and the tragedies he hadn’t been able to prevent. He also had to believe that Tony wouldn’t give up and would hold on long enough for them to fix this.
“Move.” Steve said against his lips as he turned them, never fully breaking the kiss, and began to walk Tony back toward the bedroom with Bucky grabbing hold of Tony’s hand to be pulled along.
Bucky moaned again, and Steve cursed slowing his hips to draw this out. When he pulled himself free, Bucky gasped around his inhale. “Please, Tony, I need…want your mouth so bad.”
“A lot of soldiers are probably not like this,” Erskine conceded, “but the men Colonel Philips brings to me here are these things.”
“Good, we’ll do that. Go take fifteen minutes to eat or whatnot, and we’ll try to go through your marks on the stage for the show.” As Steve went to turn and move away, he called out, “And, Rogers?”
“Of course, sweetheart,” Tony smiled softly, eyes crinkling, before looking to Steve. “What about you, beautiful? Anything you want to know?”
“No more than usual.” Tony wondered if Steve could hear the sullen tone in his voice. “Like I said, I get sick a lot.”
“Keeping busy.” He shrugged. It really wasn’t much. He hadn’t done anything today he couldn’t have done by the age of four. “The water heater’s fixed,” he added as he stood up and brushed the dust from his pants. “The radio and the kitchen light, too.”
Tony opened his mouth to protest, but Bucky cut him off. “Nope. No arguments. Getcha ass movin’, Stark, or you can sleep in a hospital bed.”
“Good choices, all. And I totally get that now that I know Thor. It could be his theme song. I should play it while he fights. It would go well with the lightening.” Tony mused. He turned to their silent companion and asked, “What about you, Robocop?”
As much as a part of Steve wanted to just spend the next few hours with Bucky’s head on his lap again, Steve also wanted to do something useful and help Tony.
As Bruce began adding the different types of chopped and pureed tomatoes, he asked, “How are you both feeling?”
They devolved into quips about each other’s intelligence and character soon after. Eventually, they started telling Tony more about themselves. Their lives and childhoods. It was nice.
Bucky took a ragged breath, clearly trying to get this out despite every instinct telling him be quiet. “What was wrong during dinner? You were talking about Tony, and then you couldn’t anymore. Talk to me. Please.”
Bucky had been gone eight days, and Tony and Steve both missed him terribly. There was a gaping hole where he had been in their lives, and though they knew it would take some time to adjust to his absence, it still hurt like hell. They tried not to talk about how much they missed him. Instead, they would just talk about him, wondering what he was doing and if he’d met some interesting people. They had been ecstatic when they finally got his first letter and read it together.
I had always wondered what Hydra might have done to condition certain physical responses out of their asset. I mean, Bucky is enhanced in every sense of the word, so his libido would also be effected. So, this is my answer to myself. Torture upon signs of arousal as a deterant, along with chemical castration. All in the name of turning him into a weapon whose function was to comply. I'm not a fan of HydraTrashParty. A reason for that being that, as bad as it is, it still humanizes the asset in a way. The asset is a thing. Bucky's journey with recovering his humanity is what draws me to that character, so yeah, this was my exploration of that. How certain pieces of his humanity were taken from him.
He began to work a lather across his cheeks then grabbed the straight razor (yikes) by the sink. He took a deep breath. While he’d had a shave by a straight razor before, he’d never actually used one himself. He was a little wary of the lethal looking blade. An image of Scarface flashed through his mind, and he winced. Tony didn’t want to have pull off that look.
“You might be a genius, Tony” Bucky said from the doorway across the room, “but that was the dumbest thing you’ve ever said.” He walked over to the bed before he continued, “I’m sorry that other people made you feel like that. No one deserves to feel like that, and they were missing out ‘cuz you’re a great friend to have.”
Tony shrugged. “He needed someone to help him.” It wasn’t a lie, just not the full truth. “The kid had no one. His only friend was already here fighting, and despite what people want to believe, he didn’t magically become perfect after the serum. It took weeks for him to learn how to live normally again.” Tony could have sworn he saw some guilt in the Colonel’s eyes at that. Tony continued, “I figured that I knew about the serum, and I didn’t have a job or family anyway, so I offered to help him. I didn’t care about the money because I’d had enough stashed away to get by on. I just like being useful.”
Tony looked down at his body, almost just now realizing that it was still attached to him. He wanted to groan when he saw that most of him was covered in heavy plaster casts, and all of his limbs were slung up from the bed like some medical BDSM scene gone wrong. “Fuucckk,” he cursed as he thought about how this was going to complicate everything.
Steve shook his head, smiling at Tony’s ridiculous behavior. “I am on your side, and thank god for that. Otherwise I’d be completely fucked.”
“He was kind.” Bucky said softly, deciding it was worth the discomfort to tell them about Tony in their past. He still couldn’t bring himself to look at any of them directly, but he kept speaking. “He made money, yeah, but he did a lot of work for practically nothing. He helped widows and the elderly, and he never asked them to pay him. They’d make him cookies or knit scarves or blankets. He liked helping people, taking care of them.”
. “Tony Stark is speechless.” He said as he pulled back to look up into his eyes with a playful smirk. “I thought I’d have to do a lot more before that happened,” he murmured as he moved back to kiss along Tony’s neck. His breath was hot against his skin as he spoke “and I was planning this all day. All the things I’d have to do to take you past the point of words.”
“Tony?” Louise was now talking to him. “Did you want to?” She asked, tilting her head to the dancers across the room.
The sound of their laughter was a sweet relief after the painful scene he’d come home to. As they walked out to go to the boys’ favorite pizza joint, Tony felt settled. Their revelations had soothed a lot of his worries. They honestly liked him, liked him for himself, not because he was Iron Man or the fact that was rich or famous. They wanted him around, wanted him to stay.
He flinched when he felt a hand on the center of his chest, and his eyes snapped down to meet Steve’s who quickly pulled his hand back a few inches but was still so much closer than Tony was used to.
Erskine pinched his nose, and Tony pitied the man. He looked so tired. “First, I need the data from your test, Mr. Stark. Once I have that information, I will be able to give you a final figure.”
Bucky watched as his pupils grew larger before Steve closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths. Bucky belatedly realized why Steve had reacted this way, and he immediately felt guilty for his slip. Why had he said that? He may have joked about it before with Sam, but he knew shouldn’t be reminding Steve of this now. Hell, he probably shouldn’t have even joked about it in the first place.
“You’d order for us?” Bucky looked surprised before a small smile spread across his face. “I think I’d like that. You have really good taste.”
He was still walking, calculations flying through his mind, as he tried to change the laws of physics, and he thought of Steve and James. He was nearing their neighborhood. He’d have to tell them that he’d failed. He was stuck here, and he’d have to hope they were serious in their offer to let him stay with them for a while.
Rogers had known that too when he’d shown up with his scary sidekicks. Romanoff was still the subject of debate in some parts of D.C and Capitol Hill. But Tony had that covered.
Bucky’s eyebrows scrunched up adorably as he thought for a moment before shaking his head. “No, I don’t remember that. I’ve remembered some stuff from when we were kids, but I don’t remember talkin’ bout space. Tell me about it.”
Steve was panting as Tony finally pulled back and said, “If you were wondering, you taste just the same.”
He could see how hard Bucky was trying to deal with what he remembered, the good and bad. He was trying to find something worthwhile in the horror and confusion. Bucky used to have this sense of wonder about him, all the way back to when they were kids. He’d looked forward to the future, to all of the possibilities it could bring.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Are you telling me you know someone who sells things that have, for lack of a better term, fallen off the back of a truck?”
Clint squawked, and Tony saw Steve and Bucky go wide eyed with shock. He was going to give Captain America an aneurism. They’d probably kick him out of the country for that.
“Oh, I wouldn’t presume to trouble you. We all have little ‘what if’ scenarios we play in our minds, right? Besides, we had a good dose of bonding this morning over Led Zeppelin and Harry Potter. I’m sure we’ll be best bros soon enough.”
Tony was in his element as he told outrageous stories and had Steve laughing so hard that tears were shining in his eyes. Some of the stories were from Tony’s wilder years, and others were the plots of movies that hadn’t been made yet. Steve wouldn’t know the difference.
“Hey,” Tony whispered as his hand moved to softly stroke his cheek, “I’m not going anywhere. If you think that I don’t have a plan to stay with the both of you, then you need more rest than I thought.”
Bucky opened his eyes to see warm brown ones filled with love staring back before he was gently pulled forward in a kiss. Behind him, Steve stood and grabbed towels. They all got out and dried as best they could as they kissed and rubbed against each other, slowly making their way to the bed.
Eventually, it hadn’t bothered him so much as he understood that was just the way the man was, constantly in motion with a mind that never stopped working. Over time he grew used to the fast talking genius. Bucky still didn’t talk during the maintenance. It was against protocol and usually led to punishment.
Tony and Steve had gone to see him off. They’d stood there watching as the bus disappeared from their view. A day had passed for the two of them, and Bucky was now on a boat somewhere in the Atlantic on his way to Europe. Tony hoped he wasn’t too seasick from the voyage.
Tony seemed to think over his answer before saying, “Alright, we’ve discussed how Bucky generally prefers to be submissive in sex, right? That’s what he enjoys most?”
“Kiss and tell?” Tony finished for him. “Fine. Leave the kissing out and tell us about the other stuff. Was there other stuff?” He asked, waggling his eyebrows.
“You’ll make sure I’m safe, Tony?” He’d asked as he looked up with those big blue eyes. It was a testament to how scared Steve must have been. Tony had promised to keep him safe.
Tony crawled up behind Steve. The blonde was so busy concentrating on what he was doing to Bucky that he jerked a little in surprise when Tony spread him open, that cute little ass fit perfectly under his hands as he squeezed the soft flesh. Tony leaned forward and kissed softly at Steve’s rim, his tongue leaving his mouth to give the puckered ring teasing licks.
It had taken weeks for Bucky to stop expecting it anytime someone entered the room he was currently in. Even without his memories, Bucky had been quite certain that he’d never gone so long without being punished, without going through maintenance and reconditioning. He had finally begun to trust Steve when he told Bucky that he was safe here.
Tony turned, looking confused as to why they were no longer following, but that quickly morphed to understanding. “Let’s just take the stairs. Sounds good?”
How was he supposed to answer that when there were so many possibilities running through his head at the moment? All those damn variables filling his mind with a ceaseless stream of thought. “I…”
Since Tony understood French, he didn’t need Gabe’s translation of Derneir's surprise at Bucky being able to make the walk, or his asking about the injuries Bucky had received after he’d been taken away. Bucky had needed the translation, though.
“He used to boil everything.” Bucky said without thinking, and five sets of eyes turned their gazes to him. It felt like a spotlight had fallen on his seat. Why had he said that? How had he remembered it? But as he watched Steve’s eyes sparkle in happiness at Bucky’s addition to the conversation, he decided to keep going.
two low-class, uneducated misfits. We expected you to run outta here the first chance you got, but you just kept using your money to help us here instead of finding your own place. And we were so grateful, but we just kept waiting for you to have enough. We felt like we were
“Sorry,” Steve said worriedly, “does it hurt?” Tony just shook his head, not trusting himself to speak.
Tony could readily admit to himself that his actions in having sex with Steve that first time since Rebirth had been reckless, but he hadn’t regretted it. Yes, he had been severely bruised. He
“I fail to comprehend how you can even get that fat head of yours to fit through the door!” Tony all but yelled. “You honestly can’t admit to the fact that you might be wrong and that this needs more testing!”
Bucky was a little overwhelmed at that because it made a lot of sense. He did like the freedom from responsibilty. Tony even thought he was strong to ask for it?
It was quiet for a while. None of them really knowing where to go from there until Steve timidly reached an arm out and drew him into a hug. Bucky followed almost immediately. After a moment Tony melted into them, taking in their silent comfort that was better than any words could ever be as they reassured him that he was safe. He wasn’t alone. He wasn’t being judged.
Tony heart was racing as the man’s eyes focused on him with intent. He couldn’t know. How was this possible? Erskine was a man of science from the nineteen-forties, and there was no evidence anywhere that had ever suggested that he’d known about the mystical arts.
As bad as their last altercation had been, it had also been a turning pointing for Tony and Howard. Whether it was Tony’s not so subtle threat or the colonel’s more straight forward one, the two of them had met the following morning and moved forward with their work. They didn’t mention the events of the previous night, or the fact that Howard looked like stomped on dog shit after working all night to check and correct everything for their test that morning.
He released his hold and allowed Joe to suck in a ragged breath before he drew his hand back for a punch that broke his nose. He repeated it to the side temple and knocked the jerkoff out.
“Easy, Sarge,” the man said in a hushed voice. “Just take it easy. Don’t wanna be giving the guards a reason to come over.”
Their dates had noticed their missing friend, as well, and asked if the two wouldn’t mind walking them home. Apparently, they all shared an apartment together.
Later when the robot was confronted about his lies, he was told that by trying to prevent the human’s pain, he had only caused a different pain because of his dishonesty. The story struck a nerve with Tony and made him feel incredibly guilty since he was reminded of his own lies and omissions, but he still cherished his gifts and thanked his thoughtful partners.
Erskine chuckled. “You are my proof, Tony. The only proof I need is how you react every time I mention him.”
Steve sighed, “Don’t get me started on that. His reasoning had sounded believable at time. Phillips had wanted to keep the name Stark out of reports and the news because of Howard, but now I know that Tony probably encouraged it to keep his name out of history. I don’t know if it was Phillips’ idea, but it probably was because I can’t imagine how Tony would have talked him into it on his own. Colonel Phillips only cared about what would make things go more smoothly for the SSR. He wasn’t one to hand out favors.”
Steve smiled for the first time since Tony had woken up when he heard this. “That’s true. He’s almost home. Oh God,” Steve said as his eyes went wide, “I have to go call the base and let him know. I called him when you were brought here, and he’s probably been worried sick this whole time.”
The first time Bucky had experienced combat he had not been prepared. He didn’t see how anyone could be prepared. They had been walking along a road surrounded by trees when the earth around him erupted. Two guys from his unit that had been walking in front of him were no longer there, and Bucky had tried to find cover as dirt, branches, body parts and bullets rained down on him. With a tree trunk as his cover, Bucky had taken aim and begun firing in the direction of the onslaught.
Tony’s hand was vicious as he delivered a well-placed slap to the fleshiest part of Steve’s thigh. Steve cried out as his eyes clenched shut. He was left alone to breathe through it.
“Can we please focus on the fact that Stark is in 1939 and could possibly change history?” Natasha’s voice had an edge of danger to it. “Thor, do you have anything to add on this?”
He remembered their first time together as two fumbling teenagers stroking each other off while Steve’s mom was at work. They’d been together ever since, learning each other’s bodies and supporting the other in equal measure. It had taken Bucky a long time to realize what he really wanted during sex with Steve.
He looked up from the apples and saw a young woman looking back at him. Her soft red lips turned up into a smile. Dark blonde curls fell around her shoulders, the color complimented by the green dress she wore. A dress that matched her eyes. Tony realized she’d mistaken his smirk as a friendly smile.
“Private James Morita, Captain,” the man replied. “The wounded are as stable as they can be and have been loaded into the trucks. The medics are there with them to help during transport.”
Bucky turned to look at Steve now. “As glad as I am that you came to look for me, Steve, I can’t believe you brought Tony. You know how he is about war zones.”
It just seemed so taboo, but it had turned Bucky into a desperate mess. Steve really wanted to know what that felt like. Definitely, not maybe.
He felt Steve’s fingers pause in their movements for a couple of seconds before they resumed their previous task, and he answered, “No, we don’t know, but we’re going to find him. I won’t leave him there to live without us through the decades.”
On his second trip, he brought up the presents and decorations. On his third trip, he stopped on the second floor and knocked on a door that looked identical to their own aside from the number on it. A man opened it.
“Go with your Daddy and lay down on your stomach with your arms stretched out, love,” Steve said as he moved to grab something from a bag, and that was an order he was happy to listen to.
Bucky stilled as Tony gently pushed into him, the stretch more noticeable this time around, but with the small thrusting movements he soon had both fully inside him. Tony started slowly, rotating his wrists every time he pulled out and pushed in again, increasing the pace in increments.
“It’s really not that big a deal,” Tony repeated. “I wasn’t doing anything else. I just wanted to keep busy.”
Bucky actually felt a stab of guilt as he remembered ripping off one of Sam’s wings before kicking him over the edge of the helicarrier’s deck. He wondered if he should apologize for that, or would it just be too awkward since so much time has passed? Yeah, Steve had forgiven Bucky for trying to kill him, but that was Steve.
At that thought a new wave of memories washed over him, and through some act of providence, Steve heard Tony’s voice softly singing to him as if in answer to his fears.
“He lied about who he was, why he was there.” Steve emphasized. “I realize that now, but I believed him at the time. He had helped me, and we felt bad for him, so we let him stay with us.” He looked over to Bucky. “Do you remember that?”
Bucky seemed to be forcing himself to get this out. “That’s…that’s why I talk so much during sex. If I know Steve’s listening then it’s a way to include him. When we’re together, it helps remind me that none of it mattered. We belong to each other. I don’t have to think of anything else but what he’s doin’ with me as he talks me through it. He takes care of me, and I like that.” He finished quietly.
That was good because Tony still had some things he wanted to discuss with them. He ate the last bite of his pie and put his fork down before looking across the table at them.
“He won’t be around to say anything. We both decided it would be best if he was the one to leave.” Tony said solemnly. “He packed his bags, wrote a goodbye to his wife and left his key with me to give to the landlord. It’s just as well, I was meaning to speak with him about our rent situation. I’m pretty sure I could work out a trade with our rent for doing maintenance on the building.”
When the time came for him to actually use it, hiding would no longer be an option. The biggest problem would be a power source, but he figured once the army got its head out of its ass and made Steve an actual soldier, he would be able to borrow what he needed from Howard’s lab. That was a reunion he couldn’t wait for, he thought sarcastically.
Thank you all for the amazing support! I can't believe it. And I ask for your future patience. I've worked ahead on this piece, but Chapter 9 is kicking my ass and has delayed me. I've never spent so long on a chapter. UUhhnn, frustrating.
Steve sighed then looked at him. “Sorry, Tony. I won’t have time to cook dinner and your pie. Can you manage?”
“Ah, I see the good sergeant has woken,” a man in British uniform said quietly where he sat beside Gabe. Bucky had the feeling that the man would have been soft-spoken regardless of the need. “I’m glad you seem to have recovered. Your men were quite worried for your wellbeing.”
Tony sighed and put both of his hands on Steve’s hips, squeezing gently. “You’re right. I’m not fine. I have been trying and failing to be fine, but it’s not anything you can fix,” he truthfully. “I just have to work this out, and it’s going to take time. Please, just don’t worry over it. I don’t want to be responsible for making you feel that way over something that isn’t your fault.”
Bucky’s head was thrown back against the pillow, eyes squeezed shut from the dual forms of stimulation that came from fucking Steve and being fucked by Tony. With every thrust he made the sexiest little sounds in his throat.
He saw that Steve understood his reasoning as the blonde finished removing his shoes and socks. “I didn’t think that far ahead,” he admitted. “I just wanted you to be comfortable. I’ll get you some pajamas to change into, then I’ll move the beds back apart once you’re dressed.”
Natasha nodded. “He can be an ass, no denying it, but most of that is intentional. He’s good at misdirecting and playing a role.”
Agent Carter opened her overly painted mouth to explain why it was necessary for Steve to still be a lab rat now that the procedure had worked, and they wanted to recreate it. Yeah, Tony hadn’t missed the lust on her face as Steve exited the chamber or the fact that she’d copped a feel. Tony wondered how she’d react to someone touching her chest without permission. When Tony had looked at those muscles, he'd just thought of Steve's pain.
He couldn’t think like that, though. He knew he shouldn’t. The guys who began to go down that path died from despair in their cells. He’d already seen it. The body gives up when the heart does.
It was Saturday, and Tony was walking back from the hardware store with his most recent purchase. He’d been scrounging spare parts for a couple of weeks now, and he was just about ready to begin work on his newest creation. He was going to build them a washing machine. They had them out there, but they were primitive and expensive. Tony knew his would work a hell of a lot better; he’d just needed the materials to create his masterpiece. Steve was going to shit a brick. Those hands of his should be sketching beautiful, naughty pictures, not scrubbing dirt out of their laundry.
“Roll over,” Tony said darkly as he pushed himself back to tear open the foil wrapper and roll the condom on. Tony hissed as he quickly lubed up his dick, and Steve snapped out watching him to follow his orders and roll over for him.
Bucky rubbed the back of his head, clearly thinking, before he exhaled and seemed to make up his mind. “Alright,” he said as he stepped forward and took Tony’s hand. “We’ll do this with me in the place of the gal you’re with. First dance is the foxtrot. Put this hand in the middle of my shoulder blades while I put mine on your shoulder. Hold my other hand out like this.”
Tony skidded to a halt when he turned a corner and saw Erskine hovering in the background on the opposite side of the main entrance. Between the doctor and large open doorway, Steve and Bucky stood having a not very quiet argument.
Tony cleared his throat. “Last night I spanked you without discussing it first, without asking for your permission.”
“Well, he certainly appreciates it,” Steve told him as he reached out to gently move a piece of Tony’s hair from where it had escaped the bandage that he now noticed was wrapped around his head. “He came in with you after it happened, and he’s been by to check on you since then. You probably saved his life, Tony.”
Another tower inhabitant Dr. Bruce Banner, Previous Target Status: under surveillance, Hazard Level: high – avoid contact at all cost, was at least a quiet presence here. The newly named Bucky liked quiet.
P.S. Besides the reasons he gave, I also like to think that Colonel Phillips was so keen to change Tony's name because he just hated the idea of dealing with two Starks, haha
From behind Bucky, Steve could see Tony smiling proudly at him. The brunet winked before he grabbed Bucky by the shoulder and said, “That means you’re going to follow his orders and get some sleep, too, Sergeant. I see a nice piece of ground over there that has your name on it.”
Staring at his equations and theories on the notepad Bucky had brought him, he realized that he was just doing this out of habit and desperation.
Bucky was dealing with a lot, and sex would probably not be an option for them anytime soon. These past few hours had shown an amazing change in him, but Steve knew that it was all too fragile a thing right now. Bucky was doing what he did best, trying. He knew it was a little easier for Bucky here alone with Steve than it had been at dinner with the team. He also knew that Bucky had still forced himself to find the courage to come here and try to help Steve.
He watched the groggy confusion morph into panic as they yanked their hands away from the other as if they’d been electrocuted. That panic killed Tony just a little bit more to know he’d caused it. So he did the only thing he could do, he tried to fix it.
“Quite an extraordinary man,” Monty finally said. “Alright then with your leave, Captain, we will we retire.”
Clint whined. “I can’t drink outta this, your cooties are too fresh!” Seriously, sometimes the archer acted like he was ten.
A very big basis on Tony's time travel was adapted from a B-movie I watched over ten years ago called The Sound of Thunder, or something like that. I only saw it once, but it was about the consequences of changing something in the past. The present wasn't immediately changed. Instead, the disturbance of each thing that changed sent ripples into the present throughout the movie. Each ripple caused more changes, but each change took time for it to reach the present because it affected so many other little things along the way.
“My sweet boy,” Tony panted as he picked up the pace, fucking into him harder and faster. “Both my boys laying under me, letting me take care of them. I love you so much.”
Yes, Steve thought, Tony could be scary. He could be evasive and reckless and rude, but he somehow always managed to be more than that. Tony noticed others and tried to help. That was who Tony was.
“Yes,” the doctor said, shaking his head slightly. “That was strange. For a moment it was like the Big Guy wanted out. He’s quiet now though. I probably should have had more sleep last night.”
Steve’s eyes widened. “You are?” When Tony nodded, he turned to Bucky for confirmation. “Buck, what…”
Bucky smiled softly. “We’re always gonna worry about you. I didn’t like being so far away and not be able to do anythin’, but I’m glad they were wrong. I’m so proud of you, Tony. Steve told me how you saved Joe Russo. You’re a hero.”
“Oh, it did, and I know your forged documents couldn’t have been cheap, they were well done.” Phillips continued, “Why you needed a false identity is another matter, along with why on God’s green earth you chose the last name of Stark. It isn’t low profile.”
Tony had always preferred to quietly make something amazing, then once it was perfected, bask in the attention and awe it resulted in. Yes, Tony was full of himself, but he didn’t need a ten-step program to have his ego stroked.
Tony exhaled and looked at their joined hands. What he was really seeing, Steve couldn’t guess. “I know. Of course, I know.”
“Do you still love him, Steve?” Bucky asked, needing to know for some reason. It wasn’t really his business, but he would be happy for his former partners if they found each other again. It was still strange to worry about the happiness of other people, but he knew he wanted them to be happy.
Tony shook his head before Steve had finished the question. “Hell, no. No problem.” Tony was pansexual after all, even though he couldn’t tell them that. Tolerance was one thing, but would they actually want to live with him if they knew that? “I have never judged someone based on race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. I believe in infinite diversity in infinite combinations.”
When Rogers had finally made his way down to Tony’s workshop with the former assassin on his heels, Tony had been slouched over a workbench, drooling. Rogers’s claim that Tony yelps like a five year old girl upon waking is something Tony will deny until his dying day.
Steve just shook his head and rolled his eyes, enjoying the fact that Tony at least seemed to be much better than he had been in weeks.
Tony dropped all pretense, “Please, Steve. I can’t get it out of my head. I’ve dreamt about it three nights in a row now. The first two nights I was just eating the pie. Last night, well, you probably don’t want to know. I’m pretty sure the pie was a minor even if it was consensual.”
“Actually,” Tony said, “you will find that in my contract, that was notarized and which I also have a copy, it states that upon dissolution of the contract, it would require a formal date of termination that would also have to be notarized.”
First, and most important, Tony is a man. There is no way Captain America was anything but straight. And everyone had heard the stories about what a ladies man Barnes had been. Howard had always gone on about the Captain, but he’d sometimes reminisce with a few lewd stories about Barnes and his prowess with the ladies while on leave from the front.
“The plan only half worked. There were two of us being held in the cave, but the other guy, he didn’t make it. He ended up getting killed trying to buy me some time.” Tony’s heart ached at the memory. His only friend in that hell, lying on the ground covered in dust, body riddled with bullets.
“It was a mess, Bucky. He was a mess. He’d worked so hard to make it through the program, and it nearly killed him. Then, they just turned him into a joke during one of the toughest times in his life. He was lost dealing with his new body and new job.”
Once they were finally in arms reach, Bucky dropped his duffle bag and pulled them both into a hug and squeezed. “God, I missed you both so much,” he murmured between them. Tony and Steve squeezed him back before reluctantly pulling away.
“Then we’ll all go to bed and hold each other until we fall asleep.” Bucky yawned. “It’s perfect, Stevie.”
Steve’s hands squeezed at Tony’s hips when he felt him clench around him. Tony laughed breathlessly. “You’re going to have to choose, Steve. Either lie back and let me move, or grip tighter and do it yourself.”
Steve gave a small shrug. “We think what we’ve always thought, that you’re kind and generous and want to take care of us. And we love you for it.”
Tony rolled his eyes as he picked up his own. “You know what. Now, we go get our better third and violently kill the people who took him from us. Maybe blow some stuff up along the way.”
“Yes,” he answered. “I don’t think I’d want to call you what Bucky does,” he looked at Bucky, “Not that there’s anything wrong with it.”
“Fuck, look at you.” Tony said above him. His voice was a deep growl. “That pretty pink mouth sucking at my fingers just like I told you to.” His other hand suddenly gripped Steve’s straining dick in a tight fist. Steve almost cried out but stopped himself just in time; however, he did moan around the fingers in his throat. “Good boy, listening so well and keeping your mouth closed.” Tony’s other hand was merciless as he pumped Steve. “You take orders so well, my little toy soldier.”
“I am an independent businessman under contract to this hospital, not one of its employees,” Tony cut him off, getting angry at the man’s words. “Even if I were an employee, that in no way would give you the legal authority to ignore my wishes and violate the rights I have as a patient.”
Steve laughed. “Dugan could barely speak by the time I dumped him on his bed just now. He kept muttering something about a bearded lady.”
Steve’s hands ran soothing circles across Bucky’s back as he continued. “And I’ll never have to choose between you and Tony because he loves you just as much as I do, Buck. Remember how many times he told you that? He loved making you happy. When he gets back, he’s going to do what he loves the most, take care of you. You know he wouldn’t want you to doubt that for a minute.”
Bucky stood there trembling and tear stained, and Steve didn’t know what to do. Should he try to touch him, hold him? Bucky didn’t like that, not normally, but nothing about this was normal, and he just wanted to comfort his friend.
Jagged little red and white lines streaked across his chest and down his ribs. Stretch marks from where his skin was cut and pulled tight to be tucked around the reactor. Discoloration in the center of his chest from the skin graft showed where the reactor once rested, and a long surgical scar from the procedure that removed it and the remaining shrapnel. It was still raised and purple, rough where it ran over existing scars.
“Hey, Stevie,” Bucky entered, “got a couple o’ dames lined up for a date tonight. So get out your dancing shoes.”
Steve blushed but didn’t look away, and that was promising. When he spoke, God help Tony it was in his Captain voice. “Because I want to top you. I want to know what you like and what you want, then I want to make you beg for it. I want to hear you moan and watch you squirm when I give it to you. Do you trust me to give you that?”
“This is so weird,” Clint said. “It’s like suddenly remembering something I forgot. Like I had learned about the Commandos a long time ago but had forgotten the name Anthony Sutton until just now. That's why I didn't notice at breakfast. It’s always been Captain America and his seven Commandos.”
He saw Bucky’s eyes open to look unseeingly towards the corner of the room, and Steve’s feet began moving. He had to be here for him, no matter if his friend wanted the comfort or not. Steve would always be here for him.
“So what are you doin’ today?” Bucky asked as he went to the icebox and grabbed the small bottle of milk to give to Tony.”
Then, they got off the boat, and Steve had discovered rather quickly what all that optimism had gotten him. Nothing. The soldiers that had been sent to escort them on their tour had been either indifferent or derisive to Steve when he’d tried to talk to them. He’d just wanted to thank them for guarding their group and asked if he could help in some way. They’d scoffed and told him if he really wanted to help, then he’d be wearing a
Yes, Steve said he still loved him and wanted to be with him, but that didn’t mean that they were ready for that or for the others to know about it this much. Maybe Steve had wanted it to stay a secret? Had he wanted Bucky to be a secret like they used to be? Had he just ruined this? He didn’t want to be a secret, but he didn’t want to lose Steve even more. Would Steve be mad at him?
“Do you know what this is about, Tony?” Bucky looked at him. “I know you were talkin’ to the Colonel about stuff.”
Steve huffed and nodded. “It’s just that when I was thinkin’ of the things Tony did to you, and how much you liked them, I started to wonder what it would feel like too.”
“OH, Fuck yes!” Tony gasped as his hands scratched at Steve’s chest to steady himself. The sweet burn of those nails digging into his skin spurred Steve on further.
As he saw Steve searching his face and watched as the blonde’s pulse slowed, Tony already knew that Steve wouldn’t believe him. It wasn’t in his nature, not yet. Steve was still too innocent. He stubbornly clung to those hopeful ideals when it came to the things he really cared about. Steve was the kind of man that learned his lessons the painful way most of time. Steve needed to be proven wrong before he accepted another way of thinking.
“Well, that was certainly an experience,” Tony said as they entered their room. “I thought I could drink back in the day, but some of those guys could put me to shame.”
Tony went to the kitchen and got himself a glass of tap water. He was already getting used to the taste, though it had turned his stomach a little when he heard Bucky call  it “dog soup”. Really some of the phrases they used this day in age were weird. He was rinsing his glass when the radio was once again filled with static. It had been doing that all morning.
“Everything about our lives is dangerous, doll. Besides,” Bucky added, “you’re the man with a plan. Don’t you want to plan something nice for him?”
My great-uncle was fortunate enough to survive Pearl Harbor, and his tour of fighting in WW2. He was an amazing man who sadly passed away a few years ago. But what a life he lived.
Bucky felt himself melting as every sore and tight muscle he had was massaged. Every knot of tension was being undone in his back and shoulders. Four hands moved slowly over his skin. Two traveled higher over his shoulders and along his arms, even gently kneading the palms of his hands and tending to his fingers. The other two traveled lower over his rear muscles, the backs of his thighs and calves and feet. From head to toe their hands worshipped, and their soft voices never ceased to praise him.
“You’re a bit of danger whore, aren’t you? You crave this.” Steve said around his breaths as used his grip to pull Tony’s body to meet his next thrust.
“It’s the designer.” Was Tony really having this conversation? “He’s not well known right now,” because he’s about five years old, Tony thought, “but I’m sure in a few (thirty-five) years, he’ll be in high demand.”
The Private looked surprised to be called by his name instead of his rank, but he saluted all the same before he left.
What the hell was wrong with him? With his body? It was like he’d gotten a dose of the super-serum with how quickly he now knew he could heal. A large cut and severe burn hardly leaving a scar was one thing. Not appearing to age was another thing. This however, this was a whole different level of wrongness that was threatening to send Tony into a panic.
Tony smiled and began their steps again. Following Bucky as he’d gently pull to indicate where and how to effortlessly move his partner to keep the steps smooth. They worked  on it for several minutes. Steve would make comments and crack jokes at both their expenses, but Tony was genuinely having fun.
“You said that I can’t keep taking the blame away from the things you’ve done, and you are right to an extent. But please, Bucky, please stop blaming yourself for the things done to you because you are not to blame for that. It is not your fault that you are living with trauma. It is their fault, and the only real way to beat them is to allow yourself time to heal.”
Thor turned back to answer him. “Whoever did this to Stark was both powerful and cruel. They marked you, and most likely Barnes as well, to pull Stark through time to you. For whatever reason, you are the focus of this spell. He is locked there, bound to you by this magic.”
That really worked for Steve because he had gotten to watch and enjoy the show even more than he would have if he’d been the one orchestrating everything. As he’d looked on to Tony with Bucky, he realized that he
“Eccelente!” Martinelli exclaimed as Steve and Bucky took their seats. “A celebration! Congratulations, Mr. Barnes.”
“You remember a couple of weeks ago when I had that big job in Queens?” He asked, and they nodded. “You remember when I came home that evening and told you all about it, and what had happened after?”
“I’m a genius,” he said honestly. “I don’t mean that in a bragging sort of way, just the literal having an intelligence level so high it’s genius kind of way, but I made some bad choices, trusted the wrong people, and it cost me everything. I tried to start over, and I chose Stark as a joke to myself. To remind me that even though I’d lost everything, I still had my mind. Everyone thinks of brilliance when they hear the name Stark. I’m well educated, but I’ve always tried to learn more. I speak eight languages.”
The men just huffed in equal parts nerves and amazement. Morita finally asked, “Do you have anything else you needed done, Captain?”
“Same game,” Tony replied after a drink of his wine. “I’m gonna beat you, Rogers. So help me God, you can’t win them all.”
Steve had apologized to him that they would have to wait a little longer to start asking around for news about the 107th but promised they would start right after the show. Tony just nodded his head and ignored everything around him.
Thor turned to him angrily. “I merely confirmed my suspicions. This is no simple spell! This is not a glamour or a trick, Wilson. This is powerful and ancient magic. Magic that has pierced through the veil of time in this dimension to specifically place Stark in the lives of Steven and James. I can feel it within the Captain; even after so many years, the bonding mark is still there.”
“A collection of Disney short films, I think.” Tony answered. “I saw some of the posters had Donald Duck.”
Bucky’s eyes opened at the throb he felt between his legs, and he looked down. Through his leathers he could see the outline that proved he was aroused, and he stared at it. Up until now every memory he had of sex with Steve and Tony had effected Bucky because of the emotions it brought to him, from the safety and care to the love that had filled him. He had enjoyed remembering the pleasure, obviously, but that had been because it was so much better than what Bucky had felt before.
He reached his hand up to rub a thumb over Steve’s high cheekbone. “You can have all my days, baby. Every day and every night belongs to you, just say the word.”
He felt Steve’s arms tighten around him as Steve shook against him and choked out a sob, “Don’t. Don’t do that, love. It wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault. God, I…I love you so much. I’m here for you now. I’ll take care of you. I promise, Bucky. I’m just so…,” Steve’s voice broke, “I can’t believe I get to hold you again. I missed you. I missed you so much.”
They began to walk to their usual private room in the back. “There’s nothing to forgive, mio amico. You have good reason to worry. How is your brother? Have you heard from him again?”
He quickly shifted his stance as the other three rushed at him. Tony ducked low and rolled to the side, getting behind one of them. Jumping up he delivered two quick kidney jabs.
They stayed like that for a long time. Each of them crying and supporting the other’s weight. Steve relished the feel of Bucky touching him, one warm flesh arm and one cool metal wrapped around his waist as he breathed in the scent of his hair where his head rested against Steve’s shoulder and neck.
“Can I tell you a secret, Buck?” Steve asked him. “I miss the little me, too, sometimes. I don’t miss being sick and made fun of, but I miss being…me and not a symbol. Sometimes I hate the way people look at me because all they see is what the serum gave me. Tony never did that in the past. He always looked at and treated me the same.”
“You don’t understand,” Tony said desperately as he motioned to his scarred chest. “This was the price I paid for who I am. Truth is that I was broken long before I was damaged, and everyone knew it.” He practically clawed at the mass of scars. “I
“So glad to be home,” Bucky told them as he pushed back the brim of his hat to see them better. He reached out a hand as if to touch Tony’s face but thought better of it at the last minute, and it landed on his shoulder. “I was so worried about you, honey. Thank God you’re alright,” he said as his eyes were taking in the almost healed bruising on Tony’s temple and cheek. Tony knew his beard was probably hiding more of the greenish bruises along his jaw.
“And I’m glad you liked it,” Tony assured him, “but I still shouldn’t have done that without your consent. Impact play, however light, should be discussed before it happens, even if you just yell out ‘smack my ass’ during random sex between strangers.”
Tony shook his head. “You don’t get it. I’m still that man. I’m just trying to survive. Everything I’ve done has been to escape the fear, to make sure I’m never hurt and scared like that again. I’m just trying to survive.”
Tony nodded. “Yes, some people call it play, hence the term roleplay, but that is an even broader umbrella term that we can discuss later.”
He tossed the towel into the hamper across the room and went to grab the dirtied sheet. He wadded up the half that was unoccupied, “Move over here, sweetheart.” Bucky moved over the crumpled mess of sheet to the clean half of the bed, and Tony pulled the remaining portion away to place it in the hamper as well.
He finally asked, “Any of you guys smoke? I’ve got enough to share.” Steve smiled at the look of surprised disbelief on the faces of the soldiers before one by one, they all gratefully accepted a cigarette, all except the one Tony had lashed out at.
do it. It shouldn’t take you more than eight or ten hours to go through the calculations by yourself, determine if the wires can handle the current and readjust the resistor to the exact specifications needed to make the machine safe and functional. If you’re as smart as you say, it should be finished by the time I get here tomorrow morning, right?”
“Sorry.” He said again, hiding his face in his hands, because what else could he say? Steve was supposed to be resting, not dealing with Tony’s mental problems.
Tony gently pulled the hand from Steve’s grasp. “You go on. I’ll be there in a minute,” he said with a numbness that matched his hand, “I need another cigarette.”
a hero, Buck. You’ve always been my hero. I don’t want anything more than you’re willing to give me, but I will take everything you have to offer. Yes, I want Tony back, and of course he would make me happy, but that doesn’t change the fact that I need you too. Can you…do you still want to be with me? Us?”
Not that he’d noticed at the time because damn, he was too busy enjoying the ride. Endorphins were fun like that.
“So Buck,” he started, “Last night, it was good?” God, that sounded awful. “I mean, you enjoyed it? With Tony?”
He watched as Steve’s eyes grew wet, and he felt his hands move to cup Bucky’s face in his palms. “Is that what you think, Buck? Is that what you think I see when I look at you? A damaged murderer?”
Tony was pulled out of his thoughts as the bus pulled to a stop in the station and soldiers began filing out, desperate to reunite with their loved ones. Tony’s stomach felt empty and warm at the same time.
The men around him echoed that sentiment and their thanks, and Steve began to wonder what really would happen when they returned. He looked at Bucky and saw him looking back, and Steve realized he didn’t care what happened. Whatever it was, it would be worth it. Bucky and all these men were free. That was what mattered.
“Been lying down for days, Steve.” Bucky said as he looked up, and Steve could see he was trying to appear better than he was. Steve suspected it was because of Bucky’s friends being worried about him. He didn’t want to appear weak.
As the door flew open and air rushed in, Carter yelled, “Get back here! We’re taking you all the way in!”
Erskine looked at him with that piercing stare, and Tony could see the man weighing out the risks and reasons in his head. He felt like his heart was going to beat out of his chest. This was it, no going back. Tony was jumping in feet first to keep what was his.
“Yes, you’re lucky to be alive,” Dr. Abrams told him, and Tony could see the scrutinizing look in his eyes. “Many of the witnesses to the accident believed you had been killed. To be honest all of us had doubts when you were brought in, but despite the severity of your injuries, your heart was beating so strongly it was like nothing had happened to you.”
Steve came hard at the feeling of Tony’s teeth sinking into him. He felt himself clench around Tony’s fingers as his dick spurted onto his stomach and Tony’s other hand. He could hear his blood rushing in his ears and feel his heart hammering against his chest as his body was flooded with pleasure. Distantly, his mind reminded him that this was just the beginning.
After a few more slow thrusts, Steve groaned in a raw voice beneath him, “Fuck, Please…please fuck me…I need it…I need…”
“Passed?” Steve asked in confusion before the full meaning of Thor’s words hit him. “You mean die? Until me and Bucky die?”
“I see your point,” Erskine nodded before he sighed. “Perhaps it is the scientist in me that hates not knowing.”
Tony started singing. It was a song he’d heard a lot on the radio these past few weeks. It had stuck in his mind to the point where he was often humming it or singing it to himself.
He relished in the scrape of the other man’s nails against his neck as his tongue was overpowered by Steve’s. He was a hell of a kisser. He felt Bucky slide up against him and start kissing up the other side of his neck. He was surrounded by them; both of their mouths on him, and the thought was intoxicating.
Tony had woken the next morning before the sun had risen. He was still tired, but he knew there was no way he’d be able to go back to sleep. It hadn’t been a dream. He was still here on Steve and James’s old, worn sofa. Apparently, this wasn’t a spell that broke at midnight, and he doubted that Glenda the good witch was gonna show up anytime soon with a pair of sparkly red heels for him to use to get home. And that was a shame, he looked good in red.
Bucky nodded and seemed to force himself to meet Bruce’s face. “The same as Steve says,” he answered. “I can remember things when I try to, but I’m not forced to relive them as I’m getting the memory. Some things have begun to remind me of events in the past since we met Tony. It’s…I kinda like it.”
Tony walked quickly down the sidewalk as he hurried to get home. He was running late, much later than he’d planned on being. He’d wanted to do something special tonight to celebrate their new relationship, and he was already fucking up.
“You’re not proving much to me if I do all the work.” Tony said as he swatted the ass in front of him and brought his hips directly behind Steve’s again, letting the tip of his cock lightly rub against the reddened opening. “Go ahead, soldier, earn my dick.”
Avenue in Queens. He’d been found by Mr. Akerman, a local businessman who was the largest ice manufacturer in the borough and surrounding areas. His largest production machine was breaking down, and it was affecting his profits as well as the fact that he really couldn’t meet the demands of supplying his clients.
“Well,” Howard chuckled in an almost friendly way, “not everyone’s cut out for these kind of things, but I hear that you do good work over in your corner of Brooklyn.”
“It’s the hill I’ll die on,” Steve agreed. “It hurt him. I know it did when I said he wasn’t a hero.”
“Are you jokin’? They’re gonna go crazy over 'em. I can’t believe you made those little robots, just like the ones in the department store.” Michael marveled.
He’d then spent seven of those dollars on some second hand period appropriate clothes in the store, but he was still going back to the apartment with a respectable thirty-eight dollars. Not too shabby considering he didn’t have a penny to his name when he’d woken up that morning.
The other two men trailed out behind her to the elevator. Just as they were about to get on, Bucky called out, “Clint!” The archer turned to look at him, slightly wary. “I’m sorry about your phone.”
Steve looked up at them as they approached the table. “It’s a little warm in here,” Tony huffed as he sat down. “Too much for an old man’s heart. I wish they had some windows open. The December air would probably feel wonderful.” He gave as an excuse for their early return.
Steve knew Bucky was upset. Having his mind and memory affected like this had to be unsettling after everything Hydra had put him through. Not to mention the pain that it had caused when it began. Steve wondered if it had reminded him of the chair, but Steve knew he wouldn’t have the nerve to ask about it.
Bucky mumbled something, presumably against Steve’s skin before he said more clearly, “I know, doll. That’s why I was so loud with Marie that night. I wanted you to hear. Did you get hard Stevie? Were you thinkin’ of me touchin’ you? Kissing you? Doing it just like you tell me to.”
“I’m gonna call bullshit on that one.” It was Bucky’s turn to talk, apparently. “You looked like you were fighting for your life.”
Bucky’s smile had faded once Sam had begun talking, but he still managed to get out, “Thanks, I guess.”
Bucky stood before the metal door of the lab. He didn’t know why he kept returning here, but he did. He knew Tony wasn’t in there. Still, it was the place he felt closest to him. It was where he’d spent the most time with the man before all of this started, and his memories were strongest here. Even though the man owned the whole building, nothing was more sacred to Tony than this space. It usually took something important to make him leave his sanctuary, that or Steve forcing him to leave so he could eat and sleep. Bucky smiled at that thought.
Steve watched as the whole team was gathered in this medical suite, waiting to hear just what had gone wrong with two of their teammates and if it was connected to their missing third.
“Come on, Abrams, it couldn’t have been that bad. Look at me. I’m fine.” Tony tried to bluff his way through this. Maybe if he spun it the right way, he could get them to doubt their previous diagnosis’s on his injuries. Probably not, but he had to try. “Was all the plaster really necessary?” The casts probably added at least eighty pounds to him, and he was grateful for the slings holding their weight, even if it was damn inconvenient.
Bucky felt himself smile for the first time in days as his eyes grew wet. “I…you’re here. Steve. Tony.”
Tony thought on that before saying, “Do you promise not to tell the Captain or anyone else why I had to change it?”
“The depression won’t come back, then?” Steve asked tentatively, and Tony was reminded at how hard those years had been for him and everyone else in this country that the man was so scared of it returning. Tony had arrived at the end of it when America was just beginning to recover, but the truth was that most of the thirties had left a large scar across the nation.
It came alive for him. Lights and the sounds of robots all greeting him. Bucky really liked it here.
You stood against four men to defend Steve when you didn’t even know him, and you think you’re a coward? You’ve done more for us than I can even…and you act like it’s nothing. Like it’s no big deal that you’ve made our lives better, so many people’s lives. You’re brilliant, and instead of trying to nickel and dime everyone to get rich, you work for
Bucky’s hips jerked as he groaned around Steve again. Tony just continued his movements with his mouth while making gentle circles on the sensitive skin.
It was nice sharing warmth this way. Tony hadn’t slept next to anyone since Pepper, and while this wasn’t the same, it was comforting. He wondered if Steve or Bucky was all that comfortable with Tony being in bed with them. They’d grown up together, knew everything about the other. It was familiar. Tony was not. But the two men didn’t say anything, their breathing slow and steady.
“I’ll give you what I want to, when I want to.” Steve answered in a hard tone. He grabbed Tony’s thighs and pushed them up to spread him even wider. “Hold these, love.”
Steve loved getting to physically unleash now that he knew Tony wouldn’t be seriously harmed from it. The bruises on Tony’s skin had also lessened in severity as Steve’s control had grown, but Tony treasured each and every one he did receive. To everyone else Tony was Captain Roger’s very capable and commanding assistant, but beneath his clothes those marks proved that Tony was so much more than that.
So Tony tried. Within a few days, he was able to cover his emotions and fake that he was better. He would listen to the news with them without having another breakdown. He would go to work and talk with people before coming home to help Steve in the kitchen. He would let Bucky pull him up from the couch to dance with him in front of the radio in their living room. When the song was over, Tony had to make himself let go of Bucky.
Yes, Tony lied, but only about himself. Bucky had seen it more times than he could count these past three years. It’s like a mask would slide down over his face, covering everything except what he allowed you to see. Maybe Bucky was right about Tony being an actor. He hid his emotions in the role he was playing and spoke his lines as the scene required, especially when hiding his truth.
“I guess we should be grateful for it,” Bucky concluded. “I’m not…I wish I couldn’t remember some of the stuff I have, but if it’s all or nothing, well I’m gonna try to focus on the memories that make me happy. I can’t promise a miracle, Steve, but I’m gonna try. Those memories with you and Tony are worth it. What I have with you now is worth it, and maybe they can help remind me that I used to think I was worth it too.”
“This ain’t none o’ your business, Mister. Why don’t you get the fuck outta here?” Joe the Cro-Magnon sneered.
Tony acted so fast it was over in moments. His left hand grabbed the arm that was still grasping at his hand on Joe's throat. He stretched it out all the way out to the side and whipped his right hand palm out to strike the center of the forearm as he pulled the limb towards him. The crack was loud in the space around them. Tony dropped the arm as his hands flew back to restrain Joe, one on his throat and the other over his mouth to silence his yell.
With those words something hopeful in Bucky surrendered, and he closed the distance between them. When his lips met Steve’s, it was gentle and chaste. He almost felt awkward at the attempt when they didn’t line up properly at first because he remembered being better at this. It was still really nice and so very comforting. He marveled at how such a little thing could calm him.
Tony slowly drug his hips back. As Steve moaned, Tony pulled his arms just a bit further to keep him from moving his hips to meet Tony’s. “Let’s see how much you can take?” He asked huskily before snapping his hips forward.
“Think carefully, Byrne.” Tony said as he threw the man’s hurtful words back at him. “One way or another, you will be leaving. I will be staying right here, surrounded by my large group of friends and those two boys that I am fiercely protective over.”
Sam went over to stand next to him as Natasha entered the kitchen. “Good morning, everyone.” She said as she smoothly moved over to the table and took her seat.
Tony had come to realize and accept some things these past three days as he was stuck in bed. He’d been repressing a lot, even before he’d arrived here, but since then Tony had been walking a very fine line with those boys leading him the whole way.
“The future,” Bucky answered as he handed Steve the paper, but he still caught the shadow that passed over Tony’s face as he said it.
“I’m sure he regretted it, too,” Bucky said. “Tony’s not mean because he enjoys it.” He looked thoughtful for moment. “It’s almost funny now. How many people can say they’ve had two first meetings?”
He’s sure that liking to watch other people had to be something that some people enjoyed, like the best kind of movie, only he got to be in the movie too.
He continued on his way, going to the very back of the lab. Bucky laid on the little couch that was squeezed between two hardware shelves. DUM-E came up to him holding a blanket, and he grabbed it before patting the little bot on its arm. He snuggled his face against the soft material and breathed deep. Tony. If he closed his eyes, it was almost like he was lying next to him.
James chuckled, not looking up from his sock. “Just show him Stevie. You ain’t got nothin’ to be ashamed of.”
I also enlightened him that just because I might not be an influential person, it didn’t mean that I don’t know several people who
“So strong,” Steve repeated Bucky’s words as he started moving his hips faster. “And I love that I get to do this to you. You’d let down your walls for me and be used by me. You’d do this only for me.”
Hoping that Steve had just decided to walk his date home early, the two of them obliged and held there arms out for the girls to take. It wasn’t a long walk, just three blocks. They each kissed their date softly on the cheek and bid them good night and happy new year.
Heat flashed through Tony as he apparently found a new kink. Though he supposed this kink was Bucky specific. “Fuck, you’re going to kill me, sweetheart,” he said as he grabbed both cheeks of Bucky’s ass and spread them, leaning close he breathed on the twitching hole. He stuck out his tongue and licked a stripe across the muscled opening.
Bucky stopped that thought. He couldn’t finish. It was not helpful. He should focus on what he could do. After all, he’d stepped up and helped Steve tonight, and that mission had been a success. Now it was time to help Tony. He’d step out of his comfort zone a little more with the team after breakfast. He knew it was probably killing Steve that he wasn’t actively helping with the search for a way to save Tony. Bucky was already beginning to feel anxious about it, so he knew it would be worse for Steve.
Steve blushed and kissed him back. “I, uh, I kinda enjoyed watching you with him,” he mumbled, “but we could try some other things too. That thing you did to Bucky with your tongue…”
Steve was always so kind and indulged Bucky in what he asked for. Bucky liked the way Steve claimed him, told him what to do, embarrassed him a little. And wasn’t that fucked up? What kind of man would get off on that?
It was early evening on a Sunday in the first week of December as Tony walked along the sidewalk. The chill of the air was getting cooler as the sun continued to sink. He was returning home with a box of ornaments for the Christmas tree they’d gotten that morning. This year he’d decided that they needed new ornaments to add to their usual tinsel and garland. It was their third Christmas together, after all.
Tony’s voice had gotten progressively quieter as he’d finished, and Bucky recognized it. Tony was feeling insecure with their silence. Bucky could practically hear the man internally berating himself over this, and he wanted to reassure him. Tony didn’t understand that what he was offering was practically unheard of, and the men were speechless because of it.
Bucky laughed, but the light blush on his cheeks betrayed him. “C’mon, let’s go home. I don’t know when I’ll get my papers to ship out, but I plan on enjoying every minute with you two that I can get.”
He burst through the door and saw both of them sitting side by side on the floor in front of the radio. Their heads were bowed, and they were holding each other. “Boys…” He choked as they lifted their heads to look at him.
“Ours.” Steve finished for him because that was the truth. Tony had walked into their lives and into their hearts. His sharp mind and quick wit were disarming. His humor and charm drew people to him. He was kind and generous and handsome.
Bucky had been sitting beside the radio, reading the paper for any job listings, when Tony approached him.
With tears in her eyes, she’d hugged him tightly and made him promise to look after himself and Steve. It had been an easy promise to make.
Bucky was still moaning into his arms from Steve’s actions prepping him. “Please, please, I’m ready. Please,” he begged as Tony watched Steve’s arm move as it opened him.
It turns out that nanotechnology wasn’t easy to transfer and manipulate with basic tools from the 1940s. He couldn’t rely on the watch itself because it had been glitchy ever since he’d been hit by that delivery truck. Go figure. His glasses could diagnose the problems, but they couldn’t repair the damage. Now, it was just a fancy looking wrist piece with a cracked glass face. At least his glasses had miraculously survived.
“You feel so good around me, sweetie,” Daddy groaned near his lips. His breath filled Bucky’s lungs and became his own as his hips ground deeper into him. “So good. So sweet and tight.”
The newly named Bucky did not like it here. The tower was large with multiple points of entry. The inhabitants were strange and off-putting. Their ceaseless talking grated its nerves. So much of what was said was irrelevant.
After a few more minutes, Steve’s hips were getting clumsy before finally losing rhythm and settled on grinding against Tony to stretch him even more. “Please…” he moaned, and Tony’s control snapped.
But he knows that he could have. Tony would do whatever he had to if it meant protecting them. The scary thing was that he was smart enough to get away with it, especially in this time period.
Bucky had never been angry with Tony before, but when he saw the man do something so reckless, he wanted to rage. Those guys were dangerous. How could he do that? What was he thinking?
“Augsburg?” He continued, never letting his mask slip to show his reaction. “I’ve never been there, but I’ve seen pictures. It’s beautiful, so many styles of architecture and historical landmarks.”
I know everyone is prepared for heartbreak, and there is of course some angsty moments, but I'd like to think there is an equal amount of good times to be had in this chapter. Hope you guys enjoy because the war truly begins for everyone next chapter.
“It’s fine.” Tony assured him as he stood and took a step back. “You may be right about the bed though. I’ll start looking at getting something small that could fit beside yours tomorrow.” He placated, knowing he would drag that out for as long as he could because right now he couldn’t even think about sleeping in the same room as them if he didn’t have to.
“I have a heart condition,” Steve explained. Ok, perhaps the outrage hadn’t been as internal as Tony had hoped. “I really shouldn’t have that much caffeine.”
“Si!” The good natured man nodded as he pulled away. “A surprise dinner before James goes to learn to fight the bastard Nazis and that fascista pezzo di merda that has ruined my beloved Italia. Mussolini,” he made a spitting motion to the side, “to believe he has done this to my home country.”
And they were dancing. Tony was doing the foxtrot, and it was fun. Hell, it was almost easy, of course most of the credit went to Bucky. The man was a damn talented dancer. They stepped and swayed together. Tony would spin Bucky out and reel him back in. He held him tighter as he quickly dipped the other man’s head back before snapping him up to meet his eyes. Bucky was smiling, and Tony realized he was too.
Steve had jumped to his knees and bent him in half, knowing full well that Tony’s prostate was about to get hit with every snap of Steve’s hips. Tony began babbling as Steve pounded into him. Little words and phrases like “fuck me” and “feel” and “god, please” and “so good” fell from his lips. The whole while Tony seemed to be trying his hardest to keep looking into Steve’s eyes, as if to let him know that he was OK and was still here with him.
Steve laughed as he peeled potatoes at the kitchen table. “That has to be lousiest made up reason to get me to bake a pie I’ve ever heard.”
Most of his vehicles were sleek and new. This thing roared with power, not inherently flashy but still demanding attention. Well, if he had to sit in traffic, he may as well look cool doing it. Pepper said he was having a midlife crisis. Tony hoped that wasn’t true because that would be his fourth one according to her.
“In here!” He called back through the screwdriver in his teeth. He saw Steve out the corner of his eye and looked up to see a surprised face staring down. Removing the tool from his mouth, he asked, “How’d it go?”
I'm glad you all decided to stick around. General consensus was that I am brilliant but evil. Hell, I'll gladly take it, LOL!
Steve actually smirked. “I’ve had to listen to stories about him and the dames he dates since I was thirteen. They have only gotten dirtier as we’ve grown older.”
“You can’t keep paying for my doctor’s bills, Tony,” Steve was shaking his head, building himself up to argue, “not on top of everything else.”
This position really only worked because Steve was so small, but Tony loved it. He got to see both of their faces as he fucked Bucky. “Fuck yourself on him, baby. Take him all the way down.”
“I think Stark is totally fucked.” Bucky said bluntly, his voice so different from how it was long ago when he’d been Steve’s Bucky. “We have no leads on where he is, or what the hell actually happened here. That Strange guy isn’t here to help or give us answers. The only reason for hope at all is that there wasn’t a corpse laid out next to that phone.”
“You were already up!” Bucky snapped. “And making yourself a sandwich. One more wouldn’t have killed you.”
“At ease,” Tony said before he slapped Steve’s ass to make him be still. “You’re gonna kill me.” He laid Steve out on the bed and climbed on top of him. Tony’s arm moved off to the side, disappearing under his pillow before returning with a condom and small tin of Vaseline.
Natasha, in particular, was a very unforgiving teacher. She didn’t pull punches and believed the best incentive for learning was the desire to avoid pain. She wasn’t wrong.
“We’re not there yet,” Steve said. “We’re not there in our memories. We’d just gotten equipped at SSR headquarters and were getting ready to leave London to go back to the front. This looks just like that film at the Smithsonian exhibit. JARVIS, when did this change happen to the original footage?”
“Yes,” Steve smiled before looking at Tony more seriously. “I don’t want gold or the earth itself, but I will take one day.”
“Look how wet you’ve made yourself.” Tony squeezed just enough on his soft cock to make Steve choke.
Steve jumped in. Repeating how Tony’s father was an inventor, (“And an asshole,” Tony interjected to Bucky’s amusement.) and that he’d learned as a child.
They just kept thanking him, not really believing that he would have gone through all this trouble over them. It made Tony’s heart swell at their happiness, but ache at the same time to think of how little kindness their lives had given them if a few modest gifts meant so much.
Tony heartily agreed, visions of him teaching that asshole a very violent lesson danced through his mind.
Sorry for the wait everyone. The day after my last post, I was in a pretty bad car accident that totaled my vehicle. Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, but I was a walking bruise for the rest of the week. (I still kind of am in some places) Hope you can understand that I took the rest of the week off to heal and get my head right. Thankfully, this chapter didn't require too much from me so I was able to work on it the past few days. It sets some things up that I am excited to get to, but I think it still has it's moments. Love you all, and thanks for all your patience.
So that happened. Tony finally let himself feel the weight of his emotions. It's a good thing Steve and Bucky had his back; however he still has miles to go. Tony's life philosophy is emotional repression, but don't worry, we'll soon be back to the fluff. And dare I say a dash of smut?
“Sorry,” Tony said dumbly. His eyelids felt like they were made of lead as he blinked, trying to focus on his partner. He swallowed thickly and finally croaked, “What happened?”
Steve, eyes closed, managed a deeper breath and held it before slowly letting it out. He opened his eyes and looked straight into Tony’s. They were unsettled but clear, and he was still pale but not like he’d been when he’d stumbled into the apartment. “Thank you. Both of you.”
Tony woke slowly. He could sense light behind his eyelids, but that wasn’t what woke him. A dull throbbing ache in his head was battling for supremacy with the burning pain in his stomach.
Steve looked to the others and saw that they were all nodding in agreement. “Okay. I’ve got the meat and spices already mixed in that bowl if Sam and Clint want to roll them into the meatballs. Bruce if you don’t mind handling the sauce, I’ve got everything measured out next to the pot. You can add them together and put on the heat, stirring occasionally. Natasha,” he turned to look at her, “you can cook down the veggies in a separate pan before we add it to the tomato sauce. Just don’t rinse it out. I want to use the flavored oil at the bottom to cook the meatballs in.”
Steve sighed. He couldn’t do this. Bucky needed him to be strong right now. Tony needed him to be strong right now. Whining and crying over things he couldn’t do anything about would not help anyone.
“No, sir. It’s been hard for everyone.” Steve answered looking hurt. As if he needed reminding that the country was nearly destroyed by poverty just a few years ago.
“Boys?” He asked as his blood started to pump a little faster. Bucky was biting that plush bottom lip of his while Steve just looked at him with heated eyes and a smirk.
It had only been the next morning when he’d felt the lingering soreness and tried to diagnose what his body was recovering from. And recover it did. It was why he’d taken the risk in the first place. If he could survive getting hit by a multi-ton vehicle, he could survive a round of rough sex with his enhanced lover. He’d survived many more rounds since then, too.
Their trip back to the apartment was filled with happy conversation on the dinner they’d just eaten. When they’d finally arrived back home, Steve and Bucky turned to him once the door was closed.
“The way I was raised,” Tony began, “it didn’t afford me the luxury of dealing with those things. I was supposed to be above that. There was a high standard that I had to uphold.”
Whether it was the pranks they played on each other (and him) or the jokes and teasing they constantly hurled at one another or even when they’d bicker like an old married couple, it was never dull. Bucky was home during most of the day now when he wasn’t looking for a new job. Tony had told him there was no pressure, and he shouldn’t take the first thing he found out of desperation. He should like whatever job he got. Bucky had a lot of useful skills.
Bucky nodded obediently as he grabbed Tony’s fully hard dick, then without any buildup or teasing he swallowed him whole. Tony cried out at the sudden sensation of tight, wet heat engulfing him. He’d watched Bucky do this to Steve, and it was even better than he’d thought it would be. Bucky didn’t seem to have a gag reflex as he swallowed around the head of Tony’s cock again and again. His sweet boy was just naturally gifted.
“Usually,” Tony corrected again, “but I have kissed every inch of you. Now there’s just a few more inches. Speaking of inches,” Tony said as he lightly wrapped his hand around Steve’s cock and made him gasp.
Bucky bit into his waffles with enthusiasm, savoring the way the syrup and butter filled every blueberry-flavored square.
He gently ran his hand down Bucky’s spine and felt him relax and lean into the touch before turning to look at him. His beautiful eyes were filled with something that hadn’t existed yesterday, hope and love, and Steve knew he could do this. He would focus on supporting and loving Bucky as he hoped that the rest of team found a way to help Tony.
Tony was sore and getting the shirt on took more effort than usual, but he did it. He touched Bucky’s back to signal he was finished. The younger man just turned around and led him to the bed. Steve came back as he was settling under the covers and handed him a glass of water and some pain relievers.
“I’m alright, sweetie,” Tony assured him. “I had to get better for when you got back. Steve and I have big plans for your homecoming.”
Steve had caught him sometimes mumbling under his breath, hearing Bucky’s name more than a few times, as he’d absentmindedly rubbed at the middle of his chest. When Steve had asked him about it, all the other man would say was that he didn’t like the open water. More lies. Steve loved Tony, he did, but being shut out hurt sometimes and frustrated him most of the time. If Tony was worried, Steve wished he would talk about it.
“That’s right. It’s a bit different here, and I’ve never been very good at making new friends. Wouldn’t even know where to start.” Tony knew that he probably seemed like hermit, only leaving the apartment when he had to, but the less he interacted with people, the less chance he had of doing something inappropriate. He didn’t want to draw too much attention to himself.
“It wasn’t my fault,” Steve huffed, pulling his face from James’s grip. “Joe Collins was running his mouth about Margaret Murphy. You
“He said something like my ma probably died of shame ‘cause her son was diseased.” Bucky hissed at this. “He could see how angry I was getting. He told me to try something. He’d love to finish the beating he still owes me, and that there wasn’t some creepy drifter to save me this time.” Steve wouldn’t meet Tony’s eyes. “He said it was messed up that Tony was staying with us, and how I probably…”
. They were going to Europe. He thought of Bucky. They hadn’t received more than two letters since he’d been gone, and they had no way of knowing if Bucky was receiving the letters they’d written him. It was unsettling. Was Bucky alright? Was he still free and fighting, or now that the time was so near, had he been captured already?
Then they saw the two men at the end of the alley. One was big with brown hair and thick, oversized fists. The other was small with blonde hair, a grey jacket and a stubborn look to his face. “I got this,” Bucky said angrily as he went to keep the big jerk away from his punk best friend and partner. “And you owe me ten bucks.”
Without another word he walked out of the apartment and turned left. The neighbor to their right was a sweet old widow woman who was nearly deaf. She would never hear anything that went on in their apartment. It was why the radio was next to the wall they shared with her. Just a sweet, deaf old lady.
“In here, Tony.” Bucky called from the kitchen. As he crossed the small space to round the little wall that held a closet, he saw the both of them finishing with dinner.
Tony doesn't like doctors or hospitals in any time period. Bucky wakes in the night from his latest memories, but they eventually remind him of something he never wanted to remember.
Natasha moved closer to the news reel footage. “He looks happy.” She said as she studied the Tony on screen. “The real kind of happy.”
“There is if you get arrested for it,” Bucky said softly, eyes cast down unable to meet Tony’s. “I know you don’t seem to have a problem with it like a lot of people do. Even if you didn’t have a problem, it still doesn’t mean you’d want to be kissed by some fella.” He looked up at Tony. “But I heard what you told Joe in the alley, and I couldn’t stop thinking about why’d you’d say something like that. Then I saw your face when Steve fell in your lap, how you looked at him and leaned in like you were gonna…So I took a chance.”
Hope you enjoyed this! I'm trying to write at least a little every day, so expect one or two updates a week.
He thought back to their first night together with Tony. It had been wonderful, and Steve felt his skin heating as he remembered Bucky between them being so good and eager as he took both of them. He remembered the next day when their horrible neighbor had threatened them. They had been so scared, but Tony had handled everything once he’d gotten home. He’d been amazing, both with how he protected them and the conversation they’d had afterwards.
Steve’s head jerked in surprise to the ceiling in a thoughtless habit. Tony had repeatedly told them that JARVIS was everywhere, not in the ceiling. Why would Bucky be in Tony’s workshop?
“Alright, soldier,” Tony’s voice was a dark, sensual promise, “If you want to prove yourself, I hope you like it rough. I’m gonna fuck you into the ground.”
Colonel Phillips had promised to keep the reasons behind this private, believing that Tony didn’t want Steve to know his identity was fake and save him the embarrassment. The man truly didn’t care about anything that wasn’t related to winning the war. Tony both admired and was thankful for his focus.
“It was joke!” Dugan defended. “How was I supposed to know he would understand me enough to take it personally? I’ll say one thing for him, that little guy is fast.”
Bucky smiled sadly and shook his head as he began to back away from Steve towards the exit. “You’re such a punk.”
Things were looking pretty dark for Tony, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to give in to panic. Because in the darkness of his life right now, there were two sources of light, and they were sleeping in the next room on matching twin beds.
Tony laughed, not knowing how to handle the slight awe in Steve’s voice. “Oh, there’s plenty I can’t do. Like stay quiet for any period of time or find healthy coping mechanisms or remember birthdays. I can’t cook worth a damn. Seriously, it once took me two hours to make an omelet. And what you do? The sketching and art stuff? I’d never be half that good even after years of study.”
“Well, now I know where Clea gets her looks from, but I honestly don’t know where she and the fool are at the moment. Ironically, I was supposed to have a meeting with him this morning, but I guess he must have left his day-planner in that mirror dimension he loves so much.”
That Tex Avery cartoon Bucky and Tony mentioned was indeed the iconic Bugs Bunny. It was in fact the famous rabbit's very first appearance before he was eventually given his name. I watched the cartoon for research, and oh boy, has Bugs come a long way.
The neighbor to the left, however, was not sweet and apparently not deaf. But he was old enough to have learned an ounce of tolerance and compassion by now. Tony knew the guy would be alone. His wife was a nurse who worked her ass off at the hospital because he complained of a bad back and wouldn’t hold down a job.
Natasha raised one eyebrow. “Three months of memories in two hours? You’re lucky your brains aren’t leaking out of your ears by now. Even your minds can’t process that much information that quickly.”
“Where you off to today, Tony?” James asked as he stood and grabbed his lunch from the table (Two boiled eggs, slice of bread and an apple). “You said earlier you had a plan.”
He looked directly into Tony’s eyes. “I don’t like you, Anthony. I didn’t when I first heard of you, or after, when I met you. I saw someone who was going to try to take what was mine, so you were my enemy. I realize now that I was wrong about your motives. I can admit that, but I still don’t like you. I don’t like being reminded where I fall short. I don’t like having to think ‘What if I cared a little more?’ I don’t like feeling uncertain about me being the smartest person in the room. So, I don’t like you for those reasons.”
He looked into Bucky’s eyes, begging him to believe it. The other man drew a deep, shaky breath. “But I called you…”
Steve stepped forward and carefully wrapped his arms around Tony. It was a lot tighter than a normal person would embrace another, and Tony could feel the power that was barely being held in check, but it was still in Steve’s control. Tony wouldn’t have cared if he bruised or cracked something anyway. It would heal and was worth it that Steve was trusting himself and trying.
The show had gone relatively well. Steve still had to read the lines that were taped to his shield, but Tony knew as Steve became more comfortable, they wouldn’t be necessary. Steve was completely capable of memorizing his lines. It was his nerves that were the real problem, that and the outfit. Tony loved Steve, but that thing was a travesty. He’d thought the outfit Steve was wearing when they’d first met fighting Loki had been garish, but sweet Odin, the one the USO had provided made the other look fit for a GQ magazine cover.
He saw the man remove his glasses and wipe the lenses on the bottom of his rumpled shirt before replacing them on his nose. “I keep saying this, but I’m not really this kind of doctor.” He huffed before looking at the holo-images beside him. “As far as I can tell, both your brains are in a state of hyperstimulation.” He pointed to where the two very detailed replicas of his and Bucky’s brains were slowly spinning in midair.
God Tony loved them. They were not blind to his faults, but they chose to love him anyway. Even if it was admitting that Tony had a tendency to violence when pushed far enough. He didn’t deserve them.
Both of their faces were awash with anger and tears. Steve’s breathing was labored from the strain of his emotions.
“I blacked out. The next thing I remember was waking up screaming, strapped down on a dirty cot while they were cutting me open, breaking my ribs to remove the metal fragments. All I could do was scream and wish I’d never woke up.”
Just as he stuck out his tongue to lightly lick at Steve’s rim, he felt Bucky release him from his mouth and move lower. As Steve gasped at the new feeling of Tony teasing at his ass, Tony had to hold in a gasp of his own when he felt Bucky’s tongue begin to do the same to him. He needed to focus on Steve.
“I know what I heard.” The other man gritted out, like it was too painful to think about. “I know what you and those little fruits are doing next door. Leave now or come tomorrow, I’ll tell everyone what you’ve been gettin’ up to. Then I won’t have to wait for you to move.”
And Tony had seen in the man’s eyes that he’d known what Tony was trying to warn him about. He'd always seemed to know. His fellow genius had accepted his fate, and Tony wanted to hate him for it. He knew it was petty of him, but he’d begun to rely on the man. He hadn’t wanted to watch him die. Tony had struggled not to think of Yinsen as he’d watched Steve kneel over the dying man. The situation had been eerily familiar.
Tony didn’t want to think about it. He couldn’t let himself believe that it would happen. He’d heard enough about how Steve had found Bucky in that Hydra base strapped to a table after they did who the fuck knows what to him. His sweet boy…
Her eyes watered before she wrapped her arms around his shoulders and hugged him. “You’re a good man, Tony Stark.” She whispered in his ear. “Thank you for your discretion.  Please know that I’ll keep your secret as well.”
Fucking Umar. She’d apparently thought of everything. She’d called it a consolation prize, like a gift, when really it was a curse. Literally, a fucking curse. It had its own mark and everything.
The thought of winter made him think of Steve, and of course Tony, as he hoped his partners were doing alright. Mail service was very unreliable, and Bucky never stayed in any place for too long, so he was very behind on news from home. He knew that Tony would take care of Steve though. It gave him comfort that at least he didn’t have to worry about Steve starving or dying from illness with Tony looking out for him.
Edna was the owner’s wife who sometimes worked behind the counter. Tony would chatter at her until she’d roll her eyes, smile indulgently and grab him a piece of licorice from the jar next to the register. It wasn’t really free. Tony wouldn’t do that. She and her husband had five children to support, but the banter was fun.
Steve’s eyebrows narrowed as he looked at him. “So am I. We’ve been worried about him for months. He’s been fighting at the front, and we haven’t gotten letters in forever.”
He loved Bucky. With all his heart. He had since he was fifteen, and six years later nothing had changed that. “I love
Dum looked stricken as Bucky watched him force himself to move back and away. As Bucky turned to look at the guards, they seized both his arms roughly before hauling him from the cell. He was pushed along by their tight grip, but he didn’t struggle. There was no point. It would only make the pain begin sooner, and he knew there would be pain.
But before he could worry if that was too much, he saw Bucky’s cock jerk between his open legs, and he answered, “Yes, sir.”
“Tony,” Erskine said in a lower voice as he waved at the guard to let them through. “I know you are nervous, but try to calm yourself.”
There were more guards waiting for them, but between Steve’s brute strength and the fighting moves Tony had showed him, along with Tony shooting anyone that looked his way, they easily made it to the door. As they finally entered the hallway, Tony quickly surmised that this was almost directly beneath where the prisoners were being held.
“Poor bloke,” Monty whispered above the groans and angry cursing of the men who’d been beaten. “I wish him a quick death.”
“James, what are you doing home so early?” He asked as he carried his grocery box to the kitchen. Steve was in there already, probably looking through the shelves for ingredients to throw together. An empty pot sat on the stove.
Before Steve could really think about the actions of his reckless partner, Tony grabbed him again and began to sink down. They both groaned as Steve finally slid into the man above him. Instinct had Steve grab Tony’s hips again as Tony panted and moaned with every inch he took.
Tony pocketed the key before pulling out his wallet and removing two five dollar bills. “This is for you. Find a flophouse in another city then a job. I can’t have the thought of you living on the street weighing down my conscience because I honestly don’t want to think of you again after this moment.”
Tony placed the bottle on the table as he took his seat and watched as a soft blush spread on Steve’s cheeks. Right. Not his business. He’d probably walked in on a private conversation. Here he was getting between the two of them again.
Sounding frustrated from his other side, Tony quickly said, “I love you both, and I know you’re confused and hurting right now, Sweetheart, but we need to get the hell out of here! Now!”
“A herd of…? What did you just call me?” Joe asked hotly. “Troc…Trocodyte?” His big meaty fists clenched at his sides.
“That son of a bitch,” Bucky snarled. “He only does this when you’re alone. I’m so tired of this shit.”
“As for you, other Stark,” he told Tony, “keep reminding him that it’s one of my soldiers who’s gonna go in that blasted contraption. If I lose a good man because of ego, the next test we do will be with one of you in the chamber. Keep him in check. Just stop being an ass about it.” He looked back at Howard. “That last order was for you too, Stark.”
When Steve met his eyes, Tony felt a swelling of pride. Steve was finally believing in himself. He was finally seeing what Tony had always seen.
Martinelli went and shook both of their hands in quick succession. “Molto piacere di conoscerti. If you are friends of Tony, then you are my friends as well.” He turned back to Tony. “Everything is prepared as you requested. Shall we go?”
Thank you all again. I don't know when the next chapter will post, but it will at least be by next Saturday. It depends on how much work I can get done.
“Yeah, it was fine,” James conceded. Tony actually thought he sounded bratty. “But Rowling’s ending was perfect! Why mess with it? Did the script writers just need something to do?”
Bucky looked disappointed as he answered, “It got off the ground, at least. Too bad it’s not ready yet. That was somethin’ to see.”
At that moment Gianetta appeared through the curtain, smiling professionally as she approached the table. “Good evening, gentlemen. I am Gianetta. It is my pleasure to serve you this evening. May I get you started with a drink?”
Both of his sweet, precious boys were sitting beside each other on the couch and looked upset. Not angry upset, no Tony would understand since he was arriving home later than usual. This was supposed to be their first night in an official relationship, and they’d promised to talk about it.
“I had something more practical in mind.” Tony said as he finished closing his pack. If she hadn’t followed, Tony would have found a way to borrow a plane and fly them there himself. They could bill him for the plane later.
“See, it’s only been a day, and you’re making progress,” Tony told him encouragingly. “I’m sure you’ll figure out the right pressures to use in no time.”
“I know your arm is giving you trouble, Buck, but don’t worry, we’ll get it fixed. Are you sure it isn’t hurting you? Nat said some of the nerves in your shoulder could be affected with the damaged wiring.”
She’d been alone when he found her, standing by herself in the back of an almost empty hallway and staring at a file that he was quite sure she wasn’t really reading. She seemed lost in her thoughts until she noticed his approach and looked up. Surprise filtered onto her face to find him there with her. “Mr. Stark, how can I help you?”
Tony and Howard called a truce. Let's hope it can last. Tony is absurdly sweet, but we already knew that. Also, that song he sang is one of my favorites to come from that year, Only Forever by Bing Crosby. It technically came out later in the year when this takes place, but I took some liberties because it fit so well with what I needed to do.
Bucky smiled at the memories of coming home to Steve, then later to Steve and Tony. “It was nice coming home to your cooking. Lunch wasn’t anything special most days, just a slice of bread and some boiled eggs with an apple if I was lucky. You made our apartment home.”
He crossed over and knelt between them, cupping a hand on each of their cheeks. “What’s wrong, boys?”
They went as quickly as carrying Bucky between them allowed. Steve was tempted to just scoop him into his arms, but he knew that would only hurt Bucky’s pride when they made it to the others. They easily followed the tracks of the prisoners and whatever vehicles they’d taken until finally they found them just where Steve had told them to be.
Silent again as he set the now empty glass into the sink knowing Steve would wash it for him. Six months and Tony had never seen the man clean one dish. Not even a fork.
Tony didn’t know the why or how behind it, but he was sure as hell smart enough to connect the dots. This curse, whatever it really was, wanted him to know Bucky was pain, and it was driving Tony crazy. There were moments when he closed his eyes, Tony could swear that hears his voice crying out. Other times he just hears a stream of numbers being repeated, and Tony has to force himself to think of something else.
Another wave of memories flooded his mind at that thought, and he grit his teeth against the onslaught. It wasn’t as bad as before, but he still didn’t like it. The pain wasn’t what bothered him the most; he was used to pain even if he couldn’t remember the details of how it was inflicted. No, the sensation was too similar to the chair, a surge of something forced into his mind and overwhelming his synapses.
“Yes, you are.” Steve said firmly as he slowed his thrusts to ground his hips deeply. “You’re mine, so only my opinion matters. I love your chest, Tony.” Tony groaned as Steve’s dick rubbed along his prostate, and Bucky settled in the back of his throat. “Bucky loves it too. Tell him, love.”
From the beginning of this story, I had been fascinated with the idea that after his encounter with Red Skull, Erskine would have studied the occult since he had planned to fight Schmidt throughout the war as he helped the SSR. If he hadn't been murdered, who knows what he could have been able to tell them about mythological lore and the tesseract? I also believe since he feared this to be a possiblity, he would have found some way to sense powerful magical energy around him. I know I would want to be able to if Red Skull was after me. I also loved the idea of Erskine giving Tony one of his inspirational father figure speeches. Damn you, Stanley Tucci, do I have to like everything you do?
“How can I?” Steve sassed as he shook off what had been said, “You’re takin’ all the stupid with you.”
“Boys,” he stopped their questioning and just hugged them close. “It’s alright. I just had a friendly chat Mr. Byrne.”
Steve jolted in surprise before his brain caught up to what was happening. He made a sound in the back of his throat then wrapped his arms around Tony’s shoulders and pulled him closer, returning the kiss. Tony gently pressed kisses along his lips, giving tiny licks until he coaxed Steve to open his mouth and slid his tongue in.
But what else could he do? He was stranded here, immune to magic that could get him home. Time travel technology would have been near impossible in his time even with his nearly unlimited resources. There was no way he could build it in this century. Even he wasn’t that good.
Tony answered that by undoing the last buckle, and the ground raced up to meet him. As predicted, Steve caught him effortlessly. “My hero.”
Steve’s brave face was almost perfect. If Tony didn’t know him as well as he did, he probably wouldn’t notice a thing. Tony thought back to the Steve from his time and realized how much the man had been holding back. Now that he knew Steve, Tony could look back at all the small signs that their fearless leader was far from OK, and no one had guessed the extent of it. If Tony ever made it back, he was tempted to blast all of them with a gauntlet from his suit for their blindness, himself included.
Bruce’s smile was full of compassion as he told Bucky, “I’m glad it’s not upsetting you anymore, and that you are able to appreciate what this is giving you.”
The boys faces broke into smiles, they knew how uncomfortable serious emotions made him. They were sweet like that. As they got up to get their coats, Tony added, “I hope you don’t think this is free, Steve.”
He closed his eyes as he rode the wave of his climax through the aftershocks; his body still tingling. He eventually reopened them when he felt Steve gently pull out of him. He turned his head to see Bucky laying beside him and panting through his recovery.
“To celebrate your first day up and about o’course.” Bucky rolled his eyes. “It was fun. Stevie and me went shopping around for the ingredients after he sold his sketches. We even found some pretty good wine for the sauce.”
It turned out that Tony was right, and he was able to get out of bed by himself. He also had to immediately sit back down in a wheelchair because rules were rules, but at least they were wheeling him
“It’s just a scratch, Steve, really! And I have work to do!” Tony protested, “I am very in demand right now.”
But every night as he took a shower, Tony would throw away the mask he wore and let himself cry, his tears washed away by the water. If only his problems could follow them down the drain. He knew in his heart that he would need to accept this. He would have to let them go and trust that somehow everything would work out, that he’d succeed and not have to lose them.
“The asshole who lives next door?” Tony asked, wondering just how much he was gonna have to kick the guys ass.
“Mrs. Byrne,” he began, “I don’t want to intrude on what isn’t my business, but I wanted to say that I’m sorry. You don’t deserve to be going through this.”
Tony had woken early to check on him, and it was good that he did because Steve had been very close to putting his fist through a wall. Apparently, Steve had problems trying not to rip his clothes or pop buttons as he dressed, so Tony had buttoned his shirt and trousers then assisted with his belt and shoelaces. They’d made their way to rehearsal together while Tony told him what his cover story would be to explain his presence at Steve’s side through the tour.
“Excellent choice of location,” he said as he crossed the space, “I just happen to have found some apples on my way back, and I think they should be used before they spoil. Why not put them in a pie so they’ll keep?”
He was so sensitive. It felt even more sensitive than in the memories he’d just been focusing on, and that was…good? Bucky watched as he lightly trailed his fingers along the clothed outline of his cock. Yes, he decided, that was very good. Feeling a thrill that he couldn’t explain, he popped open the buttons of his leathers and slid his hand inside. Skin on skin was even better. He supposed he had already known that through his memories, but it was still kind of exciting to confirm it. It still felt more intense than a memory.
Erskine smirked at this. “I don’t believe that common is a word that should be used to describe you, Tony,” he said as they stopped in front of the diner’s door. Tony opened it for the other man. “Thank you,” he told him as he entered the little eatery, and Tony followed him feeling slightly off step.
He had always been sir, a few times master. It had been fine with him because the experiences had been fun and pleasurable, but it had never affected him like it had when Bucky called him sir. And then daddy. He was only daddy to Bucky.
“Well, I had already planned on taking the both of you somewhere tonight.” Tony admitted. “I wanted to do something special, but now it can be a double celebration. That’s even better.”
Like a pack of wolves, all three simultaneously relaxed their bodies in defeat and slowly began to walk towards the street behind Tony, giving him a wide berth. They stood at the entryway and waited for their leader. At least they were loyal.
“It keeps my lip warm,” Dugan told them, “and I was a strong man act, Jones. Could lift over twice my weight and throw it across a room without breaking a sweat.”
“Well educated, indeed, and a few of those would come in handy over here.” Phillips said. “I heard from the freed officers that you know something about first aid.”
“Uonnhh..” Steve moaned under him as Tony started to quicken his thrusts. The sound of their skin slapping began to compete with their own grunts and groans. It sounded like Steve was desperately trying to bite his lip only to moan again when Tony slammed in just a little bit harder.
Steve knew he should just be able to say this, but Bucky was right. They usually talked about what Bucky wanted. Steve had never really had to say the things he might want to try because before now, he’d only wanted to give Bucky what he liked, and it had been more than enough. “I really liked watchin’ you with him, a lot. I’ve never really gotten to do that before, and I was kinda surprised by how much I enjoyed it.”
“They’re really not that good, Tony.” His ears were now pink; the blush had crept so high. “These probably won’t be worth trying to sell.”
“Let’s get to the ground before you start in on my poor life choices. Just unbuckle the straps like I showed you, Steve,” Tony told him as he dropped his pack to the ground before working on his own bindings. He heard the other man’s gear land somewhere below them.
It had been a great evening. The food was delicious, but the company was the best part of it. Tony couldn’t believe he got to have this.
Yes, he would hope because, honestly, he could use all the help he could get, but he wouldn’t just sit back and rely on it blindly.
“Sshh, you’re almost ready. Let us love you, sweetheart,” he said before kissing him again, taking his time and going deep with his tongue as Bucky felt a third finger finally join the others. It was the sweetest ache. Steve’s fingers were so thick now, but they moved so slowly inside him, building him up before letting him gently fall back down. It was like a rolling wave of pleasure that began in his middle and rippled through the rest of him. The swell and release of pressure consumed him.
Still, it was the best conversation that they’d had with each other, and he didn’t know what to make of it.
After Steve had taken down HYDRA (again), razed SHEILD to the ground, nearly died (again) then caused a media shitstorm, he’d gone out searching for his former best friend and had actually found him. Dirty, half-starved, paranoid and deeply troubled James Barnes had needed a lot of time and support to even make it this far.
As Tony unlocked the door to their apartment, he was once again wondering if he should tell the boys about his new job as an army consultant. Legally, he was not allowed to, but as a devoted and honest partner he was feeling pretty guilty keeping this to himself. God knows he already kept so much from them. He knew Steve would find out as soon as he got approved for the program, but Bucky wouldn’t know until…
Steve began to go even faster as he practically milked Tony with his dick. His hands braced on Tony’s chest, holding him down as his legs were held by Bucky. Steve’s thrust were surprisingly brutal, but Fuck, Tony loved each one them. It was so perfect, being held down, the abuse of his prostate, choking on Bucky; so overwhelmed he was crying from it.
“You are staying in bed, Tony.” Steve argued. “Bucky is fixing you a sandwich, and you will stay here and eat it.” This had to be payback for all the times Steve had been difficult while sick and on bedrest. His ma must have been laughing at him from heaven.
Tony’s arms tightened like he would protect Bucky from the world, and at this moment Bucky let himself believe he could. He knew that Tony would take care of him and keep him safe the way he always had. As Tony gently led him to one of the couches in the living area and pulled Bucky down to rest in his lap, Bucky wrapped himself around his older partner. They had hours before they needed to go down and meet the others, and Bucky wanted to spend every one of them here with Tony’s hands softly touching him as he placed gentle kisses on Bucky’s face.
Bucky shifted uncomfortably, looking at Tony out the side of his eye. “It’s not what you think,” he finally told them. “The bloody bruises you saw…it wasn’t torture like that. They were experimenting, ya know? Injectin’ me with stuff. I don’t know what it was, but it was like acid in my veins. Kinda hard not to scream even though I tried.”
“I’ve never seen you at the dance hall. That’s where a lot of singles go to socialize. Your roommates are there every so often, but I never see you with them.”
Abraham chuckled wryly. “ A very good policy in life, I can agree. I am still learning about many things myself.” He looked down at his mess of papers and journals, and his smile faded. “Perhaps I will learn from this. I should have stayed in my apartment or at least left my work there instead of taking it with me, but I was getting hungry and didn’t want to stop working.”
Tony abruptly found the ability to move. He silently crossed the room headed for the front door where he exited the apartment without a sound.
So, this was Dum Dum Dugan. Steve remembered Bucky speaking fondly of him, and as he watched the genuine concern and relief on the man’s face, Steve knew that fondness was well placed. The other men of the small group also crouched down to speak to Bucky. A man with a red beret spoke, and Steve realized he was British. “Well done, Sergeant. I feared I’d never see you again. How very like you to prove me wrong.”
“You took care of me last night, too,” Steve reminded him. “You were always there to call me out when I needed it. You always tried to save me from my poor choices.”
“Felt like my blood sugar was too low for a second there,” Sam said, “but that doesn’t make sense. We just had a big breakfast together.”
Yeah, Steve definitely agreed that Tony should be in charge, at least at first, so Steve could learn what to do by watching him.
Colonel Philips had practically hugged him. Well, not really, but he stopped yelling at the person in front of him and nodded his head once at Tony before going back to berating the soldier. Tony figured that was as good as a hug from their imposing leader.
The colonel looked past Steve to Agent Carter who had just arrived. “You and I are going to have a conversation later that you won’t enjoy.” Before he looked back to Tony. “Again, why exactly is Stark here?”
“That’s not why I’m fighting,” Tony told him truthfully as he met Steve’s eyes. Tony looked at Bucky then back at Steve, choosing his words for their audience. “I didn’t jump out that plane for recognition, Steve. I did it because you and Bucky are the only family I have, the only family I’ve had for most of my life. I’ve worked too hard over the years to keep you fed and safe and healthy because you didn’t have anyone else who would. I will be damned if I let something as stupid as this stop me from continuing that. If it’s change my name or stay in the lab, I’ll change my name.”
“It’s fine,” Tony waved it off. “Trust me, I’ve actually been screwed over worse than that by a business partner.” Obie’s face swam through his mind at the thought. “But, um, do you know of a shelter or anything I could stay at? At least until I sort through this mess?”
Movement next to them made Bucky turn his head, and sure enough, their new friend was here with them. In the dim light, Bucky could see Gabe hunched over. His head was lightly bleeding above his left temple, but he appeared to be alright beyond that.
Tony had been known for his narcissism, his ego. It was a product of his brilliance and success, and though he was still brilliant, he was hardly a success. Almost broke and sleeping on the couch of two people kind enough to take pity on him, Tony was a far cry from the Genius. Billionaire. Futurist. Philanthropist. he used to be. (He hadn’t really considered himself a playboy in a while) And here were these two amazing young men acting like he was something special when he hadn’t done much more than change a light bulb.
“Update this information every half-hour, JARVIS” Steve added. “I have a feeling more papers will just be randomly published by then. It’s like everything he’s doing takes time to catch up to us.”
Bucky lay still and tried to train his eyes in the darkness. The only source of light streamed in from narrow windows above them. The soft, cool quality of it told him it was night, but he seriously doubted it was the same night he’d been captured. His mouth had that grungy feeling of sleeping for too long. Had they drugged them for transport? Still, he was finally able to take in the room around him.
“Though tonight, I think I know what I want to do with you.” He finished and released his hold on them.
Bucky looked at the idiot who thought a bowler hat and a helmet were interchangeable and sighed. “Then why aren’t you asleep?”
He tried to act like a person, but what was a person without their memories? The answer was Bucky. He didn’t even understand why he was called Bucky when he had been told at the museum that his name was James. That knowledge and understanding came with memories he didn’t have. Sometimes he felt like an adopted dog. The dog had once belonged to someone else, but his new owners gave him a new name when they’d taken him in. It didn’t erase the dog’s past, and he knew that he was still more Asset than Bucky.
, Tony thought as he squirmed inside over what Bucky said. Tony didn’t feel like a hero. He hadn’t in a long time. Hero’s didn’t lie for years to the people they loved. They didn’t do a lot of the things Tony did. “I just pushed him to the side,” Tony mumbled. “It wasn’t anything heroic.”
“Buonasera, my friends!” He exclaimed happily. Tony sometimes entertained the thought that the man reminded him of an older looking Italian Thor. He was just so loud and happy most of the time, as well as kind to the people in his life. Francesco was the god of pasta, and Tony firmly believed he had a magical saucepan in the kitchen that helped to make everything so delicious.
Tony raised his head again and kissed him more deeply this time, and Steve opened for him. The scratch of beard against his skin heightened the sensations he felt as Tony sucked at his tongue in an unhurried way. There was nothing forceful or inherently dominant about it, but Steve realized that it didn’t have to be. Tony was clearly in charge, and he was pushing Steve’s endurance in a different way than he’d usually do by forcing him to stay still. Steve could stay still, right?
“No way! One of the Commandos was in the circus? How did not know this?” The archer seemed genuinely fascinated. “Was he any good?”
The war has officially started! Sorry about the minor history lesson, but the nerd in me took over, and I couldn't bring myself to get rid of any of it. I'm kinda nervous about the comments I might get on this chapter, but I will still appreciate every one of them. Just be gentle. So if you need to vent, or have any questions, I check my inbox daily. Thanks guys, and I'm sorry.
Tony’s head snapped to the side to stare at the German scientist. He hadn’t told Erskine that little fact. He’d only said that he would have dealings with Howard later in the man’s life. “That is an unfounded accusation, Doc, and not very scientific. Where’s your proof?”
“So, about running the test again,” His words were carefully restrained, almost stilted, as he continued, “We can focus our attention on regulating the voltage by going over the amount of maximum resistance that will be required to prevent the current from damaging the person in the chamber should our safe guards fail. That way we’ll be able to…”
Bucky was his other gorgeous contradiction. Strong bodied with lean muscles, his sweet boy hated fighting and violence. He did it because it was necessary. He was effortlessly charming and charismatic, but at the same time was so shy and unsure of himself behind the performance. He was truly Tony’s sweet boy who saw enough in Tony to trust him unconditionally and give him the loving role of daddy. Tony loved taking care of them both, and he especially loved how he took care of Bucky. He loved having someone to treasure. It was something he’d never had before.
“Tony, we don’t care about your scars.” Steve said before he hastily added, “I mean, we aren’t bothered by ‘em. They’re just a part of you.”
He knew Bucky would want this too, want the reminder of who they were to each other. It had been a while. Since Tony arrived, they’d had to sneak in quick moments of affection, quiet sessions of lust when Tony was sound asleep. They made up for lost time.
“Hickman, Lirette, Smith and Prewett,” Bucky called to the soldiers he’d gathered. They were the ones lucky enough to still be fit for duty. The others could barely walk a day’s march, much less hold a gun and fight. He continued, “Douglas, McCoy, Thomason and Hebert, I want you to make a perimeter. If you find anyone, I want them. We need to know if more are coming after us.”
“That’s Ok, though,” Bucky continued. “Over the last few hours, I’ve realized that I’m selfish enough that it doesn’t bother me. You need to take care of me, and I’m thankful for that.” Bucky grabbed his hand and squeezed lightly. “I’m thankful for it. I’ve been laying here thinkin’ of the past few days, the past few months, and I realized that I never really thanked you. I never stopped to fully appreciate what you did when you refused to fight me. How much you were risking when you set out to find me, and what it might have cost you when you brought me here. Thank you, Steve.”
“That I am so lucky to have fallen in love with the two talented and gorgeous men seated with me.” Tony answered immediately.
Also, Tony got eucalyptus because when vaporized in an area, it can: boost the immune system; help with allergies, headaches and sore throats; improve respiratory circulation; fight bacterial, viral and fungal infections; reduces pain and inflammation.  Sounds like something Steve should have around the house.
Dernier said, “Ça m’étonne que tu puisses faire ça avec tes blessures. Comment se pas la guérison ?”
Steve nodded. “And what you said, about me, no one but Bucky’s ever done somethin’ like that. Just like that first day when we met, you defended me.” Steve sounded like he was reassuring himself along with Tony and was seeing it in a different light now that he’d had time to think about it. “You made my problem your problem. That day, you promised to break his arm…” His voice full of emotion as he finished, “Then tonight, he tried to call me a queer and you just…kept your promise. You said me and Buck were worth…”
Tony takes a day trip with Dr. Erskine. Later that evening he goes on an outing with his boys. In the future Steve tries to cook but is sidetracked when Bucky starts asking some really deep questions. Basically it's grumpy army colonels, Italian food, more Italian food and a question of philosophy.
Fine. If Tony had to earn this the hard way, he would. His eyes narrowed as he told Philips, “My brain is the best part of me, not the only part.”
Steve was ready to beg. “Please, sir,” he choked as Tony pressed a little harder but still didn’t enter him. “Please…”
But Tony would be alone. He would be left behind by Bucky, then Steve, and neither were coming back. Tony would know that too.
Before he knew it, Thanksgiving was there. The trees in the parks were filled with reds, golds and browns. A freak cold front had almost frozen the city five days before, the low temperature odd for so early in the season. Steve had gotten very sick and had had to go to the doctor, fluid was starting to form in his lungs. Tony hadn’t batted an eye when he paid the hospital at the end of Steve’s stay. He merely waved off Steve and Bucky’s protests that it wasn’t his job to pay for things like that, and they would work out a payment arrangement.
Bucky threw his arms around Tony and kissed him breathless. His tongue practically danced with Tony’s. “Thank you,” he said wetly as they pulled apart. “Thank you for being patient and telling me to wait and find something I’d like. I’d probably be luggin’ boxes somewhere and hating every minute of it. I’ve never had a job I was excited about.”
You know how everything up until now has been seen through Tony's eyes? Well, wouldn't it be interesting to hear from someone else? I won't say who, but at some point in the next chapter, another point of view will weigh in as the boys have a talk about Tony.
“That was supposed to be a surprise,” Tony muttered, thinking of the nearly finished washing machine he was keeping in the basement, and earned two smiles.
Bucky knew Steve looked as surprised as he did right now, especially as Steve asked, “What does that do?”
“Four days,” Steve answered him, that haunted look returning. “God Tony, I didn’t know what to do. The doctors kept using all these words like internal bleeding and spinal damage and conflicting images, and they kept running tests and scans on you and saying none of it made any sense.”
“I ask myself that every time you open your mouth.” Bucky told him as he shut his eyes, not threatened by the archer’s anger in the slightest.
Erskine sighed as he finally finished putting his research back in order. “I may have fixed this mess, but I am no closer to fixing my original problem.” He looked to Tony. “I know what I need to do, but I am out of my expertise in creating a solution to getting it done.”
Tony hadn’t been in there for longer than a few minutes before he’d walked out with a smooth expression, approached Steve and asked if he was ready for lunch. Steve hadn’t been near enough to the room to hear what had been said through the door, but Jacobson never mentioned Tony again in the months that followed. The closest was that day on the boat, but like Steve had observed, no words were actually spoken.
Tony felt his despair well up again at that empty promise, and he broke down into new tears, sobbing against Bucky’s chest as Steve cradled him from behind. They didn’t know. How could they? But Tony knew the truth. He knew that despite whatever plans he made to save them, there was still the likely chance that their destinies couldn’t be changed.
“So I should threaten to shoot his phone first?” Bucky asked sarcastically as he cracked an eye to peek up at Steve, hoping he hadn’t crossed a line.
As Steve finally got backstage, he saw Tony practically vibrating out of skin waiting for him. Tony had been right about Steve needing to prepare himself for a bad welcome, and he should have listened. At least now they could both go and try to find someone who knew about the 107th.
Tony just began to count the bills out quickly, like this was an inconvenience he was ready to be done with. The man happily accepted the money and asked if they wanted their bags brought up for them.
Bucky has left for the army. Steve and Tony struggle to adjust to his absence. Tony has his first official consultation at the SSR where he has a long dreaded encounter with his father. Meanwhile in the present, the team bonds over dinner, and Bucky continues his journey of being a person.
The sorcerers had managed to scrounge up about twenty-five bucks for him, a decent sum for the time period. They must have really pitied him. Tony wondered how he could get more and looked down at his suit.
“Never met anyone like him, that’s for sure,” Morita said. “What’s he do? I mean before coming here with the Captain? He said he’s an engineer now, but he also knows weapons tech?”
Tony hadn’t really thought of that. Yes, Steve was smaller in this time, but Tony didn’t think of him as frail or sickly. The kid was a pistol, all sass and determination and attitude. Tony wondered if anyone besides James had seen it too, before the serum that is.
The Captain, Designation: Steve, Previous Target Status: Elimination--failed objective, Authority Level: friend?, had brought him here.
So he hungrily swallowed around Tony’s fingers, moving his tongue against them and enjoying the slight scratching of nails along the back of his throat. His eyes watered as Tony pushed his fingers deeper, his heavy body still caging Steve and reminding him that he was trapped and under Tony’s control.
Bucky shrugged as he finished eating his stew sooner than was probably healthy. He wiped his hands on his pants and grabbed the chocolate. “I dunno, a few days, maybe? Before that we ate twice a day, some kind of grey-brown stuff they’d give us in bowls. We weren’t really sure what it was.”
Pepper had once told him that he also craved approval or whatever, but he tried not to look at that too closely. It wasn’t healthy for someone like him to want that from others.
Tony shrugged. “About as much as most people, I guess. Whether it’s true or not, I couldn’t say. I’m not one of those people who believe everything in the papers.”
“Yes, sir. I apologize if I was in error, but as you heard, Sir ordered me to watch over and help if necessary. After monitoring your distress and the conversation that followed, I felt it pertinent to show you that Sir also believed in your ability to heal and recover.”
“I…” Tony’s mind was melting because who the fuck knew that Steve could be this seductive? “I just wanted…”
“You’re welcome to try.” Tony knew he was outnumbered, but it shouldn’t matter too much. This guy was probably just a goon throwing his weight around while Tony had been sparring for the past few months with his Avenger teammates. Hell, before that he was training with Happy, and contrary to popular belief, Happy really could fight well for a non-powered human.
Steve’s heart was beating faster as he pictured what he was saying. Each image just made him more sure he wanted it. “I don’t want what Bucky wants. I don’t want to feel like I’m sweet and precious. I want…”
The first show had been pretty bad. Most of the soldiers were just there because they weren’t fighting at the moment, and there was nothing else for them to do. They had liked the girls, but that wasn’t a surprise. Most men liked pretty women in small outfits. They didn’t seem to care much about Steve one way or the other. They just looked at him like he was a joke and mocked some of the things he’d said. Steve had tried.
“Thank you, Dr. Banner. I have taken the liberty to monitor certain news and social media topics about the current situation. It would seem that there were brief instances of vertigo captured through live feeds of vlogs, chats and gaming as the people experienced them. The cause is not known, and most simply resumed whatever they were doing at the time. The name Anthony Sutton does not appear to feature in them. The most I can find are in reference to the name is as a member of the Captain’s team on fan and historical sites. I do not believe that people have put together his connection to this event at the moment.”
As if sensing this, the two younger men pulled their hands away at the same time. “Can we change your bandages?” Bucky asked softly.
“Fuck you!” Joe spat as he lunged. Tony dodged the first punch and landed one of his own to Joes mouth, but the left uppercut from Joe got him in the jaw. His head whipped back violently as he wondered if some teeth were knocked loose. That’s when a knife came up and slashed at his stomach. Tony barely had time to jump back as he felt the blade cut through his shirt and graze his abdomen in a quick burn of pain.
3.)Baking bread was messy and time consuming, and the dough got wedged under his fingernails. It smelled good, though.
It was New Year’s Eve, and Tony was almost home. Home with Bucky and Steve, not home to his time, and that was OK. He was beginning to accept this new reality. He still missed his friends and his life, but each day was a little easier. He wished he could take credit for becoming so well adjusted, but it was really all Steve and Bucky. They just made life better.
Bucky nodded and said, “Yes,” before he looked at Tony. “Can I daddy? I promised to listen to Steve.”
Steve’s head turned as his eyes snapped up to meet his, and Tony watched as his pupils darkened while his face looked conflicted. “Tony, we…I mean... Bucky just left, and…”
Again, conversation stopped as everyone looked at Bucky, and he felt embarrassed by his outburst. Thankfully, Barton swallowed his surprise and answered, “Yeah, it’s where I learned archery and acrobatics. It’s where I got the name Hawkeye. Why?”
“Yes, Daddy,” he sighed as he sank into the soft mattress beneath him. The sheets smelled clean like lavender and mint as he stretched his body over them and laid his head to rest between his arms. After a moment he felt something cool and wet run over his back. His muscles twitched, but he was good and stayed still. When he felt two sets of hands begin to rub whatever it was into his skin, it became absolutely wonderful.
There was that chest warmth again. If Tony was in his time, he’d see a doctor about that. Maybe it was some kind of delayed infection from the surgery. It couldn’t be feelings. Tony didn’t get those anymore, not since Pepper left.
