And I just... I thought you’d enjoy watchin’ the lights go up.” Steve’s eyes widen, big and blue and under the lights all around them, and Tony buries his head in Steve’s chest with a groan.
In the warmth around him it would almost feel jarring, but deep inside, he knows where he is and who he’s with, so he opens his eyes and meets tiny, curious ones for the second time.
“You know I do,” Steve replies, and relishes the warmth of Tony’s body as he leans back in to kiss Steve again. It’s slow and deep and utterly tender, Steve’s favorite kind, and he makes sure he pours as much love as he can into every second of it.
“No,” Steve finally says, and it’s nothing Tony doesn’t already know, but it makes his eyes burn nonetheless.
Tony nods. “My mom, she, uh... she baked. Sometimes. Ana Jarvis, too-- the recipe’s hers,” he replies, then jerks his head at the apples. “Today, please.”
“Want to spend the rest of the night answering questions about what kind of toothpaste Captain America uses--”
“You’re extra sappy today,” Tony finally says. “And that’s saying something, 'cause I’ve got permanent cavities from these past three years.”
“Sorry,” he says, shaking his head to clear his thoughts before he turns back to Steve with a smile.
“Okay, I’m here,” Rhodey’s voice appears from somewhere over Steve’s shoulders, and moments later, he’s falling into step beside him. “They in the cafeteria?”
“Baby videos!” Clint screeches, holding up a handful of VHS tapes and waving them in front of him. “
Before Steve can reply, their daughter whimpers in displeasure, wriggling slowly on Tony’s chest, and both of them go silent as they wait for her to drift back to sleep.
“Yeah,” Sam says. “I don’t think anyone remembered you had it when it happened, and we only saw it after they’d taken you.”
“But I see it. How he looks at you. Like you’re the prettiest thing he’s ever seen and he’s still the shrimpy little shit getting his ass kicked in a Brooklyn back alley. Like...you’re everything he’ll never feel good enough to have. Which is bullshit, y’know,” he finally looks back up, shrugging a hell of a lot more casually than he feels. “It’s kinda nauseating to be around you two. In a-- a nice way. It’s... good.”
“Better than coffee,” Steve grins, just to cherish the scathing glare Tony sends him over the rim of his own cup.
Um, so idk how to link things on here, but this is Steve's sweater: http://d1x7zurbps6occ.cloudfront.net/product/xlarge/265033-96442.jpg
Steve doesn’t even have time to move before Rumlow lunges at him, and barely registers the pain as a meaty fist slams against his stomach. The space around him erupts into chaos, but Steve can hear Brock’s voice clear as day. “I’m gonna pay that son a bitch a visit after I’m done with you,” he grunts, even as Steve manages to hit his shoulder. “Gonna show ‘im w-what a piece of
“Uh huh.” Steve nods. He’s so close now, Tony can feel the warmth radiating off him. “But just so y’know... my answer isn’t gonna change.”
“Ohhhh,” Tony groans, moving off Steve’s chest to stretch his limbs languidly. “Now that you mention it, that sounds fucking perfect.”
Tony’s heart make a pathetically happy little jump. “No need to flatter me, big guy. I’m already yours.”
“Aren’t you supposed to be in Physics right now?” Steve asks, but he’s smiling back at him, and Tony just leans his chair back until his head meets his best friend’s stomach.
“I might’ve... called him an angel when I woke up,” he admits, and Pepper laughs so hard she almost falls off the side. It’s always been one of Tony’s favorite sounds, so he thinks he can begrudge her for it just this once, even if it’s at his expense.
“Better than the sneer Howard always gave me, right?” Tony says, before he can stop himself, and then curses when he hears Steve get closer.
100K WORDS!!! KASJDHFKSDHGKSJDHGKAHDAGKJK I can't believe I've reached this point. I wanna thank you guys so much for all the support. Y'all ROCK! <3<3
“He’s all better now, as you can see,” Steve smiles, ignoring the faint thread of disappointment he can feel in his chest at the thought of not seeing Tony again.
Their daughter wiggles and clenches her tiny fists, her bright blue gaze– the same shade of blue Tony’s lucky enough to get to see every day– running in every direction. “God, can we just ditch the others today and stay here?”
JARVIS doesn’t answer, but the film starts playing immediately on the screen in front of them, and Steve makes a hum if approval as they settle in for the rest of the night.
“Shut up,” Tony tugs at the other man’s belt loops, pulling him in until their faces are only inches apart. “You could’ve just said you wanted to climb me like a tree.”
“Mind-numbing, Cap. I’m fucking serious,” Tony sighs, plopping down on the large, fluffy bed with a groan a second later. “Pep’s the only one out of the two of us who knows what I’m doing here. God, I’d kill for a cheeseburger right now. Even one of your sandwiches...” he trails off in a yawn, not bothering to remove his tie from where it hangs loosely around his neck. The only light in the room is coming from the lamp beside the bed, and even with his stomach rumbling with hunger, Tony feels his eyelids start to grow heavy.
“Sees what?” All heads turn to the door as Steve walks inside, perfectly uniformed and composed, and every inch their Captain.
Prompt: "AU where Steve and Tony are neighbours in a building. They notice each other, flirt a little, go to the laundry spontaneously at the same time. Steve thinks he's in the game when HE HEARS TONY TALKING WITH A GUY NAMED JARVIS THROUGH THE WALL. He thinks Tony's AI is his boyfriend. And when Tony still hits on him shamelessly, he says 'What about Jarvis?'"
“You guys make me sick,” is the last thing Tony hears someone yell before the elevator doors open and he’s pressed up against one of the tiny walls.
“Distracting,” he finally says. “How am I– how is anyone supposed to pay attention to your speech when you look like
But Steve only squares his shoulders and grinds his jaw. “Out,” he tells Bucky, low and serious, and Tony tries not to shiver at the sound.
“Wait,” Rhodey finally says, and both Tony and Steve jump and turn their heads in surprise, like they’d forgotten he was there the whole time. “So you’re... not dating?”
Steve’s blush is perfection. He still hasn’t let go of Tony’s wrist, and the whisper soft touch of his thumb on Tony’s pulse is almost maddening. “You think I’m pretty?”
,” Tony whines, and wiggles around beneath a blanket that smells like apple pie and cinnamon. It smells like Steve, and Tony doesn’t even bother trying to hide how much he enjoys being surrounded by it.
, he remembers, and can’t hold back the giggle that bubbles out of him, as uncontrollable and hysterical as he feels.
And it happens more times after that, until one day, Tony's first thought isn't that Jarvis is missing-- it's that he's just with Steve. And, well... that says something. Tony's not sure what, but the way his heart's suddenly beating faster tells him it's probably serious.
DUM-E and Butterfingers and You beep in approval from their stations–- of course it’s approval, what else would it be? Tony’s a fucking
“Don’t need to,” Tony replies. “It’s the truth. And honestly, I still don’t get why you get so worked up abou--”
“Oh, you’re done?” Tony looks down at the white bandaged square on his sternum, and hears Steve chuckle fondly.
Steve just grins, pulling him closer, and he smells like apple pie, goddamnit. “Sharon’s been teaching me to swing, so we thought we’d put some of it to good use. And then Ms. Potts wanted to talk about an art exhibit comin’ to town– thought I’d enjoy it.”
Tony almost drops the wrench he’s holding at the sudden sound of Barnes’ voice behind him, but he manages to keep his composure. “Barton been teaching you how to crawl through the vents?”
The bright, clear voice breaks through the loud bustle around them, and Tony wills his heart to keep a steady rhythm as Steve squeezes through students to reach them. “Hey,” he says, relieved when his voice doesn’t come out as shaky as he suddenly feels.
Like how he’s got a wit dryer than the fucking Sahara, and half of their conversations leave Tony trying to catch his breath after a story or comment Steve’s shared. It’s refreshing in the best way, to have someone who gets Tony’s particular brand of humor, who does’t take off every time Tony’s mouth runs off faster than his brain. Tony knows all too well how difficult he can get, but Steve manages to match it with his own tenacity.
“Steve…” Tony whispers, and he doesn’t know what else to say, but in that moment, he thinks he’d give everything he has to make Steve smile again.
“Jay, say it ain’t so,” Tony says, and when he looks up at the ceiling, Clint wants to laugh because that’s such a fucking
“You guys gonna stay there the whole time, or are you gonna bring her over here with the rest of us?” Slow, heavy footsteps follow the new voice, and a second later, Bucky steps out into view, shoulder tucked into the wall in a lazy lean.
“I know the feelin’,” Steve nods. The smile on his face makes something warm settle in Tony’s chest. “Sorry about, um, before...”
“The point-- listen,” Tony holds up a demanding finger and grins approvingly when Steve’s mouth clacks shut. “The point remains, gorgeous: I’m dealing with more Steve Rogers than anyone’s ever had to, yeah?”
“What’s up, buttercup?” He grins, light and easy and just about everything he’s not feeling right now.
“Don’t apologize, ya moron,” Bucky groans, and Sam doubles over in laughter, his cackles no doubt echoing in every room throughout the school.
“Worry about that later, alright?” Sharon says, as the truck doors open and Tony is wheeled out. “And you,” she lowers her voice and points at Steve, “don’t let him get away.” A breathy
“Merry Christmas,” Steve responds, and revels in the peace that fills his lungs when he feels Tony’s hand find his.
“The fact that you look and sound so proud of this,” he pokes the ribbon, “is honestly making me question this relationship.”
“No, stop,” Tony shakes his head. “I didn’t– hey,” he pulls away to look at Steve again. “I didn’t say it to make you feel bad, Jesus. Don’t apologize–”
“After all of that,” the blond continues, “you changed. It’s no secret that you’re set on helping as many people as you can; your company, and your charities, everything… You’ve already done so much. And I remembered your name— my godfather, Abraham Erskine? He, uh, mentioned meeting you once or twice. I’m hoping you can help—”
“I don’t mind,” Blondie shrugs. “It’s up to them. And to be honest, after the last girl tried to grope me... well, I’m looking forward to going home just a little bit more.”
"Hey, don’t hurt yourself, handsome,” Tony says fondly. His heart beats just a little bit faster, a little bit warmer at the thought of sharing a bed with Steve. “I wouldn’t mind fallin’ into bed with you.”
“Maybe because she’s barely taller than our knees and I see a lot of zeros on this thing, Tony, and she’s two?” Steve whispers. “What the hell is she going to do with
“Eat a couple and then you can nap, sweetie. You don’t want us to finish them all, don’t you?” He asks, chuckling when she shakes her head and opens her mouth expectantly. Tony drops the slice, and then he and Steve share a smile when she hums happily. “More, Daddy.”
?” Tony asks, every line in his body taut and still, and standing there in Tony’s kitchen, dropping green icing atop dozens of sugar cookies, Steve suddenly feels like every moment in his life has been leading up to this one.
,” Steve growls, and Tony doesn’t even have time to take a breath before the blond pounces on him, poking and tickling and swatting him with a cushion.
Tony laughs, loud and clear and happy, and when Pepper walks back the way she came, she finds she feels just the same.
“Oh, we will. But she didn’t make it easy– knocked three agents unconscious before we were able to take it from her.”
“If you shoot this tree down,” Tony tells him around half a mouthful of popcorn, “I’m kickin’ you out.”
“Santa!” Rhodey wails. His knuckles are pale from how hard he’s gripping the bars. “Sits’n a th-thro--”
There’s only one person who’s not currently in the tower, and Clint decides that as annoying as it is to hear Stark and Cap gushing and flirting and laughing with each other, he’s going to stick around right now, because it’s also pretty fucking entertaining.
“No,” Tony says. “But speaking of changing, I gotta ask,” he runs a hand along the outline on the Iron Man suit printed on Steve’s apron. “Who do I have to thank for this little number?”
“Shit, sorry,” Tony blurts. “Didn’t mean it like that, Pep says I’ve got a mouth on me, and yeah, sometimes it goes off on its own like a reflex-- but really, you can’t blame me, you’re hot as f--”
“Alright, up and at ‘em. Come on,” he grunts as he picks her up, leading them out the room to the elevator down the hall. “How long’ve you been up, huh?”
,” Tony laughs, finally digging through a drawer for his pajama pants. “And I didn’t hear you complaining a single minute of it.”
Tony sees his younger self grin, all dimpled cheeks as he all but shoves a familiar blue action figure into the camera lens. “
From where he’s sitting beside Tony, Rhodey lets out a huff. “Show of hands, who honestly saw this coming?”
“Don’t wear my name out, Rogers.” Steve stays silent, and after a couple of moments, Tony sighs. “Pinky promise.”
After all the planning– the hours spent on the phone basically bribing the Met to let him rent out the place for the day, the frankly ridiculous excuses he has to come up with to stop Steve from coming into the workshop while he makes the ring, and the days it takes for him to come up with the perfect speech– it goes wrong the second he goes ahead and does it.
“Like you…” Steve trails off, and his cheeks turn a delicious shade of pink that makes Tony’s skin grow even hotter all over. “Like you want to…”
“And no matter what your father says-- no, listen,” she continues, when every part of his body screams at him to bolt. “You have
“Fucking hot,” Red finishes. Bucky chokes on air, and the Captain runs a hand through his hair. He’s still blushing and breathing hard, and Tony feels his pants getting tighter when he realizes he's the reason for it.
Tony doesn’t tell him they pretty much have it all already He’s known Steve long enough to know he’ll never accept a single penny of Tony’s money-- not that it changes anything, because Tony’s going to have
“Not more than I’ve missed you,” Steve replies, and feels his entire body grow warm when Tony’s eyes darken, smile turning lewd.
"Hell of a way to put yourself out there." Tony takes a step toward him, and then another, until he has to tilt his head up to look at Steve. "Wanna clue me in on why you chose to ask me like that?"
But right now, they’re still kissing and Tony has no time for anything else because it’s hot and dirty and
Steve rolls his eyes, but doesn’t waste time in going over and joining the brunet. “You ever get tired of saying that?” he asks, even as he feels his cheeks flush from the bright, absolutely gorgeous grin Tony gives him.
But Barnes just shakes his head knowingly. “You two are a piece of work, I can’t believe you don’t see it– actually, scratch that, I
Tony’s grin is wider than it’s been in days, even though his eyes are barely open anymore. “You do that.”
“I know you are,” Tony says softly, listening to Steve’s low, steady breathing over the phone. His hotel suite feels emptier than it had just minutes ago, even though he’s been the only in there, and he knows the reason for it is thousands of miles away. “I miss you.”
“I’m gonna do a hell of a lot more than that,” Steve whispers, and times his breathing to the rise and fall of Tony’s chest.
But as fun as this new friendship is, Tony doesn’t forget how it started, and now there's a veritable clutter of all their jabs and jokes and poorly disguised innuendos for all the world to see:
Steve returns it with a grin of his own, but before either of them can say anything else, there’s a low, rough groaning from down the hall and seconds later, Tony stumbles in, all bleary eyes and tousled hair and grease-stained clothing.
“Tony, you know my Ma’s always happy to have you. I bet she’ll make plates of French toast when she finds you here in the mornin’,” Steve grins softly. His hair’s already tousled and matted from sleep, and really, Tony thinks as he settles in next to him, that’s an unfairly lethal combination.
The name sends a stab of pain up Tony’s chest-- not much different from how he’s felt in the last few hours-- but he pushes it down and forces his breathing to even out.
“Why are you on my floor at three in the morning, then?” Steve smiles, a small and fond thing that warms Tony all over.
,” Tony groans, winking when Steve pulls away to glare playfully. “Don’t look at me like that, Winghead.”
“Hey, hey,” Tony warns. “English or we walk, okay? Pass the kid along, Barnes, we don’t have all day.”
“Jesus,” Steve wheezes, eyes still warm and bright as they meet Tony’s again. “Are you always like this?”
“I want to go,” he’d told Tony. “Besides, an artist needs as much inspiration as he can get, right? I’m sure I’ll get into a good school with what I end up learnin’.”
“Especially when they’re about you, Shellhead,” Steve replies, and watches with rapt attention as the brunet’s cheeks flush a soft, gorgeous shade of pink.
“So,” Pepper sighs, stepping past Tony and into the main room of the Caesar’s Palace Presidential Suite. “Where is he?”
"Shhhh. You wake her up, and there'll be hell to pay-- what," Steve says, when Tony turns in his arms to bury his head on Steve's shoulder.
Tony leans in conspiratorially, and tries not to blatantly breathe in the scent of rain that he knows those broad shoulders are giving off. “Only with the gorgeous ones,” he winks.
“I’m good, I’m fine,” he nods, patting Steve’s shoulder with a practiced grin. “Go get ‘em, tiger, yeah?”
“Why are you here?” Steve asks gently, taking over Tony’s vacated seat and leaning forward. “Are you in danger? Is something wrong in… well, where you’re from?”
“No,” Tony says loudly, and finally sits up. There’s a tender quirk to his lips, and it makes something warm bloom in Pepper’s chest, something that feels like relief and hope. “It’s fine,” he finishes. “I wish I could see it.”
Steve pulls back until he can touch his forehead to Tony’s. “Wouldn’t be the least I’d ever do for you, Tony Stark.”
“Steve,” Tony says, voice echoing loud and sharp around them. “Steve, open your eyes. Look at me, Rogers.”
“Morning, sweetheart,” he whispers, running a hand through the brunet’s soft, sleep-tousled hair. “Up and at ‘em...”
Cap shakes his head again. He looks over his shoulder before speaking, and when Tony does the same, he can barely see Red and Buck huddled and whispering in the corner.
“Whatever you want, baby,” Tony replies. His hand is warm and firm in Steve’s. “I love you too, y’know.”
He can’t help the bright grin on his face as he looks for the salt and pours it into the now empty bowl, because Steve’s pretty sure he knows exactly how this is gonna go down, and he can’t wait to see Tony’s face.
“Talking to you.” The words are half muffle into a cushion, and Pepper smiles at the image of the brunet hiding his laughter into the couch. “Heard you’re having fun over there.”
From the corner of his eye, he sees Bucky and Sam bump fists, but the relief he feels in his chest almost drowns out everything else. “
Tony’s hand freezes inches from the doorknob, and when he turns back around, the woman’s eyes are as wild as he knows his own are.
"I told you you’d be fine,” Steve says, when he enters the kitchen with half a dozen bags hanging from his arms.
“You must be pretty relieved, though, right? At least they’re not around for you to disappoint anym–”
“Not as much as me,” Tony whispers back, so soft that Steve almost misses the words. “You sure I can’t convince you to come with me? You’ve never been to Argentina, right?”
“Sorry, didn’t mean to spring things on you-- I know I fucking hate it when they do it to me,” he smiles, ignoring the glares he gets from other parents at his language.
“Oh,” he breathes out, relief, embarrassment and surprise running through him all at once. Then he opens his mouth and–-
"You really should get back out there," he says, "you're a fucking horrible host, ignoring all these lovely people that came to see you finally become a legal adult, what’s wrong with you?”
“You’re both sickening,” Clint groans. “Shoulda known nothing’d change. Start the movie so I don’t have to listen to this shit, yeah?”
“No you’re not,” Steve shakes his head, words falling from his mouth like a flood. “You’re not replaceable, Tony, not to
But this time, the cold, sharp stab of terror that comes with the memories– every time, without fail, except
It’s ironic, really, because everyone’s at the Tower that night, settled into the living room and debating on what movie to pick.
“Oh, but you are,” Tony insists, bopping her on the nose until she giggles. “No school, being lazy, orange slices?” He picks one up and makes airplane noises as he brings it closer. “What could be better? Come on,
"You should see my studio right now," he interjects lightly, after a moment of hesitation, and knows it was the right thing to say when Tony visibly relaxes at the change of subject, the curve of his lips softening into something relieved and grateful.
Steve doesn’t jump out of his seat at the sound of Tony’s voice, but the relief that slams into his chest brings him to tears.
Steve pokes his daughter’s side until she giggles. “Definitely not as exciting as tea time with Little Miss Sunshine here, though.”
“Don’t think I could stop you from that even if I wanted to,” Tony huffs, smiling into Steve’s sweater as the blond laughs into his hair.
Steve doesn’t leave the bed like Tony’d been expecting. He doesn’t move at all, except to turn his body sideways until he’s facing Tony. “I need to say something first.”
“You could get into one right now with what you already have,” Tony had scoffed, and Steve’s laugh had been sweet and disbelieving and utterly
“‘e d-dared me t’take a picture,” Barnes mutters, miming the action a second later, “with Santaaaaa--”
“So you’re...” Pepper crosses her arms. “Tony, if there’s something going on, I need you to tell me. Don’t think I haven’t noticed this isn’t a new thing, and it doesn’t seem to be going away. SI needs to be prepared.”
But now, Tony thinks his heart might be breaking as he hears Steve’s broken plea, as he feels those warm, gentle hands gripping his own. He inches closer to the blond until their foreheads touch. “If you think I’d actually leave you right now,” he says, his own voice rough and shaky. “You’re so fucking wrong. You-- God, Steve, you don’t even have to ask.”
“More than you know,” Tony whispers, low enough that it doesn’t break the silence that settles around them once more.
“I know,” Tony replies proudly, and feels something in his chest grow warm when the blond’s smile softens as he looks at them both.
The tower feels empty in a way he immediately hates, even though his brain reminds him it’s anything but-- Sam, Wanda, Bruce, and Rhodey are still around, and he knows he’ll see them all at some point of the day. He fires off a quick pizza order to JARVIS-- not his usual, because he only eats that with Steve-- as he reaches his workshop, and it doesn’t take long for him to get lost in the numbers, the calculations and the equations, which is probably why he almost misses the bright blue sticky note clinging to DUM-E.
"Sweetheart, it's already up," Steve smirks, rolling his hips into Tony's, and the genius chokes on a laugh.
“Then trust me when I tell you you’ll always be worth it,” Steve says, lips brushing the side of Tony’s head, and Tony...
” he mimics, and the exaggerated pitch of his voice prompts a laugh out of Tony even as he rolls his eyes.
Tony lurches out of his seat with a silent gasp, almost tripping over his teammates’ feet as he staggers towards the hallway leading to the elevators. Through the rush of blood in his ears, he hears someone call his name, but it just serves to spur him faster.
Tony fights the urge to smile, and instead crooks a finger at his pint-sized Captain. His shoulders are heaving from chasing Steve all throughout the floor, but he thinks it might be worth it for the utter joy on the little blond’s face. “Last warning, Cappy bear.”
Steve leaps for his bedside table, coming back up a second later with a frantic nod, but it’s the tiny black box he holds in his hand that steals the remaining air from Tony’s lungs.
In the days since they returned from Las Vegas, the feeling’s become all too familiar, and Steve tries not to dwell too much on the voice inside his head telling him he could easily get used to it. “You don’t have to do this, y’know.”
“It’s okay,” Steve finally says, and then shocks Tony by letting out a soft, low laugh of his own. “So I’m your first, huh?”
But he doesn’t, because then Nat goes up and places hers right at the top of the little pile on Tony’s hands.
Steve bows his head, and then looks up at Tony from beneath long, gorgeous lashes. “You don't even know me.”
“So do I, y’know,” Tony whispers, eyes glassy and bright. “And if I have to take the hit so that you don’t have to, I’ll do it every fucking time.”
He’s relieved to see his daughter looking livelier than she’d been before, even smiling into Tony’s side as they sit bundled up on their bed.
“I know it’s not much,” Steve says shyly, holding out a large, warm hand to press his dog tags into Tony’s palms. “But I want you to have ‘em.”
“Nah,” Steve sighs, and his voice fades further and further the more he talks. “I’m going to stay here, anyway. I don’t think I can make it all the way up to my bed.”
Natasha just blinks. “We compromised,” she replies, and jerks her head to the other side of the room.
“Good,” Tony sighs, his relief almost pathetically evident in that one word. He takes the phone and adds his number in seconds, messaging himself to get Steve’s number. “Tomorrow sound good? I can get pizza.”
“Shut up!” Tony rasps, and he can barely talk around the lump in his throat, but he’s going to get this out if it kills him. “Did it ever occur to you that I do that for the same reasons? Ever think of that?
“Where’s duh pizza?” Clint asks, as soon as they corral their charges off the elevator and into the Stark Tower living room. “We wan’ pizza!”
“You’re hopeless,” Steve sighs, but he knows his smile-- the one that now matches Tony’s-- says otherwise.
The cat is cute, stumbling on top of his counter on his short, stumpy little legs, and those eyes-- big, green, and already too smart for his own good-- are almost too big for his face
Tony holds out his hand. “Stark. Tony Stark,” he says, and smiles at the warm, firm handshake he receives in turn.
“At least we’re better off than the other guy,” Tony says, grinning when the other man laughs and nods.
“There’s a bed callin’ our name, genius,” he finally breathes out, and Tony’s too tired to bother excusing the blush that floods his cheeks.
“Look who came to visit,” Natasha smirks, lounging on one of the couches beside her boyfriend; Clint’s smile is just as smug as hers, the bastard.
Tony can barely see through the tears in his eyes, but there’s no mistaking the gleaming band in the palm of Steve’s hand when he brings it up between them.
Steve feels like a veritable giant as he takes a mini muffin, holding it easily with his thumb and forefinger. “Blueberry, my favorite.”
“Why– Jesus… Hey, look at me,” Steve says, and even though it’s not harsh by any means, there’s something commanding in the way he says it that has Tony obeying. The blue eyes he finds looking down at him, burning with purpose and determination, make him breathless. “I’ll say it as many times as you need to hear, alright? You are our friend and we are yours. We care about you and worry about you, and we’re gonna do it forever. And if someone’s hurting you, you can bet your ass we’re gonna fuck them up–”
?” Steve asks his, lips now pressed to Tony’s forehead, and Tony feels the last clouds of doubt leave his body like breath in a storm.
Now here he is, three years later, and even though it’s far from an easy ride— he’s got the graying temples to prove it, and he wears them as well as fucking
“As long as it’s from Original Mario’s on 42nd,” Steve says, and Tony can’t smother the pleased sound that leaves him.
“Cuddle with me?” Tony asks again, the words softer and more hesitant this time. Even from across the room, Steve can see that every inch of his body is tense as a live wire, fists clenched tightly at his side.
“Can I have some?” Bucky plops down on the chair next to him, and smiles affectionately when Steve pushes his bowl at him. “Thanks, bud.”
, he’s said ‘fuck it’ a dozen times, so he writes the message and puts it down before his hands can start shaking.
“Hey!” Steve yelps, poking Tony’s side hard enough to feel through the layers he’s wearing. “Don’t be mean!”
From the corner they’re huddled in, Clint, Barnes, and Wilson let out matching groans, and by the time Tony catches Nurse Darcy trying and failing to hide her smile, he can feel the heat flooding his own cheeks.
“J-just like th-the p-plane… th’train… ‘M s’rry, Buck, ‘m sorry,” Steve whispers, a lone tear escaping the corner of his eye and falling down his cheek.
“God knows why,” Steve mutters, but his hand is soft in Tony’s as they leave the room. And if it lingers a second or two longer than usual, well, nobody’s complaining.
“And I know I’m a mess, okay? I know it’s not always easy to… to be with me. But for some reason, that I don’t think I’ll ever be able to figure out, you’re still here. And I love you more than anything on this fucking planet
“I’m a hell of a lot more than good, Captain. You’re welcome to find out how good,” Tony suggests, still grinning. This time, the glare he gets in return is a little less serious.
“JARVIS?” he calls out, and Steve jumps when the soft, English voice he’s heard for weeks is suddenly just
” Steve continues, and Tony almost brains himself on a table when he can hear the blond’s voice beyond the door.
He scrapes his knees and one of his arms, but they still don’t burn more than Steve’s cheeks do when he catches the other man grinning– all tousled hair and eyes so big and brown, Steve can see them all the way from where he stands.
Tony doesn’t exactly startle at Steve’s voice, but he turns to glare at the blond when some of his apple cider spills over the rim of his glass. “I’m gonna get you a fucking bell one of these days, I swear,” he sighs, and tries not to let his eyes linger too long on the breadth of Steve’s shoulders in his dark blue suit.
“Breathe,” Pepper orders, fingers never breaking their steady taps on her phone. “Why are you still in a bed?”
” Steve whispers against Tony’s temple, when the music fades back into silence, and Tony isn’t even going to deny the sudden burning in his eyes.
“It’s not easy sometimes, but... you make it better,” Steve says, so quiet, Tony can barely hear him.
“Eh, not a total loss, then,” he shrugs, sneaking a glance at Steve, who’s staring up at the sky with an adorably furrowed brow. “Don’t hurt yourself, Cap. You’ll get it. Eventually.”
Both of them look up at the new voice, Tony making grabby hands as the burly, suited man standing at the window. “Come to take me home, Happy?”
“Ugh, can y’maybe n’t t-talk ‘bout this now?” Barnes groans, pressing a shaky hand to his eyes. “Don’ wanna hear about y’guys...”
“I am,” Steve says, all earnest smiles and warm blue eyes, and Tony looks away to hide his burning cheeks.
“You gave me a home, Tony. So as much as I’ll love every second tonight, I’ll be just as happy when it’s over. When it’s just you and me again.”
“You’re gonna have to make more than one,” he says. “‘Cause I’m gonna need at least half as payment.”
Steve beams, and scoots just a little bit closer. “My Ma used to tell me that the one thing she prayed for the most, every night before she went to bed, was that I’d be happy. That I’d find something I loved to do, and find someone I’d be proud to love and be loved by. And it’s been… well, God knows it hasn’t been an easy road, but it’s been worth it, for what I have now.”
“Zip. It,” Tony hisses, eyes narrowed in concentration as he carefully spreads bright green frosting over one of the many Christmas tree-shaped cookies sitting in front of him, and Steve feels a rush of fondness run through him at the sight.
“True, but I don’t mind carrying you nearly as much,” the blond replies, sending him a quick wink over his shoulder.
“We’ve learned a thing or two from dealing with Starks and their inventions,” Coulson replies, setting the case down on the table. “Figured it wouldn’t be much different with you, Ma’am. Especially considering your… newly discovered connections.”
Tony nods. “Yeah, I know I’m rocking the whole ‘homeless scruff’ look, but I’m actually right next door, so... welcome to the neighborhood, gorgeous,” he winks.
When Tony wakes up on Christmas morning, he barely manages to not fall off the bed at the sight of two bright green eyes settled on a tiny face inches from his own.
Tony finally forces himself to look away, facing two other men lounging around in the chairs by the window, both of them grinning like children.
Prompt: “Maybe Tony and Steve being out in the city and it's the coldest night of the year. And there's some kind of explosion near them and it leaves them trapped under the rubble. They're okay, but they have to wait for the rescue team. But it's only getting colder and contrary to popular belief it's not Tony who handles it badly. Steve hates the cold and his trauma doesn't help, so Tony does everything to keep him warm, like giving him all his clothes and hugging him.”
“As long as you want me to,” Steve replies, and when his hand finds Tony’s, the cold feels a little farther away.
“You’re welcome,” Tony smirks, only to have his heart skip a beat when Steve turns to him, the now empty slider tray forgotten on the side.
“Doesn’t hurt that he shot up like a weed over the summer,” says a low, silky voice beside him, and he turns to find Natasha smirking as she looks out onto the field.
“Can’t think of anywhere else I’d rather be,” Steve says, and leans down to capture Tony’s lips with a smile.
“This isn’t much better,” Tony raises his eyebrows. “Who’re you up against? And don’t insult me by lying. You want my help, I’m gonna wanna know what you know.”
“I think I’d know if I was getting any from this,” Tony points at the blond, who blushes and hides his head in Tony’s shoulder.
Steve tells him, days later, about the job his mom’s friend gets for him as bag boy at the nearby supermarket, and how he’s going to start saving a quarter of every check. In two years, he says with a grin, they’ll have plenty for the trip.
“No, not you. Him,” Tony points at Blondie, whose eyes widen at the sudden attention. It’s so adorable, Tony wants to cry. “The rest of you can stay, but really, I don’t care what you do.”
“I know,” Tony replies around a lump in his throat, and then he smirks. “So... any desert after this?”
“You’re welcome,” Tony finally says, and revels in the sounds of his family’s happiness for the rest of the morning.
Pepper swats Tony’s arm as she giggles, climbing on the end of the bed to waggle her eyebrows. “Tell me about it?”
“Wh-- wait, what?” Tony breathes, and feels his heart skip a beat when Steve pulls out a folded paper from behind him. “Rogers--”
"Hey lovebirds!" This time, it's Rhodey calling them. "Food's going fast, so get your asses up and over here!"
“Moving a little quick there, aren’t you, sunshine?” Tony chuckles. “That’s still a long ways away.”
Tony lifts his head from Steve’s shoulder to meet his eyes. “Love you too, baby,” he says, and leans up to taste Steve’s grin with his own smiling lips.
“I said I’m in love with you,” Steve whispers, lips trembling and fists clenched at his side. The tears in his eyes hit Tony like daggers. “And I’m terrified.”
“Y’guys ever gonna take those things off?” Tony tugs the onesie-covered leg digging into his chest– he has no idea whose it is– and huffs out a laugh at the indignant yelp he gets in return. “There a reason you’re all in here? You hiding from Cap?”
“So I obviously didn’t think this through,” Tony admits, even as his heart does a little lurch of want when Steve just peppers Remy’s head with gentle kisses.
Steve’s voice breaks through the low, steady hum of the workshop, but Tony doesn’t even spare him a glance as the numbers on the screen in front of him fluctuate. “Yeah, sure, that’s true. But it’s called ‘eccentric’ when you’re my kinda rich.”
“Fuck yes,” Tony breathes shakily, letting Steve slide the ring onto his finger. “God, you... we’re really doing this?”
“Fun!” Thor screams from the back row, and when Rhodey echoes it with a happy cry of his own, Bruce giggles happily beside them. “Fun, fun,
“Weak, my ass,” Steve laughs. “Don’t tell me you’ve never wanted to go tree picking. And besides, we can’t keep them cooped up at home for too long,” he jerks his head behind them, where their currently de-aged teammates are tucked in the car carefully, seat belts fastened over their bright, puffy jacket-clad chests. “This’ll be fun for them.”
“And I thought you were over your self-sacrificing bullshit.” Steve’s voice is loud and hard, and despite Tony’s earlier resolve not to argue and end the night in the proverbial dog house, he looks up to meet cold blue eyes.
His eyes are wild and bright, and the only reason Steve’s heart isn’t breaking is because behind the veil of terror in those brown depths, he’s pretty sure he sees something like hope. “Tony--”
Steve’s lips quirk up into a tiny smirk, and with the aviators covering his eyes, as well as the familiar leather jacket framing his broad shoulders as he revs the motor of the veritable monster between his legs, he looks like something out of Tony’s wet dreams. “Scared, Stark?”
Tony makes an excited little noise when he hears the familiar voice getting closer, and almost jumps from his seat when the door opens and Pepper’s secretary comes in.
When they end the night trading numbers, and Steve can’t keep the smile off his face as they walk back home, he knows something’s happening. He knows it’s still new and he knows it’s too soon-- they hardly know about each other, and even though the attraction is there, the truth is that they’re barely friends-- but there’s a spark Steve hasn’t felt many times in his life, and he’s learned by now that not following your heart isn’t the best when you only live once.
“Nope,” Tony shakes his head, walking faster out the kitchen and down the hall. “I’m not gonna let you brainwash her.”
Because Steve still hasn’t forgotten every rejection from all the pretty dames back in the 40′s, hasn’t forgotten that he was never good enough, and even though he’s bigger now, and stronger and faster– even though he’s Captain America– maybe Steve Rogers still isn’t enough.
“Who the hell do you think you are, huh?” Steve growls. His fists are clenched at his side, even though all he wants to do is swing them at the boys in front of him.
“This feels momentous, man,” Clint cackles, rocking back in his seat as he grins. “Someone record this, yeah? Nat, where’s your phone?”
“Lost your train of thought, there?” Tony teases, and just like that, Steve’s mind clears up a little. He’s Captain America, the man with the plan, damn it.
“Of course you knew this would happen,” he groans, flopping down on the couch carefully and jostling his daughter until she’s a giggling, gurgling mess. “She’s as much of a goner for you as I am, isn’t she?”
And every time Tony wraps his arms around him during the day, every time Tony tells Steve he loves him, every time they make love to each other, Steve just can’t fucking forget those words no matter how hard he tries.
“Don’t fucking do that again,” Tony growls, barely resisting the urge to sweep the blond into his arms. It’d definitely be easier than usual. “Where are your meds, I know Bruce put ‘em all together for you–”
Steve tightens his arms around Tony’s waist. “Because no one else’ll put up with being used as your human pillow.”
Steve shakes his head, smiling as he gestures Tony further inside. “He wouldn't do that, would you, Jay?” He turns to the cat, who meows sweetly. “No, he's a good boy.”
jumble in his brain coming to a standstill. But then Steve makes a low, happy noise in the back of his throat, and it’s like a fucking
“I guess that’s what I get for standing next to you, though-- you should not look this good in a seventy year old uniform, Jesus Christ,” Tony groans, tugging at Steve’s sleeve as he hustles them through the crowded ballroom. “Faster, Rogers!”
“I’m kidding, Cap,” Tony gives him a familiar, charming grin, but the bandage wrapped around his chest blooms pink in more places than it ever should, so Steve can’t even summon a smile in return.
“I’m not lookin’ at ya any way, mister Stark,” Steve replies, that delicious Brooklyn drawl carrying across the room until Tony can all but feel it running down his spine like a gentle kiss.
“Alright,” Steve nods, and then waves at Pepper and Rhodey as Tony pulls him out of the library by the wrist.
Natasha’s lips are quirked up in one of her irritatingly gorgeous little smirks. “Gotta pay up, Stark.”
“Gosh, I’m feelin’ lightheaded and we’re already lyin’ down,” Steve giggles, all bright, wet baby blues and dimpled cheeks, and he’s the most beautiful thing Tony’s ever seen. “I’m not dreamin’, right?”
Tony closes his eyes, leans back against the chair. "I can wait. There's no rush," he says, and for now, it's the truth.
“Yes,” Tony replies just as quietly. There’s no panic, no fear, no doubt– it’s as easy as breathing.
,” Tony chuckles, finally picking up his finished product and presenting it to his husband. “Another one bites the dust.”
He spends lunch in one of the science labs, finishing up the rest of his Chem project just before the bell rings. But the door opens just as he’s putting his things away, and Tony stills at the sight of Tiberius Stone.
“Plus, we’ve got sleeping bags!” Steve points to a tiny pile in the corner of the living room, the only things they’d put in Tony’s car for the drive up to Cambridge. “And, uh,” he goes over to uncover a box, “and… your toaster. Tony, why is your toaster the only thing in this box?”
A chuckle climbs its way up Tony’s throat, leaving him before he can stop it, and he looks down at Natasha. “I don’t know whether to thank Loki, next time we see him, or kick his ass.”
“You bastard,” Tony giggles through his tears, breathless and warm all over. “You can’t just s-spring this kind of shit on me. I’ve got heart problems, babe.”
Tony opens his eyes– when the hell did he close them?– and even though he can barely breathe, he still summons up the courage to look back up at Steve through his eyelashes.
“Marry me,” Steve whispers against his lips, and the words run down Tony’s chest, into his body, his lungs, like the first breath of life.
“You come wif me?” Peter asks, and the way his voice quivers slightly makes Tony sweep him into his arms moments later, peppering kisses to his cheeks and hair.
“Sounds p-perfect,” Steve replies, voice firmer than it’d been seconds before, and Tony’s chest grows warm with determination.
“I know, honey.” The word falls from his lips without thought, but Tony can’t focus on anything else but the stillness of the man next to him. “But we gotta keep moving, Steve, gotta stay warm,” he says, even as he feels his own body grow colder by the second.
“Come on,” Steve says gently. Tony mumbles something he won’t remember in the morning, but feels his eyes drooping further and further by the second, and when his head touches the soft cushion on one end of the sofa, the last thing he registers is his own sigh of content, and warm, familiar fingers running through his hair.
,” Tony waves his hand in the direction of Steve’s face, and feels his lips quirk up into a grin to match the one currently being aimed his way.
– excuse me,” he calls the bartender, voice not much more composed than he feels. “Hi, yeah, um, can I get– can I have a towel, please, or two? My drink–”
“It’d serve you right, for wakin’ me up,” Steve gives him a weak glare, even as he’s clearly holding back a smile.
“How’s the paperwork?” Tony asks, and when Clint walks into his line of sight, the genius only nods at him before keeping up the steady taps on his tablet.
“Right,” Clint says, and in the heavy silence, it comes out louder than he’d probably meant it to. “As much as I think we’d fucking enjoy watching what’s about to happen–”
“You won’t have to,” Steve says, and Tony grins because oh, he knows that voice. “How’s fifty hours of community service?”
Steve just rolls his eyes, pokes Tony’s side, and relaxes further into the hammock. “Don’t make me laugh, Shellhead, else we’re gonna fall off this thing.”
But there’s no Howard at the ceremony; just his mom discreetly wiping away tears as he gives the speech he’s making up on the spot, and Jarvis, who holds up a camera and gives him a proud thumbs up as Tony accepts his diploma. It’s probably just as well, because Tony can’t imagine that his dad wouldn’t find a way to ruin everything.
Pepper’s on the large middle couch, the baby nestled comfortably in her arms as she rocks them both back and forth, but neither of them make a sound, even when Pepper’s eyes find his.
“I’m, uh, I’m sorry about this guy,” Blondie stutters, patting his dog’s head. “He’s a sucker for rainy days.”
“No, it’s… it doesn’t,” Tony stutters, and when he looks up, Steve’s surprised to see a bright blush on his cheeks. “Tell me about them?”
Steve’s blush is just as adorable in the dim light of the room they’re hiding in as it is any other time. “But I just…I don’t like to lose,” he says, and Tony almost leans in to kiss the pout off those gorgeous lips.
Now, two hours and one rant-filled debrief later, Steve hasn’t said anything since the doctor last came in the room, and Bucky would probably be a little more worried about him, but the doctor had assured them that the serum was already doing it’s work. He’s just glad for the silence that lets him think clearly again.
“The correct answer, though, is ‘yes, dear’– not a good way to start out this marriage, babe. Hasn’t even been a day, and you’re already slacking off.”
“Oh, that’s... thank you,” Steve breathes, and he’s suddenly looking at Tony like he hung the moon and stars up for him.
“It’s Christmas Eve, where else would I be?” is all he says, careful not to jostle Tony too much as he arranges their bodies to fit together, and breathes in relief when he’s not pushed away. “I’m not goin’ anywhere.”
It warms Tony’s chest just as much as the first note did, and when he puts it in his pocket as he leaves his room, he feels something close to anticipation.
– rubs the back of his neck shyly. There’s a delicious blush on his cheeks, and Tony feels his heart skip a beat. “Um…”
Steve pulls away with another nod, and wraps both arms around his middle. “Don’t worry ‘bout me, Shellhead.”
“That’s... that’s pretty neat. Can I, um...” Steve rubs a hand over his head, but doesn’t look away. “It’s okay if you say no, I don’t want to, um--”
Steve familiar smirk looks even more adorable on his smaller, younger-looking face, and he squares his thin shoulders as far as he can. “I’m gonna make you eat your words, Stark.”
“You’re about to meet Uncle Asshole, baby,” Tony sighs, then yelps when Steve smacks his shoulder. “Don’t drop her, Barnes.”
, tell’m-- tell’m why,” he says loudly, and then grunts when Rhodey stumbles into his back. “Rhod-- tell’m!”
"If you say so,” Steve says, and Tony doesn’t have to look up to know that he’s grinning again. “And don’t snore, okay?”
There’s something in Tony’s voice when he replies, that Steve might almost call wistful. “There’s always something.”
“If you say so, genius,” Steve laughs, warm and fond and so blatantly smitten, it’s almost embarrassing; luckily, their team returns before either he or Tony can acknowledge it. “Right, so, first thing’s first... this was
“Tony Stark, I’ve been yours from the second we screamed out insults at each other in that Hellicarrier, and I’m gonna be yours till my dying breath. But in the meantime, I’m kinda hopin’ you’ll say yes.”
"Sweet Mary," Steve sighs, fingers tightening around Tony's as they're led to the only occupied cell in the station.
Steve gives him an unimpressed look, but squares his shoulder a moment later. “My mug...” he says, pointing at the middle cupboard shelf. “It’s... I can’t...”
The circle flashes again– brighter this time, if that’s even possible– and Tony faces his daughter with a thundering heart.
Bundled up against Steve’s chest with a worn, well-used blanket settled around them as they sit on the balcony of what will soon be their former bedroom, it’s easy to finally let out the words he’s been wanting to for days.
“You can bet we’ll be doin’ it a lot more often after tonight,” Steve says, as resolutely as the firm, steady beat of the heart Tony’s hand is pressed over.
“Oh shit, you’re hot.” Bright blue eyes widen in surprise, and Tony feels a shiver of delicious pleasure run through him when they not so discreetly check him out. “I said that out loud, didn’t I?”
“I like the sound of that,” he whispers, and when he feels the whisper soft touch of Steve’s fingers on the back of his neck, he’s helpless to stop the smile that breaks through.
“Jury’s out on the crazy part, handsome,” Tony replies, smirking as the delicious flush on Blondie’s cheeks spreads down beneath the collar of a shirt announcing “FREE CUDDLES” in bright yellow font. The man’s a walking wet dream.
,” Clint says, but when Tony looks over his shoulder at him, the archer’s eyes are fixed on him, knowing and smug and utterly unbearable.
,” Tony finally says, once his laughter tapers down to those rare, joyous giggles Steve knows few people in the world have ever gotten to witness.
“Bet you w-wouldn’t refuse one r-right about n-now, though…” Steve closes his eyes, and leans his head against the wall as he curls into himself a little bit more.
“Clint, don’t be an ass,” Steve says calmly, but Tony doesn’t miss the faint blush on his cheeks. “And you,” he pulls Tony’s sleeve, “sit back down before they throw us out again–”
and this is Tony's: http://www.uglychristmassweater.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/merry-christmas-naughty-ugly-sweater.jpg
“Aside from the fact that he’s the Captain, and it’s my fucking tech?” Tony all but snarls. “What could possibly be more important than that?”
Tony’s pretty sure he’s about to combust when he reaches the winking face at the end, but Rogers just laughs and returns to his students, and Tony tries to get his mind out of the gutter and back into his head.
Tony’s holding a freshly showered and pajama-clad Natasha in his arms, leaning against the bathroom door as Steve lifts Bruce from the tub, the little brunet bundled in a dark green towel as he’s set back down on the fluffy bathroom rug.
“Uh huh,” Tony nods, lips quirking up into a easy grin. “My favorite pillow’s a no-show, but I get by. You?”
“Just sit there and look pretty, Cap,” says the other firefighter, a dark-skinned man with one of the friendliest smiles Tony’s ever seen. “Let the good doc take care of ya.”
“Well that’s ‘cause she’s a good girl,” Tony replies. “They’re gonna fall over themselves right now, just you watch.”
“Yes, okay, this is designer, but don’t even tell me you’re not dying to put her in it. The team’s going to lose their shit.”
“You kiddin’ me?” Steve sits up so fast, he almost gets vertigo. “What did ya think we were gonna do?”
“Every last one of us. The Howling Commandoes still have a handful of members from the old days. He’s after them, and anyone related to those not around anymore. I’ve got a target on my back because of Erskine, and,” the Captain pauses, eyes dark and focused, “we think you might have one too.”
“Charmer,” Steve sighs, pressing his lips to the tip of Tony’s nose, and even with Tony’s blood still burning and singing beneath his skin, he feels his heart give a bright, sappy lurch.
Pepper hears Natasha faintly swearing in Russian, the sound of a brief scuffle, and then Steve’s low hesitant voice. “
Steve’s grin is a wide, pleased, gorgeous thing. “Not such a bad thing, is it?” he asks, tightening his arms to bring them even closer together.
“Small mercies, Pepper pot,” Tony laughs, just as the elevator doors open and Steve Rogers steps out, duffel bag in his hands and standing in full Captain America uniform.
Steve smiles down at the big brown eyes looking shyly up at him. He manages to ignore the amused snickering from Buck, Sam and Clint, the knowing quirk of Natasha’s lips, and most importantly, the flush he can feel spreading across his cheeks and down his neck. “I’m glad you think so,” he says softly, pulling Tony up to sit on his lap, and feels his chest grow even warmer when the tiny brunet settles against him with a happy sigh.
Unfortunately, he remembers he’s still human when he has to tear his mouth from the good Captain’s to come up for air. The blond leans forward to follow his lips, eyes wide and dazed and the most perfect shade of blue
Steve’s giggling into his pillow by now, with only the corner of his gorgeous grin peeking out to send Tony’s heart into flutters. “
Clearly Pepper does too, because she lets out a fond sigh and rolls her eyes. “I guess there’s no use anymore, is there?”
A soft pat on his knee makes him look down, however, and he finds Natasha’s bright, green eyes looking up at him.
“Takes after her old man,” Tony mutters, but leans in to press a press a kiss to their daughter’s soft hair, relishing the happy little squeal she gives him in return.
“S-sorry,” his boyfriend gasps, shoulders heaving a couple of times before he straightens back up. “Shit, I’m--”
“I hate you,” Tony growls, wincing as he spots Sam jumping off the couch and onto one of the many beanbags scattered around the room. “I hate you so much right now.”
“You bastard,” Tony sputters, looking down at his now drenched t-shirt, droplets of ice cold water running down his chest. “You fucking
Tony shakes his head. “Why bother? We’re sure as fuck not going to stop going out, and as long as we do, they’re going to keep printing shit like this. It doesn’t help when you step out the Tower wearing an Iron Man shirt.”
Steve runs over to him after, Mrs. Rogers and everyone else trailing behind him like little baby ducks. "You did good,” he says, grinning, and Tony feels genuinely happy for the first time all day.
“He’s cute, y’know,” Natasha says softly, and Steve flushes at how indiscreet she’s being as she stares. “Don’t you think he’s cute, Rogers?”
“I was… I was getting a little worried about you, y’know,” Tony whispers, and runs his thumb over Steve’s cheeks. “Your eyes haven’t been as blue lately.”
. He lets out a giggle that turns to a laugh, that turns into great, big guffaws that leave him breathless and crying into the counter.
“Do you love me?” Steve asks, and Tony can only nod. “Because I love you more than I’ve ever loved anything or anyone, and as long as I’m breathin’, that’s never going to change. I promise.”
“Hi, baby,” the blond says, but Tony just pulls him into the room and kisses the smile off those lips.
for knockin’ me out,” Tony pats his flushed cheek. Sam laughs harder, and Pepper rolls her eyes. Bucky just rolls his eyes, and taps Steve’s shoulder.
“Call me Maria, please. The only person who still calls me ma’am is Edwin Jarvis. Tell me, Antonio, is he still around?”
“You better. I don’t throw my plans away for anyone else, big guy,” Tony says, just as he steps back to pull open the box and pull out the ring nestled inside. “I can’t believe I’m giving this to you in our pajamas, Christ...”
Bucky and Pepper are still tied at the hip, so much so that Steve starts to wonder if his brother might have crush on her. But when he asks him, Bucky just shakes his head, and climbs on the couch next to him.
They keep whispering after that, but Bucky doesn’t bother trying to make out what they say anymore, but he falls asleep feeling lighter than he has in a long time.
It's a tweet that says: "*Man walks into bar covered in kiss marks* haha yeah well you should see the other guy". ;)
He looks up from where he’d been staring at those tiny number visible through the thin white tee Steve’s wearing, and meets those blue eyes he loves so much. “Hmmm?”
Steve’s voice as he says goodbye follows him long after they’ve lost sight of each other, but Tony’s not even a block away before his phone dings in his hand.
“Uh huh,” Tony says carefully, eyes locked on the wrapped box in front of him as he sticks out a finger in Steve’s direction. “
From her perch on Tony’s arms, Natasha whimpers in displeasure at being woken up, and Tony runs his fingers through her silky locks without hesitation. “Shouldn’t’ve been awake at the ass crack of dawn just to wake me up via heart attack,” he says, but it comes out more like a coo than anything else. “Don’t you want to open your presents now? You can sleep some more later, hmm?”
“Anthony Edward Stark,” Steve growls, splashing spaghetti sauce in the immediate vicinity as he drops the wooden spoon he’d been holding straight into the pan. “What the hell did you do?”
“Shut up and get cookin’, Betty Crocker,” he grins, and revels in Steve’s yelp when he smacks his ass.
Only the smallest glimmer of recognition lights those baby blues, but Steve just smiles. “Guess you were one of the smart ones, huh, stayin’ in here?”
, you– I know you never wanted anyone else to know but I don’t know what else to do, I don’t know how else to convince you–”
“It’s not too early to back out.” The words are painful to say, but Steve meets Tony’s eyes and doesn’t look away.
“Oh shit.” The words are out before Natasha can smother them, and it’s only the fact that these people around her are the only ones she trusts her life to, that keeps her from running out the room because
“Whatever,” Tony waves his hand, “or one of those dolls with the smaller dolls inside! We can find the creepiest one, it’ll be awesome.”
“That’s what he said,” Tony snickers, then he’s laughing into Steve’s shoulder and Steve is laughing into Tony’s hair, and it’s not really any more funny than some of the things he usually says, but Steve can’t help the warmth and love that bubbles up inside every time he sees Tony happy.
“I can’t help it,” Steve says simply, shrugging those indecently broad shoulders into the corner of Tony’s worn out couch. He’s stretched out all the way from end to end, six plus feet of absolute perfection, and when Tony’s heart gives a pathetically happy little pang, he barely manages to trample the urge to march over and climb on top of all those comfortingly familiar muscles.
“Hush, you,” Steve jostles him. “It didn’t bother me, most times. I had Bucky and my Ma, and I drew and read, and baked. But sometimes, I used to sneak out the house at night, and I’d climb on the roof and stay there for a couple of hours, with my blankets. I used to look up at the stars, and… I’d feel like I could be anything.”
“‘m hungwy,” Tony says, and Natasha smiles yet again at the familiarly determined set of Steve’s tiny jaw as he looks up as well.
Tony wants to ask him if he thinks all of this is worth it. If he thinks Tony’s worth it. He wants it so much, it almost hurts.
“Watching you hold that long, thick... axe,” Tony winks, helpless against the smile that breaks out on his face as Steve’s laughter grows louder. “Oooh, baby, that’s sounding better and better by the minute!”
“Yeah?” Steve whispers, eyes wide and happy and the most perfect shade of blue that will ever exist, and Tony knows he’s going to remember this moment for as long as he lives.
Tony doesn’t say a word as Clint leaves the room, muttering as he goes, but looks up when Sam pats his shoulder as he follows.
“It’s not like we wanna keep her,” Bucky grins. “Babies ain’t always a walk in the park– we just get the fun parts.”
Steve obeys with a smile, only to hold out his spoon again less than five minutes. “Awwow! Tony, hawk!”
“Where is he?” he asks, shaking his head when Fury opens his mouth. “Save it. I don’t care if he’s still–” he can’t say it… “if he’s not awake.”
Tony’s pretty sure the whole damn world’s got nothing on this man because Christ on a fucking cracker, this is the most beautiful human being Tony’s ever seen.
“Y’know, I feel like half the time we spend together is just you telling me what to do,” he sighs, and waves the phone in his hand as he stumbles to his bedroom.
“Sweetheart,” Steve puts his coffee mug down gently. His eyes are the most earnest thing Tony’s ever seen. “You are not old.”
“I think we’ve already established that you don’t have a choice,” he replies, giving himself a second to lean against Steve’s shoulder before pulling away. “Go get ‘em, tiger.”
“I saw how you couldn't stop looking at her, and… God, I fell in love with you all over again. And I know it might be too early to be talking about–”
, Tony wants to say; he wants it so much, it almost hurts. But instead, he just lets his lips quirk up into a soft, rare smile.
“Yeah,” is all Steve can say, feeling oddly out of breath even though he’s barely moved, and he wills his hands not to shake as they clean up the small puddle in front of him.
“Not the egg, you moron,” Tony hisses, and gives in to the urge to cradle his own egg closer. “Where’s
“There is something seriously wrong with them,” Tony says, snuggled against Steve in a corner of Natasha’s living room hours later. The rest of their friends are all scattered around the room, drinking and talking and playing, and it’s almost enough to distract him from the garish ribbon across Steve’s chest proclaiming him the ‘
But Steve just wraps an arm around Tonys shoulders, and leads him after their team. “That makes two of us.”
“Tony!” she all but yells, louder than she’d intended but apparently enough to be heard through the chaos.
“Oh, I’m definitely not complainin’,” Steve says, voice low and rough as he walks up by the counter beside Tony. “I kinda like the sight of you in ‘em.”
he’s grinning, even though she can’t see his face. “He’s handsome, witty, and cool as fuck. A lot like me, actually.”
His breathing is so soft, Tony can barely hear it, and he feels a heavy weight settle in his stomach. “Gotta stay with me to watch, though. Wanna bet Thor finds us first?”
“That sounds about right,” she ribs him, tossing him the balloon she’s just finished tying up and laughing when it manages to hit him right on the forehead.
“Jus’ m’head,” he says, and he’s trying to ignore the brooding man next to him, he really is. But that face...
Tony lets go of Steve with a kiss to his jaw, and crouches down before their daughter. “Well, see, he doesn’t actually have a name.”
A touch on his arm finally makes him look away– only for a little while, though– until he meets Steve’s fond gaze. “You’re asking me if you can hold our daughter?”
Steve’s laughter echoes beneath Tony’s hand, happy and warm and everything Tony feels when it comes to Steve. “So definitely no more Monopoly on game nights, okay?” he says.
“Hey, Barnes!” Clint’s voice echoes from the living room. “If you can’t even do this one job– ow! What the hell, Nat? Why are all of you jerks? Hey, stop hogging the spawn!”
“Not a chance, hot shot,” he replies, just as they enter the room holding the rest of their teammates. “Make some space for this one, will you? And if you wake one of them up, I swear to G–”
“Hey, hey,” Steve brings a hand to tip Tony’s chin up, and offers a tiny smile when their eyes meet. “It’s okay. You didn’t interrupt anything.”
“I’m... used to a schedule. You’d probably have to tie me to the bed to keep me in it,” Steve says without thinking, and it’s only when Tony’s whole body starts shaking with the force of his laughter that he realizes what he’s said. “Shut up, you know I didn’t...”
His eyes are soft and earnest, and Tony finds he can barely meet them. The warmth that’s been furling in his chest since they pulled out of Ma Roger’s driveway only hours ago grows and spreads all over, until he’s sure his cheeks are redder than they’ve ever been. “Just flip the coin, you meatball,” he sighs, more gently than he’d expected. “We’re burnin’ daylight.”
"I can't hear you over the sounds of me being the best mom," Tony sends, only to fall silent a second later as he seems to realize what he's said. His eyes are bright with wonder and awe as he runs a thumb over the slightly crooked border on Thor's card, and Steve wonders, for a moment, if a heart can shatter from happiness.
“You guys are insane,” Steve chuckles, shaking his head fondly. The smile hasn’t left his face, and Tony’s helpless to return it with one of his own.
“Was there someone inside?” Tony interrupts, and feels something in his chest tighten when Coulson nods.
“Steve,” he thinks he says, but when it doesn’t end up sounding right in his head, he tries again. “
“She’s, uh... well, she’s-- she’s not here, sweetheart.” The name slips out before he realizes, but it doesn’t stop the pang in his heart when Steve looks up at him with tired, confused baby blues.
“Captain Rogers here, Ms. Potts,” she says, a faint blush covering her cheeks, and her eyes follow Steve when he walks past her and into the office.
Steve looks down at Tony, and is relieved when all he can find in his eyes is fond amusement. “Only a penny?”
“So?” Tony asks, and thank god his voice sounds normal, because he sure as hell doesn’t feel it. Should his heart be beating this fast?
“Now look at mine,” Tony smiles, but it’s the one Steve likes least-- brittle and thin, razor sharp. And when he looks back at the sheet in Tony’s hand, he sees why.
“Bruce and I lost track of time down in the lab, and then Reed popped in and started running his smug mouth, like he always does, and by the time we snapped out of it, it was over-- fuck, that bun is sounding better with every second.”
“Hey, there,” he whispers, tucking her into his chest without hesitation when she nuzzles into his bicep. “You done with your card?”
“I like to think you’d be a little more careful if we ever had one,” Steve replies, and Tony looks away to hide the hitch in his breath.
“Zip it, Shellhead,” Steve laughs, and when he leans in to kiss Tony again, this time on his temple, Pepper’s grin feels easy as breathing.
! Someone’s moaning but Tony doesn’t care because he’s still pressed up against all that delicious muscle, his knees going weak as Steve practically mauls his mouth.
“Okay,” is all Steve says, bright eyes filling with tears, and with the sound of the rain still echoing around them, he kisses the smile off Tony’s face with a happy laugh.
Mr. Rogers— and really, Tony has no shame, so he’ll gladly admit he’s spent a number nights with his hand on his cock and that name on his lips— is definitely an incentive for getting up early in the morning.
But when he goes back to his workshop, he loses himself in the numbers and the theories, and while Steve never leaves his mind– he’s been a constant presence there for longer than Tony’s ever willing to admit– everything else gets lost behind his work.
“Pass her over, then. Come on,” Steve makes grabby hands, but smiles when Tony just tightens his arms around their sleeping daughter.
singer–- and the tempo rises and rises; in seconds it feels like the whole room is just bursting from the music.
“He never stopped looking, y’know,” Tony says. “I don’t think he ever cared about anything half as much as he cared about finding you.”
“Tony Stark, look at me, goddammit,” Steve growls, just like Tony’d done down there, and he’s helpless to fight it. “I’m sorry–”
“Figures,” Steve mutters under his breath, and only winks when Tony huffs at him even as his hands curve over the little cards in a trembling hold.
“Don’t bullshit me,” he says, but he’s careful to say the words gently, and when Tony doesn’t kick him out, he just keeps cutting. “You’re almost as obvious as he is.”
Tony’s smile is gone faster than he can blink. “Did he now?” he asks, and feels proud when the words come out steady. The cold that had slowly been seeping away come back with a vengeance, just like it always does when Howard’s involved. Twenty years gone, and the bastard still won’t leave Tony alone.
“Natasha?” Bruce asks softly, as concerned as the concerned looks Steve and Tony turn her way. “You okay?”
“Doesn’t have to be,” Tony whispers, stumbling towards the door. “Comin’, Cap?” He asks over his shoulder.
“Where are you?” Steve asks, already walking to the door. “Tony, tell me where you are, I’m already on my way--”
“I have two already, Tony, and they’re old. This one’ll be rowdy soon, I can’t keep him-- no matter how cute he is. I already have enough company,” she says, shaking her head, and there’s a sudden gleam in her eyes that he doesn’t like one bit.
“No!” Barnes almost yells, and stands up with an impish gleam in his dark eyes. “No, I’ll do it, you just-- you stay here.”
“Sleep,” he says, “and tomorrow, my Ma will make us some pancakes and I’ll show you my new comic ideas.” His voice is the softest thing Tony’s ever felt, and the cushions under his cheek smell like apples, cinnamon and Steve.
“Have some toast, first,” the blond says, reaching behind him to bring a plate of bread, and bumping it against Tony’s shoulder.
Every one of them is up early, which is serendipitous in Tony’s case, and strategically planned on everybody else’s.
“Yes, Mr. Coulson,” they mumble, but when they leave the room, Steve only feels the warm tendrils of anticipation.
“God, I hate it when you fight dirty,” he grumbles, pulling away from Steve’s hold to set his tumbler down on the empty counter before stepping back into the blond’s space, this time face to face. “We could’ve been all tucked in and sprawled out on our insanely expensive, custom made California king by now..."
Steve looks over his shoulder at the sound of James Rhodes’ voice, soft and tired in a way that he’s never sounded in all the times Steve’s met him.
“Y’think?” Clint mutters. He still hasn’t moved from the floor, though, so Tony ignores his grumbling. “This is nauseating.”
“We’ve got a new owner’s checklist at the counter,” Steve tells him. “Ask my friend Bucky, he’ll help you out.”
“I’d apologize,” Tony rasps, wincing as he moves each arm and leg, “but I’m just too damn tired to be sorry.”
“Then you’ll get better at it. Having something to take care of will teach you some responsibility.”
“And I thought those baby blues were perfect on you before? Well shit, handsome,” Tony drawls, grinning when Steve covers said eyes with his hand. “They’re even more of a showstopper now.”
Sharon sniggers into her vest, and then Steve starts laughing so hard he’s almost doubled over. His hair is inches away from Tony’s fingers, and
“Told you,” Tony hears Rhodey mutter behind him, and can’t keep his lips from quirking up as Steve obviously hears him too, cheeks growing pinker by the second.
“Oh, don’t even try that with me,” Tony says fondly, leaning up to wipe the pout off Steve’s lips with a short, sweet kiss. “There’s no one else I’d put up with this for, and you know it.”
“You can’t ignore everything that’s going on,” Steve explains, and steps closer to him. “The bright, the black– the good and the bad, it’ll always be there. But so will everything you did.”
He sees Natasha and Bruce next, and Clint a couple of feet away, then he steps further into the room and finally… there’s Steve, stopping mid pace, right in front of the floor to ceiling glass windows that give them the best view in the city.
“Tony,” she sighs, “I told you last time— the District hasn’t budged over on your proposal to ‘improve’ the school buses so that they look like
“Sorry,” the blond wrinkles his nose a little, pulling at the fabric like it could possibly dry itself and grow large enough to cover him. “I thought I’d, uh, get the chance to make it back home in time, but I-- I guess didn’t.”
Tony has one hand at the base of the Captain’s neck and the other gripping the lapel of his leather jacket before he knows it, and then he’s giving as good as he’s getting.
They all share knowing looks as Tony’s smile softens at Steve’s defense, offering him half of his last cookie, and when Steve accepts it with a giddy grin of his own, Natasha finds there’s nowhere else she’d rather be.
“‘Cause I know I’m pretty much half dead by the time you go off on your disgusting little runs, but right now I’m seriously debating whether or not you’re actually awake–”
Steve’s laughing so hard he can’t say anything in response, and Tony’s gonna need to learn how to calm his heart because Jesus Christ, this man is going to kill him.
“Well yeah, obviously,” Tony scoffs, and then it’s his turn to grin again when Steve rolls his eyes and lets out a chuckle. Ellie yips in what Tony decides to take as agreement, and from his spot at Steve’s feet, Remy watches them all with his tail wagging contently.
“Finish your pizza first,” Tony replies. “And you don’t need to hide everyone’s crust in your pocket, kid. We can just order more later.”
“Who wouldn’t?” Tony giggles. “Besides, I wouldn’t mind posing for you again. It’s always so much...
“It’s just snow,” he says, and if it comes out a little breathlessly, it’s just because of the cold.
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Steve finds himself smirking, even as his heart skips a beat when the man just raises an eyebrow.
“Like hell I am,” Tony says, waving a hand down at the cookies. “What the fuck would I do with all these?”
The clear, blue sky, golden sun gleaming over the New York skyline, and his red and gold figure flying straight into the black hole in the middle of it all.
The contrast between them-- his dark eyes, hair and coat, to the pale, firm curve of Steve’s jaw, and the way his hair shines like gold from the sun-- is striking. Absolutely beautiful.
Steve shakes his head, and reaches out to brush his fingers against Tony’s hand. “I’m not Steve Rogers without Tony Stark.”
Tony doesn’t bother lifting his head from Steve’s shoulders. “I guess it’s... nice. If this is your kind of thing,” he says, looking out at the vast forest spread out beneath the cliff they’re sitting on. The sunrise is softer than he’d expected, tempered by the cloudy sky above, and despite the winter morning chill, he feels very little outside the arm pressing him to the blond’s side. “You could totally rock the whole rugged, mountain man thing, y’know.”
It’s one of the most adorable thing’s Tony’s ever seen, and even as desire hits him like lightning in his gut, it’s the soft, warm tendrils of affection that surprise him.
“How’d you get so good at Monopoly?” Tony mumbles, lips brushing Steve’s shoulder with every word. The sound of their team’s laughter is a warm bubble around them as they lie across the main couch in each other’s arms.
“Shit,” Tony sniffles, buries his face into Steve’s neck and takes a shaky breath. Then another. “Shit, shit, shit.”
“The VA Clinic in Brooklyn,” Steve answers, after a short pause. “My best friend’s there, and…” he clears his throat, eyes going bright with emotion. “They need as much help as they can get down there.”
“Hey, Steve,” Pepper waves over Tony’s shoulder. Rhodey’s grin is knowing all over again, but Tony ignores him to turn and meet Steve’s eyes.
“Right, sorry,” Steve says sheepishly, cheeks a delicious shade of pink as he throws on his coat. “I’m gonna run down to my room to get my things, alright? I’ll be back in five.”
“Buck,” Steve sighs, and bless his heart, he isn’t even trying to hide his amusement. “What happened?”
Steve finally pushes himself off the bike, and lets go of Tony’s wrist to wrap his arm around Tony’s shoulders. “I’ll take care of ya,” he says, mouth brushing Tony’s temple as they make their way to the school’s entrance. “Promise.”
, and Tony can’t hold back the groan when his bottom lip is taken in again, licked and sucked and fucking
It’s loud and more than a little off-key, but as Tony drives further into the cold, quiet forests of Pennsylvania, he thinks there are worse things he could be stuck listening to.
“How’re you feeling, then?” Tony asks, trying to keep himself from staring at the baby blues before him. It’s a lost cause. “Any dizziness? Nausea? Anything?”
Seconds continue to pass silently– broken only by the faint sound of their breathing and the soft rustle of fabric every time one of them makes even the smallest of moments– but eventually, Tony lets out a deep sigh.
“Why did you do it?” he croaks, one hand moving to cover the darkest stain of blood on his shirt, where he’d pressed his chest against Steve’s. “Why the fuck did you do it, you idiot? I have enough blood on my hands without… without having yours.”
,” Tony rasps, blinking before the sudden sting in his eyes can turn into tears, and breathes through the wave of love that fills his chest until he can barely breathe. “How could I not have a good time, huh? You’ll be there.”
“Guess you’re gonna have to sell some of them properties you’ve got,” Steve points to the corner of the board Tony owns. “So what’ll it be? Pennsylvania Avenue, maybe?”
Steve hums affirmatively, and tightens his arms around his new husband’s waist. “A fella could get used to spendin’ all day like this.”
Blondie grins. “Thanks. And anyway, I just... well, I thought it’d be nice to... maybe someone here needed the support today, and if I could give ‘em a bit of a boost, I’m more than happy to.”
Most of them– Barnes, Wilson, Clint, Natasha– are sitting on the long line of stools along the large island, with Bruce leaning against the refrigerator, and Steve…
Steve nods. “Toast?” he asks tentatively, voice as soft as the morning light coming in from the large windows. It feels a little like ceasefire, and for the first time since their little Hellicarier fight, Tony accepts it.
By the time those blue eyes rise to meet Tony’s, they’re bright and playful, and Tony does nothing as Mr. Rogers moves to grab the bright blue stack atop his desk. With that sweet smile still on his face, he quickly writes a message of his own and puts the note—in all its curly, elegant writing— right next to Tony’s:
“It was annoying,” Steve says. His voice is warm and playful, though, so Bucky doesn’t buy it. “All the pictures you sent made up for it, though.”
Steve looks up from his sketchbook with a smile, eyes eagerly moving in the direction of Tony’s voice, only to frown when he finally sees the brunet. “What’s wr–”
“Back atcha, big guy,” Tony says, and lets out a long, heavy breath when he feels Steve lean in and press a kiss to his forehead.
“Can you just…” Steve trails off, putting the frosting down to glare at his friend. His heart gives a tiny lurch when he thinks about Tony’s bright, gorgeous eyes, his mischievous smirk that leaves Steve breathless. “I can’t,” he whispers morosely.
He takes advantage of his early rising-- it’s a habit he’s not sure he’ll ever unlearn, no matter how tempting it is when Tony, soft and warm from sleep, purrs at Steve to
Steve leans in towards Tony, brushing shoulders as they eat their own slices. “You’re good with ‘em.”
“Bossy, bossy, bossy,” Tony tuts, and hopes to God no one can see the blush he can feel growing across his face when they turn to face each other on the dance floor.
“Yeah?” Tony asks, voice small and brittle, and Steve wants to hurt every person who’s ever made him feel that way.
“Seriously, Steve... Isn’t there-- isn’t there anything you wanna do here? I’ll... just, just say the word. I’ll make it happen. What do you want?”
Tony moves past the table, laden with plates of steaming food and ice cold beer bottles, and steps close into Steve’s space. “Well, ain’t you a sweetheart,” he purrs, wrapping his arms around the blond’s neck to press their bodies together.
In the midnight silence of the Stark Tower living room, Tony’s low, tired voice sounds louder than it really is, and Steve turns away from the New York skyline in time to see him plop down into the couch. “Hey, Shellhead.”
,” he hisses, ignoring the stutter of his heart as Tony loses it all over again, jostling Natasha with every heave of his shoulders. “Jesus...”
“You cannot be serious,” Steve jumps up, eyes suddenly blazing with fury. “Tell me you don’t mean that.”
His daughter is no longer wearing a beanie, and her blond, downy head shines like gold in the dim light around them. Her gurgles are low but happy, and when her wide eyes meet his, they widen in recognition as she squeals in joy.
I buy my baby everything, Steve?” Tony cocks his hip, work completely forgotten in favor of the argument he can see coming.
Steve crouches until he’s eye level with her. “Hello, Pepper. It’s lovely to meet you,” he holds out his hand, and she shakes it with a grip surprising strong for a five year-old.
“Awww, brownie cake,” Tony grins. “I always knew you wanted to get all up on this,” he gestures to himself, chuckling when Natasha tug his collar a little too hard. “But you snooze, you lose! Only Cap gets to tap this ass now–”
“Why can’t they see how much you do?” Steve’s voice breaks with so much rage and heartbreak, it almost brings Tony to tears. “Why is your worth even a question?”
“Oh Captain, my Captain,” he purrs, turning his body in a wanton stretch against the chair with more aplomb than he feels. He grins lewdly, and Red clears her throat around what Tony thinks might be a strangled laugh. The Captain, though…
“Merry Christmas,” is all he can say back, lips quirking up into a helpless smile as Steve continues to be trampled by little pudgy paws.
“A man after my own heart,” Tony hums, popping open the plastic lid to revel in the fresh, sweet smell of strawberry icing. “If they taste as good as you look, I’m keeping you.”
“It’s your patio stuff, Stark. It’s already up here. Chill, ‘kay?” Clint rolls his eyes, leaning further back until he’s balanced only on the hind legs of his chair, and Tony leans into Steve’s side to keep from giving into the urge to go over there and push him off. The rest of their team is scattered beneath a large canopy Tony’s never seen before, but he finds them all smiling and at ease as they meet his eyes.
“Good,” is all he can rasp out, just before a short, hard knock makes them startle, and when Tony turns to the doors, he can’t help but crack a grin at the sight of Pepper glaring at them from the other side of the glass.
, his brain is screaming, blood rushing to his head so fast he can barely hear himself breathe and he can’t keep looking at Steve, has to look away so that he doesn’t see the anger and the pity.
Tony rolls his eyes, and rests his cheek on the crown of Natasha’s head as he continues rocking her back and forth. “Sure you don’t, Cappuccino. Only it’s rubbing off on these guys and frankly, I haven’t been this nervous of ‘em in years,” he continues, even as he hugs Nat closer, humming a tune Steve doesn’t recognize.
Tony lifts his arm to touch his face, but only gets halfway before his muscles just give up. “’s alright,” he mumbles, and Steve still looks so heartbroken, it makes Tony giddy. “’f this’s wut I wake’p to, y’can hit me’ll th’times y’want.”
“No,” he finally says. He can barely hear anything over the rush of blood that fills his ears, but it’s worth it for the way Tony’s body goes loose again. “It’s crazy, and a little scary, but… you’re worth it. I like you, Tony.”
, she’d told him once-- so it doesn’t surprise him when she comes into his apartment one day with a black kitten curled up in her arms.
“Eh, now we just distract him with cat videos and memes,” Tony says, and there’s a smile on his face so fond, Bucky decides to just go for it.
equal,” he replies, throwing his hand around again. “But... y’know what’d really make m’feel better?”
“I can’t, uh... The year it happened, that Christmas, I can’t-- can’t remember a single fucking second of it, y’know. The next one was, um... just as bad, to be honest,” he lets out a broken, bitter laugh. “I’m... sometimes, I’m so fucking glad I can’t remember. I spent a couple of the other years away-- those ended up being worse, actually. It’s easier now, but... Anyway, I’m-- I think I’m better now? Well, maybe that’s... not the right word. But at least I’m not drinking myself half dead anymore, and I can actually set foot in the cemetery without fucking losing it. But I still miss her. And that’ll never go away... will it?”
“...what about a onesie?” Tony finally says, and there’s no way anyone could ever miss the emotion behind his jab, but Steve just grins down at him.
He’s not sure when Rhodey leaves, but the next time he looks up, they’re alone again, with the heart monitor beeping steadily and the whisper soft feel of Tony’s hand in his.
“Thanks,” he whispers, and doesn’t need to look at her– he wouldn’t even if he could– to see the tiny, genuine quirk of her lips as she leaves him alone. Alone with the silence and the soft rush of blood in his ears as his heart beats in time with Steve’s.
“I still don’t… like… the cold.” Every time Steve blinks, it takes him longer to open them again, and the sudden panic that seizes Tony chills him to the bone. It’s not real, he knows it. None of it is real.
Tony looks over the edge of the tiny car they’re sitting in-- down to the bottom of the ferris wheel and then to the bustle surrounding it-- to hide the flush that rises to his cheeks. “You’re killing me, Rogers.”
“Better keep that mouth shut before we make you,” another goon says from over Rumlow’s shoulders, and Tony’s almost slides down to the floor when the tight grip on his shoulders is released.
plays on the giant screen. And even though he thinks he should be happy right now, relaxing next to the love of his life, he feels like crying instead.
“Hey! That was tough work, Stark!” Steve is laughing outright now, arm stretched out against a tree trunk to steady himself.
“But I’m sorry,” Steve says, and for all that Tony wants to run away, he finds himself rooted to his spot. “For everything. For what I said, back when we met.”
“Comin’ right up,” Steve nods, and moves to the back room. He wants nothing more than to ask him who it’s for– who the lucky soul is, to get a gift like that from Tony Stark– but he stays silent as he picks out the freshest, most vibrant sunflower from the bunch, and takes it back to the brunet with a smile.
Steve’s smile grows. “That’s why I did it. And it was worth Vice Principal Coulson’s phone call to my Ma.”
“Was it? Then how ‘bout this?” Tony leans in, putting his lips to Steve’s ear: “I want to rip every piece of clothing on your body right now, and then I want to lay you out on this couch– on the floor and the table, and the wall, on our bed– and lick every fucking inch of you. I want to blow you until you’re moaning and gasping my name, and then I want to work my fingers inside you, my mouth. And then, finally… I want to make love to you, over and over, until you forget everything but how it feels to have your husband’s cock filling you up.”
Tony doesn’t reply, but when Steve smiles into his hair, and runs his hands down his back, he thinks he might be able to believe it one day.
“Mama said cookies spoil y’dinner,” Steve tells him, eyes big and blue, and so trusting, they make Tony’s chest warm. “We hafta eat
“Didn’t hear any complainin’ just now,” Steve chuckles, but then pulls away to hold Tony at arms length. “You look beautiful, sweetheart.”
The car is silent when Steve speaks, and Tony looks away from the gray, tree-filled view beyond the window to meet baby blue eyes.
“Nope, can’t fool me, big guy,” Tony replies, even as he inches his head just a little bit closer to Steve’s. “I’m onto you.”
Still, ‘used to it’ sure as hell doesn’t mean ‘likes it’, and it definitely doesn’t mean he’s ever going to get used to that small, sudden jolt of fear he feels every fucking time he realizes he’s been kidnapped.
Tony has to smother his giddy giggles so he doesn’t wake Pepper, and he settles for grinning like an idiot.
“Good,” Tony nods once, in time with the tiny jostle he gives Natasha, who gives him a half-hearted glare in return.
“Come on, I’ll go set up Mario Kart on the Wii, yeah? Bet you can’t beat me like this,” Tony grins in challenge. “Can your hands even reach all the buttons on the controls?”
Tony clears his throat. “This... this is going to sound fucking insane, okay, but I’m gonna need you to hear me out.”
“And you can buy Bucky a fuckload of shirts with really stupid stuff on ‘em. Sam can get a-- I dunno, a samurai sword, or whatever you want. And you can buy Clint a real bow and arrow, Steve!”
He hears the other man step further inside, and the low bustle of the SHIELD Med-bay dies down as the door closes.
“Look at them,” he nods in the direction of their daughter, who’s now strapping the leash to her wrist with that familiar furrow of determination on her tiny brow. She looks so much like Steve, it almost hurts.
Tony holds out his trembling hands before he knows he’s doing it, desperate to feel something other than the terror trying to numb every inch of his body at the panicked, irrational thought of not finding Steve, of not seeing his smile or hearing his voice or
Steve reaches out until his hand finds Tony’s. "Because I'd be the happiest fella if you went with me, and I don't care if the whole school knows. But it's... look, it's okay if you don't want to, or if-- if maybe you'd rather go with someone else--"
“Wouldn’t dream otherwise,” the Captain replies, and Pepper’s sure she can’t possibly be the only one to hear the honesty and wonder when he speaks.
Which is why he almost misses Blondie as he’s making his way back to the outskirts of campus. But really, in hindsight, those shoulders would be impossible to miss.
— is that whatever this is, it quickly grows out of the sticky notes. They start sitting together in the teacher’s lounge when their breaks coincide, sharing whatever lunch they brought with each other. They sneak in a sentence or two during Vice Principal Coulson’s weekly staff meetings, and who’d have thought Steve Rogers would be hiding all that dry wit under plaid and six-pack abs?
Decorations don’t take long to complete after that— most of them are only shoulder height, but she’s pleased to see them stay up that way— and by the time the custom-made Captain America tier cake arrives, only minutes before Tony announces Steve’s arrival, Pepper thinks she might even feel as excited as the rest.
“This is bullshit, is what it is,” the blond sighs, shoulders sagging mournfully. He looks like the most adorably aggressive little puppy, and Tony almost laughs.
“Merry Christmas,” he says, and with a fond roll of his eyes, Steve leads the out into the cold, winter night.
The smile on Tony’s face when he looks up at Steve is one Pepper doesn’t think she’s ever seen. “Oooh, I love when you go all rebel, baby.”
“I should be down there, but I can’t...” Steve shakes his head. “I just n-need a-- a minute... I’m sorry--”
be anything,” Steve replies, eyes locked onto Tony’s for an impressive amount of time before he seems to realize Tony had mentioned her too. “Either of you, of course.”
But as adorable as their teammates are, Tony’s given up on trying not to stare at his Captain-- the blond’s damp, white shirt is spread almost indecently across that gorgeous chest, and his biceps are straining against the sleeves from the bustle of the last half hour.
“Then she can stare at ‘em, I don’t know, whatever she wants,” Tony replies. “Hon, just think about it, okay? Instead of, y’know, being cooped up in here for her birthday, so small and sad– you said it yourself, ‘big ugly building’ and all–”
It’s like sunlight, and for the first time in his life, Tony feels nothing but utter, incandescent happiness.
Tony lets out a shaky breath, and presses his lips to the skin above Steve’s heart. “I love you too, you meatball. So much.”
Every once in a while he’ll mention his other friend Sam, and another girl named Peggy that once punched a boy during recess for being a bully, but it always comes back to little Pepper, and it’s not long before Steve’s curiosity wins him over. So three weeks into the year, instead of dropping Bucky off at his bus stop, Steve takes him to school himself.
In the quiet, steam-filled bathroom, Steve’s voice creates only the thinnest of echoes, but it still has Tony grinning at him over his shoulder, running an appreciative gaze over the miles of wet, golden skin he’s treated to a second later. “First time you’ve ever complained about showering with me, honey buns… I’m hurt.”
She has Steve’s eyes, big and blue like the sky Tony loves so much. Like the man he loves more than he’s ever loved anything.
“Sometimes I wonder if you forget that it’s just an egg,” Tony teases, bumping shoulders with the blond as they sit side by side at their lunch table.
“We will, Ms. Potts. I promise,” Steve nods, a friendly, earnest smile on his handsome face. Pepper almost swoons. “The last thing I wanna do is make more trouble for ya.”
“Get out of my way,” Tony growls, but Natasha’s grip only tightens on his arm, and despite being smaller than him, she manages to hold him back easily.
“Can I talk you out of it if I tell you I want to spend the rest of my life with you?” he asks, and Tony’s heart skips a beat. “I want to eat, sleep, work, fight... everything. I want to do it all with you. You’re it for me, Tony. There’s never going to be anyone else.”
They leave the room with matching frowns, and when Pepper suddenly looks wary, Tony only waves her away with what he hopes is a reassuring smile. He knows he’s not in any danger but he also knows they really,
“Why do I feel like I’m the only one who has no actual control over my life, hmm?” he asks her. “You and Bruce and Rhodey won’t get off my ass about this dissertation-- y’know, this is actually
“I can think of a few things,” Tony purrs, leaning forward so that the words brush against Steve’s skin like the softest of kisses.
Tony’s lips quirk into a small but honest smile. “You’re right. They’re worth a hell of a lot more.”
But Steve’s grin is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen, and for the rest of the night, it stays with Tony like sunlight in his chest.
“Love you too,” she says before disconnecting, and leaves her office with a grin that’s far more eager than it’s been in days.
“Empty threats, Cap,” Tony replies, and then holds his breath as Steve deftly swings his shield onto his back and walks to the rest of the team as they shuffle into the main elevator. “Go kick ass,” he tells Romanoff. “Take names,” he says to Barnes, “and you...” he grins at Barton, “just go.”
The camera’s view turns and stays on a blank space of the wall, and Tony only just hears Steve speak lowly. “Maybe we should just–”
It did,” he hears, and jumps when two strong arms come out from behind to wrap themselves around his waist. But he recognizes those arms immediately, so he just leans back and hums contently.
But this kiss is slow and soft, sweet in a way that never fails to make Steve feel like they're almost glowing with love. It's less intense than what they’d been doing up to that point, but all the more meaningful because of it.
“I’ll keep a look out,” he assures Tony, but the next half hour is still spent in a permanent state of dread– for the memories to strike back with a vengeance, for his bones to finally give up on him, for someone to come find him and tell him it’s all over.
“No, it’s not like that,” he says, serious as that first day, and Steve wants to laugh at how grown up he sounds. “She said me’n her are like-- like her brother Tony an’ his best friend Ro... Roadee? She says we’re ‘bros’. Wassat mean, Stebe?”
Steve rolls his eyes, and then startles another laugh from Tony’s lips as he takes the entire tray. “Where’s yours?”
“Take care of the kids, Cap,” he mumbles distractedly, tapping at his phone now that it’s in his hands.
– Buck, get me some towels! Shit,“ he bends down, gingerly gathering the broken pieces of the plate into a pile. There’s bacon grease smearing on the floor and on his fingers, but he has most of it together by the time Tony bends down and picks up a wayward bacon slice.
“What’s going o-- Tony, where are we going?” Steve asks him, the faintest hint of exasperation in his voice, but when he doesn’t pull away, Tony just gives him a grin over his shoulder.
“Nothing,” Tony lies. “I’m all good, big guy.” From the corner of his eye, he can see Barnes, Romanoff, and Barton waiting by the elevators-- in their uniforms, they look more intimidating than ever-- and so he steps back even though all he wants to do is press his chest to the blond’s. There’s an all-too familiar wave of panic threatening to take over him that, on any other day-- on any other mission-- he’d brush off with an easy smile and a sharp quip.
“If you’re awake and downstairs in five, I’ll have your coffee ready. And maybe I’ll even make French toast.”
Steve can only nod, and the huff of resignation Bucky lets out stays with him for the rest of the day.
“You’re such a dork,” Steve can’t help the laughter that bubbles out him. “How many people did you tell about this?”
“Fine, eyes closed,” Tony grumbles, and Steve feels a rush of familiar fondness at how young he suddenly looks, one corner of his lips quirked up into a small most people probably would’ve missed. “What now?”
“That sounds perfect,” Tony moans, grunting softly when their baby splays herself out on top of him like a starfish.
“And with that, you can go get dolled up while I put Red down and really get this party started. You hungry?”
“Gotta wait couple more hours,” Steve says, and Tony leans in again to kiss the smirk off his face. “Just… just wanted to make sure you’re ready.”
“It’s not me I’m worried about,” Tony says through clenched teeth, nodding subtly at the tiny bundle in his arms.
“I will eat my own damn arrows if Cap’s not sulking down in his room too,” Clint says. “Go check. You guys are pathetic and y’know what? I’m outta here– keep moping if you want, I’m done.”
“This morning. I do it every day, babe, even when I’m all by my lonesome.” Tony hears Steve’s sigh, low and tinny, and closes his eyes at the familiar pang of longing. “I miss you.”
So Steve smothers the urge to tell Tony he’d like to see him in person, and instead plays along every time the man calls to ask if
Tony thinks he manages to hide how his body tenses at his captor’s voice, and instead sends a lazy grin to the shadows in the corner with an easiness he really doesn’t feel. His right foot is still tied to the chair, but this is hardly the first time he’s had to make do with what he has.
“I’m kidding,” he says, holding the blond’s eyes until he sees them go bright again. “I’ve got money coming out of my ass--”
“Somebody owes me bacon,” Wilson mutters, and from the corner of his eye, Tony sees Barnes roll his eyes as he walks to the refrigerator.
“Fine, you want reasons? I’ll give ‘em to ya,” Steve says, and then gets down on one knee. Tony makes a sound between a sigh and a sob, but doesn’t run away, so Steve takes it as a good sigh. “I wanna marry you because you’re the most amazing person I’m ever gonna know. I wanna marry you because you’re my partner in every way that will ever matter, and I don’t want that to change. I wanna marry you because you make me a better man, a better hero. I wanna marry you because for the rest of my life, I don’t wanna wake up next to anyone else. I don’t want to sleep or kiss or fight, or make love to anyone else. I wanna marry you because I wanna be your husband more than I’ve ever wanted to be anything else. I wanna marry you because I want you to be mine, and I want the whole damn world to know it. I wanna marry you because... because you gave me a home. You
“Are you okay with us watchin’? Did he even ask? I don’t… the last thing we want is for you to feel uncomfortable. I can go catch him and tell him–”
"Wonderful," he whispers, "it's a play date." And then the next moment he pulls away, grinning playfully as he walks back to the open car waiting for him. "See you later, gorgeous."
“One more thing, though. If we’re going to start working together, I think I’m going to need some incentive throughout. It’ll have to be often, and consistent,” he tells the Captain, and winks.
“Okay,” is all she says, and goes back to diligently pouring tea for the rest of stuffed animals crowded around the table. Tony lets out a laugh, soft and full of awe, Steve feels every part of his body finally relax.
“I know I tell you a lot, but... I just wanted to say that-- that you were worth it,” Steve says. His eyes are bright with emotion, but they don’t waver as they stare down at Tony. “You’re worth every moment that brought me here. You’re worth every bruised cheek and split lip I got when I was that shrimpy little boy back in Brooklyn.”
“Yeah, okay,” Tony nods, and tries not to swoon when the blond steps right into his personal space to settle the puppy into his arms. Annie barks at Steve once, and then turns to Tony and licks his chin. “Hey there, princess.”
“I like the one I’m lookin’ at right now better.” From where Bucky’s sitting, he can see Stark leering as he says it.
“I don’t…” Steve looks down so he can’t see the pity in Tony’s eyes. “I don’t think I can… I get it, it’s okay, you don’t have to, uh, introduce us. I can’t imagine he’ll be eager to meet me if he finds out about… everything,” he says, and god, his face is burning now.
Clint’s laughter follows him out the door and down the hall, and then, with an amused little wave from Bruce, Tony finds himself alone with Steve.
, is all it declares, the words surrounded by little black V’s that it only takes Steve a second later to realize are actually birds. “Wow...” he breathes, a faint telltale burn starting at the back of his eyes, and he smiles around the lump in his throat. “That’s...”
“Pepper, Tony. Say good morning,” Steve repeats. His voice is so soft, he’s almost whispering the words into Tony’s hair, and when Tony just rubs his cheek against Steve’s shirt, Pepper has no idea why she suddenly feels like she’s intruding.
It’s over all too soon, though, and Tony reluctantly pulls away to meet those bright blue eyes again. “That was, uh...”
, and Tony suddenly feels as though she’s looking right through him, as if she’s saying a million things without speaking a word.
“No you’re not. And neither am I,” Tony scoffs, grinning when both she and Steve glare at him. “What?”
“Ma’am,” Steve nods, stepping out from behind Tony to hold out his hand, as steady as the look in his eyes.
"Well, I've got one more," Steve reaches into a belt pocket and takes out a rumpled, slightly faded blue sticky note.
“What did I ever do to deserve you?” Tony mutters fondly, torn between laughing and squealing pathetically into his hands. “I honestly don’t know if I should be flattered that you took a laser tag shot for me, or terrified that it’s something you’d ever do, at all.”
Tony puts his phone away, and moves closer until they’re inches away. “Well yeah, but this…” he waves his hand up and down Steve’s body, “is fucking awesome. Do your shoes jingle?”
,” he whispers, horrified to feel his eyes burning. He can barely see Sarah, until she leans up to wipe them dry.
The next time Tony speaks, the sky above New York City’s already grown dark, and the only light bathing the room is coming from the lamp in the hallway and the movie playing on the screen in front of them. Steve knows he’s been awake the whole time– every once in a while, he’d run a thumb over one of Steve’s fingernails, over his knuckles and the pulse of his wrist– but Steve’d been happy to just hold him all the while.
He’s noticed every single thing about their daughter, from the moment she was first put in Steve’s arms. Every tiny lash brushing her soft cheek, every nail on her fingers and toes– he hasn’t missed a thing.
“Like, uh-- eating. Yeah, eating. You always bitch about me skipping meals, so now you can’t complain, see? Better things.”
“Jesus, why did I think it’d be a good idea to marry a sap?” Tony groans, but doesn’t pull away when Steve pulls him into his arms. “You’re killing me, hon.”
Well, Tony just nods, letting the music take over the room once again. “Been a while since we’ve done this,” he says, some time later. His entire world feels reduced to the warm circle of Steve’s arms, and the comforting voice crooning out wishes of Merry Little Christmases.
“Better not be the only reason,” Steve teases as he walks away, and his grin warms Tony’s chest as he sets out to find the blankets.
Tony points at them. “Okay, see?” He tells Steve. “We’ll take care of it too. Scout’s honor. Come on, hmmm?” He leans forward an inch or two, until his fingers are brushing Steve’s. “Let’s buy a dog? I’ll let you pick it and name it.”
“Oh Daddy…” his daughter leans in, strands of blonde curls escaping from the open faceplate and brushing his face as she kisses his cheek. “Who do ya think you’re talkin’ to, huh? I chose this! I’ve always wanted to be a hero like my Pops! Like
Tony feels his own lips quirk up into a soft smile, and the feeling of Steve’s hand when it comes to rest on his shoulder makes the tendril of warmth in his chest bloom a little more.
“I had lunch with Sam and Bucky, but I knew you’d forget to,” Steve says, sitting down in Pepper’s chair. “You always do.”
“I guess,” Steve sighs playfully. “But only for a little while, y’hear?” he tells Bucky. “Then we’re taking her back.”
“I know you said it wouldn’t be easy, but we’ve been okay, right? And I told you you could tell me anything, but…”
This time, the quirk of Tony’s lips is small and genuine, and everything Steve loves about this man. “Ditto. On the, uh... the home thing.”
“Don’t think I’ll make it that long, baby,” he says, and pulls back the bedcovers a second later, rising from the bed with a grace that sends shivers of appreciation down Tony’s spine.
“I’m fine,” Steve says, and then holds up a container Tony barely notices he’d been holding. “I just… Clint drove me over because I wanted to, um, give you a little something to say thanks–”
“Thanks,” Tony breathes. His suit suddenly feels too warm, too tight to hold his pounding heart. The thought of Steve feeling it through both their chests terrifies him, but he’s completely powerless to stop it, or to pull away. “You look…” He trails off, closing his eyes to rest his cheek on his best friend’s shoulder.
Tony shakes his head. “Steve…” he breathes the name, and closes his eyes when they start burning– partly out of shame, but mostly because he’s
“That’s because you don’t know him, hot stuff,” Tony grins up at him over his shoulder. “Thing’s as dumb as… well, a box full’a bolts.”
“Shit,” Tony blurts, breath catching in his throat as he’s suddenly only feet away from his mother, from the first time in years. “Shit, fuck,
“You shouldn’t go repeating whatever Master Tony says,” he looks down at her. “He tends to have some... rather colorful opinions, after all.”
“Good thing I don’t want to, then,” Steve says, and revels in the warmth of their bodies as they drift off to sleep.
“Peachy,” Tony replies. “Gonna take more than a skyscraper to bring me down. Comms are down, though.”
“No,” Tony says again, “it's fine. Just... I don't want him ruining your things,” he waves a hand around.
know me,” Tony smirks, even as he feels his face burn. He walks up the the bed until he’s standing in front of the Captain, right in between those thick, sooted thighs. Up close, the man’s even more beautiful than before, and Tony tries in vain to keep his heartbeat steady. “Hold still then, Captain.”
Prompt: “that fic with steve and the rest of the avengers comforting tony MADE MY HEART BURST WITH TEARS AND JOYY can we pleaseee have a sequel where the avengers go to fuck all the bullies up (steve and rhodey are first in line but the rest of them aren't far behind) and maybe even stevetony love confessions?”
was slacking off on Daddy duty,” Tony says pointedly, chest bursting with warmth when Steve leans down to pepper their daughter’s face with kisses. “Wanna maybe not leave me hanging like that again?”
“Obviously. I think. But this isn’t it. This is.. this is good weird. I mean, seriously, Steve, my arms are actually touching each other behind your shoulders!”
” Tony stammers, and even though Steve can’t actually see him, he knows the man is fidgeting where he stands. “
“If I thought you would, Stark...” is the last thing they hear before the elevator doors shut and Steve is out of sight.
“I thought you’d want to see ‘em gushing over her some more,” Steve laughs. “Besides, Christmas mornings are for family.”
Big, Blond and Beautiful– Tony can tell the man’s easily a couple of inches taller than him, even sitting on the floor– looks up at the scuffle they make, and meets Tony’s gaze with bright, happy blue eyes.
“Understatement,” Steve says under his breath, only to furrow his brow in pretend seriousness when Barnes and Rhodey both glare at him. “And then?”
“We did,” Tony says. “For god knows how long. Much as I hate to say it, though, it looks like we’re gonna have to leave the rescuin’ to the rest of the team. They’ll be here soon, just watch.”
“I’d apologize,” Steve says, lips brushing against Tony’s hair, making him shiver. “But the only reason I even got the blue shell was because you banana peel’d me.”
She makes her way back minutes later— feeling far more refreshed and conscious than before— to a full but pleasantly quiet kitchen, and she hops up onto the last empty stool with a content smile. Next to her, Barnes is tiredly poking at a bite-sized piece of syrup-drenched pancake with half-lidded eyes, and on his other side, Barton is too busy stuffing his cheeks with his own bits of breakfast to notice. Thor, Bruce, and Sam mumble quietly to each other across from them, and standing over by the coffee maker, Tony rocks a still-smiling Natasha and spares each of them a watchful but affectionate glance.
“No,” Steve replies, a gorgeous blush settling onto his cheeks and down the neck of his FDNY t-shirt. “Not yet, at least.”
“I’m… here for support,” Tony says weakly. “Kid’s been whining about joining the team for years, it’s about damn time.”
“There’s so much I never got to tell them,” he whispers. His tears are hot as they run down his cheeks, but still they don’t chase the chill from his bones. “So much I did, and said, that I wish I could take back. Twenty-five years, and all I can... all I can do is fucking sit here. God...”
It takes Tony longer than he’d have liked to gather the courage and look over his shoulder when hears Steve’s voice. “I was hoping for it, not gonna lie,” he says softly, swallowing the lump in his throat-- it’s not the first time he’s done it today, and he knows it won’t be the last-- at the pain he finds in those baby blues.
“Yeah,” is all Steve says. “Wouldn’t matter if they didn’t, though. You’re the one I wanna do this with.”
Steve keeps working out until his shoulders and arms and legs grow deliciously nicer and thicker than ever, until he goes from being the baby of the bunch, to being the tallest of them all.
The blonde comes back to with a jerk, and then takes a deep breath, squaring her shoulder. “I’m from the future–”
"I'd skip the whole damn day for you, Rogers," Tony says softly, and the faint blush on his cheeks has Steve completely enchanted. "And I didn't wanna keep you waiting for my answer."
It’s like falling and flying, like breathing for the first time in his life, and nothing’s ever felt better.
And when he thinks about the box still stashed under his bed, his smile gets just a little bit wider.
“Like hell we will,” Steve says, eyes gleaming in determination. “I’m not waitin’ longer than I have to.”
“Tony…” he hears Steve’s voice, soft but unwaveringly firm– like the hand resting solidly on his shoulder– and slowly but surely, it brings him back.
“Just like the one you showed me ten minutes ago. Just like the rest of the little Iron Men in your bowl there,” he points to Steve’s plate, still half full of Avengers shaped macaroni. “Do they taste good? Go on, eat ‘em and tell me when you finish.”
Steve rolls his eyes, chuckling as he tucks the fluffy covers in tighter around his husband’s form. “Just go back to sleep. You should be better by tomorrow, if you take it easy.”
The chime of the bell above the door jingles some time later, but Steve doesn’t even look up from the account books. “Welcome to The Flower Pot, I’ll be with you in a sec.”
“Be careful, yeah, I know,” he says, and doesn’t breathe as he pulls her up and into his arms. She gurgles quietly as he settles her to his chest, nuzzling a tiny cheek against the soft cashmere of his sweater. “I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of looking at her.”
“I can do that,” Steve says, and even though Tony sees it coming, the first press of Steve’s lips on his still sends a thrill down his spine. It’s slow and soft and wonderfully tender, the way Tony’s always wanted Christmas to feel, and he’s quick to lose himself to it.
Tony fidgets and frowns, but doesn’t look away. “It’s not my fault you’re such a mother hen. I just... I really want one. I promise we’ll help--”
Steve sends Tony a wink, and then sighs dramatically. “I wonder what I’m gonna do with all those pancakes I made, then.”
“Oh baby, I like the sound of that,” Tony waggles his eyebrows, and feels a thrill of fondness when Steve’s cheek turn pink.
Steve looks at Tony, and then back at her. “No, ma’am,” he says, and Tony wonders if she notices how Steve moves just a little bit closer to him. “Your son did.”
Pepper gives him her most scathing glare. “At least let me freshen up,” she says, and doesn’t wait for a response before leaving the room.
“Tough,” Tony grins, and leans over to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek before he can talk himself out of it. “I’ve gotten better, though, right?”
