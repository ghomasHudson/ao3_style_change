Tony can imagine it in a way he never could before. He takes the image of Steve gently waking him in the morning with an understated smile and a cup of coffee and swaps himself out for Peggy. It sits right with him. It’s clearly what should happen. The rest of his imagination paints a comprehensive picture of Steve in a tidy, small house looking after well-behaved, adorable children. He’s had so many glances at what Steve looks like when he’s happy over the last month; it takes no effort to see Steve even happier seventy years before.
“I mean--”
He never thought much of it in the moment, but now he can’t forget Steve’s words as they were leaving 1970.
Jan’s gone. His tech has broken down and taken the earth’s information systems with it, and
The question stole Tony’s breath from his lungs. They were the sort of feelings that could lead to his ousting from Timely. They were the sort of feelings that would have driven Steve away, if he ever knew.
“I said you’re right, so just stand there and be right, ok?” Tony responds. He’s halfway through the sentence when he realizes that he’s now almost eye level with Steve’s junk.
Maybe it’s the months it’s been since Tony’s been this close to someone or maybe it’s the way Steve’s settled into his mind like an old friend or maybe it’s the knowledge that he’ll never see Steve like this, Tony just doesn’t know, but he hugs back.
, where are you?” Tony appears from around the corner, searching until his eyes light up at the sight of Steve. “I've been looking for you.” He's dressed like he's worth a million bucks--not that Steve doesn't know he's got more than that--and fits in perfectly with the gilded gold walls of the mansion’s hallway.
He did this. He did all of this.
“Yeah, cool, good idea,” Tony mutters and attempts to steady his breathing. He tries to shut off his brain, because the rustling in the bathroom just tells him Steve’s taking off his clothes and the sound of water against the tile just conjures up images of water running down his naked body.
but it doesn’t feel right to stand against the wall in his full dress uniform and watch everyone else dance.
“Tony!” he calls out.
be here without her.
Steve heard a knock at the door and looked up from where he was examining a bruise under his eye in the mirror. It had already been a long day fighting and his head was still throbbing from an especially well landed punch. He hadn't even had time to get out of his Captain America regalia. “One second,” he responded. Steve opened the door just enough that he could slip his head outside. By now he’d thought there was nothing that could surprise him, yet he was looking at a blue and translucent Tony Stark. “Tony?” he asked confused and incredibly worried something ever more serious had happened.
“Ok, let me get this right, you’re from the future, despite the fact that you’ve been around all my life, and if SHIELD’s files on Nomad are correct, much, much longer than that.”
Something that should hurt.
“You said you couldn’t lie.” Steve sounded hurt.
He clumsily kneels back on the bed, and this time his thighs are flush against Steve’s waist while his hands are on either side of Steve’s head. They kiss again. Steve’s fingers are making a mess of his hair as they use their grab to tilt Tony's head so that their noses pose no impediment to their lips. The other hand rubs up and down his chest, his back, and his arm. A thumbs flicks over Tony’s nipple, causing Tony to moan into Steve’s mouth and Steve to do it again. “Mmmm...that’s nice,” Tony mumbles. He breaks the kiss and lightly pushes Steve up and around the bed, following on his knees, so that Steve's head is on a pillow and they can lay longways on the mattress.
Tony slinked lower against the wall and shifted his focus to Steve fighting, Steve smiling, Steve
“Tony!” I heard someone shout from a far distance, so far that even when I looked up to see the source I only saw a dark shadow on the horizon.
person. Let’s just say...it didn’t work out very well. I slept with a few women.” Steve shrugs. “And then a couple of men, just to be sure.”
Steve looked around and saw it in the corner. He nodded, and picked it up. The end not plugged into the wall was oddly shaped.
Tony glares at the hologram in front of him. Good ol’ persistent Steve. “Where is he?” Tony asks and closes up what he’s working on. He takes a couple of deep breaths and reminds himself that this is
, he tells himself.
, Tony thinks when the words won’t come, and he leans forward enough that his lips land against Steve’s.
Everyone smiles and a few of them laugh. Steve shakes his head fondly. Tony has to give himself a ten second limit before he looks somewhere else besides Steve's eyes. He can’t be too obvious, even if Steve’s painfully attractive today.
He’s not finished with the question when Tony sees it begin—Thanos’ numerous minions are dissolving into dust in a way Tony’s used to seeing in his nightmares. The fiery battlefield around them is becoming emptier and emptier with each second.
“Then what is it?” Tony asked, irked at how casually the two had shaken off his response.
Tony slumped low in the chair, and its hinges whined at how the weight of the armor put too much pressure on the arm rests. “That was a disaster,” he said to the empty office. The room didn’t respond, because thankfully Tony had disabled the hologram and all of the commands that were built into it, but the silence was answer enough. That plan had been a dumpster-fire.
Steve’s eyes followed the movement of my hand. “Where’s Thor?” he asked, but he doesn’t look up to check the horizon.
“He’ll be fine,” the hologram answered. “Thank you for bringing him here--” he did really look thankful, his soft smile met his eyes, “--but Iron Man’s going to need his privacy now.”
, and then he sees Steve observing the parameter.
The need wins and he settles into the tight space between Steve and the rough concrete wall. Steve scoots forward, just enough that Tony can fit, just enough that he’s balancing on the edge, knees hanging perilously off the cot. “Mhmm, warm,” Tony mutters under his breath, and yes, the side of him tucked perfectly against Steve feels like it’s next to the campfire up in his cabin in Banff, like Steve’s warmth is slowly flowing out of his body at every point of contact and filling in Tony’s hollow soul.
on top of each other. Doesn’t matter that they’re actually the same type of mattress, Tony’s way more comfortable in this bed than he was in his own.
“No. I did.” The words came to the forefront of Tony’s mouth before he could stop them.
The room goes burning hot white and a force emitting from the Time Gem flings Steve back. He hits the wall so hard it cracks behind him, kicking up plaster dust and paint chips that fall around him like snow. It takes a full minute to settle, and Steve needs every bit of it to gain his footing. He brushes off the debris and steps forward and is only certain of one thing--he’s not anywhere he’s supposed to be.
There was a time, back when the bars of a jail cell separated the two of them and Tony couldn’t even deign to look at Steve without his mask, that Steve could almost… appreciate the pain Tony is going through. He would have never delighted in it, it would have
The sensation of the hologram's touch was odd, almost discomforting, if it hadn’t come with Tony’s warm smile. “I was happy to. Anything for a fellow Avenger.” He pushed himself off the floor and walked out the door, trusting Tony to look after Iron Man.
. He finally decides what he wants off the menu. “That. Do that again,” Tony pleads.
“Why now?” Tony asks as they’re eating a frozen pizza one night. “You could stay in this timeline longer, wait until we’ve invented time travel organically.”
There’s a lot to unpack there. “I didn’t know that,” Tony replies, and he’s now wishing he’d taken the opportunity to steer the conversation in another direction.
“You probably didn’t see them, I don’t think they took off--”
Tony looks over to where Thor’s hologram is sitting next to Rocket’s, expecting him to take offense. He’s smiling instead. “I agree, Steven is the best Avenger for the job.”
He was so immersed in that thought process that he didn’t notice when Doctor Strange finished what he was doing. Tony knew because the man coughed loudly to draw his attention. “I am ready to begin.”
“What’s that?”
“Yeah, I do.” He wishes it was otherwise. “I think about it. Sometimes not much, but sometimes...a lot. Especially since Hydra. I was so angry while we were fighting. I kept telling myself I didn’t hate you, but I felt it--the anger, the hate--when we fought. I didn’t like it. I
feeling, but Tony could sense that there was much more to him then he would let on. He didn't like being left in the dark.
“It’ll be faster when I’m done with it.” Tony shifts in the bed, trying to find a spot that’s comfortable between all the wayward springs.
Tony’s not entirely sure what Steve’s actually saying. He flips his grip so instead of holding Steve’s cock horizontal to his body, he’s pumping it against his stomach. “Is this ok?” he asks, a tiny bit concerned that their wires are crossed.
? And I can’t even remember it.” He says the last sentence to himself.
Where was he, anyway? If only I could get the armor moving, I could find him, and Thor, and we could go back to civilization and warm coffee. Did they even have coffee here? People, even? I hadn't seen anyone since I crashed.
. The cycle repeats in Tony’s head as he walks down the hallway leading to the residential suites.
“Oh. Good. I’m ready, too.” Tony stood up because that seemed to be what he was being asked to do.
“I don’t regret it,” Tony said, barely a whisper against the wind.
Steve’s about to die because Tony couldn’t keep his armor under control. Yinsen’s son, of all people, wants to prove a point and he’s going to do it with fucking Captain America’s life. It’s Tony’s fault, it’s always been his fault, and he’d give up his life it meant he could fix any of it.
And that was before a week ago, when Tony returned from a mission so beat up that to keep his heart beating, he didn’t just need the chestplate, but the entire Iron Man armor. A problem which left his secret identity MIA to the world.
Steve smiled, kind of sad and kind of sweet, and he edged himself down so that he was laying on his back. “Are you cold?” he asked, and looked between me and my just-out-of-sight armor.
skip a few beats, freezing the air in his lungs and acting as a poorly timed reminder that his heart was operating on borrowed time. “I’ll tell him that, too, when I get a chance,” Tony said in one quick breath. He needed to get out of here; he needed to be in his workshop, charging his life support.
This was dangerous territory. Steve was trying to be coy, but Tony saw the question underneath. No matter how many texts Tony sent Steve complaining about how he was busy at work or that he was halfway around the world, and
She just waves him off. “Whatever. I don’t need to know the details.” She rolls her eyes. “My question isn’t about your sex life. That part doesn’t matter.”
Tony didn’t. A world with Steve was a world that was righted.
that.”
Tony thinks
“Maybe, with T’Challa’s blessing,” Tony replies. Steve picks it up, and Tony doesn’t need to hear the question before he pulls out the portfolio bag he’s been storing the shield in. “Who’s it for?” he asks as Steve slips it in. It’s certainly not for this Steve.
“Respectfully, I have to disagree,” Princess Shuri begins to say. “These stones are dangerous even in the best of times. Right now, they do not belong to us and their existence in our timeline is destabilizing. Returning them as soon as possible is the correct thing to do.” King T’Challa nods his head in agreement with his sister.
He’s grown slower over the last few months. It’s strange, watching him age and coming to understand what’s going to happen.
“I can’t.”
“No, no, no.” Tony flops into a chair next to Steve. “I think Thor fell off a table as I was leaving, but everything sounded fine.”
Steve hears the words out of Tony’s mouth, but he doesn’t understand them, doesn’t recognize what they mean when strung together in a sentence. Tony’s staring straight ahead, watching him, stoic and unmoving, and he’s ready for a battle he doesn’t want.
“I guess so.” The dresser bumps against the wall when he stands up. Tony’s eyes snap back to where he’s trying to do a halfway decent job sewing the patch on the coat. “You want some pizza?” he asks. “I’m starving, and I saw a place around the corner. I’ll pick it up.”
love him?”
“I understand if you can’t.”
“I assume the internet was involved,” Tony says. The puzzle pieces are beginning to form a coherent picture. He adds, “But you don’t have a problem getting hard.”
, he repeats, a mantra that’s impossible to internalize.
And then, everything happens.
Steve took that as his own answer. He asserted, “It is my return from death. You believe it unnatural.” The tone of his voice indicated that he might have agreed with.
because Tony hated the idea that his teammates would move into empty rooms while he was building the compound. Steve’s neat, no surprise, and except for a pair of jeans folded across an arm chair waiting to be reworn, notes on his desk, and a cup turned upside down on the kitchenette's drying rack, there isn’t much of a sense he actually
Tony is, for the record, not ok with this conversation. He would like to exit it as soon as possible. “That whole ‘let’s start over again’ thing didn’t last long.” It had been a great couple of seconds while it lasted.
He’s not that lucky. “I wish,” Steve responds and he doesn’t even smile at Tony’s attempt at levity. “After the serum I thought it would go away in time. We were so busy, too. So I convinced myself it would be different if I was with the right person.” Steve’s eyes unfocus in a way Tony always believes that means he’s thrown himself deep into a memory. Tony assumes the ‘right person’ Steve’s talking about is Peggy and that Steve’s hypothesis was incorrect. “Maybe a tiny part of me thought it was some delayed punishment for all those times I jerked off thinking about Clark Gable.”
” he changed, because now he had no doubt that the hologram was Tony Stark all along. No one else would be as prepared to help.
“I take it you like how I’m touching you? Is that what you’re saying?” Tony smirks. He’s imploring his mind to remember every moan and every twitch and every time Steve’s back arches off the bed. He’s not going to get it up again tonight, but if they survive tomorrow, this is instant masturbation fodder. “I love the way your cock feels.”
“Wait.” Tony raises a hand before Steve can continue. “Did you have
Manhattan lies in rubble, and Tony’s on his back staring at Steve and the shield raised above his head, and this is how he’s going to die--on the concrete, with the words
Steve closes the notebook and places it back in the drawer. Tony tries not to look too closely at the contents of Steve’s beside table. “Yeah. He had to, he would have figured it out eventually, and I learned the hard way it’s best to tell people on your own terms and on theirs.”
Tony can feel himself blinking. “What?”
The hand around his wrist drops like Tony’s skin burns. “Oh god, no…” gasps the Supreme Leader, no… Steve. It’s Steve in front of him, a presence powerful and menacing.
Steve puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Of course it worked.”
exactly they’ll be building them will probably cause more discord among the group, but they’re not there yet. Tony has the impression that Natasha is purposefully going slow on this project to avoid the loss of goodwill the newly formed group had been building since the universe had been restored.
The syringe rests on the new workshop desk, right next to Tony’s phone and his Avengers ID. It’s filled with nanobots especially made to eliminate any memories Tony has had since the battle with Carol and his coma.
Except his fingers stick against the sweat fusing the cloth to Steve’s skin before he can graze a nipple. He stops, breaks the kiss, and gives Steve a severe look. “You’re gross”
Then Steve adds, “And I made a promise to myself. If I can’t go back...then I failed myself.”
“I’m not sure if I can.”
“Incredibly. Top secret. I wouldn’t keep it from you unless I had to.” The hologram bit his lip, and even blue, Tony’s face could be so expressive.
Tony doesn’t point out that she’s not as good at lying to him as she used to be.
“Huh?” I was still slightly disoriented from the whiplash of emotions banging around my mind. “Maybe a little bit?” Cold was probably an over statement, but as the sun slipped behind the horizons, I could imagine the oncoming chill.
Tony repeated, “I can explain.” He pushed himself so that he was sitting against the wall. “My heart has some problems, and I need the Iron Man armor to keep it ticking.”
“Fuck,” Tony responds, louder than Steve, and picks up his pace. He tries his best to keep the angle that has Steve gasping. It’s a sight to behold and he can’t take his eyes off it. “You like that.” It’s not a question. It really looks like Steve does.
That settled it for Steve. He liked to think that he was a good judge of character, that he could get a sense for a person by the way they held themselves. Having seen the hologram’s exit, Steve knew that even if it wasn’t Tony, it wasn’t anything to be scared of.
“I think it’s our best option. It’s about time we get out of our comfort zone,” Steve responds.
,” Tony shouts as he buries himself as deep as he can into Steve and comes. “Fuck,” he repeats when he’s finished riding it out. Pulling out sounds just
.” Steve’s behind the door before Tony finishes talking. From here, Tony can hear the sound of water, the rustling of a curtain, and Steve stripping down. He looks around the apartment, searching for a way to keep his mind occupied while he eagerly waits.
Based on his pursed lips, it looks like Steve has an answer to that that he doesn’t share. “Just figured I’d ask,” he faux-explains instead, and finishes shimmying off his pants before lifting up the grossly colored polo so that he’s only left in his undershirt and boxers. He yawns. “I can’t believe how tired I am.”
“Stop it.” Tony stares at him and hopes there’s enough light in the dark room that Steve can see just how serious he is. “We’re just two adults who want to fuck, but aren’t actually going to fuck. And that’s ok.” He pauses and hopes that doesn't scare Steve. He likes their newfound relationship, and he’d be damned if it gets ruined because of some unresolved sexual tension. “And I know you’re thinking about leaving for the night or sleeping on the floor, and god help me, if you suggest such a thing I will bait you into a fight where you call me an old man again and I, against all better judgement, say something about your virility. So let’s just skip over that part and get some sleep.”
face.
Tony tries to hit him back, but the time Steve deflects. Feathers fly across the room, falling like snow lit from the city lights outside, and Tony staggers up and onto his feet so that he’s standing on the bed.
>>If everything went according to plan, you won’t remember me doing it, though. And for that, I’m sorry.
“I’ll be kind and won’t ask you any questions until we know,” Steve told him. The word
Maybe Steve really does care about Tony in the way he seems to right now; Tony not sure he’ll ever be able to know the answer, because Steve doesn’t just need Tony, he needs Tony to see him the way he was before he was the Supreme Leader. He needs him to be the one person who doesn’t remember Hydra’s reign. He
After awhile Tony breaks the peace between them and asks, “Is everything ok?”
this, and Tony wants to give it to him. “I want to make you come as hard as you made me come. What can I do?”
“I guess so. Mr. Banner is very much missed.” Tony shrugged. “But we’ve survived these months without his care and have been trying to find someone else to see to our medical needs.” He wasn’t sure why, but the man gave him an uneasy feeling. It wasn’t a
Somehow, though, it breaks through to Tony what that could be. He turns around and pulls Steve into a big hug. Steve’s a good hugger, he brings Tony in closer than he already was and drops his head to Tony’s shoulder. He doesn’t hug like the rest of the big men Tony knows. It doesn’t feel like a display of strength. Instead, Tony would describe it like Steve is trying to burrow into Tony’s body and find comfort in being close.
Tony’s hands reach for Steve’s face. “Please,” he says.
Nathan nods. “I know. The timing wasn’t great, but the UN wasn’t going to reschedule a major vote just for Peggy.” He sat down on the couch by Tony’s desk. “And thank you for the flowers. They were beautiful.” The smile was back, but now it was sadder, less mischievous, so...familiar.
“Good idea,” Tony fingers the embroidery. “Are you nervous?” he asks, not even sure where the question comes from.
Tony looks from the dildo to the lube to the full condom box and draws a pretty clear picture of what Steve’s sex life is like. He’s still wrapping his head around the visual when the bathroom door opens. Without looking up, Tony asks suggestively, “When you said you didn’t have a lot of experience, you meant with other people, right?” He holds up the dildo to make his point and gives Steve a couple of eyebrow wiggles to show he’s intrigued, not judgmental.
Nathan opens his mouth to say something, but Tony doesn't stop talking.
“What you always ask me about cars, right after ‘is it bulletproof?’”
--he meant it when he said he wants to keep what he already has.
something we need to discuss.”
Tony’s about to give up waiting when the repulsor stops glowing and the screen goes all black and words begin to appear, letter by letter.
Tony guides Steve’s hands to his hips. Slowly, and with much attention to detail, he feels his way up Steve’s arms and shoulders until can wrap his hands behind Steve’s neck. The robe and the swim trunks underneath are doing very little in separating him from Steve. The exposed triangle of his chest is smashed against Steve’s abs, his legs are just a few steps away from being wrapped around the flannel pajama pants. Tony winds a hand through Steve’s damp hair. It’s the easiest way to tip Steve’s head to the side in a way that mirrors how he tips his to the other. Like this, it’s not just their lips that are slotting together, but their mouths and tongues crashing with the need to be closer and even more closer than that.
“Good,” Steve replies and keeps his eyes off Tony’s rumpled tux. They share the quiet room. It’s not comfortable for Steve, he’s itching to say something or to leave, but he keeps waiting for Tony to start the battle. Except Tony doesn’t, so Steve digs in. “Do you really not remember any of it?”
“But, I’d like to try,” he tells Tony. “If you’d be willing to try, I’d like that.”
It’s the perfect contrast to the freezing cold wall behind him, to the feeling of ice in his veins when he thought Steve was dead.
He walks to Steve’s side, instead, and runs his fingers through Steve’s hair.
“What the--?” Steve looked at Tony, who was apparently also Iron Man, with outright confusion.
This is probably a time where one or both of them is supposed to comfort the other. Yet, they don’t. Tony doesn’t know Steve’s reasoning, but he doesn’t want to lie. Too much is riding on it.
, then just
“You caught me. You’re no longer my hero, just my friend.” Tony in no way means for that to sound as corny as it is, and his first, second, and third instincts are to lampshade the comment with a self-deprecating joke, but the joke never comes to his mind and the need to deflect ebbs away to the rhythm of Steve’s breathing.
Steve throws his head back with a quiet groan. He shakes through his orgasm while come spurts from his cock and onto his chest. Tony’s eyes are wide open as it happens and he focuses on the drops of come that have landed as far as Steve’s pectorals and the line of saliva that runs down Steve's cheek as his tries to catch his breath.
Tony takes a step further but doesn’t call for the suit or make any other effort to defend himself. “Say something,” he begs Steve, his eyes wet with tears that fall on his splotchy red cheeks. “Tell me what I need to know so you’ll go away.”
“A tree,” Steve replied and I can tell he was trying to keep the mood light. Not a good sign. “I had a rough landing.”
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve says. He activates the red and white suit.
“We’re moving the workshop. Initiate a complete tear down and move the essentials to current axillary room 28.”
Tony would prefer to be yelled at right now.
Tony does the same—tucks his head in Steve’s collarbone and just lets there be a minute where he can’t tell himself he’s alone. “We’re going to win,” he mumbles into Steve’s shirt. “We’ll make it worth it. That’s what she would have wanted”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Don’t worry about it.”
“Not really.” It sounds like Steve hasn’t really thought about it. “We can do it stealthily. It would be good practice for later.”
“Do you love him?”
Maybe there’s too much friction. Tony stops his hand long enough to like a long, wide stripe across his palm. He takes the time to suck each finger while he’s at it, anything to offer some relief to Steve. Steve doesn’t hide his fascination with Tony’s actions. “Is that good?” he asks once his hand’s back to its place around Steve’s cock. Steve moans and moves his hips in a rhythm opposite Tony’s like he could speed up the whole process through an effective abdominal workout. It’s mesmerizing. Definitely worth the sore wrist Tony’s beginning to develop. “You like that, don’t you? Well, I like watching you, seeing how bad you want it. I thought nothing could be hotter than watching you on your knees swallowing my come, but no, this is better.”
If he’s going to keep doing the
“You know it’s weird to just hang out in someone’s room without their permission,” he says as he uses his hip to push open the door. Steve’s sitting on the bed, looking at him but also not really seeing him. His eyes are furrowed and his lips are pressed into a taut line.
“Clearly, we fix it, because you’re here. Unless I invented time travel just to get you out of my hair, which, yeah, actually maybe happened. Is that it?”
“Guys…” Natasha says with her hands held out as a sign of peace.
“Place down the street,” Steve responds. He gestures, vaguely, beyond Tony’s line of sight and leans further back on the concrete stairs leading to the fourth floor walk-up in which he lives. “It’s a father-son operation. The father was snapped away, and the son had to take over all the day-to-day operations over the last five years.” He smiles. Despite being surrounded by Natasha, Barnes, Rhodey, and Sam, Tony feels the force of his attention. “Then the father came back a month ago, and the two of them have been giving slices away to everyone. I had to beg them to let me pay full price.”
. But that wasn’t just it. There was even more that was true.
mean anything.
, the kissing is nice. When considered out of context, pressing your mouth against another’s is just weird. In this moment, with Steve? Every moment of wet lips and slick tongue reverberates around his body. Even each awkward clash of teeth is divine, a reminder that
Wong replied with one word: “Magic.”
“It’s fine. Really. I wouldn’t have trusted me either.” Steve felt another pang of guilt at Tony’s words. The man didn’t deserve to feel that way.
“I have no idea where you’re getting this bullshit.” He takes a deep breath and crosses his arms. There has to be a way out of this question he has no idea how to answer. “And I don’t see how it’s relevant.”
“And you’re from the future?”
Tony expects Steve to shake off his hold at this point and throw off balance the delicate dance they’ve been doing together, but instead his shoulders just clench in on themselves a bit when he replies, “Why are you cuddling me?”
, nothing compared to him.
“Why would I revoke your credentials?”

Doctor Strange nodded and spoke unintelligibly for a couple minutes more. With finality, he closed the book and looked to Tony. “It is done.”
Steve ran as fast as his legs could go, and then even faster than that, faster then he knew, but it wasn’t enough. Iron Man crashed into the grass fifteen feet away with enough force that Steve felt the ground shake beneath him. “Iron Man!” Steve screamed. He almost tripped on the grass as he approached, and fell onto his knees right in front of the red and gold armor.
Pepper chuckles, but doesn’t look like she finds it funny. “Please give everybody my condolences. Bruce, Clint, Thor, and...Steve. I know they were close.” She even says Steve’s name without venom, that’s a first in the last seven years.
Steve decides to play stupid. He’s been telling himself for the last hour he isn’t thinking about it. So, it’s almost real when he asks, “what thing from earlier?”
Pepper doesn’t say ‘I hope’ even though Tony knows she wants to. She waves the webcam off instead and Tony’s left looking at the wall of his room in the compound.
Steve groans. “Is it fast?”
“Home.
Tony tries to focus on Steve’s body, from the controlled way he’s breathing to the tension he can feel everywhere. When they get home, Tony’s going to refer Steve to his massage therapist and then find creative ways to threaten Steve into making an appointment. “It feels like I’m hugging the statue of David.” He rolls onto his back. The sirens have stopped, but lights are flashing outside the window, casting shadows against the ceiling. “Are you seeing anyone?”
, Tony is now very aware it’s been awhile since that time they fucked. So much happened that that fact had been relegated to somewhere in the back of his mind.
“I’m not sure that’s the best idea.” The idea of slipping behind Steve, lining his body up perfectly against him, well… it does things. It breaks things in him, things that took so much time to build since Steve left.
“It’s a Time GPS,” Nathan replies, apropos of nothing.
Tony can’t say it back, it’s not true. But Steve looks so hopeful and scared. He’s putting himself out there for this, and Tony can’t leave him hanging.
“If he had a choice,” Tony begins, “Why would he choose the single dad who’s fifteen years older than him over the love of his life?” He’s aggressive and challenging and ready to preempt any of Natasha’s arguments. “And I wouldn’t want him to! The last time I tried anything with a commitment like that, it failed. There’s no reason to think it’ll be different this time.” He sighs and tilts his head to look up at the cheap hotel chandelier hanging from the ceiling. “I couldn’t live with myself if I stood between him and his dream.”
Steve’s not sure he trusts what’s being offered. They had their chance back and it didn’t work out. “I don’t know,” he responds. If Tony really wanted this, he could have asked before.
“You’ll have to go against Red Skull!” Tony tries not to shout, and only somewhat succeeds. Everyone else in the room is slipping out of his line of sight. It’s just Steve, who’s gripping the table and staring back at him with the same intensity.
“Are you sure?” Steve’s voice breaks as he says it; he must want this so bad. After everything he’s been through, after what had to be a massive blow to his self-image, the idea of something as immutable as Avenging must be very appealing. “Please? I’ll beg if I need to.” Steve chuckles nervously.
Tony saunters forward and stands between Steve’s open legs. Naked is a good look on the man—he wears it better than any outfit Tony’s ever seen. With a light push to the shoulders, Steve’s laying on the bed. Tony joins him with his knees on either side of Steve’s waist and his palms bracketing his head. “That was a very good blowjob,” Tony leans down to say. “How would you like me to show my appreciation?”
to save Iron Man and he no longer had any help.
“That’s the past though. I’m talking about time travel--not what has happened, but what’s going to happen.” Nathan’s holding his breath, possibly waiting for Tony to call him on his bullshit.
The hologram snapped in and out again. “Do--see--ext--sion cord?” Almost every other word was cutting out.
“You’re welcome to join me. If you want.” Tony says it before he thinks it. He’s just that horny.
There’s a beat where Tony debates whether he needs the gauntlet after all. Nathan looks up from where’s he’s fidgeting with his wedding ring and looks right into his eyes. “What do you know about time travel?”
“This is weird? Right? This feels weird?” Steve asks, noticing how out of character this is. He rearranges the silverware and adjusts the napkin on his lap and takes another tiny sip of water. “I guess I wanted to impress you and someone once told me about this place but now that I’m sitting across from you I’m realizing that this was an odd decision, you’re Tony Stark, this restaurant means nothing to you, so I’m sorry, this is stup--”
Steve understands. After so much war he appreciates the peace. “It was a beautiful ceremony,” he tells Tony, hoping to fall into easy small talk and distract himself from what’s on his mind.
“How do I know?” Steve asked, even though he didn’t want to, even though it hurt to think that anyone would attempt to use Tony against him. Unfortunately, the future was like that.
Steve pulls away. “I know.” He clasps his hands firm on Tony’s shoulders, like an imitation of a wise old man imparting some sage advice. “Do it anyway.”
The man smiled, enigmatically enough that Tony wasn’t even sure it was a real smile. “He also told me there was much good I could do here.”
, but he was still uneasy and questioning. This couldn’t have happened.
“Do it.
“Will do, Cap.” Tony tries to sound light-hearted but mostly his voice travels an octave higher than where it’s supposed to. “Gotta go, Stark Unlimited doesn’t run itself.”
me? You loved
Nathan nods, but also qualifies with, “it wasn’t just you. But you played a key part, and I know you can do it again.”
Tony smoothed down the bristles of his mustache and watched the effect as his hologram did the same. It would never not be weird. “Now’s better than never,” he told himself. “Independent movement activate,” he told the computer. Instantly the hologram’s stance shifted, his legs stood a little closer together and his shoulder slouched just enough that Tony could tell the hologram was mimicking how he would hold himself outside of the armor, instead as he was now.
“Not that long. I still remember nineteen-ninety-five.” Tony lets a beat pass for maximum effect. “
“And why would he listen to me?” Tony grimaces. “And I don’t even know what the hell you want me to say.”
Tony shakes off the phantom sensation of the Supreme Leader’s voice against his ear. “I have to go.” He stands up so fast the table shakes and water sloshes over their cups. If Steve looked scared and confused before, it was nothing compared to how quickly he gets on his feet and follows Tony.
“Could we--uh--go somewhere else? To talk? Please?” Tony’s voice is higher than normal. There’s no confidence in the question. In the end they’ll do whatever Steve wants them to do--
Tony doesn’t say
“This thing?” Steve jostles it a little, probably to show it’s no big deal, but Tony sees him grimace behind the cowl. “It’s fine. I’ll live.”
“Me neither,” Steve responds.
Tony nods his head and watches as Steve licks his lips and takes Tony into his mouth. His cheeks have gone slack, and in place of the vacuum-like pressure from before, Tony only feels wet warmth. “Just like that,” he says. Steve catches his eyes and holds the gaze as he slowly slides his lips up and down. “That’s so good.”
Tony looks at him, wide-eyed, and Steve can see the recognition of in his eyes. He’s already been thinking about the database of superhero identities he has stored in his brain and what a liability it will probably shape up to be, which means he’s already accepted that the quickest way to destroy that liability is to wipe his own brain.
“Whatever. I’m just saying—”
Tony nodded his head. He was not sure how
. Tony has no idea what Steve, Sam, and Barnes were up to before pizza but Steve's shirt has sweat stains and his hair is flat against his head. There’s an ease to his shoulders that Tony hasn’t seen often.
Steve took my arm and rested it across his chest, above his injury. I curled behind him so that my head was leaning on my other arm and the entire front of my body was flush with Steve's back. He was quiet, and I imagined him lost in a memory. “You're right. It's much warmer here.”
“Just sayn’,” Steve mumbles against Tony’s lips.
Steve’s long legs help him catch up and when he does Tony has to quicken his pace to not fall behind.  “I think tonight we need to lay low and get our bearings. That means we need a place to stay. And money.” It may be 1970, but it’s still Manhattan.
, and Steve reaches out to grab his wrist and pull him back. He pulls loose the bow tie again, and repeats his attempt to tie it.  “What are you doing?” Tony asks, looking from Steve’s face to his hands.
Doctor Strange waited a beat to speak that Tony was sure was only to increase the dramatic tension. “Your
“Yeah, you’re right.” Tony flops onto his back and focuses on the gentle movement of outside light against the wall. “I’m thinking of getting a 1967 Shelby Cobra when we get back,” he muses aloud.
That Natasha has been taken unawares is strange. Even stranger is Steve’s demeanor. Tony’s been looking, and the entire meeting Steve’s been leaning back in his chair and gently nodding along with everyone’s concerns. A couple times he snuck looks across the table at Tony. Now, he’s sitting ramrod straight, clearly aware everyone is looking at him. “We need to talk about the stones,” he says.
Tony thinks. He’s had enough of them to last a lifetime.
“Steve?” Tony interrupts.
him, but the idea that there was a limit to Tony’s hubris, well, Steve was only human.
Steve turns around to see exactly who he expects. Tony’s in a dress shirt with his tie loose around his neck and his sharp patterned socks bright against the dark grey of his suit pants. Despite being immaculately groomed, he’s still never seemed to be so much of a wreck. It’s the bags under his red eyes that betray the nights he hasn't slept and Steve hates that he has any context for how close this is to Tony’s rock bottom.
Or he does until a notification icon comes on in the corner of Tony’s home screen.
Steve doesn’t respond right away and give Tony the respite he needs from his racing thoughts. “It’s…” he starts, eventually, the lighter tone of before gone, “better, I think. Less lonely this time. When that happened, I only noticed everything I had lost.” He turns his head, just enough that Tony can see the blue of his eyes. “But this time, I gained something instead.”
The alternative way of spending the last of the early morning hours is far more intriguing. And just like that, Tony’s definitely-not-going-to-happen fantasies of fucking Steve in strange locales become theoretically-could-happen fantasies where he just fucks Steve in his room here in the compound. The idea is deceptively simple. Instead of returning to his own bed, he’ll go to Steve. And just like that, Tony’s feet are moving while his brain catches up with the idea. His mind cycles between concepts like ‘Steve could say no’, ‘it would ruin what friendship we have’ and ‘it will throw a giant wrench into tomorrow’s mission’.
“Go,” Tony says and gently shoos her away. “We’ll talk tomorrow.”
, it couldn’t cover up for the fact that Tony Stark’s absence was beginning to draw attention and that Steve had a personal interest in where Tony was. The press, well, Tony could handle them. Steve, on the other hand, was Captain America and maybe his almost boyfriend, and it was clear he was running out of opportunities to mislead him from looking too far into his instantaneous disappearance.
His mind shuts down slowly, as if a power outage is slowly spreading across his brain, cell by cell, block by block, and when it’s all gone, he’ll be able to forget everything.
“I’ll buy you new ones. Come on, hand them over.”
jumps, that’s not a lot of room for error.” Tony takes a deep breath and tries to explain. “I’m assuming first he goes to 1970, then 2012, then 2013, then 2014, and…” he trails off as the idea that’s been nibbling at his brain begins to come together.
“Damn you.”
“Pull up the video feed.” Tony and the hologram said in unison. The screen on the far side of room switched on and Tony was looking at the oddest thing--himself, through the holograms visual inputs. It was just what Tony had intended when he had come up with this idea and it was
“Yet, it is--”
"Hey, Cap!" Tony responds with a little too much energy. He barrels on and asks, "How was your swim?"
“It’s a long story.” That wasn’t a lie. “Turns out Wong knows magic, and has a friend who thought I'd be amenable to giving up my ability to lie to bring you back to life.”
is such a strange way of putting it, but Tony gets that it’s just Steve talking on autopilot through the awkwardness. “Thank you.”
It’s a nice sentiment, but it doesn’t quell Tony’s jealousy. “How do you know the term ‘size queen’?”
Tony cuts him off. “Because I had to. There wasn’t another choice.”
, which only reminded him he made a rather dangerous promise.
Steve stays rooted in the spot, ignoring the impulse to go to Tony and shake the answers out of him. “Why?” There’s nothing that would satisfy him, but he needs to see Tony try to say something that comes close.
“There you are!” Tony says. Steve turns from the window to see Tony walking his way. “I was looking for you.”
Steve scoots a little closer. “Anything.”
“He’s my brother-in-arms!”
, is what he should say. He gets Steve’s instinct, at least. “Can I stay here, tonight?” he asks, instead. “I’m so tired.” He’s exhausted enough that he’s leaning into Steve, using his unmovable bulk to keep himself upright.
This is the sort of situation that Tony expects to spiral out of control when Steve’s involved. They’re better now, sure, but like everything about Tony’s relationship with the man, that’s tenuous. He expects Steve to yell back or come to his own defense or even try to deescalate the situation.
“Yes?”
, because Tony knows he totally can. Steve looks at him like he’s trying to decipher this very point. “Sure,” he says, making Tony feel a little lighter on his feet as Steve hands him a couple of the boxes.
It takes a few weeks for Tony to crack the whole time travel thing. He tries to find ways to work on it when he can, whether it’s math equations on napkins while he’s at a dinner counting investors or building holographic models during international flights. Sometimes he takes out the Captain America shield and mindlessly works on that, too, because the work with his hands clears his brain enough to think about the greater theoretical questions.
“No, it wouldn’t.” Nathan looks down, picks some lint off his pants. He has impeccable posture. “It’s hard to explain away those eleven years.”
Steve doesn’t respond.
He really wants Steve to come first. He doesn’t want to be
Tony rolls his eyes. It’s Steve, so it’ll probably be fine. Doesn’t mean he has to like it. He looks around, knowing when he’s beat, and sees everyone around them beginning to disperse. They have five years worth of life to catch up on. Tony’s itching to get out there, too, and talk more to Peter. But he still has time to say this to Steve: “Thank you. I’m not sure I would have done this if you didn’t stand on my porch that day and berate—”
“No,” he mumbles to himself. If he goes in, all he’s going to do is think himself into knots. Nothing good will come of it. So he turns around and walks and knocks on Steve’s door without giving himself a chance to talk himself out of it.
“Yeah,” Tony says. He doesn’t even need a second to think about it. He’s terrified if he thinks about it.
like it.”
“I can do both,” Tony can’t help but quip and he earns an annoyed sigh from Steve. He leans forward to grab the lube out of Steve’s hand but decides otherwise. Their conversation has his brain working overtime and he wants to watch. “You do it. You’re the expert.”
. Steve opens his mouth to say something, but he only lets out a big breath and leans into Tony’s space until they’re kissing again. Tony gets the drift and gets lost in the kiss. There’s no hurry right now, no erections and pounding hearts to keep them on task. It’s just kissing and for Tony it’s much better than getting a verbal confirmation that he’s a sex god.
“Nice, hmm? That sounds a little weak to me. Gotta up my game, apparently.” Tony doesn’t actually think that. He’s switched to pumping Steve with a demanding rhythm, and Steve looks like he’s already close. At this rate, he won’t even have to use any of the special tricks he’s been hoarding since the last time he was with a man. “Not after you sucked my brains out through my dick.” Steve squirms under his words and Tony gets the message loud and clear: dirty talk is encouraged. “The way you licked my cock? Absolutely fantastic. I could watch you do that all night. Even now I’m thinking about it.”
,” were the only two words that drifted out of the face plate, but Steve knew what they meant. He lifted Iron Man’s prone form into his arms. The suit was heavy and bulky, and its sharp edges dug into the fabric of the Captain America uniform, yet Steve trudged on. It was slow going across the street to the mansion as Steve was worried any quick movements would do more harm than good, and it was with great trepidation Steve opened the front door and brought him inside. He did all of it without thinking of the criminals across the street. It was just bees. It could wait.
“But...I thought…the coma...” Now it’s Steve that can’t look at Tony, Tony who can’t look away. “I thought you were the only one he didn’t hurt.”
Tony answered, “We like the excuse to indulge our morbid curiosity,” except he said it without meaning to; it just tumbled out of his mouth.
“No.”
Tony’s eyes go wide and his mouth drops open. “No! Never. I promise.”
Tony goes all in, pulls him closer. Steve’s hands wrap around Tony’s back and cling to the fabric of his tux. The connection to Tony’s body is what does it, he’s no longer thinking about how it was back then, he’s thinking about what it’s like right now. He’s thinking about how Tony tastes and how he smells and how his mustache feels different than the goatee.
He has five minutes until he can regret this.
Tony thinks, completely stunned by the surprising display of flexibility. So stunned that he misses Steve reaching down and around his leg. Steve moans, “Tony,” and that’s Tony’s cue to get back with the program and realize that Steve’s applying pressure to his own prostate via his perineum.
“It’s going to be ok. You’re going to be ok,” I began to say, even though I was just sinking to my knees beside him to examine his injuries.
“I’m never going to get over that,” Tony mumbles in awe.
Then Steve opened his eyes, and the hologram was gone.
Tony finishes the prototype on a cold fall morning. He left the windows open the night before, and the unseasonable warmth turned to chill in the night. Before he starts the machine he shrugs on a cardigan Steve left folded behind a chair sometime over the week and wonders if he really wants to do this.
That explanation didn’t stop Steve from cocking an eyebrow. “How important?” He had even more questions than that, but that one seemed paramount.
“Sleep well,” Steve says. One side of his mouth quirks up in a smile for a brief second.  “See you in the morning.”
“Want some help?” Tony asks by gesturing to the pizza boxes and cans Steve’s trying to balance in his hands.
Needing a change in the dynamic, he stands. He unwinds the towel around Steve’s hips and runs it up and down Steve’s skin to soak up the last of the dampness on his skin. “Thank you,” he mutters before kissing him. It’s not clear to him what exactly he’s grateful for—could be that Steve showered or invited him up or something completely different—but he kisses like he means it.
“Nope,” Steve answers, popping the ‘p’ and frustratingly not saying anything else.
“I’m fine. And tell Pepper ‘thank you’.” Steve looks to the floor and then somewhere above Tony’s head.
“Plus,” Tony adds when the sounds of sirens outside begins to feel a little ominous. “Pepper would really appreciate a full report on what your deltoids feel like.”
“Huh?” Steve grunts as he slides down so that he’s laying on the bed again, now a comfortable six inches from Tony.
Steve stops and opens one eye. “You can, if you want.”
Everyone says their goodbyes and makes plans for the next couple of days and Tony feels completely out of it while it happens. His brain keeps pointing out strange details, and when it’s time for him to personally acknowledge Steve’s presence and tell him he’ll see him later, Tony has no idea what to do. Should he shake hands? Is that weird if you fucked? But wait, they’ve definitely shaken hands since then. And
“You’ve been Iron Man this entire time?” Steve asked, not entirely sure of even that yet.
“We could’ve done a lot of things.” Tony shrugs and slowly walks backward, trying to guide Steve from where he’s rooted to the sidewalk. “So, I double checked, and made sure that alley was older than you.”
? I’ve seen it more than once.”
Steve had no idea how that explained anything. He gave Tony a look that he hoped conveyed as much.
“Just a couple of things.” She counts them off her fingers. “You stopped sleeping at HQ when you came into the city. Sometimes I catch you two looking at each other. Also, your feet knocked into mine while you were trying to play footsie.”
“If I could. It didn’t go great.” Steve closes his eyes. “It’s fine,” he repeats for what Tony feels like the fiftieth time. Tony’s not reassured. He’d be second-guessing himself more if he hadn’t just cleaned up the proof that Steve wasn’t faking it, at least not with him. “I figured it out by myself.”
Tony takes in the group and reminds himself he's right here, right now. This isn't a dream. His gaze stops travelling when he catches Steve looking at him. Steve smiles like he expected to get caught. Tony’s shocked into staring for a beat or two, but he tries to play it off and wiggles his eyebrows in some approximation of an unspoken language. For not the first time tonight, Tony recognizes Steve looks
“With pleasure,” Tony responds with a smirk. He rolls to the side of Steve so he can prop himself on his elbow and traces a line from the hollow of Steve’s collarbone to the tip of his cock, laying heavy on his stomach. Post-orgasm exhaustion is beginning to seep into his body as he finally feels the last few weeks of late nights, but he vows to power through and deliver on his promise. “How’s that?” he asks as he skims the tip of his thumb along the uncut cockhead, moving the beads of precome that sit there across the foreskin.
, he thinks.
“Ok. Sleep tight!” Tony says, his fake-happy voice all wrong, and he turns to leave.
Steve must sense that. “It’s nothing,” he says, and he rolls over so that he’s facing the wall and away from Tony. “Just agreeing. This is nice.”
“I am Doctor Stephen Strange,” he responded with a quirked eyebrow.
A third finger joins the other two. “Fuck…” Steve groans. Tony’s beginning to love how that word sounds coming out of his mouth.
He steps out past the kitchen island and down the hallway. The sound of the front door closing echoes all the way to Steve’s ears.
“How did you convince Steve to not talk about work?” Sam has genuine awe in his voice. “I’ve been trying forever.”
A tad smug becomes
“Take a picture,” Steve responds.
“What about them?” asks Bruce.
It didn’t matter that he could breath safely now, he was still
, but
“I used to ask myself about the things I could have done differently, if only I could go back.” He sits heavy on the bed and opens the drawer to the bedside tables. He pulls out a cheap, faux leather notebook, and turns to the middle of it. “I was so proud of this one,” he says and holds up the notebook in explanation. On the page is a drawing of Tony. He’s calling the Iron Man armor, and pieces of it are flying to his body, but the helmet hasn't snapped shut yet and the hipster-joke t-shirt he’s wearing is still visible. On the paper, Tony’s face is furrowed in concentration at whatever he’s looking at. There’s so much movement in the drawing, so much happening, all at once, it captures the way Tony feels in the moment before he’s Iron Man, better than he could ever explain it. “I never showed it to anyone. Never showed any of it to anyone, really.” He flips through the notebook, and Tony sees it all upside down from where he’s standing above him. There’s Clint and Wanda and a street in New York he doesn’t recognize and Ultron and the view of the skyline from Avengers Tower, each a snapshot of a life.
Pepper’s barely breathing in front of him, and he can’t lose her, when he’s already lost so much.
“This?” Steve asks, the breath of his words a puff of air against the head of Tony’s cock.
Yet, Steve says nothing. He’s still staring in a way that’s slowly becoming unnerving. Tony’s just about to press him on why he’s being so
There. He said it. Maybe now they can put it behind themselves.
The hologram was just like it was before, blue, transparent, and a spitting image of Tony. It was stuck stock still, frozen into place until Tony gave it more instructions, and Tony was glad at that. The thing made him uncomfortable, and after what had just happened, it made him feel a little bit like a failure. “What do I do with you?” he asked the light in front of him. He needed one more chance to convince Steve before it was too late.
Less than three weeks ago, Steve asked Tony out on a date. It went better than Tony could ever dream and led to another date, and then another, and then a long walk in Central Park that didn’t end until the sun came up and Steve kissed him in front of the mansion. It was glorious and it was the most dangerous thing Tony was involved in right now, particularly because Steve had no idea Tony
as if on cue Tony’s right in front of Steve’s door with his hand raised, ready to knock.
Steve rolls over, too. Tony doesn’t even need the light to see it, the bed is just that bad. “I thought I already answered that question.”
“Huh?” That clearly wasn’t the response Steve was also expecting.
That desperation drove him to plug in the cord just where the blue finger had pointed. He felt a jolt of electricity move up his arm when he finished, and heard a shaking gasp for air underneath the Iron Man mask. He startled, as much from the sound of Iron Man’s life as from the shock under his skin. “Iron Man!” he shouted, loud enough it reverberated around the small room. He wished he had a pulse to check. “Are you ok?”
“Yes. This entire time.” Tony sighed. “But especially in the past week. I couldn’t show my face otherwise everyone would know and…” His shoulders fell. “I’m sorry.”
It’s the address of a hotel in Times Square. “I have a photographic memory, you know,” Tony mumbles, but he still pockets the address. “It shouldn’t take too long. Maybe we’ll even have time for dinner.”
Not, you know, the whole thing about him being injured in the first place. “Don’t worry about it,” I tossed off, because now that the immediate threat of death was gone, I wasn’t comfortable admitting how much I was worrying.
, he says, over and over. Tony can’t remember how exactly he said it. When it happened, he thought Steve meant he got some closure, just like Tony had with Howard. But now he isn’t sure. Was it wistful? Was that regret in his eyes? Was there more he wanted to say?
“Yeah,” Tony says. He keeps his eyes glued to Steve as his shorts hit the floor and his hard dick feels fresh air. Steve’s got this wide-eyed fuck-yeah look as he takes an appreciative view of Tony’s body. It’s the opposite of suave, but Tony likes it anyway. He’ll take Steve’s awkward gaping over cool detached confidence any day.
“Don’t tell me Thor and the Warriors Three never fucked,” Tony quips, but the secret’s out, so Tony continues, “I don’t know what we’re doing. There’s no label. We haven’t even had the conversation about not having labels. Occasionally, I spend the night at his place. It’s really great.” Honestly, it is. Tony looks forward to spending time with Steve. He’s comfortable when they’re together. He certainly hadn’t been planning on stopping anytime soon. “But it doesn’t mean anything. Would I hate it if he left? Yeah. But I’m not going to ask him to give up his chance. How could I ruin one of the greatest romances in the 20th century?”
Tony freezes, he’d been expecting any question beside that one. His mouth opens, closes, opens again, and words never come out.
Which may be asking a lot for the guy, given he can’t be a year younger than seventy-five.
It’s Tony’s turn to be without words. Steve’s not sure Tony will believe him. He had some letters for a while, but nothing survived when his apartment was destroyed. And Tony? He clearly had kept nothing to remind himself of those days if he had never put the pieces together after he deleted his memories.
Tony doesn’t say shit. He scoots up a little when Steve dives into the pool and watches Steve’s expertly done backstroke. Steve’s fast in the water—that’s not a surprise—and he completes each lap effortlessly. Tony’s being creepy, he knows that, but it’s nice to watch him like this. Steve has a presence and ever since Tony returned to the compound to work on the Time Heist, he hasn’t gotten a chance to just observe Steve without feeling like he’s being observed in kind.
, around his cock. That really does it for Tony. “I’m going to—” He places a hand on Steve’s cheek with the goal of pushing him away before it’s too late, but instead he feels the head of his own cock through Steve’s cheek.
here.
Steve blinks a couple of times. “I didn’t think that.”
“Plug--right--re.” A blue finger pointed at a latch on Iron Man’s chest. Steve disconnected it only to find what looked like an outlet behind it. He looked again at the hologram, scared he was going to electrocute Iron Man, but it was slowly fading out until Steve could see nothing. There was something ominous in how it fell silent and disappeared into the air, something so incredibly creepy and wrong, that time expanded. Steve needed to do something, he needed to fix this situation, he
“I don’t know what you want me to say. We’re going to visit the birthplace of Captain America tomorrow, and I’m having flashbacks to when you used to be my hero.”
. For a long minute, he really tries to make himself believe this space is just as sacred as it was an hour ago.
. If Tony says it enough, it might stick.
Steve’s strides in before FRIDAY has a chance to answer. “Just outside the door.”
Iron Man groaned from time to time, but he said nothing else, even when Steve asked where in the mansion he wanted to go. For a few seconds Steve was terrified that Iron Man really wanted Steve to take him to
Pepper appears behind Morgan. She’s got her concerned face on. She knows, Tony messaged her about Natasha’s death soon after they returned, and she’s not doing a good job hiding her feelings. With a hand on Morgan’s shoulder, she says, “Time to go to bed. Say goodbye to your dad.”
. The original plan for tonight had been to collapse in the cot he had waiting for him at the temporary Avengers Headquarters in Midtown. He’s very glad he’s here instead.
Steve steps closer while patting his skin dry with the towel. He looks between the door and Tony and must decide to let the surprise of seeing Tony go. "I couldn't sleep. Thought this would help." He shrugs like he already knows it won't.
Steve gets an odd look and for a second Tony thinks he’s going to ask for something really weird or just nope-out completely. It confuses Tony, because Steve’s got a hard-on to rival a porn star and an inability to keep his hands to himself. Even as Tony waits, Steve’s hands rub up-and-down his arms. “You can keep touching me,” Steve says, but he says it like a question, as if Tony’s going to turn down a handjob he was clearly excited to perform three minutes ago.
Tony looks from Bruce to Steve. Steve’s jaw isn’t as tight, but he’s still holding himself very differently than he had been ten minutes ago. Tony tries to explain while never taking his eyes off Steve. He needs to be sure Steve gets it. “The problem isn’t that I’m busy.” He is busy, but that’s not the point. “The problem is I don’t think we should be needlessly sending Steve into harm’s way.”
This is when he notices that there is more in the drawer. He opens it a little wider. “Huh?” he mutters to himself as he picks up a monstrously large red dildo. Everything except the color is frighteningly life-like: there are even two large testicles on the end and thick veins running through it. Tony waves it in his hand to find that it’s sturdy and silicone, and thick enough his hand can barely close around it. Based on its size, his initial thought was that it was a gag-gift, but it feels too expensive to be someone’s idea of a prank.
and leave Steve’s pleasure as an afterthought. It’s not how he operates. Tony begins to lift Steve’s legs so that they’ll hook over his shoulders, but Steve must misread the cue, because he grips his thighs and lifts his feet into the air. The new position provides Tony a couple more inches to work with, inches that have Steve muttering his name on repeat.
And suddenly the mission report could wait. Tony had an idea. Or better yet, a new technology to try out.
Tony managed to not wince at the mention of Steve’s death. He looked again at Wong, curious at what exactly was so ‘interesting’ about Timely. There had been some strange events over the last six months, but that hadn't filled the town's hollow center. At least, it hadn't for Tony. “I’ll agree that Timely is...interesting, but I’m not sure if it’s interesting enough to justify your trip.”
“Thank you.”
“Good, ok, good,” Steve responds. “Very good. I’m going to go…” He points behind him at the shower.
. You know, I actually thought we were over this. But clearly that’s not true.” Tony’s eyes move from their reflections in the glass to the ceiling. “I want it to be, though. I don’t like that the SHRA hangs between us. And maybe you don’t ever want to let it go, I guess that’s not my call to make. But also maybe, someday...we can talk about it.”
“I hope not,” Steve responds before pushing two lube-shiny fingers against his rim. He takes a couple of deep breaths as they enter and still.
There was something off about the man. Tony had never met him, had
“He’s right, you know,” Natasha says and Tony realizes she’s still sitting across the table from him. “We need to finish this.”
But, no. He picks up the pillow behind him--and with it--hits Tony across the head.
“I’m a smart guy,” Tony says, and it has bite.
Tony doesn’t suppress the desire to internally gloat. Steve’s looking at him like Tony just helped him find the light. Tony bends over the bed to pick up his robe and uses it to gently wipe off the come across Steve’s abs before throwing back on the floor. “Was that good?” he asks as he lays his body against Steve’s. He has no doubt what the answer will be, he’s just searching for praise.
Their apartment has never felt so empty.
Steve grimaces. “When you say ‘I wish I could fight by your side again,’ did you mean with the Avengers, or with me?”
Tony looks from Steve to her, and back again, unable to process what he’s seeing. He sees the exact moment Steve decides to believe his eyes, and the seconds after where he runs to her and hugs her so tight with his one good arm her feet leave the ground. “CLINT! BRUCE! THOR!” Tony shouts across the field. “SHE’S ALIVE!”
That was easy. “We’ll have to get you some fatigues and me an oversized coat that screams ‘I never leave the lab’.” Tony says while grabbing another handful of fries
“Yeah?”
“I’ve been in the future for eleven years”
Tony’s Tony, so he begins to babble again once the sheer shock of it wears off. “I’m dead. Or I’ve been uploaded to the Matrix. I don’t know. I don’t care.” He sways a little on his feet, stumbles forward a little, and Steve catches his hands midair to steady him. Even when Steve stands up, even when his face goes from inches from Tony’s junk to inches from Tony’s lips, he keeps holding them. All the while Tony’s going on and on about the possible alternatives to heaven he believes are the most likely to be where he’s currently existing.
Steve pulls out his fingers and lifts his head enough that he can look Tony square in the eye. “Then fuck me,” he challenges.
Steve looks at him with a furious intensity. “You feel so good. It feels…”
“Please, please,” Tony babbles with his eyes shut tight. “Please, I’ll do anything.” He’ll stay still, like the Supreme Leader always wants, if it would just be over with.
desire—he gets a good hold of Tony’s butt cheek and Tony may be spent for the night, but he still feels it in his toes.
Tony took a deep breath in and picked up his hat from where it was sitting on the table. “Thank you,” he said, to both of them, too overwhelmed to think much about it. His thoughts were telling him to
chest. He reaches to the floor to grab the towel Steve was wearing before without having to get out of the bed. Gently and with great care, Tony wipes away the come. He gives Steve’s shoulder a tug so that he lays on his stomach and makes it easier for Tony to clean up the lube between his butt cheeks. “Well, I am interested,” he says when he’s finished and the towel is back on the floor. He mentally refuses to elaborate on why because he wouldn’t know where to start. He’s not going to talk about his on-again-off-again crush or the obscene late night fantasies. He deflects, instead. “I never thought you’d be interested in bottoming.” He punctuates his point by laying a hand on Steve’s ass.
Steve shrugs and it looks so similar and so different to the actions of the man he once knew. “Trust me when I say I feel older.”
Steve was across the room and next to Iron Man, fallen on the floor, before he even realized Iron Man was no longer wearing his helmet. “Are you ok?” he asked just when the shock hit him. He was looking at a pair of blue eyes, a pair of blue eyes he was very familiar with.
“I’m sorry, you’re probably going to bed, I should go,” Tony says in a quick burst of air.
Tony steps beside him. The shoulder of his tux brushes the shoulder of Steve’s uniform. “Yeah, it’s...something special. It’s nice to be in space to celebrate something, you know? I feel like we never get to appreciate views like this.”
Steve doesn’t believe him, not when Tony’s using that voice. “You can’t possibly mean that.”
There are people watching them, so many people, and not a single one is going to stop him. Tony wants to run, hide, even fight. Anything to get away from him before he has a chance to overpower him. And he will. He always does.
, but no one in this building is. Steve’s just one of the few falling back on reflexively lying about it.
, he may have missed something. His hands fly to the zipper of Steve’s uniform jacket (because everything was zippers in 2012), and he manages to get it almost the entire way down before Steve captures both wrists.
“I mean it, just one more thing and everything will be back to normal.” He fails to comfort her. Morgan isn’t buying it. Judging by Pepper’s frown, she isn’t either. “Good night, Morguna,” he tells her, adding in a wave of his own. “Sleep tight.”
“You look the part better than I imagined you would.” Not that Tony would really know; he’s still months away from actually being born and his only sense of the fashion from this period is what he’s seen in sitcoms he would watch years later. It's more that...Steve looks like he belongs much better than Tony feels. Tony settled for a simple t-shirt and jeans combination that’s almost impossible to be outdated, something classic, easy. But it doesn’t feel easy, his wandering eyes keep catching detail after detail, from color palettes to hairstyles to architecture. And then there’s the cars. There are
He was just going to need to get it over with, tell Steve that Tony Stark was laying on a beach somewhere and definitely didn’t want to be dating him, and not spending all of his time in his workshop in the basement. He had been lying to Happy and Pepper for this long, how could this be any worse?
Natasha swats at Steve’s shoulder. “Did they let you, or did you just slip fifty bucks over the counter when they weren’t looking?” She’s sitting only a step down from Steve and taking up her fair share of the stoop.
Tony laughs it off. He remembers it differently. “Either way, if you weren't there, I might not be here.”
Tony reflexively keeps talking, hoping to reright the strange mood shift he’d prefer not to examine too closely. “The compound’s lonely.”
“Tou-che.” The line, that ‘Steve is quite fuckable right now' line is too close in his vision, and that’s the only thing that deters him from making a joke about situations when size matters. “It’s just that--”
“Tomorrow, probably.” Tony’s not sure if that was something he was supposed to say aloud. His brain isn’t operating on all cylinders. He’s getting very strange vibes from Steve right now, parallel to the vibes he’d been getting since Steve showed up in his driveway with an idea too crazy to ignore. Tony’s not used to seeing him like this; there’s a strange ease in how he’s holding himself. It’s nothing like the tragically repressed man who showed up in 2012, or the almost sexless soldier who took over after SHIELD fell apart.
As dry as he can, Tony responds, “Are you serious?”
“What about your feelings for your late sheriff?” Doctor Strange asked, his voice perfectly casual even if the connotation was clear.
felt very significant.
Steve’s whisper “yes” but then it becomes a loop of
Images flood his mind, but they come with thoughts stranger and more detailed than the movies playing before his eyes.
“You know, I didn’t ask for this.”
“Not a lot of superheroes were out, back then,” Tony says. Steve hears what he doesn’t say, what he probably isn’t even thinking: there are a lot of superheroes who aren't out,
, he thinks.
Tony takes a good, long look at Steve. “Don’t you dare. That would be criminal.” He bends down so that he can kiss Steve. He knows he’s a little in his head right now, overwhelmed at the prospect of continuing. Steve might be expecting him to be good at this, but it’s been more than a decade since Tony’s been in these circumstances, he doesn’t have much going for him other than muscle memory.
“Ye—Yes.”
, body.
“What did you tell him about the future?”
“We were successful,” Tony hears Thor say from behind him. “It is a good day.”
“No,” he sobs because he’s never going to be able to look Steve in the eye without remembering what he looked like with bullet holes in his chest and stomach. He thinks of the incursions and the Illuminati and wants to vomit.
Steve nods.
Iron Man was still, and if he was breathing, it was undetectable under the metal. Without thinking, Steve looked for latches or releases, anything he could use to tear the armor from him and help the man underneath. He was sure he found something on Iron Man’s left flank when a cold gauntlet held his wrist and kept him from doing more to open it. “No, please, no,” Steve heard, the voice so soft and odd sounding he didn’t immediately register that it belonged to Iron Man. “I’m… fine, I’ll be, I mean…” Iron Man’s voice sounded drained, barely there, like something was wrong with the way he was breathing. “Just need... uh… please…”
Steve’s brow furrowed and he sat up straighter in his saddle. “But I did it for years.”
“Call him,” Steve mumbles into his neck where Tony feels wet tears. “Please, just do it.”
“Sleep well, Steve.” Tony ducks in to check that there’s still a fresh toothbrush and a hotel-sized soaps in the bathroom.
“This isn’t fucking real,” whispers a small voice behind Steve.
Steve leaned down, rested his forehead against Tony’s. “We’ll talk about that later. Now, I’m just glad you’re ok.”
Nathan chuckles, but it’s a subtle thing, more like a quick exhale that somehow softens his features. Tony swears he’s seen it a thousand times. “Wasn’t doing much of that back then. Kinda difficult when you’re eighty-eight.”
Tony smiles like it’s Christmas morning. “You're exactly who I was looking for.”
There was a twitch in Nathan’s lip that gave Tony the impression he was only a little bit impressed. “I
Tony shrugs. Where can even start? “Everybody’s in a different place, I think. We’re motivated. Bruce and I wanted to start immediately, but Rhodey’s all ‘you need to sleep before you do science’ and no one stood up for us when we argued with him.”
Steve nods and organizes the newspapers. This is the moment where Tony’s supposed to decisively stand up and do something, but it’s a comfortable booth, they have a lot of time to find clothes before tomorrow, and Steve should really do something about that ketchup.
“I don’t know,” Tony says. “I just don’t think we should be sending the guy with time displacement issues back in time by himself.”
“Are you being good for your mom?” Tony asks Morgan over the video call. She nods yes. She can tell something is wrong, she’s too quiet for his daughter and Tony can see how she’s bouncing a little in the kitchen chair. “I’ll be home soon, ok? There’s just one more thing we got to do and then I’ll be giving you the biggest hug of your life. A total hug attack.”
Steve's eyes scrunch in a way Tony used to find endearing. “Ok…”
Of all the things Steve could have heard, that may be the worst. “So it wasn’t working for you this morning when I brought you coffee in bed? How about last night when I fucked you into oblivion?”
Tony takes a step back before he opens his eyes, and then another after that.
“Huh?”
“Except they changed owners and now it’s
“I need the shield.”
Tony sits on the couch, feels weird about it, and successfully fights off the impulse to open the spiral ringed pad or check Steve’s internet history before standing up again. He gives the perfectly-made bed a look-over. It’s possibly too small and Tony tries to think through the logistics. It dawns on him that all he has with him is his phone, keys, and wallet. He’s got no lube, no condoms, but apparently the gall to ask about anal sex.
That is all sorts of unsettling. “Why are you here?”
, he thinks.
is this big,” Tony says as he waves the dildo around and it flops from side to side in his hand.
“Tony!” Steve says and he finally manages to take the dildo away from Tony. “It’s fine. I mean it. Don't worry about it.” He throws it somewhere off the bed and reaches for the lube. “Do you want to talk about my dildo or do you want to fuck me?”
They both turn to look at each other, but Tony’s eyes don’t stay open long enough for it to mean anything. Sleep takes him before he can even tell Steve good night.
He turns over and tries to will himself to sleep.
It’s weird to hear Steve saying the work ‘fuck’ and using it in this context. Tony always had the impression Steve was the ‘making love’ type. The weirdness is sexy, however, and Tony moans before detangling himself from Steve’s hands. “One-hundred percent, yes.” He reaches over to the nightstand to get the lube, but his eyes fall on something else and he picks up the monster dildo. “You realize I can’t compete with this, right?”
Tony lifts his chin enough that he’s now eye to eye with Steve. “What are you in the mood for?”
Steve nods and steps away. He pulls back the comforter from his bed and settles in on the same side he slept on last night. Tony places down the glass of water and takes his phone out of his pajama pants pocket before claiming his space on the other side of Steve’s bed.
Ugh. Why did it have to be some far away fantasy world? Why was it every time I was transported to a different dimension and my armor failed, I never landed in a place with electricity?
“What exactly matters?”
And that’s what happened.
She chortles like Tony’s hilarious and says, “Of course I love him. But not like I think you do.”
“Do you really have to live on the fourth floor?” Tony asks as they walk up in silence.
"Let's not make this a habit," he says to himself. He wants to laugh, this should be hilarious, and he hopes someone else, at least, finds it funny when they discover him.
“What do you need?” Steve asked when it became clear that Iron Man didn’t have the ability to articulate much of anything. He wanted to help, but had no idea how.
Tony to remember the real him.
“No, no, no.” Tony breaks the kiss and shakes his head. “No more distractions. I’m going to make you feel as good as you made me feel, ok? So, what do you like?”
“I should go,” Tony says, barely above a whisper and more to himself than Steve. He’s tired. He’s sore. He feels every minute he has spent working on solving time travel today.
Tony continues to stand there.
He was just twisting the doorknob to the den when a flash of blue materialized in his peripheral vision. “Steve--” Tony began to say. His eyes were wide, hopeful, nothing like his earlier attempt to convince Steve who he was, maybe because he didn’t need to.
Steve’s head tilts to the side but his eyes don’t narrow; he’s confused, not suspicious. “Of course,” he says, but he waits for Tony to lead them out, and for a few seconds Tony’s rooted in the spot, both surprised that Steve’s willing to listen to him, and then surprised he’s surprised. It’s Steve.
“Bye dad.” Morgan waves. Tony’s heart breaks a little watching her.
, Tony thought, reminding himself why had come up with this idea in the first place.
Orange lights dot his vision for a few moments and for a few seconds it doesn’t mean anything, it’s just a thing that’s happening irrespective to everything else, but he can only pretend for so long that that’s the case because the glow is rising and burning brighter. It looks like the whole kitchen, with its stainless steel appliances and glossy subway tile, is burning up. It looks like how Steve feels.
“Yes, oh god,
He reached out to Steve. He couldn't get close enough to touch him, but Steve saw his arm move and stretched his so that they could lock hands. The warmth of Steve’s very alive skin seared Tony, and guided him home.
doing and creating makes him feel more like a person than having an actual physical body to go with his consciousness.
It’s dark by the time he ends up walking past the peep shows and porn shops of Time Square. He almost forgot how seedy it used to be here and it makes him feel more like a kid who got a chance to sneak away from their mom than a grown-ass man who currently owns property four blocks away. He walks past the hotel a few times before he even notices it’s there, it’s so nondescript and dingy, and the woman working the front desk doesn’t even look up from her magazine as he waltzes by and takes the rickety elevator up to the twelfth floor.
There is no good way to respond to that, so Tony doesn’t even try. Instead he begins to move and hopes Steve is willing to just follow. “I can show you to the kitchen, if you’re hungry.”
Tony banged the back of his head repeatedly against the backrest of the chair. “Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he chanted as he tried to get a grip. He had to do something, and fast. His head was getting lighter, his heart beating with a little more effort, and he used his armored feet to push him and the chair near the electrical outlet that held his chest plate charging device. “Pull it back up,” he ordered the room with a long sigh as he plunged himself in into the wall and felt the familiar jolt as oxygen began to move faster through his veins.
knew. There was no reason this man shouldn’t either. “No one told me about your past struggles,” Doctor Strange said as if he could read Tony’s mind.
It would take Tony ten minutes to get back to the mansion. He hoped he had that sort of time. “I’ll make sure he calls you as soon as he can. I got to get on the road, though, see you soon, Cap!” Tony rushed to finish the last of the sentence and was in the air before Steve had a chance to respond.
Morgan pushes herself away from the table and walks out of the camera’s sight. Pepper takes her seat. “How’re you doing?” she asks.
“You can’t promise that.” He says it into the scruff of Steve’s neck, against the fine hairs at the edge of his skin.
But Steve had asked, and Tony had committed, so as always, this predicament was his own fault.
“We promised to return them. We should do it sooner rather than later.” Steve settles into his command voice. It leaves Tony unsettled. He’s been spending more time with the other side of the man. The change gives him whiplash.
“No,” he replies. Tony’s wrong. “That’s the part that’s in the newspapers.
, is absolutely what Tony doesn’t say. It’s disingenuous; in Tony’s detailed imagination Steve is a huge fucking fan of gay sex. It’s just that Steve almost always tops in that same imagination. The fantasies where he fucked Steve were the more transgressive ones because they couldn’t possibly happen. “I don’t know. You’re a big manly-man, I guess.” Tony will give himself away if he says more than that.
“What can’t you do?” Steve asks and the words catch in his throat because he knows when Tony isn’t going to back down.
Tony laughs. Steve’s sure that Tony has no idea what he’s thinking about. “Though I have to say--I feel really old right now. Kinda feels like my kids are all grown up,” Tony says. Steve knows he’s not imagining the emotion in his voice.
“It’s the only way I thought it would work for me,” Steve says before Tony can finish. He flips over onto his back so quickly the mattress bounces. With his eyes looking at the ceiling, he continues. “Since the serum, I don’t feel pain the way I used to. But it’s also the same with pleasure. I can’t come if I’m only jerking off. I need something...more, I guess.”
This was definitely Steve’s fault. I was not sure how, but yep, one-hundred-percent his fault.
Steve crowds him against the door. All points of Tony—even the ones not covered by the robe—are slotted against Steve. He has to look up to see Steve staring down at him with that same unreadable face. “Yes,” Steve whispers.
“Me, too.”
Steve types a few things on his phone and places it back on the nightstand. “I set the alarm,” They lay in silence for a while. Sleep is beginning to sound like a possibility tonight. “Are you scared about tomorrow?” Steve asks.
“Even SHIELD? Maybe they could have...”
“Tony--”
“So, Tony…” Natasha says, prompting out of his doom spiral. “Is something going on between the two of you?”
Steve’s heart thumps, he can hear it in the silence that follows. His hands are held in tight fists, his fingernails dig into his palm, the world is falling apart beside him. He stands his ground and refuses to be the one who leaves the room first even though he has nothing left to say.
Steve murmurs his agreement but doesn’t commit to continuing the conversation. He’s not sure if Tony considers himself one of those closeted superheros and he’s not going to ask. He doesn’t expect Tony to ever ask him, either. He doesn’t think Tony has much interest in this part of Steve.
Steve smiles, just a little bit and doesn’t dignify that with a response. ”Would it be fine if I stay here?”
“Steve, I--” Tony begins to say, but he falls silent, his excuses useless. He wipes tears away with the heel of his hand instead.
Barnes nods in agreement, but the rest of the group falls quiet. The five year gap difference in memories between Sam and Barnes and the rest of them feel obvious. Some of the time Tony forgets about it, how half the people in his orbit were gone for so long—and how they missed so much.
Steve shoots him a look. In another lifetime--or nine years ago--the look would have made Tony feel like he did something wrong; maybe back then it was supposed to. It doesn’t do that to Tony anymore. He sees an open ended question in Steve’s eyes, not judgement.  “And how did you know that alley was going to be available?”
That broke the spell, and Steve looked at him. “So you see, I think it’d be a good idea if you came back to Timely,” he said. “Red Wolf is living in my old quarters. I could use a place to lay my head.”
Tony watches him lay out the jacket and pass approval on Tony’s choice before beginning to thread the needle. “Here, let me do it.” Tony motions for Steve to handover the jacket and the patch. Steve does without asking for clarification. “You don’t seem too fazed by this time travel stuff,” he observes and is glad he can keep his eyes and hands busy with attaching the patch.
“Thank you,” Steve said, his voice gone distant and thoughtful, causing Tony to wilt as Steve’s mood shifted. “I hope he feels better soon.”
“My life.” Tony didn’t believe in any of this, but certainly that was the only right answer. It was a justifiable price.
Steve looks suspiciously from side to side. “You’re the one who took my jacket off.”
Same blue eyes, same square jaw, same look of determination on his face. This Steve was going to get what he wants. The only difference is that this Steve wants Tony to help him save the world, and that Steve wanted…
“Stop!” Steve called. His voice was distinguishing enough that Tony could tell even over the sound of their horses and through the distance. Tony judged he couldn’t outrun him without taking the time to don the Iron Man armor--he was stuck. He slowed to a walk and waited for Steve to catch up with him.
Tony sits up, even though he doesn’t want to, and waits for Steve to look through his drawers. While Steve does so, Tony’s free to look around the room and actually see it. This is the first time he’s been in here in what...seven years? It doesn’t look much different now. There’s the same Captain America-adjacent newspaper clippings on the walls. He knows they’re there because he put them there, and
Tony cups Steve’s check and tells him, “You should do that. I’ll wait.” Steve slinks away and Tony watches him with anticipation. He’s
Tony laughs.
It catches Steve off guard and puts a smile across his lips. “Let’s just see, old man.” He one-handedly catches Tony across the chest.
fault. And then it’s Steve’s fault and Scott’s fault, and none of that’s true. The responsibility falls alone to Thanos and no one else.
Steve leans into his arm for support and Tony walks him across the hall. “Thank you,” he says when Tony stops in the doorway.
Steve shrugs. “Haven’t really thought about it.” He opens a travel-sized sewing kit and without asking, rifles through the plastic bag holding everything Tony bought today until he pulls out the oversized black jacket.
“It’s closed,” Tony says, breaking Steve off before they dive too far into nostalgia. “Really, this is good. I’m sure it’s delicious.” Tony plasters on his best easy smile. “Company’s not half bad either.”
“You sound like Thor—”
, it was Jessica all along, why didn’t he see that, and why didn’t he see the vulnerabilities in everything he’s built?
He’s been in the hot tub so long that the water is making Tony woozy when Steve pushes himself out of the pool. Tony begins to drop back into the water to evade detection, but he must have succeeded the first time out of pure luck because Steve either sees or hears him right away. “Tony?” he says. He’s shocked-confused, not shocked-angry. Somehow Tony was able to evade his super soldier senses and it's unnerving him.
, I’m going to come.” His hand is moving faster now with none of the elegant strokes he was using before. Tony takes it all in—from how Steve has his thighs spread open for him, how his mouth is slack with heavy breathing, and his eyes are scrunched up in pure focus. At this point he’s actively trying to avoid having an orgasm, but he’s not going to be able to for much longer. Steve’s moans grow harsher and pronounced as he struggles to take in enough air it feels like Tony’s pushing out of his lungs. “Tony, Tony, I’m going to...are you close?”
Fuck, Tony really hopes that the next person Steve dates likes giving blowjobs in the shower, because that’s the image Tony can’t shake out of his mind and someone, somewhere, deserves it.
Tony wasn’t sure exactly what that meant, but he said, “Steve Rogers,” because that’s what sounded right.
That’s it. That’s all it takes, and he’s coming directly into Steve’s mouth.
old?” he taunts.
, he’d say,
“Why the hell would I--” Tony stops his question when an orange glow begins to permeate the room, taking up the space in between them.
Steve nods. “Ok, I’ll begin to formulate a strategy.” He doesn’t look surprised that no one disagrees with him, or even honored that the team thinks he’s the best for the gig. This is clearly what Steve was expecting would happen when he brought this up. “In the meantime we’re going to have to rebuild our time machine. Bruce and Tony, how long do you think that would take?”
That barrier was such a strange thing, because it replaced all the careful distance I used to demarcate how I wanted Steve and how I could have him. At this moment, those questions seemed insignificant and unnecessary, jumbled and confused, and I slipped down until I lay beside Steve. Certainly he hated me, but right now that meant nothing. Right now I could just be with him. “Hmm, it's a little warmer down here.” Maybe it wasn't, but my skin sparked with something akin to sunshine.
“Tony, I know you’re busy. I can work off your notes if the problem is the time commitment,” Bruce says.
“But--” When he finally got the nerve to tell Tony all those years ago, it had been like this. He had been unsure. He had thought Tony would say no, or if Tony said yes, it would not have worked out and that would be the worst thing.
“You know, I may have got that impression when I had your cock in my mouth,” Steve counters, pure exasperation in his voice. He reaches to grab the dildo away from Tony but Tony just holds it behind his back. “Tony, really, it’s not something you need to be concerned about. I’m not some sort of size queen or anything. Your dick is exactly what I want.”
“No, I’m just saying, in the future, that would be a great birthday present. I’m planting the idea in your head now.”
--------------
Hologram-Rocket yawns. “Or we could just wait. Why are we in such a hurry?”
“So—fucking—close,” Tony admits between thrusts.
Tony makes it out the door and across the street until a firm hand wraps around his wrist. He tries to shake it off without looking back, but he can’t, of course he can’t, the Supreme Leader is too strong, and he’s weak, he nothing,
When he had considered all of the possible problems that could arise from this plan, he hadn’t thought that one of them could be Steve being suspicious. Tony had gotten so used to Steve’s earnest acceptance of the future that he had forgotten that the man had enough bad experiences to not take everything at face value. Even right now, Tony was sure Steve was going to look more into his disappearance and the source of the hologram, and that was definitely a problem.
“We were talking about it.”
This was it. This was the moment Tony couldn’t run from. He would have to tell Steve the truth, and he’d be lucky if Steve only decided to turn around and return to Timely without a word. “Because I love you,” he explained, pained to have to say the words aloud. “And I couldn’t bear living in a world without you.” He turned away from Steve and waited for his reaction.
Not one second after Steve had finished asking, the blue, transparent hologram of Tony Stark popped up beside him. “Iron Man’s going to be just fine. He just needs some rest.”
Tony sighs, debates switching the topic entirely, and shuts his eyes close. “I think the worst was ‘So, you lied and destroyed your found family.’ It may have been a little too on the nose to be applicable to the public at large.” He opens one eye to look at Steve and see his reaction.
Tony had been prepared for the worst when he agreed to support the SHRA, but nothing could have prepared to him for what it’s like to sit next to Steve’s bloody, dirty,
If Steve noticed that Tony was gawking, he doesn't show it. Instead he asks, "and how about you?"
“No, I don’t. Everything between Extremis and Osborn is gone.” Tony regards him. Steve sees it from the corner of his eye. “You know that.”
. And watching Steve walk away gives him an idea worth waiting for. “Quick question: what do you think about anal?” he asks, fast enough to shout down every voice in his head that’s confused why he asked it.
Tony puts his hands up in protest. “I didn’t promise anything.”
Tony swallows, and Steve knows for certain whatever he’s going to say will be a lie. “I told you. This relationship isn’t working for me anymore.”
I ran. “STEVE!” I ran
Tony looks around frantically. Everyone else—even the rest of the Avengers—haven’t noticed the miracle happening right here. He turns on his coms and shouts again for teammates to join them.
They’re both forcing their smiles and looking away from each other.
“How the hell do we do that?” Steve asks, brow furrowed.
The hologram of Tony and Iron Man nodded in unison. “Thanks Cap,” Iron Man said, his modified voice sounded more like it normally did.
“I figured this was less conspicuous,” Steve calls from the bathroom. “And sorry about the bed. I told them I wanted a room for two, but I guess they just assumed.”
Steve sneaks a look out of the corner of his eye to see Tony smiling to himself. He’s gorgeous tonight with his bow tie hanging untied around his neck. Steve snaps his eyes back to the stars before his gaze gets stuck on the small amount of skin peaking out from the top of Tony’s shirt. He had seen enough earlier this evening and he didn’t want the sense of regret that always accompanied staring too long at Tony.
“No could do. Before we had time to research where we were landing. Now we’re working on the fly, and I didn’t want us arriving somewhere we weren’t prepared to be.”
Steve’s eyes narrow. “It’s not your birthday.”
There’s a pause where Steve may actually be considering it. Tony’s not sure what he’s going to do if Steve says yes. He’s not sure if he has the capacity to keep his thirst on a low enough level to avoid blowing up the tenuous partnership they were beginning to forge. How fucking long has it been since Tony’s been with someone else? Technically he’s been divorced for eight months, but right now it feels like eight years.
Tony grumbled and unsteadily walked to the computer monitor on the far side of the room before pulling up the holographic keyboard in front of him. He couldn’t ignore the heavy disappointment sitting in his chest, taking up too much room next to his ruined heart. Spending time with Steve as Tony Stark was never going to be a good idea, but he was still touched that Steve didn’t know that yet, or that he wasn't curious why Steve had taken such a liking to him.
Steve crosses his arms and it appears like it grows six inches taller. “You don’t look like you’re enjoying yourself, and I’m beginning to think it’s personal.”
Goddammit.
“I had no idea,” are the words that finally come out of Tony’s mouth. “I wish…I wish you had said something. Why didn’t you tell me?” Tony’s voice grows more and more panicked as he speaks. “Steve, wow, I don’t even know where to begin. We were going to get married?”
“Not really.”
“Yeah, I know. We’re in Cambodia right now, if I’m remembering correctly.”
“Did my dad know?” Tony asks because it’s the question he’s been pretending isn’t there somewhere on the edge of his brain.
Steve winces. Tony can practically feel the moment he chooses to tell the truth despite great personal cost. “That...
Tony tucks his head into his chest and averts his eyes from Steve’s strained gaze. “Sometimes, you’re just too much.” He means it, and it’s exactly what he’s thinking.
Every single one, the damn traitors, respond affirmatively. Soon after, they file out of the room. Tony can sense Steve’s trying to meet his eyes as he stands up, but Tony ignores him. He’s too angry to focus on anything.
She tilts her head to the side. “What’re you so worried about?
“Tony, you know it would mean the world to me to have you on the team,” Steve pleads, looking as if he’s seconds away from dropping to his knees.
“You’re right.” His eyes wander across the room.
It hurts to remember it, to reorganize the events of the day on tragedy. Doesn’t make it less true. With complete sincerity, he says, “She’d be proud, today.”
“I don’t remember seeing this in your file,” Tony says and hopes Steve doesn’t call him out on reading his personal information.
Tony was expecting that, but still doesn’t know how to answer. He sits up and Steve rolls over to his side to give him more room to move. Now he can see the mess of come that’s smeared across his pecs, and now that he sees it, he notices that some of Steve’s come is now smeared on
“I was really worried about you. I thought something had happened, or you had been avoiding me, or you were dead, or you just didn’t like me, or--”
Steve’s abrupt stop caught Tony off guard. He paused and gently turned the horse to face Steve. “Can’t really feel that way and live in Timely, you know?”
Those words would destroy him. He couldn’t say them, so he gave a small, tight nod, and walked past Steve to the workshop.
Steve nodded and followed Iron Man to the den and the balcony overlooking Fifth Avenue. There was one benefit of just having the two of them in the field--it simplified their transportation. They were still getting used to it, but Steve wrapped his arms around Iron Man’s waist just in time for both of them to jet off into the sky.
“You did not just do that...” Tony says in awe.
“Why won’t you speak to me?” There was a note of hysteria in Steve’s voice that Tony was sure he had never heard before.
Steve lifts his head from where it’s resting on his folded arms. “Why?” Steve asks with furrowed eyebrows.
is good pizza,” Tony says with his mouth half-full. “Where’s it from?”
At least, until the spell breaks. “Steve Rogers is here to see you,” FRIDAY announces, walking in and lighting up the room with a calming pink glow.
It’s quite comfortable and easy until Steve starts unbuckling his pants. “Is it ok if I just sleep in my boxers?” It’s an afterthought, he only pauses once the grey slacks are past his hip bones.
“I imagine he’s waking up somewhere nearby and is very confused. You should go to him.” He said it with a sense of kindness Tony never expected to hear from the man.
So, he did what he does best. Tony Stark built something. He tried to fix it. His new body has none of the scars, none of the bruises, none of the memory sensations of his old one. It’s clean of everything the Supreme Leader did to him.
“No, you don’t,” Steve says to himself, because this will destroy Tony, break him down into all component parts, and he’ll have to rebuild himself from scratch because of it. The things the man in front of him is going to do to forget the life he’s stuck in twist in Steve’s guts. “You don’t want to know any of what’s coming.”
Tony built the new body he inhabits; it’s his and his alone. When Hydra fell, his comatose body could no longer be manipulated and awakened for the whims on the Supreme Leader. He was left with nothing but a bruised and broken outer shell and a mind too scarred to return.
, Steve thought.
Tony looked around the hallway nervously, and then leaned in so that the Steve was almost nose to nose. “You took me to a bakery down the street of where you grew up on our first date because it had the best cookies you can remember.” The hologram smiled, sheepish, nervous, not like he was concerned he had the story wrong, but that he was worried someone would overhear.
He didn't know what to say. Tony looked towards the window and through the thick, blurry glass. Wong’s home was in the heart of Timely. Even though he couldn’t see it from this angle, Tony knew exactly where he was in relation to where Steve had been gunned down. It was too close. It was
The hologram sighed. “Am I ever going to be able to convince you I’m the real deal?”
Steve stops walking and Tony gets about ten feet before he even notices. “We could’ve done that?”
“I just keep making the same mistakes.” Steve puts the frame back down, gently, like he’s trying to make sure it doesn’t look too different than how he left it. “I save Bucky, let him have a life where he could get to old age, and Hydra just clones him. I keep Hydra from infiltrating SHIELD, and they just worm their way in Stark Industries instead.” He finally looks at Tony. He appears older than he did this morning, his skin papery in the light and his eyes could be made of glass. “I’m sorry, Tony. I really am.”
Steve’s face doesn’t distract the rest of the group. Natasha takes the reins of the meeting. “Let’s take a few weeks to look into possible locations and convene after that.”
“I don’t understand,” Steve said as he brought his horse to a halt. "Then why are you leaving Timely?”
Tony settles close to Steve. Not close enough to be pressed next to him, but close enough that his skin gently brushes against Steve’s. Tony’s going to have to schedule more early meetings in the city if he’s going to keep this fuckbuddy thing—
He flies across the city skyline, the morning rush nothing but ants below his feet.
Tony shakes it off. The man’s disarming, dangerously so, and Tony has had enough of that. And there is no way he’s as old as he says he is. “That wouldn’t make you eighty-eight in ninety-five.”
He doesn’t say
“Nothing, nothing, I just realized I don’t have any condoms or lube or—”
Steve nods. “We won. There’s no catch, not this time,” he says, out of breath with excitement.
“Yes, you always were.”
Tony shook his head. “The whole town of Timely has seen me at my worst. I don’t have secrets.”
Tony takes a long drink of the stupid glass of water he’s still holding. And because he can’t stop trying to top his own awfulness, he says, “This isn’t a booty call, by the way. I didn’t come here to sleep with you.” Tonight would be going better if Tony joined Thor’s drinking party.
“Yes,” Tony answers because the kiss and the ensuing sex was definitely was he wanted clarification on. “But I understand if it’s not your thing.” Tony isn’t even sure Steve likes dudes. He could have been giving off vibes earlier for a ton of reasons not related to sexual appreciation of the male body. Tony’s walking through the dark on this whole thing, letting his dick lead the way. “Really, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have—”
Bruce responds. “At least a month, probably more if—”
good. Steve, watching you do that, yes, just like that, you’re doing so well, so fucking good.” Steve’s not smiling, that would be pretty hard with all that cock in his mouth, but his eyes get a tiny bit bigger in a way that brightens his whole face. It really compliments the line of spit that’s running down his chin. “Your hand,” Tony pleads, he’s getting close, “could you use your hand?”
That was only two minutes before all of them were standing in a circle with the rest of the team and there was an empty space between Steve and Clint. Natasha became one more empty space because of Thanos. There was no dust, but thinking about it gives Tony the same dread he felt as Peter slipped away.
“It’s ready,” Tony says. In a better situation it wouldn’t be the centenarian going on this untested trip. Tony’s brought up doing it himself a few times, just to make sure he did it right, but Steve shut him down every time. “Are you?”
>>They are available for download. Warning: content is extremely disturbing.
He hopes they live through tomorrow. “You, too, Steve.”
But mostly he’s just quiet, like a ghost who’s forgotten that their soul has been left behind, who only knows how to get up and make toast in the morning and spend the rest of the day going through the motions. He exercises in the compound’s pool, even if Tony’s heart lurches in fear a little every time he sees him, even though he looks frailer everyday.
There’s a beat of silence where Tony’s probably deciding if that’s a need he can fulfill and Steve’s hands hover in the air near his neck. “I get it, you’re not interested.” Tony steps back, not out of Steve’s reach but definitely out of his air, and shakes his head. “You can’t blame me for trying.” He takes the untied band of cloth and ties a perfect, well-practiced knot around his neck.
“You wouldn’t. I didn’t tell anyone.”
Steve blinks a couple of times like he can’t speak Tony’s language. “I wanted to. We could have died the next day, and I’ve made a promise to myself to stop waiting so long to make a move.” He smiles, just a little bit, and adds, “Also, I wanted to know if I had it the first time—if I really just needed the right person, after all.”
Nathan’s watching him study the Time GPS, he has one of those gazes, the kind that sits heavy on the skin. “Send me back. I figured it would be easier if you had that to reverse-engineer the problem.”
Steve’s hand returns to the base of Tony’s dick. This time, though, he moves it,
“Because, in my timeline, we’re not on good terms right now.”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Tony says. He lifts himself out of the hot tub and sits on the side of it so that his legs still dangle in the water. “I’m beginning to prune, anyway.”
,” Steve replied, still not sure this wasn’t an imposter. It wouldn’t have been hard to tail him around the Lower East Side. Steve had certainly done much more difficult espionage during the war. It wasn’t like Steve had been quiet about his displeasure at discovering how some things that always felt immutable had changed, even if Tony had pretended for quite a while that he had liked it.
“Oh…” That was not what Tony was expecting. “Opinions?”
Tony’s head snaps up.
Maybe Tony’s just projecting. Maybe he wants to get laid so badly he’ll read into anything. Maybe Steve’s feet are planted to the ground because he doesn’t want to sleep, not because he doesn’t want to stop talking to Tony. But that doesn’t mean he moves. Tony decides to be responsible for the first time in this conversation and tells him, “Good idea. See you in the morning.” He stands up on wobbly legs to show Steve he really means it—he’s really going to go back to his room and get in bed. So what if he doesn’t expect to sleep? He has the outline of Steve’s dick etched firmly in his memory.
“Thought I’d stop by and check in on an old friend,” Steve says, hands in his pockets and taking up space like he owns Tony’s workshop. Tony’s throat closes up.
“I’m saying this because you asked for honesty. I resent that you were able to forget how much it hurt. Now--don’t get me wrong--I’m glad I can remember it even if you can’t. I’ll always choose to have my memories. No matter what.” Steve pauses and looks out the window again. He wants to leave that rock unturned at the moment. “I guess it’s just hard to move on from something when we can’t agree what we’re moving on from.”
Tony quickly reads the article next to the photo. It’s essentially about the coordination between the military’s scientific resources and the rest of it, and doesn’t say anything specific about Pym. “Ok, this makes sense,” he thinks out loud. “Looks like we have a choice to go in as either military or research. Why don’t we split the difference?”
“Sounds good.”
“Are you talking about the SHRA?”
“And you want me to do what, exactly?”
Steve pulls Tony closer than he ever thought we be possible. Like this, there might as well be nothing separating them. “Then don’t. Let’s fight for this, like we fight for everything else.”
“--Until you
“Steve--” Tony calls as he walks away.
(I probably wasn’t going to find them. The thought didn’t slow me down, though.)
, Steve thinks. Tony’s giving him the kind of eyes you’re more likely to see over a nice dinner than the bedroom.He settles on saying, ”I want you to take me seriously.”
“And--”
Steve lowers his head and Tony pushes up on his toes and then they’re kissing again. It’s much, much better the second time.
“Did you just say I’m right?” Tony scoffs at the idea Steve waited this long to say that out loud, but Steve doesn’t notice. “You can go see her,” he adds, when it becomes clear that Steve’s too locked into a memory to notice anything else. Tony feels a tiny bit of bitterness at not being apart of Steve and Nat’s wonder twin thing.
This time, when Steve smiles, Tony can’t ignore the resemblance. “I didn’t think I’d be able to get in, honestly. I was sure you would have revoked my access credentials, but at least I’d have proof who I am when the alarms went off.”
At least, Steve finally smiles. “Kind of. I woke up in the future and decided maybe my problem wasn’t that I needed to be with the right person, just that I needed to be with
Steve nodded and followed it up the stairs, taking them two at a time while still taking extra care not to jostle Iron Man’s almost lifeless body. By the time he was on the landing, the hologram had the door to Mr. Stark’s office open. Steve gently carried him through the small opening, following the hologram as it gestured to place Iron Man on the floor. “Is he going to be ok?” Steve asked, even if he knew there was no way Mr. Stark could answer the question yet.
“Huh. Interesting. They do say that the brain is the largest sex organ.”
“Don’t think I don’t notice the past tense in that sentence,” Steve says in faked anger. Tony can’t see his face, but it sure sounds like he’s smiling.
“I didn’t say I couldn’t--”
Tony makes a show of looking at the watch he’s not wearing. “Less than twelve hours until the mission starts and we find out for sure,” Tony says.
Steve’s in the kitchen, not the bedroom, and Tony regrets he doesn’t have the couple hundred more feet to separate himself from his own demise. “Tony?” Steve asks, when he sees him, and wow, he’s perfect like this--freshly showered and ready for the day--and Tony would do anything,
“You have me, Tony,” Steve reassures him and reaches out behind him to grab Tony’s hand and pull it across his chest, close to his heart.
Doctor Strange smiled the sort of smile that communicated he had the upper hand. “It’s very relevant. It’s why I’m here, after all. I think this is a situation I can fix.”
“I don’t recognize it,” Steve says, but he’s smiling again and whatever had shocked him now seems forgotten. “Congrats on finding the one alley in the city of New York where I wasn't beaten up.”
“I think it’s time to call it a night,” Rhodey says as he sits up from the cement and stretches. “Thanks for the pizza.”
“You? Steve Rogers?” Tony props himself up by his elbow and looks down to see Steve staring straight up at him, eyes wide and a rebuke on his lips. “I thought your whole thing was choice. We had this fight, not sure if you remember it, but you argument rested on this idea to
The kiss that followed was worth the wait.
“What did you want to ask me?”
, do you know that?” Steve moans,
Steve shakes his head at her. “I pay for my pizza. No one’s going to stop me.”
“It’s much better,” Steve replied, maybe a touch bitter, but then he heard how it sounded coming out of his mouth, and thought better of it. He still didn’t know if it was Tony or not, and he hated the idea of being mean to Tony. “Tell Iron Man I’m really glad he talked to you. I hope you can come home soon.”
But he couldn’t.
“It’s a long story, and it’s been going on for a long time, but recently it’s gotten so bad that I need the power from the Iron Man armor to keep it working.”
, if it meant he could just transport himself back until this morning.
Steve opened the door wide and took a step inside before giving Tony a look that invited him to come in. He hoped the privacy would give them more space to speak. From across the street he heard the voices of the Fantastic Four; the Avengers were not needed anymore. “I missed you,” Steve said once they were both inside and no one, not even Iron Man down the hall, could hear him.
been aware of him growing up, but he could swear he’d seen those bright eyes before. Peggy’s husband had always been an enigma--almost a black hole of a person, barely perceptible. Tony remembered his mom once asking if he was going to join them for dinner; his father responded Nathan wasn’t much of people person.
Steve’s hands go still as he tries to loop the bow-tie just right and continues to fail. “Don’t joke, Stark,” he grunts. It’s one thing to ignore Tony’s false overtures from afar, but he draws the line when he’s close enough to see the fine lines around Tony’s blue eyes, when it’s impossible to not feel the rise and fall of his chest. “I’m not in the mood.” His fingers are far from
Tony can’t keep his mouth shut, it’s that satisfying. “You’re amazing—just, amazing—it feel’s so good, so fucking good, you’re so
They did it. They all managed to manipulate the Gauntlet together and end Thanos. And that was after Bruce was able to bring back everyone Thanos had snapped away.
“FRIDAY?” Tony asks when he slips back into the workshop and sees her standing where he left her. His eyes keep finding the table Steve had been leaning against; he has an irrational thought that he should clean the spot with bleach.
Steve leans up to kiss Tony; Tony revels in the experience of being kissed with such fervor. The reason he’s straddling Steve is put on hold. Instead he’s winding his hands through Steve’s wet hair, liking how long it is now because it’s easy to tangle between his fingers. Steve’s hands aren’t still, but they move across Tony’s body with appreciation and not desire. Or not
They eat an entire large pizza while sitting on the bed preparing for the next day. On a pile of takeout napkins, Steve draws two maps--one of Camp Lehigh as he remembers it from the 40’s and one from the time him and Nat visited in 2014. They speculate on things like the type of security measures they’ll have to encounter, and settle on a plan that gives them a lot of room to improvise.
Tony glows under the praise. It ripples on his skin and amplifies that overpowering feeling of pleasure that's radiating from his dick. Steve’s so tight—it’s possible he's clenching and trying to make it even tighter—and the pressure rolls up and down Tony’s cock. “Are you going to come for me?” Tony asks. He regrets it immediately on the grounds he’s tempting fate.
“Yeah, sure.” Tony reaches out a hand to help him up and this time Steve accepts the help. “There’s the one down the hall we have in case Fury ever stays over.” It had never been used.
“I’m so sorr--”
“I’m sorry for you loss,” Tony says, a little too loud and a little quick. It’s what you’re supposed to say to a man who’s just lost his wife. “Peggy was a wonderful woman. The world owes her a large debt for her service.” She had been a larger than life figure in Tony’s life and a person his father always spoke of with reverence. “I meant to go to the funeral, I really did, but something else came up.”
The hologram laughed, like it was a fond memory, and Steve wanted so much to trust it. Maybe if the circumstances of Tony’s disappearance hadn't been so odd and hush hush, he could. The laughter hung in the air for a second too long and ended awkward and abrupt. “So, anyway, Iron Man told me that you were asking about me and I figured a visit was better than a text.”
Steve laughs like there’s a gun being held to his head. His posture is stiffer than it was thirty seconds ago and his eye line is somewhere along Tony’s brow. “If you say so,” Steve says—no, practically giggles—and he shifts from foot to foot like he has somewhere to be. Tony is getting a very strong sense that Steve’s struggling to keep his eyes where they’re at, too. “I’ll take what I can get. When’s the next time you’ll tell me I’m right?”
“Is there a guest room I could stay in?” Steve asks. “It doesn’t feel right to sleep in here.”
“Good. I don’t sacrifice the beard for anything.”
And it doesn’t matter.
“I consulted with Scott.” Steve gestures at Scott, who beams proudly back. “And it sounds like it will take over a year to produce more Pym Particles. Including what Tony and I brought back from 1970, we have only enough Particles to make five jumps. That means only one of us can make the trip.”
“It worked,” Rhodey says with the same disbelief they’re all feeling.
But the cycle always ends on the same idea: Steve could say
Sam jumps in to say, “And that’s coming from the most Pro-New York City person on the team!”
Steve didn’t believe it. “Why?” he asked, as if he couldn’t possibly fathom Tony’s quiet easy choice.
“I didn’t berate you, I calmly appealed to your sense of duty.”
Tony’s speechless. “Oh.”
, Pep’s screaming in his head.
“Never thought what?” Tony asks. He has a small idea what Steve’s about to say, but he wants to hear him say it.
“I’m glad you’re one of us.” Tony meant it. Steve was the extra ingredient the Avengers hadn't known they needed. Everything just worked with him around. He got along famously with Thor and Janet and Hank, always cracking jokes at meetings and assisting in the field like he came prepackaged for maximum avenging.
Steve doesn’t say anything, but he lifts himself up on his elbows and kisses Tony with force.
Iron Man dropped Steve a little off the ground, giving him enough room to somersault and land a kick in the Executioner's ribs. Zemo was monologuing somewhere close, trying to lure Steve closer to where an especially dense cloud of bees was hovering, but Steve saw through his plan. Zemo was predictable like that.
Somewhere on the edge of his awareness Steve can hear two women giggling. They stop and one shushes the other. It’s Kate's voice that whispers, “America, do you see? Oh futz, we got to tell Cassie.” And then they’re gone.
There’s a reason Steve doesn’t want to have this conversation right here, right now, while he’s supposed to be celebrating someone else's wedding. But there’s also a reason he can’t stop his thoughts from selfishly returning to that point. “The worst part was that I had finally told you how I felt about you, how I had loved you, and you had said you loved me, too. We were so close to telling other people--we were talking about marriage, for god's sakes--and then we were fighting and none of that mattered. Loving you didn’t stop me from hating you. And when it was all over and I was alive again, you remembered none of it. Even the good times didn’t matter, in the end.”
But then Tony disappeared with nothing but vague texts that didn’t pin down his location and Steve had been beginning to feel more and more like he did in the beginning--that he wasn’t enough for a man like Tony.
Tony gets to his feet and manages to take a few steps to the door. They’re difficult steps, each one heavier as it gets clearer and clearer to him what he has to do. The elevator ride up takes forever, Tony thinks about pressing the emergency stop five different times, but he does what he’s always done, and doesn’t stop himself. One final act in in his saga, one more thing to be his fault.
Natasha smirks at his admission but she doesn’t put any heart in it. “I thought you were brothers-in-arms,” she teases.
The room nods. No one has a reason to disagree with the plan to build spatially disparate Avengers compounds throughout the world.
He’s looking at Tony like Tony hung the fucking moon and Tony wants him to stop and wants it to continue and wants a lot of things, really. He’s distinctly aware that when Steve leaves, he’ll be back to wondering the compound alone, waiting for Peter to call or Vision to return. “You’ve said all of your goodbyes,” he says and hands Steve the time GPS to slip around his hand.
“I can’t,” Tony responds, like he’s begging, too, begging to not be put in this position, begging to let this be enough.
Tony sees a duffel bag empty and crumpled up in a corner. He knows Steve kinda, sorta, lives somewhere else. It’s just that he’s been imagining Natasha and Steve taking over the compound in his absence. In his mind they’re drinking his liquor and holding sparring matches and talking about whatever they talk about. He wonders what Steve’s actual place looks like—if it’s just a place he lays his head at night while keeping dutifully clean—or if it’s actually a home. He wonders if he’d learn anything about Steve if he saw it.
“Yeah, it was,” Tony responds.
--standing next to an old Bucky Barnes. It must have been shot not long before Bucky died, only months after Steve has woken up. “I tried to save him, I really did,” this Steve says without ripping his eyes from the photo. “I thought I succeeded, but I didn’t know.”
“Anything, Steve,” Tony says, easier than everything else he’s been saying, easier than any dirty thing he’s said before. “I’ll do anything.” Steve doesn’t respond to Tony’s words, so Tony doesn’t stop touching him. He seems close. Every muscle in his body is strained. He
“You look good, tonight,” Tony says, soft enough to be a whisper but Steve’s sure everyone in the ballroom can hear him.
“I am a master of the mystical arts.” Doctor Strange somehow managed to say that with a straight face.
“Don’t thank me yet,” the doctor said.
going to sleep and Tony’s booty call is extra bone-headed.
“That would mean a lot to me.” Steve was looking out into the distance, completely unaware that Tony was in crisis. And how could he know? Why would he ever suspect that Tony Stark and Iron Man were the same man, and that Tony’s heart was so damaged that he hadn't been able to remove the armor for fear that he would die?
Timely was different than most places--even the doctor had said as much--but it wasn’t that different. No one would tolerate the way Tony wanted to hold Steve. No one would tolerate the things Tony wanted to say to Steve.
The entire time Steve walks in and out of the workshop. He’s mostly quiet, except when he’s not. Then he’s all questions about the armor and Peter and what’s Tony working on at SI. He doesn’t ask about Bucky or the team or the years they spent rooting out Hydra from Tony’s own company. He does ask about Pepper, whether they’ve had a chance to talk after the accords, and encourages Tony to take her to dinner if he can.
Natasha steps back from Steve’s embrace and places a hand on Tony’s armored back. “I don’t know. One minute I was falling, and the next minute I’m waking up in a war zone.” She’s taking it all in. This isn’t what she expected, clearly. “This means it really worked, right? There isn’t some catch I’m missing.”
If that makes sense. Doesn’t really matter, most of his good sense abandoned him when he decided to preposition Steve, and the rest of it is melting out his ears as Steve closes his mouth around the tip of Tony’s cock.
A brutal silence follows. Tony fights with the impulse to deny whatever Steve’s thinking before he even says it, because anything he says in acknowledgement would just be confirmation.
The way Steve’s eyes track Tony’s movements as he searches the underground bunker they’ve been hiding in, or how he smiles when Tony catches him watching. The way Steve cheeks heat as blood begins to flood through them again.
The doctor raised an eyebrow in Wong’s direction. “Ok. Give me a few minutes to prepare and then we’ll begin.”
Steve’s not wrong, that wasn’t as easy on his knees as it used to be, and for all the money currently funding the Avengers, he’d never let him know that. “
Tony presses y.
Tony would do anything to protect him, and that’s why, even if his voice wobbles, he says, “I can’t do this, anymore Steve. I just...
“I’m cuddling you.” Tony says, like it’s obvious and Steve is just a little slow on the uptake.
“You don’t know that,” Tony counters. “What if something happens? What if you can’t finish?” Tony can feel himself getting worked up. Figurative red lights are flashing in his mind.
“Can I ask you something?” Tony asks. Steve nods. Tony looks from side to side, they’re still the only ones in the hallway. “You have to let me inside first, though.”
Nomad. That was a long time ago.”
Right now—under Steve’s open mouth—he has no doubt he’s a sex god. At least to the man winding his fingers through his hair.
But this is
Steve hears
“And I’m guessing you have a plan?” That’s Clint, calling in from his kitchen table back on the farm.
It was probably too soon to say it, but Tony was in love.
Steve lets out a big breath of air, “What do they feel like?”
“It’s like you’re asking me to regret undressing you,” Tony mumbles under his breath. He earns a look from Steve for that. “You’ve been a spy before. Look small and inconspicuous, and not like a construction worker from a music video.” Steve huffs, but he also turns in on himself and wraps his arms around his chest in a way that manages to hide the bulging tendons in his forearms. It’s impressive how quickly he goes from Captain America to just a tall chump on the street. “Perfect. You’re a natural. So, first things first--”
“So, the Avengers...” Tony prompts while he takes a seat. He doesn’t want to delay this anymore.
One step at a time, Tony walked closer to Steve, savoring how every footfall made more and more of his features clear. The sandiness of his hair, the jut of his chin, the color of his eyes--all of it was slowly revealed to Tony.
For a few minutes nothing happens; time ticks by as it always has, the perfect silence of the workshop’s climate control system only punctuated by the blood he hears rushing past his ears.
The smell of coffee wafts from the mug as Tony enters the workshop, the heat of the ceramic encourages him to hold it closer, tighter. He had started the day in Steve’s arms and plans on ending it that way; but in the meantime the universe is collapsing and Tony has work to do.
Tony smiled, weakly. “Lightheaded. Should have let myself charge more.”
“Yes, of course,” Steve says, probably not wanting to seem unreasonable. His counterpart, the one that took over the United States in the name of Hydra, never wanted to seem unreasonable, either. “Thank you for thinking about it, and let me know if there’s anything I can do to change your mind.” He reaches out his hand and just about makes it to Tony’s shoulder before Tony reflexively pivots away. His heart is beating out of his chest.
Steve shrugs and leans in for another kiss. “It’s fine with me if it’s fine with you.”
"Same, too. Can't sleep. I close my eyes and think about what we're going to deal with tomorrow. I tried to find this bottle of scotch I had here from before Thanos, but no luck.”
he tells himself while he forcefully moves his eyes upward. All the damp muscle between Steve’s swimsuit and his face is quite nice, but Tony’s a good boy and he tries hard to keep his gaze from drifting south of Steve’s neck.
Tony takes a deep breath and stuffs his hands deep into his pockets. “When will be the right time? It’s been
Steve turns just a little so that Tony can see him in profile. “Does it do my ass any favors?”
louder than everything else. Tony has a knack for making the most innocent of expressions sound sexual, but Steve's not easily scandalized; Tony’s not the first handsome man that has pretended to flirt with him. But it’s just pretend. Tony’s reputation as a ladies man is known over the world. “Are you sure? I’m probably not the guy you’re looking for,” he says, casually deflecting Tony’s attention.
It’s the little things.
That gets their attention. Thor gets there first, but the rest of them aren’t far behind. Tony’s enveloped in the group-hug that will beat every other group-hug he’s ever experienced.  Everyone has questions. Tony listens, and tries to answer as much as he can, but as people begin to disperse and members of the media arrive, he calls it a day, says goodbye to everyone, and goes home to hug his daughter.
“I asked for you to live again.” Tony couldn’t
Steve smiled under the cowl, a big, breathtaking, show of teeth that should've looked cheesy on anyone who wore a costume that tight, but instead just made Tony’s heart skip a couple of dangerous beats. “Couldn’t have done it without you, Shellhead,” he replied, like it was nothing to capture The Black Knight’s Power Lance from so far away. Tony was not even sure what he did to earn Steve’s praise. He let the warm words sink in; he would wait to argue against Steve’s sequence of events in the mission report. Instead he clasped his gauntlet encased hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve just grinned wider. The sight of it took the air out of Tony’s lungs and he worried he would need to return home sooner than he thought to charge the chestplate.
“How?” Tony hears Steve ask.
“No, no, no…” Steve mutters under his breath, his body trembling, his eyes darting across the crowd of onlookers.
Steve was looking right at him and Tony found he couldn’t wretch his eyes from Steve’s. It didn’t matter that it was dark--they called to him. “How?” Steve asked.
that idea was, but he wanted it deep in his bones. “I’d be very amenable to that, despite everything that could go wrong.”
“Well, I do.” He remembers that night Steve had told him—while lost in some memory—that Peggy was the ‘right person’. Tony exists in that moment for a while, seeing it through every lens he has. He doesn’t come up with anything definite to settle the sinking feeling in his gut.
