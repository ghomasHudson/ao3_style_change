“Go in that direction,” he points where he knows Sharon will be. “Authorities will lead you to safety, okay? Get them safe,” Steve adds to the man who nods and basically carry both kids in his arms and runs in the pointed direction. If only everybody listened as well as him in dire situations like this.
Steve’s eyes widen. Tony’s
around him, but it was decidedly better than the cell he’d been held in Afghanistan. He sat up with difficulty; muscle and bones tense, strained, and his hands were cuffed before him. His armor, every last piece, had been taken, leaving him in his tank top, pants, and glowing arc reactor.
Steve had rolled his eyes, reaching out to scratch at Tony’s goatee, and he felt the oddest urge to purr like a kitten. "No, Tony, I don’t see myself growing a beard."
"Widow overheard Fury and a HYDRA agent converse within SHIELD compounds, and saw first-hand the transformation from Fury to Skrull," Steve was saying. Tony’s head was already coming up with countless impossibilities, like how many Skrulls did he meet without realising? Tony
Happy sounded anything but happy when he said, "Boss. Just say the word and I’ll take him down."
"Mr. Stark, does Iron Man have anything to say to these terrorists terrifying citizens of the States?"
Tony’s lifeless eyes before Steve can make things right between them again.
Steve can guess. “I’m honored, sir.”
Tony hums, a pleased tone. In his hand, he holds his personal cup. Steve recognises it; it’s the only cup Tony ever drinks from when he can help it. Is it just him or is Tony sitting a little closer? Their shoulders bump into each other’s, Steve can smell Tony’s strong black coffee, feel his body heat. Is this the first time they’ve ever sat like this, the two of them? “Glad to hear that you like the coffee. Jarvis always had the best brew, even back then.”
on that), but the process is smooth and the effects are immediate.
thank you all for the kudos, comments, and bookmarks! it means the universe to me. the story started out REALLY angsty, because i had just come out of the theatre sobbing over tony at 5:30am. but now? now, in this fic? i just want. to get to some fluff already. gdi, steve, get working!
Steve’s heart rate accelerates when he finds the front door unlocked, but it is silent when it creaks open. The lights have been flipped on, and… Ah, there Peggy is, rocking gently on a rocker, back faced to him. He can’t see her face, but there’s nothing in the direction she’s looking at. Just a plain wall (who is he to judge? Natasha also seemed to have a fascination with walls).
“I know.” Steve gives an apologetic smile, because there’s not much he dares to say. Something tells him if he screws up here, in this divergent timeline, he’d never be able to live with himself. “You just have to trust me. That man on the screen is Captain America. And I’m just Steve Rogers.”
“Hey.” Tony cursed when his voice broke and coughed (
He had just stood staring at where Steve had been with his bike for so long, a distress signal was sent to Rhodes and Pepper. Courtesy of a protocol Tony had set up with JARVIS. Tony loved his AI. He should extend JARVIS’ perimeter. There was no one he trusted more.
. Not trusting himself to drive, he ordered JARVIS to take over the wheels.
. Yeah, Sam’s right. It’s a ceremony with just them, the team, the family. They’re here to make something that has been happening… Official. That’s what this is. He clings to that thought.
His eyes fall to Tony’s cufflinks, and he breaks into an almost laugh through his blurring vision. Tony smirks when he sees what Steve’s noticed - the dick shaped cufflinks Tony’d
One of their worst fights had stemmed from fear and insecurity, of the day of parting that will inevitably arrive. It’s the knowledge that comes crashing down on the darkest days, that while they have each other, they’ll never truly belong to each other. Tony had left home after dinner, and Steve had given him the space he knows Tony sometimes need. He hadn’t worried, with one of their dogs (Becky, she’s named) accompanying the man.
Steve had said that, once.
Steve manages a smile. This is almost familiar. “Alright then. Suit up, Agent.”
100%, apparently, because Tony is actually speaking English. Terms that a normal human - Steve - can understand. Or at least, he should, because he doesn’t. He thinks he doesn’t, because
And the five years he’s spent after everyone got dusted, he’s never stopped hoping, never stopped searching. For a way, for a solution, for a reason to fight.
Clearly, that isn’t the ideal answer.
, and hearing Bruce on the other end, telling him that
. That was an 1879. The two men who shaped Tony into who he was today laughed from somewhere in Hell. Whatever. He turned back to his shelf collection, picking out another bottle, when JARVIS spoke.
.” It comes out in a rush, as though if he waits one second too long, the message will disappear. Self-destruct.
Steve taps the star on his chest and he’s back in civilian clothing, though he lost the cap. Why isn’t there a cap that makes use of nanotech, or a costume that comes with a stash of caps? Oh, right. Cause they aren’t custom made for him. Dammit. He picks up a ripped curtain and clumsily wraps his shield, dropping it at his feet.
“Please, just Pepper would be great.”
It works. Tony turns back, sharply, and the glare Steve receives almost makes him want to take back the question. “We are
The silence is awkward, broken first by Tony, who huffs. “So, Fury sent you here? What was oh so very important that he decided he had to send Captain America to my house and interrupt my date night?”
“Ah, JARVIS. Ever the efficient one,” Thor praises with a smile. The camera above the TV nods in greeting.
“Seven of us,” Steve corrected. “Eight, if Thor returns.”
“I’m a SHIELD agent.” Sharon makes a gesture with her hands, like that overrides everything. At some point in his life, Steve thought so too. Now, he values lives over everything else.
could take over about right now?” She was borderline glaring at Steve, somehow still managing to pass it as a heated stare. Steve wasn’t looking at her though; he’d found a rock to kick at, and was focused on it like it was mankind’s last hope.
. He briefly wondered if it was an unnecessary trip, until a tiny rock hit his shoulder and he turned, and there Romanoff was beckoning him over.
“What? No!” Tony raised his hands above his head, the universal show of ’I come in peace’, though it looked funny as they were cuffed together. The man only narrowed his eyes, assessing, and Tony rubbed his hands over his face. "Weren’t you there when the Chitauri invaded New York? Pretty sure it made the news worldwide."
Steve waits. And waits. Thor lands beside him, nodding. “Close it.” He says it confidently, because he knows Tony will make it through. And there he is -- falling without slowing.
Once the news reach his ears, Steve’s quit his full-time job at the warehouse. He’s not so irresponsible as to take time off not knowing when or what may happen. In his letter of resignation, he includes a list of faults in the company that should be improved to ensure happiness in employees. First hand experiences makes one want to give advice, he reasons with himself.
Now that his mind is clearer, Steve realises the sun has long since risen, now high in the sky. They’re both still under the covers, and Tony is spooning him, chest pressed against Steve’s back. His hands clasp Tony’s, toying with his wedding ring.
God, you sound like an old man.”
FRIDAY’s efficiency is a life-saver, and with the tap of the Search button (he just forgets that exists sometimes, because he’s used to giving commands through his mouth), Steve pulls up a blueprint slash map of Helicarrier and his current location.
appreciate it if you stop flirting with my girlfriend. Don’t make me make JARVIS kick you out.”
"Sir," JARVIS begun, a screen appearing on the glass before Tony, and he felt a headache incoming. "To the best of my knowledge, there are no other words to identify these beings other than ’Aliens’."
And no, Steve is definitely not dealing with
"He’s still in surgery. I’m praying he’s alright, but the way the surgeon phrased things…"
“That’s you, isn’t it?” Peggy murmurs from the couch where she’d decided to take a nap on. “On TV. It’s kind of crazy, how time travel is real in the future.”
an alien army by now. What did a group calling themselves the Mandarin got up against Iron Man?
A few rounds, several bodies and overhearing an agent’s “Agent Coulson is down” later, Steve finally reaches the door he’s looking for just in time for Fury’s last words to 2012 Steve as Tony leaves.
“Damn, this is one old model.
It’s nearly dusk when Steve parks the bike in a designated spot. Dusk, because he rode a
So, instead of running in mindless circles, Steve had sat all of them down on the grass, and decided they should re-introduce themselves to Tony. The cowl came off, revealing messy, blonde hair, and a face Tony saw in nearly forty-three percent of his dreams.
That’s good enough for Steve. They stare at each other in silence. Tony’s eyes seem to darken over the seconds until his gaze becomes somewhat intense. Steve swallows, wondering if he should say something. As if sensing his discomfort(though that is obviously impossible; they can both see the loading bar progress), JARVIS speaks up then. “Sir, the analysis is complete.”
Tony considered processing that in his head, but some things were simply not meant to be. "Uh, I’m pretty sure there was some form of conversation going on back there?"
“Must you go?” She asks when she finally settles.
in Tony, and he was a man even Pepper and Rhodey and Happy and even
“Wow,” Sharon gasps.
Steve addresses the question that’s fresh in his head. “The files Fury gave me regarding the Avengers, it had your address listed in it.”
Now, Tony couldn’t have that, could he? Coming from Rogers, Mr. Stark sounded mortifying… in an oddly polite way. He shook his head, fiddling with his fingers as they no longer had anything to hold onto. “Tony. Tony is fine. In fact
The news of Obadiah Stane’s death had barely been on the news for three days before aliens started appearing from the sky, because apparently that was the new norm now. Tony had just returned from the unavoidable press conference, trying to pour himself a drink because that’s what you did when you found out your father figure was an even bigger asshole than your biological father.
is why SHIELD can’t keep their files safe. Jesus, someone ought give their engineers some lessons.” Tony inserts the flash drive into a drive reader Steve has no idea where he retrieves from and grins when the drive lights up. “Good thing I have everything here, eh. J, help me break down the data in here, will you?”
Steve shakes the memory away, thumbs over the power slider to “ON”, and an interface is projected in the air. He types in his password, and there’s suddenly so much information Steve feels overwhelmed.
Tony’s worried, Steve realises. He’s trying to brush it off like nothing, but Steve can see it now, clear as day. They’ve parted peacefully after the Battle of New York, but Steve doesn’t recall being close enough to call Tony a friend yet. Or maybe this is just the engineer’s personality. Probably reading too much into it. Yup. Plus, Steve
He waits. One second. Five. Sixty. Nothing happens.
“My boss.” Steve’s voice was clipped, precise. One of a soldier. “My mission has ended. There is no longer a reason for us to keep pretending.”
Steve had told him for the sake of getting the scepter. He just hopes that doesn’t come back and bite him in the ass as well.
Hill cleared her throat, and Tony struggled to find his words. "Sure, what do you need?"
Enjoy!!
The following days are rather uneventful, Steve supposes. Even after the events of Civil War (he thinks about that always), Steve and Natasha and Sam has always been going around, looking out for trouble. It’s just who he
(or, that is to say, to make sure Tony will have the extra help if anything does happen - which is what he’s expected from the start).
“That was a distress call from SHIELD. I have no idea what’s going on, but they need every available agent in New York City immediately.”
Steve chuckles. “I kind of am. Return from the ice and all that.”
“I swear to god, I’m gone for five minutes…”
Miles looked up, mouth still full of cereal. “Wha?”
“Well, we can’t keep him,” Clint replied. “He needs a new family. He needs a new life.”
back there.”
them, man. We were
Steve clenched his jaw and looked down, letting go of Tony.
“Andrew with the beautiful eyes!”
At a point, Tony had never thought he'd get the chance to fight by Steve's side again. And here they were.
“I have to make Nat pancakes first.”
"This is it."
Steve’s carefree smile was gone now. He looked
“I thought you realized that what you were doing was wrong,” Steve bit out between his teeth.
Tony and Pepper walked out into the hallway as the rest of the Avengers found their own nesting places in the living room and dozed off. Peter and Miles had run off to play downstairs.
"Oh fuck. Regroup.
“You were gone for a few weeks.”
“Thank you.”
“It was a mistake. I said I was sorry,” Steve replied. There was an angry edge to his voice.
Helen showed him to a room next to Steve’s and he set Wanda down on the bed. Helen injected something into Wanda’s arm and the young woman sat up breathing heavily. Pepper hovered in the doorway.
Tony started typing a text to Steve before he headed out.
He forgot what he was doing, then remembered, he was texting Pepper. He fiddled with his phone. Before he could mentally yell at himself for not making up his mind, the door to his lab opened and he sprang up.
“What is it?” His voice was calm, distant, but there was an undercurrent of anger. That was normal.
Before Steve could answer, Tony said, “No, you guys go ahead without us.”
“You’re wasting my time, Stark.”
“What?”
“Hey, I called my old man Pops. You can call me that if you want.”
"I love you too. Tony. I love you."
Bucky bowed his head. He put his hand over Sam's and held it hard.
"Turn this place into a rubble heap. I feel like otherwise we're all gonna have nightmares about it."
It was difficult to pull himself out of bed the next morning, not because he was tired, but because getting up meant getting out of a bed that had Steve in it. Tony grumbled as he made his way to the bathroom.  Steve was up only a few minutes later looking refreshed and well-rested as usual, brushing his teeth next to Tony as if it was the most natural thing in the world, and Tony figured he should get used to it.
"Oh, shut up." The second pass of Steve's shield did nothing, but Tony suspected it was only intended as a distraction. As Red Skull deflected it, Pietro came from the side in a blur.
"Good to have you back, kiddo."
“Tony,” Wanda said, reaching out a hand to his shoulder. There was a flash of red and she stepped back with a cry.
Tony raised her eyebrows and shrugged, absently running a hand through her short hair and hoping she didn’t look too scruffy. “Nothing, Cap. Still testing those laboratory muscles of yours? You know, they’re just as good as they were before the whole saving New York thing.”
He turned to embrace her.
Steve dropped his hand, laughing. “A bit, yeah.”
“Morning,” he grumbled, and Steve blushed slightly, leaning in to press a kiss to his cheek.
And yet somehow it made him sadder than before. More lonely. He hated himself for wanting something that was so preposterous for him to want, and for withdrawing when they were all so close to feeling like a team again, just because one man didn't love him the way he wanted to be loved, the way he fantasized about being loved, when he couldn't stop himself from imagining it and he was too weak to stop it.
“Come on,” Rhodey replied, rolling his eyes. “Even before you came out to me in college, I could tell...do you remember after you got your heart broken by Rumiko and we were out at a bar and we ran into my friend from the Air Force?”
Steve took his hand and pulled it to his own chest, closing his eyes. “Tony…” Tony looked at him in confusion, his heart leaping frantically in his chest. Not Stark.
Tony regarded her seriously. "Have I mentioned you're my favorite?"
Miles walked slowly into the living room and Tony nearly spilled his coffee on Sam.
Miles hugged them one last time and then ran away across the grass.
? The terror of the dream still gripped him as he tried to make himself aware of his surroundings--of Steve. He knew Steve knew plenty about survivor's guilt.
Steve put his hands on his hips with a smirk, and Tony tried not to stare at the way his tight shirt clung to his chest. “Okay, you’re on.”
“Even the best man part?”
“Can you consult me before you fake marry me next time?”
“How you doing?” Tony asked, sitting down across from Steve.
"Room's right up ahead," Sam pointed out. "I say we throw caution to the wind."
It was strange to remember. So much had changed since then, for all of them, and it made him think if they could get through this they could get through anything. This first mission as a team was proof of what they'd rebuilt since the end of their Civil War. Natasha's words echoed in his mind: we've got to hold onto this with everything we've got.
Tony talked with Sam and Carol a bit about what oversight would look like now that the SRA was gone--how much there would be and what that meant. How they could retain their independence and freedom to act while taking accountability for the damage they caused. They didn't have any answers yet, but it was a conversation that would have made Tony's stomach churn a few weeks ago, and now, it was almost easy. Not having the answers just meant they'd figure it out together.
“Captain Rogers, please be careful,” Helen begged. “I know it's dangerous for you to stay here, but told you I didn’t want to release you yet. You’re still very weak.”
Steve shook his head and smiled before walking away. Wanda came in, placing her glass on the counter quietly.
to me, man. Let me help."
When he poured himself a drink for the first time since the shooting on the courthouse steps, it was just out of habit. Muscle memory. He wasn't thinking. He rubbed his forehead and set the glass down, turning his back on it as he busied himself with running diagnostics on his repaired armor.
“Well, I’m not,” Tony gritted between his teeth, turning away. “But we’re also not actually married so it doesn’t matter.”
Steve snorted. "I know, I know. I was thinking we'd discuss a battle plan tonight and move out in the morning. I know it's fast but this may be our only chance. We can't waste it."
“I’m okay,” Steve whispered, and Tony started to cry again, almost in relief. This was the part that Pepper hadn’t been able to deal with, and Tony didn’t blame her, but it had hurt so much when she didn’t understand. Tony closed his eyes.
“Morning, sleepy head,” Tony replied, wiggling his arm out from under Steve, but Steve turned over on top of him to stop him from moving.
Bucky looked up at Sam, a thin smile on his lips. “The difference is, I don’t have anyone but him. You’re…you belong here. I don’t. I don’t have anyone but him,” he repeated. Tony had never seen or heard Bucky this scared.
Clint squinted at him. “You’re not making any sense. It’s too early in the morning for this.”
He ran his hand up Steve’s chest and kissed him again, gripping his shoulders and then sliding his arms around the back of Steve’s waist. Even with his own suit and Steve’s body armor between them, he could feel Steve’s body molding to his own. Steve tilted his head to the side, pressing himself close to Tony and breathing out a sigh when they pulled away, faces still close.
“I couldn’t have done it without
“It’s a deal then,” Tony said, extending his hand, and Steve took it. He placed his other hand over Tony’s.
Pietro came in a flash to Wanda’s room and disappeared inside. Vision stood reluctantly by the door until Pepper urged him to go inside.
“Yep! I would,” Tony said with a grin, standing up. “Good talk.”
“Karen Page,” Steve replied. “Despite the backlash following news of the Tony Stark and Steve Rogers’ marriage, many people across the United States are celebrating the relationship between the two Avengers.” Jan elbowed him, smiling, from where she was balanced on the back of the couch, braiding Bucky’s hair. Steve smiled at her and then continued reading. “In a world where homophobia is still a very real and present threat, the visibility of two beloved superheroes brings comfort to those struggling to find acceptance for their identities. Hate crimes are still a danger for LGBTQ Americans, but many are saying that the recent marriage of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers makes them they feel safer and more confident. I interviewed one young woman from Brooklyn who explained that, although she wants to remain nameless in this article, she feels protected by the knowledge that people who hate her and her identity now know that they have the Avengers to contend with if they choose to act on their hatred.”
Steve hung his head, smiling. “Okay, let’s do this.”
“Rooms…so far away,” Clint muttered. He had collapsed on the couch. The Hulk was passed out on the living room floor. Thor was snoring next to him. Natasha hopped over the back of the couch and squeezed in next to Clint.
“Thanks, Cap.” Tony flashed him a small grin.
This wasn’t a storage facility. It was a lab.
“That,” he said, pointing at her, “is a good question.” If Pepper knew he was sleeping in a chair every night by Steve’s bed, she would…it was better that she didn’t know.
“On it,” Tony replied, putting energy back into the repulsors, Rhodey right behind him. Sam soared over from the other side of the battlefield, turning on the infrared settings on his goggles. They had evacuated as many civilians from the area as they could, but only the ones they could see, Tony realized. Somewhere in the rubble below was a scared kid, and Tony wanted to find him or her as fast as possible.
Standing between Bucky and Steve, Sam smiled, his eyes hard. "What he said."
Thor nodded. “I’ve never seen this kind of hatred on Asgard. I wouldn’t expect any of my friends to put themselves in the way of it.”
He had to childproof his lab too, especially if Miles was going to be playing in there with him. He spent all day working and fell into bed late that night, regretting that Steve wasn’t lying there next to him this time.
His hands were shaking. His throat burned. He looked over at Steve in the darkness and then turned to get out of bed, the suit crumpling to the floor in pieces. He went to the bathroom and sat down next to the bathtub, finally letting tears spill down his face.
Rhodey laughed and got out of the suit with a groan.
“One day will I be a superhero like you?” Miles asked.
Tony watched Wanda's eyes glow scarlet. She gritted her teeth and
Rhodey pursed his lips. “I never said I’m an expert at this, I’m just not at your level of pining for years without doing anything about it.”
He walked mechanically to the kitchen. He found himself staring into the bottom of the third cup of coffee before anyone else was awake.
Steve was looking at him hard, and Tony had a hard time resisting him when he was like this. He looked away, and then down at his hands. He nodded. “I won’t shut you out.” God, he had never really wanted to.
"I'm assuming we all want to go fight Red Skull, but we're going to need a team that can move quickly in and out, and we can't leave this place undefended," Natasha pointed out. "We can't all be part of this one. Steve and Bucky, you have a personal stake in this. Same with Wanda and Pietro. Who else?"
kid.”
He was about to turn and go when Steve said, “Wait.”
Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a black car escorted by armored government vehicles. They stopped in front of the steps. Time slowed down and Tony’s blood ran cold as Steve got out of the car and started up towards the building. Then everything snapped into overdrive.
Steve rolled over in bed, throwing back the covers. “If you’re going to sleep in here every night you may as well sleep in the bed.”
“You gotta work on your spider sense,” Natasha pointed out, tapping the side of Peter’s head before she joined Steve on the couch.
It was fine.
“Do you like robots?” Tony asked, flashing a smile.
Steve rolled over on top of him, and Tony could feel how hard he was, his erection pressing against Tony's groin. Tony slid hands down his back, and Steve arched against him and groaned at the touch.
Tony looked up, smiling a bit. “I don’t hold it against you.”
Bucky turned to go--with the entire bottle of whiskey, Tony noticed. When he was near the door, Tony blurted out, "I wasn't going to drink it."
“Just understand you’ve saved my life in more ways than one,” Steve said quietly. “I don't know what kind of man I'd be not to see that.”
Bucky glared at Tony. “No. I’m saying it would bother me if he started dating a guy and didn’t tell me about it, because I'm his best friend. We tell each other everything. We look out for each other no matter what.” He let out a sigh. “Plus I’d want to make sure the
He wished he could freeze that moment in time.
Eve held Tony’s gaze and her expression softened. “But you did.”
“For what?”
He looked at her and sighed. "Last time all of us we were on a battlefield together...well, you know."
Tony woke up with a start, still wedged under Steve. Steve immediately moved backwards just a little to give him more room.
“You know I can’t keep anything in my stomach,” Steve sighed.
“Sam?”
Tony shook his head vigorously. “No, no, I never said anything.”
"God-"
Tony blacked out as he saw Steve being led away by the police.
“Over here!” Sam called. Steve leapt over the side of the block of stone in front of him and Hulk followed, smashing a path for himself. Clint hopped after him.
That’s when he hung up.
?” Steve repeated.
Eve’s brows furrowed. “Really? I thought you said you hadn’t been in combat before.”
“Can I just say, it is so great that you adopted Miles, I feel like he’s going to be the little brother I never had!” Peter gushed, the eyes on his mask widening. “And you guys have always been the mom and dad of the Avengers. And now you’re married—”
"It feels good to win."
“Steve,” Tony hissed, “that’s not how it is and you know it.”
Bucky high-fived him.
Rhodey sighed. “We engaged Barton, the Winter Soldier and Falcon.” He glanced up at Tony. “Didn’t see Steve.”
“I may as well have.” Steve was warm underneath his hand, and Tony could feel his heart beating.
He sat down in the chair by the bedside and drifted off, his face smushed against his hand.
you?” Her hand sneaks behind her; Steve knows it’s a gun. He’s seen her in action. And he isn’t intimidated.
Some minutes after Steve turn away from Stark Tower, a 2023 Tony in his Mark LXXXV shows up in the air with Ant-Man, here for the Tesseract.
know even the smallest details. At the same time, he hasn’t expected to arrive so quickly (really, Steve’s never taught of his kind of riding as fast, but then again he hasn’t touched a bike since Siberia).
Steve’s heart sinks when he realises he’s returned back in time to the universe where he was just two months ago, where Tony and Scott had failed to get the cube, only for Loki to use it to escape. And most likely due to the fact that he’d kissed - he really means
“Promptly, Sir.” JARVIS sounds like he has more to say, but is wise enough to keep it to himself. Steve wishes he had the AI’s tact, then maybe he wouldn’t have gotten into so many fights.
The breath he inhaled was so deep, so sharp, a knife straight to his gut. Steve turned, expression blank, and Tony willed his heart to calm the fuck down. He needed to get the facts, that was just a phone call, there was no way Steve was doing anything behind his back in the name of the
But… What
Alright, Steve’s convinced. He’ll stay over to ensure everything is going along
. It’s so easy to see that, when he isn’t busy being on guard and exasperated by Tony.
, and like the same fool he was at the tender age of fourteen, Tony listened. So he followed the crowd as they filed out of the meeting room, making small talk that anyone with half of Tony’s brain could tell was tinted with a neon shade of tension.
In hindsight, gross image, but at that moment? Yeah, that definitely summed up how he felt, down to the very last toenail.
, because it’s not
Let them come. He’d dealt with countless terrorists
Tony tilts his head almost mockingly, unimpressed. Steve knows a snarky reply is coming before he says a word, “The one-eyed jack didn’t bother stalking me further to find out that this - tonight, as per the tonights of every week - is my date night with my girlfriend?”
Hope you liked the chapter! My goal is to have the next chapter up by Christmas. The fic is steering off from what I originally had in mind, but I don't completely dislike where it's headed.
Shawarma is delayed, Peggy and Sharon, almost AU-like Stony meeting in a cafe.
, they’d actually sent it to Sharon, who will play it off like she stumbled across the information, then spoonfeed it to Fury. “
how awesome we are in the bedroom.”
She looks ready to argue. Steve’s not backing down on this one. Sharon can’t die because he’s stupid and made an alteration to the past. He won’t allow it.
“Loki,” Thor’s voice booms, loud and full of anger, confusion. “Where’s Loki? Where’s the Tesseract?”
That one is easy. Steve shrugs, trying to make himself stiff and his voice one that is strictly professional. “You’re the Avengers’ official consultant. Fury decided it’d be a waste not make use of whatever resources he can get his hands on.”
Where was he? Oh right.
loved
Steve didn’t smile back. He ended the call, hand falling to his side, still staring at Tony with the same blank expression. His heart didn’t just sink, it was falling, so close to the ground.
Steve’s smile widens. “And just Steve would be perfect, Pepper.”
right. I’m a genius.”
) before trying again. “So. I got chewed up by my assistant - Pep’s really scary when she wants to be, okay, - and she’d established it was 100% my fault and I should apologise, which I guess I can agree but honestly I’m not really good at that? So I picked up some flowers since you seem like you have a thing for them? Sorry if I’m wrong. And I, uh, really am sorry about the other day. You just make really good coffee and I didn’t know how else to show my appreciation and wow… I should really shut up now.”
Natasha, of course, calls him out on it. She’s sprawled out on the floor, massaging Clint’s calf that he’s spread on the coffee table, legs over Bruce’s. She simply applies more pressure to her ‘massage’, and Clint cries out.
Steve takes the couch. Of course he did - Tony’s mansion is private, and there is only one master bedroom, which is somewhat of a relief to know. Even then, the couch is long and big and comfy enough that it passes as a single bed. Steve wakes up comfortable, and he notices the sun is high in the sky. Usually, he’ll be awake before dawn to check on Peggy, then head for a jog, and prepare breakfast for the both of them.
"I saw Mr. Rogers leaving in a hurry and thought Mr. Hogan would be of aid in case we needed transport, Sir," JARVIS supplied before Tony could ask. Jesus, what was he thinking programming all these smartass things into his favorite AI?
He has to ask. “Why? For believing?”
Others mumble their agreement as Tony not quite whispers a “Yes!” under his breath. There is a click from the transceiver as it turns silent. The power source has been turned off. With (begrudgingly) not much of a choice, Steve picks an abandoned bike on the road, and he’s on his way back to Peggy’s.
The wedding
They really are father and son, Steve thinks even as he fights an internal battle. The talk outside doesn’t last long; it seems Howard’s just dropped by for a hi-bye before he leaves for ‘a holiday’. This is a moment Steve Rogers shouldn’t be witnessing. Yet here he is.
. And now he needed information. No one knew for sure how long HYDRA had existed within SHIELD, and the number of agents Hill, the real Fury’s right-hand, could say she trusted with utmost confidence to be SHIELD, came down to a pitiful, realistic single digit.
Tony turns to look at him with those honey chocolate eyes, “Yeah. You’re here with me now, aren’t you?” And he is just so beautiful no invasion could’ve stopped Steve from leaning in for a kiss right then.
And Steve laughs, because now, he finally understands. He beckons Tony to join him and their two dogs on the couch, cradling him. “It’s not a competition, Tony.”
Later, as it was, came sooner than expected, in a mere two hours.
That was why Tony, ever naive, ever so willing to
, then Obie (Stane, he kept reminding himself). At least this time it wasn’t anything personal.
The first to speak up was, unsurprisingly, Barton.
They have a new compound up almost immediately. FRIDAY took care of that -
Things that remind him of their Avengers days sit in one corner, on top of a dresser. The arc reactor he had on his chest when he… died, his helmet. His sunglasses - Steve can almost picture his smirk. The last outfit he wore before battle. Steve’s legs feel weak, but he manages to place his hand against the cold helmet.
Tony woke up with one of his worse hangovers. His head throbbed, and his vision was made up of a dozen moving blobs, but even through that he knew this was not his lab, or his bedroom. There wasn’t the usual greeting from JARVIS, not even a good morning, or afternoon, or evening. He’d programmed JARVIS better than that, especially when the number of things he was having nightmares of
another human being. But Rhodey was out on a mission for the government, and even though Tony knew he’d rush back, his friend’s allegiance was to his country first.
And Steve had jerked away, rubbing a hand against his ear, rubbing it like he’d been touched by poison. But it wasn’t that; Steve was just ticklish on a ridiculous level, and on some days Tony’s goatee was his ultimate weapon.
Right in 2012 Captain America’s face.
“Thanks, J. Daddy loves you too,” Tony answers just as drly. “Now, can you bring up all that stuff about the Mandarin for me?”
and wraps it in cloth before hiding it between the boxes.
"Okay, cool, great. I’ll get to the scepter thing somehow, so can you like, just try to keep the Chitauri away meanwhile?"
Pepper’s face appears on screen. “Tony? Tony, what’s wrong? Do you need me? I’m coming right now.”
They said third time’s the charm, and maybe it was. The third and last time before things went to shit again, they’d actually called him. Well, Stark Industries anyway, and a very confused Pepper had redirected the line to him (I hope you know what you’re doing, Tony! he could hear her frown through the phone line. StarkPhones were good like that). And surprise surprise, it was Hill who’d called.
"Hello, yes, I’m alive, thanks for caring. Can someone please press the big red button on my left shoulder? I won’t explode, promise."
And the rest, as they say, is history.
And Steve thinks that’s his cue to leave. “There’s something going on in New York City. You can turn on the news. I have to go back there, now.”
Tony followed the calming circles that appeared in his vision to the best of his capabilities, but he only felt more like himself when they’d reached the hospital, where he was so close to reaching Happy. A cab screeched to a halt a short distance away and Pepper flew out, her usual perfect ponytail a matching mess with her tear stricken cheeks. Before he could exit the vehicle, she had enveloped him in a tight hug.
His eyes open in panic, but Peggy’s are warm, knowing. “I…” His voice cracks. She presses a soft kiss to his lips, cutting him off.
, for God’s sake. Steve spots the piano platform easily enough - as if anyone could miss it - and the spiral set of stairs leading down to a basement where Tony’s workshop surely is. There’s the clacking of heels, and a strawberry blonde head emerged.
Peggy nods towards the dresser next to the rocker. Steve doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to Peggy referring to him like he’s a child. Like he’s younger (well, he
and yes, the scene after phil's death? steve used "tony". it's, i believe, the only time steve uses his first name in the film. totally jumped on that
It didn’t really click in yet, even as a third person, a man in a purple shirt, spoke up in a soft voice. "Hi. Um, I guess people call me… The Hulk."
but that wasn’t it. It was an alert customised for Pepper’s usage, and there were several Code Red voice messages left for him. It was four in the morning, and while Tony was used to such hours, to receive a Code Red - multiple of them - was terrifying.
“Consider it done, Sir,” the AI answers. A short few seconds later (Steve knows, because he hasn’t begun to feel
Tony smiled, a big yet private smile behind the suit, as he chattered animatedly with the Hulk. He was clearly a man of culture. By the five minute mark, Tony was sure he’d found himself a science buddy.
“Come back and visit her sometime,” he says instead, because Sharon is just moving to another part of Washington.
Tony pouts. “I don’t like that tone. J, buddy, turn on the news, will you? Let’s show the Capsicle how much of a genius I really am.”
“I know. To him, I will be just his friendly neighbor Kate.”
“Pretending.” He paused, just to ensure his heart still beat. “What was your mission?"
, “Stark, you know that’s a one-way trip?”
One night, when Tony comes out of Morgan’s bedroom looking somewhat helpless and in awe and so full of love, Steve thinks he knows.
It was only when Thor flew, his hammer leading him, and brought down lightning upon the Chitauri, that Tony truly believed him.
“It’s a… jewellery box?” His statement ends as a question, because he’s not really sure. He hasn’t exactly been around civilian women much even after coming out from the ice. Still the clueless man he was back then, it seems.
, Pepper had met up with the man in Stark Industries just hours ago. Of course they’d be shaken. Steve knows no one in this room dies today, but they, they don’t. It’s common knowledge, for God’s sake. Without thinking, he reaches out, grasping Tony’s trembling hands, hoping to ease him with the touch.
Tony still looks shaken, but slightly more composed. “Gods, Pep. What if he -- What if he’d tried to take you? And
, shit--”
“You did, sir,” JARVIS sounds smug to both Steve and Tony’s ears as the latter picks his faceplate up, slapping it back in place.
“You’re late,” she whispers, smiling and teary at the same time.
“Like my sex life has ever been private,” Tony beams proudly. “But you’ll have no one to tell, because the wedding would be private. Everyone invited would know
Disney plush since the big oaf seemed to like it so much, and there Steve was, by his bike in their backyard, his back to Tony and his name on Tony’s lips, and-
“No, it’s okay. I’ll jog back and check if there’s any civilians that needs help on my way.”
Tony blinked. "Wait, you can’t possibly mean the Skrulls?" He was fairly certain he had been attacked by the Mandarin.
Steve buys himself brown contact lenses, and finds a part-time job. Sure, Peggy’s assured him that he’s not imposing, but it just doesn’t feel
They’d laughed, then. Now Tony wondered if there was some other reason Steve didn’t want a beard. Or maybe this wasn’t Steve after all. The physique and voice and circumstance pieced together perfectly, but the man in his patriotic uniform didn’t. He briefly registered that he should acknowledge the man with actual words, now if only his body would cooperate…

you?"
And later, well, Tony would just be damned fucking glad he didn’t tell Steve all the times he’d had to leave the country he was spending time as a man in a metal tin blowing up terrorist bases like he’d very much almost done that night.
, spent two goods days convincing her it was the right thing to do, she’d be a better CEO than he ever was, he wanted to focus more on his alter ego. And she’d frowned and she’d cried and she’d screamed and she’d laughed,
Not the way he felt when the burner phone had rung, the way his stomach lurched at the thought that
They’d stayed hidden, waiting, observing, calculating. There was not much to work on, seeing as the townspeople did… nothing. They were there, they walked, they talked, but other than that, nothing happened. It took a few seconds for Tony to see what the weirdness he felt was - there were no signs of food. He turned to tell the two Agents that.
Also, he
Tony turns to him then, scoffing. There’s pain in his eyes, an emotion Steve hates to admit he’s seen too much of with Tony. “He was an idiot.”
Capsicle, seriously?”
Tony only left Happy’s bedside 40 hours later, after the doctor, nurses, Pepper, and JARVIS reassured him a few dozen times that his condition was stable, and he would make a full recovery. He needed coffee, he decided.
Tony edges closer, pressing more firmly when Steve doesn’t react negatively, and Steve relaxes as Tony mouths at him. It’s gentle, unlike anything Steve expects, but it’s… Oddly nice? Within seconds, Tony pulls away, but not completely, just enough to whisper in Steve’s ear, beard scratching his cheek,
Steve does. She leads him around the unfamiliar compound - Tony had prepared blueprints, left them in his home, where Pepper would easily find them. Blueprints of a new compound, a new home for them.
"I’m Captain America, a founding member of the Avengers. Pleasure to meet you."
He wanted to

back. When it’d begun to drizzle (it hadn’t, back then), Steve had wondered if he should’ve just taken his motorcycle. But that wouldn’t be fair to his 2012 self, he’d tell himself.
private. There are lesser people here than Steve is used to, but then again, that was before everything went to shit. Compared to the last gathering he’s been around, this is… good. Better than good. It’s his wedding day, after all.
- Tony never… they’d never… Let’s just say the faux flesh that hid the arc reactor from public eye was not something Tony wanted to explain to the hot guy he’d known for one month, thank you very much. And Steve, ever the gentleman, had never made any inappropriate moves on Tony, unknowing of the existence of the device.
None of that mattered when Tony heard Steve’s voice, coming from nowhere and everywhere at the same time. "We need help cleaning up the mess down 71st…."
Steve know what his counterpart is thinking.
Tony is preening, and Steve doesn’t have the heart to chastise him. So he just smiles. “Yes, yes, Mr. First-Name-Genius Stark.”
"Not in two more days," he answered, distracted. He stood and walked over, knocking experimentally against the transparent wall. "I’ve signed the rights over to my PA to take over the company."
As Steve gets his fingerprint scanned for exit, there’s another aftershock, likely caused by the failure of the second engine. This time, he manages to hold his ground and the door slides open. Steve is hiding behind the walls in case of any patrols, but then again, even if there were, they’re all likely headed to where the fight is.
“See, I told you,” she chastised Tony, but her voice is fond. They’re still dating at this point in time, Steve thinks. Then she turns to him too, and Steve can probably learn a thing or two about polite smiles from her. “Captain Rogers. A pleasure.”
An explosion in the distance sparks conversation. “What was that?”
Tony was pretty much half gone by then. He’d already watched this once with Pepper and Happy, another with Rhodey when he returned from a mission. Possibly a dozen more times of the original version when he was still young and carried hopes and dreams in the steps he took.
“Good morning, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS greets the moment he sits up. “It is currently 11:24am, and the temperature is a warm 80 Fahrenheit. The sky is expected to remain clear throughout the day.”
At some point, those words had become one of the few that kept him going.
Neither mentions Steve’s usage of language as they dance their promised dance. A day late, according to Peggy, voice wobbling, tears threatening to overflow. But Steve? He’s nearly 80 years late. And God, he missed her. Miss
The single word, that
“C’mon, Tony,” Steve pulls the man closer to him, setting his head on Tony’s shoulder and closing his eyes. It’s easy to forget the cuts and bruises over his body when he feels like this. At peace.  “Just imagine. If the world
And Tony seems to get the wrong idea, he still usually does. He stiffens in Steve’s arms, already trying to squirm himself out and away from the couch. “Uh.” Then, softly, “Fuck. You don’t?” Clearing his throat, in a louder voice, “I mean, of course you don’t. That was just a scenario y’know. You don’t have to take it seriously."
“What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?”
The front door opens.
“Boss… It seems Mr. Stark has left a hologram message. It also seems that it is addressed specifically for you, Captain Rogers.”
“Thanks for the forecast, JARVIS. Good morning to you, too.”
"Is that so? Also, I wouldn’t do that," the other guy drawled, his accent strangely familiar. His gaze darted to a corner, where Tony could make out the small red dot of a security camera. "They said the cell’s sturdy enough to contain enhanced beings. Tried breakin’ out countless times but never succeeded."
"Sir." It was always heartening to hear disapproval in JARVIS’ voice, in the form of a single word. It reminded Tony of his old butler, who he missed dearly. "The Mark VII is…"
When he does-- “Son of a bitch.”
Peggy seems to read his mind. “Howard had retrieved it, after you were deemed… deceased. It wasn’t hard, everyone knew you were special to him. Then you showed up, and we had that dance. I never told him, but I asked him for this. Just in case. And here we are. There may be two Steves now, Steve, but this? It’s for you, who came back for our dance.”
A voice, loud but muffled, reaches his ears: “All hands to stations.”
If only she knew.
“Peggy will be alone,” he tries a different approach.
"I see ya awake. So you’re Tony Stark? CEO of Stark Industries?"
Her eyes sparkle with interest, but Steve doesn’t share her excitement. What brought him back isn’t anything he’d want to share proudly. He’s here to fulfill the final wish of a dear, dead friend.
He feels Tony smile. “Good morning to you too, Winghead.”
“It’s a great, beautiful, sunny day. The perfect weather is expected to last till the end of the month!” That’s what the weather lady said on TV. As Steve hop into the bike, he sees that it’s true. The weather is perfect. You know, one where you wouldn’t expect your friend’s mansion is about to be blown up because everyone’s holding hands and out on a picnic?
Gods, what was he thinking? Then he reminds himself - right, time travel wasn’t a thing back then. “I’m an old friend,” he finishes lamely.
Tony tenses at that, sitting straighter, jaw tightening. “SHIELD’s onto Mandarin? Dammit, and Rhodey
“Oh, Sweetie.” Steve strokes her cheek, “I must.”

that?”
The machine Steve didn’t realise could move squeaks in what may be a nod, wheeling its way to the mini kitchen where three coffee maker sits. Tony scribbles something on a sticky bite, and drops the pen, turning to face Steve.
Then, silence.
"Positive, J." Tony was sure he would come to regret this decision some day, before or after his death, but he knew. This was the right thing to do, the first step toward trust on his end.
Everything else? Steve feels powerless. He knows this trip into the portal is the beginning of everything. This Tony will suffer the same nightmares for years to come. And Steve can only watch as he disappears inside and everyone cheers, not knowing what Tony is about to go through. That he is able to meet his demons for the first time.

He was grateful that she at least put in the effort to sound confident. It helped with his nerves, somewhat. Alrighty then. He’s just gonna waltz in, calm and collected, and introduce himself as Iron Man. Not much different than meetings, really. He could do this. Tony reached for the knob, forgetting it was an automatic door, stumbled, and nearly fell flat on his face if not for JARVIS.
“Sir,” JARVIS sounds worried, which
"A force field is protecting him. We need to get past it, and destroy the scepter. Only then will the portal close and the army be shut down."

, Steven Grant Roger’s, like how he’s in Tony’s, and not Iron Man’s. Once, they’d been unable to differentiate each other from their alter-egos.
He was falling; too fast, his entire body shutting down. This was probably it. He would die, and people would find out who he was, maybe be crowned a hero for a day or two? He recalled a conversation with Steve, seemingly so long ago, where they’d shared their childhood heroes. God, he missed Steve, the asshole, the liar, the
Let’s watch a movie, Tony had suggested.
“Understood.” The mail icon expands, and bursts open in a flashy way that Steve will usually roll his eyes at. Today, he manages a small smile, because he can pretend for a second that Tony is here. And then -- he is. A hologram. So real, yet… Not Tony.
They part to loud applause, pressing their noses together, breathing each other in. Tony already has a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Hello, Mr. Steve Rogers-Stark.”
-But then. The impact never came, and Tony couldn’t feel the pressure of the air like he did when he was falling, and he heard voices.
If there was any doubt that Tony (no,

Pepper, to her credit, is unaffected. “You’re fighting a losing battle.” Then, turning to Steve, “Captain, you will find us in the basement. The stairs are past the piano.”
Tony wasn’t sure why he hadn’t expected it. Perhaps he had, perhaps he simply didn’t think it would happen as soon as it did.
. Right, Steve can do that. The loud thudding in his ears cease, and there’s Tony, frowning at him. Next to him stands Pepper, looking equally concerned. Gods, he hasn’t even heard Pepper come down? What is
"Not exactly," Widow spoke up. "Just saying, but you might want to sit down for this. It’s a little more complicated than aliens led by the God of Mischief invading New York."
Steve had asked, with the ignorance of someone who didn’t know who Iron Man was.
Steve feels obliged to mention, to
“Yeah, wow.” It’s technically his third time experiencing this, but a part of Steve - the same part that finds comfort in vintage cafes, 40s music, the feeling of a weapon on his body - still finds the whole thing insane.

as just demonstrated. It used to be a minor issue; he could usually keep himself in check, but ever since Afghanistan, the smallest thing could set him off. Most days, he annoyed even himself.
Steve will never forget Tony’s laugh when he sees the first signs of age catching up to the super soldier in the form of a single wrinkle across his forehead. It’s one of those moments Steve captures in his sketchbook when Tony’s gone to sleep and he knows he won’t be caught in the act. This particular sketchbook is a private one, something Steve hopes he can keep to himself in this world that isn’t quite his.
Sam lifted Miles back onto his shoulders with a conspiratorial grin. “Adults are no fun.”
The photo was a little fuzzy, but the man in it was unmistakable--with gaunt, red skin and hollow eyes. The Time Stone glowed green on his finger.
Steve kept walking, heading back to his room. It was late. “It’s not your fault Red Skull is still out there. He was mine to kill, and I failed.” He pushed the door open and turned to look at Tony, his expression guarded. “After everyone who’s died, why couldn’t Red Skull be another one on the list? Why couldn’t he just stay in the past where he belongs?”
Steve took Tony’s hand gently in his and Tony opened his eyes. He hastily withdrew his hand to wipe his eyes and then awkwardly placed it back in Steve’s.
of this?"
Helen tapped her keyboard nervously, hit reply, and then hesitated. In a new tab she typed a search for Jane Foster.
Tony let out a laugh. “No, perfect.”
“Still hiding,” Tony murmured.
He threw the gauntlet he was working on as hard as he could across the room, and it crashed to the ground. He stood up, breathing hard, and that’s when he heard the door open. He whirled to see Steve standing there, his face pale. This must be taking an even greater toll on him, Tony realized with sudden shame.
“Not everything.”
Sam was carrying Miles on his back, pretending to be a plane and zooming around the living room as Miles giggled. They finally crashed on the floor, laughing, and Jan flew over and landed on Sam’s shoulder.
They were going to kill Steve today.
"Then what the fuck is it about, Tony?" Rhodey asked impatiently. He'd come up the stairway to see Tony standing there in his armor on the roof, a scene they both knew usually only happened when Tony was drunk.
“He’s stable,” Helen added. “I can’t say for certain, but there’s some hope he will recover.”
Tony turned back, and averted his eyes. “I’m sorry.”
Tony grinned and took out his phone. “Easy, Thor. No punching—not yet anyway. I’ve got to make a call.”
“Who wrote that?” Tony asked curiously, leaning over Steve shoulder.
"We're finishing this now," she hissed. "We have to take the Stone."
"I'd say anytime you're ready. It'll be good to have you back in action."
He left without saying anything else.
Tony pursed his lips. “Hey, I know how to fight without my armor.”
Bucky’s eyes widened. He lifted Miles up in his arms and spun him around. “Me and you are going to have a lot of fun. I can tell you all sorts of embarrassing stuff about your dad. So this one time, when we were kids, Steve and I were getting pizza, right, and—”
“Hey, I heard that.”
Tony hummed his acknowledgement. When he sat down, Steve rested his hand on Tony's shoulder like it was suddenly the most ordinary thing in the world, but that simple gesture made Tony's stomach turn over. He reached up to rest his hand over Steve's and held it there.
“Man, that poor kid,” Sam murmured.
then hit send, unable to stop the spring in his step as he walked to the door. It would have seemed impossible to confess those words years ago, but now it was second nature, and his heart felt so much lighter for it. They had earned this. No more secrets.
“Wasn’t combat,” Tony shot back and looked away from Eve’s searching glance.
“And it was a blast,” Tony added, spinning around and gesturing with a wrench at Eve. “Let’s do it again some time.”
He paused, glancing up from his phone as he passed Wanda in the hall.
"Tony." Rhodey moved closer, placing a hand in Tony's shoulder. "I'm glad you texted me. Now will you tell me what this is about? Please? It's okay. You know you can tell me anything and I'm always on your side, no matter what.
Their training session eventually devolved into playing with Miles, who insisted on fighting all of them. He went after Thor, who collapsed on his back and made a show of trying to fend off his tiny opponent but to no avail.
“Damn right,” Sam chirped, and Steve groaned at him. Tony noticed as he walked over to the refrigerator that he seemed stronger and was breathing easier, but even a short run had taken a lot out of him.
“I’ll join you guys later.”
“Alright, I know a great place in Brooklyn.”
“It’s not that funny,” Tony said, but laughs were still shaking Steve’s body. “Don’t laugh too hard, you asthmatic wreck.”
Tony rubbed her eyes. “Oh, god. I’ll be fine. I’ve been through much worse.”
Tony blushed hard. “I
“Oh my god. You swear like a fucking sailor, Steve, you fucking hypocrite.”
as usual, kudos and comments are SUPER appreciated!! <3
(if you're wondering how can steve be SUCH AN ASSHOLE to marry tony for the sake of it... i mean... steve has His Issues which i will happily address if i continue this)
The two stare at him, because how can Steve be so confident, so sure? How can he have so much faith? (Because he’s from the future). Then Pepper snaps out of it first, because of course she does, “Steve’s right, Tony. I already called Happy and made him swear to me that he’s headed home now. He’s in the city. He’s safe. I’m safe. You’re safe too, okay? We’re all safe; we’re right here with you.”
Steve’s words trigger something. He recognises the whirring of machinery as they come to life. The room lights up, and a screen appears before him. Rubbing his eyes, they roam about the interface, but he doesn’t understand all this. Steve hears a familiar ding, followed by an equally familiar voice ringing inside this large, empty space.
Steve smiles, pressing his lips against Tony’s again. “Hello, Mr. Tony Stark-Rogers.”
Steve sprints to his counterpart, and… Yeah, he’s knocked out cold, a cut under his left cheek, another across his bottom lip. Some gashes where machinery cut into his suit. Steve scans the area. Good; it seems mostly evacuated. Nobody’s here to see him carry his counterpart slash doppelganger (again, all depending on who you ask) toward the sounds of battle.
Of course, there’s no way Steve could’ve known. How could he? The deflected beams take down some of the Chitauri, but all it takes is that one beam which breaks a lamp post. The broken half of the post falls, crashing into a Chitauri on its Chariot. The Chariot loses control, spinning till it finally explodes.
Sharon raises her brows at that, clearly taken aback at his words. Then she laughs in a hysterical (there’s no other word for it) manner that has Steve flushing badly. “You know, Steve, you’re really bad at trying to keep secrets.”
Tony willed his heart to keep it together. He had a damned arc reactor powering his heart, did he not? Not that Steve knew what it actually powered. Not yet.
But it was too late. Steve heard him, loud and clear. I’m counting on you.
soldiers.” Then, seeing Steve’s expression, he collects himself. “I’m not marching to Fury’s fife.”
Remember what I said about canon compliance? Steve doesn’t seem to agree. I guess he wasn’t lying when he said he’s way past asking permission.
, but he can’t, not when he knows what comes next.
“Yes.” Steve keeps his voice calm, reasonable.
Sharon doesn’t return the greeting. Her face is grim, almost sour when she sees Steve. The door clicks behind her, and she presses her back against it, as though she wants to be as far away from Steve as possible while staying in the same room. Steve spares a quick glance in the direction of the bedroom. The door is slightly ajar, but Peggy shouldn’t be able to see or hear anything going on out here.
Tony ended up spending some hours patching them up before a SHIELD jet came to pick them up. Iron Man once again didn’t, because he had to return to Tony Stark’s side. He only found the slip of paper much later, a single word in a messy scrawl:
Rather than just the usual plain white text and blue glowing edges, there are information that are greyed, some in red, some green lit. Steve recognises Tony’s (or more like international) colors; those in grey are unconfirmed theories, red are proven wrong by reliable sources, and green… Well, green obviously means Tony has some kind of master plan that involves blowing up things approved.

and the crying stopped - the Avengers disassembled.
And the second thing he does, it goes without saying. He goes back in time to meet the love of his life, Peggy Carter, reliving the moment Wanda had shown him all those years ago. Except, instead of a nightmare, this is a dream come true; this is reality. He touches her, and she touches him back.
Barton had spotted him first, firing an arrow to get his attention. "Hey, Iron Man. Thanks for the save last time."
Maybe that’s why he’s so tense whenever he hears the Avengers name come up on the news.
“And Rogers totally kissed you.”
You see, the thing was, Tony was sure the universe was against him. Now that he knew there existed those of higher beings (come on, the Avengers consisted of a literal
Thor is the first to sober up, his smirk fading. “Yes. Yes, of course. I’ll head up there first. Catch up as soon as you can.” Swinging his hammer, Steve watches as Thor flies to where Loki is, the Hulk leaping after him. It’s times like this that Steve wonders why the serum didn’t come with super calves that’d let him jump eighty storeys high. Or even five storeys. That’d still be better than running up and down stairs (there’s elevators now, but he may be holding a little grudge over the time back in 1940s).

“Like, what if there weren’t any superpowers involved.”
Their story was such a cliche, Tony Stark might’ve laughed if he didn’t also feel like someone had ripped him from inside out then fed him his own flesh.
, seemed to carry an almost physical weight. Steve and Hawkeye grimaced, and Hulk looked uncomfortable while Widow and Hill’s expression turned a careful blank. Warning alarms went off in Tony’s head, but before he could redirect them away from the topic, someone spoke up.
(And because Tony couldn’t help it, he had to narrate the history part, of which Rogers - Steve, short for Steven, was his name - turned out to be the sweetest cinnamon roll who

“Carter.”
Three meetings with the Avengers team. The first time, Tony had been out scouting for HYDRA bases he thought harbored Skrulls when he’d run into Barton and Romanoff. It was on the outskirts of a small town, with a population of 1,743. Based on satellite images, the town didn’t exist; it simply popped up on the map a few weeks ago. It was in the middle of nowhere, with no resources and no electricity.
“Cap, you okay?” Tony’s rubbing his shoulders in soothing circles, and wow, it feels good. Steve actually closes his eyes and allows himself to enjoy the sensation for a few guilt filled moments, before nodding and leaning away from the touch.
“The Chitauri,” Steve grits out. “Alien invasion led by the God Loki.”
Tony has some dilemmas about being an Avenger, some feels, a little more palladium poisoning feels, some brief bonding time, mandarin attacks, Tony is attacked (again!) and a new character makes an appearance toward the end(;
It seemed to do the trick, and Steve  - no, Cap - straightened himself into a posture Tony was more familiar with, stepping into the centre of the circle. His gaze sought out Tony, and while Tony’s heart did a little jump when their eyes met, he knew Cap couldn’t see his eyes past the armor. As far as he was concerned, Tony was fairly certain Cap didn’t have X-ray eyes.
Widow bumped her shoulder into his, her voice soft as she addressed him, "Earth to Cap?"
“Hi?” An arm pushes Tony aside lightly, and Pepper comes into view, looking much younger and hopeful than he remembers. But of course; everything was hopeful before Thanos. No, even before that. Before Siberia. Before the Accords.
younger, but Steve too is over a century old by now). But he does as he’s told, reaching for the handle of the second drawer and pulling it open.
(And that was why hangovers on 11 of a 10 scale were a norm now, because it was either that or the nightmares. There was no doubt about which Tony preferred to spend the remaining of his days with.)
so here is part 1 of an intermission, things that (mostly) take place BTS/weren't shown on screen. also, we finally find out what 2023 tony asked of steve! hope you enjoy chapter 3!
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry. Thank you, Peggy. I love you.”
Nick Fury clears his throat, and they repeat the vows. More tears pool at the corner of his eyes when Tony looks him in the eye, and says “I do”, but the tears fall freely when they exchange rings, because the rings were melted and molded from his dog tags, with his carved ‘Tony’ and Tony’s carved ‘Steve’. They kiss, one of the softest exchanges between the two, and their family erupts in cheers.
He’s in the waiting room, being ’done up pretty’, and his palms are sweaty and gosh, why is he so
That night, Steve lays on the couch, blue hologram shining on the ceiling as he looks at the folder detailing the relationship of Tony Stark & Pepper Potts. He’s looking, but not really
. But what’s different is this Steve worked and earned his keep, because he wants to and not out of some form of duty.
Stark, like how most people do, and for some reason that made his smile more genuine than he’d intended for it to be. It didn’t help that other than his perfect physique, the barista actually looked

real, or so the voice coaxes, until Steve’s breathing calms.
“Certainly.”
(He totally got it; Iron Man was much more useful than Tony Stark. Iron Man could be seen as a pillar of strength, while Tony Stark was one of America’s most fucked up billionaires. It worked out for him anyway, when he recalled the announcement he’d made to the press just earlier that day. One too many people now knew his identity, and he would prefer to keep them close.)
"For what it’s worth," Steve whispered, almost to himself, "I’m truly sorry that things turned out this way." And he was gone. Just like that. Didn’t even spare a glance to the Disney plushie that was nearly ten foot tall next to the gate.
And that’s when Steve knows Tony’s wheels are turning, he’s putting the pieces together, he’s getting it.
Clint just sticks his tongue out, “Like you’d even notice me in my stealth mode. I’ll disguise myself and tell everyone about your sex life!”
What did it matter that they fight? What kind of couple didn’t? Love may not cancel out hate, but love
"Who was that?" Tony cursed how it came out a croak, a plea. Weak. He’d never had to worry about sounding weak with Steve.
“Really, Carter? A lesser man might say you need to get a life.” They share a good-natured laugh, but Steve’s blood runs cold.
Tony looked away from Bucky’s piercing gaze. “Talk later, metal man.” He knocked his knuckles against Bucky’s prosthetic arm and Bucky followed him humorously with his eyes as he walked off the mat.
“Get your own bed, Rogers,” Tony mumbled. But Steve’s head had already nodded down. Tony could barely see the outline of his face in the darkness. Just a little bit of light shone in from the window. Tony let out a quiet laugh and pulled the blankets up over Steve.
Tony didn’t want a fight. He just didn't have it in him. “Like I said last night—”
Tony tossed the paper away. When he turned around, Rhodey was standing in the doorway. Tony sighed and dropped his head into his hands as Rhodey sat down next to him.
“It’s okay. A lot of people from my generation are homophobes, but none of Steve’s friends.”
Peter clutches his hands to his chest. “Now that this is—now that—if you ever need a babysitter if you guys like, you know, need any alone time, I’m the guy to call! Me and Miles had a lot of fun, and I got him to bed on time and everything and—”
"Then what is this doing for you exactly?"
“I just wanted to make sure you’re okay,” she said, holding him by the arms, looking at him closely, and Tony squirmed as usual under her attention.
“This early in the morning? After you just went on a run?” Tony asked in disbelief. “Ugh, you’re horrible. Maybe in a bit. Keyword being maybe.”
He rubbed his eyes. “What the—”
good to punch him in the face. And now he's gone and it helps me put another piece of my past to rest." He sighed.  "I'm not looking back. If I’m going to be honest...it feels like I'm just getting started."
He wasn’t surprised when he woke up in the middle of another nightmare, staring into the eyes of the Iron Man suit which he had somehow summoned in his sleep. It was just a matter of time before this shit happened again.
“Married, but never dated. This is embarrassing. Let’s fix this right now.”
“My friends! I hear that you have been wed, and have adopted a son? Where is the little rascal? I want to meet him!”
“Okay, if you’re some sort of relationship expert, how did you figure out that Carol was interested in you?”
Steve turned and surveyed the rest of the Avengers. "I know we're all anxious to get out and kick some Nazi ass, but are you guys gonna be okay sitting this one out?"
Tony composed himself and turned back to look at Steve. He had to sell this lie convincingly, because he wasn’t ready to tell the truth. “I wanted to tell you…that you’re the best man I’ve ever known. That I care about our friendship. That I’m sorry.”
"One more thing, could you do me a favor?"
“Don’t worry, we’ll get this sorted out. I’m just really excited to meet Miles when I’m back on the east coast.”
Natasha grabbed the invisible boy off Sam’s shoulders. “Gotcha.”
me now? You're trying to help me--by stealing whiskey out from under my nose?"
It had felt like their home.
He collapsed on his work table, alone for the first time in over a week. It wasn’t worry for Steve, or guilt, or shame that was foremost in his mind, it was exhaustion. He could barely lift his head when he heard the knock on the door.
"As long as the Avengers exist, I wouldn't be too sure of that. You don't scare me. You already tried killing me, and you failed," Steve said. Tony thought he sounded beyond pissed off that Red Skull was still alive and talking.
She had flown to New York immediately, a whole fourteen hours from Seoul. Tony didn’t remember how much money he had promised her but it had been a lot. He had almost forgotten about calling her until she appeared in the dark room and taken his body. It was an afterthought. Tony had already given up.
Steve’s brow darkened. “Even after everything that happened, how could you think I
“Tony, what’s the status?” Steve asked, coming up behind him.
“Sure, honey,” Steve said sarcastically with a wink before he disappeared down the hallway.
Tony shook his head. Rhodey exchanged a glance with Pepper and then said, “We’ll see you tomorrow.” He put a hand on Tony’s shoulder and squeezed it.
Eve’s brows furrowed, her jaw set once more. “Don’t joke around. You could have died. You almost did. I don’t need to be anywhere but here, keeping an eye on you.”
Tony grumbled but couldn’t help smiling, especially when a tiny spidersuited Avenger ran into his arms.
Steve was blushing harder now. “What else was I supposed to do?”
Sam came in. He looked at Tony, how his face was smudged with grease, then around at the chaos of his lab.
, Steve,” Tony hissed. “How long before he notices we don’t have wedding rings?”
Although Tony had seen pictures, and he was pretty sure Steve could make him swoon at any height.
“It wasn’t weird, it was—”
Tony could hear an angry edge to Steve's voice. He squeezed Steve's hand briefly before Steve strode to the front of the room.
“You will be a great warrior one day, little one,” Thor said, laughing as he lifted Miles up.
Tony grabbed Steve and pulled him down into another kiss to wipe the satisfied grin off his face.
“Now that I’m done telling the little fucker all about your embarrassing childhood, you’ve got some explaining to do, Rogers.”
Rhodey picked up the paper and looked at it. Tony figured that he and Steve really did look like a married couple in the picture, with Steve’s hand resting over his. He winced.
Tony raised her eyebrows, feeling a bit of a blush on her cheeks. “Really? You and me?” She shook her head. “
“When are you getting back?”
“You alright, man?” Rhodey asked as they flew back to the Helicarrier. “Did someone hit you hard in the head or something?”
With an eye on Pietro, he said through the comms, "Wanda, I want you to hold onto the Stone. In case we get attacked again, you’re the strongest. Room's clear."
He was pacing back and forth in front of the window. Finally he hung up the phone after saying a brief thank you. He looked pale and exhausted. “Police confirmed that his mother Rio Morales died in the attack. Miles’ father Jefferson Davis is listed as missing.”
“You know why, you slacker,” Tony said in exasperation. He rolled his eyes, smiling. “Okay, there’s more in the kitchen.”
“Thank you, for everything,” he replied. “But I have to go.” He stumbled and Tony rushed to his side, holding him up by the waist, all 200 pounds of supersoldier. Sam was there a moment later just to make sure Tony got him.
Tony looked down, smiling despite himself. “I always thought you’d have kids before I did. If I even had kids.”
“Awwww guys,” Clint exclaimed, attacking them with a hug as the Hulk put his arms around the whole pile and squeezed. Jan shrank as the air was knocked out of all of them and landed on Steve’s shoulder as they all broke apart, laughing.
Tony breathed out a sigh, and looked away, and so it caught him by surprise when Steve’s arms were around him suddenly. Steve hugged him gently, arms resting on his back, and Tony let his face fall down onto Steve’s shoulder.
"I don't trust you either."
“S’okay,” Hulk grunted. He lumbered back to the edge of the rubble and sat down, causing a slight tremor. “But Hulk good babysitter.”
I know I can’t hope for that. It’s just…not in the cards. At least I’m here, right? I thought it would be better if I just left, but—”
Tony let out a laugh. “I hope you won’t be too good.”
By the time he was finished with the suit it was after 2 A.M. and he collapsed over the table and the horrible unseated feeling came rushing back. He felt sick to his stomach. Looking around frantically for something else to work on, his eyes fell upon the couch on the other side of his lab. This was not the time, he thought with a groan. He was doing everything in his power
“That’s kinda gay,” Clint muttered.
“Who’s the scary metal arm guy?” Miles mumbled, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck.
“What? Yeah. Sure.”
“The war was killing me, Steve,” Tony said, afraid to look at his face. The silence that followed was somehow worse.
“Miles!” Nat called, “if you’re finished eating do you want to come play with Aunty Nat?”
“Did you see Nat and Bucky?” Sam asked.
Tony smirked. “Shoulda slept in my room last night,” he replied.
Steve looked down. "There's a reason I never contradicted you."
When the meeting was finally over everyone stood up and shuffled towards the door. Tony tried to find Steve, but he had disappeared. Before he knew it, he was the last one in the room with Fury.
Tony was reluctant to let him go.
Steve began to smile. "Yeah, I guess I have."
“What? I’m right here, if you need me for anything.”
“This is fantastic!” Thor exclaimed. He hugged Peter, nearly popping the eyes right out of his head.
Steve had a distant look in his eye. “Don’t worry, Tony, I know how to fix this.”
Steve raised his eyebrows. “Then don’t make me.”
. They’re known as the group of superheroes who saved New York from an alien invasion.
So he jogs freely. He’s memorised the key navigation points across the vessel from the blueprint, and throw in his super senses? Steve’s just about 100% sure he’s headed in the right direction. But he’s not exactly alone; he can hear it, the light sound of footsteps. The kind that scream “I’m a bad guy so I have to be silent when I walk” - provided you can ever hear the scream. Steve looks around for doors - any hiding spot, really - but there aren’t any. The footsteps are getting closer, and while Steve would rather not interfere where he doesn’t need to, the situation is unfortunately turning into just that.
The silence was a loud enough answer if Tony ever heard one (he had). Then the engine roared to life, and Tony flinched at the thunderous sound, reminding him of less pleasant times.
The bottle of wine slipped from Tony’s fingers, shattering on his marble floor.
“You’re all ganging up on me!” Clint digs his face into Bruce’s shoulder. “We have the worst team Mom
No, Steve thinks. He can’t let Tony just walk away from him like this. The Avengers need to work together. He needs to prompt the genius out to the surface. But… How?
"Right." Tony blinked, dropping himself into a matching sitting position. "Now
. It takes a few seconds for the ringing to stop, and Steve presses it against his ear again.
At this point in time, Steve doesn’t ponder over it. He just needs to take action, because he’s lived long enough to learn that sometimes that moment of hesitation costs
The absurdity, the
“I’m Agent Maria Hill.” Pointing to what was likely a security pass with a younger version of her face on it, “Director Fury and I are the only ones with a Level 10 and 9 clearance, and the only ones in SHIELD who know Iron Man is Tony Stark. Excluding Iron Man himself, of course.”
, they aren’t responsible for the beginning nor the end) are forced to ‘get their asses off the field or be put down forcibly’, and Nick Fury is really quite terrifying when he wants to be, so they listen. But things are hard when you’re a superhero - what did you do when you didn’t have a world to save?
. It’s Tony, his face cut off, seeming to be in the midst of arguing with someone. “Pep, I’m telling you, there is no way Captain America is standing outside
“There may be Enhanced involved, Stark.” Steve feels the need to stress that, knowing that Tony is already thinking of the ways he intends to use his tech to contribute. “At least, that’s what all we have now is pointing to. But we’re -- the Avengers… After the Chitauri invasion… Fury mentioned that there
He’s still riding past the rows and rows of pine trees, but the place is huge
"Are you sure, Sir?" JARVIS had asked, hesitation from what Tony knew was recognition of the names whose profiles he’d collected. DUM-E wheeled over to him when he gestured at the robot, claws wide in greeting before clasping in joy as its creator gave it pats. DUM-E was without doubt a dummy, but he was a good-natured one.
“It’s something I call the Avengers Initiative. I’m Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD. And I would like Iron Man to join the Avengers.”
Tony turns away, again with that frown Steve wishes he knows the meaning behind, but never will. “Noit’snothing,” Tony mumbles in Tony Language, which easily translates to ’No, there’s something but I don’t think I want to tell you what’, something he and the rest of the Avengers have learnt soon after the Battle of New York. Instead he gestures to a spare tool under one of the work desks, which Steve pulls out to sit on.
“Yeah?” He thinks he understands what Tony is trying to say. There are days, really rare ones, where adrenaline is coursing through his veins and he cannot rest, his mind needing to run. Those days are when Steve allow himself to wonder, to imagine what life would’ve been like if he’d woken up in the future to learn that the war is over, he can go and live his life a free man. A common man, as common as he can be, because he’d be the weirdest thing science had ever created, and he would be fine with that.
Months of peace, calm, and planning later, news of the Mandarin has reached the people. Steve knows it’s time to act.
All of a sudden, a face pops up on the glass. It’s small and rectangular and there’s a background and oh. A screen. It was a
“Cap?” Tony’s touch startles him out of his panic, and Steve realises his breathing is uneven. Why is Steve panicking when Tony is the one that needs his help? He feels himself being gently pushed onto the same stool Tony had been sitting on just seconds before. “Hey, pal. You need to breathe.”
I won’t get involved directly. But only because Rhodey told me the same thing just earlier today.”
Steve knows what’s happening. He’s been through it; one of the days he’ll never be able to forget, even if he wants to. He’s been back on this very day just two weeks ago, just slightly later in time, to restore the Infinity Stone. The Helicarrier is under attack by agents under Loki’s control. She’s going down, while the 2012 Steve and Tony are going to fix up the engine.
“Yes. Yes, you are.” Peggy turns to her great niece, patting her hand affectionately. “Sharon, darling, show him in, will you?”
? Sam laughs as he dabs at the beads on his forehead, only for more to take its place.
The first touch of their lips is light as feather, Tony because he’s actually
“Then give me a lift.”
He pales almost comically; Steve bites down on his cheeks to stop from breaking into a goofy grin, while on his lap Tony just bursts out laughing. “Jesus Barton, you look ridiculous. I hope you caught an image of that, J.”
Tony briefly wished Rhodey was here; he was always better at handling tough situations, at the act of
Steve already misses his childhood slash best friend. Tony’s insisted in his message that Steve “
“FRIDAY? Good morning to you too. Do you mind telling me what’s going on here?”
Someone cleared their throat. Hill, it was Agent Hill. "Sorry about that, Iron Man. We had to refrain from acting suspiciously while we left the Helicarrier. Otherwise we wouldn’t be able to talk."
2012 Rogers sigh, as if exasperated. He probably is. “Alright, Stark. I guess we could all use a meal first? Someone help Doctor Banner regain his senses?”
Right. Steve nods. “I’m in your debt, Ms Potts.” Then he steps in, his heart beating uncharacteristically fast. Maybe because he’s scared to be found out? Because he is technically lying to Tony. And he’s sworn, after Siberia, that never again will he tell Tony a single lie, for his own good or not. But this
Steve’s voice died down, and Tony went stiff within his suit. He wasn’t sure he could feel his legs. Or hands. Or his body. Then Steve spoke again.
Then hologram Tony disappears. An automated voice that of FRIDAY rings out, “Message self-destructing in five seconds... Four... Three... Two... One...”
Steve’s forgotten about the transceiver in his ear he took from his counterpart until a sound close to the aftermath of an explosion has him jerking and reaching to pull the thing
Tony sighed. “And that used to be so cute. Steve, will you get our child down from the ceiling. I’m not tall enough for this shit.”
“Well I for one don’t want to do this all day. I yield.”
Tony’s heart
Eve folded her arms across her chest. “That’s right. And you don’t look too good. Have you let anyone look at those scrapes since the battle?”
“How you feeling, Cap?” Tony asked, but his voice came out more strained than he wanted.
Helen opened the door. She smiled brightly, unable to hold herself back, still in disbelief. “He’s awake.”
Tony turned away abruptly, tears in his eyes again.
“Was it touching where the scar was--was that the thing that upset you, because I should have been more thoughtful, I shouldn't have touched—”
Steve's hand tightened Tony's shoulder. "That's him."
During breakfast the next morning, Miles kicked Steve abruptly under the table. “Pops, how come you slept in a different room from Dad last night?”
When they came back to Stark Tower everyone was visibly more relaxed. Wanda was slumped across one of the couches trying to kick Clint off the end where he was trying to fight for some space. Pietro, reduced to a sluggish speed after all the fighting that day, was watching with amusement. Rhodey had given up trying to interfere. Bucky and Natasha were busy discussing knife fighting techniques in excited, hushed tones in the corner, while Vision listened politely. Jan was taking something out of the oven and trying to use her oven mitts to fend off Carol, who was always on the lookout for a free meal.
Sam nodded. “It’s over, buddy.”
"That can't be comfortable with the armor-"
Steve snorted. “Do you remember what you said to me…” He looked up at Tony. “You were ready to give your life to stop me. You—”
“That’s only if you get turned down by the agency,” Sam offered. “You’re Captain America, man. I think that should go a long way.”
“Tony?”
Carol squeezed his shoulder before sitting beside him.
Tony glowered.
Rhodey raised his eyebrows. “Really? Then why do you look so miserable?”
“My name’s Jan. What’s your name?”
Anger flashed across Sam’s face. “How dare you say that to me,” he said, his voice low. “I care about Steve just as much as you do and you God damn well know it. I know you were his friend from way back when and everything, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of us—” he motioned to Tony and Natasha “—won’t be broken into pieces if he doesn’t make it out of this alive.”
Natasha sat quietly at the foot of the bed. “Hey Steve,” she murmured. Steve sat up a bit as he looked at her, and then his eyes flickered up to Tony in the doorway. Tony swallowed hard and walked mechanically to the chair on the other side of the bed, barely able to stop trembling.
Steve rested his hand around the back of Tony’s shoulder, pulling him closer. “Well this wasn’t such a bad breakup.”
“Aww, that’s terrifying,” Clint said half-heartedly as he stared into his cup of coffee. “Now there are three spider-people.”
“No, I…uh…” Tony crumpled towards Steve and Steve immediately pulled him closer. Tony felt something in him collapse at the sheer relief of having his arms around him again. Steve’s shirt front was totally soaked with tears now.
“Isn’t it? In all the years you’ve been fighting, there hasn’t been any grey area? Something that made us compromise our own ideals in the pursuit of our
After going back and forth and back and forth on whether or not to do it, Tony finally sent Rhodey a text. It read, "
“Fight back, Stark,” Steve hissed between his teeth, raising his fist again.
"God, I've never wanted to kiss you as badly as I did just now," Tony muttered, leaning back, feeling giddy with adrenaline. "Who knew punching undead Nazis into smithereens made you look this
“Cap, what are you
“It’s okay to miss her,” Tony whispered. “And you should come talk to us about this whenever you want. Captains orders.” Steve nodded and wrapped his arms around both of them, resting his chin on the top of Miles’ head.
“No, no, Jesus Christ,” Tony replied, almost choking on his coffee. “It’s just, Miles, our, uh, kid, thinks we’re married but…I don’t think Steve swings that way.” Bucky shrugged. Tony looked at him askance. “I’ve known the guy for years, I think I would know.”
Tony helped Steve to his feet and to the kitchen. He didn’t need to rely on him quite as much this time, but when they got to the table, Steve looked slightly ill.
Natasha lifted him off her shoulders and put him down. “Because I’ll be able to find you anyway.” She tickled him until he squirmed and shrieked and hopped into Steve’s lap.
Tony smiled. “What are we getting ourselves into, Cap?”
“Okay,” Tony replied, and then leaned in to give him a small kiss on the mouth. He still couldn't believe this was real as they pulled apart and he squeezed Steve’s shoulder.
Bucky seemed to ignore that and walked slowly into the room, glancing around. He stopped in front of the table and then leveled a look at Tony. "What is this."
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, and Steve cringed, eyes widening. Tony snapped his faceplate shut, waved a hurried apology to Fury, grabbed Steve with one arm and blasted off into the sky.
He shook his head in confusion. “Was that some weird magic residue from the spell, or something? Please tell me you know what that was.”
“Nausea?”
Steve was gasping for air now, and Tony hastily leaned over and grabbed his inhaler from the bedside table.
“Sleep, Tony,” Rhodey reminded him, and Tony looked up. Rhodey motioned with his head to Pepper, who stood behind him, a worried expression badly disguised on her face.
“We could probably be common-law married at this point anyway, since you’ve lived with me ever since you came out of the ice—”
“I’ll come join you later.”
"It’ll take a while. Helen said—”
“I’m not saying you don’t have every right to hate me."
Tony blinked. "Well yeah, have you seen yourself?" He squeezed the sides of Steve's waist.
Sure enough, Steve was punching the heavy bag so hard it was a wonder it was still hanging. He stopped as Tony entered the room and stood breathing heavily.
"Son of a bitch! You've been doing that to me for years?"
“Food,” Tony mouthed at Steve, pointing at the kid in his arms. Steve gave him two thumbs up and went into the kitchen.
“You guys coming?” Carol asked through Tony’s earpiece.
“—African-American, about five years old,” Steve was saying. “Yeah, he said it was Morales. Anyone under that name?”
up, I don’t care if Cap’s entire forces are attacking us. Make Carol or Jan take care of it. I’m beat,” Rhodey joked and Natasha gave a hollow laugh as she walked out of the room. He looked up at Tony, and Tony saw how tired he looked.
He kissed Miles on the forehead and pulled Steve after him out onto the balcony. He cleared his throat, suddenly nervous.
His phone buzzed seconds later as he was climbing into the back of the jet-- it was a too-close picture of Thor smiling, behind him a chaotic battle, and the caption "
Steve moved away from him suddenly, and Tony sprang away as if he had been struck, getting out of bed and backing away.
“I did,” Peter yawned in the doorway. “I’m exhausted. What I miss?”
Bucky smirked. “Get it, Steve.”
Steve easily got an armbar and then helped Tony to his feet. Tony used that moment to take him off guard and trip him but in a moment he had already lost his position and Steve had pinned him again.
"Alright, listen up, knuckleheads," Carol began, "this is the intel Fury sent me. He's been tracking the Time Stone for some months now. Before that, it's location was unknown for decades. Recently he tracked it's signature to this location in Virginia." She pointed to the screen. "Seemed to be an abandoned building. Or it did until they got this." She flipped to the next slide.
Pepper pulled him into another hug. “I love you. I love
"Talk later," Steve interrupted, his voice hoarse. "Done plenty of that for now."
"Impossible!" Red Skull snapped. "The Avengers were divided, split into factions, weakened--the perfect time to strike!"
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said, looking up as Steve and Sam came in. “Sam. How was the run?” He walked into the kitchen with them, poking Steve in the ribs and then leaning back on the counter.
“Steve,” Tony pleaded, “I know…how it is, but it’s just that I
“Alright, fine. But no invisibility. No wall-climbing. No stinging.”
“Well, we can’t be sure,” she murmured. “It might be best to take him someplace safe, especially since we don’t yet know who was behind the assassination attempt.”
Tony sent a quick text to Thor on the off chance he's respond, though they hadn't heard from him in months.
"You focused?"
Steve blushed a little at the compliment. “Nat’s been playing with Miles. She thinks she figured out more about his powers.”
“He will
Tony winked at her and finished his message to Steve with
Steve punched him none too gently in the arm.
Steve shrugged. “I…guess?”
Bucky shook his head. “No. No.”
Wanda hung back with him as they stepped out of the building.
and with a deafening rumble the building before them collapsed into dust.
In a rush he took off his helmet and crumpled against the edge of the table, and the tears finally streamed down his face. It was almost a relief. His hands shook on the side of the table. “After everything I’ve done, after everything we’ve been through together, not…”
“Bedtime no later than 8,” Steve warned.
“You should go find Miles. He’s with Peter. I’m just gonna…”
“Hey.”
Bucky saluted.
Sam frowned, raising his eyebrows. “Well you’re not wrong.” He slapped Steve on the back and winked.
“Can we build more robots?” said the small voice.
Tony paused. "Oh. But, you're not, are you?"
Tony looked at him in consternation. "News to me, Rogers."
“Since when did you want a family?” Steve asked sharply.
“Can’t feel the difference, right?”
Steve clenched his jaw. “That’s not what I meant.”
Miles looked at Steve, his eyes wide. “Can I annoy Uncle Bucky too?”
The mood that day was quieter, tense. They all knew they had to put all their efforts into tracking Hydra, but when they couldn’t use their pent-up energy for anything better, they used it for training.
“We’ll take care of this, Steve. You have a team now. I put you in danger, but it won’t happen again—”
Tony whirled to see Bucky elbowing a guy in the face, and then knocking him out with a quick strike of the end of his gun. But the noise of the man's yell was drawing more attention.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “What can I say, kid. You got some talent. I think we’re going to need at least five more.”
“We don’t want you to worry,” Steve started. “Your dad and I are just fine.” He took Tony’s hand and Tony stiffened slightly. Steve gripped him more firmly and gave him a look. “We just wanted you to know that everything’s fine. We’re not getting a divorce. It’s just that your Pops sleeps in a different bed sometimes…when he has to get up really early in the morning for a run.”
“And give me back mine,” Carol added, motioned Rhodey to come over and join her on one of the couches. She flashed Tony a thumbs up and a mischievous smile.
Tony glared at him from where he was pinned underneath Steve. “Hate…you…”
Rhodey made a “you know that’s not
Rhodey pulled Tony into a hug and then squeezed Steve’s shoulder. “Congratulations, you guys. I’m proud of you.”
“He will,” Tony urged, squeezing Steve’s shoulder gently. “You won’t get out of your fake marriage that easily,” he added. Steve raised an eyebrow. “Kiss for good luck?”
"Maybe the monsters are the ones who should be afraid," Steve suggested, smiling. He kissed Miles on the forehead and tucked him in. "I love you, Miles. Get some sleep. I know you're excited about tomorrow, but don't stay up too late fighting those monsters, alright? Captain's orders."
Tony rubbed his face. “Yeah, he does, and we need to make sure whoever takes care of him can actually help him. For whatever reason, he has these powers and—”
Tony rolled her eyes. “I’m sure there are even some young men who’d find you attractive even if you are the dull soldierly type.”
“As soon as she finishes dealing with the frost giants, I promise.”
Steve collapsed on the couch and Tony leaned down and squeezed his pecs. “Morning, gorgeous.” Steve shook his head, smiling and doing a bad job of covering up his blush.
“I figured out why our little Spiderman alarm clock didn’t come in to wake us up today,” Tony said as he jumped back into bed. “He’s still asleep.”
Sam and Rhodey had just landed outside when they received a call from Fury.
Steve’s jaw hardened as tears fell down his face. “Can you forgive me?” he asked simply. "For losing sight of our goal to make this a safer world?"
Steve smiled slyly. “Really? Why’s that?”
“Yeah.” Steve breathed out. “Now are we gonna finish this run, or what?”
He woke up slowly, tugging at something on his wrist. His whole body hurt in ways he had never thought possible. Opening his eyes, Tony realized it was an IV. He was in the hospital.
Tony grinned. You didn't want to piss off Wanda. "Got any ideas?"
Tony sighed. “I could definitely be a little braver about this, I just wouldn’t be able to stand the look on Steve’s face if…” He shook his head and squared his shoulders, putting on his best Captain America voice. “I’m sorry, Tony, but I don’t feel the same way about you. I just think of us as friends.” And then we wouldn’t be friends, and I would’ve ruined it and it would all be my fault.” Tony held his forehead in his hand.
“Karen,” the reporter responded, getting down on one knee. “What’s your name?”
“Is there a not-cool uncle?” Miles asked in confusion.
“OH MY GOD!” Peter yelled, jumping up and down. “But you were saying—”
“No,” Tony groaned, trying to fend him off.
Tony lay back in exhaustion on the mat. “You already are,” he said with a smile. It wasn’t the first time Miles had asked that question.
Might be true in time--it had taken time for him to be able to think about Pepper and not instantly want to get blackout drunk. It still hurt a bit even now to remember the time they had together, if he was being honest. Time could heal this thing over Steve...but right now all he could think was that sounded like such a lie.
Steve’s brow furrowed in pain, and after an agonizing moment he finally pulled away. “I can’t do this,” he whispered.
“He’ll be okay,” she insisted. Tony nodded absentmindedly.
. You have your team. If you want to believe you’re alone, that’s on you.” He put a firm hand on Bucky’s shoulder. “But you have me, okay.”
“Adopting a kid might be the most normal thing we’ve ever done,” Steve muttered and Tony massaged his forehead. “And you’re my best friend,” Steve continued. “I trust you. I don’t want to do this without you.”
Sam grinned and Steve put his head in his hands. “Glad you asked. His name is Bucky. We play a fun game where we annoy Uncle Bucky whenever we can.”
"Bottom line, I'm not making decisions without your guys’ input. We'll work together and figure things out," Tony said. "If you'll take me at my word."
“Why are you here? If you can’t forgive me—are—are you shutting me out because you can’t forgive me?”
Steve held his head in his hands. “I do need you, Tony, I need you—”
“No.” Tony blushed as he glanced at Steve as he stepped out of his suit. “Oh. Uh. Yeah, you know actually it’s our anniversary, buddy. That’s why…” He motioned between himself and Steve. “All the smiling and blushing.”
Steve sighed, pouring some cereal into a bowl.
He ripped the IV from his hand and staggered to his feet, almost doubling over in pain. The Iron Man armor crashed through the wall and he was in it in a second, the faceplate snapping down and repulsors flaring as he flew out of the hole in the hospital wall.
Tony wondered if Sam believed he'd be willing to break the law. He knew how it looked--until now he'd done everything the government asked. He'd done it partly because someone had to be there and better him than anyone else. But there was no looking back. He'd wanted control over the process and in doing so had lost control of what really mattered.
Tony yawned and sat up. “You know what’ll make you both feel better? Ice cream.”
Miles put his hands over his eyes and started to count.
Tony turned abruptly to Natasha. "Yeah?"
"As much as I hate to agree with him, Stark is right,” Bucky murmured, and Tony turned to see the man standing on the other side of the kitchen.
Steve read the headline aloud. “Why Captain America and Iron Man made America safer by coming out.”
“We’re not splitting up—we’re not together. Steve. STEVE.”
“Even if he was adopted,” Steve interrupted, “how is anyone going to be prepared to help a kid who turns invisible and climbs walls?”
Tony shook his head vigorously, partly to reassure himself that he was awake and not imagining what Steve was suggesting. "What?! No." He squeezed Steve's shoulders and let his hands slide down the front of Steve's chest. "You sure you don't think this is moving too fast?"
“My turn.” Natasha swooped in. “He’s not too young to start learning jiu jitsu, is he?”
She stood before the table. The lab had been cleaned out. That meant someone had made it out before she stopped them. Wanda cursed under her breath. There was a safe, still locked. She crossed to it, hesitated. Then, reaching out her hand, a whisp of red wrapped around the lock and it sprang open.
"Tony!"
Tony looked down. “I wasn’t…thinking about what you wanted, or-or what I meant to you—or what you would do. I was just asking for you to end it,” he said quietly. “And I really thought you were going to. I really did.”
Tony groaned. “This is getting so old. How many times do I have to have this conversation? We adopted a kid—”
Bucky opened and closed his hand so Miles could hear the noise again. “Isn’t that cool?”
missed this, I gotta say."
“He’s so young,” Steve muttered to Tony. “Poor kid should never have to see any of this.”
Helen sent Tony a more advanced antidote she had developed since Steve had left the hospital. He watched Bucky inject it into Steve's arm, and Steve cracked some jokes about wanting to go run a marathon, but of course the effect would be much slower than that.
Steve shook his head. “What matters is that it did. We have Miles. We have each other.”
Steve’s cheeks turned pink and he smiled. “Not technically. I mean, you’ve taken me to dinner plenty of times.”
Tony waved him off, and Steve didn’t say anything to correct him either. It was a little bit weird that they kept it a secret, Tony thought, but then again, there was nothing to it, because there couldn’t possibly be anything to it. Him and Steve? Never going to happen. Steve didn't even date women. He certainly didn't date men.
“When do we get to meet your sister?” Natasha asked, getting up and hugging Thor.
Tony quickly put his hand on Wanda’s shoulder. “No, no. He could never—he’s going to be here any second,” he said with a smile. “You know how he is.”
“Yeah.”
They were tangled together like they usually were in the morning, and Tony was pleasantly warm, half in between sleeping and waking. He sighed, melting against Steve, hoping that it could last a little longer, he brushed his hand down to Steve’s waist, accidentally catching the bare skin below the hem of his shirt. Steve started under his touch. He looked down at Tony, sleepy, arms wrapped around him. Tony looked up at him in confusion.
“No, Steve, God no.”
"Shut up, Stark, we're having a moment."
was good enough for him.”
“Hey, we need a babysitter,” Tony realized. “Why don’t you watch Miles while we’re gone?”
When they came inside, arms still around each other, Sam was smiling and shaking his head. “Well done man.” He came over to hug Steve, Natasha following right behind him with a small smirk on her lips, wrapping her arms around Tony. Miles climbed onto Tony’s shoulders as Bucky raised his eyebrow at Steve and elbowed a very satisfied looking Rhodey in the ribs before they squeezed into the group hug, Carol and Thor right behind them.
Tony raised his eyebrows. "Is that a challenge?"
Hand in hand, grinning at each other, they started off.
“No, no. We’re just thinking of names right now.” They followed Carol and Sam into the living room. “If we have a girl, we both like the name Riri.”
“Well this is no place for children, invisible or not,” Natasha murmured, lowering her gun. “Tony? Infrared scan would be helpful right about now.”
Tony rubbed his eyes. “Oh, uh…”
Natasha came in carrying Miles on her shoulders.
“Maybe it’s better this way,” Wanda mused, looking up at Tony. “You saved my brother, I save yours.”
“But why?” Miles asked, astonished. “He loves you.”
The door opened and Carol strode in, taking off her mask and running a hand through her short hair. “That’s it for Galactus this time around. Nice job on your end, guys.” She stopped at the edge of the living room. Clint, Sam, Nat and Hulk were sprawled on the couches and Tony and Steve stood tensely nearby as Jan hovered. “Why all the long faces?”
“Can I be a superhero one day too?” Miles asked quietly.
Eve raised an eyebrow. “Fine.”
“Bring it on,” Steve replied with all of his old cockiness, raising his fists.
Miles opened his eyes wide. “Are you guys a family?”
“A little bit.”
“I could never do that to you,” Steve whispered. “I couldn’t…” He hugged Tony so tight that Tony thought he would break, but Steve held him together. Steve could always hold him together like this.
Steve groaned. “Yeah, just getting cold.”
“Just a sec. Here, put these on, Jan.”
Without rush, Steve goes to retrieve his suit, which still fits him to a T. He stands before the grave of his husband who shares his name, hand over the one button that will send him back where his body belongs. He’s smiling as he looks down at the band around his finger, because there
“Okay, Pops,” Miles replied.
“As long as I get ‘em back. Why?”
Steve elbowed him.
Thor opened the door cautiously. Miles was sitting on the floor with Peter, who was reading him a book. He was wearing a spidersuit just like Peter’s but with darker colors. He looked up to see Tony, Steve, Sam, Natasha, Clint and Thor and jumped to his feet.
him. Or slowed him down as much as he could. Reversed how he manipulates time."
Tony sat up abruptly. "Breakfast. Sam. We should--"
"That's not flirting, that's practically seducing, and you know damn well it worked."
Steve glanced up at her. “Where’s that?”
Tony’s throat tightened. Everything he did was too little, too late. “C’mere.”
Steve raised his eyebrows, looking down at Tony’s mouth and grinning. He kissed Tony briefly and rested his forehead against Tony’s.
Tony smiled. “Okay, but I see so much of you in him.”
“More coffee?”
Miles reached out to shake her hand and they all tried to cover their smiles.
“Go lie down, Tony. Now.”
“One week. One week without another alien invasion. That’s all I ask!” Clint grumbled to the Hulk, who he was perched on top of.
“Tony, because he needs all the luck he can get,” Sam replied with a smirk.
Tony wrapped his arms around Miles. “I’m so sorry, buddy,” he whispered, feeling tears threatening behind his eyelids. Steve put his hand on Miles’ shoulder.
“We can come here as often as you like, kiddo.”
Tony was at her side in a moment. "How is he?" Tony breathed.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Okay, Cap.”
Helen refused his money and Tony was almost insulted. He didn’t think she knew how badly he owed her. He donated a few million dollars to her company anonymously, but that only took the edge off.
Rhodey snorted.
Playing in the lab all day with Miles and teaching him and Steve to build things, Tony had forgotten about life going on outside the tower.
Tony turned pointedly to Steve. “—and then I gave him true love’s kiss and we lived happily ever fucking after. Steve, what the fuck?” he whispered.
Natasha sat down in a chair and leaned forward. “You guys are never going to believe this. Miles actually has a spider sense a lot like Peter Parker’s. He always knew when I was sneaking up on him. Didn’t you Miles?”
Steve grabbed Tony by the arm and dragged him to the door.
“Except it’s not just a regular week. We just saved the world, Tony.”
Helen nodded. “If the bullet had struck his abdomen, he would have died instantly. As it is, the amount of poison from the bullet wound nearly killed him. He has no pulse. I’m not surprised they pronounced him dead. But after I analyzed the poison I found that it had anti-metabolic effects. They couldn’t neutralize the serum’s effects entirely, but they could weaken it. The poison only worked because it directly attacked the serum and his immune system.”
“Anniversary? Really?” Miles asked, and Tony lifted him down so Steve could give him a hug.
“It would be cute if it wasn’t for the fact that I know you, and I know you’d rather pine over him for the rest of your life than tell him how you really feel.”
Bucky became silent. Then he said after a moment, "I still don't trust you but I guess I respect you after what you've done here. I think I owe it to Steve to be here to say that."
He wasn’t sure if he trusted them yet.
They never did tell Steve the cost that comes with war, but now he’s seen. He’s lived through it. And it’s all that experience that has brought him here. He can’t lie and say this is the best outcome, the one his optimistic self has envisioned so long ago, but he’ll take what he can get. And what he can get right now is in his arms, and Steve thinks he’s pretty damn lucky, all things considered.
He can never forget the first time he’s had his arms around Tony in two years, looking so thin, hollow,
"You’re okay, Iron Man. You’re okay." Oddly enough, that meant nothing the same way it meant everything.
The question had come to him, then, in his sleepy haze. "Have you ever considered a beard?"
was over him (they still couldn’t manage a conversation about the time he was kidnapped) and couldn’t focus on the client, and how the company stocks had suffered (naturally).
thank you for reading!! im sorry there's 0 progress on chapter 3 yet; i'd like to see where my hands take me
hello, everyone! first of all, sorry for the long delay! i've not forgotten about this fic for a second; i've just been going through over 200 pages worth of stony fics on ao3! and that's made me realise there's so many things i want to write for stony that i feel i've already steered from in this fic. as such, i've quite selfishly decided i will be taking a break from it. i'm not dropping it (don't worry!!), just need to come back one day soon to rewrite it now that i've seen all the possibilities this pairing holds for me!
The Avengers Initiative, a Level 7 classified project, was described as an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become more.
Tony had no idea where that came from. Okay,  he knew perfectly well where from, but he was not going to entertain that line of thought. They worked for the government, which meant they were a threat to him. He shot up purely on adrenaline, muttering coordinates for JARVIS. He had a safehouse, none too near nor too far, for moments like this, though he was thinking he'd been needing to hide there far too much recently.
steve visits tony in his home to stop the mandarin incident from escalating.
“J, can you analyse this,” Tony points at a green lit video, “this, and this? See if the readings match up.” The rest of the stuff are cleared as JARVIS begins working. As a loading screen appears, Tony turns to Steve, and he recognises the skeptical look.
It’s, what, 2 days away from Washington? But Steve isn’t exactly a regular guy who takes the main road. His time as an Avenger has taught him sometimes, you just gotta take the shortcut.
Chapter One updated 9/11/19! Just edited little details here and there, and added a short chunk of mentioned press conference above the tony-sees-alien scene, inspired by 616 canon!
“And what will you do?”
“FRIDAY, are you here?” He whispers. There’s no answer. Of course there isn’t. FRIDAY’s already told him she can’t be uploaded into this tiny, incomplete device. Steve was just hoping - the thing he does best. Have hope. When it becomes clear he’s alone, he gives the softest of sighs before navigating through the contents.

Steve’s going home, and isn’t it strange, how he has so many places and people he associates with that single word now? His turning point in life more than a century ago might have been due to Howard Stark, but his second life begun with one genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. One who will also be known as a loving friend, father, husband.
They go from waking at dawn to take walks together to waking at high noon to make brunch together. Their once active sex life slows to an eventual halt, where they are content with holding each other’s hands and watching the sunset together. Even then, they never forget.
So they sit in the living area, eyes glued to the screen stretching almost 2 metres long, watching The Incredibles, because they can’t deny they’re practically a family by now (also because Steve thinks he will be able to relate to Mr. Incredible, and being Tony’s boyfriend has its advantages, but no one points
“Back up there, Cap. Did you just assume I’m gonna be a part of this?” Hill gave him an unimpressed look, which Tony returned within his suit and knew she knew.
Steve thinks he manages a nod. Why is it hard to breathe? “Just- Can I have a private moment, agent?”
“It does.” Steve has a wide smile on his face now. “It means the world to me.”

“Shut up and enjoy the movie,” she threatens in a soft tone, a smile curving her lips, neither of which making her any less dangerous. “Or I’ll tell Laura to burn your Lord of the Ring figurine collection.”

!) and a hammer in his hands. Tony stared as he sat up from a dent he’d made in the alien ship with a groan, looking to be without so much as a scratch. When their eyes met, the literal glow of the man’s - alien’s - eyes had Tony readying his repulsors. He wasn’t even sure they’d work on him, but God forbid him from trying.
“On it,” Natasha answers.
It shocks him at first, how similar the layout is to Tony’s old room back the Avengers facility five years ago. Looking closely, Steve spots some differences. The kind of thing you’ll never notice unless you’re so familiar, so intimate. Photos. Softened edges that make the room children friendly. Drawings. A low, king sized bed. The room of a husband, a father.
