“-You still there? Steve? Steeeeeeve-”
God, it hurt. It hurt so fucking much. Tony felt like he was tearing out his own heart with every photograph on the wall that he laid his eyes on. All of this was his fault. Steve Rogers, Captain America: literally picked for the strength of his heart, the kindness in his soul- and Tony had managed to twist him into something unrecognisable. Something cruel.
Math classrooms were where time stopped existing. One minute lasted an hour in that stupid room.
. His fingers found Steve’s belt buckle, and he undid it hastily. “Just get those pants off, please.”
“Tell me I didn’t,” he said again, louder, hearing the twist and wrench in his voice as he shook his head repetitively with disbelief and horror, “tell me, Bruce, please…. Please, tell me—”
Peter sniffled, not wanting his Pops to start explaining what was going to happen, but knowing the talk had to come sometime anyway. “Fine,” he said gruffly, turning on his bed so that his Pops couldn’t see his face when he walked in.
, which just meant that he was ignoring Tony. Which was fine, if he wanted to be like that, then fine, Tony could give as good as he damn well got.
Tony, after an impressive 9 days in the wheelchair, had decided to fuck it and put himself onto crutches instead, and Steve hadn’t said a word about it. He hadn’t tried to argue, hadn’t attempted to convince Tony otherwise. He’d just… swallowed it all down and then asked Tony how his day had been. All arguments, quarrels, simple morning-time bickers over who had rights to the last slice of bread just vanished. Steve let him win. Every time.
“You’ve got big hands,” Tony shrugged nonchalantly and looked back out of the open window, letting the hot breeze rush across his cheeks. “I’m sure you can handle it.”
“If I get him to say Bruce’s name in the next week, will you rescind that statement and let me groom him into a little baby genius? He can be like Tony two-point-oh.”
Steve sat there and watched Tony crumble, burying his face into Rhodey’s shoulder with another distressing hitching noise. A few seconds later, Steve heard the first sounds of Tony as the boy began to cry in earnest, clinging to his best friend’s body like a lifeline. There was nothing Steve could do. No way to help, or make any of it better. Rhodey didn’t let go though; not even for a second. Just rocked them both back and forth, saying nothing, simply letting Tony cry. Rhodey glanced at Steve, and Steve saw the wetness in the other boy’s eyes too.
. What kind of person said that? He knew exactly what Steve went through, being a vampire. He’d seen it first-hand, after going on a date and then watching Steve be told to leave for none other than the fact that he had fangs and vampires weren’t allowed in the restaurant. Now Tony sounded just as bad as them.
“Very well,” JARVIS conceded in the end, and Steve thought briefly of how the otherwise perfect AI had developed the one most fatal human flaw—trust. “But please, Captain. Do not do anything rash. Causing pain won’t change things. Revenge won’t stop what happened.”
Wriggling out of Bucky’s hold, he ducked under the arm that stretched across the door and looked both ways.
Rhodey smiled. “It’s a long story involving me, Tasha and Bruce kicking major ass and then Steve blowing a lotta shit up. We’ll tell you over dinner, I promise.” Then he grabbed one of the other chairs, sliding it under the table on Tony’s other side and looking around. “Who took the plates down?”
Since then, it was almost safe to say that things had been pretty much plain-sailing from there. Comparatively, anyway.
This, he figured, was not going to be fun.
It was adorable, and Steve found himself unable to stop smiling. Yeah- coming home. Definitely the best part.
Shutting his eyes as he stepped into the elevator, Tony sighed deeply and rested his hands against the railing. The chrome surface reflected his face perfectly, and when he drew his head up and took a look at himself, he was reminded of Monaco.
Steve nodded, watching Tony dress. “Yep.”
Steve stopped, staring unashamedly up at the bigger guy. “What’s that even supposed to m-“
She was one of those people who never continued to surprise Steve. Her house was in the rougher end of Manhattan, and yet she seemed to always have a surplus supply of money to hand. And for such a small apartment, the place was very well decorated. He figured Natasha’s whole family liked to play their cards close to their chests. Maybe they were all spies. It would explain a lot, he supposed.
He didn’t have to be the genius he was in order to figure that out. Pops hadn’t come back from the mission two Fridays ago; they’d hurried him off to hospital instead. And then three days later, once he’d been given the all-clear, dad had brought him home, where they’d proceeded to have  a huge argument. Right in front of Peter.
Tony really should have noticed sooner.
No matter how hard Steve tried, suddenly the air wouldn’t come. Something blocked his throat, a hand, a vice, a noose, and he just stared at the pen blankly, wondering what the hell he was supposed to do now. How he was supposed to go forward from here. He’d just lost everything,
_____
There was a sudden blaring from his left, and he jumped about a mile in the air as he stumbled out of the way of a beat-up truck with an angry boy staring out the window at him. The books in his hands almost went flying- it was only sheer determination that kept them in his grip.
God, he made it so difficult to be sulky.
Except it wasn’t that. It wasn’t even close.
A second later, he stopped thinking completely as everything blanked out and left his mind thankfully empty of all thoughts and feelings. The next thing he recognised again when the world slowly shifted back into focus was the sound of Clint’s incessant voice drilling a painful thump into his brain, and he winced at the grating noise. He wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but if Clint had managed to find him, then it must have at least been a minute or two.
He sobbed.
The room was quiet when Tony managed to get in. Which was weird, because Steve would usually be in bed by that time in the night. He looked over to the clock- 3:15am. Definitely too late for Steve to still be awake. There was a sinking feeling in his gut as he looked up. “JARVIS, where’s Steve?”
So clearly, there was
Bruce paused for drama, because he was an asshole like that, but then he shook his head and Clint breathed a huge sigh of relief, sagging against Natasha who immediately shoved him off. “Not yours,” he confirmed, “whatever they meant in the letter, it wasn’t that.”
Her head tilted, mulling over the words. But she didn’t back out. Instead, she just undid her seatbelt and stretched, catlike, in her seat. “Good enough for me. Let’s go commit some crimes.”
“What’s that- third time this month?” Natasha asked.
Steve’s chest heaved with quiet laughter, and his hand tightened around Tony’s fondly. “Sexting via carrier-pigeon. How very World-War-Two of you.”
did he want.
Tony blinked, before just nodding, still rather dazed as he looked at Steve. “Uh huh. Yeah.” He jumped a little, and then raised a quick finger and turned away, stumbling back over to where they’d been a second ago. Steve watched in amusement as he hastily yanked on a pair of oven mitts and then pulled out their cookies, throwing the tray uncaringly on the side and then turning back to Steve immediately. “Okay, so now the house won’t burn down too.”
“Hey,” Tony said, voice going quieter as his left hand batted Steve’s fingers away from where they were fiddling with his bangs, “ I think it’s cute,” he admitted with a little shrug, like he knew exactly what Steve was thinking. His hand lingered an inch from Steve’s face, before it brushed tentatively across, sweeping the mess of hair from out of his eyes.
Steve paused his journey across Tony’s body, looking up at him briefly. His eyes were half-shut with sleepiness, his hair messy and tangled. He was adorable, and he knew it. Which is why he leaned up and then caught Tony’s mouth in a soft kiss, nipping gently at his pout and grinning like he knew
Tony’s voice cut out and Steve felt his stomach drop as he watched the robot swing its leg out in a manoeuvre no human would have been capable of, clipping Iron Man’s thigh and sending him cartwheeling across the sky. He managed to regain his balance about ten feet off the surface of the sea, but from the way Tony was cussing down the comm, it had been a painful hit. Steve clenched his fingers around the two joysticks JARVIS had directed him to, looking at the robot thing down below him.
“It’s very innocent-looking hair,” Tony shrugged again, looking around the corner absently, “anyway- you wanna go in first, or shall I?”
He blinked once, twice, three times. Steve wasn’t back home yet, so he would still be wearing his suit. There was no way he’d not be wearing his suit unless it had been forcibly taken off him.
With a grunt followed quickly by a straight-up moan of pain, he was eased gently onto the dusty cot tucked into the side of the cabin by Natasha and Rhodey, Bruce hovering over him anxiously and waiting until he was steady before instantly getting to his haunches and zeroing in on the deep red section of what had once been Tony’s pristine white ski-pants. He mourned the loss of them for a moment, because that would
“Uh,” his mouth came out with, looking down at his hands curiously. The sketch of Tony grinned back up at him; hands mid-motion and hair scraped back from the memory of fingers that had flattened it down seconds previously.
He was right; Steve turned to look over his shoulder and saw how the sun was just about touching the ocean- deep red and beautiful and bathing the huge grounds of the house in a deep orange light. It occurred to him in that moment that he and Tony were sat on the roof of some building in a place Steve didn’t know, with very little preventing him from just overbalancing and rolling right off the damn roof completely- Hell, the only way to get up here in the first place had been to dangle off the second story balcony and then climb the rest of the way up. Tony was mad, making him do this. Steve was madder for following.
The bell rang for last period and he was one of the first to slip out, going as inconspicuously as he could to avoid potential conversation. He wasn’t really sure why. Perhaps some sort of self-sabotaging thing, because really, more than anything he just wished he had someone to talk to right now. Someone to see him and just… care.
He clamped his eyes shut and curled his hands around the cool rim of his arc reactor. He was not there. He was here. He was not in Afghanistan. He was in New York. He was not dying. He was okay.
“This is very… steampunk,” he said, turning along with the curve of the stairs until coming to the bottom, “I’m digging it-oh, wow.”
Steve shut his eyes and leaned forward, sagging into Tony’s embrace. The boy held him up easily, kissing softly along his hairline in a comforting gesture of contact the calmed Steve further with every touch. After a minute or two, Tony gently manoeuvred Steve on his lap and lay them both back down again, Steve’s back pressed up against Tony’s bare chest. Tony kissed the underside of his clenched jaw and wrapped his hands around the skinny expanse of Steve’ waist, shrouded by a baggy shirt. Steve, curled tightly into Tony, their arms both hanging off the side of the couch, just let out a small sigh of comfort.
“You are so, so stupid,” he said, voice cracked and wet, and Tony didn’t want to look up. He was terrified, because he knew what was coming. He’d failed. And in the process of his failure, he’d managed to wreck a dozen floors of the tower and send the team into a panic. If that hadn’t secured his dismissal from the team, he wasn’t sure what would.
Steve blushed and rolled his eyes when Tony just winked at her. “Why thank you,” he said primly, “glute workouts
“Not in my head there wasn’t,” Tony said bitterly, “I wasn’t thinking about any of that. I was thinking about him, hitting me for no other fucking reason than because he thought I deserved it, and you not believing me if I told you. That was… that wasn’t something I wanted to have to cope with, and so I just. Didn’t.”
Steve smiled. “Yeah,” he lied easily, naturally, “I’m fine. Don’t worry.”
Well. He was about to find out.
Then Tony swore and leaped out of bed, and Steve landed back in reality with a blink of his eyes. He breathed in. They were in Tony’s room. Obviously. Although that still didn’t really account for the shrill whine of the alarm that signalled something or another, most likely something bad.
Tony eyed him for a second. Steve felt the moment weighing heavy. This was it.
Tony kissed his chest and then brushed his fingers across the mark absently, smiling up at him with a look of softness etched over his face. “If it helps,” he said quietly as he took Steve’s hand and locked their fingers together with a gentle caress of his fingers, “I’m thinking sappy things too.”
Steve made a humming noise. “That doesn’t sound sensible,” he said.
A time machine, Scott had said. A real life, genuine time machine. Not perfect, of course, and if they were going to do anything with it, he was pretty sure Tony would be vital to that, but still… time travel. The geek inside him couldn’t quite believe that. He’d spent so much time wondering about whether it was possible, about whether there was a way for him to go back to the forties where he’d thought he’d belonged… but now it was in front of him, Steve didn’t even entertain the thought. There was nothing left for him back there now. But here, he had everything.
have work, and so eventually they both had to refrain from copping feels in the bathroom and actually get dressed, which sucked. Steve only had a couple of meetings to attend in the evening, however, and although he’d been going to spend the day at SHIELD monitoring some of the recruits and giving them what everyone (Clint & Nat) now liked to call his famous ‘Captain’s Speech’, he also wanted to spend some time in Tony’s workshop, looking at what the man was currently building. His work was honestly fascinating to Steve, he didn’t think he’d ever get enough of it- and seeing Tony in his element like that wasn’t too bad either.
Steve froze, and then blinked incredulously. “What?” He asked, “No, that's not true. I’ve always wanted… I just—”
Across the living room and sat curled up on the loveseat, Natasha smiled at him. Unlike Steve, her injuries from the LMD attack a few days ago hadn't quite healed, and there was still a slight purple flourishing across her left cheek, while her foot was bound and cast on the floor. Despite that, though, she seemed relaxed. Natasha was not a woman to stew on her injuries. “Good rest?” She asked quietly, “We figured you probably needed it, what with all the baby-related wakeup calls you’ve been having these past few days.”
Her eyes hardened immediately, moving over him once before coming to the immediate conclusion. “Steve?” She asked, and Tony nodded, that feeling under his sternum flaring up again when she said his name.
Steve felt warmth bloom under his sternum and he wrapped himself around Tony, squeezing them both together and sighing happily. In another world, he could just stay here with Tony forever. It was perfect out here, truly perfect. No responsibilities or worries, no aches and injuries, just peace. Miles of field around them, with evening board games and inevitable shouting matches that resulted from it.
Maybe it was even enough.
The last thing was Tony.
Clint’s head turned. “What?” He looked warily at the group of faces staring him down. “Have I fucked up?”
“It’s not enough any more though, is it,” Peter whispered, shutting his eyes and hugging the pillow a little tighter.
Of course Steve didn’t mean it like that. God, he’d only been awake thirty seconds and he was already fucking everything up. “I think the God-damn world of you,” he answered throatily, head shaking back and forth, “you risk your life out there, doing the right thing even when you have the whole world not believing in you. You didn’t even hesitate to let me back into your life when I needed your help, even after the way I treated you before we split—”
He was floating through darkness as he hit the floor, and the last thing he saw was Loki’s version of him leap down the stairwell with the sceptre in hand.
“Do you want to come to my birthday party?” Steve asked. Well- blurted, really- it wasn’t the most graceful of propositions.
. Not anyone else on the team. Us.”
He flinched away from her. In his chest, his heart was beating frantically again, but he clenched his eyes shut and tried to rationalise it. He dealt with nightmares all the time. He was strong enough to fight them. They didn’t control him and he knew they weren’t real, not really. This wasn’t going to affect him the way it would a normal fella. Steve Rogers was used to fighting off his own demons.
Steve traced absent-minded patterns against Tony’s bare arm as they let the time slip by them once more. He really loved the colors that made up Tony- the warm hues of his skin and the sharp intensity of his eyes. He would be a beautiful subject to draw. No way Steve would be able to do him justice, but… he might try. Someday.
“Life happened,” Steve laughed again before shrugging, looking off to the side. “Cancer. She worked so hard- all her life, working so hard for everyone but herself. Sometimes I think that’s what killed her- not the fucking tumor, just the weight of the world on her shoulders. She never said anything though. Never complained. She was always so… happy.”
. What a stupid fucking idiot.
Yeah. It didn’t help with anyone’s concentration.
“I don’t know what came over me,” Steve said, his eyes guilty as he settled a hand delicately on Tony’s neck, “but I’m sorry. It was out of line.”
Tony watched him go, before turning back to Steve and running gentle fingers through his hair in greeting. “Hey, babe. You doing okay?”
Steve blinked in confusion, the words catching like a jarring cog in his mind. “You’re gonna destroy them?” He asked. That didn’t make sense. Iron Man was supposed to be stealing all his weapons to amass an army. “Why?”
The wheelchair he was in was fucking irritating and meant he was restricted to only really working with small bits of machinery and little projects, but the Doctors had said he’d be able to move to crutches soon, which would make everything a lot easier. He had a few projects that he could work on despite that though, so he quickly delved into them, trying to keep his mind focused.
And nothing was more Tony than the man’s workshop.
He was with Tony. Tony was safe.
“What makes you think that?” He blurted suddenly, and it was weird, he barely even knew her- but she seemed friendly and she was smiling at him and he found himself just needing to know. “What is it that’s so damn obvious to everyone else but me? I had Jane tell me that earlier today too, and I want to know what the fuck you’re all seeing that I’m not.”
Another quake; this one even more powerful than the other, rumbled at their feet, and once more sent all three of them flying around the corridor. This time it was Bucky who grabbed hold of Tony- and in any other circumstance, Tony probably would have had something to say about all this coddling- but for the time being, he was simply glad Bucky had saved him from braining himself against the floor.
Tony was looking at him fondly as he slowly backed off down the street, and Steve had half a mind to tell him to face the way he was walking so he wouldn’t slip—but if he did that, then he wouldn’t be able to see Tony’s face. He decided against it, instead just smiling dumbly at Tony as the man walked further and further away. You’d think after two years they’d have settled down a bit, stopped acting like lovesick teenagers in public. But apparently not. It drove Bucky mad, honestly; he always asked how they kept it up. Steve didn’t really know what else there was to explain other than that he just really, really loved Tony, and Tony really, really loved him. It was that simple.
“You say that like you have a clue,” Steve said wryly, “although touched as I am by the confidence boost, I’m probably just going to have to wait and see for mys-”
The boy in question was staring back, not even attempting to seem nonchalant by that point. His face was hard. “You know what, Steve?” He began, stepping forward. The hallway went quieter still, and Steve saw people stop walking to look at them both.
“You’ve got navigation on your phone, Steve, right?” James asked him, raising his eyebrows upward and tilting his head back to look at Steve, “I’m sure he’ll be fine, guys.”
Clint’s face was tight, and he hunched in himself a little as he nodded. “Yeah, guess you’re right,” he said gruffly, “shall we call ‘em, then?”
“There aren’t any other Tony’s I know, Buck.”
“I have him, he’s safe, and I will drop him off in twenty fucking minutes. They are all the Goddamn words you need, thanks.”
“Now,” Steve thought about turning on the light as he passed it, but it would probably only hurt Tony’s eyes, so he left the room in darkness, “what happened tonight that upset you? Is it- is it something that needs to involve the cops or something?”
Steve laughed, lips brushing softly over Tony’s hair. “It’s 11. I’ve been lying in for 3 hours, now.”
That couldn’t happen again. Tony… Tony needed to remain useful. He’d learned how to speak fluently in Japanese by the next week after that debacle, so he could do this.
He didn’t wait to watch the mug shatter against the wall before he turned back to Steve, face twisted in fury. “Shout at me,” he said, voice raising to a yell as he commanded, “tell me everything you think of me, call me a name, grab my shoulders and kiss me and tell me everything’s going to be alright, just fucking
“Well I’ve been in for two. Ergo,
Steve shook his head. “They took it,” he muttered.
“I can’t just sit here!”
“Honey, I’m home!” Tony sung, flinging open the doors and searching for Steve, dropping his briefcases and beaming.
Tony paused, looking at where Steve was. “Uh- I bought them. They’re not mine.”
“I’ll drink to that,” Tony laughed, and Steve figured when they left each other’s company, Tony probably would.
Steve? Tony didn't think he'd
is wrong with you! Steve, if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t even fucking be here! And not just because you saved me from fuck only knows how many shots and explosions and aliens, because you saved me from my
Steve frowned. “The usual crowd? Sam and Clint and Natasha, obviously. Buck and Peggy. Thor. Jane and Bruce, too, because I was feeling generous. Why do you ask?”
But, hell, he wasn’t going to reject a Christmas fucking miracle when one came along. He grinned to himself and leaned even further sideways to kiss Steve’s cheek, because that was allowed now, and maybe he was a little doped up on painkillers and it was making him more impulsive, but whatever. Steve’s cheek was
Steve doesn't want a girlfriend, Natasha.
There was an ominous growling sound that came from below Steve’s feet, and he hurried to steady himself as the entire ship shuddered.
Steve nodded in understanding, looking back at the toy now sat on Rocket’s table. It was ugly, and the raccoon clearly hated it. But he kept it close.
"Aren't you guys supposed to be like, my friends or something?" Clint muttered, picking at his sandwich whilst his free hand absently crafted some sort of catapult, "I'm sure that was in the contract I signed."
“Sure,” Steve shrugged indifferently, poking at his own bowl of granola, “Carol seems nice. And I’m sure her guy is too.”
“Ughnf, wait, is the new guy here?” Steve jumped a little as suddenly he watched another boy jerk upright from the opposite bench where it seemed he’d previously been having a nap on. His hair was plastered to his face, and a bandage ran across the bridge of his nose. “Steve, right?”
Steve had to swallow again, but this one went a little wrong, and he only ended up choking on air.
Bucky looked grim. “Steve- why the fuck were you going out drinking with Tony Stark? Did he pressure you? What-“
“Steve? Steve, hey, sweetpea. Hey. Look at me.”
“Why do you think, smartass?”
Tony might see his face and be terrified.
He sighed, leaning back on his desk chair and swivelling around a little so that he was facing DUM-E. The bot chirped at him as he leaned forward to run a finger along his claw. “Any ideas?” He murmured quietly.
For most of the talk, he liked to think he did pretty well. The kids laughed and interacted as Tony instilled those basic life values that they already knew but Tony had been told were mandatory to repeat. They were a good group, and all of them sharp-minded. That was one of the things Tony really loved about children: their potential. It was somewhat reassuring to listen to the people who would save the world one day, and hear them talk about how they all made a class-effort to try and save a bee that had gotten trapped in the classroom.
His boots echoed on the hard floors of the compound that he walked through with the rest of the squad from the jet. They’d transferred Tony into the building’s holding cells a few minutes before everyone else on the jet dispatched, and now Steve was supposedly headed for Fury’s office to debrief. There, the Director would undoubtedly ask him a myriad of invasive and personal questions, to which Steve would answer dutifully and truly, and then later be dismissed, possibly with a promotion under his belt for his excellent work on the Iron Man case. Then he would go home to his messy apartment, alone, and fall asleep, alone, and then wake up, alone. Because that was what he did. That was always what he did.
“He wasn’t moving when they dragged me away, let’s just say that.”
Peter frowned. That sounded nice. He hadn’t thought they were still going to be nice to each other, after all this. It was odd.
It took them a good minute until they managed to persuade Peter to unstick himself from Steve’s arm using a shiny object and one of Tony’s most winning smiles. Once that had been achieved, they placed him safely back on the ground and stared at him, while Peter simply munched happily on his own hand and garbled a few more incomprehensible noises at them. Steve shuffled a few more paces back, as if afraid the small child may latch on again.
Oh God, had Tony told
He wanted to know why Tony had said it.
Fucking… great.
LMD’s were good, but from what Tony knew about them, they were also controlled by an external source, which meant they were being transmitted instructions from somewhere. If Tony could find the right frequency to disrupt the connection, he could fuck with the instructions going through to the LMD’s system and, hopefully, shut the thing down.
how angry it makes me that you could fucking believe that bullshit, even for a single second? Are you out of your
Steve immediately lost interest in the conversation, instead turning on his heel and pretty much throwing himself out the door, uncaring of his friends’ laughter.
He sat down on the edge of the bathtub, watching Tony lazily as the man leaned down into the sink and spat, cleaning his toothbrush under the running water before stuffing it back onto the shelf and pulling out the rest of his grooming kit. He had a whole routine, did Tony, and he kept to it religiously. Steve loved watching him do it, although he wasn’t entirely sure why. There was simply something strangely hypnotic about the way Tony took care of himself; how he gently plucked any stray hairs from his eyebrows, applied his expensive creams around his face and occasionally, if going out in public or over to important conferences, would swipe powder over his forehead and cheeks or concealer under his eyes. Seeing as this was an easy day for the two of them, however, there was none of that. Merely the basics- his toner and moisturizer, and a few little plucks of stray eyebrow hair that had grown back in.
“Not like this it isn’t!” Tony argued, hearing as Peter began to whine a little bit in his arms as he reacted to their tense voices. He looked down and then made an effort to relax, keeping his voice calm. “Steve, they don’t know how to handle this. You’ve heard the horror stories about vulnerable kids getting paired off with abusive parents who can’t handle the fact their kids aren’t ‘normal’. We… there’s gotta be another way.”
“You bastards ruined my blanket fort!” Tony screamed from the other end of the room where he and Bruce had rolled. Steve had to agree with Tony on that one: their hard hour’s work was currently lying in a broken heap all around the room, with various limbs owned by various people sticking out underneath it all. Tony looked a second away from restarting his wrestling match with Bruce in retaliation for his destruction of Tony’s precious fort, so Steve quickly intervened by sitting on him. Which seemed to do the job, because Tony settled himself to simply glaring mutinously across the room whilst his fingers wound themselves around Steve’s waist.
“Stop it,” he said immediately, before Thor could say anything.
“Meet me after school, yeah?” Tony asked, tucking the chair back in, “I’ll take you out, show you a good time- might need to stop off at my place just for a bit first, though- gotta check my Work-In-Progress Bot hasn’t blown any of his wiring yet, we’re still in the very early stages of development, you know how it is.”
“I should go,” he whispered, unwilling to bring his voice above that tone. Scared to.
“Don’t you dare, Tony,” Steve hissed, lurching forward and curling his hand around Tony’s wrist, turning him back around, “don’t you
A… a really bad mission. Something-Wears-Coulson’s-Face-And-Goes-On-A-Murderous-Rampage-Directed-At-Clint type of bad mission.
“Uh-“ Tony blinked, opening and shutting his mouth, “well, I didn’t really… I was sort of preoccupied, Steve-“
Darkness was almost immediate. The last thing he noticed before unconsciousness swept over him was that the near-perpetual screams he’d been hearing since Tony’s fall had suddenly stopped.
offended now. Steve waved a hand through the air sharply, silencing any other interrogations either of the two could give out.
He can’t talk romance. But he can do science.
“That was easier than I thought,” Bulletproof guy said after a moment, stepping back and looking across at the Avengers through the blueish energy field. “Aren’t you guys supposed to be responsible for like, saving the universe and stuff?”
“JARVIS,” he commanded as he shut his eyes and stepped into the suit, “put me fifteen feet in the air.”
Tony just sighed, and looked genuinely remorseful as he said, “yeah, really sorry about that. I was a prepubescent teen with no idea what to do with the sudden influx of gay thoughts I’d have whenever you entered a room. So I pulled on your pigtails in order to get your attention.” Tony pulled a face, before smiling, “but I’m cooler now! Comfortable with my sexuality, at least thirty percent more stable and also, still kind of crazy about you.”
JARVIS was just as real as any one of them.
A knock on the door interrupted him from his thought, and Tony turned just as Steve poked his head around the corner. His brow creased a little when he took in Tony’s posture, braced against the sink and holding a comb in his hand but making no move to actually use it. “Are you okay?” He asked at once, stepping in slowly, “you left pretty hastily back there.”
Paul blinked, before nodding awkwardly. “This doesn’t make what happened today any easier for us, Steve,” he said, although his voice was a fraction more gentle, “you’re still facing a potential assault charge here. And you’re suspended. That’s gonna go on your report, so no doubt your social worker’s gonna be coming by to do another evaluation—”
So. That was one new enemy, it seemed.
Steve needed this. And Clint was right- there was pretty much nothing on this earth that Tony wouldn’t do for Steve.
“No you won’t,” the girl said angrily, before jumping off the counter with a huff. She shot daggers at Steve as she stormed out past him, and he just stared right back at her, completely bewildered.
“Yep- and don’t worry, I promise she won’t break down this time,” Tony told him as Steve shut the door behind them and then turned out into the street.
It was the wrong thing to say. Tony knew that as soon as it came out of his mouth, and he blinked, tried to mentally take them back out of the room, but it was no use. Steve was staring at him like he’d just punched him in the face. The room was oppressively silent for a moment as they looked at one another, Tony with horror, Steve with betrayal.
He noticed then, that Tony wasn’t actually wearing a helmet. Must only have been carrying one around with him. Steve was about to say something, but then Tony revved the engine and kicked off the brake, shrugging as he did so.
you sack of shit, if you’ve hurt him to get information, if you’ve touched a hair on his head, I’m gonna
And he was going to die before he ever opened his mouth.
Steve rolled his eyes tiredly and followed Tony as the man stepped out of the elevator and started prancing through the corridor, eyes already lighting up at the prospect of getting back to whatever project he had been working on before JARVIS had interrupted with the alert about Steve. The doors slid open easily for the both of them, and Tony turned to Steve questioningly as he reached the desk. “What are your thoughts on some Black Sabbath?” He asked.
Steve remembered everything he’d heard about the name Tiberius- what Thor said, what Steve had seen for himself. He felt as his dislike for the guy racked up a few more notches. “Why the hell does Tony even hang out with him if he’s such an asswipe?”
He flicked through his phone absently for the next few minutes, just waiting for the bus to arrive at his stop and drop him off at the end of his street. Some point a few minutes in, he heard his phone ringing again and checked the number, frowning at the unknown caller ID. He picked it up anyway, getting ready to reject whatever fridge or insurance they were trying to sell him. “Hello?”
He’d come close to death many times in his life. Sometimes it happened too fast to scare him, but other times, when there was waiting involved, he would always feel fear. He would always wonder what he was heading into— another life, another chance, or just the dark void of nothingness. Now, though, it didn’t cross his mind. He had minutes left to live. It didn’t matter. He was only alive in body. Every other part of him had died on that sidewalk with Tony 16 hours ago.
He went back to bed.
in his head, that was what made him feel so sick. He hadn’t thought about fighting it. Hadn’t been a mindless puppet, oblivious to what he’d done. He hadn’t been trapped inside his own mind, the rational part of him looking out as his hands moved against his own will either. He’d known. He
“I’ll need two minutes, max!” Tony called, before yanking open the door and quickly dealing with the pilot sat in his spot.
, but he was still kind of dreading it anyway.
“Hey, whoah, I can totally still make traps!” Tony tried to sit up again, but he moved too fast and suddenly everything was spinning, pain erupting in his leg and forcing a gasp from his throat. He felt himself tumble sideways, body threating to spill right off the cot, but a pair of sturdy hands caught him and Rhodey held tight as he gently lay Tony back down.
And then came round three.
“Shut up, Steve,” Tony snapped suddenly, and Steve jumped a little, eyebrows rising.
are you d-“
“Why’d you come get me,” Tony asked as he slipped into the inconspicuous black car Steve had driven up in.
“Sorry,” he muttered, putting back the little gizmo that he’d knocked off the side, and then looked at it in confusion when he discovered it wasn’t actually a gizmo, but a weird troll-doll thing. He made a face. “What the hell is this?”
He spent the rest of the journey up to the communal floor arguing with JARVIS over the nutritional values of said hot-pockets, eventually appeasing the AI when he begrudgingly agreed to eat a piece of real fruit alongside his late-afternoon snack. Tony admitted that the guy might have a point. Tomorrow was training exercise day, which meant he should probably carb-load or something, in order to make sure he didn’t suffer cardiac arrest when Steve decided to make him run a marathon in the armour or whatever it was that sadist had planned.
Steve wanted to scream, but he was too exhausted. There was a hopelessness in the pit of his stomach- aware that Tony was going to do this, whether he wanted it or not- and when he did, it would be for good. Steve would never again see his face, touch his skin, feel his unwavering presence by his side.
Steve frowned. “Can you maybe let me flirt on my own, guys?”
Tony nodded thoughtfully. “Yeah, thought so,” he muttered. “JARVIS, turn on the water for me. Make sure it’s not too hot.”
“Well, I beg to differ.”
Steve sniffed, shutting his eyes and shaking his head. “I… God, you wouldn’t believe me even if I told you.”
He felt Peggy begin to smile. “So the Steve Rogers-Bucky Barnes friendship has not been irreparably fragmented, then?” She asked hopefully, and Steve just rolled his eyes, jostling their shoulders.
His desktop whirred to life, and he looked at it blankly for a second as a billion thoughts exploded in his mind. Then he pressed his fingers lightly over the keyboard and tapped a few buttons, opening up the source code editor in his taskbar. It was his own design, and he’d been playing with computer programs since before he could talk, so he knew what he had planned shouldn’t take too long. It would have probably been sped up a little bit if he’d stopped checking his phone for any sign of a response every two minutes, but you couldn’t have everything.
He palmed a hand over his face. “JARVIS?”
On the third day in, when Tony was busy at the kitchen counter preparing dinner for the two of them, he decided to just go ahead and ask. “You’re pretty touchy-feely these days,” he began casually, sliding up behind Tony’s back and observing what was cooking away in the pan. “Is there any particular reason, or are you just a little bit more overcome with love and desire for me than usual?”
“Because my boyfriend is in a place so shitty that we can’t even sext, you goddamn heartless bitch!” Natasha’s muffled voice called out from inside the fort.
Another chuckle. “Show it every few years on some program no-one watches or cares about. They all thought it was some big corporate conspiracy, it was big news for months. I feature in the damn thing a handful of times too. Never gave an interview though.”
“You could say that. But I’m fine. I’m managing. Probably gonna call it a night soon though, I’m fucking exhausted and Steve’ll yell if I stay up too late.” He huffed and consciously relaxed his hands, but when he looked up at Natasha her face was just more strained. Like the mention of Steve alone was causing her discomfort. Tony resisted the urge to glare. “You good, Romanov?”
Steve couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. He just watched Tony’s face falling, his brow softening in disbelief. He glared at Rumlow. “You’re lying.”
It felt like a dream.
They retreated into the living room, Bucky flicking on the TV and pulling up Brooklyn Nine-Nine whilst Steve iced the swelling with his bag of peas, but the background noise did little to soothe his anxieties, and his fingers spent the entire period just tapping nervously against the couch, no matter how many times Bucky told him to cut it out and try to relax.
He let the break pass him by, eyes mostly shut against the table and hand laid out flat for Tony to mess with as he talked to the others. He heard Thor join them at some point, but aside from a hefty pat on the shoulder, he just left Steve to it.
“Buce!” Peter seemed to be having an absolute ball, with his new words, mouth split into a beam as he bashed his hands into Steve’s chest. “Buce, Seev, Seev, Seev!”
Steve laughed, and this time it was a lick of the lips, which was honestly just unfair at this time of day. “Uhhh-”
The hands on his arms wouldn’t budge, no matter how hard he struggled, and they yanked him roughly away. He could see that teachers were swarming the area now, some of them going to Bruce, who was still fighting the boy that had tried to hit Steve. There were others, too—Steve noticed absently that Sam’s nose was bloody, and Natasha and Clint were arguing furiously with a wall of teachers as they tried to reach some of Stone’s other friends, who must have come in for backup at some point.
Tony barely managed to grab hold of the fabric of Steve’s shirt before he was sprinting back across the room, heading right for Clint, face absolutely
But Steve had made his choice, and Tony knew the man. He was stubborn, and when he thought something was right, there was no changing his mind.
good blowjob that night, he’d start thinking maybe the day wasn’t so bad after all. Win win.
“Can we please focus up on the task ahead of us, gentlemen?” Natasha asked tiredly, “we still need to find where the main laboratory is.”
voluntarily went to science club?
Steve blushed, looking away with a shrug. “You’re really good at this,” he said quietly, whilst his finger traced around the rim of his cup.
It was for the best.
One that was made infinitely worse by the knowledge that his best friend had been the one to kill Tony’s parents.
“I’m sorry I was pushy,” Tony managed to get out in the end, once he was sure he wouldn’t do something terrible like burst into tears with relief. “It was selfish of me and I should have gotten the message.”
“But Sir—”
At that, Steve just huffed disbelievingly. “Yeah, sounds likely.”
The door on the other side of the room suddenly burst open before his train of thought could finish, and Tony jerked in surprise as he watched Thor- clad in the most grotesque festive jumper Tony had ever seen, and reindeer ears atop his head- stride into the room with a smile the size of his face. He was also carrying a huge turkey on a tray. “MERRY CHRISTMAS!”
“that’s a lifelong dream?” Sam said, and when Thor nodded, he just shrugged. “I- fair enough. You do you, man, I guess.”
He came to the conclusion that Tony would be better off not knowing what Steve now knew. It’d save them an argument, for one thing. And it’d save Steve having to refuse to promise Tony not to do that again, if the situation ever occurred.
Tony was crazy. That was the only explanation. Blowing hot one moment and cold the next- Steve just couldn't fucking work him out.
“I should be doing a lot of things,” he said, before throwing the new Widow’s Bite over to her. She caught it on reflex and glanced down. “New and improved model. Thank me later.”
“Anyway,” Darcy leaned back and cocked her head over to him curiously, “what’cha doing this weekend? A date that’s not officially a date but is still totally a date?”
“Or what?”
Probably.
the pathetic little voice at the back of his mind said, quiet and scared,
“No. I’m sleepy.”
“Ha ha,” Steve slumped forward and let his forehead rest on the desk again, sighing loudly, “you know just how to charm a boy, don’t you?”
As his feet dragged across the shiny floors, he noticed someone sat on the bench a few yards ahead of him. He had his head bent low, elbows resting on his open knees, and even from the distance, he seemed exhausted, simply in the way he was holding himself. The slump of his spine. The way his palms were pressed into the sockets of his eyes.
be good-- you have to look deep down inside you, and find the real answer to that. Is it a problem that you can talk about, and one that can be fixed? Or is it... more. You can forgive and forget, but there has to be a breaking point. A limit where you say ‘no, that’s wrong’.”
“I’m not trying to-“ Bucky began, before growling in frustration and clenching his jaw. “I just… fucked up. I know I did. But I was just… I wanted-“
. And he knew The Hulk would take care of him if something did go wrong.
Steve blinked in confusion, watching the two guys nod nervously and then scurry off down the hall, muttering to one another and glancing back as they did so. Which just left Steve and Tony with his stupid jangly zips.
JARVIS, SHUT UP!” Tony shouted, so loud and so angry that Steve and Thor both instinctively leaned back. The AI went quiet, the small orange circle laying still on the screen. Tony’s lip wobbled and his breath hitched again, so close to the edge.
“I want to,” Tony cut him off and then sighed, rubbing his hands over his face. He shuffled on his chair and then hoisted his feet onto Steve’s seat, leaning forward and curling his hands around his knees. “I know it’s… listen, things with Ty are complicated and just- it’s hard to navigate that. The last thing I’d want to happen was for you to get hurt over this, okay, and I-“
“That would be… nice,” Steve admitted softly, “but Tony- it’s really late, and you have work, and I don’t want to inconvenience you-”
Steve couldn’t help but laugh, even though it really hurt. “Yeah, really,” he said, “I guess I was kind of exaggerating how terribly evil you were in order to save myself from uh- going too far the other way.”
“Pepper might disembowel me, but sure.” He shook his head and then laughed once more, dipping forward and kissing Steve again, his face freezing against Steve’s. They’d been walking through the city for nearly an hour, window shopping for gifts they were going to buy for Christmas, but now Tony was due for a business trip and Steve had to go back to the tower alone. Excursions abroad for StarkIndustries business weren’t that uncommon, although it had lessened over the last year or so as Tony stepped back further and further from the CEO elements and become more invested in R&D. Steve definitely preferred that. Not only did it make Tony happier, but it meant that he didn’t have to be on the other side of the world for extended periods of time.
“I don’t know,” she said quietly, “are you?”
“Yeah, probably for the best,” Tony smiled at him and rolled his eyes, before turning back to Steve and clicking his fingers, “oh! That reminds me- on a completely unrelated and irrelevant note, how willing would you be to part with your phone for 24 hours or so? Just out of curiosity.”
Steve felt himself drift back off into a peaceful doze, his head buried into the warmth of Tony’s bare chest as he caught up on the hours he’d lost that morning. His mind wandered absently and without rush- ideas for new art pieces he was thinking of, a present that he could buy for Bruce that he’d seen out on the highstreet earlier, how he was going to make Mrs. Kaplinsky believe he’d really lost his history book for the third time in the semester, and all the while Tony breathed peacefully beside him, his fingers curled loosely around Steve’s waist and holding him close. He was so much more… innocent, when he was asleep. Smaller and almost vulnerable, curled into Steve’s warmth like a child, his face relaxed and open and hair messy in the way that wasn’t fashionable, just ridiculous. Steve tilted his head and watched him breathe for a moment, tracing the lines and creases of his face, both present currently and ones that only came to be when Tony was awake, like the frowny ones over his eyebrows and the part of his cheek that dimpled when he smiled.
But Steve shook his head rapidly. "No, no, we can't do that. You wriggle in your sleep, and I'm heavy. We could accidentally... squish it."
Steve chuckled beside him. What with him being a literal giant, his position was even more uncomfortable than Tony’s- not that he seemed to care. “It depends what we’re going for. You can play the long game, try and win but risk facing boredom. Or you can live fast and lose quick by constantly moving hiding spots. More thrilling, but riskier.”
“I mean that, you know,” Steve said, and Tony realised he may just have been quiet for a moment too long, because Steve’s face had turned serious, “you’d be fantastic. Just seeing you with Peter proves that much.”
“Excuse me?” He asked, “who are you?”
Stark said, already thinking ahead, up to the next crisis. Steve had to admire him for that. It must be completely fucking exhausting, always preparing for another catastrophe. He wasn’t even sure if Tony could help it. It was just who he was. A futurist.
"It's not my fault you can't land a date for shit."
Steve was still asleep when he came back into their room, lying motionless and peaceful, half his body still strewn across Tony’s side of the bed. Tony smiled at him for a moment, but it melted away back into a frown as soon as his mind properly got ahold of the thought. Steve was lying motionless. Because he was asleep. Clearly.

Steve wrinkled his nose, wandering back over to Tony’s side and then leaning over to the third draw down on the left, pulling up open and delving inside to retrieve his sketchbook. “How about Tchaikovsky?” He said, and then huffed when Tony blanched.
“Then take the one I’m usin’.”
The last period of Friday finally rolled around, and with it came Steve’s usual post-week exhaustion. School had always been difficult on him and his body- he needed the weekend’s rest more than he needed air, some months- and this one had seemed as if it had taken double the time to come for some reason, which had been fun. The past five days hadn’t been the best on record, either. Sleep refused to come easy, and everything felt far too disorganised in his head- the weight inside him feeling more prominent than ever.
Steve felt the rage curl in his gut and he snarled in fury, stepping forward with his fist raised. Something pulled him back, though- a sharp tug at his jacket that sent him stumbling backward, straight into Tony’s arms. He pushed out angrily, wanting to just teach that piece of shit a fucking lesson, but Tony held firm, his arm not moving from around Steve’s midsection.
want to be in a relationship with her, and believe me, you don't want me setting my mind on that. It's already being considered, you know."
“How many times have you done it already?”
“The Wilsons are out,” Steve told him, opening the door quickly and then pushing Tony in, “we’re all good.”
Across the room and through the pane of thick glass, Bruce nodded and pushed his glasses up his nose. “Uh, yeah,” he said with a shrug, “from what we can tell, he’s basically just. Uh. Imprinted, I think? That, mixed with this primal protective urge and the, uh, the growling. We’re pretty sure that it’s some sort of chemically induced… animalistic behaviour.”
"Wait!" He said, "nope, it's not mine. Nine months ago was in June, right? I was casually seeing another man back then, not a woman. Michael was great, but most certainly did not have the ability to get pregnant. I'm safe."
Steve was talking about a lady called Miss Holloway, who’d sold pretzels to him during his first few weeks back out of the ice. Tony wasn’t sure how they’d gotten here, but he listened anyway, thumb brushing back and forth across Steve’s bicep as the other man spoke.
“When you say ‘you’ will make it, do you actually mean ‘google’ will make it and you will still end up getting it wrong anyway?” Steve responded, following him through into the kitchen with a tired smile on his face. Tony’s hoodie was warm from his body heat and smelled like Tony did, and it felt so nice that Steve couldn’t even complain about being coddled.
Fifteen minutes later, the car turned into one of the grandest driveways Steve had ever laid eyes on, and he wondered if it was too late to reconsider Tony’s offer of having him get patched up there.
Steve paused, choking on a laugh at the thought of Tony trying to surreptitiously slide a dozen cookies into his expensive leather jacket without being detected by the staff. “God, I love you, you big idiot,” he responded simply, which was a little off-topic, but what could he say, the feeling just struck him and he wanted Tony to know it, “I’ll be home soon.”
Steve had moved his stuff out into his shitty Brooklyn apartment by the end of the week, and it had all been over. He’d allowed one of the best things left in his life to slip right through his fingers, and he’d never even attempted to fight for it.
Across the floor, he spotted the straight-razor he’d been using to shave a few minutes earlier. Shaking fingers reached out and picked them up, just looking for something vaguely normal for him to do, but his grip was unsteady and he cursed to himself as the blade cut through his thumb. Fuck. He should probably clean it up. Steve got mad about dishes, so he’d undoubtedly lose his shit over blood all over white tiles.
Steve looked up, and then without another moment’s hesitation he jumped from the couch and headed out of the room, holding a hand out for Bucky to stay where he was as he made his way through the kitchen and toward the door. He couldn’t see anything through the frosted glass of the window, but when he pulled open the door a moment afterward, he spotted Tony a few paces away, hands stuffed rigidly into his pockets as he stared at the ground.
You- you’re still trying to put me first, aren’t you? Jesus, Tony- you say you’re incapable of telling people they matter to you, and then you pull the moon outta the sky because one of us said it looked pretty! You know… love doesn’t show in words, Tony, it shows in actions. Always.”
Tony’s fist clenched. Don’t freak out. This was alright, he could just do something else. Wasn’t like there wasn’t a myriad of other tasks to complete, and the blueprints weren’t urgent. He just… God, why couldn’t Collins just answer his fucking phone? It wasn’t hard. Click a fucking button and help Tony try to translate whatever mess he’d made all over the graph paper. He’d just set himself up and gotten out his angle-measuring ruler and his pencils and now he had to go and put it all away again, so he’d essentially wasted five minutes of precious time. Fucking bullshit, he was firing Collins. Asshole.
“And what about you?” Steve asked casually, “how’d you end up there, then?”
, oh my God, I- no. Just… no.” He made a few incredulous little faces for a few seconds, and then just dropped his head into his hands. His shirt was still hanging comically off his shoulders, and the anxious part of Steve wanted to straighten it out, just for something to do.
The door was opened, and Peter heard the soft, anxious sigh his Pops let out upon seeing Peter, curled up on the bed with his back facing him.
“Sorry,” he said with a shrug, as he’d pulled out the blanket and spare pillow, “I used to make Sam and his old girlfriend do it. We know what you kids are like, that’s all.”
“Do you have
“You’ll miss your bus,” he said with a frown, but Steve just shrugged.
He swallowed. Goddamn it, Steve. “Well tell him to come to bed- real bed. I… uh, I probably need some help, with the leg and all, you know.” He looked down at the dumb chair and the dumb leg with a clenched jaw, wishing it could just fucking go away. But it wouldn’t, and he needed to get into his pajamas and brush his teeth and he couldn’t do that without someone to help him. He wanted it to be Steve… it was selfish of him, but he just wanted the other man to hold him again. It’d been so long since Steve- real Steve, not… not the other version of him, had held Tony.
He wondered what was going to happen to him when he finally made their tempers break. When they finally got sick of his shit.
Tony stared at him, mouth falling open as Steve hummed something Tony had never heard before, with words that sounded like complete gibberish. Tony knew a lot of languages, but never in his life had he come across anything like what Steve was saying. His voice was soft and wavering, not particularly great, but he could carry a tune.
He shook his head and crouched back down, tugging Peter into a sitting position and carefully getting his little onesie off. Peter tried to grab for his reactor again, and Tony swatted his hand away with a tut. “Focus, kid,” he said, “all these arms are tricky to remove from clothing, you know.”
“I’m not going to let you tempt me, Tony,” Steve said, biting his lip and unwrapping Tony from his neck. It looked like he was having a tough time believing his own words, but he kept firm, yanking them both up into standing and then manoeuvring Tony until he was facing the direction of his wardrobe. “We will definitely be coming back to that later, though.”
Eventually, when Steve downright refused to accept the latest suit Tony had made him and then finished by yelling at Tony to stop being such a goddamn idiot, Tony had had enough. They were getting sick of him even when he was doing his best to give them what he wanted, and it was only a matter of time before they sat him down and told him that they needed him gone. He just knew it. Maybe some would call it a product of his sleep-deprived self hatred, but he didn’t fucking care. The Avengers were all he had, and whether they hated him or not,
Tony stopped moving, looking back at Steve, who was still sat with his legs crossed on the bed. He raised an eyebrow. “You don’t know me well enough to say that,” he told Steve bluntly.
There was a cup of coffee in Steve’s hand, and Tony looked at it in surprise. “Didn’t know you liked it black. Or caffeinated. What happened to the ‘coffee is the devil’ shtick?”
The group watched him for another few seconds, before Zeke leaned over to Ty and then gestured down the hall again. Shooting Steve one last look, they finally slinked off to wherever they were headed- Steve really wondered if they spent more time skipping than they actually did in lesson.
Tony laughed, pushing Steve back down onto the bed to crawl on top of him and continue kissing in a more horizontal position. Steve smoothed his hands across Tony’s chest, ready to say something about how it really would be inappropriate to start removing pants while still in hospital, but he never quite got the chance. A second later, the door burst open and three people spilled into the room. “Steve!” Bruce called as he entered, “Steve, are you okay, your heart monitor’s going—oh.”
Steve hoisted his bag higher up on his shoulder and made his way over to the cafeteria, eyes going to his table in the corner of the room. There were crowds of people in the way as usual, but he dodged them all expertly and pushed his way over, making a face over to Sam as the other boy spotted him and grinned- because that asshole always
Oh God. What the fuck had they done to him?
Someone yelled after him, but he didn’t register it. The ground was beginning to crumble away under his feet, he had seconds left, and
Well. That sure was a swift end to his good mood. He’d never get the thing dry in time, because everything he owned was now
“Stop thinking about it,” Natasha told him, but Steve
It was a only in the last few minutes that Steve propped his head back up, just in time to watch a massive debate open up on the table between which teacher would be most likely to murder Tony before they graduated. Sam, Natasha and Thor were firmly on the side of it being Miss Hill, but Tony and Clint were putting a valiant fight up on behalf of Principal Fury. Hands were gesturing wildly, voices were getting louder, and asses left seats as all of them became more and more adamant. Steve, however, was happy just to watch in vague amusement as Tony used one hand to flip Thor off and the other to continue holding Steve’s own under the table.
“Yeah,
“That wasn’t a euphemism, I really did just have a chat with her,” she said calmly, “and I can assure you, she won’t ever be making decisions like that again. Not even for all the money in the world.”
His hands moved slowly and then curled around the belt loops of Tony’s jeans, only to be stopped by Tony’s hands- again. When he looked up questioningly, Tony just shook his head and frowned once more.
Loki laughed, standing up and patting Steve on the shoulder as he moved across the room. “Funny,” he commented, “I’m going to make more coffee. Want in?”
Well. Steve refused to saw ‘awed’. It wasn’t awe, obviously. He really wasn’t- he wasn’t good enough to inspire that sort of reaction.
Tony had no idea what it was that Steve had dreamt of, but he still knew exactly what to say to make it better. The gestures felt almost familiar- Steve supposed this must be what Tony did when he had nightmares whilst they slept together. The thought warmed him, even in the cold of the night. Tony must… he really cared.
“Shut up,” Tony cut in, slicing a hand through the air, “Steve—Steve, stop talking. Just…” He looked at Steve with a face that looked damn near heartbroken, and then stepped forward, his hands reaching out to slide over Steve’s shoulders. He flexed his fingers and held on tight, shaking his head and looking down at him. Steve wanted to run his fingers over ever cut, every bruise on Tony’s beautiful face—wanted to apologise, over and over and over, until all of it just went away again. But that clearly wasn’t what Tony wanted, so Steve kept his mouth shut.
After a few more questions were exchanged, everyone seemed to agree on the course of action, and Tony heard Clint start barking out instructions to the people on the other side of the building that were still alive. Steve and Tony both hurried through to the stairwell, taking out anyone guarding their path with brutal efficiency and following the trail of destruction that led them further into the building. Tony felt his mind buzzing, and his body was edged with apprehension. There was a little niggling thought in his head that was making him think there was something not quite right about this. He couldn’t put his finger on it. Maybe it was the lack of coordination to this enemy’s movements. They were just coming in one wave, which left them totally exposed at the back. It was sloppy, even for AIM.
Thor just laughed. “Yeah. Loki.” He shook his head and finally looked up, into the sky where the rain was just beginning to let up a little. “My own little brother, gone past a point where I have a clue about what to do with him. I don’t even
“Okay, first movie over, second round of mead begins,” Clint declared, reaching for another bottle. A unanimous round of agreement rose around the room, and various people crawled from various spots in the room to reach the bounty pile in the centre of the rrug and pull bottles from its depths. Steve grabbed one, then looked to Tony in question, but the boy shook his head.
Neither of them had called the other by their actual name in
Steve didn’t speak for a moment. He seemed troubled as he looked back down at the floor, the golden blond strands of his hair falling forward and the tips of the ears poking Tony in the shoulder. “Because I just feel like… I feel like I ruin all your fun by being Unhuman,” he said quietly, glancing up at Tony for a moment before once more averting his gaze. “I’m not ashamed of who I am. I’m not. But— but I know how much of a downer it must be to just be enjoying things and then get told by your miserable vampire boyfriend that you can’t enjoy it because it’s incorrect, or it’s bigoted, or the company that owns it hates Unhumans or whatever.” He shrugged minutely. “I imagine it wouldn’t take very long for you to get very bummed out and annoyed by that. I didn’t want to push you away.”
have control over it, so I must insist you inform—”
“-To sleep,” Steve turned his head a little, raising an eyebrow, “considering how long it’s been since you actually engaged in that activity.”
“You, uh- you gonna take them or…?” Tony asked, cocking his head a little, and the gesture was oddly familiar- like he was trying to work Steve out again.
Rocket chastised him when he bumped into the table for the second time, “if you’re gonna be like this until we get Stark back from space then I’m gonna have to ask that you just stay in your room and not touch anything or interact with anyone. It’s giving me a migraine just
Sam nodded, spearing another pancake and then fitting it all into his mouth at once. Steve just watched, rather fascinated. “That can’t be healthy.”
he’d been doing.
Tony continued to look concerned, but in the end he just sighed and then nodded. “Right,” he said with a sigh, “fine, let’s go. Just don’t fall off.”
“I don’t think he can help it,” Natasha said, and when Steve looked over to her, she was smiling softly, “pretty sure you’re irrevocably drawn toward chaos, aren’t you?”
“I did. Now do you want me to call you a cab-“
Luckily, Steve kept his run to vaguely human standards, and half a minute later they’d arrived at this tree Steve was so excited about. That was where they spent the rest of their evening, both of them facing off with one another, backs resting on opposing branches as they talked. The warm sunshine speckled Steve’s face as it shot through the leaves, and it caught on his irises in a way that made them almost glow. He was older now than when they’d first met, all the way back 7 years ago now, but he was still just as stunning. Steve aged- Thank God- and it showed on his face with little laugh lines and slightly weaker blond hairs than what he’d had at the beginning, not quite fading to gray, but perhaps a few years away from starting. Tony just felt honoured to know that he was going to be around to see that transition. He was going to get to grow old with Steve. If Steve said yes, that was.
“Yeah, you’re going to the hospital,” Tony nodded slowly and then pulled out his phone. “It’s fifteen minutes away. I’ll drive.”
“It’s funny how Steve only ever gets himself into shit when you’re around, isn’t it?” Bucky asked, hand holding firm to Steve’s shoulder, “funny how you’re always the one to ride in and save him, so very fucking conveniently.”
But there was no need to worry. Tony’s smile was soft, reverent, and he nodded his head while his own fingers wrapped around the back of Steve’s hand, guiding it toward his chest. It settled across the fabric of his shirt, and Steve shut his eyes as he let the sound of that soft thrumming swell in his ears. It was more comforting than anything else could’ve been just then, and Steve sighed quietly, nudging himself a little closer to Tony’s side. He was warm and lax, the dips and edges of his body so wonderfully familiar as they pressed against Steve.
Maybe Tony was just the exception, because that was the sort of treatment he deserved. Only way to handle him properly, right? And it was effective. Tony tended not to argue with Steve lately, just to avoid potential conflict.
Tony chuckled softly, and his hand came to rest at the base of Steve’s neck, curling the little hairs that lay there. “I’m sorry too,” he admitted, “I should have warned you. I just… God, I just wanted to expose you to as little of that part of my life as possible. Thought I’d never need to warn you about it, because you’d just never interact with them. This was a dumb thing to think. I’m sorry for hurting you.”
end up turning into an asshole who hurts Tony on purpose for whatever reason, I give you permission to go full terminator on me.”
The boy- Clint, he guessed- shrugged in defeat. “She’s not wrong. I’m Clint, by the way. I didn’t already say that, did I? I can’t remember.”
“I know that you keep it quiet,” Ty continued, something glinting in his eye, “I know you avoid photos and take extra measure to stop yourself getting caught out. To anyone who doesn’t know you, Steve Rogers barely even exists in your life.” He glanced over to Steve and cocked his head. “How does that feel, by the way? Knowing your own boyfriend is too ashamed to be seen with you? He never did that when we were fucking.”
Tony shook his head and pulled away, but Steve was already taking his hand, the right one, the one full of infinity stones. He felt the burn of them when his fingers brushed them, but he didn’t let up. “Just trust me,” he hissed in blind panic, “the power shared means the power halved, so just
“You think?” Rhodey pressed, voice getting harder, “why did you leave if you only ‘thought’ he was okay-“
Everyone mumbled a bashful apology, and Rhodey levered the hospital bed into a more upright position with a small chuckle and another ruffle of Tony’s hair. The table was wobbly thanks to the tiling of the medical bay floor, and Tony had to make sure not to move too much or else he’d knock his leg up against something under the table and cause himself a world of pain. It was pretty uncomfortable, really. But there was nowhere else in the world he would rather be.
“I don’t fucking love him,” Tony growled, getting to his feet and turning to the Iron Man armour that was half-assembled at his side so he didn’t have to look at Steve’s expression. “I’m just—”
“Okayyy…” Tony said cautiously, hands still half-lifted, “how about, rather than just sticking to the ceiling, I take you for a ride in my flying suit? Then you can stick to the biggest, highest,
“I don’t want you to stink of smoke, especially not if you’re coming home with me,” Steve explained, pulling Tony’s hand down and then starting to tug him forward gently.
“Then I’ll teach you,” Tony nodded to himself, hopping back over the desk and then walking up to Steve, “I just finished my routine anyway. I’ll teach you how to dance better than most pros will know with years worth of lessons.”
“Who made the call?” Natasha asked with a cocked head instead, folding her arms, but Michael only looked at her with another government-official smile. The corner of his mouth ticked back and forth a little, some sort of twitch. Probably from having to smile that plastically all the time.
Well great. That had been the most disjointed and stupid thing he’d possibly ever said.
Steve paused for another second, before he nodded once. “Yes Sir,” he conceded, voice clipped as he rose from his chair slowly. For a brief moment, his eyes met with Tony’s. One of them was hardly visible; swollen from an injury. Steve remembered where he’d received that from: saving Santa Barbara from getting crushed by a twenty-foot robot. He hadn’t needed to do that. But he chose to anyway.
“He did
Just like before, he thought, a bittersweet feeling curdling in his gut as he made his way over to the desk and tried to find the source of the sound. It wasn’t difficult to spot; a spare helmet, half-way through repairs and looking more than a little bit worse for wear. Steve smiled fondly and the sight of it, picking it up and searching curiously for what was making the noise. When he saw the red dot flashing within it, the smile became a frown. Tony had told him before that he could relay visual and audio messages from one suit to the other; usually floor plans or objects that he needed a clear conceptualised idea of. Which meant that… that there was a message in there that must have just come through from one of the iron man suits.
gonna be the one fucking
“Hey,” he said quietly, swallowing the stupid desire to just get up and run away, “I… uh…“
Her chest heaved with a sharp, shaky breath. “I will still have let you do this,” she snapped, “whether I remember or not, I will still have sat back and watched you kill yourself. This isn’t right, Steve.”
and then dropped his head a little, kissing Tony’s neck softly.
Because he did. He really, really did. And it was… It was a big step, for him.
“They’re
Steve laughed absently, arms instantly curling across Tony’s body and adjusting him so that he was facing the TV instead. “Nice to see you too.”
Steve nodded and stepped in, hand snaking around his waist. “Duck your head,” Tony informed him quickly, before firing up the repulsors and smashing through the roof. He’d fix it alongside all the other damage done during training.
“Can you not do this in my room, please? God, you know what, never mind, I preferred it when you were fighting,” Peter grumbled, but ultimately failed to convince anyone, what with the immovable little beam on his face as he watched his parents, seemingly back to normal once more.
The next morning, he awoke to an empty bed.
the team. And if he no longer had that going for him… well, it seemed unlikely they’d want to just hang out with him anyway.
Except he’d been alone. and usually, no matter how mad they were at each other, Pops and Dad had always talked to Peter about this together.
He kept his mouth shut and chewed on his fries, sitting silently as all his friends talked around him- about the fight, about the upcoming mission in Montreal that Tony was also not invited to- things that, in any normal circumstance, Tony would probably have been able to interject with or at least contribute to. Except now he felt as if he was intruding.
Tony didn’t seem to mind either, because as soon as Steve’s mouth touched his, he melted right back in again, a soft hum of happiness vibrating in his throat that turned into a little giggle a moment later. “Steve, I have to- I have to get ready, Jesus-“
He, Natasha and Clint were currently infiltrating a large AIM underground base that was on SHIELD’s radar due to various nefarious reasons, main one being illegal scientific experimentation. Steve, at this point in his life, was woefully used to that phrase cropping up on a bi-weekly basis, and when the file had been handed to him, he’d merely sighed to himself. It wasn’t world-ending, but it was unfortunately high-priority enough to make him have to call up Tony and cancel their evening reservation.
“I’m- glad you’re happy, Steve,” he said, and the way he looked at Steve in that moment sort of- sort of sent him reeling a little. There was something in his eyes that Steve couldn’t place- something strong. It was sad- but there was more to it than that. It was a softness, too.
“Tony—”
,” and Tony had stumbled to his feet now, eyes pleading as he curled his other hand around Steve’s wrist and stepped forward. He looked- he looked
Steve raised a small, knowing eyebrow over to Tony. “Oh, who would’ve thought?” He asked, smiling. Tony just rolled his eyes and then leaned into him as Steve got down on his haunches, looking at the giant mound of cotton and softness that pretty much towered over them. “How does a house even have this many fucking pillows?” He asked Thor incredulously.
Tony hummed. He had a feeling that he might not hold out that long. “Was gonna… had the mistletoe everywhere,” he muttered, “and specially designed crackers. It was a whole thing.”
So Tony Stark
They stayed in their room for hours as Steve did his best to worship every part of Tony’s body he was capable of worshipping. In times like these, when Tony was so used to being in a state of stress or frustration or sadness, it made something deep inside Steve feel so innately pleased to be able to bring Tony out of that—to make him smile and relax. Seeing Tony fall apart over and over underneath him was something Steve was sure that he’d never tire of. Not now or in twenty goddamn years.
“Who’re you with?” Steve, hurried up the stairs, heading into his room, “can’t they offer you help?”
Steve broke away for a second, watching in hypnotised fascination as Tony did his level best to catch up with him. They stared at eachother for a moment, before Steve turned his head to the side and blew out the smoke that had ended up in his mouth.
. If there’s a chance—if we could bring back everyone. Sam and Bucky and T’challa, Peter—”
Steve looked at it for a moment, before taking it from Tony’s hand curiously. He wondered what it was Tony had done to it- maybe an upgrade or something? He hoped it wasn’t too complicated for him to understand.
Tony stared at them all, before scoffing. “It is
Steve shook his head and then grinned softly as Tony stared up at him, his face a myriad of different and equally endearing emotions. Embarrassment. Fear. Bashfulness. And then there was, of course, the way Tony's hands were squeezed tight around Steve, like the touch was all he had in the world. He knew that Tony needed this. "You're amazing. And clever. And capable. And good and kind and-"
He looked back up, at the stupid bolster-wood bathroom door, now cracked through the middle.
“We are indeed talking, Mr. Rogers,” the AI actually sounded amused, which was pretty amazing, really, “there is no other explanation for the exchange of words across one intelligent being to another.”
Steve grinned again, before rolling off Tony and getting out of bed, throwing the clothes that had been laid out for them at Tony and then turning to his own wardrobe.
Tony squeezed their hands together. “Oh, I know. I’ve just wanted to hold hands with you since I was twelve.”
Tony smiled, and grudgingly followed Steve’s orders, despite the early hour and lack of coffee.
"So what- he ashamed of you or somethin'?"
“Go on.”
“What is there to be angry for?”
pretty tired. But I wanna… touch your ass. S’nice.” He looked up at Tony again with his deep blue eyes, so genuine and honest as he asked “please can I touch your ass? Just a little bit.”
like an episode of some sort back there,” Tony said sharply, the worry and panic seeping into his voice a little as he stared at Steve. The man looked gaunt; his hands covered his eyes, but it just accentuated how sharp his cheekbones were.
Visiting all the schools the next day was hard. Tony hadn’t ended up actually getting much sleep at all, and despite the fact he’d thoroughly taped his ribs, they still ached with every movement. He didn’t let on about it though, because he didn’t want to try and explain it away. Just bent down to greet all the little children and smiled at them through gritted teeth that he hoped were still non-threatening enough.
His mom had always said he’d been good at sniffing out trouble.
Steve just grimaced and then pocketed his phone, looking back in the direction of the mansion and worrying at his lip. He sort of wished he’d stayed- upset as he was, Tony had still been the one who’d had some sort of major freakout over it, and Steve wanted to get to the bottom of it at the very least. Because he knew for a fact that Tony saying Steve’s wellbeing wasn’t important was complete bullshit; he might have self-worth issues, but even he could see that Tony gave more of a damn about him than he’d shown just then. It didn’t make sense, really.
It only got worse when he heard Tony’s small “I’m sorry,” from beside him.
How could you-” He couldn’t finish, his throat wouldn’t work; and he was still trying to pull away but it was weak, and Steve was on his knees, fingers shaking as they curled around Tony’s waist, whispering broken apologies into Tony’s stomach, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I love you, I’ll make it up to you, I’m sorry baby, please-”
But that was just his emotions talking. That was just the part of him that still loved his fiancé, still wanted to be the man that got to wake up every morning and know he was loved in return. That was the part of him that had never moved on, and probably never would. He couldn’t let that rule over him when so many people were at stake.
Steve leveled him with a truly disdainful look. “You’ve named your car… Bertha.”
Steve looked down at him, fondness and worry and love and concern all warring in his head as he continued to stroke through Tony’s hair. When he looked up, he saw Bucky watching them, the same sort of concern mirrored on his face. “He alright?” He asked quietly, careful not to disturb the sleeping boy, “he was really tense when he came in. You two talked it out, right?”
Tony had this problem every morning.
“Where are your glasses, Tony?” Steve says, fond exasperation evident in his voice as he pulls Tony upright again and then softly places a hand against his jaw, checking to see that all braining incidents had been 100% avoided.
Steve paused a fraction of a second before saying, “yes.”
“Steve,” Tony said seriously, “we are
“Well you do it, everyone does it- why shouldn’t I?” Steve asked, and he’d started out just trying to persuade Tony to stop drinking, but suddenly the actual idea itself didn’t seem too bad at all. A good way to just numb it all out for a second, just like everyone said it did-
“I saw you,” he repeated, the same and only words he’d spoken since that shot had rung out, “I… it was only for a fraction of a second, I don’t… but it was you. I’m sure of it.”
He knew he’d been an idiot. The whole event was just fucking humiliating, and he just… he wanted to go home and fucking forget about it. That was all. Once they were home, Steve would stop being so flighty. The team would stop looking so goddamn guilty all the fucking time, and everything could just be
He found Thor, crouched on his haunches in front of the couch with a deeply concerned expression etched like stone onto his face. The couch wasn’t facing Steve, so he couldn’t see what Thor was looking at, but he could guess.
Tony’s, thank you very much) Tony had pretty much completely forgotten the feeling of displacement amongst the team. It was easy, when they were all together like that, getting into squabbles every five minutes about the most irrelevant shit you could think of. Steve was sat next to him, shooting those little glances and soft smiles his way every time Tony caught him looking, and then across on the other side of the van Tony was trying to avoid Clint and Natasha’s knowing winks and sniggers. They were children and honestly, Tony was far above that. He stuck his tongue out and shot them both the bird when Steve wasn’t looking, but that was only in retaliation, obviously.
“Tony,” Natasha’s voice called out to him, and he felt his leg as it was shifted again, the tearing sound of a blade cutting through the material of his trousers. The pain was fading now, which was probably not a good sign at all, because that meant he was already losing consciousness. “Tony, bite down on this.” She held a leather belt—Rhodey’s, probably—to his mouth, and Tony took it between his teeth dutifully.
“This?” Tony said softly, flicking a hand toward his body, “this is not your fault, Steve. You didn’t make me tell Ty to shove his head up his ass. You didn’t force me to stick around and take all that time putting JARVIS into that console. You didn’t tell Howard to hit me, and you didn’t tell me to just sit there and take it like a fucking bitch—”
“Get a grip,” he muttered to himself, shaking his head and then wiping the water out of his eyes as he stepped out from the spray and wrapped a towel around his midsection. He wasn’t going to bring this up with Steve right now. Tony knew it’d only upset him, and he didn’t want to fight. Anyway, it wasn’t even that important. Steve wasn’t an idiot; he was just as aware of all this as Tony was. But where Tony liked to err on the side of (admittedly pretty intense) caution when it came to emotional vulnerability, Steve tended to just throw himself in head-first and worry about the consequences when they hit him in the face later. And he was headed for a pretty damn big smack in the face at this rate. They all were.
“— He’s not… okay, whatever, look, you’re right. I can’t just walk out. But Tony can summon his suit, and once he’s got that, nothing SHIELD can do will stop him, you know that.”
, not just Tony, I’ll do everything in my power to stop you.” He pursed his lips and stood his ground, even when Zeke laughed and stepped forward.
Pull on the tie, wrap it around, Windsor knot… wait, that was probably the wrong colour. Blue, not red- he was repping Stark Industries as opposed to Iron Man today, he needed the right colours. Which cufflinks? Was Steve breathing, or was he dead? The longer Tony left him, the worse his brain damage would be.
It was.
Steve smiled back, but it was heavy. “Last time, we had Iron Man,” he murmured, “we had Thor. We had a team.” Last time aliens had come through trying to take over London, the Avengers had been a cohesive unit that worked together seamlessly, Iron Man and Thor offering air support while Clint, Nat and Steve worked on the ground and the Hulk did some concentrated smashing. They’d wrapped up in under four hours, Steve rolling his eyes when he saw Tony do his trademark Iron-Man landing beside him, lift up his faceplate and then dip Steve in his arms to give him a smack on the lips.
Bucky leaned forward and poked him warily in the chest. "Hey, sorry man. You're right. Tony'd have to be stupid to be ashamed of you, I'm just- I'm just being a dick, you know me."
who fucking raised him.”
And yes, yes, maybe that did sound a
that bad-”
So Steve was ending it. He was ending it because he knew Tony never would.
the voice started up in his head,
“How come Nat got to stay in even when it
It hurt.
Steve looked back at Peter, scooping up another dollop of what Tony could only describe as weird orange-coloured slime. “It tastes like dead people’s toes,” Steve informed him.
It had quickly become… home.
out of trouble a few days ago, Rogers,” Tony said lightly, a hand going to Steve’s shoulder and pushing down slightly, “can you get in on your own?”
okay?”
He stumbled out of the way of another rapid swipe, feeling his side wrench in agony as the wound was pulled. Rumlow grinned, showing his teeth. “This is a pleasant surprise,” he drawled, flipping his blade threateningly as he took a step forward. “I thought I was gonna have to think up a whole plan in order to kill you, but as it turns out, I’m just going to be able to do it right here and then claim self defence. Made it so easy for me, Rogers.”
“I am currently sat in the passenger seat of the car which Sir used in order to make his way here last night,” the AI said smoothly, whilst Steve’s eyes went wide, “I need you to grab the system in which I have been downloaded into and bring me upstairs so that I can complete a full health check upon Sir myself.”
Steve rolled his eyes and then kissed Tony’s neck, mouth lingering against the other man’s pulse. “S’good for ya,” he murmured, “Your cholesterol’s too high.”
Things had been going fine, really. Until Tony started letting himself goddamn
Steve opened his mouth, and then sighed. “Just not when I’m drunk,” he admitted.
Tony blinked once, rapidly trying to re-evaluate the situation. “Huh?” He said, eloquent as ever, “then what was with all of the…” Tony waved his hands absently, “getting mad when the team talked made all the ‘big happy family’ jokes? Why do you always look at me funny when I’m holding him?”
He sighed in acknowledgment as he pulled out his wallet and glanced back- where Ty was now in conversation with another person (Zack? Z-something, the one who’d been bullying the Parker kid earlier, anyway), the both of them staring at him with equally dirty looks on their faces. With nothing better to do, Steve just gave them a vague salute and then turned back to the vending machine.
He followed Tony down the corridor until they ended up in what looked like the master bedroom. It was huge- empty aside from a few cabinets that had been left behind, and the orange sunlight streamed in through the massive French windows on the back wall. His brow creased, wondering what Tony had actually brought him all this way for- but when he turned back to Tony, the boy had moved over to the windows- throwing them open and revealing a balcony on the other side.
Tony rubbed his hands together gleefully—which, okay, was probably insensitive, but that phone was the biggest clue they had in regards to Peter’s origins, and after some rather stunning bargaining-slash-blackmail-slash-bamboozlement of poor Federal Recruitment Officers, Tony had managed to snag the thing from the FBI before they’d even gotten the chance to tamper with it. That meant fresh, untouched, beautiful data encryptions and information that would surely lead Tony to finding what he was looking for. It was like being a kid in a damn candy store.
, kissing him, his hands around Steve’s waist, every movement of his fingers being like something burning hot touching his skin, and he’d just given Steve the best birthday present he could possibly have thought of because he was
They briefly stopped, and Tony took the opportunity to briefly remove his mouth from Steve’s and grab at Clint, in order to pull him in and smack a wet kiss to his lips.
“I totally have the guts to kiss someone first. Hell, I just did!”
hoped that wasn’t the case.
In fact, if he hadn’t come down one time, half asleep and wearing literally
“Thank you,” he said quietly, and Bucky turned to look at him with a wry smile, but Steve just pushed on, “for always having my back. Even if it does mean you do stupid shit like this because of it, you mad mother-hen.”
Jesus Christ.
"Why do you do that?" He asked suddenly, furrowing his brows, "you always call me by my full name."
“Orders can be circumvented if I believe it is in your best interest to do so,” JARVIS informed him.
There was a bang.
When he bent down to curl a hand around the wipe, Steve noticed the back of his neck had turned red.
But Thor was, of course, already moving, getting to his knees in the sodden earth beside her little plaque and then carefully scraping off some of the dirt that had accumulated over it. Steve sniffed again, and blinked a few times before also dropping to his knees opposite Thor and picking out the weeds.
Steve lifted his hand slowly and settled it against Tony’s cheek, just for a second. He nodded again, like he was convincing himself.
There was a short silence. Then- “and what the fuck was Tony Stark doing driving ‘round Lower East?” He asked, an edge to his voice that Steve couldn’t work out.
His hands were shaking, and he could feel his eyes prick. In the space of one conversation, he’d managed to ruin everything.
Steve waited for a response, but Richards remained voiceless. And Steve could only wait so long. “I need access to it,” he repeated, harder this time, “now.”
It was hope.
"Do something," he looked at Steve in the end, his face leaving no room for excuses, "you're Captain America, you survived fifty years in the Arctic, nothing can defeat you. Please, for the love of God,
He told Bruce to stay put and then forced his legs to move, head out of the door. Tony would be okay in the few minutes he was gone. Jogging back to where Rhodey and Natasha still lay, he nodded his head and assured them that Bruce and Tony had made it through. Then he crouched down and looked at Rhodey. “Hope you don’t mind being bridal-carried,” he said.
Steve worked as carefully as he could whilst Tony hissed and made distressed noises at the sting of the antiseptic against his open wounds. Steve imagined the cuts had to have been caused by some sort of heavy ring that Howard had been wearing; unless he’d gotten an elbow in, in which case it was lucky Tony was still conscious at all. Elbows were lethal.
But whatever. He dismissed it fairly quickly- too early to be worrying about those things after all.
They both glared at one another for a moment, before Loki’s lip curled bitterly. “You don’t know a single fucking thing, Rogers,” he said with a shake of his head, “you didn’t have to grow up with my brother as your constant shadow. You didn’t have to be treated like second-best when compared to him. All you saw was poor little Thor, sad because his brother doesn’t love him, yet you never wondered why?” He stood from the armchair, glancing at his watch with a chuckle before looking back to Steve. “Well, it’s been a fun three minutes. But I feel as if I’m not wanted here, so I’ll just—”
Tony didn’t say anything else. Neither did Steve. Eventually, he just heard Tony start up the car and then felt the pull as they turned back into the road. “Sam’s house is-“
“I’ll make sure to let you know,” Steve finished, even though that part was a lie too. He’d rather burn his favourite pencils than put any more of his problems on Mr and Mrs Wilson’s shoulders. They had done far too much for him already.
, he didn’t know where to turn. There was no-one he could talk to who’d believe him, not even for a second. Because it just wasn’t what Steve did. Everyone knew that.
Steve looked up from Tony’s shoulder slowly, brow creasing a little. They were sat on the couch back at Steve’s, the whole day having been spent wandering around New York together until eventually Steve had managed to persuade Tony to come over and just relax with him and some movies at home. They’d been sprawled on the couch for little over an hour now, watching reruns of How I Met Your Mother and throwing various projectiles at any misguided friend who attempted to join them. It was, unsurprisingly, the warmest sort of feeling in the world- although Tony had apparently decided that it was time to start talking again, so Steve was more than fine with doing that too.
Tony couldn’t talk. Didn’t have a clue what to say even if he could. He thought about getting on his knees and begging Steve to stay, seeing where that led him.
His nails dug into his palms. “I’m… I can’t take back what I did, but I- I can help you feel safer from now on. It’s okay. I’m sorry I didn’t… I didn’t answer your call sooner, I was selfish, I didn’t want—but I promise, I promise, you won’t ever have to see me again, Tony. Not from here on in.”
With a final look up at Steve and his beautifully living, breathing face, Tony slipped quietly out of consciousness against the other man’s stomach.
“Yeah, and you’re clearly not getting shit out of him, are you?” Steve responded coldly, resisting the urge to swing and hit the bastard right in his gnarly face. “So why don’t I try, and then we’ll see where that goes, huh?”
“Inviting Tony was my idea, thank you, I would like to take credit for that one,” Sam raised a hand and winked over to Steve, “figured that would serve as a good enough birthday present, right Steve?”
Tony smiled down at him, and Bruce returned it until Nat poked him in the arm and his focus shifted. “Happy Christmas,” she said, showing them her watch, now reading at 00:00.
Steve felt his nails puncture his own skin. He hated himself so viscerally in that moment that he wasn’t even sure what to do with all the emotion sat on his chest. He wished he could scream. Wished that he could go to a gym and punch something until his hands bled and skin tore. But he couldn’t, because he’d spent months hurting Tony, and Tony had stayed because
“What?” He asked, when he looked back up and caught Steve trying to hold back on a smile.
Repeatedly.
And, of course, there was Steve and Peter, right in the middle of it all as they sat at the table. Steve was waving a fork somewhat desperately in the direction of Peter’s mouth while the child firmly refused to let it past his lips, instead banging his sippy cup loudly against the tray of his high-chair and darting his head backward to escape the mouthful of mushy food. Tony watched the interaction for a few seconds, that familiar fuzzy warmth settling like a warm blanket over his chest as Steve ran a hand across his forehead and looked down firmly at the little boy. “Peter,” he said, “open your mouth. It’s yummy, I promise. Here, look!” After a brief second of pausing in which to cast a wary glance at the fork, Steve turned it around and then put it in his mouth, smiling painfully. “Mmmm,” he declared with fake enthusiasm, “that’s nice. Nice healthy mushy food!”
Tony looked back up at him and beamed. “Absolutely,” he said, before leaping off in the last few feet and landing like a cat. Perfectly. He turned around and then looked up to Steve’s window, before blowing a kiss. “Love you!” He said, and then scampered off down the road, leaving Steve laughing incredulously in the window up above him. He kept laughing, in fact, right up until Tony was long gone, and the sound of his motorbike had drifted off into the night.
_____Tony_____
Right. Show-time.
“Asshole!” Tony made to shove him but Steve ducked away from the flying arm, snuggling in close to Tony’s back again and resting his chin on Tony’s shoulder.
. Controlling your life so that you wouldn’t end up finishing it yourself was pretty much all he did for half a year, and Goddamn it, he did it well. Look at you now- you’re better. You’re smiling more. It’s brilliant for us both to see.”
His head rested against something. It was warm, but solid. Steve tried to focus in on it. Golden, maybe. Angel? Was he dead?
“We thought he might be needed to save your life, and you know, he likes to know whether you’re alive and stuff!” Clint said defensively, hands going up, “and he’s very convincing when he’s all business-mode. He’s calling you an idiot down the line, by the way. Says he’s gonna kick your ass when he gets here.”
finger pressing down against the microphone button,
Out of nowhere, Steve suddenly found himself cut off by a sharp, ear-piercing bang, and the realisation that it was the sound of a bullet leaving a chamber took less than a second for his brain to process. Steve’s eyes moved of their own accord, primal instincts kicking in as he scoped out the danger. He saw it instantly. A man at the edge of the road, gun in hand, eyes wild, whole body shaking. There were no bodies immediately next to him, which meant it hadn’t been a mugging or fight of any kind. “FOR RACHEL!” He screamed hoarsely, and his eyes somehow found Steve’s on the sidewalk. Like he’d been watching and already knew that Steve was there. He flailed his arm frantically, gun waving through the air. “THAT WAS FOR RACHEL!”
Tony sighed into his mug, and Thor mirrored him. They were the only other two in the room, and yeah, maybe Tony had a little hold over Steve, but Natasha wasn’t here to see to Clint, and he was by far the more cutting of the two-
Steve made a displeased noise in the back of his throat, but then walked over and slid the plate onto Tony’s desk. “Yeah,” he said, “but I’ll be back soon. Please don’t get kidnapped while I’m gone.”
something at the back of his throat stopped the words from coming out. It felt a little bit like fear, but that wasn’t something he wanted to think about at all, so he shoved it down and just focused on trying to be more gentle with the way he spoke after that. After all, Tony had been the one who’d fucked this all up. Steve had been the one who’d suffered because of it.
Really, he just needed to go home. It was fine that Tony wanted to hang out with his other friends. It… well, it hurt, that he didn’t want any of them to know he’d sunk as low as dating Steve, but he could live with it. He understood.
“Steve,” someone said, somewhere in the part of his brain that wasn’t currently processing what he’d done, “Steve, can you hear me?” Natasha. It was Natasha’s voice, quiet and calm as if talking to a frightened child.
“And Captain Asshole,” Tony continued with forced vigour, “if you’re the one who’s seeing this, then. Well. Fuck you, I guess. This? This is exactly what I was talking about when I said that somethin’ bigger was coming. Hell, maybe you’re not even… maybe—” he coughed and then huffed, shaking his own head to himself. “God, who am I kidding. Course you’re still alive. Not even God could put you down, could they Steve? Fuck.”
Tony looked down, and the tears slid over his cheeks. “I don’t belong here, with you,” he whispered, “this was never my world. And being here is killing you. I cannot let that happen, and I refuse to be responsible for that.”
She threw a bunch of twenties in his face. “You’re on pizza run,” she said simply, snuggling down further into Bucky’s arms.
Getting unsteadily to his feet, hair full of dust and face smeared with blood; looking for Steve,
Steve watched in amusement as his dancer friend stuck out his tongue in concentration, writing out
“No, I mean… you’re good at all of it,” Steve said, waving a hand to Peter’s general vicinity. “Looking after him. You’ve got a real soft spot for him, huh?”
They were both laughing as they wandered into the living room and made themselves comfortable- Bucky laying on Natasha’s lap, and Steve laying on Bucky’s. Around him, his friends lay buried in blankets or huddled up to the radiators- all except Thor, who was sat cross-legged in the center of the room and watching cartoons on Nat’s TV avidly, apparently not caring for the cold.
fuck you-“
Steve folded his arms. “Oh, and you decided to ask me this
He folded his arms as he watched Steve turn away from him, moving to the desk where he pulled open the drawer full of medical supplies. From there, he took an ice-pack, breaking the beads within to activate it before walking over to Tony and wrapping it gently around his stinging hand. He was calm, collected, He didn’t look at Tony with anything other than mild concern and a level of understanding that tended to terrify Tony if he thought about it too hard.
He couldn’t help but laugh as he nodded. “Yes, Tony. The civilian sort of retreat, with a farm in Ohio and a road-trip to get there, and no responsibilities at all for seven days. I’ve got everything set, if you say yes. Someone else can run my duties for a while, and I rescheduled my Op. And there’s good wifi so you can still talk with R&D or work on the blueprints.” He leaned his chin into Tony’s arc reactor and looked up at him through his eyelashes, shooting Tony his best puppy-eyed stare. “Say yes?” He asked sweetly.
“Oh, fuck it,” Steve whispered, pressing Tony Stark’s contact number and holding it up to his ear.
Tony sighed, and then a second later did what he always ended up doing when Steve was in a hospital bed: joined him. Shuffling onto the cot, he quickly tucked himself into Steve’s side and then guided Steve’s palm over to the cool, flat surface of his reactor. Then, he placed his own down upon Steve’s chest, right between his pecs. They were both quiet for a few seconds; Tony listening to each individual heart-beat, and Steve to the low hum of noise that the arc reactor was constantly giving out.
He couldn’t go. Steve was right. God- if Tony had just kept his mouth shut in the first place, Steve would probably not even have touched him. He always did this, always made it worse for himself. He was just a fucking idiot.
This whole situation
Tony was laughing, shaking his head in despair as he looked up at the ceiling. “Oh God have mercy on my soul, I knew I should never have introduced myself to you, look what I’ve gotten into-“
“It’s because I am,” Bucky said down the line, “so sue me for wanting to make sure you haven’t thrown yourself in front of a car yet. I worry.”
Tony bit his lip and leaned forward, burying his head into the warmth of Steve’s chest. “Thank you,” he murmured, “for staying.”
It was a mess. But it was their own, and after two years of nothing except occasional dark motel rooms and blowjobs, it was more than Steve could ever have hoped for.
“Asset,” Tony said again, “I…. please, Steve? Please. Don’t leave.” God, none of the words were fucking coming out right and he knew it, they must all be laughing at him so goddamned hard right now-
Tony considered it. “I mean, I don’t
They fought to get the gauntlet back to where it needed to go—the van right at the other side of the battlefield, of course, because their lives could never just be easy for once. Steve watched various heroes carry the Iron Gauntlet further forward, yelling at Peter to grab it as he saw it fly overhead. Everything was happening all at once, and then when fire started raining down on the Earth, Steve lost sight of the gauntlet entirely amongst the dust and smoke. He scrabbled under a protective barrier made by one of the sorcerers and spared a glance upward to observe the threat. In that same moment, that light—that glorious, amazing fucking photon-based light that had saved Tony’s life all those years ago—arced through the sky like an angel, and Steve felt himself whoop in vindication as Captain Marvel joined the fray, pounding through the entire ship like it was made of cotton candy.
“Don’t tell me what to fucking do, you don't have the fucking right any more,” Tony said loudly and violently, just struggling harder, to the point where Steve had to actually grab hard in order to not have him wriggle away. He figured not all of Tony’s anger was just for show.
He saw Bruce take position directly in front of him, gun in hand and a hard, determined look on his face. He would be here as the last line of defence, if Natasha and Rhodey couldn’t hold them all.
Steve asked for a Whiskey and then Tony directed him over to the couch in the living room, where he hobbled dutifully. He had to admit that maybe the ‘I never got over you’ angle would actually be easier to play, considering… well. Maybe it wasn’t so far from the truth as Steve would have liked. And by the looks of it, Tony seemed to be in the same boat. Steve wasn’t going to feel guilty for using that against him. He
It didn’t matter that this time last year, Tony had been sat around with a group of people he would have moved heaven and earth for, as they sat and bickered and hugged him, smiling and rolling their eyes when Tony said
Steve looked at him incredulously. “Stop ignoring me! I’m not going!”
Steve went with a fond sigh, mumbling under his breath until Clint thwacked him over the head and told him to savor the night, rather than grumble.
Mr. Wilson paused, hands flexing on the wheel. “So this was because of Tony? Again?” He sighed. “Steve… it always seems to be him that’s leading you to make these choices, and maybe—”
He wasn’t sure what time it was. Early morning, maybe. Beside him, Tony was fast asleep, snoring gently at his side as his arms extended out in front of him, reaching for something invisible. The light from his reactor shone a delicate blue into the room.
that hadn’t been what he’d actually gone and-
Steve noticed Tony’s breath catching every time his fingers brushed against his face. He didn’t say anything, though. Just tucked it away and saved it like it was precious.
It was him, without a doubt- but it was done in such a way that Tony had never seen before, and probably wouldn’t ever see out of anyone other than Steve Rogers.
Tony leaned forward and looked up at him with a small smile, and for a second, Steve felt like he hung the stars in the sky- at least, that was the way that Tony was gazing at him. “Kay,” he responded, taking Steve’s hand and pressing a kiss against his wrist. He shut his eyes slowly, listening to the pulse. “Still don’t know what I did to deserve you,” he murmured, before letting Steve’s hand slid out of his fingers.
Then, without further ado, he slammed the sharpened end of the screwdriver deep in between the LMD’s eyebrows, watching the sparks fly and the man’s eyes turn an eerie white as the pointy object drove its way straight through the motherboard.
But then Tony had to leave; a lab experiment that was very time sensitive, and Steve told him not to blow himself up, and Tony pinky-sweared before walking off with his hands in his pockets and his hair dancing in the wind. Steve just watched him go, along with most of the rest of the kids in the parking lot. Tony drew attention like a magnetic attraction, and at any one point there were always eyes on him.
Peter’s future was starting to look bleaker and bleaker by the second, and Tony had no Goddamn idea what to do about it.
it was all his fault, he was going to die knowing that he could have prevented this, he could’ve stopped it-
mine.”
That was what made up Steve’s mind, in the end. Because HYDRA had come in on large, three-person motorsleds, and although they could have been used for the travel down, Steve was almost certain Tony wouldn’t survive that. Hell,
“You know that’s probably what Tony daydreams about whenever he gets sent there, right?” Clint sing-songed with a laugh, before waggling his eyebrows over to Steve, “and I’m guessing you do too-“
“It’s not doing a very good job.”
Someone sidled up to him and laughed, and Steve turned to them, smiling awkwardly. They stuck out their hand. “I’m Joyce,” she shouted, words sounding just a little more than slurred, “you’re cute. Let’s dance.”
But Tony just cocked an eyebrow in amusement, and before Steve knew what was happening, Tony had swooped down and then picked him up in a perfect fireman’s carry, walking them both down the corridor with absolute ease. Steve just froze in complete and utter shock. This was the first time he’d ever been this close to Tony. Oh God, he smelt like metal and lemony things, and Steve was looking right down at he perfectly shaped ass.
Rhodey hissed again. “We took out as many as we could. But I can’t… I couldn’t get up after the last one, and I heard gunshots in the cabin from the few stragglers we couldn’t take out—”
“Go ahead,” Steve muttered, lurching forward and winding his hands around Tony’s neck in order to kiss him again, because that had suddenly jumped to his number one favourite thing in the entire world, and if he could have it his way he’d never have to stop doing it for the rest of his life.
“Oh, so Steve gets a man and suddenly his best buds’ gotta take the back-burner?” Sam told him from the floor, “I see how it is. What happened to bros before hoes?”
“— Steve, for fuck’s sake, the only reason you’re in this mess in the first place is because of me—”
He turned his head to where Bucky was pointing- feeling somewhat as if he was in a dream as he watched the Asgardian fly through the air, rising up above the ship with a hammer in one hand and Tony’s body in the other.
Tony hummed, shuffling his hand out from between their chests in order to press his fingers against the sharp jut of Steve’s jaw. “I might mess up again,” he whispered, “I’ll try, Steve, I will, but I’m still learning about everything. It might take a while.”
There was a long silence, Tony stiffening in front of him quickly and brutally. His face blanked, and Steve felt like an idiot.
“Steve’s gonna come find you soon, Tony,” she said easily, smiling at him as she stroked his hand, “just think about Steve, okay? What’s his favourite colour?”
“I have no fucking clue,” Tony said with a snort, “I hope so.”
“Oh by all means, inform me,” Steve said, equally as cold. He wasn’t going to back down to a bully like Ty. Not now, not ever.
had turned up- he barely even knew that girl.
That’s how he’d put it to Steve, after they’d left the underground levels and sat back in Fury’s office. Steve was probably lucky to even keep his job at all. Being emotionally compromised- especially toward someone as dangerous as Iron Man- was something that really should have cost him his position. It was probably only thanks to the fact Iron Man was in their custody because of him that he’d managed to get away with an extended period of leave and not a sacking.
There weren’t many skyscrapers along this skyline; the centre of Manhattan was tucked away to the corner like an unimportant detail. Instead, he was looking amongst smaller rooftops. There were trees and green things here, which he had never been able to see when he’d been up the empire state building. The sea was closer than he’d thought- a deep blue saphire spanning a thick line between horizon and land. And the
He nodded, voice empty as he looked down at the floor. “I understand.”
Steve absent-mindedly opened the passenger door for Tony, a small frown on his face. “I wouldn’t say that,” he argued, “we definitely know him, at the very least.”
So far, the plan had been going pretty… bad.
They all sat together, watching as the shadow of Principal Fury as it drew nearer to the door. When he opened it, all of them looked into the man’s cold face. His eyes met with Steve, and there was a deep sinking feeling in his gut as a bit of that adrenaline and rage wore off, reminded him of what he’d just gone and done.
There was a long silence, as all of them stared. Across the table, Natasha’s back straightened. “Could be coincidence,” Bruce tried, but everyone shook their heads immediately.
he told himself firmly,
Instead, he plummeted through three floors of the Avengers tower, feeling each impact as it bruised against his battered, exhausted body. Something thumped painfully against his head on the way down, and suddenly there was a dull buzzing in his ears, the world exploding into fuzzy light. He thought that he’d stopped moving by that point. Rubble bounced and boinked off the metal, and he could feel his arm sat at a funny angle up above his head.
With an irritated sigh, he pressed his glasses further up onto his nose and then rolled back over to the desk. Just as he reached out for his mug of coffee, JARVIS spoke up again: “Decryption complete, Sir.”
“As if he’d ever look twice at you.”
Tony shut his eyes, like he was physically trying to burn the memory of this into his mind. When he opened them again, they looked at Steve with the sort of reverence he’d only ever seen in people at galleries, staring up at masterpieces.
you’d come down wearing something of mine, I wanted to do this. I thought you were doing it on purpose- you
Because it's been a while since I ended on a cliffhanger :)
Steve had to wonder how many times Tony had done this before.
When Steve looked into the eyes of his own self from 12 years ago, he had a moment of astounding clarity, in which his entire life played out in front of him like a video tape.
“You mean
“You know,” Steve said as he popped the spoon into his mouth and sucked off the last vestiges of ice cream, “most people would find it offputting to have someone watch them while they eat.”
Clint stepped back, but Thor hesitated, looking over at Steve. “I-“
“Illegally,” Peggy told him with a grin, “I mean, that’s assuming we’ll even manage to set off when all of us are in it. I’m betting it’ll just fall apart as soon as Thor touches it. It looks like it’s made of tinfoil.”
He slipped into class and mumbled an apology to his teacher before sitting at his spot at the back of the room, next to Bruce. The boy was taking a nap on the desk, but when he heard Steve slip into the seat next to him he shot up like a rocket, face turning to Steve, immediately worried. “I heard what happened,” he said, “is Tony okay? How bad was it? Is he—”
Steve shook his head. “Tony, this is—fuck, this is so classified, just me being here is probably putting you in danger—I just, you were the closest person to Nevada that I could trust, and I—”
Well. He was, apparently, dealing with it by considering alcohol again. If he’d admitted to Steve that he wanted a drink, it must have been intense enough that he needed someone to know and therefore keep an eye on him. And that… that was not a good sign.
The possessive part of him was glad that this was a part of Tony that no one
If there was one thing that was integral to Tony Stark’s character, it was that he loved Halloween.
. You heard of HYDRA, Steve?”
, he couldn’t move, it was all happening too fast and he knew that usually it wouldn’t be a problem for him to keep up, but
“I’ll do it,” Steve promised fiercely, gripping Tony’s waist and rocking them back and forth, “I swear I’ll make it up, and I’ll book us a whole week away if you want, to make up for our anniversary- we can get the best hotel you want, have a candle-lit meal and everything, and then I’ll take you back to our room and lay you on the silk sheets and-”
“Sir, please-“ JARVIS started, the same anxious tone he had been speaking in ever since Tony had arrived on the roof, but Tony just cut in to whatever he was about to say with a swift slash of his hand.
The Avengers, who were all stood at the front of the crowd, slowly pulled out sheets of paper from their pockets, looking seriously at Tony as he flailed his hands in confusion, completely unaware of what they were going to have to discuss.
Steve looked scandalised. “But… but it’s Tony!” He said in confusion- like that was supposed to make people care.
“Bellissimo,” he breathed almost imperceptibly, eyes fixed on where his fingers were tracing, hardly even aware he was doing it, “così perfetta.” And Steve wasn’t fluent, but he knew a compliment when he saw it, and he smiled softly in response. Tony trailed his hand all the way down Steve’s neck, landing square on his chest, right over his heart.
“ I know you might think it’s weird and forward or whatever, but a) fuck the stereotypes, just as a matter of principle more than anything, and b)-” Tony’s hand tightened briefly around Steve’s as he shrugged in an attempt at nonchalance that, in Steve’s opinion, didn’t work out for him very well, “you shouldn’t be alone on your birthday, Steve. That just sucks. You… you deserve better than that. You deserve someone to be there with you.” He shrugged again, biting his lip, “and I know I’m not like, y’know, this Special Thing or whatever, and really you should have someone better here for you, but at the moment everyone else is asleep and-”
Steve, for once, was going to be selfish about this.
Tony considered the question, breathing through his nose as Bruce approached him, the knife glowing an ominous dark red. “I think it’s pur—”
Steve just shrugged and pulled his eyes back to DUM-E as he trundled backward, ball clutched in his claw. He opened his mouth to say something, but stopped when his brain picked up on something: DUM-E was rolling over to Tony. He was rolling over to Tony and was coming in at an angle that had him heading dangerously close to one of those live poles. Steve worked it out quickly in his head, analysing the trajectory and direction it would fall if DUM-E hit at a certain angle. He glanced at Tony, sat tangled up in a bunch of wires, back turned, unable to see.
“He’s upstairs,” she informed him, looking at him with a face full of tragedy, “Steve, I’m so—”
Looking behind him, he grinned fondly at the sight of Natasha and Clint bickering whilst Sam leaned back and watched with Carol at his shoulder, who’d walked up to them all just after Steve had gone. He’d got lucky with them and he knew it- he just had to remember it. Focus on it. It was easy to become lost in the tidal wave of grief, some days; but they were there for him and he had to hold that close.
Tony and Steve watching stars on the roof of the tower because the power is out all over NY from a battle??
“All attention is good attention,” Marley, his PR guy had told him, a tight smile on his face as he’d patted Tony’s shoulder, “the stock drop doesn’t matter, not in the big picture. Your name’s trending on twitter, and that’s exposure. The launch won’t be tainted by this.”
He looked half-dead.
Mrs Wilson gave them both an amused look, and Steve sighed. “He’s not… he’s not ‘
Steve glared at him. “That’s ridiculous. Of course we’re obligated, he’s our—”
Funny how used to him he’d gotten, even though they’d barely held more than two conversations.
of other spaces available.
Even as he said the words, he knew that a blush was beginning to creep across his face; could feel the heat as it tingled around his cheeks.
he breathed disbelievingly, “this is… this is so fucking cool. I can’t believe I got to marry you! How did I do that?” He asked, “God, I’m so fuckin’ lucky. Oh, hey- let’s have sex!”
“Multiple times,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes and a grin, ignoring the way it gave his cheek hell.
“TONY!” A light slap on the face pulled him back into the room, and he blinked wearily, hearing a moan fall from his lips. “Stay with us, Tones, you’re gonna be okay. We’ve got you.” That was Natasha again, sat between his legs and looking at him determinedly. She waved a hand behind her. “Rhodey, look around this hut, see if there’s anything useful here. Bruce, I have a blade tucked in my rucksack. Turn on that portable stove in the corner, see if there’s still gas in there. If not, we can rig up a fire.”
“You should sleep,” Steve said quietly, fingers gently sweeping Tony’s hair out of his face, “you’ve had a tough night.”
Steve did, and with one easy motion, he was stood up with Tony held up in his sturdy grip and making his way over to the stairs. Tony could hardly believe that about fifteen minutes ago he’d been convinced Steve would never even want to talk to him again, and now… well. They were going upstairs. To have sex. Were Tony not so busy sucking on Steve’s tongue, he might have cheered. This day had definitely been a rollercoaster, but it seemed to be ending on a high at the very least.
Steve shrugged. “Since coming outta the ice? Maybe… 5 or six times. I don’t know what triggers it- some months I just… don’t sleep. And it’s so- so- I’m just…”
Steve couldn’t help but grimace a little. He didn’t like Tony’s friends. They weren’t real- that much was obvious from the get-go. And Tony always wound himself tighter around them. They were just… bad.
Tony had seemed so positive he’d have a chance.  And that- the idea that there was someone who was so unwaveringly faithful in his ability to achieve something like that… it made him just want to try. Just see if he could prove Tony right, that he
Because that kind of proved things, didn’t it? These people weren’t paparazzi, they were obviously all buddies- family friends, it sounded like. Tony wasn’t trying to protect Steve from anything here.
There was a nudge against his mouth, and someone— Natasha, maybe—placed the rim of something against his bottom lip. Cool water trickled onto his tongue, and he drank gratefully, hearing her talk to him in soft Russian, a hand running back through his hair. She looked at him, and then glanced down to the watch on her wrist and smiled. “Two minutes ‘til Christmas,” she informed him, shuffling until her back was pressed up against the wall.
“Three. He got one off Nat as well, though.”
He pulled Steve further forward, and Steve just went gladly, letting his knees buckle as he fell into Tony’s lap and then pressed the side of his cheek into the other boy’s shoulder. Tony curled around him immediately; an embrace that screamed protection, whilst his hands just trailed soothingly over Steve’s spine.
“Tony?” Someone asked, and he looked up to see Bruce watching him, voice quiet as he added, “are you okay?”
“Tony,” Steve rocked him back and forth very gently, “Tony, that wasn’t your fault. Terrible things happen and they happen for reasons that we- we can’t understand, but it’s not because of us.”
Steve should have found him. He should have gone and just talked it through, not been afraid of the consequences or the yelling, he should have just gone—
In conclusion, the whole weekend had sucked.
Steve’s dog tags.
Beside him, Steve stilled, and Tony pressed the phone to his ear while Clint started to speak. “You gotta get back to the tower right now, both of you,” he said, before adding on to the end, “it’s Peter.”
He heard Natasha snort to his left and turned, a betrayed look on his face. She just flipped her choppy hair out of her face and then placed a hand on her heart. “Oh, yeah, definitely ‘just friends’. He just found you in the cafeteria on Monday because he was ‘hiding’, suuure. And your little tickling match thing on the bench right next to me? Suuuure, you’re just friends.”
“Tony?” Steve said dumbly, looking over to the bright red Ferrari and then to the boy himself when he got to his knees next to Steve’s side, “Tony, how the hell did you-“
“It’s a deal, Stark.”
He felt the vibrations through his fingers as evidence for Tony’s next laugh. “Nice to make your acquaintance, Steve Rogers,” he said, amusement obvious in his voice, “I’m Tony. Now do you mind telling me where you live?”
Bucky paused. And then snorted. “What, you think I’ve planned that far in advance? Steve, do you know me at all?”
Steve flinched like someone had physically hit him. For a second, it was all he could see in his mind’s eye, but he hastily forced it down before it could send him spiralling. It wouldn’t help them just then. “Even if they are close by, if we don’t follow their trail perfectly, we risk getting further and further apart,” he muttered, mostly to himself. “Thor’s probably right. We have to find backup, or at least get to a place where we can call for help.”
Of all the things he’d expected Steve to say, that certainly hadn’t been it.
“My influence,” Tony said proudly, puffing out his chest and then patting Steve’s chest.
“What are you doing?” Ty asked lightly, flicking his gaze down to Steve. He watched as the boy’s lip curled a little and resisted the urge to stand up and jump immediately into a confrontation. It was just a look- and he was Tony’s friend.
“Then don’t talk to me until they are.”
There was a heavy silence in the room, as everyone looked at one another. Tony observed Clint and Thor, both of whom were also sporting some injuries too. Clint had a cut bleeding its way down his forehead, and Thor’s eye was swelling up a little in the beginnings of a black eye. This, Tony suspected, hadn’t even been a proper hit. AIM had just been scouting, using the LMD’s to confirm what they were suspicious of. But if this was what they were sending for preliminary reports, then God only knew what they were gonna do next time.
- against his side.
But he didn’t have time to dwell on it. For now, he just had to stop them from getting their hands on any of the tech that was currently locked up in the storage facility down underground. That would be a nightmare.
"Right," he said tightly, "yeah, sure, we can deal with it for the night." He looked dubiously over to the bundled baby in Tony's arms, taking a deep breath and straightening his back. "How hard can it be?"
The reaction was immediate.
“So you don’t
She shrugged, picking at her nails like she always did when she was stressed, “Our imaginations went into overdrive. I may have helped him on that front, and that’s my fault. But I was worried, and Bucky was worried, and then we just sort of got caught in a spiral. It ended with Bucky convinced Tony was blackmailing you into sniffing five lines of coke and then going back to his mansion to have wild drug-fuelled sex.”
Jesus, Tony actually sounded
Without looking at the boy crying in Thor’s arms, Tony swallowed down the guilt and turned to walk away.
But there was no report. So Steve wasn’t wearing his suit.
Thor sighed again, and then pushed himself away from the table. “I should probably go after them,” he said with a huff, before adding mutinously “and stop my brother from getting suspended. Again.”
A hand curled around his waist, pulling him back from careering into the wall head-first, and Tony knew it was Steve’s grip as the man instinctively clutched Tony tight to his chest, preventing any further damage. He could see Bucky, already pushing back off the wall and firing another round down the hall, taking out the final two on the other side.
Steve stared down at their room in shock, coat dangling off his fingers as he got caught in the motion of throwing it over the chair. He looked around their bedroom- or at least, what was left of it, with a gaping mouth.
A massive warning sign started flashing behind Tony’s eyes.
Sam made another face, obviously not in the mood for discussion about the subject. Steve couldn't blame him- if he and Sam didn't finish the homework, they'd both be getting sixty-minute detentions. And no one wanted sixty-minute detentions with their math teacher, the guy was a fucking tyrant when it came to completion of work. Bucky might not have been going to their school, but the work he was having to do was pretty much the same thing, and so they’d agreed last night to all pile their brains together and try help one another out.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8… on and on and on, the steady thrum of a pulse against Tony’s ear. He’d started sleeping against Steve’s chest after that whole fiasco with the cardiac arrest, and the constant pulse was like a lullaby, helping him drift off with the knowledge Steve was safe. He was okay.
He made the decision that he was going to ask Steve to marry him on the third day of their getaway.
So when the damn thing started to go off at 3am, Steve definitely knew something was wrong. Or it’d better be, otherwise someone at SHIELD was going to fucking die.
Tony groaned theatrically again, but then winced as he felt the dull pain flare up in his chest. It was always difficult taking big breaths with the reactor- and it probably didn’t help that it was being squashed by Steve’s chest, but today it seemed a little more poignant than usual.
I know that there isnt much substance to this and that it's pretty short, but I just wanted to write something and get me back into the swing of the story seeing as it's been a while since I updated. So! Some more relationshippy fluff, and general wholesomeness. Savour it while you can. Shit's going to go down soon.
If they’d been good enough to take Steve Rogers out of action, then it begged the question as to where the hell they’d all disappeared to now. “Better?” He asked JARVIS expectantly.
Tony stopped then. Steve, being vaguely aware that what he’d just said was probably offensive, only sighed in resignation. He was fucking everything up. “I didn’t m-”
that would make Tony understand, even if it took all fucking night—but there just wasn’t time. Steve’s chances were gone; he’d screwed everything up,
He couldn’t help but feel a little triumphant.
hated Natasha.
Bucky huffed, but jumped off the counter all the same. He eyed Tony as he walked back into the living room, but didn’t say anything else. Sam followed a few seconds after, leaving Tony and Steve facing off on opposite sides of the kitchen.
Tony steeled himself as he grabbed Steve’s hand and stopped it from plunging straight into his face. This was not going to be pleasant. In fact, he was getting a rather uncomfortable sense of déjà vu from this shit, which wasn’t fun. But this time, Tony wasn’t reacting on an emotional level. And he had to admit, that changed the game a little.
“Oh Jesus,” Steve said, blinking rapidly as teacher pushed past him to disperse the crowds and get Ty to the nurse, “God, no, I gotta-“ he broke off and pushed past them, following the footsteps that Tony had been led off in and ignoring his friends’ protests as he left them guessing. He needed to find Tony.
he told himself as he rounded another corner,
He eyed them as they left together, talking and laughing amongst themselves. Peggy wandered up to his side, nudging him in the ribs until he sighed and turned to her. “Yes?” He asked, cocking his head in question like he didn’t already know exactly what Peggy was talking about.
Steve spluttered, watching in irritation as Bucky gave him a warning look and hovered his fingers over the keys. “Oh dear God, alright, I’m sorry… car.”
Still, Steve said nothing. He couldn’t. There was too much that he wanted to say, all of it clogging up in his throat and settling there like a noose. Eventually, Tony looked away again. Back to the wall. “Just the fact that I’ve told you has put your life in danger. But someone on the inside needs to know, just… just on the off-chance that you believe me. This is bigger than us. Bigger than me and my stupid life. Ask for a copy of the recording of this conversation, take it to Nick Fury and tell him to do some digging into Arnim Zola, Operation Paperclip. Most of my intel has led me to believe there’s something big hidden in Camp Leigh, but you’re not gonna be able to get in on an official basis; you’d have to have it done under the radar. I have no idea how many of your colleagues and superiors are marching to HYDRA’s fife instead of SHIELD’s, but it could be anyone.
He and Bucky had gone up the Empire State Building once, when they’d both been younger. Back then, Steve had been impressed- he’d felt like the tallest man in the world, looking down on the buildings and seeing the tops of them for the first time in his life.

Steve was a sure thing. These past few months, they’d just been a blip. A problem they could work through, the same they did with everything else. Steve’s words made no sense at all.
