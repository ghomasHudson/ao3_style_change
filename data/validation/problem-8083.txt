“I suppose not,” Steven admitted. “You would probably prefer something closer to the city anyway.”
“Anthony-“
“We have conquered great opposition before. Our people will find victory.”
Steven’s visits were like an oasis of tranquility in the midst of the madness. While they weren’t frequent, Steven made sure to stop by Anthony’s tent every time he made a trip to bring bread and other supplies to his brothers. Even if it was only an hour spent in conversation, it always left Anthony feeling lighter. Steven continued sending out his little hints, too, the brief touches and heated glances that revealed just how much he desired to further their relationship. It was only a matter of time before Anthony’s self-restraint crumbled. Perhaps when all of this was over… if Anthony was still alive and the Israelites were still free.
It's almost overwhelming to have Tony's full attention on oneself like Steve has right now. He loves to watch Tony focus on one of his gadgets. When it's on himself, Steve always feels important beyond words. Tony could do that to almost anybody but Steve is particularly sensitive towards his attention, maybe because he craves it so much. The blond colors deeply.
Tony strokes the brown hair back before setting him down on the ground. 'He still needs a lot of rest.', Tony evades just when the girls enter the living room, probably to get some refreshments.
Half an hour later they are back on the street but not before thanking Laura and Clint for watching the kids for the night. He wouldn't have had a mind for watching them last night.
'Can I get you something?', Steve asks when Tony makes no move to accompany them.
Tony swallows hard, turning around abruptly to face his friend. 'Steve, I..' He hesitates when he sees Steve's hopeful expression. Okay, maybe he does chicken out. He can't risk this. Having this friendship is better than spending day after day alone in his lab. So what if it breaks Tony's heart? He can love from afar. It's better for both of them. Someone as young and perfect as Steve doesn't need or want a burden like Tony in his life as more than a temporary friend. 'I want to get back at Barton for some prank. You interested?', he asks instead, putting on his best grin.
He shakes his head. 'You did everything you could. You are a hero, Tony.', Steve whispers, tears in his voice. He sniffles. 'I'm so glad you're here with me.'
For a long time none of them moves. Then Barnes nods once, looking at Tony out of the corner of his eye.
'They shot us down. I was injured, a branch had breached the armor.' He points down at his stomach where it is bandaged up. The wound is deep but the painkillers keep him from feeling anything. 'Hit nothing vital. Barnes must have been nearly unconscious by then. He was bleeding all over the floor, there was nothing I could do about it. He took the brunt of our impact. I got up from the ground, glad that we had put some distance between us. I helped Barnes to stand up as well, then dragged him in the general direction where I had seen a house. Probably their hideout but better than nothing. I hoped to find something there that could assist us. Anything. Maybe a radio or something else to boost the signal of the suit so that I could call for backup. It seemed to take forever to get there. I could hear them hunting us like dogs. Barnes looked bad, I- I found myself hoping he would pass out. I can't imagine in what pain he must have been there. Finally we reached that house, a big warehouse-like thing. I managed to blast one of the doors open and drag Barnes inside. The suit's power supplies failed partly so I had to pull him and my suit with me. I didn't want to leave him behind, told him so when he asked. I don't leave a teammate with those people. Apparently they had been waiting outside for us because no one seemed to be inside though that changed pretty quickly as they detected our traces to their main quarters.'
'If you ever need something you can come with me. I won't tell Steve.', he says, not looking at Barnes either. It's not without difficulty that Tony speaks as lighthearted as he does.
Surely.
Steven’s journey back out of the camp took longer than it had any right to. Admittedly, though, that likely had something to do with Anthony insisting on feeding him before he got back on the road and it was only proper to host a guest in his own tent. They spoke of many things as they ate finely roasted meat with bread. Even once they had finished eating, they remained lounging across the many rugs and cushions that decorated Anthony’s tent.
After Steven left once again, Anthony found himself torn between his attraction to Steven and what he knew to be the reality of the situation. He hardly knew Steven, and this was hardly the time or place for even a carnal dalliance, even
“You recently came into my father’s service playing your harp. I am King Howard’s son, Anthony.”
Steven gaped at the blade.
Anthony nodded easily.
“Your father is a great man,” he praised, “and he speaks of you fondly.”
Again, Steven’s eyes flickered toward Anthony. He wished he knew what the other man was thinking. He wished there was something he could do to
“I don’t like being handed things,” he said, a little too sharply in his anxiety. Then, in an attempt to soften the words, “but there is a perfectly serviceable trunk back in my tent you could set it down on, if you’d like. Unless you need to get to your brothers quickly, that is.”
“My king knows my skill and ability. This day I defy the ranks of Israel,” the man crowed. “Give me a man and let us fight each other!”
“Th-there is a man who says he can defeat Thanos!” the servant gasped out before Howard could even demand to know the reason for the interruption.
This was not something Anthony could have. This was not something Anthony could even be allowed to
Anthony didn’t know how to tell him that his fear of losing Steven outweighed his faith.
“Not really,” Steven demurred modestly, “but there are plenty of lions and bears that come after the sheep.”
“No? Then there’d be no one to get between them and the sheep. It’d be a bloodbath and they’d just keep coming back whenever they felt like it. Normally, that’s when I have to wrestle them a bit.”
Some more shit goes down later on in their story, including King Saul's madness making him jealous of David and trying to kill him, though Jonathon helps him escape. It was a very touching moment.
“It gives me a way to contribute,” Steven agreed. “And it’s also a good way for me to keep abreast of the latest news. I like knowing what’s going on.”
“Very well,” he said, never letting his gaze stray from Anthony’s. “You have my word that I will return with it soon, so as not to leave you inconvenienced by the loss. You will surely have need of it once the fighting starts.”
Anthony blustered.
pursue something, which he did his best to keep from considering, it would have to be after all of this with the Philistines was resolved. For now, the enemy threat definitely took priority. He could worry about himself and his fears of eternal loneliness later.
“My hospitality was given without any expectation of repayment, but thank you. You must know you are always welcome in my tent.”
“Egypt? Really?”
He swung off his horse and hit the ground running. Even if he hadn’t seen any blows land, he would not rest easy until he was able to check Steven over for injuries himself. Steven grinned as Anthony drew close, wrapping his arms around Anthony’s waist and lifting him into the air with a laugh, none of which was at
The leather of the horse’s reins bit painfully into Anthony’s palms with the tightness of his grip as he and the others drew back. He felt almost as though it were a physical struggle to guide his mount away from the two combatants. He wanted nothing more than to jump down and join Steven’s side, but doing such would be an act of war and spell a fate for the Israelite nation far worse than death. Anthony could not be responsible for that.
The slow simmering attraction that had been burning between them only grew hotter with the desire clear in Steven’s eyes.
“Steve-“
“My apologies, my King, but I must turn down your gracious offer to equip me. I cannot go in these, for I am not used to them. I must meet Thanos as myself.”
“Lions and bears. The sheep make easy prey, so I have to run predators off if they start getting too interested. A few smacks across the nose with a small rock is usually enough to deter them, but sometimes they can be rather stubborn and keep coming anyway.”
Steven’s eyes softened, as if he understood what was not being said.
The man laughed.
Steven threw himself to the side, rolling in the grass and springing back to his feet. He clasped his sling in one hand and had the other on his pouch of stones where it was tied to his belt. Thanos didn’t give him any time to recover, though, turning and charging at him once more with a great cry. Again, Steven dodged.
Anthony just gave him an unimpressed look.
Steven chuckled and held out the knife once more.
The smile that stole across Anthony’s face was soft.
Thanos fell.
Steven brightened immediately. Reaching into his pack, he pulled forth several carefully-wrapped bundles.
“Queen Maria is every bit the jewel she’s described to be,” he said with a fond smile. “She is elegant and upright and taught me everything I know about interacting with people in the court. And she is kind.” Or she had been. He did not speak of the careful distance she kept as Anthony grew older. “As for my time outside of my official duties, I greatly enjoy blacksmithing, though my father doesn’t approve. It’s messy work, but I’ll admit I’m entranced by almost any kind of metal work. I like having something to do with my hands.”
eyes went so wide upon spotting Anthony that he was afraid they might pop out. He sputtered out something unintelligible, probably an apology of some sort, already starting to sink onto his knees, but Anthony waved that nonsense off.
There were a million things Anthony could choose to say, coy teasing to expressions of admiration and gratitude. Anthony had spent too long running circles around what he really wanted, though.
Their gazes caught and held for a moment, just a scant bit too long to be considered appropriate, before Anthony broke the connection by looking away. He reached for the dagger at his belt, hoping the olive tan of his skin hid the way his cheeks burned. His heart pattered away, betraying his controlled expression as he drew his dagger to begin carving into the blocks. Surely Steven had not been about to bridge the space between them to press their lips together.
Something in Anthony’s chest warmed pleasantly.
The next morning, Howard announced to the camp that he was offering a great reward to any man who could defeat Thanos, and that he would offer the hand of one of his daughters in marriage on top of that.
A shout of pain startled them out of their moment and they whirled around to spot one of the Philistine leaders with a sword in hand. Howard clutched his own bloody arm, though the wound didn’t look terribly deep.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can be.”
“As you know, I have spent my entire life before entering your service tending my father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. I have killed both lion and bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of Yahweh. The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.”
Again, Steven seemed more amused than concerned as he began pulling off the armor pieces, the servants quickly coming forward to assist him.
“You can defeat him, then?”
Steven?” he blurted, incredulously. “The shepherd boy?”
Anthony had just left a meeting of the war council. The Philistine forces were approaching from Socoh, in Judah, set to arrive in less than a week, and they were numerous. Even with Yahweh on their side, it would be a hard-won fight and many men would fall, Anthony was sure of it. The council had decided that the Valley of Elah, where they were camped, would be a fitting location for the forces to meet and had begun to draw up the battle lines in preparation. Howard and Anthony had argued, but there was nothing unusual about that. Anthony had watched as the months passed and his father became more and more agitated and volatile. Sometimes, it was as if a dark spirit resided within him, taking control and making him lash out at any and everyone who was unfortunate enough to be around him. Steven’s music was one of the only things that could calm him.
Anthony willed himself to reach out and take it, to, for once, not let his weird, stupid quirk get in the way of things. He just… couldn’t quite manage it.
“Steven,” he cried, stepping away from the fire and into a tight hug, pulling Steven in close and squeezing, “you made it!”
After that, there were still discussions to be had with the war council on how to handle the rest of the Philistine nation. Their army was broken and scattered, yes, but there would surely still be resistance met as the Israelites moved through their land. If they did not want to lose more men, they would need to be prepared. Then there were the formal recognitions from Howard to those who had done great deeds during the battle, through which Anthony was expected to sit at his side. The last of these, the highest honor, went to Steven.
“It’s a deal,” he agreed. “Come back to me in one piece and my robe is yours.”
“Well, I can’t very well just let them eat the sheep, can I?”
… but yes. I tend my father’s sheep. Or, I did, and now I am again while this battle is on and my brothers have been called away. You’ve heard of me?”
“You really should have.” Anthony nudged him up so they could sit, not bothered at all as the blanket fell away to expose his modesty. “And there’s something else you should be expecting, too.”
Steven’s blue eyes darkened, not mistaking Anthony’s intent in the slightest.
“Neither was I,” he confessed. “Don’t worry yourself.”
“And yet I couldn’t rest easy until I made sure to get this back to you.”
Instead of dodging backwards or to the side as he had been, Steven pushed further into Thanos’s space on the next swing. For a heart-stopping moment, it looked as if the fight was over, as if Thanos was going to bring the pommel of his sword down on Steven’s skull to cave it in, but then Steven just…
Anthony stared at him for a long moment before a nigh-hysterical giggle bubbled up from within him. He let his head fall forward onto Steven’s shoulder and squeezed his eyes shut, if only to stave off the torrent of emotions. With his face pressed into silk, he didn’t dare cry. It’d ruin the fabric.
“Then bring him to me! Quickly!”
Steven’s smile was crooked and Anthony caught a twinkle of mischief in his eye.
He wasn’t sure quite what he expected. Most people of Steven’s station were prone to throwing themselves into the dirt at Anthony’s feet when they found out who he was, but Steven had already shown little to no reaction to his obvious wealth. What he hadn’t expected was for Steven’s grin to become even wider as his eyes flitted over Anthony’s form once again.
Anthony’s lips tugged upward at the corners. It didn’t escape his notice that Steven’s brothers were surely quite capable of guiding him back out of the camp.
“I’m so sorry!” the man he’d run into apologized immediately. “I wasn’t watching were I was going.”
“Anthony… You
“I should be so honored,” Steven said softly as he knelt beside Anthony.
“Hey,” Steven greeted softly.
“They’re numbers are great, just as our scouts indicated,” he said, hoping to keep the statement neutral enough to avoid his father’s unpredictable temper.
“Of course!”
The man smiled down at him for a long moment that stretched just a beat too long before seeming to realize that he was still holding onto Anthony’s arms and quickly releasing him. He coughed awkwardly as a red flush stole across his cheeks, visible even through his darker-blond beard. The distance between them gave Anthony a chance to look the man over. Unlike Anthony himself, he was dressed humbly in a rough-wool kethōneth shift that only fell to his knees, sleeveless to leave his muscular arms on display, and a similarly low-quality simlāh robe. A rough leather belt was wrapped around his waist. His sandals were of leather, too, and so caked in dirt that they nearly blended in with his skin. Odd. Their camp had been set for several days already. None of the troops should have been walking enough to amass so much dirt.
He waved a dismissive hand to indicate Steven’s traveling garb, still covered in dirt and dust from the road. Servants swarmed forward, following Howard’s cues and hustling Steven out of the tent. Anthony hastened to follow, hoping to catch a moment to be able to confront Steven about this insanity. He fell in beside him as the group made their way to Howard’s tent, which was not at all far from Anthony’s own.
If Anthony had been surprised by Steven’s appearance, it was nothing compared to his surprise at what he discovered in conversation with the man on their way to find his brothers. Despite his low-standing in society and lack of education, Steven was incredibly well-spoken and dedicated to the Lord. He was a brave man who lamented that he was not able to join the other men in battle instead of rejoicing that he was allowed to stay home in relative comfort.
“No, of course not. Prioritizing your own life over those of stock animals would be completely ridiculous.”
Steven’s smile didn’t diminish in the slightest and Anthony could feel his own stretching wider in response.
Steven let out a bark of surprised laughter, stifling himself by tucking his face into the crook of Anthony’s neck.
Still, a scowl spread over Howard’s face.
“Of course. It’s the least I can do, considering you kept me from getting dirt on my me’īl,” he agreed readily. It was a beautiful robe of woven silk that marked him for his high station, and he loved it dearly. He would have been devastated if it’d gotten ruined. “What is your family’s name? I’ll make sure you get to your brothers.”
One rotation, two, and Steven let it fly.
Anthony’s heart jumped in his chest.
He turned in that direction as if to urge his father’s compliance, but Howard didn’t move, eyes fixed in the distance still. His brow furrowed and eyes narrowed in an attempt to see more clearly.
, but certainly embellished by the rosy tint of fond memory. Surely, Steven’s eyes hadn’t been that stunningly blue. Surely, his words hadn’t been so honey-sweet that Anthony was left wanting to lick them right off his lips. Surely, the warmth between them had not burned so strongly.
Steven gaped at him.
to give his trust and concerns over, but it was a difficult thing for him to let go of. He was far more comfortable when he was able to be active and work toward a solution himself. Luckily, he didn’t have to scramble for any further conversation as he spotted the tent they’d been looking for up ahead. A large man in a black turban, rolled up so that none of the cloth hung down, even in the back, tended the fire out front.
“I’ve never worn armor before,” he confessed with a bit of a chuckle, as if they were only playing dress-up instead of preparing him to face a deathmatch with a giant. “It is much heavier than I imagined.”
“Excuse me,
“Very well, then. Let’s get you properly outfitted. I won’t have you going off to fight in your current state.”
Talking to Steven was easy, even effortless. He bore no hidden agenda nor abject ambitions so far as Anthony could tell. Well, except for being able to serve in the coming battle, of course. It was refreshing to speak with someone who had no regard for Anthony’s station and such a unique perspective on the issues faced by their people. A commoner saw things no royal would ever witness, simply by virtue that no one was putting on a show for their eyes.
Later, when Jonathon is killed in combat, David is so distraught by the news that he kills the messanger who tells him. He also adopts and raises Jonathon's crippled son as his own.
“I absolutely do,” he admitted, “so you better take extra good care of it.”
“You could always spend the night here,” Anthony offered, not truly expecting Steven to take him up on it. “I would be happy to host you in my tent and you could travel back home refreshed in the morning.”
Forty days after the arrival of the Philistines, nearly a month and a half since the start of the stalemate, things finally came to a head. Anthony was once again in council with his father when one of Howard’s servants came barging into the tent, disregarding any and all social protocol.
Anthony whirled back around, alarmed.
“If I might impose,” the man spoke again, drawing Anthony’s gaze back up to his face, “I am in sore need of direction. I just arrived from my father’s house with food for my brothers, but I haven’t been able to locate them among the ranks.”
He took several steps, bending this way and that to test the range of his movement. Anthony could see the discomfort in how Steven bore himself. Halfway through his circuit of the tent, he nearly tripped over his own feet and had to grab a trunk to keep himself from falling on his face. Frowning, Steven turned to address Howard.
“But King Howard is offering a reward to anyone who will face him?”
“I will make certain to.”
In Howard’s tent, the king instructed his servants to take Steven’s clothes and give him garments from Howard’s own wardrobe to replace them. A short cropped sādhīn, falling only to his lower thigh, and a kethōneth of much finer linen that someone of Steven’s station could ever hope to afford were provided in short order. Then came the armor. Bracers, greaves, a fine bronze helmet; Anthony didn’t know where Howard’s servants found them all, but they managed to procure enough armor that fit Steven’s frame to completely outfit him. Finally, Steven strapped a sword, one of Howard’s own, to his side.
Sharon, the leader of Howard’s guard, blew her battle horn.
“There.” Anthony pointed it out to Steven. “That is your family’s tent, I believe.”
Anthony pursed his lips, considering. If he were talking to a foreign dignitary or a member of the court, he would know exactly what to say, but he was no as sure-footed talking to Steven.
“Someone has left their camp.”
“And you, mine.”
Anthony could still remember the first time he laid eyes on Steven, even years later. His father, King Howard, had gone off to war with the Philistines, Anthony at his side. Steven was already in Howard’s service by then, playing the harp for Howard when he got into one of his
poorly. They were of the same rough-hewn fabric his usual garments were of. Anthony would have to fix that.
“I would like nothing more.”
His sling hung low from his hand, already heavy with a stone.
Yes. Definitely not the things a member of the court would have wanted to know. Except, perhaps, for the question about Anthony’s mother, but that would have been leading, looking for ways to gain her favor.
Anthony’s heart pounded in his chest, fear gripping him. In his darker moments, when he had thought about what would happen if he fell fighting Thanos, he had taken some small comfort in knowing that Steven would be safe. Even if Howard decided to break his word and attack the Philistines after Anthony’s death, Steven would be tending his father’s sheep and in no danger. He might end up enslaved, yes, but he would be alive, and Yahweh would deliver the Israelite nation in the end. The thought of Steven going up against Thanos, though…
their stations in life didn’t put miles between them. Not that there was anything set in stone just yet. There was only the possibility there, the ‘what if’ of a future not yet determined. Anthony knew his heart, knew how it yearned for intimacy and jumped at the smallest show of kindness and companionship from another.
Howard was grinning now as he clapped Steven on the shoulder, looking almost like his old self. Was this the effect Steven always had on him?
Several hours passed as they drifted on to other, less heartfelt topics, and yet it felt like it had been only minutes when Steven announced that he needed to be on his way.
Howard considered him for a long moment.
Anthony nodded.
Anthony startled.
“If only I could,” he lamented, “but someone must mind the sheep.”
For the first time, Anthony noted the pack that lay on the ground just behind the man, likely dropped when he’d reached out to keep Anthony from falling.
, Steven. Do you really think my father is just going to let you go back to your old life like nothing happened? You know the rewards you’ve been promised. What are you going to do? Go back to tending sheep with your tax exemption, grand fortune, and royal marriage?”
“Without the sword as well, I’m afraid. I have only the barest idea how to use one. I’d probably end up stabbing myself before I managed to land a hit on our foe.”
Steven seemed unfazed by Anthony’s completely legitimate defaming of his chosen defense system, just chuckling in amusement.
“I couldn’t! It is much too fine for a shepherd like me. You have already been more than generous enough.”
All of the anger drained from Howard’s face in an instant.
Anthony bit back the confession that he was not so sure Yahweh was still with his father. He didn’t know Steven that well, could not be assured that he wouldn’t run off and tell Howard of Anthony’s words or, worse, the people. Something about Steven’s openness and genuine nature as he spoke made Anthony feel comfortable with him, but that wasn’t enough to break through his entire upbringing of conscientious distrust. Still, he could see Steven becoming a trusted advisor if they had more time. No wonder Howard had become so immediately fond of him.
“Steven,” Howard greeted solemnly.
? That is not a weapon, Steven. That’s a toy.”
Once the fighting was over, the wounded tended to and the dead gathered, the Israelite encampment celebrated. A great feast was prepared, or at least as much of one as could be mustered from what was available. They would throw a proper one at the palace, once they returned, but the joy of their triumph could not be contained. The tension that had been brewing over the past weeks was finally released and the warriors throughout the encampment were glad for it.
“I don’t have any desire to be traveling these roads after dark. They are far too dangerous for a lone man with no weapon to defend himself.”
Steven gazed at him for a long moment before cupping the back of Anthony’s neck with one warm hand and pulling him closer to press their foreheads together.
“I don’t know,” he confessed, “but I will not let the tribes of Israel go quietly into the slavery we fought so hard to overcome.”
“Accompany me back to my tent?” he asked instead.
Which is why when Natasha sent him a text message with the information she used to create him a Tinder, he struggled to come to terms with what that even meant for him.
A small smile met Tony's lips as he stared down at Steve's laptop screen. "Probably." he replied, before beginning to type. "I mean, breaking into Shield's online database isn't exactly difficult, I'm sure I can re-set your password to something a little more memorable, if you'd like."
"I ran away to California when my mom died." Steve apparently had caught more of the previous conversation then Tony had hoped, but it would at least save him from having to relive all of the fine details himself, since Natasha was not one to back down. "I was searching for an escape, and that's when I met him, we were both incredibly young, I was a complete mess, and he was chaotic and beautiful."
Good intentions, Tony thought to himself, though made a note to circle back around to this. "Hey." Tony said clearing his throat. "Where are those two with our drinks."
"That's not -  What, Really?" Steve couldn't help his cringe, that just was not okay. Natasha was like a sister to him, he would protect her to the death, he did not need to be hearing this stuff.  He had no choice but to finally pocket his phone, having  read enough of the vulgar comments for one day. "We weren't even doing anything in the photo, so they just left those comments because you're a girl."
"Very reassuring." Tony smirked, before remembering about their audience, and turned his attention back to Steve's phone, which was still being held out in front of them. "Here you have it folks, proof that Steve Rogers is such a little shit, and I do sometimes have good ideas."
"You'll enjoy it." He insisted. "this is one of Steve's picks."
"Busy day?" Steve asks, glancing up over his Paper now, his cheek still warm from the press of Tony's lips. He'll never grow tired of that feeling he thinks.
That wasn't so bad, Tony thought to himself as he took a few experimental steps. So far, his legs were working fine, now he needed to find an exit. Carefully, or not - honestly Tony wouldn't really know how he looked - he moved around the bar, stepping around people until he found a hall, leading him past the bathrooms and behind a door labels EMPLOYEES ONLY. It was quieter in this room, and immediately Tony could feel his ears ringing, and knew he needed to go home.
Steve managed to click on something that brought him back to the photo of his own face. Under the caption were the comments. So many comments. "What have I done?" Steve is mostly asking himself, but it comes out to the entire room.
"Not Great." Steve admitted, pulling his phone out of his pocket. "There's only like three comments where someone is asking about our relationship, one of them is extremely homophobic." he glances up from his phone screen, realizing he has all eyes on him. "And it only got a few thousand likes, that's less than the one of my coffee."
Tony's fingers stuttered, and the screwdriver nearly tumbled out of his grasp. He managed to snatch it before it fell to the ground, before he glanced over at Steve. "Mad? I don't have anything to be mad about."
"What if I told you that you were one half of the reason?" Natasha drummed her fingers on the table top, inspecting Tony like she usually did when trying to decide whether or not he was telling the truth.
"You mean a Billion bucks right Pep?"
"She's going to murder you." Tony sing songs out as he makes sure the stream is done and closed before handing back Steve's phone, just in time for the elevator to come to the floor with a ding, and the doors to slide open revealing Pepper.
Barton rolls his eyes. 'As if you would notice, Stark.'
'Maybe you should finally talk to him.', she suggests as she had several times in the past weeks.
'Don't go, please.', Tony answers just as quietly, walking around the bed to his side. He had taken some pain killers but his head starts hurting nonetheless. Being alone is not what he wants right now. The bed is already warm, Tony needs to repress a shudder.
'Not particularly. You know me and hospitals aren't great friends.', Tony says, keeping his voice light.
Suddenly there is the loud squeaking noise of jammed brakes, then a dull thud. A crash that makes the whole yard flinch follows immediately thereafter. Steve had ducked on instinct, pulling Tony down with him. When he turns to see where the noise had come from, he immediately spots the car that had wrapped around a tree close to them, a figure lies not a few meters away from where apparently the gas tank of the car had exploded due to the crash and had set it on fire.
Tony's thoughts come to a standstill and despite the very comfortable position he feels wide awake for a moment. Then his mind quiets down. He hesitates, pushing his face closer to Steve's chest. Finally he nods once.
He rolls his eyes. 'What's so terrible about inviting him out? Just tell him you'd like a date or just drag him to your room and get to it.' Clint wriggles his eyebrows suggestively.
It's already afternoon before Tony brings the kids back to the Tower, after having went with them to lunch and some carnival. He knows Jarvis informed Steve of their return, the shadow looming near the kitchen when getting out of the elevator is just the last hint.
'Oh, please. What is fun about shooting arrows at a target?', Tony asks, voice full of boredom. He pokes at his food, looking like he is disgusted by its very existence. He had downed the coffee on the other hand as soon as he had had it in his hand.
'Sh, Stevie. I'm here, I'm fine.'
There is a deep sigh on the other end of the line. 'We both made mistakes last night..'
The inventor shakes his head, waving the concern off. 'I'm fine.' Steve looks like he highly doubts that. There is a timid knock on the door, then a doctor enters, interrupting the questioning for a moment. Steve raises to stand.
'I'll let you know that I am a genius.', he says loudly, cuddling closer to Steve in the process. The blond wraps his arm around Tony's midsection, pulling him closer.
When Tony enters their apartment he isn't in the least surprised to find Steve on the sofa, hunched over what must be at least a thousand pieces of paper. Steve still claims he can't read and concentrate when working with computer screens so Jarvis printed it all out for him, all the information SHIELD or Hydra had been storing away. The only surprise is that James isn't around to snoop. He usually likes to take a look at all the information he isn't supposed to have.
'I am really not in the mood, Legolas.', Tony grumbles, stepping inside though he doesn't really want to. He would like to get back on the road in an instance. Driving is easier than stopping and having to face reality.
'Thanks.', he says, appreciating the offer and that she doesn't pry any more on his problems and accept that he won't talk.

'This is crazy.', Tony eventually says. 'Just to be sure, you're..'
Tony pauses for a moment, gathering his thoughts. 'We never reached that hillside. Suddenly the hill was swarming with AIM agents. I could barely get my shields up before they started firing. They had.. weapons they didn't have before. The likes I have never seen before. I could feel the impact right through the armor.' Tony looks in the direction of his destroyed armor which rests in the corner. The blast holes are still clearly visible.
'If you want to talk though, you know where to find me.' Tony stops and looks back at Laura's back.
'Stop bashing Tony, Tasha.' Clint is sitting up now. He can't have possibly read her lips from his position. 'And come over and tell me about your day. That Tony is an ass we all know, now I want to hear all about what I am missing out on.'
'Captain Rogers asks if he should join you.', the AI answers not even thirty seconds later. At least Steve seems to have gotten the message.
'Well, I'll leave this particular hopeless case to you, Nat.', Clint says as he stands up, obviously just having come with her to enable her to get her hands on Steve's sketchbook. He tries not to let his friend's words touch him. Of course his case is hopeless. Tony is never going to return his feelings, no matter how much Steve wishes he would.
'Uh uh. Trouble in paradise? Those are details that I want, Stark.' Clint is now grinning like a giddy three year old, Tony's glare doesn't do a freaking thing about that. 'This is no way to treat me after asking us to watch your children.', he chastises him though his wide grin is ruining that for Barton.
The sun had already set when Tony climbs out of his lab to grab some dinner and look after his favorite super soldier. The latter had only been released from the hospital three weeks ago (an age, as Steve claimed repeatedly, almost too long to be remembered) and refused to be looked after for two and a half weeks. He is no child and not as gravely injured as everyone seemed to claim, Steve said whenever someone asked him how he is and if they could help somehow. Tony understood the wish to not be fussed about (though he isn't happy, he likes to fuss about his beloved husband), so he granted his husband the space he needs right now. After all, that's how he prefers it to heal alone as well.
"Steve." He says quietly after a few minutes, after allowing himself to fully enjoy the little slice of heaven he had been able to catch. "I have to go back to New York today."
At that the corner of Natasha's lips quirk just slightly. "What if it's not?"
"Nearly if I had to guess." Steve rolled his eyes, "But I'm sure he will be fine." He tossed the empty water bottle into the recycling, killing time and trying to come up with the right words. "It's just the drunkest I've ever seen him."
"Look, Steve." Maria started, shifting in her plush leather office chair. "All we're asking, is for you to get something, just,
"Okay." Pepper narrowed her eyes at the man. "What is it, what's wrong?"
"Oh fuck off." Natasha spoke, coming around Tony's shoulder, tired but smiling. "If anyone wouldn't be able to walk properly after a night with me, it's you."
Steve obviously noticed it all as well because Tony can hear him sigh along. "You guys can come in." Steve's voice is louder than it was five minutes ago, and Tony flinches at the way it makes his headache sad, but he'll learn to survive.
"How are you functioning right now?" Clint groaned to Natasha, as she very loudly dropped the plate of bacon in front of him, the dish against marble clattering sound sent Clint's head retreating into his arms.
Maybe a lot of things.
“Not forever.”
"Are you sure?" Tony huffed out, trying to catch his breath. "I've seen you work out I don't want to be a distraction."
Steve doesn't think he agrees, but with how happy Thor looks, he thinks it would be stupid to decline. He hadn't posted anything in a few days anyways, and a second picture would have to give some sort of hint, wouldn't it.
"It's my duty as boss of the bride." Tony says with a one shoulder shrug. "Besides I have't had a chance to even meet this illusive fiance of yours yet, I needed some place to do it, somewhere I could judge him and not feel bad about it, you know?"
"I just had a meeting with Pepper and Hill." Steve finds himself sighing, yet again as he leans over the stainless steel table.
Steve  shot a glare at Clint "I don't have to explain myself."
"Tony, I really like you too." Steve shrugged and then he waited. Waited for the moment to come back to Tony.
"Maybe I should kiss you." He's eager, and smiling his giant smile. "I am a great warrior Steven, it would make quite the point."
There was no reply from Tony and a quick look at the clock made Natasha realize she didn't have time for this. "Your self loathing is old." She reached up pressing a finger to her ear. "Someone send Pepper."
"I kissed Sam." Steve blurted, and then winced at how it came out, like a lover admitting a misstep, Tony's silence on the other side didn't help. "Tony?"
she quickly typed back, followed with '
"Bruce?" Steve finds himself asking, looking for one more hold out.
"Is this rich people slang?" Clint asked, clearly annoyed.
"I'm always honest." Tony blurted, as he reached over and placed his hand on Steve's thigh, for no other reason then to be touching him while he drove. "Drunk Tony just likes to talk." he nearly whispered that part, leaving over once again as far as the constrains of his seat belt would allow him, right into Steve's space.
Allowing the almost-occurrence to pass by without mention, they lounged across Anthony’s carpets and pillows and talked as they ate cheese with bread and dried fruits. Eventually, the conversation turned to the source of Anthony’s concern and stress.
“What do you want to know?”
It was over a week before Steven came to the camp again, only to find Anthony in the throes of his distress. Every morning, Thanos had crossed the field between the Israelite and Philistine camps to make his proclamation once more. No man among their forces wished to stand against him, no matter the reward Howard offered. It wasn’t a stalemate which could last forever, though, and Anthony had to find a way to fix it before things came to a head.
“Very well, then! If you spit upon your word, Israel will spit upon your corpses!” Howard roared in defiance.
By all that was holy, Steven’s smiles were something else.
“Perhaps,” Anthony allowed, wishing he could share in Steven’s optimism.
And yet, he couldn’t help but smile at the thought of the easy conversations that had flowed between them. Sure, Anthony had originally been attracted to Steven’s body, but his mind and personality had only drawn him in further. Anthony
“My brothers and I are the sons of Roger of Bethlehem,” he said, before boldly continuing. “I’m Steven.”
Thanos stumbled.
“I know.”
Anger twisted Thanos’s face and he spat at Steven’s feet.
Anthony nodded in understanding as he stood.
“Fight off a lot of bandits, then, do you?”
“It’s a lot of pressure. I can understand why it would make people nervous to step forward, though I think it would be an honor to fight for Israel. What will you do?”
Anthony’s jaw dropped.
“Very well, then at least take this with you.” He removed the dagger from his belt and held it out for Steven to take. “So you are not unarmed in case of bandits.”
“No. It looks like just a single individual. My horse!” Howard called to his attendant. “Bring me my horse!”
“I’ve made several trips to your encampment to bring supplies for my brothers, who are among your troops. As for what you’ve heard, I was merely asking questions and never made any such claims,” there was another flurry of murmuring, and Steven raised his voice to cut through them, “
“It is the finest make in all of Israel,” he told Steven seriously. “I will not send you into this combat unprepared. You are aware of the reward I have offered?”
On about the sixth rotation, Thanos sprang forward. He moved with a speed that belied his size, a speed he’d obviously been holding back on with his earlier feints. He crossed the space between them in an instant and Anthony’s breath caught in his throat as Thanos’s sword cleaved through the air, barely more than a blur.
Well, that didn’t sound like Steven was planning to cut his losses and make a run for it, at least.
Anthony nearly jumped forward to claim the right for himself, but Steven beat him to it. He swung down from his horse and stood tall before Thanos, though he could not hope to compare in terms of stature.
“I will fight you.”
“Go, and the Lord be with you,” Howard intoned.
Anthony awoke slowly the next morning, comfortable and warm, bare legs still tangled with Steven’s and a light blanket pulled over them both. Steven was already awake and greeted Anthony with a soft press of lips. His thumb ran gently across Anthony’s cheek.
“They’re attacking?” he exclaimed. “So soon?”
Anthony could see the grin once more lighting up Steven’s face as he sprinted as far away as he could in the time it took Thanos to turn.
And yet, here Steven was, looking every bit as handsome as Anthony remembered, smiling with what seemed to be genuine joy as he spotted Anthony down the row of tents and began jogging his way. As he drew to a halt just an arm’s reach away, Anthony couldn’t help but notice how his eyes sparkled in the sunlight.
things.
The Philistines had arrived just an hour past Steven’s departure and set up camp on a hill on the opposite end of the Valley of Elah. Anthony stood at the edge of the Israelite camp with his father and stared off into the distance at where they could just barely make out the movement of the opposing army settling in.
The Philistines wanted to negotiate now? After all that had brought them here? Anthony could scarcely believe it. Perhaps, though, they had not expected that Howard would really be willing to head to war. Or perhaps they had underestimated the force of Israel. He glanced at his father to gauge his reaction, but Howard remained stoic.
“Well, I’m not much of a
Anthony watched his face for several long moments. Again, he felt the urge to be completely honest with Steven in a way that would doubtlessly be considered inadvisable.
Anthony barely managed to track the stone as it sailed through it air, but it was impossible to miss the crunching sound as it impacted with Thanos’s forehead. For a long moment, all was quiet.
“A good man,” he praised. “Should you defeat Thanos, a small fortune shall be gifted to you from the royal family, and you and your father’s family will be exempt from the taxes of the Israelite nation. More than that, though, I will offer you the hand of one of my children in marriage.”
“So, you have time to join me for another meal, then?” Anthony asked hopefully.
“And I know,” Steven interrupted, “that we cannot be married in the eyes of our people, but… I would become one with you in Yahweh’s eyes. I would take an oath to bind our souls as one, without hesitation. Besides,” a small, hopefully smile broke across his face, “if we get married, it’d give me the perfect excuse to shower you with gifts. Cheese, for example, or perhaps an extremely fine robe imported from Egypt.”
This barely scratches the surface, but I think you get my point. XD
Steven pulled aside a bit of his simlāh robe to show Anthony the leather pouch attached to his belt.
“You called for me?”
, Anthony sent up a silent prayer as they set out across the valley.
Anthony snorted indelicately.
“I’m glad you’re alive,” he said instead, seizing on his courage while he still had it. “I can’t begin to say how terrified I was at the thought of you dying.”
Anthony bowed his head in supplication.
He placed them on a nearby chest instead of making any attempt to hand them over, and Anthony’s chest warmed at the gesture. It was a simple thing, and yet many forgot about his little quirk. Unable to resist the temptation of his curiosity, he knelt beside the chest to begin unwrapping the offerings.
“You lay the fate of your entire nation upon your shoulders? And your king agreed to this?”
“Whatever you would like me to. I haven’t met the queen before, what is she like? What do you do when you’re not in court? Have you gotten to travel much? I’ve always wanted to, but, well…” He gave a chagrined smile. “What’s your favorite place that you’ve visited?”
Steve doesn't let him finish. "It's been ten minutes." He says, looking down his nose and across the shop at the man. "I gave you ten when you asked for five, now please, get your ass -" he pats the cushion next to himself to make a point. "Here."
"It's not-" Now it was Steve's turn to start.
"So, you guys had a bad break up?" Clint asked, trying to fill in the blanks himself. "I Don't get what's so long about that."
He flicked through his phone as he started his shower, kicking off his boxer shorts as he did, last made phone call '2:47 am to Cap'. At least he had the bright idea to call someone with enough sense to get him home, safely. Steve was reliable - though sometimes a bit overbearing and a bit controlling, he always came through for his team and his friends, and Tony liked Steve, a lot.
"We're here with the Sam Wilson, Sam how does it feel to be dating a national icon?"
The first time Steve said it, it was an accident, It just slipped out like a bad joke, something that his brain should have filtered before ever letting his mouth utter it.
However Tony ended up having to pay for late check out, and their parting at the airport was quicker than either would have liked.
Steve just laughs, neither of them say goodbye.
Steve scratched his head, debating if it was even worth it at this point, but Tony smiled his stupid smile and all of his defenses fell. "I just wanted to turn it on." he pointed down to the various remotes. "I pressed the big red button on the big one but nothing happened, and then I noticed the other remote, and tried that one, but" he shrugged. "Look I know enough that you press the power button and it should turn on, but it didn't"
Steve dropped his head, his lips moving down Tony's neck as his hands continued to move, gently stretching and dragging. His teeth grazed against his pulse point and Tony's head fell back, his hips grinding down.
"Honestly no." Pepper admitted, a soft smile on her pink lips. "You lost me some time after running for mayor of flavor town? Which I don't even want to know what you mean, but generally your ideas are not good and you probably shouldn't."
Steve's eyes widen a fraction, before he's turning away from Tony and grabbing his beer again. "You're not dating Pepper." he says, though Tony can barely hear him he knows it's not a question.
"I am." Tony replies with a smile. "I'll fill you in when you get back, consider it an incentive for you to return, now if you'll excuse me I have to get back to a hotel and pack before I miss my flight and Pepper murders me."
"She's totally bluffing." Clint narrowed his eyes at the red head, who's face didn't even crack in return, instead she plainly motioned for the archer to make another bet.
"No." He shook his head, finally allowing his eyes to meet with hers. "I screwed it up with everyone I've ever loved, you know that."
"I have to go back to the hotel room." Tony quickly blurted. "I forgot something, I just, I have to.." He stumbled out his lame excuse, taking a step back, with every word, one step closer to escaping. "I will be back, okay, right I'll be.." he waved his hand and before he could even finish he was turned on his heel and was hightailing it out of there, through the people and right out the doors of the restaurant.
"Tony, wait please-" Steve's voice was breathless as it caught up to him.
"Can I think about it?" Steve knows it's pointless to ask, but Pepper smiles and Maria nods. They're just placating him, but he's too proud to admit they've won, just yet, and escapes as quickly as he can.
Tony decides to let it be business as usual, sure he had lost the friend zone, been demoted back to acquaintance, and that was if he was being nice to himself, but he still held on hope that the glances Steve gave him were out of mutual longing and not disgust. He prides himself on not being alone with Steve either way though, now he was doing the ducking out of rooms and taking the stairs. Tony fucking hates the stairs, but it just isn't worth the risk.
"What do you want?" Tony asked as he pulled the door open, of course it was Steve, and he had no time for small talk.
Tony never did consider that one day he would be teaching someone how to use a remote control, but here he was, and it had worked. However he was already envisioning a new and improved remote - a sort of all in one system.
"I'm just afraid." Natasha's voice drops to a whisper, like she's afraid to say the words out loud. "I'm afraid that once we're married everything will change."
"Because." He says exhaling. "I don't think I would survive him a second time." That was the truth, he almost died the first time, if his heart were to break a second time, his entire life would be in shambles. "Besides he's got a life here, I have a life in New York, I don't even know if we'd work anymore."
"See." Natasha says again, simply, proving yet another one of her points, again, Tony didn't get it.
"You do not look any more tan than the day you left Romanov." Tony couldn't help the smile that spread over his face when he saw her, it had only been two weeks but he had missed her - even when distracted missing Steve.
"You're so dramatic." Steve rolled his eyes, pulling open the door and stepping inside. "It's a workshop."
Without much explanation, she crawled into his king size bed, and curled herself around a pillow, hugging it tight against her chest. Tony stood at the foot of the bed watching her. He glanced at the television, playing infomercials, and then looked back to the red head in his bed, this didn't feel like a dream.  She was wearing a pair of sweat pants and a T-shirt that was three sizes too big for her, Bucky's, he would guess, either way she didn't look like she was out on a social visit.
There was an awkward clap and a full out wolf whistle from Clint - of course it was Clint.
Captain America, which was ridiculous, because he
He barely even noticed when Natasha pulled the chair out from the other side of the table and dropped herself down.
For the most part everyone eats in silence, eventually Clint even comes up for air to grab some more bacon and a slice of toast. Tony can't help but think how domestic it all is as he eats his breakfast, sandwiched at the kitchen island between Sharon and Natasha. There's a few quiet comments about the excitement for tomorrow, for the big day. Natasha mentions how the girls, including Clint, have to start getting ready at 9 am tomorrow, so they shouldn't be having any late nights.
Team building, Steve thought. Always good to touch base with a teammate, with your friends and make sure they're doing okay.
"Oh, ho ho-" This did get Clint's attention, as he turned on his cushion to look up at Steve from over his shoulder. "What did you have in mind Cap?"
definitely happened though."
"No." Natasha shook her head "No, you leave and then Steve run's after you, and then he comes back like some kicked puppy and now you're avoiding the issue no."  She placed her hands on her hips, and for the first time that night, Tony noted how lovely she looked in her off white cocktail dress, and really felt like an ass for making this night about him. "I don't want this to be a weird thing all weekend, can someone please just explain to me what is going on."
Tony doesn't know how long they stay like that together, but he doesn't really care. The night is winding down and the slow hits keep coming, so they just keep moving. He can't remember the last time he felt this kind of warmth, it's nearly overwhelming, nearly too much for his system to handle. Tony wonders if it's possible to overdose on good feelings, and perhaps begins to understand the meaning of love drunk a bit more than he ever thought he would.
Steve tilted his head, he knew Tony better than this, he knew something was bothering him. He knew that communication wasn't always Tony's strong suit, and he knew that something hadn't been right for most of the morning. "That wasn't a no." He stated simply.
Steve would laugh if he wasn't feeling mortified perched on the edge of the futon.
"Yeah but you can't." Tony cut in. "Trust me, time travel is a beast of an egg, not likely to be cracked any time soon, don't even get me started." he sighed again "If we were going to be together, then we'd already be together, and we're not so I think we have to just let it go, let the past stay where it belongs, the past."
The party had shifted back inside at some point, as someone had recommended Karaoke, and Tony distinctly remembers saying that it would be a terrible idea, but Clint insisted and in they went. Sometime in that shift, Steve went missing, which was fine. Really, Tony wasn't bothered by that at all.
"It's fine Tony.' He wasn't sure but he would bet 100 dollars right then and there that Steve was smiling, he could hear it in his voice. It was unmistakable Even drunk, Tony could pick up on those things. "I'm on my way."
"He did eventually say hello." Steve says after chewing and swallowing his food. "It just happened the next morning."
"I think you do-" Sam laughed as he plopped himself into an armchair, crossing his ankles on top of the coffee table. "Were you late because you came from a date?"
"Sounds like we're good to go then." Natasha says, stacking some plates on to the island, this time softer than the bacon plate, so that they group can start dishing up.
"Hey Babe." he replied instead, dipping down and placing a kiss to Steve's lips, before moving to take up the space on the couch near Steve's bare feet. "How was your day?" he asked, nudging Steve's legs to stretch out over his lap.
"Saucy." Tony smirked along with Steve, before moving his hands to one of Steve's bare feet, pressing his thumbs into the pad and massaging it gently, appreciating the curl of toes he got in return.
"Shouldn't you not be checking your phone while working?" Steve replies dryly as he puts a plate into the microwave.
"Oh Boy." Natasha said into her plate.
"Definitely No." Pepper turned to face him straight on as if scolding a puppy. "I already had to move around all these meetings so that you could take the time off, I just can't swing it. I'll send a very expensive gift okay?"
"What?" Tony asks pushing himself up as well, but she was already crawling over him and grabbing his cell phone from the bedside table, not bothering to give him a worded answer.
Steve looks up at him, now that they've split apart, his eyes are black, and heavy lidded, and Tony can feel his entire body burn under their gaze. He decides to finish unbuttoning his own shirt, letting it slide off his shoulders and onto the floor behind him, noting how Steve's eyes widen at the action. Cautiously, Tony's hands drop to his own belt, Steve's eyes follow, slowly he unclasps the belt, before thumbing open the top of his pants.
Tony looked to Steve confused, how would he possibly know anything about his security team. Steve glanced to Natasha and then sighed.
"I know." She said. And she did know. She had picked him up, literally and figuratively after the break up. She had seen firsthand the effect he had on Tony. "I think you're going to have to talk to him."
The new world would probably never stop surprising him.
"Does she run?" Tony found himself asking as he stepped towards the bike. Steve had pined over that bike while they were together, he would practically drool if he saw a picture of one, it had something to do with Steve's grandfather having one. It got sold when he died so his mother could afford the rent of the Brooklyn apartment they lived in, Steve said he would have rather lived on the street if it meant he could keep the bike. Tony remembers telling him to just buy one, the problem being they were nearly impossible to find, and when they did find one Steve would make excuses as to why it wasn't the right time. Like he was afraid to actually own what he had wanted so badly for so long. Tony had told him he would need to take a leap of faith or shut up about the damn thing.
Tony huffed out a laugh, slightly picking back up some speed on the treadmill. "Some of us have to work out, we're not all scientifically shaped like a God."
When he looks down, Steve is staring at him, intent and serious, full of concern, and uses his clean hand to wipe away the tears on Tony's other cheek, before pressing a kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth. "I love you too." He whispers softly. "I've loved you always, and will love you forever."
"Demanding." Tony laughs, but he doesn't argue, he can't, not when it comes to Steve. So instead he slides off his chair, to go towards where he had been beckoned too. "What do you need me over here for that's so important?"
"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Steve asked coming around the side of the work table.
"I'm sorry I didn't pick you up from the airport." Tony mumbled into the kiss.
"Say goodnight Steve!" Tony shouts, with a laugh, ripping the phone out of Steve's hand to end the stream before Captain America threatens half a million people in real time.
"Admitting I was jealous of Clint would be far more painful." Steve admits, bowing his head in defeat, but Tony just laughs, and lets his head rest on Steve's shoulders as they continue to move with the steady beat.
Tony nodded as earnestly as he could, trying to act like he was seriously considering his possible problem. "I think I can handle that, I have a very robust security team."
“Steve?”
Clint opened his mouth, to do what Tony wasn't sure, but before he could Bucky quickly rose to his feet. "Drinks. We need another round of drinks, Clint come help me get the drinks."
"This is not the first time we've had protesters." Tony says with a halfhearted shrug. "Remember when I stopped manufacturing weapons?"
He left his screen open, as the notifications flooded in, and tried his best not to notice as he sipped his morning coffee, and enjoyed the view of the city beneath the large windows. It wasn't right to feel proud about how many likes something got, right?
"Hey there, Cap." Tony greeted, not even bothering to look up from his tablet, as if he knew that Steve had been standing there the entire time.
He could feel Steve trace shapes out along his back and side, knowing his fingers would be leaving traces of black, but it was okay. It was always okay with Steve, Tony hadn't felt so relaxed in his entire life, than when he was wrapped in Steve's arms. It had all been worth it, all the waiting, all the late night phone calls, and middle of the day text chains. The long drawn out conversations, about their past, and what the hell they were even doing. The talks about their future, how much had changed yet how some things could just feel all the same. All of it was worth it to Tony, to get Steve back to him.
of Tony, alone in the privacy of his own room.
Thankfully, Steve let the comment slide without any verbal notice, though the disappointing look he got was enough. "They both got clip on ties, for some reason mine came to me like this." He explained. "I was just hoping someone would know how."
"You did." Tony found himself agreeing. "But I didn't deserve that."
"You're home now and I am here, I will always be here, and I will fix you."
Steve's eyes widened, and then he looked away, and Tony remembered that look, Steve didn't want to answer the question. Because Tony already knew the answer.
Tony wanted to look Steve in the eye, but his glance fell directly to Steve's lips. If he just moved an inch he could catch them with his own. "How what was possible?" he asked instead, a weak attempt to keep himself distracted.
"I can't really remember it all, just parts of it." Tony rubbed his forehead. "I honestly can't remember most of the night, just fragments keep coming back to me and they're all bad, Rhodey like sober me would be embarrassed to say to them, bad."
"How about we do lunch tomorrow." Tony said, not even trying to hide the grin breaking out over his face. "Dinner can be our second date, if you've got time?"
Pepper ran her hands over Tony's shoulders one last time "Like a million bucks-"
"We can't find Natasha." Clint said lowering his hand, as he had been the one to do all the knocking. "Have you seen her?"
At that Tony frowned. "Well duh, have you seen yourself Steve?"
"Just help me." Tony nearly wined, brushing a hand over the front of his black button up."Did you get the photo yet?"
"What?" Natasha's eyebrows knotted as she looked from Tony to Steve and back again "Tony what's going on?"
Yet still, here he sat across from Maria Hill and Pepper Potts, both looking at him expectantly, both waiting for him to agree with them. Both waiting for Steve to cave.
"You look fine." Pepper sighed shaking her head, while Natasha just laughed.
"I know." Tony replied, a sad smile playing on his lips. "I don't want to spend this weekend arguing with you though. Natasha doesn't deserve that. So I think it's best if we just admit we're better off apart."
"Two times in under five minutes." Steve quirked, forcing Tony to look up at his face "That has got to be a new record, even for you."
Steve can't help the laugh that escapes him as he presses the shutter button. It's ridiculous. There's literally smoking drones behind them, and Steve looks like he needs a shower.
"I have to go in to town in a bit." Steve says from where's he's standing, or leaning, against the kitchen sink with his breakfast plate in hand. "If you wanted a ride back to the hotel Tony? Saves you a cab."
"If you had asked I could have paid." Tony says, holding his arm out to prevent the doors from closing before Natasha had a chance to get inside. "You could be getting ready to fly out to Italy, or the Maldives, or anywhere but Vermont."
"Tony!" Natasha exclaimed, as soon as she laid eyes on him, a smile pulling over her face. She was wearing a headband with a veil attached to it, and had a glass of wine in her hand already, James standing beside her had a sash on that read Groom in bright pink sparkle letters, and just the sight of the two of them made Tony smile back.
Tony eyed the mini fridge, wondering if it was worth round two when there was a soft knock at his door. He didn't want to answer it, he didn't even want to check who was behind it, but the knocking came again, and with the heat of the vodka still warming his chest, he figured the week couldn't get any worse.
"I thought Tony  had advised you against reading the comments." Natasha replied as she followed Steve off of the elevator and headed into the kitchen, getting to work on her usual after sparring protein shake.
"What are you talking about?" Steve grabs his phone back from Tony to look for himself, only he didn't really know what he was looking at. Notifications the words in the top of the window told him, but it just kept loading, new messages coming in. New Follows, and likes.
"No." Steve shook his head. "She doesn't know anything, none of them do."
So instead Tony dropped his eyes to Steve's hands, one holding Sam's jacket, one holding something else. "What have you got there?" Tony asked, eyeing the small strip of black fabric tightly held in one of Steve's hands.
, sitting in the middle of Tony's workshop.
"Catch you later?" Steve asks leaning in for a quick peck and all Tony can do is nod as he watches Steve slip through the door and disappear from him once more.
Bruce cautiously sitting beside him, hands wrapped around a steaming mug that smelled of mint and berries, glasses pushed up into his hair, intently watching the screen even if he'd never admit to enjoying the adrenaline filled movies.
"Sources have confirmed that the man in the picture with Captain America is none other than Sam Wilson-" The blonde woman on the most recent news outlet said into the camera.
"You know that I love you, right?"
"There was." Tony said taking a step back, "Speaking of reasons, Steve I think you need to meet the other great Love of my life."
The stranger looked down at himself, and then the blue eyes, now less confused and more concerned looked back up at Tony. "I'm sorry, but again, what?"
"Jane's friend mentioned that you have a social media account." Thor's hammer dangles almost delicately from his fingers as he speaks, head tilting like he's trying hard to think of the right words. "And that you've recently posted a photograph with Clint."
There was a hint of a sigh in Tony's words as he spoke, but Steve knew to ignore it, after all Tony was currently doing him a favor, now was not the time to start one of their famous arguments. "Your phone uses something called the cloud to sort of, back up your phones information." Tony chose his words carefully as he explained just how the cloud worked, but he didn't bother dumbing it down too much, and honestly, Steve was thankful for that.
"Apparently Vermont is out of roses." Clint rolled his eyes, holding up one of the lilies for Tony. "Please help me, do you think we can dye these all red before tomorrow?"
"I didn't think you'd want to hear from me." Steve admitted lamely. "I was young and stupid, and I ran away because I was scared. I don't expect you to forgive me Tony but I need you to know how sorry I am."
"By looking taller in a photograph?" Pepper chuckled. "I think you look good, even on your toes. Where's this dinner?"
"You." Rhodey laughed. "Now what do you want?"
"Fucking told you." Cling explained before getting up to grab the shot glasses.
"Shut up." Tony rolled his eyes, trying to ignoring the laughter from his friend. "I was trying to give you the whole picture."
Tony debates sending another text, but he can hear footsteps in the grass getting closer to him, and he just knows that it's Steve. So he slides his phone into his breast pocket and waits.
Tony's eyebrows raised as quickly as his eyed widened and then he chuckled, shaking his head and looking back down at the report he really had to finish. It really wasn't his fault that the emailed reports were getting later and later - distraction was a real issue - but Fury had had enough and now they had to complete it manually, a nice team bonding punishment apparently. He really needed to focus, but he really wasn't going to be able to after that inquiry. "I didn't realize you were on the market, Cap."
After breakfast, he finds himself scrolling Instagram once again, stumbling upon a photo Tony posted that morning.
But from what Steve had read about the man - some true, mostly not, at least not the bad things, much to Steve's Surprise - he was incredibly smart, generous, and a lot more kind than Steve could have ever imagined.
No matter how many times Tony analyzed it, it was what it was. Feelings, falling for him - it was ridiculous. Sex less times than a person can count on one hand does not end in love, and that's when Tony realizes that this has been in the works long before their first time. These feelings have been brewing since the battle of New York, that over time Tony's been pining for Steve and that first night together, that just opened the flood gates.
He let out another sigh as he flicked back through his hangers, there had to be something in there he didn't already try. His fingers stopped on a shirt, plaid in different shades of blue. A girl once told him that the color blue really made his eyes pop, and Tony
Steve took a breath and then leveled with the brunette sitting across from him. "Tony, do you want to be my boyfriend?"
"Jay?" He groaned into his pillows.
than everyone but
Clint waves her off with a half eaten strip of bacon, still not bothering to sit up at the island.
"What are you working on?" Steve asked, trying to shrug off the awkward feeling that was spreading between them. "I'm surprised you're not upstairs."
"Please do." Steve said, a smile spreading across his face.
"Twitter." Maria deadpans.
"No." The answer surprised Tony as soon as he said it out loud. "I promised Natasha I would stay. Can you believe she had no idea, no one did. He didn't tell any of his friends." tossing back the tiny bottle of vodka in two gulps before he continued. "I don't know what I'm going to do Pepper, I can't even look at him without feeling completely overwhelmed."
"Too much I think." Tony hummed before he was pushing himself away from his desk, and checking his wrist watch. "Come on Romanov, it's way too late why are you still here anyways?"
Once the ceremony wrapped, Tony found himself hanging around, while everyone else made their way to the barn, and the wedding party and family made their way off to get photographs taken, Tony stayed where he was, and admired the summer day. His phone vibrated, it was Pepper replying to the photo of Natasha.
"I'm afraid that I'm still in love with him." Tony admitted. "I don't want to find out Pepper, I don't want to go through that again. I don't think I'd survive that again."
It doesn't take long for Steve to end up back on Instagram. This time, however he goes to Tony's profile. The last photo posted is one of the Iron Man Suits. It's half the traditional red and gold, and half silver.
"Yes." Tony said matter of fact. "I need to know, after all this time I need to know Steve."
"Your shirt is white." Steve sighed, and Tony could hear him trying to figure out what to do.
Unfortunately, however, his phone was acting up, the tiny little brick of glass and light metals was malfunctioning and he had no exposure to refer to. Steve had tried to ignore the little red bubbles that popped up over his applications, but they he started getting little messages about cloud space, and his head just couldn't quire wrap around why a phone would be trying to warm him about the space in a
Steve does his best to pretend he doesn't notice, because it's clear Tony doesn't want to stop, but he doesn't want to be caught
"Jarvis!" Steve called instead, when he knew that Tony could not hear him. The music cut out almost instantly, and it forced Tony to shoot straight, glancing at the door, and Steve standing in front of it.
Steve didn't even notice him, he could have come and gone without even the slightest detection. But, to be fair, Steve wouldn't have noticed anyone enter the room, not with the way he was so intently shooting daggers with his eyes at the television and grumbling to himself. It was an odd situation, and normally Tony tried to avoid those, but something was wrong, and he just couldn't let it be. No matter how much he wanted to.
It's much later in to the night, the sun has finally set, and the soft music is playing, when Steve asks Tony to dance. He wants to say no, having a perfectly content time sitting at the table and trading jabs with Clint - who very much has become his new favorite - but Steve's smiling down at him so sweetly with his hand extended and he has to take it.
"Okay, that's not fair." Steve argues, although somewhat lamely. "They do realize I was born in the twenties right? I'm supposed to be out of touch, at least a little, right?"
Steve scrubbed a hand over his face as the Instagram photo from that morning, the one causing all the problem came onto the television next.
"Got it." Steve replied, his attention on the newscaster on the screen. All this trouble just to watch the news, maybe Tony wasn't too far off his his comparison, Steve never did have good luck with girls in his time, it would only make sense that this be his luck in the future.
Tony eyed Clint for a second wondering how serious he was, but his face didn't give a hint away, and he figured he should just suck it up and do this one favor, the last thing he needed was Natasha freaking out, again. "Fine." He said stepping back into his hotel room.
Maria had come two years later. They are Tony's pride and joy. He wouldn't want to miss a single second with them. He can hear her play outside with Lila, she probably hadn't heard her brother shout. They are quite opposites. She loves to do science with her Daddy, James loves to go to art galleries with his Papa. Maria had already decided that she wants to become a bio engineer, if just because she found out that there are no real life unicorns. Tony couldn't be prouder.
Tony hides his face against his chest, breathes in the familiar scent. Already he can feel the sleep pulling at his eyelids. The familiar pose lulls him to sleep faster than he would have thought possible. It could be the lack of sleep that had accumulated in the last weeks.
'Nah, I can't sleep anyway. And I can think better when some mindless creature listens to me when I am brilliant. That's what I've got Dum-E for but you will do well, too.', Tony assures him as he settles in the chair, getting ready to stay till near morning.
Tony grins, leaning on the workbench with his hip. 'Sure. I'm almost done here. If you give me five minutes, I'll meet you in the gym.'
'I-' Steve stops, unsure how to continue.
The boy chews on his bottom lip. 'Are you getting a divorce like Peter's parents?'
No, but it is just like Tony to hide in his workshop until it all had blown over, Steve thinks sadly. He hates seeing someone else getting hurt but he doesn't know how to deal with these emotions. That is just like Tony to distract himself with a gadget until the unchangeable fact that Clint would be deaf would not be so crushing anymore.
When Steve climbs into Tasha's car alone, she raises an eyebrow but doesn't say a thing about Tony's absence. She must have already counted on it. Steve knows what exactly she thinks about his relationship with Tony. They pick up Thor on the way who isn't so quiet about the missing of the genius.
'Where are you going?', Steve asks stupefied.
'And you want to help Barnes, I know.' It's the first time Tony even acknowledges what their fight had been about. It doesn't feel as bad as he thought it would. 'I understand. God knows, if it would be Rhodey.. But I can't..' Tony sighs.
Still, this arrangement had been made between them in the very beginning of their relationship. No matter how bad the fighting between them gets, they are sleeping in the same bed, no hiding behind a punching bag or Dum-E in the middle of the night. It's just never lasted that long.
Tony spins around, that infuriating archer already half forgotten. 'Something like that.', he says, distracted as he is by Steve's tight shirt and his gorgeous smile. It should be illegal to be that hot and adorable at the same time. '
'No, Sir. The memory of the Mark 52 has been compromised. I can try to piece some of the information together but I am afraid it will not be complete.', the AI informs his master. 'I have footage of everything up to the moment in which you crossed the veil.'
The blond however seems to accept that for now. Maybe it wouldn't be real then for some time. 'Wh-what did he die off?'
Steve feels sorry for Clint when he knows he shouldn't. The hobby archer doesn't need pity, he needs support in this situation. Thor and Steve leave Clint and Tasha alone for a while soon after that, getting a coffee. Steve feels helpless and wishes Tony would be at his side. That's not something Tony can do though. So they wait in comfortable silence for Tasha who is just as distressed about the situation as Clint is.
'Nope.'
'I came so close to losing you today.', Steve whispers in the dark. Tony can barely make out his form in the bed. 'I don't know what I would have done. Losing Bucky again is hard, I haven't really processed it all. But if it would have been you..' He can hear the tears though Tony doesn't see them.
'Uh, am I in trouble?', Tony wants to know, a smile playing around the edges of his mouth. He hands Butterfingers his welder, turning fully to his boyfriend.
Suddenly he stops dead on his tracks. One of the targets hits his head not five seconds later but he doesn't care for it. That's it. 'Jarvis, pause program and call Natasha.'
'I also gotta go. Tony, you coming?', Steve asks in an attempt to salvage the situation. Tony nods, ignoring Tasha and stands up, bidding Thor and Bruce goodbye.
He sits on a bench but doesn't come any closer. It's better like this. One of the other parents might get a fit and call the police to arrest him as a threat for their children.
'Morning, Laura.', he says as calmly as he can. Trying to get his emotions under control is a lost cause, however, he can't face the kids like this. The woman in question smiles across her shoulder but doesn't turn from her chopping.
The guards are no problem whatsoever. After they recognize who is standing in front of them, they open the doors for him and wish him a pleasant evening and a speedy recovery for whoever he is visiting. He rolls his eyes once he is past them.
Steve had noticed how he slipped the tablet from Clint's bed. Tasha shakes her head. 'Is this your work?', she wants to know, mistrusting Tony as always.
Natasha puts a hand on Tony's shoulder, startling the man. 'You've done everything you could. It's not your fault.' Tony nods, not really taking in her words. He must look broken if even Romanov tries to cheer him up. Probably they all think of his selfdestructive behavior in the past and of the blame he always places on himself.
Tony stumbles against the doorway in shock. 'What? No. No. No, no, no. No divorce.' It sounds like he wants to convince both of them. He goes back to James' bed and sits down next to the kid, stroking his hair. 'Listen, you're Papa and I had a disagreement, but that doesn't mean that we will get a divorce.', he clarifies again, just to make sure James understood him. He pulls the blanket down by a fraction.
The music is quietening as Jarvis alerts Tony to Steve's presence. 'Hello.' It doesn't sound as cheerful as Steve usually is. His stomach is in a turmoil.
Tony still speaks with Bruce, completely ignoring Clint and his side of the table when he and Steve sit down and Steve hands him his sandwich and coffee. Tony accepts it with the smallest smile, one Steve is sure is invisible to the others. He chats with Clint about the latest series the other man had dug out for them to watch, and with Tasha about her new job as a ballet teacher in a local school, a side job she had taken until she finishes her studies. Lunch passes more quickly than Steve would have liked, mentally he already prepares for his afternoon lectures. So when Clint brings his and Tasha's tray away, he prepares to get up as well to accompany Tony to the perimeter and say him goodbye.
'Sure.' Tony turns away from Steve for a moment to gather his wits. A few moments ago it had seemed like a good idea to tell Steve what he feels, now, not so much. But he was never known to chicken out.
'Yes, to Bruce and to Thor. But I don't want another incident with Clint like the one last week.', Steve clarifies as if any of them would have forgotten the prank war that had found its ending when Clint's locker almost blew in his face. The two of them hadn't spoken since then and no one knew how bad of a fight would follow. Or how much Nat would be out for Tony's blood.
Steve regrets ever needing so long to react to the words he had longed to hear. He just hadn't been able to understand how Tony could actually feel the same for him. When he draws back to look into deep brown eyes, Tony slowly blinks at him like he can't quite believe this is happening. He's beautiful.
Tony's heart rejoices at hearing that.
'It was you who told me that it's not his fault and he needs help.', he reminds him, taking a step closer to the brunet.
Tony frowns, walking back to the living room. 'What for? If you had needed help, you could have called me. Pep might have dumped a month worth of work on me but my family is a little bit more important.', he clarifies in case it hadn't been clear. Because of the extended vacation because of Steve's injury and the resulting need to take care of the family and his husband, Tony had let a lot of his work slide. But if that meant neglecting his family, he couldn't care less about his work.
'Shush, darling. It's not your fault.'
Steve still feels unsure around Tony after he almost confessed his love to him. He suspects that Tony notices that something is amiss but he hadn't said anything until now. Nevertheless, Steve decided he wouldn't stay away from Tony as long as the genius doesn't demand this.
Fortunately Steve doesn't ask any more questions, he is already familiar with Tony's antics. And wow, Tony hadn't thought anyone would ever keep up with all his shit but apparently Steve is, if just for the sake of the team, or maybe the blond really wants to be friends after all.
'Okay, see you later, honey.', Steve says, a little downcast. He had hoped to have Tony at his side. It's been a week since the accident and the group is taking it pretty hard. The hospital had already organized someone to teach Clint and his family the basics of sign language. It's frustrating to see the usually so happy Clint struggling.
The blond is rewarded by a shout seconds later. 'Back here, sweetie.' Steve wades through the gadgets that litter the floor and tables of Tony's workshop, things and projects he had started on but hadn't come around to finish yet. Dum-E greets Steve with a whir as soon as he gets into view and zooms over. Steve pats him, knowing how much the robot loves the affection. It had been a project of Tony when he was still in college, a very rudimentary artificial intelligence and nothing compared to Jarvis who watches over the whole penthouse. When Tony had installed him (of course before even asking Steve's permission or actually mentioning that he created a fully functional AI) Steve had to get used to the idea of being watched 24 hours a day. Now it is as normal as breathing to ask Jarvis to turn the music up or dim the lights or get Tony his morning coffee ready.
As unfair as it might seem, he doesn't care for his father's death. He hadn't loved Howard the way he had loved his mother. He was glad to be rid of him. Hadn't the death of his mother overshadowed these days, he probably would have thrown a party.
Clint shoots his next target. This is too stupid, he decides.
'Tony?' Steve's voice mirrors his confusion. Tony turns away from the camera and faces Steve though he keeps his eyes averted. He looks insecure.
'Tony, it's the right thing to do when one your friends is lying there on his own.', Steve reprimands him with a sigh, having had this discussion with his boyfriend many times. Usually though it was about Tony finally needing to see a doctor.
Tony waves it off. 'As I said, it's just a prototype, I still need to calibrate it to your hearing. If you give me some more data, I can do better and we can maybe talk about an implant or if you're up for something that permanent.', he says, preparing the tests that would need to be done.
Barnes had killed his parents. And Steve would do anything to protect him. His Mom had to die just because she had wanted to go on the Bahamas.
'Bucky..', Tony rasps, his voice hoarse from everything behind him. He can barely look at his boyfriend who crouches down in front of him.
That's how they had always been since they first met each other. They banter, they prank each other, they fight. But in the end, Tony would call Barton his friend and knows the feeling is mutual. They would go to great length to annoy each other but also to help and comfort the other by offering a sense of normality. Tony doesn't do sitting around at someone's sickbed. It would have worried the archer more than his absence.
Tony shakes his head. It takes more than an hour before he feels ready to leave the bathroom again. Steve has already prepared the bed and is sitting on it, clearly waiting for Tony to arrive.
Tony sighs, giving up on continuing his work. He crosses his arms and leans on the workbench, looking straight at his friend. 'If Steve doesn't feel the same.. It would all be weird. We wouldn't be friends anymore.' And Steve wouldn't want to spend time with him anymore.
'Clint?', Steve asks, gently tapping the side of his face. The other man is out cold though, his clothes bloodied at some parts and torn. The car must have hit him. Blood trickles out of his ears.
'Off.' Steve nods, then slips under the covers as well and Jarvis turns off the lights in the room. 'Do you hate me?', Tony asks because he has to know, he has to hear it from his lover's mouth.
Barton snorts, knowing that they both know why he cares. 'Oh, please. If you wouldn't be so obvious, maybe it would be cute.'
'Help! I need help here! Help!'
Apparently his thoughts are plain as day to his friend. Natasha slides closer, a sympathetic look on her face. It's worse than Clint's assessment of his situation.
'Dad?'
Steve holds his hands, squeezing them a little to encourage his lover.
It's not the first time Tony had noticed the man in black but it's the first time he is up so close. He has Jarvis monitor each and every place he visits with the kids, has him scanning for potential threats all around the city and has facial recognition software on his contact lenses. No one can sneak up on him, not after everything he's been through.
Although, an injury that would demand Steve to stay in hospital for a week despite the super soldier serum, means he would not be able to go on the mission within the next month or two. If it would be up to Tony, the blond would stay out of these missions completely. Steve's wounds might have healed but he still needs to regain his mobility and especially flexibility. Two times a week a physiotherapist comes by to train with the super soldier.
Steve lies right behind his back, his breath light and deep. So close and yet so far away. He isn't fooling Tony for a second. The blond lies awake each night for at least as long as Tony. The shadows under his eyes had become permanent. His convalescence had gone well, as well as could be expected. Despite his rigorous training though, Steve doesn't seem to find sleep either.
Tony just stares at him, waiting for the inevitable. He knows Steve's next words before he can even utter them. That doesn't take away their sting however.
Tony moves closer to his husband and snuggles into his side, not wanting any of them to lose a word about this. For a moment Steve freezes, then relaxes when Tony wraps around him. Steve wiggles his arm free and wraps it around Tony, pulling him even closer.
'I know he's dead.' It sounds final when he says it. The truth starts sinking in slowly. 'Shush, the doctor says you're in shock.' He caresses Tony's cheek to get him to look up. It stings slightly, letting Tony know that a big bruise is forming there already.
Tony nods. He is rather surprised like he can't understand any of this yet. 'Why didn't you say anything?', he asks softly, looking him over again and again.
'Thank you.', Tony whispers quietly as Steve leads him out of the hospital. Steve merely nods as he holds the door to the car open. Happy has a worried look on his face when he looks in the rear mirror but he starts the engine immediately, getting them home. Steve raises the wall between them, pulling Tony closer to him.
'I don't put up with you. You are such a wonderful person and you don't even see that. When you see a problem you don't succumb to it. You don't stand around idly like the rest of us. You're a fixer. You don't mourn what is lost, you take the pieces and make them better.', Steve says, conviction audible in every word. 'You're a hero.'
He closes his eyes, enjoying the warmth and solidity of Steve next to him. 'I know.', Tony whispers.
They had named their kids after dear people whom they had lost, or rather presumably lost. It's especially bitter now but Tony forces his own feelings down for the moment. With a smile he picks up his son who had crossed the distance. 'Where's Papa?', he asks after the hug.
In the morning Steve picks up Natasha to visit Clint before she would have to go to work. Tony hadn't come to bed all night, Steve pretends he didn't notice. He hadn't even seen him and had been a little surprised when Jarvis told him exactly where Sir went last night. They pass the ride in silence, each lost in their own thoughts.
He looks at Steve as if he is a particularly difficult problem he wants to solve. 'Why do you put up with me?', Tony asks, sounding as insecure as he had when the doctors announced his parents' death. Steve kisses his shoulder.
'I want you back but I don't know how to do that.', Steve admits. He hugs Tony close as if afraid to lose him. Tony hugs him right back, feeling equally relieved and afraid. 'And-'
He is still fuming by the time he reaches Clint's farm house, a good hour's drive from the Tower. Mistakes! How does he even dare? Tony gets out of the car and knocks on the door. It sounds impatient even to himself. After some moments Clint opens the door. He is in clothes which suggest that he was about to work in the garden or fix something outside. In the background Tony can hear the kids playing somewhere and Laura sending them out of the kitchen.
Tony doesn't even turn around. 'There is still a lot of work I need to get finished.', he grumbles.
Thor frowns deeply. 'His friend lies in a hospital with a grave injury and he prefers to work? That is not right.'
It was supposed to be a normal training exercise before it all went wrong. Everything is a little fuzzy as Tony stares at the nurse before slowly taking off his suit.
If Steve would be anyone else, Tony might be tempted. As it is though, the latter is not an option. He wants Steve like he has never wanted anyone else before.
The man with the big baggy black jacket, the dark cap and the black jeans and boots has been following them all the way from the bakery to the playground. This is no chance meeting though, Tony had seen him too often and in too many different places for this to be a coincidence. Tony Stark knows when he is being followed.
'Not much, I was just looking for you.', Steve says, leaning on the bench to look at Tony's latest project. It's nothing like anything Tony had created before. It looks tiny, Steve can't fathom what it is for. The precision welder is on hold, Butterfingers is holding the rest of Tony's tools. Usually the genius is busy trying to build up his empire after his father died a few years ago, leaving a weapons company to him, something Tony never had wanted to do. This doesn't look like one of the devises he usually produces to earn enough so he could convince the shareholders that it was the right decision to stop manufacturing weapons.
Tony can't sleep. As much as he tries, he just can't fall asleep. His brain refuses to cooperate, his thoughts race and he can't simply shut them off. Usually after a whole day of working for the benefit of his company, dealing with the kids and then doing some work for the Avengers, Tony falls into bed and is gone to the land of sleep within seconds if he happens to find his way into bed.
Steve laughs softly, then puts his sketchbook aside. 'Sure. What did you have in mind?'
'Just stuff.', he says so offhandedly that Steve grows suspicious. He would have to ask Jarvis about this later. He trusts Tony and knows he would never invent something intentionally harmful but that doesn't mean that the machine that would destroy this planet wouldn't be from his hand.
'Where is Stark?', he asks, looking at Steve for an excuse he doesn't have. He could easily lie but that seems wrong.
'Tony.' The word is slurred, slightly mispronounced given the fact that Barton can't hear himself anymore. His eyes flit between Tony and his hands.
Tony huffs out a laugh but cuddles deeper into the embrace. 'Sap.', he says, as if he would mind. Then, very quietly, he says: 'I love you too.'
'Ready to head upstairs?' Tony pulls him out of his thoughts. They had decided to watch a movie and order some pizza as soon as Tony was done and apparently the inventor still wants to go through with that plan.
'Did you expect someone else?', Barton asks with a smugness that is all too much his own. 'Rogers is out with Nat.', he is informed as if Tony had asked.
Steve doesn't care for their banter. He presses a kiss on the top of Tony's head, breathing in his scent. He doesn't care for anything except that Tony loves him and that he can finally hold him in his arms.
It weighs heavy on the kids as well. Maria doesn't ask a lot of questions any more, she and James look like they're afraid they might set up this shaky balance.
his eyebrows almost reach his hairline. 'What? We both made mistakes? What the actual fuck, Steve?', he asks. 'It's now my fault for blaming Barnes? Are you out of your fucking mind?!'
'Evening, sweet pea. Any luck on finding him?', he asks though, choosing to ignore the suspicious absence of their kids for the moment. They are probably up in their rooms, trying to find a new way of getting into trouble.
'Alright.', he drawls, not feeling like prying just yet. 'I just wanted to let you know that Nat and I are on the way to the hospital.' When Tony doesn't react in the slightest, Steve raises an eyebrow. 'Do you want to come with us?'
Then he looks at the top of the first page and his heart nearly stops.
They are three stories under the common floor when the elevator stops suddenly. The jerk almost throws Tony off his feet but Steve can catch him in the last moment. Dazed the inventor looks at the ceiling as if the problem would be visible from the inside.
Barnes knows Tony saw him ages ago, making him briefly wonder how long he had actually followed them. He is like their personal shadow.
Steve freezes suddenly, knowing now all too good what this is about. They want him to finally confess before his infatuation would ruin a mission. Tony is rigid as well. Does he suspect? Is he so repulsed by the very idea?
Tony takes the folder, not taking his eyes off Steve for a second. When the blond indicates him to open it, Tony finally breaks eye contact and looks at the blinding white paper in front of him. It's a mission Hydra had assigned to their best asset, the Winter Soldier. Curiosity gets the better of him as to why Steve thought he would have to see this for himself, so he opens it. The typewriter font has started to fade but every word is still readable, it's a bad photocopy of the original. Tony skims the text. It's a translation of the original record, one Hydra had made probably after the information had reached the States. It's talking about two targets and a cargo that would need to be extracted. At the end it only reads that the mission was a success. There are no specifics, no details, nothing that would give Tony any hint why this is more important than any other mission of the Winter Soldier. Just two seemingly random murders.
They pile into Thor's and Tony's car, then drive after the ambulance to the hospital. Clint's already on his way to surgery when they arrive after a very silent and tense car drive. They remain mostly in silence, waiting for a doctor to come for them. The only thing interrupting their silent vigil is the arrival of Barney whom Thor tells what had happened.
'You're early.', Barton greets him, a cheeky smile on his face. 'Already done with your evening alone?' He suggestively wriggles his eyebrows. 'Not that I want details.', he assures, stepping aside to let Tony aside.
By the time the new day begins Tony emerges from the lab. It's been a long night and more than one fused wiring can tell the tale of a very distracted and upset Tony. Dum-E will probably refuse to talk to him for a week or so the way Tony yelled at him. The inventor already feels horrible because of it, not that he could have changed his behavior. The whole talk with Steve had upset him to no end. It's a fortunate thing that there had been no booze around the Tower for years. It had taken all he had to not track down Barnes immediately and kill him.
Steve doesn't turn on the light when he enters the bed room that night. The regular breathing of Tony reaches his ears when he strips down to his boxers and carefully slides into bed as to not startle the other man. Tony lies on his side, not moving when Steve makes himself comfortable spooning the brunet.
'I have called your friends. They will be here soon.', she says, squeezing Tony's hand before heading off, knowing better than to bother Tony Stark in a hospital.
'Tony?' Steve seems to know what his prolonged silence means. There is a hand on his face, turning it away from the pictures of the Hydra soldiers to look at his husband. He draws back as if Tony's skin burned him suddenly. He must see the rage and fury in the brown eyes.
'Damn.' This just won't do. 'Phase two?'
'You think too nicely of him, big guy.', Tasha gets involved. 'Tony is just a jerk.'
'Two targets.', he mumbles, continuing to stare at the page as if that would change the words written on them. His hands start trembling so he shuts the folder with more force than necessary. 'What's the meaning of this?', Tony asks through gritted teeth. He can't look at Steve, can't do anything but sit there and stare at the blank folder in front of him. It seems to mock him.
'I love you too, Steve. So much that it sometimes hurts.', he admits. Silence settles between them, it's not uncomfortable however.
He is through with this. They can get together on their own or not at all. He doesn't care anymore. And if he is pouting, well then, so be it. It's not as if anyone can see him.
When they open the door to Clint's room, Tasha stops dead in her tracks. She must be shocked by the scene in front of her just as Steve had been surprised. Tony is asleep on the chair near the bed, looking adorable and peaceful. Clint had somewhen in the night gotten a hold of Tony's tablet and had fallen asleep playing some kind of game probably.
Steve sighs. 'I wasn't sure but Jarvis investigated this a lot faster than either of us could. He found some old records of your father. They say he wanted to take his own version of the super soldier serum to Washington the week before Christmas 1991.' Steve rifles through his papers once more and pulls out some files, spreading them in front of Tony. 'Hydra later had that serum or at least one with a very similar working. Those are from February 1992.' Still in shock Tony opens the folders, taking in the pictures of several Hydra agents who seem to have been injected with a kind of super soldier serum. What happened to them the reports don't say. Steve explains his findings. However, Tony can't hear him over the rushing of blood in his ears.
Tony shakes his head. 'No, screw you.' With that he turns around and is on his way to the elevator. This is certainly not how he had pictured the evening. He can't continue this conversation, not now anyway and he doubts he would ever want to have it.
The nurse says something about needing to stitch him up and Tony nods. When the doctor comes in, he knows already what he is going to say. He sees the lips of the doctor move but the world seems to be without sound. It could have been hours before the sound returns and the nurse leads him into a private waiting room. He didn't even feel the stitches.
'Something like that.', he mutters. Tony hadn't wanted to talk to Barton about this matter, neither does he wish to discuss it with his wife. She would just say he overreacted. Or worse, try to console him. That's not something the inventor wants to deal with right now. He just wants to grab his kids and go. Where to though, he doesn't know yet.
Natasha stares at him with her mouth open, not believing what she sees right in front of her eyes. 'You can hear us?', she asks, shock and forbidden relief evident in her voice.
The brunet looks up from his conversation with Bruce in which far too many words sound fictional for Steve's liking. Tony had been elated to find another physics major to talk science and shop with. 'A very large coffee, please.', he asks with a smile.
'Call an ambulance.', he shouts over his shoulder, trying to see if his friend is okay. For the driver he wouldn't be able to do much, his car already being completely on fire. The heat it radiates almost singes Steve's skin but he drags Clint away from the crash side. Thor helps him not a moment later, having ran the distance between them.
Steve nods. With a smile Tony turns back to his work while Steve goes upstairs, cursing his own cowardice once more.
Yeah, Tony thinks, that was before. 'I can't help the killer of my mother. Not even for you. And you can't expect that from me.' He takes a few steps back to get some distance between them, fearing what he might do if Steve came too close.
'I don't want to talk about that, Steve.', Tony cuts him off before he can even start talking. James and Maria exit the elevator after him giving their parents a strange look.
Tony swallows when the first drops of rain hit his windshield. It doesn't take him long to reach a decision. 'You want to come with us?', he asks. Barnes hesitates. 'You can go whenever you want.', Tony adds, knowing that he wouldn't get in otherwise. The man in black contemplates the offer. Finally he nods again. Tony pushes the passenger door open, waiting for Barnes to get into the car. James and Maria watch the stranger closely while he climbs into the car, not yet sure about him. Tony restarts the engine after giving them an encouraging smile. It'll be alright.
'Well, I happen to like Bruce and Thor. At least Bruce isn't stupid and knows what I am talking about. And Thor is funny.' Tony crosses his arms, glaring at Steve. 'It's not as if Barton would like me particularly either.'
Tony huffs out a laugh. 'Me too. This is crazy. I just want our life back.' He can feel Steve nodding above him.
Natasha isn't feeling any better about this matter. She is angry at their leaders for not seeing their attempts for what they are. They are both ready to give this whole thing up.
Tony hasn't forgotten about his parents and neither will he anytime soon. Steve knows that as well so he lets him be in his anger and resentment. He is neither going to stand down and give up on Bucky.
'Oh, really? How exactly did you think I would react to the message that your psychotic friend murdered my parents and you taking his side?', Tony asks, already feeling himself get worked up again.
'So, I'm not going to ask you how you are. You look like shit, that's answer enough.' The chair is highly uncomfortable but he stays where he is. Furthermore, Tony makes sure that Barton can read his lips as well as see the signs. The insult startles a grin out of the blond who gives him a finger without missing a beat.
He takes a tentative look at the clock, surprised to find that it is already midnight. Just to make sure though, he asks Jarvis about Steve's whereabouts. When the expected answer, that he is already asleep, comes, Tony packs the few things into his backpack and sneaks into the garage. The drive to the hospital is short, especially since he ignores one or two speed limits on the way.
'Because you have been hoping for months now and nothing has happened.', Natasha reminds him, something Steve grudgingly has to admit. 'Then you can finally get over this and move on.' He knows that Natasha isn't the biggest fan of Tony Stark but she is right, even Steve's love-addled mind has to admit that. He hates lying to his best friend. Maybe saying the truth wouldn't be so bad.
'Tony?', Steve calls into the dark room. He knows better than not to check as his boyfriend would sometimes hide in the dark with a tablet and Jarvis to keep him company.
Steve shakes his head. Tony turns around to go into the kitchen to organize something for them and then go looking for the kids who must be starving for attention by now, when the blond calls him back. 'Wait.' He stands up from the sofa, the little stiffness in his legs not as quickly gone as usual. For a moment Tony wonders for exactly how long his husband had stayed in that exact position. 'I asked Clint to watch the children for tonight.'
'I didn't take his side, Tony. I just want you to see it, that's all. I will always be there for you.', Steve says and it sounds sad beyond words.
'Cause it's none of their business. And I didn't do anything special.', he says, deflecting the admiration as usual. Tony moves a little as if uncomfortable but Steve holds him closer.
There is a short silence on the other end, then Natasha apparently snatches the mic from Clint and says, 'This is an attempt to save our team and friendship.'
It's not Barnes' fault what happened back there. Tony had resigned to hold on a grudge. The soldier probably doesn't even remember. He had had a brief thought of scaring him away when he saw him that very first time on the way to the kindergarten. That stream of thoughts had vanished pretty quickly though. Tony doesn't exactly know why or how it happened, but being angry at an unknown figure was far easier than being faced with the target of that hate, especially since that target looks so worn and generally down at heel.
'Slow down, Tony. Darling.' Finally Tony looks up to meet Steve's impossibly blue eyes. 'Please slow down. Could you start at the beginning?' How could he be so calm seeing that his best friend is right now little more than a bundle of blood and pulp? It gives Tony the strength though to breathe in deeply and nod.
Tony sighs. 'I messed up, that's what happened. Thought it's just a quick reconnaissance mission, didn't think they were waiting for us. I tried to get him out but that didn't work. We fell. Then there was that explosion and then..', he rambles, barely able to get the words out as quick as they come.
'I should have known better and stopped him.' Tony shakes his head. 'I'm sorry.', he says, getting back on track. Somehow talking helped. 'We continued to search the forest. There have been clear signs of human activity in the area which just solidified our suspicions. It could have been nothing, it could have been a big threat. We didn't know, so we just went on, looking for clues and hints. Barnes found some footprints and other signs that someone had been there not too long ago. He motioned me to follow him and we sneaked closer to a hill right in front of us. We were pretty high up by then, far away from civilization, a remote location if I've ever seen one.'
'I've got something for you but it's just a prototype so don't expect everything to be perfect. The data the hospital has stored on you is highly insufficient. With a neuronal scan this would have been far easier.' Tony rambles, knowing full well that Barton doesn't understand half of the signs he uses but he doesn't care. He pulls a box out of his backpack and hands it over to Barton. When the latter just stares at him, Tony rolls his eyes again and opens the box for him.
'You should go home, Stark. You look like you could se some sleep.', Clint says when Tony makes no move to get up again.
'Don't break them, they cost more than your childhood home.', Tony notes dryly.
Instantly Steve's smile turns more genuine. He must look like a lovesick fool, not that Tony would notice that or that he would care. The brunet looks beautiful like this, with his hair all mussed up and grease on his hands. This is his natural environment, not the lime light, not a meeting room. It's here in the lab that he truly becomes himself.
Clint raises an eyebrow. 'And why is that?'
And he knows exactly what had changed.
The silence hangs in the room for a moment too long before Tony says:, 'I love you too.'
It's a strange thing to be contemplating, especially since Tony is a hero. He had never thought about killing anyone, not Obadiah for putting him through Afghanistan, not Loki for forcing him to go into space and almost dying there, not Killian for endangering Pepper's life. Not even Rumlow for almost getting his husband killed. It's new and frightening and Tony can't fight this. He wants to see Barnes dead for killing his mother.
Steve's ears ring as he makes his way to the accident. He almost loses his balance when the ringing doesn't stop but he manages to get to the person who had been hit by the car, immediately recognizing Clint.
Tony types in his security code when there is no answer at all. It apparently doesn't have the desired effect. 'Maybe there is some kind of interference.', he mutters, turning away completely from Steve.
'He stayed home. A lot of work that needs to be done.', Steve answers, looking straight ahead as if that would take the sting out of the words.
Anger wells up in Tony, anger about finding out, anger at his father for ever creating that stupid serum, anger at Steve for telling him this horrible truth. Anger at Barnes for killing his mother. The last one is burning with an intensity Tony isn't used to. For more than twenty years he had believed a tragic accident took his beloved mother from him, now it turns out it was Steve's bestie. This is just fantastic. How the ever-loving hell can this be his life?
Tony sighs. 'Just because I am mad at him, doesn't mean I don't love him.', he explains the kid. 'I love your Papa very much. I'm just a little angry at him at the moment.' Tony isn't sure if James understands it but he nods.
'First, I am not putting up with him. I love Tony with all my heart. And if you would know him better, you would have a better opinion of him as well. He is used to people around him using him. So he keeps them at distance. I know he can be an asshole. A big one at that. Don't think I am blind. He's snarky and secretive and is always putting up a façade so no one sees when he is hurt.' Steve sighs. 'But he is hurt and he is wonderful once he lets you in. He cares about all of you.'
Steve just smiles at him. 'I love you too.'
Further Tony doesn't get because Steve has pulled him into his arms and has his lips pressed to Tony's in an instance. The genius freezes for a moment, then kisses Steve back with vigor.
'What injuries didn't you tell them about?', he murmurs into his hair.
Steve takes his hand, uncaring for any looks he might get for being involved with Tony Stark, owner of SI, whom most of his fellow students know as the maker of their phones and tablets. 'Not sure. Still have to go to the library and work on my thesis. Then there is the homework for-'
'I cannot recommend that, Captain Rogers. Sergeant Barnes is not in a shape to be seen. His injuries were extensive. By the time he came here, he must have been dead for some time.', he tries to hold Steve back, at least for a little while.
Steve throws a disapproving glance in her direction. 'He is not.' He doesn't feel like explaining to them that Tony had had a very traumatic field surgery while he was still a teenager and was being taken to Afghanistan by his father to test some weapons. Tony had never shared much details but the scars on his chest and the mumbling during his many nightmares have given Steve a pretty good idea that if he knew the exact extent of Tony's psychological and physical wounds, he would find a way to travel back in time and hit Howard Stark in the face for ever putting Tony through that.
Life goes mostly back to normal after this, even the kids can feel the relieved tension in the air. They watch their parents with barely disguised skepticism during the first days.
'I cannot say for sure until after the autopsy There are major burns on your friend, a lot of internal damage. He has been shot several times. Each of his wounds could have been lethal.'
It's approximately two weeks after the whole fiasco when Tony takes his son to bed that the boy makes his move. Tony had just read him his bedtime story and gave him a goodnight kiss, he is just about to turn off the light when James calls him back.
'He murdered my parents. How can you defend that?' Tony is surprised that he is not yelling. His voice is seeping with rage though. Steve flinches slightly. He jumps up from his seat because he can't look at Steve any moment longer. His hands curl into fists. He shakes with fury as he starts pacing.
Tony rolls his eyes, looking up from his phone for once since they entered the campus. 'I am always nice.' He always pretends to be busy when he is among people, as if he would know of a thousand better places to be. After four years though Steve had gotten used to this side of Tony.
'I told him to stay home.', Tony says, not sure why he opts for the truth. He knows exactly how inquiring his son is, after all.
The sound of the door must have disturbed the occupants of the room as they both start coming to themselves. Tony rubs his eyes, running his hand through his hair, then he moves his neck slowly, looking for the kinks that had surely found their way into it in that sleep position.
Steve stops dead on his tracks. 'Are you fighting with Jarvis again?', he asks with a knowing smile.
It's a peaceful picture, one Steve can't admit comes to his surprise. He just hadn't thought Tony would stay the whole night.
Which he is, no doubt about that. Despite that, Tony finds barely anything apart from sympathy inside him for the man who killed his parents. Barnes is good at hiding his face but rumor has it, Tony is no fool. He had recognized him from the very beginning. It must have been a month after his reconciliation with Steve when Tony had seen the man for the first time, hovering in the background, never too close.
Tony nods. The relief he had hoped for doesn't come. His heart breaks and he doesn't even know why. His parents had died more than twenty years ago, it's not as if he is still grieving.
'Hello, sweetheart.' Stella beams at him. Then she recommends something which Clint takes as usual without hesitation or second guessing. He really trusts her cooking. It's just the small cafeteria of the campus after all, only serving about a hundred students every day. Then again, Steve has to agree, the food is very good. He takes the same as Clint and gets a sandwich and coffee for Tony who as usual pretends that he could never eat in a cafeteria but his boyfriend hadn't had breakfast today except for the coffee which hardly counts.
Jarvis analyzes Barton's reactions to a wide variety sounds. Apparently there is an insufficiency when it comes to the high frequencies, a mistake Tony is sure he can repair. All in all the earpieces work better than he had hoped.
He lasted two songs, and then excused himself to get some water, because he really could not listen to Sharon singing one more Britney Spears song, and also because the vodka was really starting to settle in the bottom of his stomach. He filled the glass to the top with water and downed it, only to fill it up again.
"Stark really hit on you and not me?" Clint asked in disbelief.
kind of online presence."
It barely rang twice before Tony's very breathy voice was answering. "Hey there stranger -" He all but purred into the receiver. "What are you wearing?"
"Don't do that-" Tony tries, but it's already too late.
It wasn't that he was mad, because that wasn't really what he was feeling. He just felt deflated, for ten years he had made up this story in his head about why things happened, and how, and in one morning he had the rug pulled beneath his feet. Everything he thought he knew, was wrong.
Tony's eyebrows came together, but the nervous look seemed to dissipate. "That can't be true." He sat up in his chair though, dropping his bend and grabbing Steve's phone up off the table instead. "I think people just need a chance to meet Steve, I've met Steve and I'd still date you."
Natasha laughs and rolls her eyes, but says goodbye and insists she will tell Clint he still owes him that ten.
"Would you have toasted to life?" Steve spoke his voice closer with every word, offering one of the glasses to Tony.
Tony took the fabric from Steve's outstretched hand, before he stepped right into Steve's space, reaching up to flip up Steve's shirt collar. He gently placed the fabric under the fold, and reminded himself to keep focused at the task at hand, and ignore the burning feeling his gut was going through being that close to Steve once again.
"There's still a lot about me that's private." Steve answers, trying his best to keep vague, even if he's certain Pepper already knows most of everything about him. "Feels wrong not letting the world know, but it also feels wrong needing to let them know at all."
It makes both Tony and Steve snap back from each other and into reality, Steve almost jumping off the couch entirely, Tony, thankfully, handling the startle a bit better simply sits up.
Steve sighed down at his phone, re-reading his last received text message again, and again, and then once more for good measure. Natasha had been trying to set him up on dates, plural, for quite some time now. Steve didn't know why she was so concerned with his love life, but she had said something about him needing to move on in the world, staying occupied and having sex - but Steve didn't understand how any of that had anything to do with his general quality of life. He was busy, when he wasn't literally saving the world, he was smiling for cameras, or volunteering. Between superhero life, and filling out endless paperwork, he barely had time to catch a baseball game or sketch or paint. The last thing he wanted to do during his few peaceful hours off was to have an anxiety attack over where to take a date, what to wear, how to act, what flowers to buy. It just seemed so small in the grand scheme of things.
Tony think's he should be upset, but his legs feel a bit like Jell-o, and hes sure he's about to stumble or fall asleep, so instead he nods, and lets Steve take his hand and lead him back into the house. He expects to be lead to the couch, but he can still hear people singing, and Steve is taking him up the back stairwell. So Tony goes with it. It's a guest room of some sort, he guesses, but he's tired now so it doesn't really matter, the bed is warm and comfortable, and that's good enough for him.
Steve's reply was a roll of his eyes, waiting for Tony to buckle his seat belt, before checking his mirrors and pulling out of the alleyway. "How much did you have to drink?" and tony could tell Steve was trying his damnedest to not sound patronizing.
Which brought them to now.
"I'll tell Sam you're on your way." Clint said, behind the closing door.
"Might be." Steve shrugs, focusing back down at the book in his lap the pencil moving carefully over the page.
"Organizing for the rehearsal tomorrow." Steve says with a grunt as he piles the hay bail on another. "What are you doing out here?" And he sounds, short, but Tony doesn't want to read into it.
"Nothing." Natasha said with ease. "Just thinking I might try and take these boys money one last time before bed."
Natasha laughs as she steps into the elevator. "You're already paying for the welcome dinner, which by the way we didn't even need to have."
"Pepper is going to murder you." Tony laughed again, and Steve swore he could hear the woman in question ask what was so hilarious.
"Do you do anything fun anymore?" Tony asks, shifting the pillow under his head to get a better look at Steve, but not yet feeling brave enough to actually sit up.
"Don't have to ask me twice."
"This is important." Tony argued, though it was beginning to feel like the moment was starting to pass, as now both Steve's cell phone and his were ringing again. "It better be a fucking emergency."
"I told myself I wasn't going to stop." Tony said, mostly to himself, turning slowly on his heel, trying to pull back his shoulders, puff out his chest, do anything but look as hurt as he felt. "But here I am."
"I can't stop thinking about you." He whispers as he backs Tony up into the elevator wall. It's late, everyone's asleep, everyone but Tony, and Steve knew that would be the case when he ventured to the kitchen. "Just one more time to get you out of my system. I swear."
"Are you serious?" Tony's voice was in a near whisper as he looked down into Steve's blue eyes.
"Yeah-" Tony seemed to be in a bit more control of his own legs, by the time they made it into the penthouse, still he hung on to Steve but used his own legs to direct them both towards his bedroom, kicking his shoes off as he moved. "You know, Woo me,  like buying me flowers and dedicating songs to me over the radio." Tony pushed open his bedroom door, finally loosening his grip of Steve's arm before asking, "Do they do that on radios anymore?"
"Tony no." Steve mumbles, voice muffled by the pillow he's laying on.
The ceremony is beautiful, and Steve and Tony share an evening to themselves.
Steve nods, and holds his place to stop their walking before turning to face Tony. "I know we can't just pretend it didn't happen. I let you down." And it sounds like a confession the way he says it, his face is serious but his hand stays in Tony's, warm and safe. "Tony, I will gladly spend the rest of my life working to earn back every ounce of your trust if it means I get to be near you again."
"Sorry. Have you thought of asking one of the hundreds of girls that throw themselves at you every time we walk down the street?" Steve didn't have enough hands to count how many times Women, and the occasional guy even, would scream Tony's name or ask him to sign their bodies, or beg him to take them out on dates. Each and every time Tony would smile his smooth smile and politely decline the dates and the kisses, but stop for every photo and sign every body part offered up to him. "I really am having trouble believing you cant' get a date Tony."
Tony smirked, pulling his suit jacket from the back of his office chair, and waiting for Natasha to head out of the office before following her. "You know, if you were anyone else I'd have you fired for being so snarky, but I like you Big Red, not sure why, but there's just something about you."
"Oh I look good." Clint near purrs as he looks at the photo over Steve's shoulder. "Add a filter on it to really bring out my eyes will ya? Don't forget to tag me. I got fans to impress." Clint didn't wait for Steve to even reply, before he was reaching over and pressing small squares to change the coloring of the photo.
Steve rolled his eyes, but Tony barked out a laugh before asking "Sure, yeah so what's your hold up?"
"Exactly." Natasha placed the lid on the blender before shrugging. "I'm hot, you're hot, two hot people of opposite sexes can't possibly friends Steve, you should know this."
"Please." Tony said with a friendly smile, though while Sharon turned to grab him a beer, he couldn't help but scan the room and notice someone conveniently missing. Not to be rude, he found himself asking Sharon how long she had known Natasha for as she handed him a cold bottle.
Steve nodded in the affirmative, using one hand to hold on to the armor and the other to pull his shield from where it sat on his back. He looked directly into the face plate a little curious how well Tony could see him from inside there, hopeful that he was looking back. "Thanks for the ride, maybe I can reciprocate sometime-" He used all the infliction he could on the word ride and offered a smirk before letting go of Iron Man entirely and letting gravity take over.
"Tony?" Steve's voice yanked Tony's attention backwards, causing him to spin on his heel towards the kitchen.  Steve's shoulders were tense, and his brow furrowed as he spotted Tony from across the kitchen, he had just come around the corner from the back steps and clearly surprised to see Tony in his house. "What are you doing here?"
"Don't care." Tony repeated himself before adding. "I have many shirts Rogers. Endless shirts. Shirts are replaceable, stop thinking so hard."
"No." Tony took the glass but set it on the coffee table in front of him. "No I probably would have toasted innovation or something mindless instead."
"First of all, don't be nosy." Tony raised a single finger, before adding a second one. "Secondly, never with her, been there, done that and if I wanted to jump back into the dating pool it would not be with a literal shark."
"Oh then definitely open mine next." Tony said, reaching down and pulling up the gift he had brought. "It's technically for both of you, but not really."
Steve proposed under the light of that shit lamp. After a particularly rough argument, they had traded jabs all night long, over what, Tony couldn't even remember. He just remembered screaming that it was over, that they were over, that he couldn't live like this. He remembered Steve left in a huff and he was sure that he would be gone forever. He threw himself into his work, beneath that flickering yellow lamp and completely lost track of time. When he came back to reality, Steve was there, knelt down next to the table with flowers he had stolen from someone's garden and asked. They whispered apologies between kisses and Tony promised to be better, while Steve promised forever.
, and kind of lost any acceptable 'wading into the whole technology thing' time. So now, here he was, in a high tech world, just trying to figure everything out, and for the most part those tech guys were right. Watch Clint turn on and off the television enough times and you sort of get the idea.
He has to take a deep breath. The room is quiet like a grave. 'There were more weapons, far more. It made me think that they didn't attack with the worst they had.' He looks down. 'Jarvis, do you have coverage of that?'
Full of wonder Barton looks at him. 'Thank you, Stark.'
With a sigh Tony lets go of the blanket around which he had curled (a very insufficient replacement of his super soldier) and turns around to his husband. Steve turns his head to see if he would get up like he had so many of the past nights but Tony doesn't think of going down to the lab to spend his night with Dum-E and Jarvis. They are not whom he wants.
'Thought so.', he mutters, turning back to his team. 'So, yeah, no radio, nothing to call anyone. I knew you must be looking for us by then but that didn't mean you'd be looking for us in the right place or that you could win against them. It was obviously a trap designed to capture or kill one Avenger or two. I dragged Barnes along. They caught up. There was a skirmish in the hallway. I don't know what exactly happened. Barnes pulled me down to the floor, then everything was on fire. I know some seconds are missing there, that's maybe when I got hit on the head. It's a concussion, I have no recollection of where I got it. It must have been there and then. I could feel the heat through the suit, especially where it was torn. Maybe I hit something, maybe they did. I could hear explosions ringing in my ears. People were screaming. I managed to get a hold on Barnes and get us out of the building before it blew. We got hit by the debris. My suit was down and the only info Jarvis could give me about Barnes is that I could do nothing. His injuries were too extensive. He told me of this hospital. It took me way too long to find a transport vehicle they left behind. My suit refused to work and time was ticking by.' Here Tony stops and refuses to go on. They all know that in the time he spent looking how to get them out of there Bucky stopped breathing.
Steve isn't fooled by their relationship though. They meet every day at least once, either for lunch or for dinner, depending on Tony's schedule. More often than not Steve wanders downstairs to Tony's lab somewhen during the course of the day where he sketches and watches Tony work, laughing and joking with the genius while Tony works too much for the team and for his company. Tony likes him to be around, says he works better when someone else than Jarvis listens to his rambling. Being around Tony is like an addiction. Steve knows the more he takes now, the more it is going to hurt when the inevitable happens, and that is Tony finding a partner. But he can't stay away, can't bring himself to not make Tony as happy as he can. Even if he is doomed to later suffer the consequences.
'Why don't you let anyone else see what I see?', Steve asks when he presses a kiss to Tony's shoulder. He does know the genius well enough to recognize his breathing when he is asleep and when he pretends to be.
Barton still seems surprised. He eyes the bag, then Tony. 'Why do you know sign language?', he asks out loud.
XXXXX
'I..' He has quite forgotten what he had wanted to ask Tony or rather he decides that he can't say it anymore. What if Tony wouldn't want to spend time with him anymore? What is so bad about one-sided love anyway? Steve knows he can't live without that smile and he knows that Tony would never feel the same for him. After all, the genius could have anyone, why would he be interested in plain, old Steven Rogers? No, he wouldn't care about Steve the way Steve cares about him. But Tony isn't cruel, that is something he never could be. He would end whatever friendship there is between them to spare Steve the pain of seeing him and then find a way to blame himself for this. That's not something Steve is willing to risk. 'I was wondering if you'd like to spare later.', he says instead. 'I haven't found the time to work out today.'
