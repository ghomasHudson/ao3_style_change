Staring back at him wasn’t the reflection of a man in his late twenties, but of a younger man. The man he had been before stepping into the suit, before flying into the sky with a nuclear bomb. This was the face of a man who had gone to galas, smiled prettily when he needed to. This was Tony Stark before the world had gone to hell.
Tony’s eyes flew open, his hand instantly grasping at the warm limb that curled softly around his waist. The nightmare was still close to the forefront of his mind, and he pulled the arm and therefore the large body attached to it closer so that he could hide in the warmth.
I'll try to update when I can (like I said, work is HECTIC right now and so is life). I'm so so honored that you guys enjoy this twisted story! <3
“Okay…” Tony lets his shoulders drop as if he had been holding tension in them. His only true fear being that they would see through his act.
Taking a deep breath, Tony figured that the reason his memory was so fuzzy was due to the debris that had smacked him. But there was no cause to panic when the kid he absolutely adored had gotten away from the former Avengers.
“I’m not leaving you!” Peter had pivoted from where he sat on the floor and glared at Tony. “I’m not going to let you go away again!”
There was a sort of panic on Steve Rogers face as he started to run, sprinting at Tony to stop whatever was coming from happening.
Tony knew that they had started to go a little stir crazy, but he had never expected Peter to step foot outside the bunker. At least, not without speaking to them first. He wondered if it had something to do with his birthday, had Tony done something wrong?
“Nothing stupid, there won’t even be enough time.” The blond was still grinning, picking up a little screw and twisting it at the tip of her fingers. “Tonight, or tomorrow… you pick.”
Carol frowned, shrugging as she started the drill again. “I’ve had a lot of jobs, so developed some skills from that.” She pointed towards her arm, where Tony finally spotted a small red dot that looked irritated. So, he realized, they had inserted something into her.
Without asking, Bucky scooped Tony up into his arms and twisted so that they were facing the door. The genius yelped, fighting the urge to vomit that had come from the sudden motion. He barely managed to focus before they were moving towards the front door, swinging open to reveal a smiling Bruce and Natasha.
Wanda looks intently into his eyes, “whenever you start to forget, when they start to really get into your brain….” She reached forward and touches his fingers, pressing his hand into a fist so that the tips of the fingers touch his palm. “Press down three times on your palm, I’ve embedded your memories there. So, you can always remember.”
Does he want to join them? No. He doesn’t want to sit with a group of people who are okay with torturing people. Tony’s tired but he hasn’t forgotten that they hurt people. But the alternative was sitting in the empty room, alone. Sure, he could turn on the television, but it could only keep his attention away from the memories for so long.
With a sigh the man set down his empty bowl of soup and leaned back in the chair. “Can you show me how to get down to the lab again? I don’t think I can figure it out on my own at the moment… didn’t pay as much attention as I should have yesterday.”
With a wicked grin on the blond’s face, she snatched up the widow bites and the bow and arrows, carrying everything over to the table in front of Tony. Without speaking a word, she immediately turned back and grabbed the rest of the gear, from Falcon’s wings to Bucky’s guns.
Cradling a palm over the back of Tony’s head, the soldier rocked him gently as his voice tried to shush him as the noise in the room died down. The sound of running water instantly sent Tony from sobbing to hysterical.
“Okay,” he turns to face the little boy who has sat and started to pet the cat that has strewn himself on the carpet. “Spill.”
Without another word, the king pivoted and disappeared into the hallway. Carol, grinning like a loon, threw a mock salute at Tony before she followed suit, stopping briefly in the kitchen to pour herself more coffee.
When Peter leaned back, Tony let out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding. The intelligence was still gleaming brightly in the eyes of the child, recognition.
Rather loud, in case someone was listening into their conversation, he continued. “We’re going to work on seeing about a weapon for you tomorrow Carol, you’ve already changed my mind on that. But today we have to finish the last touches on the rest of the team’s stuff. Make sure that nothing gets in their way.”
Immediately defensive, Tony glared at the man. “They’re not getting near my family. They don’t even know where to look.”
The genius knew that the kid wouldn’t be returning to the surface anytime soon. When Peter had finally grown enough courage to show his face around Tony, it had been to burst into tears and beg for forgiveness.
Without hesitation, Tony leaned down and lifted both Peter and Goose into his arms. “Besides, I’d like to spend some time alone with Peter.”
“Loki’s torture book,” Bucky spat, “all the fucked up things his father and his father’s friends had done to him.”
He threw his arm out towards Loki who flinched. Loki flinched way too much. “I killed my colleagues because he mind controlled me,” Clint added.
Despite the bickering, they were still smiling and Tony felt swallowed by the scene. He had tried to kill Bucky and he had hurt Sam. Yeah sure Bucky had killed his parents, but that wasn’t his fault and it took a lot of therapy for him to get to that point, but what he had done to Sam had been completely unnecessary. With no excuses that could be made.
Sam rolled over in his bed and Loki flinched. Sam rubbed his face. “Loki,” he called sleep caught in his voice.
Bucky shrugged. “I’ve never meet Fury. Rhodey says he thinks that he had a hand in the accords going smoother this time with the government. Or something. Tony sings his high praise and Steve rolls his eyes, but in the way you know he likes someone who trouble and Nat and Clint think he hangs the moon, so yeah.”
“No,” Wanda protested perhaps too quickly, there was no way she could be alone right now, “I would love to meet Peter and see Pepper and Rhodey.”
Oprah. Steve and his mother said that there were protest going across the whole country, but Sam couldn’t think of that. He just wanted his marriage certificate. It hurt in all the ways he had never let it hurt before.
Steve Rogers, the annoying little ass that he is, bought a bar in France. Bucky has always said he wanted to be a civilian in France and that still tickled his fancy now. T’Challa gave Bucky the best therapy he could find and Shuri had a million test to make sure the programming was gone and the arm was perfect.
He kept his eyes trained on the street. Without much flair, a man in a grey suit appeared in the street. He was wearing sunglasses despite the fact that it was night. Bucky stopped his juggling and tossed another rock up at Scott. “What,” Scott barked coming over to hand his head over the roof.
Sam pushed everything down. It was one thing to cry with his Mom for an hour it was another to break down in front of the entire family. Not that he thought it was a bad thing it just wasn’t something he was ready for. “Yeah Rylie and I were together,” he confirmed, “since the first night at training, he made me his husband and then he died.”
Wanda looked around that the other people in the room. Tony had found tours specifically for transfer students so these people were close to her age. Still, they all stared at them, just like they had at every other college.
Sam for a moment looked pained. “Yeah,” he agreed, “it’s one of them. Rylie he was my best friend, but he was killed in action.”
“I know,” Sam answered, “and she’ll come home when she’s made sure they can’t erase our history anymore.”
“I doubt we can get him to stop, but it looks like he is pretty content just keeping Queens safe,” Steve noted.
Clint took a long moment to consider that. “In New York, you don’t know Mj, Mj knows you,” he answered finally.
Loki gave Sam and hopeless look but nodded at Natasha. He watched Natasha maneuver the teen over to the stool. He sat rigid and tense. She mumbled in soft Russian. Clint tossed her a hairbrush. Natasha ran her fingers through Loki’s hair keeping up her soft mumbling.
A knock on her doorway drew her attention. Steve was leaning against the door with a small smile on his face. “Are you packed yet?”
She hadn’t even thought about switching colleges but she was relieved. Without Peter here, until the others arrived she could end up alone. Tony and Pepper were busy people.
Steve looked away and towards the window shuffling his feet “she uh, well cancer got her two months ago,” he answered.
Tony rolled his eyes over his mug chugging it down quickly. “Banner hid it,” he complained, “thanks for asking Natalie .”
“You’re lucky I’ve known you since you were born or else I would have kicked your ass when I got back,” Sam told him with a laugh.
Darcy and Jane arrived with Bruce on their heels. Jane slapped him across the face without hesitation. The women besides Thor snarled but also laughed. Thor held out his hand to keep her back looking down at Jane with a crushed expression. “I’m sorry Jane,” he answered clearly still confused.
Tony sighed. A school book picture came up of Peter. He was a small dark-haired thing with adorable chubby cheeks and lakes of brown eyes. “Oh, Stevie he looks like a puppy,” Tony complained, “how are we supposed to keep letting him do this? He’s way too young! He’s younger than you were!”
“They can try,” Sam admitted knowing very well that this wasn’t something a lot of people in power wanted to give him.
Loki hugged the blanket tighter against his chest. “How about we go give it to him after breakfast,” Sam suggested.
Steve laid back on the couch and opened up the group chat. He found the link after a bunch of pictures of Doritos from Clint and Sam yelling in all caps DAT ASS THOU.
Natasha rushed to Peter’s room and found the boy laying on the ground shaking barely conscious with vomit mixed with blood beside him. Natasha rolled him onto his side and felt for his forehead. He was burning. Far too hot. Immediately she stripped him of his clothes. “F.R.I.D.A.Y I need an ice bath,” Natasha ordered as she picked him up.
Loki huffed and sent out a tendril of his magic into the air, just looking for the release. “You are not a witch, and not a sorceress, and not a temptress, and not an anything.”
Fifty-eight minutes later Steve flipped the last page over and finished the last of his coffee. He looks at Tony. “You agree to this,” he asked no emotion in his voice.
Sam passed out around five in the morning and was woken up to light shining in his face. He groaned and shifted, but felt a weight against his side. He looked down and saw Loki. Loki looked back up at him. “Hi,” Lo greeted.
She didn’t tell him that she was afraid of being alone. That she wasn’t sure if she could handle it when Peter left for the week. “Tell me about what you have been doing.”
Rhodey sighed and then hugged the other man. Tony sank into the other man’s arms. “It’s going to be fine,” Rhodey coaxed, “and Pep, Peter, and I have your back.”
“Vision’s room is right next to yours and so is his house. If you two end up getting married I’ll build you a new one.”
“May’s phone broke,” she announced, “you’ll have to call Howie Parker to get in contact with her. Peter gets really sick once a year for no reason and is down for about two weeks,” she looked over at Cho assessing her again, “you have Helen Cho here as your doctor right, you’re not a doctor so you can’t do anything. Spend another day or two at your meetings get everything put together, whatever you can’t afford to put off any longer. Peter won’t wake up until then. I’ve already spoken to Miss. Potts about it, she’ll be here tomorrow. Now go to sleep.”
Tony looked away. “F.R.I.D.A.Y scan the contents of the book,” he ordered, “and tell me what you find.”
Tony stayed silent as Bucky spoke. He guessed the other man had a point, somewhere. “So you understand that my Ma wasn’t offended when she realized I loved Steve’s Ma more. And he knew that. He knew I worshiped that women" Bucky paused for a moment "he didn’t tell me when she died.”
Who would talk to Tony Stark like that? He pressed forward and read each letter one by one. The soonest one was dated three weeks ago and there was a photo under it. Steve Roger’s had a bi flag painted on his cheeks a brush pressed against the Winter Soldier's cheek a deep line of purple already there. The Black Widow holding a bottle of vodka out of Hawkeye's reach staring at the camera with Wanda sitting cross-legged on the bar three shot glasses being juggled with her magic while Scott sat on the bar stool in front of her.
Rhodey laughed. “She reminds me of you. When you showed up to MIT you were small and angry, and lonely. She’s more self-assured than cocky, but still the same. You wanted a friend, and so does she. She just might be more mature than you were.”
Sam fell asleep on the couch listening to Loki talk, and for the first time in a very long time, Sam was at peace.
“A couple,” Chase answered, “the Albrights on the first floor have two kids a boy who’s three and a girl who's five. They’re sweet. Then the Johnsons on the third floor have a thirteen-year-old daughter, of course, there’s us, and the Frisks who are now expecting a daughter. This apartment complex is more for the elderly and bachelors I’m afraid. Though the next one over is full of families. Oh yeah. I almost forgot May Parker is raising her nephew Peter. Her husband Ben died last year, shot in a mugging. They’ve been having a rough time so I’m afraid they aren’t the most sociable. Peter is about fifteen I think. Anyways they’re on the fourth floor, right above this one I think.”
“Through the mind stone’s control they were able to tie the last remains of the binding spell on me. They controlled the mind stone and their will was placed on the staff. As long as I had it they would be able to control me.
The rest of the Avengers groaned as Steve and Bucky took him deeper and deeper into their little void. But it was entertaining and easier than the conversations previously. “Let me tell you,” Clint explained with a laugh as they talked about the look-alike contest they had at the bar “you don’t look like yourself.”
Clint smiled over at him. Oče, huh. It worked. It really did. Over the next few weeks Wanda was tentative and a little jittery, but it slowly faded. “Your Oče is looking for you Wanda,” Laura announced as Wanda walked into the kitchen, “and I need you to bring down your laundry.”
In the shower, Loki watched the water cascade down and he slipped down with it until he was sitting against the wall. Then he let himself cry, letting the sound of the running water mask the sound of his muffled sobs.
Bucky glared at both Sam and Steve. Steve was blushing beet red, but so was Sam. “I do not need to hear about your sex life,” he groaned, “especially not a play by play.”
Sam had said they had been best friends. Sam didn’t answer for a moment. “Rylie and I meet in basics. We were at a based in Texas and for some ungodly reason, I was the only black guy there so I wasn’t making any friends fast. Nothing against those guys, love them all, but in some cases, I was the only black guy they’d ever seen outside of the media. It was a weird situation in general.
Bucky’s lips pressed into a soft smile. “I’d ruffle your hair, but Natalia must have done that braid and she’ll kill me if I mess it up.”
Bucky was kind of obsessed with Minecraft. And this wasn’t some regular Tony Stark gaming system. It was a Wakandan gaming system connected to Shuri’s gaming system. Yeah she had better things to do, but she liked it sometimes.
“Don’t ask me,” Sam answered, “ask me to fly a wingsuit. I don’t know a damn thing about magic and powers and I’d like to keep it that way.”
Bucky gave Sam a confused look, but Sam just shrugged. “That reminds me,” Pepper stated, "we’re sending you the newest draft of the accords.”
She pulled them both in and Lo was introduced to all of Sam’s cousins and his Sister and his sister in law, and nieces and nephews. “Is Gideon still in the kitchen,” Sam questioned.
It was a crappy letter and it was so fucking Captain America it reminded Tony that he had been looking at the idol during the whole mess, not the real life man. Still the phone stayed untouched in his pocket.
Emotional wasn’t really a problem yet. Loki went from screaming in his sleep trauma to removed from society trauma and that was about it for emotions. That and sleep.
“Didn’t you know that Steve was taking college classes,” Bucky stated, “the fan people have been aware for months.”
“Just want to make sure you know where you are with him,” Sam answered because the almost dating thing between Steve and Tony never really got fixed.
She smiled at him her face laced with exhaustion. Soon she was away on her flight home escorted by Natasha and Sam was left in the quinjet with Bucky. “Natalia is still angry,” Bucky stated as the quinjet took off.
He lead his mother and brother into the house completely off guard and Natasha was just as surprised. They sat in the kitchen with fruit punch and pie and Sam waited for his mother to announce what had happened. “We got you a court date,” she announced after small talk.
“He was walking through Queens and saw you put doing your thing he followed you home,” Tony answered, “he’s nosy as fuck and investigated. Then he brought your name and address back to me and the rest is history.”
Peter sputtered his whole face turned red and he started throwing out nonsensical words. Finally, he just groaned and laid back covering his face.
“They were the only experiments to live,” Natasha answered, “and she isn’t really sure why it worked on her and her twin.”
Then Mj promptly sat down on the chair at the other end of the bed. Ned stammered something that sounded like an apology and sat beside her his face in his hands.
Sam was not a Dad. Sam looked at Loki who was staring at him with trusting eyes, who dragged him into the living room every time he learned a new dance move to show it off. Who tugged Sam awake at five in the morning to show him how his plants were sprouting up. Maybe he was a bit Dad ish.
Natasha shrugged and left the room. Sam followed after her. The next morning Sam was showing Darcy and Jane around his house. They were busy shoving things into his closet. Damn it. “Please put my toaster back,” Sam requested, “I will teach him how to use it.”
He smiled proudly. “Dad,” Peter yelled bounding over, “I’ve never seen how far I can throw, but Steve wants to see now. So I’m going to run to the other side of the field so make sure F.R.I.D.A.Y gets it on camera please?”
Steve snorted, “yeah but the whole neighborhood still knew we were together no matter how much skirt chasing you did.”
“Oh my gosh, first of all I love you so much, I made you cookies, and my school made a banner for you and I think like half the girls in school dressed up like you for Superhero day and I can’t really blame them because I did as well, and Wow that’s really awkward and I shouldn’t have said that and I sound like a total fanboy, which I am, but you know you never want to sound like one because I know I get flustered whenever people start gawking about Spider-Man, which is weird to say out loud but apparently all the Avengers already know my secret identity which is cool I guess.”
Real smooth Peter. But a kind smile spread across her face. “My pleasure,” she answered ruffling his hair, “Sam is just pulling out a cherry pie. Let’s go join him?”
Sam frowned questions written on his face before he understood what Loki was asking. Then he took in another large breath. “No, Loki. We couldn’t. We aren’t like that.”
As Steve walked he Googled Spiderman and starred to watch the videos. The kid had potential, but it was so dangerous for him to be out here on his own without training. Steve knew that from experience. It took him way too long to figure out how to throw a punch without breaking his thumb.
Wanda felt her throat close and Laura pulled the younger women closer raking her fingers through her hair. Wanda let herself be overwhelmed and drifted into sleep.
Ah, that was why Sam had come last night. The temptress in the house must have told him. “So if you need anything ask F.R.I.D.A.Y,” Sam ordered, “now I’m going to go take a piece of that food so you know it’s not poisoned and then I’ll leave.”
While Shuri was friendly, funny, and intelligent she had a hard time keeping friends. The Wakanda people were amazing and smart, but even they couldn’t match Shuri’s intelligence. And if you can’t keep up with her she didn’t always have a ton of patience, even though she often had more patience for that than those she was trying to talk to. And her schedule was varied. She didn’t have the time to keep connections. Then there was her mental age which was much higher than most of the people her age, because of all the things she had gone through. But Peter seemed to be doing her good.
Loki nodded and Bucky opened the door further. “Go play with Steve, Sam,” Bucky ordered, “he’s one of his whimsy art moods.”
Peter’s eyes widened. “How did you know that,” he squeaked, “and I’m not really the heir, I mean they’re like my parents well they are my parents but nothing legal like that” Petter rambled “But you know I totally respect secrecy so sorry for prying.”
Thor nodded. “I’ll prove that to you one day then,” he announced, “and I’ll come back to visit as soon as I can.”
Natasha and Wanda were already in France getting their covers ready. Sam thought it was a terrible, brilliant, thing when Steve and Natasha got plotting. Clint and Scott would be joining them next week.
“Maybe I do,” Loki answered with a laugh and Thor offered him a smile taking a seat on a bench looking up at Loki from where he sat on a flower bed’s stone wall.
Eventually Bucky and Tony had decided to work in their relationship together which delighted Steve so the pair started to hang out more. And then they were hanging out as a group and it was nice. They laughed a lot and got into small little fights (the playful kind), and they cuddled on the couch sometimes because they were all touched starved.
Tony sat down. All they had gotten was one bad diagnose after another and now she was telling him that everything was going to be ok. Don’t think Tony didn’t have a shit ton of guilt over Rhodey condition. “I’ll call her,” he croaked out.
“Why doesn’t Loki come to school with me,” Peter asked twirling around on a spinning chair on New Years, “we’re known as a STEM school, but they’ve opened up an arts section of school as well. It’s supposed to foster diversity of ideas and encourage partnership between multiple industries, or something.”
Loki nodded as he sat up. “Got to use some words Lo. Can’t tell if you’re nodding to pain or being healed correctly,” Tony pointed out.
Sam nodded. Natasha shooed Tony and Bruce out. “Bruce was just being whiny,” she complained dumping a bag of grease onto the bed Loki was occupying, “he knew what he was doing just fine.”
Loki placed a quilting spell on his feet and let them dance across the room for one last time. He would not be dancing freely again. Could not dance freely again. If Thor learned about his dance then he might twist it into something dark.
She peaked at Steve’s drawing and then took a picture of it, before floating out the door. Bucky and Steve followed her.
I’m glad you’re back at the compound, I don’t like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I’ve been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere – even in the Army. My faith is in people, I guess. Individuals. And I’m happy to say for the most part, they haven’t let me down. Which is why I can’t let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but – maybe they shouldn’t. I know I hurt you Tony. I guess I thought – by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but… I can see now I was really sparing myself. I’m sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you were only doing what you believe in, and that’s all any of us can do, it’s all any of us should. So no matter what, I promise if you -- if you need us. If you need me, I’ll be there.
“In secret behind Frigga and Thor’s back, Odin made me to be Thor’s tool. The creature that will show him how to become a barbarian. I did everything to prevent that day from coming. I’ve used my lying and tricks and cleverness to keep Thor off the throne to keep him from becoming Odin. I killed Laufey in order to assure that. And it was wasted. All I did is wasted.”
Steve looked out into the yard. “Bucky and I are going to head to Wakanda after Thanksgiving. We’re going to have dinner at Rebecca’s house, and head out to the quinjet afterward, stay in Wakanda for a week. I’m not sure exactly what Shuri said, but between the Colonizer and stupid holiday, I think she said that if we were going to choose such a horrible family holiday we should come to see them. So we are.”
“I need to tell you what happened,” Loki informed him, “and you can’t say anything until I’m done, because once I start I won’t be able to stop, and if you try to stop me I will break. Do you understand?”
Tony looked at the book. The cover when Thor had set it down had shown Loki casually sitting in a throne looking smug. Now Loki was tied down to the throne in some kind of messed up German dungeon porn scene tears leaking down his face.
Peter felt himself bounce with excitement. “And this one,” Rhodey announced pulling the last book out of Peter’s lap with a fond smile, “is your Dad’s first chemistry book from MIT.”
Loki went shake her outstretched hand, but as soon as his fingertips brushed against hers she froze. Loki jerked back, but she closed her hand around his wrist. Loki froze as he searched her eyes. “Magic Child?” He asked.
Sam honestly doubted that. Nothing about Loki added up. “Alright,” he agreed, “I helped a brainwashed tortured prisoners of war turned assassin get his life together. I don’t think I have a place to think about morals like that at this point.”
The smirk on her face told Sam she was pleased with herself. “Even like skin. No one will be able to tell the difference unless they touch it. Next week I’ll finish with the technology that’ll make it actually feel like real skin.”
Sam took a second to process that sentence. Even when he had joined the Avengers he had not been expecting to have to talk about real actual magic and this just wasn’t his stick, but Sam ignored that and forced himself to think through what Loki had told him. “Ok so if your tethered you have to be tethered to something.”
Dummy wandered over and beeped at Steve. Steve patted the robot's side. “Really Dummy you to,” Tony complained, “why do I even keep you.”
“Nervous, but we are building up to everything, right? Steve and I do therapy every week so we are working place. I’m pretty sure Natasha and Pepper are writing speeches to yell at all of us. But I have a second teenager coming to live with us in a new house and I’m moving Peter, but yeah that’s great,” Tony answered.
He cast his eyes down. “Some like to play trust games. Pretend they don’t get off on pain. That they care and nurture then they can get off on the pain they caused by their betrayal.”
The next day they repeated the cycle. But Loki stayed long enough to help with the dishes. Pretty soon Sam found that he had a demo god following him around wherever he went. Which was fine. That had been the goal. To get Loki comfortable with him.
Sam brushed Loki’s hair. “Loki, we need you to answer a question for us,” he murmured, “it’s just yes or no.”
Tony started to say technical terms. Shuri looked at him compressively. “I’ll give oh whatever you want.” Tony offered.
“I didn’t realize being an asshole have you a permit to assault teenage girls,” Tony snapped back at the man, “and before you think about saying one more thing to my Niece I want you to think about how you are going to explain attempted assault and battery to a courtroom, because you can bet your ass I have that on film.”
The rest of the Avengers jumped out of their seats all yelling congratulations at once. They ignored the interviewer who turned to the camera. “Thank you for tuning in today I’m Daniel Fox from CNN I’d say god bless, but I think he already has.”
The smile drifted off of Wanda’s face. “Yes,” she agreed, “there was an incident with one of the professors and his inappropriate behavior to me that got me in contact with a few of the amazing women at the university, but this news channel already covered that story.”
Steve leaned forward and nipped the finger that was aiming for his nose. Bucky made an ungodly yipping noise.
He glanced down at the plate Sam had gotten. It looked a lot more appetizing. “Wanda helped Bruce make the vegetarian dishes,” Natasha noted.
Rylie has thought the same thing. Had wanted the same thing, but they hadn’t dreamed of adoption. They were barley married. “That sounds great,” Sam agreed.
Then he slipped away. Tony looked at the bottle of vodka longingly before picking it up and headed back to the bar. Both Clint and Scott were working now. Tony signed over at Clint, but it was Scott who made his way over. “My Boss hates you,” he announced happily grabbing the vodka, “is this Natasha’s?”
Natasha got Peter into the bathroom before he got sick again this time managing to get it into the toilet. He whined softly. “I know Baby,” Natasha sooth watching the bath filled with water.
Loki gave him an exasperated look. Really Loki had the best bitch face Sam had ever seen, including Tony’s. This was a relatively new thing for Loki to do and Sam derived more pleasure than he ought to from it.
“Natasha introduced Laura and I years ago,” Pepper smiled, “ever since then the three of us started to go on girls getaway trips a couple times each year, and when Peter started coming around we invited May.”
Rhodey walked over and slipped a hand over Peter’s mouth. “Well, I haven’t seen my kid in about a year,” Scott stated, “so if you don’t mind, I’d like to get to her?”
Tony rubbed her arms. “Of course you should have been here,” he answered, “if-if Steve was here you’d still be Peter’s Mom. Peter would just have a third parent.”
Loki nodded and skittered out of the room. She turned on Sam. “Are you going to tell me that thing after you’ve told your mother,” she asked.
Sam didn’t bother trying to understand what she was doing while she tinkered with the arm. “So I finished the hologram covering,” she declared, “so you’ll be able to make your arm look like anything you want.”
It was silent for a couple of heartbeats. Bucky shifted and leaned over Steve to give Tony a kiss on the lips. “Good Night Tony.”
Loki followed Sam to the couch and sat on the floor next to Sam’s feet. Natasha and Steve stared at him. It was what Bucky had done with Steve when he was set free. He hadn’t believed he deserved comforts even when there was plenty available. Then Bucky walked in. He was stiff wearing a pink hello kitty sweater and a purple skirt because he had no sense of fashion when he didn’t want to. His hair was pulled up and was carrying the fuzziest blanket that Sam had ever found and given away as a gift.
Sam rubbed his face. “Recovering from the effects of trauma in the best circumstances is horrible. In Loki’s case, he is surrounded by people who were once his enemies an now act as his caretakers. There haven't been any interactions to help bridge that change either. His brain is constantly telling him he’s in danger whenever he interacts with people, so when that’s over he shuts down. I’m not that surprised honestly.”
Loki felt sick. His legs felt uneasy so he locked them. Tony shrugged and threw the book onto the counter. “You look like you could use three days sleep to,” the black man said to Loki, “Tony which room do you want to put him in?”
Then one day this guy shows up on the roof and Tony goes out to greet him. They walk into the kitchen together and the guy beams at Peter “I know you,” he exclaimed, “you’re adorable!”
Loki was seventeen, had six children and two wives who were all killed by his father. “Wait how old is Thor supposed to be then,” Clint demanded walking in.
Natasha recognized it as Sam buckling down for a long fight. She had seen him do it time and time again and she hoped that it wouldn’t lead to his downfall and feared the day it did. She leaned her head against his chest and they waited.
Sam noted the look in his eyes. “Yeah,” he agreed, “you should have seen him six months ago. He was insufferable.”
Pepper and Tony called Rhodey as they went to their room. “He called us Mom and Dad Rhodey Bear,” Tony announced once he saw his best friend on the screen.
Bucky stared down the street disinterested. It wasn’t a particularly busy night, but it wasn’t dull either. Natalia was inside patrolling, Clint was bartending, Wanda was running the coffee shop downstairs and Scott was fixing something on the roof.
He stuck there and kicked his legs up so his feet cling to the ceiling. Tony hadn’t replied yet. “Mr. Stark?” He looked down.
Tony looked at him with stars in his eyes and the biggest smile he had ever seen. “We can make that happen.”
To Tony’s surprise, the little puzzles helped and he didn’t feel the need to talk a mile a minute as strongly as he usually did.
Laura laughed and leaned forward to hug the young woman. “We’re glad you're here,” she answered, “now how about I show you Grandma Barton’s chili’s recipe?”
“The glass on the ceiling are all solar panels. Tony said if I’m going to go around calling myself The Falcon I need a bird’s nest. It’s a bit too unconventional for me.”
“Well, I was worried about that for a while too,” Peter agreed flipping over a plate in his hand and letting it rest in his palm, “but then I kind of realized that nothing is going to leave me unless I want it to, so...”
No Mom he didn’t really destroy New York I promise. Except Loki didn’t walk through the door. Not really. Sam knew it was Loki because of the green eyes, the same height, weight, and stature. The posture was the same, but Loki’s skin was the same color as his and his facial features reminded Sam of one of his nephews. “Sam how in hell do you have a kid,” Sarah demanded.
Loki and his sister and Mom introduced themselves a bit more and before he knew it Loki had charmed them. Sam eventually got them all off the phone. “I am sorry for appearance,” Loki said as soon as he hung up, “but I did not think my face would be a welcome sight.”
“Trust me, Pete, she is going to love you. Now go make sure you have everything in a bag you want on you when we move, who knows what could get lost and who I’m going to get fired.”
So Sam filled out the paperwork and Natasha and Loki went online shopping for school supplies and they scheduled Loki’s classes. “Peter you’re going to have to keep an eye on Loki,” Tony said the day before they were set to go for the winter semester, “he can’t defend himself.”
As fall started to melt away Natasha left for a mission in Tokyo. It caught Sam off guard when he realized how much Loki missed her and how much he missed her as well. Despite that they went on with their lives. Natasha had important work to do and they would be ready when she came home.
Rhodey looked over at Sam with a long-suffering look. “Can you save the racist Tweets until after we finished coffee,” Sam demanded.
Loki nodded and took his backpack from Natasha and went outside. Natasha slunk her way under Sam’s arm and pulled him into a hug. “Today will go well,” she stated more to assure herself than him.
Steve snorted, “group therapy and weekly mandatory family dinners. I think that was the goal of that.”
Soon a Friday came and Clint and Scott burst into their apartment carrying bags and suitcases. “What’s that,” Steve inquired only glancing up from where he was doodling on Bucky’s arm.
“Sleepless in Seattle,” Rhodey answered as Wanda carried the bowl over to Peter before dragging him out of the room before following Pepper’s signature to the theater room.
She kissed his cheek and walked out to her car before driving away. Sam walked back into the house and found Loki laying on the couch. “I made apple pie while you were gone,” he announced, “want to bring it in here so we can eat it while you tell me how it went.”
After that the approved version of the accords was passed there was a lot more video calling. Tony didn’t like Peter seeing it and Tony said he was working on a new home for them because apparently, everything else was full of bad memories and not homely enough but whatever. Peter wasn’t allowed to know what it looked like or any of the plans. Which wasn’t fair at all, by the way.
He almost dropped the tray of cookies when she walked in his eyes going wide. The only thing that saved the treats was Rhodey’s watchful eye to catch them as Peter abandoned them and stumbled over.
Sometimes Loki is okay at Tony’s and sometimes he’s not. Today was facing to be a pretty good day. The Younglings as Tony called them were off in the theater room, Peter was holding a vine and meme class again. Loki and Wanda didn’t get it the same way Peter did, but it was close enough for the three of them to communicate. Peter had sputtered a lot when Loki had walked in, but really took it all in stride. So Loki was fine and Sam relaxed with Steve on the patio. Bucky and Clint were having a shoot match with paint balls down on the grass bellow. Tony and Rhodey were making dinner with Bruce's help while Pepper started in on the wine. Laura had the kids somewhere in the house drawing or something. Natasha was still gone, but Sam knows she’ll be back as soon as possible. Jane and Darcy were in the kitchen’s living room with Pepper, not drinking but enjoying the company.
“Pepper got everyone tickets to see Swan Lake tonight,” Tony explained his eyes sparkling, “it’s your congratulations for dealing with trauma celebration night. Which needs a better name SAM,” Tony yelled the last part glaring at the other man.
“You can do knife tricks for the bar,” Steve suggested to Bucky in Russian turning the drawing around.
Sam did look into the arts program that Peter’s school was opening. Dance and theater, regular arts and creative writings, computer design and all of those things. “Lo,” Sam sighed on the third of January as Loki watched the snowfall on the weather channel.
“We’ve been working on the serum… we wanted to make sure we didn’t lose you like we lost Howard.” The man explained, waiting for Tony to take another bite before he continued. “We started with the de-aging mechanism, did it on Carol first ‘cause we didn’t want to hurt you.”
They’d gone to a warehouse where T’Challa had helped the mutant leave, and Tony had started to transfer Jarvis to Wakanda with the help of the princess and his kid. They had been cleaning up the warehouse when the former Avengers had attacked. Peter had called him dad.
Bucky chuckled, leaning so that he could meet Tony’s eyes from above him. “Maybe you can program those bots to help us out in battle, make some new ones for the training session?”
“Steve,” Tony whispered reverently, hands clutching onto the man as if he were the only thing keeping Tony tied to the earth.
No one was looking for him. They knew that Tony was with a mutant (genetically enhanced, but Peter didn’t have to explain that to anyone), but not what he looked like. Hell, even the picture they had broadcast of Tony was old. The billionaire’s hair had grown to fall in styled waves to his ears, the goatee replaced with stubble. No one was after Peter.
The blue eyes were twinkling with a warmth that Tony hadn’t seen in quiet a while, and something in his stomach burned at the thought that the man next to him thought he was in love with Tony. Was obsession love?
Moments later, the green light lit the room. Unlike the people before her, the woman did not scream. It was evident that it took all her willpower to hold it in. Tony did not look away, holding her desperate gaze with his own.
Thank you for the kudos, comments, subscriptions, and bookmarks! I haven't proofread this chapter, so there may be some minor errors. Otherwise, enjoy.
Instead of looking concerned, the teenager merely shrugged and turned on her heel, making her way to where they had started to lay out the different weapons they had been working on for the Avengers.
Tony must have looked confused, because Bucky reached forward and gently brushed some hair behind his ear before encouraging him to take another bite.
Instead of answering the question, Peter turned away from where he’d been watching the man and opened his arms to Tony. Instantly and without hesitation, the genius pulled him away from the highchair, setting the toddler on his lap instead.
“Bucky?” Tony spoke after a moment; the brunette having only sat on the edge of the bed. “Do you mind if we eat in here today? I’m just… tired?”
The first night hadn’t been terrible. He’d already fallen asleep from the film and had barely budged when someone had pulled him into their arms once the film was over. In fact, Tony had curled into the warmth with a hum, ignoring all the warning signs as he took comfort in the person carrying him.
“We’re going to go finish his room across the hall,” Steve nodded. “Buck will make dinner, it’ll just be us tonight.”
Tony feels a panic attack starting to come on, the oxygen mask substantially helping keep it under control as he cranks his neck back and forth looking for an exit. Instead, he finds the door opening and the last people he wants to see entering the room.
“But Tony, Strange said you lost a lot of blood. You should rest, just a little bit.” Rhodey insisted.
Through a series of letters, numbers, and sequences they took a good fifteen minutes before the application to transfer was complete. The collection of data had reached ninety-nine point five by the time the group had finished. It wasn’t an easy job, but with the trio at the keys it seemed like transferring Jarvis to Wakanda wouldn’t be an issue.
His muscles had locked, and all he could do was helplessly watch the screen from the confinement of his blanket.
He went to sleep alone that night, and the cold of the room haunted Tony. Curled up under the covers of the huge bed, he felt the emptiness that the absence of the two men left behind. It was strange, feeling a small pang of hurt in his chest at the idea that he’d be sleeping alone. He’d grown so used to their warmth.
There was a shared moment of silence, both lost in their thoughts. The two seemingly replaying the events that had just happened and what they meant. Despite their efforts, the former Avengers were breaking through both their walls, and both had forgotten their true status in the home during the adventures in the backyard.
The room filled with a comfortable silence for only a moment, everyone enjoying just being in the company of the other, before the genius spoke.
“If I may sir, I’m glad that you have made it here safely,” the words rang throughout the warehouse, although no one seemed startled by the AI’s sudden reappearance.
Knowing that keeping his eyes open will only cause discomfort and possibly nausea, Tony closes his eyes and lets himself get lifted from the bed and into the chair. Immediately, a heavy blanket is thrown over him, whomever does it tucking the edges over his shoulders and feet, so he is completely covered.
There was a moment where Steve had to rip the arms from two as they tried to play a game of tug-a-war with his limbs. The tap on the shoulder had him pivoting with the metal in his hands, unable to stop the fist that connected squarely to his face.
The building shook again, and Tony took in the craft that had already lifted off the ground. Rhodey stood on the ramp, War Machine completely destroyed on the ground below. The man held out a hand, as if waiting for them to reach him so he could pull the two to safety.
While his body is still heavy, head still stuffy and eyes half lidded, he is more aware of the man in the bed with him.
“Well, they may have the muscle, but we have the brains.” The little boy giggled, pointing a finger at his head. “So why don’t we play into their game?”
Nodding along, Peter swept under the arms and onto his feet, turning so he could face Tony whom was still leaning on the now empty chair. “And you can’t genius without a brain, too!”
However, that didn’t stop him from noticing the blond and brunette that hadn’t stop their sudden trek directly at him.
Bruce, having worked with Helen for so long outside of being the Hulk, had picked up several good skills. In moments he had finished stitching Tony up and turned to help the nurse they’d called in to take care of the other team members.
He didn’t resist as tears of his own started to fall down his face. “You’re my family. You’re the only people in this world that give me a reason to live. I can’t sit by and know that you’re in danger because of me, when I could have prevented it. I love you so much,” Tony laughed, finally raising a hand to wipe away at the tears on his face. “Thank you for showing me that men of iron can bend.”
When they had finished, Steve had looked at him, waited, and received a glare. The heat from the look would have been enough to melt metal if it had had the power, unfortunately it only caused the super soldier to call out again.
Wanda let go of his hand, stepping back to join her brother. “And if you’re here, that means Carol sent you.”
The plush carpeting of the room was a soft beige, complimented by a large sapphire rug that covered a huge part of the floor. A bed that could easily fit six people had been set in the middle of the wall to his left, the duvet an off white with patterned silver and azure pillows. Mahogany bed posts that had been obviously carved by hand stretched almost to the ceiling, only hidden by a soft canopy that swayed softly from the air conditioning.
Instead, the monster pivoted and started down the hall, as if searching for something more. And Tony froze, realizing exactly what was happening and bringing Peter to a halt beside him. There was a time when he had trusted the scientist. He had told the man all about Jarvis, proud of his baby and not one to keep a brag to himself with an invention he was proud of.
Sauntering behind Shuri, he listened as she rambled about how the system update had originally gone. How they had temporarily released Jarvis so that he could control and help Tony escape from the facility in which he was held.
Little arms crossed over the tiny chest, brown eyes narrowed and focused, hiding a touch of anger behind the gaze. Peter would never admit that his bottom lip jutted out slightly, creating what was definitively an adorable pout on his cherubic face.
His forehead rested gently on the kid’s collarbone, and with a start Tony realized that Peter was finally taller than him.
“Mr. Parker has been gone for approximately ten minutes, sir. He jammed my system so that I could not inform you of the revelation until now.” Jarvis explained.
The first thing he noticed was that they didn’t just hold weapons (he refused to touch one, unless it came in his suit). One of the containers held a collection of vintage cars that made him ache inside for his own collection, back when he’d been free to do as he wanted.
"You don't want to believe me? Fine," the General said with a filthy grin. "Go ahead, go live on C-53. That should have been your rightful place all along. We thought you were a success, but apparently, our technology wasn't ready yet. You are nothing but another failed experiment, Ann-Tho."
He stumbled to the left and Steve immediately stepped back defensively. But when he spoke his voice had that coach tone he liked to bring out when they were exercising. "You're leaving your right completely open when dodging," he said. "I could have easily brought you down to the mat if I had wanted to."
"No, it's fine. My bed is big enough for the two of us." Steve chuckled and Tony realised that Steve had just managed something resembling a laugh for the first time in days. Even if it was only a small one. Then Tony became aware of what he had been laughing at and his eyes widened in shock. "I didn't mean it that way! I swear I didn't!" The single brain cell in Tony's head that hadn't been flooded with sudden panic wasn't enough to fathom whether he really hadn't meant it that way, or whether damage control was speaking out of him. But Steve didn't seem to be further bothered by Tony's suggestive remark. On the contrary. He kicked his shoes off his feet and slid back on the bed to make himself comfortable on the pillow. Tony quickly picked up the circuit board, the box of screws and the screwdriver before Steve lay down on it.
Tony's insides, which had tensed up so much when Steve had been talking about Barnes, loosened a little. Steve wasn't good at admitting that he was in over his head, he always wanted to manage everything on his own. Yet he had come here, deliberately to Tony's private room, and had asked him of all people for help. A gesture Tony treasured and one that gave him back a little of the comfortable warm feeling he'd been missing ever since Barnes had popped up on the radar.
Sam left and went to find Loki. “Hey Lo,” he called waking into the guest room where Loki laid on the floor with his older niece and cousins’ sons.”
“He did turn your sister into a murdering bloodhound and then banish her,” the women by his side interrupted.
There was a banner that said It’s a boy! With the boy crosses off and written above it, It’s an Engagement!
“I know,” Steve answered watching as another man sashayed past him, “do you have a problem with that?”
Tony cleared his throat. “The kid is a little excited,” he warned, “he made cookies and Rhodey helped I guess. If you want to rest before seeing everyone else that’s fine.”
A day later Dr. Strange was long gone, that book was locked away in a vault twenty stories underground and Loki’s eyes flitted open. “Hey Lo,” Sam greeted.
“T’Challa’s not wife,” Bucky stated, “and not girlfriend, and not lover, but they are hopelessly obviously in love and totally admit it. I fear the day she meets Natalia. The world doesn’t stand a chance. They gotta be the best spys in the world.”
Her eyes drifted to him. “It’s fine Mr. Barnes,” she replied, “I’ve seen a lot worse form Rhodey and Tony, believe me.”
Loki crept in. “The first hundred years after I lost Angrboda I kept her favorite earrings on me at all times,” he whispered sitting beside him, “it was as if I let them go I would be letting her go. I imagine my face looked like how yours does now when I decided to tell Thor. Who have you decided to tell?”
So the day passed quickly and so did going to college with Tony. Which turned out to be fun. He had no idea what he was doing. Not really, but neither had Steve so she wasn’t disappointed. “I don’t think college worked like this when I went,” Tony complained glaring at the admissions lady who had been trying to explain that they did not appreciate fake name on tours.
Tony had started to hyperventilate, a bumbling mess of fear as his eyes met the floor, refusing to make eye contact with anyone in the room.
Thank you for all the kudos, comments, bookmarks. Glad you're enjoying it :) I already wrote the next chapter... let’s just say Tony Stark is quite spunky >;)
Inwardly, the genius had cursed the Avengers as he did his best to keep Peter distracted. So, unlike most days, he’d gone to sleep without worrying about nightmares, exhausted.
Startled, Tony jumped up from where he sat hunched over Natasha’s widow bites, yelping when he almost torched his hand.
Knowing that he couldn’t fight it, Tony had merely nodded at the words and followed the former American hero down the hall. Everything was back to how it had been, where most, if not all, of the team made an effort for mealtimes together.
True to his word, Rogers had only brought along the original team and no one else. True to his word, Tony appeared in the suit, alone.
“Come on Tony, let’s just calm down.” Steve added, taking a step closer and stopping as the smaller man took another back, closer to the hall and stairs.
With one arm wrapped snugly around Peter’s waist, the soldier spun on his heel and carried the child away from the room towards the kitchen, intent on getting some of the cookies done before Tony woke. He figured having something from the kiddo would make the older genius a little happier when he found himself in bed with a super soldier.
When he opens his eyes, they’re moving down the hallway. He knows because Clint is once again pushing the chair, the soft noises he’s making under his breath reminding Tony of the first time the archer pushed him.
The barrier around the home was obviously magic, and last he had checked neither of them had the power to counter magic. If time was going to pass, why not use it to their advantage?
With a frown, the genius glanced up to see a smiling brunette staring down at the two of them on the bed. He finally managed to pull enough away to look at the two, processing what he was seeing.
“Tony!” He screamed as he was tackled from behind, the com dislodging and falling to the ground as Peter rolled to remove his attacker.
Her beautiful green eyes turned to face the blond, determination ready. “You will burn in hell for your crimes.” She spat.
She giggled, taking Sam’s hand and disappearing into the hall as both Steve and Clint appeared, a little startled from where the other two had gone.
She exhaled a heavy breath. "I told the Board before the gala last night. Half of them didn't believe me. The other half were stunned into silence."
"A family," he said, a little flat and a little despondent. "Just a… Not with y—? She wasn't o— I mean, obviously. It was just a stupid dre—" He clamped his mouth shut and shook his head again. "She tell you that?" he asked when he'd finally gotten a hold of himself.
"I know, and I understand that, and I wouldn't want him to change, to be honest. He wouldn't be the man I fell in love with if he did. And that's not…" He frowned a little and went contemplative. "That's not like hoping he'll stop drinking or stop hitting you or stop cheating on you. It's not something that makes you wonder if he's even worth sticking it out for. He's too honest. So the fuck what? If that's the worst thing I can say about him, then I think I lucked out pretty damned well in the marriage department."
"Swell," he muttered. Twenty minutes felt long enough to him. And he was actually still a little tired. "Have they all been weeded out and rounded up?"
But as much of an ass as Steve could be behind the wheel, Tony still trusted him. He wasn't a huge fan of letting other people drive him, and much as he might have teased Steve about his driving skills, he was actually more than OK with them. Not only were Steve's reflexes sharp as a tack, but he knew Steve was not about to let anything bad happen to him. Besides, it could have been worse. Steve could have insisted on them taking his fucking
Tony nodded and said, "OK, J, we're ready— But don't send it 'til I get back here with the tablet. I'm thinking this is something Steve and I want to find out together."
"Sort of a late-in-life kid. Mistake at the bottom of a whiskey bottle. One of those things. Maybe both."
Natasha simply rolled her eyes and accused him of being paranoid when he tried to get her to level with him later that afternoon, and Barton just snorted a laugh and agreed with Natasha's assessment when he finally sank to the level of trying to ask the birdbrain about it.
, of all places!), but he knew that this camaraderie was not based solely on that. It was not based solely on what they could get from him. It wasn't even because he was Steve's other half and they had to humor Steve to stay in his good graces.
"The..." He motioned to DUM-E with his flesh hand. "You don't really mean that — that you just think of it as an overgrown bucket of bolts. You really like it."
She looked up at him and very earnestly babbled something at him that he thought was supposed to be a question, but the words just didn't translate in his head, and he shrugged at her and said, "I'm sorry. I'm not your real dad, so I don't know what you're— Does he usually understand what you're saying?"
The creature against him began to stir, moaning or whining or grumbling or some combination of all three as he turned his face toward Steve's chest and pressed into him. Steve held his breath — oh, God, had someone found out about his…? — and waited for the person to still, and soon enough, the sounds and the movements stopped. He relaxed again, exhaling the breath with as little effort as he could muster, and eyed up his surroundings to figure out his best way of escaping.
Somebody whistled from the phone Rhodey was holding. Tony couldn't actually tell which one of them had done it. He took several long strides over to where Steve stood, Steve's eyes raking over his form, his mouth having a hard time staying closed, and as everyone took their places for the ceremony, Steve was finally able to utter, "You look amazing."
"Coloring." And then her tears were all but forgotten as her voice went all sorts of high and excited and she said, "Wanna see the pitcher I drew, Unca Bruce? It's all the 'vengers."
He squinted at the watch face and tried to make out if he was reading it the right way. "Why are you awake this early?"
But Steve nodded and said, "I know I can be reckless." He looked up at Tony again. "I know I— I know I can't keep doing that. I know I have to—"
He huffed and rolled his eyes again and said, "Fine. But I'm telling her that letting her starve is all your idea."
the baby, and I just— We'd have all this stuff hanging around, all this stuff that would remind us, and—" He shook his head again. "No. No one's buying anything. No one's throwing any baby showers for anyone — at least not until after the baby's born."
blabbed to him — not to mention the fact that Steve was barely out of Tony's sight those days. He went on the odd mission, he went through practice runs with the team (including Barnes, whose grudgingness to go along had dissipated quite a bit over the course of the summer), he discussed tactics and strategy for potential targets or missions they might find themselves on at some later date, but more often than not, he was in the penthouse watching TV while Tony puttered around cleaning and straightening (Barton, that asshole, insisted he'd entered the 'nesting stage' of the pregnancy, whatever that meant) or in Tony's lab drawing while Tony stared at his screen and pretended like he was working on projects for the gang (only computer solitaire seemed to be able to hold his attention nowadays).
"Why?" Steve asked earnestly as he weaved them through the crowd. "The only people that matter will know where to find us if they need us."
This one was a little different from the other lackeys, smaller, thinner, and she grinned at Tony, now trapped in a darkened hallway on the 51st floor, and said in a weirdly familiar voice that he now realized had a hint of an accent, "You know, you were worth so much more to us when your Captain was still alive."
certain things, but he was green with that sort of shit, and I get the feeling that agent wasn't. I don't mean to call her character into question. She was—" He whistled. "Steve knew how to pick 'em." He then added knowingly to Tony, "I guess he still does."
But Tony had, in the years after his stupid and juvenile crush on the good Captain, developed a bit of an animosity toward him. Fuck, Howard had only known the guy a couple years, and for all he knew, Howard was making up most of that shit because Howard… Who the hell knew what he was thinking? But Tony had grown to dislike the Captain. He hadn't bothered to continue his father's attempts to find the old bag of bones because what was the fucking point? Ooh, yay, he'd bring a dead war hero home for a proper burial. Big deal. It was a pointless and wasted endeavor that cost more money than it would ever be worth in the long run. Obie — fucking Obie — had just said Howard would be disappointed in him, but he didn't try to stop him at any rate.
jumped on top 'f Daddy. 'n' then he put his arms around us like this—" she sat up and hugged her arms tightly around her torso and rocked herself from side-to-side a little bit, "—'n' said he was never, ever gonna let us go. But he did. 'cuz he broke th' shirt. 'member, Papa?"
He didn't want to die, and especially not without Steve there, not without saying 'goodbye.' But he didn't want to die — not under these circumstances. He wanted to live. He wanted to see his child — after everything he'd gone through the last nine-and-a-half months, it was the absolute least he figured he deserved — and he wanted to cradle his child and hold his child and shelter his child from everything awful in the world. And there was a lot — dear god, was there a lot! He knew he couldn't protect him from everything, but he wanted to live — he needed to live — to be for his child what his father never was for him, to be for his child what his mother (holy hell, if only she could see him now!) had been for him and more.
Steve took a deep breath and nodded, exhaling the breath in resignation rather than relief. "If that's what you want," Steve said.
"Aren't babies born with blue eyes?" Barnes asked from where he stood over by the workstation table, arms still folded as he leaned back against it.
"Goddamn it!" he said and pulled away. He went to wipe away the tears with his hand, but Hill produced a tissue, and said, "Dab, don't wipe. Nat and I spent a lot of time on that makeup."
He grabbed a pair of pajama bottoms out of a drawer and put them on. He'd go down to the lab. He'd tinker. Maybe he could figure out some way of fixing himself the old-fashioned way. With actual science, not fucking magic mumbo-jumbo.
He considered this a moment and shrugged. Sure, he would definitely paint himself with a gigantic target on his back, but—
Tony hummed as he shoved a bite of pancake into his mouth and savored the syrupy goodness, an array of breakfast foods spread before him. Beside him Steve, shed of the white bathrobe he'd pulled on to answer to door and not horrify (or entice) the person that had come to deliver their room service, sat in all his gorgeous, naked, alabaster glory as he scrolled through various news feeds and social media alerts on his tablet, a concerned look on his face and a slice of bacon halfway to his mouth.
the stench and sleaze of the club on him, so he stripped out of the rest of his clothes and jumped in the shower.
Plus, you've already seen and fondled everything there is to see and fondle down there. If I can't trust you—"
"Why do you suddenly have a problem with 'L's—? Hey! Wait, no, Papa's too old for you to do that!" he said and tried to stop her from pulling him out of the chair. "Give Papa a second."
Thor smiled, clearly believing Steve's lie without issue. Jim just turned his disbelief on Steve and said a wary, "Right."
Tony pulled away from Steve to check on the progress Barnes had made. "Eh, a little more. Try to get them a little brown and crispy."
He again was cut short by Steve kissing him, and he relaxed once more, pressing his torso against Steve's, humming a little as Steve pushed into his mouth and dug his fingers into the exposed flesh of Tony's back.
Tony made a face and said, "Yeah, that's great, Brucie, but I don't think Barnes and Romanova are going to want to stand here holding my legs like this for the next several hours. That, and I don't want to lay here like this the next several hours. And I have to pee."
He looked between Bruce and Rhodey. "Is she back-talking me? Am I getting back-talk from a four-year-old?"
He sighed and trailed off as he ran a hand through his hair. This was not the sort of weirdness he'd pictured back in Calcutta at all.
Wanda snorted. Sam smiled at the reporter, “we’re doing good. Everyone is excited to have Steve and Bucky home. Now we are trying to get into a rhythm.”
He was not playing Kidz Bop, he just had a teen who liked to memorize the routines. Sam sat on the bed and opened the facetime app. His Mom and sister’s face peered at him on the screen. “You’re in trouble,” Sarah cooed.
I have an idea where I'm taking this now, so while I can't promise quick updates, I can promise that it WILL get updated. Thank you for enjoying my twisted story and I hope you keep enjoying it. You guys are AWESOME!
Without hesitation, the security detail began to escort the group out of the room. Amidst protests and fear, the former Avengers watched as the men disappeared down the hall.
With the ramp fully open, Tony didn’t hesitate. He threw himself from the seat and scrambled to get to the ramp. He needed to get Rhodey on the craft before it took off.
However, when Tony opened his eyes, he realized that they were on the second film and Peter also looked half asleep. Both Bucky and Steve weren’t aware of his waking, as they were sharing self-satisfied smiles between themselves.
The images from the films started to merge with those he’d seen in his real life, and Tony couldn’t withhold the whimper as he scooted into whomever was curled behind him.
The video part of the thing was a hologram that displayed so that whomever was on the other end looked to be standing in the room with whomever they were talking to. Peter had jumped up and down when Tony appeared on his end.
There was no surprise that the nickname Tony had given Carol was quickly discovered by the rest of the team. Bucky had been the one to step forward and ask about its origin, wanting to make sure that nothing was amiss amongst their genius and the newly de-aged super-powered girl.
It took another hour before the soldier actually sank under, allowing Tony to quietly do as was requested and squeeze his hand twice tightly.
"I don't give a damn what you think you know about me," Tony said. "In case I haven't made myself clear: I resign. As commander and as your
Steve's fist came hurtling towards him and Tony quickly ducked under it. With the momentum he gained as he straightened back up, he himself tried to place a punch just below Steve's bent elbow. But Steve dodged it by almost casually turning to the side and his next punch hit Tony in the ribs.
Hearing that from her, of all people, was almost funny in Tony's ears. She may have thoroughly covered most of her tracks, but Tony was, after all, a descendant of one of the most evolved humanoid races in the universe. His comm might have only limited functions, but even those still seemed vastly superior to the technology of humans. Tony had made it a ritual to flip through the "secret" and "missing" files of his teammates every night in bed and had discovered a lot about them that he was pretty sure they would never want to share with the team. No one here, not even American Idol Steve Rogers, had a clean slate. He had no intention of telling any of them, but the mission he had been given by the general had been very clear. Get to know them, screen them, assess them. That was all he was planning to do.
Tony grinned, tossed his water bottle back towards the bench and stood up. He barely had time to process what was happening before Steve had an arm wrapped around his middle. With all his body weight he had tackled him head-on and thrown him backwards. Tony just managed to press his chin on his chest to avoid slamming hard into the mats with the back of his head.
"I could establish one. C-53 is closer to Tarnax II than Hala. It could give us an advantage and buy some time when the Skrull venture out of hiding again." Although Tony's reasoning was coherent, his stomach tightened at the suggestion. That he was using a strategic advantage in the war against Steve's race as an argument to be with Steve was a level of hypocrisy that made even him uncomfortable.
"At least now he's listening again." For a moment Tony considered picking up the box and throwing it right back. But to do that he would have to move and he didn't feel like that right now. Instead, he said, "You know, I don't want my brain cells to take irreversible damage from listening to bullshit so sometimes I just shut down when sitting next to you."
Bruce blushed and averted his eyes. Tony heard Steve giggling beside him again. The line hadn't really been that good. But the fact that Captain I-don't-get-that-reference America jumped at even the weakest of his jokes didn't strike him for the first time.
"What do you mean?" he said, still fighting off the General, who seemed to have really worked himself up into a rage. His face had turned dark and the veins at both his temples stood out, but he didn't answer. In a trained smooth movement, Tony grabbed his wrist and twisted his arm behind his back leaving him barely able to move. The General might outrank him, but Tony had trained with Captain America. "What do you mean by that?" he repeated his question, his lips close to the General's ear.
Steve did not look at him. He had sat down on the edge of the bed, his legs still on the floor and his back turned to Tony.
"On C-53?!" The General's black eyes seemed to pierce Tony, but he made an effort to withstand the stare.
Steve, apparently completely oblivious to the thoughts he had just evoked in Tony, walked over to the bench where they had stored their things. Wordlessly, Tony reached up and caught the bottle that Steve threw at him a moment later.
"Rejected. You are a commander of the Starforce and therefore you have duties to fulfil. If you need a day off, so be it. But you stay on Hala."
"I miss the Bucky I knew. We grew up together, were always there for each other. I mourned him and at some point, I learned to just live with the feeling that I will never see him again. And all of a sudden he's back, which is great, but he's only a shadow of himself. Or at least of what I remember him to be. And I'm trying to figure out how to deal with that and how we can help him, and at the same time, I'm supposed to be leading the Avengers. I can't do all that, Tony." The words had literally tumbled out of Steve while his voice had become increasingly shaky and Tony felt the broad back under his hand tremble. Steve's eyes were still fixed on his hands and Tony couldn't see his face. But he was sure that if he had been able to look into Steve's eyes, he would have seen tears glistening in them.
"With what exactly? Punching bad guys?" he said, just hoping that the people on C-53 didn't know their way around the Large Magellanic Cloud all that well.
As Steve lunged for his next proper punch, Tony decided to risk it. He dodged the incoming hand and broke his cover for a quick attack, but Steve's other fist hit his chest before Tony had even come close.
"What if anyone finds out about you? They'll behead you straight away." He muttered so no one else would hear them, yet he didn't even dare say the word "Skrull". But Steve just shrugged.
"No. We need you on Hala. You are a commander of the Starforce." The General continued to prepare the upcoming departure in his holographic projection as if the conversation was over with that.
"Of course not, don't be ridiculous," Tony replied, exaggerating when rolling his eyes. "We tried our new highly radioactive technique on my professor." He smirked a little and saw clearly how Bruce's eyes narrowed and how Natasha raised an eyebrow. He wasn't sure if they were expressing appreciation or insanity, so he continued.
Tony kept his eyes fixed on the sturdy sports mat underneath him, trying to bring his breathing back under control, which had stopped briefly when Steve had hit him in the ribs. Anyone else around would probably have been knocked right out by that punch. Except for Thor, maybe.
Tony was distracted. He was confused and hurt by this declaration and it only took this brief moment of insecurity to restore the General's upper hand. With a precise jab, he hit Tony in the ribs with his elbow. Tony stumbled back and lost his footing. Backwards he fell down the steps and landed on the floor below the hexagonal platform. The General looked down at him from above and now it really was hatred that spoke from his eyes. A hatred that Tony didn't see for the first time, but which he had never fully understood.
Tony tried to aim the scanner of his comm in its direction to identify it as well, but it jumped around with great leaps and was difficult to lock on to, despite its size. It took Tony several attempts before the advanced scan captured it.
When the large doors slammed shut behind him, he was already walking along the windowless walls with determination. The General's office still looked exactly as Tony remembered it. It was large and gloomy, with high ceilings and angular columns lining the walls. The metallic lines embedded in the stone floor reflected silvery as he strode over them and towards the large screen in the back of the room. The images that were now flickering across the oversized monitor, were different though. Tony vividly remembered how the General had shown him the footage of Steve and the other original four Avengers when they had defended Earth against the Chitauri. Now Tony could see the pointy ears and greenish skin of Skrulls on there from afar. How very fitting, he thought grimly as he stopped in front of the few steps that led up to the hexagonal platform and the General's huge desk. He sat in his chair behind it, had turned towards the screen and did not pay any attention to Tony.
Between the dust, the flames and the lasers, he couldn't make out much of their faces, but he could make out that they were putting up a very determined fight against the Chitauri. A woman was leaping through the air with ease, dispatching the attackers with her bare hands, Tony saw something large and green that appeared to be neither human nor Chitauri and a man who seemed to be shooting lightning bolts. "Are they human?"
To Tony's right, a public bus had overturned and was now lying lengthways, blocking all traffic on this much larger road. Behind the top, Tony caught a glimpse of the idling cars, their occasional honking mingling with the sounds of fighting. Then he spotted someone standing on the sidewall of the bus. Tony had to squint against the sun and couldn't make out much except for dark clothes and light hair. But he saw the man pulling arrow after arrow out of his quiver, drawing and releasing his bow at a breathtaking speed while the arrows set off small explosions or clouds of smoke on impact. Tony squeezed himself into a niche on the wall of a house and activated the scan on his comm.
"Why should we care?" Tony asked. "It’s obviously not the Skrulls and casual raids happen everywhere every day. C-53 is over 160,000 light-years away from Hala and has neither special resources nor exceptionally dangerous or gifted population that would justify protecting this planet."
"You're still tiny," Clint interjected but the rest of the audience ignored him. Not even Steve chuckled. And Tony continued with his well thought out story.
"So that's why I'm here," Tony said, as it began to dawn on him. "You think they'd fit in well in my Special Unit."
Steve sighed and took another sip of water. Tony watched the light reflect off Steve's damp skin as he waited. He could literally hear it working behind his forehead and didn't want to force him. Finally, Steve opened his mouth and said, "Ever heard of the Winter Soldier?"
Tony gave a weak smile in his direction. "Seemed like a pretty good reason to de-moth the old chum again."
Tony took another dramatic pause to look at each of his teammates individually. Bruce's eyes showed exactly the mixture of dark foreboding and scientific curiosity that Tony had expected. Natasha had clasped her coffee mug with both hands and had brought it up to mouth level, but hadn't taken a sip in what seemed like an eternity. Clint, when everyone had been distracted by the story, had snatched the last slice of pizza and leaned back in his chair. With his feet on the table, he listened while chewing. Steve had his chin propped up in his hand and glanced over his shoulder to look at Tony. Curiosity was written all over his face too, though much more subtly than Bruce's, but it didn't escape Tony's notice. Even Thor, contrary to his previous statement, was listening with intent. He had his arms folded in front of his chest, squeezing the muscles on his upper arms to even more outrageous size with that.
"If you're done looking deep into each other's eyes over there, we could use a little help here," Natasha said. She was aiming both of her guns at the General while Sam, Clint, Thor and Bucky had all four of his limbs firmly pinned against his screen. Images of Skrull were still flickering across it. The General might be stronger than most of them, but with four on one, they could have already taken him down easily. Tony knew it was his verdict they were waiting for.
Tony felt the back of his neck getting hot at the way Natasha's statement scraped much closer to the truth than even she probably suspected. Damn these spy intuitions. But he had donned his poker face."You're right. Turning green and going haywire doing bicep curls with trucks is more like what you're used to. Forgot about that."
Eventually, Steve rolled to the side, still chuckling, and released Tony's body, but remained lying on his back beside him. Tony's right hand was only centimetres away from Steve's head. He could have touched his cheek if he had just stretched his fingers out a little. Something about the thought made him nervous and he felt his heart begin to beat loudly. At the same time, it seemed impossible for him to pull his hand away or even move a single muscle.
Tony turned back to him so quickly he almost snapped his neck. Earlier, in his fury, the General had not elaborated on his insinuations, but now he was pressed into his screen, defeated and probably more willing to talk.
"Where I spend my vacations is none of your business," he said. "Sir," he then added quickly to take the edge off the impertinent statement. But the General's face told him everything he needed to know even before he opened his mouth to say it.
Tony watched him. In sleep, all the worries he was currently carrying around and displaying on his face seemed to have fallen away from him. His forehead was not creased, his shoulders not tense, his jaw not clenched.
The only one other than Steve who was still regularly being watched by Tony was Thor. It had taken Tony exactly three training sessions together to notice that Clint's arsenal was limited to ten different arrows and five different moves. Natasha had considerably more moves to offer but was also out of the question for the Starforce. Tony's unit was specialised in powered people and although both were admittedly very good at what they did, that didn't make them any less human.
"You're lying," Tony interrupted him. "I was born a Kree. My powers are a natural mutation." He didn't know much about his birth or his parentage in General. He knew that his Kree mother had had an affair with a human and had died shortly after he had been born. His powers were the result of regular DNA mutation, just like Kree skin or eyes do tend to mutate and evolve into new colours. Tony couldn't remember a time when he hadn't possessed powers. All his childhood these very special powers had been an issue, how could the General claim anything else now?
." He made an odd motion with his hand like he was demonstrating something. "The lingerie. It's not like that. It's just that it's, I don't know…" He heaved out a defeated breath. "Please don't think I'm a creep. It's not that. It's more like…"
the sparklers on the cake (and he was determined to get those bastards on the cake), and so he'd just gone with twenty-nine, which was, as best Tony could figure, the amount of lived experience Steve actually had (which…yeah, he was

Steve frowned right back, his eyes glistening with unspent tears. "What? What's wrong? Is something wrong? Is something—"
Steve quirked his head at him, and Tony frowned and turned to him and said, "What are you talking about?" He turned back to Steve. "You throw him out of someplace?"
So, to Steve's bemusement, he followed him down to the gym and sat and watched as he ran through some warm-ups then worked at punching the shit out of one of the heavy bags (splitting it at one point and murmuring a not-exactly-earnest, "Sorry," as sand poured from it; Tony waved off his admitted lack of concern and said it was nothing and he'd get it fixed for him).
convincing himself of an impossibility because of the ever-present fear that he couldn't do this alone.
He sighed and sat back in his chair. "Sadly, no. This body is one hundred percent female, which is great for some things and horrible for others. I can't pee standing up, but holy shit, I thought people — and by 'people' I mean 'science' — exaggerated that women have better phalangeal dexterity than men, but turns out, it's totally true. I may not be as strong physically, but working on stuff is
that bad back in those lost years? And you! Tell me, was I that bad? When we first started going out, was I that bad? Was I making derogatory remarks and questionable innuendo?"
For ten years now, he had shared the bedchamber of the King, even though he had been given his own quarters in the castle. He was far and away the King's closest confidant, and the Council had only themselves to blame. Had they gotten rid of the Earl as soon as the new King had been crowned, they could have saved themselves all this trouble—
"Nat might have been," Steve said, but Bruce hedged some and said, "Yeah, but I think she got roped into refereeing the push-up competition."
his body as much as the other one was, and everything that went along with it was part and parcel of who he was. He had created life out of machines before; now he was creating life out of flesh and blood…with a little help from a certain super soldier, at least.
He shook his head. That wasn't fair. That wasn't fair at all. This was a miracle — his and Steve's miracle — and it didn't matter if it wasn't that same little girl that had stolen his heart all those years ago. Some insane creature from the cosmos had felt he and Steve to be so perfectly suited to one another — to be actual 'soul mates' — that she'd taken it upon herself to give one of them a form that would allow them to conceive a child of their love, the highest and most sacred measure two soul mates could undertake — in her mind, anyway. And they'd conceived with ease — maybe a little
"You keep talking about bonds," Bruce said as he munched on his muesli. "What does that mean? How did Steve and Tony even get bonded in the first place?"
Tony tried to match her smile, but all he could see was Bruce, ashen-faced, telling him he was so sorry, and the smile died on his lips. God, he'd been such a desperate, fucking fool to believe...
Steve nodded his understanding then went around Natasha and the table she'd moved to pull the ottoman over then took a seat on the couch beside Tony, moving into his space and resting one arm over the back of the couch as he leaned in and pressed his face into Tony's neck, breathing in the scent before he brushed his lips against the part where his neck met his shoulder.
"Finally," Tony muttered and rolled his eyes. He made to jump up, but his stupid stomach weighed him down, and he grumbled a bit as he struggled out of the chair, finally deigning to let Bruce help him up.
He grinned up at Tony, so proud of his achievement, and Tony could do nothing but shake his head and sigh out a breath.
"I mean, really, if nothing else, that gets you into a super-special and elite club no one else except Bruce and Nat are members of," Tony said, Olivia finally seeming to quiet a little now that he'd given her his finger to suck on. "Not sure if that's a good or a bad thing, but whatever. And weirdly— It's funny, but I have to admit, I was a little jealous when you came back on the scene—"
As Barnes and Natasha went into the kitchen, Barton seemed to realize what that portended, and he turned to Tony and grinned and said, "Oh, man, you're going to
"Birdman or I say 'fuck,' we get lectured about our language. The princess says it, and it's all peachy-keen. You are
Legs still a little shaky after coming down from his two subsequent orgasms, he climbed off the table and gripped it for balance before he turned to Tony, who lay there with his eyes closed and what Steve took as a serene look on his face, red lips formed in a small smile, and he said, "I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna go find something to clean up with."
"Further inland, we think," Hill said and pulled up the next possible list of targets — the ones that made sense based upon the previous systematic disruption of the grid. Tony, chewing another bite of his bagel, tried to follow along and make sense of what he was seeing, but his back was aching a little bit, and as he began to rub at it, Barton got up from his chair and motioned for Tony to sit down. Tony grumbled out a thanks and sat down, heavily and maybe a tad bit petulantly because contrary to all his bravado, he actually wasn't feeling so great. More than that, though, he was irritated that Steve wasn't going to be fulfilling his duties any time soon. Hydra, those sons-of- bitches, had made sure of that, and as soon as Tony could concentrate on something more challenging than a game of computer solitaire, he was going to write up an algorithm to root out every one of these fuckers and take them to task for having the gall to interrupt his time with Steve.
