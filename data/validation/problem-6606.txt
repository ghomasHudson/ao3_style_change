Tony’s staring at him with wide eyes. Steve’s throat is hurting and all closed-up and there are traitorous tears spilling out of his eyes.
“You’re not Schmidt,” she said, and her voice was deep, deeper than Tony’s. Her frail neck had a very visible Adam’s apple.
Tony stopped, listening. The woods were silent and morose, and so very still, as if the animals were all hiding and the trees themselves holding their breath. As Clint, the best huntsman of the village, kept repeating drunkenly during the evening gatherings at the inn, it could mean two things: either there were humans there, making too much noise and scaring the fauna away, either there was something much more sinister, much more dangerous, and that thing was there to hunt you.
And he’s diving right back into a kiss. Shoes, coats, suits, everything is dropped unceremoniously on the floor, and between kisses, Steve gasps;
And though he’s saying this as if teasing, he thinks the lace looks anything but ridiculous on him, despite Tony being muscular and hairy, instead of all curvy and smooth.
Dinner is a happy time. They joke, and sing, and tear into the dinner that Bucky and Steve made, and the meal that has taken so much time to prepare vanishes in an instant. Thor, Natasha, Bucky, and Darcy are now competing over shots of vodka-eggnogs, while Sam is cutting the Christmas cake. Steve passes their shares around, and Clint is already digging in his like an ogre -he was restraining himself from drinking because he and Bobbi were heading home tonight-.
“For Heaven’s sake, Butterhooves, be careful! You’re going to hurt yourself one day! Don’t you know what happens when a horse breaks a leg?”
“Fuck you! You think I have no idea? You think you’re the only precious snowflake on this Earth who’s got depression? Fuck you, Rogers! I got depression when I was twenty-one, asshole, and all thanks to your best pals Howard and fuckin’ BUCKY! I was studying aboard, because I had already graduated from MIT, at seventeen, you know, that’s so sane for a kid, and then your fuckin’ boyfriend came along and offed my mom, and dad, and I was left alone at the head of Stark Industries, with dear Obie as some kind of regent, and we all know how much Obie really loved me! I was
“Let’s stop with the colors, really, let’s just stop pretending I don’t want it,” muttered Tony. “End of the game. I want it, please tell me I’m the most beautiful man you’ve ever seen and you’re over the moon with me. Get it? Moon? Werewolf? I’m so funny.”
She wrote it down and gave him the book to sign. It was always a bit of a test for Tony, since he would always, pointedly, sign with his left hand. It was a testimony to how bigoted the village could be. Granted, that could turn out dangerous -he’d once had to flee in the middle of the night because the whole place had wanted to burn him-. However, Mrs Arbogast didn’t react at all, and merely smiled at him before beckoning the young man behind them;
The trees gave out to the road and wide fields. In the horizon already darkened by the descending sun, lights from the village shimmered.
Tony felt a weight against his hole, bigger than Steve’s fingers, and he breathed in, bracing himself.
“I didn’t think of him as a human being, or even a living being,” said Tony, his voice flat. “I thought of him as a tool. As a weapon. As the
Steve stared at him, again. He was standing proudly, hands on his hips, his braid still tied to the hook by the window, while Tony was sprawled on the floor, all sweaty and his throat parched. It may have been because Tony was totally dying from that inhumane climb, but black spots were dancing before his eyes, and the floor felt unstable under his bottom, his whole body burning up as if on fire, and Steve himself was getting pretty blurred.
And so Steve told him about his illness as a child, and how the sorcerer Schmidt -the Red Skull- had taken him as replacement for the rampions his father, Joseph Rogers, had stolen to him. Ever since, the Red Skull named Steve ‘Rapunzel’, after the rampions that had saved his life -or maybe, thought Tony, to spite Steve and never let him forget the reason why he was imprisoned here-.
“I’d say ‘sure’, but, honestly, I’d rather you leave me alone for a while. Good-bye, Steve. Take care of yourself.”
The bathroom door is open. The floor is wet and the mirror steamed up, but Tony isn’t there. He isn’t in the bedroom either. His coat and jacket are missing from beside Steve and Bucky’s coats. His shoes are missing too.
On Christmas Eve, Bucky and him invite their closest friends for dinner. There’s Natasha, who looks like an actress with her ethereal figure, perfect features and gorgeous red hair. She’s a friend from their short time in the army, and she nows work for the CIA, or the FBI, or maybe she’s a spy -she doesn’t really tell, and they never dared ask her, because behind her sweet smiles and doe eyes, she can be vicious and very scary-. She brings along her neighbor’s children, the twins Wanda and Pietro, because they deserve a happy Christmas despite their mother’s drinking. Steve relates to that all too much and is always happy to welcome them in his home.
Then he stepped back and closed the curtain, giving Tony privacy. Tony undressed, stuffed his clothes in the basket, and then carefully stepped into the bathtub. He was used to wash himself with cold water -in streams and wash houses, or else by the well or the faucet-, for hot baths were a luxury very few people could afford. Having a hot bath meant you would have a servant preparing the bathtub for you by warming up lots of water, and that wasn’t an easy feat. No common people would do so. Magic, as much as Tony hated it, really seemed pretty convenient and allowed someone as poor as Steve to enjoy this luxury by himself. There had to be a way to do the same with science, thought Tony as he relaxed into the hot water.
Steve nodded. He wouldn’t deny it. He had to face the fact that he, Captain America, had acted like the bullies he had sworn to fight, and he had to make sure he would never do so again.
“Thank you, little fairy,” he said. “I would do anything for my Stevie. Let it cost what it will,” and saying those words, he stepped out of the woods and crossed the glade, followed by the tiny light of the fairy.
Tony calms down. It’s a very sudden quiet that falls on him, and Steve is worried he said too much, that he overstepped. But Tony breathes in deeply, sighs, and then says, voice back to normal;
“I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice wavering. “I don’t… I barely remember it. I got desperate because nothing I did was working. You wouldn’t listen to me, I tried to have Bucky get out so as to calm you down but it didn’t work, I tried to disable your bootjets and failed, and in the end you started beating Bucky into a pulp, you kept kicking his face and there was so much blood and all, that I got so scared you would kill him, I just had to stop you. I don’t know if I lost control or if my thinking got skewed. I think I remember calculating that if I tried hitting the arc reactor, you’d cover it with your arms, and I didn’t wanna break them, so I went for a diversion. It seems so absurd, now. Why would I think it was better to hit your face and scare you to death rather than hurt your arms? Maybe… maybe I needed to see your face. I don’t know, Tony… I’m so sorry.”
She nodded, her feet dangling other the edge of his palm, one hand wrapped around his pinky and the other waving at him as if enjoining him to go on. So he did.
“No. I don’t need help from something that doesn’t exist. We’re not lost, Butterhooves. C’mon, Dummy, let’s go!” snapped Tony, spurring his mount with his heels, but Dummy ignored him and kept munching more cloves.
“Who the Hell are you?” frowned Tony, for he had a strong dislike of all that was magical (yes, he had wanted to visit the good witch just to prove that she was a quack).
God, why had a word as simple as a 'please' been so difficult to get out? Steve still needed to work on that. ‘Please’, ‘I’m sorry’…all those were words that since his awakening in the twentieth century, remained stuck in his throat, and it seemed that it was something Tony had had noticed as well, because hearing it right now made his dark eyes slightly widen with surprise.
Sorry folks, no sexy times in the first chapter! But I can promise you that there will be some in all the following chapters. I hope you enjoyed nonetheless this introduction to the story and characters. I chose "young side-kick Robin-looking" Bucky instead of the usual "Steve's childhood friend and Winter Soldier" Bucky, and put in Arnie, who is in the comics, indeed gay and the one who protected Steve in his childhood. I haven't quite decided who the Good Witch is supposed to be yet (I originally wanted her to be Wanda, but decided against it), so let me know if you have some ideas. Who would you like to see as the Good Witch?
“Is it me? Did I hurt you?” Steve’s voice was getting higher and higher in his distress. “I thought you wanted it, you were looking at me with those heated eyes and… and… and you were making those sounds, Tony, you even asked me for more, and… and your body was reacting to my every touch… I… I really thought you wanted me!”
“You go, Steve! Having Tony Stark looking for your paintings! You’re gonna get famous in the blink of an eye!”
Butterhooves snorted at him, and since Tony wasn’t paying attention to his mount anymore, Dummy promptly started munching on a patch of clovers. Tony was about to yell at him, for he had told him many times that clover wasn’t good for his belly, when he froze. Since Butterhooves had stopped moving, she wasn’t making all that noise anymore, and so Tony could hear a faint sound coming from deep into the forest.
“No, no, it’s on me,” murmurs Tony, “I’m completely out of practice. I’m sorry, I don’t think I can blow you tonight.”
Why was he feeling so breathless? He had worked bare-chested plenty of times before, and furthermore he had never minded getting naked in front of other people, so why was it so embarrassing when it was Steve?
“Huh, you were planning on offering me a drawing?” chuckles Tony, still lazily stroking himself, now fully hard. His free hand is still skipping over his nipples, and his spine arches. Surprisingly, it’s that movement, that vision of Tony’s spine bending that fully arouses Steve, makes him remember how good it felt, to be moving inside of him.
True to his word, Tony came back two days later. By then, he was nearly done with his tinkering, and had only a day left of work. He was planning to visit Steve one last time after his departure from the village. As he followed Jan through the woods, chatting happily with her, Dummy shook his long ears and straightened them, listening intently in front of him, and Tony and Jan fell silent as their ears picked on, too, the charming notes of Steve’s singing.
So here he is, with Sharon, pushing through the crowd, making polite talk. Sharon doesn’t stay long -she’s a nurse, and it’s not her place, she just came to help Steve and Peggy out-, and Steve can’t seem to spot Peggy, so he’s left alone.
Steve ignores him and takes the food and the bottle, and starts heading back to his room, when a collective “STOP!” freezes him on the spot.
, Steve! The only real friend I had was Rhodey, and he had enrolled already ! Your depression sucked? Poor you! Newsflash, mine sucked too! I got drunk all the time, did drugs, tried to kill myself by doing the most reckless things, slept around without protection, tried again to kill myself when a sex tape of me got leaked, went to rehab, and wow, was all that fun! The only reason I’m still here now, is because Jarvis, the human Jarvis, my old butler, took care of me, and Rhodey even managed to take time off for me, too ! They got me treated for depression, the medication had horrible side-effects on me and I had to go through a handful of therapists, but I eventually got better. And yeah, back then when I was sick I made a lot of stupid decisions, I acted like an ass and I still can’t understand how Jarvis and Rhodey managed to bear with me and went as far as fuckin’ saving me, but I can tell you one thing… I would’ve never,
Tony raises his head, a haunted look in his eyes, and Steve regrets asking him. Then he shakes his head, and presses a kiss on Steve’s mouth.
Well... I didn't plan it to turn out like this, but Tony freaked out so I had to let him do some introspection.
There was a sharp pain in Steve’s chest, and there were so many words he had wanted to say that he never got to, and that, he knew now, would only have hurt Tony if he had let them out.
Steve’s laughing, breathlessly. He’s shifting, feeling unstable on his stool, and he puts his free hand on Tony’s shoulder for support. He only has to turn his head a little, and he’s staring right into Tony’s eyes. Without thinking, he drops a kiss on the corner of his mouth. They are so close he can smell Tony’s cologne mixed with the scent of the mocktail he’s been drinking.
There’s another thing that raises Steve’s hackles. Gorgeous is obviously looking for an one-night stand. Just look at how he’s all dressed up, as sexily as possible, his eyes scanning the crowd. He’s not waiting for his date, since he’s not checking the time on his expensive watch. He’s just sitting there, on his stool, sipping drink after drink. Steve is pretty sure Gorgeous is a lady killer, pretty sure he can flirt as he breathes. Everything about him screams of sex. But Gorgeous looks uncomfortable each time a guy comes up showing interest. He smiles and rejects gently the person, but Steve can see how tensed up he is in the way his spine and hips shift slightly away from the other. The other doesn’t notice, shrugs, disappointed, and leaves. It’s as if Gorgeous didn’t actually like men, so why is he there, in a gay bar, luring people in for naughts? Is it because of some bet?
There was a shuffle as the soldier shifted above him and the billionaire let out a sigh of relief once his groin was no longer being squashed by a bony knee. Just when Tony thought Steve was going to get to his feet and help him up he felt a warm pressure on his mouth and realized Steve was kissing him.
He pushed the papers on his desk aside, setting his pen down. He opened the file and pushed the play button, reclining comfortably in his office chair with eyes fixed on the screen.
He’d been locked away in his lab for three days straight now, which wasn’t by any means a record for him, but still probably wasn’t healthy. Tony Stark had a knack for disregarding his own mental and physical well-being when he was knee deep in processors and scrap metal. His body could hold off on sleep and non-liquefied nutrients until his latest stroke of mechanical genius was birthed into this world.
Sliding his hand over his stomach, Steve tugged the corner of the towel out of it’s knot until it loosened, letting the fabric drop around his ankles, exposing himself fully. He was already fully erect, his shaft flushed a dark shade of pink and straining against his lower belly. He took a seat on the wooden bench, spreading his legs apart and angling his hips up slightly. Steve took himself in hand, stroking a couple times to coax out a little bead of pre-come, then snapped the picture and hit send.
, Steve’s brain supplied for him, but he shook that thought away just as quickly as it popped into his head. He couldn’t flirt with his boss, not even in his own head.
Hala didn’t seem too surprised by his answer, though his refusal did irk her. “You will obey me, puny man, or I shall have my army destroy you and your petty earth.” She hissed.
“What?” He said, stretching the vowels to show that he was starting to get tired of the accusing looks, though Pepper’s disapproving stare didn’t waver.
“Tony, I mean it. He’s a national icon, and a member of your team. If you think having a one night stand with Christine Everhart was a disaster, just imagine the backlash you could get from this.”
“Oh, fantastic… At least it won’t get too stuffy in here.” He muttered sarcastically as every last display on his interface flickered off until he was left to stare at nothing but darkness. “Okay, getting a bit claustrophobic now. J, engage the emergency release mechanism.”
“Cut!” Fury shouted, and Steve thought that the man might actually explode in rage. “Everybody, take five. And somebody find Rogers some god damn talent.”
Thick white globs spilled over Natasha’s fingers, dripping down the sides of her wrists. The woman made a small click with her tongue, pulling her hand away and brought up to her face as if to inspect it.
“Looks like you don’t have any problems making that pussy purr.” Tony jabbed at him with a wicked smirk.
?” Tony nearly shouted in response, his voice raised as people shot them passing glances, and he quickly tried to compose himself, really not wanting to cause a scene. He shrank back, shoving his hands in the pockets of his jeans.
Steve smiles and leans in to give him one more fleeting kiss before getting off of him, heading across the room to grab his shirt.
Besides, he was currently working on an advanced support mechanism that would aid with the mending of bone and tissue, and what better way to test out his latest invention then to use it on himself?
The nudity wasn't the problem for him, he played sports in college and generally didn’t have anything to be self conscious about, but the idea of doing this kind of thing with someone else in the room was a bit daunting.
Peter didn’t seem to hear him or care. Just like his father that one. He sighed heavily and snapped his fingers to get his attention.
The energy blast recoiled off of Doom’s electro-magnetic shields and was redirected right back at him, hitting him right in the chest.
Slouching back into the leather, which was starting to feel tacky from his own body heat, Steve closed his fist around the base of his shaft, giving himself a couple firm pumps.
She stretched her trembling hand out, and Steve stepped forward to take her spotted, wrinkled fingers in his own, holding onto them like something fragile that could break if he applied just the slightest bit of pressure.
Tony scoffed.  “Oh yeah. You know, things were going so well I thought I’d just take a nap in a Wal Mart parking lot.”
“Five minutes, Barton,” Sam announces, making Clint sigh deeply, banging the back of his head against the wall.
Tony sips his coffee. For a long moment, silence presses around them. Steve is just about to resort to talking about the weather,
Tony leaves. Exhaling, Steve leans against the counter, staring at the cup of coffee Tony left behind. It’s Captain America mug, a gift from Maria Hill, if Steve recalls correctly.
Tony is gone that evening, leaving Nat with a message that they needn't worry. Steve rings Pepper, who tells them Tony's on a business trip. Where, she doesn't say, reluctant to give out any information.
When Tony finally returns, it doesn't happen without obstacles. Steve is in the lounge room, on the phone with Natasha, when he sees Iron Man landing outside on the platform. He watches as the suit opens – Steve misses Tony’s nanotech suit, how beautiful it had looked on Tony’s body – and Tony stumbles out, holding his side.
”Huh,” says Tony. He looks like he hasn't have a good night's sleep, even though he had been dozing off when Steve had left the room, brushing his lips lightly against Tony's forehead, barely getting to feel the heat of his skin. ”Well, Natasha, if you want a better mattress or a bigger room that can be arranged. I mean, you can switch with Thor or maybe not, he's going to throw a tantrum because he's used to everything grandeur and getting what he wants…”
And it isn’t. Clint is a man with a wife and a handful of kids. Natasha is his best little spy friend. Steve and Tony, however ‒ it had felt more like a painful divorce than an ugly spat between two friends.
Out of every possible genius on the planet Earth and outer space, it was Shuri who was the most likely to decode Bucky. If Tony Stark had one breakthrough a day, Shuri had two.
Steve wastes no time – no, he's wasted that enough – and lifts Tony, carries him into Tony's bedroom with hurried steps. He's trying to remove Tony's shirt even before Tony hits the sheets.
“Peter Parker,” Wanda elaborates, “The spiderling. Spiderboy ‒ sorry, Spiderman. He’s constantly trying to contact
”Enough,” Natasha admits, walking to the sink to fill the bottle. ”Sorry, didn't mean to eavesdrop.”
The corner of Tony’s mouth twitches and he gets a soft look in his eyes. “Is that your new mantra, Steve?”
“I don’t know why I called you,” Tony says before Steve can get a word in. Tony’s voice is rushed; fast and laced with anxiety. There’s nothing Steve wants to do more than appear on his side, wrap an arm around his shoulders, soothe him, let him know everything will be alright. “I honestly don’t know. What I know, is that I can’t stop thinking about you.”
“Sad to see you go,” says Shuri. Her youth is even more striking than T’Challa’s, who’s a grown man, after all. Shuri has the posture of a true princess, and the keen eyes of a prodigy. Still, she can’t be more than a couple years older than that spider boy Tony had recruited. For a fleeting moment, Steve can only see a young girl in a Star Wars t-shirt.
”Rogers? Are you listening to me? Why have you gone all pale?” Fury asks, crossing his arms across his chest.
Tony doesn't react to the affectionate nickname that escapes from Steve's lips. He only shivers in Steve's embrace, clutching Steve's shirt.
“This is not my place to be,” says Steve with a sigh, rubbing his forehead. He’s tired down to his bones, no matter how little sleep his body requires after the serum. He’s been tired since the Accords, since Peggy, but he
Sharon shushes him, pushing her forefinger playfully against Steve’s lips. “I know. We weren’t meant to be, meant to last,” she says, “It’s just a cover up. So that no one suspects why I come to Philly so often.” She seems to hesitate, then asks, not daring to actually look at Steve, “Did our kiss mean anything to you?”
Tony whispers: so light it's just a gust of air passing through his lips. ”Why are you suddenly here, all sweet on me? What is up with you? What happened in D.C.?”
room – and draws. It's the only way to get the images out of his mind. The friends and allies he left behind. He sketches a picture of Stormbreaker, recalling how powerful he had felt wielding it.
”The other members of the team. The don't come here, do they? They don't live here, even though you promised to take them in?” Steve rambles. He knows Clint has a reason, his secret still unknown to everyone except Nat. Thor, too, has his own family, but there’s still Nat and Bruce… And Steve. Steve regrets he didn't go to Tony when he had the change. He's going to fix that, now.
“Right,” Bucky says, gritting his teeth, “Like he will ever forgive the man who murdered his parents.”
Steve and Tony have been circling around each other the whole day. Actually, Tony had been gone most of the day, visiting Rhodey, hopefully giving him Steve’s regards. Steve had mostly spent the day playing chess with Wanda, which as an afterthought was not very wise since Wanda could see what moves Steve was about to make in advance, and thus ended up winning every time.
There's ugly bruising on Tony's side. The same spot where he had been pierced in Steve's timeline. Steve hovers his lips there over Tony’s skin. He makes sure to kiss every scar he finds on Tony's body.
He thinks of Carol Danvers, again, how she'd held against Thanos and the infinity stones whereas Steve couldn't.
“Yes. He was just here a couple nights ago. Didn’t see me, but I see everything. He used to bother Mr. Hogan, but then Tony gave him Lizzy’s number. I don’t know what he’s so keen on ‒ I heard Tony say he turned down his offer to become an official Avenger. Perhaps he’s reconsidering.”
Steve thinks of that group of misfits from space, swearing to protect others. He thinks of them standing together at Tony's funeral. A lump forms in Steve's throat.
Sharon Carter is a great ally. It amazes Steve how effortlessly she seems to arrange everything, even though she’s merely an agent.
Steve tries to lift up Tony's shirt to see the damage, but Tony's quick hand grabs Steve's wrist. His eyes spit fire at Steve.
”Yes,” Carol says to Tony and then turns back to Steve. ”He told me to let you know that Thanos is dead.”
Peggy opened her mouth, once, twice. Her eyes glistened, that beautiful face twisted in the expression of sympathy and heartbreak for Steve. She was at loss of words.
”You'll find your quarters ready for you. I've informed Sir of your presence. How long do you plan on staying?”
Natasha comments. Steve has to use all his willpower not to crush her into a tight hug. Although not the same, she's still
Wanda blinks at him slowly. She looks miserable ‒ pale, thin, and exhausted. Steve had seen how they’d treated her in the Raft. He recognizes Wanda is a
Steve circles around the couch and sits next to Tony. “I truly am. I- I wasn’t thinking straight. Peggy had just died, and she seemed like my last physical link to the past. And then ‒ there was Bucky, and-“
Steve – Steve doesn't even know what he's pleading for. A piece of Tony. Even a tiny one. He has already gotten more than he ever had before and it keeps him going.
Wanda’s gaze bores into him, making Steve squirm. Steve thinks she’s discreet, not invading anyone’s mind without consent, but Steve suspects his feelings can be read from his face.
“The film will still need to be edited, but I guess for a first shoot it wasn’t total bullshit.” Fury scoffed.
"I'd let you do anything." Steve pants, completely vulnerable and acquiescent to all of Tony’s filthy desires.
“I don’t know, I’m kind of partial to the former.” He said deviously, turning on the Stark charm he was famous for.
“Avengers, Assemble!” He called into the com before propelling forward, shooting Doom with a rush of energy blasts that exploded around his feet.
The blond had a shocked look on his face, eyes wide and staring at the two men sharing a tender moment on the screen. Steve gaze was locked onto the television screen as the two men were smooching, before the image started flipping across the crowds again.
“We'll catch up later, he hates it when I’m late – don’t say anything.” Steve added just as Sam opened his mouth to comment on that.
Tony just shrugged, deciding to leave it at that. He wasn’t the biggest sport’s fan, but he knew better than to argue with a man about his preferred sport’s team.
Fully nude, he leans back, draping one arm along the back of the couch. “Better now?” He said, voice challenging. He still felt apprehensive about this, but Steve could be a sassy little shit when he wanted to. Especially when he wanted go prove someone wrong.
Steve doesn’t falter, hands diverging north to undo Tony’s tie and loosens it around his neck. He looks handsome all dolled up in a suit, but Steve thinks he looks even better disheveled like this. He smooths his hands down Tony’s chest and over the flat of his stomach, hooking his fingers through Tony’s belt loops and yanks him in close.
Steve let out a laugh and rolled his eyes. “No, nothing like that. I’m doing…” He paused, racking his brain for an alibi. “Stock photos.”
The brunet just smiled at him and motioned for him to follow down the hall. “I’ve got a surprise for you.”
Old, buried memories flared up at the mention of ‘last time’. Tony was painfully reminded of his ex, Tyberius Stone, who had used him as nothing more than a stepping stool to get what he wanted and then left him to pick up the shattered pieces left behind.
Kinky porn doesn’t scare him. His face and naked body are all over the internet anyways, so what else does he have to lose?
The Hulk was out of reach on the airship, and Thor was still MIA so there was no one coming to catch Tony mid-air and stop the falling billionaire from hitting the concrete.
On a whim, Steve turned on his camera and held his phone at arms length, angling the screen to make sure that his still glistening chest and abs were justly gratified in the shot before snapping the picture. He gave the photo a quick once over to double-check that everything looked good and that it wasn’t blurry, then quickly pressed send, damning his half-naked selfie into the ether of the internet.
Steve’s stance is unwavering, his eyes narrowed on the douchebag in front of him. “Good, then maybe we can get through the next couple weeks like civilized people.” He says firmly.
Steve swallowed his indignation. As much as he wanted to rip Rumlow a new one for the completely uncalled for improv, he knew that if he disrupted the scene they would have to reshoot it and he just really wanted to get this over with already.
Steve gave a bashful smile. “I’ve been watching those cooking shows on the television.” He admitted with what almost looked like the hint of a blush tinting his cheeks. “Back in my day we just boiled things, so food wasn’t that great.” He said, shrugging his shoulders.
The billionaire turned the relic over in his hands. “And if I do somehow manage to get it working, then what? It resurrects people, right? That sort of thing usually comes with a price.”
Steve’s curiosity continued to grow, wondering what on earth the erratic billionaire was hiding up his sleeve.
He emerged from his penthouse, fashionably late, and rode the elevator down to the main communal floor. Steve was waiting for him in the hall just outside of the kitchen, where they’d agreed to meet up, shoulders hunched and foot tapping against the floor.
Steve just rolls his eyes, getting up from his spot at Tony's feet to lean against the desk. “I’m guessing that phone call is related to why you had to leave so unexpectedly this morning?”
Steve’s breath caught in his throat at the touch, sending a ripple of lust down Tony’s spine all the way to his groin. The redhead wrapped her delicate fingers around his member, teasing at first, but then her strokes became harder and faster. Tiny sounds of pleasure flitted out of Steve, lips formed into a loose ‘O’ shape as Natasha worked him to a shivering mess. Tony was getting off on the noises, his own hand moving in time with the one on screen. Steve was getting more and more vocal with his pleasure until he reached his peak, letting out a choked below and folding in on himself as much as the binds allowed him too.
It was dumb, right? Who cares if they’d slept together – Tony was his boss, not his boyfriend.  Even if they did have the occasional (totally consensual and highly anticipated) sexual encounter it’s not like Tony had any reason to miss him when he wasn’t there. They weren't in a relationship or anything, they weren't even really friends. He had no reason to barge in on Tony’s busy schedule and derail him just because he felt a little lonely.
Now Tony wasn’t normally one to want to slow down, in his playboy days he’d pounce on someone before he even bothered to ask their name, but Steve wasn’t just another meaningless fling.
“Submit?” Steve muttered, clearing his throat. “You make me sound like I’m forcing him to spend time with me.”
Tony didn’t reply for what felt like minutes. Steve couldn’t tell if he was intentionally taking his sweet time texting back or if time just seemed to drag on forever.
Steve caught his shield as it bounced off of the creature’s haunches and propelled back to him, widening his stance.
“Besides, I’m not exactly into the whole five star dining scene.” Steve said, lacing his fingers together. “Too rich for my blood.”
“You got some kind of problem with me?” He asks, squaring his shoulders and staring the man down. He’s never met the guy, so he has no idea why he’s acting like Steve pissed in his oatmeal.
.” Tony hissed as Pepper tilted his head up with practiced ease to fuss over her boss. Steve would have run to Tony’s side instead, but he had to deal with Bucky.
Tony gave a short nod and tucked the empty canister into his coat pocket. “Yeah alright.” Tony slid off of the hood of the car, nearly stumbling as he got his footing. He was about to open the driver’s side door, but a hand rested just above his, holding it shut.
He wasn’t gentle, and Steve could barely suppress a gag when he felt the fat head hit the back of his throat. Rumlow didn’t give him any time to adjust, forcing him further down on his cock, using his mouth with about as much consideration as he would give a fleshlight.
Steve nodded and reached a hand out, offering it to Tony. “Steve Rogers.” He said with a charming smile.
He continued poking at his food, foot tapping restlessly against the ground as she continued to play around on her Starkphone.
Tony paid close attention to the way Steve’s body responded to her words, soft pink lips parting as his cock seemed to throb in anticipation. Even though the billionaire had seen him in action, he still gave off a certain innocence from his almost boy-scout demeanor. Natasha was tarnishing that innocence, and Tony liked it. That woman was a pro. She could make even Tony quiver in his shoes, Steve didn’t stand a chance.
That stunt manages to draw a few choked off moans out of the billionaire, who’s struggling to keep his voice down. Steve can tell that Tony’s close by the steady trickle of salty fluid running over his tongue and the way his legs begin to tremble.
The two Kree soldiers that were stationed at the base of the throne straighten up and began to advance at their queen's command, weapons pointed at him.  Tony looked at them both, eyes darting between the two as he rattled his brain, wondering how the hell he was going to talk himself out of this one.
Steve ignored that comment, but a smile crept it’s way into the corners of his lips. “Yeah yeah, I'll be sure to write you an IOU. Ready to go?”
Steve let the warning sink in, not really expecting the words of wisdom. He pursed his lips together, acknowledging Tony’s concerns.
Even before she’d become the CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper was always busy doing something – usually cleaning up his messes.
. Are you a virgin or what?” He continued belligerently, and if Steve currently didn’t have a ball gag in his mouth he would have probably told him off.
There was a heavy atmosphere as Steve let that sink in, but after a few minutes he seemed to get a grip on himself and pushed off of the wall. “I see.”
Tony seemed to finally accept his answer as one of the crew came over to hand him a blanket, which he gratefully took and draped over his shoulders to cover himself up. Tony gave him a final once over before letting out a sigh that sounded both relieved and remorseful.
Quietly, he makes his way over and sets one of the coffees down in Tony's peripheral. Tony doesn’t acknowledge him, but he seems to perk up a bit at the sight of a triple espresso. That small taste of joy is short lived as the person on the other end speaks up again.
This was absolutely ludicrous. Sure, you could argue that he was already selling himself on the internet, but it’s not like he put his face in the videos, or made a career out of it! There was still some sense of anonymity to his content, and if he signed on to a studio then his reputation would be shattered forever.
Steve rapidly slammed his fists against the heavy sandbag, sweat dripping down his brow and across his lips, inviting the taste of salt into his mouth. Of all the perks that came with working at Stark studios, the state of the art gym was probably his favorite. He liked going for runs, but there was something about pushing his body to the absolute peak of exhaustion and relishing in the tender soreness of a good workout.
The heat in the room is steadily rising, and Steve wants nothing more then to rip the clothes from Tony’s body but he refrains because he’s pretty sure the man’s tie costs more than his entire month’s rent, but apparently Tony isn’t as concerned for his clothes. He claws at Steve’s dress shirt, nearly ripping off the buttons in his haste to get his hands on Steve’s muscular physique.
Tony reached out to rest a hand on his shoulder, the touch anchoring him. “I’m sorry. Really, I should have told you about her first. I was just hoping to avoid…well, this.”
He saw Tony lean over to whisper something into the director’s ear, all the while maintaining eye contact with him. Steve felt hot under those dark, chocolate brown eyes, the flush sweeping over his body from his throat to his chest. It was shameful just how much it turned him on to have Tony watching him when he was vulnerable.
“I’m really sorry about this. If it wasn’t something important there’s no way in hell I’d be choosing work over—" He leaned against the doorframe, gesturing at him with a wave of his hand and a longing sigh. “Anyway, if I’m not at the studio in 20 minutes there’s a good chance that Pepper will castrate me so….”
Bucky scoffs, stretching out to put his feet on the coffee table. “First of all, out of all, you know I would totally be Guy Fiery.” He starts, fork pointed at Steve before digging in and taking an enormous bite of the mystery mush. “’Sides’, figure if you're bringing home the dough I might as well play housewife.”
“Because you didn’t back off. Now get off my property before I press charges.” Tony threatened, unwavering.
His legs try to close on instinct, but Tony’s hand is firm, keeping them spread apart as he continues the double assault on his prostate. He squirms, fingers curling against the desk, but the agonizing pleasure only intensifies.
“You know, playing the funny, sarcastic asshole doesn’t really suit you. You should probably stick to being your regular, unfunny stick-in-the-mud self.” He muttered, limping just a bit. He’d probably sprained his knee on impact, because he winced at the sharp sting of pain every time he put pressure on it. “What about the invasion? What happened to Doom and his army of glorified trash cans?”
“Probably off to do something stupid.” Natasha muttered, front flipping off of the thing’s shoulder and landed neatly beside Clint as he flew by on the Hoverbike.
“You alright Cap?” He asked cautiously, feeling a heavy wall of tension suddenly being built up as Steve just stared at the screen, unblinking.
Tony watched the strong muscles of Steve’s jaw and throat work as he swallowed thickly, showing a vulnerability that Steve would never display on the battlefield.
Steve's brain was a bit fuzzy. He remembered going to the MOMA, an alien invasion, getting stabbed by some magic floating spear and Tony being taken away.
Tony smirks and withdraws his fingers. Steve starts to whine at the sudden emptiness, but it quickly turns into a heady moan as Tony unzips his trousers and pushes his cock inside him.
Natasha brought the whip down on the spot just above Steve’s navel, compelling Steve’s body to jump at the sharp snap of leather against his ivory skin. The blond bit back a surprised grunt, squaring his jaw at the sting of pain but otherwise didn’t make a sound.
Avengers Tower was a good 30 miles north east from this parking lot, and while he was sure that Steve wouldn’t actually leave him stranded with a busted suit, he wasn’t about to test that theory.
Steve wasn’t going to press the issue, and when Tony realized that he sat up and delved in for another kiss, wrestling his tongue against Steve’s for a few moments before moving along. Tony dipped his head forward, and Steve felt wet, hot kisses along his neck and chest. He gasped when he felt the sharp bite of teeth against his nipple, the sound melting into a long, drawn out groan.
“Scrap the project I guess.” Tony shrugs, still a little hazy. “Shit like this happens all the time. I'll just get reamed by corporate and have to pay out, no biggie. I’m loaded, probably won't even make a dent.”
Tony mulled it over in his head for a couple seconds, but he’d never been great at self-restraint and hearing Steve ask for it shot down any miniscule hint he might have had to deny him.
He took a seat between Natasha and Bruce, still dependently clinging to his coffee mug. “I spent the whole night working on armor improvements, suit upgrades, weapon designs…” He saw the pointed look Cap sent him and quickly explained. “Avenger weapons. Not big, terrifying military guns or anything like that.”
Tony assumed that by ‘me’ he meant Jarvis, and by ‘took me a while’ he meant took him a while to figure out how to use the tracking device on his Starkphone, but he kept those thoughts to himself.
It wasn’t necessarily a bad thing that Tony had finally made nice with America’s golden boy, and would probably do wonders for the self proclaimed playboy's public image if they were seen being friendly with one another. At the very least it saved her a whole world of headaches.
When lunchtime came around, he tore himself away from his work and went off to take a shower, scrubbing the remnants of last night’s motor oil off of his body.
“As you can see we also have our own workout facilities and wellness centers on site that you can use, as well as registered trainers and dietitians. It's not anything really strict or rigorous, but our company does have a standard when it comes to self maintenance, not that you need to worry about that.” She said, offering him a sweeping glance that made him blush.
He's a 24 year old guy from Brooklyn -- fresh out of college and desperate for cash, Tony’s probably seen his type before and as the owner of a lustrous porn studio he's probably seen hundreds of folks just like him come and go.
For a second he thought he misread the atmosphere when he felt Tony tense up under his touch. What the hell was he thinking? This man was his
As soon as he jumped, Tony felt a rush of cold air kiss his face as he begun falling towards the ground.
A waitress, who was dressed in a very short black skirt with a white frilled apron brought two coffee cups to their table. Steve took his black, but Tony accepted a splash of almond milk and some honey in his own cup.
“Yeah yeah, you have an army, we have a hulk. Honestly, I’ve been in this position before and you really wouldn’t like what happened to the other guy.”
“Nope, just good ol’ Jamaican rum. Imported straight from the motherland.” He said, taking another swig.
Deciding to just screw it and go for broke Steve undoes his jeans, pushing them down along with his dark blue boxer briefs until they’re bunched around his ankles, lifting one foot out of them and then the other before doing the same thing he did with his shirt.
That woman, Hala, she had come to earth specifically for him, but he had no idea why. He hadn’t even thought that word of the Avengers would have spread through the galaxy, but evidently it had, and that thought wasn’t a comforting one.
“I don’t know, it felt less…clinical I guess.” He muttered. “All these people watching me…I feel like some sort of experiment.
Steve savoured her wise words, wondering how he was going to get Tony to see the man behind the star spangled suit.
Not only did this place have a dozen cats roaming around freely, but the waitresses were dressed in tiny little French maid outfits, which Steve couldn’t help but get all flustered about.
Steve didn't know what he was thinking when he ticked off bondage as something he would be willing to do. Maybe it was curiosity since he’d never done it before, or maybe just his usual dumb decision, but the actual experience was really falling short to expectations. And then there was the mechanical contraption nudging at his ass.
Steve hesitated for a moment, but then went on. “Her name was Ethel Robinson.” He began, his eyes glossing over as if he was playing the memory back behind those cornflower eyes. “We made out in the backseat of my car – well, Bucky’s car actually.” He said, sheepishly. “She let me put my hands on her. Feel all the way up under her dress.”
Tony looked like he was about to make some sort of comment, but he held back whatever he'd been about to say.
“Your taste in art is too classic, doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate it.” He shot back, fiddling with the edge of his napkin. “Besides, Steve really wanted to go. Would you say no to Captain America? The guys got these goddamn puppy dog eyes, you try saying no to him.” He shrugged, casually leaning back in his chair.
“Still haven’t learned not to sneak up on people?” He shot back through heavy pants, reaching for his towel and water bottle and took a hefty swig.
Steve wouldn’t consider himself a sex fiend, or really that much of a Casanova for that matter, but he was a red blooded man so he knew his way around a dick, especially his own.
“Okay, fair, but how am I supposed to find a replacement before the end of the week?” He exasperates.
“Speaking of maintenance, we cover any and all expenses for personal grooming -- Haircuts, tanning, Brazilian wax….whatever you need. We're invested in giving our viewers the experience they pay for, and we try to make things eady for our stars..” She kept on, eventually coming to a halt just outside of an elevator and turning on her heels to face him.
“I’ve had worse.” Tony muttered and gave a small shrug, about to head off to his quarters for a much needed shower when a shoulder roughly grabbed him and spun him around to face a very disgruntled looking Captain.
“Pepper, I already told you, I’m not signing any of my assets over to Hammer. If he wants my designs he can kiss my – “ The man looked up mid rant, his brows furrowing in confusion. “You’re not Pepper.”
He knows the layout of the building pretty much by heart at this point, so finding the filming room doesn’t take him long. It’s unlocked, so he just let’s himself in and leaves the door open behind him.
They shared a laugh, and Steve let the silence hang in the air for a moment before speaking up. “So, are you good?”
They slowed their pace, coming to a halt just outside of the museum lobby. The way Steve was looking at him, eyes so blue Tony swore he could see his reflection.
“I’m really gonna enjoy breaking you in, blondie.” He whispers gruffly, bumping Steve’s shoulder as he passes. Steve shudders and feels a heavy pit in his stomach at the words.
Steve stopped to think about it, glancing down at his duffel bag. Lube never used to be a necessity in his everyday life, but it was useful to keep some on hand nowadays so he could slick himself up before a shoot.
“Dude, if you don't leave I'm calling security.” Darcy screeched at him, already reaching for the phone.
As the rest of the crew dealt with um, ‘cleanup’, Steve moved off to the other end of the room to grab a warm towel off the refreshment table so he could wash his face. He dabbed at a spot in his hair, frowning as he tried his best to wipe it out. His hair still felt stiff and tacky when he’d managed to get most of it out. He was definitely going to need a shower.
Steve lunged forward in his eagerness for another kiss but Tony stopped him by pressing a finger to his lips, much to the soldier’s confusion.
Thor was busy rummaging through his cupboards, no doubt in search of a brew worthy of a fearless Asgardian warrior, or whatever poetic nonsense he was usually blathering about.
Steve glanced at Doom over his shield, noticing the slightest ripple in the air around him. His eyes widened when he realized that the villain was anticipating Tony’s attack and had put up his magnetic force field. Steve raised himself onto his feet and held his hand out towards tony.
Steve hadn’t expected Mr. Stark to dive right into it, but he supposed the porn industry wasn’t exactly known for its conventionalisms.
The team shared confused looks, all except for Natasha of course who gave them a hidden smile. “We’ll save you guys a spot. Come on.” She said, leading them out of the conference room.
The Hulk barreled into the army, swinging his massive arms from side to side, throwing the Kree soldiers against the walls as if they were ragdolls. Even their advanced alien weapons didn’t phase the Hulk’s impenetrable skin, all it seemed to do was piss him off even more.
Hala looks him over, as if assessing his threat level before she pulls her spear away. “Very well.” She huffs, and with a snap of her fingers two Kree guards come up and grab him by the arms, escorting him towards to airship.
Tony let that sink in. He knew Steve was virtuous and all that, but he’d never expected him to have zero sexual experience. There was something a little…refreshing about that, actually.
Tony picked out a bottle 20 year old Talisker whiskey, pouring himself a two finger shot into a rounded glass and brought the drink to his lips.
As half time rolled around and the players were taking advantage of the intermission to rehydrate, the cameras were focusing on different parts of the stadium, flashing different sections across the Jumbo-Tron.
Tony’s jaw visibly clenched and he threw the half eaten ice cream into a trash bin. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
He reached out a hand to splay his fingers over the flat plane of Tony’s stomach where the two halves of his shirt fell open, feeling smooth, firm skin under his fingers. He moved upwards, trailing his touch along Tony’s flank and under his pectoral, stopping when his fingers brushed up against warm steel. He was about to ask what it was, but Tony grabbed his wrist and moved his hand back down.
Steve stared at him, stunned. Tony’s words cut through him like a knife, leaving a gaping wound in his chest. For a moment he couldn’t even register the words that had come out of the other man’s mouth, wondering if he’d missed something.
Tony tries to keep talking business but he’s stuttering and stumbling over his words, grunting softly every time Steve takes him further down his throat. He kept going until his jaw started to hurt, but a little bit of discomfort wasn’t going to stop him. Steve moaned pornographically, sliding his mouth up the shaft and swiping his tongue teasingly over Tony’s slit to collect the bead of pre-cum. He learned that little trick from the pretty brunette in studio 2.
Natasha walked over to him, crossing her arms over her chest and leaned into the battered punching bag, reaching one arm out to touch Steve’s shoulder.
“Who says I don’t have my armor.” Tony countered, pressing another sequence of buttons into his wristwatch.
Steve could understand why Tony was concerned, he's only been in the industry for a couple months, it made sense for him to worry about his subordinate’s well being. Steve thought the stuff he was doing now was pretty intense, and if that was what Tony considered novice level then this other stuff was probably way above his of expertise.
Sam stayed in his seat, watching Steve’s back as he ran off and called out “Have fun on your date!” with a toothy grin.
Steve glanced away sheepishly, an honest to God blush dusting across his perfect face that only made it harder for Tony not to just plant one on him right then and there.
One by one they shuffled into the Avenjet, taking off in record time while agent Coulson quickly briefed them on the situation at hand.
As if the tone of the message wasn’t enough of a hint, the signature definitely tipped him off, and he realized that this was the first time that Tony was texting him from his private phone if the number hadn’t been recognized.
“You’re evil.” Tony points accusingly, heading out the door before he throws away the last shred of self-discipline he still has.
“Okay, so I'm Tony Stark, owner of this lavish place. Now that we've got the formalities out of the way strip and lie back.” Mr. Stark said like this was some routine business, which to him it probably was, as he fiddled with the camera settings.
Steve swiped a thumb over the screen of his smartphone, well averse with this little piece of tech by now. He quickly read through the text he received from a number he didn’t recognize.
At that remark, Steve reached out to take the flask from Tony, realizing that if the more he drank, the less Tony would. While the super serum made his body impervious to the effects of alcohol, his eyes still watered at the burning sensation on his tongue, and he almost choked as the liquor scorched his throat.
Steve turned to look at him, looking mildly offended. “No, of course not. Why, did you think I would?”
The Hulk had taken care of most of the invaders by the time they joined the skirmish, leaving the rest of the team to deal with the stragglers. The Kree got away in the end, though Tony figured they wouldn’t be coming back anytime soon. With any luck, their inglorious retreat might set an example for any other threats lurking in the galaxy that might look to earth as an easy target.
“You didn’t do anything I didn’t want, Steve,” he said, his voice rough. “I wanted it. I wanted you. I still do. I want you. I don’t feel half as alive as I do when I’m by your side, and that’s the truth.”
“I can’t,” said Jan, her voice sad. “I’ve already helped his father. I can’t grant more than one wish to the same blood. Most people in this village had that one wish granted already to their ancestors. Joseph was one of the lasts I could appear to. Now, you, as a stranger, I can help.”
A young man about his age was cleaning the tables, and a woman, her hair graying and her face all smiles, was putting away the beer mugs. The guy stared at Tony, while the woman greeted;
“Jan, you said you granted one wish. So why don’t you help that poor guy in the tower?” said Tony after a while of them walking through the dark forest in silence.
“No way. I’m a man of science,” retorted Tony, and started swatting at her. “Get off my Dummy, he hates wasps and all things that sting.”
He wasn’t mocking him. He was… Steve swallowed. There was no way Tony could understand exactly what he was saying without… He cut short the thought. He didn’t want to think that maybe Tony would know firsthand what Steve was going through, because he had been there, too.
For a second, something like hesitation and mistrust, as if Tony thought he was being mocked, showed in Tony’s eyes, but it vanishes in the blink of an eye, so Steve doesn’t dwell on it.
“I’ve got Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and survival guilt,” he blurted out. “I’m currently seeing someone about that. They think I have depression too, but they’re not sure because of the serum. Apparently, the medicine doesn’t work on me, also because of the serum, but I’m talking things out with a therapist, so… I’m doing better.”
“Yeah, Steve Rogers, the new artist! I love your art! You should work with me sometimes, we would make fashion explode with awesomeness!”
Almost an hour he'd been going at this, slowly working himself up and making a spectacle of it while keeping an eye on the live chat that was up in the corner of his monitor. He wasn’t a popular streamer, he had less than a hundred followers and even fewer subscribers, but occasionally people would tune in to watch his shows, throwing him a couple bucks if he managed to please them.
For a second Rumlow looked like he might be gearing up for a fight, but instead he just scoffed, casting Steve one last death glare before storming out of the room.
“Oh right, and before I forget.” Tony chirped, heading to his desk and scribbled something down. “Here’s your pay. I threw in a little extra since you’re a newbie.” He said, handing him a cheque.
The woman lifted her head, an equal look of surprise on her face, old eyes tearing up at the sight of him. “Steve? Oh, it is you.”
“Fuck…” He muttered, tapping his finger against the shattered interface, hoping that it might light up again.
Steve manages to hold out for maybe another 30 seconds when the coil snaps and his hips buck into his fist, pulsing thick white loads all over his hand and abs as he lets out a cry of pleasure.
Steve just rolled his shoulders and scraped around the sides of the bowl. “It’s easier. I mean, flower, cocoa power, sugar -- it’s all the same stuff right?”
Tony might not like the guy’s personality, but there was no denying that he had an incredibly hot body.
Tony clenched his jaw, teeth grinding as he felt the rage in his chest bubbling up to a breaking point. He wasn’t about to hand over everything he’d ever worked for to this colossal asshole just so he could turn it into some crooked money making scheme, but if Steve’s personal information got out it would ruin his life. Not only would his image be tarnished, but there were some real creeps out there on the internet and there was no telling what they would do if they got a hold of his home address.
“You’re a regular old Martha Stuart, aren’t you?” He said, shoving the whole cracker into his mouth.
The Captain was spending some of his free time in the training room, dodging the red lasers that shot out of the tiny wall mounted robots that locked onto his every move. Just as he blocked the barrage of laser beams with his shield, he felt his phone going off in his pocket.
“So, how’s the whole ‘getting Stark to submit to your infallible acts of comradery’ going?” Natasha quipped, suddenly appearing out of nowhere, vaulting herself over the back of the couch and sinking into the spot next to him.
He half expected to be welcomed by some grungy space decorated with all sorts of sex memorabilia, but the lobby to his surprise was decorated pretty modestly.
“Ignore it.” Tony growls, tugging him back down into a fiery kiss. Steve doesn’t even hesitate, immediately getting back into the rhythm of things.
Their lips smacked together with enough force to bruise, much hotter than the first time. Tony’s tongue didn’t hesitate, playing Steve’s bewilderment to his advantage as he slipped the slick muscle passed the blond’s slightly parted lips, dragging it across the tops of Steve’s perfectly straight teeth before tasting the inside of Steve’s mouth, savouring the vague hint of sweetness on his tongue.
“I bet it does,” Tony grunted. “Bring a hand up to your chest.” He added, his tone more demanding than suggestive, not that Steve really cared.
"Totally worth it.” Tony replied instantly, and Steve couldn’t help but smile at the certainty in his tone. “Look at you, already so hard for me. Were you jerking off in the shower?”
He took a moment to think it over. He knows how this works. People don’t want the true, boring answers, they want hot, artificial answers to fuel their fantasies and push them over the edge.
Instead of his usual rags, the soldier was dressed simply in a white t-shirt with a leather jacket thrown on top, and a pair of tight fitting, dark blue jeans.
Steve gave him a disapproving look for the sarcasm, but offered his hand as an anchor anyway, which Tony used to haul himself up out of the wreckage.
A slow grin stretched across the older man's face, and Tony felt an eerie chill race up his spine. “I never said these were about you.”
“Ah…Ah, fuck….” He moans, head lolling back against the edge of the desk as Tony sucks and rolls the small, perky nub between his teeth. His nipples are sensitive, and Tony is absolutely going to town on them. His dick is already drooling from the stimulation, leaving glossy trails over his stomach. It’s almost unbearable how turned on he is, he needs
Tony was quiet for a few beats, giving Steve a moment with his thoughts. He saw the clench of his jaw and his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed hard before replying in an almost broken voice. “Yeah, I miss her. Of course I miss her. She’s the only gal I think I ever really loved." He sighed with a forlorn shake of his head.
“Probably a good idea to stay on her good side.” Steve chuckled. Miss Pott’s was a force to reckon with when anyone dared strayed off schedule. Tony’s business would probably crumble if she wasn’t the one keeping everything on track. “I’ll see you later then?”
Steve couldn’t have imagined a place like this back in his day, but in the modern world every establishment seemed to have their own little gimmicks.
When the flask was half empty, Tony twisted around on the hood of the car so that he could face Steve properly, resting his weight on his elbow as a worrying grin played on his lips.
Steve didn’t quite seem to understand what Tony’s angle was, his eyebrows quirked curiously as the brunet continued to drive out of the city, so he trusted him to some degree or just accepted that Tony was kidnapping him because he just sat back and didn’t make any further comment.
…okay, okay. I uh, I'll figure something out and call you back.” He says, ripping off the headset before the other guy can even get a word in and lets it drop on the desk. He pushes a hand though his hair, completely ruining the perfect coif. “You weren’t supposed to be in today.” He pants, looking down at Steve with glossy eyes.
“Said the rent was already paid. In full.” He paused and looked at Steve, shoving a handful of crunchy rings into his mouth. “For the next three months.”
Besides, Pepper was the personally appointed CEO of his company after all, so he wasn’t about to sever ties with her completely. That, and he really did miss spending time with her, even if it was strictly friendship.
Steve stepped out of the shower and into the large, empty changing room, quickly dabbing most of the water off of his body before loosely tucking the towel around his waist. He reached into his duffle bag and grabbed his phone, idly scrolling through his recent notifications, slightly disappointed when there were no new messages. Tony was on a business trip to the studio's Japan branch at Fujikawa inc. over the last week touching base with the other company on some R&D so he hadn’t really seen or spoken to him in the last couple days.
He knew the request was coming, but the bluntness still caught him off guard. The other man's gaze drifted to him as he just sat there, hands frozen at the base of his shirt.
Steve lifts himself up on wobbly knees, grabbing the hand that the big, blond man offers him as an anchor to hoist himself up.
“One of these days, Cap’s gonna wish he wore a parachute.” Clint muttered from his perch by the edge of the open airlock, loading explosive arrows into his bow, rapid firing at the 40 feet tall mega iguanid while Tony rushed out of the ship, fully decked out in his armor and began shooting repulsor beams at the lizard.
He’d brought up on more than one occasion that Howard’s obsession with Captain America seemed a bit queer to him. He’d often met the back of his hand whenever he mentioned that.
Both of them glanced out the window and suddenly saw a car crashing through the wall of the building opposite them, sending out an explosion of shattered glass and bricks onto the street.
“Thanks.” Bucky muttered, still holding a teeny grudge against the little tin of cheap noodles as he grabbed the now open can of Chef Boyardee. He didn't even bother to put the metallic, tomato flavored slop in a bowl and heat it up and instead just set it down on the counter and shoved his spoon right into the can like some sort of animal.
“You could have ‘gotten to know me’ back home, I don’t see why you went through the trouble of taking me out.” Tony said, making air quotes as he spoke.
Jerking off for a group of perverts in front of a webcam wasn’t on his list of crowning achievements, but waiting tables part time didn’t earn a whole lot of cash, and it’s not like his Art degree was doing much for him aside from collecting dust in a drawer somewhere.
“I love the enthusiasm but I think that’s enough for today. We'll pick things up tomorrow. Until then go home and try not to jerk off, you’ll need the stamina for tomorrow.” He said with a wink.
One of the catches about his super serum infused body was that it required a super high intake of protein to keep him from getting lethargic. Lucky for him that Tony’s poor dietary habits meant that there were plenty of protein powders and vitamin supplements stocked in the kitchen. Not to mention eggs. It was hard to beat the pure protein that was packed into the small, oval packages.
Tony’s beard tickled him in a way that only made him more aroused, and before long Steve could feel the sticky ooze of pre-cum dripping onto his belly.
The woman's lavender eyes narrow at them. “I am Hala the Accuser, commanding general of the Kree Empire. You will bring me the one they call Tony Stark.”
They spent they spent the better half of the afternoon walking through the museum, Tony amused every time Steve went on a tangent about abstract art and how he didn’t understand how a few coloured lines across a blank sheet could be considered as any form of art.
“You’re sure that’s not jet fuel?” He wheezed, handing the flask back to Tony as he felt the booze burning a hole in his stomach lining.
Steve was out of his seat in an instance, rushing out of the diner and out towards the chaos as he usually did. Tony, not quite so brash, rolled back his sleeve to reveal his StarkWatch. He pressed a sequence of buttons on the device, twisting the face of the watch and rolled it over his fist, encasing his hand in a thin layer of vibranium glove with a repulsor on his palm. Once armed, he sprinted off after the Captain.
Steve’s back arches, practically screaming as electricity shoots through his veins. The pleasure is way more intense then he’s ever felt it before, toes curling as it rips through him.
Steve felt a throb go straight to his dick. The question was innocent enough, but he knew Tony was anything but chaste. His eyes shifted around the room, scanning for any other patrons. At 6am on a Saturday it was highly unlikely for anyone else to be at the studio but you never know.
Steve followed the woman down the halls, captivated by the sheer enormity of the place. It really was more like a hotel than a studio, he thought, looking at all the rooms and facilities. They had their own pool and spa, as well as a dozen other luxuries.
“What do you think I’ve been trying to do all these months?” Steve rebutted, his tone a mix of frustration, teetering on the edge of desperation.
“Tony, wait.” He called, just a bit surprised when Tony actually stopped and turned around to look at him.
Tony’s office is filled with the slick sounds of bodies moving together and heavy breathing. Steve is propped up on his elbows, head thrown back in pure bliss as Tony thrusts into him at bruising speeds.
Steve was about to pull back and throw his shield as a distraction but faltered, grunting when a stray bullet skimmed over his shoulder and sent a sharp throb of pain through his body. He knelt onto the ground, lifting his shield up to ward off another bombardment.
Tony tried to sit up but without the shock absorbers to neutralize the suit’s mass,  but his body couldn’t lift the extra hundred pounds of titanium alloy encasing his upper body. “Is there anything still working?” He asked, flopping back down on the ground.
With that, she left him to continue his vicious onslaught against the punching bag, giving his shoulder a friendly squeeze in parting.
It was early morning, probably way too early for any sane person to be up, but he’d needed some time to himself to unwind. Since he’d started up that contract with Rumlow, things had been tense to say the least. It was clear that that guy didn’t like him, and honestly Steve couldn’t care less. Sure, the money was good, but he really just agreed to sign on to help Tony out. Just a few more days of filming and then he’d never have to work with that pompous, egotistical asshole again, Steve could handle that.
The two Avengers were slowly making their way out of the stadium, pressed almost shoulder to shoulder as the crowd was corralled through the exits. They stopped by a concessions stand outside of the Stadium. Tony just got a regular vanilla soft serve while Steve got one of those ridiculous red white and blue popsicles.
Play to your strengths, Steve thinks to himself. If Tony Stark thinks he's some bashful, college twink than he’ll play along.
Sam snorted. “Yeah, he’s definitely got the whole Herculean thing going for him, but huge muscles and a big dick doesn’t do it for everyone. Some people like a bit more substance and you –” He pointed at Steve, wagging his index finger up and down. “You have substance.”
The pleasure began to take over Steve’s body, making him squirm and tug at the restraints until they were taut and looked just about ready to snap. He let out another muffled moan, tilting his head back and then dipped his chin forward, catching Tony watching him like a hawk would watch its prey.
“Why are you persistent about shutting me out?” Steve asked, on the cusp of desperation because he had tried his hardest not to come off as hostile. To be friendly and respectful and caring and every time he thought that Tony was finally coming around the brunet would shut him out. “I thought we were having fun together, why are you so against becoming friends?”
Tony won the fight with the doorknob after a brief struggle and they fell into the room. Tony nearly tripped over his pants, but he managed to get them down to his ankles, stepping out of them and dragging Steve with him.
They waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot, automatic doors sliding closed and leaving them secluded in the office room. The silence dragged on for a few moments after that, Tony’s hands shoved in his pockets as the two hovered around each other. The tension in the air was so thick you could probably cut it with a spoon. Steve was the first to break it.
He wasn’t exaggerating, at least not in his eyes. Tony was a beautiful man. Dark and handsome, perfectly groomed and radiating a heavy scent that made him feel dizzy with arousal. It was like his body pumped out pure sex pheromones out of his pores. Steve never felt so turned on by another person in his life but just kissing Tony was enough to make him painfully hard.
“Uh, any reason why my kitchen looks like something straight out of Cupcake wars?” The billionaire asked as he reached over the mess to make a grab for the pot of coffee and pour himself a cup. He eyed a spot of spilled batter on the counter top where it looked like Steve had set down his mixing spoon at some point.
The slight change of angle made the toy pop out, nudging against his tight sack and rubbing furiously at the spot just below his balls. Steve’s eyes shot open, arms and thighs flexing as he pulled on the leather and chains. The shock of pleasure was just enough to finally tip him over the edge, heavy streams of white shooting out all over his chest and stomach.
He hadn’t been to this place in a while, but in his younger days, once he could actually drive, he used to come here all the time. On most occasions he wouldn’t be alone, often bringing the women that he was trying to get lucky with here to make out with in the backseat of his car.
Heart stuttering in his chest, Steve grabbed at it instantly, eagerly scanning through his notifications.
Steve makes his way up to Tony’s office after handing out the extra coffees to a very appreciative Nat, Pepper and Sam, riding the lift all the way to the top floor. Sometimes Steve wonders if 88 floors is necessary to run an adult film business, but the view from Tony's office is certainly a plus.
Ever since their first meeting almost a year ago, Tony Stark continued to press his buttons in ways that even Steve’s controlled temper couldn’t ignore.
“They mentioned the whole gay rights movement briefly when they gave me a crash course on all the important moments of history that happened in the last 70 years, but I just…couldn’t really believe it.” He said, tone still unreadable, which only tugged on the tightening string of tension between them.
Tony kept his guard up until Rumlow was out of sight, then knelt down to get Steve out of his leather bindings and help him up, keeping him steady as he slowly rose on trembling legs. Tony must have noticed how wobbly he was because his brows pinched into a worried expression.
Those moments in the 70s, when he had gotten to be with Tony alone, had been the last happy moments of his life.
Steve fidgets with the phone in his pocket. There’s always that option. There’s no guarantee Tony will pick up ‒ and Steve won’t be the one to call him. It’s Tony choice, Steve can’t force himself on him.
”Tony,” Natasha says, sounding understanding for the first time. She smiles. Steve remembers the tears he shed for her.
Now, as the ship flickers into their view, getting rid off its disguise, Steve feels almost as anxious as Tony must be.
Bruce comes to stay for a couple of days. It's nice to have company. Steve can only imagine how lonely Tony had felt, completely alone in the tower.
All Steve's energy goes into preventing himself from breaking down. He puts his shaking hands behind his back, trying to breathe normally. Tony looks confused. He looks younger – he
ask Wilson to join us. I have nothing against the guy, sure, our natures don’t exactly match, but he’s proven himself an adept avenger. I do respect the guy.”
“Stark,” Bucky grunts, nodding at Tony. He looks at Wanda as well, but can’t conjure up her name. Then, his gaze returns to Steve, quietly signaling something like
They kiss and kiss, until Tony lets out a yelp, taking a step back from Steve. Steve tries to following him, but Tony gestures towards the window, eyes wide.
First, he’s going to help out his team. Then, he’s going to hide somewhere and build up the courage to face Tony ‒ hopefully by the time his phone stops being mute. And if that happened, he’d run ‒ he’d run to Tony.
Only then Steve notices a relatively young woman, maybe in her early 30s, standing a little further. He frowns nervously, but then Tony steps forward ‒ he’s intoxicating close, so close that Steve can smell his faint aftershave ‒ and says, “Don’t bother worrying, we can trust her. She’s Rhodey’s niece, or second cousin, or something, I don’t really remember. The main point is that Rhodey trusts her and so do I.”
“I feel no resentment towards him. Not anymore,” Wanda admits, “ I’ll go live with him. I have no fear to face him. Do you think he’ll take me in?”
Sharon shakes her head, saying, “No, in New York,” she pauses, seeming nervous. “Her name is Lisa-Marie.”
”Forget about it,” Tony mutters, already barging out of the room. ”By all means, talk to him. Let Jarvis know when I can come back to my workshop.”
“Jesus,” Bucky chuckles, “I get it Steve. I leave you deal with your feelings in peace. But don’t pretend they don’t exist! You should go for it, by the way. You two would be a literal power couple.”
He doesn't know what Tony's working on, head bowed, lips moving as he talks to Dum-E. Steve can do nothing but stand there, looking, looking at the love he lost and the chance he has.
”Jeeze, alright. I just came to tell you Barnes has been sighted in Europe,” Natasha says, hopping to sit on an empty table in front of Steve.
Tony's hand is placed on the couch, those beautiful calloused fingers that work miracles tapping the cushion. Steve wants to hold that hand, but he can't. He's left wanting.
”Yes,” Carol says, ”I was there. Thor cut his head off. He is dead. The Black Order are dead. His daughters – they have leaped side.”
“Give it time,” Steve repeats. He trust Tony will grow to grant Bucky forgiveness. It’ll happen when the pain and the betrayal doesn’t sting so sharp anymore.
“I would destroy the one who used the weapon,” Steve says, “Please, give him a chance. Life hasn’t been fair to him.”
“It was still these hands,” Bucky says, lifting them. His new metal one glints in the light. Steve can recognize it’s made of vibranium. “He will never be unable to see the blood in them. And I will never be able to completely wash it away.”
Just a nightmare, not real. Tony is here. Tony's heart beats and Steve can even pretend it's for him.
Tony is trying to look anywhere but Steve's face. He looks good in his skin-tight black shirt that accentuates his figure.
”Oh, really?” Tony shoots back sharply, placing his coffee on the counter. ”No offence, but what are you even doing here? I know, I told you you'd be welcome here – all of you, but after two years… Why now? What are you doing here? Why aren't you clinging to your past, chasing that Bucky guy? What do you
“Trying to restrain from spidering around too much. Isn’t going well ‒ at least every other day he’s beating up some mugger. Always too eager to call me about it. I told him he could be an avenger, you know? If he wanted to. Said he wasn’t ready yet, I guess this is his way of gaining experience. Smart kid.”
“No, I have business to do,” Steve says. He couldn’t let his team be locked up even one more day. “Thanks for the heads up, Shuri. You’re truly miraculous.”
“Well, Your H- T’Challa, I think it’s my time to leave,” Steve confesses, fiddling with the sleeve of his hoodie.
”I'm going to New York,” says Steve turning to Natasha. Something flashes in Natasha's eyes – surprise followed by realization – and then, her mouth turns into a knowing smirk. Gosh, Steve has missed that.
Sighing, Sharon continues, “I really miss her, though.” She places her head on Steve’s shoulder, something that Steve knows can be totally friendly in today’s context.
Not that T’Challa wouldn’t have been busy either way. But he does afford a sliver of time for Steve.
Steve cannot stop the steady flow of tears running down his face. He doesn't know why exactly he is crying: if it's because of Peggy or because of…
Wanda smiles softly, saying, “I assume you mean Tony, not Peter. He’s… Well, we don’t talk much. We weren’t that friendly to begin with. I think he’s afraid me, or at least of my powers. The vision is showed him… Anyway, I think he’s lonely. Did you know he broke up with his girlfriend? They’re still friends, but it’s awkward. Colonel Rhodes is all he has. And Vision ‒ but Vis is forced to stay in the facility so that no suspicions will rise. I would rather have him here, and he wishes so as well, and so does Tony, but…”
”What the hell?” Tony splutters. Steve knows he's about to call the Iron Man suit, so he raises his hand as a gesture for Tony to stop.
“Who made him a new arm?” Tony suddenly says. He’s come forward, eyeing Bucky’s arm warily because it’s attached to the killer of his parents, but clearly impressed. Bucky puts his arm behind his back like a child.
“Steve?” T’Challa calls after him. “Do not worry about your friend,” he assures, “Shuri is working on it. He won’t be the Winter Soldier for long.”
”How- How did this happen?” Tony stutters out, his voice an octave higher. His fingers have come up to trace the remnants of the kiss on his lower lip. ”
He didn’t sleep much in the first place, but now his nights were spent wide awake, clutching his phone, waiting for it to ring, ring, ring… He would have answered it in a heartbeat.
“Stark,” Clint elaborates with a grunt, “He came when we first had been locked up. I thought he was there to boast. Preach about his victory. But-“
When the door opens, Steve runs. Tony looks startled, baffled, and the look on his face makes Steve slow down.
Steve thinks. He thinks about Bucky and Sam, and their constant bickering. He’ll be glad if Bucky ever gets to that stage with Tony.
Wanda smirks. “No, you know I don’t do that. Besides, you’d know.” The smile dies from her face, turning into a slightly worried expression. “I’m pretty good at reading people without invading their heads. And your emotions are clear on your face. Plus the fact that you made Sam call Tony instead of grabbing the phone yourself.”
One evening, he receives a message from Shuri. She informs him that something came up in Wakanda, and she couldn’t work on “Operation Bucky”, but now she’s back on track.
“There are worse couples,” Bucky says, as the complications between were just a minor things. “Did you have feelings for him before this mess?”
Sam comes to their rescue ‒ apparently his cousin owns a cottage somewhere in Minnesota, deep in the middle of the woods.
Steve’s heartbeat skyrockets. It’s all over the place. “I can’t stop thinking about you either,” he confesses, wiping the tears from his face. His pressing the phone hard against his ear with his other hand, as if it would bring him closer to Tony.
How to get in contact with Tony has established itself as the problem. They can’t just march Wanda into the facility. They do trust Tony to take her in and take care of her. They trust him to hide her so that no one will know her location, but there are two things they have to take into account: the fact there could be someone who’s not on their side ‒ they’re all three wanted criminals, after all ‒ and that Steve, well, couldn’t handle facing Tony, despite the ache in his chest.
She comes back the next day, and the next, and the next... “All they know is that I’m seeing someone in Philadelphia,” she says one evening when they’re watching some black-and-white movie from the 50s. Steve hasn’t have nothing else to do than to strengthen his popular culture knowledge, and think about Tony, and brood.
It was decided quickly. There was no other option for Steve than to say ‘yes’ when Tony hesitantly asks Steve if he wants to come stay with Tony.
“I wasn’t you. It was HYDRA, using you,” Steve says sternly. He’s not going to let Bucky feel bad about this. If he must, he’s going to spend the rest of his life reminding Bucky ‒ and Tony ‒ that Bucky wasn’t at fault.
Steve considers it for a moment. “No,” he finally says, “It was… I guess I really needed a kiss.” He chuckles. “A distraction. Hell, I thought I was going to have to fight a handful of super soldiers. Ended up fighting my friends instead… And you were there, and friendly.”
He thinks of Pepper, the mourning brave widow in the future. Pepper fighting in the Rescue armor. And little Morgan, bright-eyed child who had always called him Uncle Steve. Little Morgan who'd have to grow up without her father, who had loved her more than anything.
“We have readied a ship for you,” she says, “Amara will fly you overseas, nothing else. Then you’ll be on your own.”
”It's fine,” Tony says, his smile a little broken. ”I mean, Bruce comes to stay sometimes, quite often, actually. And Thor swung by just last week. Hilarious guy.”
“Hey,” Sharon says, punching his arm gently, “Stop thanking me! I want to help. And don’t worry ‒ I’m good at this. SHIELD will never know.”
There's only one thing Steve cannot tell to Tony, besides the grim future that doesn't even exist in this place and time – not if Steve can do something about it.
It all feels natural to Steve, to live and be with Tony. Them alone together in the tower, watching movies, cooking, Steve listening to the music Tony plays him. Steve talking to Tony about Bucky, Peggy, Sam. Sharing his life with him. Tony is a good listener, attentive, those gorgeous brown eyes always sharp and understanding.
He doesn’t know what to say. He’s freezing, feeling colder than in Siberia, colder than when he was sleeping in the ice for 70 years.
”I'm not lying. And I'm not going anywhere,” Steve says. He wants to grab Tony and pull him against him, kiss his hair and make him believe he's wanted.
“If a weapon destroyed something important to you, wouldn’t you want to destroy the weapon?” Tony whispers hoarsely. His eyes look conflicted.
”And?” Steve says. He has forgotten that at the time, Bucky had been Steve's priority. It all has changed. Steve can't look after Tony
“You have a visitor, Ms. Maximoff,” Lisa-Marie announces. Wanda’s head snaps up faster than lightspeed, her eyes hopeful. The hope in her eyes die for a nanosecond, then it’s replaced by joy.
However, this is another level. If Sharon gets caught, it’s another life Steve has indirectly ruined. He sighs.
It’s silent, until Tony says softly, “I would have answered. I did ‒ when you made Wilson call. Gosh, I was so mad when I heard his voice. I was so disappointed it was him.”
“When I joined the Avengers, I never knew it’d come to this. Sam Wilson, the Falcon, now an outlaw… With Captain America of all people… What are we going to do now?”
A light smile dawns on Wanda’s face. “Thank you,” she says. Then, after a pause, “That’s not all there is?”
The next evening, a Wakandan ship lands near Tony’s estate. Steve, Tony, and Wanda stand waiting like the world’s oddest reception committee. Steve can feel the anxiety come off from Tony in waves, but Wanda is calm as the night.
There’s no use for him here ‒ even Bucky is deep asleep, resembling dead more than alive. He’s alone. He would be alone anywhere else too, but what was he going to do, just sit and sketch while T’Challa’s people kept him fed and comfortable?
He wouldn’t hate Tony, not even over this. There had been much at stake, but Steve had realized long ago that Tony was the one who had been hurt the most. Sure, Steve didn’t agree with the Accords and sure, Tony shouldn’t have went after Bucky, but‒
he almost says, but that would only infuriate Tony further. Instead, he tries to convey it with his eyes.
”Nothing. Just good to be home, I guess,” Steve sighs. Laughs. He wants to scoop Tony up in his arms and…
Until one day, Steve finds himself standing at the shore of the Potomac River, the same shore he had once lain unconscious on.
“Bucky,” Steve says, “He’s up. Shuri ‒ T’Challa’s sister ‒ has decoded him. No one will ever be able to use him again.”
“Of course she did,” Tony says, “She’s Shuri. She can do anything, including make a new arm for the former Winter Soldier.”
They didn’t know. His team didn’t know what had went down in Siberia ‒ the only ones who did were Steve, Tony and Bucky. Not even T’Challa knew the whole truth. He hadn’t been
As if Steve didn't half-carry him into his bedroom, constantly assuring Tony that he wasn't leaving.
The threat isn't over and it had been hard for Steve to remain vague enough, to not to reveal the truth to anyone. If Fury had found out, he'd for sure made sure that Steve returned to where he came from.
“Tell Bucky what?” says Bucky, suddenly appearing behind the girls. He has that habit ‒ emerging from nowhere.
“Why did you call me?” Steve has to ask, squeezing his shut. Suddenly, he feels asthmatic again, almost forgetting how to breathe. Tony doesn’t answer. The only sounds Steve can hear are his neighbors’ muffled shouts coming from upstairs.
“No,” Steve says, “I think about you constantly. Every minute ‒ every hour at least. I can’t let go of my phone in case you happen to call. And tonight, you did.
As Pepper walks away to find Tony, Steve stares after her. If he wants to have Tony, he needs to sweep in soon.
He finally does, and Tony is completely silent after that. The hurt in his eyes mirrors the hurt Steve had seen in Siberia. But Bucky isn't present and Steve doesn't have to choose.
“I know you and Stark have a complicated past, but I didn’t know you could be this pathetic. What’s stopping you from going ahead and confronting him? Kissing his brains out? Don’t bullshit me, Rogers, I know you have feelings. I can even hear them from the way you say the guys name.” Sam rolls his eyes. “
It startles Steve who had been brushing his teeth. He grabs the phone from the pocket of his sweatpants, almost breaking it in his grip. First, he thinks it’s Sam, or Sharon, or Shuri, even though they
about, these days. When Tony stays still, Steve swallows and continues, ”Please. I just had to be with you.”
Nat has cut her hair. That’s the first thing Steve notices as she struts towards them. It’s still bright red, but reaches her chin now.
“Take care,” he says to Scott, who nods, a little dazed, salutes at Sam and then runs off until he shrinks himself, disappearing into the world.
His life is quiet and uneventful ‒ even peaceful, except for his tumultuous mind. He follows the news, he reads, he watches movies with Sharon, texts with Sam.
dangerous woman, but on the other hand she’s only a girl who has a hard time understanding her powers.
she writes, and that cheers Steve up a little bit. He hopes everything’s alright in Wakanda. He wonders if he could have helped.
“We’ll be fine,” Steve says, trying not make his voice tremble. Tony’s eyes are wide and startled. It looks like he’s not entirely there. “Go back to your room, Wanda.”
“I was just trying to be considerate,” mutters Tony, sitting on the couch Steve and Wanda had occupied a couple of hours ago. He takes a generous sip, and proceeds to stare at the bottom of the glass, undeniably some expensive crystal collectable left from Howard and Maria.
“I’m sorry, I have to get this,” she excuses herself. Steve hears her talking to the phone as she walks away, “Yes, Mr. Parker? No, he’s in a meeting. I don’t know…”
Steve does pay a visit to Bucky before making his way to his ship, tapping the glass in front of his friend’s tranquil face, unable to resist a sad smile.
, seeing those bright brown eyes flash in his mind, seeing the light in them disappear, makes Steve's heart clench painfully.
Steve recalls the broken state Thor had been in after Thanos and swallows thickly. Maybe Thor should have returned the stones. He had deserved a second chance.
”Steve?” It's Natasha, standing unsure in the doorway, holding a bottle. Her hair sticks to the sheen of sweat on her face and neck.
Steve, knowing Tony's habits of spending hours in the workshop without eating, states, ”Tony, you have to eat. See you in the kitchen in a minute or two?”
“So, care to explain what are we doing in Stark’s house?” Bucky asks as he enters Steve’s room later in the evening. He leans on the doorway, crossing his arms, staring at Steve quizzically.
“Tony,” Steve says again. His lips pull into a smile. Even though everything hurts, he’s so happy. It’s
Instead, Fury had ran off to consult Carol Danvers. And maybe she could find the Guardians and Thor should go with them, and they could deal with Thanos,
Thanos isn't their problem. Thanos is the problem of the entire universe. There are three infinity stones on Earth. Three too much.
After Clint has bidden his goodbyes, retiring perhaps for real now, Steve looks at Wanda. “Where to?” he asks her.
“Me?” he answers, “Nothing special. Talked with Bucky. Watched Wanda and Shuri play chess. Texted Sam. An uneventful day in total.”
T’Challa’s words warm his heart, but he really needs to go. “As much as I’d like to stay and as safe as I could be here, I have things to do,” Steve explains.
Tony doesn’t reply anything, and Steve doesn’t open his mouth, but it still feels like they’re communicating.
After watching the sunset in Wakanda, Steve ponders for a moment. Then, he requests to see T’Challa. The prince ‒ the
Yes, Clint and Natasha were friends that had to momentarily turn against each other, but Steve was a man whose heart beat for Tony Stark.
He pushes the thoughts away and clears his throat, “Just Steve, Your Highness,” he corrects softly, “I don’t believe Captain Rogers exists anymore.”
“I believe she’s on a mission,” Wanda says, “That’s what I’ve gathered. Rhodes is still recovering. You do know what happened to him, don’t you?”
”Hold up, Nat,” Steve says urgently, ”I'll call you back later.” He disconnects the call and runs to meet up with Tony.
T’Challa interrupts them, striding forward, Shuri following in his footsteps. “Mr. Stark, Ms. Maximoff, is good to see you,” he says to Tony and Wanda, who mutter a “your highness” in greeting.
The thought tempted Steve, but he had made up his mind. Bucky would understand. Bucky would follow him, T’Challa would take care of that.
Taking a moment, Steve answers, “No. He never was. We had a big ugly disagreement, that’s true, but I never hated him. And I hope he never hated me.”
Then, they're kissing. Languid, heated kisses that make Steve's whole body tingle to the tips of his toes. Their tongues meet and Tony pushes Steve, leads them to the couch. He climbs on top of Steve and Steve feels wild.
He thinks of Carol then, the ally he had barely known, and her unquestionable loyalty to Fury. Their friendship that made Fury seem like a completely different person.
Tony makes his way to the cabinet, grabbing a bottle of whiskey, and pouring himself a fair amount. He inclines the bottle towards Steve, and asks, “You want some?”
Sam pours ketchup on his fries. He looks starved. “Mm… Some assistant chick came and grabbed Wanda into a car with tinted windows. Didn’t say much. Apparently they’re going to New York in a private jet. Don’t know where Stark’s going to hide her. I don’t think she can go to the HQ with Vision, it’s too heavily supervised.”
”You're leaving, aren't you,” Tony says, clearly trying to hold back the tremor creeping into his voice.
The glint in T’Challa’s eyes tells Steve that he understands exactly what he means. “Very well,” T’Challa says, leaning forward, patting Steve’s shoulder. “We’ll ready you a ship.”
For once, it isn't Bruce's voice saying ”five seconds” in the back of his head. It's Tony's voice, promising all his teammates they were always welcome to come live in the tower.
”You better not be kidding. Or Pepper and Rhodey will have to deal with your kneecaps, and there's this kid, Harley, who'll gladly join, I'm sure.”
They wind up in the common room, no Wanda or Lisa-Marie in sight. Actually, Steve thinks Lisa-Marie has gone home already.
“I’ll…” Sam says clutching the phone, “Go to the other room.” The bedroom door shuts behind him, and Steve and Wanda are left alone in silence. Sam speaks so quietly, maybe on purpose, that not even Steve’s enhanced hearing can make out the words.
One evening, Natasha arrives at the tower, unannounced. It's a quiet calm evening. Steve likes those evenings, the two of them retreated in the workshop, Tony's music playing in low volume so that they can still talk if they want to. Sometimes they don't, which is fine.
“Right,” Steve says. Sharon’s words have managed to calm him down. They stare at each other, and Steve remembers their kiss. That was… complicated. Something they perhaps need to talk about.
”But you are,” Tony states. A bead of sweat trickles down his temple. ”Aren't you? You're leaving with Natasha to chase your old buddy.”
“Yeah,” Tony smirks. He hasn’t let go of Steve’s hand. Leaning forward, he gives Steve a chaste and unsure kiss, which Steve returns eagerly.
Steve trains and draws. He considers to leave to seek Bucky with Natasha and Sam, but he can't leave the tower.
“So, how was your day?” Tony asks suddenly, throwing the empty carton on the table. He turns towards Steve, unintentionally shuffling a bit closer so that his leg hits Steve’s hand. Steve retreats his hand as if it had been burned.
“I don’t know,” Steve admits. Sometimes it still looks like Tony wants to flinch when he’s in Steve’s company.
”Oh, nothing,” Tony groans, ”Just a minor, tiny disagreement.” When Steve frowns, Tony adds, ”Don't worry, Cap. It's under control.”
Steve wishes he was as brave as Wanda. Seeing Tony is something Steve wants badly, but he can’t do it. Not just yet. He is not ready to see that hurt cloud Tony’s eyes again.
“Do you think we beat Vision and Wanda in the weirdest couple competition?” Tony laughs as their part.
Steve knows he's being selfish. He knows Sam and another Bucky are waiting for him, five seconds away. He knows
After Tony soon finds out Shuri excels in the medical field as well, he immediately takes her to Rhodey. Some new guy called “Strange” had apparently been treating Rhodey, and Rhodey was gradually gaining mobility, but Tony still waited for a miracle.
”Yes,” Steve softly agrees. He know that as of now, Tony and Pepper are broken up. Steve remembers their relationship was on-off for years until they finally worked it out.
Captain America and the Hulk deal with a minor situation in Queens. Then, Bruce leaves. Thor arrives the day after, apologizing he wasn't there to help. Steve says it was nothing.
“Are we on the same page now?” Steve whispers, lightly caressing Tony’s cheek with his thumb. “You’re not lingering in the past?”
“Bucky… He killed Tony’s parents when he was the Winter Soldier. Tony… He didn’t take it well, even though Bucky was under mind control at the time. The worst thing is-“ Steve closes his eyes. He can see the hurt, the raw pain in Tony’s eyes.
Steve touches his beard self-consciously. It was something that Sharon constantly teased him about, but it was a necessity. With facial hair, he’s harder to recognize. Captain America was always clean shaven.
Time ticks by. The five seconds could be up any moment, but Steve consciously forgets about them. Of course, the future still worries him. The only comfort and hope he has is that Fury has contacted him, informing him that Carol Danvers is looking into Thanos – it doesn't look good. Next time Thor swings by tower, Steve needs to send him Fury's way.
Now, all the infinity stones, plus Mjörnir, rest in their right times and places. Steve has completed his mission, the only thing he has left to do is to go home.
No. Steve couldn't. Even thinking about his name or his otherworldly beautiful face was too painful. Yet, Steve couldn’t stop. Tony wouldn't leave him alone.
Steve realizes he hasn’t been building a team all these years. He has been building a rag tag family.
He wishes he could feel all of Tony at once as he runs his palms over Tony's arms, shoulders, back, ass, thighs…
Steve puts away the sketchbook, hating the way Tony's smile stiffens on his face. Natasha notices that too, shuffling her feet awkwardly. ”But I can stay for a couple of days,” she hastily adds.
Steve takes Tony’s face in his hands, smiles at him softly. The wondrous look in Tony’s eyes is beautiful. “We aren’t weird,” Steve says, “We’re just meant to be, sweetheart.”
When Nat has gone to her room, Steve takes a shower and returns to the workshop where he finds Tony working as hard as ever, quietly muttering things to the bots.
And Thanos. Thanos definitely cannot happen again. Just the thought of seeing that ugly purple face makes Steve nauseous.
He can’t help but to think what the situation resembles: like they’re two tired husbands trying get a few minutes alone at the end of the day. Asking the how are yous, talking about the kids… In a way, Steve and Tony are the parents ‒ then there’s the rogue daughter Wanda, the zealous son Peter who’s calls are a routine part of the day, and grumpy uncle Bucky, and Shuri who is Shuri.
The silence seems to be too awkward for him, so Tony speaks, asking something out of nowhere, “You know what? You
”I'm not kidding,” Steve whispers into Tony's ear and Tony slumps against him. He nudges Steve's face with his chin, stubble scratching Steve's jawline.
