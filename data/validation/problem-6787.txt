If there was one constant fact throughout the universe it was that Tony Stark loved coffee. So it only made sense that he would open his own shop. He thinks its the best decision he ever made, he had worked in the tech industry for years made a ton of money now he was taking some time to slow down.
Tony broke away with a choked sound. “Oh shit. I am so sorry.” He couldn’t even look at Bucky. “I’m so sorry. I’ll be in the back please just…. Don’t break my shop.” And then he was locking himself in the back.
“Wait to make a move on me? What is going on?” Tony questioned at the same time Steve yelled. “Bucky!”
Yeah, Tony decided that was something he definitely wasn’t doing. He kept the note, though he didn’t know why. He called Pepper and told her everything. She said he was being dumb, he told her just to bring ice cream. She did only because it was better than him drinking himself into a stupor.
“Hey, Tony you got a second I want to introduce you to someone.” Steve had been smiling and Tony couldn’t just ignore him so he stopped and turned back to the pair. “Tony this is Bucky, Bucky this is Tony.”
“No, what I’m mad about is that Steve told me the time wasn’t right to make a move on you and then he went and did it anyway. Then you ignored us.” Bucky looked very close to stomping his foot by the time he finished speaking.
He had more time with his friends, they even helped him with the shop. He had more time to just have a life. He even thought about getting back into the dating scene, it had been far longer than he cared to admit. He would even admit that he had his eye on a certain someone. He was tall, blonde, so handsome, and the muscles on that man were mouth watering.
“What?” Bucky addressed Steve first then he sighed. “Look Tony we both like you, a lot. I’ll admit at first when Steve started talking about this guy he met I kind of wanted to punch you.” Tony cringed away. “But then I met you and you, well you are just so incredible and its been killing us watching you with those other people.”
“Look, guys, the shop is closed I have to ask you to leave.” He sighed closing his eyes and resting his hands on the counter.
He was in the shop for another late night, he was in the shop for most of the night shifts because he knew it was less likely that Steve and Bucky would come in. He had just finished everything up and was picking up his things from behind the counter when the door opened and closed.
Worst of all Steve still tried to flirt with Tony, even with Bucky right there. Though Bucky had started his fair share flirting too. He even seemed to encourage Steve’s attempts. Normally Tony would be fine with two hot men flirting with him but these two, they were clearly together so what in the hell were they playing at.
He waited in the back until he heard the door close and the men leave. Tony was tentative as he opened the door but he didn’t see them. As he walked out to lock up the front he found a piece of paper on Steve and Bucky’s table, it will always be their table. It had their names, phone numbers and a little note: Dear Tony, We know this all seems strange but no one is upset, not really. We don’t want to mess this up. Please call, Steve & Bucky.
Everything started to move slower then. Steve reached out and held his waist in one hand and his cheek in the other. Tony could have moved but he didn’t want to. He let Steve lean in and then he couldn’t take it and moved in the rest of the way for a kiss. And oh was it a kiss, he felt a heat move through him the instant their lips touched. Steve took control of the kiss quickly, holding him tight.
Pepper saw everything and set up another date for the next day. He was a doctor so the date was actually in the shop, which he didn’t mind it made it easier to bail if he had to. Though he found he didn’t want to. He was funny in a dry way like Tony was. He was intelligent and also very good looking. He kept Tony engaged he hardly even noticed the tenseness from his two favorite customers.
Steve looked up clearly annoyed and just crossed his arms. Bucky huffed, “Yeah we are good just a little disagreement.” Clearly, that was the end of the conversation so he let it go.
He should have known then that things would only get worse from there. Bucky started coming into the shop with Steve. They gravitated around each other. They always seemed to be touching in some way, making eyes at each other. Tony would be more upset if Steve didn’t look so god damned happy.
Tony honestly tried to be more social but he just couldn’t take it. “It was nice meeting you.” He gave a wave and took off out of the shop. He got drunk that night and cried to Pepper, she called him ridiculous and bought him ice cream, she really was the best.
He said goodbye to the Doctor and he gave him a lingering kiss on the corner of his mouth with a smirk. He waved after him with a smile. Then he noticed Steve and Bucky quietly arguing. He walked closer cautiously.
“Awe Tony you are a doll you don’t have to do that.” Bucky smiled but took his cup and sipped at it eyes still on tony.
“I would say its probably not true but I feel like Steve here isn’t much of a liar.” Tony let his own smirk cross his face a little less flirty and a little wrier.
“No no, he didn’t. He wanted something I told him to take a hike it was fine.” He looked at the angry stance Bucky had curiously.
Steve sucked in a breath and moved himself and Tony to their little table. They sat and talked for hours. Tony sent his employees home early and just sat and talked with Steve. Steve was also upset, he and Bucky had had a disagreement that day. It was getting later as they sat talking and Tony eventually decided they should probably go. Steve offered to help with the last bit of cleaning. They both leaned in to pick up the last chair their bodies coming in closer contact than they had ever been. Tony lost his breath as Steve just stared at him.
There was a sound and all the red danger lights vanished. The sound of Dr. Strange's breath was gone too. Maggie opened her eyes. He wasn't sitting across from her. Whatever weird dimension he shifted them into so she couldn't sense danger anymore, he'd not come with her this time. She sighed and closed her eyes. He wasn't going to leave her there. She'd sense danger on herself if he was going to.
"I still don't eat right sometimes and I get really guilty if I don't finish all my food or if I get sick. Trauma's weird like that." Peter responded.
"Nerd, more like. Your first day of freedom from school and you choose community service. Lame." Wade teased, poking her shoulder.
"Always." Tony added to Steve's words. "Now, let's go home and curl up somewhere and watch a movie, yeah?"
"No." Nat said, folding her arms over her chest. "You got us names. Clint and I will take care of those. We'll leave him to you and Wade."
"Kick his ass, Steve." Nat said, sitting on the edge of the obstacle course, watching with a smile. "Sorry, kid, but I don't like losing."
"Well, now we know who to look for." Tony looked at Strange. "I don't exactly have inter-dimensional cell service."
"Hey, sweetie. I'm just going to run a couple tests. I know you're tired and we want you to get lots of rest, so we'll make this quick, okay?"
"Love you too." Peter knew well enough that neither of his new parents were thrilled to see him vigilante-ing. They both understood, of course, why Peter wanted to do it, why he felt the need to go out there and help. Neither of them wanted that stress and pain for Peter. Peter'd heard them talk about it. He'd also heard how reluctant they were to let him go out, given his age. But, Peter, back before they were even going to foster him, had made it very clear he wouldn't stay if he couldn't be Spiderman. He loved them...so much...but he had to be Spiderman. He knew from experience that he had the power to stop bad things from happening...and if they happened it was on him. They'd had many reservations...but as far as Peter was concerned, they'd struck a good deal with him. If he had to follow more rules...then he would if it meant he could keep people safe.
"There's an intern named Peter Parker. He's the personal intern of Stark. I need some information from him." Stane turned his computer around. "This is his partial plans for a power source. I need the full details and I need him to make it better, but it's not in the system, so I need it from the kid."
When Peter glanced at the assignments, he saw that Ned had actually decided to take it upon himself to do most of Peter's homework himself. It had made him smile, since Ned had actually done a decent job mimicking his handwriting.
What the hell was Maggie doing up at that time of night? In New York it had to be close to two in the morning. Why was she awake? She'd been using her powers a lot recently. He put out the fires and rushed to Wong. "Hey, can you guys hold the fort down?"
Peter walked down the hallway and swiped his card at the lab doors. He looked around the room, taking in the faces. Some of the usuals were there. He waved to Tracy and smiled. There was a man Peter'd never seen working with some sort of holograph. He was tall, with blue eyes, dark hair, and beard. He smiled warmly at Peter. "Hey, you must be Mr. Parker." The man waved his hand and the holographs disappeared. "Tracy was babbling about you. You got the internship, huh?"
"Don't think too hard, kid. We did scramble your brains a bit." The man put the knife down and ruffled his hair. "Lots of nurses in Stark Tower for the A-team. Had one of my people act as a stand-in. Gotta love double majors, am I right?" He laughed. "Nurse Joy only needed to record a sound while you were all sleeping. Nothing untoward about checking a heartbeat in a medbay, right? Your powers never even suspected. That was tricky, getting around your powers and that girl's... Well, don't have to worry about her anymore." He shrugged.
"Mom didn't really work with me...my head stuff. She got lost for a while. Teachers didn't want anything to do with me, I was too difficult. And the special education teacher I had treated me like shit. They told me it would probably always be...well their word for me was 'stupid'." She bit her lip. "Then I started noticing that I couldn't keep my powers and my mind at the same time. Then HE showed up. My powers were the only thing that kept him from doing worse than he'd already done to me. I didn't WANT to get better. I was afraid if I got better someone else might try to hurt me like him and I wouldn't be able to get away."
Peter frowned, wishing he could REALLY talk to his friend. "He's okay, a bit banged up is all." Peter's jaw tightened and he did his sit-ups a little faster. He couldn't stand Mr. Stane. He'd give him a visit as Spiderman if Tony AND Steve hadn't expressly forbidden it.
She was standing in the alley, leaning against the wall. Something was...weird. Her watch was ticking but...it didn't sound like it was coming from her direction. It sounded like it was coming from the right, by the dumpsters, not from where she stood on the left. He didn't like that...something was off. Had she taken it off? She never took it off. The same way he didn't take off the one his dad had made him.
"Mental health comes first, Itsy Bitsy." She said before taking a small sip. "Oh my gosh. Thank you, this is really good."
"Dad, she was right there. I...I saw her. She heard me shout her name. She turned and looked around. I SAW her. Dad. She was there. How was she there? She can't be there."
"You have to get far too close to the enemy to be effective. You need another means of attack. Something that works over a distance. Otherwise, you'll have to rely far too much on your abilities to get close to someone."
"Sorry..." She whispered. "I just..." Peter walked down the alleyway. Then his spidersense went off like crazy.
She got upset easily and Peter didn't blame her for it, he freaked out over little things too since he'd gotten out. But when she fumbled over a word too long, she'd start crying. When she'd seen the state of her hair, she'd cried for an hour. It wasn't her crying that upset Peter... He felt like he'd had a part in her crying. It was his fault. He'd left her there, with them. And they'd taken that anger out on her. He felt guilty every time he saw her struggle. Every time she stumbled when she walked. Every time she cried. Every time she lost focus.
"Smoosh it down real flat, yeah, Peter, I know." Delmar waved him off. "Getting ready for school again?"
"Scary. She'd need a good teacher. Good thing she has one." Wong nodded. "And she's a good kid. It's good when powerful mutations or abilities end up in caring hands rather than vengeful hands."
Pepper patted his shoulder. "And now you're calmed down. It's best not to go out there nervous, they can smell fear."
A short while later, Steve was home. Peter was standing on the ceiling, tongue out in concentration as he mashed buttons. Tony was sitting on the couch, also pressing buttons as cartoon characters battled on the screen. "Yes! YES! I win!" Peter screamed in victory.
He took a deep breath. "I don't want to subject her to that sort of...test if it's unnecessary." He'd seen most of her body from helping Christine clean her and searching for wounds. It wasn't his normal area...but everyone was taught the signs of sexual assault. She hadn't appeared to have any bruises or marks that indicated such assault. He'd ask her...if she was in a place to answer. It would be a rough conversation, but it was necessary. And if she was... He'd ask Christine, of course...because she'd seen more cases in the ER and because she was a woman. Doctor or not, unconscious or not, Strange knew Maggie'd be more comfortable with a woman. "We'll figure it out. Thus far, that we know of, she'll heal physically. Not sure...how we're going to shape up mentally, but she'll...pull through." Lots of things could happen with brain injuries...people could change, even without all the psychological trauma on top of the actual physical trauma.
I sort of view this the same way as a Peter and May + Tony thing found in most headcanons. May is Peter's guardian and loves him very much, but he needs a father figure which is Tony. Same principal here. I didn't want to come across or have Maggie come across as devaluing Wade and Vanessa, she loves them very much, but there's a different more parental relationship forming with her and Dr. Strange. Re-reading it felt a little weird, but I didn't feel like I got it 'right'. So hopefully this answers any confusion.
"Nat." Steve shrugged. "Or maybe even a member of SHIELD. If we have someone watching Peter's school and dance classes, we don't have to worry about anything outside of Stark Tower. All we have to do is keep him safe here. It's not like anyone knows he's Spiderman, so let him go out and be Spiderman. But if we have someone who can blend in, disappear to just keep an eye out for him outside the house, he'll be safe."
Peter sighed in relief. He knew that voice. He crawled over the hole and looked down. "Hey, Pastor Aaron."
"You're safe. I checked all of them." Strange promised. "I have the advantage of being able to see if the astral matches what we see on the outside."
"Well that's what you did. Sheesh." She straightened up and looked around. Without a word, she sat down in the armchair. "So he's the artist formally known as Wong, right?"
She felt Vanessa's soft hand wrap around hers. She was safe. And Strange would be able to help the other's. Maybe then no one would have to worry about the horrible holographs. She squeezed Vanessa's hand and felt Strange's hand leave hers.
Peter stared with wide eyes. "You didn't list ballet." She was amazing at ballet. She didn't go to a professional school, but she could BE a professional.
"She trusts you. And that's good. We want to foster that as much as possible. We want her to know there are good people out there who wouldn't hurt her. We want her to call for help instead of trying to handle things herself. We want her to have people like you around." Vanessa lifted her eyes to glare at him. "But we're choosy too. Do you care about her? Truly care?"
"Yes, Peter." Without another word, Peter got down to the first floor and walked out the front doors. Anger fueling his steps. He'd just been trying to help, to keep his dad healthy, to keep him out of trouble with Steve and Cho. And Tony'd snapped at him. He'd IGNORED their signal, the one sacred thing they'd created to keep Peter from getting too stressed. It hurt. What the fuck was up with his dad?
"Tell me something only we would know." Her voice was croaky and weak. Her vocal cords had to be abused...from screaming and from being strangled.
"He um...he was going to stop a weapons transfer and something big hit him from his blind side. He didn't see it coming."
"You and your boy owe us an explanation." Nat poked him with her finger firmly. "And you'd better thank Spiderman. If he hadn't said what he did we would have taken out Iron Man, hard."
"No you don't!" Maggie insisted. She lifted her hand. Green light glowed off of her and then coated the entire ceiling. Like a rippled over water, the light just kept spreading, stretching further and further. The watch on her wrist was still ticking at the same pace. She wasn't slowing herself or speeding herself. Had she...slowed the whole BUILDING down? "That's new."
"Her grades are abysmal. She's been caught sneaking out of class, claiming panic attacks. She's lazy. She pretends like she's incapable of reading sometimes. She's always got some sort of excuse, always some lie lines up. She's a troubled child. And I don't think you've known her long enough to get the feel of her manipulations."
"That's what Happy said." Tony agreed. "Don't worry about anything. You're Papa's working on it with Nat and Clint. I've already done a complete background check on the guy using facial recognition."
She walked across the floor slowly, gingerly. Then seemed to relax, putting her bag down on the sofa.
"Well, I can't judge his mental health, but physical health is an extension of it. Considering all he's been through, he's doing very well. I think you and Steve have something to do with that." She smiled as she got her paperwork together and slipped it into a folder. "Now, you are good to go, still nothing strenuous, okay?"
"Sweet." Ned beamed. "And when you actually do get married, I best be your best boi. Not best man: best boi, specifically."
"Yeah, it is. I know you don't like sitting still. Thought you might like to hear a story to occupy you."
Maggie groaned as her head hit the wall again. She kept her back pressed to the wall, so they couldn't see that she'd been digging into it. The brick was nearly loose. Her fingertips were bloody, her nails broken. She couldn't stop though. She felt some of her hair get ripped from her skull as the man yanked on it. "What are you doing with those powers of yours?"
"Accidents happen. It's okay." Her body was still glowing red, probably because the heat was still burning her skin. A cool cloth did sound nice. Maybe the shop sold merch. She could change her shirt in the bathroom. She started inside. The man held the door open. She headed for the counter.
Wade answered, wearing only boxers and holding a sword. "Mags. Shit. Are you okay?" He dropped the sword and put a hand on her shoulder. She flinched, then sobbed and he drew his hand away like he'd been burned. "Sh, sh, sh. Honey, I've got you." He glared at Dr. Strange. "What the fuck happened to our girl?" He asked as Vanessa appeared over his shoulder.
Peter opened his eyes briefly to try to figure out where he was. Then he closed his eyes again and ran. He needed to get somewhere where he couldn't be watched. Then he could try to get somewhere safe.
He didn't have anything against 'America's Patriot' nor did he have anything against the kid. It wasn't personal. No. Only Stark's connection to them made them usable.
Tony scoffed. "Let me get this straight... I give you a shiny new suit. And I give you a brand new, shiny, AI...and you name her after Plankton's computer wife?"
"Then take a nap, but it can't be too long, because if my arm goes numb, I'm shoving you to the ground."
Vanessa took her leave. She had an idea that this wasn't going to be a simple mentor-mentee bond. She could tell that Strange cared for Maggie. And whether Maggie consciously knew it or not, she already trusted Strange. She just wanted the best for her girl.
He opened his eyes. He was in a basement. It was dark. There were microphones all over the room. The table next to him was covered in sharp objects. He looked down and saw just how tightly he was strapped down. His hands were forced flat against the arms of the chair. Just above his wrists was held down. Just above his elbows were hooked to the chair. There was an X of metal across his torso. His legs were strapped down like his arms. Even if he could get leverage, he wasn't sure the metal would budge.
"It's okay. God knows I've ended up in this bed more than you have. I know you're being careful." Steve whispered.
"You don't have to be sorry for your feelings or trauma. We accept all trauma here. We're all messy weird freaks."
"I've tracked down invisible people before, it's not hard. This is different. I can FIND invisible dangers. This I can't find." Maggie leaned forward and cupped her head in her hands. "And the nightmare, it sort of drifted off. I couldn't grasp it fully. I just want to know how to help him...or if I even can."
Peter smiled. "Oh! This is about my INTERNSHIP. I'm so relieved. I thought you caught the cheat sheets I wrote in middle school. I made like forty bucks on them for that chem test. My aunt always said that would come back to bite me."
Happy was stuck in traffic, he'd texted Peter to say he'd be late. There'd been an accident, apparently. Peter didn't mind. He liked having extra time with Ned. They hadn't gotten to go out much in a while. They were in the middle of yet another Star Wars debate outside of the theater when Peter's spidersense went off, stronger this time. He grabbed Ned's shoulder, tight.
"Cool." Peter followed Happy out to the car. When they got in Peter sighed and relaxed against the back seat. "I think I'm going to sleep like a rock today. Pretty sure I had an adrenaline dump after that speech."
Maggie heard a slight edge to his tone, not sure what it meant. She walked around the sofa and sat down. "It's never really been a priority to me. We found out a couple months before dad died. He came home from work and take off his gun belt and start doing flash cards with me. Used to give me M&Ms every card I got right. Silly things at first, numbers and letters. Then words and big numbers." She gently pulled her legs up onto the sofa. "My powers had just started. Dad told me about his. He could always tell when someone was lying. And I was starting to sense danger. The colors were just starting to show up... The last flashcard he showed me was 3,000. I told him it was a big number. He said it was the biggest number..." She frowned. "I told him not to leave. I told him something bad would happen. He told me it was his job, that he had to go. He said he loved my 3,000. I never saw him again...alive.
An apt description, Strange had to admit. "Yes. If you can focus and keep them from just happening, as they tend to do already."
Tony frowned. "I read about this. Sometimes kids test parents, you know, breaking rules, just to see what they'll do. Especially kids in new situations. If I were in his shoes I'd be testing boundaries too. Maybe this is one of those times."
The words felt like a jab to the heart. Peter suddenly felt like a piece of shit, dead weight, just an extra pile of trouble for his dad to handle. He didn't like that feeling. He was pretty sure his mind was making it up. Either way, he needed the situation to defuse so his own brain didn't go off the rails. "Six." He said subtly. He hoped maybe that it would be enough for them to both take a step back, to breathe, to figure out why they were at each other's throats. The words stung. They'd always worked together on stuff.
Well, shit. No wonder the textures of people's skin were off. Holograms couldn't mimic textured skin no matter how much they LOOKED right.
Ned tilted his head to the side. Who was that number? It was a Brooklyn number. Was it from Peter's dance class? He frowned and sent a text.
May limped toward him, her body shifting unnaturally. Her skin paled. Slowly, her body rotted until it collapsed in front of him.
"Friend? He tried to HIT me. Don't know if you know this, but that friend of yours packs a mean punch. I learned that on YouTube. It was self-defense, and he's fine."
After a while, he became aware of pressure on the back of his neck and Wong talking to him. When was the last time he'd had a panic attack? Med school? Further back? When his sister had died? He couldn't remember. He couldn't breathe.
Then again...Peter'd been adopted by two heroes and was a dancer himself so... It was a thing, apparently.
Maggie's eyes widened. Something...weird happened. Her stomach...it felt strange, warm...tingly. She felt warmth flood her cheeks. Her neck suddenly felt itchy in the robe. She felt...squirmy. What was that feeling? What the fuck was that?  She'd never known that feeling. It wasn't normal.
"It wasn't either of you?" Maggie asked and looked down at it. There was no danger emanating off of it, so she shrugged it off. "Oh, weird." She shrugged and went to the kitchen. Her foot was warm, so she got a bowl, then went to the couch. She sat on the edge of it and pulled her feet up. Wade smiled and put his arm around the back of the sofa behind her.
"We found a lot of physical abuse. I imagine it was a lot of emotional and metal abuse..." He looked like he was the one who hit his head and was unable to speak. "Was there any other type of abuse or trauma we should look for?"
Steve didn't know what to do. Everything in his training told him to go, be a soldier, win the fight, protect his team. Everything in his heart told him that he couldn't leave Peter.
"Me and Pep will do most of the schmoozing. You just have to handle the science-y part. There won't be a lot of press, but there will be flashing lights. I asked to keep it limited for the sake of your super senses, I told them it was because Steve was going to be there and he gets headaches after a while. After that it's going to sort of be like a nerd convention. Lots of scientists from SI showing off projects. Yours is just the centerpiece tonight, alright?"
"Why not just give him access to my blueprints? I mean, I messed them up on purpose. He doesn't strike me as the tech-smart kind. He probably won't be able to figure out what's wrong with it."
Peter looked around in the common kitchen and, though he found leftovers he didn't feel like eating that. Pasta seemed too heavy. He looked in the pantry and found a box of fudge pop tarts, so he grabbed the box and took the last two packages, popping them into the toaster before going to get a drink. He downed a glass of orange juice before he refilled his cup and took his newly warmed pop tarts to the table on a plate.
"It's Peter's project, honey." Tony explained. "We haven't got a name yet for it, because "alternative to the arc reactor for the everyman who can't afford and arc reactor" is way too big of a name. But we'll figure it out."
Thor walked through the kitchen. "Hello, Natasha, Peter." He waved idly, but looked intent on getting to the pantry.
"Okay. Okay." Strange nodded. It couldn't be possible. His rational mind knew that. But...well, then again he knew by now nothing was entirely impossible either. "Let's get you out of this room. Will that help you feel better?"
Red. Red. RED. Light blossomed like fireworks behind her eyes. She was in danger. There were no strings, no ties to anything external. Was she going to have a heart attack? A stroke? What the fuck was happening? She opened her eyes.
Maggie looked down at her food and let out a sigh. He didn't sound like her step father at all or even look very much like him. He had the same hair color, but that's where the similarities stopped. She'd just been too panicked to realize it. "You struggle with history?"
He still had nightmares. Therapy didn't quite cure that. But they were getting better...or maybe just easier to manage. He was going out with Ned and MJ again, but not for long stretches of time. He preferred to stay in with his family, where he knew he was safe. Even patrolling felt safer than being with friends.
Dr. Strange's heart shattered. "Margaret..." He let his weapons fade. "He's not here. He's dead. You're safe."
Steve looked at the sweater and shook his head. Tony'd been looking for his MIT sweater and...of course, it was in one of Peter's 'nests' as Steve liked to call them. He was glad the kid was getting more comfortable in the house, but it was a little weird to find stuff crammed in weird places. Steve found his build-a-bear Captain America plushie (given to him by Tony) up on top of the fridge because Peter used it as a pillow. Really, it was harmless. The kid slept in weird places and, as JARVIS had pointed out, slept walk. Peter'd go to sleep in his room and sometimes wake up on the living room ceiling. Steve found it endearing. He'd also found some of his and Tony's things going missing a few months after adopting the kid. Steve didn't know if Peter realized he'd taken them or if he'd just took them while he slept. It was kinda cute...but strange, finding stuff all over the penthouse.
Peter was Spiderman. He could tell he was being watched instantly. He turned and looked past Ned and then he paused. Nat was walking into the school. She looked like a teacher. Her signature red hair was dark brown and thrown up messily. She was wearing a pencil skirt and a sweater over a button up. She was wearing glasses. To anyone else, she would have looked completely ordinary. A teacher with a messenger bag and coffee. Peter though, knew that walk, and the smirk she shot at him was a dead giveaway.
"JARVIS, what's going on?" Peter asked as he got changed from his suit back into his loose work-out clothes.
"It's okay. Learning new stuff is fun. Tracy's been teaching me coding. Mr. Stark's been teaching me a lot about engineering. Though, I think the best day ever was getting to work with Dr. Banner. We did some awesome bio-chem experiments. Totally up my ally."
Maggie's face pinched. It didn't feel pleasant. Things weren't supposed to go in or out of her veins.
"Since the start." Peter answered. "Hi, by the way." He sat in a waiting chair as Cho guided Maggie to the exam table.
Tony raised an eyebrow as Steve walked off the stage, then hissed when Cho pressed on his side. "Still sore there."
"Yeah 'wow.' The environmental impact alone would be nothing to shake a stick at. And the economic one... This could give lights to people who've never had them. Warmth to low-income housing and schools. Not to mention shelters across the world that need the lights on. Peter and I've discussed it. Once Obie...isn't in the way. We're giving away the first set off the production line. He's making sure every shelter in this city is sustainable for the year."
Genius. Billionaire. Inventor. Fiancé. Father. Mentor. Friend. Mechanic. Tony knew he was a lot of things without the suit. Tony spread his hands. "JARVIS?"
Holding meetings on the 80th floor was probably the smartest decision Tony had made that day. Far enough that his home and the labs weren't damaged, but high enough that his suit wrapped around him like a second skin long before he could hit the ground.
"Don't apologize. You're not bothering me." Peter promised. They were friends, dance partners, and a superhero team, they were supposed to help each other out like this. "I do got to run to class though."
"I have the wizard's phone." The woman on the other side of the screen said. "We've reprogramed it. It's only going to receive what we want it to now. Even if they call for his help, he won't get those messages."
She took a deep, shaky breath...then lunged. The brick hit his temple. The man stumbled and staggered for a moment. But quickly regained himself and tackled her. Maggie screamed when the brick was knocked from her hand.
Peter didn't like that answer. The babysitting was getting really old. So quickly. "Does Captain Rogers know you're down here?" Peter asked, putting his backpack down and heading to his station, just a few feet from Tony.
So, Maggie didn't just have a 'danger sense' like Peter did. She could manipulate time and fly as well. Cool. "It was nothing."
"Okay." She watched his face. She did not want to see her leg. He looked like a doctor, calm, collected. Focused. Every part of him was focused solely on this one task, dedicated to helping. There wasn't an ounce of worry or panic anywhere. It helped ease her mind a little.
"He's a KID, a blameless child. And you took Maggie Wilson too, she has nothing to do with anything you have against me. You don't need to hurt those kids."
That didn't sound good. Peter was suck to the ceiling, upside-down, shaking, terrified. He'd become too used to it, too used to Tony and Steve letting him eat whatever he wanted. He should have thought twice. He shouldn't have taken food without asking. He couldn't breathe, he felt tears in his eyes. Not everyone was like Steve and Tony, were they? No. Peter knew the hard way that some people were the opposite of Steve and Tony.
Vanessa rubbed her shoulders gently. "Okay. Well, Dr. Strange will definitely look after you. We can be there any time and you can come back any time."
"She texted me and asked me last night if I'd dance with you. Something about you being too shy or polite to ask yourself."
The next day, Wade showed up. He was dressed in casual clothes, sans weapons. "He should have wore more red..." Wade walked across the room and held out a hand to Maggie. Slowly she took it, then smiled at him. "You're safe to go home now, sweetie." He said, his voice soft. Then he turned and looked at Peter. "You too, cutie." He winked.
As if on cue, Strange was hovering over her. "Hey, Margaret. I'm right here. We're going to need you to rest for a while. Can you do that?"
"Six." Nat responded. "The guy in the video isn't accounted for. No one fits the build...then again all the disguises they've got... I don't know. I can't imagine this is all of them."
Peter raised an eyebrow at him. A whole bottle of Advil would do nothing except make his stomach turn.
"Okay." Peter nodded. He wanted to collapse into his dad and papa's arms. It was over. Stane was done. They'd won.
The instant everything was finalized, Peter felt himself embraced by both of his parents. He hugged them back. "Glad you guys caught up with me."
Maggie filled her backpack and a sports tote bag. She didn't have a lot of space, but she narrowed it down, deciding between a blanket and a pillow, settling on the quilt. She also tucked a stuffed cheetah plush as low down into the bag as she could manage. Shortly after she'd gone to Professor Xavier's school, she'd had a hard time sleeping. She didn't know who put the cheetah on her bed, but she always slept a little better when Hunter was around. She just felt a little...embarrassed, given her age, that she still had it.
The man left and she leaned her head back against the wall. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. Maybe she could meditate, look into the future without tipping them off to what she was doing.
Steve laughed. "If you can't do this, there is a more pleasurable workout that certainly takes more energy. You'll probably be too tired tonight."
They were in the alleyway in minutes. Peter's backpack was on the ground. Tony leapt from the suit and ran forward with Steve. They both picked up the bag. There was a tag tied to it.
"And dance?" Tony asked. "And when you're out with your friends or in the labs downstairs? No. Lockdown. He's not going to have ANY access to you."
Peter felt like his synapses were on fire. The watch that normally tick, tick, ticked on Maggie's wrist was between ticks...and it didn't seem like it was going to tick any time soon. Maggie was frozen, unmoving in her place. But her eyes were darting around. Frozen in time, but still conscious of everything.
JARVIS worked to find more, but all he had were three images, a sound clip, and a very brief proximity alert. One even Tony couldn't have reacted to fast enough. The three tiny shreds of evidence added up to one very upsetting fact. There was a sort of suit out there, one larger than Tony's. It didn't seem to have the same power levels judging by the sound of the thrusters but...it was strong, strong enough to put up a fight against Tony's.
The poor child. His heart ached for her. He wanted to hide her, take her somewhere where no one could ever hurt her again. He never wanted to see that terror on her face again. "Yes." Strange nodded. "It's them."
The not-Tony made a face, but didn't comment. "Good to work on this a little bit? Heard they've been trying to sway you to stay down here with coding."
Steve had to agree, but he knew it wouldn't always be that way. Peter was a stubborn kid with a very strong sense of justice, lots of selflessness, a strong moral compass, and an uncanny ability to find trouble. Steve had no doubt that the kid would stick his nose into places it shouldn't be. But for now, the kid was probably a bit nervous so they'd at least have a little while before he started trying to do anything too adventurous. "He's a good kid."
"It's against our school's policies. Children shouldn't have prescription medications on their person."
The man shifted and put the sharp object in his hand down. "Well, if you want something done right..."
"Good. Glad you got that simple task done." When he'd picked Maggie to keep Peter in line, he hadn't expected her to come with so much trouble. But, by the time he considered using some other form of bait...they'd already worked up all the images they needed to keep her in line. Coding new nightmares for some other bait would just take way too much time. Really, all he had to do was distract the wizard and make sure he wasn't easily contacted. At least for a while. "Keep him distracted won't you?"
What's with the 80s movie references for Maggie-centric chapters? I don't know. This one is a looong chapter. Looks mostly like fluff, but there are important plot things hidden in here. Promise. Oh, and all the references. Benedict Cumberbatch once played Hamlet so, there's that. Plus, Doctor Who stuff and Hannibal things. If you haven't seen some behind-the-scenes pics of Hannibal, the tennis shoes thing won't make sense, but in Hannibal Mads' character always wears fancy suits, but most times he's wearing tennis shoes with them outside of the frame. It's funny.
Maggie's number is made up. Took a Brooklyn area code from the area I imagine she lives. Then spelled out Maggie with the corresponding keypad-numbers. The 7 is a bonus little nod to my future plans. Annnyways, he's a chapter. Along with more foreshadowing hidden in fluff.
"I don't know. Not like I can call and ask..." She bit her lip and fidgeted with the necklace around her neck. She didn't know why...but she'd been doing that a lot since he'd gone away. It was a weird vibe, a feeling she had that seemed to draw her hand upward to it. "I don't want to bother him when he's fighting." She wished she could hear from him though.
"No worries." Kate whispered. She kept her supported. "How did your dad get here so quick?" She asked idly.
"Normally, I'd say that was a good thing. That they didn't know he was Spiderman, but that's not the case." Tony looked at the suit. Peter's captors knew he was Spiderman. That meant they'd come prepared.
He needed to see where those kids were. If he could see it, he could go get them out. "Do you have any more pictures of these rooms that they're in?" Strange asked, trying to keep himself level-headed an calm. If he lost his head, he'd be useless to Maggie and Peter.
"Oh! I won't be in trouble, don't worry. He says as long as I'm making progress and getting better. I don't have a set deadline, not really. It's been fun working with coding. It's so different. I'm not great at it, but it's fun." Peter grinned and wow, it was nice to not have his spider sense going off like crazy. "I like learning new things."
She stepped out of her room and snatched her toothbrush and retainers from the bathroom, then stepped into the living room.
Maggie sighed and wished she could flop face-first onto her bed. "I'm going to Dr. Strange's this weekend."
"Unless Mads is an inter-dimensional being with the ability to replicate himself, I'm pretty sure you're safe."
Strange nodded. Nearly infinite futures to look through, it was distracting. He'd been there before. He wasn't one for liking looking through the future. But he'd done it to learn how to do it. He was curious that way. He found that it was stressful to look through time. It came with a responsibility that wasn't fun. But Margaret didn't have to seek this out. Her mind would send her glimpses into the future. She needed to learn to control it before it controlled her. "You don't have to see all of it. But if you don't start filtering it, it'll start finding you."
Tony sighed. "I don't like it either. I honestly want Peter to punch the kid too, but we can't do that." Tony frowned. "I think Peter shouldn't let that kid push him around, but...I don't see Peter changing that. And I don't see the school changing it when they haven't this long. We can't fight that without letting people know who Peter is."
Maggie shook her head and looked up. This person was obviously tall, towering over her. "He's wearing a fish bowl."
Maggie nodded and settled in, shifting until she was comfortable. Then she opened the book. He started to prepare food, so she started to read, aloud. True to form, he recited all of Hamlet's lines. It was a bit easier, when it was out loud. And whenever her mind acted up and she skipped a line or struggled with a word, Dr. Strange pulled her back and had her start again. It helped that he had it memorized, still she had no clue how he could memorize something that long or complex, but she was glad of it.
"Hey." Vanessa said, her voice soft. "It's okay. He's safe here." She promised. "Christine helped Strange with Maggie's surgery. Christine's safe, she's good people."
"If you take a kid and you're going to torture him...you need a place where he won't be heard or seen. He wouldn't have time to go very far. The recording...and..." Steve nodded to where Peter's pinky was. "Was given by hand. They're close. So where CAN'T we see that would be isolated enough for their purposes?"
"Forgiveness rather than permission, right?" Christine laughed. "You took a whole room. Does it exist or is it just this...wormhole or something?"
Strange nodded. "Her limits are...self-imposed through an utter lack of confidence and too much trust in what people told her are her limits. Once she gets her mind clear... I don't doubt she could slow typhoons. Halt bullets with a look. She can shift the effects of time on people and objects. She can make a second for her be four, but imagine if she could move around for whole minutes between ticks of the second hand. Or hold a person or thing trapped within a second while the rest of the world moves. It's..."
Tony nodded. This felt painfully familiar. Him searching frantically for Peter in his own way as Steve searched the streets. But this time...Peter wasn't trying to hide. He wasn't hidden in a church. Someone had taken him this time.
Peter paled. "Just making sure she got home safe, sir. Sh-she um, was tired today. After the fight."
"She's not a fan of strangers, Zio Clint." Peter warned. Then he smiled when Steve made himself a little smaller, turning away from Maggie so she wouldn't have to see him. "Thanks, Papa." He whispered to him.
"You look nervous or like someone stole your tie. If you unbutton one more, it'll look like you meant it, instead of you know, freaking out and yanking the tie off as fast as possible after panicking."
"Sort of?" Maggie shrugged. "I'm going to get changed real quick, it shouldn't burn in that time." She promised, rushing to her room. She grabbed a new set of clothes and then paused.
"OOOH, you make me blush, Stevie. I guess you can be ruthless, totally judged you wrong. Lemme help with that."
It’s a good spread, mostly in his signature shades of red and gold. Plugs and vibrators line the top shelf, ranging in sizes from
Tony glances up to meet his eye. He’s got pretty blue eyes, a deep, glasslike blue that seems a little out of place on him, a little too delicate.
And then he moves on. He checks system after system — prison records, government employees, arrest records from other countries, immigration records, anything else he can find — and sees no matches. He tells himself not to be disappointed.
Their flirtation is so by the numbers he could do it in his sleep, but he likes her figure, likes her face, likes the D cups the faint hint of muscle in her arms, just enough to add an athletic sort of firmness to her figure. He thinks they could have a good time together.
Part of his wants to laugh at that, laugh at the idea of himself — well known for being anything but responsible— as Steve’s liferaft, as the element which has been putting the guy at ease. Another part of him feels a strange, possessive satisfaction.
Just like Tony, he tries to fill himself with things, to shove objects in the glaring holes decades in the ice had torn in his life.
“You know,” Tony says, his voice all Tony, free of the Stark brand, free of the inflection he’s used to hearing coming out from under the helmet, “you don’t
Steve is startled back to the real world by the sound of buzzing emanating from his Avengers Identicard, newly minted. He picks it up, squinting at its little fragile holo-screen, and realizes that it’s a summons.
Steve doesn’t know why the thought hits him, why it could possibly matter right now, but he wonders if it could be a woman in the armor, if that possibility wouldn’t be more palatable to him. The eyes are attractive, framed by thick black lashes. He could see himself—
“Oh.” Steve says. He puts his hand on Tony’s solar plexus, fingers splayed, like he knows the root of the issue lies in Tony’s strange, broken insides. “Yeah. I’ll be rough with you.”
and sees only the nearly typed up government file he’d found on the man. He’s got an overactive imagination.
His eyes downcast, Tony stumbled heavily on his way out, and Steve stepped forward to catch him, his hand on his lower back, where it met—
Natasha groans and drinks, as does Tony. Jan rolls her eyes, making a big point of drinking her drink with annoyance. Tony guesses the incident had been recent.
“It’s not about the mission.” Tony says. Steve doesn’t argue with him. He’s not stupid, and he’s not planning on acting like it, on forcing them into the hamster wheel of a conversation that won’t move.
He’s had it cut recently. Down by his neck, the hairs are so short they stick straight out and poke against Tony’s fingers. Tony likes Steve with a buzz.
He makes his decision then; he’s going to write a note to Steve, tell him everything, and then he’s going to go out fighting. None of this slow death stuff, none of the heart issues, nothing like that; he’ll try to take them on, and he knows he won’t survive the fight, but it’ll look like he tried.
In the light, he recognizes them immediately, the gleaming gold, the little touches of red. They’re ornamental, beautiful, even. This hadn’t been his first time wearing them.
Rogers is out of his territory and it’s awfully clear. He’s not stupid; he smiles where he should smile, nods where he should nod, shakes hands and gives answers that’ll generate mostly positive press, but Tony sees the lines of tension in his back, the way his eyes keep returning to every exit of the room. He’d been in the war only weeks ago, as far as his memory can tell him.
His guess is confirmed once they start talking. Their leader shows him sketches on the clipboard, blueprints, and then yanks a heavy, dusty cloth off a set of wooden boxes, all inscribed with a familiar logo.
She rises on her tip toes, looking over the lab equipment as though she might spot Stark around them now. “That’s strange. I’d have thought he’d be the first to want to meet you.”
He rolled up his sleeves. Two near-identical bruises, red imprints of fingers, were forming on his wrists.
They have the best sex of their relationship that night, with her on top of him, his wrists bound to the headboard. She forces him to stay in the moment, her nails digging hard into his skin. It’s not callousness, he tells himself; this is calculated. She cares, and this is how she shows it, her way of taking care of him.
Steve looks up at him, and they make eye contact. Tony can’t read his expression, because Steve is barring him up, constructing barriers.
Iron Man has been swarmed by the oncoming army, pinned to the ground by several humanoid creatures. Steve thinks he hears the faint sound of a man’s groan, of Iron Man’s metal fingers scratching impotently at the rocks. In his suit, the heat must be unbearable.
Tony is hunched forward on the bed, his ass up, his face pressed into folded elbows, his body thrumming, every nerve alive. Between blows, Steve runs his hand down his spinal cord, feeling the jut of each bone, and grips the back of his neck. The fine hairs there catch on the rough callouses of Steve’s palm, scratchy against Tony’s recently lotioned skin, and Tony entertains the fantasy of Steve pushing him over, shoving him down, hitting with all his strength, landing the kind of blows Tony has only felt once or twice before, the kind that would break him, Steve making him take it—
Steve seems better at ease here. His shoulders are a degree lower, the muscles of his back — the way he’s holding his arms— neither entirely relaxed nor battle-ready. His eyes stop briefly on the exits and then move forward, unfettered, back around the room. He smiles at people, the natural kind of smile that means he’s at least socially okay with meeting them. When they separate, briefly, he doesn’t spend all of his time awkwardly milling by the refreshments.
“Captain America reads everything,” Steve tells her with a shrug, “Captain America used to have a lot of free time.”
"I'm a genius, kiddo, and I know you. Plus, you and I don't often meet in public. If some kid shows up in my lab and isn't acting like my son, I'll notice." Tony nodded. "They don't know you like I do. I'm famous, anyone can play the snarky asshole, but you? They don't know you. They can't mimic you. You're one of a kind." Tony smiled gently. "Alright, that's a lot of feelings for one day. Food?"
"It's not pleasant, kid. But at least you don't look like topographical map of Utah." Wade commented lightly.
"Please tell me we've got good news from Hong Kong." Beck said, glaring. "I've got everything else ready, so you'd better not be slowing our progress."
Maggie laughed loudly. "That's great. Awful. But great." She looked down at Animal Farm. "I got to go back to the plain old awful though, don't I?"
"That's what you're worried about? In your defense though, everyone thinks you're Natalie Portman now."
"Let's get you upstairs, kid." Happy smiled, ruffling his hair once more. "So, who's your girlfriend and why haven't you told me about her?"
“We have to talk about this Tony,” Steve said and Tony opened his eyes as Steve took a step forward. “You can’t keep hiding from us. Unless you want us out of your life for good?”
“I’m serious Tony. We need to get you over this silly crush so the best thing to do is find you someone else.”
“Yeah well, I like you both so I’ll spoil you a little.” He shifted still feeling the weight of both of their eyes.
Steve just looked at him sadly, yup there it is they think he is pathetic. Bucky cleared his throat. “You said that guy was demanding he didn't…… he didn’t try and make you do anything did he?” He had his fists clenched on the top of the table.
Steve and Bucky stood in the middle of the shop. Steve looked nervous and a bit unsure of where to look. Bucky, however, looked angry, a terrifying thought to Tony. His hands clenched and unclenched at his sides. Tony shifted nervously unsure if he should run away or tell them off.
Tony shouldn’t have felt as heartbroken as he did, he and Steve had just shared some friendly flirting but it did hurt. Steve had stopped him as he tried to hurry past.
Turns out Pepper happened to know quite a few successful single people. The first was a disaster. He had known of Tony from his tech days. Apparently, Tony taking time and opening his shop was cute but not what he should be doing with a mind like his. Then he had the audacity to think Tony was going to invite him back to his place. He stormed into the shop the next day not even noticing Steve and Bucky for the first time.
“Pots that was probably the worst date I have ever had.” He called out to her, she looked surprised. “He was so arrogant and demanding and bah! No!” He puffed and threw himself into an empty chair. “I’m sorry Tony, he uh well he mentioned how much he wanted to meet you and he said such good things about you.” She frowned.
He ran a hand over his face and looked away, that was when he noticed Steve and Bucky staring at him. “Oh,” he startled. “Good morning guys, sorry you had to hear all that.”
He walked soaking wet into a mostly empty shop, people it seemed didn’t want to go out into the storm. Steve was sitting at his usual table looking blue, he looked up when Tony walked in. He stood immediately and rushed to his side.
The next date met him at the shop. He was a young scientist. Very handsome. Tony was actually excited when he showed up until Steve and Bucky did as well and then he just felt self-conscious. But the man was sweet at first, polite to the men who introduced themselves as Tony’s friends. Tony and his date left and things went downhill fast, he was pretty and nice but so so so boring. He was falling asleep by the salad.
“Okay. I’ll talk to you all later.” He gave a small wave and made his way to the back to tell Pepper all about his date.
He came into the shop with a frown. Sat at the counter and just stared at the door. The second Steve and Bucky walked in he started their usual drinks and had them on the counter waiting. Steve smiled and reached for his wallet. Tony waved them off.
Tony stood with his mouth opening and closing not knowing what to say for the first time in his life. “Y-your not?” He finally stuttered out.
He started seeing the doctor pretty regularly, mostly at the shop when he could get away from the hospital. He noticed the hot couple didn’t tend to stay at the shop long when the doctor was there, but if he wasn’t they spent a lot of time talking to him. He felt they were becoming better friends now. He found out Steve had a drier sense of humor as well, Bucky had a bit of a dirty streak and brought that out of Steve as well. They complimented each other, balanced each other. They also looked out for Tony, made sure he was sleeping and eating. They were both incredible. But the only problem they did not like the man he was seeing and neither of them could articulate why.
“Oh well, that's only fair if we can spoil you too.” He licked a stray bit of coffee from his lip. He heard Steve whisper a “careful Buck” under his breath.
Tony didn’t stay much longer after that. Using the excuse that he was tired and had work to do he left Steve and Bucky talking tensely among themselves. It was odd for them to be so upset, they were usually a happy couple.
Steve took a step forward tentative not wanting to spook Tony anymore than he was. “Yes, Tony we both want you. You are amazing. You are smart, funny, generous, and very attractive.” He blushed a little then. “I know a polyamorous relationship is not going to be easy but if you are open to the idea of being with us, both of us then we would like to try.” Tony was quiet as he took a few minutes to think. “I’m going to give you my answer but I have a condition before I do. I have to kiss Bucky first because if he is bad at this than I’m ou….” He didn’t get to finish his sentence as Bucky strode over to him and planted a kiss on him. It wasn’t as soft and sweet as Steve’s it was something darker, hungrier. When they finally parted Tony couldn’t even open his eyes.
He’s happy for it, really. He hopes that his old man doesn’t have a soulmate, which sounds vindictive but only half-way is. He doubts much of anyone deserves Joseph Rogers, and that Joseph Rogers deserves much of anyone.
“Never have I ever cheated on a boyfriend,” Natasha announces loudly, drowning both of them out. She’s the best liar of them all; Tony, who’s been sleeping with her for almost a year, can’t tell if she’s being honest or not. It rankles.
There are a few nights after when Steve tries again to get a message out. He starts out writing, but everything he can come up with  —
And so an order is established. Steve stalks Tony Stark around the mansion sometimes, on the rare occasion he can catch any glimpse of him, watches do mundane things — morning stretches, called something fancy like
Tony sees the spy’s jaw relax marginally as he heads towards Rogers, like he’s figured something out, and he already knows he’ll hate whatever conclusion the man has come to.
“All of my problems are dead and gone, I’m afraid,” Tony says, shrugging, and, when Steve still doesn’t budge, he prods. “Go on, then. Let me live vicariously through your relationship with someone unlikely to try to kill you.”
“Where were you at?” Tony asks, skimming a passage at random. He remembers nothing of the book except for a description of ants using the friction of their bodies to make water.
Thor is gone more often, wandering wherever he goes when he’s off-world. He seems a little happier, a little more satisfied, like he’s earned his place in his homeworld pantheon.
After the debrief, though, Tony catches Cap on the couch in the common room, peering into his phone with a look a look on his face that means he’s giving his full attention to something. It’s a cute look, almost over the top. His eyebrows knit together. His mouth tugs down slightly at the edges, a little frown of concentration. His whole body seems angled towards the phone.
Green light whirled around both of Maggie's wrists. Green symbols of light. On one wrist they slowly turned. On the other, the symbols whirled quickly.
"And how I got lost after I got that bloody nose? And how there was a spider missing from a display?"
"Including epipens? Because the lady in the office made it quite clear that life-saving medicine is locked up in some back room. What happens if a teacher refuses to let a student leave their class, like what happened to my Margaret? Or if they're on the other side of the school and can't make it down? Or if someone loses the key to the prescription drawer?"
Peter looked down at his next upgrade and took a breath. He was going to have to fake this. Too bad lying had never been one of his strong suits. He'd just have to tell the truth, it wasn't like he had a full prototype done anyway. "Uh, pretty good. The projections I've got look good. Wanna see?"
Seeing those bruises made Peter frown. Peter's eyes lingered on them. Tony really looked like shit, the only consolation was that heartbeat the echoed metallically in his chest. It was steady and strong, though he didn't even look able to open his pill bottle.
"A thank you...for everything. I don't think I could have done that without you." He remembered, more than once, during surgery his hands had started shaking. Without Christine to calm him down...he wouldn't have calmed his nerves to operate. He'd never had that problem before. Then again, he'd never done surgery on a loved one. Stitches were simple, easy, non-threatening. Extracting bone from brain was...different. There was a reason why doctors weren't supposed to treat loved ones unless there was no other way. Stress like that could lead to mistakes. It had been an...experience. He was glad she'd brought some normalcy to it.
For hours, Tony and Steve tried everything they could think of. Looked everywhere for Peter. They tried to look at the videos around the church. Called pastor Aaron. Spoke to the people along the street. Everything.
"You're on." Peter said. It would be a good test. Plus, Ned would be stoked to be able to finally talk to Peter about coding. Maybe if he got good enough he and Ned could build better systems again, like they used to before Peter'd had to drop robotics.
"I didn't think that would be me. Or if it was I figured it'd be, you know, from a used lot with a bunch a dings in it." Peter shorted.
"Dad's there." Peter's eyes narrowed. His Papa was at a meeting with some vets. But his dad was still there.
"I cannot tell what floor he is on. He entered the building ten minutes ago and got on the elevator, I do not know what floor he got off on." JARVIS answered. "There is some sort of error in my sensors. I cannot find him."
"It was, but I think it's okay. Mr. Stark is just a bit stressed is all. He doesn't normally get like that. We talked about it, it's cool." Peter shrugged and turned to his work.
Strange came back and sat next to her. "Alright, got you all the prescriptions you need. They'll have labels with instructions on them. Follow the labels religiously. It's important. You can't just have extra pain meds. And you have to have your antibiotics. You have open wounds. I cleaned them well, but germs are resilient, so take the meds."
All warnings remain. Kidnapping, physical/mental/emotional trauma/torture. Violence. Threats of violence. Implied threats of sexual assault.
"I left her...I didn't think she was real. I thought it was a lie. It...sounded recorded. I thought...I thought they were lying." Peter's eyes lingered on her neck. Had they strangled her because he left? What happened to her head? What had really happened?
Maggie looked around, taking in any signs of danger and making mental note to avoid the dangerous objects. She didn't have to be told what was and wasn't safe to touch. The machine rolled away from her and she saw red danger lights. The bot knocked a bottle off a table. "No!" She held out her hand and the bottle slowed to a near stop, green light swirling around it. She walked forward and put her hands under it before letting time resume. It was heavy when it hit her hands. Then she gently put it back on the table as the bot made a sad sound.
"Yeah." Maggie nodded. Sometimes being able to give herself time really did help. "It's cool in here." She walked up to a set holograms. There were equations on it. It took her a few moments to read the equation. Something about heat, pressure, friction, and power. Trying to balance all three. Maybe for joints, trying to keep them cool, moving smoothly and using the least amount of power possible. "Is this..." She took in the measurements. "For the prosthetic line that just came out?"
"Possibly. I'll be back." He opened a portal and stepped through it. "Margaret?” He called into the house. "Margaret, are you home?"
Nat walked into the room, rubbing her hair dry with a towel. "Hey, Pete. How was dance? Dance was today, right?" She asked, getting into the fridge and pulling out a cup of pudding.
"She's been off lately. I think she'll be fine though. She'll be better when her...mentor comes back. I think she's worried about him." Peter shrugged. "She'll come around. I get it. It's...nerve-wracking. I mean, if I couldn't get ahold of you or Papa during a fight, I'd be pretty nervous too."
Pain flashed in the inside of her skull. She couldn't move for a moment, everything hurt. Maggie cried against the floor and spat up blood. The lights, every noise. It all hurt. She felt her powers working, but she couldn't tell what they were doing, she was too disoriented. Something told her, whatever her powers were doing, it was important.
She dabbed her face against her knees, then closed her eyes. She slowed and sped up the ant that crawled on the ground, hoping that the small amount of green light would go unnoticed. She'd do it as long as she could manage. Until she was exhausted. She needed to get Dr. Strange's attention, somehow. If he noticed her using her powers at all hours of the day and night...that might help.
Peter took a slip and headed for the practice room. Maggie was already there, quietly writing in a corner on a slip of paper. Peter sat in his own corner and looked at the blank piece of paper.
"He's getting better. And with his webs he's consistently keeping pace with me. Even Nat says he's getting really good. Once his brains and brawn meet...that kid will knock me out."
This dance was perfect ballet and in perfect synchronization. There was genuine joy on their faces as they twirled together, taking turns lifting and supporting each other, before the music began to die down.
Dr. Strange huffed out a breath. "Right. I'm going to go get some meds. She should have some pain relief and rest."
Vanessa took a shaky breath. "I...um... We didn't see so much of her, it was mostly Peter. They did hit her a lot. They hit her head against the wall more than once. I don't remember anything sharp being used... Um. I don't know a lot of this is new. She didn't look this bad in the last pictures we got."
"No, not really." She nodded. "I can slow him down for a time, but I can't do enough damage to him even with him slowed down. Not with this thing." She gestured to her staff. "How do you feel about being offense?"
"It's okay, Ned." Peter smiled at his friend. He turned back to the front and listened to the lecture.
Steve's shield bounced back to him. "You're catching on. You could have taken her out, but you didn't. Good. That's forethought. You're getting better at using your brain, not just your brawn." Steve approved. Then Steve threw his shield, hard at Peter's head.
Peter pulled them closer. Their family was officially whole. And, despite everyone's best efforts, nothing had managed to tear it apart.
He stands around for half an hour, idly watching Steve’s figure as he talks to one group of men after another, meets his team, disappears into the plane.
And then, before either of the other men can think to break the awkward, near embarrassing silence with anything like pity, Tony changes the subject and delights in presenting Cap with present he’d picked out.
Tony makes some kind of humming noise, which grows more insistent when Steve looks over at him, taking the rough shape of a word. “Mmu?”
“I’m drinking coke,” Steve says, puffing his chest out. He’s always a little louder, a little more assertive, when the girls are around.
Tony reaches over, setting a light hand over Steve’s. It’s warm and calloused and real, in a way that the spell had never been. Something about it gives Steve the courage to continue talking. It all must come out, he knows. It will one way or another.
“Christ, darling, take that off,” Tony says, reaching for the buttons of Steve’s shirt. These are deeper; Tony sees a sliver of rib bone where the cuts intersect.
When he comes to, he’s tied to a chair. No points for kidnapping creativity around these parts. His ankles have been hooked to the chair legs and tied with rope. His wrists are ziptied. Bad bondage etiquette. The noise outside tells him he’s in New York, the kind of New York with “City” after it in parentheses. His fingers are cold. His feet are cold.
“Hangover of epic proportions,” Tony says, smoothly enough, “but they do give me the good stuff for the cancer, so.”
Cap, as always, sits alone at the table adjacent to the booth where the Pyms sit, his book in front of him. It’s still fucking Vonnegut.
“Oh, no, I can set this up, let it run, and get this guy home tomorrow.” Tony said, giving her a smile, tired but fond, and glanced back over at 2018-Steve, “Unless there’s a 2018 Tony Stark that can beat me to it.”
In the familiar warm haze of pain, he loses track of how many time Steve hits him. Four blows in, he gives up trying to keep track of anything else and just breathes through it, a breath between each blow.
Steve reaches over, seemingly unable to help himself, and picks up a red dildo of enormous proportions. It flops in his hands, almost bouncy.
“Takes it out of you,” Tony complains, putting the bandages back into the first aid kit and his feet up on the couch, “think there’s still swamp water in the boots of the armor.”
The man holds out the note, and Tony unfolds it. It is short, one line of Steve’s perfect, condensed handwriting.
The idea of Captain America on his knees with Tony’s dick in his mouth is hot enough by itself that, by the end of the night, Tony’s boner pulls a miraculous return to form even despite the latest round of chemo. His one night stand doesn’t stick around, for which he’s privately grateful, and once he’s called her a cab he pulls himself out of bed and scavenges around for onboarding folder SHIELD had given him.
The room is small and dusty. This was once a studio apartment, but there’s no furniture. The chair is flimsy. Tony feels like he could break this chair if he tried hard enough.
“Yep,” Tony says, popping the p, “should’ve cleared it out while you still thought it was a closet.”
“Do you want to put clothes on, or.” Steve’s statement is flat, uncertain, anything but sexual. Tony’s realized only now that he’s undressed.
Steve makes a show of rolling his eyes, but when it comes down to it, he’s good with orders. He finds something better to do with that mouth quickly enough, trailing messy kisses down Tony’s neck. Tony tangles a hand in the soft hair on the back of his head, stopping him before he gets all the way down.
For a moment, something like jealousy curdles in the pit of Tony’s stomach, but he shrugs it off and lies easily. “No, no, I’m afraid she’s otherwise engaged. Another night, I’m sure.”
What they have is good. What they have is better than the sappy, quiet sort of support their teammates go for. What they have is their style, rough and fast and sexual, and—
Instead, he sticks the empty Fanta bottle in his pocket and walks along the little dirt path by the gravestones, absently noting names and dates. By the resting place of Beverly Adams, 1949-2010, beloved mother, he’s surprised to feel his vision blur and swim.
The young engineer had been smart in a way that Tony had immediately recognized and related to, the showy kind of bright with an insecurity hidden below it. They’d talked at a staff lunch. Promising young man, Tony had written down.
The man he’s speaking to, the leader, blocks his sightline, and Tony squeezes his eyes shut hard in frustration. If asked, he can feign a headache.
He lets Steve arrange him, push him, lets the tidal waves of pleasure and dull throbs of leftover pain carry him to climax, shakes with the aftershocks from a distant, warm place. He wants to cuddle up, now, wants to hear Steve’s voice low and loving in his ear, like before, wants to sleep.
“I have— I have a heart thing,” Tony said, after a long moment, “I wear assistive tech. But it won’t—“ he gestured up at his chest, sighed, “it’s not sustainable, Cap. It’s not going to last fourteen years.”
Steve glances down at the barely-there spots under his arms like he can tell something is off, but leaves without question. Tony can hear the water switch on and knows he’s bought himself five minutes at most.
He doesn’t sleep the rest of the night, pacing around his own room, for a change. A million thoughts occur to him. Perhaps, after all the years he’s been in the ice, his soulmate has decided she wants nothing to do with a man who never bothered writing back. Perhaps it’s common these days for people to reject their soulmates. Perhaps—
Steve sat down by the counter, and the Wasp perched next to him, playing with one of Tony’s paperweights. They watched, both uncomprehending, as he turned dials and knobs, frowning slightly at the device.
It takes him no time at all to pick Amora herself out of the crowd. She stands several inches taller than the tallest of the men, waves of golden hair cascading down her back, a long green dress sparkling the light. People around her are attracted to her orbit, her drink, her food, clumping around her like driftwood catching on rocks. Steve wonders if they’ve noticed the deviation from the norm, or if something about her forces them to accept the roast pig and mead as regular party fare.
It’s a vulnerability that Tony has barely ever seen from him, and he knows not to make a big deal out of it, not to stop and comment.
And stares. And stares. And stares. His mind, usually so helpful in times like this, is completely blank.
About to say something, he locked eyes with his future self, and the other man stood. “You’ll have to show me at the workshop,” he told Tony.
Steve glances down at the cardboard box in his hands as though he could have somehow managed to forget it. “I didn’t take my boots off, did I?”
“I just think the color scheme is awful,” he says, “I saw that suit, and I — red, white, and blue? That’s awful. I decided not to talk to you after that. Clearly, your choices were— I. Why are you awake?”
“07’s not working.” Iron Man — whoever he is — says, drawing Steve’s attention back to reality. “There must be more.”
Steve pins him, pushes him hard into the bed, leaving a deep imprint of their tangled bodies in the memory foam underneath them. Steve bites at his neck, his earlobe. The familiar hands on his hips squeeze, near bruising, and Tony feels something uncoil deep inside his chest, some tangled knot coming undone, and slides into a welcome calm.
Tony’s phone rings around three in the morning, waking both of them. Steve’s the one who sprints to get it from the living room. Tony yawns twice and pulls himself up to sit against the headboard, still feeling dazed as he answers.
It doesn’t last long. She doesn’t sob, or even really ruin her makeup — if anything, she looks prettier with her cheeks a little flushed, her lips redder and poutier.
Sixty possible matches in, his eyes aching from looking at black lines, he abandons the manual examination to switch focus.
He’s faked many things until he has made them, and so he steps forward, smoothly, and pulls on the towel until it slips from Steve’s shoulders.
“I think,” Tony gestures with the book as he speaks, “that you’ll hate it enough you won’t want to lie to me about it.”
He takes a moment to look over the expanse of the lab. His eyes catch on the delicate machinery laid out on the counters, long metal tubes and tiny motors. The tips of his fingers tingle; he can feel exactly what it would be like to hold these little devices, to handle them, to slot them together. He remembers his dreams, and attributes the false memory to them.
But it had only been another day to Steve, another job. Rationally, he knows Steve is probably unbothered, willing to blow off steam.
Tony is about as discrete about it as he needs to be. He stores the various implements he’s collected over the years in a closet within a closet, a little branch off door in his walk-in.
He sits down on the outside tables by the docks, where he always sits, and eats his usual; sesame seed bagel with cream cheese and ham. He sips his soda and remembers his own feelings of betrayal, the ice cold settling in the pit of his stomach when he’d realized Tony was lying to him, sneaking around behind his back. Even after everything, he’d expected Tony to be honest, had expected to be on the same page. He’d never gotten used to the fact that he no longer had Tony. Not as a team member. Not as friend, really. Certainly not as a lover.
“We should go,” Future-Steve said abruptly, interrupting them. “Whatever you’ve set it up to do, it’s working. I can feel it pulling me.”
“Tony Stark,” the man says victoriously, “Iron Man. My men found this in one of his Area 51 storage units.”
Tony picks his shirt up and pulls it over his head, inside-out. “Let me call for help. I won’t tell them anything, just let me get him—”
Peter didn't look toward his dad. He wouldn't lose focus. He couldn't attack Steve's legs. He'd expect that, because it worked. Peter KNEW he could take down Steve if he went for the legs, that meant Steve would be guarding them.
"Well, something that will take stabs a bit better. We've got this cool idea for a new fabric... Anyways, we want your input on it so it's exactly how you want it."
Dr. Strange let out a breath and leaned forward. So he wasn't screwing up. She seemed more reserved than usual. Timid. He was worried he'd made her feel threatened somehow, causing her to retreat. She didn't seem threatened at all. He knew she was a tough kid, she'd let him know if he'd fucked up. But, still, she was quieter than usual. Trying to get used to a new space? He hoped that was all. He'd never known a kid to do chores unasked before though, he didn't volunteer as a kid. He did what he was supposed to, no more no less. She did it without even being prompted.
Peter shook his head. "It's still his only options. I mean, come on, I couldn't run your suit with my thing... Could I?" Peter asked. Then began to run the math in his head. "No. I couldn't. The suit wouldn't run for very long, not on what I made."
"That's okay." Strange promised. "Totally normal. You're a little more with it, so we'll probably talk about it once you're done eating. I don't want you to be scared, but I want you to know the truth of what we're working toward and with. If you're up for it and you take the food alright, we'll have a talk. Sound fair?"
"About how bad it was. He just seems...I dunno. Weird sometimes. L-like..." She took a breath. "I think, maybe it was worse than he says. He seems worried, and he doesn't strike me as the type to worry about these things. Sometimes it's like he's stunned to see me doing certain things. I don't know mmm-" She breathed deep through her nose again. "Maybe I'm making it u-up."
"Pepper Potts was the coordinator on that. I just went along with it. Kids aren't exactly my specialty." Tony said flippantly, the way they would imagine he'd speak. He hated these people.
The cabin was really nice. Peter didn't see much of it before going to bed, but... wow, it was nice. All of the noise of the city was gone, replaced with softer things that didn't grate his senses as much. And it was beautiful too. The strange calm that the quiet brought had actually woken him up, because it was so strange. He spent the better part of the early morning on the porch, waiting for the sun rise over the lake. Peter heard Steve before he showed up.
Strange closed Harry Potter and took her hand gently. "It was pretty bad, but we've done lots of tests. You're going to heal alright. It's going to take some time though. It's going to be a bit scary. I'll walk you through it, I'll be here. You'll be okay." He couldn't promise that last bit of course. Physically though, she'd heal. Any impact on her mind though...that was less predictable. Would her moods be different? Her ability to focus? Her mobility? All that was at stake, given where her head had been bashed in. It would be jumbled for a while, but with time she'd heal and once the healing was done they'd have a better idea of what they'd have to deal with. Her trouble speaking was normal, he expected that to linger for a while. And he expected her memories to be a bit hazy.
She almost looked affronted. "I'm a girl who can manipulate time. Why wouldn't I watch Doctor Who? Plus...David Tennant."
It was slowly getting better, Ness could see. She was hopeful, because Strange was. Ness could smell bullshit a mile away. When Strange said her progress was encouraging, Ness knew he wasn't bullshitting. It was just scary and sad, seeing the differences in her.
Clint picked up the burner phone he'd gotten. He dialed the number instantly. "Hey, Ed, I just wanted to talk to you about that work assignment." Clint's eyes drifted over the hotel across the street. Considering that the hotel was set to be demolished, it was weird to see people in it.
Maggie turned her head toward Strange's voice. He was actually there. Holding her hand too in his own gloved hands. "Wh-what are you doing here?"
"The first time I confronted them, there was a sixth man, he stabbed me while I was confronting the others. I fought them off for a time. Then you showed up. They shot at me and you just...jumped in front of me. Everything went sideways so I reset everything, went back ten minutes, took out the sixth man first this time."
Sunday went by quietly. Maggie kept out of Strange's way. More than once she'd found him reading on the sofa in the living room. Something less like a book and more like a tome. She stopped once to ask him what it was about, apparently it was some sort of magical instructional book. "So a spell book?"
Vanessa knew that. All those years ago, Maggie'd been found in an alley by Wade. She'd had nothing but the clothes on her back and her dad's watch. Now there was nothing from her parents, her home.
"Oh, kid." Tony ruffled his hair. "It's adorable. You've got a crush. It's totally normal. And she's a nice girl, she gets your...hero-thing too, which is rare. It's fine. You're totally allowed to think she's cute and to like her."
It’s a chilly night. He’s turned off all the lights he could, and he stares up at the full moon and the sparse stars visible through New York City’s light pollution.
A neat line of cursive curves over his wrist. It’s written in a childish, rounded hand, girlish but without flare. Steve makes out a “y w-e-“ and then hits two letters that don’t exist in the English alphabet. It’s in a language he doesn’t speak, but he can’t help his amazement anyways.
“A couple weeks ago,” Tony says, and suddenly feels dizzy with how much changed, how quickly things have gone, “When we were all still— still here. You said you lied about something.”
“You tell us,” rasps the terror cell leader, shoving the clipboard in front of Tony’s face but not undoing the bonds, “they were in the box. Are they the originals, Stark?”
The party is familiar, a distant echo of the one where, more than a year ago, Tony had needled Cap and fussed over his gloves. The domed ceiling is less grand, perhaps, the view less perfect, the guests a couple links lower on the food chain, the food a little more standard, less fanciful, and yet the sounds and smells are the same. The trills of fake laugher mingle in the air with expensive-for-its-simplicity cologne, with sharp, want-to-make-an-impression perfume, with the faint clicking of heels and scuffs of dress shoes.
