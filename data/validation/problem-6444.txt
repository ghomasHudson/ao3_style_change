Especially since based on the trajectory that Steve had calculated right afterwards, the yellow beam of light had originated from Meridian airspace.
"It looks like home!" Peter exclaimed, nearly knocking Steve onto his ass in his haste to scramble out of the car, his brown eyes wide with awe and wonder as they took everything in. "Papa, it's
"I didn't know who he was then, Tony," said Steve. "I never learned the last names of the kids that I visited with, it's against hospital policy. I just knew him as Peter."
"Aahh," Steve said on a moan, shivering as wave after wave of pain washed over him. His hands and arms felt like they had been encased in ice, so frozen he could no longer even wiggle them. "I—I don't—I don't—"
"JARVIS, you blocked that news footage from all of Pete's stuff, right?" he asked, his fingers tightly curled around his left forearm. The arm had been aching quite a bit lately, no doubt due to stress combined with his recent severe lack of sleep. At Steve's insistence, Tony had just had a complete physical exam with Helen Cho about a month or so ago that included a full cardiac workup, and she had pronounced his heart about as healthy as it could be given everything Tony had put it through.
"I always am, babe, and you know it," Tony said, his eyebrows knitting together into a frown. "And you also know that there's a very fine line between being cautious and being useless, and I absolutely refuse to be useless. That's not how we work."
Tony bit his lip. As much as he'd heard similar stories from a few different people, he couldn't see how they could possibly—
"Very good, sir. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance," the cadet said with a rather confused nod. It was rare indeed for an officer to show his face in the cadets' computer lab, but the kind of information Steve was after wouldn't likely be as easy to find on his handheld datapad.
Those images of his husband lying there on that hospital bed for days on end, hooked to innumerable machines and with his sternum gaping open, not knowing if the surgeon would be able to operate until just moments before he did still haunted Steve, and likely would for the rest of his life.
"No, I suppose not," Steve said quietly. He ran a hand through his hair, shaking his head. "Tony, I am so, so sorry. I wish there was something else I could say, but—"
“Sir?” JARVIS asked.  “Sir, are you all right?  Your heart rate has just undergone quite a sharp increase, and—”
"Yes," Steve said as he trailed his thumb across Tony's cheekbone. He was already dreading having to let him go. "Yes, I'll be here."
"I'm just thinking, honey, okay?" Tony said, trying to not sound too snippy. "Got a bit on my mind."
He was impeccably dressed, with his hair perfectly in place. He had even forgone his usual glasses for some brand-new contact lenses, a luxury he'd never before been able to afford.
"Okay, Papa, I think I've got it," Peter said once he was done. He smiled as he scrolled through the various photos on his camera screen, thinking they would work great in the photo book he was planning to put together after the wedding. "I'm gonna go get some pictures of Dad now, okay? That way you'll get to see what he looked like before the ceremony."
Shifting course, Tony flew back towards the hole in the roof with his heart stuttering, landing on the concrete floor not too far away from where Bucky stood guarding a handcuffed Justin Hammer, his expression suggesting that he wished he could squeeze Hammer's head in with his metal hand. Next to Hammer sat Quentin Beck, who shot a sharp glare in Tony's direction before returning his gaze to the feet of his guarding police officer, with a third man with salt-and-pepper hair sitting next to Beck and shaking his head.
sticker that Tony placed next to it after the jet's last turbine upgrade. "JARVIS, what's our current arrival time estimate?"
"Shit, baby," he choked out as Steve practically swallowed him down. "You're so good, Steve, so goddamn good." His fingers wound into Steve's hair as Steve's hand slid underneath Tony's ass, squeezing it as he hummed his approval, the vibrations rippling up Tony's body like waves as he was finally pulled over the edge.
"Oh now, Captain, or may I call you, Steven?" said Hammer. "I actually think that's more appropriate given the current charges levied against you, don't you?"
"Steve, I think that thing's gaining on you!" shouted Major Lorne from his three. "Hold on, I've almost got a lock on it!"
"All night, which is what's worrying me," Maria answered. "And the batteries for the handlamps are so expensive, so it's not really feasible to keep Tony's on while he's sleeping, and yet—"
“Mmm,” mutters Steve.  “Knowing New York, he’s probably someone who’s either famous or rich.  Or both.”  His jaw twitches as he imagines some uber-wealthy celebrity strutting around in his penthouse apartment over in Midtown, dressed in a silk robe while he drinks Mimosas and plays with rich-people toys all day long.
“The drug trials?  What drug trials?  And what’re you doing looking up drug trials for?” he asked, probably a bit more harshly than was necessary when Peter scowled.
"I love you!" Peter called, whispering a soft, "Bye" as he watched Gwen walk up the steps to her front door, which flew open before she even reached the top. Peter's heart jumped into his throat as Chief Stacy stepped out, giving Peter a friendly wave before following Gwen inside.
"Just… what, keep telling you what you want to hear?" Gwen asked. "Is that it? You want me to keep telling you that it's perfectly fine for you to keep begging your dads to let you join the Avengers, when in reality you're still only sixteen years old and can barely get through a school day without breaking something? You want me to keep telling you that it's completely normal for you to ditch me at the school dance just so you can run off to freaking
"Yeah, but Steve's right," Bruce said with a shrug. "If they come for one of us then they're gonna be coming for all of us, so we should probably be ready."
"Okay, but if that's the case, then why haven't they started attacking us yet? I mean, I know I'm no expert, but at the moment those satellites seem to be working just like you and your dad designed 'em to work, so unless I'm missing something—"
"He was afraid that you'd bar him from seeing me again if I told you," said Peter. "But Dad, please don't do that. He doesn't really have anything else to do, and—"
"The first two satellites are transmitting just like we'd hoped, Colonel," Tony answered as he shoved his glasses back on. "So unless something weird happens with the rest of 'em, it's looking like this is actually gonna work."
"Whereas you're innately enhanced, like Pietro and Wanda. Yeah, we've been over this a million times already," Gwen said. She frowned as she tugged on her long, blonde ponytail. "What's up with you this morning?"
"I still don't understand how you can wear these things all the time," he said as Papa tugged on the cuffs of his sleeves, eyeing his sleeve length with a critical eye. "It makes me feel like I'm not supposed to move."
"No, no, no, Papa, it's me! It's Peter!" Peter quickly tore the mask from his head so Papa could see his face, hoping the sight of him would help Papa to calm down. "See? It's me!"
If he had known ahead of time that this mission was going to involve him trekking through freezing-cold mountainous terrain, he might’ve hesitated a bit before agreeing to Director Fury’s request.  It was putting it mildly to say that Steve was not too fond of the cold, and while the uniform he was wearing—made by Tony’s own hands—was insulated well enough, the crystal-clear skies above him combined with the fact that it was already well below zero could only mean that after dark the temperatures would plummet, leaving it dangerously cold even for him.
Bucky rolled his eyes. "Oh Stevie, you're not a kid anymore. There's no hard rule that you have to wait till the third date."
"I'm only trying to help them," Peter said again, hoping it would chase at least some of the guilt away. "They need all the help they can get."
"Good." Tony cupped Steve's cheeks in his hands, brushing his tears away with his thumbs before stepping back, shaking his head as his lips twitched into a smirk. "Look at you. Even all bandaged up you're still hotter than hell."
"Tony!" Steve said, chuckling as he shook his head. Only Tony Stark would try to flirt while sick as a dog.
Tony's smile faded a bit as he tilted his head, fiddling with the stem of an apple. "Not exactly. I… that kinda came about a bit later, but… yeah, I guess you could say that they were hoping I'd create something like that. General O'Brien and the other government leaders have been trying to come up with a way to build an orbital defence system for a long time, and when none of their guys could seem to do it to their specifications, they turned to me."
"I am wondering how what appeared to be an internal conflict within SHIELD managed to escalate enough to require the presence of the Avengers?"
"Yeah." Tony didn't move as Rhodey left the room, not taking his eyes off the monitor in front of him, and the lines of code that were systematically scrolling across it from bottom to top. He had already been over every single aspect of the X-302’s systems at least three times and found nothing that he could pinpoint as the source of the problem, but he figured it couldn't hurt to check them again.
"I will try, okay?" he finally said. "I honestly can't promise that I'll be able to get away tomorrow, but I definitely will the day after. All right?"
At Tony's nod, Helen gave him a sympathetic smile. "There's nothing life-threatening, so you don't need to worry about that. Captain Rogers has several broken bones, including his left cheek and orbital bones, his left ulna, three ribs on his left side and two on his right, his left fibula, and most of the bones in his left foot. He also has two broken knuckles on his right hand, as well as a hairline fracture of the right radius that's already calloused over, so I'm guessing that was one of his earliest injuries."
“Pretty sure I don't need to pardon you for that,” Steve replied, relieved when his voice didn't break.  It was bad enough he hadn’t even been able to stop his fingers from shaking long enough to tie his own stupid tie.
Peter thought. Dr Strange's reason for completely ignoring Dad's pleas to get them to Wakanda had to have been because he had
"No, no, no, not like that! Let's go this way. There, that's more like it," Peter muttered, his fingers flying so quickly over the tiny datapad keyboard that they were starting to cramp. He'd been at it for over three hours now, ever since he had noticed some unknown person trying to mess around with JARVIS's code.
"Sarah found Peter unresponsive this morning at around 0730," Sam stated. "After she and Sharon Carter were able to resuscitate him, I transported him here, but—"
“Mmm.  He damn well better be.”  Downing the last of the coffee in his cup, Tony rolled his shoulders, trying to ease some of the tight soreness that had taken up permanent occupancy across his neck and upper back.
"Tony?" Steve gasped as he pulled back in alarm, his terror skyrocketing as he noticed that the slight rasp he'd heard in Tony's breathing the night before was much, much worse, his pyjamas pants were practically glued to him with sweat, and his skin tone had transformed into a sickly grey colour that human skin had no business being.
"Oh, I don't know," said Steve. "What do you feel like drawing? More of the adventures of Mrs Bird?"
"All right, then we just have to figure out who'd be able to supply these alternative materials," said Steve. "JARVIS?"
He and Ma had been in that store before a bunch of times, as Ma did most of her usual shopping there. But that was the first time that Steve would be shopping for something so…
Steve thought as he slowly made his way towards Peter's room. There was no sense in stressing an already sick child even more by admitting that he'd discovered that his grandfather was the national pihrah.
"Well… yeah," Peter said. He rubbed at his temples, wishing he had a spare pair of glasses. "She said her mom and dad wanted to meet me, so… why? Is that weird or something?"
"It will take approximately forty-five minutes to achieve limited firing capability, sir," JARVIS said. "I'm afraid that I cannot give you an estimate for full capabilities at this time."
close, and he'd never been able to come untouched before. "So fucking good, baby, you're too good to me."
“Fuck!  Tony!” he cried into the darkness as the coil snapped deep in his gut and he came, harder than he ever had in his life.  He laid there afterwards for several minutes, relishing in the final ebbs of the pleasure as it surged through his veins, igniting pathways that Steve wasn't sure would ever catch fire again.
"Pretty sure Hulk would have a thing or two to say about that, but you're definitely damn close," Tony said. "I'm also pretty sure that Carol could hold her own with those stones too, based on what she did to that ship."
After however many hundreds of hours of work by both Tony and Peter, Project Phoenix was as ready as it would ever be.
With a final kiss to Steve's hipbone, Tony crawled back up his body, blanketing him with his own as he met Steve's eager mouth. Steve's arms curled around him as their kiss deepened, flipping them so he was on top, his knees bracketing Tony's hips. He was already hard again, the pleasure shooting down his back like a missile as Tony's legs hooked around his waist, his heels pressing against the backs of Steve's thighs as their cocks rubbed together.
"All right, sweetheart. All right," Steve murmured. He sucked in a deep breath, squeezing Tony's shoulder.
"Honey, I've told you this about a million times too," interrupted Tony. "With the currently available surgical tools and techniques, there's nothing anyone can do about it, so there's really no point." He dropped Steve's hand, shaking his head as he stepped back. "What's gotten into you all of a sudden? I thought you were fine once we swapped out the palladium core, so… what? What aren't you telling me?"
"Babe, really?" Tony suddenly said from the far corner of the living room, startling Steve enough that he almost dropped his pencil. "Why the hell are you still watching that, you know it's only gonna piss you off?"
"He's ready, gentlemen," she said. "Once the serum infusion is complete we'll disconnect the ventilator for the radiation burst, which should only be about fifteen seconds long."
"Dad and Papa are gonna need my help, JARVIS," Peter answered, grunting as he shot out another web. The cool
Tony bristled at the mention of Hank, but managed to keep his mouth shut as Steve began peppering Lang with various questions, including why he chose to jump back in to committing crimes shortly after getting out of prison.
Tony had even asked Rhodey to send him some resources, information on groups where vets could go to talk about their combat experiences with other vets, and recommendations for professional experts if the group discussions weren’t enough.
"Yeah, sure, if you call sitting in a luxury box the size of your apartment and eating a five course meal, 'normal'," said Ned, rolling his eyes. "But anyway, I am glad that you weren't attacked by a monster again, that must've been so scary."
“There we go, buddy,” he murmured as the doors closed, tucking Peter as close to his side as he could.  “We’re almost there.”
Gwen let out a heavy sigh, nodding somberly. "Okay. But can you please tell him that I called once he wakes up? I'm just worried—the whole team, we're just worried about him, and… the way he ran out of Liz's party after what Flash said to him, I just… and I'm sure you've heard that Mr Toomes got arrested? Something about some illegal weapons trafficking or something… that's what I heard from my dad, at least, but—"
"Together," Steve said as his eyes locked with Tony's again, nearly blown black as his strokes slowly gained speed. "You're so beautiful, mo grá, and I love you so much. Please don't ever think you need to hide your body from me."
"Yeah, JARVIS, I'm still here," Tony replied. He sucked in a deep breath, glancing up at the clock. If he worked hard for the next two hours or so that would leave him with just enough time to get out to the hospital to see Peter for a bit before he had to be back for curfew.
Try as he might, it just keeps getting harder and harder.  Steve’s never been one to have a decent poker face, he’s heard that pretty much his entire life.  But this… when even the kid’s starting to pick up on it…
"Yep. But apparently they didn't pay nurses all that great back then, and so she had to work a whole lot just to keep them in their house," said Peter. "And pay for my papa's medicines whenever he got sick. That's one reason why my dad's always donating money and supplies to hospitals around the world. He always says that no one should ever have to go bankrupt just 'cause they get sick, or have a sick kid. He even helped to build a brand-new wing on a hospital in my grandma's hometown, not too far from where our house is in Ireland. And he even named it after her."
"Then let's kick his ass!" Dad stated, his armoured fist slamming against whatever shield Papa was carrying, the ear-splitting sound reverberating throughout the massive prison.
Gwen shook her head, her long ponytail swinging against her shoulders. "Oh gosh, it's okay! I just wish you would've told me ahead of time that you were allergic to peppermint, I could've had Mom make something else for dessert."
"The Maw is one of my most devoted children. A devotion that stretches beyond the borders of universes," Thanos continued as the Voldemort alien stepped over next to Thanos, Steve's rage spiking at the smug look on his hideous face. "And now, once I have rid this planet of all of its pesky and annoying little people, he will be properly rewarded with it. And he will do with it whatever he pleases."
"Get—get me out?" Papa stammered. "But—but—I thought—" He planted his palm against the floor, grimacing as he pushed himself up into a semi-sitting position, his head tilting as he tried to focus in on Peter's face. "Peter, what in the world are you doing here? Is Dad with you?"
"Oh really? Now why doesn't that surprise me?" Sam asked as he turned to his boyfriend. "Is that why I've been stuck paying for everything lately?"
Uncle Bucky's eyes went wide as he took another sip of Dr Pepper. "What, a good-lookin' boy like you? Nah, I can't believe that."
"Waiting on your order, honey," he replied as he slowed to a hover about fifteen metres over Steve's position, causing Steve to chuckle. It wasn't exactly professional to be using personal endearments out in the field, but Steve knew that it was pointless to call him out on it.
Dad's nostrils flared as he huffed out a sharp breath. "Well, since he doesn't see fit to actually tell us how we win, we've got no goddamn way of knowing that, right? But anything's gotta be better than just sitting here on our asses! My husband—!"
Steve's third trip, while definitely not as pleasant as the second, was probably the most important of them all, giving Steve a much-needed boost of both morale and confidence that this ridiculous, cockamamie plan of theirs was actually going to work.
"While he was sitting on your lap?" Peter asked warily. "Wait, nevermind, I don't think I wanna know. But I'm ready to do my homework now if you guys are done… talking."
"Ah, but you mean normal human consumption, right JARVIS?" Sam said, laughing as he clapped Bucky on the shoulder. "'Cause I'm pretty sure the rest of these guys could eat just about anything and it wouldn't kill 'em."
Pym's eyes finally flicked up to Howard then, meeting them for only the briefest of moments before flitting away, but just long enough for a shiver to race down Howard's spine at the intense hatred hidden within them. Something was terribly amiss, and Howard didn't at all like it when things were amiss.
“But we are doing everything that we can to locate Captain Rogers,” Fury continued.  “However, given the current rising tensions in the area and the weather system that’s dumped over a metre of snow there in the last few days, we are having a bit of trouble obtaining permission to enter the country.”
"Dad said there's no way to determine what it means until we're able to meet with a representative of the Wakandan government," Papa cut in. "We've got Director Fury trying to open a diplomatic dialogue now, but there's so many government loopholes he's gotta jump through first, and—"
"No!" Peter exclaimed, his eyes wide as he shook his head. "Papa, you don't understand! Thanos, he's gonna—!"
Peter's phone buzzed in his pocket then, and he pulled it out to find a text from Uncle James, saying that he and Uncle Bucky were waiting for him in the parking lot.
"It's all right, Tony," said Bruce. "I can head over to New Asgard with Thor and take a look at things first, and then you can just come over when you're ready. No one expects you to be away from your son while he's recovering."
"Yeah," she said as her father pulled up in his patrol car, with Papa's truck directly behind him. "Just text me once you know for sure."
As he watched his father wheel Papa out the door, Peter's heart felt the heaviest it had in a long, long time. Everything had been going so well until just a few short hours ago that it had seemed almost too good to be true. But now…
"Okay," Peter said, grinning. He opened his notebook, showing Dad the code he'd written earlier that day. "How 'bout I tell you about how I figured out how to program JARVIS to monitor the X-302s while they're on their space missions?"
"Steve, I wish I knew," said Sam. "But I'm afraid that's a better question for people like Tony and Bruce. Or maybe even Thor."
Tony's eyebrows shot up, and he glanced at Steve, shrugging. "Oh, well, speak of the devil. Go ahead and put her through, J."
Tony frowned as he slid on his glasses, checking the clock. "Yeah, yeah, okay, Pete. Look, I gotta go, but… we're not done talking about this, okay?"
“Well, that was pretty smart of you,” says Mr Rogers.  “So, if it’s all right with your father, why don't we head down to the pool and you can show me, hmm?”
They remained in the tub for almost three hours, with Bruce slowly increasing the water's temperature until both Peter and Steve managed to stop shivering. The whole time the four of them barely moved, with Peter clinging to his Auntie Nat like a baby koala and eventually falling asleep once his hands were wrapped, while Tony held onto Steve, who seemed to be absolutely shell-shocked, his body as rigid as an iron rod and his fingernails digging into the skin of Tony's neck and shoulders. Tony trailed his fingers through Steve's hair and murmured soothing words, his heart thudding against his ribcage as he exchanged occasional furtive glances with Natasha, who looked just as frightened and angry as he was.
“That’s so awesome!” Peter murmured as he studied the drawings, which were obviously drawn freehand with the oil-based markers that worked so well on glass.  Whoever had drawn them was obviously very talented.
"Well, I'd appreciate it if you could bear with me for a moment, Anthony, because I'm a bit confused," Hammer said, clasping his hands together. "How exactly am I at a disadvantage here? Because I know I'm not quite the expert on military tactics as Captain Rogers might be, but I do believe that—"
"Now then. Mr Stark's qualifications more than speak for themselves, including not one, but two degrees from Langara's most prestigious university, one of which is in the field of thermodynamic astrophysics and of which he is currently the only expert on the entire planet."
Steve's mind was swirling so fast that he felt lightheaded, the knot in his throat so big that he could barely swallow. This had to be just another HYDRA trick, because there was no way that his Tony would ever speak to him like that, with such contempt and hatred. Tony loved him.
But before he could even finish his sentence, people began pouring out of the circles and onto the plain, lining up behind Alt-Steve as if they were awaiting his orders. Wizards, Asgardians, a greyish, heavily-tattooed alien who looked like he'd just stepped out of a ring at the WWE—
"Thank you, sir," he said, hoping like hell that he sounded like he meant it. "That's quite an honour."
“I'll ask Dad about it this weekend,” he said, grimacing as he noticed his reflection in the mirror, and the curls hanging down so low on his forehead they were tangling in his eyelashes.  He definitely needed that haircut.
Including the capture and torture of Steve, which, in Tony's opinion, was all the motivation that he needed to want to kill him.
"See, babe? Pete's just fine," Tony said. He dug his fingertips into Steve's scalp, pulling a soft moan from his throat. "JARVIS would never lie."
Steve's lips twitched, his eyes softening just a bit as he glanced over to where their team stood, surrounded by Thor's people and protected by a group of wizards who up until a year ago, Tony hadn't believed even existed.
"I'm so glad you like it, little guy," Steve said happily. "I hope we'll all be really happy here together."
"Well, anyway," Peter said, clearing his throat. "Have you ever heard the phrase, 'blow smoke up your ass'?"
Rain was beating against the windshield like a runaway snare drum as Tony pulled his ancient car into the hospital parking lot, turning to Steve as soon as he cut the engine. He'd been trying hard to keep a lid on his near-frantic worry ever since he'd watched Steve get dressed in his dress uniform at oh dark thirty that morning, and had managed to do a fairly decent job of it, if he did say so himself. But after staying silent all through Steve's harrowing patrol—the rain had kicked in only a couple of minutes after Steve was airborne—and through dinner in the crowded mess hall, Tony was practically vibrating out of his skin, the stormy grey clouds and pouring rain only amplifying his restlessness.
About fifteen or twenty seconds later his phone beeped, indicating that JARVIS was cutting power to his foot repulsors because he was only ten seconds out.
"If that is indeed the case, Mr Chairman, perhaps it would've been better to have simply asked for our presence rather than serving us with subpoenas the moment we disembarked from a family vacation?"
Heat burst through Steve's body like an exploding grenade at Tony's desperate tone, and he chanced a glance up at his husband's face, nearly climaxing at the mere sight of him. With his wet-plastered hair and hooded eyes lined with those thick, inky eyelashes, the sheer beauty of him was almost overwhelming.
Steve growled then, one hand sliding down Tony's back to squeeze his ass as his other cupped Tony's cheek, tilting his head up and capturing his lips. Tony whimpered as Steve licked into his mouth, scraping his blunt fingernails up Steve's back.
Peter tipped his head back against the seat, trying to keep his tears contained. He could feel his papa's worried blue eyes practically boring a hole through his skull via the rearview mirror, but he really didn't want to get into it right there in the truck.
But then again, Tony never could rest when someone he loved was in pain, and Steve had never been able to hide his pain from him, no matter how hard he tried. Pretty much ever since they met, Tony had always been able to see right through him.
Steve narrowed his eyes, not too difficult given how swollen they were, his heart already thudding against his sore chest. "Think your trust has been misplaced, Doctor."
He was still finding it difficult to wrap his mind around it. Being stuck inside that HYDRA bunker with no windows and no concept of day or night, Steve hadn't realised just how much time had actually passed until Tony informed him that they had been looking for him for almost a month.
"The thing is, honey, it's perfectly understandable to be scared for your kid," he began. "I was constantly terrified for Pete, especially with him growing up in the middle of a war. Before he was too sick to go to school, I used to worry about him all damn day while he was gone, thinking that a stray bomb would miss its target one day and hit the school instead, or something like that. And then once he started staying home all the time, I'd worry that he'd just stop breathing and die before I could get home. And I hate to tell you this, but the fear doesn't exactly go away. Just 'cause Pete's heart is fixed now doesn't mean that I'm done worrying about him. You just… kinda learn to live with it. Otherwise you'll just be paralysed from it all the time."
"Sure, little guy," Steve said with a short laugh. "I'm gonna go get cleaned up now, okay? Be ready to go when I get back."
"Sure, I can take a look," said Carol, almost like Steve had asked her to take out the trash or something. "I'll leave now."
"Acknowledging the inevitable isn't the same as giving up, Tony," Howard said to Tony's back as he headed for the door. "You'd do well to remember that."
"Very good, Captain," said JARVIS. "Please be advised that these names are currently all manually reported, which means that—"
"Okay, Tony," Gamora said with a slight smile. "I do think you're right that this could work, but only with Mantis's help."
Based on his experience, though, Steve had a strong feeling that moving on from this particular battle was going to be different.
There really was only one thing—okay, two things—that Steve was afraid of.  Losing Tony and Peter, and HYDRA.
"I understand," Steve said. He put on his cowl, nodding towards Thor. "After I introduce us, I'll let you explain to the prince what you saw in your vision."
In an instant, Obie’s face transformed from its sickly steel-grey colour to boiling hot red, so much so that for a moment, Tony was afraid his head might actually explode.
"Happy New Year, Daddy," Peter whispered once it was over, his eyes already at half-mast. A knot rose in Tony's throat at Peter calling him 'Daddy', something he hadn't heard Peter say in quite a while.
"Yeah, and that's not gonna happen, and you know it," stated Peter, groaning in frustration when Dad rolled his eyes. "Look, I know you hate it when I say stuff like this, so I'll just say it one more time and then shut up about it for now, okay?"
Obie chortled as he took another puff of his cigar.  “Oh, I’m always worrying about you, Tony, you know that.  But all right, I guess I’ll take your word for it this time.  Is she cute?”
"I'm pretty sure our new house has a nice bathtub," Steve whispered as his hands slid around Tony's waist, pulling him back against Steve's chest. "It's not as big as that one, but I'm still hoping that you'll enjoy it with me."
"But not trustworthy enough to share your tech with us?" Tony asked. "Even after everything we've told you?"
When Dad didn't respond, Peter continued.  “It also means that we need to go and check on Steve.  Dad, I’m worried about him!  He probably thinks we’ve abandoned him, and—and I’m afraid of what he might do!  He needs us!”
Bucky rolled his eyes. "Are you still planning on ditching Sam and me this afternoon?" he asked, each word enunciated like he was speaking to a very small child.
"Yes," Steve whispered, pleading with his lust-blown eyes as he rolled his hips against Tony's. "Please. Teastaíonn níos mó uaim!"
"Eyes on me, soldier. Don't you dare look away, you got that?" he said as firmly as he could muster, his breaths coming out in little puffs of white in the frigid air. He had no idea if Steve could hear him or not, but he also knew that Steve had become something of an expert on reading lips lately with Clint's help, so Tony knew that if he was still conscious that he could at least see what he was saying.
"Colonel, what exactly are you saying?" Steve asked as a tear trailed down his cheek. "Are you saying that Peter's going to—that he's gonna—?"
"Honey, there's no shame in asking for help when you need it," Tony said. "And you're only hurting your feet more by trying to walk on them."
Steve breathed in again, nuzzling even further into Tony's hair as Tony let out a semi-contented sigh, his ass pressing rather insistently against Steve's already aching erection. Ever since Tony had moved in with him not a day had passed where Steve didn’t wake up so hard it was almost painful. Aside from how much he loved Tony, Steve's physical attraction to him was beyond anything that he'd ever experienced, or even dreamed of. Tony was always talking about Steve being perfect, but to Steve, Tony was the one who was perfect.
"Hey, now!" exclaimed Sam. "Who gave you permission to go ripping on Nawlins? In the summer? When it's—?"
Peter let out a sigh as he shifted again, trying to get comfortable. "Actually, you probably can't. The Broadway musical casts usually stick to just playing on Broadway, so…"
"So, if we could take the tesseract and put it into some kind of vibranium-lined casing, and then put that into a self-contained computer that was also powered by one of the arc reactors, then it would be able to send out a continuous signal to each of the sister satellites, and—"
Sam shot him a wide smile. "Well, I don't know, Cap. I guess you'll just have to come and watch the games so you can see for yourself."
"Yeah, and I told you that it's not gonna happen!" the man continued. "Those goddamn flying suits of his are making it impossible to get anything!"
“Okay, Cap, here we go,” Tony says, his fingers tightening around Steve’s ankle and just below his knee.  “Three… two… one… !”
"Oh, and now you suddenly need our help? What the hell for?" demanded Sam. The golden circle was still spinning and throwing off sparks, and, as Steve looked past Dr Strange, he could've sworn that he saw the inside some kind of building behind him, as though he'd simply stepped through the circle from his home directly into the park.
When Steve didn't answer the man stepped closer, giving the window a sharp rap. "Now, Captain, you of all people should know that it's impolite to not acknowledge someone who is speaking to you."
"All right, then," Tony said, pursing his lips as he took after one of the suits trying to escape back through the hole in the roof. Tony ducked down, coming up directly underneath it and activating his laser just as they both exited the bunker to an unexpected flash of bright sunlight. Tony winced, distracted by the light just long enough to allow the Hammer suit time to swing around and knock him between the shoulder blades with one of their Chitauri grenade thingys.
“Yep, he’s waiting for me outside,” said Peter.  He shifted his backpack to both shoulders, hugging his shopping bag close and wondering if he should ask Steve if he was okay.
There was no way he was going to allow Steve to sit in some HYDRA holding facility until Monday, because he knew without a doubt that there was no way Steve would even still be in that holding facility come Monday.
Sam let out a soft chuckle. "Hey, that kinda comes with the territory, doesn't it? At least we got to see the whole game."
"Yes," Wanda whispered. "They only let him out when they need him to do something for them. And they always use the words first, so he never even remembers what he's done afterwards." She paused, chomping down hard on her bottom lip. "But for some reason, I can always remember what I've done, which is why—" Another tear streaked its way down her cheek. "It's why your papa is afraid of me now. Whenever he sees me, he's terrified. I can see it in his eyes."
"No," Steve interrupted. He cupped Tony's face in his hands, his blue eyes boring into Tony's like lasers. "Don't you even say it, sweetheart, 'cause it's not true."
Peter shivered, burrowing even further down into his hoodie as he checked his phone and huffing in frustration when he saw that he still had around fifteen miles to go.
"Well, I thought it was kinda funny," Peter answered. "Apparently in the eighteenth century doctors didn't know how to treat hernias, especially inguinal hernias, so they somehow came up with the idea that shooting tobacco smoke up the affected person's rectum would somehow cure the hernia."
This chapter has a bunch of pure, domestic Avengers fluff, one of my very favourite things to write.  I hope you all enjoy it!  💖
"Yeah, well, can't say I'm too shocked about that. Thor's appetite's probably big enough for three people. Or three super soldiers, as it were."
"Yeah, that's my Uncle James, he's been staying with me," answered Peter. "Well, one of my Uncle Jameses. I actually have two of 'em."
"You're exactly who I want to be with," Steve had reassured him. "And I don't care what anyone says."
"Hey, Dad. How was your day?" Peter said once he answered the phone, his voice so small and tired that Tony's heart lurched.
"I am unable to get a completely accurate count while you are in motion, sir, but if I had to guess I'd say there are at least twenty remaining functional suits," answered JARVIS.
With a heavy sigh, Steve settled himself down onto the remaining couch and tipped his head back, briefly closing his eyes. He knew he should take Sam's advice and try to get some sleep, but he also knew that the attempt would be futile. With the way his mind was already racing in a million different directions, there'd be no way he'd be able to dial it back enough to relax.
Natasha gave a stuttered nod, her lips tightly pursed. "Steve, I have to believe it, for Clint and Pietro's sake. Otherwise… what're we even doing here?"
Begrudgingly, of course. Shoving him into an office the size of a broom closet and forcing him to work such long hours that he'd barely been able to see his son while he'd been home, much less now that Peter was stuck in the hospital, waiting on a surgery that might never happen and costing so many credits per day that Tony would already have to work until he was about a hundred and ten to pay it all off.
"Yeah, yeah, Sam, sorry," Steve said dismissively, ignoring Sam's skeptical raised eyebrow. "Just… seems like the days are just kinda flying by lately. I mean, I could've sworn it was just a few months ago that Peter was teaching me how to use a credit card, and now all of a sudden I'm teaching him how to drive on the weekends."
"Oh no!" Gwen screamed as the monster swung its fiery arm, hitting the wall near the ceiling and causing it and the ceiling to come crumbling down, completely blocking the exit door. Uncle Bucky jumped back, shielding Gwen with his body as Peter leapt onto what remained of the wall, attempting to stabilise it so the rest of the ceiling didn't collapse as well. He could hear the screams of the rest of the panicked moviegoers who were now trapped inside the auditorium, with the main doors completely engulfed in flames and the emergency exit blocked by mountains of smoldering wood and drywall.
"No, Papa, it's really me," Peter managed past the huge lump in his throat. He had tried not to imagine how badly Papa would be hurt by the time he found him, but this… this was so much worse than he'd dared to conjure up in his worst nightmare. His hair and beard were overgrown and matted with sweat and dried blood, there wasn't a single millimetre of his exposed skin that wasn't covered with a bruise or scrape, and judging by the stiff way Papa was lying in his arms, he likely had a multitude of broken bones as well.
"Of course it's not," she agreed. "So that's why I'm here. No child wants to be cooped up all by himself, and especially not one who would much rather be outside, right? I believe Steven told me that you're a master tree climber. Am I right?"
"Well, okay, you know I'm not gonna make you tell me," Tony said as he covered Steve's hand with his own. "But you are gonna talk to Sam about it, right?"
A massive shudder rippled through Tony's body as he remembered that night, that horrible night when his life got turned on its head. He'd been only six years old, his entire chest throbbing in pain as he screamed for his mother into the pitch-blackness of his bedroom, pain that only got worse when his mom finally returned to him, her face streaked with tears that had ruined all of the makeup she had so carefully applied.
“So, I’m thinking we should first try and establish where exactly we are,” he begins.  “‘Cause I don't know about you, but it sure seems to me like we’re not in Kansas anymore.”
“I think I’ve got a pretty good guess,” he whispered a few heartbeats later.  “And if I’m right, then it should be a no-brainer.”
Tony instinctively reached for Steve, only to have his arm grabbed by one of the other agents. "Use against me?" he said as he tore himself free. "They don't have
He was so busy, but, as he’d pointed out to Steve many times, he was also so much happier at work now that he hardly noticed it.
"I drew him that way so I could see him that way," he said softly. "And he will be a normal kid again, Tony, I promise you. As soon as all this is over."
"I just want to tell you again what an honour it is to see you participating in your son's education like this, Captain Rogers," Mr Harrington gushed. "I've always been such a big proponent of parental involvement in a child's schooling, and you, sir, are just—"
"Which is why you're the lady in charge, Pep," Tony said proudly. At the moment he couldn't honestly remember if the company had even conducted regular performance reviews when he'd been CEO. "But just out of curiosity, who's the project leader that's got you concerned?"
"Already on it, Cap," Clint said as he launched an arrow just as the target dove down, aiming towards him. Sparks flew as it bounced three times, shedding parts before skidding to a halt.
"Okay, good." That probably meant that Peter hadn't heard about what happened yet. "Get Pepper, Rhodey, and Sam on the line, will ya? I need to talk to them."
Peter had also encouraged Steve to ask Tony out on their first date, explaining that the homophobic standards Steve had grown up with were no longer acceptable. Steve could remember like it was yesterday how happy he had been when Steve told him he and Tony were getting married, and how proudly he had carried out his duties as Tony's best man during their ceremony.
"Ahh, yeah," Tony murmured after a short pause. "Or at least, I made an educated guess based on some of the stories you've told me." He leaned back, his brown eyes a mixture of love, concern, and admiration. "Did it work?"
"I am absolutely positive," Steve replied. "I love you, Tony, and I want to marry you. Will you marry me?"
“Yeah, I don't do too much without a backup plan,” says Tony.  “Got caught once without one, and that was all it took, ya know?”
"Thank you," Steve whispered as he closed his eyes, hoping against hope that the rest of the night would be uneventful.
"Yeah, I'm not surprised," said Colonel Phillips as he shot Steve a wink. "Ah, Howard's asked if he could go over a couple of things with the two of you before we get started. Just a couple of changes that he'd like to make to the regular protocol since Peter is a child who's still growing, rather than a fully-grown man like Steven was here."
Tony was relieved to find that the hospital in Atlanta had already been security checked and cleared by the time they arrived, with Happy personally standing guard outside of the cordoned-off treatment room while Helen examined Steve. Steve was unconscious, the result of another dose of Helen's super-soldier pain medication that she gave him right before they landed. He had been trying to just bear through the pain, and even tried to convince Tony that he didn't need it, but thankfully Tony was able to get him to change his mind. He was in such bad shape that Helen couldn't even examine him while awake without risk of causing further injury, so she'd instead busied herself with tending to Peter's minor injuries during the flight, which turned out to be not much more than a few cuts and a lot of bruises, all of which had already started to heal.
Once Papa's own boutonnière was in place, Peter's eyes swept across his fancy dress uniform, pausing on the shiny, brand-new medal that he'd received from Colonel Phillips for his pivotal role in Project Phoenix. The medal ceremony, during which Dad was also honoured with a medal and an official certificate of appreciation, had been televised world-wide, cementing Dad and Papa's growing celebrity even more. Peter's medal and certificate, presented to him in a private, no-reporters-allowed ceremony beforehand, were both framed and hanging up on the wall in Peter's bedroom.
"Nope, nope, don't ask," Peter said quickly as Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky launched into one of their verbal jab competitions. He leaned closer, whispering, "It's a Monty Python thing. I think."
"Oh," he said again, a bit louder this time. "I guess… I guess I hadn't thought about it like that."
"Yeah, yeah. Did I mention the mother hen part yet?" muttered Tony. "Now, go on and regale Pete with your vast knowledge of early twentieth century cold remedies. I'm sure he's eating it up."
He needed to be patient.  And for someone who had always struggled with being patient, that was likely going to be one of the most difficult monsters for Steve to conquer.
"Oh, nothing," she said as she giggled again. "Just that you think it's perfectly normal to refer to
Steve's heart leapt into his throat as T'Challa frowned. "We open the barrier," he said, low and tight.
Peter thought bitterly. While Colonel Phillips had released a statement during his initial press conference saying that Howard Stark had in fact been framed for treason all those years ago by some guy named Hank Pym, Peter knew that the public's opinion of him was probably not going to magically change overnight.
Then came the hospital visits, something that Steve had begun doing as a way to satisfy his desire to think of himself as a father-type figure without any of the responsibility—and risk—of having an actual child of his own. For a long time they had been an excellent source of stress relief, revealing in the oohs and aahs of an awed child for an hour or so every few days. Steve had always imagined that he would've been the same way if his father had lived, hanging onto Papa's every word as he told story after story of the aircraft he had flown and the battles he had fought.
Tipping his head back against the chair, Steve closed his eyes, trying like hell to make some sense of what had happened. He and Tony had returned to the penthouse only moments before, and were still undressing each other when JARVIS announced that the Compound was under attack. Steve's head still ached from the mental whiplash of going from such all-encompassing desire to such immediate terror and panic in less than a split-second's time, an experience he had no desire to ever,
"There are three left, Captain!" she said as she lifted off from the ground, using her levitation power to fly back towards her brother and Natasha.
Tony, you feel so good,” Steve rasped as pleasure shot through him like a bullet, the searing heat driving back all the remnants of the memories Steve desperately wished he could burn.  Leaning onto his elbow, Steve quickly slid both of their pants down and reached for the bottle of lube he’d stashed under his pillow, slicking up his palm before curling his fingers around both of their cocks.
your fault, do you understand me? Don't you even be talking like that! Do you have any idea how your dads would feel if they heard you saying stuff like that?"
“Hmph,” Steve grumbles as he tries to guide his focus back to the grant.  He supposes it’s a waste of his time and mental energy to keep contemplating when he could just be patient and wait for the meeting instead.
"Oh," Peter said, even though he didn't quite understand. No matter what Uncle Bucky said, it still didn't make sense that Uncle Sam wasn't there. The only time Peter had seen Uncle Sam anywhere other than at Uncle Bucky's side was when he'd gone to get him food.
"I imagine this all looks a bit familiar, eh, Captain?" Colonel Phillips said as he suddenly appeared at Steve's left side.
Empty. It was exactly how Tony felt every single time he had to look at the man who was his father. Since Peter's near-death experience rage had worked its way in there too, taking up residence as a very close second, but since Tony didn't often have enough energy to spend so much of it raging at Howard, empty would just have to suffice.
A boisterous pounding on the front door followed by a loud, "Oi!" prevented Tony from saying anything else, and he gently set Peter's hand down at his side.
They laid there for awhile, just clinging to each other's sticky, sweat-soaked bodies with their hearts beating in tandem. Tony was so relaxed and sated that by the time Steve kissed him on the cheek and rolled him onto his side, he had nearly fallen asleep. He winced as Steve gently pulled out of him, then gathered him into his arms and carried him into their shower, washing his hair and body with the same reverence he'd just displayed during their lovemaking.
"Of course it is," said Tony. "I'm not so dense as to not understand that. You and Barton should be proud of how well you've been able to steer those kids onto the right track."
"What exactly did Beck accomplish with this particular coding change? 'Cause to me, it almost looks like he—"
And then the claws opened, and Peter was free falling through the frigid air, barely able to get his bearings as his suit's built-in parachute deployed, slowing his plummet towards the ice-covered lake just enough to keep his legs from breaking as he slammed down onto the surface.
Covering his mouth with his hand, Tony headed down the short hallway to his bedroom, relieved to find it spared the catastrophic condition of the rest of the house. He quickly crossed the room to open the window, gulping in a few lungfuls of the cooling night air.
JARVIS piloted the suit directly through their main living quarters and into Peter's bathroom, where the huge soaking bathtub was filled to the brim with warm water. Natasha was sitting inside the tub in her ballet clothes with a shivering Peter wrapped in her arms, her fingers stroking his hair and his head resting on her shoulder while Helen Cho examined his bruised and bloodied knuckles with a critical eye.
Tony said on a moan as Steve began to stroke them, grinding his hips against Tony’s as Tony’s knees hooked over his hips, his heels pressing against the backs of Steve’s thighs.  “Shit, baby, you're so good.  You feel so fucking good!”
Steve glanced over at Tony, whose look of pure, unadulterated adoration nearly brought him to his knees.
Dad winces.  “Ahh, any chance we make it five instead?” he asks.  “Four’s pushing it a little for me most days.”
Stepping out of the car, Steve waited until Tony joined him on the sidewalk before heading towards the store.  About three steps in their hands brushed, which Steve took as an opportunity to intertwine their fingers, flooding his entire body with a tingling sensation.
"Cap, be advised there's another tank on the south side of the building," Sam said. "And it's still firing."
"All right," Steve said reluctantly. His beautiful full lips curled into a soft smile. "See you tonight?"
"Me too," Steve said as he sat down, ruffling Peter's hair. "I'm sorry it's been a few days. They've been keeping us pretty busy at the base lately, so—"
"Nah, 'cause hardly anyone is," said Bucky. "But apparently Сэм can if the moon is full and Mercury is in retrograde, or some shit like that, and then everybody's gotta hear all about it for the next three weeks."
And then, just a couple of months before Tony turned twenty and only six months after the death of his mother, Mr Jarvis died, passing away peacefully in his sleep.
Phillips scoffed, banging his palm on the desk. "I wish I could tell you no, Tony, but I can't. Every single damn time that I bring up even the possibility of a ceasefire or trying to begin some peace negotiations I get shot down. There's just no way that O'Brien or any of his lackeys are interested in anything that has to do with peace, so… yeah. I'm afraid this is the only way it's ever gonna happen."
"As long as it's okay with him it's okay with me, buddy," Tony murmured. He pressed a kiss to Peter's temple, wishing so badly that he could somehow make all of this just go away already.
"Yes, I see," Thor murmured. "Well, then it would appear that Loki's bag of tricks has truly run out."
“Eh, I’m thinking it’s about time for you to get to bed, buddy,” Tony said.  “It’s after eleven already, and—”
"Dad, I really don't think that now's the time to be going swimming…" Peter muttered. His frozen fingers were still clutching the ship, his arm shaking as he tried to rip the mask from his face. "I can't—I can't—I need to breathe!"
"Oh, that's good," Steve breathed. "That's—that's really good. I—" He dipped his head to kiss Tony, nearly crying in relief when Tony returned the kiss with vigor. "So when would you like to go?"
"Good work, guys, we're heading in," Steve answered. "Sam, have Redwing continue circling above while we're inside the structure."
Instead of answering, Steve drew Tony closer, placing him squarely in his lap and capturing his lips again. His arms wound around Tony's waist, pressing him against him as Tony's hands flew to Steve's hair, holding his head in place.
Peter’s already pale cheeks paled even more, his throat bobbing as he swallowed.  “You mean, you think he might be hurt?  Or—or—?”
Tony grinned, with Steve's grin matching his. "That's our boy," said Tony. "He's been making me proud since day one."
Dad instantly smiled. "Ah, he's good, bud," he said. "He's… it's kinda funny, you know? I mean the guy looks like the epitome of every single Air Corps stereotype that exists and then some, but in reality he's nothing like any of 'em. And the fact that he's drop-dead gorgeous doesn't hurt at all."
Tony rolled his eyes, then grabbed Steve's face in his hands, planting a very loud, very sloppy, and very exaggerated kiss right on his lips that almost caused him to drop the tablet.
"Just a bit," Steve said with a laugh, tugging gently on Tony's shoulders. "C'mere. I wanna kiss you."
"Ah, three," answered Steve. "One by myself, one with Peter, and one with Tony, about twenty minutes ago."
“Yep.  It’ll do,” Peter said happily.  He tipped his head against Steve’s shoulder, the massive ice cream sundae he’d ordered for dessert apparently forgotten.  “This is the happiest night, isn’t it, Papa?”
"Yes, sir," replied JARVIS as a target symbol appeared on Tony's HUD, highlighting a spot about two-thirds of the way across. "I am reading an electromagnetic spike at this location."
Scott crossed his arms, looking rather sheepish. "Um… no, of course not. Not a time machine. More like a—"
"Pete?" Dad yelled as he flew overhead again, with Uncle James not too far behind. "Pete, you stand down now, okay? There's only two or three of these bastards left and we've got 'em!"
"I'm just saying. Just 'cause were both in relationships now doesn't mean that we can't still hang out," Ned continued. "I mean, we could even go on a double-date sometime, I'm sure Betty and Gwen wouldn't mind."
he thought as he scanned the vast plain, grinning as he watched Hulk leap from a pile of twisted debris and land right on top of at least ten of the ugly warg-like things. Behind him, sparking portals still hovered in the air as more and more people poured onto the battlefield. Many were Asgardians, based on the insignias on their medieval-like uniforms and Uncle Thor's friend Valkyrie, who was leading them, while others seemed to be wizards like Dr Strange, dressed in monk-like robes and holding their magical bright golden shields clutched in their hands as they formed a line behind them. A line that was quickly joined by about a hundred of King T'Challa's Wakandan warriors.
"Well, yeah, I know it's not perfect or anything," Peter said, rather sheepishly. "But we probably won't be allowed to take pictures once we get there, so—"
As soon as the ring was in place, Steve curled his fingers into his palm. The shiny, silver-coloured metal with a star and stripes design felt a bit foreign against his skin, but Steve knew it wouldn't be long before he was used to it.
Arriving back inside their tiny walkup, Steve watched as Little Steve helped Ma unpack the groceries before retreating to his bed to open his own package, once again running his palm across the crisp sketchbook cover like it was something to be treasured.
Politics, unfortunately, seemed to be proceeding as usual following the roundup of HYDRA's forces within the U.S. government, something that both disappointed and worried Tony. And Steve as well.
Steve chuckled, showing that dimple again as he took a bite of his steak, and it was all Tony could do to not try and drag him off to the men's room right then and there. He didn't know if it was the fact that it was their anniversary dinner or what, but Steve was looking so incredibly gorgeous that evening in his perfectly tailored navy blue pinstripe suit that Tony could barely take his eyes off him, much less try and keep his hands to himself.
"Okay, but what do you mean JARVIS couldn't tell them what the drone fired at? Didn't the video archive show anything?"
"Yeah, it does," agreed Bucky. "Kinda almost makes me wanna take a shot at those goddamn Meridians every once in a while. Let them see what it's like for a change."
Steve barked out a laugh, his fingers tightening around Tony's. "I'm sure I could arrange for something like that," he said as he shot Tony a look that was pure smouldering intensity. "As soon as Peter goes to bed tonight, okay?"
"I do," Steve whispered, tightening his arm around Tony's waist. He trailed his fingertips up Tony's abdomen to his chest, circling the arc reactor, the soft blue glow reflecting off of the silky ivory sheets. There were still plenty of nights when his dreams haunted him, when Tony's bright blue light dulled to grey before disappearing completely, and he cried out in anguish.
Peter grinned, attempting a nonchalant shrug. "Well… maybe. I'm sure having you as a dad didn't hurt too much in that area."
And then, Tony and Peter, the two people Steve loved more than anything, walked out of his store, and out of his life.
my own, and—" He broke off then, suppressing a hard shudder as he recalled the burn of the Aminacin drug flowing into his veins as various nonsensical words were repeatedly chanted around him. He still couldn't remember all that much of being brought to the bunker or the battle that followed, mainly just bits and pieces of things, but Papa had told him that Obie and Killian's ultimate goal had been to convert Peter into another Winter Soldier, and that they had very nearly managed to do it.
“JARVIS says he can’t pick up any signals, Cap,” Tony cuts in.  He swoops lower, pausing at about shoulder height.  “So unless he’s missing something, which just doesn't happen, then I don't see what we’ve got to worry about.”
"You guys just can't keep your hands off each other, can you," he said, that evil/ mischievous gleam in his eyes that Steve knew drove Tony bonkers. "It's like watching one of those stupid-ass rom-coms on a continuous loop. I mean, aren't you getting tired of each other yet?"
Satisfied with his mental image, Steve opened his eyes and proceeded to spend the next fifty-six minutes sketching a picture of Tony Stark’s face, nearly cursing at his alarm when it went off to end the hour when he hadn't managed to get the crinkles around Tony’s left eye exactly right.
Peter shrugged. "I guess just go inside? It's not like anyone could hear the doorbell anyway over all the music."
"Guys, it's Rumlow," Steve said as he got to his feet, managing to slide underneath Rumlow's next tank shot just in time. "I've got him in my sights."
“I did it,” Papa said, panting like he often did after his morning runs.  He sniffed as he lifted Dad’s hand, cradling it against his face.  “Oh God, Tony, I really did it!”
“And now you're thinking that those rifles combined with these bullets are being sent to Sokovia?” Peter asked.
"Your Highness," Steve said as he reached for the king's hand, which T'Challa proudly took. "It is very nice to see you again."
Pushing himself up from his chair, Tony hurried out of the Control Room and out towards the barracks, catching the front door to the building just as someone was coming out. Then he raced down the hall to Steve's—
"I think we should ask Bucky, see what he says," Steve finally said. "He may not want the entire team watching while we try and trigger him, so… if he says no, then we'll just tell Peter no."
"Yeah, but that's because he couldn't tolerate anyone talking smack about the people he cared about." Bucky leaned forward, lowering his voice. "I'm not saying anything specific, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to have a day off more than once every couple of months? Maybe even be able to keep our lights on at night? Sam and I talk about that stuff all the time."
"Yeah, okay," said Tony. "I've got a suit stashed in the SI jet anyway, and a spot in there for Rhodey's new suit. We can make it as incognito as possible."
"I know that already, Papa," Peter said evenly. "But it doesn't really matter anymore, does it? I'm here now."
"Tony?" Steve said as his eyes fluttered open, narrowing again as he took Tony in. "Sweetheart, are you all right?"
"Hmph, patient," Tony muttered. "Like that 'patient' isn't the very same grandson that he didn't even give a shit about six months ago."
“B-but, Daddy,” he said in a shaky voice, biting down hard on his trembling lower lip.  “What—what’re we gonna do?  We can’t—we can’t just leave Steve there all alone.  He—he’s not—Dad, he's not okay.  He’s not okay all by himself, in that tiny little place.  He needs us.”
"All right, we have a go!" Howard called out to the technicians. Steve gulped as people started criss-crossing the room, completing their last-minute preparations. After a final double-check of his ventilator settings, Sharon stepped back from Peter's side, giving Steve an affirmative nod.
"Barnes! Rogers! Is there some sort of problem that I'm not aware of?" Phillips suddenly yelled from across the hangar. Steve's heart gave a flip as he saw Anthony standing next to him, attempting to look anywhere besides directly at Steve.
"Yeah, I thought it was weird too, but Phillips has always been kind of a weird old bat anyway, so I guess I shouldn't be too shocked," said Dad. "It's not the strangest thing that he's ever done."
"So you're saying those Chitauri bastards were using this Mind Stone to control him?" asked Clint. Clint's jaw was tight and his fists clenched, no doubt remembering the horror he went through while under Loki's influence.
"Steve," he heard, flinching at the soft, tentative tone of the voice he had feared he might never hear again. "Honey, it's okay. I'm here."
Steve shifted on his feet, crossing his arms. "Two of our guests searched Thanos out a few months ago."
"It's okay, Tony, I can drive you both to the hospital," Colonel Rhodes said as he suddenly appeared next to them. Steve apparently
Because he wasn't, damnit. In his mind, he had already proven multiple times that he could be just as much of a real Avengers teammate as the twins were, if only his dads would give him the chance. Aside from the programming and coding expertise that allowed him to do things like discover the location of HYDRA's invisible bunker, he was doing awesome during the team's weekend training sessions, and even managed to web Papa to the ceiling of the Compound's three-story training dome a couple weeks ago, forcing Dad to have to retrieve him. And yet, every single time Peter even attempted to suggest that he was ready for more, he was immediately shot down.
"I don't know, sweetheart," Steve answered, so thick and low that it forced Tony to abandon all pretense of trying to be angry. His face crumpled as he traced Steve's cheek on the screen, right through a smear of dusty grime. "We were just sitting there talking, and suddenly all hell broke loose."
"Hey, hot stuff," Tony murmured as he picked up Steve's sketchpad, setting it down on the nearby table before crawling onto the chair next to him. Steve curled his arm around Tony's shoulders and pulled him close, burying his nose into his husband's hair, slightly mussed from the sea breeze but still as soft as ever.
"No!" Peter cried, the pathetic sound piercing Tony's heart like a shiv. "My name is Peter Stark-Rogers! I'm fifteen years old! I live in Avengers' Tower, and you can't have me! I won't let you!"
"Yeah," Lang said softly. "Um… thanks." He got to his feet, looking so downtrodden and defeated that Tony felt a sharp pang of remorse. While he was still pretty pissed that Lang—and Pym as well—had been arrogant enough to believe that they could break into a Stark home, he could understand Lang's desperation in wanting to see his child that had led to him agreeing to perform yet another criminal act. If Tony had ever found himself in a similar situation with Peter's mother—if she'd ever even bothered to show her face again after he was born—there would've been no lengths that he wouldn't have gone to in order to see Peter again. Even if it had meant having to beg, borrow, or steal, Tony would've done it.
"Only Peter Stark, Anthony Stark, and Howard Stark have been given permission to alter my matrix at this time, sir," answered JARVIS.
There was a pause as Steve's words filtered through everyone's minds. There was no longer any doubt about it. He had just outlined the steps of a full-on coup.
"Come in?" he said, grimacing at how weak he sounded. He cleared his throat, pushing himself up to a sitting position as Uncle Bucky stepped through the door.
"Oh, Christ, you know how much I love that giddy optimism of yours," Tony rushed out. "But honey, as much as I might want to, I can't promise anything until I get a good look at what Lang's brought us. 'Cause if it's based on what Hank Pym's been up to, then… well… there's no telling how messed up it is."
And for someone who had long-ago sworn off ever falling in love or having a family, it was very, very unnerving.
“Yeah, J, I’m fine!” Tony practically squeaked.  “I just…”  He drew in a slow, deep breath, pressing his palm to his chest.  It wouldn’t do to get ahead of himself here.
"You said we could wait somewhere nearby, once we drop him off?" Steve finally said, sounding very much like a little boy instead of the over six-feet tall, strong, strapping man that he was.
"Yeah. Once it's all over." He sniffed as he looked at Steve, his eyes flicking to the portrait in Steve's hand. "It's been so long. So long since I've seen him like this, and I—I'd almost forgotten what he was like."
And now here he was, not only trading jabs with said pilots, but about to marry another. The pilot who not only saved their planet, he also completely stole Tony's heart.
"Oh, shit!" Rhodey exclaimed as one of Hammer's suits started to lift off from the floor. "Tony, whatever you're gonna do you better do it now, 'cause I'm pretty sure we're out of time!"
Steve’s life, one that he had tried so hard to mould to his own perfect standards and had then failed so miserably, was finally starting to fall into place.  He was in love with the most beautiful man in the world, he had his very own bookstore, something he’d dreamt about ever since he was a scrawny kid growing up in Brooklyn, and the sweetest boy who had ever been born was now calling him, “Papa”.
"Tell him Steve will be out in a minute, J," interrupted Tony. He shot Steve a rather pointed look. "'Cause I'm
good to hear, Phoenix One," Tony said. He checked over his datapad, breathing out another small sigh of relief when he saw that Barnes and Carol had emerged as well, and that all three aircraft had assumed their calculated orbital positions. "All three orbits look good from here."
"All right," Natasha said with a sigh. "From what we've been able to ascertain, most of the damage was limited to the main SHIELD building. The residence was only minimally damaged, just a few broken windows, really, and our training dome wasn't damaged at all."
Scott sucked in a deep breath. "I came out here to tell you that time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a good way to navigate it."
"Uhh, thanks," James said with a playful frown. "And yeah, I don't envy me either. But the people deserve to know exactly how they've been lied to for the last twenty-eight years."
Tony smiled, his gorgeous brown eyes sparkling behind his glasses as he curled his fingers over his microphone.
As soon as the door closed behind him Peter huffed out a puff of air, followed directly by a hard, junky cough that led right into a full-on coughing fit. He shoved his face into his elbow, swallowing against the awful tickle in his throat as he tried to take deep, even breaths. He really didn't feel like triggering any of his monitors at the moment.
Three seconds later Sam Wilson appeared next to Clint, looking like he'd just returned from a hard run.
"Well, yeah, but I think a lot of that was him missing us," Tony said gently. "I've seen how he gets when you've been on missions without me, and he can get pretty grumpy. Add that on top of school and another growth spurt, and you've got one moody kid."
A flash of sympathy shot through Steve. He supposed if his own father had carried as much notoriety as Tony's then he wouldn't particularly like his last name either.
"Here, bud," Dad said as he tore out the pages of code, handing the notebook back to him. "You get some sleep now, yeah? I'll bring you another notebook next time we come."
Dad had actually taken the news about the HYDRA files a lot better than Peter thought he would. The fact that Peter had been almost inconsolable when he finally confessed probably helped his case quite a bit, but once Dad recovered from his initial shock and looked over what he had decrypted, he agreed to allow Peter to keep working on the files as long as he promised to share everything that he found with the rest of the team.
"That's what our readings are telling us down here too, honey," said Tony. "Carol's first satellite should deploy in about sixteen minutes."
"Oh, hell yeah. You know I just love when your ears turn that lovely shade of bright pink," Bucky replied through a mouthful of bread. He waggled his eyebrows, chuckling as Steve spread a generous amount of butter across a roll. "Besides, what's the big deal? Not like anyone's gonna look at you and want to mess with you anyway."
The realisation that JARVIS was offline—and the reason for it—suddenly hit Tony, and he paused his steps, trying to stamp down the uneasiness bubbling up from his gut. The ship had passed through the atmospheric barrier in the middle of his last conversation with Steve, before he could verify that Peter had safely returned to the Tower, and while he knew without a doubt that Steve would ensure Peter was safe before he and the team left for Wakanda, Tony couldn't help but worry about leaving Peter alone in the city with only George Stacy and the drones to guard him.
Blinking, Peter dragged his eyes away from the clock and settled in on studying Gwen's gorgeous hair draped across her shoulders, and the way the various shades of blonde caught the sunlight streaming in through the classroom windows. She smelled faintly of lavender and jasmine, and that combined with her bright blue sweater that perfectly complimented her striking green eyes, and, well… it was like Peter felt drunk every single time he looked at her.
Which either meant that some enemy of the United States had somehow managed to do an end-around every single intelligence source on the planet and secretly come up with new space-faring weapons technology, or it was the Chitauri.
"No, don't think that was it," Peter answered. "No one here thinks it was the space aliens anyway. Or at least not the same ones."
"Tony…" Steve said, dropping his chin to his chest when Tony tilted his head, giving him his best rendition of Peter's puppy-dog eyes. "All right, but I don't think I'll be able to get any sleep. Not with…"
"Um… for me?" she asked, taken aback. She swiped at her eyes, red-rimmed and puffy. "Oh no, Captain, I'm not here to ask you for anything. I just—well… I just wanted to see how Mr Stark was doing."
"Okay, that's enough," Steve muttered as he raced towards the flagpole on the far side of his course, knocking it with his palm as he ran by. Bucky had once held many of the same fears as Steve, something he had confessed to Steve back when he realised he was starting to fall for Sam. Bucky had always enjoyed going out on dates, even when they were kids, but it hadn't been until Sam came along that he'd felt like he could actually see himself sharing his whole life with someone.
Not that Tony minds getting a good look at Steve’s chest, of course, or any other part of him.  Especially since the thigh-length shorts he’s wearing leave absolutely nothing to the imagination.
“Yes,” Steve says, immediately grunting in frustration.  “I mean, no.  Or… I mean, nothing bad, anyway.  I met with the Starks, and we agreed that I’m going to start coaching the boy.  He’s only thirteen, but I’m pretty sure that in a couple of years, most of USA Swimming is going to know his name.”
"No, it is highly unlikely that any of you humans would have survived an encounter with Hela," said Uncle Thor. "That was in fact the main reason for my silence." He picked up his refilled glass of lemonade glass, downing its contents in three large gulps before getting to his feet. "And with that, I am afraid that I must be off. Without my hammer I am travelling a bit slower than usual, and if I leave Loki and Valkyrie alone together for too long I run the risk of no longer having a brother by the time I return."
"No, he doesn't like it," Steve said with a sigh. "I'm starting to think we shouldn't've let him start training with us. I think it's been giving him false hope."
"God, baby, you're just so fucking gorgeous!" Tony rasped, his strokes already losing their rhythm. "I wanna see you let go for me!"
"Yeah, maybe, but it wasn't an unforgivable lie," said Peter. "Or at least I don't think it was. And I know he loves you, Dad. You should see his face light up whenever he talks about you, it's so cheesy! He gets all googly-eyed and stuff… and so do you when you talk about him. It's written all over your face whenever you even say his name, so don't you be thinking this is all one-sided or anything. I've seen it from both of you."
"Well… yeah," Peter said carefully. "That's what they do when people are out after curfew, Grandpa. You know that."
“I am aware of that, Tony,” Fury said, far too nonchalantly for Tony’s taste.  “And before you ask, yes, I am also aware that Rumlow has missed three scheduled check-ins, since you saw fit to hack into SHIELD’s computer systems early this morning.”
"Any of these could end your friend's life in an instant," said the alien as he turned to look at Tony, his Voldemort-like face twisting in anger as Tony armed his repulsors.
“I am so glad you asked me that, Mr Chairman.”  Tony smiled as he pulled up the specs of Stark Industries newest tablet design, one that Tony had no doubt would revolutionise the industry and cause far fewer casualties than any of the missiles he used to design.
And he did. Tony loved Steve more than he'd ever thought he was capable of loving anyone besides his son, and that was why he had to protect him, no matter what.
“Now, now, you don't need to be giving me any attitude, Tony, I’m in a good mood here,” Obie said.  Tony gritted his teeth at the fake-hurt in Obie’s voice.  He’d always hated all that manipulative bullshit.
"Mmm, I'm not sure if that's any better," Tony grumbled. He actually liked Peter's girlfriend, especially since it was obvious that she adored him, but being the daughter of a deputy police chief, Gwen Stacy probably had access to plenty of information that wasn't readily available to just the average citizen, and the last thing that Tony needed was Peter finding stuff out secondhand.
, the complete lack of another viable option, that was almost worse than the need for the serum itself. They only had one shot, and if it failed…
I am really looking forward to hearing what you guys think!  I’ll admit my confidence is a bit shaky, I’m pretty sure I had twice as many kudos on Pieces at this point in the story, so if you’re enjoying this story and haven’t left me a kudos yet, I’d really appreciate it if you did!  And comments are always appreciated.  Questions, theories, I love them all!  I really love discussing my stories, so please, even if it’s just an emoji or keysmash, I’d love to hear what you’re thinking!
"They're just gonna wind up in the same place anyway," Steve muttered as he raised his fists and took his first swing at the second bag, biting back a curse as he heard another one of his knuckles snap, sending a fresh bolt of burning hot pain ratcheting up his arm. He immediately punched again, and again, and again, finally sending the bag sailing towards the wall, where it landed directly on top of the first. Without missing a beat, Steve stepped sideways to the third bag, swinging his fists so fast that sweat began flying off his forehead and nose, mixing in with the blood from his busted-up knuckles and leaving a sort of avant-garde splotchy mess across the skin of the bag.
Tony let out a heavy sigh, burying his nose into his son’s soft curls.  “Yeah, I know you don't.  I shouldn’t’ve said that.”
"Yeah… well… we went to get Chinese food after practise," Ned said, clearing his throat. "So anyway, have you started on that new project for Government yet?"
"Steve, I've had better nightmares," Natasha said softly. "But we can't give up now. I really think that—"
"Gotcha," Tony said as he dropped four pellets into the tank, chuckling when the fish shot up so quickly up from the bottom that he ended up zooming right past them. The fish quickly turned, attacking the first pellet so voraciously that Tony heard an audible
"No, I'm—" he started, tightening his grip on Tony's shoulder as he drew in another deep breath. Peter was okay. Tony was okay, and now he was okay. It had only been a bad dream.
Natasha was right, though. If they, the Avengers, couldn't hold on to hope, how could they expect anyone else to keep holding on?
"Huh?" Dad said, as if he'd just realised that Peter was there. "Oh, yeah, bud, I'm fine. Just… thinking."
“Oh, nah,” Tony replied.  “There's no building in New York that's more secure than this Tower, and since your store’s only a few blocks away, Pete’ll be just fine.  I trust him.  He’s a good kid.”
Tony's brown eyes were so troubled as they locked with Steve's that his heart gave a painful lurch. "Yeah, honey, okay. Tell me what's going on."
"Well, I was working with pretty limited resources, so you're right about that," said Tony. "But seriously, buddy, if I constantly judged myself on stuff that I did when I was sixteen, well… let's just say that you probably wouldn't be here, 'cause I wouldn't be here either."
"Mine couldn't stand him," Ma finished. She curled her bent fingers around Steve's arm. "And they were wrong. Just like I was."
"Tony," he said, gritting his teeth as one of the nurses finally peeled the destroyed glove from his right hand. "Tony, please, don't let Peter see me like this. I can't—I don't want him to see me like this."
At the mention of Peter, Tony sat bolt upright in his chair, nearly knocking over his water glass in his attempt to bring it to his lips, trying to hide the sneer he desperately wanted to toss right at Davis's face. He was so angry that he could feel the blood rushing past his ears, feel the sweat dripping down his back beneath his undershirt.
Steve dropped his chin to his chest. "Oh, you know Tony. He just automatically assumes that everything's his fault until proven otherwise. Which is usually impossible."
"Just a holding facility," Bartlett said. He handed Tony a business card, pointing to a phone number. "You can call that number on Monday to arrange for—"
"I—" Steve started, then stopped, gulping as he looked towards the centre of the lake, his panic spiking when there was still no sign of Peter or Tony.
