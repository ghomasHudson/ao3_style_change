Steve nodded, unsure if he dug himself a bigger hole for himself. He vaguely remembered the date on the article was from August 28th of this year, too early for it to be settled. “The case hasn’t reached a verdict, it’s still ongoing.”
Steve nodded. He poured some milk and sugar and as Steve mixed his coffee, Tony noticed that his back was slowly relaxing itself. Steve turned around to lean against the corner of the L-shaped island counter. Both Tony and Clint watched Steve drink his coffee.  It was like watching a puppy encounter a new food its owner dropped on the floor for them. Steve’s eyes widen slightly as he drank then coughed while setting the cup down.
“Looks like we survived,” Bruce said to Steve. “Good defense, by the way.”
Concerning the previous barbecue, what Clint said did conflict his thought process. Tony didn’t love Steve. Sure, his heart would race whenever he was around Steve and yes, he does like spending his free time with Steve, and maybe he stares at Steve a bit too much, but Steve is a very attractive person, even a straight man couldn’t deny that. He’s just a man who enjoys Steve’s company, just like any rational person would. Besides, they were friends and its natural for a friend to want to plan their friend’s birthday party. He would do the same with the other Avengers if they hadn’t had a birthday party in over 60 years.
Tony dipped his head to capture Steve’s lips. Steve kissed back with the same hard pressed excitement as Tony. His hips went at a slow and steady pace. He wanted to bring out every beautiful moans from Steve’s soft lips. Tony increased his pace a bit, each thrust filling Steve to the brim. Their bodies were pressed together and the skin on skin contact sent exhilarating shocks throughout their bodies. The grinding of skin on skin, the steadily growing pace of Tony’s hips was enough to bring them both to a climax. They stayed in an embrace as they let the temporary euphoria from their climax dissipate. Tony slipped out of Steve’s arms and collapsed next to him, chest still heaving. A smile crossed his face when he saw Steve’s content face.
"If they can't see your eyes, they can't know who you are," Tony simply replied. He pointed to the motorcycle. "We're taking that?"
“Why are you late?”
“Yeah, it’s kind of a cop out,” Tony admitted.
“What?”
“Sorry, I just got off the waitlist yesterday and didn’t get the reading until this morning,” Steve answered truthfully. While semi-truthfully since he didn’t find out about the reading until 2 minutes ago. Fury’s cold expression didn’t budge. He was stone faced at Steve’s pathetic excuse. Steve’s eyes went to his laptop then back to Fury to answer the question as best as he could, “Allegedly, Carina Tate’s intent was to kill her boss.”
“They aren’t real, Thor,” Tony shot back.
“Someone tell me what happened to Mr. Tivan, Anthony Stark.”
Tony shrugged, not able to agree with that statement. He chugged a good half of his coffee before motioning for Clint to refill.
Thor loudly shushed everyone, getting a brunch of funny looks from his teammates. “The movie is playing, it is rude to talk during a performance, you know?”
Tony rubbed his temple. His eyes burned from the bright light emitting from the screen. He shut his eyes and rubbed them too.
“Look next to you. The person you sat next to will be your partner for the rest of the year,” Mrs. Larsen said, earning a mixed of groans and relieved faces from the class.
“Steve Rogers, you’re the only one left.”
“Come on, everyone wants a stripper for their birthday.”
Steve shrugged. “I don’t know, I’ve only been here for a semester. Long enough to know some of the small things going on.”
“Sounds like a great guy."
Steve didn’t expect to find the classroom this packed. He knew the class was nearly full when he signed up, but this was crazy. He managed to squeeze through some of his fellow classmates and get to the front row. Fortunately for Steve, there was an open seat near the center. Steve plotted himself down on the seat. He flashed a smile to the red haired woman sitting next to him.
The student next to Steve stood up, holding onto his notebook. Steve stopped reading and looked up at Bruce, startled by the movement.
“Coffee?” Clint quipped, holding up the kettle.
"And what occurred when Mr. Tivan ingested the aspirin, you, Bruce Banner."
“The lights are still on, sir.”
“So how did you like the movie?” Tony asked.
“The second movie is better,” grumbled Clint.
“Clint made this?” Steve questioned, taking his sit.
“You sure? Because you and Nat do it all the time.”
“Really?” Steve looked at him shocked. “You’ve lived in NYC for how long and you’ve never walked across the bridge?”
“That’s what money can do,” he sipped from his mug, “buy the best goddamn coffee in the world.”
“Great,” he muttered. He opened his eyes and stared at the screen. His eyes rescanned the blueprint of the upgraded foot pulsers. He swiped to get full 360 view of the pulsers. He made one minor change to the design and swiped it away.
“Mr. Stark wanted to me to wish you a happy birthday. He wants you to meet him in the living room.”
Tony Stark never believed in love at first sight. The idea of automatically liking someone the first time you meet them didn't make sense in Tony’s mind, but he didn’t expect to be attracted to Steve Rogers. Near the end of junior year, Tony’s guidance counselor said he needed to take at least one Visual and Performing Arts class in order to graduate next year. The guidance counselor gave Tony three options: band, theater or art. Playing any type of instrument was ruined for Tony ever since his father forced him to learn the piano. Tony still flinched whenever he walked near or heard a piano. Theater sounded like it wouldn’t be enjoyable and Tony wanted to have at least some fun with the class so he settled with art. Tony
The door locked click.
“Unprepared?”
The rest of the presentations went in a blur for Steve, only perking up whenever a student’s defense matches his so he could cross it out. As more students went, the more Steve’s defense list grew smaller and smaller. There were some highlights Steve’s paid attention to.
Afterwards, Steve showered. This was the longest he has stayed in the tower. Tony’s charm was slowly influencing him yet he didn’t mind. He enjoys Tony’s company. The more they spend time together, the more Steve’s preconceived opinion of Tony is challenged. Tony is not as self absorbed and arrogant as Steve originally believed. He’s actually caring, intelligent and Steve has gotten used to Tony’s sarcastic humor to find it funny. One thing Steve could say is that Howard made one hell of a kid.
Steve and Tony walked side by side on the path. For the first time, Tony is hanging out with Steve and it doesn’t have anything to do with SHIELD or Avengers Tower. Maybe they will go from work buddies to actual friends.
“Oh god no. Pepper can do that,” Tony answered as he flashed a cocky grin. He glanced over to Steve, who flashed him a smile as well.
“Jarvis, what time is it?”
Tony watched as Steve left the classroom. With Steve gone, Tony was the only one left in the classroom. He slumped down in his chair and released a long needed sigh. He pinched his nose and shook his head. “Shit,” he whispered. Tony decided to sit up and breath, “
Tony shrugged. He has grown up with media attention surrounding him, it shouldn’t phase him at this stage of his life anyway more.
“I can introduce myself, Phil,” Maria chided, pushing herself off the stairs and moved closer to Phil.
Tony scrunched up his face. “Gross, but I must respect your wishes. I’ll add it on the list.”
“You know this is my first time ever walking on the Brooklyn Bridge,” Tony confessed.
“Steve, I love you, but please don’t come in,” Bruce begged. “A lot of things here can explode and break easily without proper care.”
“Steve,” she replied back. Her eyes turned back to the screen “So, your birthday is coming up. How old are you going to be? 95?”
“What?”
They’re work buddies, they know that. Steve knows it. Tony definitely knows it. They’re work buddies, not friends. Tony doesn’t even believe they’ve crossed the friendship line in the six weeks they’ve been working together. They acknowledge their mutual respect for one another, but that’s as far as their relationship goes. Tony thought that when the Avengers moved in the newly rebuilt Avengers Tower, that
“I am,” Clint said proudly. He took a seat by the the kitchen island. “I am the master on the grill.”
Tony reached for lube and condom while Steve kept the same exhilarating pace with his hand. He set the items aside, now putting all his focus on the man below him. After all the rubbing, he was painfully hard and he knows Steve is too. He peeled off his shirt, Steve did the same with his. He muttered a curse seeing Steve’s heavily toned muscles. For a moment, he stopped straddling Steve and Steve whimpered at the lost of touch. Steve was making it really hard for Tony to control himself. Their pants were now on the floor and their underwear joined them two seconds later.
Steve Rogers scolded himself for not going on a school tour before deciding to go to Chester Phillips. Holding a map of the school’s campus and wearing a backpack stuffed with notebooks and heavy textbooks, basically screamed “HELLO, I AM A NEW STUDENT”.  Steve realized he made another mistake. Bucky told him to go to explore the campus a day before his classes started, and he didn’t listen.
The door unlocked. Tony scolded himself for what torture he is forcing himself to go through.
Tony rolled his eyes playfully.
Tony sighed as he succumbed to Steve’s pleas. “Fine.”
“It’s ninety- 28, I’ll be turning 28.”
"Good. So we established the actus reas, what about the mens rea?" There’s a pause as Fury searches for a name to call on next. “Steve Rogers."
Tony pulled out a bottle. “Beer?”
When Steve walked into the living room the movie was already playing. The sitting arrangement looked the same as last time, Thor at the end, Clint and Natasha next to each other and a gap between Bruce and Tony. He already knew where to sit. “What are you guys watching?"
Steve smiled. “Good.”
Steve looked down again and pity was all Tony could feel at the moment. He could tell the man was struggling to keep his emotion in check, but not even that perfect face prevent something from slipping. Tony noticed a bench.
“Bucky and I used to hang out here all the time.” Steve glanced over to the road. “There were less cars though.”
Steve smiled at Tony. “Very.”
“Tony Stark,” he began. “I believe you are first.”
“You never told me what movie you want to see next,” Tony said, after drinking half the bottle.
Her eyes went to him. “Tony is planning your party?”
“Is that why you leave?” Tony asked.
Clint waved his hand from behind the couch. “Yep! He woke me up early for this.”
“Oh?”
“I don’t trust his purchases that’s why,” Tony said matter-of-factly.
Tony grabbed Steve’s wrist, the latter’s eyes shot up. “You sure?” Steve answered with a nod and a grunt, the grinding still continued and Tony started to feel delirious with heat. Tony kept cursing in his head as this was everything he wanted, but he didn’t expect to happen so soon, maybe 3 months into their relationship, but, right now Steve’s eager grinding is clear indicator that Steve doesn't care about waiting . “Uh, Jarvis! Lock the door!”
“Sir, Mister Rogers is approaching your room,” Jarvis announced.
“I understand. I see why everyone was panicking earlier." Bruce nodded along. Awkward silence took over once more. Steve spoke first, "Hey, I'm grabbing some food, either take out or pizza. I was wondering if you wanted to relax for a bit?"
“Your time in the ice says differently.”
“How do you do it, Cap?” The words escaped his mouth before he realized it.
“Jesus, Cap,” Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “How are you okay being here? You’re what? 67 years away from 1945. You’re in a whole new century with new people, new technology,
Out of impulse, he glanced over to Steve, who was now laughing and smiling with Natasha. His mind was conflicted, but he isn’t going to give Clint the satisfaction of confirming his suspicions.
The party guest included the Avengers, Rhodey and Hill. Intimate, just what Steve wanted. There was food, lots of it. Most of the food came from a catering company, but Clint grilled the burgers and baked his cake. The party went on successfully. Steve profusely thanked everyone for coming to his birthday party, especially Tony for planning the party. Everyone mingled, drank and ate. Later, they cut the cake. The cake design didn’t shy away from the Fourth of July look because of course Tony would.
In a second, everyone rushed to their seats, everyone clamored down as the professor walked in. A bald African-American man with a black eyepatch entered the classroom, carrying a black briefcase.
Steve’s cocked his head in confusion as he walked by the couch. “What’s going on?”
On the first day, Tony was anxious. He didn’t know anyone taking art since everyone he interacted with, took it during their underclassmen years. Tony was the last student to come in, much to the teacher’s dismay.
“You really are old.”
Steve nodded, his lips pursed in a pout. “Alright.”
“We have ketchup and mustard, sir.”
Steve stared at Tony’s lips and he fantasized what it would be like to kiss him. He caught himself biting his own lips in response and his face turned red in embarrassment.
“Oh no, I had the option, I liked America better though.”
A student in the front row raised her hand.
Steve finally, after fumbling with the buckle, removed Tony’s belt. He tossed it aside then slipped his hand down Tony’s underwear.
“Just because I’m Russian doesn’t mean I like vodka,” Natasha called out from behind the couch.
Steve furrowed his eyebrows. “Tony, I don’t understand what you mean.”
“Pancakes,” Clint repeated. He started to get up, but noticed something odd. He pointed to the extra cup on the table. “Did Steve come here?”
“Its the mortals take on what the future will look like,” Thor exclaimed. “Very bleak and violent.”
She peered her head over the couch. “What brand is it?”
“Well what were you’re suggestion?”
“At the Brooklyn Bridge,” Steve answer. He wore a sheepish grin. “I thought you were some guy who was all talk and no action, but that night, you…subverted my expectations. How about you?”
“There were two of them?” Steve questioned.
“Part of it. Also a bad habit from college.”
“Turn on the a/c, all the way up,” Tony demanded. He closed his eyes. Frustration took over. He was getting all hot and bothered over hand holding, hand holding for god’s sake, how pathetic could he be? Steve didn’t even follow through on what it meant so it had to mean nothing. He felt a lump grow in his throat. “Jarvis?”
Tony collapsed on his bed. His face was burning, actually his whole body felt as if it was on fire. He brought his hand to his face, reminiscing Steve’s hand on his. They touched pinkies for god sake! He cursed in his head. His chest won’t stop pounding.
“Lead the way, Cap.”
“I care.”
Steve set down his mug. “What?”
“You okay, Cap?” Clint asked, confused at whatever the hell that reaction was.
“Steve you are literally the living embodiment of everything that is supposed to be great about America.” Tony motioned Steve to follow him.
As time edged closer to the start of class, more students entered the classroom. The noise level increased, but not too loud that Steve couldn’t hear his own thoughts. He tilted his head up to see the red haired woman and her friend taking their seats.
For a moment Tony’s heart sunk. He hated hearing his last name. Whenever realize who he was, everyone becomes weary of him, like they just came across the presence of God himself. Tony knew his family’s name always caused him to be associated with his father’s success and industry.
“You’re correct Mr. Rogers.” Relief washed over Steve as Fury started to walk down the stairs.
“Is that a bad thing?”
“You wanna sit?” Tony pointed to the bench.
“I want it to be modest and small. I’m not a fan of huge celebrations, I know a shocker for you,” Steve teased. He sliced up the fruits and slipped it from the cutting board and into the blender.
“For all of you to be in my class, you all must not have any morals,” the professor began as he made his way to the front of the class. He turned around once he reached the desk and set the briefcase on the desk. He smiled. “Good, because that’s exactly what you need to in order to be a good defense lawyer. I’m Professor Nicholas Fury, but everyone calls me Fury. This is criminal law 101 or what I like to call,” Professor Fury started to write on the whiteboard. He set the marker down and turn around. “How to get away with murder.”
“I do not have money.”
“I’ve heard a lot of things about you,” Steve pointed out.
“Are you insinuating something, Romanoff?”
Later during the week, Natasha suggested a movie night for the team. Everyone except for Steve, who was absent at the time, agreed Fridays will be movie night. First, Tony would gather everyone’s movie suggestions then have Jarvis pick two movies from the list, and by Thursday night everybody votes on which movie will be played the next day. Today, Mad Max won. Bruce and Clint took the initiative to buy snacks for everyone. Natasha prepared the living area while Tony set up the movie on the screen. Thor sulked on the couch after being told he isn’t allowed to bring Asgardian beer for movie night because 1) no one drinks at the movie theater and 2) no one wants to die tonight.
“It’s Mad Max,” Bruce answered properly. “With Mel Gibson.”
“No. Sit,” Fury ordered. Steve hesitated then slowly sat down.
“Tony Stark,” Tony corrected, a grin tugged at his lips. “Tate allegedly switched his medication with an aspirin that Tivan is allergic to.”
“Well not my birthday.”
“Tony, no.”
As the day goes by, Tony and Steve’s bond grow stronger by the day. Tony noticed that Steve stays inside the tower more often. He would stay longer in the kitchen and have breakfast with the rest of the Avengers. He learned that Clint is a great cook, Thor is kind of a caffeine addict, Bruce somehow looks both well rested and tired at all times and that Natasha is scary without her coffee.
Steve chuckled and Tony’s heart skipped a beat. “I may be old, but I know how to have fun.”
“You do have hamburger buns in the pantry, sir.”
“I can imagine,” Tony said, but except he
Steve placed the towel on on the counter. He noticed the clock. It was a little after midnight, not too late for them to hang out. “Hey Tony, do you want to…join me on the balcony?”
Steve complied and they both sat together. Neither of them spoke, instead embraced their surroundings. The stars were outshined by the New York City lights, but the skyline was still beautiful. Sea salt emitted from the ocean and they could here the faint movement of water. Peaceful is the only word Tony can describe it. After the battle with Loki in New York, they deserve it, the city, the Avengers, him. He hopes Steve knows he deserves it as well.
“Thanks, Jarvis.”
Tony noticed Steve’s hesitation. There was an adrift look on his face as Steve stared at his coffee mug.
Steve shook his head vigorously. “I’m not drunk, Tony. Tipsy? Yes, but not drunk and I know what I want and what I want is you, right now!”
Tony left his room and headed to Steve’s room. The door was close. Light peeked through the bottom of the door. He knocked.
“Should I start making breakfast?”
“Happy birthday, Mr. America.”
“Great!” Tony clasped his hands. “I still have some beer, lots of aged old wine- oh vodka! Anyone here likes vodka? Nat?”
“Lovingly? No, our stares are our own secret coded language.” He swallowed the last bit of his burger. “Hey, if you like Steve, there’s nothing wrong with it. I mean, lately you two have been hanging out a lot, which is good for team bonding, but I’ve noticed you’ve been pretty accommodating to Steve.”
"Do you like Steve?"
“You’ll be going first. Rogers, on the other hand, will be going last.” Steve frowned,
Steve sipped his water to fight back the urge to laugh.
“Mr. Stark is in the living room with the other Avengers.”
“Yeah, and you’re in my seat,” the man standing in front of him said.
“Welcome class to period 12 art class,” the teacher began. “I’m Mrs. Larsen and I’ll tell you what I have planned for the year...”
Tony was taken aback. “Me?”
Steve reminded himself.
“The Commonwealth v. Carina Tate was a case of attempted murder by the defendant Carina Tate. Ms. Tate worked as an assistant to the victim, Taneleer Tivan,” Clint explained. Steve recognized that voice, but couldn’t quite place where.
Tony grinned back. "
On the couch the arrangement went like this: Clint and Natasha sat at the edge with Natasha’s legs draped over Clint’s lap, Thor sat at the other end, Tony and Bruce sat in the middle with a gap between them. The empty space between Tony and Bruce distracted Tony from the movie. His eyes kept wandering from the screen. He watched Thor’s odd reactions more than the movie itself. Tony leaned over to grab a handful of popcorn and shoved it into his mouth. While going in for another handful, in comes the Star-Spangled man himself.
“It’s just breakfast. Now eat it before the whipped cream melt.”
Steve stretched his arms and yawned. Time to celebrate his 67th birthday.
Tony leaned in and whispered, “Looks like we got in trouble by the fun police.” Steve erupted with laughter.
“Could you not get it printed in my name?”
Clint grabbed himself a patty. With a mouthful of food, he pointed out, “Staring lovingly at each other is not what friends do."
Later that night, Steve decided to hammer down on his studying. Papers and index cards were spread across his bed, some fell onto his floor. His laptop was on the reading provided by Professor Fury. Steve chewed the butt of his pencil, staring hard at his notebook. So far, he has only came up with ten defenses, half he found online from previous homicide cases. He pulled down his laptop and scrolled through the reading for the 12th time of the night.
Fury spoke, catching all the students’ attention. “The trial starts in two days. Tomorrow, I’m giving you all the chance to present a defense for the defendant. Stark?”
"Steve and Tony, who would of thought?" Bruce said.
“Jarvis, is Cap still awake?”
“Jarvis, can you start the coffee maker?”
Steve set his laptop down next to along with his notebook. He rubbed his temple, feeling a pulsating ache starting. Day one of class and Steve was already struggling. He needed to write at least 100 defense claims to make up for being the last to present. He couldn't risk embarrassing himself again in class. Steve didn't care about joining Professor Fury's team, only succeeding in class. If he failed, he wouldn't near the end of it from Bucky.
“Do we have ice cream?”
"Congratulations, friends! I knew this would eventually happen, took longer than I expected in my opinion,” Thor said. “Will you two be getting married some time in the future?”
"If only Bucky was here," Steve whispered. He stared at his phone which laid on his bedside table. He reached for his phone. No new messages. None from Bucky.
“A semester, huh? Explains why I’ve never seen you before. Where you originally from?”
“Barton,” Steve greeted.
“How are you a year younger than me?”
Half the period goes by until Mrs. Larsen finishes talking. Quickly, Tony shoved his phone into his pocket.
“I do come with great ideas,” Tony shot back. Instead of leaning against the counter, Tony sat down on one of the stools.
Steve flushed in embarrassment when he imagined a picture of himself kissing Tony on the hypothetical newspaper he concocted. Tony wouldn’t kiss him, he would never kiss him because he’s straight and they are friends. Male friends don’t date each other, that’s the rule. The embarrassment was replaced with sadness.
“Thank you.”
“Sorry, can’t hear you, walking away,” he shouted as he walked away from the group and towards Clint. Tony fixed himself another burger as Clint finished the last batch of burgers. Through chews, Tony complimented Clint, “Good turkey burger.”
“Stark planned a great birthday,” Thor stated.
“Are you ready for the next part?” Tony asked.
“Small and modest,” Tony repeated, matching the same smile as Steve.
Tony laughed despite the absurdity of all the events that they’ve faced. “Me neither. Terrorists I can handle, but a giant alien army led by a angsty god is not what I imagined to ever happen to me.”
Clint frowned at the kettle. “Only one cup left. Nat’s going to be mad.”
“Gladly.”
“And I didn’t think Captain goddamn America could be anything other than straight. You’re going to get all the conservatives mad, you know?”
“Fine, an hour.” Tony looked away from Clint and made eye contact with Steve. He smiled at him and Tony had to turn away to prevent an early heart attack.
Wanting to spark up conversation, Tony asked, “So why the Brooklyn bridge?”
“It’s currently 68 degrees, sir.”
Once Steve found his name on the list, he started his way to his seat when someone called out, “Guys, he’s coming!”
He changed into his sleepwear then exited his bedroom. His mind wandered to Tony. He hasn’t seen him since he entered the training simulator.
Steve pulled him in again. They kissed, some long, some quick pecks. All the build up sexual tension inside of them boiled over to the point it couldn’t contain itself much longer. It fueled the passion of their kisses. The long kisses were hard and demanding, desperate to hold the bond between the two as if it would be the worst thing in the world if they part. Their quick pecks were soft, lips barely touching.
Tony still had that smirk on his face. Steve noticed that Tony likes to do a lot of hand gestures whenever he spoke.
Once everything was cleaned up, Steve followed Tony up to the balcony. They both sat on the lawn chairs placed out. Between the lawn chairs was a cooler.
Tony zoned her out. He pulled out his phone from his pocket and hid it underneath the table. He scrolled through his notifications. There was a couple of texts from Bruce, probably articles about the latest scientific discoveries, one from Nat, and the rest from the various games on his phone. He swiped right on Bruce’s text, clicked on the article and indulged himself on it.
“Thanks, for the party. I really enjoyed it. I think everyone else did too,” Steve thanked. His blues eyes looked directly at Tony.
Someone in the front stood up. Steve hoped he could multitask eavesdropping and reading.
“Father said...he said Alpha’s don’t want another Alpha’s pup. He said that with lions, the Alpha will
“You miss him?” he asked as she smiled at him.
"One's in his lab and the other went to pick up the food." He looked back to his love, smiling as he saw him settle a giggling Miles on his shoulders. He then heard footsteps behind him, not bothering to turn around as he felt his Dad kiss the top of his head.
She literally keeled over, clutching her stomach as she continued laughing, unable to see their Dad had started as well. She heard the faint, “language,” from Pop but could hear laughter in his voice too. She stood up straight to turn to Peter to offer her condolences, but only laughed harder as he was really, truly glaring angrily at back at her.
“Nah, just long,” he offered as he stood up and stretched.
He hadn't seen Bucky in five years. Tony, surprisingly, was the one who suggested it to the super soldier when he first brought up the vacation idea. Bucky was living in Wakanda and Tony suggested visiting the country and introducing him to Emerson and Miles.
“Hey Pops.”
“Can someone please tell me what the actual fuck is happening?” Tony asked before being reprimanded by his youngest/oldest.
He coughed and took a step back, waving the air in front of him with his metal hand.
As gently as possible, he brought the toddler up into his arms while laying his brother down on the couch. The man was exhausted and kept sleeping as Joey quietly sat in Steve’s arms, the teen moving some books out of the way so his brother could lie more comfortably.
as those two and I will make you more bankrupt than you already are. I have friends in high places too, Stone. I’ll make sure your useless body ends up in a ditch.”
When she woke, the first thing her mind registered was the smell. It was from a cologne of a man she had thought had died. Wished had died. She blinks her eyes awake, feeling the restraints against her hands as she looks around the small room she was being kept in.
"Behave Omega, one of those looked awfully paddle-shaped," Steve teased right back, pinching the Omega's side and getting a giggle out of him.
"Daddy! Look how tall I am!" Miles shouted as the father walked around to stand below the two.
“Harley...do you know that woman?” he asked the pup who was frozen with fear. Steve stole a glance back at the group, anger spiking his scent when the woman touched Tony’s shoulder.
He wasn't returning his calls or texts, which could mean he was busy, he was in danger, or what it was more often than not - he'd lost his phone.
“Babe? You dressed?” he heard his husband ask, surprised he hadn’t just burst in like he normally does. He finished getting dressed before opening the door into their bedroom.
she said hesitantly. Steve felt his chest burn with anger and betrayal as he realized it wasn’t just bad luck. It was
Steve did his best to keep his eyes on the phone, not wanting to see the rejection or disappointed look from the pup.
He felt his phone vibrate throughout the night and opted to not check it, glad for the distraction as Sam continued explaining to him
"Right, why I skipped school. Well, I found out...that I have a little brother," she finished looking away at the two as the fathers looked at each other in confusion.
“The world needs Spiderman, have you not seen the graffiti in the streets? And...and you were...always my favorite,” looking every bit of the child that he was. It made Peter feel even worse. He let another moment pass between them before sighing heavily.
It was Joey, flailing on the ground with her eyes wide open. Tony recognized the symptoms of a seizure, cuddling the boy close as he cried, frightened over his new friend. He watched Steve help move her on her side, grabbing a nearby pillow to place under her head.
Tony turned to his confused husband and couldn’t help kissing his lips, easing a little of the tension off Steve’s shoulders. “That song was sexual, was she sayi–” Steve was cut off by Tony kissing him again.
"Excuse me?" she called to the woman talking to her dads. She carefully lifted the tuxedo kitten above her head to show her and ask, "is this one a boy or a girl?" Her fathers laughed at her as the lady smiled and replied, "boy."
"Because he's fuck-face's kid," she replied bitterly as Tony felt a dagger go through his heart at his own words. His mouth gaped open as he tried to formulate an appropriate response for that.
He could easily see himself having this life, but there was this little nagging voice in the back of Tony's head that had gotten to Steve. What it would mean for a little black boy to be raised by two white gay dads. If they were the right men for the job. If it would mean a lifetime of heartache for a boy who already experienced too much in five short years.
"And where might my youngest be?" he asked Jarvis as he stretched out a yawn, getting up to use the restroom.
Bucky had called to tell him he’d meet them at the store to help them with the groceries, since he had a truck.
“You know what would really wake me up?” Tony asked as he leaned down to finally get the kiss he was looking for. He felt Steve smile against his lips, large hands roaming up and down his back until they settled on his hips.
She sought her out for a reason.
“Yeah Pepper! You’re not being very nice right now,” Mr. Stark said with a pout as he stumbled to sit by his friend’s side; suddenly aware of the blonde in front of him.
“Are you okay, Tony?” Daci asked in confusion, shifting closer to sit next to him on the bathroom floor.
"If Clint's okay with that, I think we can do that," Bucky said, already knowing the answer and moving back to the chair so the two can snuggle together.
“Plus this will serve as payback for those ‘toys’ in there,” Steve added with a smug grin as he pulled back, grabbing some wipes before making his way back to the kids. Tony followed, still in somewhat of a daze as he watched Steve help clean both Rhodey and Morgan.
“That wasn’t because of you, I’m sorry. I’m well aware you like me for my dick,” Clint teased, needing to see a smile on his boyfriend’s face again. When it worked, Clint continued. “I’m also aware that you stood up for me cause you...love me and not because you think I’m too weak to fend for myself. It’s just...those fuckers at school wouldn’t shut up...I mean...I don’t even consider it an insult! Have you met Nat? She’s a chick and she’s the biggest badass I know.” James laughed aloud, immediately nodding his head in agreement before the brunette’s gaze turned towards the pup - who had tired himself out and was asleep on his new bed.
“Hmm, so your Pop tanned your behind?” he asked her sympathetically. She actually chuckled at that, nodding while reaching one hand back to subconsciously rub her bottom.
"Change my pj's," the boy replied, muffled a little by Tony's shoulder. The father kissed the boy's cheek as he stood up, hefting the boy on his hip as he walked the two over to the dresser.
“This is Steve. Steve, this is Rhodey and this little monkey is Harley. Say hi little monkey.”
“Of course, I’ve got homework to do anyway,” he said with a hopefully normal voice as he almost tripped over himself to grab his backpack and go to his room.
They were the last ones to board, the jet quickly taking off as Bucky realized Natasha was the one flying it. Right...Clint had been injured. He ignored the sick feeling in his stomach and took a seat in the back and away from the others, cradling a sleeping Daci in his lap. Steve and Tony were seated together with the latter in the former’s hold, both fully conscious and seemingly uninjured as the Iron Man armor stood stoic by their side. He could see a shaky Dr. Banner looking Clint over as Thor sat near them. Natasha’s red hair was all he could see in the pilot’s seat as he did his best to clear his mind of the overwhelming guilt settling in his stomach.
“Pete?” he still asked skeptically as he turned back to Tony in bewilderment. It was then that Barnes and Bruce made their presence known, stepping into the hallway to greet the family currently their correct age.
And prayed this wasn’t what he thought it was.
“Because your relationship was an HR violation,” Stark answered for him. “And she was abusing the power dynamic.”
The goddamn King of Wakanda.
That left one.
Harley.
“No...I-”
She took a few deep breaths before shuffling the short distance to the elevator door. She turned when she heard footsteps, offering a small smile to her fathers; Pop sporting a hoodie and pajama bottoms.
“I don’t…I want to hear more about me and Xavy’s secret love affair,” Tony teased, laughing more when the poor kid grumbled in response. “Aw, honeybun don’t be like that, I thought what we had was special…”
Her terrible two’s hit three weeks before her actual birthday, making Steve wish he had some estranged cousin or uncle he could stay with for the next year – she was that bad.
Peter plopped himself down on the long stretch of couch to Em’s right, grabbing some blankets to make himself more comfy.
"Oh my sweet summer child," her Dad quickly retorted, "I know you didn't because you got your cooking skills from
“Lock down the lab and make a reservation for that Thai place at eight, got it?” he turned to look hopefully back at the skeptical super soldier.
“Uh huh,” the teen teased before letting him go. “And you,” she said as she pointed a finger at Steve, “don’t pretend you aren’t the secret brains of this operation. I see you over there making marble brownies…which I happen to know are your favorite…”
As he walked off the quinjet, Steve stretched his arms above his head and frowned at the popping sound coming from his joints.
“Would you like to go on a hike together?” he finally spit out. Steve raised a brow at him a moment before responding.
Then he stepped in, saved him, and took him under his wing. They started dating in middle school and have been inseparable ever since. Adopted a dog together about a year ago. It was obnoxious.
“You’re such a drama king,” his love whispered before kissing him slowly. He saw the two children had already vacated the room as the sounds of his friends followed them into the room. Steve nodded to them as he made his way to talk to their son.
“Steve, are you a virgin?”
“Okay my boys, be good and don’t let him eat too much candy.”
“We were thinking Peter,” Steve answered for them, just as the curious six month old reached over to inspect Tony’s bundle.
“Don’t listen to them Wade,” Emerson interrupted. “Once you seen them in footy pajamas, they’re not that intimidating.”
"Hey, sorry I’m a little late, our last patient was a little…difficult,” he said with a smile as he sat down and grabbed the menu.
Tony felt unwanted tears start spilling down his cheeks as a poorly timed smile appeared on his face.
“Daci, this is my oldest friend in the whole wide world, platypus. Platypus, this is Daci. She and her father moved into the tower recently.”
There was a little bit of tension in the air when the couple left, but then Clint fell out of his chair and everyone laughed at the silly man. Daci felt a yawn overtake her which caused her father to yawn as well.
“Is...is that okay?” she asked her brunette father, suddenly wondering if he didn’t like her calling Clint that. His expression softened immediately as he smiled and pulled her back into a hug.
“I actually met him before I met Peter, at the courthouse. He’s seems like a cool guy.”
“Good. In this together, then,” Steve said before leaning forward to kiss him. It was soft and chaste, the Alpha pulling back before cuddling the Omega close and resting his lips against his neck. It wasn’t quite near the gland, but it was close enough to send a shiver down Tony’s spine.
“Hello?”
“It’s alright. I’m an asshole when I drink, too.”
“Alright munchkins, be good for Uncle Clint and Uncle Bucky,” Tony said as he went to his boys to give them kisses as well.
Black Lives Matter, and if you don't agree, kindly fuck off.
She could almost ignore the pain from sitting on his muscular thighs; returning the embrace allowing her free flow of tears to continue as she hugged him like her life depended on it. He simply tightened his arms around her, the force of it actually popping her spine.
"Heimdall sent word you had fathered another child, so I came to Earth to meet him. Loki's with me because he's under what you mortals might call...house arrest?" Thor said as his brother rolled his eyes.
“You know…I didn’t really get to enjoy the view last time I was at your mansion…”
But it filled Tony’s heart with joy when he saw her practically back to her old ways. It got him wondering what she was like when she was younger, which inspired the woman to pull out some photo albums. One particular photo of a young Joe had Tony grinning from ear to ear, seeing the goofy face the man was making on a beach.
"Heck yes I am, I know how delicious this is I just also know what it does to the human body," he said as he helped Miles with his plate.
Xavier huffed out a laugh in response, composing himself when she threw a mock glare in his direction.
The two made eye contact again, holding gaze while Steve said, “we’re on our way Pete.”
is?” Joey asked in offense.
"Right, talk. So you wanna tell me why you're scared to raise an adorable black boy?" Tony spit a little of the coffee he had just sipped, should've known the man would jump right to the point. He looked up to an unimpressed Rhodes, who cut right through his bs.
“Alright, okay, yes. It happened. Let’s move on,” Sam said with a small smile, moving to collect the cards and grab another game.
“Yeah Pete, and just think; if they just came to life and were
“I’ll take her!” he said, startling the super soldier a little. Tony quickly made his way around the couch to sit next to his husband, making grabby hands at him saying “gimme my kid.”
“It doesn’t excuse driving drunk, Josephine. Nothing excuses driving drunk. You could’ve walked, or gotten a cab, or called anyone else. Including nine-one-one. I’m sorry that you were almost assaulted, but that does not excuse your actions,” he said slowly with his fists clenched.
“Just uh, don’t hurt my little brother,” Barney said seriously as Clint felt his cheeks blush in embarrassment, the air in the room suddenly changing. “Cause joking or not, I’ve killed more than enough people to classify as a serial killer. And I know how to make it look like an accident.”
“It was a stupid boy. He made fun of me for having one parent. I said I don’t have one parent, I have two and he said you don’t call your parents by their first name. I said Clint loves me more than his father loved him, cause his dad ran away from his family to be with his secretary. And then he started crying and told on me. But Clint I didn’t use my strength or my powers!” The snort it got from her blonde father caused her to look up at him in amusement.
“Okay, just making sure. I’m just…I’m sorry other people keep bringing up the name thing…”
“Well then, carry me to bed soldier,” Tony whispered, lifted up into the air the second that he finished his sentence, laughing as Steve raced the two to the bedroom.
“If you’re okay with it,” Steve began, “I’d like to see your back now.” She glanced at the blonde before giving another small nod. They don’t intend to hurt you. She stood up slowly, turned around and lifted her sweater up enough to reveal the scars. With her back turned to them, she couldn’t see their faces but did hear the small “oh, sweetheart” which she guessed came from Steve, since Tony loudly added a “holy fuck.” Embarrassed, she quickly put her sweater down before anything else could happen, turning around to sit on the bed again.
“I’ll probably be home before that, I just mostly want to go cause Xavier is going,” she explained honestly. Steve still looked like he was thinking it over for another moment before reluctantly nodding.
“Oh Tony, leave it to you to not follow tradition. That’s right, pup. I’m your father,” Ty said as he turned back to the boy, leaving Tony to reach over to squeeze Steve’s hand as he noticed the Alpha’s scent change to one of offended.
Emerson turned to Peter, “so, does this mean you want to be an Avenger?” The three men were frozen in place, that particular question hadn’t been asked aloud yet.
"Watch the attitude Thumper," the brunette spoke up only to see his husband cross his arms in disappointment. "Emerson, why did you skip school?" Tony finally asked her as he turned to face his daughter.
because he stood up for me against…against this fuck-head who tried to assault me…” she trailed off, clutching her arms around her stomach at the memory.
“You don’t know that,” he said, totally lying. She scoffed loudly, not believing him for a second as she rubbed her arm pointedly. They got into the doors and Steve felt his anger dangerously close to brimming over.
“Daddy?” Harley mumbled in Steve’s shoulder, face buried but a tiny hand reaching out for the Omega.
CLINT
Tears flooded his eyes as he searched the debris for...anything.
“If it’s any consolation,” his Pop said as he rejoined them, “your father does nothing but drive me crazy. But continue, Pete.”
They walked into the living to find Tony already there, apparently with the intention to surprise them. The tables quickly turned when the brunette saw his kids' new haircuts. Tony's eyes widened dramatically at the sight of the them, accepting the hug Miles gave him after climbing onto the genius' lap.
Two days before his thirtieth birthday and his friends were still trying to convince him to do something special about it. He had explained, numerous times, that he didn’t want to celebrate it and would rather just work through the day. They had taken it upon themselves to try and plan a party and even tried to get someone to cover Steve’s 24 hour shift that day – but he still refused.
“Obie?” Tony asked quietly, hating himself for not checking through the peephole first.
still
“When I told him that’d be stressful,” he said a little louder, trying to get his point across, “he said we should just hire a nanny!”
“Steve? Please don’t be too harsh on him. He was crying when I helped him into bed. I promise it didn’t trigger anything for me and I know he only did it because I wasn’t supposed to be here.”
Steve chose a quiet Italian restaurant that he hoped wouldn’t be crowded or draw any unwanted attention to Tony. He was already there waiting for Steve, having reserved a little booth in the back.
So he smiled brightly as he verbally heard his husband pout behind him when the two heard Joey approach the kitchen.
“Hey yourself, care to join me?” he said without moving from his lazy position, put still patting the spot next to him. She smiled but stopped herself again, looking around before asking.
The squirming increased the smacking intensity, which increased the leg kicking, which meant kicking off her shorts to god knows where.
And okay wait, maybe Tony had misheard. And his least favorite thing in this entire world were unhappy tears in Steve’s beautiful blue eyes. Even if he loved when he cursed, he didn’t like it when it was in anger or sadness. The knot in Tony’s stomach tightened.
“Does this happen more when you talk about things from your past?” Kate asked quietly.
(which...this just reaffirmed to Tony this blonde was his soulmate)
He can’t believe he’d forgotten to ask off work. He’d made sure he’d done it the last four years and couldn’t believe he’d forgot this year and was stuck at work as he tried to find someone to cover the rest of his shift.
Two weeks after Kimberly reappeared he was growing more impatient. After repeatedly assuring Steve he would handle it, the genius made his way to their daughter’s room as his husband opted to go for a run. Her attitude ever since her mother’s reappearance had gotten worse and tonight had been a breaking point. Steve had pried a little more about her mother over dinner and she retaliated with spiteful words. You could see it on her face she had immediately regretted it, but quickly left for her room before apologizing. Peter shared a look with his Dad before they both looked at Steve, whose face looked so hurt Tony felt his own heart ache.
“Yeah yeah, good to see you too, brat. Now move so I can properly meet this boyfriend of yours,” Barney grumbled out before standing up and extending a hand to James. He watched as the two shook hands, remaining on the floor playing with Lucky.
“I...ran into him in Europe. Had my lawyer draw up some papers in case Tiberius NoStones wanted to come back into your life and try to ruin it.”
“I snapped at Daci for getting her fired, told her she didn't make me happy...and Clint...I accused him and called him a...holy fuck,” Bucky choked out as he held his head in his hands and a swarm of emotions churned inside of him. He felt nauseous and more scrambled than the last time he’d gotten out of HYDRA’s hold. A hand he instantly recognized as Steve’s gripped his shoulder.
“Thank you,” she said as she gently placed the picture aside to throw herself in his arms. He accepted gratefully, feeling his own eyes get misty when she emphasized, “
“Tony? Babe is everything okay?” the Alpha asked, hand gently resting on his shoulder while the Omega furiously texted Ty for the sixth time.
“Hey! You can’t swat your Papa, he swats you,” he joked as he tossed her on the couch.
The Omega came back to the present when he heard Clint whine next to them.
“Yup, no, that’s...that’s fair kiddo. Sorry, just forget it. If anyone asks, it’s totally my fault I’m teaching a five year old how to shoot with a bow, okay? Let’s go shoot some arrows,” he said with a smile, standing up and pointing to the bows. She looked at him for another moment, trying to get used to his humor, before nodding her head in agreement.
“I think, Petey-pie, you meant to say she wasn’t there for
She interrupted the adorable moment with a serious question.
“Fine! Whatever you clearly don’t love me,” he tried being manipulative, but Tony was ignoring him now as the two waited for others to join them at lunch. The genius was too busy staring at his massive crush to pay any more attention to his dear friend.
"There didn't seem to be any witnesses..." his husband pointed out.
He’d have to talk to his dads about this when they got back.
There were numerous case files, police records, hospital exams, psychological evaluations dating as far back as her birth. She was taken from her father when she was eleven, mother died of an overdose at seven. Put into foster care where she was passed around like an unwanted burden. History of physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse…for fuck’s sake she was FIFTEEN. There were one or two arrest records for being a runaway and prostitution when she was thirteen, but both were reduced or redacted. He had gotten to the physical evidence portion of the report, pictures of her throughout the years bearing different scars and bruises. He couldn’t look away at the horror in front of him, didn’t notice someone had woken up and was watching him. Hadn’t noticed until he mumbled something along of the lines of “rip that fuckers balls off” and was interrupted by a sleepy voice beside him.
After some badass Cajun food made by Sam, Tony clinked his glass to get everyone’s attention.
“Yeah, I’m glad,” Tony said with a small smile, second guessing his so called ‘genius’ status.
“Like…” Tony tried to explain, secretly not wanting him to know that phrase. “Like an out from this marriage...from being a dad and a husband and an Avenger.” There. He did the adult thing and explained it, now if Steve would just -
“Has it been so long that you forgot what happens for making fun of my age?” he asked coyly as she suddenly blushed remembering.
“What? Steve never told me that!”
“It’s not a competition, Jo,” he said fondly as she smiled back at him.
“If you suggest a stuffed animal, I’m going to punch you in the face.”
All his friends were doing great.
Clint was rocking a sleek black suit, hair spiked up with a purple bowtie and matching cufflinks and purple hearing aid.
“No no, the deal was a new couch; we aren’t getting you presents because we love each other. Children should be happy their parents are happy!”
“I’m missing someone,” the brunette grumbled as he tried to sit up more. Joey closed her eyes at that, wondering if not for the first time if she should’ve stayed home for this.
Tony laughed loudly again, knowing she was only somewhat kidding.
“Just teasing you, darling. Do you want some tea? I could use some tea,” the brunette said as he walked directly back into the house, leaving the magazine on the ground. Steve grabbed it before following him, if nothing else to recycle it properly.
, he thought fondly to himself while shifting the boy in his arms, before being interrupted by the case worker.
She wanted her mom, who died four years earlier and left her with the devil himself. She didn’t care if she abandoned her, she was the only one who at least acted like she gave a damn. Not that Wendy didn’t, but she was already very skilled at not trusting people. She learned people only are nice when they want something from you and often times aren’t when you don’t give that to them.
“I…have we met?” she asked incredulously, wondering how lame it would be to literally pinch herself right now.
About an hour later the group heard footsteps, the three turning to see Joey walk in with Simba in her arms.
"I turned away for like two seconds," he said in his defense as he walked behind the couch, plopping the clothes in Helen's lap before moving to steal Sammy from Tony, cooing at the baby as she giggled in his arms.
Sorry Sam,” she said before turning to leave.
Her anger momentarily blocked her from noticing someone approaching her slowly before gently sitting next to her. Joey startled when the person touched her arm, turning sharply and wondering for a moment if she was actually dreaming.
She could’ve guessed her brother wanted to be like his parents, wanted to be a superhero and save the world…but she was also surprised to learn that it was also helping him with Wade. Apparently saving little old ladies helps with grief? If only she’d known sooner...
Skip the lecture and go straight for the belt.
When the woman grabbed his hand, Daci finally made her presence known. She rounded the corner and walked directly over to the suddenly surprised two. They separated from each other as Daci took her time to eye the woman up and down.
Tony pulled away after a moment, confusion written on his face.
"Yeah?" Tony asked, heart skipping a beat at hearing that from him for the first time.
“Huh,” Tony said, unable to think of anything else.
“It’s not funny,” Bucky said, trying to hide his smile.
Now though, the older blonde just teased him like most brothers do.
“Oh yeah, it’s been super fun raising a hormonal and angry teen these last few years…” they both shared a small laugh at that.
Her social worker (who was no longer her social worker) tried to make an argument against the new housing situation. It was fairly obvious the old man wasn’t a fan of the gay superheroes, shooting them dirty glances every chance he got. Peter sat back, glad to watch Emerson be quick to put him in his place.
“Of course! Clint, take this monkey,” her uncle said before handing the archer Harley and motioning Daci to follow him. Her nerves started getting to her as she followed her uncle into his bathroom and watched him fill up the water, although seeing the colors and foaming of bubbles squashed some of that.
"Why would you give a five year old an axe?" Steve asked as he inspected the very real weapon.
“This isn’t your fault, Buck. She was manipulating you,” Steve added. And he could’ve said more, but Bucky heard a ringing in his ears as the memory of what he said to both Daci and Clint came to the forefront of his mind.
“Mr. Stark, unless a judge can see you are in imminent danger, then we don’t have legal action to file another–”
“-your heartbeat is different. Not to mention your clear lack of training,” Daredevil said as he made his way out of the warehouse. Miles followed him, switching back and forth in his head between cursing this guy out and just leaving the situation entirely.
"My Harley!" Steve cried, grabbing Tony's attention again as the Alpha waded away from his brother with Harley in his arms. The tiny blonde pup was giggling in his father's arms as Steve made his way back over to him. "I got you, puppy. Now you're stuck with me forever!" Steve exclaimed before kissing the boy's cheeks, getting more giggles from him. Bucky joined them, wrapping his arms around his mate and kissing him.
“Ma!” the full grown teen yelped, hands moving to cover his face in embarrassment. Tony just laughed, feeling such a sense of warmth from those two.
“Of course, JARVIS will let you know when the party starts back up again,” Steve replied before the two men leaned towards each other and kissed. Daci watched them for a moment, sitting quietly while Steve returned, left with Peter and returned again. “So, Daci what do you want to do now?”
“Noooo,” she whined immediately, pudgy fingers trying to undo what he did. Steve simply smirked at his brother before grabbing his drawing pad once more.
"She's being modest for once, she was recently promoted to partner," Helen piped in before placing a kiss on her cheek.
“Don’t be so dramatic, Tony,” his husband chided as he cuddled her close.
“Goons are taken out. Tasha is helping Bruce back to the quinjet, no sign of Strucker. What’s the plan here?”
The brunette perked up at that, brows shooting up in surprise as if no one had asked him this before.
“If you start calling me Ashley, even in jest, I will gut check you.” He recognized she was joking, his heart hurting at hearing her try and make a joke of this.
“Hello love of my life.”
“Kid, are you talking about those ridges?” he asked with a smile as she squinted at him and nodded yes. “Yeah, that’s what fat feels like. Because your breasts are literally bags of fat, love.”
“I’m not under any kind of spell,” he growled in his own defense, watching as Stark held his phone to his ear and walked out of the room again.
“Like...Daddy?” her question brought tears to Clint’s eyes, confusing her further until he brought her back into his crushing embrace.
“You’re going to do the same thing you did when you were four, Master Tony. You shocked yourself when you were playing with some circuit boards and you picked yourself up and kept going. And you will do the same thing this time. You’re going to pick yourself up and persevere, my boy. Your parents are upset, but they love you and won’t let you go through this alone. Neither will Anna or I.” He stayed in his butler’s arms, crying his eyes out until he did the exact thing Jarvis said he would.
He was told to stay at home when his mom took Lacy back to Carolyn’s house to get her stuff after she’d kicked her out.
He was so incredibly glad for her timing. He who shall not be named had his publicist reach out to him for a possible ‘work collaboration’ earlier today, and though his best friend helped calm him down, his girl was the one who really helped him.
Barnes wasn’t that great!
The blonde shifted forward, Tony smiling as he leaned over to kiss him.
Her Dad sometimes would make jokes or opt for doing something on the tablet, never one to be comfortable in silence. Her Pop, on the other hand, was a talker. If you were in trouble, if he was proud of you, if you asked any questions, if you didn’t ask any questions and just wanted to watch TV in peace…
The exact words were something like, “I’m not a fucking damsel in distress.”
His brows shot up when he saw Clint on the bed, straightening his clothes. Buck’s gaze turned back to Rumlow with a little fury as the teen immediately tried to play it off.
“–because he couldn’t handle it. Handle you, at least all by himself. I tried to get you, but by then he had changed his mind…anyway, look I was thinking of treating us to a spa day–”
“Is that what this white stuff is?” Daci asked as she reached out to touch it.
“Early detection is key, you’ll be just fine Josephine,” Carolyn said before taking a bite of her summer salad.
He and his girlfriend lived near them and one day she went to their apartment to wait for her Dad to get off work.
His family probably didn't notice, or at least didn't see any difference then how he usually acted.
“I’m kissing all of your scars.”
how the prequels somehow ruined the sequels of whatever franchise he was talking about. He was glad Sam was his partner, only offering the man a “happy birthday” and paid for coffee. He nodded along and smiled until they got a call from dispatch.
“My own father doesn’t want me. Am I not good enough?” Harley choked out, further breaking the Alpha's heart.
Steve didn’t know what he was doing after graduation.
“So…how are we doing this?” the brunette asked, crossing his arms over his chest. Steve closed his eyes at that, willing himself to calm down; realizing he must’ve been sporting his ‘
Steve groaned internally before steeling himself to answer.
Pulling back with a sparkle in his eyes, holding up the rest of the chocolate.
“Seriously? You two?” Tony asked again with a frown. He sighed dramatically before continuing, counting off the reasons on his fingers.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t completely honest with you and I totally understand if this is like, a deal-breaker for you…” Steve rambled on, stopping when he saw Tony shaking his head.
There was momentary silence before heavy footsteps approached and the Hulk came into view.
“You bet your dumb ass it is,” she heard him say.
“So? Which one is your favorite?” Pete asked again, his daughter blushing with a smile before answering.
“Do you think it’s that time of the year?” Nat blatantly asked, getting a snort from Sam and Steve while the cuddle birds were still wrapped in their own world. It was fairly obvious the Omega would start his heat soon, since Clint was dramatic but not like this. Only Natasha had the balls to say it out loud.
“Yes I can,” he mumbled as he contemplated throwing the man off him. He had the strength to do so after recently growing past his big bro in both height and weight.
But she didn’t need to be within reach…
The teen eventually nodded in response, sitting up straighter when she realized she would finally be able to talk to someone about this.
.” The mention of Steve finally got the smile off Ty’s face, whose scent changed as well.
She was at the bookstore with Peter and Wade when she found the book on her namesake. She remembers asking Peter to get it for her, then…leaving? She closed her eyes tight, trying to concentrate.
Tony’s eyes widened as he watched Steve nervously walk over to the teen and hand over the treasure trove.
“I saw the pictures. I know what you look like after a seizure, baby. And I know you’re not dumb enough to drink at a school function, let alone with your worst enemy. None of it added up and…I know these last few months have been hard. But I do trust you. And I’m sorry I haven’t been better about that…I saw how scared you were when you first came in here…and after everything you’ve been through tonight…”
Emerson insisted on not wearing a dress, feeling like they had all already seen her in her pajamas at one point in time, and opted for some casual wear. The Avengers slowly began trickling in, greeting the newest addition with a small gift and warm hug. Her Pop thankfully took the presents to set aside, ushering everyone to sit in the big dining room. She was even able to finally meet King T’Challa (aka THE GODDAMN BLACK PANTHER, she’s a fan…to say the least) who had brought his sister along. Emerson couldn’t help but stare a little at Shuri throughout the evening, she was really pretty and really funny (especially when it was at Peter’s expense)
"Pat, thanks for having us! These are my kids I told you about - Emerson and Miles. I hear only great things about you from Sam," he said as the man ushered the family to the chairs in the corner of the shop. There was only a few other elderly man getting their hair cut, so they knew it'd be safe from anything that would take the attention away from his kids' excitement.
Needless to say, she was tired when she went to school the next day, unable to focus on her friend Xavier complaining about the latest Batman franchise.
He thought of all of this as he continued watching the group, doing his very best to stamp down his inner Alpha that wanted to go over there and ring that woman’s neck. Before he could push through the bond to get Tony’s attention, Stone noticed him.
“Well, I mean technically yes. But he got cleared so now it isn’t...unless of course Fury somehow found out they dated before that...but I don’t know kiddo why don’t we watch some cartoons or something?” Clint responded, using one hand to fumble for the television remote.
“If you’re finished,” she said pointedly while sitting up in defiance. He could see the pain behind her eyes, but was impressed with her initiative enough to raise his hands in surrender.
They waited for the elevator doors to close before starting their interrogation.
“Alright kiddos let’s go paint with Poppy!” Wade said as the three cheered and raced him to the door. Peter trailed behind, frowning at not feeling like himself lately. His mood did improve when he got inside, able to hear his parents greet his kids. Plus Miles was here, even if Emerson was staying with Aunt Nat and Uncle Buck for a week, he’d get some sibling time.
Gently knocking on the door, he let himself in and kept the door open. Harley was under his covers, evident by the lump on his bed.
“Eh, it was school. Mr. Jefferson was super nice to me today for some weird reason…” she said as she set Peter down to inspect what the blonde was doing.
So, the first week was...interesting.
“That’s Nat and Sam. The four of us were going to go out but I think all knotheads should stay here and think about what they’ve done,” Clint said as he walked to answer the door.
“Why do you ask?” Buck asked, looking at the television screen playing quietly.
Steve distracted her with her stuffed lion while Bucky put the cookies away and grabbed a wet wipe to clean her face.
“No, baby, no of course not!” he said as he picked his son up and hugged him close to his chest. He turned back to his husband, the man walking over to wrap his arms around both of them in added comfort.
While also making a note to himself to wear his glasses more often…
“…Strange…” Tony confirmed as his husband walked over to inspect the bottle as well. Peter decided that it was time to switch fathers, Tony trying not to groan as his son squeezed him in a tight hug.
“I don’t know, Stevie. We’ll find out when we get there, we’re not far from the hospital.” Steve had stopped listening, doing his best not to throw up from what he had just heard. His mate was hurt and their unborn pup…
I am well aware of. It’s kind of creepy…how similar y’all are. Not to mention your freakish clone mini terrorist –”
Steve was concerned that she didn't want a party because she didn't have many friends at school. But the brunette reminded them that Peter didn't either and turned out fine - even if he was in love with sergeant smart-ass. Who apparently was also being a dumb-ass and ignoring Peter the last few weeks? Months? He couldn't remember from their conversation - Peter had called just as Steve came out of the shower and he couldn't exactly remember.
“Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb,” she dragged out as she also added some tiny feet stomping. Steve turned to his brother. Bucky had his brows furrowed, not buying her act for a minute.
“No shit,” Howard muttered, condescending tone cutting through Tony like he was a small child again.
They could get through this.
He turned away from her for a moment, cleaning up in the kitchen before turning back and gawking at the mess she made.
“Shit,” Tony said in sympathy, “are you going to tell Joey that you know?” Steve absently rubbed his thumb over his husband’s cheek before responding.
Heart surgery.
But that was just wishful thinking.
“Love you Em,” the blonde called after her. He smiled at her “love ya too” she offered without turning back to them. He finally turned to his husband whose arms were still crossed as he smiled at their kid walking away.
“You’ve been drugged, Terminator. Lucky for you, I have a sorcerer friend who had an interesting proposal to counter the effects.”
“Speak of the devil,” he muttered as he looked up at Steve. “Do you mind if I take this?” he asked as the blonde smiled and nodded at him.
Most, since two of Kingpin’s men got away, and he quickly webbed off after them. He only found one and cornered him, but before he could do anything his senses told him there was a gun pointed at the back of his head.
She rolled her eyes fondly, laughing as he continued, “yeah, yeah it’s Joey.”
"Mhmm," she replied, clearly falling asleep. Tony followed Steve silently as they walked into her bedroom, preparing to tuck her in. He watched his love kiss her cheek before stepping back to give Tony room. The brunette leaned down, kissing her forehead and wishing that he could take her pain away. He knows she could have nightmares from this, quietly following his husband out before making a suggestion.
His Dad showed him the tablet, revealing a picture of a tiny newborn. “His niece was born this morning,” his Dad said as he smiled again at the picture.
“No, please,” she said, struggling with her contorted muscles from having her hands cuffed behind her. “Ask Officer Hill, I need a hospital.”
“I will in a minute. Too busy enjoying the show,” she said, nodding to the circus behind them. She watched Miles dip his toe in before he turned back to them with a smile.
Sure, having his own room for the first time in…ever…was nice, but he missed his big bro and baby niece. Even when said niece was a screaming lunatic…like today.
She couldn’t help but chuckle at that, staying in his embrace and officially exhausted from this evening.
“Are you guys talking about Emerson?” Peter asked as he hopped up on the counter near his dads. Both men turned to look at their son before nodding. “She’s made it a point of not having me over. At first I thought it was because literally everyone in my class wants to see the Tower, but she won’t let you guys drive her home. I think she doesn’t want anyone to know where she lives.”
He grabbed his spare key to unlock the door after knocking and waiting a few moments. When they heard screaming from behind the door, they decided to rush in.
“I appreciate that, Danvers. Glad platypus here finally dropped his balls and asked you out,” Tony smirked back while motioning to Rhodey, who just rolled his eyes at them. The coronation started taking place, grabbing their attention as they watched the nominees take the field.
“Hmm, well did he ever tell you he broke up with me once?” he asked. Peter sat up straighter at that, looking at Steve in disbelief. Steve smiled and nodded in confirmation before continuing.
They only ended up sleeping for the last thirty or so minutes before his alarm went off. After watching several home movies, they’d spent the rest of the night –
"Yeah, they said you'd never adopt me. That you'd show me off before throwing me to the streets," Miles finished his confession with a heart breaking wail. His hands moved to cover his face as he cried in agony. Her Pop instantly brought him back into his embrace as she felt her Dad shift one arm to rub his back in comfort.
“No, none of what happened was your fault. Except maybe not coming out to me –”
“You listen to me you pathetic piece of shit, if you ever come anywhere near me or my family ever again – and that especially includes
“Alright, well if you want to stay down here then I’ll stay with you. No kids allowed down here without adult supervision.” His foster son laughed at that before pointing a finger back at the older man.
“Uh huh,” she said just as skeptically with a small smile.
“That you’re a psycho?”
“He’s just!” the younger man grumbled before taking a bite of his burger. “Infuriating,” he said around the food in his mouth.
was the reason he was getting better?
“Oh, Aunt May! That’s adorable!” Tony said excitedly, clapping his hands together.
“What’s wrong with her?” Tony asked gently as he moved to sit next to the teen. She had stopped shaking and closed her eyes in exhaustion, chest heaving up and down.
Fury won over, as she reminded herself
“What was your bad dream about, Petey-pie?” the brunette asked as he started swaying the two back and forth.
“Don’t jinx it,” he said, meaning every word.
“Where are you and Daddy going, Papa?” Peter asked after climbing off Rhodey and running over to sit in Tony’s lap.
James, being the cheating motherfucking that he is, went straight to Clint’s tickle spot instead of being an adult and reached around to pinch his ass.
Someone who literally invited her to do it this afternoon.
“Rogers,” Fury called out before Steve could round the corner, “let me know if you need anything,” he said kindly, surprising the blonde.
“Um...pan-pansexual…” Bruce said, blushing and avoiding eye contact with Clint - who was desperately trying to make eye contact with him so he could tease him.
Her mind raced as the four men veered down at her, speaking another language as they started wringing their hands in excitement. One of the men stepped closer to her, smiling smugly as he eyed her up and down. She couldn't help it, she started trembling in fear.
Steve and Tony exchanged glances, concerned about their son as well as the sweet young girl they had gotten to know. “Tell her she’s welcome anytime,” Tony said before insisting on his Pop’s rule.
“Go take a nap with your Omega, Stevie. Nanny has this,” his Ma said from the couch, eyes not moving from watching the sleepy pup. Steve looked at his Ma before turning to his mate, who was smiling back at him. Silently he walked over to his Ma and pup, kissing the older Omega on the cheek before gently rubbing Peter’s cheek.
"You should've seen us thirty minutes ago," his husband teased back as Steve playfully flicked his love's ear.
Because right now, right here. He had the sexiest man alive on top of him, on his private beach, reassuring Tony that he loved him and wanted to be with him.
“Thanks Marcus,” she said to the man, throwing a smile his way while walking past him to go into her Dad’s extravagant office. He was leaning back in his chair, phone to his ear as he had his feet up on his desk. He turned and smiled at her as she walked in, waving her to come sit while he finished talking.
Their tiny daughter looked on the verge of tears again before finally speaking up and breaking their hearts.
It was on the eighth day that Tony woke up assuming he had gone deaf. He was...also well rested. The Omega jerked himself awake, sitting up in bed and rushing over to his son’s bassinet, only to find it empty.
“-I’m not
“Bruce is already wearing pants?” Daci wondered quietly, but loud enough for the red head to snap her attention to her. Daci felt fear for the slightest moment before Natasha burst out laughing. Which got Clint laughing, which almost always made Daci feel good - especially when she saw Bruce smile at whatever it meant. Her father had shook a little around her, telling Daci he laughed a little too.
He was meeting with Obadiah today, and Steve couldn’t focus on anything else. He really,
“Aren’t you going to say something? Lecture me or yell at me or…” she sputtered a little, utterly confused with the way this day was turning out.
“Jo, if you think Momma is family then why don’t you call her Momma?”
EMERSON
“Hey pup, not feeling too well?” Steve asked as he grabbed Harley’s backpack, reaching a hand out and trying not to take it too personally when Harley brushed past him.
"What do you mean you can't go? We've been planning this for months," he said to his boyfriend, who was packing his luggage like Peter but JUST informed him he had a different destination.
“Aha! I’ve got you now,” Buck growled before blowing a raspberry in Jackson’s neck, smiling when the boy shrieked in laughter.
“Kid, we’ve talked about this. There are going to be bad people in this world that hate me and Tony, that doesn’t mean you sock them in the jaw.”
"Is after breakfast okay?" she asked around devouring the tacos her Pop had barely handed her.
Tony looked back down at Joey, noting that his hospital gown was starting to get damp from her tears. He squeezed her a little tighter before bringing a hand up to card through her hair. He had known that this could’ve been a possibility, her not listening to Steve’s orders to go to May’s.
“Pete,” she whispered.
“You’ve got a deal. And may I say, you look pretty sexy with a beer in your hand,” he flirted.
“Jo, hey can you hear me?” Steve asked with concern as he pulled the blankets off her. She nodded to him in response, unable to articulate anything else. “Alright come on kiddo,” she heard him say as strong arms brought her out bed and into a solid chest. Her head lolled against his shoulder, barely conscious as she suddenly had to squint from the bright lights.
“No!” he screamed, tiny hand reaching out to stop the teen. Tears prickled in her eyes as the guilt reappeared in her stomach.
She took her face out of his neck long enough to answer, but still turned away unable to fully face him.
“I’m so sorry, baby,” the genius began, “I’m so sorry you’ve been carrying this guilt for so long. It wasn’t your fault. You were put in an impossible situation, baby girl. You had such a big heart that thought it was sparing her and in truth it was. None of this makes us love you any less…in fact I kind of feel like I love you more –”
“No, I called his cock ‘perfect,’ get your facts straight. I thought that’d be easier for a hetero…” Before Rhodey could retaliate, the pair heard tiny footsteps approaching.
"Happy birthday Emerson!!" he shouted as he continued jumping on her bed, careful to avoid jumping on the lump. She threw her covers back, grabbed her brother and pulled the giggling kid under the blankets with her. She tickled him as he tried to escape, their laughter barely muffled by the blankets. She finally relented when he asked nicely, the two catching their breaths under the covers.
If only that fucker would answer the phone.
He laughed fondly and continued watching her terrorize her other bath toys.
“God no, just my dumb ex the same age as me,” Tony said with a chuckle, which changed the sour smell coming from the Omega and made Steve’s inner Alpha purr with delight at the sound.
“That’s Mister Doctor Professor Red Condom, Esquire to you cockeye,” the masked man said…with a familiar voice.
“I’m his father, who the hell are you?” Howard growled out, stepping forward as Tony reflexively flinched back.
Tony took it reluctantly and immediately frowned when he saw the messages. He had several missed calls and messages from Howard.
“Do you,” he started. It was very risky question that took everything in him to ask, “want to sit with me?”
“Tony said he’s planning something, hopefully small and modest like I asked him to.”
their relationship would progress a little. Despite living in the same building, Steve and Tony rarely see each other. Tony can count the few times they were in the same room in Avengers Time on one hand. Usually, they cross paths in kitchen in the morning or in the living room sometime at night. Tony knows Steve leaves as soon as he wakes up. He has no idea how a man, 67 years away from the NYC he once knew, manage to spend the whole day out. But what does he care? They're just work buddies. So long as they work well together on missions then it shouldn't matter what happens off the field.
“Breakfast Club,” Tony answered, he pointed for emphasis. “All time classic. Oh and Back to the Future, the second one of course.”
was holding his hand out for Tony. Tony swallowed and shook Steve’s hand, a warm feeling gripping his stomach as he did.
Clint stared at him as if he had two heads.
“You’re up early,” Tony said. He grabbed his coffee mug, an iron man mug designed by a fan, and Clint poured him a cup.
Thor, who Steve remembered at the stairs of Fury’s house, came up with the defense that the doctor did the blood work too late for him to detect any aspirin in Mr. Tivan’s blood, therefore exonerating Ms. Tate from the crime. Natalia’s defense was that Mr. Tivan mistook the aspirin for his medication and that Mr. Tivan’s glasses weren’t on him when he took the aspirin. Clint’s, finally learning his name, defense was that Gina did put the pill on his desk, but she never intended to kill him, only scare him. Bruce went and instead of discussing a defense for their client, but how they could spin it to benefit the victim. He mentioned how he analyzed the background of jurors and most come from a low-income class similar to Ms. Tate. He theorized if they emphasize Ms. Tate’s background that it would swing juror’s opinion on her. When Bruce sat down, Steve immediately believed that Bruce definitely won that assignment challenge.
“It’s 7:12 am sir.”
Tony stirred in the sugar. “Pretty early.”
The only person who wasn't involved in planning movie night was Steve. Tony had barely seen Steve all week. He wasn’t sure if Steve wakes up early to avoid him or if he found someplace else to stay and only comes back if necessary. Frankly, Tony was disappointed that Steve hasn't come yet. He would love to see the old’s man reaction to modern movies. Eventually, Clint and Bruce returned. They all placed the snacks in bowls. Bruce placed the drinks on the table, along with the snack bowls. Tony gave Thor good ol’ American beer to cheer him up. Operation Movie Night is a go.
Giddiness swelled in Steve’s stomach. Steve smiled once they finally pulled apart. He was out of breath, so was Tony. Tony’s thumb dragged across Steve’s cheek, sending shivers down his spine.
“Thanks,” he mumbled.
“Yeah, me neither.”
“Cap?”
Steve smirked. He appreciated the thought put into the pancakes. “Definitely not small or modest.”
He snuck in a glance at Steve. He attempted to read Steve’s face. Steve looked…conflicted.   The heat radiating off the other man was enticing. He wondered if Steve’s lips are as soft as it looks.
Steve smiled. Tony grinned back.
Tony thought bitterly, ‘
They continued chatting and drinking beer. When Tony realized they’re having a bit too much, they called it a night. Steve slept with Tony on his mind.
"I can show you," Steve said, "but you have to go undercover. You okay with not being in the limelight?"
“But do come to us with answers, we appreciate that more,” Maria addressed the class. She gave Phil a warning glare who brushed it off.
"Uh,” he started, he fumbled with straightening his glasses. “Mr. Tivan went into an anaphylactic shock. His throat swell and his brain was deprived of oxygen for about 7 minutes before one if his assistants was able to resuscitate him."
“I know.”
“Congratulations to those who managed to keep your seat, you’ve all moved onto the next round,” Fury said. “Unfortunately, none of you beat my approach.”
“You buy the best coffee,” Clint told him.
Natalia stood up. “Since the verdict hasn’t been reached yet, will we be going back to the case?”
Steve stood up. He glanced down at his notebook, searching through the list of crossed out sentences for one not crossed out.
“No, is that an issue?” Steve challenged, his eyes looking at Tony with mischievousness that went straight to Tony’s groin.
“Mel Gibson? I’ve heard of him before,” Steve said.
After taking Steve’s recommendation in consideration, Tony did just that. He carefully placed his arms around Steve’s waist, their bodies a centimeter away from touching each other. Tony can feel the warmth crawling up his throat.
“Search up…” He sighed. “search up how to get over a friend.”
“Good job,” Bruce whispered to Steve.
“Typically.”
They sat behind everyone else. They waited eagerly for the fireworks to start. Tony told Steve fun facts about fireworks and the Macy’s company. The sound of exploding fireworks stole their attention. They sat in silence as the fireworks displayed went on. Red, blue, white, purple and green exploded across the pitch black sky of New York. Steve watched the fireworks display in awe. He had never seen such bursts of colors before and he was experiencing this event with Tony, the Tony he has a crush on.
Tony noticed they were reaching the end of their walk as he saw the top of Steve’s motorcycle.
Tony looked at him surprised. “Really? Isn’t it past your bedtime, old man?”
When the time for his official birthday was approaching, Steve changed into a semi formal outfit. 7 pm was the time Tony told him to arrive to balcony. When 7 pm hit, Steve went to the balcony. Just as Steve theorized, it was a barbecue. The party was decorated in red, white and blue party supplies such as balloons, tableware, napkins, and table covers. Tony really wants to hammer the “Steve is America” joke he teased about earlier.
“Yeah,” Steve admitted. He glanced over to Tony, who was currently chatting with Rhodey. Tony carried out what Steve asked for. He could have easily planned a party without consulting Steve or not throw a party for Steve, but he did. Tony has been…more than a great friend. Something triggered inside of Steve and he knew right then, he’s in love with Tony.
“Jarvis, what’s the temperature in here? I’m burning.”
He’s taken out of the moment when Steve start to speak.  “Things really has changed.”
He found himself on the balcony, his second favorite spot. He pulled the chair closer to the glass railings of the balcony. Something about observing the city below brought peace to his mind. Though, his conversation with Natasha didn’t leave his mind. Is his and Tony’s friendship viewed differently in other people’s minds? Steve acknowledged that they have been spending more time together, but he viewed it as a necessary teammate bonding. If the Avengers weren’t on friendly terms with one another, how could they safely protect the world if their petty differences interfered?
“Ah.” Neither said anything as both avoided making eye contact. "Hey, I’m sorry for ignoring you in class, I didn’t want any trouble on the first day of class.”
Steve blinked. “Mens rea?" He questioned. Everyone, including Fury was staring at him. He closed his laptop and stood up. "Right."
“I never seen you cook,” Steve retorted, a playful grin on his face that struck a chord in Tony’s heart.
Steve thought. Last movie night, he didn’t join them. Tony said he left everyone worried. He felt he owed it to everyone to join them this time.
“Oh the metal cans?” Thor cut in. “They are all in my stomach.”
“Brucie brought some candy,” Tony added. “I never saw Captain America eat candy before. Do you?”
Bruce looked at Tony. ”Why don’t you trust him?”
Steve swallowed the popcorn and reached out for a water bottle. “I don’t have a sweet tooth, but to make you happy…” He took one of the fun sized chocolate and ate it.
Tony looked at him impressed. “Wow, very anticlimactic.”
“Jarvis, brew more coffee please,” Tony ordered.
From behind, he heard Natalia say, “Clint, it’s too early to be an asshole.”
Depression. He couldn’t associate Captain America with depression.
“You ready?” Steve asked.
For a moment Steve didn’t say anything, but stared at the screen. “Sure.” Thor scooted over for Steve to sit. Tony felt a ping of sadness  “What movie is this?”
Steve‘s face heated up. “Thanks.”
“Me too.”
He heard knocking then Steve’s voice. “Tony? Can I come in?”
“Really Thor!? You couldn’t buy more?”
“Bucky,” Tony repeated. “He was your friend, right?”
Breakfast wasn’t the only thing Tony had planned. Tony told Steve there is another surprise out in the balcony. Steve already deuced what’s the surprise is, but he didn’t want to ruin Tony’s mood. Honestly, Steve likes seeing Tony happy. The glimmer in his eyes, the grin that exudes confidence, happy Tony is Steve’s favorite Tony.
Steve started the engine and they were off.
He turned his face away before Tony could noticed the color change. “When do the fireworks start?” Steve asked, avoiding the man’s gaze.
“Yeah, when’s the marriage?” Clint teased.
The next morning, Tony was well rested for the day ahead. He remembers he’s naked and there’s also a very naked Steve sleeping next to him. The memory of last night hit him. This isn’t the result of alcohol, he, Tony Stark, actually had sex with Steve Rogers. The sleeping man’s arm was draped over Tony’s waist. Tony slipped himself out of his grasps. He stared at Steve, the outline of his muscles, the soft lips he kissed last night and his long eyelashes that added to his attractiveness. He gave Steve a peck on his forehead before changing into new clothes. He carried the blissfulness of last night on his face. His cheeks were aching by how much he was smiling.
Tony mumbled back his own “good morning”. His eyes followed Steve as Steve prepared to make himself breakfast. The tight shirt really does nothing to cover Steve’s muscle, Tony noted, not that he minds. Steve sat next to Tony.
Steve smiled. “Small and modest.”
The next day, Steve arrived early to class. Only a couple of students, somewhere around 15-20 students, were in the classroom. They all probably had the same idea as Steve to arrive early so they could prepare for their presentation. Among the early students was Bruce.
He scrolled further down and removed the pencil from his mouth. He sighed.
“Okay class,” Professor Fury’s voice cut through the room and everyone immediately went silent and shuffled as fast as possible to their seats. Following behind Professor Fury was his two assistants, Phil Coulson and Maria Hill.
“I have to wait for it to thaw out,” Clint told him.
“We have ground turkey meat,” Clint shouted from the fridge. He pulled out two pounds of the ground turkey and placed it on the counter. “I can make a mean turkey burger.”
Tony groaned in exasperation. He swears feeding three genetically modified humans, a norse god and whatever the fuck Clint is is seriously draining their food supplies.
Tony had followed Steve into the kitchen. Steve grabbed a blender from underneath the cabinet, giving Tony a nice look of his… He darted his eyes to counter. Steve also grabbed some fruits.
Step 2: Introduce a new suspect
“Come in.”
Clint furrowed his eyebrows. He flipped the last burger on the plate. “For Steve’s birthday?”
“Please tell me you didn’t buy fireworks.”
“Like the banner?” Tony asked from behind.
“It’s only 7:45.”
His cheeks flushed. “No, I know what the mens rea is.”
Then an idea popped in his head. “Say…Clint, you think you can cook for us for Steve’s birthday.”
Tony looked at him with that contagious grin on his face. “You sure about that?"
“What about you?” Steve asked.
During their ride, Tony forgot how beautiful the city looked at night at ground level. He’s used to flying over the city, watching as the city that never sleeps continue to move. He’s been used to flying above the city that it eventually lost the charm it had, but this drive with Steve is slowly reminding him of it. Steve is quiet during the drive. As much as Tony wished Steve would talk, he figured it would be best to leave the Captain alone until they reached their destination. Tony decided to lean closer into Steve, tightening his embrace and rested his head on Steve’s shoulder. Steve smelled nice. Tony couldn’t describe the scent, but it was comforting. He was also soft -surprising for a muscular superhero. Warmth swelled in his chest and, shit, was he actually…? No, it’s just their shared body Tony had to rationalized. Tony quickly distracted himself by watching his surroundings.
“Yes, please.”
“Couldn’t find the art wing,” Tony replied simply.
“Thanks, yours is very creative compared to everyone else.”
The bell rang and half of the class already darted out of the classroom. Steve grabbed his books to put in his bag. Tony reached out his hand, but stopped and place his hand on the desk, pretending to check his watch. Steve stood up and Tony’s head shot up. Tony felt his face grew more and hotter as he stared at Steve.
“On it, sir.”
Tony just grinned then walked out of the classroom. Steve stared at Tony’s direction for a minute. He sighed and decided he should head to the library to study up on torts.
He clicked on the attachment and skimmed the article as fast as he could.
The teacher rolled her eyes and ordered him to sit. Among the bored-faced students, all the seats were taken, except one, right next to the blond haired boy he’s now infatuated with. Tony quickly moved to his seat. Steve sat next to him and across from them were two other students who barely paid Tony any attention.
“Thor only destroys things. Nat will give you the most scariest glare you’d ever seen. It appeared in my nightmare once,” Clint explained. He set the kettle back under the machine. The top propped open.
“I didn’t expect for things to go the way it did with Taneleer,” Carina confessed. “I was only supposed to be a temp since the woman before me was on maternal leave.”  She smiled faintly. “I…was in his office once when he kissed me. I didn’t find anything wrong since we were both single, but he was still my boss.” The smile disappeared, her youthful features now strained. “On my last day, after my lunch break, the paramedics came. I would never hurt him.”
“Yeah.”
Clint opened his mouth then closed it then opened it again, confusion written all over his face. “I guess?”
“He’s scarier in person,” muttered the man next to him.
Tony stared at Steve’s hand. Tony couldn’t believe that this
Steve gripped Tony’s collar and pulled him into a kiss. They heard whooping and hollering from the other Avengers. Steve smiled into the kiss and it didn’t falter when their lips separated. “Looks like we did,” Steve said.
“Tony?”
Delicately, he removed his fingers. Then he slipped on the condom and squirted more lube on his fingertips to prep Steve. Steve closed his eyes and allowed himself to immerse himself in the moment, feel the heat radiate off of Tony, feel each intoxicating touch by Tony that fills his chest with lust. He ached for his touches. It’s been so long since he had anyone touch him.
“Mr. Barton is already on it.”
Everyone’s hand shot up.
“No one cares, Clint,” Natasha joked with a playful eye roll.
“Of course not, you know how famous I am?” Tony exclaimed. “I would not last two seconds without tourists and paparazzis blocking me.”
Over a hour later, the celebratory barbecue started. Clint fixed everyone burgers while Tony handled the music. Everyone was having fun and chatted with one another. Tony moved around the balcony, asserting himself in whatever conversation he could. He currently found himself in one with Thor and Steve.
“It was good,” Steve answered. He placed the bowl on the rack and turned off the water. Tony handed him a towel. “Though I didn’t like, ‘it was all a dream’ ending.”
“Good morning.” Steve kissed Tony on his cheek.
“Uh, hot dogs? Oh, and burgers,” Steve recommended.
“Looks like we did,” Tony repeated, smiling at his boyfriend.
“You’re a
After Bruce went, a couple more students had gone. Nearly 70% of the class sat on either the stairs or the back walkway of the class, the unfortunate ones. Steve prepared himself to be ready to sit on the side and be ruled out of the competition.
“He says you usually take him out to Vegas.”
For the first time, Tony can confidently say he slept well, even though it was only for three hours. His sleep was dreamless, but nevertheless he got some hours in. He woke up more refreshed than usual. This time, he made coffee. A couple of minutes after the coffee finished brewing, Clint arrived in the kitchen. Clint’s eyes were heavy and he mumbled something incoherent to Tony before plopping himself down on the chair.
Tony frowned. He couldn’t spot anyone he knew in this class, except the tall dark haired boy two tables away from him.
On the last bowl, Tony tapped his shoulder. Steve glanced over.
“Any plans?”
“Actually, Tony, I want to tell you something,” Steve began, slowly sitting up.
He zoned out the rest of their argument. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from Steve, who watched Thor’s and Bruce’s argument in amusement. There was something about Steve’s face that Tony liked that every time he saw Steve, he would stare. He caught himself smiling and turned away, face warm and eyes desperately searching to find someone else to talk to. He spotted Clint, who still occupied the grill. He hadn’t talk to Clint yet since the barbecue started.
“Yes, sir.”
“Are you going to plan your own wedding just like you did with Steve?” Natasha asked.
Strangely, Tony felt his chest warm up at the image of his arms around Steve’s waist. “What? You drive fast?”
Steve turned his head. He struggled to bring his breathing back to normal, but manage to crack a smile. He softly kissed Tony's cheek. "Amazing."
Steve smiled at Tony. “See you tomorrow, Tony.”
“Things can change,” Steve pointed out.
“Jarvis, where’s Tony?”
When his conversation with Thor finished, he decided to go talk to Tony.
“Romanoff,” he greeted.
Steve cleared his throat, his cheek a bit tinted. “Sorry, not used to the taste.”
“Bruce," Bruce answered. "It’s...Rogers?”
Once all the way in, Tony stopped to let Steve adjust. The blond man’s eyes were still closed and Tony lightly kissed the tip of his nose. Steve’s eyes fluttered open, those alluring blue eyes staring right at him. Steve moved his hands and entangled his fingers in Tony’s hair. In response, Tony moved his hands up to cup Steve’s face. They hesitated for a moment, Tony staring down at Steve, Steve staring up at Tony. They both admired the other. They admired their flushed faces, their eyes that projected lust and love for the other, and the other’s slightly redden lips that they touched before.
Clint and Natalia. The only two people in class who’s names he knows, did not like him. He congratulated himself for a great start.
“Well-“
Fury gets up and start writing on the whiteboard.
Fury took out a tan folder and flipped through it. “Tell me the facts… Clint Barton.”
For a moment, Steve’s mind disconnected from reality and realized the absurdity of this assignment. He never imagined himself contriving ideas to get a woman out of a murder charge in a college classroom. To add more to the absurdity, this woman’s life literally depends on them. Steve doesn’t understand how everyone else is only viewing it as a homework assignment and not the fact a woman’s livelihood is hanging in the balance.
Steve remembered it’s Friday. Friday = movie nights.
“Is that why you don’t sleep?”  Steve questioned.
Steve mumbled a yes and bit his lips, eyes still closed, prepared for what’s to come. Tony went slow just as he promised. He gasped then moan as the burning pain quickly morph into pleasure. Tony watched Steve’s face to judge when to push further into Steve. Each thrust felt blissful. Steve’s tight, not too tight thanks to his prep, but it squeezed his cock in just the right way that his stomach coiled with pleasure.
His eyes lingered on the messages. He chewed his inner cheek then turn his phone off. Another sigh and Steve decided he should take a break. There was barely food in his apartment so either pizza or chinese was his best option. He'll go to whichever is the closest. Steve grabbed his jacket and headed out his apartment.
Steve’s eyes are wide, his mouth slightly agape. He sighed, lips pressed to a thin line. “It does.” He paused. “I had a whole year to adjust after SHIELD rescued me and its still a struggle everyday.”
“He’s going to wake up right after us,” Tony asserted. “I figured he would want some coffee before he leaves.”
“His cup? He usually doesn’t wake up earlier than us,” Clint pointed out.
“Sugar and milk are over there,” Clint pointed behind Steve.
“Jarvis?”
Clint rubbed his eyes again. He doesn’t understand what just happened or if he’s in a weird fever dream. “I hope so.”
Tony shook his head, scooting over to widen the space. “No, go ahead.”
Fury tilted his head just a millimeter, his stone face still there. “Allegedly?”
“Please don’t come to me with stupid questions,” Phil continued.
He patted Bruce’s shoulder and said, “I’m going to grab another burger.”
Eventually, they reached Steve’s motorcycle. Their walk had finally ended, much to Tony’s dismay. Steve climbed on then Tony. The engine started to purr.
“Shitty night?” Tony guessed. He passed him his coffee mug.
“Morning, Tony,” Steve greeted. He nodded at Clint. “Morning, Clint.”
“Small, modest, I think I can manage that,” Tony assured him. Although he wasn’t sure if he could. All of his parties are huge and wild., filled with so much drinking and people dancing like its the 1920s. He kept a mental note of Steve’s request and started to walk out of the kitchen. “Bruce, he’s the most modest I know, he can help...”
“We’re here,” Steve said, turning the motorcycle off.
Clint blinked. “Yeah. I’ll do that-“ he paused and looked at Steve then Tony, “Now.”
“I say…” he started, still searching for an unused defense. A thought crossed his mind. “We… argue self defense.” He heard light laughter, but continued anyways. “Mr. Tivan is from a place of power and for Ms. Tate to cut it off prematurely it could have done irreparable damage to her career. It was her only way out of an abusive relationship.” Steve stopped and waited for a response from Fury. “I’ll go stand over there.”
Steve shrugged, avoiding eye contact with him. “Can’t really sleep.”
“Anything for a friend,” Tony forced himself to say. “Rhodey is extremely jealous I haven’t done anything like this for him.”
“Cap?” Tony spoke up.
Tony stood up and Steve readied his pencil. Tony smirked. “My defense is…we offered the jury another suspect. Tivan’s youngest brother, Carlo. As I was doing research on Tivan and his family, I noticed that out of all his brother, Carlo didn’t receive any inheritance or any stakes in their father’s company. Instead, Carlo is forced to work under his old brother, our unfortunate victim. And what better way to get back at the brother who got everything than kill him and pin it on his mistress?”
“Surprisingly, the asshole in the group is a create cook,” Tony quipped. He had already finished his burger and is now drinking beer.
“Maybe I’m just lucky,” Tony shot back.
“Good enough. Hopefully you animals didn’t eat any of the buns, Jarvis?” Tony asked.
“Yes.” He poured the rest of the smoothie into his glass.
Tony couldn’t enjoy the movie. The way Steve left bothered him. It was late, Tony wasn’t sure what time it is, but he knew everybody else was asleep. His mind couldn’t stop thinking about Steve and he wondered what emotional turmoil he was dealing with. No one in the Avengers ever talked about their emotions, everyone chose to skate by the topic because that’s a whole Pandora’s Box of trauma none of them are willing to open. Nonetheless, out of everyone Tony thought had the most trauma, Steve was not even on his top five list. Everything about the man is perfect. He wasn’t force to undergo any dangerous trial and errors. Everything perfect about Steve was handed to him in a small vial created by his father. However out of anyone, Tony knows just because your outside facade seems perfect doesn’t mean it is.
Tony caught Steve leaving the training room, his favorite place in the tower. He had brought up planning for Steve’s birthday party before with his fellow Avenger, but Steve wasn’t giving him much to go off of.
“Must suck to have all the attention?” It sounded more like a question then a statement.
Tony shrugged. “I don’t know, it’s pricey though.” He decided to join Natasha on the couch, but he sat on the armrest instead. “Okay, what’s on the menu…Steve-“ the man perked up when Tony pointed to him. “Menu ideas?”
Fury looked at his assistants. They whispered to each other then Fury looked back at Tony. “You can take a seat, Mr. Stark. Congratulations, you’ve moved onto the next round. Alright, who’s next?”
He quickly exited out of the building. Steve decided that pizza would be his option to drown the embarrassment of today.
"Yes, are you okay with it?” There was no malice in his tone just a genuine question about his comfort level. Tony nodded. Steve climbed up on his motorcycle and Tony followed. “Don’t be afraid to grab me, actually its recommended you should.”
This time Steve laughed and Tony’s heart skipped a beat. “These are…really messed up times, huh?"
“Mortals way of celebrating after a victory is very similar to Asgardians, except we have feasts and not turkey burgers.” Thor looked at the burger curiously then took a bite that left half of the burger.
Another couple of swings and Steve placed the bottle on the cooler. From the balcony, you can hear the faint sounds of honking and sirens. The air was cool yet his whole body felt warm.
Hey guys, thanks for reading this fanfic. I've actually had this idea in my head for a couple of years now and I'm glad I am finally able to post it now. When it comes to scheduling, I'm hoping to post at least twice a month, possibly on a weekend. Anyways, thanks for reading!
It happened fast. Steve entangled his fingers in Tony’s hair and pulled him forward in what Tony considered the most messiest and best kiss he ever had. Blood rushed to his head. It felt like a dream, this is too good to be happening, but he knew it’s real. He kissed back, harder than Steve did, grabbing the back of Steve’s head to deepen the kiss.
When Steve reached his seat, Bruce didn’t pay him no mind. Steve figured it wasn’t the best time to bother his next door neighbor and decided to review his notes as well. He drew a star on some of his best defenses and mentally prepared himself what to say for each defense.
“Want to go out?”
Tony complied.
“Clint was not joking when he said he can make a good burger,” Steve stated, taking a bit as well.
"So, how about that?"
Immediately, everyone, except Steve, pulled out their laptops and/or notebooks. Steve furrowed his eyebrows. He pulled out his own notebook in response, but compared to his other classmates, his notebook was blank. He glanced over at the students in front of him and saw an article headlined “Intern Poisoned Boss” and two pictures, one of the woman on the screen and one of a man in a red suit with his arm crossed.
Tony handed him his bowl. “Popcorn?”
Bruce was taken aback by the offer. "I would love to, but." He scratched the back of his neck, dodging Steve's stare. "The assignment Professor Fury gave us, I need all the time I could get."
Steve took the bottle and swung. He stared at the bottle, curious about the brand. “Do you really think the 40s were in black and white?"
“And alert me when either Thor or Nat wakes up.”
"Yeah, very fucked up times,” Tony confirmed.
Steve tapped on his past text conversation with Bucky. It's been four days since Bucky has responded to his texts. He knew Bucky has a new internship that keeps him busy. He sent Bucky another message.
Step 3: We bury the evidence.” He set the marker down, facing the class. “We throw so much information at the jury that they leave the courtroom with one overwhelming feeling…doubt. Thats how you get away with murder.”
“Yeah,” Tony grumbled, passing his hand through his hair.
“9:30. So ten minutes.”
“You’re very smart,” Steve pointed out. Tony knew that. “I heard that you might be our class’ valedictorian.”
“Good job waitlist,” Steve heard someone says to his right. It was Tony. “You managed to impress everyone in class today.”
“Told you.”
“Yes?”
“One more thing,” Fury added, garnering everyone’s attention. “Every year, I have six of my students to come work with me. I use this assignment to decide whether or not you’re capable of joining my team.”  Fury walked to one of the book shelves. He held up a slim glass trophy.  “The top student gets this. My first recognization trophy in the region.” He smirked at the trophy. “Consider it an immunity. Having this allows you to get out of one of my exams. Useful considering all the hard work I’m going to put you all through. Now go. Find a defense that will clear my client.”
“Thanks.” Steve walked in. He was dressed down from his what he originally wore to the birthday party. He wore sweatpants and a white shirt that mocked Tony for how tight it is. The burning sensation returned on his face. Steve approached the bed and pointed, "You mind if I?”
“At the time? Yes,”  Steve answered. In the background, Thor crossed his arms and slumped further into the couch. “I mean, everything was in black and white, but going to the movies was an experience.”  The old man’s expression is wistful and reminiscent. The expression holds for a minute as he stared off. However it falters, the expression screws into an expression of sadness mixed with disappointment. Everyone else looked at him worried.
"Step 1: Discredit the witnesses
Steve walked southwest and passed two buildings. He stopped to stare up at the building. He stared down at the map then at the building looming over him. The sign confirmed he was at the right place. Steve put the map in his pocket. His stomach churned as he entered the building and then the classroom.
Steve nodded, not looking up. He wondered what he had gotten himself into with this class. “My class is different from all the other law class,” Professor Fury finally spoke. His hands were clasped behind his back and he moved step by step behind his desk. “Unlike my colleagues, you will actually practice law and the way you’ll practice law is by doing so in the courtroom.” He stopped at the center of his desk. He scanned the classroom. He unzipped his briefcase and pulled out a clicker. He pointed it at the projector screen. A mugshot of a young woman with wavy brunette and dyed pink tips appeared on the screen. “Our first case, is the aspirin assassin.”
He looked away from Tony, a smile on his face. “Yeah, he did.”
Steve stared at the kettle as if completely immersed in its appearance. Slowly nodding, Steve grabbed his coffee cup and held it out for Clint to pour into.
“Are you two going to make out? ‘Cause it looks like you two are going to make out,” Clint said.
He pulled away once he felt out of breath. The dread that plagued him before dissipated. “Holy shit,” he breathed. Tony went in for a kiss, but quickly stopped himself. Another dread weighed on his mind. “Wait, you’re drunk.”
Tony hesitated for a bit, surprised that Steve had asked. Steve observed him carefully and prayed he didn’t mess up. “Sure, no problem.” The answer eased Steve’s anxiety, just a tiny bit.
When the movie ended, Steve helped cleaned up. Natasha took the whatever leftover snack and put them in a ziplock bag. Bruce did the same, but with the candy. Clint vacuumed the area while Thor lifted the table and couch for Clint. Tony worked on the screen and asked everyone for their next movie suggestions. Steve took the empty bowls to wash.
