Jarvis complies. “Should I remove the white, too, Sir?”
He knows that when it’s over, his heart – or what’s left of his heart anyway – will collapse and burn down and become dust, but in that moment he feels impossibly lucky to be the one Steve chose to love.
He’s not even sure he managed to say the name correctly, but the silence he gets in response is telling enough. He blinks two times more, then tries to sit up.
Hands are clawing at the edges of his head.
It was just a mission like any other. Tony wasn’t supposed to catch
“The magazine is mine,” Tony says, mirroring Steve’s position and sitting up with him. “Of course I would. If you want to.”
They look at each other for a couple of seconds more, then Tony – to his horror – yawns.
“Sir, I’m not sure that would be the best choice in terms of comfort for Mr. Rogers—”
. The most common line of every rom-com crosses Tony’s mind and almost makes him giggle. Were it any other day, he’d greet Steve that way – he’s never shied away from flirting, especially with Steve. He can behave for today, though.
Tony misses Steve in his mouth.
“Let me clean up a little, first,” Tony says. His own pants are uncomfortably sticky.
Steve goes red all over. “Your fault.”
for their troubles, ‘almost’ being the key word.
That looks exhausting.
Now he just drives home with the lightest heart, actually looking forward to seeing what the others prepared for tonight’s big dinner –
They look into each other’s eyes without saying a word for a long time. Tony is certain he’s never felt this strong of an impulse to take someone to his private quarters before. He would trade a few of his treasures to just ask him if he would come with him to his rooms, risks be damned.
“Sir, Hawkeye’s new prototype arrows are assembled,” Friday’s voice interrupts Clint.
Suddenly, making a list of all the things Tony and Steve do together doesn’t seem the best idea of his life. Clint feels his sicker by the minute, his cheeks going paler and paler the more details he notices.
Steve is looking down at him with a heated gaze, and Tony has his tongue on Steve’s dick when he comes.
“Just don’t interrupt my workouts again, Tony.” Steve is trying to sound stern, but Tony can hear the give in his tone. Steve gets closer and closer, until he presses his body against Tony’s.
’? Mr. Rogers, are you shy all of a sudden?”
It’s no different now, after the kisses, after the caresses, after the sighs and the closeness of their bodies. It’s only been one hour, maybe even less, since they first kissed and things spiraled down in a vortex of heat and passion, but Tony is just as breathless as he was when he first brought Steve in his room.
America is no place for meritocracy.
Steve’s eyes are gentle as he smiles in his palm. He turns his head a little and kisses Tony’s hand. “I couldn’t really leave you, you know. I love you.”
Zemo got his confirmation with Stark’s question –
This is how sweet life should be.
“You’re right,” Steve nods. “This is more of a multiverse slash time GPS, it allows me not to get lost in the quantum realm.”
All Tony can do is try to become a better person day after day, moment after moment. He never wants that sparkle in Steve’s eyes, the one he gets when he’s looking at Tony, to disappear. He never wants to crush Steve’s expectations or hurt his feelings, he never wants Steve to second-guess himself.
He also knows that that’s the extent of how far it can go: his own mind. Those memories are going to be played and replay in his head. He’ll just have to ignore the extra feelings that go arm in arm with them.
Tony can’t bear to look at Steve’s face.
cold outside, isn’t it?” Steve asks, gently.
This time he makes sure Steve doesn’t miss the innuendo behind the hushed words and heated gaze.
Like always, Tony has to do all the work himself.
Then he recoils, because tonight, he
“You’re brilliant, Tony. You’re probably one of the smartest scientists I know, you embody the future, and yet you never make me feel less than you.” Tony wants to protest, wants to look away from Steve’s eyes, but he can’t. “It drives me crazy when you leave me behind, when you keep secrets from me. I’m always hard on you, and I’m sorry about that, but it’s just because I expect
It’s “L-O-V-E”.
He’s so beautiful; Tony leans in and steals another brush of lips.
would be the one caressing and holding gals in his arms, and the scarce times it was a man in his company would be hastened, hushed, and never in a bed.
This time, they both laugh.
When Steve proposed to him, Tony had to go against all his rational thoughts telling him to say no – because, no matter how impossibly much he loved Steve, he couldn’t possibly deny him the chance of finding a person more worthy than he is of Steve’s love.
The music builds up and they follow the rhythm like it’s second nature. They step left and then right between
Tony opens his eyes and finds Steve looking at him, his blue eyes staring right into him. He feels naked – like all his thoughts are bare for Steve to read. He doesn’t feel exposed, though. Steve still has one hand on Tony’s back and the other in Tony’s hold, he’s right in front of him with pink around his mouth and on his cheeks, and he’s holding his gaze as if he might like what he’s reading there.
Then he notices the… walls, yes, those are walls. His vision is still pretty blurred, he’s lying on the hard ground and – probably hit his head, or something. He doesn’t remember falling.
Steve might not know how to suck up to the ugly society, but he’s still the best strategist Tony knows. If he thinks this could help, then he’s probably right.
Steve just sighs a little. “You still have no idea how you make me feel, what you do to me.” It’s not a question, so Tony doesn’t answer. “It’s okay,” Steve continues. “I have a lifetime to prove it to you, day after day, until I make sure you understand that. Even if that’s the last thing I ever do.”
He’s never going to stop thinking about it, is he? That little brush of lips will be forever etched into his memory, branded into his skull for good. If someone were to open his brain one day, they would find there, for all to see, the words ‘I kissed Steve Rogers.’
To be fair, he doesn’t usually take unknown men to his quarters, either.
Better to make every second count.
Tony is barely aware that there are gagging noises and grumbling coming from the kitchen. He’s too busy getting distracted by Steve’s tongue and getting lost in his mouth to care.
Right now, he bobs his head up and down, aiming to drive Steve insane through his dick. His hand massages what he doesn’t manage to cover with his mouth – it’s been quite some time from the last time he’s done this, and Steve is not exactly small, so he doesn’t even try to take everything in his mouth. Plenty of time to practice that, in the future. At least, Tony hopes.
got you right.” Steve pauses a little, looking at him like he is the most beautiful piece of art. “But now, now I think that – that nothing, that no one, can ever truly do you justice. It’s impossible. You’re so much more than your photographs,” he finishes with a rueful smile.
“I wouldn’t mind,” Tony says. He bites his own lips and caresses Steve’s back slowly, feeling each and every one of his muscles under his shirt. He wouldn’t mind
Almost simultaneously, Tony hears a gunshot.
He doesn’t want him to go. He has a feeling Steve doesn’t want to go, either.
“Not really,” Tony says, smirking. “I like where it lead us. Though I have to say, I don’t quite do this every time I meet someone… Interesting.” At that, Steve’s eyes flash with something Tony can’t quite place. Huh. “Besides, I was really aiming for inconspicuous, tonight.” He adds, sheepish.
“You are a genius, Tony, I’m sure you’ll outsmart some boring cooking.”
Now they push him underwater, then proceed to claw at the scratches, just to let him bleed to death.
He’s only able to capture a few words in between the fog.
Steve notices Tony’s gaze, and his eyes darken a little as well. “Tony—”
Additionally, he’s glad his face is not recognizable enough for people to go and talk to him like they would at a normal ball.
you think he’s a supervillain, not when he appears in the lab out of nowhere, no, when he comments on your height—”
“Sir,” Jarvis says, and Tony groans. “Ms. Potts is demanding you on the phone
The guy they’re trying to flush out – Marcus Immortus – is a trafficker of prostitutes. SHIELD’s intel has it as a certain fact, so Nick Fury assigned the mission to the Avengers while letting Coulson coordinate with the head of police. It’s not aliens-invade-New-York big, but it’s something that’s resulting in dead bodies all over the city; something has to be done, fast.
“Save those sounds for your bedroom!” Clint yells from the kitchen, and someone behind Tony chuckles.
“I am going to try, though,” Steve continues. His eyes are determined as he speaks. “I am going to keep trying, again and again, until I manage to capture at least a spark of the very essence of you, and put it on paper. I’m going to do you justice.”
Kissing Steve feels infinitely better than his fantasy. He’s
“Thank you!” Steve exclaims, when they separate. He is positively glowing. Tony’s cheeks hurt from the big smile splitting his face. “Of course I want to! Thank you so much! That would be lovely! You won’t regret it, I promise!” Steve says, and Tony laughs at the sheer enthusiasm of the man in front of him.
Steve figures he must have arrived pretty early in the life of this version of Tony and himself. If other Steve is still surprised that Tony would figure out how to time and universe travel because he was
Steve takes the mask in his left hand – damn, Tony had
“You are a sight for sore eyes, darling,” Tony says. His hand stops its descend only when he meets the waistband of Steve’s pants, his fingers teasing around the hem.
– and said yes.
He knows
. He’s really in another universe, like his Tony said. He really did it – he really figured out a way to
Tony wants him so much, this kiss is only throwing fuel on his impossible crush.
Steve’s tongue licks Tony’s lips, tasting every ounce of him, and a groan leaves Tony, completely unbidden. When they break apart, Tony’s gaze shifts down to Steve’s red, swollen lips, and has to recall all his self-control in order not to jump him again and sabotage the mission.
There’s a beat of silence when Tony’s eyes widen and he
(Short of the world dying, that is.)
No, for them, the worst hurt would come from the betrayal of those they entrusted with their love.
He needed to be careful, to plan the whole thing just right.
Steve takes his hand back to Tony’s head and crashes their lips together one more time, hard, and Tony all but moans into his mouth.
“When you’ve done bickering like the married couple you are,” he begins, and that catches the others’ attention, “You could tell me when my arrows are gonna be ready. Then I can leave you two alone,” Clint finishes, watching them.
It’s Steve's birthday present, so he can only work on it when Steve is not in the workshop with him – and come to think of it, it doesn’t happen so often. Not when Steve’s in the Tower and not on missions.
Now those memories are all Tony can think about.
“If it makes your cheeks go red like that, I really do,” Tony says. He realizes what he’s said the second the words leave his mouth.
Tony would love to feel those hands on his body.
“The dream of my life,” Steve says. There’s so much cautious wonder and happiness in those words that Tony is flooded with positive energy and can do nothing but smile in reply. “Are you serious?” Steve asks, incredulous, sitting up on the bed. “Would you really take me on adventures with you?”
Tony shoots back his drink, then chases a waiter for a few steps to swap his empty glass for a full one.
“Right,” Steve replies.
The leaders of the Avengers, two of the most powerful and influential men in the ill-assorted group, were close with each other, enough to be lethal. Different at heart, they complemented each other to the very last bone.
Clint is still skeptical about Nat’s explanation.
He is impossibly hard. He wants Steve to beg him for all different reasons.
“Better?” Steve asks soft, and his voice is so gentle that Tony almost misses Steve’s arms circling his shoulders and waist, half-hugging him from his right side.
God, it seems like it was a week ago already – they got interrupted.
Steve shuts the door behind Tony and then proceeds to pin him to said door, grinding his body into Tony’s and
He’s panting just like Tony, eyes blown and lips burning red.
Tony nods. “Okay.” He feels some of his tension seeping out of him and stands up. “Where are the others anyway?” he changes topic as he takes his glass to the sink.
Steve smiles as Tony takes him to one of the tables. Steve would love to look around and taking in all the blue surrounding him, but he can’t keep his eyes off Tony. He’s so
Steve’s fingers brush Tony’s as he passes him the smoothie, and Tony feels the hysterical urge to take a step forward and kiss Steve good morning.
Tony can’t focus for a moment, his heart skipping a beat, then another. He doesn’t have the strongest heart, alas, but he’s never been affected like this by loving words before. Again, he doesn’t know what to do.
from spontaneous combustion.
In an attempt to distract himself from his own thoughts, Tony says, “My mom used to make them. They were my comfort food.” He brings the smoothie to his mouth, hoping it will stop him from blabbering about his childhood.
But Steve’s right there in front of him, and Tony prefers touching as much of him as possible, even if that means never touching his own body.
than you want to be alone,” Clint deadpans. “Trust me.”
They’re both wearing the latest model of Stark’s security cameras, equipped with microphones. They’re miniaturized and embedded in the buttons of their suits, untraceable and undetectable. Coulson will get every second of their evening, along with the Avengers: Clint, Natasha, Coulson and a handful of police officers are on stand-by in a couple of pubs around the block, ready to intervene should things go – hopefully – south.
He has to mingle, but only a little. It’s not as bad as he figured the evening would go.
Tony is still the happiest he’s ever been.
He takes a final look at it, turns it around and makes some final, manual modification at the measurements and details.
Two drinks aren’t going to cut it.
This leaves him with a fairly big amount of time, where he can take in Steve’s form: when he’s cooking and has his back on Tony, when he’s stretching out to take something not close by, when he’s simply sitting on the sofa, calm and relaxed, and Tony can see the rise and fall of his broad chest as Steve breathes.
“Not necessarily,” Tony says, slowly. The plan they had before is being redefined in his head, adjusting interactions and testing out details.
Tony’s eye roll is
, to put it mildly, but a part of it is directed at himself.
He searches Steve’s eyes for any clue that he’s reading the situation wrong, but he only finds admiration and intensity.
Immortus.
“Very,” Steve says. He wraps the blanket all around Tony, then he and Tony-the-living-burrito sit on the floor, right in front of the fireplace.
(Steve could relate to that. The very thought is unsettling – when he’s forced to fight without his shield, it just feels wrong, like a part of him is missing.)
The smile on the other man’s face widens just a little, and Tony feels an muted, almost familiar flutter in his stomach.
And now they’re on Tony’s bed, they’re under the covers and they’re kissing, and Tony is sure his plan is bulletproof.
Ever since the mess with Ultron, the Avengers seems to have made it their personal mission to stick together, on missions, at home, everywhere they could.
Then Steve’s hands tangle through Tony’s hair— and just like that, a soft moan escapes Tony’s throat.
One love, snuffed out.
“No,” Steve says again when Tony offers him a drink. “I don’t drink on the job, Tony.”
They stay still for another couple of seconds, torn between the need to lean in again – Tony’s – and, Tony supposes, the desire to keep décor – Steve’s. It’s nice, being this close to Steve, sharing that weird but pleasant tension that has nothing to do with imminent threats.
His legs are back to feeling normal, so he goes and stands up, testing his theory.
Tony smiles in turn. “When have you become so wise?” he asks without bite.
Tony smiles and resolutely ignores the little flip his stomach does at the sound. He’s quite proud of introducing Steve to memes and other wonders of the twenty-first century.
He just had one of the most intense orgasms of his life, and he’s not even out of his pants yet.
Clint watches Tony and Steve bickering over dinner.
Tony is breathless. “You would manage perfectly without me,” is all he can think to say.
It doesn’t help. It never really helps.
“Our job is to run towards people that want to kill us,” Tony mutters, because he can’t say
would mean with those words.
Just like his personality, Steve’s gaze is magnetic, pinning him in place and stealing his breath away from him. All Tony wants to do is take the last step and kiss him.
So now they have five presents to open each. It’s a mess, everyone is tipsy from eggnog and/or mead, but it’s extremely funny.
“Tony—” Steve doesn’t even finish the warning before Tony’s on his mouth again, stealing one last kiss before Steve shakes his head and steps aside.
“Well, if it isn’t Captain America and Tony Stark,” comes a phony, sugared voice from behind Tony.
Probably due to the weariness dragging him, a tiny part of Tony feels weird being called out by a complete stranger.
Steve tugs at his hair to keep him in place, eliciting spikes of pain that make Tony groan. “
Of course, Captain America knew about it. In the past year, Zemo gathered every single detail about what those murderers did. He watched every single step, every mission, every personal relationship. He knew more about them than they knew about each other.
He mechanically grabs the unsweetened cocoa powder, some ice, sugar and milk, and puts them all in the blender. The noise is almost soothing, lulling him into a trance for a couple of seconds, where his mind is blessedly empty.
The man looks like he’s embarrassed enough to leave him be, but Tony says before he has the chance to talk, “Then what is it that makes me stand out?”
Now, though… Now, Tony can’t wait to get back to the Tower, to Steve, to his dysfunctional colleagues-slash-friends-slash-family that could probably kill him in his sleep, but never do.
That’s. Uh.
When Steve speaks, it burns the last brain cells left in Tony’s brain. “May I have this dance?” Steve asks.
They spent yet another Wednesday night watching movies and bickering about which series is better; Star Trek or Star Wars. Tony has
mouth.
“This is my job, now. I am an artist. You inspired me to do yet another thing, in my life.” Steve can’t stop smiling. “I owe you so much.”
The urge to laugh is overwhelming, and he barely manages to rein it in.
Maybe they won’t need to actually kiss, Tony ponders. Maybe lingering hands and closeness will be enough.
, he tells himself.
Tony is going to
Tony brings his other hand to stroke Steve’s back as he climbs on top of Tony and kisses him within an inch of his life. Tony shudders and tightens his hold on Steve’s hair, his own body oversensitive and responsive. He bites back a whimper as Steve’s mouth moves onto his neck and starts kissing him there, alternating small licks and pecks that make Tony shiver and want even more.
Moments after getting inside, Steve examined the room, taking in how many security guards and cameras there were, and informed the others via his Stark camera – undetected, of course.
. He was perfectly happy to crush over Steve in the privacy of his mind, with no label on his sentiments; with no physical evidence of what he was missing out.
Tony wills his blush to die before he turns around, and is faced with Steve in his morning outfit. He is wearing sweatpants and a blue t-shirt that does nothing to hide his muscles, and his neck is slightly glistening with what Tony supposes is sweat.
Tony should’ve been more thorough while preparing Steve for this – but alas, too little too late.
“You’re such a huge dork, Rogers,” he mutters. He does stand up, though, shivering again, and loses his coat quickly and throws it on the chair next to the sofa. “Happy now?”
In another life, Tony might ask him that very question. Here and now, though, he shoves it into the corner of unasked, unanswered Steve-questions.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve says, his tone soft as if he’s trying not to wake someone. Like he doesn’t want to spook Tony.
Tony Stark and his never-ending luck.
“I love you like a mad man, Tony,” Steve whispers on his mouth. Tony kisses him again, this time opening his mouth and licking his bottom lip. He lets Steve take control of the kiss as their tongues meet, and Tony leans even closer, bringing his hands to Steve’s hair. He’s growing hard in his pants and suddenly staying there any longer seems like an absurd idea. He wants to get to the mansion, now.
As the piano dies out, Tony’s heart starts hammering in his chest as he realizes he’s nodding.
With that resolution in mind, Tony gets up and goes to the bathroom to take a shower. The warm water soothes him and brushes away the remnant of his sleep, leaving him more awake and slightly less gloomy.
God, but Tony wants to do more.
Steve lets his eyes fall on Tony’s left hand – Steve still has the shield on his left arm – and finds nothing. Huh.
He looks in the mirror one last time. The blue of his eyes is the only color on his figure tonight. His whole body is covered in black: suit, jacket, shoes, gloves and mask all match the black of his hair.
Tony leans on the doorframe of the gym, the fluffy edges of his robe brushing his thighs. It's his favorite garment; light and soft, crimson and gold.
“Happy birthday to
Tony’s workshop has quickly become one of Steve’s favorite places to spend his free time. When Tony is in there, and Steve is not working out in the gym, or isn’t volunteering at the animal shelter right down the road, or isn’t cooking something for the whole team, Steve is in the workshop with him. He likes to relax there, keeping Tony company, sketching stuff and making sure Tony doesn’t accidentally set the lab on fire, or injures himself.
Yet another time he’s let him down.
Steve owns the Waltz like he’s a professional dancer. Maybe the serum helps with the coordination of the movements – he’d only have to know the steps, in order to replicate them perfectly. But that, in Tony’s opinion, would only lead to a mechanical, stilted dance— technically correct, but lacking finesse.
It’s the coldest night of the year.
Steve is smiling against his mouth as he swallows down moan after moan. His erection is pressed into Tony’s hip – Tony can feel it with every movement of his body as Steve presses against him and lets Tony enjoy the aftershocks until they settle to a halt.
It’s Captain America. It’s
It’s Christmas Eve and the Tower is lit and properly decorated. They all participated: Bruce cooked dinner along with Clint, Thor brought some Asgardian mead to celebrate, occasionally helping Natasha and Tony setting the decorations in place, and Steve made eggnog.
He manages to be at Steve’s side as soon as the woman Steve was talking to walks away.
“And yet, here you are, with me,” Tony resolves to say.
“Would you like me to give you a tour?” Tony asks, voice low. His heart is beating a little faster than usual because he never does this, much less with strangers who could punch him or report him, and it’s heady and Tony
It’s Steve.
Tony takes a sip of his drink, then clears his throat. “Of course you don’t. Soft drink— I should’ve known.” He turns towards Steve and smiles a little, hyper aware of how close they are. They need to be doing this and
Tony knew he had fans, but he never fully understood before. “Wow,” he whispers. “I wish I could see those drawings you made. I wish I could see all of your works, actually.” It’s Steve’s turn to try and hide from him, so Tony hastens to add, “I really do.” He wonders if he would be able to know what Steve was feeling, just by looking at his drawings.
much from you. And in the end you always listen, you always fill me in. You always make sure to bring me with you, you always reserve a place for me just next to you. I will never keep up with you, but you do it anyway, you never make me feel left behind.”
They’re half-naked on the bed when the call to Assemble interrupts them.
It’s just. He’s never had to go somewhere undercover as Captain America’s partner. As in,
Tony laughs. What a series of fortunate events, that brought them together! First, he didn’t want to go to his own ball, and it took Jan’s best efforts to convince him. Then she and Pepper left him alone, and then Jan’s curiosity made Pepper tell Steve, and effectively send him his way.
Tony wishes he could see his face, at least.
They’ve had very little free time, and there has been almost no room to think about getting all hot and bothered.
God, he wants to kiss him so badly it hurts.
Tony sighs as the laughter dies down. He finishes the smoothie and looks at Steve. He’s still on the stool in front of Tony, and when Tony looks up, Steve looks right back at him. He’s calmer than before, almost relaxed, and his good mood influences Tony’s, who hasn’t felt this calm since this whole ordeal started.
know it,” he continues, more gently. “You had every right to be upset. You’ve had your fair share of people who wanted to kill you. Your reaction was reasonable.”
“The pleasure is ours,” Steve says. Tony can figure out his strategy without even having to ask – Steve must have noticed Immortus isn’t very fond of him, perhaps for everything Captain America represents, and he’s determined to make himself more likeable to the man.
“…y there,” one voice says. It’s so similar to Tony’s, but it’s not the same.
“Follow my breathing, honey, c’mon.” Steve’s voice is gentle next to him, and when did he sit down? Gosh, he’s so out of it, he’s making a fool of himself— “Tony. You can do it.”
That is the exact same moment when Jarvis speaks. “Sir,” he begins.
At some point, a drunk-on-mead Clint takes the mistletoe from what Tony assumes is the nearest handrail, and throws it in their general direction, yelling “Mistletoe incoming!”
Steve opens his eyes. The first thing he sees is blue. All around him, above him, even the air feels blue. For a second, he thinks he’s outside and looking at the sky, an impossible sunny day beaming down at him – blue all around him.
makes Tony hot all over. Had he not come minutes ago, he would be rock hard.
Tony wants to know. He regrets not knowing everything about Steve. Granted, he’s done his fair share of research about the guy, not only in his most recent years, but throughout his whole life. Howard had always been proud of knowing Captain America. Tony used to research things about him, way before the Internet became a commodity. He’s always wanted to know as much as possible about Captain America – and he’s managed to dig up a lot of things about him, throughout the years.
MILD SPOILERS in the notes.
It lands right on Steve’s head, much to everyone’s glee. It is the perfect occasion for Tony to crawl on Steve’s lap and kiss him soundly.
Tony’s mind is worryingly blank as he steps into Steve’s personal space and responds to the kiss with far more enthusiasm than necessary. He brings his free hand around Steve’s neck, trying to get as close to Steve as physically possible.
Steve just set his mind on doing it, Tony can tell.
“Thank you. I am flattered.” Tony smiles. “Your mask elegantly suits your figure, as well. It accentuates the color of your eyes,” he says. He notices the man loses some of the nervousness. “Would you be so kind as to tell me your name?” Tony asks – because this, he can do. This is safe.
Of course, in every world of the multiverse, he’s going to protect Tony. It’s such a deeply rooted feature of himself he can’t imagine anything different.
“We can’t, babe,” Steve says, and Tony almost vibrates off his skin. Where the hell did
Tony is charmed, alright.
But then he saw Steve’s face, his earnest expression, his eyes bright with love and desire and burning hope, and Tony just couldn’t bring himself to crush all that.
Every time Rogers appears in the elevator and comes in and says hi, or marches onto the floor without a word and goes straight to Stark’s office, Derek knows what is going to happen.

him dance, though— yeah, another matter entirely.
. He’s been Tony’s crush since forever. He’s gentle, caring, he’s a huge dork, he’s clever, infuriating, and has body for miles.
Steve looks put out. “What if it’s dangerous? What if someone’s there? I mean, to breach the security of your company like this—it could be dangerous. It’s probably dangerous. I should—”
“I’m sorry I didn’t let you introduce yourself properly,” Tony says.

The important thing had never been Tony’s happiness. He knows he has issues – who even knows
“That wouldn’t be the word I’d use, no,” Tony replies, smiling. “Though I am offended I didn’t know this. How did I not know this? I’ll have words with Pepper,” he mumbles.
“Your night going well, I take it?” Tony asks near Steve’s ear, taking in Steve’s relaxed stance. He’s probably closer than normal, but he doesn’t give a damn. Steve is irresistible.
It’s heated. It’s determined.
of beeping, that’ll have to change – and he moves away. He takes one hand on Tony’s cheek and lets it linger there, Tony’s adoring face shifting to longing for a second before he sighs.
Tony ignores his accelerated heartbeat and blames the sudden heat on his third drink.
They’re a fine distraction from his burning throat.
When they break apart, Tony opens his eyes to find Steve’s staring right into him. His pupils are blown wide and he’s panting a little. Tony can feel his breath on his own mouth, and he struggles to get his own breathing back to normal.
From the outside, they are just a couple showing some PDA. They’re exactly what the mission requires: professional in their gestures, efficient in their reiteration. They are going to get the job done. They’re perfect.
Great.
Then a thought crosses his mind.
“Why would anyone want that?” Steve quirks a brow, and it’s obvious he’s holding back from wrinkling his nose in disgust. Tony agrees wholeheartedly.
Steve eyes him quizzically. “It’s just a mission like every other,” he replies.
“You got me,” Tony says with mirth. Then he sobers up. “Almost everyone here has masks on sticks. Where’s the point of a masquerade ball, if everyone can clearly see who they’re speaking to?”
“Who are you?” the other Steve asks.
Steve frowns, but nods. He loses the scowl though, so Tony relaxes just a fraction.
Steve smiles too, and relaxes minutely. “Good. That would be swell, then.”
Steve licks and nips at his mouth as the kiss slows down, and
They both fall asleep, exhausted from the week and tangled up with each other.
“Hey, Tony.” Steve’s voice is gentle, and it’s closer to him now. Tony notices he’s been tapping his pencil on his notebook when Steve places his hand on Tony’s and the tapping stops.
, Tony doesn’t say.
to keep his job – and scoffs.
Steve smiles. “Yes. I want to cuddle.”
doing, so he just stays quiet.
“That’s pure bullshit by the way,” Tony talks over Steve. “Your shield is the size of a dinner plate and you still insist on using that, instead of letting me upgrade your armor –”
How is a Tango supposed to be appropriate for this kind of an event? No matter how much they want to lure Immortus out, dancing a Tango in the middle of a high-up social event is definitely not appropriate, surely?
his kisses with Steve – whereas, until just a few hours back, kissing Steve was a fantasy relegated into the deepest corners of his mind. It’s like breathing properly after having spent your entire life under water. Tony distantly wonders if that’s how Steve felt the first time he took a breath after the serum.
The noise Steve makes goes straight to Tony’s dick, and he dives in hungrily. He’s like a starved man offered an all-you-can-eat buffet: Steve is right in front of him, his body just there for Tony to taste, and he’s
Tony can’t believe the last time they tried to get dirty –
Tony sighs. “It’s probably bad.” To put it mildly. Their security system is pretty solid. “I’m afraid I might have to go there and check by myself.”
“Nobody has ever done justice to this body,” Steve whispers quietly without looking up, silencing every one of Tony’s wandering thoughts.
Tony is reluctant to open his eyes; all he wants to do is bask in the afterglow of one of the best kisses of his life. If the way Steve kissed him back is anything to go by, though, he might actually like what he’d find.
“Tony, we can’t, there are people here,” Steve tries to reason. The vibrations of his throat make Tony’s knees wobble. He’d love to get a hand on his dick. It would be so easy to just slip it down—
A pang of longing rushes through his body, leaving him breathless. His chest aches. He needs to hold Steve again. He needs to be able to kiss him whenever he feels like. It’s like his body became addicted to Steve’s proximity in the span of one night, and is now demanding its fix. The thought that he isn’t allowed to do all that makes him feel dull inside.
Ever since they tried to sleep together the first time, things had prevented sex from happening. They keep touching more than usual and they kiss a whole lot around the Tower, yet it never goes further.
Immortus’ face twists up in displeasure at Steve’s words, his eyes zooming in to Steve’s hand still on Tony’s side, before looking back up. His eyes are cold, even though he doesn’t lose the grating smile. “I’m afraid my other guests are wondering where I have gone,” he says. “I’m sure we will talk again soon.”
Tony slides his hand in the back of Steve’s neck and squeezes a little. Besides the obvious sentiment Steve’s words made him feel, they also have the effect of making Tony wonder. How did Steve get invited to a masquerade ball, in his own mansion? Who is he? Tony regrets not asking before. Now it would be embarrassing, maybe even rude. Besides, he knows they only have a few more minutes, because at some point Steve has to go back before the ball ends.
“Indeed we do, Stark,” Immortus replies, empty smile not wavering as he shakes hands with Steve. “I must say, though, I’d resigned myself to never properly meeting you. We hardly belong in the same social circles anymore.” His eyes shift to Steve while he talks, eyeing him up like he’s a particular annoyance he has to put up with.
Steve’s fingers are stroking his hair and Steve’s tongue is licking its way to Tony’s throat and Steve’s thigh is thrusting against his cock when Tony comes, moaning and groaning and clutching Steve’s ass. Shocks of pleasure shake his body as he jolts on Steve, again and again, the movements making every part of his body that’s touching Steve’s fire up, over-sensitized.
Natasha says they’re fucking. Clint prefers the vow theory.
Namely, he’s this close to stealing Steve away to rip his clothes off him.
Tony really wants to kiss Steve, though.
“I know you don’t, I know that’s just you, but— that’s what it looks like from the outside. People like Immortus, well. They don’t like that.”
Only minutes later, an almost familiar figure stands out in the doorway. When he makes out the impressive physique and the righteous stand, Tony regrets giving in to his demons for almost one entire second.
That should be any minute now, Tony said they would be ready before six, and the man is nothing but precise, about technology.
Tony’s heartbeat accelerates just so. Heat rises up on his cheeks, and he realizes with horror he’s about to blush – so he goes and deflects it. “You mean you want to cuddle.” He tries to sound deadpan, but he sounds affectionate even to his own ears.
Steve nods. His watch now beeps the two-minutes alert, and that makes him shift his attention back to other Steve, hand still in his.
(See the end of the chapter for
do that – but the two of them were the only ones to be present at every one of the five calls that week, and he’s
The other Steve watches them intently. Steve tries not to mind that, his prime focus fixed on Tony, but he knows that if things were reversed, he’d like to be included. Especially if Tony was talking with
He realizes that stopping from casually touching Steve is going to be hell, right at the same time that he realizes what Steve just said.
That’s another thing that will be imprinted in his mind for as long as he lives. Only this time, he’s glad that he can ask Jarvis to replay the footage as many times as he wants.
He must be back from his morning run.
Tony tries to swallow down as much as possible, letting the rest of Steve’s come dribble down his chin. Steve is hunched on him as he shakes through the aftershocks, and Tony massages him through it, enjoying the taste of the last splutters of come he manages to coax out of him.
Stark’s posture, his crumpled face, his hurt.
He remembers not liking this song, neither the original version nor the following, more popular covers, like this one. He remembers thinking that each and every person is perfectly capable of making a name for themselves without help from anyone else, and that nobody was supposed to have as much power over another person’s life as the song seemed to imply. Loving someone to that point had to be dangerous, unhealthy.
Tony notices how Steve’s eyes trace his face, his neck, his torso, and stop with disapproval where the sheets cover the rest of his body.
Something must show on his face, because Steve’s perfect features morph to slight confusion. “Tony?”
When he opens his eyes, Steve looks concerned. “Tony, how bad are we talking about?”
grow up with the intrinsic need to have a sugar daddy. Ever since childhood, they get told that, if they’re good enough, they’ll get to sit on a bearded, old guy’s lap, and he will buy them all sorts of things. All they need to do is convince him they were good boys or girls. It’s the very principle of the sugar daddy, okay, it just
It’s like Steve’s turned on his kindliness to the extreme.
Steve nods once, a dark glint passing through his eyes. “Then…” he says, coming closer and closer to Tony.
sit next to each other during movie nights and disappear together for the night…
He owes Steve to be professional, at the very least.
He hasn’t been for a while. He suspects he never was.
Steve chokes and starts coughing. Tony pats him on the back a couple of times. “Come with me, I’ll get you something to drink,” Tony says. If his voice’s a little louder than needed, well, no one has to know.
“You put— okay, ouch, don’t hit me because I had an honest reaction. How about this, I’ll make sure you won’t do anything harmful or sacrilegious?”
Tony waves one hand in the air. “It doesn’t need to be comfortable. A snug fit helps his movements.”
. This is what he’s been looking for, all his life. To come home to someone waiting for him on Christmas’ Eve, happy to see him again, not resenting him for his sole existence.
“I don’t do that, I don’t ‘make people like me’,” Steve protests. His brow is furrowed adorably and Tony has to physically hold back from leaning in and kissing the center of his forehead.
Tony’s heart is wild in his chest. He doesn’t know how to reply to that. Courtesy flattery, he can deal with. Enthusiastic fans, he can handle. But heartfelt compliments, he’s never learned how to feel about those.
the moment when they realize what he’s saying. They both blush, Tony a light shade of red, other Steve to deep scarlet. They carefully avoid looking at each other, both their eyes fixed on Steve.
with Steve Rogers.
’d be the first one,” Tony tells him, amused, putting a hand on Steve’s chest and moving his head back.
Steve is there for Tony to lean on, to follow, and it’s heady as hell.
“Me neither,” Steve admits, but before Tony can reply, he continues, “But I’d like to just hold you in my arms right now.”
“You have nice hands,” Tony says. It’s all he can do not to say what he wants to say.
he never does. It’s like being an adolescent all over again. “I remember. It was the very first thing you told me,” Tony says.
He’s almost in the dining room, when Steve calls, “Oh, and Tony?”
. No evil masterminds casting him away, no stuff to figure out in order to come back, just some coordinates on his watch.
He has to finish the suit before Steve comes back.
“Come on, it’s just one time! We have plenty of time to do… other stuff.”
has its downs, as people recognize his figure even though he’s almost completely covered in black. Besides, it’s not like anyone else in the room has scars on their face like he does. He’s sure people can recognize him just for those.
would make a clever, teasing comeback, and that’s where his Tony would up the game and start filling their bantering with innuendos. This Steve, though, doesn’t reply – he just stands there, posture stiff and shielding Tony with his whole body, and—
Tony is not sure it was a simple networking event anymore. If the guy felt comfortable enough to shoot his own damn guests, then clearly something else was going on behind the scenes. Something SHIELD didn’t bother investigating, given the ‘low threat’ of Immortus. Something the police wasn’t aware of.
A sane person would try to reason.
Tony fancies himself a hedonistic person; he likes to have nice, beautiful things. He’s spent a fairly high amount of money to get his suit tailored just for this occasion, and he’s treated Steve to the same tailor. This way, they’re somewhat matching outfits, without it being too obvious.
“What is life without a bit of mystery in it, right?” Pepper asks, rhetorically. Tony knows she means it.
He doesn’t want to face Steve.
They kiss for what feels like hours, until Tony’s stomach rumbles and Steve giggles on Tony’s lips.
Then Steve moves his fingers experimentally and Tony outright moans, this time breaking the kiss and gasping out loud. “Steve,
Tony blinks back to the limo and summons a smirk. “Sure I am, Cap.”
Steve’s features are gentle as he takes a sip, and then his eyes widen.
Tony has
Steve hums in reply, sending vibrations through Tony’s neck and entire body.
Tony shivers a little.
Tony bites his lips as he looks up at Steve, only to find Steve staring at him intently. He’s about to apologize when Steve takes a few steps towards him – and then he’s in Tony’s space, closer than he’s been since last night, and Tony’s heart goes absolutely haywire. Steve stares right in his eyes, and Tony finds he cannot look away from the deep baby blues in front of him.
Steve almost chuckles. Of course he’s slower than Tony – that’s another constant in the multiverse, he figures.
Tony shakes his head and smiles. “Yeah, I did.” He looks at Steve and wonders how nice it would be to just go over and kiss him on the lips. He stifles a sigh as he steps closer. “Thank you for letting me sleep, by the way. You shouldn’t have gone through all this trouble though,” Tony says. “Did you
He’s only human.
As with many things in his life, he was wrong.
“Yes.”
“I bet I would,” Immortus replies, his face hardening a little under the public display of affection. Tony internally jumps in satisfaction. It seems like their plan might work just fine, after all.
When he reaches the kitchen, he sees Steve setting the plates on a nicely decorated table. There’s a lot of snacks here and there, a bottle of wine and some flowers right in the middle of the table.
There’s always been people dancing tonight, even when he and Steve were dancing a proper Waltz. It’s rude to let the center of the room be empty for a long time – Tony knows shady social events are not excluded from this custom.
He already feels lighter with hope at the prospect of seeing Steve again.
“You’re literally one inch away from melting into each other, man.”
, and the others should know this, damn it.
for the rest of our stay, promise.” He waits until Steve stops glaring, then talks. “Anyway. You know the thing you do when you’re yourself,” Tony begins, and Steve frowns again. Tony is really glad he is a super soldier, otherwise he would already be sporting some impressive wrinkles on his forehead. “
Steve is caressing him like he’s showing his claim to the whole room.
Without an outlet to let the pent up adrenaline dissipate, Tony’s heart starts pounding in his chest. He’s barely aware that Steve is speaking, but he can’t make out words, he’s breathing with difficulty and his head is spinning.
He and Steve have been kissing and trying to get their clothes off at the same time, stumbling and bumping and laughing, giddy from what’s about to happen – he’s going to have sex with
They manage to keep it innocent enough not to get stared at. It’s tamer than the kiss they shared right before their Waltz, on one hand, but on the other hand, there’s more desire.
At that, Steve lowers his hands. His cheeks are not entirely back to normal, but he seems less embarrassed, at least. “I used to think that your cartoonists slacked. Not that it was my place to tell,” Steve hastens to add. His cheeks color a little more. “But the way they drew you… It wasn’t close to the real you, the one in the photographs. Every time I had a copy of Marvels in my hand after seeing you on that newspaper, I felt annoyed, like it was somehow a personal insult that they never got you right. They
It’s the best sensation Tony has felt in a long while.
“You’re an absolute menace, Steve Rogers.” Tony says with mirth. Then he adds, “You’re lucky I feel the same way.”
Tony nods, ignoring the way his body thrums with anticipation.
It’s that thought that prompts him to inch closer to Steve and bring their mouths together.
Besides, saying no would only mean Tony didn’t believe in them enough to give it a proper chance, or, even worse, that he didn’t love Steve as much as Steve loved him.
That’s all Tony tries to focus on. Improvisation. The mission.
The music picks up and makes a glissando, effectively shifting from adagio to allegro. It quickly makes its way to a famous jazz theme, and it only takes one second for Tony to recognize which song is being played.
He’s blissfully content.
Feelings.
When Steve looks up at him, he beams his most beautiful, happy smile and says, “Ah, Tony, just in time. I prepared a little something. Did you sleep well?”
In particular, Tony and Steve seem to have committed to it, as if they took an unbreakable vow in Tibet or something. Clint is sure they didn’t move from the Avengers Compound, but he isn’t one hundred percent certain that they didn’t convene a Monk or a Priest to formally bind them to the promise.
Like a scared little kid, searching for protection from the monsters in the closet, under the bed, in his head. Searching for comfort in all the wrong places. Zemo spent over one year in making sure he wouldn’t find that protection.
He realizes he’s been standing in the kitchen without doing anything, so he goes and opens the cupboard. The urge to make himself a strong, black coffee is almost irresistible, but he needs to sleep at least a couple of hours. He decides to go for a chocolate smoothie instead, opting to indulge his sweet tooth just this once.
“Thank you, Steve,” Tony says. “I mean it. For everything.”
Steve sobers up at that, too. He watches him with careful eyes, then bites his lips. “I don’t want to be a bother.”
Steve’s eyes sparkle with something. “Oh, I know you are.” He tries to put innuendo in the words, but he’s just too happy to do a great job. The words are light, and the attempt has Tony laughing, with Steve following him after half a second.
But right now, they’re discussing
He is
“Oh, welcome back to Earth,” Pepper says.
It’s Tony’s favorite.
Tony starts laughing at the same time Steve tries to step away. Tony turns to him and buries his head into Steve’s chest, giggles still shaking his body. “Tony—” Steve says, a little warning in his tone. He has the worst, biggest fond expression on his face.
The watch begins to beep its ten seconds countdown – and seriously, that’s
He knows that when Steve sets his mind on something, it’s almost impossible to make him reconsider.
Tony can’t hide the blush that overcomes him as he mutters, “Don’t mention it.” He grabs his own smoothie and takes another sip.
Tony tries not to pay attention to the way their bodies press together whenever the dance imposes them to. Luckily, the Foxtrot is a demanding dance, and Tony doesn’t have much time to indulge in his thoughts as he tries not to fall or to step on Steve’s feet. It’s been years since he’s danced something like this; it’s a miracle his body still remembers the basic moves without waiting for his brain to give directions.
Steve shakes other Steve’s hand, smiling. Other Steve looks like he wants to keep asking questions.
Before he knows, he finds himself in position, and he has little room left to think about it before the violins begin playing and they start moving like one, Steve leading, Tony following.
Being this close to Steve boldens Tony enough to part his lips and brush his tongue on Steve’s lower lip.
Tony slides his hand in the back of Steve’s head and brings him down for a kiss. He can bear to stop looking into those beautiful, clear eyes only in return for the taste of him, of his lips, of his tongue. It’s a good exchange.
Steve smiles, pleased with Tony’s words. “Just what I thought,” he says, before kissing him again.
Tonight, Tony is going to be able to hold his hand, to kiss him. He’s
Bold of him to attempt talking so soon.
He should have kept the burning throat.
Debrief is hell. He and Steve have to answer the most ridiculous questions. Tony thought the amount of teasing would be fun, but it’s the only thing Clint and Natasha seem focused on, and it’s not funny at all.
He didn’t think he was worthy of Captain America’s love, but that was okay. It
– and takes a deep breath.
For a second, Steve doesn’t turn. Then he does, eyes glimmering with affection, love and a tiny speck of amusement. He meets Tony’s eyes as he squeezes him just so. “It would be my pleasure, Mr. Rogers.”
“Excuse me?” Tony squeaks, and Steve has to refrain from laughing.
Luckily for Tony, his parents made him take dancing classes when he was little. They knew with the life Tony was going to have, there would come a time where he’d have to dance at events like this, and they were right.
dance El Tango de Roxanne.
. They’re simply… Yeah, closer.
He feels Steve smile and hug him tighter once again. “Yes, in a moment.” A beat, then, “Thank you for making me the happiest man on this Earth.”
,” Steve repeats, dangerous eyes staring deep into his, “You’ll be much dirtier by the time I’m done with you.”
“Ms. Potts here was making me notice how the crystals make the blue of your eyes stand out and your glare all the more obvious,” Jan says, still laughing a little.
Soft music is still playing in the background, and it just lulls them both into a content, motionless adagio before they have to move and go home.
Steve notices that the other Steve is smirking and has lost some of the stiffness. He lowers his shield just a bit, and Tony turns his attention back to him. “Really? You choose
The law banning same-sex marriage had just been abolished, and Tony has friends with enough influence to allow them a semi-formal ceremony, resembling a proper wedding even if it can’t be labeled as such, here in New York City.
Steve chuckles. “You like it, babe?” He asks against his mouth, voice rough, and that sends another shiver through Tony’s body. God, he never wants Steve to call him anything different ever again.
When Tony leans on Steve’s body and tenses his leg, Steve’s hand slides down from his chest to his leg, slowly, and Tony can
He takes another sip. “I know. I just figured that, between the two of us, you would be the one to freak out or something.” He tries to sound nonchalant, but if he knows Steve a little – and he does – he knows he’s probably not buying it.
Steve still doesn’t look happy, but nods, reluctantly stepping away.
The physical pain of seeing his own parents getting murdered wasn’t going to be enough –
Steve, though… Tony has a positive feeling about it. Steve would love the visuals, he would definitely benefit from it. And it’s not like he would be a bother, for Tony; quite the contrary, actually. Besides…
“Bed?” Steve whispers on his mouth.
Looking down at Steve’s body in front of him, Tony catches a glimpse of how much Steve’s affected – and good God, his pants are tented obscenely, and Tony wants to have his mouth on him right now. He wants to make Steve see stars. He wants to make him lose his composure and
“Stop it,” Tony breathes. Steve smiles from under him and gently eases down the teasing. He places feather-like kisses on Tony’s stomach, eliciting a breathless moan from the man underneath him every time. Tony’s hand comes up and tangles briefly in Steve’s hair, stroking gently, urging him upwards. The heat from before seems to have left in favor of softer, quieter feelings.
The thought of losing him for good makes his breath falter.
– and shakes Tony’s hand, smiling brightly.
Then Steve speaks again. “But he brought me the paper anyway, because right in the first page, right in the middle, there was a photograph of you. That was the first picture of you I had ever seen. I remember every detail… I remember your shirt, your mussed hair, I remember your smile. It was blinding, slightly cocky, but warm. I remember your eyes. God, your eyes are beautiful. No one has ever managed to get them quite right.”
Steve feels a pang of longing. He already misses his Tony like a limb.
He notices Steve’s eyes widen in surprise and joy, and before he can say anything, Tony continues, “That has always been a dream of yours, hasn’t it?”
That’s how it should be.
And yeah, coming back was going to be easier, because Tony had attached the coordinates for his return to the Tower’s time zone, day and year, so Steve is pretty confident he won’t get back in a whole different year.
, for fuck’s sake. Had it been anyone else, Tony wouldn’t have blinked once.
The man lifts his chin up as he replies. “Steve Rogers,” he says, his eyes glinting with something stronger than admiration.
If Steve is going to laugh like that, Tony won’t even have to pretend to be in love with him.
Before that thought can spiral any further, though, Jarvis says, “Captain Rogers asked me to let you rest, Sir. He asked to be informed as soon as you woke up, so he could prepare something to eat. I reckon you have around half an hour before your meal is ready.”
“Like we don’t all know what that means,” Nat singsongs.
going to ask.
Steve’s right there in his arms.
He takes the head in his mouth and starts to suck, gently hollowing out his lips as he catalogues what Steve likes more, what makes him shudder and moan, what makes him raise his hands as if to hold on Tony’s hair – before lowering them on his shoulder instead, and squeezing.
Tony is pretty sure he’s never going to feel warm again. Biting gusts threaten to whisk Tony’s wool hat off his head in the short trip from his office to the car.
,” he murmurs, and he tries to put into those two words all the meaning he can, because
Like the problem is Steve.
Steve smiles at that.
He feels slightly dizzy, mesmerized by Steve’s look and attitude, and by his gentleness and care. He has never been in this situation before, as
“Immortus, we meet at last.” Tony’s camera persona is up in full force, a fake smile plastered on his face as he shakes hands with the man in front of him.
Sure, since they needed two high profile figures for the job, Steve being Captain America would definitely help and all, but still.
Tony figures they would have to practice a little beforehand, if they wanted to sell it half-convincingly. The thought of kissing Steve only when watched was nagging the back of Tony’s head. The thought of
At some point, Tony snaps at them. “Does anyone care that Immortus ordered a fucking hit on two of his own guests because he clearly thought he could get away with it, or was my tongue down Steve’s throat the only thing worth noticing?”
Tony is adrift, yet he knows his center of gravity is right in front of him.
The watch beeps its one-minute alert, and Steve goes to hug a confused Tony. He’s just adorable, with the Bambi eyes and the slight frown, and he’s so
That oddly looks
The drink in Tony’s hand is the only thing that stops him from grabbing Steve by the hair and grinding into him, feeling his body as close to Steve’s as possible without crossing to public indecency. If it was up to Tony, he would take Steve to the nearest bathroom and fall to his knees in the space of a heartbeat.
In the end, the mission is a success.
Tony and Steve are lazily making out on the sofa in the Tower’s living room.
He wants to hear Steve’s voice saying his name like that all the time. He wants to make Steve lose his cool; get all flushed and glassy-eyed. He wants to whisper filth in his ear and have him shiver and moan for him.
Then he’s being tossed on one side, hard, and it’s just the adrenaline pumping through Tony’s veins that keeps him from landing wrong on his hip.
“That makes two of us today, then,” Tony replies. His voice is thinner than usual, and in any other moment he would find it embarrassing. Right now, he couldn’t care less.
For a moment they stand there, looking into each other’s eyes and breathing heavily.
“You’ll never be anything but dirty,” Steve says.
tonight,” Tony all but leans in to murmur next to Steve’s ear.
together.
“Promise to call me if things get dangerous. Promise you’ll let Jarvis do it, at least.”
It only takes a moment before lips touch lips, and Tony’s whole world shifts balance.
“They’re more used to the fake, lackey kind of compliments,” Tony grimaces. “Like, you know, using the right lingo, hinting you approve of their under-the-rug operations in a subtle way; basically ass-kissing, only sycophantic.”
Tony keeps talking and asking questions and Steve replies the best he can, occasionally memorizing some to bring to his Tony.
The only ounce of modesty he’s got left prevent him from doing so, and instead he attacks Steve’s neck, going to town like he’s trying to make Steve come just by sucking hickeys into his skin.
Someone groans, probably Clint, and Tony loves them all very much, but right now the only person he can focus on is getting up and offering him a hand. Tony takes it and follows him.
,” he mutters under his breath.
Jan told him that the only reason people would look twice at his mask was going to be because of its beauty, and not because it is worn by a man.
He deserves some happiness at least on his wedding day, doesn’t he?
Tony’s eyes would be much more pleased, too.
, if they also ignored their morals, but that’s hard to do, especially in the presence of good old Steve Rogers – and they both know it.
That usually wouldn’t be enough to move him, but Steve takes a step back with uncertainty in his eyes, and Tony barely has time to feel cold where he was pressed against Steve, before he steps right back in Steve’s personal space, effectively moving away from the door.
The motion makes Steve utter a noise that sounds suspiciously like a strangled moan. It goes straight to Tony’s brain, like a wave of shock coursing through his body. Steve’s mouth opens under Tony’s tongue, and just like that, the dam breaks.
Right now, though, Steve is on a mission, so Tony can work unbothered and without having to be on constant alert. Jarvis warning him when someone approaches the workshop isn’t quite enough: he can’t put everything away that quickly and start focusing on something else before whoever it is – usually Steve himself – arrives.
Most times, he knows the answer.
He exhales for the last time before shifting his weight on Steve.
Tony feigns reproach. “I just had a bath, love. Now I’m all dirty again.” In spite of his words, Tony takes his hand to the small of Steve’s back and presses him closer, empty glass forgotten in his hand.
If he keeps that up, Tony’s gonna come in his pants like a goddamn teenager.
Tony’s eyes light up.
“What do you mean?”
Without stopping to thinking about it, Tony falls to his knees in front of Steve.
Tony stares at him, an involuntary smile spreading across his face. “You’d better be serious, mister,” he says.
“Thhny—” Steve tries to murmur against Tony’s mouth.
With this calming mantra in his head, Tony slips on some comfortable clothes, and then heads for the elevator.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t introduce myself,” Steve says. He straightens his back because his legs still feel a bit numb, and looks at the other Steve. “I’m Steve Rogers, I’m from Earth-12041.” He shifts his gaze back on Tony, taking in his wonder and excitement, crystal clear on his face.
Steve is silent next to him for a couple of seconds before tightening his arms around Tony and shifting a little so that they’re hugging properly now.
This man will probably be the death of him.
He won’t let it happen again.
It hadn’t been a big ceremony, with only their closest friends and Avengers teammates there, so they only have to gather a few things and settle a couple of others before they’re allowed to leave as well.
Tony’s breathing is still irregular when Steve lifts himself on his elbows and looks at him.
It’s not like he doesn’t know what goes on when the blinds close. Quite the contrary, in fact.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Tony says, gentle. His thumb draws another lazy circle on Steve’s cheek, and Steve smiles. He turns around to kiss him briefly on the hand.
But Steve…
The thing is, it has been ages since he’s participated in one of these events, and he didn’t attend many even before Afghanistan – he was more interested in science fairs and tech events, rather than shady army conventions and black-market social circles. He didn’t have a lot of experience with this to begin with. And it’s been so long, he’s kind of forgotten what the social customs are.
“I am doing it for solely selfish reasons, just so you know,” Tony says, still grinning, but looking down and up Steve’s body, appreciatively. He has less muscles than Tony, but Tony has always been a sucker for a lean build.
(See the end of the chapter for
be the leader.
He could try to swallow down gulp after gulp of the cheap ambrosia in the bottle on the nightstand, but he’s been there.
Before Steve has the chance to reply, the other Steve takes a step forward. “What are you doing here?”
He asks the other Avengers if he and Steve could sit out the next call to Assemble. He normally wouldn’t do that – hell, he would
. “No.” He scoffs and takes another sip.
When he was a kid, he didn’t like Christmas. Usually, festivities meant extra time with his father, where Howard would show how profound his disinterest in Tony was. They’re some of Tony’s worst memories.
Those words seem to kickstart his brain into sharpness. He knows that kind of talk. “Tony?”
Both Tony and other Steve watch his hand, not taking their eyes off even when he lets it fall. Steve’s fingers move unconsciously to caress his wedding ring, and
He feels lightheaded. He feels delirious.
“That was,” Tony pants in Steve’s mouth. He takes his hands up Steve’s back, his shoulders, before bringing them in his hair and pulling him closer. He steals a kiss, licking Steve’s lower lip before sucking gently on it. Steve moans a little at the sensations, and Tony smiles. He kisses Steve’s lower lip before saying, “Spectacular.”
“Oh my god, this is so good,” Steve rasps.
In the grand scheme of things, what is a little cold dinner, especially when cooked with love?
Yet it’s the only liquid he has in the room. It’ll have to do.
He feels lucky.
That old man is going to be the death of him.
Emboldened by this conviction, Tony tries to push Steve away from his neck to take matters to bed. He has nothing against the strength of the super-soldier, though, so all he manages to do is flex his arms and whimper a little under Steve’s mouth.
Tony is confused for a couple of seconds, as the only instrument playing is a piano. His mind races through the dances he knows – could it be a melody for a Rhumba? Maybe a Freestyle? – before he can stop it from wandering. It’s not like they’re still going to dance, anyway.
, he wishes he had more time here. He’s definitely bringing his Tony, next time.
He smiles and fixes himself a Martini dry. “You’re no fun.”
“I am. But still,” Tony shakes his head again. He can’t keep his lips from curling up, no matter how hard he tries— so he stops trying altogether, smiling at Steve so much his cheeks start to hurt. “Thank you, Steve. Really.”
Ugh. He doesn’t know what to think.
Steve smiles at that. The only reply he gives is rubbing his nose in Tony’s stomach, and Tony promptly laughs at that, shivering from the tickling sensation. He tries to shove him off, but Steve has his whole body as leverage, and the battle is lost for Tony as he fails to stop giggling.
If you ask Tony, that’s very much illegal.
Tony laughs at that. “God, you’re such a monster cuddler,” he grumbles. That earns him a proud smile from Steve, and Tony looks at him and thinks,
Tony isn’t averse to the plan, far from it. He strongly believes it’s a good idea.
Tony thinks about it. They certainly can’t walk out now, in the middle of the party. They can’t risk losing the only occasion they have in what is probably going to be a long time. The body count is high enough already, they certainly don’t need more to add to that number. Besides, both the Avengers and the police are waiting just around the block. They’re all relying on Tony and Steve.
“You really don’t have to thank me,” Steve says. He’s blushing now, and Tony is absolutely smitten.
No matter how many times Steve says those words, they never fail to make Tony’s heart miss a beat. He will never be able to recover when it’s all over, but it’s okay. He was never supposed to, he knew that from the first day.
Clint’s been following the whole conversation with only part of his brain. He’s thinking about seeing Laura, hugging his little ones… That is until one of them mentions his name.
Jarvis confirmed that everyone was away, but seeing it with his own eyes is a relief.
Tony holds his breath as the Waltz slows down to its ending notes, and they come down to their last steps.
“You know, there were gay people in the forties, Tony.” Steve’s laughing behind the words.
“It’s the total blackness of your look,” the man decides to say in the end. “I mean, the only color on you is the blue of your eyes. Not that it’s a bad thing—” he stops. Tony could swear the man’s cheeks just colored a little. “I just mean – if you want to look inconspicuous, you should aim for colors that make you blend in. Like a chameleon. Total black will only make you stand out more.” He pauses a second, then continues. “It does make for a breathtaking sight on you, though,” he adds quietly.
Tony opens his mouth to speak, but before saying anything, he looks at Steve to make sure he isn’t going to talk at the same time. Steve smiles and motions him to go on, so Tony asks tentatively, “You’re sorry…?”
Tony is so happy to spend another Christmas with Steve and the rest of the Avengers that being called ‘the Grinch’ would be disrespectful towards the original one.
There’s nothing sweeter than intoxication by Steve.
Tony is grateful Steve is alive.
Then he turns towards Steve, who’s come a few steps his way. Tony takes an unsteady breath, trying to ignore the tingling of his lips, then bows in front of Steve.
Steve is his husband now, and Tony knows he’s living on stolen time, but it’s the first day of said stolen time, so he feels even more justified than usual to turn his head a little and nuzzle Steve’s neck, before kissing it softly. Steve sighs a little at the touch and holds him closer still, tilting his head just so. Tony can feel the smile on the other man’s face as he gives him a soft, barely-there kiss.
for the first time while being watched was… not how he imagined their first kiss would be like. Not that he ever imagined it.
Besides, anonymity is sort of the point of a masquerade ball.
Like his family.
Things will go on like nothing has changed.
“You know who I am?” not-his-Tony asks in reply.
There’s a soft urgency in the back of the kiss, but Tony doesn’t mind; all he cares about is that he’s finally kissing Steve, and Steve is kissing him back, and the universe is rearranging around its axis once again, adjusting its tilt only for Steve and Tony to become each other’s center of gravity.
Steve strokes his thumb on Tony’s cheek, and smiles. “Goodbye, tiniest Tony,” he says. He barely has time to register Tony’s cheeks color and his eyes widen in indignation, before the reality in front of him dissolves and he’s pulled back to his universe, his world. His Tony.
He owns the posture like it’s second nature, arms and shoulders straight as the dance commends, and his steps have a certain elegance that could only be acquired through experience.
“Hey, it’s not your fault,” Steve says, kindly. “It’s not like you are or were an expert in this kind of stuff, despite what some people might think. Besides,” and he smirks, “you don’t have to be perfect all the time, you know.”
If it was for Tony’s brain, still hyper-fixed on
“It’s the truth,” Steve replies simply.
Immortus doesn’t need to know.
“It’s iced tea, Tony.” Steve smiles. His free hand wanders down Tony’s spine. “You know I don’t drink on the job,” he finishes, hand resting on Tony’s hip.
He needed for Stark to be betrayed by the people he trusted the most. He needed Steve Rogers to betray Tony Stark.
, he says with his eyes, fingers unconsciously rubbing at his wedding ring.
It immediately shifts the kiss from lips on lips to tongue and desire. Tony’s hands roam across Steve’s back, feeling the muscles flex under his fingers as Steve arches in the kiss and grabs Tony’s waist to bring them closer.
Muffled piano notes mark the beginning of the new song, and Tony recognizes it after a couple of seconds. He smiles, heart warming up, and he’s filled with the sudden impulse to go along with the feeling and not squash it down, just this once.
