Nat wrapped an arm over your shoulders and pulled you close, “you did great. It was fine.”
Clint frowned, “you’re the worst.”
Sam shrugged, “basically but we thought you might wanna talk to us.”
Clint chuckled, “how do you fall into the sewer?”
You shrugged and rolled your head slightly, “I don’t think I have a favorite… I’m closest to Sam but that doesn’t necessarily make him my favorite.”
Sam began laughing the minute they were out of the room and then looked to you, “that’s just cold.”
my boyfriend… never. He’s just a guy I’ve been talking to.”
You shrugged, “good if good means my page is completely blank.”
Nat stepped into your room next, eyes glancing over the photos you had hung up above your bed before settling her gaze to yours. “you’re stuggling with knowing who you are outside your family. It’s normal and while you definitely don’t have to figure it out you feel like you need to because you have to write an essay about it.”
MJ clicked her tongue, “I know for a fact he’ll be wearing his ‘trans rights are human rights’ shirt.” Pause. “and probably his rainbow pants.”
The conversation was short and sweet, and it left you feeling slightly better. But then Wanda ended the little connection and you were thrust back into the very loud and very out of control room. Your headache came back immediately.
The video
Tony smiled, “that’s not a bad idea y/n.”
Clint snorted and then promptly shut his mouth after a harsh glare from Steve. He shook his head stiffly, “not funny. Sorry.”
“Hi I’m Y/N Stark-Rogers.”
You swallowed and took the letter into shaky hands. You opened it agonizingly slow and then pulled out the letter. Tears formed in your eyes.
“not worthy of her either.” MJ interjected smoothly, “at this point I’m just waiting for him to fuck up so I can punch him in the face.”
You scoffed playfully, “right, like Clint doesn’t embarrass himself in public on the daily.”
an answer but I’m not gonna say it.”
“We were asking you questions.”
Sam was next, “and obviously no filter.”
You shook your head at him, “Me!”
“and hanging out with.” Peter mumbled with obvious distate. You turned to glare at him
Natasha just narrowed her eyes and cocked her head, “it’s okay Peter. I don’t care.” You fought back your laughter, “do you mind getting me a beer from the fridge? Since your standing…”
You were laying on your bed, lazily scrolling through your phone when Clint, Sam, and Natasha came in.
That’s where the real party began.
MJ took a large sip of her drink before biting in her next hash brown, “you know that James and Sam are following you. They’re a few rooftops over.”
“So how’s the college essay writing going?” Fuck you Nat.
Peter sighed deeply, “they want to watch our truth or drink video and then make fun of us.”
Fuck, maybe your family was right. Maybe this was messy.
“whatever.”
You’ve been snickering every time you catch Bucky not so subtlety looking Clint up and down. But that being said, Clint was doing the same to Bucky because he had someone managed to get the stoic and whiney super soldier into a rainbow button down. Nothing else, as that wasn’t Bucky’s jam. He paired the shirt with simple jeans but you were sure that he would be covered with glitter later.
Peter just grumbled and unpaused the video.
Peter shrugged, “I mean I kinda dated Liz…”
MJ snorted, “figures.” Her hand ghosted over the page again, dragging the pencil with it and creating another addition to her sketch.
You burst into a fit of laughter.
“They’re going to do it anyways, plus they’re also making fun of you which I can’t miss.” You paused for a quick second, “and I have no shame.”
Both you and MJ laughed. She gestured between the two of you, “this isn’t rebellion. We could be at a NYU party right now with coke up our nose if we wanted to. This is chill.”
Peter took a small sip of his drink and shrugged, “I really think it does.”
Peter looked at you with furrowed brows, “are you joking?!” He began to count on his fingers, “I’m tall, I have abs, I have curly brown hair, I wear glasses, I’m literally the definition of a hot nerd.”
“Was this your way of telling us to come to pride with you?” Peter asked.
“hey… I’m 18.”
“y/n?”
Steve frowned slightly, “damn I forgot about that.”
“should I be taking offense to that?” Steve asked as he sipped at his beer.
You smiled into your glass, “Well he can get over it soo… What about you?”
“umm…. You’re old and not cool.”
“are you kidding? They’re gonna shower me with shit to become the favorite or to woo it out of me.”
Steve scrambled to help peter, but mostly everyone was just stunned that you were able to land something on him. Granted, Peter’s spidey sense never really worked around you due to the inexplicable trust he had with you.
You looked around the three of them, “thanks.”
requests are open
Peter nodded and answered quickly, “Thor.”
@tcnyparker commented on tumblr: you should do a sequel with how the avengers react to the video 😂
Wanda furrowed her brow, “but growing up around the avengers is about you. You talk about all the stuff that no one has seen before. Or are you trying to hide who you are?”
“But if it were smaller?” Gwen pressed politely
You were walking between Sam and Bucky when Bucky nudged you slightly. “why did you punch peter?”
“more like the first 30 minutes.” Bucky snorted
You honestly didn’t even care about your exams by the time the week was over. Pass or fail you just wanted to fucking open that letter to calm Peter down.
He painted his shield purple, blue, and pink to show off his own sexuality and support Peter.
Steve stood up and came around to give you one of his signature comforting dad hugs. It definitely made you feel better.
“yeah… he’s an acquired taste.” Sam said, “can I at least be an exception to the superhero thing?”
“I’m not- what?”
“wait! Don’t start without me!” Harley screeched from down the hall before sliding into the room on his socks and hurling himself onto the couch, ignoring the groans of protest. They
Peter smiled, “yes… but I feel like I also radiate more dumb bitch energy.”
“it’s the only one with a vending machine.” MJ helpfully pointed out, taking another large bite of her pizza slice.
You grinned at him, “anytime.”
“yes.”
You clicked your tongue, “Oh Johnny by farrrrr.”
He walked into the en-suite soon after, the letter in his fingers. “hey y/n your letter came- oh wow you guys look great.”
“crowns?”
“then shut your ears off.” Clint supplied casually. A beat of silence, “wait that’s just a me thing. Right, sorry.”
Sam shrugged, “because we’re the only ones without super powers who aren’t emotionally stunted.”
“bullshit! 5 years old, playground 2 blocks over, Arthur Williams.”
After that, the college essay talk slowed down and the normal arguing/conversations settled in. Bucky asked Steve how his day at SHIELD went while Tony and Natasha tried to get Morgan to eat something. Peter had both Clint and Wanda engrossed in a pretty intense debate about who was the most powerful character in Avatar: The Last Airbender. The only person that sat quietly, other than yourself of course, was Sam and he just kept sending you worried glances that didn’t help you settle at all.
You winked obnoxiously, “I can and I did.”
Clint smiled and then put your laptop on his legs and spun to face you, “anytime. Okay so we know family is off the table….”
“look, obviously you’re here because my dads asked you to tail me.”
You laughed and shook your head, “no. Plus only the admissions officers read it and it really could be a hit or miss if they like the avengers so in theory writing about you guys could hurt me.”
“saved my sorry ass? Oh Stevie, have you forgotten who pulled your ass out of every back alley fight you got into? Or have the years 1932 to 1941.”
You shrugged, “It crossed my mind but that just seems like a cope out. The essay is supposed to be about me, and it’s super open so I don’t know why I’m struggling.”
“my dads need to learn to take a no as an answer. Especially about my personal life.”
Honestly, youre not sure you’ve heard an idea worse than bringing home the guy you’ve been talking to/hanging out with/maybe your boyfriend/idk you haven’t talked about it. You didn’t even have an actual label for it and you were already bringing him home?!
Your eyes flitted over Clint. He scoffed, “rude.”
He wore his rainbow pants because they were “super fashionable y/n” and to support everyone.
And yes, those things make me who I am. But ultimately, I am still me.
“I’ll see you on Monday?”
He looked great.
“I’m so proud of you!” Steve cheered as he moved you off the bed and into his arms. Tony came around to join the hug, jumping up and down while cheering.
Bucky had inquired when you would find out from your schools causing you to explain that Peter had ED’d which meant he had priority and found out sooner than you did. It wouldn’t be until April until you found out.
You smiled, “He’ll heal in a few hours. Plus, I’m like the only person he trusts enough for me to do that, I gotta abuse it sometimes.”
“We came to help you with your essay.” Clint said with a smile as he collapsed into your desk chair.
“I am so excited to watch this video of you guys making a fool of yourself.” Clint said with a smile as he jumped over the back of the couch, landing not so gracefully with a bowl of popcorn in his lap.
I find that servers are typically nicer to those they know are rich, especially if they have a reputation of a good tipper. But that is definitely a “burden” I carry with pride.
You just wanted to snicker because that may have been a record. 7 seconds in and you had already disappointed Pops.
Peter stared at you with an offended look. You raised your glass in toast to him and took a sip. Peter answered, “I took the car without asking once. That made them pretty mad but it’s not like I kept it or anything.”
“Harry.”
Peter nodded and sipped at his glass, “good thing that didn’t last long.”
You nodded, sipping your third drink. “good.”
Right as you were about to protest, Bucky chimed in, “neither of you are my father.”
Peter rolled his eyes and sipped at his own drink, “I don’t know about that…”
“of course!” Peter exclaimed
“Not true.”
I’ve been told by those around me that I should write about my family, my upbringing, my time in the foster care. But are those my defining traits?
The family decided it was best to curb opening it until he had finished his exams and for Christmas break to start. Those were some painstakingly long days for Peter, which in result meant you too because he would come to you when stressed or frustrated.
It was a nice distraction for you, of course until your historically noisy family ruined it.
Peter pointed at you harshly, “We’re both doing that and you know that. You’re just gonna be the Pepper Potts in the situation.”
Your eyes rolled so hard, Peter thought you might’ve seen the back of your head. “Oh my god… let it go. Can
Tony rolled his eyes and then looked to his daughter. Thank god Morgan was still too young for all of this. “we were curious when we’re going to meet this boyfriend of yours.”
“What’s so shocking about that?”
Peter looked up from his textbook confused, “what video?”
Peter blanched and instantly shivered in disgust, “ew I don’t need to hear this. Just- ew- bleh no.”
Both your dads quickly moved to pull you into a large hug to console you but it was your hesitatnt voice that stopped them, “I got in.”
Tony made a shooing motion with his hands, urging Peter to leave. “go shower, I’ll save you a box.”
She nodded, “yeah. Thanks for the breakfast dinner, here I can take your trash.”
Tony looked over with a serious expression, “y/n you better come clean right now and not let me find out from a video if you stole something from us.”
Anyways, Ruel always makes the hotdogs with a smile and it makes me feel like he wants to be there. I’m not entirely sure of his life story but I keep meaning to ask him on a less busy day. But whether he works there to make some extra cash, to make ends meet, or because it’s his dream job he smiles through every day.
“I don’t believe that.”
Bucky immediately grabbed for the bag of McDonald’s, searching through the napkins for any food. Sucks for him, you had already eaten everything.
Gwen obnoxiously nudged Betty with her elbow and a large wink, “Oh yeah… she talks to Peter.” MJ scowled at the two as you snickered behind your hand.
Peter’s eyes widened in shock, “fuck! I take it back, it’s definitely Nat.”
You looked at your group and thought ‘
“y/n.”
He tumbled backwards out of his chair, clutching the nose. Wimp, you had barely hit him.
You nodded with a laugh, “Oh most definitely.”
Steve took a step back and grimaced slightly, “it’s kinda… big.”
Bucky clicked his tongue and shook his head in a mix of disappointment and humor, then he asked, “the reason peter doesn’t like brad is because he has a crush on MJ, right?”
Peter scoffed and rolled his eyes, “ok but we were all mutual friends. It wasn’t like I went out of my way to pick one of your friends to hook up with.”
MJ tipped her head slightly, “I’ll think about it. Right now the only exceptions are Wanda, Natasha, and Clint.”
Natasha snickered as she grabbed a handful of the popcorn, “it’ll definitely be good.”
You slumped onto your back, “fine I guess you do get it. But how can you guys help me? You all know who you are, I doubt you’ve struggled like this.”
I like Ruel and his hotdogs and I like the anonymity. But that’s for another essay, this one is about the best hotdogs in Manhattan.
“And to celebrate our 21st we are playing Truth or Drink twin edition.”
“And to celebrate our 21st we are playing Truth or Drink twin edition.”
“no.”
April. 4 more months. Fuck.
You were going to Columbia, you were going to find your place in this world.
You both answered at the same time with the same answer, “Me.” Call it twin-tuition or whatever but it also might just be siblings thinking they’re better than the other.
You were watching the sun slowly lower in the sky, happy to see the colors beginning to turn pinkish.
MJ grumbled slightly, “let’s just get back to work.” It was silent in the room until the three other girls heard MJ mumble, “I never have to deal with this at college.”
And he had a pansexual flag tied around his neck to match with Tony’s pink, yellow, and blue shirt.
You shrugged, “good kisser, better weed.”
Steve’s brow furrowed for a moment and he took a step closer to get a better look, “is that me?”
. And it usually felt like you couldn’t do anything right. There was a reason you spent most nights out and about rather than stuck at home. It was just… suffocating at times. And it wasn’t like you were out doing bad things, maybe a joint here and there, but nothing horrendous.
You rolled your eyes, “no I don’t
Tony turned to him, “I wanna say something like without that you wouldn’t be here but you’re adopted.”
Sam however reaches for the joint and quickly snubs it. MJ gives him an pretty impressive unimpressed look, “dude, there’s like half a joint left there. Can I have it back at least?”
“Dear Mr. Anthony and Steven Stark-Rogers, we are so excited to welcome you into our NYC Pride Parade family. As this year’s appointed Grand Marshals it is both our duty and pleasure to pass the Pride Baton over to you. Included in this letter you will find the rules and expectations of our Grand Marshals, as well as what is permitted for first floats. We would love if you extended this invitation to your entire circle of family and friends to join you in the parade and on your float.”
“Because I’m not about to have my night ruined by a dumb college decision. Whether or not I got in, I’ve already been accepted to great schools. So…” you plucked the letter from Peter’s fingers, “I’m going to open this sometime later and enjoy my night tonight with my friends.”
“You know y/n I’ve been meaning to get you something, let me just go get it from the lab.” Tony scurried off of Steve’s lap and ran out of the room.
“No but at least I’ll be able to get a job.” Oh you wanted to smack the smug right out of his words.
It wasn’t until you felt a small tickle in the back of your head did you even lift your gaze from the table. You met eyes with Wanda and she just gave you a sympathetic smile. She was young, she understood this. She’s had more than one partner scared and threatened by Clint, which in turn means Bucky.
Peter squinted his eyes at the older man, “thinking that I’ve watched you do it, you know exactly how.”
You let out a laugh of your own, “watch the rest.”
Bucky huffed out in laughter, “don’t be mean to the kid.”
“Can’t say.”
“well thank you for the life advice but that doesn’t help me write my essay.” You snarked back causing Sam to sigh.
You also shook your head, “I’m not answering that either… I mean, I
“Best aunt we could ask for.”
He asks about my day and then gives me a smile even if it’s raining. He seems to care in an unobtrusive way which is something I’ve never experienced before.
“you know they mean well.”
“thanks babe. Love you.”
Beside you Peter snorted, “you got into a fight when you were 5?”
“what about the history of pride? Recognizing the Stonewall Riots and the two black transgender females that started it all. Plus then we can also advocate for Black Lives Matter. Make it clear that to support one, you have to support the other. Educate and entertain.”
He leaned his head against the back of the couch and smiled cheekily. As if on cue, Wanda, Sam and Bucky came into the common room. They all sat in various spots around the room and looked expectantly at the TV and then at Natasha when she made no move to turn it on.
You snapped your fingers, “Oh wait! there was one I didn’t like.”
You pointed at him, “Lies!” You chuckled at Peter’s shocked and confused face. You continued, “You are literally dating MJ. She’s my best friend so….”
You clutched your hand slightly and stood up, “thank you all for your concern. I am not bringing this boy here because he would ignore me the minute it was over and I’m done having things ruined because of my last name. Now if you’ll excuse me I’m going to make a McDonald’s run and get some all-day breakfast.”
“ditto?! You fucking respond to that with ditto?!”
The float looked great. The area had already been swept for trouble. One Grand Marshal was moderately drunk. And Everyone was dancing and partying. Perfect.
Peter smiled, “actually yeah…”
Tony’s brow furrowed, “I’m more concerned that you two are just casually sipping at some drinks. No wincing, nothing.”
You looked at MJ with a perplexed expression, “why do you know about my dad’s rainbow pants?”
Peter defended himself first, “are you kidding? I’m literally graduating from MIT the top of my class.”
“MJ, obviously.”
Steve shook his head as he flopped into a nearby loveseat, “actually this was our way of telling you that we need your help coming up with ideas for the float and how to decorate it. But of course we want you to join us on the float, we’ll be inviting the rest of the team as well.”
“MJ already offered.” Bucky gave MJ an approving smile, “he’s not worth it.”
Your family looked at your group and thought ‘
You rolled your eyes, “Cop out.”
Peter shouted, “Me!”
So now here you were, surrounded by your /entire/ family. And they all happened to be talking – read: interrogating – you at once.
Peter shook his head like a dog and smacked his own check lightly a few times, “focus. Back to the question.”
You were now shouting at him, “I’m literally taking over dad’s company when I’m older!”
successful than dad?”
“Well, I do. It’s you.”
Fuck, you were definitely about to get lectured for underage drinking and shit like that.
“And we are here with Cut to celebrate our 21st birthday which occurred one week ago!”
You laughed, “Oh me by like 10000 percent.”
Two more shots down the hatch.
Peter looked at you in shock, “You little menace…” He shook his head in disbelief, “At least I know I’m the better sibling now though because I have never stolen from you.”
pick a favorite aunt or uncle?”
Bucky eyed you warily, “and the upside?”
“yeah it was the only way to get Clint to sit through meetings without leaving to get food.” Steve explained as he stepped into the room and took in the large array of papers everywhere. The four teenage girls that occupied the room were all busy with one thing or another, looking intense and determined.
This time Bucky groaned. “are you just never going to bring anyone home?”
“do we even want to know?” Steve asked, already so over this video.
You giggled slightly as you finished off your second glass, “I think I might be a little drunk.”
Peter shrugged slightly, “I don’t know… I guess Johnny just isn’t my type. Also, Harley is not going to be happy about that. He’s very protective over his friends.”
You grimaced and shook your head, “no.”
You rolled your eyes with a frown, “And I don’t want to tell you… geez. I also don’t want to know when you lost yours.”
He’s a refreshing person to talk to and I don’t think I realized this until I had to write this essay. Until this moment, I just liked the hotdogs. I didn’t analyze why I liked that cart or why I didn’t go to the one right outside the avengers tower.
Clint outright cackled at this. Like hands on his stomach, keening forward, laughter bouncing off the walls, tears in his eyes cackled.
Natasha smiled at the of you before hugging you each, “you guys are ruining my rep.”
You laughed as Nat rolled her eyes, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Peter perked up instantly, shutting his textbook and moving from the kitchen table to the living room where they were sitting. “it did?”
Nat rolled her eyes and landed next to you on the bed, “relax we’re going to help you brainstorm ideas.”
“No it’s not that,” You said as you shook your head, “I can’t avoid that because the common app requires dads’ information and schooling and stuff. Can’t get around being a Stark-Rogers this time.”
You shook your head and stood up, cracking your back. “No, I need a break. What are we having?”
Tony was more than tipsy because Bruce was on babysitting duty tonight for Morgan, so he let himself go and lean heavily against his husband, who just grinned at him all lovingly.
Peter looked to you, “y/n…”
“this just in, you all officially have the coolest dads in history!” Tony bellowed as he dramatically entered the common space, Steve right behind him with a plethora of eye rolls.
You and Gwen snickered because Peter may have said ‘you guys’ but he was staring directly at MJ. In his defense, she did look ethereal in her silver sparkly gown
Peter’s brow shot up, “you’re okay with this?”
Immediatley all eyes snapped to you, causing you to roll your eyes and step forward to grab it. “well thanks for that Peter. I’m waiting til after Prom weekend to open it.”
Bucky lazily gestured, snuggling further into the plush couch. “Banner is at a science conference and y/n is in her room.”
Peter shook his head and sighed, “no.”
The essay you write for your college admissions
Tony bopped the back of your head playfully as he dropped a very rainbow piece of paper into your lap. Peter instantly leaned into your space to read it. You pushed him back with a shove to the forehead. “relax nerd I’m gonna read it out loud.”
Peter shook his head and took a generous sip, “I didn’t want to say it but….”
Peter rolled his eyes, “yeah with a business major.”
They’re thought process went:
“Well we did but then you summoned us to watch the video.” Tony quipped easily.
You rested your chin on your fist as you looked to the ceiling. A finger on the other hand danced around the rim of your glass, your eyes squinting in though.
You shrugged, “yeah but most applications are due November first and I’ll really be screwed if I wait until then to do it. Plus, the sooner I send these in the sooner I’m done with applying to college and then I can really enjoy senior year.”
Peter groaned and threw his head back, instantly reaching for another drink. “fuck, fine you got me. She’s definitely not.”
“I’ll help decorate but Bi-derman is making another appearance this year.”
“thanks.” You smiled lightly at him, then you gestured at the area, “also… this? Stays between us. Everything.”
A distant “hey!” was heard and it caused both of you to laugh slightly. And sure enough, a few moments later Bucky and Sam appeared in front of you two, sitting down casually.
Peter laughed and took one last sip, “love ya sis.”
You laughed slightly, “between just us two or also Harley and Morgan?”
You sighed, “I appreciate it guys… but I don’t really think you get it.”
Steve was quick to follow his actions, “I have something for you to just wait!”
Steve rolled his eyes at you and obnoxiously bumped his hip into your side as he walked out, “I’m not clueless on how to dress for Pride. Plus, I like dressing up for it, it’s fun. And it’s not something we got to do back then. I’m planning on taking full advantage.” And with that he walked out dramatically and closed the door.
“don’t taint his selection with bias!” Betty cried
Harley rolled his eyes, “I was just gonna ask if you wanted me to set it up for you.”
You laughed and shrugged, “I’ve definitely taken money from your room, I steal your shirts and hoodies all the time. Oh I took your iPad for a while… I gave that one back but yeah I took it.”
Your head was resting on your fist, your knuckles digging deep into your cheek. You graoned slightly, picked your head up, rubbed at your cheek slightly, then leaned back in the chair slumping heavily.
“damn straight.” She smiled at you as she took her last drag before snubbing it.
Pride was without a doubt a 100% success.
Peter scrunched his face up, “really? Johnny?”
“yeah Pops I know, I’ve just been working. It slipped my mind and it’s not exactly like I’ve been exerting myself.” You stepped out of the elevator, “I’m fine.”
Gwen smirked to herself, “thanks Peter, you don’t look too bad yourself. What’s that?”
You sat up fully with a confused brow, “you guys? Why?”
MJ smirked slightly, “he wore them to pride a few years ago. Plus, me and peter talk about things. You’re not the only Stark-Rogers twin I hang out with.”
You groaned, “Ugh fineee”
“alright!” Peter yelled quickly stopping the video, obviously remembering what he said. “that’s enough of this.”
“And I’m Peter Stark-Rogers.”
It was Sam’s turn to scoff and then offer sage advise, “are you kidding? I was one of six siblings. I had no idea who the hell I was outside of my sisters growing up, and then I joined the Air Force to help and it did but then I lost Riley and left and the whole thing started over again. Then I was with your pops and then I wasn’t and then I was. And during that whole thing I wasn’t sure if I was a soldier in my heart or just because the captain America was aksing me to do it. It comes in waves and it’s hard to ever know who you are… but y/n it’s
I’ve decided that no, I am none of these things. I am my own person beyond my family and beyond my unusual upbringing. I am a person beyond my past and time in the foster care.
You laughed loudly, a little snort coming out making you cover your mouth and Peter to laugh at you. You shook your head fervently, “No, I’m not just saying this because they’ll watch it. I’m telling the truth.”
Your dad poked his head in with a grin, “dinner.” He glanced at your posture and open computer, “unless you’re working on school. I can bring you something.”
It was the day of Prom when your letter came. You had thrown in on your desk with nonchalance and left to get ready with MJ, Gwen, and Betty. You had commandeered your parents’ large en-suite bathroom for the four of you to get all dolled up.
Peter did a double, almost spitting his drink out. “What?! What did you take?”
“college essay? School just started?” Bucky asked around a mouthful of pizza.
You rolled your eyes, “Well I value dad and pop’s stuff more than yours so me stealing from you means nothing.” Peter rolled his eyes as you thought about the question. “I actually don’t think I have, I’ve never needed to.”
Peter rolled his eyes and pointed at you with his drink before taking a sip, wincing at the strong drink. “one, you’re just saying that because they’ll watch this. Two, this is literally tequila on ice.”
“maybe….”
Bucky grimaced, “please don’t talk about putting cocaine up your noses. It makes me queasy.”
“what about…” Gwen drawled as she typed something and new photo, a larger one, took over the whole wall, “Something like SZA’s?”
Sam grumbles but concedes, handing the joint back. “put it away at least. I can’t be seen hanging around delinquents.”
“when I said organize and coordinate, I didn’t mean take over the conference room we use regularly for avengers meetings.” Steve said with a deep sigh
You picked up your head slightly, “what’s up.”
“took me a while. Also I’m a fully grown adult, I’m supposed to have it together. You're a kid, it’s okay to be still figuring it out.”
You pointed at him, “But that’s not fair! You’ve only had one girlfriend and she’s my best friend.”
You glanced up to see everyone staring at you expectantly. “what?”
“And I’m Peter Stark-Rogers.”
You shrugged and picked at your nails, “maybe eventually. I tried to bring someone home last year. We had been dating for a few months, told Wanda about him and everything. Brought him into the lobby of the tower and he asked if he could get a job here because he knew me. I said ‘probably not’. He shrugged and walked out the door, didn’t talk to me again after that.”
“yeah I don’t think I’ve even done that.”
Peter looked offended, “y/n!”
“I’m trying to remember!” you shouted in the midst of your laughter.
“Oh hands down it’s Morgan, no questions asked.” You sipped at the rum and coke they provided you with, “but between the two of us it’s you Peter.”
“well I know we were young and we were only in it for a year and it was mostly the orphanage but yeah… I remember it.” A heavy silence filled the table. “I mean I am definitely embellishing it a little for dramatic flare but it’s mostly true.” That startled a laugh out of you that then prompted the others to laugh as well.
The room filled with loud laughter. Damn, your parents were predictable.
Bucky rolled his eyes, stretching out his leg and nudging you with his boot. You gave him a questioning look and he gestured to your milkshake and then made grabby hands.
You nodded enthusiastically, “Oh yeah and I know you can appreciate beauty in men so you must agree with me.”
Peter widened his eyes at you, “you have an answer? I honestly don’t think I could choose.”
Peter laughed again and you could see his cheeks get a little pink. Oh yeah… he was getting drunk. “now they’re not because you said that.”
Wanda immediately crinkled her nose, “Christ Peter, you smell awful.”
Peter giggled, “they are so gonna kill you when they see this.”
Peter laughed along with your, “well I haven’t!”
“c’mon kid let’s go back. It’s getting dark.” Bucky stood effortlessly and then extended a hand your way, pulling you to your feet. You did the same for MJ.
“And we are here with Cut to celebrate our 21st birthday which occurred one week ago!”
“ew!” “gross Barnes.” “it actually does.”
Bucky frowned, “I could kill him for you.”
“chill bucket we’ll get to it. You think I wanna miss the reaction the Superdads™️ have?”
Betty laughed slightly, “ten bucks that he paints the shield.”
And fuck did that cuase you to spiral.
You sighed and groaned, “fine. You can take that one.”
“because he’s only with me for you guys and the minute he meets you, I’ll go back to being friendless and alone.” The brutal honesty took the men by surprise. You felt a small nudge at your side causing you to smile, “minus MJ of course. She’ll always be my friend.”
“Well Tony specifically said not too and that he already had something planned.” MJ said before eyeing Steve up and down with the critical eye of an artist, “But we could design something if you wanted us too.”
There was a moment of silence between the group, and while it wasn’t awfully tense it definitely wasn’t comfortable either.
Peter frowned in confusion, “what? Who?”
It wasn’t until after dinner was done, the dishes clean, and the boxes thrown away did you finally escape back to your room. Your family had proven to be a good distraction but your mind was still stuck on your essay and suddenly being around everyone just made you want to vomit. So you escaped.
Sam smiled and turned back to the TV, “yeah I’ll take that. That’s good.”
“oh yeah.”
He took a large bite of his pizza with a shrug, “fell into the sewer during patrol.”
“yeah I know, I pretend to not notice them so I don’t hurt their egos.”
The vendor’s name is Ruel and if he wasn’t a 40-something year old man with a husband and kids I might have thought he was my soulmate. He knows my order by now which I think is a testament to how often I go there. Or it might be because I always leave a five dollar tip for a two dollar hotdog.
Peter threw his hands out, exasperated. “you’ve dated such shitty people!”
Peter rolled his eyes, “the old suit chafes.”
Steve sent you an unimpressed and unconvinced glare but you just continued into the common room to find mountains of pizza boxes, much to your chagrin. You immediately grabbed three slices of pizza and then moved to grab a plate, quickly putting the hot food on it. Peter came stumbling in through a window a minute later, not slowly down til he reached the boxes.
Plus, all your friends had been correct.
To your surprise however, your pops just handed you a letter. The letter you had forgotten about. “You left it in our bathroom before you went to Prom. We assume to wanted to wait til after to open it.”
Sam quickly steered the topic of conversation away from drugs, “Look, I know your dads are overbearing and its obvious that Peter doesn’t like the kid so we get that this whole thing is a lot. But there’s got to be a reason you don’t want him to meet us.”
Peter snorted, “well I’m assuming the answer is yes if you stole from me.”
So you swallowed your pride (and crush) and let Peter ask Harry to Prom, who obviously said yes. So now here you went, simeltaniously watching your brother take your crush to prom and stare at his other crush while she sparkled in under the strobe lights.
crush on MJ. So I think he’s not only using me to get into SI because he really wants a job there but he also wants to get closer to MJ.”
“yep and we’re gonna watch it. We’re waiting for the others of course and your sister but we’re definitely gonna watch it and make fun of you.”
I guess that wans’t fair. You did love your family and you knew they loved you, it was just always so
Bucky eyed Clint with a knowing expression. Clint sighed dramatically, “okay fine I take it back. You’re the best. Thanks for keeping me and buckaroo a secret.”
You were about to rest your fingers back on the keyboard, hoping to write
You took a long sip of your drink, the tequila burning your throat as it goes down. “We both know it’s you so we don’t even have to argue this”
You looked at peter with contempt, “Wow, I bet Harley would help me.”
“he’s my brother and he was annoying me? Do I need any more reasons?”
MJ snorted as Sam groaned and dropped his head into his palm, “don’t need to hear that.”
Tony accepted the still sleepy five year old into his arms, “pizza?” Morgan just slumped against his chest and shook his head. He turned to his son, “what are you writing your college essay about Pete?”
He knows my name is y/n but he doesn’t know that I’m a Stark-Rogers or that I live with the avengers. He knows that my name is y/n and that I order my hotdogs with ketchup and mustard.
I also swear that he dips the hot dogs in crack cocaine, they’re so good. Of course, I know he doesn’t because his hot dog cart is one of the cleanest I have ever seen which also shows his pride in his work.
The Avengers/your family  react to your truth or drink video with Peter and of course they have to make fun of you a little.
“Not since breakfast this morning.”
And of course when you disagreed with your parents about bringin said boy home, they instantly assumed the worst about him, about you, about the relationship.
You grimaced, “I hate this conversation.”
“hey! I take offense to that!” Sam whined
You snorted. Sam looked at you with obvious disapproval, “you know we don’t care if you smoke weed but can you at least not do it in front of us? That way we can at least pretend to be oblivious to all your teenage rebellion and angst.”
“do you want me to punch you in the face?”
want to be apart of. But you certainly couldn’t just leave the room without at least three people following you with worried glares.
“Okay well I like that, it’s simple.”
“No, I kinda of already have a plan too.”
“Oh yeah.” You looked up with a big grin, meeting your dad’s eye. “It’s gonna be great.”
“You know when I made you Captain America, I assumed it meant you were a patient man.” Steve said with a smirk as he settled onto the already crowded couch, Tony quickly taking his spot on Steve’s lap.
Steve paused the video and looked over at the two with an unimpressed look, “we do not have favorites.”
“that’s less than two ounces, worse you can do is fine me is fifty bucks.” Sam doesn’t budge. “dude I thought you were the cool avenger.”
Peter furrowed his brows, “why do you have to think so hard? I feel like it’s a very simple yes or no answer.”
You shook your head, “Can’t take it back now…”
Peter threw his hands up in defense, “no! I do not need to be dragged into that. One of us has to make dads look good!”
“you’ll take not being grounded.”

“What!?
but a knock interrupted you.
And boy wasn’t that a group. Ned, the longtime friend of Peter and boyfriend to Betty. Flash, the ex-bully of Peter’s and newly reformed person who is now an integral part of the group. And Harry, the heir to oscorp and the crush of both the stark-rogers.
“I’ll talk to them.” Sam said softly.
“And I’m graduating from Columbia!” You shouted incredulously
You nodded and stretched your arms slighty as you entered the elevator, “oh yeah I could really go for some pizza.”
“She babysat us all the time when our dads were unavailable or had date night or whatever.” You smiled as you recalled the fond memory.
“That’s the public announcement they put out, turn it over to read the letter they sent us.”
You shrugged, “I’ll answer it no problem.”
Peter rolled his eyes at your dramatics, “well then you girls need to hurry up. Ned, Flash, Harry and I are getting tired of waiting.”
“yes I know that and if you let the video play all the way through, you would have seen that I conceded that point.”
“that first drink was more rum than coke and this one was probably 4 shots of tequila over ice.”
Nat shot him an unimpressed look causing Peter to wither slightly. Play.
Peter smiled a little smugly and sipped his cup with a pinky raised, “I guess I just have good taste.”
“are you kidding me? Steve would kill me if he knew I let you smoke.”
“I’ll take an apology now thanks.”
“thanks for the confidence MJ.” She just smiled cheekily at him.
Sam laughed, “guess not. But it was a pretty solid punch.”
Wanda sniggered, “just let them see it. Worse that happens is one of them kicks your ass during sparring.”
Natasha cackled, “she makes a good point peter.”
“It’s selfish I know, but if they’re gonna use me might as well get something out of it. Ya know?” You sighed deeply, “his name is Brad and he has an
Peter finished off that slice before making a face and turning to leave. It finally seemed like everyone was settled around the table and quietly eating their pizza.
I can see that.” He shook his head. “I’m not that great at reading those kinds of signals.” He closed his eyes briefly and drew in a breath, almost like he was drawing strength from the air. “Like...
“Well,” Tony said, “seeing as you’re so fine and dandy, I’ll just be on my way.  Seems like I have an artificial assistant to reprogram.”
His mind screamed.
Jack ran his hand through Steve’s hair, and that didn’t feel the same either. It was nice.
Tony kissed him soundly. “‘Kay, first off, don’t ever apologize, okay? Ever. Not for this. Not for anything to do with this. And second, I don’t care about the furniture. And third,” he wet his lips. His hand was still in Steve’s hair, still testing its texture with his fingers, still loving its silky smoothness. And now he was nervous. Afraid, almost, because third...third… “What if it wasn’t
Well this is...odd.  Other than Steve treating his oldest bot like a dog – which, to be fair, is not the most inaccurate comparison – Rogers is actually taking it for granted that the robot has feelings.  More to the point, he’s treating Dum-E as if the robot is someone who’s capable of being hurt and making his own decisions.  It’s great that he’d made the jump from “sentient machine” to “something with agency” so quickly, but Tony’s not quite sure what to make of Steve
“Unless instructed not to.”
He’s pretty sure he’s making headway.  Each day when he meets Stark at the bottom of the stairs, the businessman’s eyes get a bit tighter, and his
The suit beside him shifts at that, and Steve can sense the atmosphere of the room brightening. “Yessss. Completely deserved but rewarding nevertheless.”
“You win some, you lose some.”  The silence lengthens, until finally Tony can’t stand it.  With determined nonchalance, he asks “Calling for a reason?”
“So that was fun.”
Steve sits up quickly, his sudden movement dislodging Tony from on top of him.  “What was that?” he asks, staring out at the unusually black New York skyline.  It’s off-putting somehow, as if the absence of artificial light is in and of itself and aberration.  Oddly enough, Stark Tower seems to be immune from the sudden blackout.  The soft interior light from the room allows him to see the faintest hint of his own reflection in the glass.  Still, their own relative good-fortune does nothing to quell his concern.
“Stop this!  I don’t want to hurt you, but you can’t go around bringing statues to life or letting them attack people.”
Dum-E seems all for it though.  The spoiled brat is running his pincer up and down Steve’s hand and Steve appears fond of indulging him.
“If we’re going to do this, we might as well have a view.  Drink?”  For lack of a better option, Steve takes the glass but doesn’t drink.
“No deal,” Steve insists.
If she had a comlink, she’s fairly sure Tasha would be cursing her out like nobody’s business.  As it is, she’s left to imagine what’s going on behind the red and gold mask.
“It’s not,” he answers.  “None of this is okay.  And it’s all right to be scared – ”
He turns to Tony, hoping desperately that the engineer has some better idea.  “Thoughts?”
“You date.” Iron Man insists. “I mean, not successfully, but you’ve definitely dated since we’ve met. I’m not allowed to do the exact same thing?’
“We survived.”
“Yes.  I’m safe, in New York.  With you.”
He still can’t help but find the request a little out of the blue, but when has Tony Stark ever been normal?
“Adjusting?” Fury parrots back.
.  Well isn’t that all sorts of problematic?
He’s never known anyone else to borrow the armor before, but if anyone else could pilot the suit, it would be her. Steve spares a momentary concern for Shellhead and how vulnerable he must be somewhere without his suit, but he quickly shoves that thought aside to tend to the woman stumbling toward him. He doubts Iron Man would have passed on the armor unless it was absolutely necessary, so Steve immediately jumps into his analytical combat mode.
“Damn.” Natasha had said she was busy, but he didn’t know she meant Congress busy. “We didn’t have to do this tonight,” he insists.
love, no matter how improbable or fucking inconvenient it may be right now – with Steve in the first place, because Steve can somehow manage to look at his past and refashion it into something beautiful.  Or was that all a lie too?
“I’ll consider it.”
“You really don’t.”
Tony, you are an adult.  Talk to the man and this will all go away.
Because Steve Rogers is the World’s Most Devious Troll.™  Underneath that clean-cut, all-American exterior is a sneaky bastard who will respond to meddlesome senators’ allusions to Tony’s history in the weapons business with not so subtle references to their own campaign contributions from the NRA.  Pretty soon, people start to get the hint that you do not belittle Tony Stark in front of Captain America.  It’s glorious.  Seriously, if Tony had known Steve was this snarky, he’d have started bringing him to these things years ago.
He stops pacing when he sees a glimpse of red flying in from the southwest, and his eyes fixate on the fast-moving blur. Something is off, but it’s only when the suit draws nearer to the pad that Steve realizes what’s wrong; there’s only one person flying toward the tower.
“Why?”
“Pretty much.”  He’s not looking forward to it.
He means to say I love you.  He really does.  Frankly, that’s how he feel and if any experience calls for a dramatic declaration of feelings, this one does.  That’s really what he intends to come out of his mouth.  Unfortunately what emerges is...
“He said that rebuilding the world was more important than protecting it.”
Steve looks somewhat taken aback at this logic, and Tony feels a brief spark of satisfaction.
“A lot.”
At least he hopes it’s soon.  How far away could the armor’s pilot live anyway?  It couldn’t be too far, or he wouldn’t be available to come when Tony needed him, right?
To: Potts, Pepper
“Less talking, more fighting!”  Natasha calls, shocking some guy in Elizabethan clothing so Iron Man can blast him.  Which gives him an idea…
“Well it just seems obvious when you put it that way,” he concedes.
She flinches a little at that, and Tony can’t exactly read the look in her eyes.  “Are you, Tony Stark, telling me that you’ve been in a relationship for the past three months, and this is the first I’m hearing about it?”  Her voice raises toward the end of the statement, and now she’s looking at him with the beginnings of her Evil Eye.
”  Somewhat shocked to hear the dead language coming out of Tony’s mouth, Steve desperately starts wracking his brain for his pre-serum memories of Latin.
“Yeah, but
“I can see that.  It’s just, you’re usually off to liaise by this time in the afternoon.  Something up with Stark?”
“What?” Natasha asks.
“Let’s do this.”
“It can talk,” Steve says in a hushed voice.
He’s here on the weekend now.  This is getting ridiculous.  Who needs this much overtime?
“Approximately fifteen minutes,” JARVIS answers.
Miraculously, the light passes through him with no discernable effect.  There’s a slight tingling sensation, sort of like the feeling he gets when his foot falls asleep, but other than that, he feels fine.  Nonetheless, he gets the impression that something bad’s about to go down.
Now he just has to resolve on the where the when and the how, but that’s quite a bit more difficult than it sounds. Putting that plan into action is going to be difficult at best and disastrous at worst.
“Umm, to spend time voluntarily in his presence?
It only takes him a moment to make up his mind.
“No, it’s not!” the other man insists.  “Steve, you are the official liaison to Stark Industries, keyword in that sentence being
“I highly doubt that.”
“I…” she begins only to stop, shifting her jaw in consternation. After a few moments, she exhales sharply. “This is harder than I thought it would be.”
“You have a meeting tomorrow?”
Rogers is exceptionally more mischievous than he thought, the little shit.  “Nope, I’m putting my foot down.  Dum-E, hand over the merchandise.”
Well, Steve posits, it was sort of hard not to ‘observe’ after this morning. “I’ll stop if it bothers you.”
Steph feels herself recoil at the suggestion.  “I couldn’t do that,” she answers, her response automatic.
Maria Hill’s slightly staticy voice sounds out of the earpiece.  “Your assailant is on the roof of 104.”
His feelings are confirmed when Clint’s voice rings out over the com line.
From: Stark, Tony
When it happens, it happens quickly.  Later he kicks himself for not thinking of it sooner; Titanic
“Iron Man said you mentioned something like that,” Natasha answers, her voice betraying nothing about her thoughts on the matter.
One of the best things about movie night is that it's flexible enough to suit all participants. When he and Iron Man had first started this tradition, it was as a coping mechanism for insomnia. They'd both grown into conversation, first commenting on the onscreen events, then going off on related tangents until they'd finally reached the point to where the screen served as background noise rather than the main attraction. He and Natasha aren't nearly at that level of intimacy, and Steve mentally curses his friend for leaving him to mediate this very awkward interaction, but the television soothes the situational awkwardness, at least temporarily.
“It could.”  He lets the words sit on the silence before continuing.  “You want to try anyway?”
“Hard time readjusting, huh?”
“Dum-E,” he says takes another bite of his bagel, “what are you doing?”
Of course, these meetings would be a lot more productive if he wasn’t working with a fraction of the team.  Clint and Natasha are amazing assets, but they’re admittedly the least enhanced members of the Avengers.  The strategy sessions would be much more effective if they addressed the strengths and weakness of the
“Google?”  He stretches the word into two long syllables, and his voice rises on the second half.  Seriously, this isn’t rocket science.  “Here, just give me your phone.”  Steve still looks skeptical and a bit confused, but he still lets go of Dum-E and reaches into his back pocket and –
, who is both the world’s biggest nerd and the sweetest guy he’s ever met.  All the things that people usually loathe about Tony – his snarkiness, his know-it-all attitude, his frequent tech fugues – Steve actually seems to
“Every waking second.” Steve wishes she was being sarcastic, but the tone of her voice has him thinking that she’s being deadly sincere.
“Excuse me?”
“Experience.  Now spill.”
“Umm, have you met me?  Calm and rational are not typically adjectives people use in my presence.  Unless they’re telling me to be calm and rational.”
“So this is it?” Steve asks.  “When you mentioned that you wanted to rebuild, this is what you were talking about.”
The glass doors part with a slight
As he finishes the long, twisted story of his interactions with Steve, he looks up, hoping to find sympathy and a bit of encouragement from one of his best friends.
After a good thirty seconds of yelling at Steve’s inert figure, Tony finally loses it.  He can feel the tears running out of his eyes, but none of that matters now because Steve is dead and gone and never coming back.  All the promise of what might have been is growing cold on some lonely street in Chinatown, gone before it even has a chance to get off the ground.
That doesn’t mean that Steph has to like them.
“Not.  Leaving.”
“A consequence of being brilliant is that you always think you’re right, and Stark has been the smartest person in the room since he was about eight years old.”
“That won’t be necessary; I monitor all of Sir’s outgoing calls and texts.  I assume you are referring to the image of the possum Sir sent you earlier this morning?”
“Lose something, Cap?”
“That still doesn’t explain why no one can seem to work with him.”
, and the impact reverberates through his shoulder and right side.  He uses the momentum to complete the rotation, flips over, rolls to his feet, and turns to face Natasha.  Despite having just tossed him to the ground for the umpteenth time, she looks remarkably poised.
“I said do not engage!” he screams out, knowing in his head that it’s too late.
I do?”
“No, I think I learned my lesson.”  Steve reaches into his bag, and pulls out his laptop.  “I just brought everything from yesterday.  I didn’t know what exactly you wanted me to do, so I figured I’d best grab everything.”
“Well, now, that’s up to you. Ideally, I’d like to get you out there working. Frankly, you’re capable of things that none of our other agents can do, and you’d be a hell of an asset. But I can’t do that until you get your head in the 21st century.”
“Sir Agent Hill is on the line.  She wishes to inform Iron Man that – ”
Tasha looks appropriately stumped by the turn in the conversation.  She blinks.  “What about her?”
“Steve...do we know a Steve?”
Steve is an amazing guy.  Not only is he some sort of cross between and Abercrombie and Fitch model and Adonis, but he’s just generally a good human being.  It was easy enough to feel physically attracted to the guy, but now that he knows Steve, holding back his feelings is just that much harder.  Because Steve is the guy who tilts his head when something confuses him.  He plays fetch with Dum-E and magically produces coffee when Tony needs a mid afternoon boost.  He sits on the couch and sketches while Tony babbles to himself about subatomic electromagnetic pulses.  Hell, Steve had convinced Tony to incorporate Elvis and the Four Seasons into his previously perfect queue of lab music!  Honestly, that right there should have tipped him off.
He knows he’s going to need a bit of assistance on this one.  Not bothering to look up this time, he speaks aloud.
"How many fake dates have you been on, then?” he replies.  He aims for a light tone, but he’s pretty sure the delivery falls somewhere closer to rueful.
Holding up a statue that’s got to be at least over a thousand pounds seems to require very little of Steve’s attention.  Instead, he rotates his head to look at Tony, his eyes blown wide with panic.  “Tony, I – ”
From: Stark, Tony
Okay, it’s is turn.  He mentally braces himself and then starts talking.  “I agree with Pepper, though.  And you.”  Tony face has effectively frozen, but he forces himself to keep going.  “We sort of have been…”
“Never really goes away does it?”  Although if you’re really lucky, something even more terrible will come along to displace the bad memories.  There’s nothing like a wormhole to crowd out terrorists.  It’s so nice to have variety in your panic attacks.
“Well, now’s the time to start,” Natasha looks at him with something like pity in her eyes, but her voice is a sharp as ever. “Okay, first rule of undercover work: do not volunteer information.”
uncomfortable, but that’s hardly Tasha’s fault.  And it’s certainly not for the reason Tasha thinks.
It’s the two Avengers on the couch, though, that draw the bulk of his attention.  He recognizes Tony Stark from the plethora of science journals, press releases, and tabloid covers spread over the last two decades.  It’s only recently that he’s learned to equate the infamous playboy of New York with Iron Man, and hadn’t
After a moment, Ana’s all-knowing voice rings out of the phone.  “According to Webster’s dictionary, a sugar daddy is a wealthy, usually older man who gives expensive gifts to someone much younger in return for companionship or sexual favors.”
Whatever Tony sees in his face settles something, because one he’s staring into Steve’s eyes with a question, and the next he’s pulling Steve toward him.  Their lips meet with a quasi-violent crash, but once Tony has a moment to adjust…
“Certainly, ma’am. Have a nice evening.” JARVIS’s voice blips out and somehow leaves the room emptier despite having a physical body.
“Mr. Stark sends his apologies, Dr. Banner.  He would have met you at the airport himself, but he was unfortunately detained by the arrival of an unidentified alien species.”
“Well, a distraction would be nice, if only to keep me from getting electrocuted on the way in.”
“Hmm?”
“I know, Steve.  I know.  If it helps, the decision wasn’t a unanimous one.  Besides, the choice is out of SHIELD’s hands now.”
“But I do.  And I take it from your reaction and the five takedowns I’ve made in the last thirty minutes that that talk did not go well.”
He pulls his phone out of his back pocket and checks the lock screen.  Tony’s usually texted him by this time in the morning.  Sometimes it makes no sense and he has to conduct several internet searches before he can make sense of Tony’s text speak, but they’ve usually established contact by this point in the day.  Sure enough, he’s got one unread message.
But that’s not a discussion they should have over text.
“Steve, we are going to have
“He’s a menace,” Tony replies, not willing to let Dum-E get away with being a complete and total brat.  “He rarely does what he’s told, and he frequently breaks my things.”  The bot shrinks a little at that and draws even closer to Steve.  “Great!” Tony exclaims, gesturing toward his cowering bot.  “And now he’s a traitor.”
Sincerely,
In the small portion of his head that’s not spinning in circles, it makes sense.  No one on earth has muscles that pronounced naturally.  Nope, those things are bonafide wonder of scientific engineering.  But it’s deeper than that.  The more he things about events of the last month or so, everything starts to fall into place, like the pieces of a puzzle he didn’t know he was solving.  The broken window.  Not knowing how to use a laptop.  The lack of cultural familiarity.  Christ, he’s an idiot for not solving this sooner.  No one’s can possibly live in New York and be that naive, technophobia be damned.
“But that’s…No. No! I’ve seen the two of you together. Just last night!”
That’s when the alarm starts going off.
“Yeah.”
“Most certainly not!” JARVIS insists, and it’s all Tony can do to repress a snort.  His favorite AI butler isn’t going to respond well to that comparison.  “Dum-E is a robotic entity with a concrete physical form and rather limited processing facilities,” JARVIS continues.  “His primary function is to assist Mr. Stark during hardware construction.  While I do not occupy a physical form, my computing powers are exponentially more advanced, and I am consequently capable of conducting a vast array of functions.”
“Thor,” he nods and reaches for his shield.
Which is the entire crux of the issue.  Despite having practically no experience at relationships, he knows that it’s probably not a good idea to start one out on a lie.  He’d been willing to compromise a bit if it meant he’d have a chance with Tony, but Tony seems…he doesn’t know what to call it besides reluctant.  Aside from their one conversation after the alien in Central Park, they haven’t really addressed idea of being a couple.  The only difference between “dating” and “not dating” that Steve can see is that they sit a couple of inches closer when they’re eating, and he lets his eyes linger a bit longer before turning away.  That’s all on him, though.  Tony hasn’t done anything remotely out of the ordinary, except maybe being a bit too peppy.  Their interactions are
It’s not a term he’s familiar with, but the construction is fairly simple. “Fear of...technology?”
Subject: RE: Complete and Utter Betrayal
Steph grins ruefully, thinking back to their first interaction.  “I might have spoken too quickly.”
There’s a moment when he thinks he’s gone too far – silence in the room is deafening – but he allows himself to hope that maybe, just maybe, he hasn’t screwed everything up.  He’s just about to say something when Tony
The woman frowns.  “But they want to move!  Can’t you feel it?”
It takes Steve about two seconds to make up his mind.  He’s just about to answer yes, yes please when a sudden noise catches his attention.
, and Steve is a person he really wants to keep in his life.  Consequently, however foolhardy the decision may be, he needs to come out and fess up about his knowledge of their secret superhero lives (Christ, it even
“As long as you don’t talk your girlfriend into building you a Death Star.” Steve is proud of the way his voice doesn’t trip over a certain loaded word.
Most people don’t know it, but blackout glass doesn’t technically blackout the lab.  It could, of course – he designed it after all – but more often than not it’s more beneficial to watch the reactions of the people he’s locking out.  Default blackout mode, then, works more like one-way glass than an actual partition, and he can see everything Agent Stalker is doing.
Tony looks very, very confused and acutely uncomfortable.  “Run that by me again?”
But, miracle of miracles, Natasha does make it back.  One moment she’s falling out of space, limp and unresponsive, and the next she’s lying in the middle of the street joking about schwarma like she didn’t just save the lives of several million people.  Steph has no idea what schwarma is — turns out, it’s pretty good — but she figures Stark’s earned it, no matter how cocky she might be.  As the six of them cluster around a table amidst rubble and debris, Steph subtly tries to take stock of the woman she’s known less than forty-eight hours, yet has somehow ended up fighting alongside.
“The three of us…” Natasha trails off. “Actually, it might be good for you to have the three of us all together. I mean, good for the three of us. To spend time. All of us together.” Steve doesn’t quite understand the need for the qualification when Natasha concludes, “I'll try to pop in for a minute or two.”
Steve tries to make the most of it. “He doesn’t try to blast rock music at an insane volume?” he asks.
“Can you? Take it in?”
It’s the
Steve straightens as he prepares for the question he’s about to ask, although he’s not sure what purpose that serves.  What exactly is the protocol for addressing an artificial intelligence?
Tony has nearly died on a frankly incredulous number of occasions now, so he knows that whole life-flashes-before-your-eyes thing is total BS.  However, that doesn’t stop his brain from cataloging what happens next in minute detail.
Tasha still shoots off at the mouth mid-fight, but either Steph’s losing her mind or the dialogue has grown on her.  More importantly, Tasha’s always where she needs to be when the situation calls for it, delivering a well-timed repulsor blast to the latest evil murder bot of the week, more often than not, just as it’s about to take a shot at Steph.  It’s nice to have backup, particularly when the circumstances are less world-threatening and more annoying.
art, and, if his nasty-if-not-entirely-inaccurate little caricature is any indication, he draws himself.  So long as Steve’s happy, he resigned himself to putting up with anything for a couple of hours.  After all, the goal of the evening is to get Steve in as good of a mood as possible so he has a reason to stay.  For that, he can put up with a few hours of boredom.
He may have gotten lucky.  Tony’s sheer horror at his lack of familiarity with technology seems to have temporarily overwhelmed his power for speech – which is no easy feat, Steve thinks.  After several multiple attempts to begin speaking and some impressive eyebrow acrobatics, the other man finally starts talking.
Yes, everyone in this city owes an unpayable debt to whoever’s in that armor.  What he did was unspeakably brave, and it takes a certain brand of courage to fly into the dark knowing you’ll never come out.  But heroes don’t operate in a vacuum.  More often than not, they just end up getting credit for what’s essentially a group effort.  In reality, they’re only as good as the people who keep them going.  So yes, Iron Man saved the city.  But you’re the one who made him fly.”
Steve goes suspiciously quiet and his face stills.  Tony, on the other hand, stands up.
“Tony!”  Steve – because apparently Captain America’s cool with disclosing his civilian identity now – cuts in quickly, his face fire-engine red.  The remaining Avengers seem to take no heed of his discomfort; Natasha and Clint exchange a knowing look while Thor just radiates his typical good humor.  Stark looks far too pleased with himself.
, but this latest episode is disproving all of his theories.
“Look, Steve, I’ve gotta know,” he starts.  “This whole thing – you coming here, worming your way into my good graces and asking me out – that’s not a SHIELD thing, right?”
From the rubble of his previous schema, Tony can only draw one conclusion; Steve loves him.  Steve
“Yes, Steve, believe it or not, I understand the concept of owning multiple properties. Freakishly well, actually. What I don’t understand is why you’d choose to run to this little hole-in-the-wall when you have 10,000 square feet of space tailored to meet your super-soldiered needs smack dab in the middle of one of the most expensive and fascinating cities in the world!” She crosses her arms and her tone goes defensive. “You never seemed to have a problem with it before.”
“Alter boy,” Steve explains.
Steve’s brain scrambles to connect the two ideas:  Tony’s upset and the armor’s damaged.  Is Iron Man okay?  He seemed fine as he flew away, but it’s really hard to tell under all of that metal plating.  He waits for Tony to come to another stopping point before he speaks out, trying to jab out his question in the brief moment of stillness.
“Well, great, glad we both agree on something,” she says, her voice drifting off into a mumble at the end.
Conceptually, Steve had known what he was getting into, but his mental projections don’t nearly do the scene justice.  To start, the Alice in Wonderland statue isn’t just a sweet little depiction of a young girl.  Nope, this thing is an eleven foot fall, larger than life cast of not only Alice, but the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, and a bevy of other fictitious creatures.  All of whom are moving.  The best he can tell, the giant bronze Alice is gently stroking a...mouse?  Weasel?  It’s been awhile since he’s read the book.  Whatever it is, it’s three feet long and terrifying.
“Well, I think we managed to win the conversation, so I’d say it was a success.”
“I know!” Tony cuts in, his voice finally breaking through Steve’s panicked rant.
Steve immediately understands everything Stark’s not saying.  He’s been on the front lines and seen the life-or-death decisions medical personal have to make in the heat of battle.  Sometimes a person who would have lived under normal circumstances doesn’t make it, simply because the doctors don’t have the time or the resources to spend when they could be helping someone with a greater chance of survival.  But that’s battlefield logic.  It shouldn't happen here.  Not now, and not in New York.
“Because…” he struggles, trying to put into words something he hasn’t fully wrapped his head around yet.  “I just...I like him, okay?”
“That’s the thing though. I’m not quite sure that you are.”
“Hello, Earth to Steve.”
“You never thought about piloting it yourself?”
“Natasha.  You mean Black Widow?”
The room is relatively minimalistic, if luxurious.  Aside from an obscenely large bed, a single nightstand, some abstract looking wall art, and a mini-bar spread out along one wall, there’s nothing much here, and the space looks less like a room and more like an extravagantly priced hotel suite.  He gets the feeling that Tony doesn’t exactly spend a lot of time in this space.  Why he’s taken Steve here, he’s not exactly sure.
“You almost died!  You fell out of the sky.”  Steve vividly remembers that day pressing against the motionless suit, trying to find a way to pry apart the armor in order to check on the man inside.  That man was
“Tony,” he cuts in.
Steve chugs his water and tries to think back over those brief couple of minutes.  “I told him exactly what Fury said.  Stark signed a contract, and it’s his responsibility to live up to his end of the agreement.”
“I know that you and I have never really spent that much time together,” he starts, which is putting it mildly at best. “But Iron Man is my best friend, and I think it’s important that the two of us get to know one another better.”
“No!” Steve exclaims, suddenly worried that this friend has somehow been a silent witness to his innermost thoughts. It wouldn’t be the first time that the two of them were almost eerily in sync. “Why would we have a problem?”
Steve takes a long look and the broken head and realizes that the head is the same face he sees on the ten dollar bill.  Fantastic.  He’s symbolically guillotined Alexander Hamilton.  On a normal day that might bother him, but his threshold for discomfort is pretty high at the moment.
“You’re picturing Tony in that outfit, aren’t you?” Clint sounds smug.
He tracked down to this room by systematically asking JARVIS questions until he could figure out what exactly the AI wasn’t tell him.  Sometimes he forgets how similar Tony and JARVIS are and has to remember that Tony coded him from scratch, so of course they are similar in the ways that aren’t obvious because Tony wouldn’t see that and make it different.
Clint and Sam had been for it, Natasha had warily agreed, and Tony...Tony had been concerned,  Hiding it well, but concerned as they made their way to South Africa. Something about today had made Steve’s gut roll, so he had asked.  Half to get Tony back in the fight. He knows Tony had promised himself no more after seeing his family get hurt
before pushes it all down.)
Steve shrugs.  “I actually insulted him when I first met him.  We got on a little better as it went on, but we parted on pretty rocky terms.”  Sam keeps eyeing him, and Steve adds, “I haven’t seen him since Manhattan and whole aliens coming from a hole in the sky thing.”
That quiet again, that pregnant, waiting quiet.  “What do you want from me, Tony?”
Then Steve’s voice in his ear. “Yeah, this is Steve Rogers?”
OCTOBER, THURSDAY 1:00 AM
“Shh.  No more.  Just let it go.  It’s over.”
“Uh-huh.”
Steve sat down on the sofa. He put his elbows on his knees and rubbed his face tiredly. He was exhausted. Hurt. Like his heart had just been pulled out of his chest, and then sent through a shredder for good measure. And it was his own fault. He knew it. He didn’t blame Tony. Tony who had been so good to him. Who had treated him with such love and care over the last months. Who never saw him as ‘mediocre’. Tony who deserved every good thing that this life had to offer.
“Yeah,” he said slowly. “Tense.”
Tony grunted.  Took another drink.
When Tony fell silent, Howard nodded his head. “I understand why you feel that way, kiddo,” he said. “Christ knows, you’re entitled to it. And I will go.” He put his hand into his pocket and brought something out. Something small. A little coin-shaped thing. He held it clasped in his hand. “I’d like to give you something first, though. If that’s alright?”
Tony sat, weighing other questions in his mind.  Strange wouldn’t answer all of them, and if he lost his patience with Tony, he wouldn’t answer any of them.  He was working on borrowed time here with the good doctor, and he knew it.
could-”
Steve opened his eyes in the dark.  Tony felt his look and opened his own.  “That’s okay, right?” Steve asked.  His face was serious, his eyes dark, those three worry-lines between his brows.
He curled his fist into Steve’s shirt and kissed his chest.  “Besides,” he said, “I believe you promised me an eternity.”
Steve shook his head.  “Nothing.  I just don’t see you with kids much.  It’s nice.  You’re good with them.”
Howard shook his head, disgusted. “Fine,” he said. “Fine. Five minutes. That’s it.”
He was starting to drift off again, when Tony said, “Well?”
Tony opened the door, and pointed down the hallway. Steve carried Morgan to her bedroom. It was a happy room. All yellow and red and pictures she’d colored tacked to the wall. It made Steve feel good just being in here.
“Tony was always good to me,” he went on. “Always treated me like I meant something.” He finished his drink and licked the last of it from his lips, watching Tony watch him. “Even when I didn’t deserve it.”
Steve looks at Nat, feeling panic crawl up the back of his neck. She regards him for a moment and then says, “Thor. You'll sit with him, won't you?”
He asks Tony about it one day in a now rare phone call.
“She’s taking the CEO spot back,” Tony says.  “Not a moment too soon. I’m about to strangle the board.”
He rolls into the momentum and yanks out the pool stick from the guy’s hands, throwing the other man off balance.  He kicks out, taking out the guys right knee. As the man goes down, Steve snaps the cue easily. He tosses it out of reach as the man gets up and swings wildly, limping.  Steve leans before grabbing the guy’s arm and pulling it back, just far enough that it hurt.
“Okay looks like we’re connected, “ Tony announces.  “I’m doing some digging, but it will take me a little bit.  Give me the time it takes you to get back to the jet before I have a lead on you, but it does look like the computer was turned on a few days back.  Trying to trace what was looked at then before I do a wider sweep.”
Then, Steve thinks of Bucky running scared, trying to stay safe.  How he’s gotten better at avoiding media. He’s had to learn to be scarce.  He knows he is being hunted. Steve’s heart hurts at the images he can conjure up all too easily.
Tony nods at him before lifting off and turning to the HYDRA agents remaining.  “Okay, now I’m just pissed,” he vocalizes before shooting up the hummers. Steve watches as they flip, trapping men underneath them.
Clint rolls his eyes, “You always say that.”
You think he is remembering?
Steve straightens and looks around.  “Video?” he shoots back.
JARVIS send him a text 72 hours later with a picture an a question.  It’s a pixelated image of a man hunched over, a hood pulled over his head.  But his head is turned just so, and it may have been years - decades - since they have stood in the same space and known each other, but Steve knows Bucky’s cheekbones, the line of his nose, even the familiar bags under those distant eyes.
“That’s bullshit, Steve, and you know it.”
“Well,” he said, “it’s not
Steve smiled.  Strange didn’t know it, but it was Tony’s favorite little half-smile.  The one that made him fall more in love every day.
“Happy?”
Steve’s stomach fell, but he kept his grip on the phone.
Steve sighed. “I don’t want to have to ask.”
Just fine.
Unable to help himself, Tony let his hand trail up the middle of Steve’s back, then up into his hair. It toyed with the curve of his ear, then smoothed the soft hair at the back of his neck. He knew he shouldn’t be doing it. He knew this was just inviting danger, but he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t, and he really didn’t want to. He knew it was wrong. He knew. He
“I think that’s when his depression really set in.”
“He’s not going back to The Raft,” Tony said.  “He’s in a military installation instead.  In Jersey.”
“You could take one of us back to the dumpsters,” Steve said.  “I’m sure somebody will come and pick
“I don’t know, Tony.”
Tony looked down at the typed words.  They swam together into a blurry blotch, and he grunted.  He squeezed then shut, rubbed them, and tried again.
Ross sighed.  “There’s a Glock in the bedside table.  And a Derringer in Lydia’s.”
“Must be rough.”
, Clint.”
Steve lost the frown but he kept the curiosity. He wasn’t worried. He didn’t really care if Howard was upset or angry. He hadn’t
“Morgan,” Sarah said, coming up behind him. “Isn’t she beautiful?”
Steve squeezed him, giving him the love and support he hadn’t been able to give him the day Morgan left. “How was that?” he asked quietly. “Were you...How bad was it?”
“Why wouldn’t she?” Steve asked, moving a checker.
“I”m right here, baby.”
Steve bent his head to kiss Tony’s neck. “Better get over there,” he whispered into his skin. “She’s waiting.”
“I did,” she said, and pulled back to look up into his eyes. “And now I’m thanking you. You introduced us. Remember? That night?”
“There’s juice too, you know,” he said, and she groaned.

Rogers.
“They’re really okay.”
He shrugged, that dimple teasing in and out of existence. “You,” he said, and Steve blinked at the plain way he spoke. The guy smiled again. “I’m Jack.”
Was it wrong to hope she wouldn’t call?
Tony smiled up at him. “Hey.”
say ‘convalescent’?”
“Me too, baby.”
"They're probably yours," Steve said touchily.
“We can do whatever you want.”
Steve's gaze turned troubled. “Why did he want to, Mom?”
There were a few children, as well.  The rule seemed to be relaxed for the kids because they were climbing over their dads’ laps, fussing on the floor, being passed from one parent to the other.  Tony couldn’t help but smile at a solemn little blonde drawing a picture at the next table.  She turned it so he could see, and Tony gave her a silent thumbs-up.  She nodded once with a formal dignity, then went back to her crayons.
slept in nine years. Have you?”
Steve took another step back.  His back was pressed against the wall now.  It really was a tiny room.  “Yeah, but I can’t jerk you off and talk at the same time.”
Tony closed his eyes, took a deep breath.  “Maybe I should call Strange.”
want to. He had wanted to ever since he’d kissed his cheek. “Okay.”
Steve nodded.  “I deserve that.”
Tony ran his hand through Steve’s hair. He could do that all day. "How do

“You’re not serious.”
“Let’s go then.”
He flew to Chicago instead, picking it because it was
guy. He wasn’t entirely sure how that had happened. Or how this somewhat spur-of-the-moment shopping trip inspired by a lunchtime text from Steve that consisted of no more than two little symbols-- <3 --had devolved into this mess he had going on here right now.
“Call an ambulance!” he yelled, but the kid was already on his radio, yelling in their location, telling them there was a man down, shots had been fired, self-inflicted wound, so get here
Tony inclined his head until their lips met. It was brief, soft, sweet. “Buffalo.”
, he thought distractedly, and then he saw Sam walking toward him, and his shaking hands stilled.
“I don’t know what I want,” Steve said.  “I just wanna feel you.”
Tony watched him go.  He wanted to say something, wanted to go after him, but, for the moment at least, he was powerless to do either of those things.
Even though the three men in this small doctor’s office were talking all around him, and
He let himself into his mother’s apartment around eleven o’clock. Dodger met him at the door. He didn’t bark, but his entire body wiggled with happiness, his bottom half going one way, his top half going the other way.
“So,” Tony said when Steve put the last plate away, “how’d I do?”
“Maybe,” he said, “but that doesn’t change it.  He needs to be with you, and I think you need to be with him, too.  It’s important.”
Steve shook his head. “I didn’t want to wake you up.”
“So did I.”
“That makes me responsible for you,” Tony said.  “That’s what the Chinese say.  You save a life, you’re responsible for it.”
“No,” she said, her eyes cutting to Tony then back again. “No, just come pick me up. I’ll be ready at five.”
Tony turned the radio on too loud, and they drove home, neither one speaking a word as the road unspooled behind them. Steve just watched the scenery pass by. They were the same tall pines and close, lush, green underbrush as when they came up, but it didn’t seem as magical now. Now it seemed darker, scarier, more sinister, and he was glad when it started to recede. When the city started to reassert itself. When the billboards popped up, and the first warehouses came into view. When the skyscrapers showed up on the horizon. The traffic got worse. It was what he was used to. It was home.
“Well, whose fault was it then?”
--rub his temples with his fingers, slowly trying to let his eyes adjust to the change in the light.
“Are you ready to go?”
“Well, okay then,” Tony said. “That’s settled.”
Steve nodded and grasped Tony’s hand in his for one brief, exhilarating, breathtaking second before letting go. “Well,” he said, still smiling gently, “thanks for doing it. I was...pretty lost for a minute there. Thanks for bringing me back.”
“That’s ‘cause he was sitting next to Nat,” Steve mumbled. That fuzzy, soft feeling was starting to return. That sensation that made him feel both heavier and lighter. Made him feel like he was both tethered to the ground, and simultaneously soaring high above it. He welcomed it. Embraced it. “He likes her.”
Sir Purr opened his eyes, glanced once at Steve, then hopped lightly down from the table and left the room.
And Sam chose that moment to kick him back.
Steve found himself smiling back. He knew this was messed up. He knew. He just couldn’t seem to help it. “And it’s Steve.”
“Before he snapped.  And then when he did, they could show the world what a monster he was.  And then they could get rid of him.  That’s what they wanted, Tony.  They just wanted to get rid of him like an old, worn-out shoe.”
When he was done--when they were all done--they went back down to the church and watched Bucky and Nat climb into their waiting car. The reception hall wasn’t far. Steve walked. He didn’t have a car. He had finally gotten a license, but he still didn’t see the point in driving. Not here, anyway.
sweet and warm. He ran his hand over the space where Steve lay down at night, the cooling sheets smooth beneath his fingertips. He’d never really thought about the bed before. He’d used it--in a lot of different ways--but he’d never thought about it. He was thinking about it now. About how it wasn’t just his bed anymore. That it was
Steve let out a breath. He was right. Steve knew he was right. It didn’t matter how much he tried, he could never allow Pietro full access to his inner heart. It was too full already. Too full of memories. Too full of pain. Too full of the love he didn’t want to feel and couldn’t forget. And too full of the knowledge of just how pitiful that was. How pitiful
Everyone laughed, and Steve asked, “What did they say?”
Luckily, he knew exactly what he had to say.
Steve shrugged again. He pet Dodger’s head with tender, gentle fingers. “If you want.”
He felt the elevator slow down around him and looked up.  It was too soon.  The light was lit for the 40th floor.  Tony’s private floors began ten above that.  He pushed the button again.
“Can we go for a walk?”
“Yeah.”
Steve was being pulled away.  His hair fell over his forehead in a tumble.  Tony thought he had never looked more beautiful.  “It was worth it.”
It was the picture Steve had been sketching, of course.  He must have worked on it while Tony got ready and drove into town for dinner that night, because he was looking at a finished piece now.  The Bentley, though on the far right in the picture, was obviously the focal-point.  Steve had recreated it in loving detail.  The beach, the dock, the trees, were mere suggestion and glamor, hazy like in a dream, but the car was bold, heavy, leaping off the page, looking stylized but almost real enough to climb into.  Tony could almost feel the rumble of the engine, smell that strawberry air freshner he’d never gotten around to replacing.
“Fine,” Ross said, “but you never ‘borrow’ it again, Rogers.  You’re done.  Agreed?”
“Well,” Steve laughed softly, “I tried.”
“You’re in an awfully pleasant mood for somebody who’s probably going to die today,” Tony said.

Tony’s hand dropped.
The nurse looked at him expectantly.

out.”
She put her arms abruptly around him, stretching to reach around his neck, and hugged him extra-tight. “He’s great,” she whispered in his ear, and Steve could hear the smile in her voice.
Steve shut the book with a flat clap and knocked his head against the locker a couple times. “Why do they have pop quizzes anyway?” he asked. “Don’t they get that we’re stressed enough without that on top of it all?”
Steve looked back at him, not meeting his eyes.  “Nick’s coming.”
Blood flew in a spray.
“Tony,” he said, wiping his face. “Tony, hey. Hey.”
“Why?” he said. “Don’t you want me to see what a cute baby you were?”
“Yup.”
okay?”
That voice.
He ordered a glass of whiskey, and sipped it slowly, savoring the burn of it in his throat. He’d started drinking a little more lately, and he liked the burn. He liked to feel that slow heat as it slid down his throat and bloomed in his stomach. It felt good. And sitting there, quiet in his little world, he felt something else too.
“You really
Tony groaned softly.  “I knew you were going to throw that back in my face, Rogers.”
then,” Sam emphasized. His eyes were locked on Steve’s.
He walked away, leaving Bucky and Nat sitting side-by-side on barstools, talking. He kept an eye on them as he skirted around the bar. Bucky leaned into Natasha and said something that made her throw her head back and laugh, and Steve smiled at that. He liked the way they looked at each other. The way they looked together. He and Bucky only had one night left in town. He hoped they’d make the most of it.
“Wow,” Tony muttered.  “Pretty serious business.”
He thought about the hours that lay ahead, the long empty hours, the days, the weeks, the years.  All of the time he had left to think about the way Steve felt in his arms, his eyes, his smile, his kiss…
I am working on the back half of this chapter as we speak. I will seriously get it posted ASAP. Thanks for reading and being patient with me! Loves to you all!
“Yes.  Thank you.”
“Tell me,” Thor said, “was she untouchable?  Many beautiful things are.”
Not the much more authoritative
“No,” Steve sighed, pain clear on his face.  “I’m not saying that, at all.
“Shit,” Clint said, and Tony shook his head with a sigh.
"I trust you," Steve said, and pulled him in to kiss his mouth.
Tony took his hand off the gear-shift and rubbed Steve’s thigh.  “I was hoping you’d say that.”
“Happy, have you seen Steve?” he asked.
Steve didn’t say anything. He touched the ring. Carefully. Delicately. The texture smooth and perfect under the trembling pad of his finger.
Steve stood up.
Tony bumped his knee against Steve’s.  “Then stop talking,” he said, “because I’m starting to regret you coming out of sedation.”
Tony kissed the side of his neck. “It’s good to hear you laugh.”
“I hope not,” he answered.
There was a rattling sound, then Tony’s voice. “-it in the bedroom, honey.” Steve’s lip began to tremble. “Yeah, Tony Stark.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m all ears.”
“No.”
living room?”
He went.
“What I want is for you to think about what’s best for Tony. I heard you tell him you’d take care of him. Do that, Steven,” Howard said. “Take care of him. Because he doesn’t know how to take care of himself. Not in that way. He’s too naive. Too much like a child.” He looked down at his own feet, and for the first time, his voice was soft, gentle. “He’s too much like his mother. Beautiful. Trusting. They both wanted everything. Tony doesn’t realize that’s not always possible. Maria didn’t realize it either.”
Pietro’s eyes turned colder. “But not enough. There was always something else, wasn’t there, Steve? Always
Steve shook his head.  “No.”  He took his bag out of the car.  “I’m tired.  I’ll just kip on the couch, then I’ll get out of your hair tomorrow.”
“You’re a saint, Steve Rogers.”
sleep on the couch.”
The doorman didn’t stir as Steve left the building and went out into the bitter night air.  He stepped outside and breathed it in.  Smog.  Smoke.  Snow.  Lingering fragrance of exhaust.  The warm scent of yeast from the bakery down the street.  New York.  It was all New York.
“Tell me,” Tony said as he slipped his hand inside Steve’s pants.  They were elastic-waist, prison-issue pajama pants.  Such easy access.  Uncle Sam wanted Steve to get off almost as much as Tony did, it seemed.  Steve moaned as Tony wrapped his fingers around his cock and stroked.  “That wasn’t words, baby,” he chided and kissed his neck again.  “Talk to me.  Tell me what it was.  Was it something about Ross?”
How could he possibly do anything less for Tony?
Steve was in the kitchen when Tony walked through the door twenty-eight minutes later.
Tony was still holding a fold of his sweater, and now he released it just enough to grasp Steve’s wrist in his hand as well. There was fabric between their skin, but Steve could still feel the heat. Still feel the weight of it, light but firm. Insistent. “You always deserved it, Steve,” he said. “Always.”
Steve stroked himself again. “I don’t know. It’s feeling pretty effective just like this.”
But he’d still like to try again.
“I’m sorry.”
“I’ll bet you are,” he said, feeling his heart swell. Maybe he should be scared, he thought, that this little girl had gotten so attached to him so fast, but he wasn’t. He wasn’t scared at all. And if he was scared of anything, it was that. The fact that Morgan being attached to him

Steve nodded. “Really.”
“One, but I really do think it’s okay now.”
making out, or whatever else they were going to do.
Tony watched him swim. Watched the way he moved. He wasn’t completely nude this time--Tony could see a flash of black fabric--but his back was bare, and Tony watched the flex of his muscles as he executed both butterfly and breast strokes with Olympic-style precision. Tony wanted him to stop. Stop trying to avoid the conversation. It was time. They’d been dancing--or swimming--around it long enough.
He was still holding Steve’s shirt, and he yanked at it, trying to get rid of it, get it out of the way. “Off,” he muttered, and Steve pulled away just far enough to tear it off and throw it away before descending on him again, shoving his tongue back into his mouth, licking deeply, Tony’s meeting him stroke for stroke.
Sarah slid her hand down to Tony’s and held it. Squeezed it reassuringly. “Would you like to come upstairs with me?” she asked Morgan. “Wanda’s up there, and I think she’s cooking something. She would probably love some help.”
“I need you to promise me you’re not going back to prison.”
“Have you had any messages from them?”
Okay, we're getting there now, I promise! Next chapter will probably be up next week. Thank you for reading, I really do just love you all so much!!
“Me neither. It seems like last week you and me were sitting in Dr. Banner’s science class. Going out to that clearing behind the school.” His smile warmed a few degrees. “Remember that?”
“Maybe,” Tony said, shrugging.
He shook his head.  “Nothing,” he said.  “I’m okay.”
?  Together?  Don’t you realize how sickened they would be by the thought of that?  The thought of you doing...whatever it is people like you do?  How disgusted they would be to have a faggot for a son?”
That old mix of feeling that he knew so well bubbled up in Tony’s gut.  The love, the fear, the longing, the frustration, the desire.  All present and accounted for.  He had held arms agreements inside this jet.  Had conversations with heads of state, presidents,
“Don’t, Wanda.  Please.  It doesn’t matter.”
“I know what I’m doing.”
rose automatically to his lips, but they didn’t come out like they always did. For some reason, they didn’t come out. He didn’t say them.
“I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you,” he whispered. “I can’t eat. I haven’t been able to sleep. I-”
“Has it changed much?  Since you were a kid?”
She nodded. “Right.”
Tony looked at his hands.  “I’m not sure what he wants anymore.  Maybe I never knew.”
“Is that what I did with you?”
And speaking of his man…
while he did it. He left the room after that, leaving Steve standing there, head pressed against the table, shaking, hard, guts roiling in his stomach. He’d never been afraid of Thad, and he wasn’t now, but as he straightened, pulled his jeans up, found some Kleenex on the sideboard and cleaned up Thad’s semen as best he could--he hoped it wouldn’t stain, but there was really not much more he could do--he found inside himself the
Steve gasped in pleasure as Tony did things to him with his lips and his tongue.  It was loud in the enclosed room.  He put his hand over his own mouth and slumped bonelessly against the wall, letting Tony have his way with him.
“Okay.”
Tony saw, even out of the corner of his eye, how Steve used his right foot to do that one, and only had to bend down to move the left one with his hand.  He
Tony laughed.
but not real, regular glasses like these. His brain tried to tell him how much he liked it, but Steve shut it up quickly, shoving it away into a metaphorical room in the back of his head filled with files it could look at and go through instead of thinking of Tony and his glasses--
“Tony, I still can’t handle much pressure--”
And it pissed him off.
, he thought.
Here we go...
“Really?”
“Are you really ill, boss?”
mean the most to me, but that one felt like the biggest one. The one I forced myself to get. During that first year, I’d tell myself, ‘Just get to one year. It doesn’t matter what happens after that. Just get to one year’.” He looked down at the coin sitting in Tony’s open palm, then back up at his face. “I don’t feel that way anymore,” he said.
“You could have called me,” Steve said quietly. “I wouldn’t have turned down a call from you, Tony. Not now. Maybe at the start. But not now.”
Steve smiled his half-smile.  “‘Cause I love you.”
“I’m not mad.  Let’s just get inside.”
“Secretary Ross,” Strange began, “Captain Rogers has been making exceptional strides here under the care--”
Tony ignored him.  “Steve,” he said.
He’d said it to
Looking at Bruce solidified his confidence even more.  He sat in the chair next to Tony’s, a bottle of beer near his hand, telling an involved story about New Zealand, some sheep, and the unfortunate appearance of The Hulk.
Steve kept walking, found his coat, and slipped into it.  His eyes felt too big, too dry, too hot.
Steve gave him a little shove.  “Get off me,” he said.
Tony stood up and tucked the last sock into the laundry basket. “Will you be okay with him while I go put this in the bathroom?” he asked, nodding at the baby.
, he preferred to think of it as
teenth.”
Bucky leaned forward and grasped Steve’s clasped hands in the one he had left. “Stevie,” he said earnestly, “if you really wanna quit, you know I’ll support you. Me and Nat and Sam, all of us, but you need to think about it first. Don’t just do this based on what your boyfriend wants. That’s the wrong reason.”
“Me too.  And, of
But Steve
"Oh, for Christ's sake," Tony muttered, running a hand through his hair. "That's nothing. That's like forty bucks. I want to give you something
Hadn’t even noticed him.
They’d planned on watching the show out on the deck with Nat, Sam, and Bruce, but since Ross had pulled his little stunt and called them in, citing an “influx of terrorist threats against the president”--oh, and Tony
“Just make sure you show him every day,” he said, never quavering at all. “Tell him every day. You’d fucking better.”
“No,” he said, and his voice was rigid.  Unshakable.  “It has to be for you.  I won’t do it if it’s for me.”
“What is?”
“You know, those days were hard on him,” Sam said finally.
And it was a long morning. A long morning making pancakes and Denver omelettes and frying bacon by the truckful. His eyes kept straying to the clock, watching the hands move from seven o’clock, to eight, to eight-fifty, and then staring hard at the door, waiting for Mr. Stark, wondering just what it was he wanted to talk about, but when the door opened, and the man walked in, Steve felt all his questions fall away. Instead of feeling anxious and nervous when he saw him, all he felt was peace. Because Tony loved him. And Howard smiled when he met his eyes. And Steve had more important things to worry about than what Howard Stark wanted or needed anyway, but he’d still go talk to him.
When he woke up the next morning, he didn’t even think about that red sports car or the kid driving it. He did his morning routine. He had a couple messages when he checked, but he didn’t listen to them. He wanted to go out for his run. He felt kind of fuzzy this morning. He always did on Monday mornings.
Once they left the store, it didn’t take long to get to the house on the lake. Tony turned down a long, rambling dirt road enclosed on both sides by pines, and then it opened up, and there was the lake, a sparkling jewel in a golden setting. Steve drew in a breath, and he felt Tony looking at him, felt the satisfaction in his glance, happy that Steve was happy.
Tony moved the chair into position, set the brake, then stepped back.  He watched as Steve gripped the arms and pulled himself into it.  He got hung up on the footrest, but Tony left him alone.  Steve reached down, balancing with one hand, and pulled his leg into place with a wince of pain.  He settled back and just breathed for a minute, head bowed, eyes closed.  Tony had no idea of the amount of pain that caused the wince or the deep breathing.  Steve didn’t like to talk about it, and he didn’t press.  But he knew it had to be a lot.  Excruciating for a normal man, maybe.  He found himself thanking any and all gods that Steve was not a normal man.  He did that a lot now.
Clint sighed.  “Relatively.  Guess that’s as good as we’re ever going to get, isn’t it?”
that.”
Nat rubbed his shoulder consolingly.  “Come on now.  Don’t be sulky.  Or I won’t bring you a souvenier from Majorca.”
Whew!  That went places I wasn't expecting.  Especially since this was just going to be a little one-off story about Steve and Nat bonding over a bit of mutual pining.  But, when they kept talking, I just kept writing.  Far be it from me to shush characters who continue to speak.
“Why do you hate it?  It’s your name.”
.” His hand found Tony’s in the darkness, and he laced their fingers together. “You would have fit right in.”
“We’ll let you in on it someday,” Steve assured him, sliding a pancake onto his plate. “And speaking of bathrooms. Remind me to get a toothbrush.”

together. It’s not fair.”
Steve ran a hand through his hair.  He sighed harshly. Why was his stomach so upset?  He knew the answers. He had studied really hard. Tony had helped him, going over character lists, quizzing him on quotations and definitions. He'd made him cup after cup of espresso--that Steve dutifully drank even though he didn't want to--then, when Steve started getting tired and irritable, took him by the hand and led him into the bedroom.  He laid him down on the bed, told him not to move--that he wasn't
“How long have you been standing there?”
been you, you know that, right?”
“Are you alright, kiddo?”
“Do you still feel it?”
Tony stayed where he was, his chest pressed tight against Steve’s back. Steve could feel him there, the pressure a constant comfort to him. His eyes were squeezed shut--they had been since Tony oh-so-gently closed them with his fingertips--but when Tony slipped the tie over them and knotted it behind Steve’s head, he jerked in his seat. His hands clenched on the down comforter, crushing it in his fists. “Tony?” he said on a sharp exhale of breath. “What are you doing?”
“And you
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve tightened his grip on Sam’s hand and bit his lip. “Does Wanda think so?”
And Steve couldn’t stand it. For some reason, he couldn’t stand it anymore. He wanted this over. He wanted this to be done. He was tired of being afraid, tired of tensing up every single time he either saw this man, or even thought about him. And he’d thought about him a lot. A lot over the years. A lot more over the last few weeks, since he and Tony had been seeing each other again. Wondering how he’d handle this meeting, how
And seriously--thank you! I love you guys!!
“Can’t you tell?”
“Yes, we do.  If he needed us, he’d be here.”
Tony pulled away a little, his breath coming in short gasps.  “Wow,” he said, “who knew you had that in you, huh?”
Nat cast another glance at the beach.  “How could he not remember?  It was five minutes.”
“Yeah, well, I found a little something extra in my pocket this month.”
“Of course, I will.”
When Steve finally pulled back, Tony scrubbed a hand over his face.  Steve’s fingers went to his jacket, crushing the leather.  “What are you doing here?” he asked.  “Do the doctors know you’re here?  What time is it?”
“Always,” Steve said quietly. “You always come first. You’re the only things that matter to me, Tony. Nothing else means anything. Just you. Just you guys. I don’t care about anything else.”
“The lights went out, boss.”
He stayed in the training room until he was sure she was gone.  He knew if he saw her again, he would not be able to stop himself from asking her to stay.  And he knew she would leave anyway.  It was better to just spare them both that heartache.
On second thought, there was
“Oh.  Okay.  Do
, but it wasn’t jumping-off-the-walls-shrieking-in-the-night either, so he counted that as a victory.
“That’s good, Tony,” he answered. “I’m glad.”
“Tony-”
Tony shrugged, smiling a wicked little smile. “Copulate, celebrate. Same thing.”
And he
“Who’s real fucking smart?”
The sun was almost down when Jerry came on the intercom again.
Not even Thaddeus Ross.
“Me too, Tony,” Steve said, squeezing his hand. “I keep loving you more too.”
“‘For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction’,” Steve recited, and in spite of the pity he was feeling in his heart for this man, he couldn’t help the thrill of satisfaction he also felt when Howard’s eyes widened minutely. “Yeah,” Steve said, as if agreeing. “I know what it means.”
Tony struggled, trying to wrap his mind around what was happening.  For a moment, he thought he might have chased his still-long-gone shoe down some freaky rabbit-hole where up was down and down was up and Pepper was wearing Stephen Strange’s t-shirt because of...some reason Tony still couldn’t grasp yet.  Then he wondered if Stange had put some kind of hex on him.  He was like a witch, right?  Maybe he and Lord Voldemort hung out on the reg and he had spelled Tony into just
Tony hung up the phone, wiping his eyes.  That was good news.  Fucking great news, and his first thought was that he needed to share it with Steve.  Ridiculous, of course.  Then he thought of Pepper.  Was
Steve nodded. “Okay. Well...see you.”
He didn’t say what they were both thinking because he didn’t have to.  It was as clear in Tony’s voice as it was in his own head.  If they’d been together before, this would not have happened.  He shouldered that responsibility and he was sure Tony felt it, too.  Because he owned part of it.  Neither of them was blameless here, and they both knew it.  But Steve didn’t want to think about that anymore.  He’d thought about it for months,
They were standing so close, the heat between them a palpable thing.  Tony felt it too this time, there was no denying it.  It was in his eyes, a simmering look like molten lava, and in his skin.  The muscles trembled under Steve’s grasp.  Steve swallowed.  “Okay, Tony,” he said.  “Anything you want.”
Tony stepped closer. “You already said you weren’t married,” he said. “So, no others? Significant or otherwise?”
(See the end of the chapter for
No one.
“Every single plan I had changed when you showed back up, Steve,” Tony said, leaning back against the couch cushions.
“‘Truth, justice, and the American way’, Fury?  Don’t throw taglines in my face and call them ideals.”
“Yeah.”
“I finally picked up Lang.  He said Stark’s com got damaged.  Said he could only hear one word in ten, so he shut it down.”

“Really? Looked pretty serious when I came up,” he said, and looked at Sam. Sam, not Steve, as if knowing who would tell him something closer to the truth in this situation. “Really. What’s going on?”
more worth your while to stay here with me instead.”
That was a little harder to define. And not only because of his father’s whims and inclination to just decide to up and leave for years on end at a moment’s notice. He couldn’t define Tony because there was
“Look,” Tony began, “not that I don’t love waking up to find you lurking out here, but was there something you wanted?”
his enemy, after all--he couldn’t let that bother him. Josh was going to win. Steve was going to go back to the desert. It was just the way things were.
“It is the holidays, FRI.”
“Oh, baby,” Tony said, and Steve looked up.  There had been a hint of laughter in his voice, and now there was a hint of laughter on his face.  Steve flushed with embarrassment.  “Please don’t tell me you’re jealous of Sir Purr.”
They didn’t speak the whole drive home.
desperate. “Yes, you can, Steve,” he said. “You can. I need it.” He kissed him again. And again, and again, speaking between kisses. “And you told me you’d love me forever. Remember? Remember that? I need to hear it again, baby. I need to know if you were telling the truth.”
He slept for seven hours and awoke to the sunlight streaming through the window.  The storm was over, but it was cold, so very, very cold.
“Hey,” Steve warned, eyes flashing.
I love him.”
“Don’t think you’ve got anything to worry about there, baby.”
“I’m not grumpy,” Steve protested.  “It just hates me.”
, was the thought that barreled through his head.
Steve had been a little embarrassed by the flush that crept up his body at those words, and when he sucked Tony down later that evening in bed, the words pounded in his own head:
you think she’s hurting…”
Tony leaned closer to look at the last one. His heart sped up as he gazed at it. The backdrop was sand. Just sand, and an eye-wateringly blue sky over the top of it. Steve was standing, slightly at attention, his hands behind his back, a small, complicated smile on his face. He was wearing his fatigue pants, a white t-shirt. His dog-tags were hidden beneath his shirt, but the sun glinted on the chain going around his neck. Tony’s eyes were drawn to his shadow, how dark it looked against the sand. How sharp the edges of it were. For a brief moment he thought of Peter Pan who had once lost his shadow. Steve hadn’t lost his, but he seemed like he had lost something else. Tony’s eyes searched that face in the photograph, then he turned and looked up at the real thing here beside him.
“It’s okay,” Steve said, and while the pout was still there, it was now duking it out with a smile. The same smile that was always there whenever he looked at Tony. Soft and adoring.
“I don’t like it,” Steve went on, oblivious, “but that doesn’t mean I can’t do it. I
The kid leaned against the door frame. “
“That’s true,” Steve said, sliding his hands up and down Tony’s back again, smiling when he arched into it like a cat. “You better watch out, though. If Morgan sees
They both looked down as Steve said Tony’s name again
“It wasn’t Clint’s fault either.”
“No.”
“Bad alternator.”
"People tell each other things all the time,” Tony said, drifting over to touch the items laid out.  He petted the towel, dipped his finger into the shaving soap and rubbed it between his fingers, then with a delicate touch, lifted the razor.  He opened it and the bathroom light caught the blade, making the keen edge shine.
to be scared.  That’s a good scared.  Isn’t it?”
They walked out together, the three of them, and crossed to the back door.  Sun streamed through the window set into it, hitting the shimmer in Nat’s dress.  She looked like she was wearing a garment made of diamonds.  Steve’s mind cast back to Sam’s apartment the morning after Hydra had nearly killed them in Zola’s New Jersey lab.  She’d asked him if he trusted her.  Strange now, to think that was a question she’d ever had to ask.
Steve laughed, and Tony felt light enough to float away. He thought if Steve’s arms weren’t still around him, he might. “I’m not doing this with you,” Steve said.
“Yes. Your paintings. I admit I don’t know much about art,” he said, looking at Steve seriously, “but I was impressed. Very impressed.”
Tony did as he was told, slowly and thoughtfully, exploring Steve’s familiar mouth with his tongue, loving how he knew just what to do to make Steve shiver.  He’d always heard them say familiarity bred contempt.  What did they know?
“Never happen.  I don’t think Thor’s even into guys.”
He went out to the garage for a little while.  He’d bought a couple vintage cars to work on, but he didn’t really do anything on them.  He mostly just moved things from one place to another, then gave up and left again.  When he got into the house, he could hear the shower running.  He picked up a little, folding then re-folding their blankets and tossing them onto the couch.  Steve had continued sleeping out here and Tony had insisted on doing the same.  The big bed in the next room had yet to be slept in, had yet to be even laid upon, although Tony did sit on it sometimes in the mornings to put his shoes on.
“I’m not staring.”
The silence pressed in on him from all sides.  It was quiet at home, but this was beyond even that.  It didn’t even seem like there were any birds in the surrounding trees.  Which was strange.  The building was part of an old logging operation.  It was made of corrugated sheet-metal, huge, cavernous, with some dust-grimed windows that were almost all shattered now.  There should be hundreds of swallows in the eaves of this place, building their little mud nests all jostled together like row houses.  There should be sparrows, and finches, and starlings.  All of the birds that Tony had gotten used to seeing at his own place, should also be here in
Tony gazed at him, fingers clenched in his hair, pulling it just right, just enough to send sharp thrills of sensation through him.
“Nothing, really,” he told Nat.  “Tony fell asleep and I looked at him and thought I wouldn’t mind falling asleep with him every night for the rest of my life.”  Steve smiled over at her, a little embarrassed, but only a little.  She was easy to talk to.  “Pretty corny, huh?”
Clint finally looked at the screen.  His eyes jumped from place to place, catching many of the same phrases Nat had.  His face grew sober in the glow of the screen, his easy, cock-sure smile fading away to nothing.  “What the fuck?”
“I still will,” she insisted, and it sounded so much like Tony, his heart skipped a beat.
“Who’s Doctor Strange?”
“Thaddeus--”
“Oh.  Okay.  Tell him thanks for me when you talk to him, ‘kay?  I don’t see him much anymore.”
Tony shrugged. “It’s just gossip,” he said. “Not even Howard cares about high-school gossip.”
Steve nodded, glancing at him out of the corner of his eye. “Sure. I’m okay.”
And he would...but that didn’t make it hurt any less.
He had a shower, washing off the chlorine and the night air, then climbed into bed. He was tired. And lonely. And for just a minute, he let himself continue on with his fantasy. Let Fantasy-Steve come out of the bathroom, all showered and shaved, smelling like toothpaste and menthol shaving lotion. He came toward the bed and didn’t even hesitate before tossing back the covers and crawling beneath them. Didn’t hesitate before sliding next to Tony and curling his body around him like it was the most natural thing in the world. Fantasy-Steve nuzzled into his neck and kissed him there. He heard--almost
Steve looked at Tony.  There were strain-lines on his face.  “I’m tired,” he said, then glanced around at the others.  “I’m sorry, guys.  I hate to be the wet blanket, but…”
were here.  They were together.  Steve was looking at him and being his sweet self, love shining out of his eyes like concentrated starlight, all directed at Tony.  He wondered--again--how in the name of
“Yeah.”
And then all the other stuff that would come after Morgan was asleep, and they were alone.
Ross stared at the three of them angrily.  “This is insubordination.  It may even be treason.”
“Some...stuff. He was mad.” He sighed. His eyelashes fluttered against Tony’s skin. “Why does that keep happening to me, Tony? What am I doing wrong?”
“I said keep your pretty words to yourself.”
Tony visits Steve...
“Thank you,” Steve said.  “Merry Christmas.”  Then he turned around, and Tony was there.
“People without cell phones still function just fine, Tony,” Steve said, watching while Tony scrawled his number down on the napkin, then glanced down at Morgan. “Do
Tony smiled. "I know." His heart was hammering in his chest, his stomach now doing easy, constant somersaults. But it felt good.
Tony nodded.  “Yes.”
Steve glanced up, a little smile on his mouth. “It’s okay,” he said. “He won’t hurt her. He likes...people.”
Thad looked him up and down. His face held cold, cruel disdain. Nothing else. No love. No pain. No nothing. He shook his head. “Then get out.
“Tony, you have to hurry,” Wanda whispered urgently.
“I have to get back to my mom,” he said, suddenly.
He went into the little bathroom and had a quick shower, washed his hair, and let the hot water run over his body until his sore muscles eased. He thought about jerking off, then decided not to. He had an ear cocked for the phone. He hoped Tony would call him tonight, and if he did, maybe Steve could get him to talk him through it. They had never done that before. He thought it was high time they remedied that situation.
skyline. The view from the window, but Steve had added just enough of a twist to it to make it  abstract and magical. It seemed like a dream-version of the real thing. A dream where roses dripped red honey, and birds flew upside down. It was odd and fantastical, yet entirely commonplace. Looking at it made Tony’s head spin in a giddy way.
, he just held him for another minute instead, and that seemed like it was enough for Tony, because afterward, he lifted Steve’s head with a nudge of his shoulder, kissed his mouth, and said, “Do you want to come over after? Or we could come to your place?”
“I know I was.  And I thought that might be the reason.  Later.  When I
“Like in abandoned buildings.”
“Hi, baby,” he said.
Steve smiled.
Steve was silent for a minute. Still. Tony held onto him. Just held on, waiting. Waiting to see what Steve would do. He’d said it was Tony’s decision, and he had made it. He wasn’t letting him go. Now, he was waiting to see if Steve would accept that or not. And finally he felt Steve’s arms creep around his middle. “Really?” he asked timidly.
This was not like that.  This was different.  This was
“‘Cause they keep knocking him down, and he just keeps coming back.  Isn’t that what we do?  What we’re supposed to do, anyway?  Isn’t that the way God designed us?”
“We took that vote in October. Who would be weird enough to pick ‘pool’ over ‘outdoor kitchen’ in October?”
He could leave. He hadn’t knocked yet. There was still plenty of time to cut and run. Plenty of
“A lot has changed since you’ve been gone.  It’s different now.  It’s different between them.”
Tony waited for that voice inside his head to speak up, to tell him what to do, but it was silent.  He was on his own here.  Just him.  Just Tony Stark.  Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.  Only child of a murdered couple.
dollars, and now he was giving away five
“Bruce,” Nat called.  “The sooner we leave, the sooner we’re back.”
“Mm-hmm.”
"Tony, I'm in charge of it.  I put the whole thing together.  I have to be there."
And just like that, the bewilderment was gone from Steve’s eyes. The concentration remained, however. In fact, it sharpened. Intensified. Tony saw it happen. Saw the way a cold shroud fell over him, and for a second--the barest of seconds--he was afraid. For that second, it didn’t feel like it was Steve standing in front of him, at all. It felt like someone else. Someone powerful, someone shrewd.
“Secretary Ross’.”
“Did he tell you that we spoke?”
Tony nodded immediately. “Bedroom,” he said, and backed toward the tiny dining room and Steve’s bedroom beyond, pulling Steve with him.
Steve took his hand, and Tony marveled at how good that felt. How pure that simple act of taking his hand could be. The hallway was a short one, and for Tony it was both much too short and much too long. Short because the sweet pleasure of just holding Steve’s hand was a beautiful thing on it’s own. Long because what was waiting for them at the end of it was everything he had wanted for so long. Everything he’d dreamed about while lying alone in bed for the last few months since Pepper left him. The last few years, if he was being honest. The last fifteen years, if he was being
Strange drew his notes out of his briefcase.  “Let’s go over some things we can do to help that.”
“Good.”
Tony kissed him again.  “More like thirty seconds, okay?”
“Awesome, Gina.  Thank you.”
Luckily for them, his tech was no match for one Tony Stark, and his guards were easily brought to heel by the Avengers’ own resident witch, who had them dreaming of their halcyon days of yore.  For most, that was home with their mothers.  For one or two, their high-school years.  One, an older guy with a hard, craggy face and a tarnished wedding band, dreamed of a hot summer spent in a hay loft with a golden-haired ranch-hand.  Wanda made sure he was extra comfortable.  After losing Vision and experiencing all the years Steve spent pining after Tony while she went through his meticulously-catalogued mind, she took a vested interest in long, lost love.
Tony glanced at him.  “Okay, baby, let’s get a couple things straight.”
I know this came fast, but my life kind of took a turn into shambles last night.  I am going to be fast-tracking the rest of these stories so I can get them out to those of you who have stuck with me through this.  Fair warning: the rest is a little rough around the edges.  I won't have time to polish it as much as I would like.  Sorry.  You're probably tired of hearing this, but THANK YOU to everyone reading this.  Sharing these stories, and your kind words and excitement about them has given me more in the last couple months than I deserve.  Thanks again.  I love you all!
“No. I’m not hungry.”
“Hey.”
She let out a breath and shook her head.  “Of course he did.  What else would he say?”
one. Then I put Morgan to bed. Then…”
Bruce stuck his fork into a cherry tomato and popped it into his mouth. “No. I’m fine. I like salad.”
“Don’t.”
“Is that okay?” Steve asked without lifting his head.
. Tony slipped his free hand up around Steve’s neck. “That wasn’t really a pun,” he said. “But I do kind of like the idea.”
“Hands off, Stark,” Natasha said, and Bruce blushed.
“Can’t we do it over the phone?”
Tony nodded.  He hadn’t known her parents, what kind of people they’d been, but he could see Steve in that posture, that arrogant tip of her chin, and he was proud.  As proud as any pseudo-step-father had ever been in the history of the universe.
” Bucky said.  “You’ve got that right.”
Steve leaned back on the couch, rolling his head against the back of it to eye the bare walls. “Nah. They didn’t have much to begin with. I think the only really valuable thing they have is Bucky's collection of vintage

Tony shook his head. “I-” he began, then shook his head again, and went to the door. The handle was cool, perfect and welcome under his palm.
One more drop of sweetness before the storm comes.
“Get out, Mr. Stark,” another soldier barked.  “No touching.  You knew the rules.  Let’s go.”
“He was gay?” Tony asked, and Steve nodded.
Josh put his arm around Tony’s waist, his own hand went to Tony’s hip. The exact same place where Steve’s hand had been five seconds ago. Not fair, Steve’s fingers said again. Not fair! “I thought you were coming right back?”
Steve gave him a quizzical look, like he couldn’t quite believe what Tony was asking. “Mine,” he said, then swam away again.

“Where’d the other one go?” he asked.
“No,” she said. “No. Go. Go right now, or I won’t be able to

A soft, lady-like snort.  Why did she and Steve have to be so much alike?  And why was he just noticing this now?
Tony came back first.  He breathed in and lowered his hand.  His body eased and he tried to smile.  “Steve,” he said, and watched as the fight drained out of him.  The tension went out of his shoulders.  The fire left his eyes and what replaced it was a despair so great it made Tony stumble back a step.  Never had he seen a look so filled with hopelessness, a look so broken and empty.  Even on his worst days after Afghanistan, after the wormhole, when he thought he’d rather just die, he’d never felt the way Steve looked now.
“Yup.  That.  That’s what I think about.”
“We won’t stay all night,” Tony assured him, and when he put his hand on Steve's thigh this time, it
Steve kicked him. “Shut the fuck up, and tell me who called your house.”
Steve didn’t mention it.  He just drank it with a little glowing ember burning in the pit of his stomach every time he did.  Tony’s kindness was something that was easy to overlook, but at the core of his being, behind the bravado and snark, it was what defined him.  What made Steve love him.
"Oh my god."
?”  He looked up at the ceiling, imagining Steve up there, lying on his bed, all cozy beneath the covers.

Steve nodded, blinking. Like he’d just awaken from a dream. Or an enchanted spell. He ran a flustered hand through his hair. “Yeah. He is.”
He tensed nervously, then relaxed and put his hand on the back of her head, holding her loosely. “Hey,” he said, feeling some kind of...something swell inside of him.
said all lumberjacks were sexy.  Maybe he could bring him around.  “Okay,” he said.
He squeezed her hand and let it go.  “I know how sappy it is.”
Morgan smiled, giggled a little, the sound like the twitter of a bird. “Steve’s not little,” she said, shaking her head, and Sarah laughed.
“Yeah,” he said, eyes flicking to Steve. “Yeah, but we’ve got rules. I could get fired.”
“I...I’ll see you Saturday.”
He wanted to go home.
“You-You’ll tell him I’m here, right?” he asked.
“To Sir Purr.  For being grumpy and yelling.”
“The fuck it is,” he said, then looked down at the little blonde.  Her eyes were wide, round with surprise.
They stood looking at each other.  They weren’t standing close together, but there wasn’t much distance between them either.  Just enough to give each other their space, just enough to dispel any illusion of threat.  Tony had shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans after showing Barnes they were empty.  Bucky’s hung at his sides.  He wore a leather glove over the vibranium one.  The effect was intriguing.  Far from hiding it from attention, it would make a person curious.  It would make a person wonder about him.  Tony wasn’t sure if Barnes realized how he drew the eye.  Steve had said he’d been a ladies’ man back in the day, but that had been a long time ago.  A lot had happened since then.
his mind whispered, like a razor through silk.
Steve bit his lip, but said nothing.  He was being torn apart from the inside out.  Hitler?  God, was that what he was in the eyes of this man?  The idea made him sick with rage and fear.  He didn’t want to go.  He didn’t want to be in a cage with this man as his jailor.  But he thought of Tony.  Of Natasha.  Of everything.
Steve frowned at him for a minute, then shook his head, a tiny smile appearing and disappearing in a flash. “Okay,” he said.
“I love you too, honey. My sweet, sweet boy.”
“Umm,” Steve said, casting a confused/amused eye on him as he came back into the living room and plopped down on a chair.  “Okay.  Why?”
“I know.  I know.  It’s over now, though.  You don’t need to think about it anymore.”
The restaurant was small. Bruce felt more comfortable in small places. Tony wasn’t sure why. He thought if
Tony nodded. “Just for today.”
“Oh, you don’t think so, huh?”
“Hey,” he said, as sudden inspiration struck. “Hey, why don’t you come home with me tonight? You can sleep over. My mom can help if you don’t feel good. She’s really good at it. She does it for me when

’,” he repeated, and his eyes shone like borrowed starlight.  “You’re bad, Tony.”
“Out,” the guard said.  “This way.”
“They called my house again last night.”
“That’s funny coming from you,” Steve said.  “Mr. Problem-solver.”
Tony pulled away fast.  “You
Tony’s finger brushed his cheek, traced his mouth. “It wasn’t too much, was it?”
Steve drew in a breath, then let it out. The side of his mouth lifted in his old, familiar half-smile. “God. I guess it is.” He shook his head. “Time goes fast, doesn’t it? Seems like it was just Christmas.”
a lot to her.”
“I know what you meant.”
He put his hand on Steve’s arm.  “What’s wrong?”
What if things never settled down at work?
“Guess we better,” he said, and straightened.  Tony ran a distracted hand through his own hair and brushed his thumb across Steve’s knuckles.  “Yeah,” he continued, “we probably should get something checked.  I called you ‘my friend’.”  He huffed a rueful little laugh, his eyes flitting around the room, lighting on Steve’s for only a second before darting away again.  “That was an asshole thing to do.  I’m sorry.”
He’d gone through the motions.  He’d stayed at the cabin, watched the boats out on the lake, slept in the bed they’d shared, worked on his cars, washed the dishes, went to City Council meetings, spoke at Lions Club meetings.  He even joined a bowling league.  And why not?  His average was 220, and he bought all the beer.  His team was beyond thrilled to have him.
“We’re on the same page, aren’t we?”
“But I’m not your son anymore. We’re not family. You’re my boss, I’m your employee. We have no personal relationship beyond work. Agreed?”
“He said he’d go anywhere with me.”
Tony wanted to protest, but he let the words die on his lips.  He’d pushed him enough for one night.  Maybe it was better to let it lie.  Instead, he nodded and stood up.  “I’ll go shower and stuff so you can--” he gestured vaguely at the couch.
Silence from her end, and Tony waited to see if she would speak or hang up on him.  Thirty seconds.  Thirty long-ass seconds…
“So, that’s the famous Tony Stark,” Bucky said. “Huh. He seems...nice.”
“Oh, this is an old one,” Tony answered, his own breath short as wave after wave of pleasure crashed through him.  “I just had to wait for you to get better before I could show it to you.”  He stopped moving, concerned.  “Wait, you
Steve shook his head, smiling a little.
“Hang on,” Tony laughed.  “One question at a time.”
Steve ducked his head.  He could feel a red blush creeping out of the collar of his shirt.  He got the juice back out of the fridge.  He didn’t really want any more, but he needed something to do with his hands.  He could feel Tony pointedly not looking at him as he poured his own cup of coffee.  An awkwardness had crept into the room when Tony entered and his first instinct was to get away from it, but he straightened his spine.  He could do this.  It was just Tony.
“You’re always worth the wait,” Steve said, and while the blaze in his eyes didn’t go out, it did dim.  Like a cozy fire in a hearth instead of a forest fire.  “I’ve waited for you my whole life.  When I met Peggy, I thought it was her.  And I loved her.  I wanted her.  And I would have been happy with her.  But you...I never knew who I was until I met you.  Or who I
“Boss?”  Finally, but she sounded strange.  Almost frightened.
Steve just laughed.
“Hey,” Steve said, feeling a large, stupid grin on his face and not caring one bit.
“Tony,” Steve warned softly.  He was smiling, his cheeks a pretty pink.

a blast from the old past?  Funny.  Nothing ever changed, did it?  Nope, not really.
he had gotten so lucky.  It was a funny thought, considering where they were currently sitting, but it was there, all the same.
“Haven’t done it yet.”
“You touch people. That’s just what you do, Tony. That’s not the same th-”
“You learned?”
Steve looked up at him through his lashes.  “Yeah,” he said, and it was just a statement of fact, so basic, so fundamental, but volcanic in its implications.  “You make everything better.”
Steve exhaled, frustrated.  “Tony--”
“I know.  And they’re not going to get away with it.  Doctor Baxter here has given me all the information we need, and he’s going to be very cooperative when it’s time, aren’t you, Doctor?”
“No.  I’m doing this.”
He moved closer, draping himself over Tony’s chest without a word. Tony wrapped his arms around him, petting his hair, and kissing his forehead. Steve tightened his hold on him.
“You what, now?”
Onetwothreefourfive.  “Yes, I did.  But I thought if we worked together, we’d balance each other out.”
apartments, baby. You know.
When he came back to the table, Steve had it mostly cleaned up and looked more in control.  Tony helped him finish up.

“Gross,” Tony mumbled.
“No, I’m not.”

part--missed his
?  It’s unfuckupable.”
“Because. I didn’t. Know. You,” Tony emphasized.  “If I wanted to know something now, I’d just ask you.  I’d talk to you.”
He touched Tony’s cheek with fingers that trembled the slightest bit.  “I promise.”
“We could, but you know how much better these things go when we do them in person.”
Howard continued to say nothing. He just gazed at him from over the tops of his glasses. He didn’t even reach for his drink. He just sat, looking at him. Tony didn't think he had ever had his complete and utter attention before. Yesterday--or even two hours ago--that would have meant something to him.
Steve blinked, confused. “Colonel Sanders? Isn’t that the chicken guy?”
“No, Captain.  I’m sure he doesn’t hate you.”
It wasn’t much really, just a simple, Saturday afternoon sketch, but there was a refinement to it that raised it far above mere “scribbles”.  A grace that felt delicate and brave at the same time.  Looking at it filled Tony’s heart with wonder.
“Are you sure?”
She looked at it and wrinkled her nose.  “Yuck.  Pulp.  No thanks.”
“We always had to lick ‘em in the old days,” he said, smiling at the memory.
Tony leapt to his feet and grasped her arm.  “Where are you going?” he asked.  “Come on.  Do your thing.  Fix him.”
When they left the bar, Tony was feeling okay, so he turned down Sam’s offer of a ride, and started walking.  He hated walking.  Walking was the worst, but sometimes the body just wanted to move, didn’t it?  And since his sparring partner was currently behind bars, he walked.
“Yeah. You were.”
“I mean, challenging me.  Grounding me.  Letting me know I’m full of shit when I’ve reached the limit.”
“Just lunch, huh?”
Tony walked around for a while after leaving Nat. His mind was a flurry of activity, of ideas, of plans. Did he go the grand-gesture route, or the more quiet, subdued, fireworks-and-family route? Or was that the same thing? Did he even know the difference? Steve did, but did
“I’d like to get into them again right now.”
“You bet on this?”
“You’re right,” he said, the absurdity of apologizing to what was basically a computer-generated secretary/babysitter/friend/wife not lost on him.  “I’m sorry.  I haven’t been taking care of myself.  I’ll do better, okay?”
“No, sir.”
And this was part of it.  As much a part of it as anything.  Lying in bed, pressed together, talking.  This was a huge part of it. Steve's favorite part.  As much as he adored the rest, this was Steve's favorite part.
“I went out for groceries,” he said. His voice had taken on that lifeless quality again, and Tony hated it. He hated it so fucking much. “I didn’t need much. Just a couple things. I left Dodger home. I took him out for his walk already, and he was more interested in laying on the couch than going out again.”
“That somebody has been messing around in his head,” Bruce answered.
“Whatever.”
Howard chuckled a little under his breath, and Tony frowned. That was different. “That’s pretty much what your other friend said,'' he said, and toed his shoes off while Tony watched, incredulous. Fascinated. “But she let me in anyway.” He sat down on the edge of the pool next to Tony and rolled the legs of his pants up with an efficiency Tony could hardly believe. It looked like he’d done it a hundred times before. Like it was second nature. “He was shooting me some pretty sharp daggers on my way out here.” He laughed again and stuck his feet in the pool.
Steve’s eyes gleamed. “Really? You wouldn’t mind?”
“But. You didn’t know I was going to stay here last night,” he said, but Tony just shrugged, popping another bite into his mouth.
Howard raised an eyebrow, and for the first time, Steve was struck by how alike he and Tony looked. How similar that expression was. “Were we still talking about orange juice, Steven?” he asked.
“Next best thing to you being here,” Tony said, and kissed him again.
Tony shifted, lifting Sir Purr off his lap and settled him aside.  He moved until he sat cross-legged directly in front of Steve.  “No, I know,” he said, leaning closer.  Steve looked at him, frowning a frustrated little frown.  “But, I just…” Tony smiled a little.  “I thought we already
His breath caught in his throat, but he closed his eyes and worked through it. Quickly. Efficiently. When he could breathe again, he smiled and kissed her cheek one more time. “See you soon.”
Steve looked down at his clasped hands.  “I was afraid you wouldn’t come.”
“Yeah,” he answered, then, thinking about the cabin, thinking about
“Are you okay?” Steve asked him.
Tony sighed harshly, squeezed him again, then let him go. “Okay,” he said briskly. “Okay. Go to work. You’re going to be late.”
“Yes,” she agreed, still holding the arrow.  It trembled in her hand, an echo of Clint’s quivering muscles.  “But that’s not you.  Not anymore.”
They were sitting on Thad’s bed in his city apartment. It was where they always ended up. They had “date nights” twice a week, and “lunch dates” another two times per week. Their “dates” were spent indoors, either at Thad’s house or sometimes at a hotel near his office. A few times, when Thad was working late and there was no one else on his floor, Steve had come to his office. He brought sandwiches from a deli, but Thad was never very interested in the food. All he really had eyes for was the sight of Steve spread out naked on his desk or the couch in the corner.  Once, he’d taken Steve to the conference room, bent him over the head of the table, and fucked him mercilessly. He pulled out right before he came, and finished on his boss’s chair, muttering about
Tony swallowed past the lump that had suddenly found its way into his throat.  God, was it old age or heartbreak that was making him lose his edge?  Whichever it was, could go fuck itself.
“Did you let her?”
“It’s not much,” Steve said, the answer a whisper of breath against Tony’s ear.
“Why not?” Tony asked. His voice held a tiny pouting note. Steve swallowed. That wasn’t helping matters. And neither was having him so close. And again he wondered how this had happened so goddamn
“Yeah. Hurry, okay? He’s fine, but he needs you.”
.” He shuddered, a huge, volcanic shaking that he couldn’t seem to stop, and Tony squeezed his hand again, pressed it against his mouth.
Tony barely slept.  He was terrified that as soon as he drifted off, Steve would leave.  It wouldn’t be for six months this time, or a year, or even two.  No, this time, he’d leave for good and Tony would never see him again.
Steve groaned and pushed Tony away.
“Yeah, that one’s on you.”
“No,” he said reluctantly. “No, we’d better just do it. It’s getting late.”
Tony pouted on the couch, face sullen.
together. The fact that he knew without a doubt what Tony’s lips felt like. What they tasted like.
She swept out of the room, leaving the door open.  Ross watched her go, his mouth twisted into a knowing smile.  “Well,” he said, “you can certainly tell who she spent time with, can’t you, Stark?”
Then came the serum.
“Wanna do the honors?” Tony asked, gesturing to her, and Steve nodded.
But he had Natasha.  And Bruce.  And Peter.  And even Thor sometimes.  He’d had a few meet-ups with Pepper, and they’d went well.  The fact that Steve was out of the picture had probably even made that part easier.
“And yet.”
Tony took pity on him, not wanting to drag this out, not wanting to put him through the ordeal of decisions and declarations and being afraid he’d made the wrong choice.
Steve squeezed his hip and smiled a little. “Tony, that guy never left. He’s been hanging around ever since I met you.” Tony winced, and Steve laughed a little. “And I’m glad he’s still hanging around. I kind of like him. He might be a little cocky sometimes, but he’s also really smart, and confident, and cool.” He shrugged. “I don't want you to get rid of him.”
Tony sighed miserably.  “We talked about it once.  Going to Tahiti.”
Steve shook his head. “I don’t really have anything to talk about.”
Some of the feeling was coming back into his arms, and Tony lifted them enough to caress Steve’s sides, the ridges of his ribs, the soft skin of his hip.
“Whatcha working on?”
Hot.  So goddamn hot.
--across Steve’s throat. “There are a few different ways we could use it.” He drew the tie over Steve’s lips, making him whimper. “We could gag you,” he said, “but I think I like the sounds you make too much for that.”
like him, too.”
“Tournament’s in June.  We’ll get you back in form.”
“So, you’re just using me to get to her? Classy, Stark.”
Nat placed a hand on both of their shoulders. “Am I going to have to muzzle you boys?” she said, and Steve couldn’t help but notice the way Bucky’s eyes gleamed when they fell on her. Looked like someone else had a little kink too.
“Gonna what?”
“I know,” Steve said, ducking his head.  His thumb came up to his mouth and he chewed the already-ragged nail.  “It just...reminds me of before.”
“Every ‘us’ probably thinks they’re different, Tony.”
“Tony.”
Steve swallowed and nodded.
Steve had been in prison then.  He was in prison now.  The more things change, the more they stayed the same.  Tony wasn’t sure he’d really understood that phrase until now.  And that was fine.  He hated it.  It was a stupid phrase.  And things
“Yeah.  I’m sure.”
Steve struggled back to the present, but those words followed him.  They’d followed him for years.  They always would.
He did a lot. He always did. No one had ever been able to bring Tony up over the edge with more skill and passion as Steve could. He left him a sweaty, sated, quivering puddle every single time.
"You absolutely do."
They were on assignment when it happened.
Steve stood still, indecisive, watching Tony work through it.  There was something between them, that much was painfully obvious, but that didn’t mean it was what Steve wanted it to be.  He hated the ambiguity of it all.  He appreciated straight lines and symmetry.  Tony was chaos, he was order.  Two sides of the same coin.  One could not exist without the other, but they were always at odds, no matter what they did.
Tony laughed a little. If it had been anyone else, he thought he might have gotten a little offended by the question. But not here. Not with Steve. “Is that a deal-breaker, Steven?” he asked, and Steve blushed prettily.
“I’m okay,” Tony said.  “But, really, Steve, you can’t leave me again.”  He curled his fist into Steve’s t-shirt and drew in a shuddering breath.  All of a sudden, this wasn’t a joke.  This was deadly serious.    He huddled close against Steve’s side and spoke into his chest.  His eyes were blurry, and he felt a weakness in his heart he had not felt since Peter had crumbled to dust at his fingertips.  “Promise me, okay?” he whispered.  “Promise me you won’t go away again.  I can’t watch you leave, baby.  I can’t.  Don’t make me.”
“Actually, now is the worst possible time, Nat.”
At last, Clint released Nat, and she stepped forward.  Bruce held out his hand, and she left Steve and Clint to stand next to him without looking back.
“What happened?”
Tony came into the room.  “What are you yelling ab--Oh, look!  You met.”  He picked the cat up in his arms and brought it over to Steve.  Steve took an involuntary step back.  He didn’t think he’d ever seen such a murderous look in an animal’s eyes before.
"Hey."
“You’re welcome, kid.”
“Yes sir, Mr. Stark.  Whatever you say, Mr. Stark,” he said, and that reminded him of Peter, and he smiled back.  He’d invite Peter up sometime, too.  When Steve was feeling better.
Steve was carrying a ruck-sack.  Something ancient, dull, made out of army-grade canvas.  It looked perfectly at home in his hands, as if he’d carried it forever and ever.  Maybe he had.  Maybe it had made the rounds of the globe with him when he’d been on the run.  He hoisted it over his shoulder.  “What are you doing here?”
“Just a Coke, I guess?  Do you have a Coke?”
“Yeah,” Steve breathed.
Steve sighed again and knocked his head back against the door a couple of times. “What do you want me to say? Mom was happy.” He nodded past Tony at the photograph on the wall. “Your little girl? She looks happy. That means
“They say Hitler was a dedicated soldier who loved children and animals.  Is that enough for
“And why do we need a ‘breather’?” Thad asked.
“So is he.”
Steve shrugged. “Checking up on me, I guess.”
When Mrs. Perkins was gone, Steve told Sarah how sorry he was. How sorry he was that he hadn’t told her what he had done. That he was sorry he hadn’t asked her what she thought.
.  And every time I think something might--”  He yanked his arm out of Tony’s grip and shook his head.  “But I was wrong then, and I’m wrong now.  It doesn’t matter.  Forget it.”
Tony barked out a shocked, happy laugh.  “Are you serious?  Oh my god, Stephen, that’s fantastic.  You really know how to bury the lead, don’t you?”
“There you are,” she said, and there was a sweet relief to her voice that made everything inside him start to loosen.

to be real, not just something he told
Steve shook his head. “I’m house-sitting for Bucky and Nat while they go on their honeymoon.”
Tony and Sam looked at each other. Both were a little wide-eyed, a little expectant, both wanting the other to take the lead here.
“Sorry I didn’t make it to the party.”
“Of course, it was.  Nat told me the night before that I should tell you how I was feeling, but I couldn’t.  Not while you were with her.  It wouldn’t have been right.  And it wouldn’t have been right to kiss you either.”  He swallowed again, and even in the moonlight, Tony could see a blush coloring his cheeks.  “I held your hand, though.”
“We should probably shower at some point, too,” Tony said.
Steve shook his head. “No promises, remember?”
. As a person.” He untwisted the tie again.
Steve didn’t answer. He just moved aside and let Tony brush past him into the apartment. Tony heard the door close, the locks, three of them--
Steve turned his head, his eyes meeting Tony’s.  There was gladness in them, mixed with apprehension.  “You think?”
Steve shrugged.  “Death isn’t really anything, is it?” he asked.  “I was scared of it for awhile, but after The Raft, I…” He shook his head.  “It’s just a little barrier.  It doesn’t mean anything.  Just that I’ll have to wait again when I die.”  Steve shrugged again, smiling softly.  “You’ll catch up, though, won’t you?  When it’s your time, you’ll find me, right?  And then whatever’s after this, we’ll do it together.  Right, Tony?”
--was talking to him right now in a voice that was soft and liquid-warm in his ear. “It’s late,” he said, keeping his own voice quiet, but unable to keep the hint of desire out of it. “And it’ll be even later by the time I get over there.”
The first time was an hour after he fell asleep. Tony kept him awake for a little while when they first went into the bedroom, kissing him with slow, maddening intensity, sending Steve’s defenses in disarray, making him weak with want. He held himself together though.
He parked his car, locked it, and started into the building, still musing about Steve, his cock already stiffening a little just at the thought of him. They’d had a few more afternoons in Steve’s twin bed, and Tony thought they were the best days of his entire life. He loved the sex--really
.  I’m picking ‘or something’.”
“I’m sorry.”
Tony saw. Saw and understood. “Come on,” he said briskly, putting his hand on Steve’s arm. “Let’s go to my office. ‘Kay?” Steve didn’t answer. Didn’t even try. Tony was holding his arm. He just focused on that. “Karen, no calls, please,” he said over his shoulder as he steered Steve away.
“Don’t you want us to stay?” he asked--again--and she shook her head.
like it was already a foregone conclusion that they would be in a position to worry about things like Christmas.
The kid poured out and she winked at him as he walked away.
missed them.  “Challenge accepted,” he said, and when Nat leapt in the air, graceful and deadly as a cheetah, Tony put Bruce in front of him, using him as a human shield.
He took it and held it in his hands.  His face was uncertain. He brought it to his lips and sipped.  Smiled.  Sipped again.
“We’re all concerned about you, Tony.  We love you.  None of us ever want to see you hurting, you mean too much--why are you smiling like that?”
“Yeah.”
Tony shook his head. Blinked.

He leaned forward.  She touched it gingerly.  “Doesn’t feel broken,” she said, and wiped some of the blood away.
Tony smiled at him, suddenly looking very pleased with himself. “Really? You want to?”
, but no one suggested that this year, especially Tony who was generally a sucker for tradition.  At least the ones they had created together, their little Avengers family.
“Are you sure?” Bruce asked.  “I thought they were being silly worrying so much, but now…” He glanced around the room, looking at the twenty or so half-begun projects, the piles of schematics.  The couch in the corner was covered in a tangle of blankets.  It was the same old black leather couch.  He’d had Jeff drive it up here on his Chevy flat-bed then treated him to a night on the town to say thanks.  The coffee table in front of it, where he’d once sat to bandage a certain super-soldier’s knuckles, was littered with cans of Red Bull and empty coffee mugs.  To his credit, there were a few banana peels and granola bar wrappers, too.  He’d been trying harder lately.  Mostly for FRIDAY’s sake.
Four missed calls. Seven texts.
Thor put his hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “Many of those I love are gone, as well.  Our reasons to go to war may change, but rarely the need for it.  It’s our duty to find some reason, however small, to keep fighting.”
Then there was a hand on his arm, a voice in his ear.  "This way, Steve."
Tony pressed his shoulder more firmly against Steve’s. “Me neither,” he said.
“‘Kay. Night, baby.”
Steve moved in his seat, his hand reaching out to unconsciously touch the leather dashboard, caressing it.  “No,” he said, uncertainly.  “No, not tonight.  It’s late and I haven’t talked to him in, well, a year.”  His hand moved over the dash.  “I don’t really want to answer any questions.  I don’t...want to talk.”  He sighed.  “Maybe just a motel tonight?  Anywhere’s fine.  I just want to shower and go to bed.”
Tony pushed off his chest and slipped silently across the room. Steve watched as he put his eye to the crack between the partially-closed door and the jamb. “Holy shit,” he whispered, incredulously. “He
“Hey,” Steve said finally, pulling back a little. “You’re messing up your paint-job.”
Tony felt his heart swell in the cage of his chest.  Seeing them together, happy and in love, could have made him a jealous wreck, but it didn’t.  They deserved it.  If any two people in the world did, it was these two.  How lucky that they’d found each other.  How lucky that time and circumstance had led them down their separate paths until they merged together into one.  Bruce the monster and Natasha the assassin.  Both so dangerous on their own, but together, they were all love and sweetness and light.
Steve locked his eyes on the target. The man was tall, dark-haired, good-looking in a vague, unremarkable way. He was easy to look at and easy to forget. Very few terrorists looked like terrorists. They looked like your neighbor, the guy who made your coffee or sold you your car. They looked like the guy by the bandstand.
Tony rolled his eyes.  “Wow, Steve.  Cheating with the secretary is so over.  Who do you think you are, Don Draper?”
“Home.”
Tony laughed.  “Yes, my dear Gina, it was definitely that.”
He leaned down and pressed his lips to Tony’s temple. Tony shifted, exhaling a little, his lips curving upward just the tiniest bit, but he didn’t wake up. Steve rolled his eyes fondly and kissed his shoulder. His ear. He curled his hand into Tony’s and laughed a little when Tony stayed stubbornly asleep. “Are you
And then she was asleep. Just like that.
“What’s wrong with me?” Steve asked hollowly, leaning into Tony’s side, and Tony’s hand rose automatically to stroke his hair, thrilling at the texture between his fingers.
“So good.”
But he wasn’t thinking about Tony right now as they walked. He was half-listening to Bucky and Gabe arguing about baseball, but part of his mind was just trying to exist in a peaceful lull. He let it. Let it just be as still as it could while he walked. The sky was blue overhead. The air cold, but clean in his lungs. He was walking. His body was loose and easy. His rifle and pack constant, almost comforting weights.
“Damn, who programmed you?” Tony snapped. “Barton? Just put up the
to look at Tony. He didn’t want to talk to him. He didn’t want to engage with him at all. He just wanted to eat his cake, drink his own drink, and get out of here. He wanted to go somewhere quiet and be alone. He wanted to have a real drink and not think about anything. And that time was fast approaching. The limit on politeness was coming right up. Fifteen minutes. Twenty at the most. He could do it. He could stick it out. A person could do
Steve knew he should protest. But he didn’t. He didn’t want to. Howard could say what he wanted, think what he wanted, and Steve knew that he was right, but right now, he didn’t care if it was selfish. He
“I’m going to do what he did,” Tony said.  “I’m going to make a deal.”  He raised his eyebrows at Sam.  “Do you concur, Mr. Wilson?”
Steve smiled--that sweet, brilliant smile--and leaned slightly forward. Tony sighed and narrowed his eyes. Then he kissed him. He acted like it was with a great reluctance.
It was
“Yes he is, honey, he’s a
Steve finally lifted his head.  His eyes still swam, but he was trying to smile again.  That was his guy.  That was his best guy, always trying.  Always trying to look on the bright side.  No matter how dark it was.
Steve had seen him the second he came in. The second. It was as if his eyes had been drawn to that dark corner as if by some kind of magic/magnetic spell, and while he only glanced that way, his insides burst with the knowledge that Tony was here in the same room with him, after all this time, all this distance, all this
Peter laughed, then craned his neck, looking through the crowd.  “Did Captain Rogers come with you?  I thought he might.”
Steve led him there by the hand, going through the tiny kitchen to a small bedroom tucked behind it. There was room for a bed, a desk, and a bookcase crammed with books, and that was all. It was a quarter the size of Tony’s own room, and was painfully neat while his own was a wild disarray of
“No. No, I…” --huge yawn-- “I’m glad you called. How was your meeting?”
“First time for everything.”
about that. Extremely glad.
Steve wasn’t sure if she heard him.  Her fingers were still on his cheek, but they were still, just a soft pressure.  He folded his own fingers around them and brought them to his mouth.  He kissed the tips, then kissed the hollow of her temple.  Her heartbeat was soothing in his ears, her arms a safe, peaceful place.
Steve's face turned an alarming shade of red, while Tony and Sam cackled on the other side of the table.
Tony smiled and laughed a confused little laugh. He tightened his grip on Steve’s knee. “Okay, you guys are either talking about something else, or you are
Tony had to admit, grudgingly, but sincerely, the portal made things easier.
“That’s about--”
Tony bent his head and kissed Steve’s shoulder.  “How ‘bout just to bed for now, soldier?”
Steve laughed as Tony wrapped his arms and legs around him, clutching him in a vise-like octopus grip. “I’d tell you,” he said into Tony’s shoulder, “but I can’t breathe.”
“Idon’thaveanyclotheson.”
“I’m serious about the nap.”
“Uh-huh.”
Bucky put his arm around her and kissed her. Neither of them cared that Steve and Clint were sitting right there watching. Neither of the two men cared either. They just exchanged a look that was equal parts amusement, embarrassment, and just plain happiness. Happy that Bucky and Nat had this. Happy that they were happy.
Steve’s fingers slowly uncurled from Tony’s jacket.  His eyes raked her from head to toe, taking her in.  The lines on his face smoothed out.  It was as if he were remembering something vital that had been forgotten.  For all Tony knew, that’s exactly what was happening.
“With your mom,” Tony answered. “She came this morning and took Morgan and Dodger out.” He shifted around until he was lying more fully on top of Steve. He kissed him again. Again. Small kisses that felt like fire even through the fabric of his shirt.
Sarah flapped a hand at him. “
Tony shook his head and sighed out a frustrated breath. He felt a little funny. Almost as if he had opened the door for--or worse, actively participated in--
“Okay.”
“Are you actually comparing yourself to a Disney princess, right now?”
Ross’ eyes flew open, and his hand reached, snake-like, under his pillow.  It was instinct, innate, and if Tony had not been one thousand percent sure it was going to happen, Ross might have killed him then and there.
“Did you get my text?” he mumbled.
“I never said I wouldn’t live my life, baby,” Tony answered. “I never said I didn’t want you to live yours. But I want us to be together someday. I want you to promise me we’re going to be together someday.”
Steve began to drift again.  The good life must really take a lot out of a man.  He’d never slept so much or so well in his entire life.
Instead of chewing it, Steve put it out of reach by wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and pulling him closer.  He rested his forehead on his chest, right next to the reactor.  It’s glow lit Steve’s hair in eldritch blue.
Bucky blinked furiously.  This wasn’t what he’d come back for.  The years between he and Steve, all the time they’d lost, hung like an anchor around his neck.  And the memories, they were heavier.  And darker.
Steve licked his lips in a nervous gesture. “Uh, sure, um…” he looked at Tony, asking silently if this was okay.
“What was it?”
Steve ran a hand through his hair. “I thought we were.”
“I said Howard would be disgusted by your behavior.  He never agreed with your life-choices, but this is beyond anything he ever even considered.”
She looked at him with dark eyes.  “Can I ask you about Tony?”
He slid down against the headboard until he was lying beside her.  It was strange having someone else here in his bed.  Strange, but good.  He took up a lot of room, but lately the mattress seemed to get bigger every time he laid down on it.  Bigger.  Colder.  Emptier.  Having Natasha here made it smaller again.
“I want--Tony--I want, oh god, don’t, don’t stop.  Please.  Please, Tony.”
Bruce nodded.  “Yes.”
“Back to work, Stark,” he said, and Tony laughed.
“They used you,” she said bitterly.  “They all used you.  They’ve been using you from the start.”
Tony glared at him, then looked away, trying not to let him see the smile on his lips, and let out a deep breath. He squeezed Steve’s knee again, though, rubbing his thumb along the inner seam of his jeans before finally taking his hand away. Steve felt a burst of triumphant pride in his chest. That felt like a definite win.
What if Tony decided
Tony came around the corner of the work table and reached out to touch the soft cashmere. “Inciting a mob of horny New Yorkers.”
