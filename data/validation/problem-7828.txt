Steve groaned and rolled his head till his face met the table – he hated when Tony made him do this. “Please, Tony,” he grumbled before turning his head back to glare at him passionately, “please, would you fuck me already?”
“Fun move, Capcicle,” Tony said breathlessly, “Not the first time I’ve been on my back, but that was pretty quick.”
“Take us to the gym, JARVIS!” He said aloud, and instantly the elevator began making its decent downwards, despite Steve’s mind raging that he needed to get out and hide.
What he wouldn’t give for just a little more…
Steve grabbed onto the gauntlet holding him firm, and attempted to pry it from his chest, but it was futile. Instead, the hand chose to slip downwards, pressure still there but tracing a heavy path across his abdomen – each individual plate felt on his skin – and stopping at the bulge in the Captain’s pants. It wasn’t the first time Steve had gotten an adrenaline boner, but as the hand grabbed his dick through his trousers and his gaze traveled up and down the stunning piece of art before him, he knew it had nothing to do with adrenaline.
Steve gazed at the beautiful piece of armor - yes, he was sketching that too, sue him-, then looked back to expressive brown eyes and swallowed thickly, “What is it?” He didn’t really need to be that close to even a piece of Iron Man right now.
“Tony, please.” Steve automatically begged, not caring about how dignified he must look and sound right now, because two hours was a long time edge even a super soldier.
Steve gasped as the Iron Man armor rocked back into him, pushing his front more firmly into the work bench. The metal that had once felt like ice inside him had now heated up to something warm and pleasurable, feeding the need festering inside the Captain. Cold fingers gripped his hips as the Iron Man suit slowly slid its handcrafted dick out of his now gaping hole. Steve shuddered as his hole twitched around the empty space.
“Hey you!” Tony called from across the workshop, garnering the rapt attention of U as Steve continued his sketch. “Not U,” Tony hissed, shooing the whirring robot away. “Steve!”
“A week, probably, but in two days it’ll be ready for a test drive. You up for it, Cap?”
“Hey!” Tony loudly interrupted. “Me and Steve are all good now, Katniss. Mended the bridge, erased the line, water under a duck’s back, or whatever that saying is. And now were gonna spar like good bros.
“Me?” the blonde almost stuttered as he pointed at himself with wide eyes. This was the first time the genius had decided to seek him out for a spar. It was usually Rhoades or Natasha who reserved that honor. Why Tony preferred to fight
“I am Tony, it’s…wow.” He said breathlessly.
to himself. Although, that feat was made uniquely difficult by one Tony Stark, who felt the need to drag Steve even closer towards his secret obsession today.
The Captain sweat a little; it was unusual.
The genius simply grabbed at his ass harder, having quite a lethal grip with the gauntlets on, while Steve groaned and moved his hips both against the hot pelvis under him and into the metal hands holding him. The strong hands held him more firmly then any human pair ever could, and it sent a whole new feeling coursing through the Captains body.
“So,” Tony began, softly stroking his cheek, as his breath still shuddered through him. “What did you think?”
Tony simply raised an eyebrow at him and casually spun the wrench in his hand, “I thought this was supposed to be
“Yes,” Steve replied just as softly. He then circled the repulser before dragging his hand up the gauntlet one final time and reluctantly pulling away. “Thank you, Tony. It’s beautiful.”
Steve just ignored him, wrapped his hands around the edges of the table and hung on for dear life as the robot set a new pace of hard, slow and
Seeing him coming close, Tony planted his feet more securely and thrust his hips up harder.  A heavy hand then left Steve’s ass and came up to cup the back of his head, drawing his further into his shoulder, holding him there, tight and safe as Iron Man rocked back into him.
Steve cringed, knowing that after avoiding Tony all day and now being tardy for their spar, he was definitely behind the eight ball. With a sigh and great reluctance, he closed the book he’d been reading,
Steve leaned forward, blindly seeking out that little button on the side of Tony’s faceplate, pressing it as soon as he found it and brining Iron Man’s face into view. He groaned and rested his face against the warm metal.
The Captain’s breath caught in his throat and he hesitated before hiding his face in Iron Man’s broad shoulder and grinding his hips down onto the titanium pelvis beneath him. A deep groan ripped past his lips and he did again, letting go of Tony’s other gauntlet in favor of gripping the man’s upper arms, using them as leverage to push himself down harder.
Steve sighed despondently, setting his sketchbook face down on the couch before standing up and slowly making his way over to the inventor. “Yes?” He asked tentatively.
A guttural cry tore itself from the blonde’s throat as his orgasm ripped through him like a tidal wave, his toes curling as cum poured over Tony’s gauntlet in rivulets. Steve panted and tried to calm his heart as it beat wildly against his ribcage, because oh my God, Iron Man was still stroking his dick. His member was softening, but it gave a valiant twitch at the feel of the metal rubbing lightly against the sensitive skin.
Steve sighed gratefully while the archer pursed his lips in suspicion looking like he had more to say, but Tony was having none of it. The genius quickly swept out of the elevator and grabbed Steve’s wrist so that he could drag him back with him. “Time to go, Cap,” he sang while pressing the button that closed the doors.
“Language,” he heard Tony sing from across the shop, but was far too preoccupied for a retort.
“Take a look,” the brunette prompted, wiggling his encased fingers.
Everything was so hot and suffocating, the hand melting his cock in its heat, despite its metal casing, the air like smog as he breathed it in, the feeling of pleasure tightening in his stomach, burning him alive. The shaking blonde panted heavily and squeezed Iron Man’s wrist for dear life as the gauntlet practically wrung his orgasm out of him, setting every nerve in his body on fire, cum pouring gratuitously over the metal fist. Steve gasped like he was drowning, and his eyes flung open, chest heaving and back arched with the strength of his orgasm. Sweat covered him in a light shimmer and he could feel a distinct, wet warmth in his pajama pants. The Captain groaned raggedly and slapped a hand over his blushing face.
Tony looked at Steve, and sniffed, wiping a fake tear form the corner of his eye. “My son is able to distinguish between light sabers. I’m so proud.” Steve was turning his over in his hand, smiling at it, feeling the weight, knowing that Tony had diligently taken the time to craft these. “Okay, now I want you both to point them out, and then press the button there.” Tony took a step away from them and Steve raised an eyebrow.
"Never now!" Tony exclaimed and Mary cackled.
Tony glanced at Bruce, before hopping out of his chair. "I've got something that you can learn easily, and it doesn't matter if you have two left feet, or no feet."
Jamie cooed in his arms and he took off her hat, tucking it into his back pocket, no longer under the rays of the sun. “She likes it, too,” Peter said, looking up at them. “I told you she was getting smarter.”
“That’s diff-“
Pietro was pacing slightly, looking as if he were fighting with himself on if he should interfere or not. Wanda must have warned him off if he wasn’t moving just yet. The rest of Tony’s body started to thrash on the bed, and Tony wanted nothing more than to grab him away.
"Tony, you still there?" He couldn't help but let out a little smile at Rhodey's voice.
"Seventy-Six hours." Jarvis tattled. Traitor. There was that look from Steve, one that he would get from Mary sometimes as well. Like he was doing something he knew he shouldn't be doing.
“Indoor voices,” Tony reminded him, pulling out one of the keycards. Steve caught sight of the placard outside the door that read ‘
Steve followed her with his eyes. Classic signs? That wasn't something that he had ever heard of back in the 30's and 40's, so how was he supposed to know. But he could admit that her advice wasn't bad, and it was something that he could do, and maybe it would give Tony the time and space he needed. Steve could help, he wanted to help, and he could put up with the press or anything else that Tony worried about. He headed for the kitchen now, his goal to make breakfast for everyone this time.
“Wha?” Tony moaned out as he pushed himself up. Mary glanced over at him.
That's when they noticed the large fan come out of the water, the carrier starting to life up out of the ocean. It's wasn't a submarine at all! Bruce Banner had a manic smile on his face now. "Oh no. This is much worse."
Tony reached up a shaky hand, thumb wiping away the tear that slid down Steve's face, feeling a bit confused. Steve grasped his wrist, pressing a small kiss to his palm. "You have your family here, Tony. You have others willing to help you through this."
Tony whined a bit. "Can I help global warming along? It'll melt the snow."
Tony took them to the end of the hallway, to the wooden double doors. Tony reached up, and slid part of the wood panel above the door open, a key dropping into his hand. He unlocked the door, one hand on the handle, then slid the key back into the little compartment, hiding it once again. Steve caught a faint smell of dust as they stepped into the room, Tony shutting the door behind them. There was a large oak desk in the center of the room, a plush, old, leather chair tucked in behind it. There were books coverings the shelves behind the desk that ran the length of the wall, a large window with the curtains drawn to the left of the desk, and a leather couch to the right.
I wish I could say that I was done with Tony, and Steve, emotionally.....  :)
"No idea yet, again it depends on what they're trying to take down. Everything gives off different kinds of energies, like lazer grids and tazers are two different things," Tony explained. "I can't be sure until we get there, and I'll try to take some scans."
Steve frowned now as he moved closer to her bed. "I think you'd better explain what's going on." He noticed a bit of guilt flash through her eyes.
"I don't have time for that." Tony brought up a screen with a flick of his good wrist, showing the number of phone calls, texts, and voicemails he already had just from that morning. "There was an alien attack yesterday and-"
"Meg??" That was a voice they both recognized.
"Yeah, Natasha called with a mission, and I said yes." He watched Dum-E swerve around Steve, going past Tony, but claw taking the dirty rag from him. "Should only take a couple days, and I'm afraid I'm starting to get cabin fever."
"I hear it's good to have both feet on the ground," Tony commented.
“I know Mom still gets upset when she thinks about what happened.”
"Yeah," he smiled, happy with himself that he hadn't been wrong. "I haven't, uh, listened to music in a long time, so I'm catching up. On music, like, all of it." She raised both eyebrows at him now.
Steve huffed and smiled lazily, “I think that your right, this was supposed to be
“Oh yeah,” Tony drawled with a smirk. “Nothing too fancy, but she does hit harder and the hand to hand combat sequences are much more proficient. Been thinking I need to up my game on the ground, and this’ll definitely do it.”
In hindsight, perhaps it was that obsession that had brought him and Tony closer together, as friends rather than reluctant teammates. At first, Steve would gladly spend his time in his room, sketching various poses and renditions of Iron Man for hours on end, giving in to his mind’s desires and staying far away from the inventor. After a month of living at the tower however, it was nigh impossible to still the Captain’s feet from making their way into Tony’s workshop, settling down quietly on the couch as he sketched the suits from a model rather than memory. Tony had pestered him for a while about what exactly he was drawing…
Steve released a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding and relaxed back into the table. When the robotic hands stroked down his spine a shudder ran through his body, and he pushed his hips back into the nine-inch metallic dick behind him. The suit pressed forwards, and the tip of its cock slipped in and out of Steve’s hole. The blonde moaned openly and pushed back again, hoping for more. Finally, Iron Man sank back inside of him, slowly filling him inch by inch. Steve cried out as he felt the entirety of its girth, much bigger than Tony and maybe even bigger than himself. His muscles twitched and clenched around it, trying to relax and accommodate the size, but it seemed futile and Steve was tired of waiting. He dug his hands into the table and pushed back again, practically wailing at the feeling of Tony’s suit stretching him out on the inside.
Over the course of his ninety something years, Steve had acquired many obsessions, some to the point of absolute ridiculousness – collecting bobbles, growing his hair, that taco stand down the street, you name it – and he had a feeling this one would not be far off. Once, when Steve was both young and impressionable, he had even become obsessed with being like his best friend, Bucky. Bucky was always so strong, charming and dependable and Steve was just stubborn enough to want to be that and more. It took time to fade, but it was now an ideal he had dropped long ago at the insistence of his friend. Back then, he’s also been obsessed with war – and maybe he still was today –wanting,
When Steve’s breath finally came back to him, without his panting the silence in the gym was deafening, suddenly putting things into perspective and causing his heart to beat even faster. He just got jerked off by Iron Man. He just came on Iron Man. He just came on
“Then why did you say that?” he asked.
"I thought why would clear," he said, caressing Steve's cheek.
Natasha packed the few things she'd accumulated in her temporary home into a cardboard box. It was five in the morning. She shoved the box into the trunk of her crappy little car. The goal of leaving at this hour was to avoid a long goodbye, but she knew Helmut would be sneaking out for a morning smoke. From the corner of her eye, she spotted the orange glow of his cigarette.
"I'll get started on working out the details," she said.
“So, you can get it off.”
The agent actually seemed excited to do such a task.
“Come back to visit any time,” she said.
Before he could finish Steve knocked them off the couch in his excitement. The omega sat on top of him straddling his waist.
“I don’t think you’ll need stitches,” he said.
“Are okay, Mr. Stark?”
Steve tensed, feeling the arms around his waist. His nerves were soothed by the alpha's earthy clove scent. Callused hands traveled gently underneath his shirt, massaging his abdomen. The pressure was perfect. He leaned into the man behind, granting him further control. Steve moaned, blushing as a squelch of slick in his undergarments. His muscles relaxed. He took a deep breath.
"My feet hurt."
“I don’t know. I wish I did,” said Barny. He wished he could give Steve an answer. S.H.I.E.L.D. wish to keep him a secret until there was a great need for him.
“Steve.” Tony took off his helmet, bringing Steve into his arms. Tenderly kissing him.
“Why didn't you wake me up?”
“Anything new happened since I was gone?” asked Steve.
There was a thud on the roof. They readied for attack. Tony opened the cargo door, moving to the exit.
"Yes."
*****
“Shit.”
“Go!”
As the pup drew Winter cleaned. When he took a break from his task, he saw the pup was scribbling an entire world map on the wall.
“Now you’re getting it,” said Tony.
“No.”
“Fine,” he said. Tony forced himself to relax. This activity was far more intimate than he thought it would be.
Steve and Tony entered the room and immediately picked up on Fury's scent.
“I love it,” he said. Steve was so happy. This was a commitment that Tony was willing to give him. He knew how hard it was for Tony willingly work on a project with someone.
"Be easy on your, Papa little one. He helped save the world for you can't you give him a break," he said.
“I have to answer this,” said Steve.
“S.H.I.E.L.D. the good guys. My grandfather was a founding member. Apparently they were friends. And he’s Aunt Maria’s boss.”
"When was the last time you went into heat?"
“You have a knife in your leg. That isn’t fine!”
“Almost. But that, too, will be corrected in time.”
“Something humans should have never been able to have,” he said.
"You could quit," said Steve, and he wouldn't blame George if he did.
The next morning didn't seem all the different from any other. Breakfast arrived as normal. A beta woman came to the door. Unlike Lena, she was uncomfortable being so close to Winter. That advantage over the beta disappeared with an armed alpha entering behind her. A large gun was strapped to the alpha. Was something like that necessary? The few armed guards she'd seen in passing carried a uniform handgun, nothing special.
“Does Tony know?” she asked.
“What do you find it funny that your young strapping alpha had arthritis?”
*****
“I don’t need you to watch me brush my teeth,” she said.
"We are super-powered children. You were created by an unknown organization. It may be what really happened, but in the real world that stuff doesn't go over well. People object to the power of the Avengers, sometimes. They question that two founding members allowed their child to be kidnapped,"
“He’s only just gotten the footage taken from your suit when you encountered her,” said Tony.
“Likely?” said Steve.
“S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency 193.6 in effect,” she said.
“Only ten?” he said. Surely someone else could handle such a small number of enemy combatants.
“I will,” said Steve.
*****
His voice was hazy with sleep. He ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony’s grasp around him tightened. Their legs were tangled together, making it impossible to leave the bed without waking the other. The mix of their pleasure, sex, and scent was oddly comforting. Tony’s expression was serene, unburdened by thought. Not many had seen the inventor like this. Steve fell asleep to the image.
“Will I get to meet them?” asked Rhodes.
Lena led Piper to a mid-size room. Like everything else, it was gray. On each wall was a whiteboard. There was a single child-sized desk at the center of the room and a teacher's desk across from it. Piled on it was a large stack of books, most of them AP level.
“Don’t try and wake him,” said Killian.
“Do you want to go to the museum first, or do you want something to eat?” asked Tony.
“Don’t tie me down,” he said, rubbing his wrists. The ghost feeling of the leather bonds crept over his skin. It disappeared when Tony’s hand ran down his back.
“Are you sure this isn’t another false lead?” asked Tony.
“So, Banner. That’s your play,” she said.
“It wasn’t a setting he succeeded in, but he tried very hard,” she said.
“Morning, Steve."
"I'll let your imagination go wild with that," said Steve.
An agent dropped off some clothing. The pups still smelled of that horrible place. It would do them both good to wash.
Tony laughed.
“When I get back, I want to see them,” said Natasha.
“I will. Bye.”
Jarvis wasn't allowed to warn Tony of his visits. Recently they'd gotten into a fight when he discovered a bottle of scotch Tony had hidden there. The two hadn't talked for two days after that fight.  Steve glared at the steps to Tony's lab, but he cautiously made his way down. Christmas music was playing. He stood at the doorway. At the center of the room was his mate. Steve smiled as the alpha started dancing. Pieces of armor flew toward Tony, latching on him.
Tony smoothed his hand over Steve’s arm. The omega quivered. Tony grunted, knocked back by a sharp elbow to his side.
“It’s nice to have you home.”
“I’m so sorry, Tony.”
“Jarvis, place a delivery order at Blue China," said Tony.
"Five minutes," said Jarvis.
“How do I look?” said Tony, coming out of the bedroom.
“Jarvis.”
The alpha’s head turned to the side in confusion. “Sorry?”
She rolled her eyes. True, the once playboy alpha was settling down and starting a family. The press would be out to disprove Tony's new image. Bad news always sells better than good.
“Shh, sugar lump. Let’s not wake, daddy up.”
“What’s that?”
Tony’s phone vibrated against his leg. He picked it up immediately.
“It’s alright. And to answer your question Ironman is my favorite,” said Steve.
The late morning could be blamed on nearly a week without sleep. He craved the closeness of his alpha.
“I’ll have to leave you for a few days, but I’m sure you’ll be fine,” said Phil.
Lena opened the file on her phone. Her eyes widened at the events it depicted.
“A bomb is not a bomb when it’s a misfire. This stuff always works, right pal? It's faulty but you've found a buyer didn't you. Sold it to the Mandarin."
Piper flipped through the pages of another textbook. She had already read the thick texts twice, memorizing most of the information and answering the review questions in her head. Winter was staring into space, in off mode, completely still and seemingly unreactive. She ripped a page from the book, throwing the crumpled paper ball at Winter.
“The Winter Soldier.”
"If you change your mind, knock on the door," said Barny.
“This is the Mandarin."
“Steve, are you alright?"
"I'll call again later."
He yawned. His eyes grew heavy. Steve's frightened whimpers broke him the drowsy haze.
"He gives you a connection," said Rhodes.
“This is urgent,” said Phil.
Tony nodded. When Steve was settled he returned to work. At three in the morning, he decided it was to get some sleep. Steve would want to leave at the crack of dawn. He had maybe two hours to sleep. Tony went to wake Steve, gently shaking him. Steve grunted clearly not wanting to be disturbed. The omega yanked him on top of him. He was pinned against Steve’s firm form. Steve’s arm circled snuggly around his waist. Looks like he was sleeping like this.
“I have an appointment with Barny, so I might not be there.”
“I don’t want all that attention. And I don't want it for our child,” said Steve.
"I have no standing with them. All of you have a reason for her to trust you. I am a stranger. The only way for me to gain ground is to play her game. So far, it seems like she's willing to play by her own rules.” George held up the contract. “Is this something you could set up?"
His arms moved protectively over his stomach.
A small detail one of Tony's favorite TV shows is the British Top Gear.
“Where do you think she got it from, kid?”
"Hello, Piper. I am Dr. Caroline Bloom," she said.
"Sure."
He started chopping the carrots. “What have you been up to since I last saw you?”
“Not yet, give her a chance,” said Lena.
“Paninya.”
He nodded.
"That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it," said Tony. He didn't see that resemblance before now the small crater they were sitting in was a staunch reminder of it. He backed away slightly.
“Not as many as you would think. Apparently, my scent is chemical. It has something to do with the serum. Apparently, to most, I stink of sugar and bleach. You and my neighbor seemed to be the only people who find it attractive. And not what most alphas are looking for in an omega,” said Steve.
"My apologies, sir."
“Fine,” huffed Tony.
“I saw that,” he said.
“Alright”, said Steve.
“Most adults would find it terrifying.”
“I have to take this,” he said before leaving.
“Well, good morning to you, too,” said Tony.
“Who are you?” asked Steve.
“That’s part of it. When I was young, I was so rarely allowed outside. My mother feared the pollen would cause issues with my asthma. Even after the serum, I never had a chance to enjoy weather like this."
“Eat, you weren’t able to store the proper amount of calories before your heat,” said Tony.
“We need to discuss your heat,” said Tony.
Steve rubbed his face. "Why do we have to go over this? This happened almost a year ago. I'm happy that I got pregnant. It might not have been under best terms, but I wouldn't have changed anything."
Outwardly the pup seemed fine, now. But little had been done to correct the previous change. Her voice didn't hold the same surety. The pup's eyes were always sad, but now her gaze was defeated and almost hallow. The emotions that usually shone so freely in those blue eyes was muted. Time, hopefully, would be enough to repair it all.
“Not yet.”
“Your birth control is 99.99% effective. I have to say likely because there’s an exceptionally slim chance of malfunction,” said Jarvis.
“Okay.”
“You stink, sweetheart,” said Tony.
“What do I do?”
"It's early, yes, but not so early that it would be unusual. It's normal," she said.
"I do, you don't," Tony pointed out.
"Rachel!" He gasped, trying to sit up, but Steve was holding down his good shoulder.
"We have a shared language of Science!" Tony proclaimed.
“And taken for a walk?” Peter finished and Tony narrowed his eyes at him a little. Peter just sent him a grin, teeth and everything.
"Yeah, I'm gonna have to leave now. Be good for your Mom, and I will see you real soon. Bye, Petey."
"When Tony became CEO, I went to him," Bruce said, not answering the question. That was answer enough for Steve. "I told him about my research and what Howard had been hoping for, but I didn't tell what Howard had planned to do with it."
“When, not if, when he finds out, this is going to come back to bite you in the ass.”
It felt like hours, even though it must have been maybe a minute. The lights dimmed, the helmet came down, and he felt the power rush through the lines through the suit. It didn't feel as heavy now, he could move, and he could get out of there, he could find Yinsen and get them out.
"I don't think that it would be convenient to move," Steve said, a little grudgingly. He didn't want to move away from Peter, because none of this was his fault. Mary nodded at him and took a couple steps back, and he could see when Agent Parker went back to being Mary.
Tony gasped, coughing, falling to his knees, when he was pulled back out of the water just as quickly as he had been shoved under. His arms were shaking, trying to keep him up. A shadow passed over Tony and he looked up, falling backwards onto his back when he saw one of the Leviathans passing overhead. He saw the Chitauri mothership and suddenly he couldn't breathe again. He was weightless, the dark abyss of space around him, the portal back to Earth gone.
Mary wished she would have moved a little faster, or maybe that Fury had been able to stall them a little longer. She thought that hopefully Phil and Steve would help Tony with pancake day, she might have a couple of broken bones after this one. She of course thought of Peter as the cement around the car crackled and fell, blocking the tunnel, instantly stopping the car and slamming her into the airbag with too much force, her vision going black.
"Yup!" Peter pulled out his school pencil, and opened his school notebook. "I have thirty-seven colored pencils now." Peter took care pronouncing the big number. "Daddy said that if I keep my collection growing, and if I do well in Art lessons, then he'll make me my own coloring room at his house!" The little boy was almost bouncing in his seat at the prospect.
Tony blinked, looking at Mary, and she stared back at him evenly. "I must have misheard you," Tony said eventually.
Hands on his arms. "No!!" Tony tried to back up, but he couldn't move. He was being pulled forward and up. "Let me go!"
Steve texted back, saying he’d need about ten minutes, and something about finding a shirt. It wasn’t even half the time when the elevator doors opened and Steve was walking over to them. Bucky nudged Wade’s arm a little as he pushed himself up. The two shared a brief look, both nodding to each other, and Steve sat down next to Wade, arm going out to wrap around the boy’s shoulders. Bucky moved back towards the elevator, set on going to the gym now, giving them some privacy.
"Meg had the twins," he said, running his hand through Tony's hair. He could still smell the embers from the welding machine of Tony's workshop in his hair, he must have been working in there before all the excitement.
"Not my boyfriend," Natasha said as Tony knocked twice, then opened the door to the room. Clint was perched, almost like a bird, on the top of the couch in Coulson's room, with the man himself finishing his tie in the mirror.
"Careful, or it might happen," Steve warned him. He reached out and took Tony's hand, lacing their fingers together.
.' Steve watched as everyone else was doing all the same moves, then his eyes slid back to watching Tony. '
“Flynn Rider does the
“Not technically. Obviously we’d like them to be, but we can’t always count on something not getting out.” Steve noticed that Wade was shuffling his feet a little, trying to slow them down. This was apparently a sign that he wanted to talk with Steve. “This one was more stealth.”
"Rhodey? Snap out of it, buddy. I need you-" Tony looked around, biting back the gasp of exhaustion that swept through his body. The suit was taking a toll on the arc reactor, and in turn his body. He hope Bruce would have all the calculations done and they could start immediately on the new element for the arc reactor. It could be synthesized by morning, and no one would have to worry any longer. "They're coming."
Tony’s eyes fluttered, and he woke up to a flurried sound of movement, hard thumps, and smacking sounds. He groaned, realizing he was on the ground, and pushed from his lying on his stomach to his side. He saw the kids toys, but didn’t see the babies, and his heart sped up.
"Think he broke my nose," Tony rasped out. "Probably some bruised ribs." He didn't mention that his new gauntlet was dented in and digging painfully into his hand, but it wasn't drawing blood, so it wasn't that important.
“Holy shit, Stevie,” Bucky mumbled in his breath. “You’re like a gossipy old rag.” Steve coughed out a laugh and elbowed Bucky’s stomach. “Well you are! You could probably tell me everything about all the parents here.”
“And now?” Mary asked. “I don’t see Steve around here, and Phil wouldn’t tell me where was, said that you would know.”
“This is so cool,” Peter said. “It’s different than Disney World.” Steve smiled at him, watching as the staff wheeled their luggage in. He had the shield settled in an art portfolio case, while Tony had brought one briefcase Iron Man suit, with another on the jet that he could activate with his watch, just in case. They were under no delusions that just because they were on a vacation meant that they were safe.
"Heavy lifting?" Bruce raised his eyebrows. "Aren't you supposed to be doing the unveiling of the Stark Tower concept in, like an hour?"
Mary looked over at him, easily reaching out to take the lump of clothing that Peter’s pressed into her arms. He ran back out of the room, last minute packing. “So not Malibu then.” Tony raised an eyebrow at her. “Peter won’t tell me where you guys are going, just that it’s going to be you, Mr Steve, Jamie, and himself. For your birthday.”
“I’m suspicious of them.” Bucky said, still looking between the two boys, a glance down to Jamie to make sure that she was still behaving.
"No, I have closets in the hallway bigger than this. Your old apartment had closets bigger than this." Tony closed the door and looked out into the living room, catching glimpse of Meg talking to an elderly man who handed her a casserole dish. There was a small couch and one chair situated in one corner, with a TV stand across from it, and in the other corner there seemed to be a crowded desk with smaller storage containers around it, and then a door that he assumed was the main bedroom. Tony pointed to the desk and looked back at his boyfriend.
Yay or nae?
"Yeah, a place where you two can have your lessons, or you can go too whenever you want." Tony thought about the plans he had been finishing. "And maybe Miss Meg can do some work in there. She can teach you about some new ways to do art."
"Yeah!" Peter exclaimed, he and Wade running for the door. Tony followed them, Steve stepping up next to him.
"I've got Peter," Tony said, looking back over at his little boy. His excited, smiling little boy, who had just a private art room, all to himself. His little boy that he was going to have to tell that his Mama wasn't going to be coming back for a little while, that she was sleeping, and it was going to be hard to wake her up. Tony never wanted any of these horrible things to happen to his son.
"You're Han Solo!" Peter exclaimed happily.
"You've seen him?" Mary raised an eyebrow. "After the raid on the base?"
"I can-" Tony turned a look on her and Mary stopped talking, giving a small smile back. "I'll stay just like this until you come back."
"Man of Iron," Thor greeted. "Your healers have tended to you well?" Tony glanced at the sling, then shrugged a little.
Every day they were down there with the eggs, and during the time Tony had obtained the evolution stones needed. Tony talked to them, and the one that Vee had predicted would hatch first, he laid a Fire Stone down next to it. “I think that one should be a Flareon,” Tony announced as he did it. He also pulled out a bowl of Luxury Balls, putting one down next to each egg. Tony had asked Vee if she wanted to upgrade to her own Luxury ball, even offered to paint it like Steve had, but she had turned it down. He smiled gently at her and nodded, understanding. He always had one ready, just in case she changed her mind.
Steve stopped in front of the workshop door, the windows blacked out, and he could hear loud music already blaring. He could also hear the familiar sound of repulsor blasts. Taking a breath he entered the override code, the little feeling that had been hoping to not have to use one of them for a long time flaking away, and pushed the door open.
“Fine,” he breathed out, waving his hand. “I’m fine. The shield is on the bottom of the car, hidden compartment. It should have popped by now. I’ve got the kids.” He thought Steve nodded, but he was moving from the car, and Tony wasn’t going to tell him that his vision was swimming and his head was throbbing. He suspected it was a concussion.
Steve's hand moved from his hair, sliding against his cheek, thumb rubbing against his cheek bone, and Tony let out a soft moan, feeling it move around his throat, and his eyes almost rolled back at the sensation. "Look at you," Steve whispered, and Tony's felt the words more than heard them, felt move through his body. "You're so,... Exquisite."
“And Mr Steve won’t?” Wade asked before he put a big piece of the elephant ear in his mouth. He moaned a little, grinning at the taste. “This is amazing!”
When they reached the side entrance to the Community Center, all the cameras setting up around the building, Tony and Steve saw Pepper waiting for them in the doorway. They both walked in, the door closing, and Pepper stood in front of Tony, smoothing down his tie of non-existent wrinkles.
"I did indeed," Tony nodded. He stared evenly back at Wade, then extended one arm and Wade moved in to hug him. Steve caught the whispers from Tony to the boy because of his enhanced hearing. "Everything's taken care of kiddo."
Tony started rubbing his nose. "Why is this our lives?" He muttered under his breath. "Okay, so, how do we get more information?"
“Love you, too,” Tony whispered through a smile. After a couple minutes, he let out a goofy little laugh and Steve raise his eyebrow a little. “Just, this is a little surreal to me. Me being in this bed, and happy, and with you, well, with anyone really.” There was almost a purr of happiness when Steve’s thumb started to rub gentle circles against his cheek. “The happiest I thought I could get was just being able to see my son a couple times a week. Thought we’d be doing the traveling from Manhattan to Queens for a while, and not just to drop them off at school. And you know, I was content with that.”
"We are not soldiers! I'm not marching to Fury's fife!" Tony looked away again.
Tony heard the sound of an engine pulling in to the garage, and then shutting off. “Vee!” He whispered excitedly as he turned towards the garage. “Jarvis is home now! I can’t wait to show you to him. He’s my best friend, and I know that he’ll be excited to meet you!” He hugged her before running off to meet Jarvis and Ana.
"I don't even think you have peanut butter in this house," Steve told him. "Or any kind of nut, actually."
Tony bristled a little. "Of the people in this room, which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit, and B, not of use?" Tony could give as good as he got.
"So, she'll be living upstairs, too?" Peter asked carefully, pulling his eyes back to look at Tony. Tony nodded a couple of times. “Are you gonna help take care of her?"
"So before you go thinking that I just got you a regular, future looking, pen, let me explain it." Tony stepped forward, motioning for Steve to pick up the pen. He noticed on the side was a piece of plastic, or glass, almost like the screen of his Starkphone. "This is something I've been working on for a bit, and I feel like I've got it to the point where other people can try it. I know that you and Peter like to draw, so may I introduce to you the most advanced drawing tool in your arsenal." Steve looked up at Tony with a raised eyebrow.
"You mean songs that you listen too?" Bruce smirked a little, watching Tony.
Tony turned her so she was facing Steve now, but was still sitting on his leg. “Oh, it’s going to be very unhappy for her growing up if she doesn’t break out of the sweeping movements phase,” Tony commented. “Seriously baby girl, that’s most of my life. I’m an active talker.”
He heard the shout from Thor, and turned just in time to have the hammer slam into his chest. He gasped, the suit actually giving way a little under it, the chest plate touching the arc reactor. The HUD flickered a bit, becoming an all too familiar thing now, and Tony glared, cocking his head a little to the side.
"The one that you mentioned over the phone?" Tony asked and Steve nodded.
. Suddenly Tony was there, pressing a thumb to the bottom of the display case, then slowly opened the glass. Steve looked at the man, and he nodded down towards the tags.
Steve ground his jaw together a little. Tony reached over and put his hands on Steve's knees, trying to ground him. "Natasha and Clint are already looking for another site, and I've got Jarvis going through all the information that SHIELD has. We'll know as soon as we get a hit." Steve nodded, putting his hands over Tony's. "Don't need you getting all righteous and angry just yet, not when there's no target to take it out on yet."
"We win!" Wade declared, running over to Steve.
"So, tell me more about Wade," Tony said, pulling Peter back up into his lap as he moved to lay on the couch. Peter moved so that he was sitting on Tony's stomach, facing him, smiling. Peter loved to be close to Tony, and to cuddle in any way. Surprisingly, Tony didn't mind as much as he thought he would. Pepper, and sometimes Peter, was still the only one who could actually hand stuff to Tony without a very visible reaction.
Steve glanced back one last time as he closed the oven, telling himself that he was not looking at Tony's butt, his well shaped, perfect size for his hands, ass. Nope.
"Have you been down here long?" Steve asked him.
"That's right," he nodded, reaching for the drink that the bartender handed him.
"Do you like it?" Peter asked, ticking himself into Tony's side.
"Jarvis is scanning traffic cameras," Natasha threw in. "I don't think that we're going to find anything though."
"Yeah, you guys can stay up with us," Tony said, dropping another kiss on the top of Peter's head.
"We're bringing in a team for this one," she told him as he turned on the tablet, looking at the files. "Like a response team, better freshen up." Steve looked through the names, seeing Stark's name. He looked up at her and she stared back evenly. "We're going to need his expertise, and maybe his firepower. Better make peace with your feelings."
Steve backed up a bit in the hallway as he heard Mary walking closer to the door. When she walked out, Jamie’s eyes were already at half-mast, but she saw him instantly and sat up in Mary’s arms. “Papa!” She squealed happily, and Mary chuckled a little.
“Why can’t you walk yet?” Peter asked her, not really expecting an answer. “If you could walk, then they wouldn’t need to watch you all the time.” She kept staring at Peter, and he wrinkled his nose a little. “You should learn how to take care of yourself, quicker. I was here first, you know.”
"What if he doesn't want to tell me?" Steve asked.
"You know I wouldn't do that," Steve said evenly. "But, would you forgive yourself is something happened while he was around?" Tony clenched his jaw, drawing in deeper breaths. "Soon enough, everything is going to be too much for you to keep hiding. Your walls are going to break, and you'll hate yourself."
Well, it had been a decent idea of a plan, was his first thought when he woke up in the morning, still wrapped around a sleeping Steve Rogers.
Tony was aware of Pepper stopping Steve from following him past a certain point, hidden from the cameras and reporters. Flashes started going off as soon as Tony got closer to the mic. Tony waited a couple of moments, looking out at them, putting names with faces, mentally putting together the pecking order for questions. His smile was up, his game was on, the counter had started.
"And the reviews were better than this first episode. Why aren't you making Steve watch this, too?"
"Records are made to be broken," Tony grinned,, putting all the thrust into the boots. He watched the altimeter on the screen, and just kept going straight up. "Come on!" He would make it, make it to ninety thousand or more.
“Yeah! Aw man, it was so cool!” Wade said with a grin. “I was jumping over the couch, and rolling across the floor, and right under a coffee table! It was awesome! Although, Bucky wasn’t too happy about it, so he’s teaching me how not to do that anymore, and he’s gonna teach me and Pete to do it right!”
Tony took a deep breath, resting his head against the cool tile of his bathroom floor. Jarvis had dropped the temperature for him, and a little shiver slipped down his spine. He hadn't had a hangover in nearly five months, and he was starting to remember why. It wasn't just the fact that Mary had caught him in the aftermath of a hangover after a particularly long Iron Man mission, and the fact that her eyes, full of disappointment haunted him- Actually, that was most of the reason. He hadn't been allowed to see, or even speak to Peter, for three days after that, and only after she made him breath into a breathalyzer. He couldn't blame her, but it had shamed him a bit more than he thought it would.
"Yeah, my bed is bigger than this one though." Peter's eyes widened a little more, and Tony chuckled a little. "I'm an adult, though, I need a bigger bed!"
"We saw a dog running through the park," Wade piped up. "And we caught the dog, and we found his owner, and she let us play with her dog!"
"An inspiration to us all, Stark." Tony heard the click of the safety coming off the weapon. "I'm not patient though. I'll still get-" The man slammed to the ground, the gun falling from his hands, and an all too familiar red, white, and blue shield was flying in the air.
"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist-"
"I'll make it up to her," Tony said, leaning against the desk gently, feeling his stomach roll gently. "I'll take Peter for Valentine's Day, so she and Agent can have a nice night, or whatever he might have planned."
"Because if we're going to have two bedrooms up there for the kids, then we need to have more room. With four of us up there, we'll need at least three bathrooms, specially with me, and when Jamie grows up." Tony looked at Steve, now with both eyebrows up. "Move in with me?" Tony rushed out. Steve blinked a couple of times at him. ".... Or not, just a suggestion. It's probably too fast though, and we've both just gotten back from some really big things. I'm probably really not thinking with a clear head, but I thought that you could paint a mural-"
"You're going to kill yourself Tony." She looked at him. The strong woman that she was, the only one that had been able to keep up with him. The only one he had for a long time. "I'm not going to be a part of it."
"For anyone normal, yes," Mary nodded a little. "But, we all know that Tony Stark is not normal. It's alright if you're not all for it and excited like everyone else." Tony wrinkled his nose at her, clearly not believing her words. "I'm serious."
"Some, yeah, he wanted me too." She wrinkled her nose a little and looked over at Bucky. "Report." All eyes were on Bucky now.
“I want to know that anything that I’m going to sit on is going to feel good, or that I’m not going to slip off of it, or even break it,” Steve argued. “Also we’ll need rugs, lots of rugs. With Jamie probably days away from walking on her own, there are bound to be a lot of stumbling, or falling, and I don’t want the stone and tile hurting. Also, Peter and Wade.”
"I got Natasha, and Sam, we're heading back for the Triskelion," Steve said quickly. At least Steve wasn't alone.
The thrilling conclusion to the Avengers movie! But not to the story. I'm trying to add more needed fluff moments, but I promise that there will be some in the next chapter, as I've already written some of it. I hope that some of your questions get cleared up in the chapter about what happened last time, if not, go ahead and ask, I'll answer if I can! I have vague plans for what's going to happen in future chapters, and that's all I need before the others start guiding me.
Tony looked at Steve, letting out a breath through his nose. They seemed to share the same thought; It could have gone worse.
Tony lifted his head a little, eyes craving the darkness, adjusting quickly, even if it was blurry without his glasses. “Steve,” Tony whispered a little. “I think I need help.” A sad frown crinkled Steve’s forehead, and he could see how the blonde wanted to reach out. It was just how they comforted each other. Tony pushed one arm out towards Steve, and the man almost surged forward at the offering. Both hands wrapped around Tony’s hand, feeling the slight twitches in his fingers. “What if Peter had been around? I wasn’t seeing anyone, I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t know that I had called the suit. What if I had hurt our kids?”
Mary squeezed his hand once. “Alright, so that’s the arc reactor, and Phil told me about the Expo.”
"It's only until he's 18," Julie told him with a little smile. "Because we both know that you wouldn't be able to adopt him."
“Hawkeye, keep an eye for the next attack, see if you can’t get a bead on the trajectory and location,” Steve said, doling out moves. It was almost like training. “Falcon, War Machine, do a perimeter around the building, check for any other impact sights. Widow, scan for possible set-ups locations, even possible sniper nests.” Tony looked at Steve who was looking out the window at him. “Iron Man, do you know if we looking at something mechanical or organic yet?”
"Color on the paper, baby." There was the rustling of papers, and the movement of some crayons and markers. "Come say Hi to Da-"
"No way," Bruce shook his head. "You have been doing all the heavy lifting, literally, you made that Tower. You've done nothing but go on about it, and you have a concept for the energy, and it Works, Tony."
"No, you're not," Tony said and Peter looked up at him. "But you don't need all of it like you used, too." Peter's features scrunched up in a mix of anger and confusion. "You're growing up so fast, and I'm gonna sound like the sappy Dad here, but it's true. You're really smart, and you're able to do a lot without my help, or Mama's help, anymore. Do you like when we hover over your homework?"
“I know that look,” Bucky said quietly behind him, leaning against the wall. “Nothing good happened, did it?”
What to look forward too in the next story? More fluff, more Tony and Steve interacting, and actually getting some where, more Angst, and Captain America 2. Dun Dun Dun. And of course more Peter! Peter growing up and aging.
That bad feeling in Tony's guts rumbled around a little more. "Well, we've been able to figure out the formula that they've been using for the knock-off Serum." Tony held up his hand before Steve could get too excited. "It's the one that Bruce developed with Howard. They have some of Howard's journals."
“That’s kind of what I was hoping you would tell me,” Steve admitted quietly. “I’m already pretty lost with all this magic stuff, and with the fact that I know Loki is back, but can’t do anything about it right now. He’s the only one who has the most knowledge about what’s happening to Loki, and I’m not above trying to exploit that.” Steve ran a hand through his hair, glancing over at Tony. “I don’t know how long this is going to last. I don’t know what he’s going through right now, and there’s nothing I can do to help it. I’m feeling pretty helpless.”
"She has red and orange hair," Tony said as he leaned around Steve, taking in the small house.
“That happens twice, and suddenly you think we gotta watch the kid-“
“No, not completely alone,” Tony agreed with him. Steve glanced at him, and it seemed that the older man understood what Wade meant. “Jarvis is of course watching, and we’ve got the Tower on non-essential lock-down. Todd is stationed at the end of the hall, with an eye on all the cameras.” Wade nodded a little, snuggling back against his mom. Of course, he wanted to protect his mom.
"I'm glad to see that you got the tree finished on the night of Christmas Eve, Sir," Jarvis said and Tony was in the process of rolling his eyes. "I was certain that you would still be working on it until Boxing Day."
"How can adding songs be erratic?" Tony asked, but grabbed his tablet to pull up the playlist. He scrolled down to the new songs, watching another song being added as it refreshed. "Ew, he added his own theme song? And Coldplay? Who introduced him to them?? You were right, Jarvis, this is a travesty."
"What do you mean?" Steve asked, pulling on a pair of socks.
Tony groaned a little. "Well, there goes the surprise." He rubbed his face a little and walked over to Bruce. "Yeah, that's Mary there, but we're not a thing. Like I said, we're friends, who also happen to be co-parents?" Bruce raised his eyebrows, again, at Tony. "That's our son, Peter. He turned six last October."
Steve fixed the wide brimmed hat he had tucked on Jamie’s head as they got out of the car in front of the hotel. The weather in California was different than New York, but he noted, not entirely in a bad way. Jamie reached up to play with the edge of her hat, but Steve stopped her from taking it off, holding her close to his chest. Peter had grabbed his backpack, sliding out of the car first, with Tony close behind him to keep an eye on him, and Steve not far behind, taking in the sight of the large building.
"It's for a good reason," Tony said with a soft smile. He leaned in and kissed Steve's shoulder, trailing his fingers along his side, delighting when a shiver ran through Steve's body. "Thoughts of you still rolling around my brain, and it makes me sound sappy as shit." Steve chuckled quietly. "Seriously, I should only get like that when it comes to my kid, and even then it doesn't get this bad. I have a reputation to uphold you know."
She turned her head to look back at Tony. “Hey there gorgeous, why the long face?” She wiggled her nose a little. “Yeah, I know. Papa’s being mean, isn’t he? He wants to send you off for the night.” Steve’s expression deadpanned in Tony’s direction. “I know you’re a good girl, though, and you can do this.”
“I’ll seek someone out about magic before I find myself willingly making a visit to Reed Richards,” Tony grumbled against Steve’s skin. “I hear Doctor Strange has recently made his way into the strange world of not normal, or some such nonsense that I didn’t want to pay attention too until just now.” Steve placed a soft kiss on the top of Tony’s head. “Maybe I’ll make a visit, at a semi-decent hour for humans.”
"Didn't I?" Tony looked back over to her. "I made the suit, I put on the suit, I made myself a target."
"No, no, everything's fine," she assured him. "Just came up here to see how you were doing."
“I’m working on it,” Tony said, punching Steve’s arm. “Go change, whiner. I’ve got the fuzzy creature.”
Steve leaned down to pass the baby to Tony, but stayed there for a second before he was kissing Tony, hand cupping his cheek. "I'll try not to take too long," Steve told him, smiling before heading for the bathroom.
"The whole damn city," Tony commented, hand resting on Peter's back, who was napping lightly on Tony's chest. "I figure everyone deserves a little excitement today, so I set up all the fireworks displays for New York City."
"You get to see Peter more than he does," she said simply with a shrug of her shoulders. "If I'm working late you get to pick him up from school, and you're teaching him art."
Everyone had been invited to Jamie’s first birthday party, just like Peter’s. There had been no answer from Barton and Romanoff, but Bucky wasn’t going to miss another party because they wanted to play games, specially not for his goddaughter. They had made it up to Peter by making a special breakfast for him the morning after his birthday, and giving him his gifts. This time Meg had been across the country, unable to get back in time thanks to one of the sculptures she was working on and a shipping mistake that couldn’t wait if they wanted to salvage the project. She made sure Bucky had brought her present for the little girl, and her apologies to Tony and Steve, again.
"I wouldn't-"
"They put in a little self-destruct sequence for us." Tony grinned a little. "Alright, first one to the device gets the honor of-" Tony turned when an alarm blared to the side of the HUD, and a something was slamming into the chest plate and throwing him back. The HUD of the helmet flickered before going dark. Tony drew in a deep breath and quickly reached up, catching the latches and forcibly pushed the helmet off. The light of the sun hit his face and he let out a breath. Then he remembered where he was. "Shit."
"You're going to do it." Her eyes widened a little at Tony's words. "Go to the central console, open up all the circuits." She was already moving, running inside of the building as he gave directions. "When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know, you're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here."
"This, this is inhumane!" Tony shouted, closing his eyes after a second, everything spinning. "It's against my rights, or some kind of bullshit! I've been violated!"
"That, I'm not sure about." Mary took her bag from Steve's hand, dropping it on the couch, then jingled the keys a bit. "Let's get you over to your place now, though. My life isn't nearly as entertaining as some of the things that you'll discover in this time." Steve nodded and followed her out of the apartment, reaching forward to hold the door open as she walked through. "Word of advice, Captain, never lose your sense of manners," Mary said smiling. She walked across the hall and used the keys from the new keychain to open the door, but this time held it open for Steve to walk in first.
"Perhaps for his birthday, Sir," Jarvis told him. "Perhaps he will take up painting next."
"If you'll follow the lights in the ceiling, I can direct you to one, Dr Banner." A couple of the lights above the lab door started to flash, and Bruce followed them. Tony watched him go, and flopped down into one of the chairs by the crate. He closed his eyes and took a breath. He had been beginning to lose hope that Bruce would ever be able to make it, and that if he did he would be too late. There was still that possibility, but Tony wasn't going to give up yet, not just yet.
“I attempted to help Anthony with a problem, and I ran into a few complications,” Strange kept talking, not noticing what was happening just behind him. “On a promise to Rogers, I gathered my resources to bring him back, and I needed the help of others, including Loki.”
Tony let out a huff through his nose and gently got up with Peter in his arms. Coulson was just a couple rooms down the hall, a light still on. Tony knocked on the door and Phil wasted no time answering it, letting Tony come in.
"Hey, no one's listening in on this call," Tony assured him. "I had Jarvis make the call, and I've made some upgrades to my beloved since we've last talked."
"He gets clingy," Tony practically whispered, sitting on the edge of Mary's bed as he held Peter. "I didn't think that he would want to sleep alone tonight, I probably should have warned you."
They had gotten Steve? Tony blinked, and realized that his eyes weren't open. Steve was over him, holding onto his arms, keeping him from falling off the bed, not restraining him. Tony tried to pull away quickly, almost slipping off the bed again, his head headed straight for the corner of the bedside table, and Steve pulled him back up into his chest. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's body, and he froze.
"She put a limit on the drinks?" Steve asked.
“Good luck,” Bucky huffed. Steve was looking at him with one eyebrow up. “The kid ratted, didn’t he?”
"Tony-" Tony waved his hand to cut off Steve.
“This Tony Stark,” Pepper started, motioning to him as he tried to take Jamie’s shoes before she threw them. “This Tony is different than any other Tony I’ve known before. I like this Tony Stark the best.”
"I just thought that I would have to set up a phone charging system for you after telling him that all flights had been canceled," she said, following behind him on the cleared path. She tucked her hands under her arms and huffed out a breath.
"You- bu- wha?" Tony felt like his brain had shut down. "I just talked for like, five minutes, probably without taking a breath."
But dare he open it? Who knew how much longer this poor pokemon had inside the ball though? They had already lost two others, and Tony’s little heart broke for them, but he had the chance to save this one, to at least try. It wouldn’t be too much to just play with the little one, right? What if it wasn’t little though? The public only knew about the two pokemon that went down with Captain America, Braviary and Arcanine. Those that knew him knew that he hadn’t started off with those pokemon, and they hadn’t be his only ones. They were the only ones that he ever risked in the War though.
“They aren’t good,” he said.
“I can understand doing that with chocolate but strawberry,” said Clint.
“You okay, big guy?”
"I'm fine," said Tony.
"Put him under before he kills us."
"To speak with you, Piper."
“It’s fine. I had nine years of seeing all the colors,” he said.
“Natasha,” he said.
“Mmmhmm."
Steve relaxed back into the couch. The scent of another omega. It was a pumpkin cinnamon smell.
Steve stared at him, wide-eyed.
"Hungry?"
Howard Anthony Walter Stark
She would make it up to them. Make it up to them by getting them out of there.
“Some physical testing to see if you were affected by spending all that time in the ice. You won’t have to perform a speed test. We clocked your speed at 65mph,” said Phil.
“What? It wasn’t like he was going to hand over his car keys to a three-year-old willingly,” she said with a shrug.
The pup burst out with laughter. What had he said? He'd only mentioned a skill. She seemed to think his confusion was even funnier. And laughed even harder.
“Blue.”
June 10, 2012
“A little help,” she said.
“Steve, you need to get out in the world. The Peles Castle is only an hour and a half train ride away,” said Natasha.
"It wasn't a date."
She put the brushes back, wiping the paint on her hands off on her overalls. She slid off the stool and left, locking the door behind her.
“Merry Christmas buddy,” said Tony.
“Stand down. I’ve come here to say a personal goodbye to one of our prisoners.”
“Fine.”
"No, you don't." Tony got out of bed. "You get started on breakfast. I need to shower."
“Do you have the necessary items you for when you do?” asked Edith.
"You're exaggerating," said Steve.
“Anything?” asked Steve.
Lena sat in the chair next to her bed. She shouldn’t be in that chair. Papa, Daddy, or maybe even Winter should be there. There were at least five other people she’d truly prefer.
“It’ll be for less than a minute,” said Edith.
“Tony.”
“My name is Matt Murdock."
She was thrown into a room, only to be slammed against the wall seconds later.
“Who showed you this? Who controls the would be king?” asked Thor.
“We have him on a cocktail of barbiturates. And he’s still responding like that,” said Fury.
“I didn’t mean to worry you. I went feral,” he said. He hung his head. It wasn’t something he was proud of. Instead of helping Tony instinct took control, making him hide and cower. That wasn’t him. He’d never run from a battle before.
Those dull blue eyes met hers.
“Piper will be up in an hour maybe more,” said Steve.
“I haven’t seen you talk to Dr. Barny since I got here,” Piper said.
“I learn you had your pup nine days after she’s born.”
“Why? He can just make us,” said Rune.
"We're in a place where we can support a big family. Imagine what it will be like for this one to be the only one like it,” he said.
“We are five miles outside of Rose Hill, Tennessee.”
"Wonderful, remember to eat and stay hydrated. And don't hesitate to call."
“You’re here now,” replied Tony.
“So?” asked Steve.
“I know none of these will be able to replacement Doris, but I think these three might suit you,” said Phil.
"You can believe me or not I don't care."
“Are you okay?” asked Edith.
“What bike is this?” asked Steve.
“Omega.”
“That’s your car Dr. Barny?” asked Piper.
"They're in the lab," said Jarvis.
"And I wanted some quality time with my goddaughter," she agreed.
“Morning?”
“I have a medical question,” he said.
“His heat only comes every three months,” said Tony.
“That is preferable, but other physically loving touches will help prevent such reaction from occurring again."
“No, but thank you, Jarvis."
“You weren’t the omega who dreamed of his ring,” she said.
“Don’t do that.” That smile that wasn’t real. He didn’t like it.
“That’s going to have to do.” He pulled the cables from his armor. “We can do both."
"What are their conditions?"
Steve didn’t like the word
“Steve, you're the most loveable gentle giant I know. And more importantly, she knows it, too.”
He snarled at Edith. His opinion of her hadn't changed. He didn't want her near his mate, but her presence was necessary. Four betas nurses were with her. They introduced themselves. He couldn't care less about their names. His mate was the only thing that mattered.
“I brought in your mail,” said Rhodes.
“Make it stop! Make it stop!” she pleaded.
It was reasonable excuses to get out of therapy, even if it were only for an hour. His dreams and what he saw were the last things he wanted to talk about. That could wait. He went to the lab. Natasha was watching TV on the computer.
They turned. Steve stood with his shield at the ready, only wearing shredded pants.
“Yeah.”
He left his omega. Denying every instinct to stay, but eventually got out the front door. “Jarvis, lock-up."
Piper woke up in Winter's arms. The alpha had fallen asleep standing up, yet his arm remained securely around her, making sure she wouldn't fall.

Soon, the bite guard was removed and he was allowed to sit up. He was in a room full of strangers, an occurrence he'd long become used to. The graying alpha in front of him was clearly in charge.
“That’s who I smelled on you,” said Tony. He clenched the steering wheel. Why was he getting possessive? Tony hated the lack of control.
"Does Friday work?" asked Steve.
“I’m sorry for bringing you in on this in your current condition," he said.
“You may be too little to actually remember this when you’re older,” Steve said to Jamie softly, “but this is going to be a semi-regular thing. Us going on vacations as a family, and your Daddy and brother getting into trouble within the first five minutes. It’ll drive you nuts, but you’ll get used to it, and not in a bad way.” He kissed her cheek and she gave him a happy chirp. “Your Daddy and brother used to live here in California, so we might be coming out here more often, but I can’t find anything wrong with that notion.”
"Really?" Tony gave her a disbelieving look. "I'm not happy about it because now it means that you have someone else to depend on when it comes to Peter." Mary blinked, not expecting that answer to come from Tony. "He gets to stay down on your floor, living with two parents at the same time, like any other normal kid. I know I'm not going to be the first one to be called when he has a nightmare, or wants to have a sleepover with friends, or comes home with an A on his test. I'm not the first one anymore." Tony couldn't stop the words from coming out now. He didn't notice how his chest was heaving a little, breathing heavily as he kept rambling on. "And it's stupid, because it's selfish, but I liked that. I liked being the one you would have to call, or turn too when it came to stuff with Peter. It's because I know I can't be the same full-time parent that you are- Yeah, I know we've talked about it, but it's still true. I'm not you." Tony looked down at his knees, that he noticed he had brought up closer to his chest.
And then, he wasn't flying anymore, he was falling. He let out a shout, the boots shorting out at the top of his arc. At least there was sand below him, not rock, not mountain side.
Mary pulled up in front of her apartment building, and Steve studied it. The building was smaller than he thought, and he only saw four mailboxes by the one door. Mary got out, and Steve quickly figured out the new handle and slid out of the car as well, moving forward to take the bags from Mary as she pulled them out of the backseat. She blinked then gave him a smile in response.
"Daddy!" Peter launched himself at Tony, wrapping his arms around Tony's neck. Tony gasped a little, surprised, then realized what was happening and he wrapped his arms around Peter immediately, closing his eyes tightly. "Daddy, I was so scared, and then you were gone, and I couldn't find you, then Mama was there..." Peter started to let out little sniffles, bumbling through his words and thoughts.
"Jarvis, lights at 70% please," Tony said quietly, the lights dimming in the room. "I thought you two would staying at your parents place." They both headed over to the couch, Tony gently sitting down, careful not to disturb Peter. "And how did you get in here without Jarvis telling me?"
He could already hear Tony preparing a lecture about calling it hacking.
"What the hell is up with the cherries?" Tony asked immediately. The last time he had seen a mood change that fast was when Peter found out that Wade actually could go to summer camp with him two years ago. Or himself in front of a paparazzi camera.
"Not a social call," Rhodey agree. "I don't think you can keep this away forever, Tony." Tony knew what he was talking about. They wanted one of the suits. Pepper could only fight off injunctions, and subpoenas for so long.
He wasn’t entirely sure, but he was sure that his eyes watered a little, and he pulled Peter into a tight hug. “Yeah, yeah of course you can. I mean,” Steve drew in a deep breath, and knew that he was probably smiling like a crazy person, “I’d really like that Peter.” Peter wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck as he hugged him back. “I’d really like that.” Steve had practically pulled Peter into his lap, and hadn’t realized it until he felt Peter trying to adjust himself without slipping. Steve lifted him easily and sat him down in his lap. “So, I think, together, we should pick out the food for everyone.” Peter smiled up at him and nodded. Steve bit his lip, trying to bring down the smile that was starting to hurt his cheeks, and ruffled Peter’s hair a little.
Bruce had everything well in hand, and Tony was happy for it. He was now cuddled up with Peter in his arms, resting against his chest. He had thanked Coulson profusely, and let himself calm around the mere presence of Peter. He forgot all about Steve Lying Rogers, and just held onto Peter.
"Do you even know who you're talking too? Most people don't talk to me like this."
"Honestly? No. But, maybe I could show Rachel his way and let her take it all out on him." Tony's fingers of his good hand were flying over the screen of his phone. "Also, I wouldn't trust Thor and Loki alone at SHIELD, at least not with Fury. We gotta figure out something to do with the Cube, and Reindeer Games, and it'd be better if we were all in the same place. Jarvis will be able to keep people out of where they aren't supposed to go. Just have to figure out a way to contain him though," Tony murmured.
Tony heard Bruce sigh. Heard him sigh about four times in fact. It took Bruce Banner exactly Three minutes and Twenty-Three seconds to make a decision. "Alright. I'll come as soon as I can."
"Nope." Tony shook his head back and forth. "Because, those bad people would have used that bad thing to hurt lots of other people. They might have hurt you, and so I had to make sure that that didn't happen." Tony carded his fingers through Peter's hair. "But you want to know what's more important?" Little hazel eyes looked up at him. "That today is your birthday!" Peter suddenly grinned and jumped up, hands and knees knocking into Tony, making him grunt and chuckle.
"I'll find you," he promised. He leaned over and kissed Jamie's forehead. Steve watched Tony walk down the hall towards the other apartment where Peter was, and Steve turned to head for the elevator. When the doors closed he let out a long breath, letting his head drop back briefly.
"-don't know. He's not answering his phone." Mary looked over at Pepper as they got into the cars. "Please go over there and make sure everything's okay." Peter was with Tony. "Thank you, Rhodey." Rhodey, the Colonel, she could trust him to keep them safe. Now she didn't have to commandeer the car form Coulson.
So, this took me a little longer to finish, because I was thinking I could wrap up the first movie in this chapter.... It happened, but it took a little longer. But you guys get a Really long chapter in exchange. Obviously, this is no where near the end. I'll be posting some pictures, on my Tumblr, into the crazy planning I went through for this, and how this ended up way beyond my expectations. (megaranoelle.tumblr.com) Unbeta'd as usual.
And he was still there to help him a week later. The next Friday Tony finally felt like he was able to take a breath without the familiar stirrings of a cough. It was still there of course, but his lungs were looking much better, and he was able to leave the bed. Which seemed to be just in time.
"He talked to me until you came," Peter said softly.
"I could have been less of a dick sometimes."
"You wanna try feeding Conor?" Tony glanced over at Mary, who was leaning in towards Peter. She tossed over a bottle to Tony, then held out another bottle to help Peter.
"I no longer have cover working for Stark Industries," she confirmed, nodding.
"I left the key to your apartment in mine, so bear with me." Mary used a different key to open her door, holding it open for Steve once again, and dropped off her jacket on a highbacked chair by the door. Steve stopped in the entryway and looked around. These apartments were much bigger than he had ever seen, even the apartment that Bucky and his family lived in. The living room was very large, two couches there, and the largest TV he had ever seen. The dining room was separate from the kitchen, and the kitchen even had an island in the middle, giving more counter space than he thought his favorite local diner used to have.
Tony had never been more thankful for an uncomfortable position when trying to sleep. He had nodded off a few times, but never fell deep enough to sleep that he could dream. He tried pushing every aside, just enjoying that Steve was actually there, he was warm, and alive. He'd be going home, and he see his son, his Peter. He could try and pretend that none of it happened, at least for a little bit. That's all he wanted. To keep pretending that he was going to be okay, that the only thing he needed to worry about was that he was turning thirty-five in a couple weeks.
"We haven't talked in over five years," the man told him calmly. Tony could hear the background noise of people talking, and horns and cars. Seems he had still called during busy hour in India.
Peter giggled when Tony flashed a grin at the camera, stepping back up to let the suit come back around him. He had created a holographic model of the new Stark Tower on stage, and he would use his theatrics to show it off as he explained it. Tony Stark was very good at his job.
Steve was searching through ebay, (with Jarvis's help), looking for some replacement Captain America cards, when Peter and Wade ran up to him. They stopped inches away from his legs, and they both stared at him, quietly, something brewing behind their eyes. Steve raised his head a little to look at them. These two were going to be troublemakers as they got older.
Tony was standing up now. Loki's scepter was in his hand, and his head was tilted down, looking at it. "Tony?" Steve asked hesitantly. Something didn't feel right.
"What?" Tony turned to face them, his own club soda in his hand as he crossed his arms. "Peter likes the zoo! It's like a living zoo in the wild."
His bike was still in the same spot, thankfully untouched, and he ran over to it. He slid the shield on the front as he slid on the seat, pushing back a little so he could rearrange Wade to sit in front of him. He wasn’t going to take the chance of Wade behind him, so much more so when a couple more bullets hit the street behind him. Steve started his bike, looking behind him, and saw the guard was running out with his own weapon.
"So that makes him incapable of making his own decisions?" Bruce asked carefully. "And he's only about seven years younger than you, that's not much of an age difference." Tony scrunched up his face.
"Who is this?" She asked after a couple of seconds, and Steve could imagine that she thought that he was going to be the next guy to show up on the news, right next to this George character.
"Oh?" Mary was trusting him to handle their sons first crush?! Was she crazy?? "Why did she say that? Your Mama would know more than I would about Valentines."
William and Rachel walked off with Peter, and Tony let out a big breath. He gathered the plate and two cups, taking them over to the sink. He turned, catching Steve and Bruce's eyes, before pointing between them. "The only thing that's going to happen is that someone is going to make blueberry pancakes. That's it." The two men blinked at him. "Peter expects it, but I don't want a party, I don't want a celebration. My birthday is not worth celebrating, not this year."
"Got Widow and Hawkeye with me," he reported. He was still in Captain America mode. "Are you in the field?"
“Buh-ee,” she said, giving a little giggle. “Buh-ee.”
He managed to get Peter to wake up enough to change into his pajamas and then tucked him under the blankets, slipping a stuffed animals into his arms. Tony took a quiet pleasure in acting like what he thought a normal parent would do, one who hadn't grown up in the spotlight of cameras and privilege. It was also another reason why he was generally alright with Peter living full time with Mary, because he wanted Peter to have a somewhat normal upbringing. He wanted Peter to be able to understand how everyone lived, to be able to connect on some level with people who did weekly grocery shopping on their own, those that lived on a budget and didn't shop exclusively at designer stores, and where eating out was a luxury event, not an option that could happen if you were bored.
“Probably not the bad news your thinking,” Tony commented. She raised an eyebrow at him. “Steve filled me in on what happened, and Jarvis gave me a little show, so I’m all caught up. I’m not gonna kick you out, but I’m gonna want all the information you know about your Aunt.”
"Yes, immediately. Oh, be sure to let him know that his new nickname is going to be Chewy-Bear. No, Wookie-Bear!” Tony started to laugh again.
"If I can stab an assassin, I think I can do this." Tony heard her take a couple of near silent breaths. "Okay, I'm doing it now." He heard the lick of the lock, and watched the two agents on the camera push the door open, each pulling a pistol into their hands. The first woman was halfway in, the second woman right behind her.
"She was being held by Hydra?" Steve had whispered his question.
There was some chatter in the background. "Okay, good, cause I'm staring at one right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come."
“This is my life.”
"I'll send you an update in a few hours." He turned back to his tablet, and Mary started to head for the elevator. She paused for a second.
Tony felt his back straighten, and he held himself differently. The twins noticed this immediately. "What right do you have to force me to experiment on her??" He hissed out, pulling his wrist away from Pietro. "You know, you may have volunteered for whatever Strucker did to you, but she did not. She didn't even have a right to her creation."
“Don’t embarrass yourself, Tony,” Bucky said, little smirk on his lips. Tony shot a narrowed eye expression his way. “You sure you two can handle three babies?”
"There are so many things I could say," Steve started. He pulled Tony a little, pushing open the door until he was stepping out. He left Tony standing just inside the gym, then leaned down, kissing Tony softly, gently. Tony's hand reached up for Steve's face, but Steve pulled his head back. "So, I guess we'll have to do this a different way."
There was a grinding noise that had Tony turning around. He saw the assembly unit stalling, a couple sparks. "Apologies sir, but the assembly unit has not taken the calibrations for the new suit." Tony swore under his breath and walked over to the platform.
"You split up?" Steve said, going back to his low voice.
“Nope,” he pat Steve’s chest a couple of time, then turned to leave the room. Steve rolled his eyes fondly. “You get to unpack everything, and do laundry, now. I’m going to go get the little monster, sticking you with all the chores.”
“Hurting it so much that you sneak into my playlist,” Steve replied, eyes closing and practically purring at Tony’s touch. “And it’s not exactly my gift, I just get pointed in the right direction and I go with it. Meg is constantly adding songs as well. She lived the Nineties, and early Two-Thousands, so she’s the resident expert.” Tony groaned and buried his face in Steve’s neck. Steve hummed and turned his head a little to kiss the side of Tony’s head. “I love you.” He felt Tony mouth the words back against his neck and he smiled.
“Papa.” She said firmly and Steve looked down at her. “No.” Tony’s shoulders were bunching up as he looked like he was about to melt from the cuteness of it all, and shake apart from the laughter that he was trying to keep in. Jamie settled her head back on his shoulder, and wiggled to get comfortable again.
"Not until he wakes up Mary," Tony hissed.
That was what Tony had once said. It had all been a front, that's what Tony was good at, deceiving. He had turned it into an art form, out of necessity.
"Oh, you have got to be kidding me." Tony instantly saw where this was going. "He thought that I was making my move?" Steve nodded. "So he goes full tilt crazy ex? Some sort of 'If I can't have them, no one can have them?'"
“Wait, what?” Steve said with a frown, but Wade and Peter were already off to the elevator, Jarvis helping in their speedy escape. Mary just sighed, dropping her face into her hand.
Tony turned over the Asgardian metal carefully, and winced a little when he saw what looked to be little metal burrs on the inside. They looked like they would be painful. "Why does it feel like they made this specifically for you Prancer?" Maybe it he could antagonize Loki a little, it would buy them the few extra minutes they would need. "Legends call you Silvertongue, right?" Loki turned his glare to Tony now. "Have they used it on you before? Just how much does it hurt?"
"I'll tell him that it's for work, which is true." Steve wished that Tony would look at him. "It isn't a radio silence mission," he said quietly. "I just won't be around in the Tower. We can still talk on the phone, or video chat."
"I'd like to offer the heartfelt words of, it's about time," William said with a smile. Coulson snorted softly with a smile, his arm around Mary's shoulders.
"Is that so?" Pepper waited for an answer, but he really didn't have one that she wanted to hear. "Well, then I quit."
“Nothing serious I hope, considering how late it is.”
"Enjoy your special date. Thanks again, Steve. I'll talk to you later." He smiled and nodded as she hung up. Steve slipped his feet into the black shoes on the floor, then slipped into the bathroom to check his hair. He had gotten a haircut the day before, and had somehow managed to keep Tony from seeing it yet. It helped that Tony had been out doing last minute board meetings with Pepper for SI, and spending the night with Peter.
"Tomorrow, bud," Tony said, reaching over to mess up Peter's hair. "If we start it now, it'll go past your bed time."
“We’ll keep her cheered up, until Papa comes back with Wade!” Mary smiled at Peter, kissing his forehead.
“I’m not a huge fan of people in my head, considering that the last few times someone has been in there, it hasn’t exactly been pleasant.”
"I don't see how I can," Steve replied. They needed Loki, and he need to get Stark before he got himself killed.
"He'll probably sleep for another forty-five minutes," Tony continued. Natasha walked over and Tony caught her eyes. "Does this mean you're officially out of my actual business?" Steve glanced between Tony and Natasha.
"Thanks," Tony said quietly, then gave a little nod. At the nod the elevator doors opened and the two men stepped onto the floor. Tony kissed Steve lightly, then rubbed Jamie's cheek in his arms a little, before stepping further into the apartments. Wade and Peter were sitting on the couch, having changed clothes.
Steve had expected that Tony would have made a floor for everyone. "So, when Mary said that she would be staying here...?"
“Only if you add too much salt, to something that doesn’t need it.” He leaned to kiss Tony before they both sat down at the island bar.
"We have to try!" Steve pulled Stark back up to his feet and looked the man in the eyes. "You are not going to give up on Peter!" That seemed to bring a little spark back to Tony's eyes.
“Go exercise with him, and I’m sure he’ll share,” Mary said with a smile.
“I would advise against continued use of the suit, Sir,” Jarvis said in his ear. “But, taking into account your propensity of stubbornness, I would suggest staying upright.” Tony made to roll his eyes, but took a sharp breath when it caused a painful spike, and a roll of his uneasy stomach. “You have a severe concussion, Sir, please do refrain from making sarcastic gesture with your eyes.”
"Then I'll come out to you, the suit can land anywhere." Tony looked over to see the Mark XXXIII standing there.
“So you would just lean against the car, watching school get out?” Steve asked as they got out of the car, walking towards the school. “Like a creeper, who was plotting which child they would take when no one was looking?”
"I'm not exactly the best person-"
"Steve! You crazy bastard! Oh my gods!" She shrilled out, and even Tony winced a little, unmuting his line.
"Your Daddy loves you so much, and we both will always make sure your safe," Steve told Peter seriously. The little boy reached over for a hug and Steve moved closer. Peter wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, and Tony let the little boy transfer himself to Steve's arms.
"That seems to be the general consensus," Tony muttered with a little smile. "Well, I'll give you the heads up, Peter is returning with his grandparents and Wade, and we're having a large family dinner upstairs."
Tony chuckled a little. "Kids are the first kidnapping targets, followed by the spouse."
"Hey, come on," Obie interrupted him. "In public, the press. This was a board of directors meeting."
"No!" The woman suddenly shouted over the phone. "Don't let her go! It is so ridiculously not safe there right now. You should totally do lock down procedures yourself, or something, I don't know." Bruce tapped the screen, showing Tony a dot in Baltimore. "Shit, I'd rather be dealing with out silver armed friend, right now." That was raising red flags in Tony and Bruce's mind. The talking over the phone stopped, and there was the soft click of something. "Hydra, freaking Hydra is inside SHIELD," she started to whisper over the phone. She had obviously entered a different room, locking the door.
"Of course not, I've got a son that needs attention, so obviously nothing is normal right now," Tony said, trying to make light of the subject. Something that was not unlike Tony Stark, at all. "I have to Watch my alcoholic intake now, Rhodey!" Rhodey couldn't help but roll his eyes a little.
Good times!
"I'm lost, pretty freaking scared, and I just wanna get my kids." Meg's quiet voice said, reminding Tony that she was still there.
"You were right," Steve said as he stood back up, and Mary looked over at him. "His Dad had promised dessert." Mary chuckled and nodded and the two headed over to her apartment. "Does he regularly do that? Promise dessert?"
"Still annoyingly cold," Steve responded, and the camera moved a bit as Steve crawled into his bed.
When they finally called it a day and headed for the emptying parking garage, Jamie was still Hyper while the boys were starting to run out of steam. The art fair had been full of games for the boys to play, and Steve had gotten a few ideas for some new art techniques he’d like to try. Steve noted that Tony looked a little lighter, not as stressed as he had since they had gotten back to the Tower. He resigned to making sure Tony got out of his workshop more often, to destress.
"I was a little jealous," Steve admitted and Tony frowned. "Peter talks about you all the time, and I thought that I would never have that, never had a kid of my own talking about me like that to someone."
“Wait,” Meg called out while looking at the text on Tony’s phone. The Soldier stopped, and Meg frowned at Tony as well. “If you want this, you’ll probably have to use my proper first name,” she muttered. “Report any known information on Margrit Rosenfeld.” Tony and Steve both raised their eyebrows. “It’s German.”
“Glad to know that something don’t change,” Tony murmured with a soft smile.
========
Steve frowned a little. Howard wouldn't have done that, would he? Not the Howard that Steve knew at least. But if Steve really thought about it, how well did he know Howard Stark? "He started to drink, a lot," Tony continued. "I never really had a close relationship with him, or one in general." Tony put the top back on the decanter, slowly putting it back, but didn't close the door on it. "Do you know how I met Bruce? It was by accident really. Bruce is older than me. I met him after I took over Stark Industries. He had waited to schedule a meeting with me, not wanting to meet with Obadiah, and now I really can't blame him." Steve could tell there was another story there. "He told me that Howard had been funding his research, the same research that turned him into the Hulk."
“What do we call him?”
“An omega.”
“I would have gotten you,” said Tony.
“Yes, sir."
“And there’s another person you pissed off his name was Phil,” said Tony before sending Loki back with repulsors.
“Security breach.”
“What are you talking about?”
“What?”
“Do you want that kind of relationship with him?” he asked.
Nat was right. Everything she said was true. It stung deeply but it needed to be spoken and acknowledged. Tears silently leaked down his cheeks.
“Pipes!” Tony quickly wiped the blood from her lip.
“I got all I needed from you. The great Captain America begging me to mount him like the weak primitive creature you were truly meant to be. You couldn’t even save your best friend,” said Tony. As soon as the words left his mouth he regretted. He'd gone too far.
“Oh, did that hurt,” said Nat.
“They were attacked,” he said.
“It’s not your fault.”
“Maria."
“You're overestimating the strength of my presence." She wasn't sure if she'd want to stop Steve. "This is a bad idea, Director. Why not strap him into your lie detector?”
“Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki or kills him the Tesseract lost,” said Tony.
The stench of distressed omega faded, and Tony forced himself to relax too, closing his eyes. Even though he was actively
“It would be used for the wrong thing,” she said.
Papa placed a pizza box in front of her and Rune. "Dig in you, two."
"Jarvis, keep an eye on her," said Tony.
"You do?"
“I can handle the extra attention,” said Tony.
"What were the two of you talking about?" asked Tony.
“What did you see?”
“Why is this happening?!” he growled through gritted teeth.
“She followed her assigned task. No behavior to report,” said Winter.
The stems cell of super-soldier the possibilities could be endless. To gather such a sample the pregnancy would have to be terminated.
"Steve?" The omega gave a needed high pitched whine. Tony slowly approached, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist.
“Are we almost there?”
*****
Steve hung another bag. "You could have sent someone to fetch me?"
“Oh, I’m sorry, did you not want to admit that out loud?” Rhodey teased. “That’s okay, because I’ll just let our basketball teams speak for us. We won, by the way.”
"I know."
“Well, you didn’t leave me with a phone number, so I couldn’t exactly call you,” she said dryly. “What I want is something that I hope you can give.” Tony raised an eyebrow, noticing how Mary’s foot started to rock the bassinet when she saw Peter starting to move around, trying to lull him back to sleep. “I would like for Peter to know his Father. I’m not asking you live with him, or come over every day, just, you know come see him, spend some time with him.”
She smirked a little when he responded with a text of peter trying to help with dinner. Seemed she wouldn't even have to worry about dinner either. Coulson was out of the state at the moment anyway, and she had been exhausted after work today, so not having to worry about cooking was a bigger relief than Tony would know. It looked to be an easy night.
"A favor?" Rhodey raised an eyebrow at him. "You're going to ask me for a favor?"
His first was one of his crazier ideas, and he wasn't going to tell anyone about it. Except maybe the one, big, blonde, alien that was standing in the way. He nodded to Thor who was standing in front of the door of the cell that held his crazy brother.
“Yeah, that wouldn’t be a bad idea.” Tony had turned to pull out some oranges. “Good ole’ Captain America will be done with his lesson anytime, and I really don’t want my kid seeing Loki’s face again. He’s gotten past his nightmares, and I’d rather they not start up again.”
"He was a three date mistake." Tony frowned as they watched the interview. He should warn Pepper, this was going to cause even more problems. Anyone that cared about Tony in anyway knew that he was bisexual, and Tony didn't care, but as far as the press knew, he was as straight as the American Hero standing next to him. There had always been rumors, but why wouldn't there be when the press loved reporting on his drinking and partying, and general debauchery. "Dammit."
"Ah, yes," Thor nodded. "Indeed, this is something that can be done. I am merely waiting for your Director's return with the tesseract, and then we will be able to depart."
"You're right, most of them are probably SHIELD agents anyway," Tony said with a little sigh. "They'll know exactly where to go, they probably already have a map from spy surveillance." Coulson hummed with amusement. "That hum says that I'm probably right." Tony's phone pinged and he pulled it out. "That's Pep, gotta go." He hopped up from the chair, then pointed at Coulson. "You've got twenty minutes, and I expect to see you out there with the boys." Tony pointed to Steve as he headed for the door. "You are in charge of getting the boys form Mary's room so Agent doesn't see her yet, and making sure that they're dressed. Don't fall asleep on me, Rogers!" Tony saluted before leaving the room, shutting the door.
Wade stared at him with a blank face for a moment. “Basically, you just said that you think I probably should talk to someone, but managed to step back before saying find some stranger.”
There was no elevator, how did people live in a building without an elevator? Luckily, Mary only lived on the third floor, so he took to the stairs, eyes pointed down at the stairs in case someone was coming down, and might have recognized him. As Tony saw that paint was slowly but surely chipping off of the walls and the trim, he wondered when the last time this building had been inspected, or even worked on. Maybe he was being too harsh, he lived in a custom built mansion and not an apartment in the city. When he saw a rat trap in the corner of the stairs landing, with a rat in it, he decided was in fact Not being too harsh.
“As well as the day after?” Jarvis questioned, with a hint a humor.
“Huh,” Tony puffed out, looking at the new DNA results for Jamie. “There seems to be a little bit of acceleration in growth,” he said to himself, but saw Bruce nodding out of the corner of his eye.
“Mean,” Steve mumbled huskily, eyes still closed. Jamie turned excitedly when she heard his voice and started to pat his face with both of her hands. His face scrunched up, but Tony could tell that he was trying not to laugh as well. “Tony, there’s something on my face. Do you mind getting that?”
"I wouldn't do-" Mary started, then winced, Steve backing up when Rowan spit-up on Tony's chest.
Tony walked up the steps, hand barely raised to knock and the door slowly opened to allow him inside. “Anthony Stark, you are one of my more surprising visitors.” Tony stepped inside, the door closing behind him, and saw Strange walked down the stairs from the second floor.
"Jarvis is keeping tabs on him, but he should be fine for a few minutes," Bruce said, tapping at something on the screen, most likely a treatment plan. "No longer than ten minutes though." He looked back up at Mary. "The only reason I'm stepping out of my comfort zone to treat him like this, is because I know he'll turn away any other medical doctor. He doesn't realize it now, but this is serious. And that's not even mentioning what's going on in his head right now." He gave Mary a purposeful look. "This is all stuff you should be telling that man," he said pointing in the pool room. She knew that he was referring to Steve. Bruce squeezed her shoulder a little before heading off down the hall.
Tony glanced over, seeing Maria Hill walk towards him as Loki's conversation continued. She nodded to him a little, hand gently touching his elbow, before walking onto the main deck.
And because I realize I forgot to post it last chapter, and some people have asked, the song from last chapter was "I Wont' Give Up" by Jason Mraz. I had an awesome roommate who adored Jason Mraz, so I guess I just everyone assumed knew what the song was. Heheh, my bad. :D
Steve woke up first, or at least he thought he was first. A glance at the other end of the couch saw that Peter and Tony were talking quietly with each other. Tony was on his back, propped with a pillow behind his head, and Peter half laying, half sitting on Tony's chest, fingers tracing the arc reactor through Tony's shirt. Steve closed his eyes again, not wanting to interrupt their moment. He almost felt bad when his Super Soldier hearing picked up their conversation.
“Never gonna happen,” Steve replied, and a smirk crossed Tony’s face briefly.
“Always asking the big questions,” Tony said approvingly. “Well, the Princes from Snow White and Cinderella are just right out, they like, don’t talk at all.” Peter nodded as Tony talked. “He’s kind of like Prince Eric, but the hair is just all wrong, plus I don’t think he would have fallen for Ursula’s scheme.”
"I may have made things worse," Steve said after a moment. "He's probably still going to tell the press. I'm sorry Tony."
"You won't do that," Steve told him. "You're not going to anything, because what you're doing is illegal on so many levels, and just wrong."
Steve pulled out the chair to the desk, sat down and reached for the first file on top, and opened it. 'Howard Stark'. There were a few pictures under a paperclip, and he pulled them out. On top there was a picture of the Howard Stark that he had met, young, cocky, and so confident about everything he did. Underneath was a picture of him with Peggy, the founding of SHIELD. And under that was a picture of him with another woman; flipping the picture over someone had printed 'Howard & Maria '68.'
"Yes, Sir." The three in the room all took a little glance around the house.
He took a breath, felt the next hit on the shield and moved forward. Steve lifted the shield up, expecting to hit the scepter out of Stark's hands, but instead felt resistance. Lifting his head he saw that Stark was holding it with both hands, pushing against the shield, stopping Steve, which really should not have been possible.
"Wade told us about your cancer last night." Tony winced a little. He really had no tact sometimes. "Sorry, I didn't-"
"I'm thinking," Tony drawled as he stretched his arms, trying to shake off the last of his nightmare, "I'll go take a shower first, while you keep feeding her. Then I'll come out and take over so you can get cleaned up."
“I’ll allow it,” Coulson said with a nod. Sam and Rhodey walked over to the other side to grab some water, and Steve and Bucky went over towards Tony. He tossed them both some towels to wipe their sweat.
aren’t good, even if one of them is cliché.”
The man started to wind the whips around, he was aiming up for a good strike. Tony moved as he saw the mans up start to go up. He jumped to his feet, and as the whip came down on the car, Tony was tucking and rolling across the ground, his body groaning in protest. He came up to his feet, the car exploding, fire and heat blasting onto his back, and moved back up to his feet.
Tony charged up the repulsors and launched a shot in the middle of the group, trying to scatter them. It seems that the black clothing was not just fashion trend, but some kind of armor. "Really, black is not that great anymore, people, start picking different colors." He dodged another bullet and fired another shot into the group. This one came close to hitting one of them, and they hopped back. When he saw Natasha jump on one of them and bring them down with her dangerous thighs, and Cap right behind her, he safely turned his attention back to the device.
"You are impossible," Bruce muttered as he slipped into the sports car.
Tony wasn't sure what to expect when he walked into the hospital room, but it was better than any of the scenarios his mind had been making up. Rachel was sitting up in the bed, her and Mary looking to be playing a card game on the tray over her lap, with Mary herself sitting on the end of the bed with her mother’s feet in her lap. There was another chair next to the bed that he assumed William had been sitting in.
"Well, it's not if someone went way overboard sending too many Christmas presents," she countered. "Long or short sleeve?"
Wade came out first, and the woman raised a hand to him and walked over to the kid. Bucky’s eyes narrowed a bit and he pushed himself away from the car. The woman and Wade were talking, and Wade pointed over towards Bucky She put a hand on his shoulder, giving it a squeeze before she turned to head in Bucky’s direction. He saw the little frown on Wade’s face before he was heading back to the school doors, most likely to get Peter.
"That seemed to be his intention."
Tony's brow furrowed a little. "I don't need a bodygua-"
"How can you be sure that that's him?" Steve asked, leaning in to study the pictures.
Steve narrowed his eyes in confusion at that one.
"You're so kind, Stark," Barton quipped, smoothing down his own jacket. "To willingly give away the attention like that."
"Wait for him to come to us," Steve said, and his tone couldn't have sounded more defeated. "Or wait for Meg to make him do it?" Tony set down his mug and walked over to Steve, rubbing his arm a little. "Feels like everything is changing."
"I've already tried to tell him that it's a bad plan," Steve said. "I said that he should just call up the Zoo, and try to get a private day for his birthday."
Tony blinked when he saw that Steve's playlist was active, and new songs were starting to show up. "Jarvis? Steve's still in Michigan, right?"
"You hate me, don't you? This whole thing just now, it was all an act," Tony complained, wiggling away and off the bed. "Build me up only to taunt me!" He wandered to Steve's attached bathroom.
Also, I did not expect for some many people to like this story, I'm so flattered, and honored! I hope I can keep up the expectations.
Steve moved closer to Tony's back, hand hovering for just a second, before gently resting on Tony's back. He moved his head closer to Tony's ear as his hand moved in circles. "Tony, can you hear me?" The smaller man was still coughing, almost violently, his body desperate to get air back. "Tony, it's Steve, I'm right here. You're in New York," Steve started up the mantra to try and ground Tony. "You're in the mansion, it's just after Peter's party. Peter is in his bedroom with Wade, they're both safe. You're safe." Tony was wheezing now, but he was pulling in some air now, the coughing not nearly as bad. "You're safe, Tony."
Unbeta'd as usual, and Marvel owns more of this than I do. Also, all music/movies/tv shows belongs to those that wrote/performed/produced/etc them. I use them for humor and good times.
"I don't like to be handed things because when I would try to show my Dad stuff he would slap it from my hands," Tony confessed, speaking quickly, and if Steve hadn't of been looking at Tony he might have missed it. "When hands come towards me I think that I've done something wrong, and that I'm going to be punished for it, because for as much as I'm adult I can't help but to revert to a child being demeaned by their father."
The infamous Pepper Potts had one of the best memories in the business. "You came with the baby, claiming that Tony was the father." Mary just nodded once, and Pepper narrowed her eyes a little. "Was it all some sort of set-up to try and get Tony under government surveillance?"
"I think I can handle a few more seconds," Steve said. "Thanks," he said, and Tony almost missed it over the sound of the fireworks. He just gave Steve's hand a little squeeze in response. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad at the Tower if Steve was going to stick around.
“Yes, your ‘mysterious lover’ is certainly gaining a lot of attention.” Now Pepper sounded amused.
"So why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?" Steve frowned a little when Bruce looked at him. "I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?"
Tony felt a pull in his chest, but this wasn't from a lack of air. The burning was behind his eyes now. Tony turned his face into Steve's chest as warm tears slid down his cheeks. He wasn't supposed to still be haunted by this, wasn't supposed to be this weak, this broken. A hand fisted in the towel around Steve, and small sob ripped through his sore throat. Tony's mask was starting to shatter, and he didn't like it.
“Watch out, or I’ll take your presents back and get you a harness and a leash,” Tony threatened before turning around to face his son. He walked over and pulled Peter up into his arms. “I’ll make sure that it’s bright neon green.” Peter’s face twisted in disgust. “Yeah, that’s right. I’m your Dad, and I have all the power. Don’t you forget that.” He turned and left the bedroom, with Peter in his arms, and they headed for the living room.
"I could have used your middle name, that's when you really know that you're in trouble."
"Except we were all gone," Steve said, a little frown marring his brows. "And he would have known that, the news would have been reporting it."
“Don’t think this means you get to get out of laundry duty,” Tony warned Steve. The blonde winked at him as Bucky got up from the floor. “Ooo, you are playing this game, aren’t you?”
The jet landed and Tony slowly leaned up, trying not to groan when his back and hips protested. "I'm going to redesign these chairs," he grumbled, stretching a little. "I shouldn't be more sore when I'm getting up, no new places of hurt." A much more rested Bruce approached him and he shook his head a little. "I'm alright." He grabbed the little bag he had made from a piece of fabric from the baby and handed it to his friend. "Present for you, though." Bruce looked with a question in his eyes, but Tony just waved a hand before looping his arm with Steve's, following him off the jet.
... He knew that logo. He knew that weapon. He had built that weapon.
There was a knock on the door and Mary walked in after a second. Both Peter and Steve looked up, smiling at her. "Hi Mama."
“Things sure have changed from my time,” he murmured, then followed behind Tony.
"I was pretty well removed," Banner started.
Pepper looked down at her phone, typing out something before looking back up at him. "Well, I didn't actually think I'd see it, a sober birthday." She gave him a little smile and now Tony was raising his eyebrow. "Although, your sudden aversion to peanuts? Was it actually because of a peanut allergy?"
"Captain," Natasha said through the com in his ear. "That portal is active, we've got incoming." Steve pressed his lips together, holding Peter more tightly.
"And of course they should," Tony said automatically. "He's their grandson, and that is the right of all grandparents." Tony glanced over at the shell of the new armor he was still working on, then back to the current plans in front of him. "And for the record, I haven't bought him anymore presents."
“They’re breaking down your defenses, aren’t they?” Bucky narrowed his eyes a little, then felt Meg slip something into his pocket. “Those make for great bribes for the boys.”
Party time! And Tony is not okay.
"I had a meeting with Mr Stark a couple years ago," Mary said plainly.
“Captain,” Jarvis spoke up in his ear. “I have a possible location for you.”
"You're tired," Tony said softly to Peter, who tried to shake his head no. "Yeah you are, you're a little ball of sleepiness."
"I'm not the man you're looking for," he told Steve, taking a small step backwards. "I'm not that man you remember."
Mary didn't say anything for a moment. "I'm looking into it, Tony," she said gently. "But, I need you to let me do this without your intervention." Tony was about to shout at her, but she kept going. "So, I'm going to drop Peter off to you, today." Tony stopped, blinking.
"It is not my fault that you have a great many things that you wish not to share with others," Loki lazily threw back at him. "Sit down before you fall and break something." Tony offered a half-hearted glared and Steve gently pulled him over to one of the cars, opening the door for him to sit down in. Tony leaned back, spreading out in the backseat of the car.
“Years of training,” Tony explained. “I’m pretty good at picking out melodies, then working from there. I know a lot of the classics, the real classics, but I can also play a lot of modern songs.” Tony lifted his eyes up to look at Steve as he transitioned into another song. Steve raised an eyebrow at him, then smirked a little. “I had a little bit of incentive to learn this song.”
It was hard not to notice Tony as he turned, and Steve's eyes were drawn to his body as he turned, something curling in his gut when he watched Tony's ass, the fabric of his pants drawn tight against the skin. A faint heat crept up his neck and he felt like he should take a dunk in the pool. Except that the water wouldn't be nearly cold enough.
“Voice of reason, so not welcome sometimes,” Tony said and pointed at Bruce. The doctor just shrugged with a smile.
Tony's bones felt tired, and he knew that Jarvis had been right to lock him out, but he didn't want to sleep. He shivered a little, letting out a breath into the comforter on the bed. It was comfortable, and he couldn't deny that just lying there was really helping his weary body.
Tony watched Steve walk over to the pool, his body staying by the door. The pool room really was a comfortable room, he had loved it as a child, and had had it updated a year before his parents death. When he knew that he was moving back here, he had it updated again, putting Jarvis in control of most of the room and its functions. He hadn't actually gone swimming since Afghanistan.
Tony glanced at her, on his stomach, face pressed into a pillow. "Funnily enough, I'm always in this position when I'm in bed with you. Last time, when we made a baby, I remember landing like this, next to you, but there was at least a smile on both of our faces." He snorted softly, then brought his arms up to pillow his head on. "I'm going to assume that No one else has measured up to me in bed, because my ego demands it." Tony turned his head the other way, glancing at tablet on the bedside stand, but not moving to grab it. "I know why you didn't want to sleep with me again, because you got together with Agent, and I totally understand. The one time we slept together we had Peter. And while I could have a hundred Peter's, none of them would be as awesome as our little boy, and man would your body hate me. It's obvious that my body is just that awesome, pregnant in one."
So, the response from the last chapter blew me away! Thank you everyone! So this story will officially become a series. I have an idea of where I want this one to end, where it'll feel natural, and then I'll probably launch right into the next story. Most of them will be multi-chapter fics, and I'll throw in some one-shots here and there. Most will probably be scenes that occur during time-jumps, or stuff that just doesn't fit into a chapter. I can't wait guys! So, here is a special, fun, chapter for you all!
"Tony, don't be jealous-" Tony snorted at his words.
"Yeah. There's a reservoir of emotions inside of me, somewhere." Tony waved a hand around his body. "And it's been tapped too many times over the past week. Really, it's a slow filling thing, and I don't think it's very big, honestly."
"Steve," Tony all but pleaded quietly.
"I don't know," Tony answered honestly. He had no idea who that man even was. He was no one that any of them had run into, at least yet. Maybe it was time to take a look in SHIELD's files. Peter scrunched up his nose and buried his face into Tony's shoulder. Tony couldn't help but feel guilty, being unable to stop Peter from being a part of the danger that he was constantly getting in to.
“Dadddddy!” He giggled tucking his arms against his body to try and block Tony’s hands. “Mommy! Help!”
“I always have valid points.” Tony opened the door to the waiting car, and Steve barely resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “To the jet!”
"You've got Jarvis already set-up at the Tower?" Bruce asked as they headed back for the mansion.
"Like a cat to milk." Tony turned to face her. "But you're not here to talk about Steve." She shook her head and they headed back down the hall. "I can tell you that you're not going to get much out of me, not if you want to ask me what happened."
“Yeah, so don’t make me lose my appetite,” Bucky warned them. “I think Meg tried to do that last night with that show-“
"I'm on it," Tony said. He looked at Steve. "Meet me at Engine Three." Steve nodded and ran off, and Tony went for the suit.
He sat in the ruined club house, most of his armor having been stripped off on the floor. Pepper was on her way back, but it probably take her at least a day to make it to where he was. Tony looked down at the two Pokeballs in his hands, one painted orange, the other painted blue. Two Pokeballs that refused to open after a 70 year ice sleep. SHIELD had been unable to get them open, but they could at least reveal that the Arcanine, and the Braviary inside were as healthy as the living legend they belonged too. Tony knew what he had to do, and it was breaking his heart.
"Yeah, it is, huh?" Tony let his fingers run through Peter's soft hair. The motion seemed to calm Tony, as he found himself doing it more and more when he was with the boy. "Is it too big for you?" Peter shook his head a little. "That's good."
"And I don't think my job would appreciate the attention we would get." Tony nodded at Mary. He knew that she worked for the government, for the FBI, and they probably didn't want that spotlight.
"Well, since Pepper is gone, I have to be." The Airman smiled and headed upstairs to his own room, Tony following behind not long after.
"We have a lot of information about the 1940's," Coulson said, referring to history and technology. "We can recreate practically anything with the tech that we have now."
“Tony,” the older man corrected. “I prefer Tony.” Steve nodded a little. “Good news, I was able to fix the balls. I recommend replacing them soon though.” Tony walked over to him, holding out his hand to give Steve a supply of Luxury balls. Steve put them in a pouch on his belt, and Tony held out the other two pokeballs.
“No!” Tony shot up in the bed, trying to suck in a breath. The air was too hot, the room too warm. He felt wet, and his chest hurt. His hand shot up to check for the arc reactor, to make sure it was still there. A hand was trying to take one of his and he shouted, pushing himself back, and then he was falling, landing heavily on the floor. Tony brought up his arms to cover his chest.
“And a kitchen that isn’t the same size as the whole apartment that Bucky and I shared before the war,” Steve nodded. “Where the living room and dining room combined would be the same size of the living room upstairs.” Tony mock gasped, eyes going big. “I know! Shocking, that that’s how other people live!” He chuckled softly.
"Oh, but let you me tell you, the day I'll remember most, was when your Mama brought you to me, came and said, 'Hey, we have a son together.' I'll admit, at first I was ready to throw some money at her, but then she pulled this tricky spy move, and suddenly there's a baby Peter in my arms, and your hand was on mine, and that little adult voice inside of me woke up and pointed out that I would be a fool to not be around. The first two years I didn't change too much, at least I don't think so, but your Aunt and Uncles might say different. But then, some bad guys got me, taking advantage of my naivety, and I got this," Tony tapped the arc reactor in his chest. "For some reason, you like this, and you're the only one who can touch it. Anyone else gets near it, I freeze up, get panicky, want to lash out, but not you. I feel calm when your little hand rests over it." Tony let out a breath, leaning back in the chair.
Steve watched a blush work up Tony’s neck, coloring his cheeks a little. He pulled Tony down closer to him, planting a soft kiss to his lips. “I’m as sweet on him as the cake we got.” Tony shoved Steve’s shoulder a little, hiding his face in Steve’s neck now. Jamie giggled, patting Tony’s head with her hands, and Steve nuzzled her cheek with his nose.
An hour later Steve was waiting outside in the driveway again, sans shovel, and looked up as he heard the jets of Iron Man boots approaching the small house. Meg hadn't been kidding when she said it was small, it was almost the size of the Queens apartment, which just wasn't going to work.
Steve had never been so glad for Coulson's redesign to the suit. Loki hit hard, especially with that spear, but the suit was able to take and absorb some of the blows. It didn't take him long at all to jump back to his feet to react to the attacks. He didn't hold back anything. But neither did Loki. The music had been unexpected though.
"I have to give this to Peter," Tony said holding up the backpack. "Delay her for a couple of minutes. I told Peter I'd be right back, and I have to let him know that I'll be a little longer. Dull transparency with the kid for a bit." Steve could understand that.
"Ah, yeah," Tony said with a little nod. The hesitation in Peter's voice was what he was afraid to start hearing. He hadn't expected the boy to be jumping in excitement, but this could go downhill pretty fast. "She's Mr Steve's, so she'll be with him, and I'll be there too, to help, raise her. Like I do with your Momma." Steve nudged Tony's side a little, but Tony already knew that his words were floundering. He could talk circles around people at meetings and press conferences, but when it really matter, Tony had a lead tongue that didn't know what the hell to say.
"Copy that, Captain," she said as she took the tablet back from him.
“Stop making sense,” Tony whined softly, then opened his eyes to look at him. “Help me move over, I want you laying down next to me. I’m hurt, I’m allowed to make demands.”
Tony leaned his forehead against Steve's, eyes closed, both of them panting a little. "Sir, Young Master Peter seems to be having a nightmare." Tony's eyes flew open at Jarvis's voice.
"Uh huh," he nodded, rubbing his eyes, and putting his head on Tony's chest. "This bed it big."
"You're on that list?" Tony poked at Steve. "Are you above or below angry bees?"
"Hi, Pepper." He always felt a little weird about calling her Pepper, because he hadn't had nearly as much interaction with her, but she had insisted. "Tony's with Peter."
"We watched the news." Tony opened his eyes at the words. "Get some rest."
"I think if that were really true, you would have done it already," Steve said, with a raised eyebrow. "I mean, if something were going to drive a man to drink, it would be what you went through, and the resulting nightmares." Tony grumbled, but didn't say anything. "And if you really couldn't play well with others, we wouldn't have worked as a team so well out there. But you're also Peter-obsessed, and that's not a bad thing."
"You can't be serious about this." Tony stared at Meg across from him.
"There are four active users, not including Young Master Peter." Bruce looked at Tony.
"He said that his Mama is sick, but his Daddy is in the military, like Uncle James." Peter continued. "But his Daddy isn't a fly boy like Uncle James." Tony nodded. What could a second grader do for another one?
"Tony-"
Rhodey put a hand on Tony's shoulder, and he looked over to the taller man. "No one else will get in the suit, Tony. I promise you." Tony nodded, letting out a breath.
“Sir,” Jarvis interrupted softly, but Tony didn’t stop in his motions. “Captain Rogers requests a moment of your time.” Tony let out a soft sigh before nodding. He dropped a kiss on Ruby’s head before putting down the brush and pushing himself up.
Tony wished that he would hear Mary when he walked in, yelling at him for being an idiot, telling him that he had overreacted by calling in so many doctors. But she didn't, she was asleep on the bed, the oxygen running, the heart monitor steadily beeping.
Steve preferred drawing the armor like this, animated and bright, translating on paper more vibrantly than a still model. What he really wished he could do however was sketch Iron Man in action, doing what it does best: saving the world. Oh, but Steve had already gotten in enough trouble over his wandering eyes in the field.
“This was something I asked for, Tony.” Steve narrowed his eyes disapprovingly at him. He had wanted to do something special for Tony’s birthday, but not for himself.
Tony used his freed hand to press the button that lifted his faceplate, and looked at the debauched Captain incredulously, “What the hell is wrong with you?” He then raised his gauntlet until it met Steve’s chest with a glare, repulsor flaring dangerously and bright. “Get off Cap. I mean it.”
Absolutely not, he did not need an audience for this one. Steve swiftly put up a hand in placation, “Just a spar guys, nothing too interesting.”
It had been bad enough when all he had to go off of was sight, but now he had touch. He had felt against his skin the texture and beauty of Iron Man, and he didn’t know how he was supposed to not think about that when he gets his hands on that stunning armor again tomorrow. All Tony had done today was aggravate his obsession and now what he wanted was more.
Steve sucked in a breath and straightened his spine, gathering up the moxie to step into the ring. Maybe if he just kept a naked pinup of Furry in mind, he could get through this without embarrassing himself. All heat instantly left the Captains body as the image materialized in his head. He shivered and his semi wilted; yep, that could do the trick.
The genius graced him with one of his roguish, mischievous smirks, a glint clear in his eye. “We,” he began breathlessly, “are definitely exploring this.”
It was true; two hours ago, Tony had spread him out face down on the work bench, body draped over him and lips whispering, “Stay right there, soldier.” Before leaving to let his suit drive him through the kingdoms of heaven and the circles of hell.
“Tony, stop…” Steve gasped. He didn’t know if he should move and let Tony see his hard on or try to calm down while he sat on Iron Man –
Steve groaned low in his chest, he could feel himself tipping over the edge, so ready but needing just one more push.
As soon as those words escaped his mouth, Tony leapt into action, going after Steve for all he was worth. Granted, the fight was still a bit lopsided in the Captains favor, but the new suit did give Steve a run for his money. All throughout, the blonde was -
A tight moan broke past Steve’s lips when the gauntlet squeezed him harder. The Captain’s blood pumped through his veins, and a tight knot began to curl itself in his stomach. The hand was so hot and heavy and demanding as it massaged him trough his sweat pants, even pushing him more firmly into the wall by his pelvis. A cry escaped the blonde at the pressure and instantly, Iron Man had his pants tugged down to his thighs and is heavy, pulsing cock fisted in his hand. The gauntlet tightened, squeezing him on the way up, making a whirring sound as it did so, grip just a little too tight. Steve groaned and panted, eyes trained on the hand moving mechanically up and down his shaft like a piston; precum bubbled up and rolled down his cock in rivulets.
“Fuuuuuck…” Steve groaned long and low, eyes still clenched tight.
“Me? Your ridiculous,” Tony countered, “Still can’t do dirty talk after being bent over by a robot for two hours.”
After that unfortunate incident, the blonde had gone to great lengths to dial down his fixation. No more watching, no more seeking, and now more
The Captain had never felt so many conflicting feelings in his life. The smooth metal of one hand trailing gently down his sides, while the warmed metal of the other fucked into him. Sometimes achingly slow, and other times brutally, inhumanly fast, putting Steve’s super soldier body to the test to see just how much his prostate could take. He had keened and risen off the table like a bow drawn tight, part of him fighting to get away while the other half pleaded for more. So many times, Steve had been
The elevator came to a gradual stop and both Tony and Steve filed out and split off to opposite sides of the ring, both getting themselves together. Steve changed into some loose shorts and a white t-shirt, quickly pulling the cotton shirt over his head before gazing at the inventor across the way. He watched with bated breath as Tony clenched his fists and gauntlets folded out like water on sand, creeping up his arms and wrapping securely around each one of his fingers. As the titanium alloy crawled its way up the tan forearms, it didn’t stop, continuing its assent and wrapping around his shoulders before encasing his sternum, stomach and thighs. The Captain couldn’t help but lick his parted lips as he watched the suit systematically encase every part of Tony’s body, eventually down to his feet.
