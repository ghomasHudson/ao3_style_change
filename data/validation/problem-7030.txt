"Anything can be altered, Captain, but this is not the case here. Only Miss Stark has the authority to alter my records, and she did not do so."
Feeling somewhat better, Steve nodded before making his way to Piece's office, who was softly smiling at him from his office door. Steve had only seen this man from a distance, never talked to him. Steve quite referred it like that, as he didn't like the politics. Toni could smile and make small talk with anyone, but he plowed through it. "Sir, it's an honor."
"I try," he said. The whole in the floor had been repaired, making it look as nothing had happened and that stung a little as something had happened. They were missing a team member, and it wouldn't be the same until she returned.
"So you know about that, do you?" he said, letting out of Toni's face. He stepped back from her and crossed to the tool that Loki was playing with earlier.
Hill's eyes danced to Fury. "There're quite a few possible suspects. We're narrowing down the list. It shouldn't take too long, considering only certain groups would have the technology to do so."
Like any guy would, he bent over in pain, but he still had a hand on her. "You Bitch," he yelped as he looked away. She saw this as an opening and head-butted him. They both cursed in pain, but he let her go.
"No, it's perfect, Stark," he replied. "No one knows what we need more than we do." He placed a kiss to her wet head, keeping her in his arms. He could feel her try to wiggle out his arms, but he refused to let up. He knew letting her go would be the worst thing that he could do, because that was when she did her worst thinking. It was what drew her out, alone in Central Park during the middle of the night. "And I know you need this."
Toni kicked the blankets off her and swung her feet off the bed. "Wait, why am I in a bed?" She remembered leaving the apartment, while Barnes and Rogers argued over her. Usually, she didn't mind when men fought over her, but she didn't like that
"Are you sure?" she asked. It really didn't matter to her as it gave her time to scope out Stark Industries. If she wanted to get her device back, she would need to know everything about the company, a company that she would ran and sign over in the future.
Natasha smiled as she brought her glass to her lips. She said nothing as she took a long slip. Clint gave her a look before eyeing the Captain. "You have to tell us now!" he replied, loudly and annoyed.
Toni raised an eye brow as she looked at him. "Lies! Who would want or need a Hawkeye?" she teased, not knowing if he was telling the truth. Did he have anyone? She really didn't know if the man had a family…granted, if she thought about it, what did she know? The same could be said of the red head assassin, but her being a Russian Assassin told the genius everything that she needed to know.
Tony's hands ball at his sides, forcing his nails into his skin. He doesn't need the image of Rogers and Barnes rolling around in their bed, fighting for control, and he certainly doesn't need to imagine how it would feel if they use that strength on him, pinning him to the bed. And he really doesn't need to know how it would feel to have their bodies against his.
That did not to curb Barton's anger. "What do you call that?" He hissed, glaring at the broken lamp.
Steve looked completely heartbroken with shame written all over him. He looked small—something that Toni didn't think possible of the famous Captain Rogers. His shoulders were hunched, looking like he was curled into himself. "I-it wasn't l-like that. I would never hurt Toni." He uttered, struggling to get the words out.
However, he didn't have time to think about his pain as there was a Strike team hot on his tail, and they looked ready to kill. If they caught him, it would all be over. Whoever this was would win, and the world would be in danger. Everyone and thing that he ever cared for would be in danger. Innocent people could be hurt, and with Toni missing, his mind couldn't help but drift to her. Could these people be after her? Somehow, she wasn't hit by those bullets that killed Fury, and the way that Assassin hovered over her, he wanted her. But why? Besides her being Iron Man.
As Toni closed her eyes to think, she heard footsteps, swishing in the mud. She knew who it was before she opened her eyes and fought to ignore the growing warmth in her heart knowing it was him. "Howard," she uttered as she opened her eyes.
Steve turned back and stared into her eyes. "She did that?" he asked through his teeth. He was going to have a few choices words with the assassin. Yes, he liked that Toni was getting hand to hand training, but he didn't want her injured, and judging from the bruise, it was a bad hit. "I'm going to talk to her."
With a pang of pain, a memory flashed before her eyes of Barnes kissing her, telling her that he wanted her. His tone then had been close to Steve's tone now, but there was something desperate in Steve's voice. "What are you saying?"
Steve's grip on the Brunette tightened, but the genius didn't stir. "Sleeping." His voice was strained as he glanced back to Natasha and Clint, who were eyeing the sleeping woman in his arms. They were clearly concerned about her, even if they had good poker faces. "I need to get her to bed."
Entering the oversized kitchen, Toni smiled as she spotted the brewing coffee. She had no idea what she would do without the juice of life, though she knew it wouldn't turn out well. She would probably turn into a zombie, not that she wasn't already one. She was totally a zombie at the moment, and this coffee was the only thing keeping her from going full on zombie and eating some brains. She would love the see the headlines if she were to ever to do that.
Toni, after wrapping her hand, returned to her work. The wrench hurt as she held it in her burnt hand, but she wanted to work on the device, which could fit in her small hands, in front of her. The device, when operational, should be able to shut down all electronics within a 10 foot range. If it worked, she would increase the range to 25 feet or more, but she couldn't get it to work right. It fried electronics and reverse, which she couldn't understand how, the time on her clock by 15 minutes each time it fuzzed. That wasn't what she wanted.
Schmidt crossed to the door. "I do not have the time to waste. Zola, Sark, and I have things to do."
Like a magician, Nick hid his pain well, as he settled in his chair. He melted into it as he tried to make himself as small as he could. "You really think I'd need one?" He gave them both a stern look, his eyes lingering on Toni for a few long seconds. If eyes could kill. "My wife kicked me out."
She took a deep breath, knowing she should let this go. If she pushed, she might change history or make him mad. Maybe, Rogers wasn't supposed to know to a certain time. "Okay," she agreed. "But…" She shook her head. She needed to let this go. "Fine."
"You a gentlemen?" Acting quickly, she slapped his arm away, and before he could react, she did a rounding kick, hitting him hard in his chest. "Didn't your mother tell you to keep your hands to yourself? And whoever told you that boys will be boys was lying to you."
On the ground a few feet away from her, the two officers, who had been guarding the entrance, were lying on the ground. She wasn't sure if they were dead but she didn't want to find out, not when the person who did this was still out there. Knowing from the many horror movies she had watched, it was never a good idea to run into the darkness as that was normally where the murderer killed you.
"Yea, just wanted to make sure you were okay. You were in such a bad shape," he stated as the opened the door for her. She followed him in knowing he wasn't going to hurt her. "It's good to see you're okay, well for the most part."
He remembered watching her leave and the intense urge to go after her. He would have if it wasn't for Peggy, who held him back with a single look. Though he didn't like it, he knew it was the right thing to do, because talking to an angry Toni was a very bad idea. Instead, he had to watch his best friend go after the woman of his dreams as he fought down his jealousy.
Rotating in the chair, Toni turned her attention back to the device, which she still hadn't named yet. She wanted to wait until she got it working before she named it. "I'll take it down here."
thoughts out of her mind. She had other things to worry about like the fact that she still hadn't figure out what Loki had been up to and he wasn't talking. Thor had tried to get Loki to speak, demanding to know what his plan was, but the prankster wouldn't speak, leaving the team in the dark. Toni joked that he wanted her first born child—not that she planned in having kids any time soon. Her father's final wishes be damned… okay, not really—but that creeped her the hell out. He could not have any of her nonexistent offspring.
If Toni could slap the AI, she would have. Did she go to far? Did she create a monster? God, she created a monster. Maybe, it was a good thing that she didn't create him a body. "Ha ha," she mocked. "I have made amazing decisions."
"I don't know, and that may be the problem." Bruce shook his head. There was no real way for them to know what time she was transported back to, and he knew that would be a major issue. How could they save her if they had no idea of where to save her from?
"If you wake Stark, I will beat you," the master assassin replied. "And I'll take one of your own arrows and shove it where the sun doesn't shine."
When they arrived at the lab, Banner with eyes on the lab's door was sitting in a chair waiting for them and Rogers with a hard expression was still sitting on the edge of the hole. "About time," Banner stated as the assassins entered the room. "I was starting to worry about you guys."
His eye brow rose. "You call Schmidt capturing and torturing you taking care of yourself?" he asked. He took another step toward her, blocking her view of the bar.
Bruce let out a small chuckle. "I am not sure you want to be a part of that boy band, Toni. I know I don't." Toni chortled.
Steve's face lit up as he looked at her. "Toni," he greeted, putting down the pan. He didn't spare it another glance, as he crossed to his girlfriend, who was the most attractive woman he had ever seen. With the speed and agility of a super soldier, he pinned her to the wall and placed a dominating kiss to her lips. It was hungry and demanding.
She groaned loudly as it felt like she was on fire. It felt like someone set her ablaze, and she was sweating. It felt like she was burning alive, though all she could see was ice and jaggy rocks. "N-No," she cried, feeling like she was about to die.
His apartment building was no exception. The only one person in the hall besides him was his blond neighbor, Sharon. His blond neighbor that Clint teased him about endlessly as if there was something there. He wasn't sure why Clint kept pushing it, kept bring her up, but it was getting old fast. Granted, he would be feel like this because of the day he had. "Hello," he greeted, as he passed her in the hall, attempting to give her a smile.
Again, his innocent and sweetness was shocking to her. "No, they didn't," Toni answered as he wrapped his coat around her shoulders. She didn't know if it was just her or if the coat, but she was really warm now. "You're going to be cold now."
Steve's eyes narrowed. "Just-" The Captain started, but he wasn't able to finish. "This is an interesting explosion," Bruce said, interrupting him. "I can't tell if it imploded or exploded. It's like-"
Toni was infuriated because she kept breaking her goddamn rules. She did not chase after people to talk about their feelings. That was too much drama for her, so why in the hell was she chasing after him? She had already talked it out with Rogers, so why did she have to do it again? She thought that they dealt with this, or maybe it was something else… Did something happen to Barnes? Was that why he was being distance?
Pepper dropped a different item of clothing into the suitcase, before she stomped to Toni. "I'm done with this, Toni. Do you hear me? I'm done. I can't stand by and watch you kill yourself. My body cannot handle stress. Let the others continue this battle."
Urgh, why did I ask that? Since she was so smart, she should've guessed that he was going go ask that. Now, how was she going to response to that? There was really nothing she could say without looking crazy. "I don't know," she stated, saying the first thing off her mind.
Toni stopped and turned back to Barnes, who was a few feet behind her. "Where's the fun in that?" she asked, smiling.
I am sorry this took me soo long to get this out. I wanted to get this out sooner, much soon, but it took me awhile to write this. I hope the next one doesn't take me too long.
"Why would I leave such a pretty dame alone?" he asked as he put an arm around her. "We could go out. Why would you want to be around a guy like that?"
She wanted to yell at herself for even allowing herself to think like that. She wasn't sure why she was still feeling like this, considering the weight lifted off her chest when she told Steve. She could breathe again, but here she was, still feeling like crap.
"Stupid," he mutters to himself as he stares down at one of his experiments. He tries to ignore the chaos around him and in his head, as he focuses his work, which at times can calm him. He tries to ignore Dum-E at the lab door, still holding a fire extinguisher. He tries to ignore U, making a large mess in the small kitchen. He keeps his eyes on the countless blueprints in front of him. He has lost count of how many open experiments he currently has, as he keeps pouring out new tech. After he had locked himself in his lab and his mind, the genius has barely slept, and without sleep, the only way he can keep himself sane is to work, which is great for his company… bad for him. Plus, a tired, grumpy, moody Tony Stark isn't good for anyone.
"And what if she isn't…What if she isn't?" Steve started, forcing himself to take a few deep breaths. "What if we're too late. What if they…"
"And you aren't wearing any shoes. I hadn't thought about that," he said with a sigh as he stepped back from her and glanced down.
After a few long minutes and before she could pull away, there was a knock at the driver window. As soon as the window was down, Harley said, quickly, "You're welcome!"
"She needs to learn her lesson," the commander hissed, stepped closer to Toni. "She won't be able to rebel if I break a bone, right?" She asked, glaring down at Toni.
At first, Steve didn't know what to make of what Natasha was saying. Besides Clint, no one fully knew her story, as she refused to even hint at her past. He knew the basic story, a former Russian Assassin turned SHIELD agent, but that was it. He didn't know her story, struggle, her pain, or if he could trust her. He had no idea what her motivations or her driving force, and it drove him nuts. How could you trust someone if you have no idea of who she or he was? "What are you hinting at?" he asked.
"I don't need you. I want you. With those Americans, that mind of yours is going to waste," he stated. He turned to Zola who was working on something.
Blood dripped down her arm as she pulled the IV. The skin on her chest stung as she yanked the heart monitors off. The machine peeped a few times, but she was able to yank the plug out before it went off. "I need to go."
Blowing out in a big huff, Steve crossed to the only window in his room, which's view was of a brick wall. "She was, but she's injured and has memory lost. I don't want her in a homeless shelter or anything like that. Those places would eat her alive"
Toni felt her heart race. How did her father know that she was going to try to do something? How the hell did he know? Why did he keep besting her every freaking time? Why did she always lose? Even when she won, she always seem to lose. She was meant to be alone in her pain, wasn't she? "Selfish Asshole," she said, hiding her pain with her anger. Why didn't he let her save him? Did he hate her or something? What was it? "Did he not think I could do it on my own? That I couldn't do the impossible? I wish he was here so I can punch him. He denied me of my greatness. The asshole." Her tears were close to the surface, but she refused to let them out.
"I would, so I can beat the person who taught you. At this rate, you'll be taken all of me money," Montgomery Falsworth stated as he placed his cards down on the table.
However, he can't help but smile whenever she does, because though he'll never admit, he likes to be taken care of. He likes to be pandered at times, and at this moment, he wants nothing more than to be cuddled and pandered. He wants to be held like he's the most important person in the world, and even if he tells himself he can't, he wants it to be Steve and Bucky. He fucken wants them, though they probably won't be in the mood to cuddle with him. They were distant in their final days together. They were sleeping together in their own room, while he slept
"According to Stark with the core and battery fried, it would be impossible to fix. Then he joked like egoist person that he is, that only a Stark would be able to fix it," she stated annoyed.
She almost jumped, not noticing him there. She didn't even hear him, which annoyed her. "When are you leaving?" she asked, ignoring his insult. "Does Rogers know you are leaving?"
The metal table felt cold to her face, and she just wanted to stay here to rest, but the thought of sleeping scared her. She knew it was just a dream, but she couldn't take hatred-filled Bucky's face. Though she had to allow the timeline to stay intact, she doubted her decision not to tell Barnes and Rogers. How much would have changed if she told them?
"That's frozen! What do you want me to do with raw chicken?" the archer asks as if that the dumbest thing ever.
Exhaling, Toni continued her walk back to the apartment, but she didn't make it too far, hearing something. "What is that?" she asked herself, as she turned in the direction of the noise. It sounded like a fight, and she knew what a fight sounded like as she had been in a lot herself. Against her better judgment, she headed toward the sound. Her heart stopped when she arrived at the location of the sound…It was an alley. "Stop being a chicken," she yelled herself.
He had reached for a glass but he decided against it and just drunk out of the bottle. "I'll go crazy if I stay here and do nothing," he stated as he took a drink. He stared at the bottle for a second before completely downing it.
Asset turned from where the Brunette's house once stood and stared down at the ocean below. In the aftermath, the ocean was anything but calmed as pieces of the house were tumbling down the steep cliff, hitting the water hard. The ruff, violent water reached high into the sky with each impact from the fragments of the plummeting house, and it was difficult to make out the Beefy Blonde who had dived into the water to search for the Brunette. It was both honorable and stupid for the Blond to go diving in after the woman, which annoyed the Asset even more.
Sharon tucked the gun in her subs and glared at Toni. "Well, it was nice to see again, Stark. Good to know you hadn't change since the last time I saw you. Still only thinking of yourself."
However, the more he watched her, the more he wanted to learn about this feeling for this brunette. It made his curious, as he wondered why she brought out these emotions inside of him. It made him wonder why she brought anything out of him in the first place, considering he was a weapon. A weapon. He shouldn't be allowed to have any type of emotions whatsoever, but there was something building in his chest, which he couldn't help but wonder why. This was why he followed the brunette, so he could study her, learn about her.
Howard’s insinuation that he was interested wasn’t wrong, but it did just highlight to Steve how weird it was. He was 26 or in his 70’s and Tony is 21, young and care free. He didn’t want a solider from WW2, he was his friend and protector. He knew Peggy knew about his feelings, he never gets anything past her, but she knows how to manipulate him. Make him Tony’s protector, Tony’s bodyguard and nothing more. He couldn’t face it. Not now. Not with a mission ahead of him, there would always be another mission, he just had to get through this one. Then maybe he could take a day to himself. Maybe.
Sam walked up to stand toe to toe with Tony, who had leaned his head up to allow Sam clear access to the collar of his crisp white shirt. Tony reached his arm round the back of Sam’s arm to grab the sandwich and chuck it at Thor, who grabbed it in his hands, raising it slightly in a cheers motion before taking a large bite. Sam, flipped the clip on the device and turned it around. “Seriously,
“Kid, hey its alright, I believe you, I swear don’t worry, please uh, stop hyperventilating.” Tony awkwardly shuffled them towards the couch. Peter passed out. Tony awkwardly caught him in his arms and laid him out on the couch. He took a step back to get a look at the kid, Tony walked over to the kitchen table and started to rummage through the paper trails, he landed on a blood test kit. He might as well be sure and totally check to see if they kids ok. Or high on drugs but mostly to see if he is his son, just in case his gut feeling isn’t right. Tony stops as he reaches to grab the testing kit and stares at the jacket on the back of the chair, he sighs. His face shifts into a slight pained expression, he would need to pack up Steve’s stuff into his room. It had been 3 weeks since he left school and if the kid was staying he’d need a place to sleep. Steve wasn’t coming back, he was the ‘Captain’ now, he didn’t have to be friends with him anymore, he could be in Africa or back in Boston for all he knows. Though… the kid knew Steve, no. Rogers, so maybe they would be friends again, long life ahead of him if the kids story is true. But for now Rogers had left him alone to go be the ‘Captain’ again, he’d lost his best friend. Walking over to Peter, Tony dropped down on to one knew and extracted a sample of the blood. Grabbing a pen and paper, he left a note for Peter to explain where he went, picking up his coat from the floor by the door, he headed towards the campus laboratories to see if he could sneak in a test result now.
Tony’s date actually had gone well in his books, his date was good looking, handsome, not quite a full arse hole but acceptable for the Stark family tree to accept, but the entire time he sat across from Justin ‘sour face’ Hammer, he just couldn’t help but feel the pressure to decide who Peter’s dad was? It could have been the guy across from him, but he actually couldn’t stand him! But Tony just decided to at least give the guy a second date. Tony remembered the moment why he stopped liking Hammer.
but we went back to see Dum_Ee! And he was super happy to see you and then you hit Dad with a tennis ball and then-“ Tony stretched out on the bed, finally free of a suit and crossed his legs the other way round.
“Not unless you tell me who it should be kid. Then no.” Tony said acrimoniously. Peter shook him head, he couldn’t say especially after the fight yesterday, he wouldn’t even believe him if he tried.
Peggy hummed thoughtfully, “Sorry Peter but we don’t have a sure way of getting you home, but we are testing some theories at the moment, for now stay with Tony and keep out of trouble. Alright?” Peter nodded with a dejected sigh. He didn’t have much time to dwell on it when he heard his Pop’s voice coming down the hall.
wrapped his larger frame round the pair, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder. Happy that his little family was whole again. Peter clung tightly to his Dad’s suit, just even taking in the smell of the expensive cologne
Peter woke up to the sounds of his parents hushed voices outside the car. He lifted his head off the glass of the passenger door, “come inside you two idiots, and bring my godson in I want him in a proper bed, its already 3am! Look at the poor boy, all twisted. Tony be a dear and bring him in. Steve go grab some sheets out the hall cupboard and prepare a bed for him.” Aunt Peggy told his fathers. Peter felt the door of the car open away from his face, Tony unbuckled his seat belt and wrapped his arms gently arm the back of his neck and lower body. Peter curled in towards his Dad. “Hey kiddo, we’re here, you can catch up with Aunt Peggy in the morning.” Peter was in and out of sleep as his Dad carried him up the main staircase at the mansion. He felt the soft pillow at his head as his Dad laid him down, and his parents’ wishes of a goodnight sleep.
“I…” Tony fell softly to his knees in front of his godmother. Shuffling towards her, he lay his head down in her lap, crying. “I am beyond angry at you Aunt Peggy, I…” Tony closed his eyes, “I have been so alone. Steve hasn’t spoken to me and I believed it was because of me, me and my own selfish actions or the way I treated him… but I am extremely hurt to find out that
Steve called out to his son, “Fallback Peter! This is too dangerous!” Peter shook out the nerves from his arms and neck, preparing to run towards his dads. The Gauntlet sparked the ground directly in front of Peter. Peter caught off guard fell back a step. Deciding not to waste any more time, he leaped into the air and ran along the ceiling gripping his mask between his hands. Dropping down behind his Pops and calling the elevator down to the lab. Steve twisted his bad arm to make sure his son was safely behind him. Peter realized that his Pops was still wearing his pajamas, barefoot and ready to fight in an instant, ready to protect with his shield. His vibranium shield.  OH SHIT!
“Shoo. In MY office, come on.” Tony gestured towards the office with his hands. Obi’s smirk fell, turning on his foot to walk back into the office. He picked his tumbler glass off of the counter, swishing his glass around with the ice clicking against the sides. He made his way round to the other side of the desk, Tony picked up his pace and slid into the chair from the other side before Obadiah could sit in his chair. He smiled with a boyish grin up to where Obi stood above him, whisky in hand. Obadiah made his way round to the other side again, sitting down opposite Tony in the black leather chair.
Peter was frozen to his spot watching his Dad and Uncle through the crack, he could almost go home, his Dad was coming to get him. He wasn’t moving however, scared that if he did that, he wouldn’t see his Dad again. Director Carter quickly stepped into action, gripping the sides of Peter’s upper arms and pulling him back two steps, just in time before items came flying through the portal; his Dad’s wrench, a chuck of Vibranium, a fingerless glove of his Pops, a couple of sheets of paper and his Dad’s pencil.
Horrors, he though to himself, the lot of them, selfish horrors. Rhodey stood his ground in front of the bouncer. The two way radio on his belt hissed to life. Rhodey glared up at the annoying bouncer as he turned away to answer his radio. “Yes sir…. I understand… but sir!… Ok. Yes sir.” Rhodey smirked to himself and lost it just as quickly when the bouncer turned around. “Cadet Rhodes?” Rhodey stood to attention, in his best authoritative position; shoulders back, chin up. “Yes, that’s me.” The bouncer let out another harsh breath from the side of his mouth. “Apologies for the mix up, Sir. Go right ahead.” Rhodey kind of loved the fact that it hurt the guy to let him through.
Peter moved to stand beside the piano, watching the interaction between his Dad and his Grandfather, “Do me a favour, Tony, try not to burn the house down before, Monday.” Tony held his hands out to gesture towards the door, “Ok, so its Monday, good to know, I will plan my toga party with Peter accordingly. Barbados, correct?” Tony moved to stand behind his mother, shoulder to shoulder with Peter.
Tony bent down at his knee to pick up the discarded energy drink can, he threw the can over his shoulder, not looking back as he stood up. “10 points Boss.” The can landed perfectly in the recycling bin behind him. Tony carefully made his way over to his desk, pushing in the black leather office chair, he straightened out the three keyboards, in the semi-circle desk, scooping the empty takeaway boxes into the trash bag. Tying the bag off in a knot, he handed it over to Dum_Ee. Tony made his way to the hallway to head upstairs to start cleaning up Peter’s room. The lights to the lab slowly dimmed as Tony made his way up the glass stair case. He paused to look back, over the handrails, he sighed at the messy sight of his workshop.
But it turned out ok… Tony would end up with someone who wouldn’t take advantage of that wealth, it would all end well. Steve shook himself out of his thoughts, with a small nudge from Clint, “Steve, where is this?” Clint hands over two large blueprint sheets, both missing their titles, ripped from the edge. One of the properties looked quite military and large but Steve immediately recognised the second property, it was the blue prints for the East wing of Stark mansion. Tony’s room. “Don’t know the first, the second is Tony’s main wing of the Stark mansion.”
Steve stood tall and silent, using his presence to over shadow Howard. “Am I wrong? All but two of the ‘Howling Commandos’ are dead are they not? All that’s left in your life Ste, is us two, I’m just trying to look out for you buddy, look I can set you up with a nice dame, settle down or I can get you posted to a conflict zone, make some new friends on the front line.”
The journey to the science labs at MIT, Peter just took in the experience of watching his not, yet parents just talk about their lives over the last 5 months, he saw the ‘captain’ disappear, this guy was just a solider called Steve Rogers, coming home to best friend and catching up on what Tony has been studying and their crazy ex-neighbour. Watching a solider and his student best friend laugh and get excited at random moments when they are filled in about stories and gossip of their friends like Rhodey and his ‘girlfriends’.
So, it's been a while! So sorry for the delay on this chapter after a hectic month or so I finally finished the chapter! Thank you all so much for your continued love and support while I've been busy! We're coming to the end of the story, I'm estimating about another two chapters, so thank you again for all the support for this story! x
“I’m working at a coffee shop to keep myself busy, I have Karen working in the background to run possible scenario solvers while I’m either running or at the flat. Tony’s invited me to Christmas at the Stark mansion which is cool.” Thor started off into the distance as he does when he leaves Peter for a moment to speak with someone who is with him. Peter wondered to himself, who was with his Uncle this time? “Peter, the Captain is with me in Asgard. He wishes you to know that he is very proud of your hard work at the coffee shop and misses you immensely. He also needs to confirm that the year is 1991?”
Tony turned pushed himself off the wall and moved to stand next to Peter. “He’s a real dick, isn’t he?” Peter snorted out a laughter. Tony followed with his own. “So, my software is running data on this whole situation it may take some time.” Peter stood up and turned to Tony, “I need something to do like a course or a job! I need to keep busy.”
Tony, flabbergasted, jumped out the bed, getting his feet caught up in the sheets, he fell to the floor, face first on to the cream carpet, he groaned in pain and the bruising of his ego. He rolled over on the rug, looking directly up to Rhodey standing over him. “We weren’t like that!?” Tony rolled over again, pushing himself off the floor. “We’re just friends! Best friends! He’s not ! I mean I’m not like that Rhodey. Just… his sheets were clean and I … he just yeah. I couldn’t sleep and his room was warm and-“ Rhodey slapped his hand over Tony’s mouth. Raising his eyebrow. “You done?”
hips slid round the other side of his desk, picking up his phone and sliding it into his suit pocket. Placing his hands on his hips, Tony focused on finishing the food. Clint finally pushed himself up and out of the chair, he got to work preparing the gauntlet for transportation. Sam’s heavy boots clucked their way down the stairs to the workshop, taking in the sight of Tony, half a sandwich stuck in his mouth, clipping the transportation devices on the collar of his shirt, frozen at the appearance of Sam. He sighed, “Should’ve guessed you Starks’ would go all out and treat this like a family adventure, come here, you’ve put it on upside down.”
Peter was already asleep when Tony left his room to grab a glass of water, when he spotted the glow of blue seeping out from under Peter’s room door. Tony let his curiosity get the better of him. He slowly opened the door to peer around the corner, he heard Peter’s gentle breathing indicating he was asleep so Tony opened the door a little more. His eyes widened in wonder as he took in the sight of the holographic displace, far more advanced than he could have imagined it would be. The quality was better than an display monitor he had ever owned. Tony finally took in the photo being projected on to the far wall, spotting Peter quickly, Tony let in a quiet gasp as he saw his future self. His hair was cut in a short spiked style rather than the large waves of hair on top of his head at the moment and the styled goatee he was sporting, he’d never really considered facial hair until this moment but it really did suit him, if he could grow facial hair, he might give it a shot. He took in the appearance of the suit he was wearing, arms wrapped around Peter’s side. Tony only recognized Rhodey and Steve from the photo, who was sat on Peter’s other side, a gentle smile towards the camera, one arm in his lap the other behind the couch towards Peter and Tony. Tony stared at the faces of the many strangers in the photo, he assumed it was the members of Peter’s large extended family, they all looked genuinely happy to be there. Well at least he would repair some sort of friendship with Steve if he trusted him to spend time with his son. Peter rolled over to face towards the door and Tony took that his time to leave shutting the door gently behind him, Tony thought about what he had seen as he stood in the hall of his small apartment. It was amazing to see himself, that he lived that long and that he had a real family … that cared for him and his … son. Man, a kid, he’s going to make the most of this time with his son now, this was going to be epic if he didn’t magically transport home tonight. If Tony had stuck around a bit longer he might have noticed his silver wedding ring, with the two stripes and a small diamond, one red and one blue. He would have noticed that Steve was wearing the same ring on his hand. But Tony didn’t stay long enough to notice.
Steve smiled and stood back, taking the salute of a boy scout, “I promise,” He looked around the room to judge the distance between Bruce, Thor and themselves. He stepped back into Tony’s personal space, “I promise, Dr Rogers, I will bring our son home and we are never going to let go of him ever again.” Tony laughed, “Good, you better, Soldier. Our son is lost, bring him home. He’s been away too long.” Steve stood tall. “It’s Captain actually. Makes me more qualified to go get him. Now come on, we need to go through our memory boxes and look for any clues. The portal going open up in the next couple of days. I want to be prepared.” Tony’s face could only show his determination and nothing was going to stop him from bring his family back together.
“Right, I’ll pull out some of my clothes for you since you are going to be staying here until further notice, if you are still here tomorrow, we’ll head out and buy you some clothes of your own!” Peter walked in and inspected the room, “Steve should have a spare toothbrush somewhere, he’s prepared like that…” clearing a space next to the bedside table Peter rubbed his face to stay awake when Tony knocked on the door again to get his attention.
“Ok, Thank you Doctor.” Natasha gestured for the doctor to leave. She did so with a confused look on her face. “Don’t say it.” Steve said out to the empty cabin. He didn’t want to hear it. “I wasn’t going to. You’re smart enough for me not to. But it doesn’t add up. Even you can see the possible connections.” Steve sighed, he didn’t think Natasha would even bother about Peter, she wasn’t in the room with them when Peter’s parents spoke. She didn’t know that Steve had already met both Peter’s parents. They were smart workaholic scientists, Tony was Tony, but Peter’s father seemed … nice. Natasha didn’t know, so he couldn’t tell her that he at best, was maybe an uncle or a godfather.
“Guys, can you give us a moment?” Steve looked round the room to the other avengers, they all nodded in response, “We’ll be upstairs, portal opens in fifteen minutes so we’ll come back down in ten. Keep it PG guys!” Clint patted Steve’s back and followed everyone up the concrete stairs, conversing between themselves, everyone could feel the tension rising, they were so close to getting him home. Steve placed his hands on his hips, just resting above his belt, shaking his head as he chuckled to himself. “Are we that bad?” Steve looked over to Tony who was finishing up code with Friday displaying it above his head, helping as best as a program could.
Turning off the engine, it let out a loud cough before going silent, he sighed and rested his hands on his lap. “Dude are we really going to do this?” Steve nodded to himself, trying justify the stupid plan. “We just need the radio transmitter and we can’t just waltz into Shield and steal one.” Clint laughed hysterically and turned to look out the window, “No, just steal it from the Smithsonian! That’s so much easier!”
Peter stretched his arms above his head to signal that he was exhausted, the pair stood up at the same time and placed the dishes in the sink for tomorrow, Tony lead them down the hallway, Peter stretching his back out as he walked. Tony hesitated, he squeezed the handle of Steve’s room before releasing his grip slightly Tony opened the door for Peter. Tony didn’t step inside.
As he watched the Brunette, he couldn't help but wonder who this woman was. Why did she warrant him watching her? What purpose did she serve? What was her skills? Why did his handlers want her? What was so special about her? Was she a useful tool like him? By looking at her, he could tell that she wasn't a weapon like him, though he knew that she had to have some kind of purpose. His handers wouldn't want her, if she didn't. Sure, the Asset knew she was smart, brilliant—though he would never admit that to his handers. It wasn't his place to cast judgement on her.
She felt her face twitch as Barnes stared deep into her eyes. "Stay down," she ordered as he started to stand.
"Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone."
He let out a small, painful sigh, hating the sound of his last name on her lips. He wondered if she knew how much he hated it. "Please, Toni. Don't do this to me," he said, his voice soft. "Please." Toni stopped her struggle and stilled. She didn't say a word as he lifted her up and brought her to one of the sofa. He gently put her down, but he didn't move from her side. He didn't let her go. "Toni, what did you see?" he asked softly as he placed a soft kiss to her wet hair.
2) I enjoy protective Clint and Natasha. Also, I am no way support Domestic violence, and my version of Steve doesn't either. I did struggle with that in this chapter, because it isn't something you wipe away. It isn't acceptable ever, but I didn't see it as such. I saw it as an accident, and it will remain as an accident. Steve isn't going to go down that path in my story, though he may feel like crap for awhile. I hope that makes sense.
Toni couldn't help but groan, because that was too long. She couldn't wait that long as there was no telling what could happen in that time. She couldn't risk talking to anyone else while she was in this state as there was no telling what could happen. There was a chance that she would say something else she would regret, and she couldn't take the rest of the Avengers hating her, though she wondered if that was too late. She wouldn't put it past them as she was truly a horrible person.
That stroke Phillips as odd. Did he not know about Toni? Maybe, he didn't know, or maybe, he didn't care, though that would be out of character for the choir boy. He turned to Peggy, wondering if this had anything to do with her as Toni and she didn't get along. "You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won't enjoy." He was tired of their fights, though it seemed like he no longer had to deal with them.
It was clear that he was trying to get some kind of smile from her, but Toni was in no mood. She especially wasn't in the mood to deal with him. "I-"
Barnes smirked as he raised her hands above her head and walked her back into a tree. "But I'm a loveable ass."
Tony looks up, and he can feel his heart miss a few beats, noticing the pain in Bucky's eyes. It hurts, physically hurts, to see him like this, and Tony hates it. It makes him want to hunt down every last Hydra and rip them apart with extreme prejudice. He wants to kill them all, and he knows Steve feels the same as he stares at the Sergeant with an intense look.
However, age wasn't the only thing making the letter harder to read, as the author seemed to be in a hurry. It was clear that the author normally had smooth penmanship as the first three words were neat, but as the letter went on, the words got closer together, almost bending together. There were even hesitation marks up and down the letter. It appeared as the letter went that the man was no longer trying to keep it neat and clean.
Shaking her head, she stepped out of her Iron Man suit and onto the roof of Steve's crappy apartment building. Was it fair to call it crappy? Granted, she did think everything that wasn't her tower was crappy, and besides, his apartment
"It's hard to process the memories," Steve admitted as he took another drink. Although these memories gave him glimpses of Toni, they were a painful experience. They felt real, but at the same time, they felt wrong and fake, and there was no control of them. There was no order to them, and he couldn't get the one that he really wanted. He wanted to know what happen to Toni in that hospital. Seeing a worry look on Bruce's face, he added, "During the war when I found out that the 107 were captured outside of Italy, I went across enemy lines to save them with no care to what happened to myself."
"No, I'm good." Toni eyed Peggy as she stepped away. "What's going on? Where are we going?" she asked.
"If anyone sounds like a bully, it's you," Clint responded, as both Steve and he closed the distance between them.
Pierce smiled as he stepped toward the man. "Our window is limited. Two targets, level six." Asset nodded. "They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours."
After a few deep breaths, Toni forced her eyes open, and with everything that she had, she kept them open. For a few long seconds, the light blinded her, but she wouldn't, refusing to close her eyes. She needed to focus, she needed to stay awake, she needed to protect herself. She concentrated. Picking a distant object, Toni stared, willing the shadow to take form. After a few long seconds of staring, it did take shape. It morphed into two shapes, and it looked, even from the distance, like the shapes were fighting.
Toni glanced at Rogers, whose glance never let her, and she felt her fear raise up again. Why was he here? How did he get caught? Where was the rest of the Commandos? She felt herself shivered as she couldn't let anyone die because of her. She had done enough damage.
"Well, you two should be off, then. Don't want to keep the fan girls and boys drooling." He also needs to get that image of a protective Barnes out of his mind.
"Ton-" Steve started but was interrupted. "I take offense to that, Barton. I'm not dog. If anything, I'm a cat!" she replied, imagining the looks on their faces. "Dogs are stupid, trained to follow commanders, but cats are smart. They listen to no one, doing whether they want whenever they want. They sleep wherever they want. They-"
call that baby a car- by the curb and put down the window. With grin that took up her face, she inquired, "Does any of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil." Her eyes flicking to Toni. In truth, she was focused on her covered wrist.
"What do you want?" she asked as she locked the suitcase. There was no real point to lock it as both Howard and Phillips had a key, but it gave her a little comfort to lock it.
Toni closed her eyes, trying to catch her breath, but there were so many things in her head that she couldn't, and it was driving her closer and closer to a panic attack, which angered her. She hated those panic attacks of hers, which seemed to have gotten better… or so she thought.
Howard was waiting for Rogers by the shields. "I got a few things for you," he stated as he patted the table. He smiled and stated, "And by the way, fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend."
"Phillips left you in a cell? For what?" he asked annoyed. However, he wasn't annoyed at her which she could tell. It was redirected at the Colonel. "No phone calls or letters?"
"Don't you want to save yourself? The Americans will not last against me." He let go of her face. "Tell me about that device is in your chest. I promise I will not hurt you."
Fury's look was anything but friendly as he glowered. "We don't have time for your kissy face, Stark. We need to discuss what happened."
Tony isn't sure when his opinion changed on Barnes, but he no longer hates him. If he really thinks about it, how could he hate someone who went through what Barnes had gone through? He went through decades of torture, which no one else can say. So how can Tony judge him? Though his torture cannot compare, he knows how it feels. He knows how it feels to know only pain. He knows how it feels to completely lose oneself and not know who you are anymore. He doesn't know why it took him so long to realize that, but now that he does, he can no longer hold it against Barnes, though that isn't to say it still doesn't hurt. Though he may not have gotten along with his father, it doesn't mean he didn't care for him, because he did—does. He does care, and it hurts.
blood family… and you thought it would be best to keep that from me!?” Pierce looked… uninterested at Steve’s outbursts. “Yes, I heard of your unfortunate news. The lost of the Stark family is a true tragedy. And young Anthony, I heard you two were… close. Shame, he was a smart kid.” Pierce sneered and let a little of his disgust show through at the mention of their relationship.
Steve whipped his head away to stare at the grey concrete wall, far more interesting than the looks of pity from Peggy. She left, following on the heels of Pierce, out the door and down the hallway. Steve gave himself a nodded, impressed with his own acting skills. He quick pulled his arms forward and out of the bonds one by one. Kicking his legs, out of the bonds and jumping to the ground. He took a quick step behind the table and rolled his eyes, they just left his shield leaning against one of the table legs. Its like they want to give him all the help they can before he beats the living crap out of them on his way out the door. Picking up the shield and placing it on his forearm, he gave a good shield slam to the wiring under the table, just incase his escape didn’t
Toni could feel Brock's eyes on her as he watched her hop over to the suit, trying not to put any weight on it. He must have thought she was funny, but he didn't laugh or crack a smile. She glanced at him one last time before he suddenly looked away. She wasn't sure what he was look at, but she wasn't sure that she cared enough to find out. She just wanted to get back to the tower, find Steve, change out of her wet clothes, and get off her sore ankle. Like her shoulder, her foot was throbbing. Even if she refused to admit, she was close to tears.
Halfway to her tent, she noticed something along the tent. At first, she thought it was her stalker and almost flipped out, but after a few seconds, she realized that it was a fight between two idiots. They had to be idiots as only idiots would fight a comrade. Like an ugly car accident, she was unable to look away, and as she watched, she recognized one of the idiots: Bucky. Why in the hell is he in a fight? She thought. He wasn't someone who got into fights. Surprisingly, it was Rogers, who she was still mad at, that got into fights.
There was sharp intake of air next to her, reminding them that Rhodes was in the room. He glanced between the two before he took a step forward. He could see Pepper's face morph into anger, and it scared most who came across her. "Pepper," he said.
Feeling light headed, she sat down on the closest chair. Toni told herself it was because of the lack of sleep and her body couldn't keep up. It wasn't because Howard was blind siding her. "I would know that?" she uttered with as much confusion as she could. "And my name is S-"
She blew out slowly, as she thought of what she would do if she was in his situation. "It doesn't matter." She was beginning to believe that it wasn't his tail who had attacked her. But then who was Salty's tail? She didn't notice anyone else following her besides the creepy stalker. There was another question: who did the creepy stalker worked for? Who was this Master?
She opened her eyes slowly. "It's just a flesh wound," she stated as she stood up. She looked toward the door and was greeted by the sight of Colonel Phillips. "Hello, Salty."
"How is he my personal Chief?" Tony asks. "If he is, he's so fired. He isn't wearing the mini skirt that was provided for his uniform." He knows he's playing it close, but he can't help it. He just speaks, and it's like there's an explosion of words in his mouth.
The next week or so, Toni did her best not to acknowledge Howard whenever he talked to her, which was harder said than done. Everything out of his mouth annoyed Toni, who wanted to snap back a witty nasty comment to everything he said, but she forced her mouth shut. There were points that she made her lips bleed as she bit down too hard. She knew she was being stupid and she should give him a chance, but she kept flashing back to her childhood and how she could never make him happy.
She barely felt Steve giving her a smiling kiss to her lips or when he turned from her. She didn't even recall him heading toward the quinnjet as she was focused on his words. She wasn't sure if he was upset by her lack of respond or what, but he didn't say anything and Toni wasn't sure what her respond would be. She took a deep breath as she shook her head and headed toward the lab. She needed her suits to clear her mind.
The Asset knew what his handler meant, but he didn't move. He didn't respond, just stared. His eyes were on the television and the images that flicked by. Rumlow nodded and replied, but the Asset wasn't paying attention anymore. His eyes were glued to the image on the screen as he noticed
Giving up the fight for control, Clint leaned back in the pilot seat. "And there's no fighting JARVIS. He's Skynet and going take over the world, and I don't want to be on his bad side when he does. Right, JARVIS?" he asked with a chuckle.
The pain started to die, and words started to make sense again; however, she still felt like surrounded by a heavy misty. Her mind felt weak, exhausted. She felt like she had been awake for…god knows how long.
Anyhow, I hope you like this chapter and the wait wasn't bad. I have been working so much that it is hard to find time to write, but I will try to be better. At least the chapters are long, right?
"You serve Hydra. Did you forget?" Rumlow asked as he took a step forward. There was a nastiness in his voice that wasn't there before. "We don't care what the whisper in the hallways are as long as they don't know about Hydra."
"I know," she stated. If she wasn't already damaged by the nightmares, she would be worried, but she wasn't. Her mind and soul were already damaged.
"Where's Rogers?" If she timed this right, she might get away before he came back. Where she would go after that, she wasn't sure.
With a few deep breaths and shaky hands, Toni turned away, but she wasn't the only thing to move. The shadow in the corner of the window moved yet
she yelled at herself. Now was not the time to think about that crap, nauseating to think about. Sure, she had sex types, but that meant shit. She may have laughed them off, but they still annoyed her. She had no say in them, recorded and released without her say so.
Steve gave her a look, not understanding what she was referring to. What did she mean by good answer? Did they think he just gave them the answer they wanted? Or was there a bad answer? He was confused. "What?"
Tony has been flying for hours, soaring until the sun pops up, when he gets the alert to assemble, and he's lying if he says he didn't react. For a few seconds, he fights with himself, wondering if he should stay back. With Captain America, Winter Soldier, Black Widow, Vision, Falcon, War Machine, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man, he knows he isn't needed, and there's nothing that they can't handle. With the team they have now, no one can defeat them, and they would be a fool if they try. If Tony's a supervillain, he would be pissing his pants, because he knows how deadly Barnes and Rogers are together. He knows how much damage those two can do alone. He
Natasha and Clint hovered close, keeping a close protective eye over her. "Do I need to hurt someone?" Clint asked her, his tone cold. "Because I will."
Her expression turns soft. "Okay, I'll tell them no visitors. Doctor's orders, but you owe me. Something big."
"Not now, Clint," Natasha replied as she kicked a man's legs out from underneath him, sending him to the ground hard.
Barnes pulled away a second later. "I don't care about your past. I don't care you have been with or who you haven't. I don't care about anything. I just want you."
It was true, and Toni had no idea when that developed, considering she wrote the book on one-night stand and how to get the guy out. She tried to publish it, but Pepper shoot her down. "And you love my cuddles. So, let's be honest. It'll be
Natasha simply nodded as she turned toward Toni, finally taking her legs out of Bruce's lap. He could see the fondness in the Assassin's eyes as she eyed the Genius. She might not be as close to Toni as the others and might not always get along with Toni, but she cared. Toni was a friend, a friend she would protect.
It was stupid he knew, but he couldn't just sit around while others died for their country. However, there wasn't much more Steve Rogers could do as he failed his second attempt to enlist. He wasn't going to give up, even it was hopeless. He knew no one was going to want him, a frail man, who couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag, and he hated that. He hated that he couldn't help his country, that he was too weak to do anything. He wished he could do something to help.
Steve didn't give her a chance to move as he crossed to her quickly. He didn't give Bruce any thought as his focus was on Toni and only Toni. "Toni," he called, as he tried to pull her into his arms. He wanted to hold her and never let her go, but it seemed like she wanted none of that. He couldn't say that it didn't hurt.
As the voice made Toni's skin crawl, she tried to ignore the man and walk deeper into the park. He was like everyone else on the street, throwing catcalls at her, but she didn't care- refused to care. They were just words, meaningless words, and they would not break through into her mind…though it might be a good thing. A distraction she needed.
"A run? In this weather?" Clint said, nodding to the window. It was still raining, and it didn't look like it would clear up any time soon.
"You have me," he said, as he ran the tips on his hands up and down her back. Once he calmed her down, he would take her to bed like he had done before, and like before, he was going to crawl in with her. He needed to sleep just as much as she did. "And I'm not going anywhere." The genius didn't respond, only nodding against his chest. "Not leaving you for the world." It was a dangerous statement, considering who they were, and what they faced daily, but he wasn't going to leave her unless it was the end of the world.
Her heart was beating a million miles per second, as it took her eyes minutes to open, feeling like she was trapped. It felt like someone was holding her, and she could feel her stomach doing flips. However, her heart stopped as she saw the Mark 42 reach and grab Steve. There was a wild look in his eyes, but he didn't allow the suit to pull him from Toni, fighting it. "Power down!" Toni yelled, feeling completely sick. She forced herself into a sitting position, allowing the sheet to pool in her lap and exposing her chest to the cold, icily air.
The Captain tried to control his flinch at the sound of his first name from Banner's lips. For some reason, it annoyed him to hear it. They were not friends, especially with Toni flirting with the scientist right in front of him. He wasn't sure if this was normal for Stark or whether she did this to everyone, but he did not like it. "Just find the cube," Steve said, coldly.
Toni stood outside of Stark Industries, wearing all black. She had a medium size black bag on her back, which held all of her tools. She watched from across the street as four black Chevrolet Carryall Suburbans pulled out of the compound. She knew her father, surrendered by his security team, was in one of those SUVs. There was no way she would be able to get the device if he kept it on him; however, it would be very stupid for him to have it on his person. The military considered the unnamed device a threat and Howard would not take a threat into the general public.
Toni couldn't watch this, but there was nothing she could do. How could she lose Steve so close after losing Bucky? She wasn't sure how much of this she could take. "Steve," she muttered, fighting back the tears.
She took a deep breath and smiled through the pain of chapped frozen lips. "As I'll ever be," she said. She wasn't sure why she was so nervousness, but something didn't feel right. It's just the nerves, she thought. It was probably because of what happened the last time; the torture was still fresh in her mind. She didn't know if she could handle that again. The very idea of it freaked her out. Relax, she told herself. You know Steve wouldn't let you get hurt. She knew if she was captured again, Rogers would come for her and that was relaxing thought.
What brings Tony back to the tower is seeing both Barnes and Rogers injured on the news. He doesn't like the idea of both of the Super Soldier hurt no matter how big or small the injuries are. He doesn't like that Rogers in covered in blood (thought he has no idea of who the blood belongs to), and he hates the idea of Barnes holding his metal arm close to his chest as if he can't move it. He doesn't like that he doesn't know what's going on with them. He doesn't like that he has no idea how badly hurt they are.
"What's going on back here?" Steve asked as he stepped into view. He was eyeing Barnes strangely. It was the same look that he had given Barnes before in the bar.
"I lost count," he said, softly. "But I come here and think." He paused for a second, just watching the video. "Just pondering what he would say to me if he saw me. Would he blame me? No, I know he wouldn't. He would think me an idiot. So, I like to think that he would be happy to see me like this…However, he would probably be mad at me for leaving you all the time, so I will have to fix that."
Hesitating for a second, Toni snatched the water bottle from the stranger's hand. Her hands shook as she took it and twisted the cap off. In the brief second that she looked at him, she could tell that he wasn't like the normal hikers she had seen before. Though she couldn't make out what exactly he was wearing, he had on way too many darks layers to be comfortable in this California heat. His long dark hair wasn't even put up to help with the heat, and with this temperature, it was probably glued to his face with sweat much like her hair. When she had started this walk, she had attempted to put her hair up, but it had long since fallen out.
"I thought you would like to see our guest," she said, stepping aside to reveal Rogers, who arms had been chained.
Toni waved her off. "Not protecting him. Well, I am, because man, have you seen his abs? Mouthwatering." she winks, laying her mask on thick. "But no. I'm not lying for him." She paused, taking a deep breath. "Because let's get one thing straight: if
Toni let out a sigh, wondering what Steve would do if he learned how much she detested it. Okay, she didn't detest the smell… or the season; she just didn't like the feeling she got whenever she heard about someone's Christmas. She wasn't jealous—okay, maybe a little-, but she blamed it on the fact that she missed the Christmases that she used to have. "It smells like a forest, and I won't be here anyway. Be in Malibu."
After struggling for a few minutes, Toni was able to touch the tip of the gun and work it toward her, which was a good thing as Peggy had been able to roll on top of her. She was about to knock Toni out when she noticed the gun pointed at her. "Now, get off," Toni ordered, knowing damn well that she couldn't shot this woman. There was also the fact that Toni wasn't really a good shot. She needed J.A.R.V.I.S. for that.
, and though fighting was a part of any relationship, they fought way too much for it to be healthy.
Barnes gave him a smile. "No, I would just invite her to my bed. She's easy on the eyes." He was smirked with a chuckle.
Dugan shook his head as he stepped away. "Not in public. People already think I'm a crazy old man, which I am, and many not believe it if they hear but they don't need to hear this," he said, leading Steve down a long hallway. It was a lengthy, painfully slow walk for both of them: for Dugan, his weak, old bones ached with each movement. His cane could barely support his weight, but he refused to sit.
The Private regained his composer and stepped toward Toni, who could see his anger as he grabbed her. "You-"
"Yea right. You're more a delinquent then I am," Toni countered as she stuck her tongue out. She was being childish she knew, but it was not hard not to be when dealing with Barnes. "And if I have to have a parasite going inside of me, I expected to be waited on hand and foot. Now hop to it, Barniez Boy!"
A man in a nicely tailored suit that fit him perfectly stood behind her with a suitcase in his left hand. It was clear that he had spent a pretty penny on that suit, which shouldn't be too surprising considering the cemetery that they were in. Just to buy one of these plots in this cemetery probably costed more than a year's rent in New York City and the upkeep was sometimes more than that. "My colleagues didn't think you would be here."
She stares at him, eyeing him; there's something in her eyes, a knowing look. "What is it, Stark?" she asks. "What got your panty in a knot?"
Steve's heart started to race as he thought of her. It was amazing what that woman could do to him, a super Soldier; she could make him melt. She could leave him speechless. Without another word, he bolted pass them and out of the gym, and without realizing he had even asked, he asked JARVIS of Toni's location. He was in auto drive at the moment, as he raced his way toward the robotic Lab.
Tony shots out, trying to focus on anything besides Bucky, who's staring at him. No matter what's happening in the room, James is eyeing him, following his every movement, his every twitch. Tony doesn't understand what's going on with the silent man, as he shouldn't be sitting in Steve's spot, so close to him. He's messing with the flow of the room, the goddamn flow of the room; plus, he shouldn't be paying this much attention to the genius.
"No, I'll surprise him," she said with a smile. She wanted to see his face when she stepped into the lab. "And get the Mark 7 prepared. After I see Bruce, there's somewhere that I need to be."
Don't kill me, but I love cliffhangers, and this chapter was calling to be ended here. It really was. When I was writing this, I kept thinking this was a good cliffhanger. So here you go.
"Good, because I'm not," Toni stated, eyeing him. "Do you know where the closer homeless shelter is?" she asked. Though she had no interest whatsoever in going, she knew she had no other choice; plus, it would be nice to get out of the cold. She didn't know how much more she could stand it.
"I didn't say that," Bucky stated defending himself. He reached into the closet grabbing his coat. "You're getting worked and it's not helping you. Plus, it must be hard for her to be in a stranger's house with no memory of who she is."
Tony's eyes twitches. "Remind me never to tell her anything again." He should've known that she would tell the Brooklyn Twins.
Rogers took a step back. "No, Ma'ma, I didn't mean any disrespect. I just wanted to make sure you were okay as no dame should be out here without a coat."
"Captain Rogers." Sharon greed as she walked toward him. It was a simple greeting, mostly due to the fact she knew how mad he was for that bullshit. His captain face could be seen a mile away.
Toni glanced up at him as she kind of wanted to see that fight. "So are you going to let me use the Tesseract?" she asked.
He put the rifle down and leaned forward against the table. "I could tell from the plane that he wanted to talk to you by the way he was staring at you and I can assume from the look on your face that he did."
However, he didn't have to time to think of that. He had to make sure that she was okay. It was the only thing that was important to him, because he did not know what he would do if something happened to her.
"Not Sark," she responded. She hated that goddamn name and if someone called her that name one more time, she was going to snap.
She jumped at a hand on her shoulder. "Are you okay?" Howard asked as he kneed down in front of Toni. "I have one of the techs getting a doctor. Let me see your hand."
He could do it, pretty easily. These walls were small enough for him to jump, while challenging for others, and he could disappear before anyone could notice and stop him. And if anyone came close, he would stare at them with this Captain stare and make them stand down. Though he would deny it to Toni, no one would tell him no when looking into his Captain stare and he knew it. "I'm not in the mood for this conversion," he replied, irritated.
"It isn't a ghost she's been seeing. It has been Hydra the entire time," Natasha replied, her voice turning ice cold. Her hands danced at her side. "This was the plan the entire time. Get her to the point that she doubts her sanity and turn her." She turned to Steve, her eyes unreadable. "We got to go."
"Oh, yes," Peggy replied. Her eyes large. "And Steve, you should see little Toni. She's so adorable with her Captain America doll and Bucky bear. I can eat her up. You will fall in love with her."
Gabe laughed. "You might not like what you hear," he teased as he played with his cards. He hadn't folded yet, and he was playing with his hand as if he was proud of it.
"A few of my men had run into a female soldier, but they were no match for her, and she escaped, which is quite impressive."
The Super Soldier glanced at Bruce as he approached him. "I can't sleep," he answered. "My mind won't stop. These memories won't stop." He paused. "I think I can understand why Toni can't sleep and why she's always in the lab."
Toni glanced at Rogers before giving a hard push to Barnes. "My stalker and yes," she answered, hating that she had to admit that she had a stalker. "And I don't want to talk about it." Before they could say anything, Toni bolted into the bathroom. She locked it as soon as the door was closed. "I really don't want to talk about it!"
Killian, even with his fake blonde hair, didn't falter under Steve's strong glance, which was impressive. "I would never dream of doing that, Captain." He pull on a huge smile as he turned back to Toni. "Well, I think it's time to make my leave, but I'm sure I'll see you again, Toni." He almost reached for Genius' hand again, but when he heard a cough at the door, he retracted his hand. "I better go before your Head of Security drags me out, right?"
"Afraid of the big guy?" he asked. There was a hint of laugher in his anger that Steve wasn't expecting.
Steve didn't need or want to hear that, even if he knew it was true. He knew everyone was struggling with the idea of Toni's being dead, but man, they had no idea of what he was going through. They had no idea of how he was dying inside. They had no idea that he was hoping against hope that Toni was alive, as he didn't know what he would do without her. "Barton," he said, slowly. There was a clear warning in his voice.
"So how did it come out wrong?" she asked. It annoyed her that he didn't want to be saved by her, but she guessed she could understand. She wouldn't want to be saved by anyone as well. She could save herself.
Toni stepped back to Banner and put her arm on his shoulder. "You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut," she said with a smile. Her hands squeezed his shoulder as she looked at him.
The room was rather large with computer towers lining the two side walls, while several monitors lined a third wall. Halfway down the third wall was the control board for the huge computer, which all of the main controls were located. Besides a few filling cabinets on the fourth back wall and a metal table, there was no chairs or other furniture in the room.
"Was this how she had been tortured?" he asked. "But that doesn't make sense. She was tortured before I met her, but this was only a few years ago." Unable to finish reading all of the horrible things those Ten Ring bastards did to her, he balled up the pager and threw it as hard as he could. This had been the torture that she had talked about, but how could that be? It didn't make any sense.
"If you touch her again, I'll beat the shit out of you, and her wellbeing is my concern, Private," Barnes stated as he grabbed the man by the collar. "GO." He shoved him off. There was a movement along the crowd but none stepped forward to break up the fight.
It was then that their eyes met. "Shit," she cursed loudly, as her hands dropped to the bottom of the blouse. Not caring if it was buttoned correctly, she quickly buttoned it. "Shit."
Sam waved at them. "Any time you wanna stop by the VA, making me look awesome in front of the girl at the front desk, just let me know. She will get a kick out of this."
Dum Dum Dugan turned him, completely shocked. "Rogers?" he asked, trying to push himself up. It looked like he was seeing a ghost as the color drained from his face. "I'll be damned."
"You're just being stupid," she told herself. She pushed herself up, exhaling slowly. She had to get her mind off Barnes' death.
Toni was sick and tired of being called a Spy; that was Romanoff and Barton's job. "How many times do I need to say it? I am not a spy," she snapped. She took a deep breath as she told herself to calm down. Her anger would get her nowhere. "Just let me go."
"Everything okay, Nat?" Clint asked, turning slightly. He was giving her look before he returned his glaze to the controls.
Toni let that slide as there was something going on in Peggy's head and she wanted to know what it was. "So Agent, what's going on in that head?" She asked, using a direct attack. She glanced at Carter one last time before she laid down. She twitched when she realized where she put her journal; it was digging into her back, but she did not move to get it. She wasn't sure if Peggy knew about it, but she did not want to draw attention to the fact that she kept one.
When Steve reached her, he snapped the chains with ease, and Toni could only watch. Before she knew what happened and before she could act, he pulled her into his arms for a bear hug.
The Asset turned back to the cliff one last time and stared at the water, which seemed to be calmed now. It was almost like it hadn't been disturbed by a falling house. He stared at the water for a bit, looking for the Beefy Blond. Being a Hydra weapon, the Asset wasn't sure why he wanted or need to see the Blond break the surface of the water, for him to be okay. It wasn't the same level of emotions and he didn't exactly feel the same like whenever he saw the Brunette, but there was something there. He just didn't know what; however, the Asset didn't have to ponder it for long as the Blonde broke the surface of the water-though he only stayed above the water for a few seconds before diving back down—riding him of that foreign emotion.
To her luck, she just had to deal with the few guards stationed by the door, who only nodded to her as she passed. They were used to her late nights in the lab, and they paid no attention to her. Once inside, she looked around to make sure she was alone. Sure, it was late and there was a small chance that anyone would be, but she just had to make sure.
Toni groaned as she looked her father over. She wanted to forget that Howard knew that he was her father, because it would be easier. "Peggy," she said, straightening up. "I have things to do. If you don't mind, I better be off."
"It means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD," Toni said. She quickly scanned the room before he eyes rested on Thor, to Steve's annoyance. "No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing," she said, looking him over. "Geez, look at those arms. You've been working out," she said with a wink as she squeezed.
Steve took a deep breath as he made his way down to the lab that Banner had locked himself in. He should have told Banner the truth when he brought up the time travel idea, instead of keeping it to himself. It was important. He knew he was going to get a lecture when he told Bruce. How could he be that stupid and not tell him about the memories? Shaking his head, he took a deep breath as he arrived at the doors to the lab. The doors were, like Stark's own personal lab, made out of glass; however, they weren't given a horrible paint job. He entered without having to enter a code as no code was required.
"You don't give yourself much credit." His expression fell slightly, but he still looked at her fondly. "I don't want easy, and yes, I know this won't be easy, but if it was easy, it wouldn't be worth having. I want you, because you'll challenge me. I know we'll fight, but everyone fights. It's normal, and I look forward for that, in fact," he said with a huge smile
Toni knew what he wanted to say, but she also knew that he would know that she was lying. "I'll try, Steve," she said, softly. "It's just…" She hated talking about her nightmares. Why couldn't she just pretend these didn't exist?
Bruce took a deep breath and looked up as he didn't know where to look. "I don't need rest," he lied. He knew he needed rest just as bad as Steve did. "But Steve isn't resting either."
"There's something odd, and I wanted to check it out," she said, not wanting to explain that she wanted to chase after a crazy, super strong Commander, who could knock her out in one punch.
However, Toni had other things to worry about, because Aldrich seemed—no, was. He was a complete nutcase, who needed a good punch to the face. Maybe, a kick to the junk as well. A good hard kick. He didn't care who got in his way or who got hurt, if he got what he wanted, which were super soldiers…who would obey him without question. And Toni knew he would do
"No, she did not but there is no telling what happened to the reactor in her chest, Sir. She did take precautions, but I am afraid that it was not enough."
Annoyed and frustrated, Toni pulled from Steve, but she kept a good grip on him. "What?" she asked, her lips swore. Again, where did Roger learn how to kiss? She needed to thank that woman, unless it was Peggy. If so, it would be weird. Really weird.
To be honest, this pain does not compare to those any of those times, but it still doesn't feel good. It still feels like his body is failing him, like it has given up. Tony doesn't know if that should scare him; he doesn't know if that's a reflection on him. Does he truly want to give us? Is his body just doing what he wants? …No, that doesn't make any sense, because he doesn't want to die. No, he really doesn't. No, he's just tired of fighting.
What was with everyone telling her that she should be resting? She was perfectly fine; the pain wasn't too bad. "You all worry too much. That so wasn't the first that I'd been tortured," Toni revealed, raising up her glass and taking a slip.
But he wanted his Pops who would try to help him do his homework as soon as he was home from school - even though it was above his head, his Pops who let him play with his shield when he was younger. Not this Steve, who seemed so reserved compared to his Pops.
“OH SUGAR PLUMS!” Ana called out in frustration, as Peter and Tony made their way into the kitchen area, the vast marble kitchen had been renovated by the time Peter was born, this kitchen was similar but a light wooden finish with sand coloured marble tops. Ana was wrapped in her apron, dropping the heavy pot back down onto the gas hob, with an exhausted sigh, placing her hands on her hips with a harrumph.
“Peter?! Bruce what’s happening?” Tony turned to the holographic screen next to him, “Shit its closing!” Tony turned to face Peggy and Peter, “Carter, you better take care of my kid till I can get him home! Peter, we are coming for you!” Peggy nodded curtly to Tony with her arms wrapped around Peter’s upper body.
Tony nodded, “Since you are finished, you missed a call from Shield. You’ve to make your way to the complex in New York? I don’t want to know how I found you in the ‘3rd best’ Strip club but get dressed. I’ll make coffee.” Rhodey helped Tony off the floor, placing him on the bed. Tony played with the loose thread protruding from the sheets. “Did they say why?” Rhodey shrugged, “Just said it was time and that you should be there?” Tony’s eyes popped open. Peter was going home!
“It doesn’t matter now Steve, you’re back, we’re back-“ Steve jumped up, jostling Tony who was leaning onto his side, holding his hand out to help Tony up. “ It does matter! They lied to me!, to You! They knew, They took advantage of me and of you! It ends now! Never again.” Steve marched his way round to the other side of Peggy’s desk, taking the pen out of its stand he slammed a piece of paper down and began to write.
And their son had it front and centre on his wall. Tony stood up, running his hand gently over the frames, the thin layer of dust coming off on his finger. “Friday. Can you send up the cleaners to give the room a refresh, I’m going to do some of Peter’s laundry.”
It's been a long time now, at least a year since he last took the trip with his Pops. He missed his family. Making his way up the couple of stairs to the front door. Twisting the handle he pushed the door open slowly and stepped inside. He dropped the heavy bag off his shoulders and down onto the floor by the door. Peter rubbed his shoulder as he made his way through the cabin to check on each of the rooms. The kitchen thankfully fully stocked with rations since the two person team made the trek at the start of each month. Peter’s room was empty beside one bed a far cry from his poster filled room in the 21st century.
The knock at the door, stopped all conversation, Jarvis gestured for them to stay, Tony started up the conversation again, they were all happy to laugh at Tony’s silliness, until Peggy Carter came through the door. Everyone stopped to look at her, she had tears in her eyes. “Anthony, I’m so sorry.” Tony stood up quickly, his chair screeched as it moved back. “Aunt Peggy?” Peter let the tear flow freely down his face. Tony stood in front of his Godmother, “Tony, there was an accident…” Ana covered her mouth to hold back the shock. “Howard, had been drinking on the flight across, they got involved in a road accident.” Tony eyes were wide in shock, “Where are they? Where’s Mom?” Peggy, coughed and took a step forward, “Tony, they didn’t survive the crash.” Peter was as his Dad crumpled to the floor, screaming with every breath he had. Peggy took a step forward to give her godson a hug, but he refused, chanting, ‘no, no, no, no!’ to himself over and over again. Peggy nodded, she apologised to Jarvis again and left the Stark Mansion.
"Toni?" Harley called out. His softness leaked through his tones, though his fear also leaked through as well. It was clear this boy was in over his head. "Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York."
She looked up just before losing consciousness to see Howard step to the Colonel. Toni wasn't sure what they were speaking about, but she hoped it wasn't about her being from the future. He couldn't know that she was his daughter as that would change everything. However, she wasn't able to do anything besides drifting into a nightmare as the drugs had taken over and fear filled her heart.
Tony can feel his chest tighten as that's too early for their morning run, but there's no other reason for his soldiers to be out of bed…unless they had a nightmare. It isn't uncommon for one of the three to have a nightmare and need to get out bed, but usually, they ended up back in bed later to cuddle with each other. This waking up alone isn't new to Tony, but he doesn't like it, not after having spent weeks with those two in his bed.
Her heart was going to pop out of her chest, as it was deafening in her ear. "Shut up," she hissed, trying one last time to get rid of him. "Why don't you just shut up? And go back to wherever you came from!"
"He's around." He paused. "He's talking to some of the men." He was staring at her again with those eyes. "We're almost at camp. Only a few more miles."
to answer. She wanted to be open with him, but she didn't want to open herself up at the same time, considering it would end up in pain. She knew she sounded like an idiot, not knowing what she wanted or what she didn't want. However, she knew she had to or else she would go crazy. "Are you ticklish?"
Taking eyes off them, Toni turned toward her father who had turned from her toward the podium. With a deep breath, she followed after him, knowing that he needed to know. He needed to know that she didn't hate him anymore. "Howard," she called.
Howard jumped in. "The moment you think you know what's goin' on in a woman's head, it's the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed."
This craft was unusual to say the least, and it took some time for Steve to find the lab, but when he finally came across it, the Captain just stared. He couldn't keep his eyes off the energetic Stark as she worked. He couldn't get over how comfortable she looked when she worked.
Steve softly and slowly traced Toni's forearm. "Yes," he said, gently, as Toni closed her eyes again.
This was why he snapped on everyone who walked by, even though he was ecstatic that his genius was alive. He knew it would only be a matter of time before she ended up dead, and that—
He was still sitting at the table, reading the newspaper. He looked up at her and his mouth almost dropped, because she looked amazing in the dress. "…Help with what?"
He was a man of little words and it annoyed Barnes. "Is it permanent?" he asked, trying to get something out of him.
Salty looked at her. "Let's talk about this device and that thing in your chest. No one can figure out anything about them, not even Mr. Stark and he's our head weapons expert." The colonel spread the photos apart.
She heard her name escaped from his lips, but she didn't open her eyes right away. Instead, she focused on his voice, as it called to her like no other voice had. She wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but she wanted to hear his voice again, and she was rewarded a few seconds later as he said her name again.
When Central Park came into sight, Toni slowed down to a trot. The thoughts were still there and she didn't want to stop, but she eyed the park, the only green spot in the city. It was where a lot of people went during the day for countless things, and it was where people relax, enjoying the sights. However, it wasn't the place to be at this hour, but for some reason, the genius made her way over to the park, ignoring the honking horns and insults throw at her.
The Asset's boots clicked lightly against the hard wood floor, as his fists were at his side. There was no reason as to why he was called to the window. It wasn't like he expected an attack, though it would be ill-advised to not be prepare, and it was what he told himself when he stared out the window. He was a weapon, a tool; he wasn't supposed to think like this. He wasn't supposed to feel as he was supposed to be an unfeeling, killing machine. He wasn't supposed to be concern besides anything besides the mission, but he was drawn to the window. Felt drawn to this city.
She took a quick look around. There were a few doors along this hallway but each door was locked; however, there was nothing behind those doors that she wanted. Toni had seen the plans and had even been in this building before, which meant she knew her away round, even if she didn't know all of its secrets. She knew the most logical place that her father would be keeping her device and it would be farther in the building. However, the first thing that she needed to do was get to the control room.
She studied the bed, which didn't have wheels. She would either need to detach the railing of bed or drag the bed, but the latter would be noisy. Someone would hear and stop her, which she could not have. Laying down on her back on the floor, she fought her reflex to jump up. Though her gown was covered more than it did in the future, the back of the gown was still open. Stupid gowns, she thought.
"S-Toni," he uttered as he tried some random codes. "Please let me in." He sounded weak, and it almost broke her. The way he said her name did not help as it made her heart miss a beat.
"Thanks, Helen." He'll get her whatever she likes as long as she keeps them away from him. "Whatever you like."
"I know, but-" Steve didn't finish as the door that Toni disappeared through opened, silencing the room. He eyed the door, waiting for someone to walk through. He sucked in his breath and held it as he waited perfectly still. Toni was always able to do this to him, even when she wasn't try to, and this time was no different.
and the utter betrayal she felt, though Toni had no one to blame but herself. "It sounds like something you can and will turn into a weapon, like enhanced soldiers, private armies, and if you caught my press conference a few years ago, I do NOT make weapons."
"HEY! You should never count out a Stark," she countered. Though she wouldn't tell him that about the Iron Man Suit, she had the urge to bring it up, so he wouldn't think of her as defenseless. Even with her self-defense classes, she wasn't the strongest person around, but she could defend herself just as well, if not better, than most. "And there's nothing wrong with an engineer."
Steve was too tired—okay, too cranky for this, and he just wanted to crawl into bed with Toni. "JARVIS," Steve called.
Barnes stared at her, unsure what to make of her. "You have some energy. What do you use that for?" He winked at her, causing her to blush.
Howard let out a chuckle. "You're something else." He went to grab her arm to look at it, when he was pushed out of the way.
Toni sighed deeply as she started to struggle in his arms again. "Let go," she uttered, unable to break his grip.
Toni knew why he brought up Steve, as the super solder calmed her, but she didn't want him. Sure, she would always need him, but she didn't
Steve glanced up at Barton, studying his face. He stared at the archer, just stared, before he laughed. It was a pained laugh, though Steve wasn't sure anyone noticed. "You're still here?" he asked, trying to put on a face. "I thought you left." He put on a smile.
There were quite a few things that Steve didn't want to talk about with Rumlow, and Toni was one of them. He didn't forget what Toni told him before Christmas. She didn't trust the man, a man that Steve would admit that he knew very little about. Working with him regularly, he had told her he trusted the man, but was it really trust? He wasn't sure, but Rumlow didn't give him any reason not to. But Toni didn't trust him, and he wasn't going to force her. "Did we get it?" Steve asked, annoyed at Rumlow's comment. Couldn't they all take the hint? He just wanted other people to stop talking about her. Couldn't they just focus on the mission?
Steve and Tony’s argument had clearly been going on for a while if the number of coffee cups lying around Steve on the table was anything to go by. “It is NONE, I repeat none! Of Shield’s business who stays with me and who my friends are! He’s 17, he just needs a place to stay for a while.” Tony was getting agitated as the argument went on. When he woke up and found the shield sitting on the kitchen table, Tony nearly cried. He would never tell anyone though, but the moment he saw it just causally sitting in the carry case on the kitchen table as if it never left their flat. His best friend was home. And he was going to explain everything to Tony. He deserved that much.
Steve was fiddling with a patch of leather on the back of his hand that made the noise. He rolled his fingers again trying to find the source of the noise, he finally noticed the difference between the two gloves. The louder glove was slightly worn, the other a close match but fresher leather. Steve fiddled his nails under the patch of leather, the sound of Velcro peeling away. Steve quickly pulled open the panel. Sat in a small plastic flat pocket was a small photo of Peter and Steve. Steve studied the photo closely, frowning as to why Natasha would send a photo of his friend’s now dead son.
Steve quietly stopped laughing along with the pair, he forgot how rich Tony was sometimes, he didn’t need to struggle with bills or rubbish apartments, but he stayed with Steve, sat through broken heating in the dead of winter, not eating because they didn’t have decent money but if he wanted Tony could have bought and replaced the entire apartment block.
“Is it not birds-eye view?” Steve laughed at Natasha’s single raised eyebrows as if to stay, ‘what did I say?’ Clint laughed at little, “Naw man, back at the academy I was such a sharp shooter my couch said I had eyes like a hawk, therefore I was then known as Hawkeye!” Natasha even let out a muffled laugh, Steve was stretching forward to reach his ankles, laughing as he went, “What?! It’s a cool nickname! Alright, alright, laugh it up Mr Captain America, little gay porn actor don’t you think!? And you, Black widow, bit morbid don’t you think?” Natasha rolled her eyes, Steve shocked them both however, “Dude, don’t laugh, if this spy thing doesn’t work out, I don’t want my change of career to mean I need to change my business cards!” There was silence for 5 seconds before the trio let out the loudest laughs of the night, Natasha even fell back slightly in laughter whereas Clint had tears streaming down his frozen face.
Peter was slightly taller than he remembered, catching up with his own height. His hair was over grown and slightly wild curls dominated the top of his head, the hint of stubble that his son was even capable of growing a beard. Tony slid his arms up between the hug, taking Peter’s face in his hands, kissing his forehead, cheeks, nose and all over. Peter scrunched his face as the kisses connected. Peter took his Dad’s hands into his own. “Dad, Dad, Dad please stop!” He couldn’t make it through his words annoyed, chuckling out a watery laugh.
Steve was taken off guard by the kid, it was like he knew what he was thinking, literally just about to ask for a glass of water. He was going to keep a close eye on the kid. Who was smiling happily at him, he felt bad if this was the kid, he yelled at down the phone a couple of days. “So, Peter, how do you know Tony?”
Steve covered his face with his hands before making his way over to Tony. Tony had turned in a fit of childish rage. “What was that?!” Steve just raised his shoulders in a shrug trying not to giggle. “Call yourself Captain America with that throw!? Bullshit, I could do better! Come on now you owe me ice cream!” Steve just walked over to Tony, wrapping his arms over Tony’s shoulders in a hug. “Sorry T, come on DUM_EE’s had enough for today, let’s go back, I’ll bring you a blanket and Ice cream, how does that sound?”
Peter’s tears stopped. He made an unsteady move to get up, Steve moved faster, crossing his legs to jump up first, his hands hovering just off of Peter’s body. Peter stood up finally, dusting off his clothes, he stared Steve straight in the eyes. Steve almost took a step back with the intensity of the stare, he could see his own determination thrown right back at him, he was in Peter’s life, practically raise the boy, he could see it in the way the Peter stood, his arms tense by his side, shoulders back.
Steve stayed in place, for now, he needed to formulate a plan of escape, he started to focus in on the tapping that he could hear from the metal pipes next to him. The red pipes disappeared into the concrete floor, but they definitely were the source of the tapping. Steve shook his head slightly to break himself from the drowsiness. It was morse code, the distinct sound of tapping in the short and long patterns, It looking him a couple of minutes to focus enough to hear the message. - Cap. Wake. Up. Idiot.- Well, at least Clint seemed to be ok at the moment. Steve rolled his wrist and started his response. - Awake. You. OK?- Clint responded that he was fine. They need to break out and quick. They devised a plan to escape when the next guard rotated out from the hallway. Steve told Clint he’d be with him in 5 minutes. Before he could break his restraints, he heard the distinct clack of heels making their way towards his door.
It was then Peter realised that the arm of the shooter, was made entirely of metal. Right up to the shoulder bone. The shooter crushed the tracker between his fingers. He swung a punch across his chest towards Peter. Peter used his speed to continually dodge the fists. This infuriated the shooter as his face morphed into one of rage. Peter leaped over the shooter to gain some distance between them, but the shooter was quick and grabbed his ankle, lifting him and smashing him back into the ground.
Seconds later Tony was brought into the kitchen by Maria gripping his upper arm tightly, “Jarvis get the med kit. Howard broke the mirror.” Peter rushed to Tony’s side, trying to assess the situation, there was small shards of glass in his shoulder, Tony’s face showed nothing, he just stared off in the distance. “Peter go grab some clothes for Tony from his room.” Peter booked it towards the main stairs, where Howard sat with his hand in his hair, elbows sat on his knees. He looked up to Peter. Peter just sneered at him as he walked by him on the stairs, he could feel the anger throbbing through his veins.
Tony unlocked the battered front door as they headed inside, dumping the carrier bags with the ice cream on the kitchen table. Steve was laughing at Tony’s silly joke when he caught something out the corner of his eye. It was just a flash but certainly enough for Steve to turn and question what he saw. Peter’s spider sense went nuts the moment Steve began to turn. He still hadn’t gotten full control over the sensation of the spider sense, but he knew enough to turn and see if something was down the dark hallway. “What? Is it…” Tony asked but it was too late.
“Howard, I told you he’s not here! Leave Peggy alone, she is probably busy!” The footsteps were fast approaching, and Tony froze. Howard was coming, and Tony has nowhere to hind and nowhere to run. Peter’s body froze as well, He’d never met Howard died before he was even born, and he never heard a good word about the man from his dad.
Tony placed his hands into his suit trousers pockets, he sauntered over to the young man. Looking him up and down as he approached, well aware of his actions and more importantly, how the subject of his gaze would respond. Steve’s heart rate had increased, his jaw left open ever so slightly and eyes wide, glazed over as Tony approached him. A real living
“I met Tony because Cadet Rhodes was assigned to help me get around answers any questions, he was. Tony knew I was around because of Rhodes, so he walked in before his dad showed up once at our weekly dinner, he asked if I wanted to go eat like a real student, for whatever reason I said yes, ditched Howard, and Tony was just … he didn’t treat me like I was some 40s veteran, he actually called me stupid for believing Howard’s nonsense. We ate at this diner on campus. Became instant friends.” Steve got up, quickly grabbing three sleeping bags from the corner of the room and placing them in front of the fire to heat them up.
Peter woke up in his room, a broom handle poking his sides. “Peter, wake up, you need to get up now, Obi is coming over.” Peter grumbled, he rolled over on his other side. “Why, he doesn’t even like me, can’t you leave me to sleep like a normal person.” Tony let out a sharp laugh, “Normal people can’t fall asleep on the ceiling. But yeah normal average kid.” Peter’s eye shot open. Sat up, right angled to the floor. He stood up on the ceiling, placing his right hand in the grip position he lowered the rest of his body off of the ceiling, until he was the right way up and dropped gently to the floor. “Uh, sorry, I’m up now. Do I need to help tidy anything?” Tony laughed and turned to walk out the room, “Nope, just needed you off the ceiling in case he got nosey again. Steve usually just stands at the end of the hallway and keep him in the kitchen but he’s just nosey.”
He opened his eyes again and looked towards her, giving her a thankful smile and nod. She smiled back. “Are you alright Peter?” Peter nodded, shoving his hand into the pockets of his jacket. “You didn’t sleep, did you?” Peter nodded again, he couldn’t tell her, he came to that conclusion at about three am last night. “I’m the same, nowadays, whenever Tony and Howard are under the same roof, it rarely ends well. Just too similar and completely the opposite.”
Peggy gripped tightly onto the back of the suit. “I’m not happy Peggy, I need to make that clear, my kid is running around somewhere in the forests? Alone and likely depressed at his situation. This should not have happened but it's too late now. So, I’m going to go find him, right now and when we get back I want an official Shield apology for Peter and I want Tony here, he needs to see Peter off.” Before Steve could even let go, Agent Coulson ran over towards the pair, rushing down the stairs to meet them on the mid-level.
Peter dived back into the box, scrapping his hand along the bottom of the box he grabbed the last of the items inside, he pulled out a envelope with a letter inside and strip of photobooth photos. “Good work kiddo, That’s the photos we’re looking for, FRIDAY, Scan the images and print a copy for Steve’s wallet, would ya?” Tony called out to room, Steve took the original in his hand, admiring the young couple in the photos posing with silly faces, “This is the day your Dad and I finally got together, we were supposed to go to this concert off campus, … what was it for? Anyway ended up ditching it for the mall and dinner at Sally’s dinner on the corner.” Steve and Tony shared a moment almost teleported back to that very moment where a nervous Steve placed his then brittle friendship with Tony on the line for just one shot at what he wanted. Tony looked at Steve and smiled, that photo must be at least 20 years old now, hindsight is 20:20, but Tony knew it was meant to be, no matter what, it had always been Steve by his side, Rhodey-bear was a close 2
arm, his chest rapidly rising and falling, his gaze miles away. “Petey I need you here with me right now, I love you buddy, please listen to me.” He couldn’t break his view away from the assassin just incase he attacked while focused on Peter. Steve stepped forward, shield at the ready next to his future self. Focused solely on the Winter Soldier in front of him. Throwing his shield forward, the Soldier caught it in his outstretched hand. What he wasn’t expecting was the second shield catching him on his side, sending him flying sideways, landing face down in the dirt. Steve stepped forward carefully to collect his discarded shield.
“Steve they are wheeling out a prototype jet, i’m going to pull out with it and head towards the gate, the alarm sounded out as the large hanger door slowly opened. Steve rolled his neck and then held as still as possible. He closed his eyes, focusing on listening to Clint’s casual whistling as they drove out on the gravel road towards the guard check point. Steve let out a small gasp, which he quickly silenced, as the truck abruptly stopped at the checkpoint. Steve could only see the blue of the tarp covering him but he could hear Clint loud and clear. “Permission to take this junk material to the confidential waste facility.” Steve was pleasantly surprised at how impressive Clint’s Brooklyn accent was, sold the story. “Permission granted. Continue on.”
weapons!” He knew it could be a mistake, but he fronted up to Howard. Looking down at his once friend.
“Take that back. Your face says it all, you miss him, you want him back, but it scares you, you’ve got to send him home one day and you’re going to be all alone. Guess what dipshit? You have me, Clint, Rhodes, your family and god help if Steve knew you were alive, living like this! You’ve drunk at least a full bottle of whisky this morning, haven’t you?”
“Rogers?” Steve raised his eyebrows, mild shock and awe at this Tony, “yep, but no telling anyone, that’s between you, me, your minister and our witness.” Tony gave a cheeky wink when Steve rushed forward, wrapping Tony in a tight hug, he’d lost this, this was his only moments left with his dream,
Steve eye flew open at the slam of a car door. He slowly righted himself in the passenger seat, Clint opened the passenger door and stood leaning against the creaking door. “Rise and shine, I parked us just down the road of your apartment but we aren’t going anywhere near your apartment block in these uniforms.” Steve groaned to himself, slowly swinging his legs over the edge, to face out of the car. “Dude, give me fifty bucks and i’ll get us some civies.” Steve pulled apart the velcro around his neck, unzipping the panel down his chest, he reached into his inside pocket and pulled out his wallet. Flipping it open to find his bank cards, some dollars and his photo of his parents, before he was even born. They hadn’t been a perfect couple, his father was a drunk, WW1 soldier, who returned home shaken by what he saw, but back then it was just called Shell-shock. His mother a hardworking nurse, who had worked herself to her literal death.
coming home but it was getting late in the day and he was starting to get worried, worried enough that he’d been pacing the workshop. Tony adjusted his waist coat for the umpteenth time, Dum_Ee watched as Tony paced around his desk, checking the screen every passing for the call signal of
Peter final was able to get up and help with the clean-up team, he carried through the heavy wooden cheese boards as Tony helped clean up the wine glasses. Ana made the small clean-up team some hot chocolates for all their hard work and the fact that it was their unofficial Christmas. They chatted in the kitchen for a while before Ana started to yawn, making sure everything was locked up for the night. As Peter made his way up to his room, and into his bed, he lay awake through the night, debating to himself whether to tell Tony what was about happen.
Tony sat on the end of the bed, drunk off his ass, lying down in his best friend’s bedroom. What was his life at this point? He’s a millionaire business owner, could have everything he ever wants but he’s here, lost in Steve’s room. Tony looked over onto the bed side table, Steve’s navy sketch book sat proudly under the light. Tony leaned over on his side and took the book carefully in his hands. Sitting back up, he sat it on his knees. He flipped the front cover open and sucked in a breath. A sketch of Sarah Rogers, in her kitchen in Brooklyn, happily working over the hot stove, Steve’s perspective, slightly lower to ground, from a time long gone.
"It-" Loud music started to play. "-is what I said," Clint finished, turning to the door. "What the hell? Is she going to have ear drums after tonight?"
Toni cursed. He would be in a playful mood, while she was having a heart attack. God, was she dying? "Hey, now, don't blame your lazy ass on me." She elbowed him in his shin.
Phillips nodded and said, "Agent Carter is correct. Say your goodbyes." He gave Toni a look, which she knew would be the only real good bye she would get from him. He may not have liked or trust her to begin with, but she knew she had grown on him. Even after that blunder of sedating her, he had grown on her. "I'll say one thing, Stark," Phillips started, "I prefer you over your father, but it will be peaceful without you."
"You aren't going to stop asking, are you?" Steve asked. He leaned back and stared up at the blue ceiling, which was outlined in dark wood accents. It had a warm feeling.
Tony had thought waking up alone would be a onetime thing, but when it happens for an entire week, Tony gives up on sleeping in his room. For the first three days of that week, the soldiers did go to bed with him, but when the genius awoke the next morning, he was alone. Completely alone. Afterwards, they didn't even attempt to go to bed with him, which did nothing for Tony's nerves and insecurities. They don't even tell him good night when they pass him in the halls as they seem focused something else, and Tony feels like he's suddenly thrown aside like yesterday's trash, which sends him rushing to his lab, the only place he feels comfortable.
dead, and there was no doubt about that. Sure, they never found a body—not that they would find a body; however, there was no way he would have survived, and if he did, he would be at least 90 years old. Unlike the Cap, Bucky wasn't a super solder and couldn't be a Popsicle. He wouldn't be able to survive those extremes like Steve, even if Toni wished he could.
Toni squeezed her eyes shut and forced herself to take a deep breath. She knew she was completely exhausted but she needed to found some hidden energy. She needed to figure out what was going on and how to get out of here. "F-fuck," she cursed as her head fell to the side. She groaned lightly, grateful that the sun was no longer directly in her eyes.
Besides, the best place to rest is in his lab, where he can be left alone to his own devices. It's where he can be alone—No, he isn't hiding. He's Tony Stark, and he doesn't hide. He faces his fear, but the lab is just where he can think, where he doesn't have to lie. It's where he can be his truth self, where he isn't judge. It's his nest. His home. So who cares if it is his safe net, the place he goes to when he's hurting? Who cares if he spends hours in the lab? Who the hell cares? It's where he feels like
"Be careful and stop trying to enlist," he stated as he watched Steve put his old faithful coat back on.
Unable to control herself, she opened her mouth. "Repeating your promise won't help! That's what all of the bad guys say before they kill you." She glared before turning to Zola who was staring at the ground. How dare he not look at her when she was held hostage? If he was going to do this, he was going to look at her.
Steve glanced at the Suit as it closed and stepped back from Toni. "Finished early," he said, looking back to Toni. He watched her as she shifted to her right side, looking like she didn't want to put any weight on her left. He eyed the leg for a second, before he glanced up at her. She looked like he imagined she looked, but this vision was shivering.
Her stomach had been growling, and she knew she should eat, but she kept telling it to be quiet. She didn't want to go up there. Why couldn't Pepper bring it down? She was forcing her to leave her lab, when she knew Toni didn't want to. She was evil. Toni didn't know who was upstairs, but there was a lecture waiting for her. Her team loved to lecture her, well besides Barton who just laughed at her.
, she told herself. For the time, it was highly advance and there was no safer plane; however, she still did not like it. The only aircrafts she trusted were her own as none could compare.
Trying get over her fear, Toni gave him a confused look as she pulled the suit jacket tighter. "So do you want me to talk? Or not? Geez, Rogers. Make up your mind."
He eyed her. "I heard you didn't like me. Can I ask why?" He paused as she didn't answer him. After a long silence, he spoke, "I'll change that as no one can hate this smile."
"I…" she started with a deep sigh, as she turned to the door. "I don't know if I can answer handle questions right now." It wasn't a complete lie, because she wasn't really yet to talk about what happened. It was all so raw in her head. "Not all at once. I don't know if I can answer them." She didn't know if she wanted to answer them.
"What?" Clint says, innocently, as he puts on a goofy smile. "Just wait until Barnes see Stark cuddling with
The Professor, on the other hand, looked completely annoyed, though it looked like there was a hint of enjoyment under it. Even with his irritation, it was hard to take the man seriously as he was covered in rainbow paint from head to toe, much like the rest of the students and the classroom. "That was quite the show, Miss Stark."
Finding themselves in Sam's guest room, Steve wasn't sure what to tell Natasha, not that he was in the right mindset. Like her, his mind was all over the place, and he could not make heads or tails out of anything, not that he could focus on anything. Zola's words kept replaying in his head like a track on repeat: "Stark's New role." It felt like someone had punched him
Toni was unable to finish as Steve cut her off with a kiss. This kiss was deeper than the last, and it stole her breath, which shouldn't be allowed. He shouldn't be allowed to do with to her, leave her speechless. It wasn't fair. It wasn't fair at all.
Shaking his head, he focused on the letter that he had write. She deserved that much; her father deserved it was well, but he was unsure of how he would give it to Howard Stark. He didn't, however, have time to think about it as Steve Rogers busted into his tent.
With one goal and task in mind, he headed in the run-down mansion gun at the ready, and no matter what stood in his way, he would find Toni, the woman who haunted him for so many years. He may not remember much of his past or his last mission, but this woman stuck out to him. No matter what his handlers did or the pain they caused, she had wormed her way in, and he was unable to rid himself of her, not that he put up a fight. Besides her being a source of comfort, he was curious to why there was such a strong attachment to her.
She totally did not like the way he was looking at her. It looked like he wanted to eat her. Shaking her head, she turned to Zola, who looked like he was about to crap his pants. Toni could probably yell boo and he would jump; how did that man last long with Schmidt, who looked like he was ready kill at any second? That was the issue with bad guys, you never knew when (not if) they would kill you. She kind of felt sorry, just kind of since they were holding her against her will and all.
Pepper let out a sigh as she turned to Rhodes. To her surprise, he hadn't entered the room alone, but to her dismay, it wasn't with a certain Brunette. "I thought you were looking for Toni," she said, her tone was anything but warm.
Pierce was smiling again as he stepped toward the Asset, who was staring at them. "Well, we have the perfect tool for that. We have a ghost."
With a deep breath, she forced the scream down her throat as she attempted to get out of the car. Yes, attempted. Her body was barely listening to her. It felt like she was trying to move an elephant who weighted a ton. Granted, the seat belt wasn't helping either. The buckle was completely destroyed, making it impossible to unclick. For a second, she wished she had the foresight to unbuckle before almost killing herself, but that only last a second when she noticed the shattered windshield. There was no doubt that she would have flew out of car and died by a tree branch through the heart if she. She doubted that was as fun as it sounded.
"He gave Fury some long stupid reason," She answered. "It doesn't matter why. It doesn't change the fact that he couldn't, which means we need that device to work, Banner."
"No!" Steve yelled. "Just stay away from her." He didn't know why, but he didn't like Barnes saying that.
Toni heard Peggy shift on her cot and judging from the sound, Peggy had laid down. "Can't we girls look out for each other?"
Rounding a corner, she saw Colonel Salty speaking with Howard Stark, and she froze, unable to motivate herself to move. Howard, who looked different from what she remembered, appeared to be healthy and happy, which Toni couldn't remember in her time with him. He hardly showed a smile, and the last time she saw him, he looked worried and tired about something that Toni wasn't aware of. He didn't speak to her about his troubles.
"Cut the bull," Toni snapped, interrupting him. She glared at him before staring at the ceiling. "I am
Peggy had seen the wires and heard what he had stated before but she didn't think it was that bad. "Violently?"
After a sigh, Steve hated how she hid before her jokes. Why couldn't she be honest with someone? Was she was honest with anyone, like Ms. Potts or Colonel Rhodes? He hadn't had the pleasure of meeting them, but he had heard they were close. He wasn't sure how close Rhodes was to Toni, but he told himself he wasn't going be jealous of nothing.
Steve didn't bother to reply as he gazed down at Toni. He was unable to stop the smile on his face as he stared at her. He really did think he was luckiest person in the world.
Toni smacked hard against the ground, and this time, she wasn't able to push herself up. In fact, she couldn't feel her body. Did she even have a body? She couldn't even tell if she was breathing and that should've scared her if she had truly understood what was going on. Her mind, which hadn't been at an hundred percent for a while, had drifted into the smoke, and there was no down or up anymore.
Tony doesn't know how he's supposed to feel about the coldness in those words or in his body, but he drifts out before he has to think about it.
Oh, look, there are the questions that he doesn't want. "Too much chatter. Let's shut up and get to work. We don't have time for this," he says as neutral as he can. However, his bitterness is clear in his voice, and it shuts the team up almost immediately. He knows they're completely blindsided by his tones, but he cannot allow himself to care. He's on a mission. "I'll clear the building. You stop those droids."
Toni took a few deep breaths as she tried to calm herself. She was useless when she was like this, and she usually did very stupid things like going out into the woods alone. She may have been imagining things, but her stalker was back and he was after her again. She should tell someone, but if she did that, she wouldn't be able to find out what he wanted or who he was; plus, she wouldn't have another second to herself as Barnes and Rogers would never leave her side. Or she would be stuck in some lab with her father as if she was something that needed to be protected. She didn't need to be protected; she could protect herself.
