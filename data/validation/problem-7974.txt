As if agreeing with him, Julia waved her arms and feet in the air. Bucky had to rock her gently to soothe her. Tony made a mental note to have JARVIS upload some more of Juliana’s pictures into Thor’s phone so he had a lot to show the Asgardians.
After breakfast, and once Juliana was burped and her diaper changed again, Tony grabbed the baby bag and led his little family to the elevator. Happy was waiting at the garage, ready to go. Ever since they brought Juliana home, members of the press started camping out at the base of the Tower, viciously trying to get a glimpse of the new member of the Stark-Rogers household. Pepper said Tony couldn’t sue them, not yet and without provocation, but she had already sent out a strongly-worded warning to anyone who would even attempt to accost the Avengers or get close to the baby without invitation.
“I’ll be fine,” Rhodey said. “I’ll be meeting up with an escort team and we’ll be taking a detour.” He waved a hand, the term Classified obvious in his tone.
That seemed to wake Bucky right up. He looked at the frame in his hand. In his arms, Juliana let out a giggle, cheek pressed to Bucky’s chest. He was probably still warm from sleep. Bucky’s eyes widened slowly as he looked at the picture.
Bucky scowled at him. “Just because I don’t want my face or my ass splashed all over the news like a certain douchebag–”
“Of course, Captain,” came the prompt reply.
Steve groaned. Aww, hell.
“I have not yet had the pleasure of attending a Midgardian ceremony,” Thor said. “But the first nuptials I have ever witnessed were between Ancora, one of my Mother's trusted knights, and Illora, her childhood sweetheart. The celebration lasted five moons. I got most drunk.” He added proudly.
Tony proposed the idea of a monthly baby photo book to Steve a month before Gail Antera, their birth mother, was due to give birth.
Tony rolled his eyes. “No thanks, Darcy-darling. And we have our kid with us, you trumpet waffle.”
“Oh, don’t worry,” Peter said, shrugging. “This is nothing.”
“I know.” Bucky nodded sagely. “They’re so gross and old, right?”
, by the way.
down at the workshop, or leave her upstairs and then slap each other
Steve nodded, satisfied as baby and Bucky regarded one another. “I still need to feed Tony–”
But the room was neat and orderly – most likely by Pepper’s hands and JARVIS’s guidance – and the three bots in question were by their charging station. They weren’t charging though and even Tony could see the subtle vibrations of sheer excitement going through them.
As the conversation seemed to be dissolving into some awkward silence and staring between their son and this rather interesting young gamer, Tony stepped up.
“Oh, good. That’s one of my favorite things to do.” Tony grinned dopily. “So, are you here to kidnap my baby again? If you wake her up, she’ll scream at you, or who knows, maybe Reason #34 applies to you too.”
“Hm?” Wade looked up. He had already grabbed a cup of coffee for himself. “Sorry about what?”
“What Clint said was actually quite accurate,” Bruce commented. “Newborns have yet to build on their perspective of the world, so even the littlest thing has to be quite overwhelming and confusing for them, and the only means they have by which to express themselves is to cry. There’s no science to figuring out their crying. It could literally be about anything.”
If looks could kill, Tony would have disintegrated into ashes by now.
talked to the bots. He even included JARVIS, even though JARVIS was
“Tony, you are going to clean all that,” he said. “And don’t say you’re going to leave it to the… roombas…”
There were beeps and tire squeals all around as DUM-E, U and Butterfingers immediately reared up and wheeled their way. Before Tony could warn them though, the three stopped a good distance away. DUM-E started going around in circles, like a dog chasing its tail. U was waving a video camera in his claw (where did he get that?). Butterfingers was waving his arm up and down vigorously. They were so excited.
“Will we be seeing the photo you picked?” Phil asked. Bruce approached him, attempting to hand over Juliana, but the agent ignored him. Natasha immediately shook her head when he turned to her.
Everyone dispersed and Thor and Natasha headed for the sink as it was their turn on dish duty.
Tony wiped away the crumbs from his beard. “Two months ago I got the bots ready. Last month, Pepper got everything ready. It’s your turn, muffin. Go and figure out what you want with the other nonagenarian.”
The check-up was fairly routine. They took off Juliana’s cute onesie, leaving her in just her diapers, and Dr. Axel measured her height and weight and the circumference of her head. He took her temperature and checked her ears and eyes. Juliana seemed fine with it, letting herself be moved about as she watched her hands and Dr. Pius’ bright, bald head. Or maybe that was just Tony.
Bruce blinked. “Her… her photo book?”
Steve felt pride bloom in his chest at the absolute look of delight and pride on Peter’s face.
“Icky shots.” Clint rubbed Juliana’s head. “She’s going to have a hell of a time. Poor baby.”
“You’re a gem, babe.” Tony reached for the baby and swiped his thumb across her chin. “And oh my love, you’re making a mess.”
And it wasn’t like Tony didn’t trust his bots. He did. Of course, he did. With his life. Had trusted them numerous times. JARVIS too. But this was different. Tony’s workshop was already a hazard zone on
Later that night, Tony finally got his groove back and expressed his appreciation for his husband’s idea in very creative, sweaty, wonderful ways.
In contrast, the holidays certainly had a positive effect on Tony. Steve knew how much cause his darling husband had more than most to despise this particular holiday, an occasion he had never really celebrated were it not for the kindness of his late-and-much-loved butler. Not to mention a time when he had lost both parents to that devastating car accident. But you wouldn’t know it with how completely and utterly Tony devoted himself to Christmas.
isn’t around.” She ignored Clint’s shout of indignation and smiled at Julia, held the baby over her head, and started making airplane noises. Julia giggled with delight and waved her arms and legs.
“Tony,” he whispered and elbowed him as Gail grinned at them.
“DUM-E, don’t get too excited, okay?” Tony said, leading them slowly towards the couch. He ignored Steve’s amused huff. “We talked about this. You’re the oldest, so you need to set a good example for U and Butterfingers.”
Peter waved at where his parents drove off to.
“Bucky will pack all the aprons,” Clint said, earning an eye-roll from the man.
“SHIELD is going to hold off on giving you field missions, unless said missions are a Level 7, require the intervention of the Avengers, or are close enough to the city and require immediate intervention.” He grinned wryly. “Director Fury and Agent Hill aren’t going to stop pestering you from taking missions though, but you can decline or accept within reason. I have the approval Director Fury signed months ago.”
“And you told Rhodey?” he asked.
“They said it could be quite cathartic,” Phil commented lightly. “The fact that it is usually taboo adds to the thrill.”
Julia made a face and pursed her lips, letting out a raspberry. Her eyes lit up and she turned to Steve with a huge laugh.
Steve waved his phone. “Gail really can’t make it. Turns out she has an emergency and has to leave for Augsburg,” his brow furrowed, “Wherever that is.”
After what happened in Greece, Peter had been spirited away by his parents and SHIELD, so he wasn’t able to say goodbye to Wade and all the other scholars, and then he spent all of yesterday in recovery. He woke up this morning to a ton of Wade’s texts and had actually been thinking about what to say in between soldering his new web shooter.
Thor had been overjoyed when he came. Apparently the all-seeing eye of Heimdall had informed Thor of the moment Juliana was born and had been helping Thor complete his duties as quickly as possible. Even the good Queen Frigga had hastened to get a few presents ready. Thor was incredibly saddened to have missed Juliana’s first weeks, but he made up for it with the bulging sacks of gifts he had with him.
“I ran into him today.” He could barely make out the sharp intake of breath on the other end. “I am okay, Pep. Nothing bad happened. A hello and a goodbye. He mentioned you were coming back in June to stay with him and Bucky.” She scoffed.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s always been fond of the way Pepper would take the lead on press related things. The relationship she had established with Natasha before the group went their separate ways certainly helped. “I’m going to need you to lead the crowd.”
He blinks at his phone. His sight is a bit blurred at the edges with sleep from his decompression nap.
“We have got to stop meeting like this.” The blonde’s smile was just as blinding as he remembered. Possibly even more so.
He waited for her to say something. Anything. “Pep?” “You’re joking.” He frowned. “Pep, you’re outstanding. I have no reason to joke about this. Whenever you’re ready, say yes and I’ll hold the position until you get here.” She laughed causing Tony to relax. “Don’t act like you didn’t open position especially for me. Of course I’m saying yes!” He fought the urge to fist pump the air settling with a high five from Jarvis who was still listening to the conversation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Realizations rarely come the moment they should.
All he needs to do is announce his presence, it wouldn’t be hard. Yet, something in the tone of Pepper’s voice as she takes the offered drink in Jarvis’ hand makes him pause. “I wanted to thank you. He’s clearly doing a lot better.” The fabric of the sofa cover rustles as the other man gets situated.
They’ve had a full day to prep, he’s had a full day to let the gravity of the situation settle into his bones. If his anxiety at the sheer volume of reporters that found their way to see him were radioactive, his chest would be glowing through his suit. It’s something that needs to be done though.
He should be making eye contact. Really. It would be too difficult to maintain. Too easy to decide it’s not worth continuing. “You misunderstood –“ It was the strained laugh that does him in.
Taking one more look at the overcast sky Tony adjusted his coat collar to cover his ears and continued across the street toward a familiar building. He did not need to be a Stark to be known here, not with it being the only place to buy a fresh brew with a kick worthy of his constant all-night sessions in the workshop. In addition to feeding into his habit it was a safe space where he didn’t have to worry about paparazzi taking his picture or being bombarded by people wondering where he had been. He needed this place as much as he needed his friends at home.
“Is that really how you answer the phone now?” He laughed. “It’s nice to hear your voice too, Pep. I’m guessing Steve gave you my number?” Jarvis looked up from his own tablet in interest.
He didn’t recognize the number but his security system made it hard to imagine he didn’t know the person on the other side of the line. “Stark on the line.” A familiar laugh followed.
He’s suddenly realized that the feelings of judgement he had so long ago from his friends had never been aimed towards him. Now he has to consider that his ex-boyfriend could potentially be using him for press despite having been in a serious relationship since they broke up. Pepper sighs and sits on the arm of his chair, leaning into him.
This is the longest he’s made it without making headlines. With the Stark name, the streak was bound to break eventually. On his desk there lays a magazine, it’s cover screaming “Playboy Play Date: Stark Industries’ CEO Back to Breaking Hearts” in large bold letters that frame a grainy shot of Tony in the middle of pulling his harm out of a distraught looking Steve’s grasp.
He should be shocked. Maybe angry.
He laughs when the statement sinks in. “Well then fuck yeah, let’s do it.” Jarvis nods before tossing him his phone with Banner’s number already dialed.
It’s a promise to his closest friends, to himself, to the people still trying to process what he’s admitted to. “Thank you. That is all.” He could say more but it’s dawned on him that there is so much more he could do. He laughs as the cameras begin to catch up to the moment.
It appeases their guest enough to get her comfortable. “I want access.” It’s his turn to sweeten the pot. “Invitations, including plus ones, to all future Stark Industries events. No press badge needed.” She glances over in his directions, having forgotten he was there, and grins. “You’ve got yourself a deal.”
Stepping in as their glasses clink together he knows he doesn’t need anyone else in his life but the people in this room.
Through the ringing in his ears he hears Pepper and Jarvis doing their absolute best to speak in hushed tones. It doesn’t matter to him whether they’re yelling or now using sign language. He just wants the tightness in his chest to go away.
“I hoped that you would listen. Bucky, wasn’t excited to see the last cover and I am inclined to do something about it. That doesn’t mean I don’t want you in my life again, Tony.”
“My number hasn’t changed. Tell her to give me a call. I miss her.” He was expecting the look that followed. That look of shock people who knew him before gave him when he expressed his feelings. It still made him uncomfortable though. “Listen, I know it’s only been a few minutes but I should go.”
“We would like to offer you a position on the Award’s Committee.” Bruce blinked in a way that somehow told you he was touched. Once again, the only sign of any emotion was that small smile. “I would be honored.”
“You invited me.” Smooth. Make him think all he has to do is ask…just like before.
If you have any questions or comment, let me know!
“The press follows you.” It comes out patronizing – how had he never noticed the righteous air that Steve gave off…
“The public remembers Steve. They remember you with Steve. James…he’s secure in his own right. I’m more worried about how Steve is going to handle this.” How could he have ever mistaken those feelings as anger towards him, as frustration towards him. “You think this is what he wanted.” He has to choke out the words.
It was nice to think about them instead of everything else the world had to offer. Enough to distract him from the things that could make his anxiety go up. Like a certain someone knocking on the window pane while he was clearly distracted.
“You haven’t been in the public eye for almost a full year. For the most part the paparazzi have left you alone. Why would that trend stop the moment you start running into him again?” His body relaxes into her warmth, his mind continuing to run in circles. “This isn’t a conspiracy, Pep.”
“Tony, given all that you have been through, what do you think it means that hiding is no longer your first instinct?”
He fights the urge to gawk. “You’ve always known that.” He shakes his head to stave off his growing frustration at the mess his feelings are making his thought process. “And, again, you invited me. So, please, explain how exposing yourself to my public persona is preventing misunderstandings in your relationship.”
Tony felt tears threatening to spill but cleared his throat and shifted again. “I miss her.” He couldn’t look at Dr. Banner. They both knew that, even though to anyone else it sounded like he was avoiding the question, he was about to make a breakthrough.
“You know, when you didn’t say anything after I asked for a penthouse sweet on the strip I thought I had found your limit. Now I see that you were just stuck in that brilliant head of yours.” She hadn’t change a bit. Looking up at her through the rolled down driver’s side window he could remember exactly why he had thought she was the most beautiful creature on the planet all those years ago.
“You missed her.” He glanced in his direction. “You didn’t?” Jarvis pressed himself into the cushions and stretched his legs out onto the coffee table taking his time to formulate a response. “I think it’s a good step. You’ll have to tell her everything. If she’s going to be Tony Stark’s personal assistant she needs to know that you aren’t the man who dated her brother anymore.”
He finds Nat’s eyes glittering with mischief as she stands. “I hate to burst The Bugle’s bubble, but Steve Rogers has been irrelevant since we first noticed Stark had gone MIA without him.” The first reporter flushes as others around her nod in agreement. Nat continues, “Mr. Stark, we know that you have been removed from both the public and your business for a little under half a year. The first headline since your return alludes that you are the same person you have always been.”
“No. I don’t think I did.”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y, dial Pepper.”
Tony leaned back into the chair he was seated in. Of course Jarvis had updated Banner. There was never any way around that.
There is a new feeling that washes over Tony in that moment as he watches his inner most circle celebrate their new endeavor. It’s cool like being submerged in pool water during a heat wave. He knows what it is because the voices in his head stay silent and let him enjoy the moment.
He focuses on the firmness of her hand in order to finish the speech he had spent the night working on. “I have learned a lot in my time away and I hope that I continue to learn as time goes on. I make no promises to future public appearances or to making a habit of making my relationships as public as they used to be. My focus now, is to make this company the best possible version of itself while maintaining my sanity.”
There was a hand on his forearm, the grip tight. This was definitely not something he wanted. “Tony.” He couldn’t breathe at the pained sound that was his ex’s voice. “Let. Go.”
It’s there in Steve’s eyes, in the way his jaw is subtly clenched and in the way he’s radiating tensions Tony can’t believe he was able to ignore for years.
It was too late though. All he could do now was breathe and acknowledge that leaving at all, once he felt uncomfortable, was a win in and of itself.
These last two chapters ended up being a lot shorter than I imagined especially given the time it took to post them. I appreciate you all for reading and apologize only for being unable to translate what my mind created properly into text.
(See the end of the chapter for
I apologize for the length but I would really rather just give you what you need for the story to make sense instead of details that mean nothing to me or the characters.
Tony’s lips twitched with the suppression of a smile at Steve’s awkwardness. “Sure.” Nervous laughter eased the tension after a short moment of silence. “You look good, Steve. How’s Pepper doing? I heard she’s coming back home soon.”
Steve watched them, transfixed at his best friend and his daughter.  He was broken from his musing when Natasha elbowed him gently. She gave him a small smile and wiggled the phone she sneakily had in one hand.
“And Tony,” Steve added. There was a loud yelp of outrage from around the corner and Da walked in, glaring at Pops.
“I always wanna feel you up, darling, you know that,” Tony leered. “And I won’t touch… much, but I’m lying, obviously, so come on. Let’s get the armor off you.”
She was more than Tony’s family. She had also become Steve’s. And god knew she’d do anything for Julia too.
“Same here, except I had Rhodey,” Tony said, chuckling.
JARVIS: “You have allowed DUM-E and U to use their own props, Sir. I don’t see why I cannot also decide for my own.”
“You’ll get your turn, DUM-E, U. Don’t jostle the baby,” JARVIS said. Tony knew his AI could just easily communicate to them through the network, but it was also most likely a way to show Steve and Tony that he was on the job.
Juliana smacked her lips and let her tongue out.
Tony wiped away the crumbs from his beard. “Two months ago I got the bots ready. Last month, Pepper got everything ready. It’s your turn, muffin. Go and figure out what you want with the other nonagenarian.”
Steve smiled and agreed at everything he heard. “Yeah, I think that would be really nice. Wade seems like a good apple. And we should really thank Stark E-Games Division for helping a lot of these at-risk young people.” He shrugged. “I don’t know a lot about gaming, but maybe we could help them out with more of their projects.”
Had Tony mentioned how much he loved this perfect,
“NO!” Bruce jolted, strong enough to surprise them all. He coughed, fiddling with his glasses. “No! I… I want it! I… I want…” He trailed off, flustered at their looks and Tony’s smug grin.
“Eww, keep it in the bedroom, you guys,” Clint whined walking in from the hall.
Juliana immediately started crying and Tony hovered beside Steve’s seat, nervously flapping his hands.
“I had to,” Tony protested. “How else was he going to get out of the evil clutches of the Air Force?”
“H-Hi.” Peter waved awkwardly. “I’ve been such a big fan ever since I heard that you use the proceeds of your wins to set up CEGA and Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children, and when you won the E-League two years ago against Ajax.”
Steve secretly thought Rhodey was enjoying it, for a myriad of reasons. For one thing, Rhodey had both Tony and Julia mostly to himself. Steve knew how much the Colonel missed his best friend and vice versa and they’d never been shy about expressing their affection for one another. But now that Tony was a father and that Rhodey was named godfather, he wanted time to get to know the baby too. Second, Rhodey liked needling and annoying Tony. Case in point: according to the billionaire’s rants, the photos looked terrible because Rhodey was not ‘catching the light’ or something and kept getting his arm in the way.
" which is the first story in the series.
“Here, baby, let’s have Auntie Pep, okay, darling?”
Natasha caught that. “Height? Did you say their height?”
Tony flapped his hands in the air, demanding attention, as always. “Speaking of five months, concentrate, Steven. Stop going off topic.”
Clint smirked. “Hey, if you don’t want that slot, Doc, I’m taking it.”
“We were in there for almost an hour?” Tony gaped.
“Ms. Potts! Mr. Stark-Rogers!”
“Germany,” Tony answered automatically. “She okay?”
Steve smiled down at his plate. “Well, mine is–”
trip, meaning you two are
Peter remained focused on the trip though, because it really was a good opportunity. Greece was so picturesque and inspiring, with good food and so much history, art and beauty.
The next two days, Da and Pops were as good as gold. They still called twice a day and texted about a hundred times a day, but Peter never saw them around. They were still in Greece though, as evidenced from the photos they sent the family chat.
“Peter,” Pops spoke up. “Honestly, maybe our decision to come to Greece has something to do with you also being here with the other SI Scholars. But this is already your third day, so we were never really going to bother you. As you said, we didn’t even tell you where we were.”
There was a pause and Steve immediately turned to his husband. “Tony! You told Rhodey there was an emergency?”
Tony just smacked him on the ass, placed a kiss on his cheek, and then threw himself on the bed, making a mess of all the folded underwear.
After Steve approved access, Tony would head into the bay, dismantle the weapon, and meet Steve and Clint back in the shuttle.
He follows the alien – and he should have asked for their name, he realizes, far too late – up a steep incline and through a large field of tall, un-chopped, orange grass. It is beautiful, Tony catalogues silently, as if the sun had melted.
Clint grinned and dropped down beside Bucky. “She said baboon. Close enough,” he teased, leaning back to avoid Bucky’s lazy swipe at him. Bucky seemed too tired to engage in a fight though and settled back down, and Clint placed a hand between his shoulder blades.
“Go away, Agent,” Tony called, flapping a hand. “We’re having a photoshoot here. Your glower is casting a bleak light on everything.” He had his phone upside down and Rhodey had devolved from playing peek-a-boo to making animal sounds. Juliana was attempting to copy him by shrieking nonsensically at each word.
“Okay, thank you,” Steve said. “And those nicknames are going to get old, you know.”
Pops was still eating, so Da put down his cup of coffee and peered at him over his glasses.
Their peace and quiet was broken when a proximity alert appeared on the TV, sending everyone into motion. Clint was crouching on nimble feet in an instant, a squirming Juliana held protectively to his chest. Natasha was already heading for the windows, gun in hand, and Thor and Bruce came barreling in from the kitchen with messy aprons.
Because Da’s harem pants had a revealing slit right up the upper thigh.
“No, you can’t see the cameras in our room. Let us get her to sleep first, okay?” Tony answered. “Jay, bring up the baby pics and videos from my phone. They can watch that for now.”
[Image 8: Tony and Steve are standing on the balcony. Steve is carrying Juliana and Tony is pointing something out to them. Julia had one hand on Steve’s shirt and another around Tony’s collar.]
[Image 5: Bruce is on the balcony, cradling Julia in his arms as they watched the parade together.]
“Where to, Captain?” JARVIS asked.
baby of their own.
Tony turned to her with a wink. “That will be all, Miss Potts. Thank you.”
“I like this one,” Natasha spoke up, pointing over Bruce's shoulder. “First thing you notice about a person?”
“Yes, sir,” JARVIS replied.
…who remembered once again that he was in love with the craziest and most amazing man in the world and that they were going to have a daughter, so they ended up just clinging to one another and crying.
He was a weak, weak man, so sue him.
As Juliana’s third month dawned, Steve and Tony were relieved that she started sleeping just a little longer through the night. It was still a bit touch and go on just what time Juliana wanted to sleep, but she slept somewhere between five and seven hours, which was certainly a lot more than her parents usually got considering Tony’s habit of not-sleeping and Steve not needing as much sleep. They were slowly trying to get her into a set sleep schedule, and while they weren’t always successful, they were trying.
(Tony added a few diaper bags to the baby line Stark Industries was planning to release. Steve saw there were even a few Avengers-themed ones, but none looked anything like their customized family set, so that was good.)
“I’m not sure, which is why you should go ahead, call her up, and ask her why.” Tony poked Steve on the sternum.
“Just like your baby blues, pecan pie.” Tony turned to Steve, kissing his cheek. Steve looked quietly pleased at that.
Steve turned back to Phil. “Anyway, we’ve got the paediatrician in an hour and we’re not sure how long that’ll take and how Julia will feel after. We’ll be home straight after since Tony has a meeting with Pepper and we all have–”
Steve shook his head and Tony felt a little saddened to hear that. While Gail, the birth mother, was delightful, amazing, and still very much a part of their lives and the baby’s, she was a busy woman.
They sat there feeling a little contemplative and nostalgic, and Steve looked at his and Tony’s pictures side-by-side.
Clint grinned and tossed himself on the couch with a big bag of pretzels. Darcy settled on the floor close to Julia’s play mat. The presence of new people caught Julia’s attention and Darcy waved at her, grinning when the baby started pumping her legs up and down in excitement. Steve let her down on the floor gently.
“Yeah, make sure she gets some,” Steve said. “But she likes being held so if you put her on your stomach or chest, she’s less likely to complain.”
“Yeah, whatever, punk,” came the soft, muffled reply. Bucky turned back to his room, already cooing down at the little sunshine in his arms, so gentle and sweet in a way he himself probably never thought he could be again.
“–wait! No! Never mind!” Clint suddenly piped up, making a face. “You don’t have to answer. You’re just going to answer something sappy and no doubt related to Stark.”
Anyway, out of all the things on Julia’s Calendar, one moment that Steve remembered with such fondness was the first time Julia met her brothers the day they took her home from the hospital.
Steve smiled and pulled Tony close, tucking the other man under his arm and wrapping them both in his blanket. “You’re being a wonderful Da, sweetheart.”
“Tony!” Bruce huffed.
All of her conditions were doable, though Tony had to be consistently told off on splurging on everything his baby’s mama could want, and Steve had to hold back from punching the doctor that reminded them that they weren’t allowed into the delivery room.
Happy waved away the chair Phil pointed at. “Thanks, but Pep and I grabbed breakfast on the way. I’m actually just here to pick up Julia.” He winced when Julia let out another cry. “That doesn’t sound good though. What’s up with the little darling?”
So after Rhodey and Juliana got their picture taken and it had circulated online promptly – and Tony was punished by Steve, Pepper and Phil for the stunt he pulled (though their ideas of *ahem* punishment differed greatly) – there started a weird tension around the tower.
“Not everything,” Steve said. “They can go up one at a time.” He cooed at Juliana. “Oh no, my darling. Calm down. We’ll probably need to burp you or change you. And then get you to bed.”
“Love you too.”
Tony sighed. “Steve, baby, I really think it’s better as a surprise, and if we send it out, the tension of waiting is going to be even more unbearable.” When Steve couldn’t help but pout, Tony leaned over to kiss his cheek. “But fine, fine, we can just sort of tell them, dumpling. I’ll handle it.”
“We can come up with a thousand reasons why we don’t want her to, but considering our personal choices, it would be hypocritical to tell our child she can’t do the same thing we are,” he said. “So it’s not as if we don’t want her to, but our kneejerk reaction is that we don’t want this for her – the danger, the sacrifices, the secrets…” He trailed off and watched Julia trying to grab Clint’s nose like it was a game, “If the world was kind, by the time Julia grows up, our jobs as superheroes would be obsolete.”
“And you’re her mother.” Steve smiled. “You’re family. To both of us, too.”
“Who?” Steve asked. “Who is it, Tony? JARVIS?”
down at the workshop.
“I beg to differ,” Clint scoffed. “Juju-bean is the cutest, which is probably something she got from Gail because there’s nothing at all cute about old man Stark and older man Rogers.”
Tony gave him the stink eye. “You’re heartless, you know that, doc.”
Tony yelped. “Belay that, Jay!”
Bucky scowled at him and handed Julia over to Thor, who bounced her delightedly with his bulging biceps. She shrieked and gave him a drooly smile. Steve handed Thor a bottle for Julia. Thor had been the first to notice that Julia could hold her bottle up on her own now and took great delight feeding her.
baby. If Pepper was taking
Wednesday rolled around and Happy walked in at the middle of their Avengers-sized breakfast with Juliana in the midst of her Avengers-sized tantrum.
“I like the idea. I think we should do it,” Steve said.
“You called him, Tony? What for?” Steve asked, as his husband stood up languidly from the couch.
Natasha chuckled and grabbed her plate.
“I had one, not a monthly book though. We all had our pictures taken, me, Mom, and... Howard.” Tony made a face, prompting Steve to push his sketchbook aside and move over to sit beside him on the floor. “We had a family photo and a solo portrait done every year. Usually these are the ones we send out to the press and stuff, or the ones they put on the generic Stark Christmas cards, or whatever.”
“I will cut you, Barnes,” Tony growled. “And you’re damn well older than Steve anyway.”
Steve smiled, warmed by the display. He found Tony incredibly gorgeous most days, even when he had bags under his eyes from pulling an all-nighter and had grease on his face and was incredibly cranky, but he was never more attractive to Steve when he was doting on their daughter. Like almost everything, even fatherhood suited Tony to a tee, and Steve felt fortunate that he got to share that with the man he loved.
Gail’s smile was so warm and approving. “They fit you both.”
“We would love it, and we know Julia would love to have a picture with her godfather,” Steve added.
“She’s having a good day today,” Steve said proudly. He held up Juliana and she cooed at the doctor. Even Dr. Axel melted at those curly hair and blue eyes.
“So I guess you guys were tagging along on the trip?” Wade asked.
Even before, when Steve and Tony were all but strangers at each other's throats, Steve already Tony Stark was
Tony strung the cute green bottle around Steve’s neck and then gently pressed the end against his daughter’s waiting mouth. She took it and slowly settled, letting Steve show her off again to their enraptured audience, blinking slowly.
Steve snorted. “They would if they didn’t know I was in love with a man, which is impossible. Everybody knows I’m in love with only one person.”
“We’re still picking our outfits,” Tony said, holding one out and then the other. “Julia’s not feeling these today.” Right out of the gate his baby already had discerning tastes.
Tony looked at the photo and a smile bloomed on his face, warm and content. “Yeah, it’s… it’s a beauty. You have good taste as always, Miss Potts.”
Steve immediately stood up and started rocking her, trying to get her to calm down, but she let out a scream as loud as her small lungs could go.
The man raised his weapon gauntlet and fired. Instead of bullets, three blue balls of electricity was fired at once. The screaming got louder. Two bodies dropped and something down the street past Peter and Wade exploded.
Clint snickered. “Oh, lord. Darcy’s done it now. Juju-bean’s gonna drool us an ocean at this point.”
Steve reached out as Juliana started tipping backwards. She giggled, finding it all so hilarious, and started tipping herself sideways whenever Steve let her go. “Should we tell them they’re all going to get a picture?”
“Here we go, kiddo.”
Tony pointed to the blue diaper bag he and Steve had painstakingly packed the night before – more of Steve really, because Tony mostly played with the baby. “We brought all her favorites, her blanket, pacifier, pillow, bottle. And we’ll have Pepper and JARVIS on the phone, sometimes she likes their voices more than ours.” He pouted.
“Rogers-override- six-zero-alpha-nine-three-one.” Steve crossed his arms over his chest. “JARVIS, show me the photos Tony printed out for Colonel Rhodes.”
Tony raised a finger at Clint. Steve batted at his hand and he changed it to the fourth finger instead. “Do go on, Barton. I’ve been looking for an excuse not to upgrade your gear.”
Steve crossed his arms. “Don’t be silly, Tony. Clint is Julia’s uncle and Bucky’s her godfather, you know that.” He shrugged. “I was talking about DUM-E, U, and Butterfingers. And also JARVIS, though that might be a bit difficult since JARVIS doesn’t have a physical form.”
“Julia is going to grow up with superheroes for aunts, uncles and godparents,” he said. “She’s going to know me and Tony as her fathers, but also Captain America and Iron Man. Same goes with the Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Agent Agent,” Phil smiled wrly at that, “And even the entirety of Asgard. We’re going to have to figure out how we’re going to introduce her to the Other Guy though, but you and him, you’re both going to be part of her life growing up.”
Tony laughed and let Steve haul him up and out the door.
“Let’s go check Uncle Thor’s soufflé, shall we, Yulia?” she asked. “And I know you’d rather be with me than Uncle Rhodey, anyway.”
“Close enough,” Bucky drawled. He and Steve shared a look and Bucky sent him a thumbs up. Steve finally let himself relax completely. They could talk later, once everyone had rested.
“By the way,” Tony snapped his fingers as he remembered something, “It’s your turn.”
“Save it.” Phil walked over and handed Juliana to Tony. “I’ve seen worse and Juliana’s not old enough to focus past the edge of her nose. Your virtues – or lack thereof – are safe.”
They arrived at the kitchen where everybody was gathered. Bruce was on the table with his tea mug and a plate full of food, scribbling something on a notepad. Phil was talking to Natasha with SHIELD folders scattered in front of them. Bucky and Clint were bickering good-naturedly, while Thor was demolishing a huge bowl – pot, really – of cereal and a plate piled high with bagels.
“Come on, baby girl. Let’s get you home.”
“Wow,” Bruce pushed his glasses up his nose at the fourth photo. “Talk about modesty.”
feet. He held on lightly, beeping excitedly. DUM-E and U immediately started beeping in low tones, and rounded on Butterfingers. Apparently they didn’t think of that.
“Oh my god! Thanks, Mister Stark-Rogers!” Wade gaped behind his mask and Peter flushed.
Steve nodded. “And honestly, Tony really wanted to take Bruce out. So I thought I’d let him set up.”
“Who the hell are you?!” the attacker approached, gauntlet raised and primed to fire.
Steve noticed Jane get an odd expression on her face. Tony seemed to have noticed it too and they shared a curious expression. Yeah, something to talk about later.
There was a knock on the door and Pepper poked her head in, smiling.
Steve reached over, placing a hand on the back of Tony’s neck. Sometimes Tony surprised him, not because he didn’t think his husband was capable of bouts of thoughtfulness and kindness. He knew more than most how incredibly warm, kind, and generous Tony could be. Steve was just constantly surprised at the world in general, that Fate brought him this man and that Steve was the lucky fella who earned his love.
“I’m not sure,” Steve admitted. Rhodey was a busy man and he had very few days off, days he had to divide between his family, friends, and Tony. (Yeah, Tony was a category onto himself.) He’d been here for over a day now and he hadn’t mentioned leaving anytime soon.
All of them had their own stories and secrets, and Steve knew the holidays were bringing out the melancholy in most people, not just him. Steve was once again reminded of how lucky he was – he was healthy and warm, surrounded by family and friends, and wanting for nothing.
“Darce-baby, stop waving my kid around like a body pillow,” Tony said. “And Julia is a mini-
Juliana twitched a chubby fist at the bots’ direction. They chirped back at her, claws and camera vying for the best position. Juliana then opened her mouth a few times and her face scrunched up a little.
“Oh, I would love to have been part of that,” Tony groaned. “First wedding I could remember was for business. I was six. It was boring.”
Peter flushed. “I helped, that’s all. Erm, nothing big.”
Bucky snickered. “Stevie and I went to one when we were kids. Didn’t know who was getting married, but we snuck in because they were giving away free ice cream to the guests’ kids.”
Clint raised a finger behind his back in reply.
Steve sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose and reaching for patience. “And just why did you call Rhodey here, Tony? Why did you have to make up some emergency and bother him?”
“There, that’s better.” Tony winked, pressing a kiss to his lips.
“Good.” Steve grinned. “Now, you need to get downstairs, clean up your workshop, and figure out how you want the bots to look and how JARVIS is going to be there. I’m going to look for a matching onesie for Julia. We can take the picture tomorrow and hang it up in the nursery for everyone to see in time for Julia’s first month.” He pressed a kiss to Tony’s lips and then patted him on the ass. “Go on.”
“You do all the growing you need to do, baby girl,” Tony said, making kissy faces at Juliana as he changed her diapers. Part of fatherhood and marriage was compromise, especially with diaper changes. “Even though I’m wondering how the hell this much stuff came out of a small thing like you.”
“Their strength!” Thor bellowed.
“We’ll leave you two to sleep. Come on, Tony,” Steve said, holding out a hand. “Night, Gail. Night, Julia.”
“What do you have there, zvonochek?” Bucky tugged the frame from Juliana’s hand. “What’s this?”
Again, Steve was just… he was too perfect.
“Okay.”
“Hey, kid,” Tony said, even bumping fists with him. “Good to see you.”
“Good day, Mister Stark-Rogers.” Wade greeted. “I bought donuts.”
“Uhm…” Bruce looked over at Steve. “Am I supposed to say yes?”
“I see. Why the appointment though?” Steve tugged Tony to lie down on his chest. Tony did so, still with that petulant pout. Steve ran his fingers through his curly, messy hair, so much like Julia’s own.
A young man approached their group, college-aged, probably about three or four years older than Peter and his friends. He was in a Stark Industries E-Games jacket, white with red piping and a patch on the chest of what looked like… Hello Kitty with twin katana blades? The jacket hood was up and the boy was wearing a black face mask and glasses with thick red frames, but even that couldn’t hide the scarring on his entire face. He even had on black gloves.
Steve looked up from where he was bundling up a sleepy Julia in her long-sleeved bodysuit, leggings, and pale blue mittens. She just had a warm bath, which was among the top five things she loved – a list that included cows, bananas, Clint’s hearing aids, and the War Machine armor – much to Tony’s dismay.
“Good. You have the helm, Jay,” Tony said. He sat down beside Steve and wrapped one arm around the other man’s back and the other hooking below Steve’s so they were both cradling the baby.
“Good, good,” Dr. Pius said. “No fever, no infection, and we’re looking at blue eyes here, definitely blue I bet. Her eyes are probably gonna lighten up as she gets older.”
(And they were trying to keep Thor distracted. Jane and Darcy couldn’t make the trip to New York this week and Thor had been feeling down in the dumps.)
JARVIS answered promptly. “Of course, Captain. I shall be with you every step of the way.” His usually crisp voice sounded pleased, excited even, and filled with purpose. It helped calm Tony.
Steve propped the toy chest against his hip as he walked down the hall to the nursery. More and more of Julia’s toys were migrating to the living room, rec room, Tony’s workshop, Steve and Tony’s room, Bucky’s room, and Clint and Coulson’s room. Tony was certainly not going to put them back and Bucky and Clint definitely weren’t going to stop stealing some just so they could entice Julia to play, which left Steve to do all the work.
“Do not worry, Captain,” JARVIS interjected. “Despite Sir’s claims, I do have limitations. And I do enforce them.”
Tony raised two fingers in the air. “And second, I’m not trying to foist our daughter on my CEO. I am telling you the truth. Pepper put it on my calendar, and yours. I checked.”
Steve called out. “JARVIS, call To–”
“You never know, he and Peter could become good friends.” Tony was really serious this time.
“Oh, my love.” Tony held her close. He racked his brains. He wasn’t sure how to go about soothing his baby, but he knew how to soothe Steve when he was having bad days and nightmares, so maybe that could work.
“Wade is such a nice boy though, very smart, and thoughtful. He’s an orphan, got into a bad accident when he was a kid hence all the hiding and the scars, and while he never got adopted, his current guardian’s a blind older woman. He actually got into e-sports to try and pay his way through college and to help his guardian, said it’s helped him stay away from drugs and fooling around. Part of why he got into SI’s radar is that he’s pretty involved with charity. He helped fund a school in his area and started up CEGA, their local Charity E-games Association.”
“Yes.” Peter glared at his parents.
“There’s more than one poster inside that tube, isn’t there?”
Steve thought about how casual Natasha was when she mentioned the photo book last month. He should have known. Natasha was never
“Like I said, you’re heartless, doc,” Tony scoffed.
Unlike Bucky’s disdain for cameras, Rhodey was similar to Pepper and wasn’t averse to being photographed. It was probably part and parcel of being around Tony Stark. He also didn’t mind if it was Tony taking the photo, even if Tony was being obnoxious and demanding about it.
“Juliana’s growing up fast,” Phil commented, soft in that way he was only when around Julia and the Avengers. “And parenthood suits you… both of you.”
“No, no, go do it,” Bucky smirked. “It’ll be hilarious.”
“Your offspring grows so much in so short a time,” Thor said, smiling warmly. He fiddled with his phone, looking at the image JARVIS had forwarded to all of them. “I am most excited to show my dear Mother how Juliana’s growth has progressed. I am sure she will have more blessings and gifts to impart. Even Lady Sif and the Warriors Three would greatly enjoy hearing more stories of her.”
But there’s the good. By God, is there the good.
Tony quickly averts his gaze, and sends a quick grin to Peter. “Parker, you okay there?”
A spike, a pounding, a spark of something white and hot burns through Tony’s brain, so sudden and so intense that he almost clutches his head in surprise and pain. He can’t control his wince, ducking his head to hide the ache, waiting the second until it passes and he can play it off with some quip and lie.
Tony shoots him a brittle grin. “No good deed. Axioms are always right in the end.”
“I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t your life on the line.”
Steve thinks of that often, too.
“What? No, that’s the exact opposite of what I said. You can poke it. I know you want to.”
When he steps in the room, he pauses slightly in the doorway, just from the expression on Steve’s face.
She wanders over to the couch, and sits directly in front of him.
Fascinating.
And worse – when he started letting himself feel, letting himself be human – even then, he couldn’t purge his genes. His Vulcanism had everything feeling so much stronger, so much more overwhelming, so much
Two months to the day, Tony finds himself sitting on the couch, working on his tablet for some new R&D adventure, when he feels Steve tap Tony's foot that is currently sitting in his lap.
Tony stares at him a second, and then smiles, small, peaceful.
He thought it would be easier to bite the bullet and tell everyone he cared about – wow, a crowd composed of three whole people – in one punch.
“Oh shit, really?” Steve says, eyes wide and blinking, and Tony shrugs.
“Tony, are you sure about this?” she asks. Her tone has noticeably dropped to something soft, and it has Steve looking back down at his breakfast.
He’s supposed to
He did what he could think of to convince them it was really him - included his Starfleet number, personal passcode, a detailed explanation of events, as well as an inside joke he knew the communications officer would immediately recognize.
“I am also worried about this mission.” Steve appears tired. Tony doesn’t know him, not really. He knows his mind is warm and gold like honey, his presence comforting and his mental state constant, but he does not know him. He doesn’t know what would make him tired, make him worry.
He thinks of the Vulcan Science Academy, the place that taught him all the knowledge that has led to anything good in life.
“Stop trying to do it and actually physically do it.”
She hesitates, one hand on the ship comm, clearly slightly confused. Then, after a moment, the look shifts to something oddly soft, and Tony’s not sure, but it feels like sympathy.
In these old ships, they required access to be approved by a senior bridge officer. After examining the code that the Avenger had scanned from their systems the day prior, Tony had determined it would be easier to simply code Steve’s biometrics into the ship as a bridge officer than code around the requirement, and safer to do it through code than to blast their way through the door.
He’s feeling awful. On the physical side of things, he’s low on energy. Everything feels like its blurring at the edges, going fuzzy, and he can’t seem to find any grounding. It’s like he’s starting to fade away.

(As a child, Tony had never understood his father’s aversion to Starfleet. It had seemed illogical. Starfleet was a harmless organization, focused on expedition and peaceful exploration of federation planets. Their concentration on scientific advancement interested Tony. But his father had taken Tony’s borrowed book on Starfleet history, and methodically and purposefully placed each page atop the fireplace in their home.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about,” Tony had lied, stupidly.
“But what about you?” Steve presses. The blue light of the arc reactor is shining through Tony’s shirt. “There isn’t anything you’d go back and prevent from happening?”
Tony gives it to him.
He picks up one up and studies it. Purple, hard but still textured like a fruit. He had meant to look it up and see its chemical properties after leaving the planet, but had forgotten.
For the first time in his life, Tony watches the sunset until it’s gone.
was a mostly-fictionalized super character. He was a boy with a brain too big and a heart already wounded, of course he would chase a dream of being an important, big person who punches his problems away.
No, instead, it’s a dream about how one night when Tony was sitting on the couch, watching some stupid TV show, Steve had saw him on the couch and hadn’t been able to contain himself, had felt the overwhelming affection overflow, and had slid up behind Tony, snaking his arms around Tony’s shoulders, and let himself kiss the top of Tony’s head, hard and long. Tony had turned. He was impossibly close, big brown eyes large and slightly confused, before his face had transformed with a smile, and he leaned forward, capturing Steve’s lips – and it escalated, kiss pushing and pulling, faster and slower, and they had transported to the bedroom with it being a dream, and they had slid together, muttering words about
“Tore the gate off its hinges,” Clint corrects.
Tony agrees.
But it’s not his worst memory.
“What does that even mean? That’s not aiming high.”
“On Stark Industries server, sir?”
They’ve all already decided that it won’t be announced to the public, at least not now. He briefly considers taking him back to Malibu, but he promised to show him New York, and there’s something that kind of makes him twitch about that house now. Some may say it’s PTSD from being nearly murdered by his father figure and business partner and then indirectly causing the death of the same guy, but Tony thinks it’s more likely that it’s the new paint job. Pepper has terrible taste in wall colors.
“Just looking before I leap,” Steve says, completely non-sensically, before flipping the TV back on.
is halfway
Focus through the chaos. Observe. Draw conclusions.
He’s being looked at like he’s a puzzle, and Tony finds himself fiddling with some knob on the warp core. He hopes it isn’t important.
“You got to have some poison.” Thunder rolls, and they both look up, smiling at the grey sky, rain falling into their eyes. “JARVIS, make a puddle.”
Tony’s still looking at him, calculated now. Steve goes to ask something smart, like
“What of it?”
going to let you sink. You can fight against me with those giant muscles swimming the other way if you feel you have to, but I am
“Nope,” he says. “Have her email whatever it is to me,” and then shuts the door in her face and locks it with a technology so complicated it hasn’t even been featured in Star Trek.
“How does shirking responsibility onto someone else not sound like me—”
It’s not graceful and probably not a good move in the long run, but he desperately wants to get out of there before they send a team after him. It’s so much more triumphant to come up holding a body than to have a team of agents come up behind him while he’s hitting ice with a knife like some Norwegian ice-fisherman.
Tony remembers looking over at Pepper on that balcony, all that time ago. She in her low-cut blue dress, holding a drink, staring outside and waiting – waiting for him, waiting on him, just like always. He remembers turning away, and that feeling in his chest – that feeling of letting go of hope, of possibility, of wants, because he had to. Because it was right.
“I don’t know! My track record says no, but my track record should

“Unless I need to lay down on it,” Tony says.
want it.”
The next battle is about three days later when Doom –
“Okay, okay.” A pause. “Okay, then.”
He hadn't even been aware he had been feeling grief - but knew once it lifted, once it was replaced with a light, astonished happiness. Across light years, across days of warp-travel, across galaxies, he could feel the tenor of relief, the restless anxiousness, the urgency.
Steve pads over silently and takes the seat next to Tony. After a moment, Tony can feel Steve’s arm settle around his shoulders, quietly pulling him so he’s tucked underneath Steve’s shoulder.
“If there’s anyone else other than Hammer here, like employees, the front doors will lead straight to them. You mentioned that Hammer was controlling the drones remotely. If he’s still here, he was probably doing it from a lab, and not from an office where people could overlook. Our best bet for not being noticed and finding him is to go straight to the basement and work our way up.”
Silence.
On day thirty-three, Steve brings Tony up to the top of the tower to watch the sunset. “The air is cleaner,” Steve says, when Tony asks if there’s anything different about New York from up on high. “But that—” he points to the sun going underneath the city, the reds, the purples, the dark blue taking over. “That’s still the same, even now.”
To think he had thought that was an easier question to answer than
“I know you’re probably fine,” Bruce says, a medical tricorder already in hand. “Being that you didn’t actually die, but you did teleport a
Plan B is giving up on life plan, which has him ignoring Tony, refusing to see anyone else, refusing to make plans in the future, and not leaving the tower since he got there.
even though it’s absolutely true.
“I will go, stop the fighting,” Drax says immediately, and then runs off before Clint, his commander in this situation, can get in a word.
It’s nothing big. He answers right, has the right quips, does all the normal stuff. Steve wouldn’t even notice anything was off if he didn’t know Tony so well, if he wasn’t completely attuned to Tony, having subconsciously catalogued his version of normal every day, every hour, for the past months.
“No, it’s just—” Steve looks pensive. “Galaxy famous playboy. You have all the riches you could ever need. Fame. Scientific prodigy. Engineering legend. And here you are—” He gestures at the creature. “Sweating the small stuff.”
And then they’re off again – this time talking about the way people drank in the war, and moving on, somehow, to the anatomy of camels (there was some connection there – drunk person handling a camel carrying supplies, camel broke shit? Steve can no longer remember. It was Tony’s story, after all).
After everything, even the past few days, Tony just curls his fingers around the doorframe, and says, “Yeah, Steve. I do.”
“I got invited by SHIELD to a thing. A highly classified thing I cannot tell you about, but a thing, a very last-minute thing, and then that thing has led to this.” He gestures at Steve. “Has led to Steve. Steve will be staying here for the foreseeable future and due to classified circumstances he needs someone to teach him the way of the world.”
moment, the one that switches his axis, that fixes him with hatred and self-loathing and guilt so strong some days he suffocates with it –
Steve nods, once. His face is somber, sober. “I was filling out the form to negate your death.”
It takes a moment for Steve to identify the emotion that’s seeping throughout him. But he gets there.
She also knows Vulcans, having been stationed on Vulcan before her admission to Starfleet. They’re not what he would consider close friends, but if they’ve ever bonded, it’s over that. Vulcan voodoo may fool the rest, but she should know better.
“I would rather spend my days with you, my darling child,” Thor said, cradling her in his arms. As if in reply, Julia let out a raspberry which made the god of thunder chuckle in amusement. “And indeed, we should not be saddened. Tis the season of joy and you make every day so much brighter.”
“Nonsense. You made it work when I couldn't,” Tony scoffed. “Now go on.” He shooed them off. “Opening Ceremony is in four hours, so go while you have a chance. I’ll catch up.”
“JARVIS, no!” Tony screeched.
“They all did. Miss Hauer cried.” Phil’s lip twitched. “Having a child together was the final straw. She was so happy for you two. Oh, and she said thank you for the cheese rolls you sent. They were her favorite.”
[Image 1: It’s a high angle photo – most likely taken by JARVIS – showing everyone gathered in the living room, bundled up in warm sweaters and blankets with various snacks. Julia, Tony and Steve are in the middle couch. Julia is dressed in a red sweater, mittens, and a pompom hat. Tony and Steve are kissing over her head. Bucky is on the floor, holding up a candy cane to Julia and making a face at Steve and Tony. Clint is beside Bucky, holding up a sign that says ‘Happy 6th Month Juliana!!!
Tony grinned. “Join me!”
Tony pressed a few more kisses to their baby before sending a flying kiss to Gail.
Coming from a superhero family, Peter was taught to do two things whenever there was screaming: run away and hide or run away and seek help. But considering the fact that some guy ran right out of the museum just a few feet away and was literally running towards Peter and Wade, all those instructions were kind of moot.
“It’s not my fault I haven’t seen Thor,” she scoffed, her long straight hair spread out like a waterfall on her pillows. “It’s like Fate or maybe Mother Nature is telling us that we’re not meant to meet.”
Peter
“I made a lot, good for everybody, super soldiers and gods.” Bucky grinned. “Babies too, if zvonochek wasn’t so teeny yet.”
It was Fate.
It got to the point that Tony had fashioned an adjustable rolling pole stand for it so they could wheel it around easily enough whenever Julia was napping in the nursery, the playroom, living room, Steve and Tony’s room, the library, or pretty much anywhere.
There was the soft swish of the elevator doors opening and boots stomping their way down the hall. Bucky, Phil, and Natasha walked in, and immediately there was pandemonium.
“I said Barnes is your family. You…” Tony heaved a sigh as if he was doing something so incredibly terrible or annoying, but it was obviously all for show going by the light flush on his cheeks. “The bots are our family, okay, I get that. But Pepper and Happy are my family from before you and I even met. Barnes is your best friend and your family from back then and I want your family to be a part of it. I mean, yeah we talked about how we’re going to invite all the Avengers, but I think… you know, your family should get first dibs too.”
“Tony, ten minutes is serious. Especially if you stayed calm and clear headed the whole time. What did you do?” What had he done? He tried to remember. “Breathing. I starting to count when I noticed my heart rate spiking. I still felt like throwing up but like you said – progress is progress.” This earned him a smile.
“Only if you ask for it.” He would give her the world if she asked for it. Jarvis too. They deserved it for sticking by his side for as long as they had.
The drive is uneventful. It’s comfortable having someone who knows him so well in the passenger seat. It’s even better that it’s Pepper and she’s got so much to say about everything that happened during their time apart that it’s like she never left the city by the time they make it back to the tower.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We really should.” He hoped that didn’t come across too blunt. He was still working on voicing his thoughts anyway. Steve just kept smiling.
The thought of seeing Steve hadn’t even crossed his mind. Of course he should have known he would run into him here but, at the same time, what were the odds that they would find themselves in the same New York gallery on the same night.
(See the end of the chapter for
It's too easy to fall into the familiarity of a situation.
Tony could have sent someone to pick Pepper up. Despite her threat of retaliation, Jarvis could have come in his place and gave his usual excuses. The only problem was that he no longer had any usual excuses.
It’s Jarvis who speaks up next. “No, but Miss Rogers has a point. I think it’s time you came clean.” He blinks up at the other man a bit taken aback. “Am I ready for that?” The other two share a glance over his head of understanding. “With something like this I doubt you’ll ever be.”
“You think he wants a second chance.” Apparently not. “I know he wants the comfort of always having someone in his corner no matter what.” That information he has to process. It’s new, hearing his relationship with Steve put in those words.
Steve sighed contently as they made their way to the gallery’s exit. “This was nice.” Tony nodded. “I kind of missed this.”
“Ms. Romanov has a point.” All attention is on an intern that runs the company's social media. Tony surprises himself with that knowledge. “You were Tony Stark: genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. It’s been six months. With or without a serious partner by your side, who are you now?” It’s the boy who finally asks the million dollar question.
“Stark Industries has decided to offer scholarships to individuals interested in pursuing a degree in Psychology.” Tony nodded, still stuck on saying his doctor’s first name as well as suddenly getting hit with the importance of what was about to be done. The other man continued.
He clears his throat and hopes that the part of him that’s used to this circus is just hibernating, not completely gone like the less favorable parts of his personality. “I have been told from a young age to ignore what tabloids publish about the Stark name. I brought you here today –“ He coughs. ”My assistant brought you here today…” There’s laughter from his audience and he relaxes. “Because I cannot brush off the most recent headline.”
He could practically feel Pepper’s excitement vibrating through the car’s speakers. “Tony, I swear. If you waited until now to tell me I’m getting a newly stocked closet I am going to have a lot of explaining to do when I bring my things over to Steve’s.” He laughed, still noticing that the name no longer affected him as much as it used to.
“I’m only doing my job.” The blonde smiles over her glass at the response. “You care too much for it to be just a job anymore, Jarvis.” He just shakes his head. It would be too much to admit any sentiment out loud.
“I say we make the most of it! Would you care for a guided tour? One of my friends from school helped put all of this together so I’ve become pretty well versed.” Tony had no time to say no as the other man took hold of his arm and led him to the first piece.
“Right, of course.” Steve stood up and made to hug him but was cut off by a sharp “Don’t.” Tony winced at his own abruptness. “Sorry.” Steve nodded taking his offered hand to shake and brushing off the hint of rejection he had felt. “It was nice seeing you again, Tony.”
“Pepper, the day you ask for too much will be the day I die.” Her expression softens at his comment. It says a lot that he can mention his death so casually, at all even.
Steve took a moment to process what Tony had just called him and found himself blushing in embarrassment for staring longer than he should have been. “Sorry. Hi. Wow. Definitely wasn’t expecting to see you here.” He looked up again questioningly this time. “Do you want to sit?”
“We are out of the office, Tony, Bruce is fine.” It came with a small smile. Probably the only reactions the psychiatrist was willing to show. “Alright, Bruce –“ Jarvis caught his hesitation.
Reconnecting with people seems to be getting easier.
Both doctor and patient lived in this moment for a while before heading their separate ways. This entire experience had never been Tony’s idea to begin with but he was enjoying it to some degree. Dr. Banner wouldn’t hesitate to say he didn’t mind the billionaire all that much either.
She sees him tense and smirks in response. He’s visibly uncomfortable despite knowing she’s in on this and she’s milking his reaction to sell it to her audience. “The image of you and your last known significant lover paints a different image for a vast majority of us. If we disregard the text that accompanies it.” Everyone is enraptured by her. He should really hire her for SI as soon as this is all said and done.
“None taken. I believe we owe it to human nature. He might have everything he ever wanted in his relationship with James but now, he doesn’t have Tony.” There’s enough silence in the time that passes after that Tony starts to wonder if it’s time he step in.
“Oh, calm down,” Tony called out above the din. “It’s just a visitor.” He checked his watch. “And he’s early.”
honeymoon.”
Steve let him go on for a while before leaning over to place his palm over Tony’s mouth. “You mean Rhodey knows.”
Bucky groaned.  “I know, right? It haunts my dreams sometimes.” He finished off the rest of his juice.
