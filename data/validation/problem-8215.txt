Tony approaches him slowly, pausing to circle down the volume as he passes the speaker.  The change in the music must alert Steve to his presence, though he doesn’t stop what he’s doing and he doesn’t say anything.
Tony reaches out and sets his hand on Steve’s hip, fingers clutching at the thin fabric of his open shirt. Even though every time he moves toward Steve tonight, Steve backs away, and every time he touches, Steve lets go, Tony can’t help himself from trying again.
“Jan, how about I walk you home?” He offers, and she presses herself up alongside him, resting her head against his shoulder even as she protests.
The winter air hits him crisp and bitter cold as he steps out onto the sidewalk, but the day is bright and sunny and what’s left of the snow is churning to slush in the gutter.  Except for in some of the parks, snow never stays long in the city.
“I’m trying to be serious, Tony.”
“Barnes is in our custody, that is correct.”
It hits him then that not only does he not know what to make for dinner, he doesn’t know where to go or when to go there.
“Captain America shouldn’t smoke cigarettes.”
“All the same.” He’s too busy trying to arrange her safely between himself and the railing before he guides her down the stairs that he doesn’t realize someone else is already outside.
Steve pulls the comforter all the way down, draping it over the end and onto the floor.
“I think sometimes he gets confused and thinks that’s what he is.”
Bucky’s alive.  That’s why…yeah, that’s why he and Tony came back to New York.  Because Bucky was in danger.  You have to be alive to be in danger.  That’s only logical, right?  It’s through sheer force of will that Steve manages to open his eyes and look at the man at his bedside.
, and his chin and throat are shiny and slick with come and lube and spit. It should be gross but all Tony wants to do is kiss him, and kiss him, and kiss him some more. Tony closes his eyes against the overwhelming urge and re-doubles his efforts on Steve’s cock. Steve throbs inside Tony’s mouth and the taste of him spreads over the flat of his tongue, drips down his throat. Steve’s fingers clench tightly in his hair, pulling just enough to feel too good.
Their HYDRA target is one and the same, and while the Winter Soldier could deftly handle the situation with single-handed stealth, Captain America is with his team, with his Avengers.
It’s not like he necessarily
“Tony?”  Steve rolls his neck, slightly stiff from sleeping.  “What’re you doin’, sittin’ alone in the dark?”
He pours a triple espresso into a mug of coffee as JARVIS fills him in on what mess awaits him in the gym because Clint had challenged Thor to some kind of indoor clay pigeon contest of sorts, lightning bolts versus arrows.  Tony doesn’t want to think about it.  That’s the kind of stuff Captain America should be putting a stop to if his attentions weren’t otherwise occupied.
“Why don’t you tell me about the movie you’re working on?”
Not having to curse himself for loving the feel of Steve’s taut abs under his touch frees up a lot of time to consider other things.
Tears well up behind his eyelids and he doesn’t even know why.  He hurriedly wipes them away, desperate to get ahold of himself before Pepper and Tony follow him outside.
Neither Clint nor Natasha move to help him; Tony assumes they both know better. Hill scavenges up a working radio from the wreckage and starts asking after survivors.  She gets no response.
“It’s for a project.”
“How’d that happen? I would’ve thought no one would touch him with a ten foot pole after what went down,” Morita comments, and after the others nod in agreement, one by one they all pause and then look at him.
Bucky advances on the bed, good hand curled in a tight fist by his side. Bucky has never hit him, but it’s nonetheless clear in this moment that Bucky is holding himself back.
*******
“You’re right.  Next time I’m dying, I should just bring you donuts and call it a day.”
“This is Madison Square Garden?  It’s…” Steve looks to the corner again, checking their location.  “But where is Penn Station?”
is Steve's outfit for the premiere. This poor boy didn't even own a tux, if you can believe that! It was a situation that needed immediate remedy.”
This new position is tenuous; Steve has to support most of Tony’s weight in order to get him at the right angle to slide back inside. Tony’s left hand finds the towel rack on the wall; the other clutches the curved edge of the sink. He wraps his legs high around Steve’s back as they clamber for each other again.
Bucky slowly takes a few steps back, eyeing Tony warily. He doesn’t
Beside Thor, Sam struggles valiantly to keep a straight face and Steve widens his eyes at his friend in warning, telling him to keep it together.
“They’re going to try to renovate, move Madison Square and build up the station again.  But not for at least ten years.”
“That is...remarkably adult of you, Tony,” Rhodey comments, faintly surprised, and Tony grunts in offense.
“Correction, he
Instead of making his way to the training level, Tony seeks out Bruce in R&D.  They’ve been working on a global sweep and alert system that will notify Bruce of any Tesseract-like changes in the earth’s gamma output.  The glowing blue death cube and its endless energy should be safely ensconced in the Asgardian treasure chamber, but after the havoc the thing has wreaked, neither of them want to take any chances of missing an unexpected return.
“Of course.” Tony sweeps his arm out, gesturing for Nigel to lead.
to fix it, and he just can’t.  He can’t do anything right.”
“Well, uh…” Steve drops his hands to the collar of Tony’s button-down shirt, Tony having gotten into bed without even bothering to undress or change. The fabric is silky soft between his fingers. “He called me up after you and he talked, and he filled me in on your letter.” Steve coughs, throwing Tony a look that says
“Speaking of Natasha, where is the fair lady warrior as of late?  I have not seen her much during my stay.”
“I appreciate the effort, Barnes, but Pepper’s stocked us up for more trick-or-treaters than can possibly exist in Manhattan.”  Tony hadn’t wanted to participate, positing that opening the grounds to the public would be a disaster waiting to happen, but Coulson had arranged tight security and Pepper thought it would be excellent PR.
Giving in to his worst impulses, Tony jumps up, nearly tripping over his feet in his hurry to catch up with Steve before he’s gone. He slams through the door and darts down the stairs, feet clattering gracelessly in an undignified scramble.
care that you’re gay, or bisexual, or whatever label you want to slap on it, you should know I don’t.”
“And why the hell not?”  Tony sounds frustrated and Steve doesn’t even get why.  This isn’t his problem and it’s none of his business.
Steve never told Natasha why he’d left the tower, but from the looks of things she either suspects or she must have found out.  Bucky very well may have told her; sometimes the two of them stay up late, talking quietly in Russian and taking apart and cleaning and reassembling her guns.  Bucky says it’s calming.  Steve doesn’t sleep much either, but he leaves them to their ways of coping and they leave him to his.
“Darcy, you
“Can’t steal what can never be had, Rogers.” Natasha pinches his thigh and pinches it
“Are you sure you’re not coming down with something? You’re all flushed, Tony, and you don’t seem well.”
.  Besides.  Tony hasn’t stopped talking about you all week.  As much as I like you, Steve, he’s going to drive me crazy.”
If anything, Bruce just grows more confused by this information.
realize the truth of the matter now, but his worry is for naught. “You at least going to see the girl again?”
“Maybe I should take a shower first.” Steve suggests weakly as he takes the robe from Tony. He stands, bringing the sheet with him. Tony’s eyes track down his body for a moment and then back up to his face. A telltale flush spreads across Tony’s cheeks, revealing his thoughts to be less than innocent. Tony doesn’t say anything though, evidently aware that now is not the right time.
Tony huffs in response and follows Steve up to street level, grateful to be walking behind him not only for the view of his magnificent behind, but also to hide how the climb makes his thighs burn and his lungs hurt. They reach the top and Steve’s not even out of breath.
“I thought you two were madly in love with each other. I kept bracing myself for the day you finally told us all the truth and then rode off into the sunset.”
Well, it’s because he’s only human and Steve’s perfect.
Steve folds the paper and sets it aside before placing his hands on his knees. One would think Bucky was gunning to be the next studio head with the way he always harps on about these things. But the big honcho’s office is a lifetime away from the small little screenwriting bungalow Bucky and his partner, Natasha, share.
Tony wonders if maybe Bucky has come once before this, rode himself to orgasm on Steve’s thick dick and then kept right on going. Bucky had said Steve’s stamina was almost too much for one receiving person to handle, but Tony figures Bucky’s recovery time probably ain’t that bad either.
gossip rag.”
“Then I’m glad you found him,” Bucky replies quietly, with another kiss to Steve’s fingers. “That you have him.”
of this is news to Peter.
comes the reply, and Steve thanks God that Tony hasn’t managed to completely change his reputation.  Billionaire playboys don’t ride the N train.
Steve crosses his arms and stares at the water in the pond, letting Tony ramble at his back.
Even so, he makes to pull back.  Steve whimpers at the loss and Tony sucks in a sharp breath, the sound of it making his own dick twitch.
Tony moans as well, head dropping down between his shoulders, one arm snapping out to steady himself with a hand against the mirror. His fingers scramble for purchase, streaking the lower part of the mirror clean of steam.
“Heimdall.  Can he-“
A strikingly elegant redhead in an emerald green dress is approaching the club just as Steve exits, but it’s the rakishly handsome man on her arm that makes Steve’s steps stutter. Thinking quickly, he tilts the brim of his hat low across his brow and ducks his head, looking away as he courteously holds the door open for the young lady.
Steve’s already at his side; he heard the whole thing.  They exchange a long, hard look, and then Tony glances at Pepper.  She nods, letting their personal matters be shoved aside as always.
it was mere coincidence.  Perhaps passed it off as a Nordic fetish and joked that he planned on opening a division of Stark Industries in Sweden just to expand and refresh his dating pool.
“This is rather…”  Steve’s own hand encircles Tony’s wrist, stilling his movement.
“Steve,” she says quietly.  It takes him a moment but he manages to look at her.  She seems calm but he can see it in her eyes.  Panic, fear, sadness.  She’s as distraught as he feels.  He doesn’t understand why.
“Let me fetch a bottle of wine and then I’ll be right back over,” Jan tells him as she pulls the car to a stop along the curb in front of his and Bucky’s apartment. She flounces across the street toward her own place, her stole drooping from her shoulder.
saying.”
Steve hesitates, tossing one look Tony’s way but then turning his gaze back toward the ocean. He coughs instead of replying to Tony’s question, and reverts back to their previous line of discussion.
“Which, as I said-“
“You know Steve fucking hates it when I smoke.” Bucky shrugs. Tony points at him. “And you know full well he hates it when you do too.”
Part of him wants to hear Steve scream when he realizes what’s happened. That while he’d been in the throes of passion, his lover had been killed right in front of him and there had been nothing he could do to stop it. That he hadn’t even seen it coming.
“But I knew him.”
“You just said you’d have sex with him!”
“In the morning, he always screams your name,” Bucky says a bit louder, letting Steve hear him now. “Big, huge loads of come everywhere and it’s
. I suspect we’re about to have bubbles in places we never dreamed of, nor wanted.”
Tony’s lips part against his and Steve takes the invitation, sinking slowly deeper and pulling Tony in close.  He finally gets to brush his fingers through Tony’s beautiful dark hair, his other hand sliding to the small of Tony’s back.  Tony’s hands are on his face, his fingers rough but his touch gentle.  The sensation of their kiss is both steadying and wild; he’s secure in Tony’s embrace, feeling safe like he’s never felt before, but the world is swirling around them like they’re the calm in the eye of the storm.
“No, no hotels tonight. Here.” He insists, capturing Tony’s mouth again.
He takes a deep breath and puts his fingertips against the thick glass, resting his forehead gently between his hands and looking straight down.   It’s a long drop.
“Banner?”
“Hi, Pepper,” Steve says, feeling a fool.  “Steve Rogers.”
Tony forces himself to get up, after that, finding his clothes in the pile on the floor and reluctantly putting them back on. He doesn’t clean up, liking the feel of his cock wet and sticky inside his boxers. He reeks of sex and he looks used and the only thing keeping him from feeling utterly content is having to leave Steve like this, naked and beautiful and sated on his bedroom floor.
*******
“Okay boys, behave, we’re here.”  Tony interrupts as the doors open on Steve’s new art studio.  He steps out first, making a sweeping gesture toward the newly remodeled space.  “Check it out, Rogers.”
“Steve, I was going to go see the
After a while he pries off his shoes and pads around the place, seeking out the bathroom.  The tile is cold under his bare feet.  He flips on all the lights and stares at his bruised reflection in the large mirror.  He’s still pale, the skin underneath his eyes shadowed purple and sickly yellow.  Lifting up his t-shirt, he gingerly touches the incisions and wounds left from the Red Room’s cruel experiments.  His body has been slow to heal.
But it’s only a matter of time before he loses his battle against the impulse.  Steve is going to smile a certain way or say some impossibly perfect thing and Tony’s going to break Pepper’s heart.
Steve’s sigh is bone-deep.
Tony doesn’t bring up Bucky once and Steve can’t begin to say how much he appreciates it.
“Talking about you, actually,” Tony shoots back.  Clint glances at the paper clutched in Steve’s hand and then shoots Steve a look of horror.
Steve thuds face first back into his pillow, his groan muffled against the fabric. When he’d come home to an empty apartment this morning, he should never have assumed Bucky to be out and about in his usual Saturday routine. From Bucky’s tone, it sounds like he’s going to get a tongue lashing the likes of which he hasn’t heard since before his mother passed years ago.
It takes far too long for it all to make sense again. By the time it does, Tony is bent down in front of him, hands outstretched but carefully not touching him.
“There is no
Bucky hangs up without another word and Steve watches his dark figure dart across the rooftop.  He palms Natasha’s cell phone and turns his attention back to the still-unconscious Bruce.
That will just have to wait.
And Steve.  Steve.  Steve’s already gone.  He’s failed, and Steve’s gone.  He can’t see the helicopter anymore.
“All right as it can be.” Steve squeezes Tony’s hand lightly and then disentangles their fingers. He folds his arms, leaning on the railing. “It’s hard, being reminded of how little of our lives we actually share. ”
He lets Steve go.  He stands silently and waits until Steve is long out of sight before doing anything.
“But…
“I’m sorry…” Steve starts, and Tony quirks an eyebrow at him.
“Excuse me,” the waitress states, reaching between them to set down their plates.  Steve’s cheeks are flushed, color high.  Tony smiles up at their server, murmuring a thank you.
“I’ll have Tony take it up and put it in our fridge. I really do want to have it later.”
“Hmm?” He’s only giving her half his attention, if that, and he knows it’s probably going to come back and bite him in the ass soon.
The Winter Soldier could have made these evil men vanish, bloodlessly and without fanfare. They could have been whispered away in the night with nary a trace, a mysterious disappearance never to be solved. He could have wiped HYDRA from the map swiftly and silently. Yet he had not. He had done all of this violently and explosively, knowing that he would not avoid attention.
Steve chastises himself for the unkind thoughts. He’s clearly more agitated than even he realized.
“Long as you have those abs, hell yeah.”
“We’re not discussing me, we’re discussing you,” Rhodey sing-songs tiredly.
“Don’t leave me hangin’ here, Cap, what did you really wanna say?”
Clint’s not impressed.
“What?” Steve exclaims. “Are you joking? You’re saying you broke it off for my own benefit? How gracious of you to decide what’s best for me without even asking me what I want.”
“Merlot is wonderful,” Steve assures her, pulling out a chair at the kitchen table for her to sit. “I’m sorry this place isn’t much.” He says as she sits down, looking entirely out of place in the small, barebones kitchen.
“Well, considering your system upgrade happened in 1943, Steve, your software might be a bit out of date.  A little extra virus protection never hurt anyone.”  Steve looks at him blankly, not amused.  “What, computer jokes not your speed?  Just humor me, you oaf, and don’t sit on that thing half-naked?  I don’t want to explain to Fury how you picked up the clap.”

“To be standing here, next year, with you.”
He’d borrowed one of Steve’s hoodies once, so long ago now, and it was when he’d found himself snuggling into it later that night, the lingering scent making him feel light and happy, that he’d realized how hopelessly
“Let’s see…I was going under the knife to have the arc removed.” Tony draws an imaginary circle on his chest where the reactor used to be.  “And injecting myself with a volatile virus in order to basically turn myself into the most highly advanced technology on the planet.”
When Steve pulls back, Tony’s actually breathless.
“Ok.  Well.”  Tony looks up and down the street, not seeing much that will be of assistance.  A diner, a drug store, dentist’s office.  Happy is waiting in the town car just fifty yards back, expecting to drive two passengers to the airport.  “Here’s what we’re gonna do.  We’re gonna get something to eat in that lovely little establishment over there because I need coffee and you need to eat something, and then we’re gonna find some place around here that sells motorcycles, I’m gonna pick one up and then I’m coming with you.”
“You’re onto me, Rogers.” Bucky goes to clap him on the shoulder again but stops himself. He closes his fist instead and gives Steve a half-hearted punch to the bicep.
“What do you think?”
, he could have set up camp and waited and saved a lot of time and trouble.

Bucky bites back bitter, sarcastic laughter.  Steve and Tony. Tony and Steve. They are the
said and definitely the most ill timed, but to his shock Steve doesn’t seem at all put off by it.  In fact, his anger and dismay seem sapped, replaced by general weariness.
He coats Tony’s tongue with it, flooding Tony’s mouth with the mess. He spends
“I highly doubt that. You’re incredibly compelling.”
yours is brilliant.” He exclaims, looking back up at him and rolling his eyes exaggeratedly.  He points a finger close to Steve’s face.  “I’m stealing it.  Anyone asks I totally came up with it.”
“How about ‘I’ll call you from New York’?” Steve faces him fully.
“Checkmate.”
“Howard Stark provided funding and stage weapons, he wasn’t exactly in the film business.” Steve rubs his palm over his heated face as he turns away from his friend and back to the drawing board. “Once the war ended, I don’t think Howard had anything more to do with movies.”
“Well, you don’t have much choice.  Now you have your own space, and I can finally have my workshop back.  It all works out great.”
“Call Tony Stark. Just…call him. You have nothing to lose.”
“I have thought about this carefully.”
Rooms used to be silent.  Nothing’s really silent anymore.
“New York? How long are you planning to be gone?”
Steve opens it all the way, still dripping wet, his pale skin flushed from the heat of the shower.  A threadbare white towel is slung low at his waist, sitting loose around his hips like all Tony would have to do is brush against him to make it fall off.
“Tony...”
“Tony.”
Steve leans against the iron railing and concentrates on slowing his breathing, his heartbeat. He hopes that the flush of exertion will fade from his pale skin a bit before he goes inside.
They’re getting a few odd looks now from the people immediately surrounding them – because no matter what the clichés are, some people in New York
“Just move back in, okay?  Bring Bucky too, I don’t care, but you need to be
“Okay.” Steve pulls at the hem of his t-shirt, straightening his appearance.  “Do I need my coat, are we going somewhere?”
Tony smiles slightly, a different smile that curls gently at the edges of his lips.
has a quarter the circulation numbers, he’s nothing to worry about.”
He aims the conversation elsewhere.
“You feel so…” Bucky gasps against his lips, the rest of his words disappearing into another kiss. He adjusts his stance, hips shifting a little to the left, and Steve moans into Bucky’s mouth. His leg slips down from by Bucky’s shoulder to bend around Bucky’s waist, heel against the small of Bucky’s back. It’s like they fold into one another; for right now there’s nothing in the world except Bucky’s body against his.
Tony has to admit, this does throw him for a loop. It shouldn’t – people know who he is, it’s not so unbelievable that this stranger would too. Nevertheless, it’s the way the man says his name so crisply, like he knows more about him than his name, that sets Tony off guard.
“Fine.  Walk.  Don’t be late.”

“Nearly every joint he’s ever made is set in Brooklyn or Manhattan.”

“A few days ago, but it’s not…it’s not exactly new.  It’s complicated.  But Clint told Darcy and though I hate to say it, Darcy’s an awful gossip.  Figured the whole world knew by now.”
“You’ve been with Bruce until just
He gives a little at a time, drawing back and then easing in further. Steve’s just on the right side of too tight, his body giving just enough with each of Tony’s nudges forward. Steve exhales slowly as Tony slips deeper, whimpering when Tony finally seats himself all the way inside, his balls nestled close against Steve’s ass.
“Don’t gimme that, I’m not the one who’s been wearing the same clothes for three days.  Unless you want to stand naked in the laundromat tomorrow while you wash your horribly filthy disgusting jeans and disgracefully unfashionable shirt, you better suck it up and deal.”
“That…” Steve quickly tries to consider reasons for saying no, and apart from his perpetual awkwardness around beautiful women, can’t find any. “That would be very nice. How kind of you to offer.”
“You’re hilarious. I’ve never heard that one before.”
?” He looks at Clint skeptically for some reason, which Steve has no doubt would be evident if he had the slightest idea who “Babs” was.  Or is.
“Still looks pretty much the same though, doesn’t it?” Tony grins like he’s proud of himself for even thinking of it.  “C’mon.  You can afford it now.  You’ll have to borrow a jacket though, I hope they have something in Adonis-size.”
Tony pauses, sniffing the air as Pepper shoves a towel at his face.  He grabs it and wraps it around his neck, accomplishing nothing as water from his clothes still soaks the floor.
“What was that about mindless sycophants?  How did they get such a bad rap?” Tony decides against lighting the cigar now; he takes out his sunglasses and stows the cigar in its place. He’ll need it and a good glass of scotch in order to wind down after the development meeting; his budget man, Coulson, is intent on shooting down all of his grand plans purely on the basis of monetary concerns.
“I’m good here.”  Tony pops the last bit of crust into his mouth and starts in on another piece.  He lifts his foot and rests it on one of the bars of Steve’s stool, keeping his own chair from sliding as he moves.  They eat the rest of the pizza in companionable silence.
Though it’s the last thing he wants to do, Steve forces himself to get off the couch, awkwardly but carefully keeping his shirts clear of his dirty skin while also managing to keep his pants from falling around his ankles. With an undignified shuffle, he sidles by Tony and into the narrow bathroom.

He considers this when he sees Steve Rogers across a crowded piazza in Venice, so close yet far enough away that he can certainly escape his view and continue on unnoticed. He’s with that other man, the man who had the wings, and they stand comfortably close to one another as they exchange words, as good friends do.
“I didn’t say anything.”
“Oh, that’s right.  I made popcorn.  Which is brilliant, cause I’m starving.”  He snaps his fingers and heads for the kitchen.  “Steven, get changed and get back down here, we have a movie to watch.”
“Do me a favor, set up a meeting with Odin Borson over at the Citizen News for this afternoon. He still owns that whole set-up over there, doesn’t he?”
So all in all, keeping this about him and Steve and not
Natasha twirls the knife idly in her hand, the serrated edge evidently not a concern in her talented fingers.
Steve’s own reflection in the glass looks no better.  He hasn’t slept, he has barely eaten; he can’t really bring himself to care.
“I completely lost track of time.”
“Speaking of, why the hell are you awake at this ungodly hour?”
Tony locks the door behind him and sinks to the tile, burying his head in his hands. Pepper knocks and begs and pleads, but he ignores her concern like the ungrateful cad that he is.

Tony stands up, brushing dust from his dark designer jeans and stomping dirt loose from his boots.
“Just…fuck you, Stark.”

“That man’s idea of acceptable risk is ludicrous.” Tony is dumbfounded by the lack of reason in this whole situation.  “Is Steve going to be okay?  Tell me he’s all right.”
, but the thought crosses his mind that maybe Steve’s sick of being asked these things.  Like he’s a human time capsule only here to compare and contrast the now and the then.
“I can still hear out the other one, you know.” Steve’s sharp elbow pokes him gently in the ribs, sending Tony wriggling back. Steve’s body chases his, however, the curve of him settling between Tony's legs. The move is deliberate, and even though it sends a tingle of want darting up Tony’s spine, he holds Steve tighter to stop him from moving.
“You were the only person on
Steve closes his eyes, dropping his head to Tony’s shoulder.
“Yours,” Steve mumbles in agreement, but his lips find Tony’s. Before Tony has time to register confusion or worry, Bucky continues.
“You know how these things go. Unexpected business, the call of duty, etcetera, etcetera, what have you.” Tony waves Jan off, tipping his head back over the arm of the couch and making vague gestures at the ceiling.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but I was
“You think you know me so well.”
“It felt greedy,” Steve admits as Tony massages his thighs, spreading him wider. “Or I guess it felt greedy, afterward.”
“Only if you’re sure, Rogers.”
“Yeah.”  Tony doesn’t sound at all convinced.  He holds a hand out into the open, palm toward the sky.  “We should probably get back before the sky really opens up.”
Steve shrugs and Tony thinks he seems small for a man so large.  But then Steve sits up a bit straighter, squaring his shoulders and taking a deep breath.
He keeps kissing Steve until his cock goes soft and slips out, then Tony moves his mouth down Steve’s body and buries his face between Steve’s legs. He eagerly plunges his tongue inside Steve’s hole, lapping up all traces of his own come. Steve lifts himself up onto his elbows and buries his hands in Tony’s hair, sighing with unexpected pleasure. While Steve does this to him often, he’s always so surprised by how good it feels when Tony returns the favor, like he didn’t know his body could react so well to someone’s mouth
“I believe in magic.” Thor states and Steve hears both Clint and Natasha humming the Lovin’ Spoonful at the exact same time.  Sometimes he’s positive those two share the same brain.
“So.” Steve repeats, not looking up. He links his index finger through the handle of his cup and pulls it toward him, but doesn't pick it up. Tony sits back in his chair, one arm slung over the back and his legs spread open lazily. He hopes he looks casual, unbothered.
“To be honest, I'm slightly terrified that you’ve managed this for so long without FRIDAY noticing.” Natasha focuses on the screen, head tilting as if she’s curious. She makes a small, impressed noise as Tony presses Steve’s legs near over his head. “I almost can’t blame you for this, James.”
“Forgive me if I’m mistaken here, Natasha, but your writing partner just went to the office. Shouldn’t you be there as well? I was under the impression that was how this all worked.” He keeps his tone carefully casual as he searches for the carafe of milk. The glass is slippery with condensation as he takes it out and turns back to face his unexpected guest.
He wants to twine his life together with Steve’s, to feel his heartbeat and his breath as surely as if they were his own.
Steve lifts an eyebrow and nudges the box toward him, not saying anything more.  Tony ignores the pizza and tilts the bottle of booze back, reading the label.
Tony's words surprise him, and Steve accidentally knocks against the divider. Luckily, he doesn't tumble it over and expose his now mostly naked body to both Tony and Jan. Instead, he steadies the screen and peers at Tony over its top, as he's nearly a head taller than its rim.
The light from the dressing room spills out into the dim hallway and Steve can see Tony’s shadow as he moves about inside, can hear him puttering around. It quickly becomes clear that Tony is not about to join him.
“Look,” Tony holds up his hands in a gesture of surrender, as if Steve is already fighting him on it when in truth he’s still processing the words. “I’d be the first to admit that I didn’t want to go anywhere near that
“His girlfriend was British, Tony,” Pepper replies distractedly, her eyes sweeping the tiny joint for a sign of Steve.  “I hardly think he’d be lost over a little slang.”
The kiss that follows sends a shudder down Tony’s spine. Steve’s tongue and teeth lave over the delicate skin of his throat; in the mirrored wall of the elevator Tony can watch what Steve’s doing to him. The visual is as arousing as the physical sensation itself.
“It looks like those who were critically injured are going to make it, and Fury already has leads on the group that planted the bomb on the tanker.  It may even be corporate espionage, not political terrorism.  Not that that makes what happened any better, but there will be fewer global repercussions if that’s the case.”
“But you…You know this is Tony, right?”  He asks, gesturing to the sculpture.
Tony waits for Steve to come to him. He has Steve’s answer, but it still feels tenuous. This thing between them is the kind of tension that could snap as easily as it could vibrate and give. He doesn’t want to be the one to break it when it could just have easily bent Steve against him.
“Y…y-yes,” Steve stammers, forcing his eyes open to look at them both. Tony breaks rhythm with Bucky, thrusting harder. Bucky adjusts to follow him this time.
“Hill.  Who’s still alive?”
He stares at the ceiling and just breathes.  The darkness is comforting.  Maybe with a little time he could get used to this city – something in its swirl of color does tug at his artistic sensibilities, even if his brain is too cluttered at the moment to sort it all out – but that’s not going to happen tonight.
“Tony…”
“So you know Steve’s here?”  Bruce asks plainly.  Tony can’t imagine he’s such an easy read, but of all the new acquaintances he’s collected as of late, Bruce is the one who seems to be riding the same wavelength.
“I have too many, is the answer, but never enough.” Tony grins at him. “Happy could pick you up every day in a different car for near a month, I think.” Tony’s extravagance should repel him, but that smile sends a spark up Steve’s spine. There’s something about Tony that’s electric, something that makes Steve feel like his whole world is made dull by comparison. Even when he’s saying rude or obnoxious things that logically make Steve recoil, there’s part of him that just wants to hear Tony keep talking if only for the sound of his voice. “You drive, Steve?”
“I’ll be quick as I can.” Steve opens up the door and turns to go into his trailer. “I’ll just gather my things and be right there, Miss Van Dyne.”
“Sir, the helicarrier is not fully repaired-“
“I need you to stop looking at me like that.”
He’s slightly unsteady on his feet but he doesn’t feel drunk, exactly.  Alcohol used to go straight to his head when he was small; he knows tipsy and he knows sozzled. He thinks maybe he just
“Anyone else, I would’ve expected that, but you…” Tony sounds disappointed and Steve rolls his eyes, slaps his hand against the water.  The resultant splash hits Tony directly in the face, just as he intended.
“I really don’t know.”
The second photograph is in lackluster color, a modern machine-printed SHIELD-issued ID that renders the details of the man’s uniform barely discernable save the white star against the dark navy material. Rogers’ hair is blond, his skin pale, but the color of his eyes is not readable. He only knows they are blue because he has read it in the stats.  Nevertheless, Rogers looks nearly the same as he had in the previous snapshot.
Pepper pauses, her lips settling into a thin frown.
His eyes drift slowly closed.
*******
“I’m just saying, a little Armani never hurt anyone,” Tony scowls, flipping up the bottom of Phil’s tie with a flick of his finger.
seem to be appearing out of nowhere like they’re being teleported down to Earth, replenishing in flashes of blue light over a strange fissure in the ground somewhere near the northern border of Koreatown.
Jesus Christ. What, did he send you a memo?” Tony snorts. He stands up, needing a bit of space between him and his traitorous best friend.
“Why, you little punk.”  Tony uses his whole arm to sweep water in Steve’s direction.  Soon they’re both laughing and out of breath.
“And my work here is done.”  Tony grins, pushing up from his seat.  “Meeting at Chez Avengers tomorrow at three.  Pepper will remind you it’s at three, JARVIS will remind you it’s at three, but I won’t, because I’ll probably have forgotten it by then myself.  Wait, what time was it again?”
look being in the movie.”
Despite the rain, Tony is leading away from the mansion, going deeper into the park, and it occurs to Steve that he never asked Tony why he’d sought him out in the first place.
“I’ve been busy.  It’s hard to have fun when you have exploding arrows to design.  Well, okay, the exploding arrows were fun, but you know what I mean.”
“But that’s not really what you want, Buck.”  Steve stops him before he goes any further down this path.  These aren’t words he needs to hear.  He doesn’t want to traffic in
“And that makes me…what? Older? Bruce and Clint fit the bill there too – and yes, I know Clint’s real age, that Dorian Gray punkass freak,” Tony blathers on in his confusion.  “I may be the oldest but I’m by far the most immature, and I
Tony pauses at the ramp up to the Quinjet, looking inside at Clint, Bucky, Natasha, Bruce, Thor, each one of them curious and waiting.  He turns to Steve, clapping him on the shoulder.
Pepper levels him with a scornful stare, the one that just dares him to treat her like an idiot again.
Tony decides not to needle Steve right now, instead flirting amiably with Suzanne, the elderly waitress, and ordering the world’s largest coffee for himself and a glass of orange juice for Steve.
“Then we’re all good.”
“Now you’re mine too.” Bucky grunts, holding Steve tightly back against Tony’s body, pressing the three of them as closely together as he can. Tony almost misses it, but he hears Bucky biting back a groan as he comes, hot and wet, over Tony’s lower back. Steve moans into Tony’s mouth as if he’s the one feeling Bucky’s orgasm.
Tony’s hands latch onto his collar, his brown eyes finding Steve’s and holding his gaze. They smile at one another faintly as the numbers trip off their lips.
“I cannot believe these words are coming out of your mouth, Tash,” Clint chimes in with a snort.  “I never thought I’d see the day when you berated someone for not being a joiner.”
“I want to see him.”  Steve doesn’t realize he has risen from his chair until he sees all the faces around the table angling upward to look at him.
“Tony, why don’t you come upstairs.  You need to eat, and you need to get some sleep.”  Steve puts a hand on his shoulder and Tony hesitates weakly for only a second before throwing off the touch and stepping away.
“Can I get you a drink before we talk business?” Tony holds himself carefully back from reaching out and touching Steve as he moves past him and into the house. The smell of him – his cologne and his soap and something that’s just
Steve tells himself he shouldn’t be hurt that Tony’s walking away so easily and quickly, but he kind of is.  He stares after Tony, at a loss for what to do now.  He supposes he should leave.  It’s pointless to stand here alone.
…” Steve comes hard, one hand grabbing Bucky’s hip and the other reaching up for Bucky’s neck, pulling him down into a crushing but uncoordinated kiss that’s really nothing more Steve moaning against Bucky’s open mouth.  His orgasm is vicious, balls drawing up tight and his body pulling taut, the cords of his neck standing in sharp relief as he throws his head back, his fingers digging into Bucky’s flesh.
“Hands off, woman, get your own.” Tony squeezes in between her and Steve, waving his arms exaggeratedly to create space.
When he turns back, he finds Steve watching him intently with hooded eyes, teeth worrying his lush bottom lip.
“Damn straight I won’t stop,” he agrees, the adrenalin running through his body leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.  He heads to the roof, and after that it’s all a blur.  Practically, he knows at some point he suits up and flies with Bruce to the helicarrier, but the next thing he’s actually aware of is his bloody hand fisting in the lapel of Fury’s black coat as he slams the man into the wall, demanding to see Barnes.
“It’s nothing.”  Steve folds his arms again, glancing out the large plate glass window to his left.
“I had to go pick something up.”  Bucky comes to his side, surprisingly close, and sets the bag down on the counter with a grunt.  A package of Fifth Avenue bars tumbles loose.  Tony tosses it back into the bag.
He draws back quickly, guiltily, when he feels Tony’s gaze resting upon him, and casts an awkward glance his direction.
“Probably. Sucking up to the director seems to be part and parcel of this whole producing process.” Tony leans in, rising on the tips of his toes to whisper somewhere near Steve’s ear. “I’d much rather suck something else.”
“I can’t separate it out like that,” Steve refuses the question entirely, stepping away and out of Tony’s reach.  “And I can’t do anything about it.  It makes sense – their relationship is more recent.  She knew him as the Winter Soldier.  It has to be far less…traumatic to recall her than me.”  Steve looks at the floor, hopelessly forlorn.  “It’s easier.”
-- but maybe…maybe I thought you’d change your mind? That you’d be angry I actually did it.” Steve knows that sounds terrible. If he thought those things, he shouldn’t have gone through with it. But the truth is the fear didn’t strike until after it was done and he was back in his and Tony’s apartment, alone.
Condensation quickly obscures their reflections, however, and Steve wants to see him, wants Tony face-to-face. He pulls out and spins Tony around, lifts him up onto the edge of the sink.
He switches off the Led Zeppelin and walks to the edge of Steve’s table.
“I don’t care, Tony,” Steve mumbles and of course he doesn’t. But Tony’s tongue had just been buried in his ass and he’d licked the come from his chest, and Steve deserves better than that. He pulls away, ignoring the pull of Steve’s hands to bring him back, and stands up on unsteady legs.
Tony folds his hands on Steve’s chest and rests his chin on them, gazing at Steve’s face with blatant admiration.
Tony kisses him once more, leading him backward into the tunnel with the promise of his talented mouth. Steve lets the kiss break. He needs a moment without Tony’s touch in order to properly think this through.
“Attention on the fight, less chatter, team,” Cap interrupts sternly, but Tony’s already pinpointed the location of Bucky’s comm signal.  The sniper is on the roof of the Herald Square building itself.
“Doesn't matter. It's done.”
Now, however, Tony picks up the remote from the coffee table and switches the program off.  Steve stirs, the cessation of background noise enough to disturb his light slumber.  A ridiculous feeling of warmth spreads throughout Tony’s chest as he looks down at Steve, stretched out on the couch with a tattered copy of some Jonathan Lethem book open and resting on his stomach.  Fiorello is curled up on Steve’s legs, a purring ball of gray fur perfectly content to use Steve as his pillow.  The cat has the right idea.
“Would she like any help?” Steve offers, and Tony stares at him blankly.
He’s actually real damn good with all kinds of intimacy.
“No…just get us…get to the suite.  I just need…I need to sit down.”
“So I see,” Sam smiles gently.
“Why ever would you think I’m looking for anything else, then?” Steve is truly perplexed. Tony is taking another drink so instead of speaking, he shrugs his shoulders a little like the whole argument is of no matter.
“I do know.  Any reason you have to do it here?”
” Tony is obstinate. “I know this may not seem rational to you, but this thing between Steve and Bucky is bigger than Steve and me. It just is. That’s facts, and my denying that is not going to change a damn thing. These are circumstances that no one else in the world could possibly understand. They grew up during a time when they couldn’t admit how they felt, and then this frankly crazy shit with the serum and the war and their supposed deaths and both of them coming back all these years later and then all this shit with Bucky's memory...” Tony pauses to take a deep breath. “There’s no playbook for this. This situation has literally never happened before to anyone else in the history of all recorded time.”
“That you did, that you did.” Nick acknowledges, and sets about making another. He nods his head at someone across the restaurant, and it’s only a moment before a broad, familiar hand claps on Steve’s shoulder.
“Could’ve told us you were Plan B.”
“I’m aware.”
“He hates everything.”  Clint corrects.
“It’s not really any of my business,” Steve mumbles, ducking his head and rubbing the back of his neck.
“Dear, by raw material I meant
items in storage; she’s offered to reach out to Mr. Rogers on our behalf.”
*******
“I was also going to hit the ICP Triennial while I was up in that area, so-“
“For…” Steve makes a weak gesture downward, and Tony’s unsure if Steve’s apologizing for coming in his mouth, or just apologizing for coming full stop. “It’s…it’s been kind of a long time for me.”
Thor has rejoined the group on the lawn, kneeling beside Bruce and listening attentively as Bruce patiently explains the original purposes of lighting jack o’ lanterns.  He’s also lighting a third candle, trying to fit it alongside the first two in order to more brilliantly light the gourdian ode to his own love.
Tony half-wishes Steve would apply that tone to him, and order him to get his shit together.  Something about the way his voice shifts into Captain mode is just so damn effective.
Tony looks at his two friends as they fold their hands together in Carol’s lap. He’s genuinely happy for them, warmth spreading through him where only a few minutes ago he had felt cold and hollow. As he'd always thought, they make a beautiful couple, and he's never seen Rhodey look so content.
“I'll bet she has,” He snorts. “Tell me, Jan, how's Hank?” Tony quirks his head toward her, accusatory. Tony seems to be getting the wrong idea about him and Jan. Steve doesn't bother to correct him, reminding himself that Tony has no right. It doesn't much matter as long as Jan's unbothered.
He’s sitting alone at the bar of El Chapultepec, a divey looking Mexican-American Jazz club he let Steve wander them into, when Pepper slides onto the stool beside him.  She doesn’t look at all perturbed over the strange mix of Tex-Mex burritos on the menu and deep down delta blues in the air.
“I hardly feel like this was entertaining.”  It’s unbearably awkward; maybe they should shake hands or maybe he should just let Steve wander off or maybe he should walk him to the exit, he doesn’t know.  A long elevator ride to the ground floor sounds like a terrible idea.  Way too much time for him to say something else wrong.
Steve is wearing his new tuxedo.
“Everyone’s fine, Cap.  You saw us all, right?  Just some bumps and bruises.  Stop looking like that.”
Now that he’s able to focus more clearly, Steve stops and takes in the rest of Tony for the first time that morning. He’s already combed his dark hair, though it’s still slightly damp and he hasn’t used any pomade to style it into place. Soft strands are curling loose over his forehead. He smells fresh and clean, like luxury soap and expensive cologne, and suddenly Steve feels entirely self-conscious.
“I once knew a diminutive Italian assassin codenamed Armani, so I would have to disagree with you on that point,” Phil replies with a completely straight face.  Steve has
from somewhere.  He spent enough of his life refusing to run away that that’s one thing he’s sure of.   You either stand up and stay, or you run.
Bucky takes hold of Tony’s hips and uses his thigh to knock Tony’s legs a little further apart, changing the angle of Tony’s thrusts into Steve just slightly. It’s instantly clear from Steve’s reaction that Bucky has guided Tony directly to Steve’s prostate, that he’s now pressing against it with every pass.
“Surely your blind spot for this guy can’t be that huge, Nat.”
“Not you.  Him.”  Bucky points at Tony.  “
“Affirmative.  Even the Hulk said whoa.”
“500 square feet of not wrong ain’t much.”
“Come on you two, quit playing grab ass and get down here.  Thor wants pizza.”  Barnes calls back, and Tony sighs, pulling up the number for Ray’s and trying to decide if ten pies will be enough.  Fifteen’s probably safer.
“You don’t seem very worried for someone who thought his kitchen was on fire.”
action going.”
is a problem I can resolve quite easily.” Steve pushes up from his chair, his voice gone rigid. “I’ll see myself out. Good night, Mr. Stark.”
Granted, it’s the third floor he’s done this to, but property damage is easier to deal with than casualties so he’ll take it.
Natasha tilts her head toward Steve and raises one eyebrow, arching perfectly over the rim of her oversize 80s-style pearlescent-rimmed glasses.  The thick lenses are actually clear plastic; she wears them because she thinks they encourage people to underestimate her strength and beauty and overestimate her intelligence.   She insists it’s not a quirk but a careful calculation.
Bucky stares at him, wide-eyed, and wonders how much of that he heard.
*******
He hopes someone remembered to cover his rent for him while he was gone; he hadn’t exactly planned on being abducted and held hostage as a science experiment.  He suspects that if he followed the paper trail long enough, he’d find that the building is owned by SHIELD and his landlord is really Fury, so he decides he probably doesn’t need to worry about returning to find an eviction notice nailed to the door and his few belongings donated to the Salvation Army.
else, the only image coming to mind is Tony on his knees, sucking Steve’s perfect cock.
. Not walking in on Steve and Bucky after a few rounds have already been marked on the board.
.  Just the description makes him think back to sitting in the balcony at the Paramount, stealing sideways glimpses at Bucky, watching the flickering light play over his handsome features.  Occasionally Buck would catch him looking and give him a knowing smile like they were sharing a secret.
“Christ, Steve, I didn’t mean it like that.” Tony blurts, impulsively grabbing Steve’s hand, stopping him from going. Steve doesn’t jerk away, but he freezes at Tony’s touch, staring down to where Tony’s fingers wrap around his. “I didn’t mean…
“Mrs. Goldberg…” Steve sighs, laughing lightly before the rattling in his chest cuts off his breath. “Haven’t thought of her in years.”
“Don’t believe a word of ‘em,” Bucky says, and Steve has to laugh at that, interrupting the weird flirtation happening at his kitchen table.
honest.”
“I’m not expecting anyone...” Steve shrugs off Bucky’s arm and maneuvers his way to the door.
up from a dead sleep at three in the morning, the welfare of others would be the furthest thing from his mind.
“You put anyone else in that machine and that experiment would’ve gone sideways.  It had to be Steve.  And maybe my dad did realize that, after Steve was gone, that Steve wasn’t just some guy he beefed up into a super soldier but that a truly good man had willingly sacrificed his life for the world.  And maybe that’s why Howard was the way he was.  Because he got to go on living and Steve died and he realized too late it should’ve been the other way around.  Or maybe Steve had nothing to do with it at all, and Howard was Howard and that’s it.  I can’t pretend I understand.”
“Mission was a success, kind of.  No Zola, but he was definitely here at some point and had to leave in a hurry.  He left a lot behind.  We have new tech and information for you to sort through when we get back.”
“What exactly do you have in your pocket, Steve?” Darcy is asking him now, the conversation evidently rounding back on him. He’s confused by the question.
this dream.”
“Bucky is?” Sam leans forward, elbows on the table. He looks surprised. “In what way?”
Steve leaves behind the three men as they bicker over the precise details.
Steve schools his face into the best expression of wide-eyed innocence he can muster.
“Steve, I’m back.  Got you some new threads.” He calls over the sound of the running shower, flipping on the table lamp by the closer of the two beds.
“Just don’t like it there much, if you forgive me for saying so.”  Steve turns away from the fragmented view and back to his comrades.  “It’s not for me.”
“Sure.  After all, you
Steve glances past them toward the end of his street, eyeing the Manhattan skyline across the East River.  He can’t see Stark Tower from his place in Vinegar Hill, and for that he has to admit he’s glad.  Between Brooklyn’s own jigsaw of tenements, apartment towers and industrial complexes cutting sharp into the sky, all he can catch is a glimpse of the Empire State Building.  For a brief moment he can stand on his old street full of run-down three story homes and pretend it’s still the same city he once knew.
“Maybe I was waiting to see what side of the fence you came down on," Tony puts forth uselessly, not believing it as an explanation himself.  He’s Tony Stark, after all, and someone not liking him has always been a welcome challenge to convert them into the pro-Stark camp.  Or at the very least, an equally welcome opportunity for some steamy hate sex.
“Oh, we should go.”  He starts to get up, clumsily knocking his knees against the tabletop, pulling the checked tablecloth askew and rattling their empty glasses.   Pepper reaches out a delicate hand to steady him and Steve very nearly chuckles to himself.  Her support would be useless against his weight, but the thought is kind.  He steps clear and starts pulling off his borrowed jacket.
“You’re just in time for dinner.  Natasha made plenty.”
He remembers the cold nights in their tiny place in Vinegar Hill, when the radiator would clatter and sputter as it strained to spit out even the barest traces of heat, and he and Steve would huddle together in bed under layers and layers of blankets. Bucky would always give Steve the hot water bottle, and his best, thickest pair of wool socks that didn’t have any holes in them, and hold Steve close in his embrace. Those were the nights he could almost believe that Steve secretly loved him back and they both were too scared and too smart to say it aloud.
“Why she’s with me?  Please enlighten me.”
“No, do it, fuck my mouth,” Tony gets his hands on either side of Steve’s ass and urges him back in.
Tony stops in his tracks, shoes nearly slipping on the wet pavement.  He puts a hand out, steadying himself by grabbing Steve’s wrist.
Tony nods like his suspicions have only been confirmed.
, Tony –” Rhodey lifts a finger to sharply shut him up, the lewd joke dying in Tony’s throat. “What’s got you so pissed off and unhappy that you gotta take it out on my baby here?”
“Stark,
It’s a sad measure of how their lives are going that both he and Natasha breathe a sigh of relief when they find out that it’s Bruce – not aliens or Red Room or HYDRA or any other crazed maniac – that’s the cause of the problem.
“Elevator was taking too long.”
“You’re planning to stay in the movie business, then.” Steve still hangs back in the doorway. “I thought what with your prolonged trip to New York, that maybe you were getting out.”
A quick check of the playing schedule online and Tony has just the thing.
“Because when your best friend plummets to his death at the bottom of a snowy mountain ravine, it tends to stick with you.”  Steve says, a bit sharply.  He knows that Tony
“I don’t dislike her. She’s keen. Just not for me.”
“Steve.”  The other man just stares at him, clearly puzzling something out.  “What is it?”
certainly pleased with the rather expensive tab Tony’s ringing up.
“He offered; I turned it down. Bus suits me fine on the days I don’t take my bike.”
striking and beautiful.
.  I want to know what we’re walking into.”  Tony crosses to his main computer and works as quickly as he can, attempting to hack SHIELD’s mainframe.  The whole network appears to be down, like someone turned off the power at the source.  “Damn it.”
“Huh.”  Tony contemplates this for a moment, and then glances around the lab.  “Why was he down here?  Gym’s three floors up.”  Tony shoots Bruce a quizzical look.
Things must go roughly because he gets a few late night calls from Steve, telling him with false cheer that Bucky is improving but in the same breath asking Tony to please come back home.  Tony erases the voicemails and doesn’t return the calls.  Steve eventually stops and Tony feels worse about that than anything else.
“Clearly that’s it.”  Tony is skeptical.  He takes a small, wary step away from her.  Doing so gives him a better look at what she’s wearing, and he has to laugh at the t-shirt she has on under her bedazzled denim crop jacket.  “I still cannot believe you went to that show.”
.”  Steve whips toward her, hackles up.  The accusation is unfair, especially since Tony’s the only one who did any actual running.  “I left because I thought he wanted me to.”
Deciding to act like he belongs there, Steve is about to take a seat and force himself to relax, perhaps read an abandoned newspaper, when Tony arrives. He’s like a rock in a small pond, rippling people into motion around him wherever he goes. The concierge who had studiously ignored Steve’s presence approaches Tony quickly, offering to call for a car.
He can’t quite believe this is actually happening.
“I’m sorry, I just...”
“You better watch yourself, Cap, you’re starting to show a personality,” Tony warns when he finally finds his voice again.
“Tony,” Steve greets him carefully, setting down his bottle of water and trying not to wonder aloud why the hell Tony is here.
“The terms are…not
“I tried to find Dr. Ross earlier.”  Steve is choosing his words more carefully now.  “I went to the main lab, but everything was dark.”
think it’s quite strange. We should be pals, you and I.”
“Is your hand acting up?”  Steve’s concern is evident on his face, so much softer and thinner – just like it used to be – now that the effects of the serum have been reversed.
and he can’t be, not entirely.
“Hmmm?”
“And then I might have frozen him out when he turned me down.”
“We’ve got some of the reels in here, don’t we?” Tony had seen the box sitting along the back wall; he’d been purposefully ignoring it until now. “Slap one on. I’ll take one look to satisfy your insanity and then we can talk about selling off the rights to the highest bidder. Then at least
The doctor leaves him for a moment, going to the second ‘copter and efficiently pulling wires loose from the control panels.  She disappears from his view and he can only assume she’s doing the same thing to the third.
“What point would that be, Cap?  That our team leader avoids team headquarters at all costs?  That he ignores nearly every request to take part in social gatherings of any kind?”
“Hell, Steve,” Bucky gasps, grabbing his hand and pushing it away. Bucky quickly twines his fingers with Steve’s however, wanting his touch somewhere even if he’s too overstimulated for what Steve intended.
“Maybe everyone will stop hitting on you now.” Tony pulls back just enough to speak.  He sounds like he’s aiming for a joke but not entirely sure he’s not serious.
“Bow down to the gods of capitalism,” Bucky replies.
Someone bumps into him and suddenly his vision is going fuzzy.  He nearly keels over and when he lifts his head, Steve is bent down in front of him and doubling and tripling before his very eyes.  He tries to focus on at least one of them to tell Steve that he just needs a minute to get a grip on himself, but he can’t find the breath to speak.
“Tony?”  Steve is insistent on turning to face him now and Tony keeps his eyes closed against Steve’s concern.  A hand goes to the side of his face and Tony is helpless to lean into the touch.  “Tony, the thought’s never crossed my mind.  Why would you even ask that?”
“You gonna be okay when she’s on set?”
“Then that’s what we’ll do.” Steve agrees. Tony will agree too, he knows, even if Bucky is right about how awkward it will be. Tony will be blunt and provocative and Bucky will be defensive and he…well, he’s probably gonna be some weird, fumbling combination of stubborn and unsure that’s going to send Bucky and Tony all kinds of wrong signals he never intends. He’s going to have to do a lot more research between now and then so he can be better prepared for the discussion.
Tony pauses to consider it, but not for long.
“Nope.  Not a business trip.  Pepper and I…She’s taking some time off from…all of this.”
He thinks of sitting in his favorite coffee shop, warmth of a cup of coffee cradled between his hands fighting off the damp chill seeping into his bones. In his imagination, the bell above the door chimes, and, along with a gust of cold air and rain, Steve enters.
He surprises Steve further by dancing casually, expertly executing a pair of tap moves as easily as walking in step.  He ignores Steve’s flabbergasted look; he just winks and ambles on, continuing to hum the song to himself.
There’s a hint of a smile, barely breaking on Barnes’ face.
“Can have me now.” Steve reaches down and for the first time wraps his hand on Tony’s cock, giving his entire length a firm stroke.  Tony shudders with arousal, doesn’t miss the fact that Steve does too.
“I mean…thank you. For taking such good care of 'im.”
They’re a great group of people, and Steve should join them. He almost wants to. But he won’t.
After their rushed trailer tryst that afternoon, all Tony wanted was to make long, lingering love to Steve tonight. He's so tired of having to frantically steal every moment. But taking their time is not in the cards, and that's his fault. All he can do is make Steve fall apart, as quickly and as quietly as he can.
As Thor begins to demonstrate his method to Clint, the sound of a text message arriving echoes around the small group.  Everyone immediately pats their pockets, pulls out their phones.
Tony doesn’t wait for his answer before practically racing to get the menu from the bedroom.
Tony to be unhappy.
Tony abandons rimming Steve to watch Bucky ride Steve’s face, the movement of Steve’s chin and the arch of his throat signaling what he’s so eagerly doing.  Tony knows Steve must taste himself dripping down Bucky’s inner walls and he’s struck by the need to do the same, to taste Steve’s come on the flat of his tongue.
“They tranq’ed Banner first off, before anything else even went down.  It was a SHIELD agent, or at least someone dressed as a SHIELD agent.  They knew what they were doing and they sure knew about the Hulk.  But Bruce is alive and they don’t seem interested in him.  Whoever they are, they’re still here – and they’re looking for something else.”
“You get used to it. There’s a lot a guy can do with only one hand.” His tone is this side of lascivious but Jan delights in it, grinning around the rim of her wine glass as she brings it to her lips.
“Me.  You.  Vroom-vroom.”  Tony holds his arms out and rotates his fists like he’s holding the bars of a motorcycle.  Then he taps on the driver’s side door and bends over slightly, leaning on the side view mirror as Happy lowers the window.  “Hap, we’re gonna get something to eat down that way.  Wanna join?”
Looking in the mirror, it should feel irrefutable. He’s the spitting image of this “Bucky” Barnes, so much so that Steve Rogers believes it to be true. It’s not until he finds tattered medical records from his eighth year, haphazardly stored in the basement of his family doctor’s great granddaughter’s house, that he accepts his former identity.
“Or I can set you up a cot down here if you like.”  Tony replies.  Steve’s face must show his confusion at the offer because Tony clarifies.  “Since the gym seems to be the only place you ever visit.”
“’This douchebag’ is Iron Man,” he informs Bucky, hoping the man is at least smart enough to understand that Tony’s ability to kick ass ultimately far outstrips his.  “And I’m Steve’s best friend.”
“That’s not why people stay, Tony.”
“I…I don’t understand.  Bucky…?”
Bucky sits down at the opposite end, putting lots of space between them, but despite that his whole body is angled toward Steve’s.
!” Clint exclaims when he sees them, popping up from his seat on the couch like an excited child.  He’s holding a green shiny case with a cartoon ghost trapped in a red
, Stark, and let’s just get Bruce back safe and sound before he hurts someone.  You can gloat later.” Steve snaps.  Everyone looks at him, surprised at his sharp tone.  He ignores their stares.
Everyone gets out of his way.
Steve looks back to the long corridor. Tony is waiting with his hand outstretched.
Steve’s eyes open at that, long dark lashes fluttering, and Tony smiles as Steve’s gaze focuses immediately on him.
On the rooftop, he had been caught off guard by something, something strong enough to make him hesitate, make him consider, but he’d shrugged it off and re-focused his efforts.
rather - if he looked like his old self.  The one Bucky grew up with.
“Well, Tony, unless you’ve been holding out on me, no one has of yet invented teleportation.  So yes.  A few hours.”  She hangs up on him this time, but it’s not worrying.  He’d worry if she’d refused to come.
“A pale shadow of one.”  Fury shakes his head.  “Perhaps fortunately for us in this case, there’s only one you.”
He raises an eyebrow and judges her through the drifting trail of smoke.
He can see pieces of their past dwelling in the shadows between the shiny, modern, new buildings if he looks hard enough.  When he tries to hold on, it all slips through his fingers, but he knows it’s all there, somewhere.  Hiding.  Waiting.
He coughs, the sound of it echoing across the cavernous space, and Steve turns toward him, startled. Steve colors. Tony smirks.
true.” Jan kids.
“That’s hardly –”
a difference.  Yet it feels like he’s already cheating.
“Well, you’re not me. You're supposed to be better than me." Bucky's words are harsh with disappointment.
“Not the Stark Industries file, Tony.  The one in my head that features such brilliant gems like the two strippers in Reno –“
“Never thought what?”
“I know what I said, but it’s not like me to back down from a challenge.”
Tony watches the numbers light up on the way to the top of the Tower and contemplates how he’s going to pass this day away without driving himself crazy.  Even though he hasn’t the faintest idea what he’s going to say to Steve, he wants to say it
Tony slowly cards through Steve’s myriad sketches of random street corners, storefronts, restaurants, parks, subway stations…all the little things that are different from seventy years ago.  The koi pond at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the piers of the Southstreet Seaport, Gramercy Park beyond its closed gates…they’re all in there too, a little familiar and a little foreign. Tony pauses at a drawing of Grace Church, down on Tenth and Broadway.  He shoots Steve a puzzled look.
“Didn’t what?”
“Chelsea?” Tony supplies, grinning.
“Pepper, I’ll be right back.” Tony informs her distractedly, moving toward the door like a man in a trance.
Afterward he lays in Steve’s arms with their legs tangled together, his head pillowed on Steve’s broad chest, sweat and come cooling on their bodies and sheets twisted in a mess by their feet.  He doesn’t want to move, his mind and body for once perfectly at ease, contentment thrumming through his veins.
“Hmm, what’s that?”  Tony clearly fakes distraction, climbing up on the treadmill and fiddling with a few buttons.
His next thought is that Steve should not be out here, not when he’s recovering. He’s god damned barefoot, for Christ’s sake.
And he’d totally blown it.
“She talked me through many an asthma attack.  Believe me when I say I know how you feel.  How are you doing?  Do you feel better?”
“A statement.  What exactly was I ‘stating’?”
Steve is slowly dragged up from the depths of slumber by the feeling of someone’s fingers trailing delicately over the curve of his spine. The touch drifts down to the small of his back, up again to the sharp, jutting lines of his shoulder blades, and then retraces that path once more.
“Sorry, I was just…” He flushes faintly, shoving his hands in his pockets before looking up at the vaulted ceiling, back down the long hallway, clearly taking it all in.  He shuffles his feet nervously on the Oriental rug.  “This place doesn’t really seem like Howard.”
“I suppose,” Steve replies warily, looking past Tony to the door as it clicks shut.
“I’m fine, Stark, thanks.”  Steve mutters darkly as he drags himself toward the pond’s edge, his clothes a clinging, wet weight on his body.  Tony’s mood may have shifted, but his hasn’t.  He’d been perfectly all right not fifteen minutes ago and then Tony had to come down and ruin everything.  Now he’s wet and tired and upset, and Tony’s enjoying it.
“Wanton whore,” Bucky teases, though Tony’s not sure if it’s directed at Steve or him.
Laughter wafts from the apartment and Steve tilts his head toward the window.  He can hear them all talking, their chatter warm and inviting.
With his other hand, he takes one of Steve’s, twining his oil-stained fingers with Steve’s paint splattered ones.  He folds their combined grasp on the top of the table between their place settings and stares at his boyfriend’s pale lips, remembering how swollen and lushly pink they’d looked last night when they’d been wrapped around his cock.  He flushes with heat, thinking of Steve on his knees.
“Tony.  Do you really want to do this?”  Steve seems almost resigned, a frown already creasing his face.  “Because I don’t think I can manage it if you change your mind again.”
“It’s just that I’m really not that hungry, and Tony’s going to come back here any minute and drag me off for that bath of his.” Steve is attempting to sound disgruntled, but it doesn’t quite succeed. It still genuinely surprises him that Steve’s protests with Tony are more token than anything; that he might not even
Even with his eyes closed, Steve’s vaguely aware of a few telltale flashes of bright white light that mean photos are being snapped, but if Tony doesn’t care, he doesn’t either.
like anything, Stevie. You’re the one who ‘stank of booze and cigarettes’ and showed up here with hickeys all over on your neck and bruises on your hips.” Bucky gestures up and down Steve’s body with a pointed finger and Steve colors, glancing down at his waist and throwing a hand up to cover the side of his neck. For a moment, he thinks he’s been caught out, that Bucky
“Stark.”
“Most rules are,” Clint comments wryly.
He wants
That reminds him, Steve had mentioned wanting to try Korean barbecue as the 7 had rattled through Flushing the other night.  He makes the suggestion for post-battle lunch and Natasha cuts him off before anyone can answer.
“Go on then, go save the world,” she says.  Tony snaps the faceplate down.  He walks clear of the garage and yanks Steve closer; holding him like Superman would Lois Lane.
A few minutes pass before Pepper comes back in.
“Always for you,” Steve replies. “Kept thinking of you. Kept wondering what it’d be like if you were watching.”
“Hey.” Is all Steve says, corner of his mouth ticking upward in a small, crooked smile. He doesn’t look offended, or confused, or uncertain.
Tony still takes his first step slowly, looking around like he expects a last minute attack or an electric shock or some other kind of deterrent.  He smirks, unimpressed.
Tony shifts onto his back in the aftermath, Steve resting his head on his shoulder and his hand splayed out across Tony’s chest. He traces patterns there still, the way he used to idly play with the shadows and light when the arc reactor was there.
As he saunters forward, Loki runs a hand down the lapel of his deep forest green jacket, the fabric clearly lush and expensive.
“Well, apparently Stark’s going to be one of those parents who yell at refs from the sidelines.”
“I thought duty meant he’d be riding a desk!”  Tony shouts and beside him, Pepper winces.  “Writing briefs about what he remembers so other far more dependable and less
He doesn’t return to the table after visiting the cloakroom, handing in his jacket along with sincere apologies to the tired-looking attendant.
The engine actually looks great; at least Rhodey’s been doing something right.
Reaching out with his metal hand, he presses two fingers to the pages and draws the entire package closer.
“What was that?” Steve asks, and rightly so. Tony certainly hadn’t come to bed with the intent of getting off on Steve talking about Bucky, yet that was somehow exactly what happened.
“It’s you.” Steve doesn’t sound like he really believes it. Bucky relaxes into the gentle hand that comes to the side of his face.
For one brief but wonderful moment, Steve returns the kiss with equal fervor as if the response is automatic.  But then his hands are flat against Tony’s chest on either side of the reactor, pushing him back.  He doesn’t push hard, just enough to get space between them so he can get words out.
The doors smoothly open on an empty car; the lush carpet, ornately decorated walls and bright sconces a jarring juxtaposition with the rough, barely finished tunnel they’ve just left.
“Why would you read about that ever?” Clint is more dismayed than puzzled.  “Whatever it is, it sounds awful.”
Tony slides his hand over Steve’s shoulder as “The Nearness of You” begins – a tune he actually recognizes.  He had the Glenn Miller record; he doesn’t know who’s singing this version but her voice is warm and smooth.  Steve lets Tony arrange his hands back the way they were before, biting his lip to keep himself from protesting.  Tony Stark should not have to teach him how to dance; this is going to be embarrassing for the both of them.
“Bye, Tony.”  Bruce waves him off and brings something new up on the holo, his attention already diverted.  Tony opens his mouth to snap back but Bruce reaches out without looking, pushes a button on the desktop, and the door whooshes closed.
“Yeah,” Bruce looks surprised, and a little touched, by Tony’s question. “Of course. It’ll be nice to see her again.”
“Of course. Once your parents have a certain amount of money, you’re inducted into a secret club. Gold membership cards, velvet smoking jackets, dark-paneled dens of iniquity, the whole kit and caboodle,” Jan quips. “We sacrifice virgins at the end of every financial quarter.”
Pepper looks concerned.
“I can back that up with hard data if you want,” Tony tosses over his shoulder as he opens the door for Steve.  Steve pulls him outside before he can divulge anything further.
“That’s a nice thought.  Don’t know how true it is.”  He hands the cigarette back to Steve carefully, the stick half gone.
“You’d be wrong.”
The whole trip would’ve been a lot better if he’d been with Steve.  He realizes how idiotic the sentiment is, considering he’d gone to D.C. to
“Stark’s been holding you hostage?” Clint chuckles, next in line for a handshake.
Tony lifts his head from the pillow and looks up blearily at Bucky, who is sitting up against the headboard. He’s still naked, bed sheets loose around his waist, and his long hair is pulled back in a loose ponytail, wayward strands falling down around his face. He has a thick hardcover book cradled in his hands, evidently able to make out the words in the pale moonlight.
However, as act one pushes into act two, Susan Storm wraps her hand around Tony’s and leans her head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony stiffens at first, just a miniscule amount, but then visibly relaxes. Steve swallows down the bile rising in this throat, offers a quick explanation and a promise to return to Wanda, and climbs up from his seat. Leaving his own premiere is worse than merely looking bored, but if anyone asks later, he’ll merely explain he was in desperate need of some water and it simply couldn’t be helped.
“Um,” Rhodes starts as he draws back, and Tony can see it written plainly all over his face.
“I’m awake,” Steve mumbles drowsily, only shifting back toward Tony slightly instead of rolling over to greet him as he usually does when Tony sneaks in from a late night in the workshop.
“I…” Steve frowns, and it’s an expression Tony is very familiar with, having seen it on so many other lovers’ faces before. Disappointment. Regret. Doubt. Even if it wasn’t intentional, Tony had still stood him up.  “It’s fine, Tony.”
“Pretty sure that’s not how it works, Stark.” Steve shoots back and ducks out the door.
yell before.
“Fuck you, NKOTB was amazing.”  Natasha’s words have no heat, however, and her flat tone leaves Steve guessing if she really means it or not.  Months later, he still has no idea if she went to that concert to enjoy it or mock it.  “You have a cigarette?” She asks Clint, who obligingly flips open his pack of American Spirits and thumbs one up for her to take.
They take off into the night sky and angle for New York.  Tony fears what awaits them.
“Because this place is so much better,” Steve snorts. Their apartment is poorly designed, windows not allowing for any cross-breeze to circulate the air in and out. In the dead of summer, their rooms become a veritable maze of portable fans; small ones and big ones perched perilously wherever there’s a nearby electrical outlet to be found.
“You do not have Ebola in here.” He eyes Bruce, jokingly wary.  “Was that the Other Guy poking through and being an ass or are you finally loosening up?”  Tony jumps down from the table; Bruce returns his easy grin with a shy but pleased one of his own.
“Yeah, we've got this new widescreen project in development, something that's going to make those dinky small television screens seem boring as hell. Might even impress you, Rogers.”
is set in New York, right?”
“I’m amazed you’ve kept all that stupid with you after all these years, Buck.”
“You could have called.” Steve points out flatly, which Tony knows is reasonable, even if Tony had just told him he’d been lost in the throes of invention and clearly was not thinking about any real life practicalities like phone calls or dinner dates. “I know you at the very least have my number on all that contract paperwork, I wrote it enough times.”
He considers asking Steve if the train came through this neighborhood when he lived around here,
“I have a file that says otherwise.”
“And again, I don’t have the faintest clue what that means.”  Steve can’t stop his exasperation from bleeding through this time.
Pierce’s pattern of breathing changes, picking up ever so slightly.
This thing with Steve is twice as dangerous as Pepper thought and in a very different way than he suspects Pepper believes.  He shouldn’t be here.  He should forget it all and go back to New York, back to Pepper, and let everyone else deal with Captain America.
“Shall we find our seats, Miss Maximoff?” He tries to sound smooth and flirtatious, but the words choke in his throat. Wanda doesn’t comment upon it. Instead she takes his hand and leads him into the auditorium.
“Art criticism isn’t really my forte.”
.” Steve rests his elbow on the armrest and his head against his hand, tilting his face to look at Bucky across the length of the couch. He smiles softly at his best friend as the realization dawns over his handsome face. “Why do you think I’m here, exactly?”
. Below is a candid photograph of Tony leaving the party with Wanda Maximoff cozy on his arm. Her personal assistant, Pietro, lurks two paces behind them in the fuzzy background. He’s not much more than a shock of hair so blond it’s white, but Tony knows he’s scowling. Tony is grinning dopily, two sheets to the wind and winking at the camera. Wanda has her face carefully angled to show her better side, eyes downcast in perfect picture of chaste embarrassment at being caught with a lover. His wink to the camera must have helped sell that one.
“Not really the point, Pepper,” Tony replies as he sets the t-shirt and sweatpants on the checkout counter, along with a razor and some shaving cream, a couple bottles of water, milk and a box of cereal.  He tosses on a candy bar and a five-hour energy drink for himself, balancing the phone between his shoulder and ear as he digs out his wallet.
“Spike Lee night.”
have known this wasn’t a simple dinner between pals. Bucky and Natasha might not be together at the moment, but they’re still thought of as a pair by others, and that means that Steve was the only one invited that’s not half of a two. A setup was practically a foregone conclusion. “I may not have been told in advance but I can’t say as I’m surprised.”
different, y’know,
Correction. It’s been a month, and Steve has the flu
Steve laughs bitterly, boggled by how one person can be so utterly contrary, attacking him one moment and assuring him the next.
“Speaking of that, you better run because Tasha’s on her way over and we can’t
He releases a long, deep breath as soon as he’s in the safety of the bathroom, alone. It’s then he realizes he’s still holding the paper. It’s not the news, but one of those silly gossip rags that he never reads.
surprising.  I suppose this is where you should tell me that if I were less self-absorbed, I’d have noticed Happy mooning over my ex?”
“You’re a good man, Captain Rogers.”  She moves in closer to him, bumps him congenially with her elbow.  “Tony’s lucky to have you.”
These days he’s not that sure.
“How about…” Tony’s face screws up and he glances at the ceiling for a moment before coming back to meet Steve’s gaze. He sighs. “How about be totally honest, and I’ll tell you if you’re being a little
“Nothing, punk.” His anger sapped, he reclaims his seat alongside Steve, and glances toward the coffee table where the matzo soup sits untouched. “Guess your soup’s pretty lukewarm by now, after all that. Want me to heat it back up? It’ll just take a minute.”
He shuts Steve’s bedroom door carefully behind him when he tiptoes out to the hall, wincing even at the soft noise of it closing. The light is still on in the kitchen, Steve having forgotten to turn it off in their haste for his bedroom. Tony flips the switch, plunging the entire apartment into near darkness, as he passes toward the front door.
.”  Tony teases but Steve doesn’t placate him with a smile this time.  Tony leans back on the bench, stretching his arms out along the back.  He taps his fingers against the wood, giving him a silently appraising look.  “I get it, it’s cool.”
“So that moment’s over?”
“I actually have something to show Steve.” Tony explains, looking up as Steve walks into the room with perfect timing.  He’s fresh from the shower, clothes sticking a little to his damp skin.  Tony smiles at him, ignoring the double pull of lust and affection.  “I have something to show you.  Come on.”
“Probably Happy coming up the hill,” Tony guesses, though there’s really no way the sweep of his headlights would break through the trees here at the back of the house. But his property is guarded and gated and quite frankly, built into the side of a steep cliff, so he doesn’t know what else it could be. “Or lightning – maybe there’s a storm coming in.”
, he’d say, even though Steve knew Bucky didn’t need him to read the night sky.  Bucky didn’t need him for anything, really.  Steve’s the one who needed.
“Are you sure about this?” He forces himself to ask, shocked by how wrecked his voice already is.  Steve’s fingers flex and then tug a little at his hair before he lets go to use both hands to pull Tony to stand.
“I wasn’t going to go that far, Boss, but if you say so.”
Steve feels Loki’s eyes on him like he would a hand on his face and he has to turn away from Loki’s intense stare.
When it’s gone, Steve gathers the empty box and the still half-full bottle of scotch and he leaves.  Tony never gets an explanation as to what actually prompted the seemingly impromptu dinner, but he hadn’t asked.
“Fuck, I’ve
“No.  I used to think he was, though.  Before I met Steve.  Maybe even after.”   Tony shrugs, rubbing his face as he steps away from the window and from Pepper.  He needs another drink.
“I really thought I might never see you again,” Tony murmurs, tilting his face upward, unconsciously drifting toward Steve’s mouth.  Steve’s forehead presses against his and they hold each other like they did during that moment by the pond in Aspen, that instant when Tony had realized he was in way over his head with this man.
“Naw, I actually ran into Steve just now in Grand Army Plaza and decided to tag along.”
He leans forward, looking down at Steve as Steve sinks back against the pillows.
“Agent Romanoff tried that first off,” Hill explains tersely, readjusting her grip on Barnes’ good arm as the man shifts.
“Jealous. You get jealous. And then you beg him to take you along.”
“I’ve tried to get them to change it to my name, but no dice,” Tony comments when he notices Steve looking.  Steve runs his hand over the deep-set lettering, feeling the engraved ridges of

too earnest.  You’ll be exiled.”
He waves and smiles and poses until both his face and his feet hurt, until his tie feels too tight around his throat, until Wanda gives his hand a sharp squeeze and whispers through gritted teeth that he’s gripping her too hard. Steve mumbles an apology and unwraps his fingers from her arm; he really hadn’t realized.
Steve does, adjusting his blazer to hopefully mask the indecent bulge at the front of his pants. Thankfully, he’s not entirely erect, but even when he’d been small and delicate, that part of his anatomy had been disproportionately large. It unfortunately doesn’t take much for it to become an obscene embarrassment.
Steve’s smiling a smile that Tony has never seen before.
“We also have to have enough money to get the picture made. We can’t do that if we can’t get beyond casting.”
Steve smiles a little to himself, not expecting to have missed an AI but finding that he had.
“That should slow them down,” she states as she hurries back to his side.
He pushes open the door, and, after taking a split second to look up and down the hallway, grabs Steve’s tie. Tony winds him in close and backs him inside.
certainly differ.
.  We all have our day jobs.”
“Tony…don’t you think you’ve done enough?  You don’t owe them anything.  You certainly don’t owe them your life.”
“You already got the low down?  Steven Rogers, I never would’ve pegged you for a gossip.”
“We were actually lucky compared to the other boys – at least we were used to sharing a bunk more often than not.”
“Why not?” Steve traces the veins on the back of Tony’s left hand, reassured by the familiar feel of that jagged scar along his fate line that Tony got a few months back while repairing one of his cars. He knows these hands as well as his own.
“How archaic.”  Tony mumbles.  “Kick his ass for that, Nat.”  He pulls a metal folding chair from against the wall and unfolds it, flips it backwards, straddles it as he pulls out his phone and hits a few buttons.  “I’ll post it on YouTube.”
Tony mutters something under his breath and disappears into the bathroom.  He comes back a moment later, plastic glass clutched in one hand and a towel in the other.  He stops beside Bucky and drops the towel to the tile to sop up the mess.  He’s halfway toward bringing the glass to Steve’s lips before he aborts the movement and stutters back.
He had thought about telling Steve, once, when he got his call up and he realized he’d be going to war and might never come home. But he’d thought about doing that to Steve, putting that on him and then going off and
“It’s a date.”
“I know.”  Bucky shoves hard to push Steve flat against the bed and then, in a graceful yet frighteningly sudden movement, straddles Steve’s neck.  Tony can’t see what’s going on with Bucky’s body in the way, and despite the view of Bucky’s perfect ass, his first horrible thought is that Bucky’s strangling Steve with his thighs in some twisted erotic asphyxiation type of scenario.  He quickly realizes it’s nothing quite that kinky.
“Luxury condos and sushi bars, Chase ATMs and Norman Foster bull shit,” Natasha is still muttering to herself, stabbing her fruit.  Clint reaches over and takes her fork from her, shaking his head no.  “Seriously, Clint.  Whole Foods.  CBGB? Gone!  Yet there is a
watch
Tony swallows hard, his hands stilling on Steve’s thighs as Steve almost imperceptibly spreads his legs just that much wider.
“Cause that right there is gonna make it hard to focus.”
And there, standing at the edge of the crowd but still, somehow, seeming to be at the center of it all, is Tony. He’s beautiful. Breathtaking.
“What exactly are you sorry for?”
Tony’s hand shakes as he unlocks his door. He glances at Steve, hoping he hasn’t noticed the sudden bout of nerves, but he finds Steve gazing right back at him with this soft, open look that takes his breath away.
slide by without comment.
“Are you sure you want to hear this? This feels weird.”
*******
“Anything happens to Steve, I’m going to end you.” He means it.  More than he’s ever meant anything.
“Well now, I don’t know about that. From the look of you, Miss, I daresay you’re the kind who’d just as easily kiss me as kill me.”  He lights his cigarette and carelessly tosses his silver-plated lighter behind him onto his paper-strewn desk. It clinks against a half-empty bottle of bourbon.
“Yo, Stark.” Clint says sharply and when Tony looks, he flips him the middle finger.  Tony’s nonplussed.
But Tony’s prattling does distract him from the fact they’re not really pointlessly meandering; he realizes too late that Tony has a destination in mind.  Their journey ends at a ‘40s style swing club well off the main drag.  Strains of “Chattanooga Choo-Choo” blast from inside whenever someone opens the front door to go in or out.  Twenty-first century men and women go passed him dressed in styles that, for him, were current six months ago.  Steve’s past is a nostalgic curiosity for them, something to be put on for fun like a Halloween costume.
, is all he’d said, with a sad shrug of acceptance.  Since Steve hasn’t caught as much as a glimpse of Tony since that first night in his hospital room, Tony must be wholly wrapped up in whatever they’re devising to sort Bucky out.
“Oh, fuck,
He doesn’t even stop to think before he’s jetting off after them, nothing but a desperate need to
“One of the benefits of living out here is the privacy,” Tony announces his arrival, gesturing around to the broad swath of nothing that surrounds his oceanside mansion. “You might have a hard time getting a taxi.”
He’d stayed in the dressing room until he was sure Steve had gone. Afterward, he sat and stared at the empty bed with its rumpled sheets for a good long while, the silence of the hotel room oppressive with its loneliness.
*******
They walk in silence for a short while. Tony’s skin is itching, his heart beating slightly too fast. The very idea of Steve Rogers has long been a thorn in his side, a nagging reminder of everything wrong between himself and Howard.
, Howard would share bedtime tales of the Captain’s unfailing bravery and goodness.
When they hit the lobby, he breathes a huge sigh of relief and some of the tension in his body eases.
Steve shifts, looking behind him to find Tony on the other bed, sitting up against the headboard with his tablet propped up on his knees.  The screen casts a white glow onto his face.  His tie is loose around his neck, the top three buttons of his maroon button down undone.
“Anywhere you want.” Tony reaches and tucks a finger under Steve’s chin, gently tapping and tilting Steve’s face upward. “Anywhere.”
“Love you,” Steve mumbles back, half-asleep already, and Tony’s heart forgets to beat, then hammers twice as fast to make up for its lapse.
“That…is that recommended? The whole gutting and the rebuilding? Seems a little extreme.” Tony can’t help himself; he moves back in and peers down at the thin silver brackets and pronged knobs, held together with the tiniest of screws. Granted, he’s taken apart his fair share of equipment of all different types, but that’s him. He’s unsure of Banner’s skills.
“Seven, I think,” Bruce jokes wryly.
“I kissed him back, you know.  Did he tell you that?”
“So…”
“This is Steve Rogers as in
“So.  What are you even doing?”  Tony asks, well aware he sounds accusatory and combatant right off the bat.
Natasha stares at him for a good long beat.  Or at least Steve assumes that’s what she’s doing, as her sunglasses are so dark he can’t see her eyes.  But her face remains impassive and unmoving long enough that he almost asks if she’s all right.  Then she snaps back into motion, turning on her heel and heading off down the street.
“Too early to call, quit the chatter.”  The Captain's voice is in his ear and it feels eerily familiar.  Like the man’s warm breath should be tickling his skin, lips brushing his throat.
He’d asked Steve to move in with him the very next day, realizing he wanted Steve to hang and linger on everything he owned. He’d let Steve in, still half-expecting him never to stay, and even then he’d never been happier.
“I’ll have my guy Happy come ‘round sometime and give you a run down on all the dos and don’ts.  They’re all very simple, really, but he knows all the ins and outs and quirks better than I do.”   He looks around the room again, catches sight of Steve in the mirrored wall, and makes a mental note to get Steve some workout clothes that aren’t army issue slacks and thin t-shirts painted on his body.  Maybe a pair of loose-fitting basketball shorts and an XXL tee.  That’d be so much easier to deal with.
“How am
Steve looks at the sculpture, considering.  It kind of does look like fire.  If fire were made of steel.
“Everybody take five!” The 1st AD, Victor, shouts from somewhere out of sight, his loud voice echoing throughout the sound stage.
“Do you remember when they couldn’t stand each other?” Clint asks no one in particular as he snaps a picture of his food with his phone, then leans over to take a couple photos of Natasha’s plate as well.  He makes a noise of approval at the finished shot and nudges Natasha’s food back toward her.  “I think that was better, when they couldn’t stand each other.  Definitely.”
He turns back to answer Natasha, his thoughts already two miles away, and finds nothing but his own reflection in the heavily tinted window of the now closed car door.  The Lincoln pulls into traffic smoothly but quickly, leaving Steve alone on the sidewalk.
He doesn’t.
“You’re not going to believe me, but he started it.”  Tony replies and Pepper shakes her head, turns to go back inside.
“And how is Colombia this time of year?”
“Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.”
“Really, I’m fine. Tell Bucky and everyone else I’ll see them tomorrow.”
The national anthem is playing out in the arena, and Tony wonders if it physically pains Steve not to stand up and be respectful.  He peeks at him and finds Steve staring at his own hands, apparently not listening to the sounds outside the suite.  The glass rattles a little as the anthem ends and everyone cheers on the start of the first period.
“Yeah…okay, I don’t know what just happened there.”  Clint shakes his head at his two friends; Tony knows he just kind of wandered off into a world that centered almost entirely on Steve, but he can’t be bothered to care.  “But I can’t go either.  I was going to go check out the Rain Room at MoMA.  I think there’s an Oldenburg show too.”
He reaches out to shake Tony’s hand, and then, surprisingly, shakes Steve’s as well.
Doubled over, busting his gut, laughing.
He does a furtive headcount as he descends, footsteps light and fast, and comes up two short.  He knows where Bruce is but Tony is saved from asking after the Captain’s whereabouts by the opening of the front door.
Peter swerves from the little detour he took to think of Steve and Bucky in bed together and returns to thoughts of Steve and Tony. Steve sweaty and hard, bent over as Tony takes him from behind, to be particular.
Bucky lets go of Tony and gets his hands on the backs of Steve’s knees, bending Steve’s large body in on itself. He slips his palms up Steve’s calves and wraps his fingers firmly around Steve’s heels. Bucky has ample leverage to lift Steve’s hips and spread him open; all Tony has to do is push forward and slide inside.
“Until she figured a way to get you out.”  Bucky raises his voice a little sharply.  “Which she did.  And I think maybe you should rest for a while now, Steve.  Stark, why don’t you go see what’s holding up the doctor.  Just get Banner or Ross over here if SHIELD isn’t going to get their people’s asses moving.”
“Natasha, I really do mean it. I appreciate the effort but –”
“What triggered it?” Natasha asks Betty as they watch Bruce’s lab get thoroughly trashed.  To Steve, it seems more like the Hulk is throwing a temper tantrum than trying to hurt anyone; apart from looking their way once and letting out a single roar, he’s mostly confined himself to ripping apart the room.
“Besides that one, obviously.” He looks at her expectantly.
“Hey there, sleepyhead,” Tony murmurs, affection rich in his voice. “Dreaming about me?”
“Who?”
But that brief hope is all he gets.  Steve moves his hand from the back of Tony’s neck to the front of his shoulder, softly stilling Tony’s movement.  Tony opens his eyes to look at Steve; his eyes had been closed too, and he slowly opens them, long dark eyelashes fluttering.  Tony plummets into the storm swelling in Steve’s gaze, his blue eyes dark and clouded.
He and Bruce are going to build something, right now, and he’s excited to start getting his hands dirty.
get up and walk across the room at the moment. Absolutely, positively, not. No way.
The coffee cup breaks in Bucky’s metal fist, the white ceramic cracking like a fault line. The pieces hold together until he slowly releases his grasp, and then they clatter to the counter.
Tony digs his own hands into the back of his work chair to keep himself from going to Steve’s side.
“I promise, we’ll still be here when we get back.  The city needs our help.  Put on the suit.”
Bruce has slowly been perfecting the rushed algorithm that they’d thrown together during Loki’s attack; a few more tests and the system might be ready to permanently implement.
Nigel sorts through the large number of keys on his ring and selects one carefully. Steve doesn’t even
“God, Cap, who ran you over with a Mack truck?”  He bypasses Clint and Natasha, making quick time across the black and white tiled floor, and stops in front of the super soldier.  Curiosity always wins out over courtesy.  “I didn’t think it was possible for you to look this terrible.”
“You stayed.”
“I do like the new ending but honestly, to see myself on screen, this is a nightmare. I cannot imagine you enjoy watching, if you do not like this.” She gestures around to the hustle and bustle of the premiere crowd pouring in around them, some pausing to take in what is supposedly the world’s largest theatre mural, its pseudo-hieroglyphics depicting the “glory of Egypt” in basic primary colors.
“I don’t even know, Hap.  I was just looking at Steve’s sculpture, guess I lost track of time.”
It’s the third time today he’s come all the way down here to look at it.
, it seems. Within a matter of days the situation escalates into something near uncontrollable – an army of robots and an
“Hello, sir.  Welcome to Aspen.  It is good to see you are faring well.”
The blast of Los Angeles summer heat hits him like he’s walked into a wall. It’s a different kind of heat than June in New York – less muggy here, more space and fewer people – but the pavement bakes just the same. He ducks back inside and tosses his flannel and his tool belt to the floor, just out of the way of foot traffic. His things will be safe there for a while; these few days of preparation before a shoot begins are incredibly busy but they are less hectic, and the suits won’t be around to take a look at the progress until at least tomorrow.
“You have anything?” Tony murmurs against Steve’s skin when he slides a finger in alongside his tongue, and Steve nods. Steve’s still so hot and tight. Steve manages to grab a container of petroleum jelly from the bedside table drawer and Tony opens it eagerly, hands fumbling at the task.
“That really would’ve worked?”  Natasha quirks an eyebrow up at him, a hint of a smile playing at her full, red lips.  “I’ll remember that for next time.  Just.  Ask.”  Natasha rolls the notion over a few times on her tongue as if it’s a novel idea she’d never considered, and Steve realizes he’s being mocked.
They don’t speak as Tony guides them back through his bedroom, down the stairs, across the vast foyer and out to the driveway. Happy is indeed idling in front of the garage, turning his headlights back on and stepping out to circle around to open the front passenger door as he sees Tony and Steve step outside.
have a name?” Rhodey asks, catching on the carefully chosen word. Tony glances over his shoulder, surveying the hangar. Their voices will travel and echo. “Tones, we’re the only ones here. And you know I’m not going to judge.”
He starts to turn, pull away, but Tony tightens his arms, holding fast.
"  Steve thanks the cover of night for hiding his furious blush.
“Steven Rogers.” His name slinks of Loki Laufeyson’s tongue like liquid silver, just dripping with smug superiority. “Fancy meeting you here. I heard you had a picture going on, was I wrong?” He smiles slowly as he takes one step closer behind him.
“Might I direct you to your quarters, sir?”
“I really don’t, Tony,” Steve sighs this time, but then leans back in his chair. He makes a gesture at the screen. “So was that shot of me an outtake from when I find her in my office, back at the start?”
“Natasha?” Steve scoffs. “Have you ever tried to pry anything from her? She’s not going to say a word.” It never even occurred to him to try asking her, the idea is so ludicrous. “Besides, I wouldn’t want to put her in the middle of anything.”
…isn’t that right, Steve?”
“I’d rather know, Steve.”
He pauses in the foyer and attempts to capture his breath, to re-gain some sense of composure before going outside.
“The last one didn’t feel all that useful,” he comments, but Steve shrugs and pockets it anyway.  Tony sighs.  “I guess I’ll go if you want to.  Maybe in ten years when we go shopping, we won’t have to keep checking all your favorite soy products to see if they’re still non-GMO.”
“And that never used to bother you.” Tony retorts, raising his eyebrows at Bucky. He stops beside him, facing him, and leans one elbow against the railing. “But now it does. Why.”
“Want to get rip roaring drunk?”
“Thanks.”  Steve doesn’t really know what he should be doing now.  What he really wants to do is go to the lab.  Not because he’s eager to know where things stand with the Bucky issue – which he is – and not because he knows Dr. Ross is there and he owes her a great deal of gratitude – which he does.  Out of all the reasons and excuses, the only one that’s one hundred percent true is that he wants to hear Tony’s voice.
Steve is in the small area by the windows set aside as his makeshift studio, his broad back to Tony as he leans in toward the large canvas.  He’s wearing his favorite shirt for painting, a stretched and faded Sonic Youth tank that he’s had since he was a teen, and the loosest and oldest pair of jeans he owns, back pockets torn and knees ripped, edges frayed.  Paint, charcoal and dirt seem blended right into the dark denim.  Tony watches the muscles in his arms shifting appealingly as Steve makes broad, sweeping brushstrokes in bold red.
“Geez, Buck…” Steve mutters, frowning as he sets down his pen and then bends to pick up the newspaper from where it tumbled onto the ground.  He curses the black smudges on his formerly pristine drawing that the newsprint left in its wake.  Steve pushes back from his drafting desk and swivels to look at his best friend, feeling decidedly unfriendly at the moment.  “That was two hours work.”
“Well…” Tony clears his throat, plotting a swift subject change.
It’s Pepper’s turn to roll her eyes.
“That, and it’s a highly classified op.”  Fury adds, his one eye flicking toward Natasha in an unspoken warning.
“Little confused here, Tony,” Steve finally manages to eke out, his hands coming to the front of Tony’s shoulders, the action causing Tony to freeze.  Tony backs off slowly, licking his lips as he carefully seats himself on the opposite bench.
The last thing he recalls is being rescued.  Maybe.  Right?  A woman had got him, somehow, into a helicopter.  He doesn’t remember why she was trying to save him, or who she was.  But this place he’s in now, it doesn’t feel like before.  Nothing is prickling underneath his skin and leaving him unsettled.
“Yeah. Moment’s over.”
They certainly won’t have it easy, but at least their relationship is legal in most of the northeast, and California now too, as of last year.
He considers protesting but she starts the engine.  The blades whir to life but they don’t drown out the new addition of ricocheting gunfire.  Dr. Ross swears under her breath and starts flicking switches and checking controls with a more assured competency.  Grace under fire, he thinks as he feels the helicopter shift as it rises, that moment when something goes from dead weight to airborne.
Natasha leans forward slightly, looking at Bucky as he slowly walks from the house and comes toward them.  She raises her eyebrows at him and the corner of his mouth quirks upward in that tiny, unforgettable smirk that’s solely his own.
Steve Rogers. His hair is in disarray, his tie pulled loose and his shirt hopelessly rumpled, his suit jacket barely hanging off his shoulders. Even in the dark of the room, Tony can see the color high on Steve’s cheeks, the way his lips are red and swollen from both the force of their kisses and from biting back his moans. His pants and underwear are pooled around his ankles, covering his shoes. It should look silly, but his cock is still half-hard between his front shirttails and all Tony wants to do is get back on his knees.
“You should tell me about Brooklyn,” Tony says again. He doesn’t address Steve’s question aloud, instead sitting up in his chair and reclaiming his glass of wine. The reflection of candlelight dances in his brown eyes. “I grew up in Manhattan, so you’re basically from a foreign country as far as I’m concerned.”
“Everything.” Tony shrugs, tugging at the too long sleeve of the black sweatshirt he’d borrowed from Steve’s locker.  “Nothing.  I don’t know.  I’m not really happy, I’m just…” He mulls it over, trying to find the right words.  “I’m glad we’re going home.”
“Of course it’s an illusion.”  Steve looks at him straight on and blank-faced.  It leaves Tony frankly puzzled and frustrated.  He takes a breath and puts his palms together, pointing his fingers toward Steve.
When he sees Steve’s glassy eyes regain their focus, Tony dips his head and licks Steve’s release from his skin. The tang of it coats his tongue. Steve’s hands tangle in his hair loosely, his body softly urging up to meet Tony’s searching mouth.
Tony looks at him, clearly at a loss as to what to do now that he’s given Steve the nickel tour.
“I think I’ve made it pretty clear that I’m up for a threesome,” Tony replies, laughing lightly. “I‘m thinking that’s not what you mean, exactly.”
“Buck?” Steve twists to look at her as she disappears behind the dressing screen. “He and Tony don't get on much, but truth is they've barely met but twice.”
,” Jane suddenly admonishes, capturing everyone’s attention.  Thor is serving himself up a monstrous plate of lasagna, the piece covering the entire plate edge to edge.  Half the pan is left empty.  He already has a forkful in his mouth, making happy noises as he chews and swallows.
“What?” Steve asks quietly, waiting.  He brings a hand up and places it over Tony’s forearm.  Tony lets out a long, deep breath and closes his eyes.
, but he can’t get the words out, doesn’t even know what the words would be.  Steve glances toward the exit and when he turns back, his face is closed down, his expression shuttered.  “We should…I can fix you something.  You need to take better care of yourself.  Pepper…Pepper will be upset when she gets back.”
and now…” Bucky gasps a desperate breath as the balcony door opens and Steve steps out into the freezing night, a look of concern on his beautiful face.
“Like the good china,” Tony mutters.
Behind him, the casting footage starts to be rewound; two reels whir whip fast.
Now it feels different.  Steve’s silence isn’t passive-aggressively antagonistic or the slightest bit standoffish.  Tony doesn’t even get the sense that Steve’s withdrawing, locking himself inside his head with thoughts of Bucky and other ghosts of his past. He’s warm toward Pepper, pleasant toward Tony, and the rest of the time he’s just…quiet.  And calm.
“Nope, that’s not it.”
“I want you to take me like you said you would,” Steve says, voice rough with want, deep and rumbling. His words vibrate through Tony like the aftershock of an earthquake.
like this guy.”
Bucky comes back in, free of toothpaste and fully clothed.  He runs a towel over his damp hair, the joints of his mechanical arm quietly whirring.  He looks Tony up and down, his gaze damning.
Steve turns back to Tony, caught off guard.
“The organization that has been controlling me all these years, they came after you.”
“You don’t know I wasn’t panicking.”
“Ah, yes, the name sounds vaguely familiar, I think Fury might have mentioned you in one of his ragey ramblings but I tend to drown those out if and when at all possible.  I’m guessing Fury told you to drop by?”
“I think you’re being hard on yourself,” Jane shrugs. “Bucky wasn’t helping, and Darcy can be a bit overwhelming. Perhaps Natasha and I should have given you a
The music isn’t coming from the record player, however, which Tony realizes means Steve must be busy doing something dirty with his hands.  It’s the only time he opts for the iPod dock over vinyl while at home.
And isn’t that just…well, he doesn’t know what it is.  It’s something.  He swallows down the defeat of Pepper anticipating this phone call and focuses on the gratitude welling up to take its place.
Tony has given him a confidence in this body that he never felt before, but he still blushes under the intensity of Bucky’s heated gaze. Bucky’s eyes drift down and then back up, his breath hitching as he takes in just how hard Steve already is for him. His mouth hangs open for a second, and then he licks his lips and swallows hard.
“I found their new album underwhelming, James,” Natasha states, looking like her estimation of her quasi-boyfriend is withering with every passing moment.
“Tony is waiting for you to put a name to it.” Pepper states, as simply as if she were informing him of a shift in the weather.  Steve’s gaze snaps up toward her, surprised.  “I think…he’s attempting to be respectful of whatever you’re working through with James Barnes.  He doesn’t want to force anything before you’re ready.”
“No. I mean, yes, but to say he worked for my father isn’t really accurate.” Rhodey starts to cut in, not about to debate the finer points of the matter when there are clearly a lot of bigger things to discuss. Tony stalls. “Accuracy is important, I’m a scientist, you know this.”
Steve has everyone’s attention now.
“So…no then.”  Steve sighs, disappointed despite himself.  He’d figured on a denial, but he’s tired of quippy blow-offs.  It’s as if he’s standing still while Tony does figure 8s around him at high speed.
Tied to this wildly disparate group of people now scattered across the globe – the
Tony won a few games in Luna Park, happily shouting “Science!” whenever he outsmarted what was rigged up.   Steve’s been carrying around a Hulk plushie for half the day as a result.
Steve feels sleep tugging him back under, pulling at him with insistent fingers.  He doesn’t want to go.  Bucky chooses that moment to turn back, satisfied that the agent has gone to get him medical attention, and it’s enough to keep him awake.
He visits forgotten corners of Brooklyn and far-flung places in Europe, re-tracing steps taken over seventy years prior.
“Was it the noise?” Tony asks, and Steve wonders how he knows what this is and what may have caused it. But he only wonders for a moment.
“Performing a scan for your preferred titles, I find that
Bucky winces slightly as the head slips through the last ring of muscle, leaving him empty and open. Tony unconsciously licks his lips at the sight of Steve’s come trickling down the backs of Bucky’s muscular thighs. He can’t stop himself from stepping toward the bed as Bucky relaxes down beside Steve, stretching out and resting his flesh-and-blood hand on Steve’s flat stomach.
“Bucky
implied.
“I’m fine,” Steve protests weakly as Tony sits down, leaving only a foot of space between them.  He leans back, throws his legs up on the coffee table and his arms across the back of the couch.
Tony tries to stay focused on Steve and Steve alone as he comes untouched, balls drawing up tight and the base of his long, beautiful cock visibly pulsating as Steve pushes out thick ropes of come all over his chest and stomach.
“Well, I never needed a flashlight,” Tony says, smirking.  “But it really made getting to sleep a bitch.”
Too much drink makes him overdramatic.
“Did I miss something?” Tony asks, pointing between Steve and Natasha.  Steve doesn’t bother with a reply.
But he’s a little bit drunk, and the thought would have never crossed his mind if Tony had followed through on their dinner plans. He wants this thing with Tony, even if it’s not easy. Even if Tony apparently doesn’t care quite as much.
*******
“Ok, I realize that half an hour at dinner isn’t exactly ‘long before,’ but still.” Tony chuckles, but Steve doesn't echo him. Tony squeezes a little at his waist, a gesture that Steve thinks is meant to be reassuring. “Come on, Steve. I
“I am of course happy to oblige. I think you’ll find our wine collection most impressive. We will need to go down to the lowest level, so if you’ll forgive the short walk?”
is no longer the highest the bar he can reach for.  He’s shot right past it and landed in
“Yeah…I have a feeling Natasha hasn’t been drunk since she was twelve.  At least.”  Tony chuckles, pointing at Steve knowingly.  “She certainly knew how to work you.”  He lifts his phone out of his pocket and hits a few buttons on screen.  “I’d like to know how they got JARVIS to notify me that the communal kitchen was on fire, though.  That’s a pretty neat trick considering it’s my own highly classified programming.  It had to have been Bruce.  Quite the duplicitous gang of friends we’ve got.”
“We can try.”
“I hate to interrupt your little tea party but it seems Stark’s back in town.”
“Was Barnes in on this?”  Clint asks, whipping toward the unconscious man and pulling an arrow, as if Barnes might be faking and will rise to attack them soon as their backs are turned.  Natasha shakes her head, grabs Clint’s arm and turns him back.  The truth is dawning across her face and Tony wishes she’d say it already, whatever it is.  “Nat, what’s wrong.”
a computer, basically.”
Tony pulls himself from his thoughts and focuses on the present rather than the past.
“Why’d you hire her? I mean, she does that kind of stuff. It’s not exactly hard-boiled detective fare.” He points over his shoulder to the monster movie one-sheets, which make a lot more sense now that Tony knows his connection to them. They did seem a little low brow for a cinematographer of Bruce’s caliber.
“Thank you, Pepper.”  Bruce bites the edge of his thumb as his gaze ticks from Pepper to Tony and back and forth again.  He seems to be waiting for Pepper to do something more than stand there and watch Tony pace.
about the whole thing.”
His friend doesn’t seem at all confused by the vague statement, which might bother Tony just a bit.
Steve’s own belt is still undone, the button of his pants unclasped. All that’s left is for Tony to tug down the zipper.
that man.  And no one wants to dance with that man.”
As soon as Tony’s inside, Bucky slams their bodies close, reaches for Steve’s shoulders and pulls Steve back so he’s kneeling, his back pressed to Tony’s front. Bucky’s plastered against Tony’s back, holding him effortlessly between his body and Steve’s.
“Pretty hard to tell.  They’re both locked up until it wears off. Natasha’s with Steve now.”
Tony hesitates, a flicker of
!” Bucky doesn’t give Tony time to reply to his filthily possessive question, just lets go of the tight hold he’d had on Tony’s cock. Tony loses it near instantaneously.
“I am the first to admit that do like to stand out,” Loki replies. He turns and leans against the marble countertop, so close to Steve that the strong scent of his cologne tingles Steve’s nose. “I was hoping I would run into you, you dear thing.” He walks his fingers across the countertop and taps the back of Steve’s hand where he still leans against the sink.
like that about him, but it’s easier to enjoy when Steve’s bluntly challenging someone else, like Fury or Hill.
Steve picks up the hem of his shirt and pulls it away from his body, twisting and squeezing from the fabric all the water he can before coming in.
Pushing the waste of a project he’s been failing on all day off the holo desktop and into the trash, he shuts the screen down and storms out of the workshop.  He doesn’t come back.
ago,” Jan remarks, turning back to Steve with an arched eyebrow at the ready, as if to sarcastically say,
Tony zooms toward the dark figure, coming to a quick but graceful upright halt directly in front of Bucky’s line of sight.
But he’s the only person who has
“What brings you here, Jan?” Bucky asks, shooting a look at Steve over her head that really directs the question at him.
He had killed Tony’s parents, and for Steve's sake, Tony attempts to offer a forgiveness he cannot actually deliver.
Bucky pushes at a jagged slice of the broken mug with one of his flesh-and-blood fingers, the rough point digging into his skin and drawing blood.  Natasha takes it from him, wordlessly gathers up the other shards into another clean towel and then shakes them all into the trash.
“You know, up until five minutes ago, Bruce, I didn’t even know you
Tony spends the rest of the night there, falling asleep slumped at the base of Steve’s sculpture.  He wakes up to Happy’s confused face, bending down over him as he’s jostled awake.
“Ok.  Well.  Pepper says dinner’s at seven.”
“Wow.  Absolutely
It’s silly, but some days when he’s feeling a little rough, he treks to the sets that are designed to look like New York City. Luckily, Stage 30 isn’t that far from “Brooklyn” so he won’t spend too much of his break today making the walk. They’re shooting some De Havilland picture down at the end of the avenue at “Washington Square,” but he avoids getting in their way and finds a stoop on which to cop a squat.
“Well, I sure as hell need one, so come on in while I mix something up.” Tony blurts and turns away from Steve’s impassive face.
“I didn’t have a plan.”
He doesn’t make money by finding more effective ways to kill people, for one.
Tony waggles the razor in front of Steve’s face and takes a step back.
Then again, he made and subsequently ignored that exact same argument before. That’s how Steve wound up here tonight in the first place.
“Can you get in?  I really don’t think I can lift you.”
The water is washing away the evidence Tony left on his skin; Steve grabs the soap and scrubs away the rest of the flaky streaks of come on his stomach, and where it had leaked from inside his body and dried on his inner thighs. Doing this only makes him harder, and by the time he’s washed his hair with the shampoo that smells like Tony, he’s on the verge of coming again.
“Okay.”  Tony takes a deep breath, totally out of his depth.  He considers calling Pepper and asking her what to do, but calling her in front of Steve doesn’t seem right and he doesn’t want to leave Steve here alone so he can call her in private.  He starts composing a text message to her using Extremis but gives up, not knowing how to explain this whole mess succinctly.
“Nevermind, there are just too many dirty places to take that, I can’t choose just one.”
“I’d like to say I had the faintest idea about anything, Buck, but to be honest I’m probably more lost than anyone else.”
Steve, he barely knew. Steve, with his broad shoulders and tight ass, those blue eyes and that deep voice, and that fucking beard…
When they’re finally seated at their table, Tony heaves a sigh of relief and apologizes.
“Not.  Helping.”  Natasha grits out, and then focuses her attention back at on Steve.  “Really, Cap, what’s it going to take to get you up in the tower?  Another world crisis?”
Tony swallows around him, taking him deeper, and Steve groans out Tony’s name for the very first time. It’s the most arousing sound in the world.
Steve can see it now, Tony building a small bot to clean out the inside of the pumpkin and then using the holo to project an intricate design onto the curved surface, maybe using lasers to precisely carve out an elaborate image.
As much as he associates the house with his parents, he also associates the house with the flesh and blood Edwin Jarvis, and that gives him a certain sense of security.  Until he’d met Rhodey and Pepper, the old man had been the closest thing to real family he had.
He always thought Natasha was just quite adept at reading him, but maybe all women are this remarkably astute and he’s simply never been around them enough to realize it.
The only thing about leaving a trail is that a trail can be followed.
Tony ignores the niggling sensation in the back of his mind that keeps insisting that the issue with the serum should trump his personal matters.  He takes Pepper in his arms, forcing himself to focus instead on the feeling of her slender body fitting against his, her skin warm beneath his fingertips.  Her hair smells like lavender.
He starts to roll over to face Tony, to make things easier, but is stopped by Tony snuggling into the bed behind him, sliding one arm underneath him and the other over his waist to wrap firmly around Steve’s middle. He pulls Steve back toward him. He likes doing that now that Steve is small, now the he can move him easily. Steve submits, sinking into Tony’s embrace with a contented sigh.
“We’ll get him back, Tony.”  She says, and he almost tells her not to make promises that can’t be kept, but she knows the hard truths better than anybody.  She catches his gaze, staring into the bright lights of his faceplate as squarely as she would his real eyes.  “We’ll get him back.”
“Do it,” Steve says and Tony dips his head, telling Steve with his kiss that he certainly will.
“Well, they might say they don’t, but trust me, they do. It’s the equivalent of Page Six out here.”
Tony takes the phone back reluctantly, staring down at the log of missed calls—
“Right.”  Tony snaps out of it.  He’s halfway into the MARK VI when Pepper hurries into the lab barefoot, evidently having ditched her heels somewhere along the way in the name of expediency.
. So I broke a few dishes. People have accidents. Leave it alone.”
Steve musters up everything he’s got and climbs into the helicopter.  His body protests, muscles screaming.  His teeth cut into his bottom lip as he holds back a pained grunt.
“Something like that.” Pepper tilts her glass at him again, and he obliges her by matching her, taking a sip of his own drink.  “So…why don’t you stop having distracted, half-assed conversations with empty-headed models and go save Tony from his distracted, half-assed conversation with that empty-headed actress.”
He has his arms crossed over Steve’s chest and Steve lifts one of his hands to rest on Tony’s right wrist. His long fingers are colder than the rest of him, poor circulation taking its toll.
- all I’ve ever done is tear things apart to figure out how they tick, but you, oh no,
The mirror is fogging up, and Steve reaches out to wipe it away. His reflection is blurry from the streaks of condensation. The room is muggy with steam and when he breathes, the air feels warm in his lungs. His skin is flushed and he’s starting to sweat, but he thinks that’s as much from his private thoughts as it is from the heat.
Clint grunts at Tony, annoyed by the slap, but he softens and offers Steve an apologetic smile.
“And I’m talking about Steve Rogers, out there, somewhere, completely at the mercy of a band of lunatics who want to break him apart just to see how he works.”
He watches Tony now as he stands up, announcing he’s going to the kitchen to grab more beer and he wouldn’t be bringing any back for the lazy bums who invaded movie night.
“Uh, um, what?”  Bruce blinks, head dropping forward and then jerking back up, stumbling clumsily into alertness.  “Sorry, I-“
“I’ll give Happy a ring. You can go on out without me, if you want.” The far wall of his bedroom is floor-to-ceiling windows, with the exception of one glass door off to the right side. Tony picks up the receiver and points toward the exit, but Steve doesn’t move. Tony frowns at him, finger still stuck in the first number on the rotary dial. “What, you don’t trust me to call you a ride? Unless my tying you up and taking you hostage is a fantasy of yours, I have to say I’m a tad offended.”
Tony’s kiss stops Steve from protesting; if he’s about to defend Bucky’s honor, Tony doesn’t want to hear it.  He has things of his own he needs to say.
“One of these days you’re going to listen to me.” Steve murmurs, and something like relief washes over Tony.  He reaches up and pats Steve’s dirty cheek.
Tony shakes himself from his thoughts, realizing he’s been silent for a good couple of minutes, his hand still covering the glass he’d placed between Steve’s fingers and his vacant gaze still seemingly trained on Steve’s face.
“Fucking fuck.  Where are the stairs?” He demands.  Tony doesn’t say anything as he points toward the other exit.  Bucky mutters his whole way across the room.  “I have no idea what he sees in you.  Natasha warned me – Always been hopeless, getting his heart crushed – damned fool, I don’t even-”
“Barnes has been regaining his original memories.  He’s scared, and confused, and he is doing what he believes is right,” Natasha retorts harshly, glaring at Tony.
“Well cheers to Tony, then.” Bucky clinks his wine glass to hers.
“Acts his age.  He’s been through a lot, yes, but not like Steve.  Sam’s a twenty-nine year old in a twenty-nine year old’s body.  Steve’s ninety and twenty-six at the same time.”
“If that’s your way of asking if I’m planning on going anywhere, I’m not.  I’m staying right here.”
“Let me tear you apart.”
No sooner had he recovered than Tony came down with it himself, who passed it right back to Steve. Tony says he was careful to keep away, but Bucky knows better, knows Steve. The stubborn prat undoubtedly persisted in caring for Tony the way Tony had cared for him.
.” Bruce slows down his words, spitting them out sharply in an attempt to get through to him.  “Obviously whoever has
Then he remembers that Steve is Steve; dressing for vindictive purposes isn’t really his style. It is Jan’s style, though, and the whole outfit is a bit more fashionable than Steve’s usual combination of plaid button-downs and khaki pants.
“Your bed’s fine too,” Steve stands up, trailing a hand through Tony’s hair.  Tony leans into his touch.  The Quinjet jolts and rocks as Clint sets it down, the landing less graceful than usual.
It makes Tony wonder what gossip is going around SHIELD about his and Steve’s tense, acrimonious start, because somehow, despite any misgivings he has about Cap, he doubts that Steve’s the one gabbing at the water cooler, sharing all the dirty details.
James Buchanan Barnes faces his execution willingly, but Death is not the one he meets.
Tony has had a few moments in his life already wherein he knew, immediately, that things from there on out would never be the same. The fight he had with his father over his decision to go to North Africa. Waking up injured and alone as a prisoner of war.
“Except it kind of is, Steve, but you’re programmed never to admit it.” Tony states. “But you know I’ve never had any compunctions about saying improper, scandalous things, so I’ll tell you what we’re going to do here.”
“You’re not going to teach me how to dance, Stark.”
“Good to see you too, Captain.  You look very dapper.”
“Well, Pepper said it was important, and she’s not one to lie.” Steve replies. Though it sounds off-hand, it cuts Tony deeply. He falters a little in his next step, then tightens the smile on his face.
Bucky lowers his hand, shoulders slumping.
He ignores that for now, filing it away, and reads the assignment with as much thoroughness as he can afford when Pierce is waiting for an immediate appraisal.
His twenty-first century skillset is certainly expanding in new and unexpected ways, these days.
“You can’t deny you’re wondering why I’m not in New York trying to convince Bucky to see me.”
Thor.
“More importantly, why ya here now?” Bucky follows up, words snapping from his lips and his Brooklyn accent creeping through.
“It doesn’t matter if that’s what happened. It’s what Peter Quill says happened. They don’t call him Lord of the Stars for nothing.”
“Right now?”
“Yeah.  I’m never doing that.”  Tony states, not amused.
“Wipe him and start over.”
“I have his old agent’s number…a Miss Peggy Carter. We’ve already been in touch with her regarding the
“There’s still breakfast,” Tony comments, nodding his head back over his shoulder down the hallway toward the kitchen.
“At an assistant’s wages, I may as well be working for free.”
He tosses it into the wastebasket without so much as looking at the headline and resolutely tries to focus on the day ahead, even if Natasha’s words niggle the back of his mind.
She glances at him and Steve tries to school his face into the blankest expression he can muster.  It’s not easy to do.  He can’t lie – as a result of their joint search for Bucky, he had been growing closer to her than anyone in this new world of his.  While it was just a part of their cover, they had even kissed, and it had created a strange kind of intimacy between them.  Like him being able to play the game and keep up with her on the job made her comfortable letting him in.
Steve opens his mouth to speak, but then stops, seemingly at a loss for words.
“I don’t rate some of that patented Steve Rogers stubborn determination?” Bucky nudges him with his elbow, joking but not.
“Yeah, but it’s gonna be at least forty-five.
“Don’t worry, I’ll kiss you then too.”  Tony nuzzles in close, circling his arms underneath Steve’s jacket and around Steve’s waist.  “God, I’m lucky you’re so warm.  It’s fucking freezing out here.”
He glances toward Bucky’s bedroom one more time, looking for assurance that they’ve gotten away with their ill-advised coupling, and finds the door still firmly closed. He allows himself to relax just a little before ducking outside. The late night air is cool in his lungs as he takes a deep breath, but he also inhales a faint, unexpected tinge of cigarette smoke.
Thor, hearing plans in the making, leans forward to contribute an idea of his own.
, if he could have believed Tony to be so fickle. He would have gone after Steve in a heartbeat if that were the case. If Tony weren’t good enough.
“I ain’t gonna name all those.”
Bucky – looks as tired and pale as he had when they’d finally taken him down and brought him into custody.
They’re almost to their floor, though, and Steve also knows he has to say
And it’s true, that Howard Stark had helped the OWI and Hollywood to finance some wartime propaganda, propaganda that Steve had in fact starred in. He’s not ashamed, per se, but there are other things he’d rather be remembered for than his brief - though ultimately useful - foray into acting.
He’s ready for more, and as Bucky hesitates, Steve realizes maybe Bucky is waiting for him to take the next step.
Steve eyes the rest of the expansive couch and considers how rude and awkward it would be if he got up and moved.  Tony being so near makes him nervous for reasons he’s not sure he fully understands.
He’d slumped over sideways in the night and he’s hugging one of the throw pillows against his chest.  Steve blinks slowly and sits up, taking a moment to remember where he is and why he’s there.  He rubs the back of his sore neck and looks up at Clint.
That reason makes the most sense, even if he knows that’s not really why he feels devastated.
“I didn’t ask, but…wait, I’m sorry…what are we even talking about?”  Bruce runs a hand through his newly trimmed hair before looking down at his clothes, which always look slightly rumpled no matter what time of day Tony encounters him.   Bruce smooths his palms down the front of his pale blue dress shirt, feeling the breast pocket of his suit coat for his glasses, and then he looks back up at Tony, confused.
Natasha stares at him for a long moment, green eyes cool and appraising. Her lips settle into a tight frown.
look either.  “Anyway.  Thanks for the drink, Cap.  See you around.”
“Pete.” He raises one eyebrow while his eyes drift pointedly downward. “Huh.”
“What happened?” Rhodey asks softly. Tony can hear the concern in his voice but can't bring himself to look at him and see all that pity directed his way.
Steve makes a note to run all the information onscreen by Dr. Banner later.  He’ll remember what’s in the file, but he doesn’t know what any of it means.  Bruce will have to be the one to make heads or tails of it.   He can see the strange arm, resting listlessly by Bucky’s side.  He’ll ask Tony too.  Tony will know about biomechanical extensions; from what he can gather at a quick glance, that’s what Bucky’s inorganic arm is being referred to as.
