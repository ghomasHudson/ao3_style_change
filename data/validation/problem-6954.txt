It’s cold. Snow falls in gigantic puffs from the sky, everything is covered in the white fluffy layer. It was beautiful. Tony stood in the field looking up at the endlessly white sky. Air blowing out of his mouth visible in the cold. His skin freezing. He forgot to put on his coat before coming out. Yet, his hands aren’t cold, in fact, they feel warm. He looks down at them, and the breath catches in his throat.
“Is it too much? We didn’t know if we should, and when we saw them, it just felt right.” Steve shrugs, looking around nervously.
“You will.” Tony whispers. “You’ll regret everything you gave up to wait, and you’ll regret finding me.” The words spill out of Tony like a flood that he can’t control, not that he feels he should, it’s true. He knows it’s true. He’s too damaged, too broken, too many things going around in his brain, too much past to pack away and move on from. He’s not stable, he’s not happy, he’s not even free. Not of his demons, not of Killian, not of himself.
“You can bring him by. You’ll have to go in through the backdoor, do you remember the ones we used before?”
Bruce blames himself and the Hulk for this partly. Because maybe, maybe if he had been better on the Asgardian ship, Thanos wouldn’t have gotten the Space Stone. Or that battle in New York. He might have been able to stop Strange from getting taken and the Time Stone would have been here, on Earth where they could have protected it more. Who knew what Tony, Peter, and Strange had to go through to lose that, and apparently the Guardians as well.  Then in Wakanda. Maybe if he could have held off Thanos for one more second. Or held back more of the enemies, maybe Shuri would have had more time to get rid of the Mind Stone.
Nebula leads you to the end of the tunnel, acting as guide and protector. Somehow, she could see in the darkness. The two of you arrive at another opening. Stepping out gives you a perfect view of the fight against Thanos. You’re there just in time to hear the Hulk roar loudly running over to the forcefield and pushing at it with all his might.
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose, sighing quietly, and finally turns to face Bucky. “No- I mean- yes?” He deflates. “I used to.” He settles. “I still do. I will again, eventually, I think.” He mostly hopes, but he’s doesn’t have much of that these days. He hadn’t thought of it. Alone here, in his safe haven, it wasn’t a question, he could barely get to sleep and eat these days, sex was the last thing on his mind. But now with soulmates, dating, kissing, touching, it was a question now. More than ever.
When Nat placed the box in front of Peter, she tore off the wrapping paper but kept the bright blue bow. Tony watched as she slowly tore back the lid and peeked in and frowned.
Steve’s in the back, with the punching bags. No one else is in the room, which he prefers when trying to get his workout. Strange for someone who works at the gym and should be used to it now, but he’s different from the average trainer.
“It’s a temporary fix until we get someone else to watch him. Listen, I’m on child duty, you’re on the ghost whisperer. Go make sure Y/n’s still breathing.”
Life was wrong. This life. Tony had another path, his parent’s had another path. Everything got screwed up, because of one day, one stupid road, his life was thrown off course, and he can never see himself getting back on track.
Tony’s eyes are already closed but he finds the strength to nod. The feeling of Steve’s hands scooping him up isn’t as surprising this time now that he knows what to expect, it’s easier to melt into Steve’s arms and relax.
“Somehow, Y/n is able to commune with him. I don’t know how. But he gives orders still from wherever they are.”
Bucky looks hard at Tony’s face, trying to analyze it. He’s sure Tony must be lying or something to be polite. But everything he’s saying seems genuine.
You look up and notice it’s not one person, but two. Tony, and someone else you don’t recognize. It takes a moment to process everything you’re seeing. Remembering what happened, going to Titan, fighting, the Infinity Stones.  You look down at your hand, the stones are gone, so is your cut. All of them, you’re healed, not a mark left behind as proof you were ever hurt.
When the answer doesn’t come he looks up to the ceiling. “Jarvis?” He asks, and almost immediately he remembers muting him. That’s why he didn’t get a warning about the door.
All you hear is something about a scrawny little punk who kept picking fights with people bigger than him.
He’s not sure how long it’s been when Steve finally comes down, but it felt like too long. He’s just about to breathe a sigh of relief when it gets caught in his throat at the look on Steve’s face.
“I’m sorry, am I not allowed to make comments about an apartment we are literally in? Can I not ask questions? You asked if he had roommates. Why is what I said so bad?”
But there’s this connection. Once you find your grove, you become one almost. Like having a million inside jokes. Knowing each other’s cues, and knowing how they’re feeling by just taking one look at them. There’s a harmony, a pattern, that just locks everything into place. That’s when it all feels like magic. That’s when you begin to finish each other’s sentences, that’s when you are able to just know how your soulmate is feeling, even at a distance, that’s how you can tell what they need without them ever needing to say it aloud.
“Don’t- don’t panic. I’ll tell him it was me.” Bucky nods, already pulling the glove off his metal hand exposing it. It makes more sense anyway. Metal beats marble counter. Hopefully, he’s never actually punched a marble counter. But it’s better than trying to explain the science experiment.
You go back up the steps grabbing the backpack you dropped and listen to the address Stephen gives you.
You head down the stairs when you hear some new voices enter a conversation. Wong must have teleported him, but it sounds like more than one.
The week passed at a snail’s pace, which left Tony feeling bored, but also appreciative. Nothing happened, good or bad. Steve and Bucky had back to back shifts, and other things that kept them too busy to come over or try to make plans. They texted at least once a day with something, and Tony was happy for those small messages shared between them.
The man looks like he doesn’t believe Tony, which he should because Tony stares off into space all the time. Usually, Jarvis is the one to pull him out of his mind when he’s done it for a long time.
“Come on Steve! I know it’s weird, but I dunno what to do!” Bucky sighs dropping onto his bed, and it squeaks with the weight and force of him. “I’m not good with people, you know that! They take one look at me,
“No.” Steve chuckled dryly. “He actually tried to be nice to me. Said he wanted to start over. I wasn’t listening.”
He forced his eyes open, and Bucky is just everywhere, migrated between his legs, standing over him completely, arms wrapped around him, and Tony feels trapped.
You grab all six of the objects and clamber your way off the hospital bed into the bathroom, carefully washing the blood away with cold water. You hold them in your wet hands, they shine brightly, you can almost hear a whine coming from them as if they’re speaking to you. You look in the mirror, the rainbow of colors paints your face. Somehow, just like that, you remember what Gamora told you of your sacrifice.
You sit up confused but move anyway. Your body tired, and arm aching with pain on every tiny movement, but you don’t stop. Holding out your good arm to Adam who takes it and climbs off the bed with you. The steps only make the pain worse, and you hiss once you finally get down that last step, you’re having a hard time deciding what position to keep your in is best.
Hands covered in blood, and the snow on the ground around him stained with it. A long-dribbled trail of blood, he follows it with his eyes until it’s too far a distance to see and he stumbles through the snow towards it. The closer he gets to the unknown source the more frantic he grows, and the higher the snow piles on the ground to the point he’s practically swimming in it, freezing.
Steve met Dr. Erskine when he was in the hospital with a bad case of pneumonia. He was in the hospital looking for patients with weak immune systems for a study to produce a new drug therapy that could help patients with low immune systems and even potentially AIDS. At first, his mother had said no. That Steve had been through enough and didn’t need to be poked and prodded. But Erskine was a smart man and eventually convinced her it was the only way to save Steve, which might have actually been true.
“What makes you think that? Denial? Stubbornness? Maybe you think you lived so that you could win here? None of it matters. You are alive because of a balance. You will not best me, you didn’t before.”
When they got back to Tony there was a comment about picking up stragglers, and Steve chuckled. Tony then held the kid’s hand considering he wasn’t really in a good condition to be carrying anyone right now. Once they got back to the house, Steve immediately did his best to give you stitches, which was hard without Stephen directing his every move, and your skin was so torn in such jagged uneven cuts, not to mention deep. His fingers kept slipping with all the blood that was gushing. After about an hour of nonstop stitching, he finally came downstairs to find Tony had talked the kid into a nap, after feeding him some mac and cheese.
Only she turned into the kiss, and he wasn’t prepared for that. Quickly he recovered and kissed her back, deepening it. Everything was going well, except he was still holding her hand. With them standing face to face now and so close it was in an awkward position and not thinking, he moved quickly and with a lot more force than he meant to.
“Yeah.” Bucky nods. “But I want to change that. I’ve seen enough soulmate matches to know how this works. We’re perfectly matched for each other. How could I not wait for that?”
Tony shakes his head. “No.  Stark Industries hasn’t dabbled in prosthetics since before- well almost twenty years ago.”
He looks down at the gauntlet. It’s well worn, burned and curled by the power of the stones. It’s still mostly intact, not that he’s worried. He’s won. There is no more use for it. It is simply time for the universe to thrive in the balance he’s created.
Natasha’s cocking the gun before he finishes his sentence, and he tries not to take it personally. She takes a deep breath and aims it at his forehead. “Here goes nothing.” Then she pulls the trigger.
“Double-bonded- a person with more than one soulmate, holding a more than one soul-bond.” Steve reads off from his computer.
“Since this visit isn’t on the books, I can’t pull up your medical file, meaning I can’t see the results of that last checkup, and this stuff is kind of important for me to know in case you need surgery for the wrist.”
“You’re lungs sounded alright, so there’s no cause for worry on my end, we’ll just skip any further examinations then.” He sits back on the stool. “Do you have any questions or concerns for me?”
“You don’t have to worry Tony, I’m not about to gossip to anyone that you were here. I understand why you might want to keep out of the public eye. I’ve heard all about how you disappeared from the world a few months ago. From the way Steve put it, there’s more to it than the news is saying.”
Steve snatches his sketchbook away before Bucky can start flipping through. “No! That’s- no.” He shakes his head. “Get away from me, you stink. Take a shower.” Steve says shoving him away as he reaches for the sketchbook again.
This is singlehandedly the most important thing to Bucky in the world and he’s going to do whatever he can not to mess it up.
He was stuck, leg crushed between the jammed seats and metal piercing him open. And he had listened to his mother gurgle on her own blood calling for Howard to wake up until she died.
“I wounded him.” Thor presses on. “He’s hurt, wherever he is, killing him shouldn’t be too much of a challenge. Besides, I have all of you to help.” He gestures to the group of them as if them being around only gives him confidence.
“Who is it?” He mumbles, voice rough from dryness. He’d drooled all over his sleeve and now his throat is sore. Not to mention the crick in his neck from the crouched position he was sitting in.
“No, he didn’t see me,” Bucky assures. “I thought about knocking on the door but I thought that might be too much. So I went back to the gym and waited for Sharon to take her shift, and I came here.”
Everyone was knocked backward by the force of it, except for you and Thanos. Both frozen in place. Him on the ground, your hand over the Soul Stone that was now shining brightly. Around the two of you, a forcefield much like the one Thanos had conjured before to protect himself formed. Keeping them from reaching you.
Moving, walking, cooking. They all seem too great of tasks for him to handle at the moment. He pulls his feet back up onto the mattress and leans back against the headboard, focusing only on the sound him himself breathing. Staying like that for hours, the only other sounds are stomping of neighbors and Jarvis occasionally updating him that he’s safe and alone.
He does stop and this time the Hulk manages to jump and pin him down. Natasha and Rocket use the chance to begin shooting the titian near the face so once again his focus is divided. Seeing your chance again, you run for it, grabbing a stone at random, and the ground drops beneath you, all becoming leveled again. Another vine of color dances across your skin and it’s red. While Thanos is still frozen you reach for another, and as your hand lands on it, there’s an explosion of white.
He realizes he’s spending too much time smelling Steve for it to not be weird, forcing himself to focus he realizes he, in turn, is being sniffed out, in an obvious way.
“Thanks.” You look back down the tunnel and hold the flashlight close to your chest. “You know what you have to do?”
It was slow at first. The changes growing. What he noticed right away was breathing. Like his lungs finally opened, and he could breathe. He took deep breathes all day long, and he’d run up and down the stairs in the hospital, giddy, not needing his inhaler once.
Tony’s entire apartment had smelled like him. Brief moments of that clean air before the fire started registered in his mind. When they came back the next day the smell of smoke mostly cleared but was there, slightly clouding the smell. The smell of various oils and metals mixed well with Tony’s scent, years of working with them and it’s begun to have a permeant layer on the man. But right alongside it was the raw smell of Tony.
“If you’re telling me your goal was to stop looking attractive, or… heroic, or however you see yourself, I’m going to say you failed miserably.”
“Inside. Or at least I think it is? It’s not the phantom limb pains, those feel different. This is like a stab or a shock.”
Tony’s sinking. Up to his neck in freezing water, and his limbs are about to give out. He wonders, if it’s true that your life flashes before your eyes when you die. He hopes it isn’t.
“I dunno.” Tony sighs, running a hand over his head tiredly, feeling out for obvious cuts or bumps. Nothing. So he figured it was a win, if he did there’d be a bruise tomorrow, so it's another day’s problem. He relaxes into the couch thinking about sleep, and how much he really, really wants to go to bed for the first time in weeks. “I’m tired.” He huffs out a breath of air.
After declining Bucky’s offer to come over, Bucky settled on just staying on the phone, talking until Tony felt better. It was strange feeling a panic inside him dissipate when it wasn’t originally his in the first place. Tony’s reluctance to tell him why he was feeling that way didn’t bother him in the slightest, he was just happy to help any small way Tony would let him.
That’s why he was happy to be the grandmasters champion. People roared the Hulks name. They had flags, posters, and face paint. They threw parades.
Something inside Tony just finally clicks into place and he just feels safe. Six months of hiding. Adding locks, dodging phone calls, and having Jarvis watch over him all hours of the day, and it’s only right now that he’s actually ever felt safe.
“I’m just considering my usefulness.” He sighs, she smiles, closing the holographic screen and crossing her arms, thinking a moment before speaking.
“Can I kiss you?” The question comes out in a whisper and Bucky sounds breathless but this close it’s perfectly clear to hear, and just for a single second Tony feels like he can’t breathe himself.
The group of survivors is depressingly small. Natasha, Bruce, Steve, Okoye, M’Baku, Rocket, Rhody, and Shuri. There’s some other’s Steve doesn’t know their names, they are scattered from different tribes.
“Yeah, me too.” He bites at his thumb absentminded as he looked over the designs and schematics. He’d printed everything out and he’d grabbed a twenty-four pack of sharpies he didn’t know he had and was circling areas that would need upgrading and fixing for a more modern look and easier attachment to someone. Medicine and science have evolved and changed since this was designed. Although clearly ahead of its time, it’s severely lacking now.
Bucky probably would feel bad about using that to help smooth the conversation along, but when he sees the tension in Tony’s shoulders relax, he doesn’t care what it took to get him back to that. Tony chuckles lightly.
Bucky laughs, dropping his head into his folded arms against the shaky counter top. “No.” It comes out muffled from his arms, and he lifts his head back up before speaking. “Steve and I are just friends. No dating, not soulmates. Just friends.”
“Everyone goes at their own pace.” Steve's eyes follow his to the wrist. “For me when I move too fast I break things. Maybe if you move too fast... you might break yourself.” Tony smiles, it's small, soft, and it reaches his eyes in a way that has Steve warm up inside.
Tony found himself speechless. To break someone’s wrist just going in for a kiss? That’s a new one, even for him. For a bare hand to do that damage to the counter, and come back unscathed.
Steve nods, thinking it over. He’s never actually heard of anyone running form their soulmate the moment they met. It’s usually the opposite. Immediate declarations of love, or some sudden and loud PDA. Some sit down and get to know each other. There are times when people have not been in a good place in their day or life in general and just exchanged contact information.
The deep breath he takes is caught by the receiver and is followed by a short silence. “I miss you too Pepper, you and Rhody. But I’m-” He’s about to say he’s happy here. In his apartment. Alone. But he isn’t. He hasn’t been happy for a long time. “I’m safe here.” He says instead because that at the very least is true.
But he already made the decision, already gave up on this quiet six months. He’ll be found, and he’ll have to face Killian. Whether he’s ready for it or not.
The rest of the group is stunned out of their fighting at the sight. Rocket the most. He’d seen what the space stone could do to a person if they touched it. The entire team had to share the burden of it just to last long enough to put it away. How you are not only holding one infinity stone but two, and seemingly having full control is baffling.
Now they’re here, in his apartment, asking questions. If they find out then- then they might tell people, and people will tell other people, and next thing you know Killian will be back. Probably with a court order of some kind. He’s threatened it before. ‘all for his own good’. After what Tony did, just up and leaving, not so much as a goodbye, he has no idea what Killian will do. That’s the scariest part. He’s wanted to go home. To see Rhody, Pepper. He missed that ratty old couch down in the lab that always gave him a crick in the neck.
Tony sat up, shaking his head. This couldn’t go as easily as Steve believes. He can’t blame him, he doesn’t know the whole story. If this doctor recognizes Tony, he’ll tell someone Who wouldn’t brag about having Tony Stark sneak into his practice early in the morning hoping not to be put on any official records. It’s scandalous, a hot topic. What would everyone do if they realized Tony never even left New York, he’s been hiding right under their noses this whole time.
You’re walking down New York talking to yourself, well, the voice in your head, not that anyone around can see. Yet, there are a lot fewer people to see you. Which you can’t even allow yourself to begin to feel grateful for.
Getting to Wakanda had been easy, you just called Wong and he’d opened a portal for you just as he did for the others before. You looked around Wakanda wide-eyed, you’d heard about it from the news, but no one had any photos or videos of what the secret nation. But there wasn’t time for sightseeing, or even to help pick up the pieces as others already were. Steve and Tony were eager to get to the others and move on, and you understood why.
“While it is courteous to offer a drink and maybe a snack while having guests, I believe cooking would only add to your anxiety. I suggest ordering something.”
It was quieter here, in this cramped apartment building. Not really, of course, it was louder, walking down halls you hear arguments, screaming, sex, little kids running amuck. This apartment building was full of life, noise and all. Yet, it was quieter than his empty lab. It was the voices, the voices he didn't like that had subsided, the ones of his own making in his head. They still rang from time to time. It came to visit in the ungodly hours of the night. They were sometimes so loud he couldn’t sleep. Louder than the lady downstairs who screams at her children. He prefers the noisy neighbors to the voices in his head. Sometimes he even has Jarvis read him to sleep so he can drown the voices out with noise.
“So, I’m the only one with two soul-bonds, and you two… just happen to know each other and find me in the span of a few hours?”
“That's Thanos?” You ask turning to Nebula and she nods. “He’s purple.” You manage. You didn't imagine him to be purple.  Or the size of a building. But that doesn't matter much now. The forcefield around him begins to crack with the Hulks addition and Thanos grunts holding off the attacks from everyone combined.
The sketch is of Tony looking up and his eyes focused just off to the right, his lips parted perfectly into a small effortless smile and a diamond twinkle in his eye, he’s leaned back against the floor. Hair mussed and palms flat against the found elbows straight keeping his posture up. Almost like he’s caught seconds before a laugh.
You clutch a backpack to your chest. Stephen told you to collect some things in the bag and keep it close. It was clothes, water in a bottle, and some surgical level medical supplies. At first, you were worried about why you needed to be so well stocked with that, but he told you it was for someone else. Which only gave you a smidge of relief.
“Hey.” Bucky says a smile on his face is clear, mixed with nervousness and excitement, his hands are tucked into his black jacket and his hair a little damp, a few strands sticking to his face. It was drizzling lightly outside all afternoon, giving the world a misty look and Bucky a light sheen to his skin.
These aren’t exactly new emotions for Tony. He’s struggled with them all his life. It seems that’s just how it goes for children with rights to million-dollar companies before they’re even born. Children who live in the shadows of greats expected on day to shine brighter.
Bucky wakes up at eight that morning, and he’s surprised. He only got home at five and ended up falling asleep at six. He’s nowhere near rested, yet he feels wide awake, on edge even. His heart racing in his chest causes him to sit up and try to balance himself.
She stands gathering her papers before she stops still. “You knew I had a meeting, you purposely called me right before my meeting, didn’t you?”
“Him and that one famous guy.” Steve added. “Bruce was telling me about it. There's a celebrity with two bonds.”
Also I feel like I cut the Loki and Thor time short, so if you guys want me to beef up or focus more on a specific ship just lemmie know, because I basically ship everyone with everyone, and want to make sure I incorporate them in here. That includes shipping the reader with anyone as well, but you should know I don't intend on focusing the reader with anyone specific or having the reader in a relationship because of the story-line I have in mind. But I plan to make lots of room for fluff, so just let me know lol.
“Pepper, I’m sorry if I caught you at a bad time, I was just hoping to check and see if you had an update on Tony.”
“Greasy? I probably should have washed my hair, I would have- had I known this was going to be a part of today's activities.”
Bucky had to work a shift at two, so Steve spent most of his day sketching what little he remembered of Tony’s face. He was shading in the dark bags under the man’s eyes when Bucky came home.
All of your comments give me life, and keep me motivated to write! Thank you all so much. I'm so sorry I haven't responded individually, when I read them sometimes I smile and just don't know what to say! So instead I write faster, to give you longer and quicker updates!!
“I should get a mold of this and set it out somewhere. It’s almost a perfect impression of his hand. God that must have taken a lot of strength.” Tony says to himself shaking his head, pressing his finger into it carefully.
As much as he doesn’t like being touched or talking to strangers. He prefers it to having to give himself stitches again, that was just too painful, he’d rather scar and having to go through a slow healing process.
“I suppose. But how are you supposed to find him now? How is he going to find you once he calms down?”
“Steve.” Bucky shakes his head. “Maybe it only affects one of us at a time. It’d be kind of problematic if all three of us felt anxiety or fear at the same time. One of us has got to be sane and strong.”
“I believe getting out of the apartment would do you good. Movement will help with your stiffness and stimulate muscle growth and blood flow.”
“Couch.” Tony decided after a momentary debate, remembering the counters were messed up and he’s not quite sure he could hold himself up on the stool.
“As it usually does when drinking to excess.” Steve reaches out to touch Tony before stopping himself suddenly as if thinking better of it and pulls it away instead. “You didn't hit your head did you?”
“He’s all yours Thor.” You squeeze the Infinity Stones in your hand, turning away from the bright flashes of lightning and thunder, and the sounds of gunshots as the fighting resumes. This time, without the stones Thanos will lose.
Bucky just stares at it, the impression of Steve’s hand and the cracks spreading out around it like a shattered mirror.
“They are not coming for the food, Sir. It's just you trying to be nice. I believe no matter the food preference or intolerance they will understand the gesture.”
He thinks back to the man- his soulmate. God Tony doesn’t even know his name. He barely knows what the man looks like. Tony hardly ever makes eye contact with people. He always keeps his head down to avoid being recognized. Not that it’s such a difficult task. He’s lost fifty-pounds since he was last seen in public, and he shaves instead of taking the time to shape his goatee. It makes him look like a completely different person.
“I suppose that’s true.” He nods, understanding somehow. Maybe because he lost someone close to him as well. You don’t dwell on those thoughts. You’re just too tired for that trip down depression lane. "You know, Bucky and I used to share an apartment after my Ma died. It was so long ago, yet sometimes I remember it like it just happened. Anyway, it was this ratty old place. Leaks, holes in the walls, rats, roaches. Anything you could think of. What I most remember is the sounds, you could hear it if someone dropped a pen two apartment’s over. It made it hard to sleep.” Now you’re starting to see him getting to a point. “Eventually, we realized, it wasn’t all noises that kept us from sleep. But unexpected ones, that constantly range in volume and pitch. So we would take turns helping each other fall asleep, just talking quietly to each other, and-” Steve chuckles. “And Bucky would even go as far to sing every night.”
“My God,” Steve says to the side. He’s looking at the strands of light spread and even grows to cross your face. Even your eyes burst with the light. Your iris’s changing color. Split in half, one side green, the other yellow.
“Okay yeah, that sounds good. Order pizza- no wait three pizzas. One cheese, one pepperoni, and one supreme. Tony thinks hard about this trying to consider all the factors as if this were coding or sketching new designs. “What if they’re lactose intolerant? What if they don't like pizza?”
“I didn't know. You asked me how it ended. But there was something blocking me from seeing what happened after you touched the Soul Stone.”
“Besides half of the population in the entire universe turning to dust? Nah, it’s been a pretty chill weekend otherwise.”  The bark of laughter Steve lets out almost startles you.
Bruce turns to Rocket and Natasha, and they all seem to come to a silent agreement, with a series of nods, and they turn to Wong. Who then opens a portal back to Wakanda.
It took three tries to get Bruce to answer the phone. Steve hadn’t taken into account that it was nearly six in the morning. Bruce’s voice was tired and heavy when he answered. It turned to confusions at his questions, asking about the doctor that treated Natasha, and if he could get into contact with him again. There was true concern in his voice when he asked who it was for.
It’s been a while since he got a text message. Pepper or Rhody usually call and leave a voicemail. No one else has the number, so it must be Bucky or Steve. He opens his phone to see the new number and smiles at the message despite its simplicity.
“Yeah I know, but um, Bruce, I need the doctor because I hurt him. I think his wrist is broken, and he’s scared to go to the doctor, he’s hiding from someone. He’s really scared. I don’t know what else to do.”
By now the designs and inner workings of that arm were imprinted in his brain. He looked at the still cracked countertop thinking about how he should have called the contractor days ago when he realizes something.
She nods. “One thing I’ve seen a lot here, watching kings and queens rise and fall, or anyone ever for that matter, is the fear of failure. Everyone’s had it at one point or another. Whether it’s taking a test in high school, or being able to fill your father's shoes on the throne as a ruler. Whether you have yourself and future riding on it, or you have an entire nation counting on you. Fear of failure is all the same. I imagine your Hulk never met a problem he couldn’t punch away. Never had someone depending on him and lost.”
“It feels strange.” Bucky starts. Bringing his flesh hand up to grasp at Tony’s other sleeve. “It doesn’t feel the same. Like-- it's sensitive but dull at the same time.”
The room is well lit, and the windows are pulled open, but with the rainy weather, it's not as bright as Tony would like it. His lab had much better lighting, he missed it now more than ever. For now, he makes do with a pen flashlight.
They take a cab, Tony keeps his head down the entire ride hoping the driver doesn’t recognize him. When they arrive at Metro-General Tony sinks ever further into his seat until Steve coaxes him out. They walk around to the side of the building, and enter though an employee access only door, Tony’s surprised to find it propped open, and they just waltz in.
“Cover my he-” You’re only just making the movements, where there’s a terrible screech, and a semi crashes into the building you were just standing in front of, and only seconds later it goes up in flames, engine colliding with something causing an explosion, you feel the force of it from across the street and are knocked on your ass.
“Yeah uh- I told you I have a lot of fire and work-related things going on in here. So, I got some of it insured.”
Tony shakes his head and closes the window. Ignoring the voice. Looking them up would be bad anyway. The internet paints a biased and misinformed picture of anyone. All Tony needs for proof is to look up himself.  So many lies, so many things they get wrong. So many people all interested in Tony Stark and Stark industries with their opinions and comments.
“There’s a knob on the inside. Set to dial back the sensors and pulses being sent to your nerves and head to decrease or increase sensitivity. They probably had it shut off during your healing and set up. Then just never turned it on for some reason. It’s possible that working out so much jostled everything. Turned the knob accidentally. But the cord wasn't connected and occasionally was bumping into other cords. Causing you to interpret the senses as pain.”
You were trying to think which tactic would work, staying still, playing dead, or intimidation, yelling-roaring making yourself seem the bigger predator.
He’s shirtless. Two blue hand-prints on his shoulders, and one red on his hip. The only colors in the entire sketch, making them stand out.
“Wow, yeah, I think I remember hearing about that.” He goes to snap his finger, but stopped himself, remembering to be quiet.“It's rare.”
But that didn’t matter now. He left. If things go his way, he’ll never see Killian again, and… and he wasn’t going to live by what Killian had taught him. He was going to be his own person, think for himself. Which means… he should give this a chance because Killian would tell him not to. So yeah, he’s going to do it, to spite him.
“Yeah, imagine our surprise.” Steve nodded, eyebrows furrowed. “What do you mean you heard about it?”
When they’d met and touched, it became a neon orange. Almost glowing against his skin. Tony had wondered what color his soulmarks would turn out to be. Would they be different for the two mates, or would they all share the same color?
The only one who can truly reassure Steve is Tony. Which Bucky isn’t sure Tony will do considering how they don’t know each other and how Tony reacted to them at first. He sighs, throwing the dryer sheet in and closing it with an audible click and the clothes begin to tumble and spin.
Tony smiled back, eyes looking up to trace the line of the ceiling as if he was expecting something from it. Blinking a few times, he looked to Steve. “How long was I asleep?”
“Well, I changed it a lot too.” Tony shrugs. “It’s got a bunch of new floors. Lots of food. I mean I’ve been having tours, there are a cafeteria and a pool. There’s a lot of space, and FRIDAY has access and control over every single room and floor. She’d be perfect to handle things, she can keep people safe, she’s got like a bazillion safety protocols she could lock people out, or lock people in if need be, keep fights from breaking out. All the fire safety you could think of, and she could drain the pool in two minutes if someone starts drowning.”
Tony’s eyes meet Bucky’s for what insanely feely like it might be the first time today. Strange, how in the moment this close, he realizes they’ve got a mix of blue, green and grey. It’s nice, captivating.
Surely, he didn’t have Steve’s sense of smell, and he hadn’t hugged long enough for Tony to get a good whiff. Bucky sure had thought. Unashamed at his obvious deep inhales and tight embrace. How unafraid Bucky was to hold Tony in his arms, not wanting to let go.
“No.” Tony quickly shakes his head. “Sorry, I’m an idiot, I was preparing myself for everything else I completely spaced on scars.” He pulls the stool just a bit closer and sits on it, looking over to make sure his tools are all organized. “It’s not that scars bother me anyway.” He starts. “I have a bunch of my own right here.” He taps on his chest right through his shirt, and it’s not a lie. He’s got a whole bundle of them right there. From the accident and the four surgeries that followed in the years to come trying to repair the damage. He's got others too all over, some accidents in the lab, others he doesn't remember at all, drunken nights that are forever lost to his memory, only light scars to prove time had passed without knowledge. “I didn’t mean to stare.” He mutters apologetically.
You don’t have time to react or speak to the people all standing around you as the voices all come back speaking all at the same time.
Bucky sighs heavily over the phone. “I’m sorry for calling out of nowhere, I didn’t even know if you were up… I just had a weird feeling.”
“Yes. I will.” Thor says, clutching the hammer tighter with his fingers assuming a defensive stance. Thanos smiles, standing still looking to the sky.
“Fine, fine. Whatever. Keep the nudes to yourself. This is good enough for me.” Bucky throws over his shoulder, still smiling down at this image of Tony. Of his soulmate. Someone he’s never hasn’t officially met. But someone he can already feel himself drawn to.
He enrolled in school later that year. Finally, able to go in public and not worry about catching anything. Not worrying about if he had his inhaler or his backup inhaler. Or his EpiPen. He’d been allergic to gluten before. But now he ate loads of it until his stomach ached, and then all he had to do was wait ten minutes, and the ache was gone, and he could eat even more.
"Thank you. The universe thanks you on this day. Always a pleasure being around you, Steven Rogers. Thank you eternally," Strange said before turning away and walking away from the clearing.
He gently carded his hand soothingly through the shorter man's hair as he held him. His self sacrificial mind was agreeing with the plan but he knew of the extreme consequences that this would have for Tony. He shook his head.
"F-Friday? Target lock on the stone. I'm so sorry Steve. I love you," he said as he shot his repulser beam at Steve's body.
Tony took a deep breath and looked down for a while at his shaking hands. Slowly he raised one palm at Steve.
Then Peter's worried voice cut through the comms, "Mr. Rogers sir! Won't going to Thanos be the opposite of what you're supposed to be doing? Because, you know, you have the most powerful stone, that he
Shining the light down on it, you see the bleeding has started again. You groan, feeling helpless, you’ve got nothing to stop the bleeding and it’s not like you have time to patch yourself up. You’ll just have to ignore the pain for now and hope this will all be done with before you bleed out or get infected. You stand, straightening yourself out, about to begin walking again when you hear a low screech behind you.
He sits in the middle of the couch, making the decision all at once, heart beginning to pick up on it’s own when they take a seat on either side of him. He stares at the popcorn resting in his lap. Ignoring the feeling of being boxed in. Remembering the last time he was on a couch with someone else.
You pull the boy tighter to you, hugging him, trying to blink away tears in your eyes. This whole thing is messed up. All you did was go for a walk, and now you’re being hunted by a creature you’ve never seen before.
That can’t be true. It’s rare to have more than one soulmate, but-but he always thought it was a three way bond. “So you two are just… dating then?”
“I dunno, ask me when I’m not dying.” Tony gestures down to his abdomen, where his cut has reopened and is bleeding heavily.
“Or he just likes the snickers. You think it’s all mental- but Natasha told me he’s basically just a little shit and likes to mess with people.”
At some point Steve had come right up to the bed, and his thumb stroked over Tony’s forehead, smoothing out his hair.  “Tell me what you need, I’ll do it.”
“I can’t explain it really Pepper, okay? I just… I’m in a good place and I don’t want to leave, not yet, I’m not ready yet.” Tony’s not exactly sure he will ever be.
“Rogers!” His voice is loud. “Good to see you.” Steve rolls his eyes before turning and looking at the man.
He steps closer to Tony, taking his hands, in his and waiting patiently for Tony to finally look up and meet his eyes again.
Steve must be thinking the exact same thing because he calls the rest to begin attacking Thanos again. It’s easier this time too, two stones down and they can feel the power difference in the Titan, not to mention his focus is solely on you.
When he finally hits the ground everything fluffy, bright and beautiful is gone. Nothing but darkness and ice layer the world, still covered in blood, now drying and brown, light flashes, a blinker, yellow. On and off, over and over, with an errie click. He looks up, a car crashed.
“No.” He denies loudly with a laugh. “But we are extremely comfortable with each other. Or so we’ve been told only a hundred times.”
What the hell kind of last words are those? Tony chuckles humorlessly at the thought. Wiping the blood and tears from his face. He needed to move. To do something. Think for god sake, he is an engineer surrounded by alien technology, and whatever’s left of his nanobots.
“Yeah, Buck.” He chuckles breathlessly. “We share the same soulmate.” Mind still trying to wrap itself around that fact. He’d heard of sharing a soulmate before. But it’s super rare. They would talk about it in school, he was sure the last known double soul-bond was over seventy years ago or something. Maybe he’ll look it up later.
When the door closes behind them you finally relax. Thinking over everything that's happened these last few days. God, you saved the world- no the universe. You're just trying to get that wrapped around your head when a heavy pain sets low in your stomach and a horrible itch in your lungs. That serves as the only warning before a fit of horribly painful coughs rip through your throat, a stinging burn as you feel the hard object force break up in small pieces, and you expel them.
His entire body deflates, he steps back to the wall, and slides down to the floor heavily, taking long deep ragged breaths and waits for the room to stop spinning. His injured arm hovered above his lap, not allowing it to bump into anything, he’s constantly wincing at the tiniest of movements that cause it to ache more in pain.
Tony isn’t just complementing it because it’s Stark tech or even because Howard must have built it. The arm truly deserves the praise. Twenty years of use and the thing looks brand new. Not a scratch or mark on it. Now he’s already mentally making plans to go through the archives and take a look at what else Howard might have made that he doesn’t know about.
Steve met Bucky’s eyes a moment before looking away. He hated this feeling, hated admitting to feeling it, even to himself deep inside his mind. Twinges of jealousy.
Those voices he wishes he could forget and let go. Yearning for an escape from their endless torture to him. Even here, in the apartment that has become his safe haven to hide from everything, and everyone, they still echo around him, in him. Always hitting where it hurts the most.
When they pulled up to the tower, Tony ran out of the car and didn’t stop until he was on the elevator, moving upward. Closer to Peter.
Tony cast one last look toward ‘Clyde’, willing himself not to let any of those tears that were traveling to the surface of his eyes, escape. He knew this was going to happen, he knew it. And ‘Clyde’ would get over him soon enough. He’d have to find a new man who excels in thievery and a new fuck-buddy, but he would adapt. He’d do well for himself.
Neither said anything for a couple of minutes, their chests were rapidly rising and falling from all their yelling. Tony supposed that some of the Avengers could hear them. They're probably betting right now on what the other will say or do or to see who is going to be called in to help the Captain dispose of his body.
has never seemed more tragic. The suit was broken. It had barely any remaining power left inside of it. It was dying. To Tony, the suits representation of him had never been so clear. Tony was breaking. He had barely any energy left inside of him. He was dying too.
Sighing deeply, Tony went to pick up Peter, once the curly haired boy started crying. “It’s okay, you’ll show me later.”
Because one night, as Tony was going to bed, he found himself wandering around the Compound. He walked around until he stopped in front of Steve’s room. The brown wooden door seemed to stare back at Tony, daring him to open it. After a few moments, Tony gave in, and slowly began to twist the doorknob.
“It’s alright, Peter. But next time to remember to wait inside.” His teacher told him before bidding them a good day and going back inside the building.
“Aw, I’m sorry, Pete. How about you show Daddy what you learned today? Hm?” Tony bent down and placed Peter on the carpet. The babe only looked at the ground before raising his hands, wanting to be picked up once more.
Tony’s nightmares were plagued by Steve. His sweet dreams turned sour as his brain replayed his last moments with him, over and over again.
In his mind, he can still picture the video were he saw Barnes murder his parents. He can still hear his mother calling out for his father. When he closes his eyes, he can still see Steve and Bucky limping away from him in Siberia. Leaving him injured and alone, in the cold.
“Don’t worry about the ‘what if’s’, because Peter will crawl again. And so what if you miss it the next time? There still is the time after that, and the time after that, and the time after that.”
The two smiled into their kisses, giggling as they went, whispering sappy thoughts to make the other smile even wider.
Clint watched from the couch as the Avengers frantically ran around, trying to get Peter to stop crying. He tried to tell them earlier that Peter would get overwhelmed if everyone crowded him, but did anyone listen?
“No- what you did was for revenge. You probably would have thrown that book into the dumpster outside. I take things for excitement. For the thrill. Everything I’ve ever taken-”
“How far would you go?” Tony shot him a questioning look, “Would it stop at watches? What else are you willing to take from someone.”
The Captain pulled away, a challenging look in his eye, “Oh Barbie,” the man insisted on constantly calling him ‘Barbie’ half the time so Tony never knew which name he was going to hear. But he had to admit, hearing ‘Clyde’ call him ‘Barbie’ really did something to him. “If I want to buy you a suit, I’ll buy you a suit. No matter how overpriced.”
Crouching down, Tony slipped through the door, brandishing his weapon. Scanning his surroundings, Tony went behind the closest blockade. He popped his head to the side and watched the two sides fight. Both sides ran behind some blockades before firing and then running to a new hideaway, and repeating those steps.
The man eyed him warily as if waiting for Tony to do something, act out or cause a fit. It made him want to roll his eyes.
But Tony supposes that he thought that Steve got over his feelings for Barnes. He assumed that he was the only man Steve’s heart had beat for.
A few more months passed by and the media began to slow down there antics, becoming slightly less obsessed with wanting to know if Tony Stark was still single. Well, that was until Tony stark was photographed in Paris. When he returned to the United States, reporters seemed to follow him everywhere, calling after him, wanting to know if he was in the city of love with anyone special. He declined to comment.
The rest of the night, Tony flirted obscenely with Hammer, laughing loudly at all his not-funny jokes and making sure to appear super interested in the man. By the time the check arrived and Hammer pulled out his checkbook, Tony looked over at ‘Clyde’ who was seething by the bar, his glass of whiskey caught in his claw-like grip.
Sighing loudly, the Captain nodded. "Yes, but we can't let you know our bases location so you're gonna have to…" he raised his hands over his head and pulled down.
“Mr. Rogers, I am so sorry, but your son and Mr. Leeds just ran out of the building.” His teacher said, out of breath, once Steve reached the three of them.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Steve smiled, “of course he remembers us.” The smile on his face slowly started disappearing as he frantically looked towards Tony. “Right? Is it possible that he could forget us? Oh shit! Tony, you never should have suggested that we go on a date. I knew it was a ba-”
He envisions the way he used to hold Tony. The way Steve used to wrap both his arms around his waist and pull their bodies close together when they were alone. The way he used to lock his arms around Tony in the tightest hug, whenever he returned from a mission. The way his fingers and hands used to run up and down and support Tony’s body, in their most intimate moments.
As the years passed, it became a tradition between the two of them to give each other nicely wrapped, empty boxes for the holidays.
Clint’s rant about flowers was the most information the public received. Then a year went by without any news.
Tony kept his eyes trained on the sleeping baby in his arms as Steve started looking through the legal papers. “Hi, Peter,” Tony whispered, “It’s nice to meet you.” Tony already felt the tears begin to form in his eyes. “I’m going to be taking you home soon. Does that sound okay?” He could hear himself chuckle as a tear began to roll down his cheek. “In your new home, you’re going to be so loved. You’ll have a dozen aunts and uncles who’ll spoil you rotten. And remember that gorgeous man with the blond hair who was just holding you? Well, he and I are going to love you unconditionally. The world may seem like a scary place, but we’ll shield you from it for as long as we can.”
Vaguely he could feel a large hand rubbing up and down against the blanket draped over his back. “Tony,” ‘Clyde’ said softly, as if afraid Tony will break even more. “It’s gonna be okay.”
Every once in a while, he would look over at his husband and see a faraway look in his eyes. His beautiful chocolate brown orbs muddled by a foggy sea of grey clouds.
Steve put his gloves on as fast as he could, but he knew people saw the silver band circled around his finger. Steve waited until the police arrived so he could give his statement, but after that, he rushed away from the scene to get to Tony. By the time he reached Stark Industries to pick up Tony before the head back to the Compound, the video of Steve fighting a mugger was already trending on Twitter. Along with several blurry photos of his ring finger.
“No reason,” Peter said quickly. Sliding off his chair, he bolted from the room, traveling as fast as his little legs would go.
Tony tried to hide his smirk behind his glass but failed miserably. “Well it’s more of a gift for myself, but I’m sure he’ll enjoy it.”
Tony couldn’t open his eyes. He couldn’t. He didn’t want to find out that this was all in his head. After a few minutes, he felt Steve pull back slightly.
There were shards of broken glass everywhere. Piles and piles of clothes and bedding were strewn across the floor. Tony couldn’t help but wince at the sound of glass under his foot. When he reached the bed, he picked up the picture frame, wiped off the thick layer of dust which had settled over it, and walked out of the room.
“Bruce, make sure you burp him after he’s done with his bottle,” Clint called out as he searched through the pantry in the kitchen. “Seriously, where do they keep all the good snacks?”
“Baby,” Tony said wiping away a few stray tears that were rolling down the sides of Peter’s nose. “What happened? It looked you were having so much fun. Why are you crying?”
Tony knew that he never should have gotten involved with Steve in the first place. He should have known that he wasn’t the only person in Steve’s heart.
The gunshots were much louder, this close up. He could hear them bounce off of walls, strike various objects, and of course, his ears filled with the pained moans of men as the bullets lodged themselves through their skin.
“Tony, open your eyes.” Tony shook his head. He couldn’t do it. “Open your eyes, Tony,” Steve said once more. “Baby, please.” Steve’s gentle voice sounded so pleading. Against his will, Tony’s eyes opened until they were looking into Steve’s bright blue orbs. His blond hair was longer, it seemed to rest higher up on his head than usual. His face looked too bare, as though he had recently shaved.
"Baby, please. I promise it'll work out but I can't come home. This is it, sweetheart and I'm so so sorry. Please forgive me. I'm so sorry for all the times we fought and thank you for being the most amazing husband anyone could have dreamed of loving. Thank you. So much".
"One s-second! I'm so sorry Tony, oh God. I wasn't thinking and I just- I don't know. I'm okay, I promise. We can do this. It's alright. Okay I'm ready, 3, 2, 1, shoot-"
Tony's armour completely faded back into his chest piece. He looked up and met Steve's eyes and for a moment Steve thought he might pass out. His husband bit his lip to stop it from quivering as his eyes teared up again and he ran straight at Steve.
Tony burst into tears and let his head fall onto Steve's chest. "We need a medic, Friday. Now! Please, Steve hold on, I need you. Please! I love you so much and you're perfect and I can't be without you. Don't go".
He ran at him and raised his right arm to the sky, letting out a yell that was half as loud as Tony's scream piercing the air. Thanos was sitting against a large tree trunk with blood trickling down his chin and Captain America's shield wedged in his chest. He looked to be in extreme pain yet he had a slightly smug look on his face. Before he could do anything stupid, Thor caught Stormbreaker and raised it high.
“My name is Peter too, but I’m from space which is cooler than that spider thing he’s got going on- anyway I'd like to thank you for saving Gamora.”
“If someone comes after we closed up, then we’re going to hear about it from Fury for the rest of our lives.”
Bucky is no stranger to Steve’s drawing talents. It was something he’d picked up as a child. Considering he could never go outside and play, nor did he have friends. He needed something to do to pass the time. Something other than taking his medicine and homework his mother drew up for him.
Bucky sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. “He was never technically fired. They just transferred him to a different gym, and I guess they realized he was a piece of shit, and sent him back.”
He was fourteen and it was just before Christmas. They'd all just got back from a short vacation in the Bahamas and were jetlagged. Howard had decided to drive since Jarvis had been across the city with his own family.
“Before we met Tony you were all encouraging and telling me everything will be fine, now you're telling me I should have learned? Make up your mind.”
“What would I do without you?” Tony asks, going into his room and grabbing it. Sliding it onto his phone and watches the battery begin to charge.
“Want me to spot you?” The man asks, gesturing to the bench press. Tony shakes his head, stopping himself from letting out a cheap laugh. As if he would even entertain the idea of doing the bench-press in his state, he’d only drop it back on himself and probably die. At least for anything over twenty pounds. And even that Tony’s not sure of. He hasn’t tested his strength any more than needed to hold his work while making new designs all day.
“Okay.” Bucky nods, licking his lips, chest rising and falling with deep breaths. “It’s okay, we can stop. Everything’s okay.”
A tense silence hung in the air, Bucky out of words for a comeback and Steve feeling angry satisfaction of an argument clearly won.
His cardio would be walking back, even if it is such a short distance. At the moment, it’s all he can handle. He’s barely handling his third rep often with the dumbbells, but he keeps going because he doesn’t want to look weak in front of the freaking bodybuilder who keeps cleaning the machines around him, circling like a vulture.
He sits up dangling his feet over the edge of the bed, looking down at them. He doesn’t ask Jarvis to open the windows, he doesn’t want to see the world, or the beginning hints of sun and watch the birds fly by his widows. Mostly because he doesn’t want the world to be able to look back at him. Doesn’t want the heat of the sun to reach his skin, or the shadows of birds to paint his floors. He wants to forget the world exists and in turn, for it to forget him.
“I don’t know what your deal is, or what this is with the hulk. But you don’t have time for this. Y/n is waiting for us, everyone is waiting for us, For you. I know you fought the guy and lost, we all did. But you don’t see us hiding out. So, tell the hulk to nut up, and get out here or I’ll shoot you in the head and make him!”
Bucky’s face softens, and his shoulders relax. “Since when are you the one to lose hope? Weren’t you just telling me a Soulmate is for life? That they will accept you because you’re made for each other? We just saw him, it went well. Don’t you think?”
“Yes.” His voice wavers slightly but it doesn’t seem to matter to either of them as they lean forward, their noses touch first, Tony juts out his chin just a little more and their lips press together. Tony’s skin tingles from his checks down to the base of his spine. It’s warm, and pleasant, everything a kiss should be. He’s missed this, and allows himself to sink into it. Bucky over him, comforting, warm, and he smells nice.
“You are going to sit here.” He pulls the chair from under his desk and spins it around. Pulling up a stool from the counter next to it. “I’ll sit here. But first, I’ll need to see the whole arm, so you’ll have to lose the shirt.”
"I'm so sorry Tony. You know I am. But you also know that this is the only way we win. You can save the universe, stop this psycho Thanos, win. Please hurry, he's almost here and-"
"I love you!" Tony cried as Steve threw his shield at Thanos, which caught him off guard and embedded itself in the Titan's chest.
He learnt in close to Steve and wrapped his arms around him. "Now kiss me, Steve. Like it's the last time you- you'll get to d-do it..."
. But the price of sustainability of life comes at a high price: For half to live on, half must cease to exist. Balance of the universe".
Steve felt his husband tense in his arms and pull away like he'd been hit. His armour encompassed his body except his helmet part, and he turned to face Strange who was rushing over to them. Bruce had gone elsewhere in the time they'd been crying and kissing and hugging.
He aimed his other hand at Thanos behind him because he couldn't watch Steve and he needed to keep Thanos away long enough to destroy the stone. It slowed Thanos right down.
Unless he's about to get hit in the face, or hiding his emotions, he never keeps his faceplate down when he's talking to someone.
Tony turned to look at Steve, horrified. It was the first time Steve had seen his face all afternoon. His heart all but stopped at the sight of it.
"Hey baby. Oh, god, we did it. It's over. It's done, we can go home now. It's gonna be okay now, we're gonna-"
Steve tilted his head to the left. Tony looked up into his eyes and wrapped his arms around his neck. So Steve kissed him with as much love as he could put into it, passionately, comfortingly, like it was his last kiss.
"We're executing my plan. There are three stones on Earth. One in the skull of a toaster, one in a necklace, and one in the cute little belly button of a soldier," Thanos mocked.
"No. No, Steve you're going to be okay, we'll get out of this like always. Together, remember? Please baby just hang on".
There, looking at him was a blotchy, tear-streaked face complete with the most glassy (and beautiful) eyes he'd ever seen. Tony had been crying, a lot. That explains the faceplate at least.
"Shhh, baby, it's alright. I don't know what's happened but whatever it is, we can deal with it, okay? Like always, together".
"Yes you can. You can. If he gets the stone, h-half the universe dies. It's not fair. It shouldn't be you but it is," Steve reassured his husband, and himself.
Bruce and Strange wandered to the edge of the clearing quietly and both stood watching the battle in the distance through the trees.
Tony used his other hand to lock onto the stone as well and cried as he looked at Steve whose face was scrunched up in pain, even as he fought to stay strong for him.
"I am alive. I have a life. You know what makes me selfless? I want life to continue and not mine alone. I want life to continue to flourish. Give it time to
Another few minutes later and Strange called out. "He's coming! It's almost time, he's almost here! Tony!"
After a long day of fighting alongside his teammates, Steve was feeling just about ready to kick this Thanos guy's
Steve was in a state of shock. His brain was running through so many different things and he couldn't keep up. Tony let out a sob and collapsed into his arms again and this time Steve cried with him.
Steve paused and thought. Tony was still breaking down in his arms because this is the worst thing anyone could even consider doing. His heart broke entirely as he looked up and nodded at Strange, gently pushing away from Tony.
After maybe 15 minutes of crying, Tony had his breathing under control enough to shakily stand up with Steve.
He caught him in his arms as Tony choked and held onto the back of his suit so tightly he wondered if it could tear. His shoulders shook as he sobbed, his breathing came rapidly as he soaked the front of Steve's shirt. Steve lowered them to sitting on the ground while rubbing his lover's back as comforting as he could.
"You're a crazy fool and you've injured my dearest friends on this day and many before it. My brother, my friends, my people: all died at your hands. And now you shall die at mine!" He yelled in Thanos's face as he swing Stormbreaker powerfully at his enemy's head, effectively killing him.
The doctor had made it there first. He'd flown straight over Steve's head and arrived minutes earlier. He'd been talking to Tony when Steve got there and he noticed Tony had his faceplate down. Concern and confusion curdled in his gut momentarily.
"Alright, Winghead. It's gonna be okay Steve. You hear me? We'll get through this. Once it's done we can get you to a doctor and get you fixed up and we can finally just lay down and watch a movie and snuggle and kiss and be happy and you'll be okay and it'll all be okay and-"
"Strange, stick with Wanda, she needs help back there with protecting Vision! He's still up in the building because he's been hurt and we can't let Thanos get to him and his stone while he's weak! Go-"
Tony, completely hidden by his armour, turned to Steve then and stared for probably too long. Before Steve can say anything, Thanos spoke up, his booming voice was fair competition with Thor's.
"Look after him Bruce. Please. Thank you for everything. Stay strong," Steve muttered as Bruce sat back. He nodded in return.
Tony had since turned back to face Thanos and Steve couldn't help but somehow notice his stance was incredibly tense. He cleared his throat, "oh yeah? Killing that many is somehow justified if you keep some alive? Have you even considered the future consequences?! First of all, you'll be the most hated being to exist. Secondly, how do you not understand basic biology? Once you've wiped out half of the universe, over time the surviving half will reproduce and build the population back up again! Ever thought of just doubling the resources?"
“Tony, there are literally seven people here to babysit Peter tonight. Everything will be fine. Now leave, I want to spend time with my nephew.” Nat had to physically shove Tony and Steve away from their son, and into the elevator. The couple kept calling out different instructions to the group while Peter bounced happily, up and down on Thor’s leg, with a pacifier in his mouth.
“Thank you,” Tony said before placing the photo on top of the folder and walking over towards the baby in his husband's arms.
“This thing on?” He asked his helmet, as though expecting FRIDAYS modulated voice to emanate from the speakers. Instead, the broken remains of his red and gold helmet stared back at him. He tapped the cracking metal carefully and a light cast itself from inside. With trembling fingers, he pressed record.
Once he got to his penthouse in Stark tower, Tony collapsed in his bed, tucked under several blankets, and finally allowed him to shed tears over his lost love.
It was just a lot harder than he thought it would be. He would compare every aspect of a person to Steve. This person eats their pasta like
