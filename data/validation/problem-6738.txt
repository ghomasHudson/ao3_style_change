Shamelessly enough, Tony had still been waiting anxiously for a reply from Steve since he had send that message. In the pit of his stomach he hopes that he hasn't drawn Steve away from him simply because of his far too forward way with everything, because he knows he says things without thinking, and he knows he talks too much and maybe says things that he shouldn't. He's not good with people, unless he's drunk or high that is.
Tony gasps at the contact, eyes flung open in his shock and mouth agape with his sharp intake of air. There's water droplets caught to his eye lashes, locks of his hair stuck to his forehead and he can feel the cold water drip off of his chin and onto the bare flesh of his chest, bloodshot red eyes flickering up to look at his assaulter and feeling his stomach drop.
"Okay, good."Tony rocks back onto he heels, suddenly finding himself incredibly uncomfortable  as he stands on the skirts of the living room, looking in on the comfortable looking group of friends, a silence fallen between them that isn't awkward or weird.
He'd fallen, surely, because there's a throbbing pain at the side of his head and a creek in his neck that wasn't because he slept on the cracked tile flooring of a strangers bathroom, blanketed with empty bottles and half rolled spliffs. It's December and Tony only knows this because there's a Christmas tree reflected in the bathroom mirror when he pulls himself up, his reflection daunting and tired, a bruise on his neck, the Arc Reactor glowing vividly under his light t-shirt.
"Wait!"Steve remembers loudly, making Tony jump and for Steves hand to slip from his own, a frown appearing on Tony's face but wiping away quickly whenever he realises what he's doing. It goes unnoticed by Steve who is making quick work to gently take his backpack off his back and unzip it."I brought you a cheeseburger."
"Get out of my house."Steve breaks the silence, body leaning over the kitchen counter, hands gripping the marble, his head tipped down as he breathes heavily through his nose. There's a thickness to his voice and Tony can't trust his own not to break if he does argue back. So he leaves in silence, his back to the house, not looking back, only looking forward as he sits in the drivers seat, fingers gripping the steering wheel, knuckles white, tears streaming down his cheeks.
"I said that it wasn't doable."He corrects because he knows exactly what he said during a shared 15 minute break on a dreadful Thursday morning when Tony's idea had sprung the idea and continued to latch onto it as he was caught in one of his garbled, excited rambles that Strange surely couldn't understand. But he remembers, and he remembers what he has said.
"I'll think about it. Thank you for the invite."Tony decides just to go with it, seeing as Steve doesn't seem like the type of person to just give up, being the stubborn bastard that he seems to be. In a way, Tony finds it charming, just as much as it's annoying. After a couple of moments of silence, Tony speaks up."You don't seem like the party type of guy."
Hospital still leave an unnerving feeling in Tony's stomach, and maybe it's because hospitals bring back such memories that Tony often wants to forget, of hurt and pain and loneliness. The last time he had been admitted to hospital had not been a pleasant experience and the time before that, it had been worst. It's been 10 years since Tony had been rushed in after the explosion and Tony still cannot remember the early days of that incident, but he does remember the days, the weeks, the months after.
The people in Tony's life have often associated sadness with a secondary trait or emotion, which at a young age of 5, often left Tony in a very conflicted state of mind about the emotion of being sad, of feeling sad, of looking sad. His mother, who often had her own bountiful bundles of sadness herself that she masked with pills and flaunting charity events, had once took Tony's face in her hands, sharp red fingernails digging into his fleshly cheeks, and told him that being sad was ugly, it made you look, feel and be ugly, which hadn't failed to make him feel worse.
James wears the same leather jacket that he had last time Tony had seen him, heavy over his shoulders, hiding his missing limb. James hides his deformity with his jacket just like how Tony hides his with fancy suits and layers of black vests to dim its glow. It doesn't work for Tony and it doesn't work for James. But Tony knows that it doesn't work for him, Tony may have gotten to a stage of understanding that he'll have to live with this deformity forever but Bucky hasn't and he doesn't even seem to realise that he won't have to either.
He can't help but notice the little scars that litter his arms and wrists, or the cuts around his face or the bruising on his cheek. He wears a dark tank top that dips low at his chest, exposing the bandages that cover his shoulders, biceps and chest. What makes Steve freeze is the odd blue light that glows from the teenagers chest, circle in shape and right in the middle.
! The cybernetics weren't the problem, it's the nerves. Anyway, I got everything sorted, labs, a team, one that you will be leading of course when I'm not around-"
Maria is waiting whenever Tony trudges through the front door, his arms self consciously doing the best hiding of his Arc Reactor that can be done. It's something he's just going to have to deal with, live with it and if that's the case then he's just going to have to deal with his Mom complaining about it for the rest of his life.
Bucky soon gets bored with flicking pieces of eraser at a disadvantaged Clint Barton, turning back to look at Steve whose head is prompted up by his hand and looking off into the distance, mind distracted and uninterested by his surroundings. Bucky bites his bottom lip momentarily, a heavy sigh taking over him before he speaks up.
"Wait, slow down Tony. One thing at a time."Sometimes talking to Tony is like having a conversation with a hyperactive toddler on a trampoline in the middle of a gun fight because the man talks the fast. It's not the first time that Bruce has witnessed the man have a conversation that no one can understand but Tony. Tony looked up, eyes wild with excitement. "The
Tony can't remember much of last night and he's not sure if it's a good or a bad thing, but he knows that he's going to find out sooner or later. Obie will be more than thrilled to sit him down like an ill mannered little boy and show him last night, glimpses caught through the lenses of wandering phones and paparazzo lenses. It was his favourite thing to do, Tony is sure, because the condescending smirk and tight hand around Tony's neck is a dead give away of just how much he enjoys it.
And fuck, isn't he a beautiful sight? With his soft naturally blonde hair and beautiful crystal blue eyes that Tony could get lost in if he stared for to much. There's not a cut or mark on Steve's face, bruising and stitches haven't healed from his last fight and not even a blemish on his smooth porcelain skin.
He'd seen things, much like any other man or woman who has had to experience the horrors of war, and those things; the blood, the gore, the violence, the power that such a person can have just because they're the one that holds the gun or just because they seem to be fighting on the justice side of the war. It's not the criminals that had gotten to Steve, it was the civilians; the women, the children, the ones going about their life and only twisted among the violence because Steve or such put them through it.
"Tony."It's just his name, it's so simple, just 4 letters, but it's coming from his mouth. The words are still shaped in that soft way that Steve has always managed to say his name, as if it was some sort of blessing or miracle, as if his name holds so many precious wonders. Nobody has ever said his name so softly before and Tony wishes he didn't, not now, not ever.
"Maybe a little while later, Rach. I've got the case of a food baby."Steve laughs to soothe the little girls mind. As for effect, he pats his stomach earring  giggle from Rachel and a roll of his eyes from Bucky who looks unimpressed with everything going on. If it was up to Bucky, Christmas would consist of eating Thai takeaway and watching mass amounts of YouTube.
"Do you think I'm stupid? Is that it? Am I your new pet project to poke at when you're bored, a challenge for your own entertainment, a bet for your overinflated ego? Are you trying to study what it's like to date someone poor, naive and stupid from Brooklyn for extra credit? You might have made a fool out of me but I am not stupid."
Tony is close and bolting the bedroom door before Howard can reply, knowing that the man has so much more to say but willing to bite his tongue to say it all tonight. Interactions with Howard is never pleasant and Tony wants to keep them to a minimal for the rest of his life, or hopefully for the rest of Howard's life.
, if I might recall."His sunglasses are pushed up into his hair, straightened and styled if only to look just a little bit presentable. With them off, Tony gets a good view of Stephen in front of him, tall and slender with magnificent grey eyes that Tony swears change to blue on bright summer afternoons, hair combed back and clean shaven.
"I didn't mean to."Steve says in an almost childlike innocence, folding and re-folding the towel that he holds in his hands and looking down guiltily.
When Steve returns from his hour run around the block half a dozen times, Bucky is still there, settled on the sofa with a bowl of chips and some corny romantic comedy on the television that he would normally scramble to find the remote for to change the channel to make it look like he's not watching something romantically corny.
“Every person has eaten snow before and I refuse to be the only one in this universe unable to taste that white matter!” Tony flopped the rest of his body down onto Rhodey’s bed and crossed his arms. Rhodey smirked at the little pout adorning his friend’s face.
On the way back, Tony stayed ahead of Natasha and the new puppy. He didn’t want to have to look at them, but it wasn’t long before Nat caught up and offered him the leash. Tony almost took it, almost let himself fall for this dog, but resisted, hastily picking up his pace so he could get back to the tower sooner.
“Why are you doing this?!” Tony shouted back, squeezing his eyes shut. His whole body was shaking Steve realized and hastily, he pulled the dog from Tony’s arms, lest he drop him. Carefully, Steve placed the mutt on the ground and then turned back to stare at the billionaire.
But Steve sounded so genuine, looked so genuine. Could he really do this? Could he really let himself love another dog?
The pup just cocked his side to the side in response. “Flake it is.” At that moment, Jarvis called Tony from the kitchen once again. “Okay, you stay here Flake, I’ll be back soon.” Tony got up and went to go leave, but Flake just started following him. “Nooooo Flake,” He started as he picked up the dog. “You have to stay here.”
So it was up to Rhodey. They’d have to wait until after sundown; too many people walked the castle halls during the day. It wouldn’t be the first time Tony has snuck out, so it shouldn’t be that difficult.
“Tony, Tony… this isn’t just any boarding school. It’s one of the most prestigious schools in the world. Now what kind of a father would I be if I let you pass that up?” This was a test, one of Howard’s beautiful ways of making it seem like Tony could choose, but then taking away the choice at the same time. Tony knew this. Even at seven years old, he was aware that his dad liked to manipulate situations to his benefit and yet… all Tony ever wanted to do was make him proud.
Clint left the tent, leaving Steve and the prisoner alone for the time being. Steve took a seat on the cot and just watched, afraid that if he stopped looking, that wheezing chest would stop rising. It reminded him of when he was younger, always so sick. Reminded him of the countless attacks where his breath would disappear from his lungs and refuse to come back.
Tony entered, going straight for the coffee pot to pour himself a sweet delicious cup, but when he picked it up it was empty. He turned around, glaring at the room at large that all got quiet the moment Tony grabbed the pot. They all had one… a cup of Tony’s coffee. And they left him nothing. That just wouldn’t do.
“Anthony… Anthony! Please pay attention to Sir Eustice. He has pressing matters he wishes to discuss,” the king, Howard Stark, said to his son who was currently fiddling with his knife.
“No, it's okay.” He looked down, continuing to stroke the golden retriever before continuing. “I know you’re wondering.”
Steve and Clint’s clan liked to leave messages in the places they have hit, a love letter of sorts. It wasn’t too long ago they utilized the very tactic in a bid to start a war between kingdoms. Other times, the clan liked the kingdom to know they were coming. Steve always found it needlessly risky.
He flinched, awaiting the blow, but it never came. He opened his eyes, confused, until he heard the growls of Flake. He looked up and sure enough, there was his dog… attached to his dad’s arm and Howard screaming in pain.
Clint squinted. “You know the answer to that Steve.” The two continued to look at each other before Steve nodded.
He was instructed to stay behind on this mission. For most of the night he waited in his tent for word of their return. Many groups of bandits had their own language of sorts for under the radar communication. It could be as simple as a specific bird call or as intricate as leaving a certain trail in the woods. So when he heard the whistle of a blue bird echoing through the air in the early morning, he exited the tent just in time to see the group enter the camp with a person slung over their backs.
When Steve set the plate down in front of him, Tony just blinked at it. “Thanks…,” he mumbled, before scooping up some eggs and placing them into his mouth. He moaned at the burst of flavor. “You never fail, Brucie Bear.”
Howard stood there watching them, blood dripping from his arm and onto the wooden floor. Tony gulped, waiting for his dad to say something. Flake was standing in front of the boy, body low to the ground in a defensive stance, ready to attack if need be.
Clint shrugged. “That was always the plan apparently. One trip to scout the place and note it’s weaknesses. And of course now they have the kid here to leak anything they don’t know.”
When he reached the source of the sound, he pushed back snow covered branches of a small bush and underneath it laid a small puppy. The child gasped, picking up the shivering animal, its thick brown fur littered with specks of white. “Don’t worry… I’ll take care of you,” he assured, running his hand along the pup’s spine. The small thing wasn’t too skinny, and seemed to be alright, if not for the cold, which means he couldn’t have been out there for too long.
A puppy… they were going to get Steve a puppy probably. Tony didn’t hear the rest. His feet seemed to follow Nat whenever she went, but his mind wasn’t paying attention. He was too focused taking in all the occupants in the kennel. The older dogs would probably never find a home and die in here… you could see it in their eyes… they knew. They gave up hope on finding a new home a long time ago.
“He probably has a lot of work to do, that’s all.” He forced a smile on his face and turned towards the others. “Thank you guys… really, for this,” he lifted up his new pal, “little guy.”
“I think that’s all he knew,” Tony replied back. Steve didn’t like it, but for now, he let it be. Instead, he gingerly picked up his own forgotten puppy in the midst of conversation and sat next to Tony on the bed.
“It’s your birthday, Steve. You are officially off duty all day. Besides… I think I heard a little red head leave to go get your surprise.”
“Tony!” Rhodey couldn’t help the laugh that bubbled up inside his chest at the action. “Maybe try to keep the gloves on?”
He ran, feeling his legs become sluggish against the onslaught of inches of snow; he could barely lift his feet with how much there was. “Rhodey, this… this is amazing! Look at it all!” Tony exclaimed, pure wonder in his eyes as he reached down towards the ground to touch with it with his hands. He stopped halfway there, pausing and then in a reckless haste, ripped a glove off and shoved the unprotected hand into the snow.
Later that night, the young boy was hastily shoving clothing in a bag while Flake whined in the corner, worried. “We’re getting out of here, Flake. Dad can’t send me to boarding school if he doesn’t have a son anymore.” He didn’t know where they would go but he would die before he was taken away from Flake. “Maybe we can go to Aunt Peggy’s. She never really got along with dad anyway.”
“It should come from you,” Nat had said, because it coming from anyone else besides Tony would be outlandish, and he knew that they were playing into his little crush, but that was besides the point. Clint had even bought a fancy purple leash for the little mutt and everything. He obviously saw it more as a team pet than anything. Now it was just up for Tony to actually buy the dog. He had been putting it off.. In fact, he hadn’t even looked at any yet, still banking on the fact that maybe Steve would suddenly despise dogs out of nowhere in the next two days.
“Dad, please,” Tony whispered, too terrified to even more. His dad always drank, but it wasn’t often he got this angry, this so out of control. His words didn’t defuse Howard at all though, just seemed to make him more pissed off and the next moment Tony knew, Howard’s hand was heading for the side of his face.
“I told myself I would never fall in love with another animal… with another dog, ever again.” Steve didn’t know what to say. To think he use to admire Howard and his way of life. He changed… all Howard ever wanted was a brighter future, but had he been that so far up his own ass that he hadn’t noticed he was diminishing his son’s?
Steve smiled back, tracing patterns into Tony’s skin. He rested his other hand on Sergeant’s back, petting the pup before looking back up into Tony’s eyes with conviction. “And I promise, Tony. I won’t let anything happen to him.”
Everything was fine until it wasn’t. Right after Tony turned seven, Howard got into an argument with Maria about sending their son off to boarding school. The fight had been massive, and in the end, Howard decided to ask their son what he thought.
A dog… of all things Steve wanted the a fucking dog. It couldn’t have been a hamster or even a friggin cat, but a dog… a long tongued, panting beast with muddy paws and sharp teeth and just... even thinking about it made Tony shudder. Truth is, Steve’s birthday was coming up and even though he never outright asked, it was obvious to know exactly what the super soldier wanted if the way he gushed,
Until this moment, Flake had stayed silent, but as soon as he heard that noise leave Tony’s mouth, he growled, shifting Howard’s attention from his son to the dog. “And who is this? How long have you hidden this beast in my house?” He gripped tighter.
He was running for two hours before they found him. Animal control took Flake away, ripped him from Tony’s arms as the child screamed. Later, they called the cops to escort Tony home. His dad never said a word.
“Seriously? You just woke up?” Tony chuckled as he shoved past Rhodey and walked into the room. He sat on the bed, the sheets still warm from Rhodey laying on them just a few minutes before.
With one last look into the mirror, Tony nodded and left his chambers. There were guards stationed at crucial points in the castle, such as the dungeons and armory, and some walked the halls, but Tony knew his way around them easily. He could have done this all by himself if he really wanted to, but to be honest, Tony didn’t want to go outside alone… not in the cold, all on his own.
They took the northeast corridor, down a long winded hallway that led to a stone stairwell. One by one, they took each step down, until they came to a wooden door. Five more steps and Tony would be outside. He yearned for this moment, wanting to prove to himself that he could do it… be in the snow and not die like everyone just assumed he would, but as he stood in front of that door, he hesitated… His hands shook a little bit and in that moment Tony realized he was scared. If anything, that just made him more determined and, as he felt Rhodey’s hands touch his shoulder, he took a deep breath in. “I’m fine…”
When the meeting ended, Tony went straight to the knight’s quarters and knocked. He could hear Rhodey shuffling around inside as he waited. When Rhodey did open the door, he met Tony with a glare and a bed head.
For weeks, Tony was able to make it work. Flake was getting bigger as the days passed, but no one knew he was even hiding out in Tony’s room. There was a little area of cardboard and newspaper for flake to use as a bathroom and he knew not to bark. Jarvis had discovered the dog, but after some coercing from Tony, promised not to tell anyone. The Butler even bought the dog food and treats sometimes when Tony was unable to.
“A-a year sir.” Howard sneered and let go at that. Tony cradled his arm against his chest, a bruise already forming from where his dad had gripped him so hard.
Tony nodded, but didn’t move, letting Rhodey go ahead of him to open the door. As soon as it was open a crack, the wind blew it the rest of the way, and Tony felt the cold right away. He took one step and then another and then the third crunch beneath his foot, soft and… ‘snow,’ Tony thought as his other boot left the stone floor for the outside snow-covered ground.
If he could just leave the actual “picking out a pup” part to someone else. Then Steve could have his dog and Tony would just do everything he could to avoid contact with the thing. Maybe he could call Rhodey up and have him pick up a dog. Rhodey loved dogs, so he wouldn’t mind...  would he? So that was the plan, and it would have worked too, except for the fact that Natasha had been lurking, apparently sensing his bullshit all along, and heard the whole conversation. She took the phone from Tony’s hands, told Rhodes that he “would not be needed” after all, and dragged tony out of the tower herself.
“I mean I guess that’s true, but Tony still helped pick it out and everything! You’re gonna love it,” Clint exclaimed. Not a moment later Natasha reentered the room with Steve’s new puppy.
“No one you need to worry about,” the man said. Steve frowned, looking up at the man’s face. His name was Bryan… or Brook or something. He was the newest recruit, and for some reason he did not like Steve. Many people didn’t like Steve though.
“Okay,” he said. “Let’s get him in a tent, I think he’s struggling to breathe out here.” The two of them hauled the young man into their arms and carried him off into the tent that resided right next to Steve’s and Clint’s. It was where all the prisoners were kept. There was rope hanging from the corner pillars attached to two metal cuffs that rested limp against a blanket in the middle.
Tony was right about one thing… he might as well be the only person Rhodey knows that has never got to touch snow with his boots, nevermind his hands. Sighing, and partly knowing he would probably regret this, Rhodey said, “Alright…”
“How do we even know for sure that he wants a dog? Maybe he’s actually looking at them with malicious intent and we are misreading it.” Nat just gave him an arch eyebrow and kept walking. “Maybe…,” Tony went on, “maybe, maybe he uh... maybe he just feels bad for dogs! Yeah and he wants them to be free from owners. Who’s to say not all dogs want to be on their own in the first place. We never asked-”
After Steve calmed Tony down, he brought him up to his floor and helped him change out of his jeans and oil stained t-shirt. Now the genius wore one of steve’s old sweatshirts and a pair of pajama pants.
Not this time though. Tony couldn’t go to boarding school; who would take care of Flake? He couldn’t just leave him. There was Jarvis, who would undoubtedly look after the dog while Tony was gone, but Flake would go crazy without Tony there. The poor boy was anxious if Tony didn’t stop by after lunch half the time.
Tony sighed and said, “I know… I know, but I want to.” He looked back at the door. A whole life of seventeen years being told he couldn’t go outside because the temperature dropped below 40 degrees. A whole life of training inside while his knights continued to fight through the harsh conditions. When Tony was younger, he could remember his mom sneaking him to an open window, letting him taste the crisp cold air. She died when he was four, right after a pretty horrible miscarriage… some say she died of a broken heart, others speculate she drank herself to death. Tony? Tony just missed his mom.
“If only…” Tony whispered. He placed his hands on the table and rested his chin against them. They were in the throne room, the heart of the castle. On the right side of room, portraits adorned the wall of every King to ever rule, the last being of course, Tony’s father Howard. On the left side though, featured a row of windows, high enough to let the light from the sun filter in and shine upon those portraits. Right now there was no sun though and Tony watched as the first trickle of snowflakes descended towards the ground.
“N-nothing.” Tony gulped before carrying on. “I was just putting my snow suit in there so it could be dried as soon as possible.” To really sell it, he pouted and mumbled, “I wanna go back outside later yanno… before Dad gets home.”
“Tony, stop. You’re rambling.” She grabbed his shoulders and turned him around to face her. She tilted her head, studying his face, searching for god knows what. Tony swallowed, uncomfortable with the scrutiny.
“Yeah, pressing as in he wants to press a knife through your back,” Tony muttered under his breath, twirling the blade absentmindedly, silver scraping against wood.
“You’re to watch him,” Clint said. Steve looked towards him and found him looking at their captive with sad eyes.
“S-stop it,” Tony forced out between giggles as the puppy licked his face. He pushed him off before picking him up and grabbing a clean blanket from the laundry basket. “We gotta be quiet or we’ll get caught. Dad doesn’t like animals... Says they’re too messy.” He traveled over to corner, right next to the door.
“I’m dating the sappiest man alive. Where is your dignity, Rogers?” Tony asks, finally rolling his head over to look over at Steve and he sighs. The puppy dog eyes are out in full force and damn it, he’s really fucked.
“And, if things work out, you can’t be mad at me. If I hadn’t snooped, you would go on angsting about how hot you are for me in letters, Steve.
“No, but really, what the hell?” Tony asks, resting his chin on his fist as he watches Steve straighten up and brush imaginary wrinkles out of his sleep clothes. He wears a self satisfied smile, as if he has already won, and it makes Tony grimace. There’s nothing good about that smile… except maybe that one time—
Steve looks at the clock. It’s 11 o’clock and the left side of their bed is empty. Again. Because Tony’s down in the lab. Again. Third time too and last time, Tony literally fell asleep at his desk. They went over this already, didn’t they? Steve does have superhuman memory so he’s pretty sure they did, but Tony just has to be Tony and stay downstairs. Again. He sighs and sits up, swinging his feet off the edge of the bed. Steve doesn’t know which is worse, going down there and finding Tony tinkering away at his gadgets or finding him asleep there. He tucks his feet into his slippers and heads down to the basement.
“You damn hypocrite. You always force me to stay! Even when I have really important work to do,” Tony accused, but he really couldn’t care less. There was a lightness to him that he hadn’t felt since waking up from the shrapnel removal.
Tony would’ve rolled his eyes, (because really, he wasn’t some wilting flower, he was sure Steve had done some reading up on him) but gentle didn’t necessarily translate to
Tony’s heart worked double time as he examined Steve’s face, working to keep his own expression easy and relaxed. Sure he was failing, but at least Steve looked too flustered to pick up on it.
Time passes after that in a pleasant blur. The coffee helps oil the gears in his brain enough to remember why he wrote notes along the edge of his blueprints, but to his annoyance, he has a feeling he’s still running at half capacity regardless. He has done much more with less, and he just knows he’s going soft because of all of those nights sleeping next to Steve. That bastard. It’s probably his plan the whole time. A normal sleep schedule? Tony shudders at the thought.
“Kissing. Kissing is really ‘swell.’ How long has it been since you puckered up for someone, Cap? I heard about that time with Natasha, by the way. That’s definitely a story I want to hear abou—” Tony rambled, trying to find his footing because holy shit he was jumping in head first here, before he clammed up as Steve slid a hesitant hand to the back of his neck, his fingers resting lightly at the base of his skull.
Anyways, letters. You wrote. To me. By the way, some of them? Very hurtful. I’m frustrating? You haven’t watched yourself try to figure out the microwave for the first time. Also, I’ll have you know my reckless behavior is hardly reckless because I’m a genius and have already looked at all the possible outcomes in the time your heart takes to beat. Don’t question that.
” Tony amended with a huff, “but I definitely meant this. What I wrote. Work with me here, Cap.” He waved a hand around as if to gesture to the whole situation. Steve looked back down at the letter in his hands, scrutinizing it carefully (was he really reading it
. Steve probed his side with a partially annoyed partially embarrassed expression. He looked up, a rueful smile on his face.
As soon as the nurse was done wrapping his ribs, the main doctor manifested in front of him. Tony eyed him warily. He was fine—the nurse did a lot of work—so the man’s presence made him uneasy.
and Steve rolls his eyes. Sure, he of all people probably shouldn’t be saying that, but Tony’s taking the cake in acts of stubbornness. 49 hours. What kind of man—?
“Damn octopus,” he complains, but Steve just hums in agreement, shoving his nose into the hair on the back of his neck. Against his will, Tony feels his muscles relaxing as the past few days begin to catch up to him in a rush. He lets out a sigh, and Steve tightens his arm around his middle.
Like another betrayal. Yes, there was anger, and sadness, but the betrayal of it stung worse than anything else. How long would Steve have waited to tell him if Tony had never went digging himself. Never?
) to tell you the opposite. So, confession time: I definitely snooped. Like, went-into-your-room-to-get-clothes but-then-read-all-your-letters-to-me snooped. I’m not proud of it, but that’s mostly because it wasn’t hard; everything was just sorta out in the open. And yeah, maybe it was a dick move to do that while you were indisposed, but you don’t leave a box of papers with a man’s name on them out in the wild and not expect said man to take a peek. And if you did, you should’ve know that man sure as hell isn’t me.
“Fine. Okay. I’ll go back,” Steve said, his tone just a touch putout, and Tony couldn’t help but throw his head back and laugh.
Tony read the letter again before he folded it up and tossed it onto the box’s lid. He ached with emotional turmoil, anger being the strongest player, running through his mind. It was bitter in the back of his throat, indignation and fury mixing together and forming something acidic that made it hard to swallow. He took a breath, shutting his eyes.
He makes sure his music’s up to a nice skull splitting volume, and loses himself in the shuddering of the music through his chest and the soft murmur of JARVIS as they work together on his latest project. Perfect.
Okay, enough of that. Gross. I feel naked, and not in the fun way. Ug god, this is hard. How did you write so many of these? Not important I guess. I feel like I’ve talked in circles and not gotten anywhere. You, against all odds, really like me. And I, obviously, because who wouldn’t, really like you. Oh my god, this is so stupid. I can’t believe I just wrote that. This is really junior high for both of us, Steve. Just, hurry up and read this and come kiss me or something fuck.
“Pot, kettle,” Steve says, his voice already a little thick with sleep. He looks really comfortable, his eyes half-lidded as he watches Tony, his breathing slowing, even as DUM-E rolls by and picks up one corner of the sheets and start tugging on them lightly.
So, Tony had done the only logical and sane thing a person could do after stalking a man he had met at his ex's house years back and had not made direct contact with since then, and invited the man to dinner. A dinner was ambiguous, it left wasn't hostile or threatening and surely Bruce couldn't think of an excuse not to go.
"Don't tell me you've never been shopping before, Tony. That's just sad."Steve shakes his head, finding it hard to believe.
to dramatise the profile. It was completed with virtual tags that when pressed held all of Tony's notes, incoherent to everyone that wasn't Tony Stark.
"That's it, get out."Before Tony can even blink there's a hand on his shoulder pulling him out of his seat."You need food, and don't you dare look at me like that because protein shakes are not food, Tony! And a shower, jeez, shower and then a food. Can you even remember what outside looks like? Or what a proper meal is?"
"James?"Steve snorts, shifting up onto his elbow so that he's the one that's looking at Tony, sprawled out onto his back, the hoodie that he wore the night before still clung to his body and the soft blue light of his Arc reactor casting a dull light upon the bottom of his face."Nobody calls Bucky
By the time the air carrier has landed back on American soil, he's never more glad to be home. And isn't that so strange? For Tony to call a place a home when he's spent so many years living in houses but not in a home? It's not just the thought of being in his own bed, in his own clothes, under his own bed sheets that has Tony's toes curling, it's the thought that he'll be out of sight of the constant concerned stares that everyone seems to give him. It's almost as if nobody has seen Tony Stark in a wheelchair before, jeez.
Steve manages to strip out of his blood soaked clothing and into fresh and warmer clothing, throwing his clothes into the hamper and staggering his way tiredly to his bed. It's late now, just after 8 in the evening and although there's a dull ache for food rumbling in Steves stomach, by the time he wakes up he'll make some food. For now, sleep is enough.
It's still there, it's still working, it's still glowing, it's still a thing, it's still a problem, it's still a
"There there."She pats with a smirk because as loyal as a best friend that she is, she was one of the hundreds that had witnessed the series of sex tapes involving Phil and Clint. Someone - Bruce - had hacked into Phils computer one time and retrieved the copies for the groups enjoyment and mockery. Thor just so happened to let it slip on accident, resulting to the entire school having a peek of Phil Coulsons dick in Clint Bartons ass.
"Stevie, I've been your friend since you were in diapers and not once have I complimented you."Bucky can't help but to laugh.
"I'll do that."Steve insists, setting his own cup onto the table and throwing his backpack onto the bed as he assists Tony on pulling the suitcase out from under the bed.
. The name seems to roll off his tongue like the way that the ocean waves roll onto a beach, a slip of the tongue so naturally as if meant to belong there and it feels so right. It seems to make everything, whether better or not, good.
keeps me alive, kinda, it's a complicated matter that I'm sure your self in-tilted mind won't comprehend. Your grunge ego style, however, doesn't."Tony is squishing the bud into the damp wood of the decking before flicking it off onto the pavement, crossing his arms around his stomach and hunching over.
"Spring Break, but only for a few days."There's more to the story, of course, because spring break has been set aside for party season in Malibu for the best part of the week off that has been planned back in September with Rhodey and a handful of other guys and girls that they've became mutual with. There's no doubt those plans will spread, but for now, it's a comfortable lot.
"I'm James Rhodes, ma'am."Rhodey gives her his most polite smile, offering his hand to shake just the way that his Momma had taught him to treat ladies with respect."I'm Tony's roommate at MIT."
Tony has to admit that his lack of sleep is something that is his own fault, because even at a young age Tony was always up to no good during the A.M or determined to finish a Lego sky-scraper for him to show Jarvis and Anna. Now, as a teenager he didn't sleep because he was distracted, and having that touch of ADD didn't really help when all you wanted to do was be cooped up in a lab and be blasting AC/DC until whatever he was working on is completed and to Tony's standard.
And there is such figure, such person, such man, that Tony remembers, and really has never really forgotten because how could one forget such a person? How could Tony forget such a person that had left such an imprint on his life, who had taught him how to love, and be kind to oneself, to be human, to feel. But to feel in the all the wrong reasons to, to have left him stuttering on a raining doorstep, wailing into a shoulder, to feel pain in places he hadn't expected to hurt, to leave a boot print stomp on his heart.
"Ohmygod, is this Tony! Tony, Tony Tony."Clint gasps whenever he's found himself draped over Steve's shoulder, staring at the Brown eyed teenager through the screen, patting at Steve's face."He's so pretty, Steve! So so so so pretty."Clint sings.
"That's what I know, Steve."And it's teasing, Tony can feel the smile on his lips as he holds his phone to his ear like some kind of idiot."But then again, maybe that is all that I think seeing as you haven't worked up the courage to ask me out on a date yet."
"Yeah."Tony nods,"Just dump whatever inside onto the table."He instructs, already turning back to finish up the heart monitor, screwing down the back of it. Steve follows the instructions, dumping the clothes that was inside of it onto the table and not being able to help the grin whenever a pair of Tony's coffee themed boxers fall out,
"We are not having this conversation again."He stresses, not even bothering to stop and grab food from the cupboard like he intended on doing before settling to watch a film until dinner. His mom should be home from her shift soon and Steve intends on making her dinner, it's the least that he can do.
Tony likes the company of his own, and if not on his own, then the bots back in his workshop at MIT or Rhodey on those days that he needs the comfort and attention. Sure, he liked that Steve came up the hospital to visit him, and the texting but that's different. Steve is different, he looks at Tony different, treats him different and that's what Tony likes about him. He just isn't sure that he'll like his friends.
"Cut the bullshit, Rhodey."Tony stares at the plate of pancakes that's been pushed towards him on the small kitchen table, the two seats tucked under the table, the pancakes drizzled in syrup and sprinkled with blueberries. Tony wants to rip this off like a bandaid, get it over and done with, delay the trauma and pain, but he's not very good at either of that.
"Then we have nothing further to discuss. Have a good morning, Mr. Barnes."The doctor nods his head at the man on the bed, the StarkTab immediately shutting off once he has taken his glance away from the transparent screen, turning to leave.
"Not today."Bucky shakes his head, resting his head back onto the pillow with a sigh. Steve closes his eyes, just wanting to sleep away the headache that is slowly starting to form and the pain in his rids and around his face. He doesn't regret being a good guy, but it doesn't alway have its perks when you're lying on your bed in pain.
"You will not believe the day I've just had!"His apartment door is shoved open and closed with a bang, causing Steve to jump in his seat, breaking out in a cold sweat at the unexpected noise and the person who makes it. Clint Barton is sauntering in with a face of thunder, looking around momentarily to see who else is in the apartment before continuing."So first- listen to this, Steve, it's actually
New York has always been cold, and winter weather is the worse. There's snow gracing the pavements and drive ways, on the roofs of houses and cars. Steve is use to the weather, but unfortunately so, the house is even colder than the weather outside with the heating busted and Sarah Rogers hasn't come round to phoning for someone to come and fix it.
"Maybe that's because you are?"Steve smirks, bringing the glass up to his lips and taking a sip. He can feel the familiar burn slide down his throat and settle in his stomach, his face twisted up in a sort of disgust from being caught off guard by the alcoholic drink."Seriously? Vodka and coke?"
"You don't have to leave so soon, we can go out somewhere if you'd like, see Brooklyn."Steve suggests, looking coy at the doorframe of the bathroom where Tony had last left all of his belongings.
This time, Peggy is there, in mourning black if only to blend in to the crowds. But she stands out to Tony, because only Peggy could appear in mourning but not actually be, to retain a facade as if she had never left. She looks tired, withered almost, as if the years of working a dream job in a dream city with a dream family wasn't the dream she intended it to be. And in some spiteful, hateful way, Tony does wishes that she had regrets, about leaving Tony in the dust, about leaving New York, about leaving behind a life, a boy, who adored her.
"Sure."James snorts, now looking at Tony for the first time since he has taken off his shirt. You wouldn't think how toned that Tony is but he cuts a fine figure from all the heavy lifting he does in his workshop. Sure, his eating habits is out of whack but what he does in the workshop more or less makes up for it, or that's how Tony sees it anyway.
"Why can't you just knock?"Steve can still feel the cold sweat gathering on his forehead but his heart race has began to slow down as he looks at Clint who has just seemed to have grown stronger in the biceps with age, still remaining with that boyish charm about him.
That's not to say that everyone else is useless in the cooking department because as much as Bucky loves to deny the fact, he's an excellent baker and Natasha has some recipes up her sleeve. And coming from a rather close knit family, Thor's family were keen on massive amounts of food too, usually bringing in left over from the night before for the rest of the crowd.
"Nobody ever sees his drawings. They're sacred."Bruce mutters, pushing up his glasses as he looks at Tony with a hand outstretched."Bruce Banner."
It wasn't as if Tony has ever cared before to hide who he is, his Sexuality is a massive part of who he is, and maybe that's an influence on his life back in campus where he's used as the campuses sex toy, but it was always something that Tony has never hid, he saw no reason. He flaunts a lot of things in his life, his sexuality is a massive one.
There's a kink in his neck as he huffs and puffs, turning from his side to his back, stretching out his back, then his neck, the shoulders, the arms and flex his fingers in the air for a bit before his hands comeback to his face, rubbing at his tired, heavy eyes. He doesn't want to get up, he doesn't want to face the world and all it's problems, all of
"Rhodey."Tony gives a tight smile of relief, his hands reaching out for Rhodey whenever the older man is in distance, grabbing at his hands. There's a look of concern washed over Rhodey's face, a look in his eyes that tells Tony they'll talk more later.
"Makes sense."She shrugs a shoulder, turning a corner onto an unfamiliar road but Steve has been gone long enough to know that Natasha is well accustomed to her surroundings and where she is going, it's part of her job to
"What am I going to do with you, boy."She shakes her head with a sigh. Steve is so handsome and it's a pity to see him battered and bruised, with life lasting scars across his chest and face that only remain because he keeps picking at them before they can heal or are too deep to cover up completely."I need to wrap you up in cotton wool."
because Steve could be 40, married with children and working his dream job but Sarah Rogers has every right to have an opinion and say on his life. Steve is her only child, her son, her baby, her pride and joy because everyone knows that the reason Sarah has worked so hard in her life is to give Steve the best life as possible and that she sees none of her wages for herself.
And he smells so good, like the cologne he use to wear all those years back when he prowled the campus after a fresh-out-of-the-womb baby face Tony, in all his 6 foot tall handsomeness. There's just something about that smell, the smell of rich expensive aftershave, that brings you back to all the good moments and disregard all the bad because when Tony thinks about it, not all his moments with Tiberius were so sour, and they were far better than what he had with Obie.
"-to pick up your pieces."Tony only hears the tail-end of what Obie is ranting about, monologuing the hardships of being Howard Starks right hand man which also means being limbered as being Tony Starks personal babysitter."I do this all for you, m'boy."
And Steve knows, he knows of all of the consequences that come with going to war, he knows that it's a lot bigger than just looking out for the little guy, because he's not just doing that now, he's looking out for himself, for a team, for a country, for his mom and friends back home. The more he thinks of it, the more frightened he becomes, but he's so much more than fear, because he wants to fight for his country, he wants to be loyal and respectful, he wants to give back and he's not going to do that if he's just sitting at home.
, he has a friend. Steve isn't use to how Tony acts or talks, he doesn't know Tony the way that Rhodey does, he won't be as open minded and uncaring like Rhodey is when it comes to Tony's sexuality and his attachment to affection.
His workshop was located in what was the basement of the abandoned warehouse, gutted from storage units and old boiler heaters so that Tony could accustom it with his advanced technology. His workshop became one of his first major projects, starting from scratch and investing all his time and money into making it his. It was where he birthed so many ideas, where he studied for his doctorate, where he created Butterfingers and U and where he created his first prototype of a prosthetic made from cybernetic technology.
"You keep looking at your phone as if he's about to do something magnificent. The most a phone like that can do is survive a 100 foot drop off a building."
"I thought you were phoning me about the cybernetic prosthetic, Tony."Bruce looks bored or maybe that's just Tony's paranoia sneaking through as he quickly swipes his projections to keep Bruce's interests alive.
Okay, and so what if he was a nice guy, had a body that was probably crafted by the gods and a face that anyone would die for, that didn't mean Steve was amazing at everything that he did, because let me tell you, He wasn't. Steve wasn't the honour student in his class, getting all of the A's and class president, no, he was the bellow average kid with a skill for art and spent more time in the gym than on school grounds.
"Come. Please. My friends would love to meet you, they've been pestering me about it for ages now."Steve continues with his own blush coating his cheeks, something that Tony brushes off as the cold wind that Steve is getting from being outside. The music from the party is still blasting some latest pop anthem that neither Tony or Steve know of.
It makes Tony feel so out of place, the way he had felt the night before when he was bombarded with all of this unknowing kindness, thrusted into a friendship group that was so touchy-feely, barely knowing him but not hesitating to make him feel included.
So the first window of opportunity that Tony had gotten, he used it as an escape route to get out of the cramped house, away from Steve's concerned little glances of
"He sounds...melodramatic?"Steve bites back a laugh, coming back to himself which Tony is thankful of. He doesn't want to dwell on his sexuality, it isn't a thing that Tony himself really swells on either.
It reminds Tony of the Rhodes neighbourhood, although the houses are a lot bigger and probably cost a lot more, but it was obvious that they were homes that people lived in, from the newly planted flowers in the flowerbeds to a football forgotten in the drive away.
He's half awake, half tempted to roll over and press his face into the cold, fine polished wooden floor to ease at his pulsing headache, but there's a hand grabbing at the scruff of his shirt, pulling him across the wooden floor and tugging him harshly up into a seated position with his back against a sofa. Tony's head lolls forward but there's a hand in his hair, stretching his neck back as cold, harsh, sharp water is thrown into his face.
"Why not you? You're a walking accident waiting to happen. I've never seen someone walk down a road and mysteriously trip on thin air and break his nose. How is that even possible?"
"How about this?"He asks again, this time pinching a different area of flesh with a pair of tweezers, earning a sudden jerk of pain as the sensation floods through James.
"Dum-E, what did I say about using the coffee maker?"Tony's tone is full of exhaustion as he watches the bot race from one side of the workshop to where Tony stands at its entrance, hands on his hips as he glares at the bot and the container of coffee that it holds in his claw. Dum-E beeps and whirls excitedly, showing off the container of coffee to his master. "Yes I know, you made coffee, but don't you remember what happened last time you made me coffee?"
Steve heard of Tony, but he never spoke of him because he had bigger problems to deal with, and that bigger problem just so happened to be Bucky and his accident, so much more vital and important than Steve and his own.
"It's like 6am."His voice sounds so foreign to his own ears as he falls back into the bare mattress and Tony suspects it because he can hardly remember himself speaking over the course of the last week, muffled behind a curtain of his alcohol induced mindset.
He has thought he'd have at least a day or two to get back onto his feet, grab his bearings, figure out left from right, have a good scope on what he's missed, what's been said about him, read the articles of crying past lovers and hateful competitors that all of a sudden think of Tony as a 'good man with a great heart' now that he's assumed dead. But no, he's being thrown in with the sharks, in the deep end of the swimming pool, head first into a starving lion enclosure.
"Hey, stop all that moving or I'll have to hold you down. I've the advantage, remember."Tony is grabbing ahold of Barnes collar, pulling him back into place.
"Write it on my hand."Tony orders halfheartedly, grabbing a pen from the table at the side. He doesn't want to take out his own mobile - one he made himself - and show Steve up with his in front of the times mobile phone. Steve nods, writing down his mobile number onto Tony's hand, making him grin."I look forward to texting you, Rogers."
There's no answer, his voicemail box is full with frantic messages of Tony's apologies, of Tony pouring his heart out with his heart on his sleeve, a lump in his throat, a heaviness in his eyes because this is the one thing in his life that Tony doesn't want to mess up. And Tony does this, causing a mess just as his life starts to get on track, he's his own pin that pops his little perfect bubble; his own worst enemy.
of things that Steve was able to notice the changes in and for some staggering reason, it had bothered him more than it should've, and it bothered him more than he was allowed to be bothered. Steve had been the one that had decided to join the army, he had been the one that had decided to get up and leave his hometown, his home, his friends, his mom, his
."It's like venom, twisted with hatred and disgust and sadness. There's a look of pure anguish on Steve's face, muted only by his words."Billionaire. Playboy. Criminal convictions. Alcoholic. Drug abuser. I've seen the photos, read the articles, heard the audio. I'm caught up to date, so please, spare the details of your spring break because I
"You told Tony to leave all those years ago and leave he did, but since then you have made it noticeable to everyone that you enjoy the act of wallowing in your own self pity and I, for one, have had enough of it, Steve."Steve's eyes widen, watching how she doesn't move her eyes off of Steve as she speaks,"It's been 10 years, Steve."
"Have I ever been on your side? Last time I checked, I'm a neutral."Because last time Clint almost ended up in jail, but that isn't anything new.
"Looks like Bruce is too, especially with how close-y close the two were earlier."Clint is smirking from his place where his head is resting on Phil's lap, a mouthful of potato chips."I swear, I thought they were both going to come a science orgasm with how excited they were talking about things like
"You did that?"Steve finds himself asking before he's able to stop himself, and for fuck sake, what a stupid question because of course he did! Steve has been watching him fiddle with the monitor. Tony looks up with a start as if he had forgotten that Steve was still in the room, pushing his glasses back up his nose with the back of his hand, smearing grease from his cheeseburger over his forehead as he does so.
"Only for 10 minutes because I need to head out."He's already complying, toeing off his shoes and getting onto the bed.
."Clint lets out a hiss, head tipped back with a cackle at the shade that Tony is throwing Steve’s way, something that makes Steve’s entire face shine a beetroot red, all the way to the tips of his ears. There’s a bubbling sense of guilt forming in Steve’s stomach at that comment and it makes his frown deeper.
"Bruce."Natasha adds, honking the horn whenever a driver over takes her and sweating out the window at the driver.
"Is that your way of saying that I was not before?"Tony gasps, slightly offended at Steves words. He places a hand over his heart, arm accidentally brushing against where the arc reactor is placed under his thick hoodie which causes the teen to grimace just a little, something that Steve catches onto.
"Making your own meal replacement shakes does not count, Tony."Rhodey speaks firmly, hands tight on his shoulders and pushing him out of the workshop, Dumm-E following behind him, waving a screwdriver in his claw for Rhodey to take.
The workshop isn't tremendously big but Tony doesn't mind, it's a temporary thing, after all, because it won't be long until Tony can design his own workshop, his own layout and equipment  and location. It'll be a lot bigger, with an adjoining bathroom and mini-bar and with hopefully by then, technology that he's designed for himself. No more of touch screen glass when you can just use holograms and interactive projections and voice command.
. Not great but y'know, not awful either. I recommend this therapist, amazing woman, she is. Tell him he has to go to her twice a week and if I hear that he's skipped a meeting, he'll feel her wrath and trust me, he doesn't want that."Tony is scribbling the name and number one scrap piece of paper he found in his pocket, handing it over to Steve with a sympathetic smile.
"You left."His eyes never leave the window, of where he watches a jet pass in the sky, a bird hop off a branch, a sheet of a newspaper skid across the slush pavement, caught in the wind.
"The old cunt wouldn't even come to pick me up but he can arrange fucking press conferences and interviews before I've even left Afghanistan. Fucking typical."Pinching the bridge of his nose with his working hand, sliding deeper into the cool leather seats of the car. He's not even been on American soil for half an hour before the demands have started rolling in.
Stark Insurance, for example, an arrangement that Tony had established for the soldiers that worked alongside their weapon equipment -something Tony had wanted to scrap but Obadiah and the board were very keen to peruse. Stark Insurance was entitled to all soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors of war, to provide pensions to the injured, funds to the widowed, a safety net for everyone. With Rhodey in mind.
If Tony wanted to get Howard's attention, he would've done something beyond the line of stupidity, something that would put his life at risk and nearly kill him
"Take it, please. You bought me a cheeseburger, and holy fucking shit that was a great cheeseburger and I thank you gratefully for it, so it's my turn to buy you coffee, or tea, or anything you want. Actually Y'know what? Take my wallet, buy a car."Tony panics, motioning for Steve to take the entire leather wallet out of his hands.
"You do it for the heavy pay check, don't try and act like you have my best interests at heart."Because if Obie has his way, and Tony knows this to a tee, he would have thrown Tony under the bus a long time ago, grasped at his opportunity to have his surname beside the word Industries instead of
"A cheeseburger, as a peace offering or whatever. You wanted one two days ago, and I know that was two days ago and maybe I should've came back sooner, but I still brought you one."Steve smiles, pulling the Burger King wrapped burger out of his backpack, along with the other and some fries.
"D-Do you need me to help put that back?"Steve asks, setting the backpack down onto the bottom of Tony's bed.
There's disbelief in his heart, a cry that what Bucky is flaunting isn't true, that it's fake news, a ploy to have Steve dragged away from his sweet on, to lure him into someone familiar and close to home who isn't halfway across the country. But Steve is logical, under all of his naivety and stubbornness, and he knows that the chances of Bucky lying to him are slim but that doesn't mean that Steve wants to believe him.
"I know that something happened,"His tone of voice has taken a softer edge than before because he knows that Tony is hurting, but Tony hates the idea of people knowing that despite how easily Rhodey figures it out. And it's like dancing around a ticking time bomb, because that's what Tony is sometimes, a bomb just ticking, filled with emotions and feelings and
"Your ma' is texting mine and she's texting me, you've ruined the Christmas photo that she was gonna send to your gran."He informs. He finally locks his phone, prompting himself up on one elbow to look at the damage to Steve."Well, you do look like shit."
He feels that, the slipping away, and it had started a lot earlier than this moment, but he's coming to the end of the sand, the end of caring, the end of his family which had never really been a family to begin with, but it was nice to say it out loud in times that he'd wanted to believe. And the sand is pouring, and he's slipping away out to sea, adrift from himself because everyone around him leaves, or joins the army, or is
Steve is grabbing his keys and phone from the place where he last left them, shutting the laptop lid close on his way out the door.
"You don't think that the tabloids weren't all over the fact that Stark Mansion was set ablaze? God, I'm surprised the Queen herself hadn't confessed here concern and wonder of what happened."
"No, shit, I didn't mean to stare, I'm sorry. Did I make you uncomfortable? I-I've just never seen anything like that before and it's really fascinating a-and different, but in a good way, I hope because maybe it's not a good thing for it to be glowing-"
"Anthony!"Maria Stark says almost loudly but not a shout, setting her champagne flute onto a passing tray as she gracefully makes her way towards the pair that remain standing at the door. For her sage, Maria Stark sure is beautiful in her silky red evening gown and jewels and Rhodey can see where Tony gets his good looks from.
Jarvis is the man who steps out of the car, in a professional manner but with a tad of sass to everything that he says or does, something that gives Tony that Home vibe
"Guys! They fucking found me! Get out here and save my glorious ass!"Clint shouts dramatically, yelling whenever balls of snow is being pelted his way from a nearby tree that surely can't hold Thors weight yet manages.
"I could be. You haven't known me that long, I could be a serial killer for all you know."Tony Smirks as he settles against the concrete pillar of the balcony behind him, wrapping the duvet cover tighter around himself. It's strange, because Steve doesn't know him that long, and he especially doesn't know just how rich that Tony is.
The evening up to Dinner goes as smoothly as possible, with Tony mingle with guests and Rhodey dragged by their hooked elbows to be introduced and talk to individuals and groups that honestly don't care for their education or well being but are only here because they were given the invitation by Howard Stark to attend. Something that's seen more or less as a blessing.
"Yes but that's only because I'm incredibly handsome,"Tony smirks, being gentle as he twists Bucky's shoulder to one side to take a look at a certain patch of skin,"and I would've tracked you down because this is a
"Me too, but that didn't bother me much growing up."Steve shrugs."Bucky lives right next door, has since we were tots."
"I'm sorry but, but Tony, I can't do that. I can't do that for you."The tablet is being set down on the counter in disbelief and astonishment, Bruce suddenly feeling cold to his core, especially when he sees Tony's face. "Tony, I'm so happy and so proud for you but- but I can't be apart of your research team, and I truly can't lead your work. It's not mine. It's not my
"Where'd you go?"Tony pauses in his tracks, a hand ghosting over the fabric of the cubical curtain that he so desperately wants to rip open and disappear behind, throwing responsibility to I'm-not-good-with-people Stephen Strange and go
This morning, however, the extra body that's in his bed isn't one that Steve is overly familiar with. It's simple things, the way that there isn't any limbs thrown over his body or uneven breathing on the back of his neck, but the way that the body is curled into him, not away like Natasha, but into his body, tiny and small in comparison to anyone that comes to Steve's mind this early in the morning.
"What if I've managed to mess up your heart even more so? Or put off your medication or recovery? Fuck, Tony, you're not allowed this stuff!"His face is pained in shock and guilt, watching how Tony could be so calm about all of this as he drinks his Coffee.
"It's snowing quiet a bit, I hope there won't be a storm over Christmas."Steve voices, taking a sip of his coffee and staring over at the window, the curtains pulled closed in an attempt to plunge the room in darkness whenever the lights would switch off.
Tony's jaw is clenched, teeth grinding, jaw cracking as he restrains himself from shouting, from screaming, from crying out all of his emotions into Steve's face. He juts his chin, looks off to the side of the kitchen, vision glassy from unshed tears and body trembling as he stays quiet. Rich but unloved. Famous but no wanted. Genius but a failure. Advantaged but
The story of How Tony meets Steve starts in the hospital, with a 16 year olds life on the line with 3rd degree burns and pieces of shrapnel digging into his chest, aiming for his heart and slowly but surely killing him. Tony didn't look like Tony, the 3rd degree burns that was attacking his flesh made him look almost zombie like, too scary for his mother to look at without screaming in terror of what has happened to her son.
"If I do recall, I witnessed you deep throat a banana last night to try and impress me, only for you to sneeze and it came out of your nose. Now
"I'm not."Steve deadpans, casting a glance back at the house and then back to the camera so that he can see Tony. He had stolen Phils phone to be able to video call Tony, seeing as his phone was unable to do that and that he wanted to wish Tony a Happy New Years face to face as best as he could."Somebody opened their mouth about a free house and eventually the entire school found out."
Tony smile is small at himself in the mirror as he brushes a hand clumsily through his already messy hair, corkscrew dark curls that he'll have straightened, turning away from the mirror and towards the shower.
Steve has his bottom lip worried away as he stares at the string of messages that he has sent Tony as if he's trying to find something that he had said that had been off putting. Usually, Tony was a fast replier - so fast that he's texting out more replies in the space it takes Steve to write one word - so for Tony not to reply as soon as possible, it was making Steve a little paranoid.
"I know, I know, I'm just trying to be a good host."Steve explains, his face tinged pink in embarrassment. He really does want Tony to have a good time tonight, not only on his part but also for the sake of the whole group.
bedside manner."Tony had motioned vaguely to the man that stood a short distance behind him, tall and slender, keeping a close eye on Tony who animatedly stands in the middle of the nurses station of the hospital floor.
Tony doesn't shower, but instead, he stands before the bathroom sink, the mirror hinged to the bathroom wall. The reflection that stares back at him looks horrible, a picture of someone who has been dealt the worst hand of cards at the poker game of life, dragged through a hedge backwards, and Tony knows deep down, under all of his self pity and self loath, that he's to blame for his state of mind, his state of self.
"And where did you get a screwdriver from?"She raises her eyebrow in amusement, walking further into the room with a tray of food and Tony's pain relief and heart medication. Tony is by far the most taboo paicent that Sarah has ever came across in her years of being a nurse, he seemed unfazed with the arc reactor that was built into his chest, acting like a big carpet trapped in a trap.
Like predicted, the second floor of Stark House is just as bad as the Ground Floor. Rhodey grimaces at the state while Tony keeps his eyes trained on where his feet at taking him, careful not to step on stray pieces of broken glass or trip over his own two feet. Tony's bedroom is locked, just the way that he hoped it would be, with a key hidden at the top of the doorframe.
"I know."Tony smirks, throwing himself down into one of his chairs. The tank top hangs low at his chest, exposing he healing scars and the top of the arc reactor clearly to Rhodey."My mom has brought in a make up artist to fix my face-"
"I know,"Tony replies coyly, indicating a laugh from Steve which is music to Tony's ears. Steves hand is so warm compared to Tonys, so soft but strong and so fucking huge. His hands were nothing like Tony's, whose hands were covered in little scars from years of fiddling with tools, small and always so damn cold. Tony is always so cold.
"Whoa, wait, I don't think you should be doing that."He frets, the door wide open which gives him the view of the male that is standing on one of the hospital chairs, his head caught between the hospital room tv and the wall that it hangs on, making agitated grunts.
down the last few steps and towards the workshop doors. Tony briefly entertains the idea of locking Steve out, but he knows there’s a large chance the man will sweet talk JARVIS into letting him in, and then he’ll have a doubly smug Steve on his hands.
Tony threw his hands behind his head, leaning back precariously in his chair as he stared at the holograms in front of him. He knew he couldn’t focus on them now. It was just for show even though he had no one to fool, but himself. JARVIS had alerted him when Steve had woken up, so there was a large chance the other man had read the stupid letter he wrote. Or was in the process of reading it, or maybe he got three paragraphs in and ripped it up. (Tony knew Steve probably wouldn’t do that, he’s too much of a nice guy, but Tony was starting to have some regrets and almost hoped that Steve would).
“If you won’t come up to bed, then I’ll come down to you,” Steve says, throwing the sheets back and sliding onto their mattress. Tony watches, his eyebrows raised as Steve wiggles to get comfortable before turning on his side to stare up at Tony. He pulls the covers up to his chin, and Tony can’t help but snort; he looks ridiculous. There’s no way Captain America’s allowed to look that petulant while doing something as asinine as sleep in the middle of Tony’s workshop.
And Tony threw it out the first time he read it. Just barely an afterthought. How did he not see it coming?
Of course, he knew about Barnes. How could he not? Tony hopped on SHIELD’s files the second they leaked. It took him forever to find his parents’ files; he didn’t think to look for them first because why would he? For thirty years, he was convinced Howard’s heart problem was the cause of it, but to find out that it wasn’t? To find out that he was blaming the wrong man for his mother’s death for over half of his lifetime? Tony had spent a good hour in the bathroom, heaving up all the contents of his stomach.
“Fuck it. I’m already going to hell,” he said to himself as he unfolded the next letter. And again, what Steve didn’t know, wouldn’t kill him.
Tony watched as Steve turned and started walking towards the entrance to his workshop, before turning back when he reached the door. Tony tilted his head in inquiry, and Steve sighed softly. He paused, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth for a moment, before he looked up at Tony.
You have a computer, you heathen,” Tony said, and Steve huffed, rolling his eyes up in that fondly exasperated way he did.
“Cap, when I said we should spice up our life in the bedroom, I didn’t mean we should move our bedroom to some place more exciting. I mean, workshop sex would be great, maybe a little messy, but you always did like me a little messy—” Tony begins, rambling away as he watches Steve set his jaw and drag the mattress all the way over until it’s laying next to Tony’s desk.
This was an inside look without all the pretense and cover ups that Tony would see from Steve sometimes. When he’d swallow whatever words he had and leave.
Tony thought about those times a lot as he waited in the caves, plotting an escape after what had to be weeks that had passed and there looked to be no means of anyone coming to rescue him. Tony hadn't expected anything different. Obie may have been swiping his messes under the carpet for years but he's been looking for opportunities to grabble for the company since Howard died. The kidnapping of Tony was the perfect opportunity to grab the company, tell the presses they were searching, throwing money at all sorts of field agents and search rescue teams, slowing inching his way into the favours of board members, all while Tony suffered and died in these caves.
But it wasn't the last he heard from Tony Stark because upon arriving at his newly furnished home in Virginia, a car had been parked in his driveway, one that Bruce could surely not be able to afford with a salary like his. A bright yellow sticky note stuck to its windshield, engineers scrawl handwriting;
Which there is, Tony calls it when they leave Burger King driver thru and Jarvis owns him coffee for a week. All Tony wants more in life is to go to bed and sleep in his own bed for the duets time in ages, maybe say Hello to his Mom and then phone Rhodey to tell him that he's home safely, but then disappear.
"Tomorrow is Christmas?"And okay, he hasn't looked at a Callander or his mobile in an awful long time because he's been too caught up trying to improve his hospital room and not get caught doing so. Steve nods his head, eyebrows meeting in the middle."So that means it's Christmas Eve, why are you spending your Christmas Eve with me? Why aren't you with your family?"
"James! Language!"Mrs Barnes is shouting from a room away, earning a grumbled apology from Bucky and a roll of his eyes as he glares out the window at Clint who has a ridiculous grin plastered on his face.
Not like he cares what Howard thinks of him. He's been hearing the words that he's useless, scum of the earth, a slur just waiting to be bent over since the moment he came out. He doesn't care. What his Mother thinks of him, is a different matter. Tony loves his Mom, because she might not be Mother of the Year but she loves him, and that's all Tony ever wants.
"You're speaking in 5 minutes, top left pocket."Her hand comes to pat gently at the pocket of Tony's crisp charcoal suit, a designer label stitched into its lining, a piece that has yet to be released for the public. Her eyes cast a glance at the glow of the Arc Reactor, so vividly noticeable through his white shirt before she looks back at him again."Please, for the love of god, don't go off script. Not tonight, or any night if that, but especially not tonight."
"What I see is between you and I. I'll show you mine if you show me yours."Tony wiggles his eyebrows jokingly, his index finger coming out to tap at the exposed rim of his Arc Reactor, poking through the shirt he put on that morning. James looks at him unexpectedly for a second before he nods, mostly out of curiosity than anything else because nobody gets to see what damage was left on Tony Stark.
Because as much as Tony loves this city, so magnificent and beautiful and busy as it is, it's hard to get his head showered when you're in such a place that keeps him on his toes for so long, where his head is always constantly wrapped around a problem or situated in someone's lap or buzzed and numbed by various substances. A holiday, if this is what he can call a
your colour. Tell Rebecca to paint them silver next time."Steve smirks, cursing whenever Bucky lands a punch to his thigh. Despite the punch, Steve still has his focus directed to the screen of his mobile, thumbs moving to type out another message to Tony to see how he is.
"-And also a cheeseburger, I've been craving for one since I woke up. I really love cheeseburgers, tried to get a nurse to sneak one in but they all hate me and basically told me to go to hell."Steve can tell that he's rolling his eyes, the way he huffs out a breath."I mean they can join the list, it's pretty long."
intelligent. So he was given a workshop, Howard's old Workshop, a couple of floors below ground level and given only mer descriptions of what the company wanted him to make, deadlines to meet, a budget to be constricted by.
"As much as I want to be stuck in a hall filled with overweight billionaires with rods up their asses, I can't. I have work to be getting on with."Rhodey sighs on the other side of the phone, actually sounding sad that he is picking doing work over spending time with Tony. Of course, he wasn't the one to be drinking until he's picking into bushes but James Rhodes is no wuss and he can hold his fair share of drinks.
"Yeah, I mean, I'd count you as my friend unless you think that's weird or something because we've met once, two times? I don't know, can I count a person as a friend after two encounters? Well yeah, I can, if that's okay with you. Just because you're my friend doesn't mean I have to be yours, does that make sense? I think it does."
Dumm-E returns with the Fuzzy yellow tennis ball not that long after Tony has sat down at his workbench, not really intending to pick up any old projects or start any new ones. The 'bot is dropping the ball into Tony's awaiting hands, claw nudging at the mans chest now, giving a long and wild
Steve has always had a love for cooking, as a child he had spent a lot of his time with his Grandmother who often taught him in the ins and outs of cooking, and later as he spent time on his own, he cooked his own food when his mom was working late. He even cooked her food as well, ready in the microwave to be heated up.
"I'll survive."Steve backtracks and grabs a wind breaker and hat from the coat rack by the front door, shoving them on.
"I was perfectly fucking fine living my life, I had everything planned, I knew what I was doing, what I felt, who I was and then you came into my life- my life changed. And what, you had never heard of me before in your hoot so of course I was going to exploit that and why the fuck wouldn't I? You've seen what I've done, who I am-"
Tony was not going to sit about and just wait to die, not when there was so much more that Tony wanted to do. There was still so much to see, to accomplish, projects to finish and places to visit and people to talk to, smile at, hug tightly, kiss passionately on the cheeks, lips, soft forehead kisses and butterfly soft kisses under the chin the way he use to kiss Steve when they were young and dumb and still didn't know what love was.
"Can I think about this?"Is what actually comes out of James' mouth instead, his eyes flickering to look at Steve for a moment and then back to Tony in a way that only a patient unsure what to do in times like these can muster.
Tony is almost startled whenever he looks up to realise that Steve has extended his arm forward for Tony to shake his hand. He eyes Steves hand cautiously, looking for any threats before he musters up the courage to let his hand - which looks so small in comparison to Steves - Steves hand."Tony Stark."
"Lay down with me."Tony pats the space beside him on the bed, making a show of shuffling just a smidge to give Rhodey more room even though the two of them know that Tony will flop a leg over Rhodeys body and sleep like that.
"He said he's getting the bus, so Phil is taking him home."Sharp and clairvoyant as always because over the years Natasha has mastered the art of knowing what people are going to say; or maybe she just knows Steve well enough of what
"I'm cautious."Is how he had replied, meeting her stare with one of his smiles, the sort of smile he resells for when he knows that he's being annoying and showing off. His eyes masked with the shaded glass of his sunglasses, nursing a hangover from the night before and still on the road to recovery from awaking early to gather the mountain of files. He knew Pepper preferred her notes on paper, old fashioned like Obie, who would still prefer to be told directly the information rather than a sticky note stuck to the door of his office.
"You shouldn't be working on Christmas Day."Tony brushes off her comment. It comes to a surprise that Sarah has yet to recognise him as the Poster Child for Future Stark Tech, which may or may not be in progress depending if Howard can get his hands on his Sons technology. But even at that, the media follows his ass even when he goes to take a leak, you'd think Sarah would see him as he is, and not as the teenager that everyone seems to miss.
“Shh!” Rhodey placed his hand over his mouth, ear straining against the wood of the door. Despite the fact that Tony had indeed shut up like Rhodey asked so politely, he kept his hand over Tony’s mouth. Tony was tempted to lick it, if only to get the knight to move his hand so he could fucking breathe properly again. He did just sprint after all, in the freezing cold no less, thank you very much, and he could feel his heart doing double time in his chest from the exertion. Before Tony could though, Rhodey pulled his hand back and then used his body to break down the door. Inside was eerily quiet and hey wasn’t there a woman in here screaming before–
Tony had always liked the snow, but maybe it was because he was never allowed outside the castle when it was this cold; he had a heart condition since birth and the cold was just too hard for him to breathe in and harder to breathe meant more work for his pathetically weak heart which was a big no-no... and yet he couldn't help but wish to be outside in those white flakes. As he watched them fall, he wondered if they would stick or if the substance would be gone by morning, no evidence that it even visited the ground in the first place.
The younger ones didn’t share the same sentiment. Each one Tony passed, jumped up against their cage, searching for love, tongue hanging out. It made Tony feel sick. Maybe he should just adopt them all… give them all of home in the tower somewhere. Maybe-
Her voice soften. “Why don’t you want Steve to have a dog? Don’t you think he deserves one after everything he’s been through?”
Snow makes the night brighter; when you look outside, the pure white substance illuminates the air. It is not pitch black. Instead of contradicting, the white color compliments the darkness and gives it a sense of beauty. No one ever expects there to be a murder on a snowy night like this one and no one ever expects it to be nothing more than a distraction.
Steve ignored Clint’s confusion for now, deciding to wait until they were alone to explain. “Did you actually use that?” he asked instead, pointing to the bow slung over Clint’s shoulders.
Tony smirked… “Nothing Father,” he placed the blade away and continued. “I was just merely stating how you are absolutely correct, as you usually are, my lord, and I should listen because Sir Eustice always has your back.”
“Did you just throw a ball of snow at my head? That is so rude. I am the crowned prince, I should throw you in the stocks for that,” Tony grumbled as he pick up his own pile of snow and started to mold it into a ball. Sure, he had never been in the snow before, but that didn’t mean Tony didn’t spend hours as a kid watching the other children play outside.
The elevator stopped with a ping and the doors opened up. He stepped briskly into Steve’s immaculate floor and made a beeline to his bedroom.
“God, you’re such a killjoy—” Tony began, before being cut off for a third time by Steve leaning down to press their mouths together.
The only thing that threw off the whole barren vibe was the box sitting on Steve’s bed. The lid was off and Tony could barely make out what was in the box from his place in the doorway. He had never seen it before. The outside of the box was decorated with ink patterns, big loops and vibrant colors. Tony couldn’t make them all out, but they were beautiful and majestic. He could tell. He once had to attend an art gallery as Pepper’s plus one and the ink work reminded him of the paintings he saw. Steve was really something else with his artistic talent and skill. The man was never shy with it and some of Tony’s favorite moments were when Steve shared his work with a soft pride, so the fact that it was his first time seeing this…
“JARVIS, turn off the music,” Tony says, staring as Steve catches his eye through the curtain of sheets bracketing his face. Steve grins, a stubborn look on his face as he finally hits the last step of the stairs, tugging their
Steve’s already halfway there, noticing the weight on Tony’s shoulders from the lack of sleep before he even makes a move. He has his hands under Tony’s armpit and holds the man, lowering him back into the chair.
“Maybe focus more on trying not to end up here in the first place,” Steve said, his lips pursed in a poor imitation of his Serious Steve face. Tony waved his hand.
“I thought you’d be more comfortable,” Steve says, his voice barely audible to his own ears. Was that a mistake then? He crosses his arms, the V between his eyebrows pinching.
for that either. Huffing, he hunkers down at his desk, ignoring the crick starting in his neck and the burn building just behind his eyes...
Tony absently rubbed a hand over his mouth, feeling that special kind of bone deep wariness only really present after a tough fight. He sat on the edge of one of the medbay tables, trying to keep his leg from jiggling. He really did want to remain as still as possible as the nurse wrapped his ribs up, but he was antsy. The fight hadn’t been as clean as he wanted it to be, and he had lost sight of some of the others before the final explosion and he wanted to make sure they were all okay. Damn these stupid Hydra raids; they were simple until they weren’t.
. Grew up hearing about you like you were the second coming. So yeah, a lot of hero-worship there and then a whole lot of bitterness and come to think of it, I projected a lot onto a guy I never really met, but that was totally okay because you were definitely dead. Except not dead. Not dead, and not as much as an asshole as I really,
“Rogers, please. I don’t have the time to roleplay as your damsel in distress right now,” Tony says, getting up again. He grabs the chair and stops in his tracks, wavering in his stance.
He took a seat on the edge of Steve’s bed, pulling the box into his lap. He noticed that there were little time stamps at the top of each letter, indicating when Steve had written them. He cocked his head to the side. Maybe, it was better to go in order; otherwise, he might not understand what the hell Steve was doing. Tony picked up the one furthest down in the box that was labeled with his name and he stared at it for a moment. He felt a little whisper of guilt, before he firmly squashed it and unfolded the letter.
He sorely wanted to look inside, but it felt wrong, knowing that Steve couldn’t be there to stop Tony from snooping in his Special Private Box. Taking a deep breath, he forced his eyes away and towards the wall were his dressers were leaning.
He had already been burned once by his snooping. He should really put the box away; this wasn’t his to see. But the one in front of him was labeled just a month ago, and if Tony really wanted to know how Steve felt about him now...
“‘S okay, used to ya snorin’ after all,” Steve says, the Brooklyn twang becoming more pronounced as he yawns. Tony scoffs, both to protest and to ignore the affectionate feeling settling just below his ribs.
“Wouldn’ be so stuck on ya if ya’d been comin’ up to bed—” Steve begins and Tony grumbles, weakly elbowing him in the side.
“But I sleep better with ya’ Tony. ‘S why I came down. Even just hearing ya’s nice,” Steve says softly, and Tony groans, rubbing his face and pressing his fingers into his eyes.
“Really, Rogers? I brought you clothes, you ungrateful ass, you couldn’t have at least—” Tony began, but he paused abruptly, just about swallowing his tongue as Steve stepped closer, hesitant but hopeful, so damn hopeful. God, Steve only ever looked at him like that in his dreams. Was he dreaming? He better not be. Although, if this was a dream, by now he would probably be half-naked and bent over—
“I’m only allowed to be poisoned once a year or Pepper will yell at me,” Tony says, ignoring the bot as it beeps again and lowers its arm, rolling back and away towards its corner. Tony huffs out a sigh and returns to his chair, sinking into it as he inhales scalding liquid, ignoring the burn as he stares at the screens.
Tony arched an eyebrow. So. This was a therapy thing. Alarms went off in his head at that and he knew he should stop reading, but...fuck. Fuck with a capital ‘F’. Tony could learn everything he wanted about what Steve thought about him, things Steve obviously would never say to him, but all the things that Steve
Tony exhaled with shaky breaths. He rolled over, the side of his head flat against Steve’s sheets. Steve’s sheets that smelt like him. All the looks that Steve gave him, they made sense now. How he swallowed his words sometimes when Tony was around. Even when it was just the two of them. How many times had Steve tried to tell him? How many moments did Tony let go? When he didn’t press on, wrangle the dying words from behind Steve’s lips?
“I… Okay, Tony. I just think you’re real swell, and I don’t want to—” Steve started up again, and Tony groaned, pressing fingertips to his forehead. God, Steve and his insistence on treating him properly like some classy gentleman. Please.
“You are ridiculously stubborn, you know that?” Tony drawls and Steve arches an eyebrow at him, his blue eyes sparkling with mirth.
He gets out of his head. Tony’s still tinkering away at whatever he’s doing and Steve knows it’s a futile effort now to convince Tony to go upstairs with him. Force won’t help either. He had only gotten away with carrying the man because he was asleep.
Steve in the trauma center? That must’ve been one hell of a hit to put him down for the count like that. Tony tried to ignore the little tendril of worry that unfurled in his gut. It was Steve; he should be fine.
Tony takes a sip of the coffee sitting by his elbow. It’s cold, and obviously burnt, but he can’t care less. This little sleepless streak is getting ready to hit 58 hours, and whatever’s left of his brain is going towards his work, not towards good coffee.
Steve places his palm flat against the scanner. The glass door slides aside for him. He walks over to the stereo and scans for the volume control. Last time, he yanked out the cords to turn it off. And well, Tony didn’t like that very much. He twists the knob down until he can’t anymore.
“Aren’t you supposed to be smart?” Steve asks. “Aren’t smart people not stupid enough to ruin their health?”
He bit his lip, before taking the most recent letter out and unfolding it. God, this was such a bad idea, but he wasn’t sure when the last time he had a good idea was and somehow he was still standing, so there was that. He started reading, his brows furrowed as he braced for impact.
He allowed Steve his moment of control, before he smirked mischievously to himself and pressed forward, swiping his tongue against hesitant lips. Steve let out a noise, parting his mouth slightly, and Tony took it as an invitation.
Tony was expecting something explosive. That last letter was so charged, hell, the space around them
Tony snorted, his lip twitching to a smile. “Thanks for not handing me paperwork; you know how I feel about that. Formal complaints go to Maria though. How about the rest of the team?”
It’s just like getting out of the chamber in his new body all over again, trying to figure how to walk in balance. Steve finally gets to the bottom of the stairs sans injury. He looks to the glass doors to Tony’s lab and frowns. Tony’s not asleep again, not like the other night, but it seems like he’s getting there. To any other person, Tony may have seemed fine, but Steve knows his body now. He knows it well and Tony’s sluggish in his movements as he bounces from one table to another. They’re all covered in spare parts and tools. Steve can’t make sense of them.
“Not a word,” Tony threatens. Steve mimes zipping his lips with a grin, and Tony squints at him warningly. He stumbles out of his chair, blinking hard as his world tilts dangerously for a moment. He rights himself and shuffles over, before crumpling down onto the mattress, grumbling a little bit as soon as Steve’s arm comes down to claim him, tugging him until his back hits his chest.
“Don’ need it if it convinces ya to come to bed,” Steve says, pulling the covers back and smiling softly. It’s partially teasing, but it’s also mildly pleading and fuck him, that bastard. He sighs, and can see the exact moment where Steve realizes he’s relenting. He smirks, and Tony glares, stabbing a finger at him.
Tony walked closer to get a better look. “Are those papers, Cap? Who the hell keeps paper anything now?” He snorted.
Because when he's talking to Steve, soft soft Steve, he's looking up with fondness and adoration and affection and curiosity, with his heart swelling in his chest and a smile on his face. But with Ty, it's so false, so fake, so forced that his neck aches and his shoulders quake and his smile flatters on every word and every second.
Spotting the familiar soft dark hair, Steve has to bite back a smile of success as he raps his knuckles against the wood of the hospital, peering through the mesh like window as Tony looks up in confusion from whatever the hell he is obviously fiddling with. Steve wants to let out a coo, Tony's hair is sticking out in odd angles and his coffee brown eyes are wide in confusion as he looks at the door, nose scrunched up whenever he notices it's Steve.
The man always complained about the hospital gowns the few times he had to wear them. Just like a petulant child. Not cute at all. Tony might as well pick his clothes up now. He leaned his against the cool surface of the elevator and sighed, trying to force his own teasing thoughts out of his head.
Tony stood up, pushing his chair back until it hit his desk with a thunk. Steve’s eyes suddenly flew up to meet his, slightly surprised by his outburst, and Tony forced himself to breath.
to get up from his chair. There’s a beginning, certainly, but he collapses forward, his arms catching the table.
Even knowing how satisfied he’ll be when Steve relents, he can’t quite smother the tiny part of him that misses stumbling up to bed. Steve always seems so pleased, even if he’s asleep, and it’s… nice, being wanted like that.
The doctor looked down at his clipboard with a sigh. “Black Widow is fine. So is Hawkeye. He’s getting his ankle wrapped and complaining about it, of course, to the point that the nurse wants to complain about
“I… Sorry, I might have just sort of, rushed down here before they could, uh, well,” Steve started, his hand rubbing at the back of his neck again. Tony was still sort of breathless from the brief taste of Steve he had gotten, his cogs trying to start again, before Steve’s words suddenly caught up to him, and he gasped, narrowing his eyes.
He chewed on the inside of his cheek; if Steve found out about this, he’d be pissed as hell. Tony scanned the letter again, before glancing back at the others in the box. He dithered for a moment, before he put the letter beside his hip and reached for the next. In for a penny, in for a pound.
Tony headed to the elevator, reaching up to rub his temples and wincing as he accidentally pulled on his sore muscles. His hands fell back to his sides. Tony tried not to think about Steve lying on a hospital bed beat to hell. It was Tony’s least favorite look on the man.
“He was unconscious, the last time I checked. The serum is doing the most of the work. We’re just speeding up the process. We have faith in his recovery.”
“You’re been working non-stop for 49 hours,” Steve says heatedly. “Anybody who’s waiting for that are asleep right now. You’re allowed to take a rest.”
“You bastard. You complete ass. What are you doing to me?” Tony asked, his voice strangled as he stared at the final sentence. He wanted to be angry, he wanted to hold the hurt he was feeling and let it fuel him, but he could already feel it seeping away. Fuck.
“How’s my team, Doc? Everyone’s in one piece?” he asked, clapping his hands together. He slid off the bed, wincing at the movement. It put weight on his torso and he could really feel those cracked ribs now.
“That’s bullshit, Rogers, and you know it,” Tony said, jabbing a finger at him. Steve narrowed his eyes at him, before his expression softened slightly, running a hand through his hair. Tony gleefully thought about all of the things he might be able to get away with now, before realizing he was just as fucked as Steve eyed him carefully with a tiny pleased smile.
Tony’s heart stopped; his jaw dropped. He looked at the last line of the letter, eyes widening by the millisecond. His mouth worked to say something, but whatever it had in mind died in the back of his throat with a strangled sound. He lied back on the bed, putting a hand to his head, still clutching the letter.
Tony dropped his head into his hands, shaking. He swallowed hard and took a deep breath. He wanted to throw up again, knowing that Steve
The box was full of letters. Letters to the team. Tony sifted through a few of them, his curiosity mounting. There was at least one addressed to all of them, but a vast majority were to Tony, and he wasn’t sure exactly how he felt about that. Were all of these from his time in D.C? Why hadn’t anybody gotten them? Were they not meant to know?
He wasn’t sure if it was possible to put “kissing Steve” and “bad” in the same context. It was like Steve was just testing, fumbling a little bit, but sweet, and growing more confident the longer Tony stayed put. Tony would have loved to be pressed up against his workbench in a dirty and selfish kiss, but he found he was quite content to stay put as long as Steve wanted, because as much as he complained to himself about the speed, his knees were starting to turn to jello. God, Steve was turning him into some sort of sappy teenager. Disgusting.
He rolls his chair back, running his hands through his hair as he shuffles over to the coffee machine hooked up in the little kitchenette next to his cot. DUM-E beeps curiously, his arm twitching up to assist, and Tony grumbles and swats him away.
He wakes up slowly, feeling well rested and content. He sighs and settles into his pillows, smiling at the faint scent of Steve on the sheets, before he sit up, startled. His bleary eyes wanders over to the clock by their bed table and he let out a groan, flopping back into the nests of pillows and rubbing a hand over his face.
“Secrets don’t make friends, Cap,” Tony murmured, thumbing through the papers. He pursed his lips, considering. So what if the team wasn’t supposed to know? What if
Right in front of him?) before he smiled shyly. Tony’s heart jumped to his throat; fuck fuck fuck, he was so fucked.
Tony tilted his face up invitingly, glaring at Steve slightly even as he did so, and Steve chuckled lightly. “You can’t blame me, Cap, they were just sitting there! With my name on them. You would’ve done the same, if it had been my super secret box,” Tony accused, and he grinned a little bit when Steve looked away a little sheepishly. Tony dithered for a moment, before he stepped forward until their chests were brushing. Steve’s eyes snapped back to him, and the faint dusting of pink across his cheekbones deepened slightly. He hid his delight with a tiny smirk.
It had scared him, Steve’s embarrassed to admit—even in his own head—to wake up the other morning to find Tony gone.
