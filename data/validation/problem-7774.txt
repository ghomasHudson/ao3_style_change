Tony sighed in approval as he got what he wanted. It took only a few moments for that to change to a sigh of confusion.
Wow the things I wrote in here... lol
Turning back to man he was with, Tony was about to let him down gently when Steve’s gruff tone interrupted from behind him. “It’s time to go Tony, we’re leaving.”
Lifting Tony off his lap, Steve reached down to undo the ties around his ankles as he rose. He gave Tony a hopeful look as he asked, “Sounds like a great idea, is that okay Tony?”
When he was led to lie down on Steve’s couch, feet in Steve’s lap as he gently massaged them, Tony continued on. He didn’t even know where he was in his story when his eyes closed; sleep finally overtaking him before he awoke in his own bed 16 hours later.
Steve’s eyes looked down to meet Tony’s, wanting to be careful to consider his feelings before he agreed. “Is that ok, Tony?”
At his words, Tony recalled what he had said to Nat before he left the table
Turning to Clint he leveled him with the same angry gaze. “You… You helped him didn’t you? You gave him sleeping pills or, or something, and helped him knock me out.” Tony gasped loudly as he gave Clint a look of disbelief. “Was this so you could beat my score in Mario Kart you Hawk-assed cheater?”
Letting the mask he put on every morning slip away, Tony looked up at Natasha. The regret lining his face and words left no doubt the apology he spoke was sincere. “I…” Tony swallowed at the lump forming in his throat as he tried to push the words out he’d been wanting to express, “I… I’m sorry. I know… Even though I swear I didn’t mean it the way it sounded, Steve’s right. I know better, should have thought about what I was saying, and I didn’t.”
Tony was a mess of shivers and moans as he begged, “Oh god, Bucky please, Umm… I need more, can’t take it… Please just, Aahh…”
Steve lasted another 5 minutes under Tony’s assault. The sensations Tony and Bucky were giving him finally drove the man over the edge and he groaned before collapsing on top of Tony. Bucky had stopped thrusting not long after as he came as well for the first time. He peppered the back of Steve’s neck with kisses giving words of praise at how good Steve was and how much Bucky loved him. Tony lay underneath him kissing his shoulders and rubbing Steve’s side as he came down from his orgasm. After a moment he slid off Tony, arms wrapping around his torso to embrace him tightly. Bucky gave Steve a wet towel after wiping the traces of his cum, obviously knowing Tony would rather be cleaned up by him, before lying on Steve’s other side.
Huffing out an exasperated breath Tony nudged Steve. Coming awake much faster than he had, Steve smiled at Tony and slid right in front of him. They kissed briefly before Steve leaned back saying, “Good morning baby.”
Tony clenched around him like a vice making earsplitting moans as he came. “God Bucky yes, so fucking good… So deep baby, yes, please… Ahh, God don’t stop, fuck me Bucky, fuck me, fuck me, Uhhh…”
This is what Tony had been dreading, the answer to the question Steve was asking without coming right out and saying it. So he told Steve the only truth he could and not hurt him. “What can I say, I loved having you there watching me.”
Tony watched as a drop a cum gathered at the tip of Bucky’s cock before sliding down. He was so focused on it that he forgot he had even asked a question until Bucky answered him. “I could give you a list of reasons but I won’t waste the time. You already know them all since they’re the same reasons you’ve been avoiding me.” Before Tony could make any denials Bucky gave him a stern look around the arousal in his eyes. “Don’t lie to me Tony, I see the look you’re giving me right now. You want me, you’ve been thinking about me fucking that tight ass of yours since the moment my dick slid out of it for the last time haven’t you?”
Tony could see he flush of arousal in Steve’s face as he said ok and took Bucky’s place. When Bucky lay on the bed beside Tony not saying a word as he stared and stroked his cock, Tony thought to himself ‘This should be interesting’.
As soon as he could, Tony quickly ushered the man out of his lab saying he had work to do for SI. Bucky walked away with a retort of, “Remember I’m always here for you now Tony. Anytime you need me to help you go through a few positions or have trouble finding the right spots just call me. I’ll be here as soon as I can, that’s what friends are for.”
“Ok, Tony looks like he’s about finished with what he’s doing but knowing him, he’ll try to start something else. Don’t know if I’ll be able to stop him until you’re back.”
Feeling Tony’s body unconsciously laying in his arms, Bucky realized the other man had fallen asleep. He laid the man in his bed beneath the covers and climbed in beside him after retrieving the journal where Tony dropped it. Steve getting the message from Fury had been unexpected but Bucky quickly took advantage of it.  Knowing Tony would return the journal to him once he left it, Bucky left his door open and waited for Tony to look in.
Bucky eyes slid back to Tony’s as he raised his eyebrows in question, leaving the decision up to him. Tony shrugged as he smirked saying, “I’m always up for a challenge.”
Bucky was lying naked against the headboard, hair still wet from his shower, stroking his cock as he watched Tony. Flushing a bright red, Tony stuttered out the first thing that came to mind. “What… What are you doing?”
Thanks for the comments and kudos!!! They keep me writing.
Some of the anger began to fall from Nat’s face while Tony spoke but her expression was still hard as he continued on. “I know what your relationship means to you and Clint, and I hope and believe you know I’d never intentionally disrespect it. I’ve hardly ever felt envious of anyone, but what you and Clint have… Whenever I see you two together, it always made me want something that special to. What you have is… It’s beautiful, and I’m sorry I made you ever think I believed otherwise.”
Giving Bucky a hundred watt grin of appreciation Steve cupped Tony’s cheek in his palm as he leaned down to give him a kiss on the forehead. “I’ll be right in the next room sweetheart. Just yell if you need me.”
It put a sly smile on Bucky’s face knowing he was about to break Stevie’s one rule, Bucky wasn’t supposed to fuck Tony. A surge of lust ran through him as he felt tony swallowing around the head of his dick, knowing what was coming next and that Steve was going to initiate it himself. Bucky really missed having the small engineer around as much as he had been before this whole thing started. While yeah, at least 80% of that was due to purely sexual reasons; Bucky knew there was a portion of himself that just missed Tony’s company and focus being entirely on him every day. Observing Steve’s intense concentration not to cum even though he’d only been fucking Tony for about 10 minutes, Bucky decided he was more than ready to push his friend over the edge. After this he’d have his little engineer back and Bucky really, really wanted Steve to hear Tony scream around his dick.
Bucky huffed out a chuckle as his weight settled onto the hands hold Tony legs open as his hips rose and fell back down. “I’ll go slow Stevie, promise to give you your boyfriend back in one piece.”
Bucky watched through the glass of Tony’s workshop as the other man brought himself to a quick orgasm. He usually remembered to black the glass after finishing with Bucky but had obviously forgotten in his rush to get himself off. Bucky had been playing nice with the little engineer, keeping things light and just getting to know what made the other man tick. He had told himself he’d leave Stevie’s boyfriend alone and not give into what he really wanted. Bucky had every intention of continuing to be a good boy, but when Tony Damn near straddled his thighs all those thoughts flew out the door.
This was when Steve called. Looking down to Tony’s phone where it lay beside them, both men saw who it was. Immediately Tony went to lift off Bucky and answer the call. When he tried Bucky held him in place answering Tony’s phone as he put it on speaker. When Tony didn’t say anything not knowing what to do, Steve voice came through saying, “Hello, Tony you there?”
Bucky raked his hands through Tony’s hair saying, “Your mouth feels so good Doll, wish I could feel it all over. It’s ok you can’t take it all sugar, no one’s been able to do that for me.” Tony was spurred on by the challenge, wanting to do something for Bucky no one ever had. After a few tries he managed to relax his throat enough to swallow all of Bucky, drawing a long low groan from the man. Tony wasn’t sure how long he sucked Bucky down before the man came, but he swallowed it all loving every second.
Bucky looked down at the mess he was making of Tony while driving his fingers slowly in and out of the other man’s body. He had been edging him for the past hour and Tony had responded beautifully to everything he’d done so far. After their talk this afternoon, with Steve alleviating the guilt that had been weighing down Bucky’s mind, he began to really see what was going on between the three of them. Most importantly, he started to realize how to make this work in the best way, giving all of them what they desired.
Tony was lying on his back between Steve’s legs, his eyes fluttering every few seconds as he looked up at Bucky making sobbed whimpers and moans. Bucky was holding Tony up by his knees, bringing their body’s together at an agonizingly slow pace. Steve was lying flat mirroring Tony at the top of the bed, while Bucky sat in his lap. Tony guessed Steve’s view was of Bucky’s completely naked body rolling his hips forward, with Tony’s legs outstretched on each side as Bucky’s hands held them up.
When they arrive on Titan, it’s in complete destruction.
All he gets back is Steve’s soft snoring, and he just smiles and closes his eyes, content to fall asleep right here in Steve’s arms.
This is it, he’s going to die because he can’t breathe and he’s not even sure where he is.
“There’s something going down in New York,” she says, before shoving her screen over to the left, to let Steve and Sam watch it.
Tony is a big dumb idiot for worrying, because Steve’s face seems more than happy with the invitation and it’s confirmed as he replies, “That sounds great, Tony.”
Tony has FRIDAY throw some music on, a little mind numbingly loud rock at 8am never hurt nobody.
[9:31 A.M.]
Tony sighs and looks down at his hands, they’re calloused and scarred from years of engineering and various sleep deprived mishaps in his workshop. Made to look strong when they’re anything but, much like his own psyche. The same hands that we’re encased in the suits gloves that were last used to fight St- Tony squeezes his eyes shut tight, not even wanting to open that box yet.
Steve would disagree, he’d whisper softly,
So, he’ll throw himself head first into the one thing that’s been a constant his whole life.
Unbelievable. Tony thought he was done with this shit.
Princess Shuri gives him a handful of kimoyo beads and makes him promise to bring their king back. Steve can only nod his head, tells her he’ll do everything he can. Okoye grabs her gently by the shoulders when she starts to sob again. She nods at him and he understands. Do everything he can and then some more. He hopes he looks as strong as he’s trying to project.
Giving up his search, Tony slumps back onto the couch, massaging his temples.
“Move over Nat, I’m just getting started.”
“Are you okay, babe?” Steve asks, holding out a bottle of water as a peace offering.
It had started as a joke, the ‘I dare you to do this but I bet you won’t’ kind of joke.
[6:57 P.M.]
“I…might have sent him a certain two-word text, which lead to a few more.”
The problem with undercover missions, Tony thinks, is how slow the clock starts to tick away with every new piece of information earned. Add in one hundred and one degrees of sticky New York heat, and it’s as if the whole world starts moving in slow motion.
Steve held his hands up placating him, trying to exude a calm demeanor to Tony’s shivering terror.
His hand shakes as he digs it out to see that one name on the screen.
“Oh, please do, and electrical engineering,” Tony answers smugly, “and you?”
The door pushes open before he can get an answer and Natasha is walking in close behind him.
“You’ve got some nerve coming here to try and get us locked up again.”
He hasn’t had a single cup of tea since.
woo, did this chapter give me some trouble
Steve gets through the check in process surprisingly quick based on the amount of people packed into the auditorium. He checks his jacket with the energetic blonde-haired girl at the front, and then slaps his sticker number and name tag on the front of his t-shirt.
Tony’s distracted out of his shock by a laugh he knows all too well. Enchantress is standing off to the side from all the commotion and she seems to find it hilarious as Loki is struggling to lift the tentacle off of himself to reach his scepter that had fallen just out of his grasp.
“Nebula, who are you talk-“ Tony stops, and then they all fall quiet.
“Christ.”
He hears Steve let out a breath, and shuffle the phone around, “I’m sorry Tony, I am.”
[9:26 A.M]
(Those conversations that he absolutely doesn't replay over and over in his head after Steve's left.)
“You want to get out of here?”
Natasha had insisted on helping him move back into the compound, despite his wishes. This was no doubt her handiwork. He’ll have to call up Jane Bond herself, and give her a piece of his mind for sneaking this past him.
Sam huffs out a small disbelieving laugh while shaking his head, “I’m impressed.”
Tony whips around scrubbing the water out of his eyes, to see Natasha standing across the island from him.
No matter how much Tony misses the man and the rest of his team, he can’t open himself up to be hurt again.
Tony himself ultimately still doesn’t know, the pain it’s going to be to get Ross to leave him alone after this already has him stressed.
After you’ve been fighting for so long, and god, has Tony been fighting for a long while now.
Steve’s on it immediately, propping a flashlight up and the once pitch black room is illuminated in its harsh glow, before Tony can even flop down onto Steve’s bed with an exasperated groan.
wants to know.
They split into two groups, Natasha, Bruce, and Thor are going to somewhere called Knowhere in the quinjet, and Steve, Tony, Nebula, and Rocket are going to Vormir.
He’s fighting sleep, fighting his mind, for his life, for happiness. No one told him he might have to sacrifice some of those, if he ever wishes to have even one.
The weeks following his release from the hospital, Tony’s bruises may have faded but he can still feel them, bone deep. He doesn’t know what spurred him to move back into the compound, or he’s just not admitting it to himself. Being back in the space he shared with his team, turned friends (turned family) and it now being empty, is not an easy pill to swallow. He’s sent Vision away, letting him hunker down in the Tower for the time being. To be frank, he couldn’t deal with the voice of JARVIS echoing around him, that wound may have scarred over, but it’s still festering underneath his skin. Much like the ache that surrounds him when he thinks of Steve.
Patience isn’t one of Tony’s strong suits. Being born into a family worth billions, he’s never had to wait for anything material he’s wanted. His father Howard was inpatient in all aspects of his life, excluding his never-ending search for the one and only Captain America.
[10:01 A.M.]
They’ve made it up to the third floor and are about to turn a corner when Tony get’s a punch to his face with the butt of a rifle.
Dropping the phone that feels like it’s burning a metaphorical hole through his hand. Why must he always be so damn impulsive?
Tony’s in his workshop, cleaning up some scrap metal he has laying around. Rhodey’s braces are prepared and ready for another test run tomorrow, so it’s all just a waiting game from here.
Tony focuses on the head of Steve’s cock, stopping his kisses for a moment to spit into his hand, reaching down and palming it over Steve, it’s messy and wet, and Tony can feel Steve’s cock twitch hard in his grip.
Tony’s about to interrupt her to tell her to get to the more important part when she chimes in again.
The headache he’s sporting is one for the history books.
,” he said gently, “
[9:31 A.M.]
Avoiding, capital A, is something Tony has had several years of practice in. Spending his childhood avoiding his father’s harsh words and his mother’s pitiful stares, to learning to avert his gaze every time he catches the sight of running water after Afghanistan. Hell, even dodging Pepper’s pleads to care more about his wellbeing then this world they live in, that eventually being the source of their break up among other things.
As the night begins winding down, the songs mostly stay slow, even the attendees with the highest energy begin to tire, Steve and Tony mostly sway together at this point. Conversation on hold to enjoy the music and each other’s presence. At least until Steve’s stomach growls loudly enough that Tony catches it and looks sarcastically up at him.
“I think I’m dead.”
She took his hand and apologized for not telling him about Bucky’s involvement in his parents’ deaths. Explaining how she felt that it wasn’t her place to reveal that to him, but then realized how she had been wrong about that.
Did he mention that he was pissed?
Pulling up the latest emails from Pepper, Tony soldiers through the feeling in his gut, pushing to get back to his automatic numbness.
“Good?” he asks, and Steve giggles, he fucking
Tony can see on Clint’s face when he gets no response back. Swallowing down his own anxiety, Tony steps forward, “Ross set this up, he wasn’t too happy with your escape from underwater Azkaban.”
Steve’s panting as his grip around the man’s waist gets tighter, constricting the soldiers breathing.
Tony's not oblivious, he knows how fast word travels on this campus, and Wasp—bless her, she's mostly innocent—just doesn't know how to keep a secret. Not that this getting to Steve will in any way change the course of action, he's just going to have to attempt to work while ignoring his lizard brain’s need to fawn over this new distraction of muscle and smart mouth that’s an equal match to his own sarcastic digs.
[11:08 P.M.]
Just as Tony’s about to retort back, theres a loud bang from the floor above and his spine stiffens.
“Sir, it is currently 3:47 A.M. and you are in the Avengers Facility in New York.”
Natasha takes Tony aside as Sam and Clint start lecturing Steve on better van hiding spots.
“My contact told me about Ross using his own team to stage what looked like kidnappings around Europe, specifically in places where Hydra had ties in the past, what better way to get Captain America caught in your trap than by using his biggest enemy since the 40’s.”
“This is sanitary.”
He hands the blunt over to Steve and they shotgun again, Steve’s mouth is heaven against Tony’s and soon their ashing the blunt every couple hits they take, and time slows down for them both.
“You can thank Natasha, she was the one who figured it all out, I just provide the money to make it happen.” It sounds more bitter coming out then Tony meant for it to, but he’s not bothered to explain it differently.
“Wow Natasha, who knew you’d be my knight in shining armor, I’m weirdly equal parts scared and turned on.”
And yet, they both never left.
Tony peeks one eye open.
thing untouched of his own to keep. He’s already working on coming up with stronger security to install into JARVIS’ mainframe. This will not be happening again.
She has a point, so Steve turns back to the spice cabinet to root around for the bottle of organic cinnamon hiding behind way too many containers of garlic salt. He unscrews the shiny metal lid, and dumps a tablespoon in to the flour, baking powder, and salt mixture waiting for him. The familiar spicy scent wafts up from the bowl when he whisks it all together, satisfied smile now fixed on his face instead of the earlier frown.
Natasha only slightly opens the door to the second floor for a second, to try and get a look. Instead of answering she just shakes her head.
“Hydra being Ross, and those ‘kidnappings’ all staged, he pulled out all the stops for this,” Natasha reminds bitterly.
But now, as they’re enclosed in another ship, headed for the place where Thanos gained the Soul Stone that helped him in completing his genocide, Steve and Tony have a real conversation.
Sam makes a move to step in front of Steve, but then Natasha calls out to them again.
The burdening price of nightmares, and panic attacks, a constant looping picture of utter destruction playing behind his eyelids.
. So, Tony drinks and he ignores Pepper’s calls, and lets himself ache for something that never was.
The attacker is out cold beneath them, Tony feels a sense of jealousy, how dare he cause this mess and leave Tony with the cleanup.
“No one in their right mind is going out in this heat to buy sex toys Cap, old man Joe was in here a bit ago trying to haggle me for a discount on another pair of fuzzy handcuffs, but other than that we’re all dried out.”
Steve crouches without breaking their lips apart and hoists Tony up onto the counter.
He understands better than most.
[9:29 A.M.]
Tony lets that sink into his brain for a second.
“Yeah, I didn’t say anything earlier, with Buck bleeding and all, but I saw your suit in the trunk,” Steve says with a faux accusing tone.
He had gotten Ross to cut her some slack, and not arrest her for letting Steve make off with their Quinjet. It hadn’t been easy, and he’s sure he’ll be paying for it some way later, but with the Avengers being so low on team members, she’s an asset. And a friend.
For now, the phone is in his hands and he’s well past the point of no return.
The song changes just as Steve’s found his way through the crowd and earns a better view of his subject; a brunette boy, eyes closed, small smile on his face that’s turned up to the moving lights above them as they shimmer over the crowd below. He has one hand in his hair as his feet jump rhythmically on the floor, lost in the music, enjoying himself more than anyone else around him, and Steve’s barely remembering to move his own feet now as he blinks slowly, completely entranced.
“FRIDAY, is Vision still on standby?”
The man he thought was Steve, is now definitely Steve as he turns and catches Tony’s still form. Tony can see that he has Sam with him, both dressed in casual clothes, much different from the last time he saw either of them.
Before Steve can answer, Tony’s climbing out from an alien ship that seems to be broken down.
There are tears pricking at the corners of his eyes, and Steve’s laughing as he smacks Tony on the back, helping nothing, the bastard.
They spend a few moments catching their breath, while Steve’s cum cools on Tony’s skin, collecting their clothing and putting themselves back together in a blissed out comfortable silence. The squeaky ceiling fan above them is still trying it’s best to cool the temperature down, but the sweat on Tony’s lower back tells a different story.
“We have to try Tony, it’s all we can do.”
Tomorrow they can go back to that site, and continue erasing Hydra from the planet with Tony in tow, but for now they’re content with just this.
Tony sends off the completed email to her, and gets ready to pull up schematics for the newest Quinjet he’ll be building, when he hears the ring indicating he’s getting a call.
Sam has a gun aimed at his forehead and Steve looks murderous as he’s cuffed to a metal pole lining the wall using magnetic handcuffs.
“You have the best ideas, remind me to never doubt you again,” Tony replies, rubbing his hands together, ready to find the goods he knows Barnes is hiding away.
Sam just stares at him, long enough to have Tony shifting in his seat, before asking another question, “What did Vis do to get Ross the hell outta dodge?”
He has to bite down on his tongue, to stop from letting more bitterness seep out.
Just as he hears someone about to cross over the threshold of the wall he’s hugging, Tony lunges forward, getting a good grip on the offender’s shoulders and knocking his head into the wall.
Steve's made his way to the left of Tony, studying the multiple screens in front of them, "Good,” he replies, “because I don't feel much like being a babysitter today.”
Tony gets a “Be back in 2 days.” text from Natasha, he didn’t expect much else.
“You’re telling me,” Tony replies, and then reaches down to grip Steve’s length in his hand.
Steve turns around to see Tony haphazardly rolling the sleeves of his shirt up his arms, then noticing the mischievous glint to Tony’s eyes when they meet his. He has to bite down on the dumb crooked smile that’s fighting its way through onto his face.
Tony barely takes in the words, just nodding, agreeing with anything, everything.
It reminded him of the eerie quiet of the water after he had sacrificed himself all those years ago. It was all consuming and he wasn’t sure he’d ever understand what had gone wrong.
“Sir, you have an incoming call from Colonel James Rhodes.”
“Our messages haven’t been going the way I want them to, believe it or not I don’t want to anger you.”
“You’re telling me, that the Secretary of State is planning to actually kill Captain America? How would he even get that sanctioned through the accords and the UN?”
This was a mistake.
He shakily wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and lets out a scoff at how ridiculous this all is.
He and Natasha have been through a lot, she’s the one he’s known the longest, after Rhodey. Who knew you can grow close to a person, while dying from Palladium poisoning.
“Stark!” Thor is cheering then, wrapping Tony in a rough hug, “It’s good to see you’ve made it out well, friend.”
Clint sends a glare his way so heated, a lesser man would have gone up in flames in seconds, but Tony is not a lesser man.
There’s 5 messages waiting.
“Try me.”
And Tony sounds so tired, like he hasn’t slept in days (he hasn’t) and Steve hates it. Not used to Tony being so transparent and outright with his fear.
Steve fishes something out of his back pocket and hands Tony the fried little flip phone, “Remind me to insist you use one of my waterproof StarkPhone’s from now on,” Tony replies while shaking his head at them both.
But Steve just smiles at him, and says, “I thought I was going to have to wait forever for you to notice Octavia wasn’t the only thing keeping me coming around every day.”
“Let it ring Fri, if it’s that important he’ll leave a message.”
It doesn't work.
She raises her eyebrows, smiles, and waits until Tony gets the hint.
With one last look at the shield, now flat on the floor in the middle of the room, Tony slams the door shut behind him.
This, Tony can answer.
“Hmm, alright, I’ll bite, what are you studying?” Steve asks.
Tony didn't go to MIT studying electrical engineering for nothing, if not for something to engross himself into while avoiding the outside world and the feelings that come with it.
A surprise around every corner.
“C’mon Tony, you’re not fine, you’re shaking like a leaf,” Bucky says, wrapping an arm over Tony’s shoulder to bring him closer.
By the time Tony slips back into place behind Steve, the wave of sleepiness is already hitting Steve’s mind again, the last thing he senses before falling asleep entirely, is Tony smoothing his hand across Steve’s stomach, and the sound of something a lot like “I love you” whispered against his shoulder.
—alien ship right above it.
As they step out of the quinjet, the only sound to be heard is the crackling of the flames engulfing various areas of the planet.
After half of the world’s population disintegrated into thin air, there was an unmistakable hush across the universe.
Steve comes just as gorgeously as Tony remembers, his hot cum hitting Tony’s chest, painting across his abdomen and falling slowly into his navel. Tony’s an absolute mess and he’s never been so satisfied in his life.
sorry for the late update, life n all that always hits at the worst times. i hope to get back to daily updates :)
“What kind of spell did you put on her Loki?” Steve asks angrily, tone clearly making Loki aware that he was not in a mood for the usual games.
Steve’s blush always sits high on his cheeks and Tony resists the urge to reach out and pet it.
They’ve barely gotten settled on the quinjet when Natasha makes the announcement.
He’s never liked being put in charge of a team, but he hasn’t got much of a choice now.
But then Tony explained that if they could get to Pym and his quantum technology (and he agreed to help), they could travel to a parallel universe and get the upper hand on Thanos before he even realizes it, effectively stopping him from ever getting a taste of the tesseract and the infinity stones, only then will they have a shot at reversing it all, and getting their family back.
He makes a half attempt to grab his phone, but now that the adrenalines worn off, Tony’s hands are shaking.
“That was one time Rhodey, and you know you can’t start a phone call with ‘I didn’t mean to break it Tony, I swear’.”
There’s some yelling and his vision is swimming, he can’t tell what’s up from down.
But it’s so difficult, after everything that went down not to be defensive. He was left in that bunker alone. And it’s how he’s felt since.
Steve has the dignity to at least look sheepish.
Within minutes they’re cutting through the air, on the path to help Wanda and Vision, and hopefully keep the world safe long enough until Tony can make it back home, and back to Steve.
Tony had immediately suited up, wincing slightly as the suit closed around the wound on his abdomen that Steve’s stomach twisted at.
Tony’s staring out the window, at the vast expanse of space they’re traveling through. There are bags under his eyes and his hair is sticking up in random sections, like he’d been running his hands through it and tugging at it for something to ground him.
Steve feels his frustration burning in his chest, he’s mad at himself, at Tony, and mostly Sam for not letting him catapult himself into space even if his body could manage to withstand the trip. He has to at least
“Yeah yeah, listen Tones, I got a call from one of my military buddies and something big is going down.”
[11:12 P.M.]
Sam gives him a curious look, “You really came all this way to help us?”
So…they’re doing this then, he has half a mind to get his ass out of there, but he’d like to keep it and Natasha is deadly when pissed off.
With one last look at each other, Clint kicks the door open and Tony tenses at the sound of rifles clicking as they’re aimed at the team of three.
Steve shoots him a small innocent smile, a complete opposite of the heated look in his eyes. He pushes Tony back against the glass counter that showcases the more sought after high-end toys, under lock and key from anyone with sticky fingers.
He lets out a sigh before giving in.
Tasking himself to the top priority on his list of projects; adjustments to Rhodey’s braces.
He had done what had to be done, what no one else but he could do, he had accepted that burden.
Tony matches his stride, a calming presence at Steve's side.
It’s something Steve’s heard
and Steve frowns with the effort to not immediately go back for more, as Tony pants with the same effort to hold back. “I’ll see you soon, Steve Rogers,” Tony says when he’s caught his breath, “I remember a promise to show off my robot kid to you.”
Loki’s out of breath as he tries to reply, “I wanted to turn her small again, so I could be the one to raise her, and have her be loyal to
“Turns out, that guy in Germany, was planted, and you’re not going to like by who.”
Steve hauls Bucky a couple more feet until he’s dropping him into one of the chairs next to the mini fridge. Tony manages to unglue his feet from his stance and moves towards the bathroom to grab them towels to get dry.
Were they not friends for years before this mess? Oh, right. Let’s not bring up the ‘He’s my friend’ situation.
winning a bet, and now Steve owes him.
(It was a running joke as he was growing up, that Tony Stark came kicking and screaming into this world, and he could never quite figure out how to stop.)
His heartbeat is loud in his ears.
Natasha and Tony exchange a look, “Sorta.”
He takes a swig out of the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he can’t be sober while thinking of this.
Tony catches the look on Steve’s face and throws a barely there smile his way, “Together, right?”
He swears his heart almost stops as he looks to the crap cell phone Steve sent him (he has developed a habit of carrying it with him from room to room), only to see that its quiet.
As in two men are strong-arming the guy.
Tony’s startled awake by the sound of the room door slamming open. He’s out of bed and switching the bedside lamp on in what feels like the longest two seconds in his life. Inside the doorway is Steve soaked from the rain, holding up Bucky who’s just as dripping wet. The clock on the nightstand reads 7p.m. and Tony’s heart is still thumping hard inside his chest from the scare.
Falling into Steve’s arms was the easiest thing Tony had done in years.
“I’ve missed you, Tony.”
“Who are you?” she asks, venom in her voice.
It’s not entirely what he expects of Steve’s room. The bed is unmade and the sheets thrown back as if Steve had been in a hurry. Tony tries not to think about why. The air is still around him as he enters the room, his eyes immediately catching on a shelf in the corner holding a few frames. Pictures of Steve before the serum, of the Howling Commando’s, of…Steve and Bucky side by side goofy smiles on their faces. Tony turns away, ready to leave the room. He should have known this would just put him in a shit mood.
Steve’s cheeks ache from the endless smiling, and there’s still a lingering cramp in his side from the force of his laughter when Tony leaned in too closely while the butter and sugar were creaming together, not at all expecting to get hit in the face with some projectile butter.
Incredibly awkward silence.
“Stevie, it wasn’t your fault, those bastards knew we were there somehow, you had no idea they’d know,” Bucky insists, already looking a bit more alert, more like he actually knows where he’s at.
Ten minutes later, Tony is high out of his mind.
And away he goes.
Tony sends off Rhodey with a hug and promise to check-in within a few days. Rhodey taking his braces with him, to get in some more practice with his physical therapist.
Tony’s inner nosy mother is so excited for the chance to come out and play.
Just as he’s bending over to stick his mouth under the faucet, someone comes bounding into the room.
Tony can’t believe he’s back here.
It’d be funny but Steve’s almost sure the raccoon intends to steal it.
“Germany big, and I suspect you’re going to be getting a call from Ross soon.”
“You look so fucking pretty like this,” Steve praises, his eyes half lidded in pleasure, “God, Tony, I want to make a mess of you.”
Nebula and Rocket are quick to follow him, and Steve has to make the decision of leaving Red Skull behind without getting rid of him for good, or helping Tony.
“If you destroyed the stone, all of those souls would be lost forever.”
[1:17 P.M.]
Tony shrugs and gives Steve a lazy look, “Listen Steve, we
[9:26 A.M.]
[3:42 P.M.]
Their lips leave with a loud
There’s a beat of silence from his comm before, “
[7:00 P.M.]
Another look casted between Tony and Natasha, “It’s not completely foul-proof, but it’s what we had time to come up with,” Natasha adds to try and wipe the disbelieving look off Clint’s face.
“FRIDAY, pull up the schematics for the Mark 47.”
“Get down!” Natasha’s yelling now, and Tony hits the floor so hard he’s gonna have bruises across the entirety of his knees and shins.
Steve’s panting grows heavier, “Let me see you, “he says, voice hitching when Tony’s fingers brush lightly against his balls.
Their make out session soon dies down though, and they go back to lazy, sweet kisses instead of the full-tongue hungry and frantic from before.
It’s all going as planned until they come upon the van and all four tires are slashed.
Tony makes work of dipping Bucky’s thigh into the water, slowly—so Bucky knows what to expect, and then running some saline solution over it to sterilize.
disclaimer: lyrics belong to Harry Styles.
“What do you want, Rogers?”
Tony’s biggest enemy always does end up being himself.
He contemplates writing back for a full 5 minutes before decides it honestly can’t get any worse than it’s been.
Rocket has one of their quinjets equipped for space travel and ready to go in less time than Steve thinks is probably safe, but they don’t have any time to waste.
Nebula steps forward, “What did he do to Gamora?”
Natasha’s breathing hard and has a look in her eyes that shakes Tony.
Just when he’s about to try to sneak in another quick kiss, Tony’s jaw cracks from the force of his yawn, and Steve knows that putting Tony to bed immediately is what needs to be done, even if he greedily wants more time with the man he's ridiculously in love with.
If someone told Tony he’d be having a conversation with Steve Rogers while tucking into his dinner from his favorite Thai place, he would have laughed in their face. Alas, this just seems to be his life now.
“Well that’s all I have to hear,” Tony starts, before letting his arms drop from around Steve’s neck as he begins posing, contorting his arms and legs all different ways, the funniest vogueing Steve’s ever seen someone attempt and he can’t help the bubble of laughter that escapes his chest, doubling over as the sound only makes Tony get more dramatic with it.
“Either you get me out of these clothes Steve, or have fun picking my melted body off the floor.”
He gets so incredibly wasted he doesn’t wake up until the next afternoon.
Tony flips it open and there’s 2 missed calls and 1 unread text message.
He couldn’t catch his breath, taking short gulps of air with no relief, and Steve was still standing there in front of him. And all Tony could do was scream, “
Under the right circumstances, Vormir would be beautiful, dark violet skies and the same kind of hushed silence that only happens during the first snow fall of the year. But right now, Steve hates it, feels the chill seeping through the tears in his suit, causing him to shiver slightly.
“You can’t bullshit me Tones, I’ve known you too damn long. That’s why I know you're hurting and I’m worried about you. I don’t want a repeat of after New York, you were in a bad way and wouldn't let me help. I won’t let that happen again.”
Once he’s done he leans back, watching Steve’s eye’s flutter open and his lips curve into a smile before letting the smoke exit his lungs.
Everyone bursts into cheers as the first song begins blaring from the speakers, and Steve internally laughs at the song choice, because of course it’s Bowie. But then he spots a group of his friends in the crowd, and heads over to them, accepting their excited greetings as they all begin to dance together.
For now, Tony reaches out to move the damn thing.
Tony’s managed to scrape his bone marrow off the floor, and shakily stand up. “Shooting at me when my back is turned, seems a little cowardly of you, Barton.”
The one thing he could never avoid was Steve. From the day they met arguing on the Triskelion, two fuses ready to blow. Steve was everything his father made him out to be, and completely not. Howard never mentioned how self-righteous Captain America was, only stories about how extraordinarily strong he was and the bravery he had to take on Hydra by himself, never mentioning his weaknesses. Or just his one weakness, Bucky fucking Barnes.
Steve has to swallow down the lump growing in his throat, blink away the tears wanting to prick in the corner of his eyes, it wasn’t worth it. Their war was never worth losing the relationship they spent years building.
“Art,” Steve shoots back just as fast. “Why electrical engineering, robots do it for you?”
[7:03 P.M.]
Theres a good few seconds of heavy breathing before the soldier passes out and then total silence.
Steve.
And Tony is definitely down with that.
“After our last mission, things didn’t feel right, I took a closer look.”
Steve’s own movements feel harsh and clumsy in comparison to his at first, but the song’s beat picks up and they get into a good flow, dancing closely, not quite touching but nearly. Steve’s breathless and there’s a sheen of sweat over everyone in the room, but his new partner doesn’t seem to mind.
There’s just a feeling inside him that’s holding him back.
looking forward to watching Monty Python with you.”
“I don’t have to understand anything Rogers, you couldn’t understand when I was extending you that olive branch in Berlin, why am I held to a higher standard?”
Tony lifts the phone away from his ear, while pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Coming up with unique poses that translate onto paper sounds easier than it actually is,” Steve says, “I only have one more sketch to finish and it’s been breaking my brain for weeks.”
He can’t see anyone else on the floor so he and Natasha move through and toward the knocked-out soldiers.
In mere seconds, just splashes of moments, he forgets he ever made it out, forgets they ever won.
[11:09 P.M.]
Steve who’s unaware of Tony’s mental warfare going on, just laughs lightly before saying, “Show me.”
Where the hell is he going to hide 3 wanted fugitives?
A ping from his left alerts him, breaking the silence of his darkened room.
Tony goes to stand in front of the door to see if he can get a read on his HUD.
Tony’s hands sweat the whole time him and Steve are eating their dinner, and for the first time in his life, Tony finds that he doesn’t have anything to say. Mind completely blank because this is definitely a date, and it’s definitely a date with the guy he’s been crushing on since he got to the Academy.
Steve silently reflects back on the night, the way fate had made it so that one curious glance from across a room led to the most fun he’s had all year at MIT, possibly even longer if he’s being completely honest. His program is intense but so rewarding that he’s not done much but focus on trying to be perfect at everything all this time.
Steve and Bucky settle down into the tub, Bucky leaning back against Steve’s chest.
Steve can only describe the face Tony makes as heartbreaking. His chest constricts as he watches Tony, who he thought had vanished since seeing him disappear into the sky, for the second time now, breathe, and talk, and be
Tony throws the phone across the bed after slapping it shut, it’s just not going to happen.
Steve shakes his head at Tony, “Six and half hours is just as good as eight to me right now, unless you’d really like to stay here by yourself and miss out on perfect, hot and salty french fries.”
They hit the end of the trail eventually, and they pause to stare out at the dark water, shimmering in front of them.
He’s shaken from his stupor at that, and lets out a sigh.
“Idiots.”
Who the hell did Steve think he was? He wanted nothing to do with Avengers business or Tony, and then shows up at a mission. And what had they taken? Tony only remembered that after he had awoken on the jet, making sure to pass the info to Natasha. She had given him a curt nod, and a half smile before strutting off to do spy things.
Tony has a lot of experience with having broken pieces of him left behind in the dark.
It’s very mundane in his opinion, but him and Pepper are successfully working past the awkward “The CEO of the company I own dumped me” phase and Tony would rather not muck that up.
And that’s when Steve hears his voice.
It’s all been going well, they’ve had no problems kicking ass and taking names so far. Steve and Bucky had left late last night and promised Tony profusely they’d be back before he’d be up. The jokes on them, because Tony hasn’t even been to sleep, after so long sleeping with two other people it’s more than a little lonely by himself.
“He told me he’d gotten bored with it a while ago and I just assumed he’d thrown it out but…” Steve pauses, assessing the sheer amount of paraphernalia they dug up, “I guess not.”
The beat up T.V. is on low volume and Tony takes a minute to watch the weather woman in a god awful yellow pantsuit inform 11a.m. viewers of the 70% chance of rain in their future. Judging by the tell-tale trickle of water moving through the gutters above, Tony decides she can keep her job, questionable fashion choices aside.
Walking back into the room, Tony see’s Steve crouching in front of Bucky effectively covering him from Tony’s view.
The ringing in Steve’s ears hasn’t left since Bucky fell.
Steve continues to deep throat Tony, pulling back every now and then to catch his breath, before comfortably opening his throat back up to blow Tony's mind with each swallow. Eventually Tony’s entire body goes taut, stars flying across his vision as Steve sucks the orgasm right out of him.
For Tony to start moving on he needs a distraction. Preferably one not inside of a bottle. Let’s ignore the fact that he’s nursing one hell of a hangover right now though. Being on the wrong side of forty with a drinking problem is the last thing he needs.
“We have to put her in the hot tub,” he says to Steve, and Steve sends him an apologetic look in return.
[7:03 P.M.]
Tony’s ready to type out a quick reply of ‘No’ when said phone starts to ring.
Steve barks out a laugh, stopping his movements against Tony’s neck to say, “I don’t think I’ll ever see a situation with your body and the floor as a bad thing, Tony.”
Tony’s frozen with confusion for about 10 seconds, until he sees the blond hair tucked into the hat of one of the men.
Tony stops, smiling indulgently at Steve, “I’ll be here anytime you need me.”
Red Skull turns toward Tony, and Steve feels his heart rate spike, he's reminded of how deadly Red Skull and his army were, and he doesn't trust him still.
Natasha looks stricken for a moment, before her eyes widen and Tony has a second where feels like his insides are about to fall out from shock.
And oh.
Steve throws his head back as soon as Tony gets a good one or two pumps in. He’s softly moaning and his taut neck is right in front of Tony’s face, who can’t refuse the urge to lean forward and suck slow kisses onto Steve’s flushed skin.
[9:27 A.M.]
Tony was expecting to find some contraband weapons, maybe a pair of dark leather tights, but as he and Steve pile their stash on the bed, he’s shocked to say the least.
He stops dead in his tracks, “What is it?”
Reality and nightmare colliding.
Tony scoots closer, reaching forward to run his fingers through the short hair at the back of Steve’s head, “Now I can’t argue with that,” he murmurs softly, before leaning forward and pushing his lips against Steve’s.
He stumbles over to the kitchen sink to get rid of possibly the worst cotton-mouth he’s ever had.
Tony’s got an empty compound to prove it.
Rhodey leaves them both at that, and Tony hydrates as he was tasked to do, before jumping back into their previous rhythm, although this time with his arms wrapped loosely around Steve’s neck.
, fuck Steve,” Tony mumbles, wondering when the feeling in his toes will come back, and Steve just sits back on his feet, smiling warmly up at Tony, the picture of innocence like he didn’t just swallow Tony’s entire load in one mouthful.
But ultimately, Steve knows Sam is right, as pissed as it makes him, even if he did find a ship to get him up into space, he wouldn’t know where to even begin to look to find Tony.
And god, Tony needed to hear that, needed someone to just
It’s not how his usual quiet day’s off baking look like, but it’s the most memorable one he’s had in a while. Steve likes his routine, but having Tony there as his secret ingredient to always keep him on his toes and introduce him to the art of spontaneity and chaos, it makes all the time spent apart feel worth it.
tentacle, Tony immediately knows this isn’t going to end well.
Is Steve really going to try and do this shit now? He’s going to need to put in an order for more of his favorite whiskey.
“Looks like we’re tied, loser buys the other dinner?”
It’s well into the afternoon when Tony’s just finishing up on the latest upgrades on some small projects for SI that Pepper insisted in several emails had to be done before the end of the week, or they’ll lose a chance to patent.
The fact that they haven’t come back or even checked in by text, has Tony anxious. He can hear the rain really start to pick up outside, adding a storm in the mix is the last thing he needs to calm his worries. Tony knew he should have insisted to go along with them, but Steve had been adamant that they were only going to scope out the site they suspected some Hydra agents to be bunkering down in, and Bucky—the bastard, had kissed Tony into submission with his sharp tongue and promises of a satisfying reunion in the morning.
He has some other small projects he should get a head start on.
After Rhodey has successfully stuffed Tony full of various breakfast foods, he seems satisfied enough to let Tony lead them into the workshop to get started on the tests for his upgraded braces.
“Well,” Tony starts, “This has been a great time, but we really ought to be going now, take this as your one free Tony Stark saves your ass card.”
for right now. Being enough is not something he’s familiar with, not something he’d coin himself as.
What’s left of his team; Natasha and Vision, are a few hours behind him on a separate jet. Tony won’t lie, he’ll admit he’s feeling a little lost. Going from a team of seven to three is disorientating to say the least. And not having Rhodey here as a buffer between him and Ross is looking to be a challenge.
His voice has gone raspy tired, most likely the full exhaustion of the day finally hitting that constantly whirring mind of his.
Tony’s in bed later that night, feeling better than he has in weeks.
I spent years with that monster in my head, and now I don’t know if it’s possible to reverse this.”
They see her first, she looks frustrated, body held tight as she’s pleading with someone to hurry up.
Tony glances up at the
They’d gathered after Thanos had left them licking their wounds, cut in half in the most visceral way. Steve’s stomach soured at the number of the fallen. Reminding him so much of his past life, losing comrades, soldiers, friends, they didn’t deserve the deaths that came to them.
about it.
“Alright Bucky, I’m going to take these pants off you, it might hurt, so Steve here is going to sit up there and let you look into those blue eyes of his and you can get lost in them,” Tony jokes and jerks his head at Steve so he’ll take a place on the bed beside Bucky’s head.
[7:00 P.M.]
Steve loves baking on his days off, it’s calming to him, the order of operations is clear; gather the ingredients, measure them out, pop it into the oven, and watch something he created all by himself come to a sweet fruition. It also helps that he’s usually alone when he bakes or just in comfortable silence with Natasha while she has her midday tea, his favorite songs playing softly in the background.
The only sound coming from the top floor is the occasional footstep, most likely as soon as they open the door they’ll be bombarded with Ross’ men.
“Yeah yeah, you say the same thing every week,” Steve says, shaking his head, “Now I’ll take this side and you get that one.”
Tony had dropped to the floor, his knees hitting concrete with a
“Stay safe Tony, I can’t be there to pick your ass up off the floor anymore.”
Steve looks so relieved, dropping one of his hands out of Tony’s to cup his cheek, “I would love that a lot,” he says, before leaning in to softly kiss Tony on his forehead.
He sits in the common room for an hour and mulls over all his greatest fuck ups in life, this makes at least the top 20.
Steve, why let this recipe stop you now.”
Steve is reaching over Tony to grab a bag from a hidden spot, before pulling back to shake it at Tony, “Lifesaver Gummies?”
A genius, super solider, spy, archer, and a dude pretty good at flying all walk into a jet, what does this lead to?
Leave it to Steve to awake something in him, not even anger, but…longing.
want to make it through.
“I’m glad you were here Tony, it really helped me have the strength to drag Bucky all the way over knowing that you were waiting for us,” Steve says.
Thinking about the cold shower he’s going to have when he gets back to their safe house, Tony wills himself to have an ounce of patience.
Christ.
Tony wants to avoid thinking about Steve, but all these feelings have emerged from seeing him again. It’s been 72 hours since the mission and Tony’s only grown angrier since.
Tony has only smoked once with Rhodey, and it was the type of shit weed that barely gets you high and leaves you with a headache for the most of the day afterwards, so it wasn’t much of an experience.
Steve holds his hands up placating him, “Okay what do you want me to do, oh brave King Tony?”
Bleeding mouth and fractured soul.
As far as plans go, it’s not a terribly bad one, Tony’s just not happy about it.
He had apologized for his remark, even though he defended that it felt justified.
Steve just melts, his heartbeat thudding in his ears from the soft, comforting feeling of Tony hugging him. It's exactly what he needed after the week he's had, and Steve burrows as deep as he can into Tony's chest.
Steve shudders as the last of his orgasm passes, cuddling close to Tony, sharing another open mouthed kiss, “Thank you, Tony,” he whispers like Tony just gave him the greatest gift on earth.
Steve pushes Tony’s hand off himself, kneeling down so Tony’s leaking cock is right in front of his face. Tony’s brain breaks at the filthy image Steve makes. The fact that at any second Bruce could walk out of the back room and catch them like this, the fact that an unknowing stranger could waltz in through the unlocked front door and be met with the sight of Tony’s dick buried in Steve’s mouth shouldn’t turn Tony on so much. He doesn’t have any more time to worry about their reputation though because Steve is breathing hard through his nose, nuzzling down Tony’s cock like a man starved, swallowing hard around Tony.
Natasha is the first one to hear the talking. They don’t know what to expect, anyone could be waiting to kill them, so Steve takes front of the line with Thor in tow.
“FRIDAY get Vision over here, we have a plan to sketch out.”
Natasha breaks her stance, and moves to sit beside him.
It’s only then that the boy’s eyes open and meet Steve’s instantly.
And, he can feel himself clamming up, wanting to cut off all the emotions he can, until he can be alone to deal with them.
Steve bites his lip, holding back a bucket load of things he wants to say, only letting his brain entertain the idea of reaching out and holding Tony in his arms again for a moment, and maybe, if allowed that is, the idea of kissing Tony, right here. He shakes it out after those few moments though, insecurity barging its way in.
God, he can’t handle this.
The bed still smells like Steve’s shampoo and a twinge metallic from Bucky, it’s comforting enough that Tony starts to lull to sleep, so he lets himself catch up on his lost sleep from the night before.
floor’s entrance.
Tony pulls the stupid phone out to turn it off, but then something in him decides against it.
He wants to get drunk and fuck off any responsibility, but Rhodey’s been calling to check in, and is coming up in a few days to try out the adjustments Tony made to his braces. Not to mention, FRIDAY’s been giving him the cold shoulder since he didn’t let her blow Steve to bits, she can be very vindictive when she wants to be.
“Cap, we’ve got to get a move on.” Sam interrupts the stand-still, throwing worried glances to the security cameras that Ross is sure to be watching.
So, he lets himself breathe, and find solace in Tony’s ability to fight and withstand even the harshest environments in his armor, and he says, “Let’s go to Scotland.”
It’s easy to put on a strong front when there’s a crisis, but in reality, Tony is shaken up.
Leipzig, Germany.
And that’s when he sees the blood, dark red staining Bucky’s once clean blue jeans.
Tony motions for Steve to come back up, pulls him close to plant a fierce kiss against Steve’s swollen lips, tasting himself on Steve’s tongue, as he whispers, “I thought you were going to make a mess of me, Rogers.”
Tony waited a full 10 minutes with no reply before heading off to his workshop. Maybe Steve finally realized that they’re past help.
“Widow, was that you?”
“What’re we baking up today, boss?”
Nebula is stiff next to Steve and he hears her stop breathing, then Rocket is crying out, “I’m gonna kill that purple bastard!”
Steve’s shield was propped up behind the half ajar door against the wall. Placed purposefully so if you just peeked in, you’d completely miss it.
Sleeping is the last thing he wants to do. And yet, Steve is there, every night with warm embraces and soft words. He makes Tony want to
The pad of Steve’s thumb is cool from his bottle, and Tony locks eyes with him just as Steve brings said thumb to his own mouth, tucking it in and sucking away the drop. Tony’s throat dries right back up despite having just wet it, and he takes a moment to swallow it away. Steve’s still eyeing him and the temperature in their little bubble goes up 10 degrees.
Tony smiles sweetly at the words, “I definitely missed you more.”
“Really?” Steve smiles excitedly, “Have you made any yet?”
Steve makes a tutting noise and squeezes Tony’s hand, “We told you to stay Tony, and it’s nobody’s fault but those agents that Bucky got hurt, we would have never not checked in either, that one is my fault for being so clumsy with my phone, we’re sorry you were so worried, we love you Tony,” Steve replies.
Steve looks like an extra from a horror movie set, and Tony’s face doesn’t look much better.
“This is yours?” Tony asks, eyes wide as he takes in Steve’s shiny black motorcycle that he’s incredibly proud of.
Steve sends him a grateful look, and Tony has to give himself a second to breathe through his internal freak out.
He’s scooped the batter into the muffin tins now, checking again to make sure they all got the same amount for uniformities sake, before using his thumb and index finger to sprinkle some sugar lightly over every muffin, the extra coating giving it that caramelized and crispy exterior he adores.
“Alright Rogers, let me show you the fine art of the shotgun,” Tony says, and grabs the blunt back up from where he placed it on Steve’s nightstand.
“We drove here, parked the van down the street,” Steve answers instead, his voice strong but Tony catches the hint of weariness in it.
They’ve been holed up in a shitty roadside motel for the past 3 days, their room is on the second floor and they’ve been squeezing into a queen-sized bed every night. Not that Tony’s made any complaints of being in between two beefed up super soldiers, it’s just all very family road trip. Their definition of road trip meaning half planned missions to chase subgroups of the ever-infamous Hydra of course. But, far be it from Tony to tell Steve and Bucky their plan to erase every Hydra head from the face of the earth might be futile, this has been almost 80 years in the making for the two.
And everything is perfect.
Clint stops and deadpans at them, “You followed us all the way here, to only sort of have a plan?”
Hmm. Tony knows he’s only getting a small percent of the story, but he’ll leave it for now.
The excitement of getting to see everyone’s reactions later when they dig into the warm muffins is already bubbling, but the one person he really wants to see enjoy one hasn’t been seen since a quick sleepy morning kiss goodbye. And if Steve is being completely honest with himself, maybe these muffins are being used as bait to get his boyfriend to come out of his lair soon, but no one can blame him for that.
Tony fumbles, spraying most of the water straight up his nose and then down his shirt, effectively drowning himself.
But they have no time to dawdle, and make it up two more floors unscathed, Tony now holding up the back, with his sore knees and bleeding cheek.
“Sir, should I prepare the suit’s defenses?” FRIDAY seems to have caught on faster than him, but Tony’s words feel caught somewhere in his throat.
Tony does so in favor of gripping onto the back of Steve’s head and pulling hard on the short hair there, causing Steve to hiss before slamming their mouths back together.
There’s tables with snacks and drinks along the farthest wall and only a five minute wait until the announcer climbs up onto the small stage, briefly thanking them all for coming and donating to the charity, before eagerly counting down from ten to begin the start of the night.
Octavia has almost grown to her full size by the time Tony finally finds the courage to ask Steve out.
He will make it right. He’ll bring them back no matter what.
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this, I just wanted to protect the world Rhodey. No one else should die if it can be avoided, what’s so wrong about that?” Lot’s apparently. Tony throws his head back to the stiff pillow beneath him.
[9:29 A.M.]
Tony steps up to clap a hand on his shoulder, “Let’s go get him back.”
But he also needed her, so he swallowed his anger, accepting her apology while still being cautious. If he had lost her too in this split, he’s not sure he’d still be standing.
Another week passes and by the end of it Tony decides he needs to start working on his new suit. The old one is sitting in a box in the mansion, where he keeps the rest of his 40 some years’ worth of emotional baggage.
That sends a river of emotions through Tony.
Tony fakes that he’s about to run up, and the soldier takes one more step back, just close enough for Steve to pull up on the metal bar and get his leg’s wrapped around him.
Tony’s okay, he’s
Speaking of surprises, it seems Steve didn’t expect Tony to reply, because now he’s being stingy with the details.
And god Steve means it, he wishes Tony could have been with them in Wakanda, meant it when he told Ross that Tony was their best defender, and they were weaker without him. Tony always had Steve’s full trust.
Tony wilts at that, “You ever gonna let that go? Jeez, a man has a few panic attacks and gets his house blown into the Pacific and he can never live it down.”
He’s barely walked into Steve’s room at the Maverick Dorms and the power had just gone completely out. It had been shoddy for the better part of the day; with the constant flickering, several busted street lamps, and his name on the tower reading ‘TARK’, that had a good majority of Enchantress’ crew snickering at him. And now just as he’s made it to Steve’s for their weekly movie night, his plans are foiled by the villain of the week,
aliens destroy everything Tony has fought to protect. He let his guard down, let all his cracks and the half ass bandage job be shown for Steve to see, and he was mortified.
amazing, that’s such a
“Rhodey!” Tony shouts excitedly, “It’s not my fault you left me out here all by lonesome, who can blame me for keeping myself entertained?” Tony turns back toward Steve smiling warmly “I got myself a Steve now,” Tony adds, and Steve feels his back straighten on instinct, making himself taller and turning his chin up ever so slightly at this Rhodey.
Steve moans into Tony’s mouth, “God, you’re perfect Tony,” he says sweetly, reaching down to wrap a hand around himself, stroking at an impossibly fast pace, watching Tony lay back against the counter, a heated look in his eyes, waiting for Steve to fulfill his promise.
“It wasn’t too late for you to get out of the weapons business, or to stop Ultron from blowing up the planet.”
He never found where the crappy little phone went, so they had no way of just texting Steve to turn his ass around and run for the hills.
Not that Steve would be keen to believe him anyways, with how their last conversation went.
With Rhodey coming up to the compound tomorrow, he’s got other things to worry about.
What matters is that both Steve and Tony were so extremely worried for their girl last night, that they hadn’t had time to talk about what happened between them. So, Tony stops Steve where he’s trying to sweep all the glass away and grabs hold of his hands.
“Good?” Steve asks, waiting for permission, and Tony can only nod, breathless at just the small gesture alone.
It’s a dumb question, so instead of answering right away Tony stretches, groaning at the knot pulling in his upper back, and completely missing the look Steve’s giving him as the skin on his lower back is exposed.
After their short talk, Sam leaves to go sit next to a slumbering Steve, and Tony eventually dozes off with one thing on his mind.
feed you that line, not our fault you fall for it every time.”
Natasha stops him with a short, “Tony.”
Before Steve can process, he’s saying, “I’ve got to go to New York, Tony he’s—he,” his voice dying out as the entire weight of Tony’s situation starts dawning on him.
Flipping open the screen, Tony’s heart is already picking up its beat.
Steve helps Bucky back up and all three of them squeeze into the small bathroom.
Nasty things said, words cutting deep.
His head is throbbing as Sam and Natasha wait on him for his reply, but how can he choose? Why can’t Steve have a choice in front of him that doesn’t end in a loss for once in his life? And god, it burns him up inside, that it’s been years since he’s been in the same room as Tony, and now he’s not even on the same planet as him.
“I’ve got to go Tony, please remember what I said in the letter I sent, I’m sorry.”
“And he knew me Steve, he
His fingers have gone numb, and Tony’s sure he’s dying.
They’re showing footage of some kind of circular alien ship and Tony rocketing towards it, before disappearing as the image goes too grainy to make out what’s happening. Steve’s so focused on every single second of the video they’re replaying on the screen, that at first, he doesn’t hear his phone ring, or feel the buzz in his pocket against his thigh. The phone he hasn’t been two seconds away from for years now, just waiting for it to light up with one name.
“Steve, baby, I’ll marry you right now if you make me these for the rest of our lives.”
Or at least he’ll keep telling himself that.
The point is, Tony accepted that he wasn’t gonna make it, and yet, he took that first breath, and he opened his eyes to Steve’s. And damn could he
Tony scoffs, then hisses, “You’re going to fix her, before I tell Fury to get Odin down here, and then you won’t be the only one finding a train wreck funny,” he threatens, his heart breaking at how scared the octopus must be.
He snorts loudly, is this actually happening right now.
There’s nothing at first, before he hears, “Cap?”, and then a huge wave of relief washes over him.
Texting Steve has brought up a lot of buried feelings he’s not ready to sift through. He’s not sure if he’ll ever be.
i appreciate any and all forms of feedback.
Steve takes a step towards him, but thinks better of it when FRIDAY raises one of Tony’s repulsors charged to fire. She’s still pretty pissed about Siberia.
Tony lets himself admire Steve admiring, before he forces himself to get it together and answer Steve’s question.
No mission ever goes strictly as scheduled, so Tony was expecting some hiccups.
Steve looks over at him, and Tony’s just shaking his head, “Steve, we need answers, remember?”
“Definitely need more cinnamon next time, but of course Tony, for the rest of our lives.”
“She’s over here,” Tony says, before moving to the back of his lab to show Steve where he has everything set up.
The cookies are cooling down now, but Tony is seconds away from asking Steve for a third time if they can break into one yet, so Steve gazes fondly at their batch of various sized cookies, before he picks up a silly looking one that Tony definitely tried to shape into something but ended up failing spectacularly.
Other than that, there were 2 Orientations that were so rare they were actually called
Steve spoke around a smile but didn’t open his eyes. Tony leaned over to kiss his lips, an echoing smile in place. “You say that like its incentive for me to stop.”
When the bartender brought him back his drink, instead of leaving Tony began to flirt back with the other man. He tried to remember what he said his name was. David, Damian, Daclan … Whatever, it was Da-something, Tony could make it work until whoever he was had served their purpose. He wouldn’t take the other man home, Tony didn’t do Dom’s, but he knew playing as if already taken always attracted more attention.
“I don’t think fine is the word I’d use to describe you right now. Manic yes, borderline crazy maybe, but definitely not fine. When’s the last time you even ate anything? When’s the last time you slept?”
Bucky knew Tony’s moan as he orgasmed was most definitely thinking of him.
Tony looked at Steve as he shifted on Bucky, looking as if he were repositioning. “Oh it’s more than ok, he’s already worked out a few of
It had been 5 days since Bucky had come to their room with his feigned nightmare, and he hadn’t touched Tony since. Tony had woke to a myriad of sensations rippling across his skin, all gathering together and catching fire inside him. Gasping softly his mouth dropped as he felt what could only be Bucky’s huge cock sliding inside him. Tony had looked up to Steve to make sure he was still asleep, then looked over his shoulder to the man assaulting his senses to whisper to him. “Bucky, please… Uhh, need you just like that… Ummm missed you so much.”
Thanks for all the kudos and comments so far!!!
So yeah, Nat it was.
Bucky was beyond words, beyond thoughts. He just wanted to keeping fucking Tony until he felt like he owned every part of him. Wanted it to be plain for everyone to see, never leaving anyone in doubt. Steve calling his name from where he sat leaning on the headboard, finally trickled into the possessive haze clouding Bucky’s mind. Steve was panting as though he’d run a marathon while his cock stood at attention, already hard again even though he’d only just come. “Bucky, what are… We talked and said…”
Still looking embarrassed but slightly more at ease Steve nodded. “I know, you’re right, I can tell you anything… you’ve always been there for me.” Bucky gave him a smile of encouragement as he continued after taking a deep breath. “Tony and I haven’t been having, um… you know… We, uh, haven’t been…” Steve broke off waving his hand in the air.
Chuckling Steve settled Tony in his lap and began to massage his shoulders. “Guess I better pay attention then.”
Tony could only lie there and take nips of teeth against his lips and tongue dipping to dominate his mouth, as he was unable to coordinate any other movement except begging moans to Bucky for relief. So overwhelmed, Tony only barely registered Bucky exclaiming, “Oh Damn, fuck I’m sorry Tony, gotta stop,” and even after his brain still took 2-3 minutes to process while Steve and Bucky spoke.
In actuality, Tony didn’t want a repeat of last night. He needed some time to figure out how to make sure Bucky didn’t make him lose his mind again.
There were two downsides to this plan, one Tony had expected but the other came as an unwelcome surprise. He anticipated that if he started to make friends with Steve, the other man would want the information flow to go two ways. This unfortunately meant Tony had to let Steve get to know him a little in return. There were questions Tony wouldn’t answer, and to his surprise Steve never tried to pry one from him, but he still had to answer most to avoid suspicion.
After waking, he made his way down to the communal kitchen. The team looked to be finishing up breakfast, laughing and talking above empty plates. He settled a heavy glare Steve’s way saying, “What the hell did you do to me Rogers.”
It had been four days, four long excruciatingly sex deprived lonely nights, since Tony had said yes to Steve. Why was Tony sex deprived when he had the epitome of everything a sub could want in a Dom? Well, that was because Steve my middle name is chivalry Rogers refused to take Tony to bed. The only thing that had changed in their relationship was that Steve had grown slightly… Ok, a better word would probably be enormously, possessive of Tony. Other than that, nothing had really changed. Steve had pretty much already been treating Tony like his sub for months without the actual titles.
Tony looked at Bucky as he reached the door and said, “I think I hate you a little for what you’ve done to me.”
…Back to when he presented, and the universe gave him a huge fuck you.
Tony’s looked at him doubtfully as he turned his anger back to who it landed on initially. He was gearing up to toss more accusations through the room when Steve interrupted him before he could say a word. “Quiet Tony, we both know I didn’t do any of what you’re saying and you’re angry for other reasons.” Lifting his eyes from where he was pouring more coffee into a mug, Steve leveled Tony with a look that promised consequences he didn’t want should his directions not be followed. “Now sit down while I bring you some breakfast.”
The day Steve came back from his mission, he called to tell Tony and let him know he was alright. Tony and Bucky had just had lunch when Bucky pulled him into the living room to watch TV with him. Unfortunately for Tony, the man decided he wanted to feel Tony around his cock as they did. Bucky bent Tony over the living room sofa to prep him before sitting him down to stretch around Bucky’s hardness. Bucky settled on a movie for them leaning Tony back against his chest to rest Tony’s head on his shoulder. Tony tried to sit still, even enjoyed just feeling of fullness, but every shift of their bodies caused sparks through his body. Bucky would just swat his thigh when he knew Tony moved to get more stimulation and not just to become more comfortable. Every so often Bucky would push into Tony, telling him how good he felt, before settling them back as they were.
Edging Tony closer to his climax, he quivered feeling a sick thrill from Bucky’s veiled words. “We’re about to brief now so I should be back in a couple hours.”
“No problem Buck, just let me know,” Tony heard from behind Bucky as Steve began punching at the bag again.
Slapping her hand away from his face Tony asked, “What do you mean not coming with you?”
By the age of 11, he had devoured a wealth of knowledge, thought he had a good enough foundation of what he’d be in store for when he turned 16. That was the age when everyone’s orientation always made itself known. You’d begin to feel the effects almost immediately on the day of your birth, but would be tested the day after to verify and document what you presented as.
Tony only lasted another 3 or 4 minutes, Bucky’s assault inside Tony drove him over the edge yelling, “Yes Bucky, Ah. God yes... I’m yours.” Tony felt like he’d been struck lightning as he came, feeling a shock wave through his entire body.  Exhausted at the impact of his release, Tony body became limp in Bucky’s arms.
Steve tightened his hold just shy of painful. “It’s not true sweetheart, none of that is true.”
Bucky murmured apologies to Steve as he pulled back. He took a moment to regain his control before he pushed back in, careful not to give the other man more than he could handle. Once recovered, he focused his eyes back to Tony’s face and saw the confusion on it. Steve was slowly drifting out of it between them and hadn’t noticed yet. Continuing his slow glides he stroked the leg Tony had lay on Bucky’s side to get his attention. When brown eyes fluttered open to focus on him Bucky asked, “What’s wrong sugar?”
Finally letting go of the iron grip he had on Tony, Steve pulled back. He brought their heads back together as he cupped Tony’s cheeks in both hands staring into his eyes. “The day I came down to your lab, I told you I knew all the ways you wanted to give in, and all the ways to get you there. I’ve never lied to you Tony, every word I’ve ever told you is true. I would never have told you I could get you there if there was ever any doubt that I could.”
“But that’s just it, I did by not trusting my instincts more. I shouldn’t have waited, should have talked to you sooner…” Steve pulled Tony to his chest, holding him close while he pressed their cheeks together. “I hate that you’ve spent so long thinking something that’s not true.”
“Never said you were my sub.” Instead of the fight he wanted all Tony got back was a shrug. “I’m here because I want to be and don’t have anywhere else I need to be other than right here. What you should be asking yourself, is why you still haven’t asked me to leave. You and I both know I’d respect your wishes.” Steve then picked back up his pencil and lowered his eyes back to his work, effectively giving Tony a dismissal without a word.
Feeling more at ease Steve laughed as he jokingly slapped Bucky’s thigh. “Shut up ya jerk. Tony and I started having sex pretty much as soon as we got together so, 3 years.”
He continued his motions until Steve was hard again, Bucky let out frustrated sound as he saw Steve’s breathing increase again to labored pants. Pulling out of Tony he stood saying, “Guys sorry, this isn’t working. I can’t move in Tony like he needs me to with these pants on.” Bending over Bucky took off his pants and lifted back up to fold them, placing them on the coffee table. He moved slowly through the motions wanting to give each man a long hard look at his arousal, sticking straight out beneath his shirt.
As soon as the lab door closed Tony had his pants opening. He was sorry to say it only took two strokes before he came so hard it left him breathless.
Bucky broke Tony’s concentration when he stopped moving and his hands began traveling down Tony’s chest then up to rest against his thighs. Bucky’s voice was low with arousal as he stared with lust filled eyes down at Tony. “God Tony, Stevie told me your ass was addictive, pure fucking sin is more like it.” Tony grew even more heated at his words as Bucky pushed down at the inside of Tony’s knees bringing his ass up slightly off the bed. “Gonna break you open for me, split you wide. Maybe you’ll be the one that can finally take every inch.”
Dom’s were categorized along the same lines as a
They all settled in together holding each other after laughing at Tony saying, “Sounds like the Star Spangled Man has a plan.”
Even if it was true now, by the end of the week, Bucky would own Tony’s heart just as much as his owned his body.
Bucky looked to Steve, probably asking for some type of permission or confirmation, before he continued on. Tony’s ass rose up a little higher as Bucky leaned down changing the angle, hoping to get the last inch inside. He continued with the circular motions again, sliding his shaft completely out as he repeated it again and again, getting a tiny bit more inside each time. Tony had to work even harder to keep his groans at bay as he felt Bucky getting deeper inside of him.
“Ok, sounds good, Night Buck. Night Tony, sweet dreams baby.”
Seeing Tony was about to come again, Bucky began to slow his fingers, angling away from Tony’s prostate as he denied Tony another climax. He leaned down to devour the other man’s moans of protest briefly, loving the feeling of Tony’s lips shaking against his own along with the rest of his body. “Mmm, I don’t know sweetheart, love the feel of you shaking against me. But maybe… Maybe if you tell me why you love me inside you so much, why you always come so hard over and over on my cock, I’ll finally let you have it.” Bucky stared down into Tony’s brown eyes as they began to tear up in frustration. “Can you do that for me sugar? You do and I’ll give it to you like you need it, I’ll finally let you come.”
Although he was angry with Bucky at first, when the soldier nodded pointedly to Steve with raised eyebrows Tony knew he was actually trying to get him back on track. Tony spoke as best he could but found it nearly impossible. It was hard to focus with Bucky’s tongue now plunging teasingly into Tony as Steve jerked himself closer to completion. Bucky gave Tony’s center the same treatment he gave Tony’s cock, starting out with teasing licks before diving in fully. “I like that he, uh, edges me a little with his tongue… Fuck Bucky yes, uhhh just like that, um, before he really gives it to me… Ahhh, God please Mmmm… really gives it to me how I want it.” Tony continued telling Steve what Bucky’s tongue was doing to him until he was seconds away from coming. After Bucky had switched back to sucking his cock and fingering him open, Tony moaned out, “Oh God, I’m gonna… Fuck Bucky yes Uhhh…”  But before he could cum Tony was cut off from his orgasm. Bucky completely stopped all motions and rose up to stand over both men sitting on the bed.
