"Shh, I'm right here.” Barnes leans in to place a kiss on his omegas forehead and wipe away the tears escaping from Loki's closed eyes. “I won't leave you alone. We're gonna get through this together.” Loki trembled and choked on a sob forcing its way past his lips. “I'm sorry..so sorry. I've tried so hard, but I'm broken.” Why did everything ache, why couldn't he just die? “No..No you're not Loki, I want you to listen to me baby. You are not broken, you're just hurting and that's ok. I know now and I'm kickin myself for not seeing it sooner. You know I love you more than anything, and no mater if we have kids or not I'll have you.”
“I'm sorry Mr. Stark. Your wife did not survive." the midwife said, standing just outside of the door where Maria Stark took her last breath.
Along with no missions, Steve also had to curb his usual exercise regimen. Gone were the days of 5am runs in central park followed by 300 sit-ups, pushups and squats. In its place was now light jogging on the treadmill and morning yoga with Bruce.  It was different but it wasn’t terrible, although if a certain Alpha had his way ‘enthusiastic sex’ would have replaced everything as workout numero- uno.
“Alright spill it before I call Katniss in to come in there and tell you all about Phil’s last heat, trust me he loves telling and you wont want to know. Literally it’s like having acid poured in your ear and stirred with a drill.”
Steve takes the outburst in stride. “Maybe I just wanted to talk and you're the only one I have bored yet with all my stories from the old days about being the little skinny kid always left out and never taken seriously.  Most of them aren't so depressing, no matter what Tony might say.”
“ANTHONY!” Everything had been a blur, pulling the child into his arms and giving him a shake. “Wake up darling…come on Anthony …come on my boy…” Loki felt like his heart was breaking as the healers tore his baby from his arms.
They both knew why but thankfully, Hansen didn't call to make this an uncomfortable conversation about a one-night stand over a decade ago. She was kind enough to explain how the nano techknowledgy had expanded to encompass a branch of study that had led her down a path that no one should tread. "...Extremis is the solution to the sought after super-soldier serum, I never meant for it to be that but when I saw what it could do. It got away from me, I trusted the wrong people.”
“Full Steam Ahead!”
Pepper looked away chewing on her lower lip, "I'm sorry Tony, and I wish I didn't have to do this."
“You look beautiful.” Darcy said, placing a few more gems along the dorsal grooves of Jane’s tail. Each little bauble sparkled as it caught the light and reflected off the Mers teal colored scales.
Unable to remain in bed, Loki retreated to the kitchen as soon as the hour seemed plausible enough for it- a quarter past 9am was fair enough. Bare feet hitting the wood floor with a soft creak, he looked over his shoulder for a brief moment to make sure he hadn't woken his alpha. After missions, James tended to be a rather light sleeper. It often took several days at home for his circadian rhythms to even out into something like a normal person. Thankfully, it appeared that this morning was being kinder and the brunette rolled over snoring softly into his pillow. At least one crisis averted.
The familiar voice causes Steve to relax, “Can you tell me what’s going on with the…bubble?” Steve said gesturing to the wall.
The alpha rolled his eyes, “Yeah I’ll take my chances, you look like crap capcicle. Go take a hot shower and get in bed. I swear I will purell myself.”
There's a pause after she talks about Pepper preparing the nursery and Bruce assembling the furniture. “So, how are things with you and Loki?” The why Bucky and Loki haven't had any pups yet is lingering in the innocuous question. He knows she’s avoiding the subject out of respect. Somehow, that doesn't take away the sting.
Loki had always managed to hold his head high, through all the muck and mire, he somehow came out the other side with as much class as grace as you'd expect from royalty.
“Right. well Steve needs to hurry, this storm is getting worse.”
“Got it!” The axe shotgun sliced through the mechanical assailant’s skull with a satisfying crunch. “Ya know, I'm starting to get a little tired of these guys. I mean, is everything automated these days?”
“Not funny, you are not funny Reindeer games.”
“Brucey bear, how would one treat latent heat now-a-days?”
Thor offered to take Loki back to Asgard; he said maybe one of the kingdoms healers could help Loki. The omega hadn’t said a word since that night at the hospital. It had been three weeks, they buried their daughter - James named her Cecilia. It was one of the names on a list Loki had started to make, something about it seemed right. Like he could picture himself chasing a toddler and calling ‘come on Cece’, he wasn’t going to get to do that now.
James turned slightly before the doctor could intervene. “Doll I don't think that's what the Doc is sayin. Right Bruce?”
Stark entered the Lab walking past the workstations and various mechanics, walking steadily back to a door on the north wall. Placing his hand on a scanner open the room to reveal a small lounge with a bed, sofa, and mini bar. It was an escape for Tony, and in truth, he had made it as an emergency nesting room at first. It was a fanciful idea that if he ever had a mate it would be a safe small room in the depths of the tower that would serve well for an unexpected heat or if there was an issue in the penthouse. Alas these days the room was little more than a bachelor dorm, with its tiny attached bathroom and laundry area. Tony would use it when he was locked in the lab for days at a time.
“Look at my poor baby.” Stark purrs in a filthy whisper. All the while running his hands up his lover’s thighs and grabbing the waistband of the clingy uniform. The material fell and pooled around Steve’s ankles, if anyone happened to open the door now there would be no way to hide.  Tony smirked up his solider knowing when that realization occurred to the blond. “Don’t worry baby, I’ll take real good care of you”
When he sits down wordlessly, she can almost taste the bitter sulking, he's holding back but just barely. There is something else he's hiding to, it familiar because she's scented it on others. Pain...but not just any kind of pain, this is anguish and self-loathing. It's the kind that destroys a person from the inside out like a cancer. A burned rotted kind of pain. James was right to worry too.
And we are back ! Welcome to book 2 of avengershots. I hope you will all love it here. Feel free to request pairings!

The glint of dark blue metal in the agents palm said it all. A lighter with Steve’s Shield on the front. It was slightly dented and he knew….
When they made it back to Head Quarters, Barnes took both folders in hand and shooed Natasha away, “Let me handle this, you get home. Don't fight me on this Tashka! “ He warned pointing a metal finger to the doors.  “Go home.”
Peter and Wendy were already excitedly talking and clamoring all over Loki who seemed to take the attention in stride. He knelt down and nodded with rapt attention at their little stories and the 'show-and-tell' period of what they decided to wear today.
The alpha sighed, “ok then. Guess I'll be back soon.” James took the note and stepped around the bar to press a kiss to his cheek. “Love you.”
Natasha tilted her sunglasses down the morning sun sparking the gold rim of the ray bans. Her gaze settling on the red corvette that pulled up into the trendy little café in Riverdale, Bronx.
There was no reason at all to come out of the warm shelter of infinite softness also known as a bed until a grossly indulgent hour. Preferably, one no earlier than noon. Except there was something not quite kosher and there really shouldn't be because this was his day off damn it. Yet there it was an ever persistent tugging at his synapses that said something was amiss in his safe little universe exclusive to these four walls.
"I'm not a child.. yes I can." He said begrudgingly, fighting the urge to snatch up the milk when it appeared on the table.  Bruce poured him a glass and pushed it on him. Loki was grateful though silent on that matter as he gulped the dairy down. What sweet ambrosia that was.
Loki held her gaze defiantly, “I think it is, I think it's what you all want. The monster to get what’s coming to him, well here you have it. I do so hope it was worth the wait.”
“Didn’t I just have some?” Steve quipped with a yawn.
“Hey…come on.” Steve offered his hand with a tired smile. Tony looked at the hand and then up at the blond, the skepticism Steve saw there hurt. This was going to be a long road but one he’d gladly walk.
Who would have thought Loki could be more temperamental than he usually was? Add a sprinkle of pregnancy hormones and apparently, awful temper tantrum miracles do happen!
The alpha nodded and pulled out a near by chair, sitting in the companionable silence.
“That sounds great.”
The asset struggled, his metal arm hanging useless from the repulsor blast. His remaining human hand desperately trying to lodge a knife between the side plates of the armor.
Howard tucked his son in to the cradle and turned, surprised to see the blond siren standing on two legs (completely nude).
“I’m right here Steve, I love you so much.”
All face that haunted him , that voice ringing in the back of his head moments before he realized he had to put the plane down. Schmitt in the camp where he found the 187th and Bucky. Surrounded by flame as he tore away the false skin, Bucky falling.. Bucky above him .. ‘you’re my mission’.  It was Schmitt, all this time….. ‘ cut one head…more will rise.’
The crowd outside the church was massive, so much so, that it made it easy for the man shrouded in a hooded sweatshirt and ball cap to slip throughand get a good look at the new couple as they emerged.
The doctor nodded smoothing down the papers on her clipboard. “Did your Alpha use any contraception?
“We let them steal this 'virus' and then we take it from them. Yeah doesn't sound hazardous at all.” he had said a couple of days into the op while sweating his ass off in the less than well ventilated panel van. Evidently, the old econo-class had been 'less conspicuous' than a big black surveillance van decked out in a false business logo.
Fuck you : Loki
Tony was having the bots cut replacement plates for Vengeance, the suit had taken a beating in his last little ‘trip.’ It was worth it though, he came by a particular piece of Intel and  now things were falling into place. “I don’t like being lied to.”
Oh great and there's Steve looking beautiful, skin still flushed from heat. “Shower first, ok? We...we might need to leave.” Tony said, trying not to betray any worry in his voice.
Power, perfection, strength - these were the qualities of a worthy mate. Qualities of a prince of Asgard; the kingdom of the sea; home of the sirens.
Tony chuckled and nibbled at the back of his omega’s shoulder, “So sassy even like this, how about I fuck all those smart remarks right out of you , Mmm shit, god yeah. You’d like that wouldn’t you. My filthy little omega, look at you taking my cock so pretty, you’re so wet and I love how you blush for me when I’m talking like this.”
“No…I’m telling them.”
This wasn't even exclusive to the omegas of Midgard, Loki had heard and seen some strange things on his travels of the nine realms. Exotic eel like creatures turned into candies confections, fruits of every color of the rainbow blended with the blood of small mammals, but this...this was disgusting.
He was not broken until he realized that a man he had looked up to since he was a child orchestrated all this. The man he called Uncle, Obie was just a power hungry man with a black evil heart.
Bucky would always push things, just as far as Steve would let him, pinning him down with a gentle grasp on the omegas slim wrists. Kissing his neck and whispering sweet promises.
Tony groaned and felt his eyes roll back in pleaser. A string of unintelligible sounds spilled over his lips as Steve held his hips and pounded into him. Barely able to utter the phrase “harder” and “more”, and Steve gave it to him. He was going to be bruised, but it was worth every moment of the mind numbing pleaser that spread over his nerves like a blanket. He came untouched and whining as Steve just kept going, abusing his over sensitive ass as the solider chased his own release.
The terrorist snarled as long black claws split his glowing fingertips. “It ends with me killing the future.” Mallen had come to far for this and just because Stark had somehow gotten hold of the very same edge that he had didn't mean a thing. Stark was just another one of the governments lap dogs in his eyes. Another industry fat cat out playing hero, he could never understand what it was like for the underdog. Never see that this world was nothing but a cesspool waiting to be drained. There was no going back now, it was all scorched earth or nothing.
Harder now, the King pounded into him, his thrusts losing some of their rhythm in favor of quick snaps of his hips.  Steve felt the King’s hands under him, lifting, spreading, and suddenly, the angle was different, pleasure exploding inside him on each thrust.
But it was just the suit.
He cleared his throat and shot an annoyed glare at Tony before continuing. “So, as I was saying, I hope you will all be able to offer some assistance to the Captain.   And no, Stark, quit bouncing in your seat.  I’m not going to “go over the rules for being around Steve” with the Avengers, and no, “Stay away from him, that means you, Barton,” is not rule number one.  And I’m pretty sure rule number four is illegal.”
“Like a million bucks?” Steve cut in, then immediately felt like an utter ass.
“I—yes,” Steve began, a pang of sadness knocking in the back of his throat.  Regret tasted about as good as this food, Steve thought.  But, the boy was eating and distracted, and that might be the only things Steve could offer him this day.  “I did have a sword.  And a horse.  And armor.  I fought in many battles.  And I had a shield.  Round,” Steve continued, holding out his arm in front of him.  “About this big,” he explained, drawing a large circle in the air.  “Made of a special metal, unlike any other.  A long time ago, where I’m from, a star that fell to earth.  It burned nearly all the way up as it fell, leaving a long, white tail across the sky, and when it landed, it cracked open and all that remained of the star was inside.  It was a metal unlike anything anyone had seen before.  The villagers who found it brought the metal to the king—we had a king, then, though he was the last who called himself that—anyway, the king said it was to be made into a shield, because that was what a leader was for his people.  A shield. But, the smith who was tasked with working the metal, he couldn’t get the metal to do anything, even though he was the best in all the land.”
“It’s good to see you, Tony,” Steve finished with a stiff sort of formality, like they were strangers.  Wasn’t that what Jarvis said?  A stranger, who stopped by to make sure Tony was fed and had plenty of toys to play with?  Maybe that’s what they were.  More so than what Tony wanted to admit, anyway.
Steve stared down at Tony for a beat, then leaned his head down and kissed him. Lightly.  Softly. With just the barest touch of his lips.  He felt Tony sigh against his mouth, then join the kiss, hardening his mouth against Steve’s with a surge of almost desperation, until he pulled away slightly, giving Steve a narrow look.
The walk to the bed seemed far too long, the floor shifting and listing as if on the deck of a ship, but he made it and climbed onto the huge bed.  Positioning himself in the center, he leaned forward and braced himself on his hands and knees.  A small gasp escaped him as he settled.  The heavy pendant dangling on the chain between his nipples tugged downward, stretching them, the deep, throbbing ache seeming to leap forward into a stinging pain all at once.
, the creature shaved, and meticulously at that.  Why not, Steve thought with a grin as he stroked his own beard.  He should shave, too, he supposed.
“Can’t say I have, why?” Rhodey responded.
“Stop ah-ing.  It’s making me nervous,” Tony protested in a jittery voice.  “It was stupid.  I don’t know why I did that in the first place.  It was my birthday.  He took me to Caltech.  Caltech, Jarvis! I was excited, and got carried away.  I don’t know what I was thinking. I…it was stupid, okay?” Tony said, tossing his hands up in the air, before shoving them across his chest and tucking his hands under his arms.
, he thought, grimacing as he pulled open the door and stepped out into the too-bright hallway.
“You do?” Steve said after a beat of silence.  “Happy will take you anywhere you want to go.  You know that, right?  That’s why he’s here.”
“Because they don’t have slaves,” Cam said.
“So…” Tony repeated as he chewed.
They made their way through some kind of network of stairs and tunnels and small doors that Zola opened with a key he produced from under his robes and Steve had to duck his head to avoid hitting his head on.  The final door opened to a long corridor, brightly lit with torches and candle-filled chandeliers and lined with huge tapestries, paintings and banners.  Suits of armor stood sentinel and rows of swords and shields, blunted by age, hung in spirals of metal.  Steve’s feet sank into a plush, red rug, so deep and soft, it was like walking on new grass.  He followed Zola towards the double doors at the end of the hall.  It was only when they stopped in front of them that Steve looked up and saw the crest above the doors.
Steve acknowledged the overture with a curt nod, though he knew he would not ask this man for anything.
“Might be the safest thing to do with it,” Steve said quietly.  He was staring at the screen, an odd sort of detachment in his voice that made the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck stand on end.
A cold rush of air hit him without warning, and suddenly, the panties were jerked down to his thighs.  He felt Steve’s finger slide in easily.  Then another.  And—oh, fuck—Steve still had his gloves on.  Tony could feel the smooth burn of the leather as Steve pushed his fingers all the way in.   Tony let out a grunt, then moaned as Steve pulled his fingers out.  He was empty and open and dripping.  Like the Omegas in the pictures, Tony thought, feeling somehow lifted up by the idea.  Pleased. Floating.  For you, Tony thought.  Only for you.
God, he hadn’t had that thought in years.
“On your feet, whore,” one of the guards snapped impatiently as he rode up next to where Steve sat in the dirt.  “Not so uppity now, huh?  On your feet or that pretty face of yours’ll look like last week’s ground meat, you here?”  Steve spat out a wad of dirt and looked up at the guard.  “You think he won’t?  Huh.  Try it.  I don’t care how much you cost, you think he wants the likes of them,” the guard said, jerking his head towards the other slaves in the back of the wagon with their round, hollow eyes, “Getting ideas in their heads about hitting their masters?  Spreading rumors like that?”
“Steve…” Tony began, voice tender and strangely pleased sounding.
If he could see Tony, then he could put this back where it belonged in the back of his mind, at least until next Sunday.  He didn’t have Tony’s number, of course, since all that went through the agency anyway.  He took out the phone he’d gotten and flipped it open. There were four contacts in it, Bucky, Clint, the facility he’d just left and the agency.  He hit the last button and waited.  It wasn’t long before Ms. Romanov’s voice sounded on the other end of the line.
He wasn’t sure if Tony liked jewelry, though.  Steve hadn’t noticed Tony wearing any.  Well, except the dog tags.  Tony had been wearing those at breakfast, Steve remembered with a warm flush creeping up his throat.  He had noticed that right off.  But, most jewelry would probably get in the way if you were building robots, Steve supposed.
“My, well,” Dr. Barker chuckled.  “I wish my Omega would let me talk about adaptive armor!  Last night, I had to listen to twenty minutes of what was wrong with his mother’s feet,” he said with a low laugh that trickled through the pack of Alphas laying wreaths at Steve’s feet and imagining naming their firstborn Steve.
“No,” Steve amended, his mouth flattening around the word.  The King’s eyes lit up and he threw back his head and laughed, slapping a hand on his thigh.
JARVIS had the water running, nice and hot, and Tony held onto Steve as they climbed in, partly because he needed something to help balance so he didn’t face plant into the tub and partly because he couldn’t let Steve go because, you know, something could happen, what the fuck ever.  He did get to wash Steve’s feet, and the rest of him, so there was that.  He took his time, as Steve seemed content to allow his ministrations for as long as he wanted.  He’d wash a spot, then follow with his mouth, gently kissing and licking his way around Steve’s body with an almost ritualistic delicacy.
“Oh God, Steve, fuck, I’m---fuck, please, please let me touch you, please, I need—
Armor.
“But, I found that I am…unable to well abide in a world where someone who hurt you exists.  Not when it is within my power to see that such a situation ceases to be,” Tony said, voice low and tight.
He brushed his hands over the front of the robe where beads and seed pearls gleamed in the light of the oil lamps hanging from the top of the tent. Cam had outdone himself with the night’s finery, Steve thought, though, of course, it was likely Cam’s mother who actually created the garment. Still, he knew the boy took something of a dictatorial oversight into his wardrobe, Steve recalled with a smile, and tonight’s outfit was truly quite the spectacle. Not that he was unused to wearing something to stand out, he reminded himself with a deprecating twist of his mouth as he thought about his old uniform. In its own way, his old uniform served a purpose, just as these garments did.
“I heard,” Fury replied, sounding vaguely uncomfortable, though, to be fair, that could be because 26 was tracking his movements rather intensely. “Fine. Well, I guess that’s my signal to go.”
“No, no, its good. Great. Whatever,” Tony bit out, then let out a sigh. “You've got to go. Hand doctor, and all that. Good luck with that, by the way,” Tony said, more waspishly than he meant to, but he couldn't seem to stop himself. There was picking at a scab and then there was a good, old-fashioned drawing and quartering of a scab, and he'd never done things in half-measures. “Just go. You're right. This was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking. Thanks for the papers. My people will, you know, call your people. Person. Can he find his phone? Anyway. They'll handle it from here.”
“That’s part of what I was thinking,” Steve answered honestly.  He took a sip of the champagne.  It was bright and sweet and delicious, and made him think of the small, pink bottle he’d bought from the corner bodega last Valentine’s Day, along with some chocolates and one of those stupid teddy bears with a little stuffed heart in its hands.
“Is that your butler?” Steve asked, peering down at the tablet curiously. “Who forges documents for you?”
“Ah, Mr. Stank, mind if I use your facilities?” the elderly man, who lived on two, asked, drawing a smirk from Barnes.
“Kinda hard not to notice you, Tony,” Steve pointed out.
“Emo twat’s getting his ass handed to him by my girl Rey, I know that,” Jim smirked.
Steve said nothing, just stood there, ramrod straight.  He wasn’t afraid of Stane, but he wasn’t stupid enough not to be wary.  The man had nursed his depravity under Tony’s nose for decades and built quite the handsome empire for himself in the process, and Tony was too smart for Steve to dismiss that kind of subterfuge as a fluke.
Steve harrumphed a chagrined laugh and shot him an oddly warm look.   “Yeah, well.  Couldn’t sleep, and I know sometimes you don’t sleep, so I thought you might be here,” Steve replied.  “Thought…I don’t know what I thought.  Just thought you might be here.”
He’d told Pepper that closure would be good for him. Maybe he needed it more than he had realized or more than he had been willing to admit. Seeing Steve again...it had rattled him, that much was easy to parse, but the rest of it, the way he could draw the exact color of Steve's eyes to his mind, the way they got soft and crinkled at the corners when he really smiled, the current of feeling that still seemed to run between them, no matter how stretched thin it should be, how quickly the remembered burst of warmth could resurface when he thought about Steve bragging—yes, bragging, dammit—on Tony, everything was running circles through his head, and his subconscious was already busy happily offering every excuse it could.
“You and me, huh?” Steve said, a smile starting to form.
A week dragged by without hearing the ringtone even once.  That pit that had been slowly opening in Steve's belly grew and grew, until finally he was able to call it acceptance.
“A good man.  A cruel man. Kings can be both,” Kadina answered, waving a hand through the air and sending a spray of water arcing in front of her.  “I served him a few times,” she shrugged.  “He fucked like a king.  So proud of himself when I filled his ears with screams of pleasure,” she harrumphed.
There is a path through the mountains.
“Mr. Stark,” a deep voice echoed from the intercom. “Thank you for coming all the way down here.  You really didn’t have to do that,” Captain Rogers, said, stepping up to the window and nodding towards Tony.
. Easily detectable.  Oh.  Yes, God, yes, that, there, right there, he thought disjointedly, making some kind of a noise in the back of his throat.  Errors.
“Barely,” Steve muttered under his breath.
“You should eat.  Happy will be here soon with the car,” Steve reminded him, drawing Tony’s mind out of its reverie. They were going shopping.  Not Tony’s favorite pastime, but he could admit that Steve’s wardrobe needed something less Howdy Doody and more How You Doin’.
“Oh, good.  Right.  Sorry, Steve,” Clint said apologetically, tilting his head to the side.
It was the same plea, Steve realized, and the same answer waited to be given.
“A rune-keep,” Tony said, glancing behind him at the spot where Steve had slowed.  “To bind the spirits to a certain place. As Bruce said, the old ways are still followed by some, at least up here, you’ll find,” Tony explained. Steve looked back at the stack of stones and frowned, though held his tongue.  He did notice several soldiers gripping the hilts of their swords, though. “Nothing to it, of course, but at least that means we are heading the right way.”
He was oddly unsettled by the whole conversation, though, looking back, he didn’t think he’d flubbed it too much.  If he was this bad with a stranger, he was really going to have to work at it to sell anything remotely like a lie to Bucky, though, which was something he’d been putting off dealing with and couldn’t really let it hang out there any longer or Buck was liable to do something stupid like demand that Steve have an actual conversation with him.
“Steve! Just wait a second!”
Sensing that Tony wasn’t going to be up for talking any time soon, he quietly cleaned up and then made his way over to the gym to vent out some of his frustrations. There he stayed for about an hour, punching away at the bag and running through combinations that had been drilled into him years ago, just to feel something familiar, sense the pull of muscle under his skin.
Great way to start the day.
Steve just nodded. “I am, aren’t I,” he said sagely, and then kissed Tony’s forehead as the other man huffed, “now sit still and go to sleep.”
“You good?” He asked.
These days, the Avengers weren’t called out to fight as often as they’d used to- there were more superhumans there to deal with the lower level stuff, and Avengers were usually an Emergency-Only call. Of course, that didn’t mean that their days were any less busy, of course. For some reason, the list of things to do never quite seemed to cease, and so Steve took special pleasure in finally closing the last file or throwing the last punch before he allowed himself to go and finally take a break back in the communal rooms. There’d usually be some sort of food lying around- the team ate at different times except for Sunday Dinner which they did as a unit, and so Steve, being one of the later workers, was usually left to pick at the remains. He didn’t really mind. That was the way he’d grown up, and Bruce sure knew how to knock up a good curry anyway.
He shut his mouth after that, unwilling to say more. Nothing else was left to be said, anyway. He knew what he’d done. Tony knew what he’d done. And no words could make that go away. It had been a breach of trust on the most intimate of levels. Steve had used him like he meant nothing; a means to an end. In truth, Tony was so, so far from that. But Tony had no reason to believe any of Steve’s truths anymore.
In that moment, Steve felt strangely powerful. He didn’t doubt that Tony would do anything if it meant Steve just listened to him.
Tony pulled away before he could even voice any of that, eyes still shut and breathing heavy as he knocked his forehead against Steve’s temple. “Gonna drive me mad,” he muttered with a fond shake of his head.
“That would just be
“… Really s-“
“Stoppit,” Tony mumbled into his chest, his hands rising to stroke messily down Steve’s arms, “m’fine.”
Steve nodded, watching the ship of the door open with a hiss. He was still running, leaving the rest of the team behind in the dirt as he used every ounce of speed he had to get to Tony. The man was stumbling out of the ship, accompanied by a woman made of metal and blue skin, and Steve barely even acknowledged it. Tony’s name fell from his lips, loud enough that Tony heard it and looked up.
“It’s boring,” he declared, “try something else, Steve, anything. If you order that carbonara again you’re going to break my heart.”
Steve blushed. “I… I’ve got wait for the bus either way, so i figured- I figured I might as well put my time to good use,” he mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck.
He’d always been told he was his own worst enemy.
“Bout three hours,” Natasha told them, her expression fond as she took them all in, “everyone else got bored of Peppa Pig, but Steve was sat on the remote and JARVIS had been ordered not to change the channel.”
“Will you, Anthony Edward,” Steve declared, sitting up as straight as he could and then looking Tony in the eye, “do me the honour of marrying me? I would love to love you forever. We’d be the best husbands ever. I think you should say yes.”
The coffee was 90% whiskey, but that was how Tony liked it.
“Buck, it’s me,” Steve started, and a second later he heard a massive sigh of relief and a muttered curse as Bucky yelled, obviously to the rest of the group, “it’s Steve! Guys, he’s okay! Clint, call Nat and Sam and tell them to stop looking!”
“Fourth,” Clint corrected her through a mouthful of food and then turned to both Tony and Thor, “why does it mean you two have to hide though?”
Steve checked for noises out in the corridor for a few minutes, and then, when he was certain there was nothing, he crawled back out from under the bed. His nose was itching terribly, and he knew that he would not be able to stop the sneeze that came a few seconds later. He tried to contain it as much as possible, but the dust didn’t help at all, and he ended up spraying blood all over Tony’s floor. To say it hurt was an understatement- in fact, the pain was so intense for a moment that his vision whited out, and he sagged against the bed as tears sprung to his eyes. Nose injuries always made his eyes water like a bitch.
Someone like Tony- someone with that much potential, with that much… inherent goodness in him- he didn’t belong in the life he’d chosen for himself. Jesus, he could have gotten into college already if he put his mind to it, Steve bet. With the ability to create robots like he had, Steve didn’t doubt it even for a moment.
fight, any more.”
“Come on,” he said with a laugh, watching as Tony attempted to reboot himself and follow along, “we’ve- well, actually I guess we
“We can’t—”
Steve made a face, but Sam started tugging at his elbow gently, pulling him back in the direction of the living room. “Just let him do his thing, man,” he whispered, “he wants to make this right. At least let him try.”
“You just said it, Richards,” Steve glared at him, his hand curling into a fist on the table, pulling at the fresh scabs over where the porcelain had cut him earlier. He felt his blood as it began to wet his skin once more.
Tony chose to ignore that, instead sitting apprehensively on the arm of the couch. He didn't intend to stay here long. But Peter turned to him when he heard the voice, his face breaking out into a toothless smile as he clapped his podgy hands together uncoordinatedly. He held out his arms.
“Did I break them?” Steve choked, delicate finger tracing the outline of Tony’s ribs, a feather-light caress, before seemingly coming back to himself and snapping it away in horror.
“You do realise that we can’t just keep him here, right?” Natasha asked, leaning forward, “we don’t have another choice. Social services are trained to deal with this-“
Steve just followed the order, letting his head fall between his knees as he did so. He heard the thumps of Thor’s feet fade away after a few moments, and once more the panic surged right back again- Thor was the only kind person he’d met that night, he didn’t want him to go, then he’d be all on his own again-
Sighing heavily, he leaned forward and grabbed the bottle of whiskey Tony had set out on the coffee table, pouring another round for the two of them. They were quiet for a moment, both watching the amber liquid slosh in their glasses.
that the idea of permanence, the concept of maybe actually doing this with Steve, together, was… it was there. It was attainable.
“Don’t worry, I have access to the car’s locking mechanism,” JARVIS assured him, and a moment later Steve heard the faint click as the doors of the car unlocked.
His hand cracked the ceramic, and he looked at, kept clenching until the cracks splintered, turned to shards into his hands. It pierced his skin. He wished he could feel it, but it was a nothingness in comparison to the agony that was going on under his chest. Someone was ripping out his fucking spine. Someone had stuck a hand through his ribs, rummaged around until it had found his heart and then just crushed it.
Steve just looked down at him with a heavy swallow. Nothing was going to happen. He hadn’t been used. Tony had gotten to him in time.
Tony just laughed and gave a lazy salute, before kicking off the brake and pulling out into the road again. From over Bucky’s shoulder, Steve blew him a quick kiss and then yelped when Bucky gave him a sulky shove in the chest. “Feeling a little sense of déjà vu are we, Bucky?” He asked innocently.
“That was exhausting and terrifying and you’re not allowed to leave me alone with him ever again,” Steve muttered, letting his eyes close and head rest against Tony’s shoulder as the man walked forward to pull him into his arms.
“I cannot get a response out of that number either.”
Steve slotted himself in the path to Tony and glared at his idiot of a best friend in fury. Behind him, he could hear Tony’s footsteps slow down too, until they reached a complete standstill less than a meter from Steve.
The flight was only half an hour, but the wait was excruciatingly long. Every second felt stretched into a sperate hour of its own, with Tony spinning a dozen scenarios in his head throughout the whole journey, none of them good. He knew he had to keep his head on straight, knew that letting his emotions get the better of him was not something he could afford to do, but it was fucking hard. God,
The doors Steve pushed his way through were heavy-set steel, programmed to lockdown at the flick of a switch if necessary. This was where the interrogation rooms and holding cells were. This was the place that SHIELD kept their criminals until they could be moved elsewhere—either a government run prison or somewhere like the Raft, if they were a high threat. Steve figured that was where Tony was headed. Until then, however, he was going to be somewhere around here, in a room on this floor. Brock Rumlow had been put in charge of transferring him from the Jet to the basement level, and so Steve figured he would also be in charge of any interrogations that’d be going down. It made something painful twist up under his ribcage. Rumlow was an asshole with a sadistic streak SHIELD barely managed to keep in check. Steve figured SHIELD might not even bother moderating him at all when it came to Iron Man, though. Anything to get the information they needed.
“-No,” Steve told him firmly, his hand beginning to wipe very gently across Tony’s hair, sweeping up the moisture, “I’m not leaving unless you’re absolutely sure that you’ll be okay and you don’t actively want me to be here, alright? Until then, I’m going to sit here and clean you up, and I’m going to make sure you’re safe.”
Steve kissed his temple, before his own head drifted upward. “Definitely. I never thought I’d be able to see something like this here, in New York.”
When the stab in the back of the neck came, he almost felt prepared.
. I love that ass. I love
Instantly, a small part of Steve began to freak out. “What?” He asked, sitting up straighter. “Tony, what is it? Are you okay?”
The kid nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah- look, let me make it up. There’s a party at my friend’s tonight- a tonne of people are going. You should come. Starts at eight, down by The Revel, you know it? Anyway- invitation’s there. Just…” he bit his lip and looked around once more, before starting to back off again, “tell Tony we’re cool, yeah?”
“Steve, you didn’t see yourself six months ago,” Peggy murmured softly, and when Steve looked over to her again, her eyes were full of sadness, “you were off the rails and you know it. We had to watch you just….fall apart, right in front of us. It was
And that was when he knew it was over.
“Oh, Steve,” Rhodey breathed out his name in the end, and it sounded like a sigh, “I… fuck, okay, long story short- yeah, Bucky, I think you’re right. I never asked him and he’s never said, but I think… I get the same thing, sometimes. Not as bad as what happened here, but sometimes we’re just chilling and then… specific things can set him off. Give him weird sorta-not-really-panic-attacks. Usually the sound of Howard’s car engine, or his shoes on the floor. Sometimes it can be phrases. But he’ll go from relaxed to completely alert in a split second, and suddenly he’ll be telling me I gotta go, or that
Tony laughed, settling a hand into Steve’s hair. “Can’t,” he said through a weary sigh, “got a meeting in an hour.”
“That’s what we think they’re trying to do. But Barnes got the location out of him, and apparently it’s Siberia again. Different mountain range though, so you won’t be familiar with it.” Fury took a break, his voice grave. “We need you in, Cap. Sort this shit out before it gets out of hand again. Right now, the program seems to still be in its infancy. We can stamp it out now and stop it for good this time.”
“Just let me stop off at my desk, and I need to grab some makeup to cover these up.”
Steve almost laughed, before the sensation died in his throat slightly. “Do you have to do this… often?”
“I’m sorry,” and Steve blinked, realizing that it had been a while since either of them had spoken, “I’m sorry the world was so unkind to you, Steve. You… you never deserved that. Not… not you, you never…”
The kitchen was quiet as he waited for them with his cup of coffee, but it only took five minutes for them to come and fill the gap that they’d left an hour ago. They trudged back in, limping slightly but with wide, adrenaline-fuelled smiles on all of their faces as they laughed together. Tony watched them and smiled, ignoring the way his throat tightened at the sight of them. Didn’t seem like they’d missed him much.
“Sure, buddy,” Steve was still laughing, but he turned to look at his best friend and felt a stupid amount of fondness for the fool.
“Is this an Avengers mission?” Tony said, meaning
Steve swallowed, and turned his eyes back to the ceiling. He would not be sleeping much tonight
Bouncing up and down on his toes, Tony grinned at him, leaning into his chest and kissing him quick while copping a feel, of course, because when Steve was naked Tony was not just going to
Steve was bare-chested, but the pants of his uniform were still on. Dark red pretty much covered him; blood dripped off his hands, soaked through his hair, splattered over his back. Steve showed no signs of physical injury, so Tony assumed that it wasn’t his own.
Tony smiled, kissing Steve’s chest as he did so. “Have you just been lying there watching me this whole time? Pervert,”
It meant that he could curl up in Tony’s arms at 11 in the morning, lying on his bed and drifting in and out of consciousness with not even the slightest amount of worry that he was screwing something up.
. If they don’t think that you’re doing well here, they could relocate you. And you’ve been in five fights already.”
Oh, God. Please. Please, no. Anything but that.
Well, Tony couldn't argue with that. "You fed him?" He asked, just in case. Clint turned to him and shot him a dry look.
Across the room, there were various murmurs of ‘actually that’d be kinda hot’ and ‘no we don’t care’- which didn’t really help Tony’s point much. He sighed, bringing Steve’s wrists to his mouth and kissing them gently before shaking his head. “Still a no,” he said with a small smile, trying not to burst into laughter when Steve pouted and groaned sadly. However, a second later it seemed as if the other man developed a better idea, because his eyes sparked like fireworks and he suddenly beamed.
He’d just heard her saying she loved him. He’d never even got that as she’d died, he’d never got to say goodbye, but then here she was, doing it in her in her own special way anyway, fuck, fuck, he didn’t-
Tony clenched his jaw. “He won’t hurt me. Only reason he went for Clint in the first place was because he was trying to defend my fucking virtue, or something. I’ll be fine.”
Steve bristled, resisting the urge to tell him that it wasn’t any of his fucking business. He thought back to the end of everything; Tony’s tired face, the defeated slump of his shoulders when Steve had told him he couldn’t do this anymore, that he was sorry, that it was all too much. They’d been fighting for weeks by that point, Tony working more hours to keep away, Steve going out for days at a time, staying in bars for hours on end and trying to drink until he forgot everything that was plaguing him. Steve privately thought that if they’d kept going any longer, it may well have killed one of them. It really said something about how terrible Steve must have fucking been though, for Tony to not even try fighting it, or argue with him about his decision. Usually, Tony never, ever gave up. Not on anything or anyone. Even if it hurt him.
“Alive,” Bruce gasped, steadying him with two hands on his chest before Steve could go any further, “but in a bad way. Be gentle.”
. So adamant.
Almost instantly the rest of the group, which previously had been looking for all intents and purposes as if they were minding their own business, suddenly broke out into roars and cheers, and Tony rolled his eyes fondly and smiled against Steve’s mouth as they kissed one another, slow and relieving, like a deep breath of crisp air. It was chaste, and they pulled away a few seconds later, but Steve remained close and they both laughed when they caught each other’s eyes, and their foreheads bumped as they chuckled. Clint said something crass across the table, then yelped in pain when Natasha undoubtedly punched him in the balls with the arm that wasn’t broken. A second later, and Thor asked if they were allowed to eat yet or whether they were going to have to wait for Steve and Tony to finish their moment. Bruce told him to be quiet and put something on his plate that wasn’t just a mountain of turkey.
2016.
Bucky nodded, and Steve looked less than pleased by the outcome, but didn’t speak out. “Me and Buck will cover you. There aren’t that many left anyway- it should be fairly easy.”
The man closed the door with a gentle snick, leaving Tony and Steve in the living room. Steve was already in his pyjamas- it was already 11pm by that point in the night, and Steve was tired. Unfortunately, it seemed he was actually going to have to do as Paul said and get to bed soon.
Evidence of Steve’s failure. Just once, perhaps- but once was enough. Once was far, far too many.
By the time he and Steve had gotten down to the communal kitchen, Natasha and Thor were already there, and Bruce was trailing in with a yawn a pair of squinty eyes. “What’s the problem?” The man asked croakily, “and can’t it wait a few hours? The sun’s hardly even up yet.”
“Gym,” Natasha said, as Clint followed on with, “all day.”
sang- when he did, it was usually just humming old war songs or those abominable pop tunes that played nonstop on the radio. This- this was different. It sounded... ethereal, almost. Like it had been around since the beginning of time.
“Tony, what the hell is—” Steve obviously came to the same conclusion right at that moment, because suddenly his breath caught and his eyes widened. Tony felt the pressure on his arm increase a hundred-fold, the armor creaking as Steve’s grip tightened. Tony wasn’t looking at him, but he didn’t need to in order to know that all the blood had drained from his face at once, turning him gaunt, pale, terrified. “No,” he said simply, copying Tony’s sentiment with a disbelieving voice. “Oh God. No.”
Tony spent another two days after that awake, building and building and building anything that the team could possibly find useful.
Steve didn’t know what to say, unable to find anything that could even hope to help. He just sat there uselessly, while Tony shook his head and then rolled onto his back, staring up at the ceiling with a numb expression on his face. Steve watched the other boy’s eyes well up, tears starting to spill over and slip down his ruined cheeks as he became less focused on the pain and more aware of everything else.
‘I love you, Tony,” Steve says, because the goddamn idiot
Steve leaned back against the headboard as his friends shuffled closer, eyes wide and curious. “He was…” Steve waved a hand, looking up to the ceiling and desperately trying to keep his cheeks from getting hot, “he was everything I’d thought he would be.”
feeling. Past tense. Because… because in trying to get him back, in coming down here with you, I found what I was looking for. I found a friend. Someone who understood me, and could help me with my pain. Tony, I found a home here.” He looked up at the ceiling, looked over to DUM-E as the bot tried (and failed) to sweep the floor. “I found you, and the team, and I learned all about the future and it became less terrifying and more… reality. It took a while to come to terms with it. But you helped me so much, Tony, and I don’t know how to thank you for that.”
However, they performed the routine with brutal efficiency and, in Tony’s opinion, some quite spectacular panache. Although that may have just been him experimenting with some flips along the way, and a bit of showy lightning from Thor. The rest of the team just boringly got on with it, and no matter how many times he asked Steve to rip his uniform off in masculine triumph at the end of a successful exercise, the man never did. A shame, really.
“What do you mean?” Steve frowned at the look Tony gave him and sat up a fraction, using his good arm this time.
God, that was tempting. Unfortunately, he had the feeling that if he got comfortable in the tub with Steve, he’d never end up leaving. It was hard enough to just sit here and
He’d made a hell of a lot of mistakes in his life. Both of them had. But with half the universe gone and a world steeped in despair, all either of them could do now was try find happiness. Somewhere. Anywhere they fucking could.
He frowned, stepping forward warily. He couldn't hear what they were saying aside from vague murmurs, but he saw the boy nodding slightly frantically and Tony holding onto his skinny little forearm as he spoke. He bent down just a touch, eyes looking at the boy's face for a moment before nodding, obviously satisfied with whatever he saw. His hand rose and ruffled his hair. "Okay, get lost, kid-and you walk your ass home this evening, alright? Don't worry about him."
. They’d known eachother…. so long, and Steve had always…. and it had been- it had… all this time?
Monster.
“But we
Tony grinned, “possessive streak, have we, Rogers?”
Tony had nodded once, curt. He’d been trying, ever since being pulled out of that hellhole, to remember what his suit even looked like. But he couldn’t. Not unless it was shown to him in a picture, in which case it just gave him an immediate migraine and then slipped straight out of his memory as soon as his eyes had left it. If Tony hadn’t been so distraught about that, he would have commended the scientists responsible. He’d never heard of something like that being done before.
“We’re not going to Sam’s house,” Tony interrupted, “we’re going to the hospital.”
Tony’s fingers found his jaw, and they gently turned Steve’s face back to him. “Hey. Look at me,” he whispered, “please.”
Tony said, voice angry,
He sighed, shutting his eyes.
you, I said, ‘Steve, baby, this won’t go well’, and did you listen?” He waved to the onions. “No. And now it’s all ruined.”
In the recesses of his mind, he knew that the entire planet was in mourning right now. Their favorite hero was dead. People were calling for Elliot Redford to be executed. They were making pop-up shrines in the streets, coming out in their masses, and absolutely fucking none of it mattered to Steve. He hadn’t turned a single electronic device on since they’d pulled Tony’s corpse from his arms. It didn’t matter what the rest of the world was feeling- they weren’t the ones going home with the knowledge that the love of their life had been murdered on the street twenty feet from where they’d been stood, watching the whole thing go down.
“FRIDAY,” Rhodey snapped, lurching forward jerkily and resting his hands at each side of the helmet on the table while everyone crowded around, “FRIDAY, what does—is this—”
Then it was Thor’s turn to splutter. “He’s not staying with me again. I love him, but not that much.”
Weird thing to think when your friends were preparing to give you a third degree burn, but then again, Tony could blame it on the hysteria. He wanted Steve, because Steve would probably do something comforting, like smile at him or tell him it would all be okay. Steve was good at stuff like that.  It was one of the reasons Tony was so crazy about him. Steve always helped, no matter the situation—even if the situation was a hole in your leg and the prospect of imminent agony and subsequent sepsis.
“Hey, Rogers?” And the voice was nearer now, right in his ear, and Steve jumped away sharply, looking up to where Ty was leaning forward a little, speaking smugly into Steve’s ear, “a word of advice. Stay out of what doesn’t involve you, yeah?”
Then he passed out.
With a fond sigh and a soft thumb which rubbed over the graphite, he looked up, and jumped upon seeing the man himself, leaning against the window and looking right at him. He was panting; hair stuck to his forehead and body glistening with sweat as he grinned over.
Quickly, he capped the lid back onto the pen, then shoved them away thoughtlessly. “That’s better,” he said, smiling up at Steve.
God, he sounded pathetic.
By the time the morning came around, Steve and Tony had had about three hours of sleep. When he closed his eyes he could hear Peter wailing. Didn't help that Steve had refused to even hold him once, and so Tony had been nearest to the racket the whole damned time.
The days at school seemed to pass by with remarkable speed, and before Steve knew it, November had swung around, littering Steve’s day with sharp breezes and generally shitty weather. He didn’t particularly mind about it- he’d always loved the rain, and baggy sweaters were exactly his kind of style. It also inspired him into drawing more; he was never sure what exactly brought about that change when the colder months came along, but this year he was going to take advantage of it. Tony’s proposal- the one Steve should really have disregarded months ago- still hung somewhere in the back of his mind, and he thought of it occasionally. Entering into a competition like that would be about as useful as throwing a piece of art into a literal void and just hoping someone caught it- but no matter how many self-deprecating thoughts Steve had on the matter, there was always a niggling
“I know you
, apparently- but that was for another time. For now, there was one thing he wanted to do and one thing only. And he wasn’t scared of it, not any more. Whether or not Tony felt the same…
Tony kissed him, just as he was asked. Soft and tender and nervous and grateful, all at once. His nose fit just right against Steve’s, soft enough that it didn’t hurt the bruising. His hair brushed across Steve’s forehead in ticklish wisps.
He reeled back from her in terror. “No,” he whispered, “No, please-”
Steve didn’t come and tell him off for staying up too long. In fact, Tony didn’t see him for the entire time that he was down in the shop. Which was weird- usually Steve never left his side after accidents. Tony had just… assumed it would be the same for this one.
angry at you, for such a long time.”
Not the SHIELD Steve knew, anyway.
He’d never thought of Steve as invincible.
“I’m fine,” he said shortly, running a hand over his face and blinking a few times in an attempt to wake himself up, “I’ll see you later, okay?”
, do you even know what you do to me-“
Bucky sat back, lacing his fingers together and propping his feet on the bed. He looked so calm, so collected; but all Steve could see was the version of him that was seventy years younger, screaming in terror as he fell from the train-
“Thank you sweetheart, I love you too.”
His jaw clenched imperceptibly before Steve stood with all the military readiness he could muster. Tony reached out and touched his hand, silently asking if he wanted him to go along. Steve shook his head; he wanted to get this over with and with as few witnesses as possible. He hated doctors and this type of thing he had always loathed.
“Kinda hard to see the forest for the trees.” She said taking his hand in hers. “You are healing too, don't forget that. Sam says you've been making progress in the veterans meetings.”
See buddy I told you the little Hawkeye kitty outfit was a good idea.. hey what...don't tell me to be quiet. I feed you..
What May had to show him wasn't at all what Coulson and his team was expecting to find.
Nothing to see here, it's just chapter three in better homes and gardens.
"In the kitchen Peter."
“I would Sir; yet I feel Ms. Potts may be skeptical.”
Tony had lost his husband.
Tony’s quote is from boxer - Muhammad Ali
Loki took the box from her hands; she flicked her eyes down to the omega's hands. Nails perfectly glossed and trimmed, skin well tended and soft. Yet... there was a slight almost unperceptive tremble.
Loki stood shakily as spots of color rose in his gaunt cheeks. "I wish I had!"
Steve shook his head, “That’s what I’m trying to stop. Do you think Tony will stop with Hydra and AIM? He won’t, I can see it and I can tell it will never be enough. All this anger and pain will tear him apart and turn him into something so much worse and so much more dangerous. When that happens none of you will be able to stop him.”
The AI confirmed and Tony stood up rubbing his mildly pizza greased hands on his jeans. “I’ll get it and drop it off at your room, ya know in case you want to be... Alone. Well, good talk champ.” And with that, he was gone.
“No, no, for the playhouse” The archer reiterated… “We are actually fucked.”
The woman rolled her eyes, one was dark and black, the other milky white. “I know your father; tell that trickster that Hel sends her regards. Now, you boys follow me I will take you along the north side of the trench and from there you can surface and return to Asgard. By then the beast should have sought out another resting place. Let this be a lesson to you both.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Correct-o-mundo my metallic armed Buckaroo; she’s using this experiment to fuse human mater and electronic interface.”
The supped up weaponry was defiantly a game changer, however the size and ferocity of the levitation had thinned the Mers forces. The guards were few and far between and the cities more powerful magic users were coming to the front of the fight and giving it everything they had to hold the beast at bay while the surface strangers draw the beast back by striking its vulnerable points.
When they finally arrived, Cho took over. She had studies Loki’s unique biology - knowing the common drugs on earth would do nothing if the dosages where not tailored to the jotun. However, it became increasingly clear there would be no halting the labor.
“I’m just tired and hungry; I’ll stop some place on my way back from running.” He said to himself before continuing into the bathroom and filling a glass with water. Confident he’d feel better later, maybe he would even skip the run and just go get breakfast and bring it back to share with Tony. Hopefully the alpha had gotten to bed at a decent hour and would be awake.
The Winter Soldier stood, stepping over the prone omega and advanced. Tony wanted to kill him, he really did…raining a palm, the first shot hit the bicep of Barnes metal arm. The force enough to spin the solder of course as Iron man took a few steps into the small office and grabbed the brunette by the throat.
“Trust me cap if I had a lecture plan I would have opened with it and forced you to sit through it and tinkle in that fancy ashtray they give you.” Tony said gesturing to the forgotten bedpan on the nightstand.
“Steven Grant Rogers you sit down!” Pepper lost her temper. “You’re worse than Tones you know that! I am sick of it, both of you need to realize it’s not just your lives in your hands. Now you do as I say and sit your ass down soldier!”
Steve woke up to a lie, for the first few seconds he even thought that maybe he was dead. It would have made sense to be dead, after all he dropped that plane filled with bombs into the water … it was the last thing he remembered. In truth if he tried a little harder, he might remember more but that was something he didn’t want to touch now. More than likely not ever. Because if Steve closed his eyes and tired he might remember the feel of water flooding his mouth and burning in his lungs as it strangled the life out of him.
But hey, the grammar is nice and apparently that is way more important than someones mental health right?  At one point I seriously considered just deleting all of my works and walking away.  Because this felt like a chore or assignment and not sometime I was happy to do.
Amora swam through her dank sea cave, the pale fanged creatures that inhabited the space all departing from her wrath. “The golden son of Asgard thinks he can slight me, we shall see what he has left to rule with his precious Asgard is in ruins and his people are decimated.” Her hands crackle with dark magic. “I will take everything…I will consume everything…”
“Yeah..yeah...I won.” Tony felt his consciousness drifting in and out. Someone was shouting and they had stopped moving. Were they at the surface? Was his dad there?
“Ask Pepper.” she offered, snapping the clip back into the firearm.
“That's very sweet honey.” Steve said and placed a kiss on his sons head before taking a seat at the table.
“As well as could be expected, no explosions today.” Hank laughed straightening his lab coat. “Dr. Banner has agreed to come and give a guest lecture to the advanced chemistry class next week. The students are of course very excited.”
Steve sat alone just soaking up the silence for a while, he would need to get used to this. He was going to have to leave the tower and find a place of his own. Someplace far enough that he wouldn’t be tempted to see Tony again, or the media wouldn’t find out about the billionaires illegitimate child. Maybe he could go back to DC, find a new place and a day job. He could ask Sam, the alpha was nice enough.
Peter whined trying to tug his father’s shirt over his head and hide.  It was naptime and naps were the worst.
“I'm not sad, I am truly happy to have such a smart little helper.” the words were thin but the child let go. “Why don't you sit at the table and watch the timer for me?”
Looking around the room, everything seemed well enough. Clean and orderly, everything has its place and everything in it's place. More like a photo from a prominent decorator magazine. It was too nice, too...shiny.
Romanov schooled her features, “stop blood flow huh. Well your not wrong, carry on boys.” she said taking her leave, whispering something into her com link on the way.
This is what he'd been so worried about and it's crystal clear, Tony is gone. Whoever this is...isn't his Alpha. “I'm sorry. I’m sorry.” Steve is up and he's fleeing from the bedroom. Tony isn't even following him and that's different too; “I'm going to stay in the guest floor with the kids, when you're feeling like yourself again let us know. And for the record Mr. Stark, I loved the man I married. I loved everything about him even his flaws because that's what made him mine.”
Tony looks up and sees Barnes glaring at him. “Yeah well you don't look so hot yourself Robocop. Seriously, caught yourself in a mirror lately? Getting some creepy walking dead vibes. Don't make me start a ricktatorship over here.” He joked, his voice seemed to lack its usual easygoing edge though and the words fell flat and gloomy between them.
Musing over motivations could wait however; right now, they just need to make it out of this alive. With luck, they might even weed through this onslaught and get into the warehouse. The problem was they needed a game changer and fast.
“Fair enough, You are aware of your fathers involvement with the project that lead to the creation of the serum that, for all purpose took Steve Rogers from the ordinary unexceptional youth he was and turned him into the panicle of human existence”
No, Loki's hesitancy reminded him more of a child in an orphanage or one found in a war zone. What little he knew about Loki from gathered knowledge here and there, he supposed both of those things where in a way true – at least if the things trickled down through the grapevine where to be believed.
She was going to be queen.
Sometimes when you’re in the field things just sort of happen. One such thing that happened on this mission was the destruction of Hawkeye’s uniform.
“Maybe you oughta drop and gimme 20.” Steve pressed his hips forward; it felt so awkward walking in uniform when he was so hard. Thank god, no one had entered that hallway that would have been terribly embarrassing.
James smiled watching Loki read to their niece and nephew. The twins adored Loki and for so long the omega had shied away from interacting with them. It seemed since they applied with the adoption agencys that a peace had settled over them. He'd done a lot of thinking over what it means to finally be a father. Thinking of the relationship he never had with his own dad, the few and far between relationships he'd had with older men in his life.
“You better not Shell head...you better not.”
She first turned her attentions on Balder; the middle son was much like his elder brother in strength and stature. He appealed to her aesthetic and she found the thought of mating with him pleasing. Unfortunately, Balder had his eyes set on another. So much so, that even Amora in all her beauty failed to enchant the heart of the prince. He likewise had friends among the court that whispered in his ear to stay away from the troublesome siren.
Sorry i have been away for so long, life has been very difficult these past two months. Without going into unwanted detail i am..healing and finding my  way.  I apologize if this chapter was less than satisfactory. Please be gentle.
Tony shook his head and looked back to the abandoned phone on the pillow. Bruce had sounded so worried about Steve. “Yeah…ok.”
"mmm, y'r fault." He mumbled pulling the slighter man against him.
Eyes filled with fire narrow on him from across the room. This wasn't how he wanted her to find out, for a moment he thinks he's in the clear. Steve, for his part, looks away like a kicked dog and quickly exits the workshop.
Pepper shook her head, stepping forward to touch his shoulder tenderly, “very well Mr. Stark.”
“We did not!” Steve was now bright red and bending his poor fork in half.
'Look how normal I am now off you scamper little mortal.'
“Anthony I will not be late, now put it on…”
“Gluttons for punishment.” Steve laughed clapping his friend on the shoulder. “Take it easy Bucky. Come visit more often too, Peter misses you.”
In his heart of hearts this was the closest thing he had to going home to family. James has a vague memory of his elder sister coming back home once when she'd gotten into an argument with her Alpha. The way his mother and the other ladies in the tenement rallied around her and their house smelled of spices and warmth. Or the times when Steve was so sick and his mother had to work, how they would always welcome them into their tiny apartment. The way his mother would turn the living room into a nest with all the cushions, pillows and blankets they had before stoking the old oven to warm the place up. They would all curl up, his family and Steve. Somewhere in the shamble that now made up James' mind he had wanted that. He wanted to see Loki and his pups, Steve and his family, Natasha and her, hell even Barton and his little hellions – all together like that. There were nights when James could almost see it.
Seeing his omega standing there with his eyes wild, blood and oil on his hands and face, eyes half red and skin fading from blue to white. There was something too wild and unhinged about him. James isn't sure what to do with that and he can't stand himself for now hiding it better. The way Loki seemed when he left...so … broken.
Always...so then why wasn't that happening this time? Why did he feel like they were headed for a cliff at night with no lights or breaks?
The billionaires once perfectly shaped facial hair had now over grown leaving the man looking wild. Once perfectly chaotic hair filled with expensive product - now sported a buzz cut. Gone was the joking air and teasing turn of phrase, what was left behind was utilitarian efficiency. Fury got his new soldier, his very own asset. The question was if he still had the reigns in hand.
It was getting harder for Steve to sleep for many reasons.
The whole situation was completely fouled up. From the moment the soldier had woken up in custody Barnes had been combative with mere moments of lucidity, it was hard for Steve to watch.  Even harder for Tony to see the omega’s destroyed expression.
“Why papa, would you go alone from me?” Tony sniffled and wound his tiny fingers into his father’s long dark hair.
Bruce had come home from a meeting with Tony and found Loki inconsolable watching the Disney channel. There had been a movie marathon and after Bambi's dead mother, Elsa and her ice powers, and Belle and her Beast. Loki had too many complicated feelings and was now surrounded by tissues and empty tea cups.
It was that longing to protect his child that lead Howard father out to sea, the sailors map committed to memory as he watched the ships gauges and looked up to the stars to chart his pathway. There was a small chain of islands surrounded my jutting stones of lava rock. The dangerous pillions that could sink a vessel this size lay somewhere in the darkness. Intellectually, the inventor knew he should slow the engines of the craft but in the back of his mind, he thought only of what precious little time his son may have left.
“My what? You know what never mind, the point is this situation has just gone pear shaped. You have to come in.”
Smashing cameras and aside - settling into a routine with the alpha turned out to be not nearly as difficult as Steve thought it might be.
“I know.” Like smile and gripped the offered hand. They had discovered that finding a peaceful closed-in spot helped immensely when Loki felt overwhelmed. “Will you...”
As soon as Stark opened the door, he spotted Natasha leaning against the adjacent wall, her peridotite eyes falling on him in an unreadable expression. “Always one to make an entrance huh Stark.” She commented, gaze tracking the billionaire as he slipped in letting the exit door snap shut behind him.
On more than one occasion, Bruce observed Clint looking particularly twitchy around Steve. Barton what the only alpha in the tower with experience with pregnant omegas and it wasn’t hard to tell that the archer was trying hard to stamp down the need to help out in Stark's absence.
The omega turned his back and brushed away the traitorous tears. “Oh it's nothing dear heart, just something in my eye.”
Metal fingers snatched the now silent torch from the omega stashing the tool away amid livid protest. “I’m not hearing it grease monkey. I don’t make the rules I just follow them, now go before the punk has a coronary because you’re down here doing something decidedly not safe.”
And he was. He saw the soft smile on Tony's face in those images. Even behind those expensive shades he could imagine the light returning to the man's chocolate eyes. That's all he wanted for Tony in the end. Steve loved him enough to want that.
“Don’t… their not…” Steve blushed but all Tony’s talk was going was making him ache. He had a better way to shut Stark up. So he took himself in hand and plunge into the playboys already stretched hole.
She didn’t mean to shout but she wanted to shake him.
For now though it didn’t matter, right now he just wanted to wash off the dirt and stink from the fight. He paged the nurses to let them know, a kindly nurse showed up a few moments later to remove all the monitors and switch off the machines. She told him that he had a visitor outside who said they had some clothes for him to wear home. He thanked her and said he’d only be a moment.
Steve leaned back on the elevator walls, “Tony I’m not really in the mood. Not everyone thinks about that all the time. Can’t we just have a nice meal together with out one of us ending up on our knees.”
Steve opened his eyes when he heard the bright scream and Jemma saying that ‘baby A was out.’
Fucking Perfect (WinterIron)
Tony ignored her heading into the kitchen to take out a bottle of scotch, “Don’t you remember Pep, this is what I too I’m immature, I'm volatile, self-obsessed, and don't play well with others.”
Still, even as the years past Howard never relented on his story of mermaids and his stolen son. He never forgot the golden hair and cold eyes that promised in one breath and killed in the next. Even as time laced gray into his hair, Howard Stark never forgot and he never gave up.
“Then we deal, whatever it means we handle it. Look Steve, when I shared that heat with you I didn’t just do it cause I was bored. I dated pep for years and I never stayed with her during her heats to keep this sort of thing from happening. I have spent 30 years keeping paternity suits at bay to the point I almost had a vasectomy. For some reason I couldn’t say no to you. I knew the risk and I took it, in hindsight I shouldn’t be that surprised. Point is, I’m not going anywhere.”
His cheek was a little red now that I look at him closer.
Tony nodded, the fog finally starting to clear from his head. “Yeah, thanks guys but I’m not waiting.”
“God be with them then...” Steve sassed between bites.
Peggy knew it was bad when she walked into the foyer and found Howard’s Butler sweeping up a pile of broken glass. “Hello Edwin, how is he?” Part of her didn't really want to know. She'd seen Howard at his worst before Maria and she had solemnly hoped those days were behind him. Now ...with her. This had be inevitable.
Black suits, black shoes, black umbrellas, and a black casket. That is what funerals were supposed to look like. Yet somehow it was all Tony could fixate on, Steve didn’t wear much black. Come to think of it, Tony was sure all Steve had in the shadowy shade was that one nice suit and a black sweater Pepper purchased for him last Christmas.
“I would relayed your message Captain but …well Sir is…Sir and we both know he won‘t listen.”
“Sure did gorgeous. You should’ a seen me, working my hole in the shower before I came over here. Thinking about the last time, I did it to you. Remember how you begged me honey, how sweet you were when I sucked those pretty tits of yours.” Tony looked back at him. “I can’t wait to play with them some more Stevie.”
Steve had been out on his morning run when he first noticed it. He had worked up more of a sweat than usual, and just felt a little nauseous. This was odd because normally he could push him self much farther before feeling the ache and burn of fatigue. Steve chewed on his bottom lip as he walked out of the park hands at his hips trying to regulate his breathing.
“Loki...” Thor paused looking at the slender man before him. Even in the prison holds on Asgard- Loki had never seemed this frail. Even in madness Loki always held a look of defiance burning in his eyes. Yet now.. now it seemed that fire had burned away and left nothing but ash. “Please tell me, truthfully brother, how are you?”
Leaving the filthy roach motel all Stark could think about was, ‘it’s not enough, there are a million sorry sacks just like Beck, just like the men who killed Steve. There is Hydra, the remnants of AIM. It wasn’t enough this… Vigilante justice, Tony was a man who looked at the bigger picture. He couldn’t stop, wouldn’t stop until every last one of them was dead.
“What is he doing…?” Steve moved to the edge of his seat watching as Tony circled behind the creature darting precariously close as the inventor maneuvered between the lashing serpentine limbs. “He’s to close…Jarvis tell him to pull back.”
Soon everyone else began to notice the looming darkness and change in the water. The coronation continued, a bit of pitiable weather would not stop this grand event. Instead, the crowd joyously applauded as Thor and his new bride were presented to the court and Odin stepped down, the old king proudly placed the crown on his eldest son’s head.
Tony sat back in chair feeling slightly better knowing he had someone on this that wasn‘t wholly incompetent. (Not that he would ever compliment Barnes' intelligence. Can't have all that going to the old mans head after all, wouldn't want to get over excited and rust.) Scrubbing his hands over his face, Tony called out to his AI to dig into the SHIELD servers and pull out anything that had AIM tagged in the last year. It was always better to be over prepared than under prepared in situations like this. If that meant scanning, every tax return and Micky D's receipt then so be it. “Store that on my private server, I‘ll want some light reading in a few days.”
“Yeah, well um, I think I’ll head out for a while. I just didn’t want him to wake up alone; the doctors said he might be confused.” Wilson said picking up his jacket.
He should have known something was wrong when Pepper came into the lab with Bruce and Happy. Should have seen that "group solidarity, let's keep Tony from losing his shit." look in their eyes. Should have noticed how pale Bruce looked before the good doctor gathered up Peter and walked out before Pepper even started.
James came marching in with a stern look on his face that reminded Tony of how Howard would look when he managed to set fire to something while tinkering in the old storage house at the mansion upstate. A glare somewhere between anger and constipation, one Tony was all to glad to point out as a rambunctious adolescent.
Call instinct, call it desire…call it finally giving in to the one thing Tony Stark wanted since he was 12 years old looking up at those old war bond posters. The alpha moved  with swift purpose, taking Steve’s face in his hands. A brief look of questioning passed across those haunted blue eyes before Stark leaned in and captured the omegas lips.
So, still mad then.
Barnes tiled his chin up looking down at him like one might examine a bug under glass. “You told me to lick your boots. You about to have my foot up ya ass.”
“I don't think he would see it that way Loki. If pepper was having a problem, I would want her to come to me. If anyone in the tower has a problem we go to someone who can help, even if it's just to listen.”
Rejection is a bitter pill with numerous jagged little edges.
Tony could map every inch of that man just from memory alone. He could tell you Steve’s favorite spot to be kissed, and how sensitive the backs of his knees were. The little ticklish spot below his navel, Tony knew all of it.
Barnes ran to the side of the ship and lowered chains to draw the little capsule back up to the deck. “I hope you idiots had fun down there it's all I can do to scarcely keep this tub staying on the surface!” he shouted over the side as the small subs top opened and Natasha appeared.
Bucky cooed and knelt to kiss Steve’s lower back, “My sweet girl, your such a good honey you can’t say those nasty words can ya? Can’t tell me how bad you wanna be stretched out and filled up. Breed up for me. Hmm?”
Loki heard the car before he finally dragged himself out of bed to see who was outside. It had to be just a lost passerby, he had been careful about finding this place. It was dank and abandoned in the endless blocks of urban blight. No one would find him here and perhaps that's what made it so appealing in the first place.
Steve’s abdominals relaxed and now where there had once been hard muscle- was a round firm mound that sat just above his belt. Sweat pants had been necessary to make it through the past week, as Steve could no longer button his jeans…that had been a day of awkward tears.
They hit the compound just before dawn.
Below the waves the world was a kinder place,while it still harbored it's own dangers – those were dangers it's inhabitants could defend. While the world above was brimming with war and with that war came weapons, each more deadly than the last.
Following the steps higher, she notices a few of the small windows along the outer walls have been rubbed clean for observation of the surrounding property.
While this answer seemed a bit more cut and dry, it did not explain why or how Loki came to be this way. Then again, Loki was a master of disguise. They all knew how well Loki could conceal the truth if motivated. The problem was knowing the truth behind the motivation. “Loki can you tell me what happened?Is your heat normally irregular?”
“The problem is we don’t really know if this has any chemical or hormonal components because Loki hasn’t ever been examined in a traditional sense. I know he hates the idea of being poked and prodded, but its something we need to do. He isn’t getting any better left alone.”
Dangerous things.
That’s what Tony thought anyway, he figured if Steve had been awake, he would agree -given the raised gooseflesh on the blondes forearm.
"HE WON'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE WHEN I"M DONE WITH HIM!"
Tony didn‘t miss a beat. “Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.”
“Alright, it's time for you to get your head out of your ass.” The soldier barked, hands on hips staring him down.
Loki found himself standing in front of the refrigerator, reflection dulled by the brushed stainless steel. How did he even get here? He was slipping; everyday he lost a little bit more control. When was the last time he slept through the night? Well, it was hard to say when your dreams are filled with crying children that can't be seen.
“You will be useful to me yet Loki, doing all the work while I read all the benefits, such a fool you are. She whispered as the embedded the gem with a healing spell.
Pork won me, it was over from the start.
"Of that, I know not. You may well dismiss me and I should have no other recourse than to leave." Loki spread out his hands with a smile. "That said, I truly hope you would at least give me a single evenings audience to change your mind. You are...unlike any woman i have ever met and I am unable to think of another these many nights since our first conversation. While i regret that I was less than myself at the time, the pleasure of speaking with you...being tricked by you. Is one I shall never forget."
Stark found his feet and before he knew it he was practically running out of the workshop, not even waiting for the elevator, taking the stairs two and three at a time. Not even considering the how far up the penthouse was from here, nor was he congratulating his own physical stamina- so that was a win. There was only one thing on his mind, Steve, the kids, home.
The shower cubicle in the infirmary was tight but it was enough, thankfully, the whole room was tile so Steve just left the curtain open so he didn’t feel so penned in. The hot water made a world of difference; he stood there under the spray with his eyes closes just letting the water wash over his sweat and dirt stiff skin. If only the water could seep in deeper and clean, the darkness settled around his mind. Cleanse away all the doubt and anger that came with those damnable thoughts…
“The great mac and cheese debacle of 2017” Steve said feeling the alpha shiver. “That was more Clint than you if we're being honest.”
“Trying to make sure I get my protein sweetie?”
Suddenly a familiar face came into view, Natasha. She was saying something but her words were muffled by that dammed ringing that just wouldn’t go away.
The next morning would be a big one, so he wouldn't bother trying to wake Steve for a bottle in a few hours.
This is a tribute to the original David Bruce Banner,  Bill Bixby. Who's thoughtful and original portrayal of everyone's favorite gamma radiated scientist- still has Generations Falling in Love with this character.
“Thanks” The seasoned agent said walking between the two soldiers. There was a clatter as the lighter tumbled from his palm and onto the industrial floor.
The clash was like two trains colliding when Mallen and Stark met head to head. For every swipe of the enhanced villain's claws an answering clang of unnatural metal resounded. The heat of fire and the pitching whine of repulsor blasts. There is an instance when Mallen seems to take the upper hand before Stark head butts him. Sending the would be villain tumbling back clutching his skull.
“Hmmm, where am I?” His son asked
Lily was woken up by the same nurse knocking at her door, and entering with a cup of watery coffee and a packet of stale biscuits.
This did get his husbands attention, as she inclined his head toward tony without moving his shoulders.
“Steve, what do you mean the kids are missing” Tony said, suddenly all serious as he pulled on his trousers and a t-shirt.
“shit, shit shit” he said
It was in that moment that Lily decided that she was going to kill her brother, if he didn’t get killed before, and that was if she managed to survive this.
“come on, stark, now would be good” Natasha said as she turned and ran to the opening of the jet behind her.
“the kids” they both said at the same time, their eyes meeting, both full of fear.
“Steve, Steve” he whispered again, this time gaining the attention of Natasha, who last time he remembered wasn’t called Steve.
“Pops” came a very quite rasp from the bed.
Super hearing, of course.
“you see, your brother has done something that has frankly pissed me off, and so, if you don’t tell me where he is, I will hurt you and piss him off back, you are my bait. The ticket to the prize, the map to the treasure, so the speak” the man whispered, his hot breath tickling her ear.
“Get dressed and get up, the kids are missing” Steve said as he finally found his phone.
He was professionally trained then. Not some amateur.
Then she ran to the stairs, motioning for peter to follow her, just as a huge explosion rocked the building, throwing her and peter in various directions.
In all the panic, Tony had forgotten that everyone else in the room gets alerted of the silent alarm activation. Natasha was standing there, armed and ready to fight, fury was behind her, gun in hand, and Bruce and Thor were also there.
“have fun kids, you have three hours” he said as he walked out, calling distantly for his companions.
Lily barked some orders at him, but all peter could think about was how now was his time to prove to pops and dad that he could handle the responsibility of being Spiderman, ever since the incident where they unceremoniously found out through him ending up in hospital, they had been avoiding the subject, changing it when he brought it up, or ignoring him.
That was probably one of the worst calls she had ever made to anyone, and she felt awful, because she ratted Peter our and betrayed his secret. He was never going to forgive her. Feeling an overwhelming urge to burst into tears, Lily took a gulp of her now cold coffee and placed her head on her knees and closed her eyes, trying desperately to get rid of the image of Peter bleeding out on her bedroom floor and the feeling of him limp in her arms.
“it’s fine, but I wont do it again” she said back, quieter this time, knowing that he would hear her.
“thanks Friday” she said, relieved that it was just a malfunction, she made a mental note to tell dad about it when he and pops returned.
“Presbyterian” Lily replied.
“Hey, I get that you are worried and scared, but Peter was more scared that when he told you that you would ban him from doing it than he was of how you guys found out” lily shouted
Tony just hoped that he got to the tower in time, and that he wasn’t too late.
They came rushing towards her with the gurney and placed Peter on the gurney and ushered him and her into the vehicle.
Lily prepared herself for a loud and public telling off, but instead she got pulled into a crushing hug by her pops. Lily revelled in the warmth and comfort of her pops’ arms. And then she just let it all out. The stress of the past eight hours catching up to her, she couldn’t stop the tears or the sobs that erupted out of her mouth.
“Pete, you are in the hospital, got yourself stabbed” Tony replied as he stroked his hand through Peter’s curly brown hair.
“Tony, Tony, TONY!” He shouted, as he ripped open the curtains and frantically searched for his mobile.
“No worried, it can come out of your bank account” Lily laughed as she patted his leg gently and squeezed it hard.
She raised her head and realised she was no longer lying on the floor, she was tied to one of the kitchen table chairs, her arms tied behind her and her feet tied together at the base of the chair. She could vaguely feel blood dripping down the side of her face and onto her neck, but frankly she didn’t care.
“PETER” lily screamed, which she was rewarded with by a slap to the face, which sent her and her chair flying to the ground.
Well. Everything Tony ever seemed to want these days.
Tony smelt so familiar. Metallic. He must not have showered since taking off the suit, because Steve could still smell it on him. He took a deep breath of it, pressing his mouth against Tony’s hair and wrapping his arms delicately around Tony’s waist. He couldn’t help it. He just had to
Obviously, though, Steve wasn’t going to make him do anything. If Tony wasn’t ready, that was fine. He could wait as long as Tony wanted him to- even if he was never ready for the rest of their relationship, that would be okay. He would just have to… spend a little more time with his right hand or something, but he could do it. It wasn’t a problem.
“TONY!”
Bucky's face fell, and he turned to her quickly. "Please don't steal my girlfriend away from me," he whined, getting to his knees in front of her and then just batting Steve away when his foot poked at his shoulder.
He waved her off and then turned to Jane, the last one left. She shot him a nervous smile and he did the same- they hadn’t actually… well, they hadn’t actually spoken before this, and so neither of them really knew where to step.
“I think that’s pushing it, Sir,” JARVIS told him, to which Steve added, “yeah, babe, I wouldn’t go there just yet.”
“It always gets worse when Howard is releasing a new project,” Tony told him one time, after he’d pulled off his scarf and then wrapped it around Steve’s neck to try and warm him up, “I’m so sorry for keeping you waiting, I just couldn’t shake them-“
“Fuck,” he muttered as he turned back to his desk, throwing the icepack to the side carelessly now that Steve wasn’t around to tell him off for it. “
Thor seemed to be wondering the same thing, because he moved tentatively closer, placing a heavy hand on Tony’s shoulder. “You should have said something,” he said softly, “if we’d known you were struggling, we would have taken up more responsibility. I’m sorry. I was only joking just then; I don’t mind having him a few nights of the week. And I’m sure everyone else will be more than willing to look after him more as well.”
The grin on Bucky’s face was huge. “What, a worthless son of a bitch?” He asked, and Tony just sighed.
They were moving down the corridor, leaving the Avengers behind. They didn’t even care. “This was fun!” One of them called with a wave, “we should do it again sometime!”
“Cosa ho fatto per meritarti?” He whispered, barely even audible as his fingers moved up the knobs in Steve’s spine, “come fai a essere così perfetto?”
The speeding tickets piled up as he winded his way through New York on his motorbike, but he didn’t bat an eye to any of them, instead just squinting through the frigid night air and taking too-sharp turns at the last second. He got to the hospital in fourteen minutes and parked his bike uncaringly at the front entrance. Maybe it’d get towed, but that was far from his most important concern just then. There wasn’t anything else in his head, really.
“Steve?” Susan Storm’s gentle voice was soft, but concerned, and Steve’s eyes turned to the elevator where she had just appeared from, “what are you doing here?”
He plugged the wire in and then, taking a deep breath, twisted and yanked at the metal in his chest . The reactor came loose with an ominous hiss, and he gasped as his own heart began to fluctuate wildly, feeling the terribly familiar sensation of tightness on his chest that came removal of the pacemaker in his chest. Without the arc reactor inside to regulate the electrical impulses of his heart, it was starting to spasm and do things that no healthy heart should be allowed to do. It wouldn’t be long before he went into cardiac arrest as well, so he had to work fast to get Steve’s beating before he passed out himself. It was a race against the clock now.
“I’ve started the routine, Steve, and you know not to mess with my routine.” Tony grinned and plucked his moisturiser from the counter, trying valiantly not to react when Steve moved his mouth to Tony’s neck, kissing just under his ear. “You can’t try and seduce me right now. I’m busy.”
Steve harrumphed and turned away a little. “Kinda,” he said bluntly, “I mean, not the mugging. Just everything that came after would have been remarkably better had you not acted like an asshole, y’know?”
century Jane Austen character.”
“IT WAS!” Steve yelled, absolutely stricken. “I let you fall, I let you… you fell, and I promised myself I’d never ever let that happen again, and then when I get you back
Yeah. At this point, he was half convinced the man was a literal angel. Bucky said he just needed to go in there and ask for his number, but honestly? Steve was a little terrified of him. God- the man probably had people drooling over him at every chance they got. He was probably already with someone. It would be crazy for him
- no, they can’t- just tell them I’ll drop you off in twenty minutes.”
“Christ,” Steve whispered, terror igniting in his chest as he looked around for the red and gold of Iron Man. In that moment, he wasn’t thinking of any repercussions; wasn’t thinking of terrorism charges or Gulmira or a weapons hoard SHIELD thought were going to be used to try and take over the world with. There was only Tony, and the monster he’d just felled, and the fact that Steve
“No one is lifting any steel girders tonight,” Steve told them, lifting his head away from Tony’s shoulder for a moment.
“Oh- why?”
‘I love you’ he said, and then with a heave of his chest and a groan of pain, the world blacked once more and returned, back to darkness and rubble and hurt and no, God, Tony was grappling with Thanos for the gauntlet, face twisted and determined as he attempted to wrestle it from the Titan’s hand.
Bruce sighed. “They didn’t brainwash you, Steve. I promise.”
“Uh, no, your ban on interfering in my relationship was strict and permanent-“
. He didn’t aim it above his fucking head. As soon as you’d disappeared, I saw the gun, and it was nowhere near the sky. He
Steve had been there.
“Hey, hey, don’t cry,” Thor shushed Peter as he started to get more upset, something pleading in his voice, “please, I thought we were over this. I thought we agreed that crying was no fun. Come on, hey, shall we look at the rain again?” Thor stepped back, but Peter’s wails grew louder at that, and Thor looked at Tony pleadingly, expecting Tony to take him and help him be quiet.
He sat down gently next to Tony and bit his lip worriedly when Tony just chuckled a little, shaking his head softly. He was staring at his hands, and it made the long strands of hair at the front of his head fall into his eyes. “Hate my friends,” was all he mumbled in the end.
Which was amazing, really, considering how difficult it had been for Steve at the start. Tony had begun this believing that a family was the last thing Steve wanted. But he was proved wrong. Steve wanted it so, so badly. Tony could see it in the way he treated Peter. How he held the boy like he meant more than anything else in the whole world, the baby’s whole body tucked safely in one massive arm, and how he smiled so brightly whenever Peter laughed, or reached for him, or tried to say his name through a toothless mouth that couldn’t make the ‘T’.
“Yeah, well, you would say that,” Steve huffed and ran a hand over his face, “it comes easily to you. You just… know. But I see him and I freak out. Feel like I’m gonna do it all wrong.”
"Yeah," he muttered after a long silence, looking away. "Peter's smart, but he's also very good at being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Zeke was hanging around with his friends after school a week ago- they spotted him when he was coming out of a club. Obviously terrified the fucking kid- and I heard from him this morning that they've been keeping him for hours after school to do all their homework for them. Fucking
But it was too late to change his mind. Joints were already bending, limbs crumbling downward toward the juncture between floor and wall. Steve slipped quietly down, eyes shutting of their own accord as he went. In any normal circumstance when one of them ended up staying at a hospital overnight, they’d share the cot, curled in one another and gently making sure no injuries were pressed upon. In any normal circumstance, Steve would go to sleep knowing that Tony was there, safe in his arms. He’d bury his head into that the light of the arc reactor, or let Tony snuggle down into the warmth of his neck, breathing him in. They’d be with one another.
Again Tony just hummed and curled himself tighter around Steve.
DUM-E beeped his confirmation, rolling off to go and retrieve his special Dummyball immediately (Tony had coined that particular name). It was made of a thin flexible metal that was easier for the bot’s claws to grip to, and he had taken to dropping it at the feet of anyone who passed through the workshop in an attempt to get them to play. Tony said Steve had corrupted his worker robot and turned him into a dog, but Steve was pretty sure those attributes had been coded in by Tony himself.
He palmed a hand over his face and then headed over to his office on the other side of the hall. His phone was buzzing repeatedly in his back pocket as it had been all day, but Steve ignored all of the messages in favour of pulling up Pepper’s number and then dialling it instead. He knew that she was still awake- they’d been texting back and forth for the past few hours. Sitting down in the chair behind his desk, he flipped open the computer lid and then slipped the phone between his neck and ear, waiting until the call went through before beginning to talk.
“I can do it myself, if you’d rather-“
“Tony.” Bruce looked up at him solemnly, “Natasha’s right. It’s cut through an artery. If we don’t close this up now, it’s going to kill you in less than an hour.”
Famous last words.
or anything, it was more the fact that it was- well- Jane. Can’t have called that one, if he was being honest.
Tony, I’m so so tired-”
“Hey, your age isn’t the issue here,” Steve grinned and nodded over to Clint, who was trying to nap on Thor’s shoulder, “he’s supposed to be in the prime of his life right now, and look at him.”
Steve blinked. The underside of Tony’s bed was dusty, and playing havoc with his allergies, only made worse by the bloody nose. “I… Tony, I can’t exactly stay here for three hours, hiding under your bed.”
Unfortunately, because Good things never lasted, Tony shoved the shirt over his neck a second later and pulled it down, hiding the expanse of lean muscle and beautiful skin under a sharp red t-shirt that hung gorgeously around his shoulders. His hair was wet, sticking to his forehead and making little dark patches of water appear on the material as soon as it covered him. Surprise surprise, Steve was once again rendered speechless- Tony looked fucking
It happened as if in slow motion.
“Yeah, sweetheart, I’m back. Sorry I took so long- you know how it is,” Steve whispered, even though there was no-one there to hear them and barely any other noise in the tower aside from the staccato beat of rain against glass.
Tony sobbed,
“You can taste, if you want,” Tony blurted, and Steve shuddered violently at the words, his grip tightening to the point that bordered on pain as he made a low noise in his throat and kissed Tony’s neck, the cleaner version of what they were both thinking of. Definitely interested in that, then. “You wanna stay the night?”
“You have multiple PhD’s!”
But it happened. Steve didn’t leave, even when the worry and the doubt that he just didn’t belong here in this futuristic place with Tony set in, he still stayed. He pushed through. Because he wanted to try and find Bucky, and he wanted to at least goddamn attempt to integrate into the new world he’d been thrust into.
Steve nodded. The name… suited him. He could definitely see him as a Tony.
“Yeah, okay, seriously now Steve,” Bucky grabbed his shoulder and looked down at him seriously, “you might wanna not pull on that thread. Maybe go for someone a little less... Disastrous.”
“Uh oh,” he muttered, blinking rapidly as the girl grabbed his hands and started jumping up and down again.
Steve turned to glare at him for a second, before speeding up his pace on the stairs. Admittedly, he probably should have spent more time thinking this over. But he hadn’t known what Rumlow might have been doing to Tony, or whether waiting around might have ended in something unthinkable, so he’d had to cut some corners. And anyway—the original story Steve had fed Tony, about him breaking into the army base and wandering around in a janitor’s uniform, had a bit of merit to it, so was it really so bad that Steve was taking those ideas and just recreating them in real life?
“JARVIS, does this thing have weapons?” Steve asked briskly, searching the dash for anything that could cause some damage.
She chuckled and rolled her eyes. “No. You’re just lucky that I happen to be in New York, is all.” She stepped forward and then pressed a finger into his chest, pushing him back down onto the bed. “You were in quite a bad way when you arrived,” she said, as if discussing the weather. “Fortunately, I am very good at what I do. The regenerated tissue is healing nicely, and your body accepted the new cells remarkably well. You won’t even scar.”
“We can’t deal with it any more!" Bruce admitted, running a hand through his hair, and then looking down to his sheet. “It was okay at first. When you first got hitched, we were willing to let it slide. it would only be when you two were caught up in each other, and that was
Dumbly, Steve nodded. “Tony Stark,” he agreed quietly.
But he hadn’t. And now here they were.
“What’s a Jarvis?” Steve asked, turning around and cocking his head over to the desk that was covered almost entirely in electricals and various machines. Like one massive computer.
“Don’t you dare try and lie about this,” Steve said, now sounding properly angry, and Tony heard him stand up behind him as well, “you dote on that boy and you fucking know it, so don’t just try and lie through your teeth and expect me to believe it.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “right, so you’re doing them a favour by putting the place to use, I suppose?”
“I’m still fucking mad,” he said, voice muffled by Bucky’s T-shirt. Bucky’s arms came around him immediately, holding onto his shoulders and gripping tight.
He brushed his teeth tiredly, slumping against the sink and checking the weather for the day as he spat and turned on the faucet. He didn’t have work that day, so he could get away without doing his beard, but he quickly took out the tweezers and plucked a few hairs off his eyebrows all the same, just for upkeep. He really needed to call Paul in, see if he could fit Tony in for another dye-
He jumped where he was stood, euphoric with relief, and then heard Steve’s responding laugh and cheer as he stood up too and pulled Tony into a celebratory hug. “Oh sweetheart,” he began, because Steve called him
Not again.
Clint nodded, but when Steve made to stand, he pressed his hand against Steve’s chest and held him in place. Steve, already immeasurably weakened by the shock, couldn’t even fight it. “Nope,” he declared, “you stay right there. We’ve got evac coming in for you.”
“Steve,” Bruce said gently, taking Steve’s shoulders into his hands and squeezing, “you’re allowed to be here. Tony’s been wanting to see you for days.”
“Oh, great timing, Stark, you might just get in for the credits if you’re lucky,” Clint called out to him, chucking a peanut across the room as Tony wandered further in.
“They ordered a hit.” Tony’s eyes were wide as he looked down at Steve. “What was it that you were investigating?” He asked.
“It sure as hell is!”
“I’d opened my eyes and realised how fucking
Of course, he should’ve known it wouldn’t last. That just wasn’t how his day was gonna fucking go, was it.
Steve huffed, and then the doors slipped open with barely a sound and suddenly, he was back on solid ground again. The penthouse floor span out around him- the kitchen somewhere off in the left and the large open-plan living room directly ahead of him- and Steve felt his face split into a content little beam of relief.
They’d managed to pull him out of it, though, and from then on, things were a little clearer in his head. He remembers Natasha on one side of him and Steve on the other, holding him up and asking him if he could walk. Remembers asking what they’d done. Remembers the anger on Bruce’s face as he’d told Tony that they didn’t know yet, but they’d find out.
“Nah,” he said shortly, turning away, “I’m not really good, just making sure the kid doesn’t die in our care, you know? I don’t… he’s really annoying, mostly. Don’t worry, I’m not gonna go all lovey-dovey-family shit on you. I’d be crap at it anyway.” To prove his point, he rolled his eyes at Peter and pulled a face, stepping out of the baby’s grasp. Although it was a pretty dumb point to make- a second later he had to step forward and stop the little menace from rocking off the table in an attempt to follow him.
Steve once more took on the expression of a startled animal. “I just thought,” he began, voice weak, “maybe we should… just try and ease back into it—”
Tony paused. “It’s eleven?”
For a moment, it seemed as if Sam might push. But when he saw the closed-off way in which Steve was holding himself, and the firm purse of his lips, he wisely chose not to pursue it. “Okay then,” he nodded, concern flitting briefly across his face, “but I’m gonna be down here for the rest of the night, so if you feel like getting out the icecream and lamenting…”
Worse, though, was perhaps the fact that sometimes Tony would spot Steve looking at him with a face so fucking desolate that it punched the breath straight out of his lungs. He’d watch Tony when he thought Tony couldn’t see; keep his eyes glued to the stupid leg or the mottled bruising across his face. Fuck, he barely even
“I know. I think I’ve found a way in though, if that helps.” Tony spun around the robot until he hovered over the sea, and the robot turned to face him. “JARVIS finished his scan; he’s telling me the barrier around it is concentrated energy—it moves to follow where the attack is coming from. I’ve been flying around too much, that’s the problem. But if you and those army nuts over there concentrate a round of heavy fire at its front, then the energy field will be strongest on your end. Maybe I’ll be able to get through the back of it, where there’s less of a barrier.”
“Hey, it’s okay.  Really. We don’t have to.  Movie night, I mean. Or, we can, whatever,” Tony replied, looking over at Steve’s tightly drawn posture.  “Was it…something I said? The drone thing, or…with the contract?  I—I know I sometimes…my mouth says things before my head gets there, you know.“
Steve tried to bring his brain back online enough to respond.  “Yeah.  Yeah, I…yeah.”  Because he did.  Until that moment, maybe he hadn’t quite realized how much.  There had been so much energy expended on what had gone wrong, he hadn’t let himself think too much about what could possibly go right.
“Iraq,” Steve said after a moment, glancing over at Tony with a long, slow blink.
“Welcome to the Stark International Exposition of nineteen-seventy-f—ugh,” Howard stopped and held up a hand in front of his face, blinking. “I told you the light’s too God-damned bright in here. It’s like fucking Christmas in here.  Who did this? You know they’re filming this, right?  I told you they were filming.  The network,” Howard said.  “This tie’s terrible,” he said, taking it in one hand and looking down.  “God, who even picked this—Maria! Can you? Damn it.  The brown with the—yeah, that one,” Howard said as he pulled the tie off with a whipping sound and snapped his fingers in the direction of a woman with light blonde hair who walked slowly over with a brown tie hanging from her fingertips.
“Maybe you should,” Steve said.
The pilot had wanted to be a painter, he recalled, casting a sideways glance at Steve, but the world made him fly planes instead.
“Don’t,” Tony bit out. It came out shakier than he meant it in his head, but he’d said it, and just the act of getting the word out was a release.  “I’m going.  I need to—Steve,” Tony blurted out with a surprised gulp.
It did tricks.  Made the children laugh.
“Okay, I am really going to need some more specifics this time.  Use your words, big guy,” Tony replied.
His rhythm faltered, but he didn’t stop. Couldn’t stop. It felt like this was the only thing there was. Chasing this...this whatever it was in here. This was the only thing that he could do, the only thing that might be enough to keep the memories out of his mind, but even now, they filled his head, one after the other, clicking from one to the next like the old movie reels. He felt the stranger go suddenly rigid beneath him, not that Steve could blame him.
“Think your fifteen minutes is up,” Howard said with a pointed jerk of his head towards the back of the living room where it emptied into a darkened hall.
Experimentally, he moved his mouth down Tony’s shaft, taking him deeper. He pulled off then, until he held just the head between his lips, then shifted his head down again, breathing through his nose as he felt the solid weight of it slip just past the back of his tongue, gliding along the raw roof of his throat. Tony was almost preternaturally still, watching as Steve’s mouth worked around him, the white-knuckled grip he had on the bedding and sharp hisses of breath that occasionally escaped him the only indications of how much he was affected by what Steve was doing to him.
“More than okay.”
“Yes,” Tony grated out, his voice rough and scratchy.  He turned his head to the side, wide, glazed eyes looking at Steve with a desperate yearning.  “Please. Yes.”
. It was so bright and clear in his mind as he fell asleep, but when he woke the next morning, he was on the ground next to his pallet, his body tensed as if waiting for a blow, and the dirt in his mouth tasted like smoke.
“Ah.  Okay, great.  Right, well.  So, that’s settled, then,” Steve said with another small, fading smile, before he cleared his throat and soldiered on, because even Tony knew he was being shit conversation and Steve was trying in his own clueless, Alpha way.  Tony knew he could at least try, though he made no effort to do so.  Hell, he’d started off the evening by mentioning Steve’s dead parents, so, really, did he think he was going to top that and screw up more?  High bar, even for him.  “Speaking of your parents…if you want to visit them, you know you can.  Just call Happy, and he’ll take you.  Anytime.”
“What about you?” Steve asked, lifting his eyes to look up at Tony from under unfairly long lashes.  “I’m sorry, I—I don’t have…” he trailed off, fisting his hand in his lap and frowning.
“We need to talk,” Tony managed to get out. “Please,” he finished, when he couldn't help it, in what he hoped was a conciliatory tone, a gesture, rather than outright begging.
About him.
I’ve always liked that, Steve thought, and realized it was true and the thought didn’t hurt.
“I think you’re the first person to say that about the Court,” Tony barked out a laugh, mouth turning down.
“Are you kidding?  Cheeseburger and divorce, all in one day?  Who could resist?”  Tony quipped, starting the car and circling out of the parking garage with a squeal of rubber.  “Not saying best day ever, because there was that thing at Hef’s that time, but…I am completely onboard with pulling a drop-in.  You pants him—good luck with that, by the way, flyboy--I’ll grab the paperwork, and we’ll meet by the swing-set at dusk.  I love this plan.”
“Well, obviously, I know that. Just this morning, we—“ Tony began.
“Can I see it?” Steve requested.  His voice was low, not a whisper, but the kind of hushed tone you hear in hospitals, when bad news is delivered in soft tones.
“More like necessity is the mother of invention, from what I remember,” Steve gibed, though his expression didn't match the teasing words. He was watching Tony with a singular intensity, the way he used to, back when Tony could be his world. It was a heady, intoxicating thrill, to be the beneficiary of all that focus, not the way Tony could
They stayed that way for some untold amount of time, just Tony carding his fingers through Steve’s hair, a feeling of contentment warming him.  Finally, he slowly untangled his limbs from Tony, and let the other man help him to his feet, feeling a bit like an ungainly hatchling trying to walk a straight path on legs that didn’t feel quite his own.  Tony brought him his robe and helped him fit his arms into it, then placed a short, almost chaste, kiss to his lips, then groaned as he tasted himself on Steve’s mouth.
“You’re just worried he’s going to pour it on you and make you look like you peed yourself,” Tony replied, but walked over and carefully took the candle from Steve’s fingers.
“I’m going to take care of you now,” Tony promised, running his other hand up and down Steve’s back in a practiced motion. “Okay?”
“We had a deck someone sent us in one of those shoebox Christmas package for a soldier things.  It was a Star Trek UNO.  Some kind of special edition. Anyway, it had these special cards, like one was a Mind Meld card and one was Beam Me Up, and it was just so bizarre.  We’d be sitting around on the ground in the middle of nowhere, Afghanistan, and there would be five guys raising holy hell because someone slapping down the Double Tribble card,” Steve recalled.  “The real trouble with tribbles is that they are bad for unit cohesion, apparently.”
A long corridor led to a large, vaulted room flanked by stone benches on all sides.  Painted tiles on the walls and ceiling depicted scenes of birds, flowers, water creatures and bathing figures, while oil lamps swung from the rafters and hung from the walls, wafting a delicate incense into the room.  Several concubines sat or reclined on the stone benches, chatting and taking small cups of tea soaked with mint leaves from their attendants, though the conversation stopped when Steve entered.  He could feel the weight of their gazes on him, though they said nothing.  Steve undressed and slipped on the sandals Cam provided, then wrapped the embroidered cloth around his waist.
Taking the suit out of the closet, he unzipped it from the dust bag and ran a hand over the lapel.  It was a dark blue, with a few small crystals shining across the pockets and collar.  Sure, blue had the downside of his mother being right, but it did look good on him.  The bling was flashy, but not ostentatious.  A dark blue shirt and matching tie went underneath, with a single, crystal stud for the tie pin.  He spent too much time trying to shame his hair into cooperating. Without much success.  A bit of eyeliner and the barest swipe of shadow were enough, he thought.  The mascara was somewhat mockingly described by the name Better Than Sex, but he gave it a shot, and ended up with blotches of dark stain at the corners of his eyes and grave concerns about the love lives of make-up marketing people.  Heeled boots were last, giving him a bit of height and making his ass look great under his jacket.
“Twelve percent, huh?” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow.
“I’m going to take such good care of you, Tony,” Steve promised, breaking off the kiss, but pressing his lips to Tony’s forehead instead.  “You’ll be so beautiful,” he murmured into Tony’s skin.
“I have some for you.  Don’t worry,” Tony said quickly, holding up a placating hand.  “You can keep them here for when you want to use the pool.  We won’t violate any of Romanov’s little rules, promise.”  The agency had strict rules about gifts.  Everything had to be run through them, not from the client directly.  Ms. Romanov said this was to avoid any of her people from feeling pressured into accepting something or believing they then owed something that wasn’t specifically negotiated, which made some sense as far as it went.  Steve suspected the less altruistic truth was that the whole rule against on the side gifts was to ensure the agency didn’t miss out on their cut, but he wasn’t going to argue with Ms. Romanov. About anything. Ever.  Clint agreed this was a good rule to live by.
“Sweet and grumpy?  Those two things don’t even go together, Rogers.  They are, in fact, diametrically opposed,” Tony replied.  “Besides, I am
“What should we do about…those?” the overseer asked, pointing at the shackles that still held Steve’s hands and feet.
“What do you have in your house that’s electronic?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrows in challenge.
“No.  No, you’re right.  I need to deal with this.  It was a long time ago, and hell, who knows? This might actually be good for me.,” Tony replied tightly, feeling a pit open up where his stomach used to be.  Knowing he needed to deal with it and actually wanting to deal with it were two very different things.  He ran his hands up and down his face, trying to clear his head.  “Like one of those bonfire-of-the-ex things.  Cleansing.  Healing. You’ll see.”  He wasn’t sure which one of them he was trying to convince, but neither of them seemed to be exactly buying it.
Except, Howard’s machine
What if he just walked over right now and kissed Tony, leaning there against the rail, all sun-warmed, his hair a bit mussed from the winds that came down off the mountains and swept over the desert?  Would Tony melt into him, like he had before, all sweet and soft, or would it be something else this time, something a bit darker, a bit rougher, knowing they both wanted it, whatever their reasons and whatever that meant?
“Figured that much. What with you not generally getting married on a whim. Though, if you gotta, go for broke, I guess,” Barnes said, looking over at Tony.
Steve’s heart pounded in his chest, echoing a drumbeat in his ears, and for a second, he was watching the whole scene from under a table, the spindly wooden legs partially blocking his view of two other pairs of legs, one in hose, one in a dark pair of coveralls still stained with oil and grease, and then he was here again, in Brock’s apartment, like a rubber-band snapped back into place.
“Well,
Okay, it was possible that his heart was currently doing the Macarena for other reasons, but still. Point was, Tower had a great elevator, steps sucked, and he hated Brooklyn, Tony thought, leaning over the railing and looking down. It was also possible he was fixating on the steps for other reasons than his FitBit counter.
“Tony!” Rhodey shouted as a particularly loud boom echoed through the chamber.  “Get back from the—“
“Why aren’t we friendless and alone?” Tony asked the room, tossing up his hands in frustration as he broke apart from Steve. He craned his head around Steve’s shoulders and shot Rhodes an annoyed look.
“Yes. One hour,” she replied, then the line went dead.
When he finally managed to come back to himself enough to gain some modicum of control over his body, Tony was pulling him over onto his side and away from the wet spot he’d made on the bed. Steve started protest that Tony hadn’t come, but closed his mouth when he felt Tony drag a hand up through the crack of his ass to gather the remaining slick and coat his own cock with it. Tony with a plan was generally a good thing, Steve figured, a pleasant buzz filling his ears as the blood started pounding again.
“Did you send him to Rumlow?” Steve choked out.  “General Rhodes.  Did you—” Steve broke off and sucked in a gulp of air.  “Did you send him to Rumlow?”
“See No Evil agrees with me,” Rhodey said happily.
Steve woke with a start, clutching at his chest, a scream halfway up his throat.  He gasped for air, panting hard, his vision swimming and his ears ringing. He swiveled his head, looking for Shellhead, but he was nowhere to be seen.
Alphas who had gotten hit by the reality-sucks-stick were really one of life’s true pleasures, he thought somewhat waspishly as he watched the delivery driver climb back into his car.  They were so wonderfully shocked and dismayed by the world not conforming to them and what they had been told they were entitled to have.  Must hurt to find out that all the promises were just a great, big lie sold to them by a society that didn’t want to admit it couldn’t be true for everyone, and now you just have to put on a hat with pizza on it and suck it up like the rest of the world.
“No, I--stay,” the King said abruptly, finishing his ministrations with a sudden hurry and tossing the towel aside before getting up and walking towards what Steve had decided to call his workshop only to turn on his heel and walk back to the side of the bed next to Steve.  “Sleep,” the King said, glancing down at him, then quickly looking away.  “You should sleep.  I have work. There’s…I have work to do.”
“Sorry, I—sorry,” Steve rushed out, almost automatically as he stared with a sort of numb fascination at the splintered wood in his hand.
Do not cry.  Do not.  Do not do anything stupid.  Like try to kiss him again.  Do not.
“You make me sound like some kind of Pollyanna. I was in the Army for eight years, you know,” Steve countered, shaking his head at the two of them.
“I’m just gonna…” Steve said, pointing down at his phone.
“Second star to the right,” he heard Steve shout around a whoop of a laugh that was filled with wonder.
“I’m not going to buy—of course, I know that.  Things aren’t love,” Tony quoted from memory, either from an old therapist or four or a fortune cookie, he couldn’t be sure.  “Why?  Do you think there’s something there that he would—okay, no, fine, right, I’m going.  God, one giant bunny and suddenly it’s like you don’t trust my gift-giving instincts. You have a meeting,” he said, recovering quickly under Pepper’s glare.  He followed Pepper out the frosted glass doors of her office and into the hallway, tapping his hands together in anticipation.
“He’s color-blind,” Tony recited from memory.  “He’s color-blind, he has scoliosis—look at his shoulders, you can see the difference.  He’s got asthma.  Anemia. A heart murmur.  Allergies.  A shit immune system.  God knows what else.  Oh, and he’s what?   Just over a year old or so?  I mean, so, there’s that.  I’m just saying, cute baby, but there are some issues here, which you lot seem to be fine ignoring.  Like, what the holy fuck are we going to do about this?  Thor?  This was your asshole brother playing Daddy Day Care.  Tell me there’s something labeled ‘eat me’ around here other than my boxers.”
Tony’s hand fell away from Steve’s cock, and he made a strangled sound that was almost a whine, earning a pleased smile from Tony.  He grasped Steve’s hand and led him to the bed, pushing him down with a gentle nudge and climbing between Steve’s legs, palming Steve’s cock through the fabric again, not stroking, just holding him with a firm pressure that made Steve want to buck up against his hand.  He didn’t, though.  He held himself still.  Waited.  Soon, Tony’s fingers started to work him, massaging, kneading, gliding up and down over the soft fabric, the heel of his palm digging in, then relaxing.
knew, which still made his stomach twist with sourness.
“That was going easy?” Steve asked.  Next time. More. Harder. He didn’t know what Tony meant, but it didn’t seem to matter to his body.  He felt his cock stir at the thought and shifted slightly on the bed as it hardened underneath him. Tony raised an eyebrow and gave him a pleased, knowing look.
,” he added.
“Yes, but you would likely say that if you had lost a limb, so forgive me my skepticism,” Tony retorted, making Steve huff out a startled laugh.
“Is he okay? Was—was he here?” Steve managed, though the effort of actual words was far more than he would have thought.   There was something playing at the edge of his mind, like watching a home movie before it came into full focus.  A dark shadow moving around the room, circling the foot of his bed, talking, sometimes, sometimes just moving, back and forth, close but out of reach.  Sometimes just standing there, and he’d liked those times, felt safe.  And once—once he remembered thinking someone was upset, and that he should comfort them, and he’d tried to get up, but he’d been tied down or—no.  Not tied down, he realized.  The wires and IV lines running like a cat’s cradle from his body to the machines and medicines that were trying to help keep him alive, or tell Bruce what was killing him, he wasn't sure.
, and he'd somehow managed to fuck that up in truly epic fashion, the way only Tony could.
him to.  I talked to him when I wasn’t supposed to.  Why?  Why did I do that?  I shouldn’t have done that.  This is my fault.  They’ll know.  They’ll see.  Move.  Move, damn it.
It wasn’t like there had ever really been a chance he would say no to helping Stark. No one ever said atonement was easy. Steve swallowed past the lump in his throat that he was fairly sure was the remnants of what little pride he had left. Stark needed a husband, one the press and police would believe he’d been drunk enough to marry on a whim. He could be that person for a few days. He’d faced worse, after all. Stark was watching him, a quiet, assessing look on his face. He shook his head, a grimace splitting his features, defeat and self-disgust, recognizable only because Steve had seen them too many time to count.
“But not okay,” Tony pressed.
Piece by piece, he locked the clasps into place, finally settling the helmet over his head.  The boots sounded heavy and metallic as he crossed the garage floor.  He rummaged around until he found what he wanted, then headed outside, sparing a last glance at the lily, floating in a bowl of water by his workstation, where Neil’s brightly colored face happily told him that the greatest of people that have ever been in society, they were never versions of someone else.  They were themselves.
“Nothing,” Steve replied, then glanced away and flattened his mouth.  “He had me crawl to him.  That was all.” The words hung there, between them, for long moments.  Steve could feel the heat of the forge.  It felt stifling all of a sudden, as if it was creeping into his nose and down his throat, burrowing into his lungs, all this heat, everywhere.  He could feel a sweat dampening his brow, but when he brought a hand up, his skin was cool to the touch.
“They kill the most deadly of serpents, ten times their size, and show no fear, just make this sort of chattering noise at it while it hisses,” Yinsen added. “I think he means it as a term of endearment, Stark.”
So close. So close to so much. To everything.
He stared up at the green canopy draped above, with its twisting vines and fluttering, golden birds.  His vision blurred, so he let his eyes fall shut. His head filled with a mossy fog. His hands were everywhere, except where they weren’t supposed to be.  Chest, nipples, in his hair, stroking his face, stomach, thighs, between the vee of his legs, over his balls, cupping them, playing with his hole, rubbing at the thin line of skin hidden underneath it, back up again.  The repetition was good, he decided. His hands slowed, his motions going sluggish and light. A pleasing, soft rushing sound filled his ears like a steady rain against the grass.
“Got it in one,” Tony grinned.  “Some guys, I don’t know, like they think it’s more manly or some shit to top.  Since, you know, women bottom.  Or something.  Hey, don’t look at me like that.  I didn’t come up with this,” Tony objected, holding out his hands in a placating gesture.
Steve jerked his head towards the door and Barnes and Sam followed the two boys as they shuffled out of the room and into the darkness of the warehouse.  He stood there a long moment, rubbing at his temples with one hand.
Tony glanced over at Steve and tried to picture him with a paunch and receding hairline.  For some reason, it made him think of Obie, and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat, turning to look out the window instead.
He couldn’t, of course. Didn’t even really want to. Well.  He did a little.  Now. But, he’d regret it later.  Still, he thought, hearing a particularly loud crunching sound that reminded him the walls were cinderblock, it would be a little bit before he could tell Steve he was fine.  It would take a bit of time before Steve knew that.  He was…okay with that, Tony decided to himself.  Steve wouldn’t really hurt anyone, not unless he found Tony in any state other than mild annoyance, anyway.
“Well,” Steve began, raising his eyebrows as he looked down at the crabs with their neatly cracked shells, “I reckon I’ve eaten a lot worse.  Back in Brooklyn, we weren’t exactly eating like kings, let’s just say, though Ma did better by us than what a lot of folks had. Lots of kids ended up begging,” Steve continued, “stealing, scavenging for garbage scraps, whatever they could find.  Scott-- he was in my regiment--he grew up on the streets from about the time he was twelve, or so he reckoned it. Best pickpocket you’ve ever seen, Shellhead,” Steve said as he peeled open the broken shell of one of the crabs. He chewed as he talked, not that Shellhead seemed to mind.
“Do you go on a lot of first dates?” Steve asked curiously, ignoring Stark’s remark about the pants, though he would be the first to admit that the material was pretty nifty.
“You're up late, too,” Steve observed, moving to brace his hands against the wooden deck railing, leaning over just slightly to watch the flow of the small stream that erupted from the bowels of the mountain and gurgled down the side. Like tears, Tony thought, seemingly out of nowhere.
He can claim I’m dead, Steve thought.  He can tell everyone some terrible mishap befell me on the trip.  He can tell them he grew tired of me and sold me.  He can tell them anything but the truth, that I loved him and he loved me, and I left him anyway. A dry, shuddering sob escaped him, wracking through his body.
Steve’s fingers grazed his cheek, drawing his attention.  “Hey,” Steve said softly. Tony doffed his sunglasses and glanced over at Steve with a flat, nervous grimace.  “It’ll be
Steve rolled again. An eight.
Thank you all so much for reading this! I hope you enjoyed it. I had a really good time writing it.
Tony’s birthday, and he wanted him to have a good time, or maybe because Steve was too stubborn for his own good, who knew?  Didn’t really matter.  Steve was trying to control the switch, and that was something.
“Seventy years? Wow, okay, that’s--wow,” Tony stammered, momentarily stunned.  “You look good for your age,” Tony managed, then winced at the poor joke, but the alien smiled, seeming to understand.
“Hey, Happy,” Steve called out as Happy pulled open the rear door for him.
Steve stared down at the box for a long moment, his cock twitching with interest under his robes.  Tony hadn’t…not since the night before they left the city, though Steve had assumed that was to give him a chance to heal from his punishment, but now, the thought took root in his head and he couldn’t shake it.  He looked up at Tony, who flashed him a knowing look from across the carriage as it trundled back down the road to the Highcastle.
too much interest in you.  I killed the men who followed you from the pub in Gulleytown that night after you buried your mother when you drank far more than was wise, young Steven.  Thrice I’ve killed for you Steve, a payment in blood that I was, admittedly, rather pleased to make.”
Tony stared at him for a long time, mouth slightly open, his eyes narrowed a bit, unsure and...calculating?  Yeah. Calculating some equation in his head that Steve was some kind of variable in, but he had no idea what it was.  “I’ll go,” he said finally.  “It’ll be nice to get out a bit, right?”
trying, Steve.  It isn’t as if I do not know your feelings on this. You have made that clear.  So, help me make it better, help me make it closer to what you think it should be.  I can’t change the way of the world, even for you, but together, we can make it better. If you would just--just
It turned out to be less of a trail than Steve had assumed. He should have checked it first and made sure it was clear before bringing Tony down, he thought, stomach twisting with embarrassment.  He kept looking at Tony, who didn’t seem particularly bothered at the oversight, though he occasionally gave the overgrowth a baleful look.
He didn’t break rhythm again.  This was about Steve, now, and Tony loved it.  Loved the way his body opened for Steve, impossibly wide and loose, so as to make him wonder if he would ever be the same again when Steve was done.  Maybe he wouldn’t.  He wasn’t sure he cared.  He dropped his hands from Steve’s arms and stretched them out over his head, reaching to curl the comforter in his hands.  Back arching, he met Steve’s thrust, letting Steve set a brutal pace and just…taking it.  Being there.  Being taken and used, and God, it was glorious.  He didn’t have to think.  He didn’t have to do.  He didn’t have to be.  He could just lay there and let Steve have his way, and sometimes, he thought there was nothing better.
“I was trying to keep him from getting busted.
“No,” Stark replied.  “I’m not.”
“Huh?” Tony mumbled.  He was already slipping inside the garage again, holding the door ajar with just his elbow.  “Oh,  yeah, fine--six.  See you then.”
“Just—ah--yeah, just give us a minute, okay, mom?” Tony asked, twisting around to catch her straighten her shoulders and soldier on with a curt nod.
“Why are you even doing this?” Tony asked, his voice hitching a bit, catching Steve’s eye briefly before turning to stare down at the bed.
Steve bent his head down to nuzzle the side of Tony’s neck, then pressed his mouth to Tony’s.  A moment later, Tony heard soft laughter against his check.  “You’re going to have to check now, aren’t you?” Steve questioned lightly.
“You know it’s killing Tony not to be able to just spoil the hell out of Steve.  Let him have a pass on the lunch thing,” Rhodey suggested evenly.  “How many more do we need?” Rhodey asked with a nod at the grill.
“Hi,” Tony interjected, giving Barnes a single wave.  “So.  This is incredibly awkward.”
“Steve, literally no one cares that I’m here,” Tony said, leaning back in the chair and then promptly deciding that was a bad plan as it shook back and forth, scraping the floor noisily.
“Tony….” Pepper said, voice low with concern.  “Who is Steve?”
“Better,” Tony added. “For credit.”
He stepped down into the sunken living room and walked over to stand in front of where Tony was sprawled on one part of the large sectional sofa, having loosened his bowtie so it hung in strands around his neck and kicked off his shoes while Steve was admiring the art collection.  He was back to tapping on his tablet again, idly sipping from his drink, and for someone supposedly paying Steve a lot of money for an evening’s company, seemingly content to let Steve study the art at his leisure.  Tony looked up at his arrival, and Steve felt his skin warm where Tony’s glance ran up his body before meeting his eyes.  Ok, so not so content then, Steve thought, watching Tony’s eyes darken to deep, brown pools, heard the slight hitch of breath as he stood in front of him.
“Yeah.  Yeah, J, go ahead and do that.  Have the Pollack packed and stored,” Tony said.
Tony looked down at his hand, almost in surprise.  Right.  That happened.  “I was going to vaporize the watermelons.  To help with the cleaning.  Because of the thing Clint and Hulk were doing that had nothing to do with our unborn children.  Cannot emphasize that enough,” he responded after a beat, breathing out a sigh of relief at his quick-thinking.  And Bruce said Steve’s Heat was going to affect his rational thinking abilities.  Ridiculous.  Vaporizing the melons was not only energy efficient, which Steve would no doubt appreciate, because he was very environmentally conscious, but also completely believable.  Believable was really very close to truthfulness anyway.
“Stay,” Tony replied.  “Please.”  He heard Steve blow a puff of air out of his nose in acquiescence and felt the bed shift as Steve took his place between Tony and the door.  Tony rolled over and flung an arm over Steve’s chest, pillowing his head there and nudging Steve’s arm up and around his shoulders.
“Fine.  Well, I’m working on the background research for the Board presentation we discussed.  Plenty of graphs, don’t worry.  I’ve already gotten a call from someone at the IRS’s criminal investigations division.  Are you sure—Tony, are you sure that none of this stuff with the judge can lead back to SI?”  she asked.
Tony huffed out a laugh, bit his lip and shifted his hips a bit, spreading his legs a little wider.  Emptiness pounded inside him like a drumbeat.
“You didn’t have to go to all this trouble,” Tony threw out, but promptly belied the notion a bit by piling food on his plate like he was a Weight Watchers burnout at a Girl Scout Cookie sale.
science, Tony.  Coming up with the right ingredients and dosages for the right condition, it’s as complicated a math as your weapons are, and just as important in saving lives, if not more so.”
He was drifting.  Numbers ran through the edges of his brain, but none of them meant anything.  The smell of Steve’s skin meant something.  The heady musk of Steve’s scent that leeched into Tony’s pores, that meant something.  The warmth of Steve’s body coiled around him, keeping him safe, taking care of him, that meant something. The rest…it was all passing through his head in a fog, slipping in and out, too hard to catch.
Tony drew in a shaky breath, harrumphing a little, and nodded once. “Well, no matter, really. It is Ul-Tarn whose measure we must take if we want to continue to use these lands as a barrier to the Chitauri, though he needs our strength and resources just as we need the buffer of his power and the plenty of his trade routes.”
“You speak German?” Tony questioned, still trying to find his way through the flow of conversation. Were they talking about robots? Movies? Or something else that Tony had missed in the flash of realization that Steve seemed to think robots were...swell? Who the fuck said swell? He felt like he should ask for malt at the dime store.
“Ardennes forest,” Tony finally said, voice heavy and thick with tightly-held emotion.   “That was you.  There are pictures in the file. You look…God, you’re so damned young.  I forget that sometimes.  Barnes was there.  I guess this was right before…what happened.  Barnes is always there.  That’s one thing I kept noticing, all through this whole fucking mess of a file. Barnes is right there next to you, the whole time.”
“Speaking of home……what now, Tony?” Pepper asked. “You’re just going to hang out at SHIELD?”
Tony frowned, head tilting to the side as he scanned the room.  “Wait…speaking of Obie…did you…hurl a room service platter at his head?” They both looked over at Obie’s prone form in unison.
So, he might have spent some time researching all this.
“I’m not,” Kirk retorted and slumped back.  “I’m really not.”
“Eh, that’s Pepper’s doing.  I’d have velvet Elvis and Dogs Playing Poker, if it were up to me,” Stark told him with a grin.
"Not that it mattered much, but I'm glad I was there. Just wish I could've done more.  I should've known something was--" Steve broke off, glancing down at Tony.
Tony dressed slowly.   He drank two pouches of juice and felt instantly better. The roll-looking thing tasted a bit like a chewy dumpling of some unidentifiable flavor, but it was good, and ridiculously filling for something so small.  He poked absently at the screens along the side of the table, watching as the gel formed and reformed into various shapes and displays that he couldn’t read appeared on the screen. Fascinating, he thought.
That was a lie, Tony could tell.  Howard was saying that because of Tony’s mutinous expression and, well, past behavior being something of a predictor of future behavior and all that.  But, it clearly wasn’t a done deal.  He wasn’t stupid.  His mom was still flitting about the military brass like a hummingbird, darting in and out to bring drinks and cigars where they gathered in the billiards room.  Tony could recognize the nervous desire to please, the hushed, unadulterated envy that settled over his father whenever he was around a bunch of Alphas.
“You were beautiful, Steve. Perfect. My perfect Omega. Perfect. God, Steve, I love you, I love you, I love you so much,” Tony murmured against the crown of Steve’s head. “You’re amazing. Amazing, beautiful, perfect,” Tony kept repeating, burying his mouth into Steve’s sweat-slicked hair, stroking the sides of his face and down his arms and back, like he couldn’t quite figure out where to touch and wanted to touch everywhere.
With a heave, Steve tossed the cup farther up onto shore where the tide couldn’t reach it, then shucked off what remained of his shirt and pants and stepped out into the clear, cool water. The creature watched him, as it always did. Steve couldn’t decide if it perhaps thought he would drown in the shallow water or if it was just curious.   He ducked under the water, then came up, shaking his head to jettison some of the water. When he looked over to the rocks, the creature was gone, though it reappeared a moment later just a few yards away from where Steve swam, as it always did.
He thought he should tell Tony that, though the words seemed distant now, fleeting, as if they had run ahead and he was far behind. He turned his head enough to brush a kiss into Tony’s palm instead, basking for a moment in the rush of pleasure as he felt a shudder wrack Tony’s body at the gesture.
mattered.  Because he believed the others didn’t.”
“I need to get into your father’s safe,” Steve blurted out.  He reached up and rubbed at his temples, then pinched the bridge of his nose.  “If you want to scream or call security or hit that button under the desk, go ahead.  I’m not going to stop you. But, there’s something in the safe that I have to have. It’s important.  Not—not money or jewels or whatever, it’s…just papers.”
Steve left him.
“I’m pretty sure I’m the same person whichever way we make love,” Steve replied, his frown starting to resemble Hulk trying to do equations.  Tony felt a small, fond smile curve his mouth. Steve always called it making love, and at first he’d thought Steve just didn’t want to say ‘sex’ or something, but Steve, he’d quickly learned, was hardly a prude.  Turns out a bunch of young Army boys stuck in a warzone talked about two things:  food and sex.  Who knew?  “Besides,” Steve continued, his frown truly becoming adorably epic.  “That makes it sound like the position associated with women is considered the, well, the lesser position.”
By the time Tony made it back to the Tower, he couldn’t keep the airy grin off his face.   Pepper took one look at him and almost burst into tears.   Rhodey looked up from the conference tabled, eyed Tony and steepled his hands in front of him.
“You okay to do that?” Steve asked.
“I shouldn’t—I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have…I didn’t mean to unload on you like that. Hell, I’m not even supposed to talk about it,” Steve told him.  “Classified,” he shrugged.
Probably should never, ever mention this to Bucky.
“It’s…more than that, Obie,” Tony said, trying to keep his tone carefully neutral.  “Steve…we were—see, actually—God, this is awkward.  I don’t know what Dad told you.  If he told you anything.  Fuck.  Okay, back in college, I kind of got married.  It…Dad, he…wasn’t thrilled about it, let’s just say.  Interfered.  Which is a nice way of saying fucked up my life.  Steve and I divorced.  Or, we thought we did. There was some problem with the papers.  Jarvis, I think.  He messed it up, trying to help, only then they died, and 9/11 happened, and everything that maybe could’ve gotten fixed, didn’t.  I don’t know.  I don’t know, Obie, it’s crazy, the whole thing.  I know how it sounds.  Insane, right? But, it’s real, and I’m…happy.  I’m happy, Obie.”
Steve was warm. Not hot or cold anymore.  Just warm.  He ached, but like running a long way and slowly coming to a halt.  His breathing was shallow, but steady, almost like…dreaming of being asleep.  Finally, Tony nudged Steve’s chin up with one finger until Steve managed to return his gaze, though there was a halo of softness at the edges of his vision, as if someone had rubbed the colors into smoothness.
“Hello?” Steve said again when no welcome came, then he slowly pushed open the door and stepped inside.
The alien wasn’t wearing anything that Tony could see, anyway.  It occurred to Tony that maybe the alien didn’t wear clothes, maybe that was why Tony’s spacesuit was gone.  Perhaps it hadn’t known what clothes were for? It (he?) was looking down at Tony with an intense look that almost seemed...concerned?  Worried? Confused? Hard to say, exactly, though the alien’s face seemed expressive in the way that most human faces were. At least from what Tony could tell over the all-consuming panic.
His phone vibrated insistently in his pocket. Probably the voice of reason calling, Tony assumed, so he ignored it.
“Come on.  Get in here. Check the baby gate or whatever you need to do.  Hey, I still have the chew toy you brought last time.  Barely any teeth marks.  I’m thinking the separation anxiety is getting better,” Tony said.  He tried to smile.  He was fairly sure from Coulson’s expression that he didn’t pull it off.
He drank his ice water, throat suddenly parched, and turned to go.  He would have spilled his client’s drink on the dark-haired man behind him if not for reflexes honed from years of dealing with Bucky’s shenanigans.
“I—I want—I am trying,” Steve said. “I am.”
Peering up through the tinted window up at the brick facade, he felt a loose, fluttering sensation ripple through his stomach, making him queasy. He was caught in a strange sort of stasis of disbeliefe, where he wanted desperately for this to be true and couldn't bear it to be true at the same time. He ran a shaky hand back and forth across his forehead, mouth twisting into a grimace.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright,” Tony said slowly.  “If you wish it.”
“I—yeah.  Yeah, it will be good, I guess,” Tony admitted.  “It’s just…it’s hard to leave you.  This…it’s so new.  I don’t…I mean, what if…”
Steve shook his head helplessly and wrapped his hands behind Tony’s head, threading through the soft curls and drawing Tony’s mouth back down.  He could feel the smile on Tony’s lips as he obediently started suckling again, harder this time, tugging and flicking and working his tongue around the nub while he thrust his cock along Steve’s and through the thatch of hair at Steve’s groin, sending a low, buzzing friction thrumming through Steve’s body.
Tony shot a look at Happy, who just shook his head, then ducked into the back of the sedan while Happy slid into the driver’s seat.  Tony let his head fall back against the curve of the seat, closing his eyes for some amount of time he couldn’t quite track, then twisted his neck to look out the window as they drove.  He watched it all go by with a strange, detached sort of unreality.  A part of him still couldn’t believe the whole evening had even happened, but when he looked down, his watch was still there, marking the passage of time as the sedan turned off the highway and onto the familiar road that wound up the mountainside.
“Small meals throughout the day are the key,” Tony informed him, one eyebrow raised in challenge. Steve grinned and stood, bending to take the clay pot off the tray as he did. He climbed onto the bed, feeling it dip beneath his weight as he sat near Tony’s feet. He took a hot towel from the pot and replaced the lid, then started gently rubbing the towel over and around Tony’s foot, massaging and kneading as he cleaned. He worked his way from one foot to the other, then up Tony’s legs, replacing the towel as it cooled for a warmer one.
Tony nodded jerkily and looked over out the window as the hotels and casinos swept by in a long line of flashing lights and promises of a different life, if you could beat the house.  Wasn’t that always the way of it? Tony supposed it was. God, he hoped he hadn’t screwed this up, he thought to himself, rubbing an anxious hand over his mouth.
His heart thumped against his ribs. He could hear it echoing in his ears. Blood pumping and rushing lower. Sucking in a shaky breath, Steve found Tony’s gaze on him again.
“That’s what you do, right?  Keep it professional?  Keep a certain distance, even when you’re…you know,” Tony said, mouth flattening for a moment before he turned to look back down on the Strip.  “Probably easier that way.”
Steve reached down and fingered a strand of the pearls and opals that dripped from the chain that circled his waist, then up to the golden collar at his throat with the large ruby that proclaimed him Tony’s.   He forgot, sometimes, that it was there.  The weight of it, the discomfort of something around his neck, the awareness of it, all that had faded at some point.  He wondered what it would be like to take a breath without it.  He wondered if he could.
