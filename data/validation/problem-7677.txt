As he worked through the increasingly complicated set of poses, he had been given, the voice returned.
Steve laughed,
Tony drifts safe in his Alpha’s embrace, he is aware of Steve touching and marking him, but is too blissed out to worry about how he will look afterwards.  His hole is still gripping tightly onto his Alpha’s knot, determined to milk it of every drop of cum.
Bucky continued to squeeze Tony’s throat, cock pulsing another load of cum as he gloated over the terrified expression on the omega’s face.  As the bitch lost consciousness he ground his knot further up in to the tight heat  just so he could watch the unconscious flickers of pain cross the omega’s face.
“Omega come!”
Don’t be sad Natty, by the way that is your new name, you better get used to answering to it quickly.  You were a freak before but now you are just a  broken omega, and without your cock you can concentrate on being a good little breeding bitch for the dogs and a well behaved pet for your mistress.”
Steve traced the curves of his omega’s soft fleshy bubble butt, before reaching round to the front to release the buttons.  Pushing the drawers down so Tony’s dimpled butt was in full view, he did a quick inspection to make sure that both the omega’s plug and cock cage were still in place.
Tony whined as the chain attached to his cock was pulled tighter, stretching his cock and tugging on his piercing, shivering with arousal he writhed and moaned as he fucked himself on the vibrating dildos riding the knife edge of pleasure and pain.  He lost track of the time as each orgasm was pulled from him until his was free falling in to his quiet space, floating in a web of complex equations with none of the frantic noise that usually filled his mind.
This is chapter really got away from me, so I am splitting it up into probably 3 chapters.
“Please, please!  Harder! Mmmmm need more, come on please just do it, can’t take much more, so close, please I’ll do anything you want if you just make me come!”
He startles when Steve manhandles him onto his hands and knees but feels no urge to protest at such a submissive position, which he knows should really bother him, but the heady scent of Steve’s musk leaves him breathless.  When Steve sheaths himself with one hard, thrust he cries out and with each subsequent, brutal thrust he feels himself shaking apart, there is no end to the fucking and knotting. His pleas for Steve to stop turn into wails for Steve to go harder and faster after his second knotting and third orgasm.
4.	Present yourself for daily maintenance discipline every morning, 20 swats of the paddle, followed by two strokes of the cane.
I will leave the paperwork for you to read and sign, get Jarvis to contact me if you have any questions, I will come back and collect it tomorrow.  Now I need to get going as I have a statement ready for the Press, Steve will keep you company and no doubt have a talk with you about your integration in to the Pack and what your role as the pack omega will entail.”
Tony couldn’t believe what he was hearing, what the hell had got into Steve, he would never have behaved like this before, there had to be something going on, perhaps he had been unknowingly drugged, it didn’t bear thinking about that Steve had been perfectly fine with fucking him and beating him without being influenced somehow.  Even Natasha had been acting strange, normally she just tolerated him and did her best to stay out of his way, Clint was the same, the two spies kept to themselves and only were around for missions and debriefs and Steve’s mandatory movie and dinner nights.  She had never physically abused him or made such nasty derogatory comments.
Which leads me on to the question you asked about bonding.  I would heavily suggest that Sargent Barnes bonds with your omega now, having two Alphas would mean he can feed from both of your cum as well as partaking the artificial feed and shakes.  It would also help Sargent Barnes bond with the pups and see them as his family as well, although I would advise on breeding your bitch again quickly so that he can sire some pups to satisfy his clam on your omega.
By the end of the official photoshoot she was reduced to her bra and trousers, which were unzipped showing the front of her lace thong.
He was almost grateful when the bell rang unexpectedly.
Master Sira, please proceed and if you would explain what the purpose of each piercing symbolises, I would be most grateful.”
Odin didn’t care for the omega, he found him pale and skinny, he fucked him because it was want needed to be done, but he chose words to inflict the maximum amount of pain and shame.
Her continued struggles and cries were starting to irritate him, he just wanted to fuck and enjoy his new omega without having to listen to her protests. Pushing her slightly forward he felt across the base of her neck for the small bundle of soft nerves that calmed omegas, pissed that he was unable to find it through the thick lengths of wavy hair. Gathering the mass of hair in one hand he picked up the discarded knife, sawing through the strands at the nape of her neck, uncaring that the sharp blade could slice in to her skin, finally he was left holding at least 15 inches of her long blond curls.  Unconcerned by her distressed cries when he threw them on the bed in front of her he massaged the now clearly showing soft lump of nerves, pressing down hard to release waves of calming pheromones which had Darcy melting against him, head lolling on his shoulder as she smiled softly up at him.
Captain/Alpha Rogers in his opinion would only tolerate sharing the omega with him due to the residual bond but he was incapable of allowing the omega to fully service to the rest of the Avengers pack.  Such short sightedness would not have been tolerated by Hydra, widening the gene pool for breeding would have been seen a high priority where there was a pack of exceptionally strong Alphas.
What caused this breakdown and subsequent tantrum?  think carefully before you answer, l want you to tell me the truth, and don’t think that you can be silent and not answer, that is the same as lying and carries the same consequences.”
2.	Never lie to Sir or Daddy.
This is rough and probably full of mistakes as my mac book has died ( grey screen and red apple of doom!) and I am using my old really slow lap top.
“KOTEHOK, time to wake up, Clint will eat all the honey cake if you stay asleep much longer.”
It was all his fault, if only he wasn’t such a colossal fuck up, he needed to find Steve and beg him to forgive him, to punish him for being such a bad boy.
Tony just wants an orgasm.
And how could he go back to that life now he was bonded and pregnant, what would happen to his pup due to the stress of a broken bond? Was there a chance he could miss-carry? There was no guarantee the Steve would step up and provide a temporary bond until the pup was born and what would happen if he never wanted a permanent bond with him. He would be alone with a pup to raise, on top of all the other pressures he faced every day.  He was so confused, he just wanted everything to stop and not have to deal with anything.
“Good soldier, now why don’t you return the favour, then we can collect Tony and you can fuck your bitch and show them what they are missing.”
Greedy lips sucked him down as a clever tongue swirled around the head and along the thick length as he slid down the breeder’s throat.  Gabbing a handful of dark curls he forced his knot past stretched lips, jerking his hips forward so that he could settle in behind her teeth.
The elevator doors closed leaving Winter staring at the small brunet omega standing in the middle of the lounge watching him with an extremely wary look on his face.
Tony whined as Steve withdrew until only the head of his cock was in his hole.  He hated how empty he felt.
“Tony you will be a wonderful mother, you are kind, caring, giving and oh so loving.  You will or be doing it on your own, l will be with you every step of the way and we will learn together.  We will have support from all of our Pack and just think how excited Pepper and Rhodey are going to be when you ask them to be God Parents.”
He turned the cameras on in the bedroom, it was one of his pleasures, watching Steve and Tony.  Gave him such an advantage when dealing with Steve.
“Bad Daisy cow, wasting your food, Hulk will just have to feed you once we have finished playing, lots of bottles of special milkshake to make you big and fat ready to birth pups.”
Tony opened his lips and let his Alpha begin to feed him, forcing himself to swallow each mouthful trying not to chock on the congealing mush which had gone cold, the blueberries provided the only flavour. The bowl seemed never ending even when he moaned he was full Steve kept feeding him, massaging his bloated stomach to make room for more of the disgusting mush.
Tony crept into the nursery in the early hours of the morning, leaving his Alphas asleep, May, had two of the girls latched on and feeding, Maria was fast asleep in her crib, the boys cuddled together in two baby nests.  The two sets of twins were inseparable and cried if not within bodily contact of their sibling, Tony, gently kissed all his babies, before slipping back out to re-join his Alphas.
Chapter 29
Once the new Laws were in place Steve needed to ensure that Tony behaved and acted the part of the perfect submissive omega when in public, unbecoming behaviour could only be blamed on pregnancy hormones a finite amount of times.  As one of the Elite Alphas and a major proponent of Pack Law and Omega Registration he would be expected to attend all major Political and Society events with his omega over the next few months.
“Such a responsive little thing, aren’t you?  Just look how dirty you have made my fingers with your slut juice.  Do you want me to stick my fingers up your tight snatch and fuck you until you squirt?”
Therefore, a decision has been made for Paraphilic, infantilism Conditioning Therapy as the correct course of treatment in your situation.  I understand that you and Captain Rogers have indulged in mild forms of age play with a submissive sexual element  in the past but you found it difficult to let go your adult mind set, here at the Centre we will provide you with the mental and physical techniques to find your little mind set and to explore all aspects of what that might entail for you in your relationship with Captain Rogers.
The force of the slap to his face rattled his teeth, he tried to speak out, to get Bucky to snap out of his mania, but one glare was all it took to silence him.
Pepper walked in, head held high, eyes only on Steve, she wasn’t going to show any of these arseholes how nervous she really was.  She would get through this with grace and poise, show everyone that she deserved her position and could adapt for the good of the Company.
“So?” Steve turns his head towards Bucky, his breaths heavy and sweat rolling down his face.
“Are you out of your goddamn mind?” “-oh come on you two have been pining for
Bucky flips himself, now lying on his back. Making Steve have to deal with an upside down face.
“That’s just delusional, Pep.”
I mean, sure.
At this point, he’s come to the conclusion that the prince is the most boring person ever. Literally, ever.
to ask Carol out on a date already.” Rhodey gives Tony a questioning look, as if to ask if he’s out of his mind.
“Since now, apparently,”
“The prince will pick you up here, and there’ll be a few photographers to welcome you and the presence of the prince. After that, we head to Kensington where you’ll stay for the rest of the trip. It’s a rest day, Steve. The action begins tomorrow,” Steve is glad, but he’s also nervous as to what to come. First, prince Tony(?) is picking him up, so he’ll have to face him the moment he lands. Great.
we’ve actually won- there’s nothing else, Tony. And it’s all because of you- but you can’t-“ Rhodey stops, trying to collect himself.
“Rogers, just the man I was looking for”
- Tony called it. And have fun he did, how could he not after winning his Wimbledon debut as an unseeded player. The world of tennis will never be the same, words spoken by John McEnroe as he sees the young man lift his Wimbledon trophy.
Rogers?”
“Who?”
“I don’t condemn it, boys are boys, pro tennis players or not.” Jarvis continues- “Now then, I assume you and the good Mr. Rogers traded contacts?”
“Well, good luck Stevie. God bless the king, and god bless america.”
Save me to your contacts :(
have those arms. Those really big and strong arms.
“m’kay but cuddles” Tony says softly, eyes tired and slowly dropping again.
“What about a night in instead? Order us some takeout and we’ll binge the Merlin tv show,” what Tony wants, Tony gets has always been a big hole in his resolve. Maybe they can do the whole dinner and walk in the park thing back in New York.
“I don’t know Steve, entertain me.”
Tony stands on one side of the court, and Steve on the other. “Maybe we could go up to a hundred without dropping? We’d start over every time it drops.”
Waking up the next morning, Steve has a large desire to explore. He runs towards the town, picking up some ingredients in the local market. Tony would appreciate a nice breakfast. Steve admits that he’s not proficient in Italian, in fact it’s probably the opposite. He just doesn’t really understand it, well at least not a lot of words. Knowing latin though, is something he finds really useful in the path of trying to understand what the locals are saying. So he greets some of them the best he can.
Loki continued his slow measured thrusts, lifting the omega’s leg he reached under to grab hold of Stark’s soft cock tugging on the PA piercing in time with his thrusts.  Eventually he was rewarded with a few dribbles of sweet smelling cum as the omega tried to fuck himself back onto his long cock.
“Steve, physically Tony is healing at a faster rate than one would expect, l have run some tests and done a full body scan, as I suspected he has been given a version of extremis that enhances the healing factor, but without the strength enhancement or temperature problems.   In fact, he has lost a high percentage of muscle mass and he is physically weaker than before.  Further tests show that this is irreversible, their world is obviously much further advanced in the exploration of genome modification. His bone strength and flexibility of joints has also been altered, he is incredibly supple, so you will not have to be concerned about restraining your strength when being physical with him.
Tony is a spoilt, selfish brat who needs to be disciplined regularly and have a strict routine so that he knows his place in the structure of your family.
He revelled in the knowledge that no other man would possess the body underneath him again, his hands tightened around Stark’s wrists at the thought of all those men.  Stark had been such a slut in the past sleeping around and not caring about the awful reputation he was gaining as the greatest Omega Slut of modern times.
The milking bench conformed to his body shape, supporting his hips and stomach, leaving his small breasts hanging, the handler fitted the suction cups and pushed the heads of the dildos into his two holes.  There was no reason to strap him down, he could not escape the pressure of his nipples being milked or the fullness of the dildos fucking his holes. For twenty minutes he enjoyed he high of multiple orgasms then his juices dried up and his nipples began to throb.
Dr Bruce Banner Head of Medical and Science, Mr Clint Barton Head of Security, Prince Thor is our consultant on all things Alien, Phil Coulson and Maria Hill will oversee Research and Development, it will take two to keep those idiots scientists and engineers from blowing themselves up.  Ms Natasha Romanov Executive Board member, who will also delegate for yourself when you are unavailable.  You know the other members so there is no need to go over their positions.
“Such a stubby baby cock with its shiny ring, never going to be able to stick that in anything ever again.  When we breed you again it will get even smaller, then it really would be just a big juicy clit.
“Please, as if our mighty Alpha could force me to mate and get an unwilling omega to consent!”
He picked the omega up and placed him on the old wooden table, it was sturdy enough to take his weight and he could rope his feet  and wrists to the table legs,  he had found a dented enamel pie dish under the sink that was sufficient for catching the milk in. A tin mug placed strategically under his sex caught any cunt juice that dropped out.
Pepper shudders as she realises what this means for her, she will be Steve’s Beta, it hadn’t occurred to her that he would know that part of Pack Law.  It was an antiquated law rarely used or know about in this modern era, how the hell had he discovered it.
Steve watched as the omega curled up on the tiles sobbing as water continued to batter his trembling body.
“Beautiful, just beautiful doll, such a whore for your Alphas, we are going to knot you day and night, filling you with our cum, and when your next heat hits in three months we are going to leave you writhing until you come crawling to us, begging us to knot you and breed you.”
Drawing a shaky breath Tony forced out the words he knew his Alpha wanted to hear.
“Peter are you going to be my perfect omega and take my knot as many times as I give it to you tonight without making any fuss, keeping quiet and still for me? If you can do that for this first knotting it, I will allow you to come as many times as you want if you can achieve this for me.”
The car drive to the Compound tested all her remaining patience, she could feel the few minute particles of active extremis heating her body.
Thor you are our Consultant Adviser for all things Alien, as a consultant you have the flexibility to travel between Earth and Asgard when needed and are not tied to Stark Industries, so there will be little conflict of interest.
Having been escorted to Dr Gottlieb’s office he sipped on his coffee as he waited for Tony’s doctor to arrive.  The office was decorated in muted creams and browns, all the seating soft leather, the book cases filled with hide bound books, one wall hung with many photos which he presumed were of clients that had successfully passed through the Centre.  The huge glass floor to ceiling window gave a expansive view of the grounds, the whole set up exuded a feeling of calm and tranquillity immediately putting him further at ease after the stress releasing car journey.
Chapter 57
He had cried himself out and begged for forgiveness, which Sir and Daddy had given, but it was not going to stop any of his punishments.
This had been going on for two weeks and she could see that her weight was increasing, but the morning sickness was still stopping her from piling on the pounds like her Alpha wanted.  Needless to say he was not happy and had contacted Dr Banner again, who was coming with the Avengers Pack tomorrow, apparently with an alternative solution.
How am l supposed to trust you, if you disobey the rules? How could you have lied to me for the last two days, knowing how worried and upset l was about what happened.
It was the simple collar that finally bought home to Tony that even though he was wearing an expensive item of bespoke clothing bedecked in millions of dollars of jewels, he was nothing more than an Omega Slave bound too and owned by his Alpha Master.
I know I am damaged and not worthy of being your mate but I think a full bond is the only thing that will lay the Winter Soldier to rest and break the conditioning word sequence.”
Steve was please that his omega was making no objection to being bottle fed, his contrary omega no doubt would again at some stage argue and need to be reprimanded but Steve was determined that his omega not have any autonomy in looking after himself with regard to his personal needs, that he would be completely reliant on his Alpha.
Goodbye my love, one day we will be together again but for now our paths must part, I cannot live in the past or else I will go insane, it is far different future that I am facing but I need to make the best of it and live my life. ’
Steve tore through the crowd of reporters not caring who he hurt or what equipment he trashed, he needed to get inside and find Bruce, Bruce would know what to do, he would sort out this mess and make it all go away.  The other Alpha had been a good advisor to him over the past two years and had provided him with comfort and solace when he needed a break.
Tony had moved to a different work station when he looked back up and was now focusing on the new Stark Phone and Tablet.  Pepper had been adamant that he still be head of R&D and the face of Stark Industries.   Whilst she would run the company Tony was still the creative genius behind the majority of all products produced.  Steve just had to sign off on all major decisions and contract over a certain amount of money.  Other than that and making sure that Tony would appear with him at the quarterly board meetings he left the running of the Company to Pepper.  He might own Stark Industries through his Omega but had no interest in running it.
“There we go, back with us now, see how good your Alphas can be to you when you just obey.  You are here for our pleasure, you don’t get to demand attention or orgasms, your body is for us to use and do with as we see fit.  Any orgasm we allow is a privilege you have to earn, after today you will not be allowed to orgasm until after the pups are born and only then if you have behaved in an exemplary fashion up until the birth and beg us prettily to bestow such a gift on such unworthy holes.”
The building itself is still standing, but shattered glass still litters the floor near the entryway, hinting at signs of looting and violence. There are dried puddles of what is probably blood spotting the marble floor amongst heaps of rubble from cracked and battered columns.
He'd strike up a fire now, but he's wary of the light it would exude, even though he's stationed himself deep into the woods in order to avoid detection by a zombie. He's not sure if these woods were ever ripe hunting grounds, but he knows that zombies usually return to the places they most often frequented when they were human. He snickers, imagining a robust, ruddy-cheeked man in a hunting cap lurching out of the woods towards him. What a way to go – not in a burst of glory as he had always imagined, but assaulted in the middle of a forest by a guy who used to shoot deer for fun.
Tony finally relents, scrubbing the dirt and metallic scent from his fingers before reaching out to take the lasagna.  "Th'nks," he mumbles thickly around a mouthful of food.
"I don't know," Tony says, his voice a little strained.  He comes over to Steve but hovers there, like he's afraid to move any closer.  "I'm serious. I don't know. I just saw it and I thought, why not? I couldn't focus.  I kept thinking about things. I have to
In the end, that is the first major bump, although Steve didn't know that then.  He forgets to come down to see Tony, and goes to the gym and draws and eats lunch and dinner with Clint and Natasha instead, and it's only by the time they've finished up that he remembers he never went to see his lover.  Boyfriend? They've never really found the need to talk about what they are.
Steve is not gay or even bisexual, he knows this well, but maybe the universe will always make exceptions for Tony Stark.
He's almost there - almost at that gaze, those brown eyes in that human face that seem so goddamn real, so familiar, so - when the pain in his side flares suddenly and he gags on it, the rolls of it.
Steve could
He thought he was over it by now.  Ultron made his heart shake, his hands quiver, his tongue lodge in his throat when he looked at Tony - but he thought he was finally relearning how to love those brown eyes, and that quick mouth, and those sure hands.
"Tony," he says as soon as he gets into the penthouse.  "Tony." Louder.
Tony considers removing the knife from the guy's chest, but ultimately decides to leave it where it is. Without direct entry into an open wound, the chances of contracting the disease aren't so high, but he'd feel pretty stupid if he turned just because he didn't clean the blade properly.
"Don't move, Rogers," a voice purred from nearby, and Steve's fingers stuttered on the trigger of his gun even though he could've easily spun around and shot the other man within the blink of an eye.  He knew that voice, and it wasn't Clint's.
In the Before, he'd never given much thought to his privilege. He'd fucked whom he wanted to, he'd party when he wanted to, he'd go anywhere he wanted to, all without sparing a glance towards the chaos left in his wake. He lived life on the very edge, pushing himself to his physical limits all the time. He'd take benzos and drink; he'd take opioids and drink; he'd mix stims together and go on drug binges and working binges and sometimes both at the same time.
JARVIS isn't helpful in the technical sense; he contains all of the information that existed before the Internet went out, but knowing about the ingredients in coffee or when George Washington's birthday is isn't nearly as important as it used to be. JARVIS can't even track his location without a satellite connection; Tony's had to rely on his pitifully lacking knowledge of United States geography and a good old fashioned map. The AI's data is, however, stored on separate servers housed in the mansion at home, and unless the newfangled energy device Tony invented powers out, JARVIS stays with him.
thing – last year, and he had eventually installed the "JARVIS, you up?" catchphrase into the AI's servers as his activation sequence. JARVIS's response is all himself, though, none of Tony's influence involved.
"Yeah, about that," Tony says. "How long was I out for, exactly?"
is sticking up for him. He knows that Clint has a point, and he feels rather guilty about coming on as an extra, needy body – hell, he's not even sure if he'd opine differently in Clint's position – but it is kind of nice to have other people watching out for him. To not have to be alone.
"Call us, or come talk to us, if you need anythin'," Bucky says seriously.  "I mean, knock first though.  Sam likes to have fun in the middle of the livin' room."
Steve thinks.  "You seem withdrawn lately.  What's botherin' you?  I want to help.  You're still my best friend, Stevie."
"About what?" he said, and felt a little unsteady.
"Steve," Tony says and it sounds like he's digging his hands into his chest to pull the words out.  "I'm sorry, oh God, I'm sorry."
He spots a Rite Aid nearby, and decides to check it out. He ran out of medical supplies last week in a fruitless attempt to bandage a scraped knee, and while he's never been big on safety – hell, he built his first-ever robot while drunk – he's taken more care with cuts and bruises since the apocalypse began. According to the news headlines that had run for months before dwindling out, the zombie disease is only effective insofar as it's transmitted via open wounds. That's why most zombies tend to bite their victims once they get close enough – it's quick, easy, and effectively transfers germs.
"Okay, good.  Was getting a little worried you'd faint or something there."  Tony gestured at Steve's glowing red vest.  "Your face was almost bright as that.  Let me guess, Captain America doesn't really have time for sexual activities, huh?  Too busy saving the world and all that?"
When Tony enters the kitchen, he's startled to see that not only is there
"You were having a hard time?" Clint says,
and someone to come home
Tony takes a second to scan his surroundings. He hasn't given much thought to what he'd do when he arrived here, having only been focused on the actual getting-there part first. Now, though, he feels a little lost.
Here's the thing about Steve: he grew up during the Great Depression, with a father who drank and beat his mother.  And then he drove a plane into the ice and woke up seventy years in the future, only to realize he had nobody left.
this time.  He looks at Steve with large brown eyes, the eyes Steve fell in love with.  "I meant what I said, about it helping me concentrate. I just had a little."
To her credit, Natasha doesn't even twitch at hearing her words repeated back to her. Instead, she shrugs. "We know who you are. We know what you've done. I didn't think you were worth it, but Steve doesn't believe in abandoning someone who could be saved."
He opens his mouth to respond but only blood comes out.  He's blinking, blinking, blinking the sweat from his eyes and it gets in them anyway, and he writhes on the ground a little, and the voice is cursing and pressing something to his side.  He wants to say
"It's...it's not that," Steve said awkwardly, feeling his face heat up again.  "I have someone in mind...it's just...he's not interested."
They've never directly talked about it before, but Tony must be aware of how much Steve hates it when Tony drinks.
"Well,
he curses himself.
Last year, Steve would've taken the other man's words as maliciously making fun of him, but now, Tony's teasing was only endearing.  Although it made his face just turn redder.
This, at least, is true – he would like to thank Steve, maybe find a way to repay him. Quite frankly, he's extremely lucky that these strangers had recognized his face and still opted to help him. Not many people would be willing to spare their resources on a rich, spoiled brat.
"I...it was all just a part of the game."
He leaves Clint and Nat to themselves and stops momentarily by the kitchen, packing up a plate of still-warm lasagna and a glass of milk to bring down for Tony.  Tony likes milk, which is a simple fact but yet something that not many people know about the engineer. When he's not drinking coffee, or boozing around, he's drinking milk, and Steve finds it incredibly endearing.
The stranger raises an eyebrow, clearly very unimpressed. "How are you feeling?"
"Good."  Steve closes his eyes.
"I'm great."
Unfortunately, that also meant that Tony wouldn't be coming after him this time - there would be no need.  Of course, maybe Tony still didn't know that Clint was the one with the flag; but based on the loud, high-pitched shout of "TASHA, COME GET IT" his teammate had let out only minutes before that helpfully let the whole arena know which of Team Blue had the flag, it wasn't likely.
"Hi," Tony murmurs, turning his head so that his smile is pressed to Steve's.
"Yeah," Tony says softly, carefully skirting around the nurse as he exits out the door.  "Sleep well, Steve."
Steve, I have deadlines.  You guys don't but I do. If I want to drink a little just to calm myself down, then why shouldn't I?"
The rest of the afternoon passes nicely, and it's only when blue skies start to meld into evening that Bucky and Sam finally stand from their seats on the couch and bid Steve a good night. "Take care of yourself, man," Sam says kindly, "and remember, you're always welcome to stay at the apartment."
And through all that stupidity, through all that recklessness and toying with his fragile life like it was a puppet on a string, he somehow survived. And even though he'd been kicked out and blown up and attacked by zombies, he is here yet again, alive.
Then they have a battle and it is Doombots, and it is easy, and Steve can fight them with one hand.  Iron Man and Captain America fall back into their easy routine, although Iron Man is a lot less chatty on the comms than usual.  Captain America does not question it - they are soldiers, they fight. They have time for conversation later.
Tony has become a ghost.
"Um," he says, clearing his throat. "Hi."
The supersoldier turned away and hefted his rifle onto the rack with a little more force than was necessary, purposely not looking at Natasha.  He could feel her eyes burning into his shoulder blades though, almost accusatory.  What did she expect him to do anyway?  Stark - Tony - probably went around kissing people for distractions all the time.  The kiss might've been special to him - and, yeah, the best thing he'd ever felt in his life - but that didn't mean Tony felt the same way.
He thinks maybe he sees a comforting brown gaze above him, watery and wide, but he can't quite discern what it is.
"Just enjoying myself," Tony replied, his mouth brushing Steve's ear, and
"Tony, I," Steve begins.
Natasha used to say when they argued (back when they were actual friends).
Tony's eyes finally lift to meet his, and when they do, Steve's taken aback by how empty they are.  "Okay," he says slowly, cupping the coffee mug to his chest. "See you later, Steve."
"What's your idea, J?"
And then there's someone like Steve, who had known who Tony was when he spotted him and still refused to let him go.
Tony shivers. There's something so eerie about this place, just like there was about the Rite Aid and all the other abandoned places he's visited during his three-month hike across the country. The stillness, the quiet where there used to be noise, unnerves him.
Clint looks up at him, the set of his mouth hard and angry. "I said, you're treating the outbreak like it's a joke. You and all the other rich folks, holed up in your gated communities and guarded homes while people like us are out here dying and fighting for our lives. So, what, you decided to come out here just to live like the rest of us for a day? Saw your first zombie and freaked out and decided to blow up the block?"
Steve's demeanor changes, the warmth slipping away to be replaced by something more analytical. A thinking face. "A lot of zombies were drawn to Stark's blast," he says. His words lack an accusatory tone, but Tony's face burns red in shame. "The city's crawling with zombies from the next county over. But, for now, we're safe. They're mostly coming from the west and staying there."
Steve chuckles, and it feels good to even if there's a little twinge in his heart at seeing them so comfortable, his first friend from this century and his best friend.
He didn't even know why he was here again.  First of all, the arena was way overpriced, and secondly, the pizza tasted like feet.  Honestly, Natasha was the only Avenger who actually enjoyed laser tag.  He still couldn't believe the red-haired assassin had managed to cajole the rest of the team (minus Bruce and Thor) to play yet another game.
Tony shrugs. "Natasha mentioned his name. Apparently he's the guy I owe for saving my life."
"I like Matisse," Steve responds, his voice lilting up at the end like he's asking a question. "Um, off the top of my head, also Kandinsky and Basquiat."
Half an hour later, Tony blinks himself awake slowly, and Steve loves it - the slow awareness, the lazy flutter of lashes.  "Good morning," he whispers. The skin of Tony's neck is hot against his mouth.
In the early months they wake up in each other's arms every morning and it is lazy and warm and beautiful.  Steve cracks open his eyes on Saturdays and there's Tony, softer and smaller somehow in sleep, curled up against Steve's chest with his hair all tufty and his mouth slightly open.  Steve runs his hand through the thick locks, treasuring the way Tony mumbles inaudibly as he's wont to do at any affectionate touch, and marvels at how this man - this kind, intelligent, brave, amazing man - is all his.
“ JARVIS please put in an order for a large comfortable sofa  leather I think, it will be easier to keep clean and also some pillows and throws.  Please ensure that the kitchen be stocked with the appropriate food and drinks if Tony has to stay down here for an extended period of time.”
Pepper’s hair was a vivid orange, the short spikes glistening with a frosted gel.  Her dark lined eyes had frosted orange lids and under eye, the thick coating of brown lipstick made her lips look full and plump.
Natasha was truly fearful now, they were absolutely, serious, they didn’t even seem concerned that she knew where Steve and the omega were.
“Come on little meg don’t be shy you stink of arousal and need. Let go and give in to your nature, why fight it?  You are my bonded omega and l own every part of you, there is no shame in embracing your base nature, now come for me again slut. You will come on my command until l decide you have had enough, and you will thank me after each orgasm.”
Tony. The other man tried to say reassuringly.
His voice sounded like a child’s.
But point is, Steve listened. He listened to Tony’s continuous blabbing about his robots; the other man was fascinated with them, said he’d never heard of anything so bright.
The fond smile on his face when he spoke about the people he loved. The firm way he used his hands when he was hugging someone and the warm and welcoming aura that was always around him.
Steve was positively beaming as he gently placed his hand on Tony’s chin so he could look directly into his eyes.
“How come you’re not inside?” Steve said deliberately avoiding Tony’s question.
“I know.” he said softly.
“Oh you know me, I’ll find something.” Steve replied with an amused smile, his mind reeling with all the possibilities.
He abruptly stopped and said “FRIDAY, be a dear and close up the coordinates. Delete all the data of the location research.”
He took his hand off the handle, removed his sunglasses instead and placed them on the pocket of his suit; he didn’t want to seem cold or arrogant.
and all the ones they didn’t get to say.
Tony felt more sober at his words, but this time in a good way. He closed his eyes to savor the feeling.
“Do you know who cares about fourth place? Fucking no one, that’s who. No one gives a fuck about the fourth person that landed on the moon.” the older man huffed bitterly.
Steve replies with a fierce stubbornness.
“I never got to tell her goodbye.” Bucky said, his voice breaking and tears collecting in his otherwise serious eyes.
“Everything alright, Cap?” he asked softly, not wanting to startle him. As if he could ever scare a super soldier.
Clint, who was by his side even when he had retired.
For Tony it was highly unusual to have someone that actually cared for him and not his money and wanted to help him, so it did take him a while to trust Rhodey, but he was glad he did in the end.
He replied placatingly.
Because after all he’s been through, after everything that happened, after all the pain and the loss, the earth will still keeps turning.
“Usually once every summer, ‘till I turned 15 and started MIT. I used to meet up with my cousins and play around the village. The natives say it’s enchanted.”
“Tony..” Steve whispered. “I hope I’m not reading into this wrong, but may I kiss you?
Steve huffed in amusement, which also caused him to hiss in pain.
Point is, he still has people here. People, who love him and even if they may not need him as their leader anymore, they want him there as a friend and that’s all that matters.
His voice sounded pained.
His eyes were focused on the old sketchbook in his hands. “I thought I had lost it when I woke up after the ice.” his voice trembled. He turned the yellowish pages and saw his old drawings.
Howard saw his scared look and laughed out loud, his voice ringing louder probably due to the three bottles of whiskey he had downed the past afternoon.
Steve smiled softly even though the other man couldn’t see him.
When his anger had ceased, he realized what an asshole he had been. Screaming to Steve that he’s dead? As if it didn’t already pain him? He understood why his friend wouldn’t want him to know he’s not alive. Especially not at thirteen, when they met.
“Then why did you call me?” the genius, true to his title, asked pointedly.
That’s when he realized that tears were streaming down his face uncontrollably now and that two small arms had engulfed him in a hug.
Backstreets back!! I’m sorry for taking a whole year to post again but 2020 was a pretty hard year:’) Anyways, I thought it was sad I had completed this fic and never posted it and tbh I’m kind of proud of it so here we are! Big thank you to Rue for helping me with the science talk, ily<3
Ten seconds later the door opened and Steve walked in to find the engineer sitting on a stool, staring blankly at a piece of machinery that looked like widow’s bites.
The other voice said softly.
Angst! But also they talk??
He said and suddenly he felt sober again. He tried to reach for a bottle of tequila on his left, but it was too far away and he didn’t want to get up. He didn’t think he could get up at this point.
“So, I’m gonna leave you to it.” She said and promptly left when she didn’t receive an answer.
“The serum kept him alive for 70 years.” Tony cut him off in awe.
“Tony..” he said nervously. The smaller man just hummed for him to continue, his sole focus on the sight before him.
Tony didn’t need to be told a second time before he ran to his bedroom upstairs. He closed the door and fell on his knees, his back against it.
He almost didn’t notice Bucky coming up next to him, but only almost, thanks to the super soldier serum.
The genius shook his head,
“Tony..” Steve said exasperated, but before he could even move the other man had already left the room. He took some deep breaths and headed out of the lab as well. He walked towards the elevator.
Tony clenched his fists and closed his eyes tightly to cease himself from shaking.
While the call connected, he picked up the pocket knife again and went back to work.
“Why do I feel you left a meeting to take the call?” Steve remarked while picking the knife up and making his wound a little deeper.
He looked around at all the bottles he had consumed. He barked out a bitter laugh; like father, like son.
“Well, there will always be bad guys out there, but you shouldn’t worry ‘cause there will also be good guys to fight them every time.” he replied.
He knew that Tony had designed the Captain’s floor in a way that would remind him of his past; it was warmer, homey with a wall full of old newspapers and photographs. Whereas the engineer’s apartment was more impersonal and practical. Steve knew for a fact that his bedroom looked brand-new every time he saw it. That was mostly due to the fact that Tony didn’t spend much time on his floor, mostly staying at his workshop or the communal floor.
None of them spoke for a moment.
“No need to go to Nick for this one, I’ll guide you to the Captain.” she said as she walked towards the elevators.
Hi my quarantined fellas, I hope y’all are doing great! These chapters are more then resolving their issues than anything, because I wanna base their relationship on trust and honesty yk?
It all started during one night when Steve had a rather bad nightmare. Tony found him covered in blankets shivering on the common-room's couch, even though it was like 82 degrees outside.
“Everything’s okay, stop worrying, you mother hen.” he said jokingly and heard the blond huff in amusement.
He would have known if he was. It would be all over the news. Although, he didn’t have much time to check news reports while on the run-
From a viewers point, their first dance probably didn’t seem ideal.
Maybe he’s not, but he’s not dead.
“We are getting married tomorrow.” he said.
“I think I’ll manage, honeypot.” he chuckled and ended the call.
He thought of the feeling cruising the skies gave him; he felt free.
“Do you still get nightmares about this? About what you saw in the wormhole? I know you used to.” Steve asked carefully.
he sounded so pained Tony would have felt guilty, had he not been overcome by emotion.
“Great” Steve replied nervously and headed for the elevator with Tony on his tail.
The elevator ride was quiet, a nervous energy very prominent in the confined space. When they reached Tony’s floor, the two men went straight for the couch and sat there silently looking at each other for a few moments.
“I don’t think that void in my heart he left when he died is ever going to heal. I can’t believe he really is gone.” he said with his mind replaying all the events of the fight.
Steve once again laid Tony on his back, spreading his legs wide so that he could kneel between them and admire the view.
Standing as one they helped their omega to his feet, leading him from the doctor’s office by his bound tits.
Quickly she shed her blazer and skirt, making a show of folding them neatly on the empty chair.  Her silk blouse followed, leaving her standing in the ivory lace bra and thong the dresser had informed her she needed to wear.  Closing her eyes she hooked her fingers in the sides of the thong pulling it down over her slender hips and thighs, let it fall to the floor before stepping away from the scrap of lace.
“I think there is probably some rule about using the Heli carrier for making personal house calls.”
Her harsh laugh and dismissal of his offering still gave him nightmares, she had told him in no uncertain words that she would fuck him and fully bond him only when he had earned it an not before, so he was left with a partially empty feeling in his chest that hurt more and more each day.  Ms Potts worked him hard but had treated him well, but after his escape attempt, she had been furious and had withheld any touch or affirmation from herself as a punishment for his behaviour for two weeks.  By the end of that time he had been a crying, begging wreck, who had sworn to do anything to allow him back into her good graces.
The custom collar he has designed and commissioned will be delivered tomorrow, ready for his collaring before the Pack, Pepper and Rhodey.
(See the end of the chapter for
Any way I am going to find Happy and remind myself how lucky I am to have a good sweet obedient omega.”
“Little golden omega, you are forever bound to return to Asgard, Thor and I, you will live many millennia and birth at thousand sons and daughters.   You will ensure that Asgard, and its descendants hold the highest place in all the Universes.”
Now whilst we wait for Captain Rogers to arrive, I think since I could not attend the second part of your initiation it is only fair that I get to put my dick in your fucked out holes.”
Winter straddled the end of the recliner leaning forward to get a good view of the omega’s exposed pussy.
“I know little omega, Loki realises this as well, but will try her utmost to make it happen as she doesn’t want to be pussy whipped.
Can’t do anything more for him without your permission.
As Loki stepped forward, he felt a slight tug on clasp of his shift, the red chiffon floated to the floor at his feet, leaving him fully naked for all to see.
Steve was going to make him work beg for it there was no way that he was going to make this easy for Tony.
Steve covered his omega’s back with his body smushing Tony’s face into the pillows biting down hard on his omega’s bonding mark as he painted his omega’s ass with his cum.  Rolling them onto their sides he continued to suck as his cock pulsed out its copious load.  Pulling Tony tight against his chest he whispered;
Winter and Steve wiped cum coated cocks over May’s flushed face, sneering as the slut’s tongue chased the strands of cum still leaking from their cockheads.  Each roughly grabbed hold of a milk swollen breast, fingers digging into the fleshy mounds as they locked on with their lips, drinking their fill of the sweet tasting milk.  Steve bit now on the chaffed swollen nipple, chuckling at the ragged scream coming from the cow, Winter followed his lead as they chewed and worried the abused teats, cocks thickening as May’s agonized screams filled the room.
“No Pup!  Head up, eyes open, you will not hide, these people deserve to see you as you truly should look, instead of behind your fake persona of a human billionaire.”
Steve ordered Hawkeye to fly direct to the tower, informing Fury that they would hold the debrief would have to wait and mission reports would be filed at a later date. Needless to say the director was not happy and made it known with some choice language.
“Omega go service your pack, put those cock sucking lips to good use, then lay over the spanking bench so that they can all take their turn disciplining you, this will happen every day until you have caught up with all your missed  Omega Council authorised punishment sessions.”
“I hate you Thor, how could you let Odin take my magic, isn’t it enough that you turn me in to your whore, a breeding bitch, forced to care for and feed your bastards.  Couldn’t you have left me just one piece of myself, I will never forgive you or Odin, I want both of you dead and will not stop until you both are dead at my feet.”
Stark’s experiments on Extremis was further ahead than his own, he could see that they had bothered found a way for it to lay dormant, or to be partially active in a healing capacity. That’s what this Pepper had in her system, physically and mentally she was more resilient, but without the strength or burning heat.
Bruce and Steve discuss Tony, a plan is put into action.
Nodding to the awaiting make -up artist he departs for his own dressing room to put on his dress uniform.  He had given clear instructions as to how he wanted his omega to look and was content to leave him for this part.
Steve watched the inner circle of his Pack, whilst his omega wrapped their  lips round his cock and began to suck him.  They were all in attendance watching the new Hound mount and breed Peter who was moaning and gasping as his cunt clenched on Apollo’s cock.  Natasha and Clint were teasing Vision and Wanda, wanting to know when there would be a mini Vision.  The pair had returned after an extended stay at Kamar-Taj where Wanda had trained to gain control of her magic.  Vision had trained in ways to stop Wanda if she ever went rogue, not that Wanda knew that.  Vision was completely loyal to him but Wanda had already show once that she would switch sides if it meant she would not die.
smart," Tony says, eyebrows raised. He's a little starstruck to be honest – I mean,
"Perfect!"  Tony clapped his hands together.  "Glad you think so.  Is the pasta ready yet?"
"You're not sorry."  Steve lowers his voice.  He can't look at him - look at Tony.  "You're not
should know how people get when they drink, Howard was an asshole too, wasn't he?"
Steve blinks, and then clears his throat. "Oh, yes. I still have to...check in about…." He seems to lose himself for a moment. Tony waits, patiently – he gets this kind of reaction a lot. "See you later, Stark."
"So," Tony says, a sharpness entering his voice like a toothpick, "how did you mean it, then?"
The lights flickered on around him, but Steve couldn't care less.  Tony began to pull away, but Steve wrapped one arm around the shorter man's back and tugged him back to his chest, drawing a surprised "Mm!" from him.
It is not like after Ultron.  It is far worse than Ultron.
"Oh," he says lamely.  "Well. That's good."
There's a sudden noise, like the snap of a twig underfoot, and Tony jerks around, his hand already closing around the grip of his handgun. He flicks the safety off with a smooth swipe of his thumb.
He no longer knows where they stand.
Tony cleans the rest of his plate while Rhodes and Thor get into a debate about the significance of the brass rat, and about whether it's appropriate to call it a necklace. As he scrapes the rim of his plate with his fork, his breastbone suddenly spasms with a sharp stinging sensation and he hunches over, trying to be discreet as he clutches at his chest. Trying to breathe back the pain, he almost misses the way Steve glances to his chest and then up at his face and back again, expression dark in what almost looks like misery.
Tony raises an eyebrow at Clint. He has to physically shake his head a little to jolt himself out of his reverie – Bruce's work is always so fascinating. "He's an absolute genius. He has three PhDs and he's only twenty four. Even I only have one doctorate."
"Um…" Tony glances down again. "Just dandy. Thanks for asking."
"I was having some trouble with containing Compton scattering," Bruce admits. "Before the apocalypse, that is."
At first he thinks Tony might be confused about it.  The engineer has begun sneaking him looks during movie nights and team meals and a couple of times, Steve has noticed that Tony will begin reaching for his hand only to pull back.
Tony clucked and said eagerly, "Don't worry, Cap.  Girls would kill to have you.  I'll set you up with someone.  I have tons of names you might be interested in."
"It doesn't," Steve muttered, and took a bite of his roast-beef-and-jack.  "And I don't.  Why would you ever - ?"
"That's because the serum heightened your senses," Tony says, but his frown is directed at the lasagna.  "I swear, Steve, only a little. That's it."
Your senses are better than that."  The laser tag had been a small game, just Tony and Clint versus Steve and Natasha.  Thor was off in Asgard for some royal meetings and Bruce was working on a charity project in Bangalore.
in nostalgia, in regret.
When December comes around, Tony hosts the annual Maria Stark Foundation Charity Gala and he catches Steve in the hallway, tentatively offering him a card.  "I know we're not, really," he says quietly, almost helplessly. "But - if you want to go - I got you an invitation. You can bring friends too, if you want."
Hands grip around his ankle and tug, and Tony trips, jaw slamming into the counter. He sees stars as he goes down, and, fuck, he is
"I have no idea what's going on here," Clint interrupts. "Bruce, I didn't know you were this famous."
For the next month, Tony is on good behavior.  He works hard but remembers to get enough sleep, to eat food and drink water and come up for movie nights.  Clint and Natasha slowly wind their anger down and start to include him again, so for a while, everything seems okay.
"Well," Tony says, drawing the word out.  "What am I supposed to think?"
Of course, it's a little uncomfortable when they go out and they have to stop holding hands, or when a reporter comes up to him and Tony and asks whether either of them are in a relationship.  Tony's always been good at deflecting so that's what he does, just makes a jokey self-deprecating quip that involves Ms. Potts, but Steve's never been able to work a crowd as well. So instead, he blushes and looks down and says, "I left my last love when I went into the ice."  See, the reporters love a juicy bit of tragedy, but even they have enough decency to leave him alone after that. Then he and Tony can get back to being with each other again, even if Tony's eyes are always a bit harder to read after questions like that.
“Nooo, no, no, not again! Please don’t let me do this again, what’s the matter with me, why is this happening? Please someone help me!”
Steve appeared boxes and bags in hand throwing them down on the bed he motioned for Tony to sit down.  First came the toe rings slim bands of platinum inset with diamonds, then the black leather thong omega sandals bare of any decorations so as not to draw the eye away from the sparkling jewellery.
His cock reared as he took in the cunt lips locked together and the exposed ringed clit stretched to lock against the first ring. His fingers itched to pinch the swollen flesh, to yank hard on the rings and hear the exotic creature scream, he didn’t care if it was in pleasure or pain.
Tony desperately wanted to disobey and run for the door, but Steve had used his alpha voice, not at full strength but enough that internally he struggled, whilst his body reacted and obeyed his order.
Sita smiled as she paraded a naked and well used Loki through the palace to the medical wing where Thor and the healers were waiting.
Tony’s lips trembled and his eyes welled up.
Tony is a creative genius with a unique way of viewing the world and needs freedom to express and create in his own way, the need to conform and perform as Tony Stark, is one of the main causes of his mental and physical breakdowns.
Chapter 8
With one gland reclaimed he, pulled out and sank into the sweet warmth of Tony’s pussy, sighing as the omega’s cunt  massaged his length, his cock head hitting the moaning slut’s cervix. As his knot began to swell his barbs released, sinking into the waiting nodes. With a final thrust his knot caught and he ripped into Tony’s second gland, his soaking her cunt with cum.
The glass doors to her office opened for her and Dr Banner, without particularly looking she made a bee line for her ensuite, desperate to wash away the gross mess of cum, drying on her body.
Tony knew he had no choice but to obey, his rear end was throbbing with pain as his heels dug in to the tender flesh.  Taking a breath, he began to suck on the teat swallowing down the thick creamy liquid, his face burning red along with his butt. Slick dripped from his hole as Steve caressed his cheek praising him for his good behaviour.
Squeezing Tony’s thighs together for greater friction he thrusts back and forth leaving a trail of pre- cum along the length of his perineum ensuring he coats the small scar where his omega’s balls had been.
“Mmmm Daddy, m..mmore please.”
Clint let’s take Pepper back to my suite, we can have a bit of fun with her before we go meet up with Steve, He wants us in the command room for the mission briefing at 15.00.
“Certainly, Mr Graham, its Valentino £4500, nothing is too expensive if my sweetheart wants it.
Now spider will be awake and able to watch everything done in the mirror above, I have already pinned her eyelids so that she cannot close her eyes.  She will not feel any pain, just some tugging and pushing.  Now we are going to go from top to bottom, so firstly I am going to freeze he vocal cords so that she cannot speak, she will be able to make noises and scream, but no words.  Such a quick and simple procedure and voila! the first part of being human removed, now onto her breasts, we only want to keep the nipples so will inject fat burning enzymes that are specifically made to target breast tissue, its fast working so in about an hour her tits will have reduced and all that will be left will be her nipples which we will then inject with a drug that will make them larger and incredibly sensitive to any kind of stimulation.
Two hours later the two entered the waiting room, Steve could see the excitement in Bruce’s eyes and even Dr Cho had a small smile on her face.  Bruce was the first one to speak.
*******************************
“There we go baby boy, mio bel bambino can rest now, in the morning Aunty Pepper is bringing a friend to visit with you so you need to get a good night’s sleep.”
“Such a good boy for your Sir, Pepper is lucky to have you as her friend, next time you can to eat her out, so that she is not a slutty mess after the two of you have had your fun.”
Now Betty was compliant and submissive, following his every order immediately.  Professor Hulk had completed the modifications he had requested, so now his petite omega had large plump breasts and fat nipples, with a  fat clit peaking from a nest of dark curls. Her hips had been widened and her pert ass enlarged, her waist a mere 18 inches. Her hair was now cut in a utilitarian bob with bangs, after her pathetic begging and pleading for him not to cut her hair he had had the long plait made into a five tailed whip and took great enjoyment in inflicting pain on her, with her once pride and joy.
“You need to say it Tony I want to hear you say the words out loud so there can be no mistake, no going back, no argument with these two words you fully commit yourself.”
Why couldn’t our Stark have been an omega like this one, would have solved all our problems.”
Come on Pepper, prove to me that you are still alpha enough to fuck and knot an omega.  Show me that you are willing to perform this service for the good of the Pack, you will get a spa day to yourself if you succeed in getting Natty to drop the first one within the next hour.”
Steve watched his pups on the monitor hand on Tony’s belly, he felt great satisfaction and pride that his omega would bear him such large healthy pups. He was thrilled that he would be able to announce the news tonight and show off his beautiful pregnant omega for all the world to see, it would be the perfect occasion to celebrate and show that his decision to bond with Tony had been the right one.
Tony began to cry again, face buried against Steve’s thigh, beyond mortified at what had happened.  Steve would think he was disgusting and dirty, a stupid omega who couldn’t even hold his pee, he would never want him as his omega now, it wasn’t fair, why did everything bad have to happen to him. He loved Steve but there was no way he would ever love Tony now.
“Natasha, Portals are notoriously unstable and difficult to control, especially where the Infinity Stones are involved.  Dr Strange told me that there are thousands of alternative worlds, parallel universes and time streams.  Portals that have not been summoned and tied to a world or area within, do not appear again, that is why then are called Random Singular Portals.”
The two vibrainium rings that had been on display since their bonding were finally placed on his ring fingers, Tony felt a tingling sensation as they appeared to tightened.
Karl waited a few minutes before slipping into the stall, Winter didn’t stir at all as he dragged into the next stall and cuffed to medical table, ready for Vet.
Steve completely ignored his omega’s garbled pleas for him to cease and only stopped when Tony repeated pleas for him to stop turned into ones begging for forgiveness.
“Congratulations Alpha Rogers, all the pups have strong healthy heart beats and are a good size.  Omega Stark will need to be monitored carefully during his last trimester as the pups are going to be a large.  But for now just carry on as you have been.”
“Peter, Pepper will secure your bond when she is ready, there is nothing that you can do until she has reached her decision.  I have no doubt it is part of her strategy to keep you needy and eager, and for you to come crawling to her begging for her knot.  Even though she is an extremely strong Alpha, she work in an Alpha male dominated industry and needs to prove her strength at all times, this carries over to her treatment of male omegas, see will never show and weakness or be sensitive emotionally in your presence, it’s not in her to become too emotionally invested towards a male omega.
Know lean over the end of the bed I am going fuck your holes and fill them with my, cum before I plug you. Darcy screamed a he wrecked both her holes, his cock pounding into her with no care for comfort or pleasure, once he had shot his load in both holes he pushed in the largest plug in his collection, laughing as she begged him not to split her in half.
The days passed and he grew more resentful, BB was a useless cow, he bought the crop down on her tits, the stupid things were too small to produce much milk.  There had to be a way of getting them bigger, she had put on a little bit of weight but was still thin.
I want the straps round his udders to be slowly tightened until we have a circumference of between 10 to 15 inches at the base, depending on how big his udders grow.
Winter and Steve grinned at each other, pleased that their omega would be tied to the milking machine, made it so much easier to fuck and play with their bitch.  Jarvis would silently monitor Tony’s and the pups’ vitals, only alerting them if either were in acute distress or signs of labour were imminent.  So far, their omega had followed the rules set for a traditional omega pregnancy and they were determined that the delivery would be the same, a natural birth in front of the pack with no external help or medical intervention unless the pups or their omega’s health was in danger.  Tony had to prove with this birthing that he was strong enough to fulfil his role of Omega Breeder to their War Pack.
“Ladies and gentlemen of the Press, thankyou for coming here today, I would like to present to you my new Omega mate Anthony Stark-Rogers.
Captain Rogers come take your omega.”
The President was hard pressed not to rip out Darcy’s plugs and fuck her against the mirror as he ran his hands over the soft blond bristles, but he needed to fit the Bridle first and then maybe he would have some more fun with his omega.
“Fucking bastard Alphas! What about me, when do I get to come? Or have you forgotten about me now you have a new omega to play with!”
“No..nooo..nooo stupid doors, what’s the matter with me? I should not be able to push open a stupid door, need to get out, need to find bean stalk…. Daddy could make eggs and beans. Tony like eggs, ohh I know I go find kitchen, eggs and ham……
Tony was mortified that Steve had just casually announced to Happy that he had wet himself, it was humiliating enough that Steve knew just casually accepted it.
Tony’s thighs are burning as he tries to maintain his position, the weight of Steve’s hand on his shoulder ensures he cannot rise, Bucky is now squeezing both his breasts tightly his large hands kneading and pinching full mounds leaving dark finger marks on his abused flesh.  Bucky pulls on his tits roughly causing him to fall forward off Steve’s fingers onto his hands and knees, exposing his dripping pussy and quivering asshole.  Steve wastes no time in sheathing his cock in Tony’s pussy, setting a brutal pace.
Allowing their omega’s upper half to fall back on to the bed, they each pinch a thick nipple between their fingers tugging rhythmically until milk begins to spill coating their fingers and Tony’s breasts.  Shuddering through their second orgasm they feed milk soaked fingers in to the slack open lips of their dazed omega.
Right, she just needed to keep calm and go with the plan, this didn’t mean that all was lost, it was probably just a precaution until they could question her.  Taking if a steadying breath she called out for a nurse, what she got though was Dr Banner and the Widow.
Now I would like for you to respond and be honest in your answers, because there is no going back on what is agreed here today. If you do so you will suffer the consequences and I can assure you that I will not be so accommodating again, so think very carefully.”
Steve watched as Tony’s tongue darted out to lick the last dribble of cum from his huge purple mushroom headed cock, globs of cum dripping down his cheeks.  His omega had woken him as he sucked down his cock, tongue dipping in to his slit when he pulled back just suckling on the head as if it were a tasty lollipop.  Tony’s cheeks were flushed as his eyes stared hungrily up at him as he when to town on his cock.
Tony wanted to vomit up the disgusting concoction but forced himself to swallow down the remaining half bottle, shuddering as it settled heavily in his already full stomach.  Tired and sore all he wanted was to sleep, to erase the memory of him sinking so low as to moo on command for his Alphas, so that he could fill his dark need to debase himself for the pleasure of his Alphas.
“Don’t fret May Cow, you will soon both be fulfilling your new purpose in life, you should be thankful that this is your punishment and that you both have not been sent to an Omega Registry Correctional Breeding & Milking Facility to serve out your sentences. The pair of you would have received much harsher treatment than what will happen here in the service of the Avengers Pack.
3. Minimal make up that can be applied quickly.  Day time the natural look, night- time high class slut.
Tony is on his knees greedily swallowing Steve’s cum, his own cock is throbbing as he licks the last drop off the fat mushroom head.  He knows that their will be no relief for him until they are leave the Gala.  It is exciting and risky this game that they play, Steve initiates each encounter and Tony never refuses to sink to his knees no matter the danger of being caught in such a compromising position.
“Sleep tight baby boy, tomorrow is another big day for you.”  Kissing him gently he bade good night to Nurse Mayer’s replacement before retiring to his suite for the night.
“Sweetheart you are so pretty laid before me, your soft thighs coated with slick and your hole loose and ready to take my cock.”
The other man asked curiously.
That’s also what Steve cooked for him, roughly, a year later. He had visibly improved his skills, but Tony would eat anything his boyfriend made for him anyway.
“Mister Stark.”
They never actually apologized for the insults they spat at each other in the hellicarrier, although Steve did try to talk to him about it once or twice.
The only thing they hadn’t done at that point was to go dancing. Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t disappointed, but he respected his boyfriend’s wish. He just wished
“Any-anything” Steve managed to rasp out. “Anything you want. I always loved listening to you talk.”
The genius came back carrying a simple cardboard box with a red, white and blue bow on it. He sat on the couch with his body turned towards the captain and before giving him the box he said “So, I went to SHIELD’s storage room and I found something I think you would like to have”
He couldn’t hear any response for some moments. He feared Steve had broken the connection.
Deep down, though, Steve knows he’s being unfair. Because he may have lost two important people to him, but he still has so many left.
He didn’t like to beat around the bush.
“I know.” Tony sighed. “Ugh I have been fine, I suppose. Remember that guy, Ty?”
“Okay.” she said nodding and took the hand Steve offered when he got up from the grass.
If Sam noticed the open flip phone next to Steve’s head when he found him in the morning, he didn’t mention it.
Great, he already managed to ruin his friend’s mood. That was quick.
He said as a matter-of-fact.
Tony felt a little brave when he said “Well, you never know, maybe we’ll do that again someday. Better than any kind of therapy.” His good mood prevailed after all.
And then Natasha, beautiful strong willed Natasha with a heart bigger than she let people see. She gave without taking and had become one of his closest friends in this century. His heart ached with the loss of the two people he loved very dearly, each one in a different way.
But instead he said “If I remember correctly, you’re half Italian, so maybe you can help me with that last one.”
“Well, it’s never too late” Tony replied with a small smile.
“I was trapped in the ice and around me I could see everyone I lost. My mum, Peggy, The Howling Commandos, Bucky, Erskine, Howard. But I couldn’t do anything because I was trapped and it was cold, so cold.” Steve mumbled.
“That’s amazing,
His gaze slid to the little girl whose hand was holding his leg,
“Two days ago he woke up and due to unfortunate events he panicked and almost ran away.” He said somewhat sorrowfully.
He unlocked his front door and took a bee line to the kitchen. The moment he arrived, he noticed his favorite butler, scratch that, his favorite relative at this point, cutting carrots for the meal he was preparing.
He fake argued.
Tony looked around him instinctively.
and I just feel so sure I’m still in the 40s, it burns like acid when I realize I’m not. I’m not ungrateful, I’m really not. It’s just- Everything was so much simpler back then. Or... maybe it wasn’t. But we only had one goal in our minds; ‘to end the war’ and now... now everything’s more complicated.” he continued with a sigh.
. You would do anything for your family and you’re always there for us. Loving you came so easily, Shellhead. Once we became friends, I realized what a generous, loving person you are. I understood that there is a lot more to you than what meets the eye and I wanted to get to know the real you. And you let me. You lowered your walls, but you also helped me to lower mine. You gave me a reason to love the future. You didn’t give me a home, Tony, you are my home. So, will you make me the happiest fella in this universe, probably multiverse according to your theories, and marry me?” he finally said, his hand trembling with anticipation.
His hair was a mess, his unkempt beard very prominent. At that moment, looking at his tear stained cheeks and red eyes, he realized he had been crying the whole time.
He replied gently.
He just didn’t want to be rejected by America’s hero, that’s all. During the whole ride his foot couldn’t stop shaking.
“Steve?” His head was buzzing from confusion. How was Steve alive, he died in World War 2. Steve is Captain Ame-ohh okay so many more things do make sense then.
I’m sorry if there are so plot holes aboit locations and stuff, I’m so messy at this kind of stuff.
To be honest I don’t like Extremis per say but it was the only way for everything to make sense. I used my knowledge on it but I may have made some mistakes. I am not really gonna explore into it though.
Steve’s words were trembling.
Steve had removed the bullet at that point in time and was patching up the wounded skin with two stitches. He didn’t even really need them, as it would heal fast enough, but he wanted Tony to keep talking for as long as possible.
“I’m afraid your access has been denied, Captain.” Steve got up from the spot he had been sitting on for the last 40 minutes, with his back against the lab’s glass wall.
He nodded to himself and finally turned the handle and opened the door.
“You know, when I saw her for the first time in this century, she told me she had moved on. She talked about her husband and her grandchildren. Told me it’s time for me to move on as well. If I go back to her now, I’m depriving another version of her of the future that she should have, and that’s not fair.”
“Oh...” he muttered disappointed. Then how could he talk to Steve?
As he was walking he felt a presence next to him.
he suggested.
With his mind made up, he just stared at the peaceful lake. His focus drifted back to the memories with Tony, to all the things they said to each other
But it’s her manners. You see, I got all my, as you would call them,
“Well, I finally finished my first PhD and I just applied for my second, so I’ll see where that takes me. I brought home many of the SI designs I’ve been working on and I’ll probably have them finished by-“
There was a comfortable silence between the two men after Steve finished his little speech. Finally, Bucky let a gleeful smile form on his face.
“Well, I happened to spend my last 20 years listening to a technological genius.”
Tony replied frustrated.
“I’m afraid he says it’s urgent. My systems have been overridden.”
That seemed to flip the switch, because the brunette immediately started blabbing.
Tony looked at the door and took a deep breath, trying to calm his heartbeat. He place his hand on the handle and abruptly stopped before opening the door.
he said somewhat awkwardly.
At night, he laid on the bed of his childhood room, placed his hands behind his head and concentrated on one certain person he hadn’t talked to for far too long.
The other man admitted.
He had been depressed.
He hit his head on the desk behind him and closed his eyes.
Tony felt like the worst person in the world.
Her childish logic did make some sense, though. When he had come to this century, he had felt lost. His friends, his past, everything had been ripped away from him. He didn’t know who he was, what the actual purpose of his life was at that point.
The night before the wedding day, they had slept separately, because Steve insisted that they should follow the tradition and not see each other before their wedding. Tony called him old fashioned, but followed his words. The genius stayed in a mansion his mother owned in the region with Rhodey and Pepper, while Steve and most of the guests stayed in a hotel nearby.
I’m really bad at writing action so I’m sorry in advance if anything doesn’t make sense.
Even though the question came out of the blue, Steve didn’t comment on it.
“You would actually call 4 am ‘morning’? Wow Tony, that’s some character development right there.” he replied wittily.
“Does he think that or do you think that?” He asked pointedly.
But he couldn’t. His mind
The butler looked at him a tad confused. “I’m afraid not, Sir.”
Tony nodded. “I am sorry, too. I only knew you from my father’s stories. I should have given you a chance to get to know you, Cap.” he said.
One thing he loved about Steve is that when he asked about something, he was truly interested to know the answer.
Tony hummed in question.
From downstairs he could hear his parents shouting at each other.
Tony fretted.
Tony huffed out a bitter laugh. “He definitely wasn’t, he... you would have hated him. He was... quite manipulative. It was hard for me to gather the courage to break up with him, but Steve helped me.”
“There's so many investors trying to make small-talk. It gets tiring.” he replied nonchalantly.
“Oh captain sasspants is back.” Tony chuckled.
Steve finally looked at Tony, the sad look back in his eyes. “I would rather stay here for a little bit more.” he replied and turned his head up to the night sky again.
“God, I miss those movies nights.” he continued without giving it much thought.
Big thanks to sasha (@/legendstony on insta) for being an awesome beta <3
He intently thought back to what she said about his decision to going back. Of course, she didn’t know all the facts and wouldn’t have been able to understand half of it anyway, even being a Stark.
“Wasn’t thinking about running, no.” he chuckled. “Come on, follow me.” he said while moving towards the exit of the lab.
He didn’t even notice when the tears cane back.
Nine months and twenty four days. Five minutes since Tony had gotten back home.
He could volunteer, teach drawing to the elderly, help in dog adoption centers. He hadn’t even thought there were so many possibilities before deciding to go back to the past. His mind had been clouded with grief, a sharp pain that wouldn’t dissipate from his gut.
“Sometimes, I wake up and I think
“Hey, Morgan?” he asked softly. She turned her head upwards to be able to look him in the eyes.
“Anthony... look at me.” Jarvis said and Tony opened his eyes a couple of seconds later and looked at the man that was more family than his actual parents at that point.
Tony could hear a smile in his voice.
“But-“ she pouted.
“I-I was just too busy studying for my exams that I didn’t have any time to prepare for my quantum mechanics contest. I-“ Tony took a sharp breath and tried to stop his lips from trembling.
“Having fun?” he asked with a smile.
He would give him advice when needed and let him rant about his father.
, not one. Like, we had a marathon. Rewatched all the Star Wars movies ‘cause he hadn‘t seen the prequels. I know, that‘s unacceptable! Even
“Well, were you?”
Steve wiped them away, his big hands a contrast to her small face. His heart ached for the young girl. She only got to spend five years with her dad before the universe stole him away from her.
He looked beside him and saw a brunette, blue eyes, presumably in her thirties, with a sharp look in her face.
“Did you come here often as a kid?”
“Is everything okay?” he continued warily and that seemed to grab Tony‘s attention.
Steve teased.
Tony asked hesitantly.
“Yeah, everything’s fine.” Steve said while trying to stifle his yawn.
“I’ll take that as a yes. I bet you’re standing in front of the elevator right now.”
he thought.
“Will you tell where we’re going?” Tony asked when they walked in the elevator.
“Shellhead..” Steve said warily.
manners from her and sometimes I will do or say something and just get reminded that she used to act that way as well.” the captain replied with the fondness of an old memory.
“Every day. You see, my ma died in the 30s, so there should have been plenty of time for me to heal, but in reality it only feels like a little more than a decade has passed. I can’t say I really see things around that remind me of her, the world has changed a little too much on that front.
“Tony...” the Butler cut him off. “I’m not your father. You know I’m always more than willing to listen to your work progress, but you know what I’m asking about.”
“So... will you do me the honor?” He held out his hand to Tony to prompt him to get up.
(See the end of the chapter for
She extended her arm for a handshake. “Maria Hill, Fury’s right hand.”
“That’s-that’s why i don’t really like movies about the war, the past. The melancholy comes back to me at full force. You know, Sam helps me with this kind of stuff, being a PTSD counselor and everything. But, to be honest, I preferred when my therapy was watching space movies with you on the communal floor.” he whispered that last phrase.
Steve loved Tony’s Italian background. Not only because of the sweet melodies he would sing to the blond, but also from the excitement he got when he went to Italian restaurants or when he cooked a traditional dish himself. Steve did know some Italian from his time in Europe, but every time Tony spoke the language, he was absolutely gone for the guy.
but he can just train the new Avengers for the most part.
“You’re alive? You’re Captain America?” he had to make sure.
“I get nightmares that I accidentally killed you.You know, when I hit your arc reactor with my shield. That you are dead and it’s all my fault. That your blood is on my hands. I killed you. I did that. I-“ Tony could hear Steve clearly hyperventilating.
That is, also, why they chose to get married in Italy. They thought it would be better to have an outdoor wedding in Sirmione, a breathtaking region and they only invited their close friends.
He was not scared.
“Well, you should definitely try the local dishes. Get yourself a pizza. Or maybe some Italian sausage.” Tony teased and expected Steve to blush furiously and say ‘Tony’ in a stern voice.
He couldn’t help the tears that spilled as he tried to say how sorry he was.
Tony is prepared for the Celebration Gala by his Alphas.
Less than a year ago she had been CEO of Stark Industries, powerful and dominant, now she was nothing more than the  Avengers whore, and Stark Industries sexual favour for visiting clients.  She craved Natasha’s attention and approval, would do anything for a smile or kind word from her. She had learnt the hard way to bend for Steve and to never answer back, she prayed that they would get his omega back so her punishment at his hands would end.
“Soon you will be Hulk’s and that will be permanent.”
We all must do our part to ensure our country rises to the forefront of the world and leads the way into a greater future for mankind.”
Bruce carried on with his examination, even though he could hear the omega’s quiet sobs and feel her body trembling as he inserted the ultrasound wand.  She would need to get used to these examinations as they would be happening every week throughout the fertility treatment and insemination and the following months of her surrogacy until the Pack’s pups were birthed.
He couldn’t see the screen for the ultrasound or the internal examination, but he was aware that the vet was pleased with the results.
“ That’s it baby just breathe, my best girls right where they should be, safe in my arms.
“Thank you, Bruce, that’s great news, I was never comfortable with Jarvis have full autonomy, but Stark was a stubborn bastard and it was the one thing I could never get him to bend on.”
Luke quickly hid his phone and carried on setting up the lights for the shoot, the moment he could escape he was going to edit and upload onto You Tube, subscription only of course, then sit back and watch the money roll in.
“Hello Pepper, Father and I have a wonderful evening planned for you, Happy is kindly letting us look after you for the night, you didn’t really think a slutty cumdump would be going to the Maria Stark Foundation Gala.
Pepper you need to fuck Natty’s asshole, the stimulation of your knot will increase the pressure on her cunt to contract and loosen.
Chapter 25
It is interesting to see how different readers interpret things and how seriously they feel about certain aspects.
He couldn’t stand her hysterical weeping so shoved his cock into her month, sighing in relief when his knot popped and all he could hear were her panicked wheezes, he shot his load when her eyes dimmed and the smell of piss reached his nose.
Natasha responded.
Go spend some time with your boy, get a feel for where he is at and what you want for him going forward.  It would be ideal for his treatment that you have a positive mind set and have decided what previous behaviors he has retained you want to reinforce and any new ones that will satisfy your desires and requirements.
The five minutes seem more like five hours, before he feels his Alpha remove the considerably smaller bar of soap from his mouth, he doesn’t think of him as Steve in this moment, not with the sense of power and dominance he can feel exuding from him.  He rinses and spits as directed, not complaining when the glass of water is taken away to quickly for him to have removed all the disgusting suds from his mouth.  There is a sense of anticipation in the room, no one is moving or speaking, he feels all their eyes upon him, waiting for what he is not sure, he just wants to curl up and cry and forget about his stupid outburst.
“Yes, it’s true.”
Tony startled on hearing Steve’s voice, he couldn’t believe that had been duped into thinking it was Steve fucking him, as soon as Bruce’s hand left his mouth he drew breath ready to let them both know how pissed he was, but before he even got his first word out his mouth was full of Steve’s cock.
“Come on Jarvis, want to fuck your omega creator? bet you would like to fill me up and make me scream, get me back for all the times I have over ridden your protocols, been reckless and endangered myself and gone against your advice.”
He’d had his suspicions from the moment he was woken, no one had ordered him to service them at breakfast, he had been given his kibble and told to hurry up and eat.  Afterwards he had been thoroughly scrubbed and cleaned inside an out, before being strapped to the fucking bench, with the dildo teasing his hole until slick was pouring down his thighs.
“No, it was not a traditional birth or pregnancy as we were all worried how he would cope due to the arc reactor, so he had help and the midwife supervised the delivery.  Still swore like a banshee and I had to discipline him once he had recovered.”
Steve petted his omega’s soft curls, the cropped hair having finally grown out, so that he could get a firm hold of it if needed. Yes, he had hit the jackpot with this Tony, and with a few minor tweaks he would be perfect.
Strapping him to the spanking bench, she proceeded to paddle his ass until it was cherry red, and he was screaming and begging for her to forgive him.  Paying no heed, she moved on to the flogger, starting on his shoulder and moving down his back to his ass and thighs, only stopping when his sobbing ceased and Happy nodded to her from his kneeling position in front Peter’s head.
“Dad you drive, Pepper and l are going to get reacquainted, it’s time for this slut to start performing her sisterly duties.”
After he had plugged her holes and hosed her down with cold water to shock her out of her stupor, he made her crawl back up to the nursery, tits and belly swaying beneath her. Once he had fitted her feeding gag, he turned on the flow of high calorie feed, setting the timer for an hour. The Nanny bought in two of the new pups, helping them latch on, May, sank back against the cushions whimpering as the tiny mouths sucked on her tender teats, through the pain she held the pups tight against her breasts her omega instincts crying out to feed and protect the vulnerable pups.
Just then the door to his office flew open and Tony came rushing in.
You will need to be aware that the next few weeks are going to be extremely difficult for you, both physically and mentally.  It is going to take time for your body to heal and for your hormones to reach an even balance, once you reach a healthy weight your first heat will hit.
“Looks clear, let’s get down there and set up the beacon, we only have twenty minutes.  I hope that Natasha makes it and has the Stark Omega if he is still alive.  Do you know anything about him?”
“Stevie please don’t let them take me away, I don’t think I will be able to survive if they start to experiment on me, you know they will Stevie they will not think twice about doing it to get all Hydras secrets.  Please Stevie there has to be away to stop them.”
To the Alphas she was no longer human, just a breeding bitch, the hounds showed no interest in her once they had finished fucking her.  Mistress treated her with contempt whenever she deigned to show any interest in her, cruelly taunting her with her superior skills as a Black Widow.  She knew deep down that if she ever got to fight her, she would lose and that scared her, she had always assumed that she was the best and had never had to prove herself.
“Ahhhhhhh, Ahhhhhh!  Please, please Alpha!”
“Look at yourself Tony look at how wanton and debauched you are, such a dirty omega bitch stuffed full of cum and still begging for more.  You just cannot get enough, if I let you come what will I get in return?
Inch by agonizing inch his hole was stretched and filled, the pain had him orgasming continuously, his poor little cock was dry, every time the monster touched it, he screamed, the skin beyond sensitive.   Finally, he felt the alien’s balls slap against his behind, looking along the length of his body could see the bulge of the monster cock invading his stomach.  What followed had him floating on a cloud of bliss, the monster didn’t care about anything but pounding his cunt, his body being shoved repeatedly up the bed until he was hanging off the mattress, hands held his head as another cock was fed into his mouth cutting off his screams. His world narrowed to the cocks fucking both his holes, the burn and stretch, the agonizing drag of the beast’s cock across his prostrate, his throat filled with the captain’s cock, gasping for breath and pleading with his eyes for some relief.  None was given, each orgasm sank him further into a state of bliss, his body and mind floating.  He was vaguely aware of swallowing thick strands of cum, followed by the roar of the monster and warmth flooding his insides.
Stripping off his suite jacket and tie he watched as Darcy came crawling into the bedroom to present herself at his feet, lips touching his shoes.
Chuckling at Tony’s words he settled on the sofa pushing the teat into Tony’s mouth, whilst rubbing circles on his distended stomach, he could feel the solid length of his cock through Tony’s soft flesh.  It was obscene how large it looked buried deep inside the smaller man, thrusting upwards he gripped his little one’s hips holding him still, the empty bottle of milk thrown to the side.
I thought it best as we don’t know all the traumatic events that Tony has been through yet, but is obvious that his sex drive has been dramatically increased and he is going to need constant sexual stimulation.”
Come now, it is time for your appointment with Dr Gottlieb.  Captain Rogers can assist you to walk as it is only a few doors down to his office, you need to start exercising your leg muscles as you have been in bed for the last three days.”
Short chapter today, but I have started on the next one already.
Steve quickly slid a sound in to place locking it against the piercing before fitting a small weight to the ring as well.   Steve pulled down on the weight, both Alphas laughing as their omega squirmed and moaned, hips thrusting forward at each tug.
I am going to stay at the tower with Sarah and try and get my life back on track, there is decisions to be made about Stark Industries and Iron Man that only l can make.”
Settling down with their pizzas and cans of soda they clicked on a film, both still smiling at the news the doctor had given them.
“Daaaaa, Daaaa, mmh mmmh”
He twisted so that he was sitting on the stool, holding Tony above his cock, wild eyes looking straight into his calm ones.
“I’m s…so sorry Alpha, p..please I didn’t mean to hurt Aunt May, I thought I was doing the right thing, I can s..see n..now that I was wrong, please I want to be a good omega for you, p..please let me stay.”
After his fourth orgasm, he could do nothing but slide against the cum and slick smeared glass, limbs trembling as his over sensitive cock plumped up one more,  Steve’s tongue lapping at his bleeding mating mark, rekindling his arousal even as his body screamed out in exhaustion.
“This is the on of the best out come we could have wished for, other than Tony having been a wolf pet.  This mixed breeding will produce pups that will have all the instincts and abilities of a wolf but with partial domesticity due to Tony’s Shiba genes.
Non consensual sexual acts and humiliation, don't read if its not your thing or you if you might find it triggering in any way.
“That’s what this switch is for, six should have her hole tight and ready to use again.
Darcy bowed her head as she slipped to her knees, hands shaking as she clasped them behind her back, showing any kind of submission to this bastard made her feel dirty and disgusting.
Steve continued to swipe up cum and feed it to his omega tugging on the enclosed metal cock enjoying the whines and gasps and jerks of his omega’s hips as he chased an orgasm that was never going to happen.
This chapter ran away with me so the dressing for the Gala and the events of the Gala will be in the next chapter.
Whilst Tony was having his first physiotherapy session Steve was called to a meeting with his doctor and psychologist for a report on Tony’s progress and what further treatment would be needed.
Bruce and Banner are carrying out their body augmentations at the moment. The pair are getting along very well and l think it is safe to say will be collaborating on many projects. Banner is deferential towards Bruce so there is no clash of alpha will.
Tony submitted to Steve’s brisk round of smacks, knowing that he thoroughly deserved his punishment, he would have to apologise to Bruce and Hulk, probably Clint as well now he thought about it. Perhaps Hulk would like his Jelly Beans oh, but he really wanted the ones that Happy had given him, maybe he could persuade Steve to allow him to buy a big barrel full of them for Hulk.
“BB you look beautiful, that gown shows how stunning your figure is, why don’t you drink your wine whilst I see to Darcy, the horny bitch needs a good fucking with a real Alpha dick, her toys just get her all riled up and ready for the real thing.”
Dr Banner l want you do do everything to ensure that she conforms to her new status.  I will not allow her any leeway she is representing both Packs and myself as CEO of this Company.
Tony begs and pleads with Steve and Winter to knot him, desperate to sate his hunger and clear his clouded mind, but both Alphas carried on doing as they want heedless of his pleas.
“l have work to hard and for too long to be dismissed and humiliated in this fashion.  I am going to have these brats and them l am finished with you perverted bastards
Tony’s face flushed, red eyes filling with tears at each brutal word spoken, yet the curl of want and need in his belly increased and his channel clenched hard around the plug, full but still achingly empty at the same time.
He could see that Tony was wavering between asking for more or pushing him away.  He needed Tony to want this and beg for it, then he could work on the omega until he didn’t desire anything but to mate, he needed Tony  to give his consent, so that he couldn’t argue he was forced.  There was nothing to say that a bit of gentle persuasion to get the result that he wanted wasn’t allowed.
Bucky and Steve let Tony have the full force of their rut, fucking their omega deep and hard, Bucky reached under Tony thrusting his metal fingers in to his still stretched cunt as Steve tugged hard on his nipples.  Tony came undone, his screams lost to his Primary Alpha’s knot filling his mouth, his pussy clenched and squeezed tightly around intrusive fingers whilst his asshole swallowed his Secondary Alpha’s knot.
Peter could feel the tears threatening to fall again, it was always the same each time he came.  He would begin awkwardly babbling the minute he saw his aunt, eyes darting all over the place, trying not to settle on her semi naked form.  His aunt would sigh and depending on whether she was gagged or not tell him he was not to blame and that it was all her fault for not realising his orientation and stopping him from falsifying his test results.
