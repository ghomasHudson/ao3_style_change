Peter's smile faded when Ben asked that, no matter how hard he tried, that memory would always stick with him. It was his birthday, and dad was taking too long to come to say goodnight, so he decided to get up and look for him. When he found him he was sitting on the piano, he never really played it or looked at it, and tonight was no exception. There was no music, just his dad looking at the keys, with the most heartbreaking look in his eyes. His dad had told him that he was fine, but even at a young age, Peter knew he was lying.
" You're nervous, a 10-year-old with a shaky hand and closed eyes, is cutting my hair, how do you think I feel?!"
He took his hand as they walked to the apartment."
The thought of food made Peter's stomach grumble, it was almost dinner time which gave Peter an idea. "Look, if it gets you guys off my back I'll prove that it isn't a big deal, when we head off to the mess hall, I'll say hi to him, I'll even talk to him."
"Really, not even the new ones?!"
Steve called for him, he walked back to the car when he noticed that his son was still inside.
Ben didn't notice that he had said "You" instead of him but thankfully his dad didn't notice either, he was more preoccupied with the tears pouring down his eyes, Ben then buried his face in his dad's chest as he comforted him.
"Listen, carefully kiddo, you did absolutely nothing wrong, your pops is just well... How do I put this... When it comes to these kinds of things, he can be a real... Knucklehead, especially when it comes to your other dad, but that ain't your fault"
Peter screamed as he got off Johnny's back.
His pops eat his fry and gently put an arm around him and brought him close.
" You're right, that would definitely make you the winner, except that, may I present with grate honor, a royal flush." Peter said showing off his perfect hand."Hope you like swimming."
"You have a point" Ben looked around the room, right now he happened to be sitting in the bathtub of Peter's bathroom for that very reason.
"It's a newfound love?" Peter tried to sound as convincing as possible "So dad, this is where you're going to paint now? His pop's looked around."Well after your aunt Tasha spent all this time helping me it would be rude not to".
"They were married three years, then divorce, he said it was because they were are away from each other, which I don't get if they don't like being apart why did they divorce? Grown-ups are weird".
"I'll be right back, I need to use the bathroom first!"
" like you should really see an eye doctor."
"Awesome!"
"You're new, aren't you?"
"I have been tricked into trying it, and my answer stays the same. What friend?"
"Thanks, Ben" he took it and answered it
Steve asked, studying his son's face before going back to his meal, Peter wished to know what he was thinking.
Peter soon turned around visually upset."Pops you can't call an exterminator, these are cobweb spiders, they're not dangerous, they're actually really helpful because they eat bugs and stuff, including mosquitos, and those are scientifically proven to be the absolute worst and...and it doesn't seem to be that many of them, and if you see one you can just put it outside".
"Your absolutely right, but how do you suggest we do that?"
"Like, telling them that we know the truth?".
"Speaking of promises..." Peter looked up at his dad with hopeful eyes, he had promised to take him to the studio and tell him more of the day he and his dad had met.
She handed them back to Peter
"It's the big yellow one, that is currently buried...under, all of this"
Sometimes he wished he did, have the last night he saw his mom, to be a peaceful memory, but that same night, as he sat at his desk trying to figure out what to say write to his husband, thinking that, in the morning, he would set it all right.Â  Then his phone rang, it all became numb, and it felt as his heart had stopped, the only thing louder than the million thoughts in his head, was the reporter's voice, which echoed through the apartment as he gathered his things to get to the hospital.
"Why not?"
"You sound so serious, but yeah apparently Howard introduce them. A few months later they got married, how about you?"
"Yeah, I live in Brooklyn," Ben matched his excitement, both happy to find a fellow New Yorker and that he, at last, was reunited with his luggage.
Peter was sniffling, but still wearing a giant smile that matched Ben's.
" Yeah, I guess have "
"I mean think about it, pops, I was at a new place for 4 weeks, with new experience, and now, I'm coming back. And it's like I'm coming back as someone new, you know?"
Happy was referring to the policy, they had in place. That encourages the kids to solve their problems in a civil matter, instead of calling their parents at the first sight of trouble, opting to use that as a last resort along with a zero technology policy.
As he said this the memory of last year summer came to mind, that night his pops' had left his tablet on the kitchen counter, and Ben had managed to sneak it into his room to watch a few videos past bedtime, he was sneaking out of his bedroom to put the tablet where he had found it. When he overheard a conversation that his Pops and Bucky, were having in the living room, that day he had been asking an unusual amount of questions about his other dad, and the result of that, was his dad was panicking, saying how everything was his fault, while his godfather was comforting him. Ben had never seen his dad so sad as he did now, he decided to go into his room before either of them spotted him, and to never ask questions about his dad, he didn't want to make his dad cry.
"Are you sure you're feeling all right, normally you're yapping my ear off, but you've been awfully quiet, and you haven't touched your ice cream which makes me think you might be dying?"
He, Ben and Danny, were all sitting on the floor outside the mess hall, along with a few kids. They were playing poker, Ben had a pile of goodies next to him, that he had won from the other kids, it ranged from Candy, potato chips, pocket change, and a few headbands and bracelets.
Luke smiled upon seeing the tag with Ben's name and address that hang from his duffle bag.
Peter frowned knowing exactly what was going on, after all, he had seen this scenario many times before with his dad and had to stop himself from frowning. But he did find it funny how his pops, who was the tallest and most muscular man he ever has ever seen was using his ten-year-old as a shield, by standing behind him and gripping his shoulder from a small woman blond woman.
Ben continues to cry into his dad's chest, he could feel his hand petting his hair. He pulled away and took off the plastic glasses and cleaned his eyes.
Luke notched Ben with his elbow as he saw Peter and his friends approaching them.
"What happened next, did you fall in love after that?"
"I'm holding you up to that promise"
He pointed at the drawing of Sam and Bucky, which were connected to each other by a red string. Indicating, that they were married, and their two drawings were connected to Steve's with blue strings, indicating friendship but Bucky's also had a green string, which meant family.
" would love to"
"...Alright"
"...Right, let's eat" He clapped his hands together and changed the subject as quickly as possible. Peter bit the inside of his cheek as he observed that last exchange
"These are...nice?" Maria held up the onesie in her hand as she got a better look, it was good quality but plain, like something you buy for a baby shower where you don't know the gender of the baby, or you aren't close with the parents.
Ben said as he looked outside and noticed the storm was gone.
Peter had spent the better part of the day walking in circles inside of the cabin trying to explain why
He was taken out of the conversation when he heard his aunt say "I'll look into it" followed by her making her way up the stairs
When Ben got out of the plane he started looking around but all he saw was a black car and a tall lean strawberry blond ,woman standing in front of it.
Peter wasn't sure if it was the way his pops was talking about his dad or that this was the first time he ever heard this story but he felt tears his eyes up
"Yeah, I'm fin-I'm okay, really"
"You both claim it was an accident, so how about you take off your helmets, apologize to each other, and shake hands?" The two boys were hesitant for a while. With Ben curling his fingers into Fist and Peter with his hands over his chest
"I love you too"
but neither Peter nor Ben couldn't bring themselves to care about the whispering going on behind them, they were still locked in eye contact. Peter lifted his hand, and so did Ben, giving a wave to each other. It was like looking in the mirror, with very few minor differences. The first one being their outfits Peter was wearing a white suit with a green chest while Ben's was all white, Peter's hair was long and floppy, and Ben had short hair, almost a buzz cut, and finally, Peter's cheeks were slightly chubbier than Ben's, but not by much.
Peter got on his knees and smiled widely at that.
"Sorry, got distracted, and speaking of that, would you mind helping?"
"Sorry, it's confidential".Bucky said with a wink.
Steve let out a chuckle.
"...I mean there's no need for that, I'll hold on to him, and later I'll see how I can get it back to him". Before Steve could say anything else Peter salvation came in the form of a knock
Ben had a smug look on his face as Peter pointed this out
Ben said putting down the picture and pulling his long-lost twin for a long hug.
Peter took what he wrote, then pinned it on the board under their parents picture it was a note that said:
"It means I'm just adding some color and working on the shadow work"
"That sounds werong when an adult says it."Peter teased.
"Hello, I see you brought along my favorite nephew with you"
"I'll do my best".
"You know I met your parents before they got divorced, some people say that how their relationship ended wasn't surprised, that they were too different, but that's not what I saw, in a strange way they were absolutely perfect for each other, and to be honest I've never seen your Pops happy as he was with your dad, not to mention making those two Knuckleheads finally faced each other and actually talk sounds like a dream come true"
Peter got up and walked behind his pops and continued to watch him.
"Knew it"
"Your welcome".
"Would you like to go again?"
Me: Okay I just posted the fifth chapter I already have rough notes for the 6th and 7th  chapters so I can easily get these done before the end of the month, what could possibly happen?
"Well, technically I'm the one with the glasses now".
"Don't lie, you loved it"
He stretched out his arm so Peter could take the photo.
"Hey, don't look at me, if anyone is to blame it's your dad and Pepper, you know how they get when it comes to your safety."
Peter said in an awkward voice before taking Johnny's hand, who was still shocked and ran in the opposite direction as fast as he could.
"What was that?"
While they picked up their stuff to leave, a shiny black car parked nearby. It stuck out like a sore thumb next to the busses. It reminded Ben of a movie, spy car. He made a small comment about wondering who would be in there, but his attention went back to his new friends as they walked to their cabin.
Steve smiled sadly still, his gaze still glued to the notebook.
"Here!"
"Going all in and blind. Sounds fun!"
"I'm your dad, I know when you hide things from me, you really think I wasn't going to notice?"
"No, he doesn't...what about Pops, what is he like?"
" Hey, four-eyes!"
"Ben, be careful up there!"
"You call it cheating, I call it teamwork."
Granted, they were bottle rockets, but that didn't sound as cool.
Taking advantage that his opponent was distracted Peter went in and poked the other kid in the chest. The counselor then grabbed his hand, as he blew on his whistle, lifted his arm, proclaiming him The Undefeated champion, the light-haired chaperone asked for another volunteer but nobody stepped forward.
"Wow!"
The poker match was almost as intense as the fencing duel, the crowd around them had grown even larger just like the pile of snacks and coins between them, had grown.
"Someone like him?"
"...um yeah but...You know things change, hey! Do you think that happens in Hogwarts? Like one day they call you into the headmaster's office and they're like oops we sorted you went to the wrong house or do you think that there's like a bunch of students who are asking to be in a different house...haha that be funny"
"Neither do I, despite how unusual and reckless this is, I wouldn't trade it for the world" Steve paused and stroke Tony's arm with his other hand "I love you more than anything and considering that you agreed to marry me I'm assuming you feel the same way"
"Wow!".
"If it isn't a big deal why did you skip canoeing yesterday?" Johnny question
" I'll take care of it don't worry, you know the plan right?".
"How about we start with a dance?"
He covered his mouth and shook his face he had a habit of doing that on the rare occasion when truly didn't want to try something, he wouldn't have guessed his brother would like that combination after he was the picky eater of the two.
"What?" Ben asked sounding drowsy.
"Ben, are you alright there, buddy?"
"Thanks for everything buck, tell Sam we said hi"
"Are you ready?"
"That's two against one, sorry Rogers, so who's the protagonist?".
Peter grabbed his backpack and emptied what was left in the pile.
"Very soon"
"I hope not...or maybe a little? we did goof around a lot and even played pranks on each other, a little less after we started dating, but we were never like in the movies we could spend an entire day just talking or even not talking, we didn't shout how much we were in love every five seconds but we had other ways of showing how much we cared"
Peter shrugged as he put a generous amount of syrup on his pancakes but didn't drown them as his pops asked.
"Here you go...Ben. You from New York?!"
"Your hair is shorter"
Peter said as he opened an Oreo and put peanut butter on top of the white cream filling
"So pops can't hear me, duh, or Do you want us to get caught?"
"Uncle Bucky?!".
Peter quickly grabbed his backpack and took out a packet of Oreos, and placed it next to the chips.
"I will!" He could hear his pops and aunt talking about budget and location, he pretty much ignored them and continued to look around, he took out his phone and did a quick double-take before he texted him.
"I'm sure but don't worry I'll keep an eye out, okay? "
Peter, Johnny, and Miles were heading back to the cabin. Somehow Peter had convinced Johnny to give him a piggyback on the way back, while Miles was throwing the basketball, he had in his hands up onto the air and catching it.
Danny joined in with Glee.
Inside the isolation cabin, the only sounds were heavy raindrops falling on the rooftop, along with the echoes of children screaming, as they tried to escape from the storm. In a blink of an eye, the silence was broken when one of the windows suddenly burst opened. The violent noise was nerve-shaking, the wind was so strong and unexpected, that it knocked the comic out of Peter's hands, along with the tin container, that had all of the pictures that he had brought with him, to the ground.
Pepper's smile dimmed down.
Ben nodded once more, he walked past his dad to his desk, where the albums were, he also noticed a double photo frame, one side had an old photo of a man who kinda looked like his dad, with a small kid that looked to be around the age of eight, they were both wearing goggles, sitting on a motorcycle, on the other side was a picture of his dad and Peter, his brother also looked to be eight in the photo, they were sitting in a go-kart, there clothing and faces were stained by motor oil but unlike the other picture their smile seemed genuine and they were looking at each other instead of the camera.
"How did you meet?"
"Our options are an arcade or park."
"Can I get a reminder of how I got wrapped into this?"
"That very funny Ben"
"What's wrong with me, what's wrong with you, you pushed me?" The other boy replied with the same anger. Splashing him in return.
"These are pretty good, I'm glad I let you put that extra portion of chocolate chips?"
"Ben, would you mind helping me? I don't want to revisit the ground," he asked, rubbing the back of his neck.
He hung up and looked back at him.
"My dear boy, how I've missed you." He pulled Ben into a hug without hesitation but he didn't mind, on the contrary, he embraced it
Johnny asked in shock.
" I know kiddo, but I really think your dad should be the one who tells you all those stories, and he will you just need to--"
Peter said with an excited tone holding his camera close to him, his dad always joked that despite having the option of choosing any camera he wanted, he chose the one that was older than him,
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh...okay".
"Yeah, it was super freaky".
"Are you sure, I don't think you're going to like it?"
Ben caught himself smiling as he watched his dad. Maybe it wouldn't be too hard.
" I was moving stuff around, your closet isn't exactly the most comfortable spot in the world"
"I had lots of fun, tho"
"Well, that's why one day I'm going to be referring to uncle Bucky as my first husband! He yelled that last part so Bucky could hear it clearly, which caused his godfather to laugh even louder. He kneeled down to meet Peter's eye level and gave him the biggest, brightest smile in the world, his uncle Sam radiated this kindness to him, that made him reciprocated that same gesture, he could see why his uncle would marry him and why his pops would consider him one of his best friends.
"Well, in that case, we should probably get it back to him, I can hold on to him, and tomorrow we can mail it."
He said laughing to himself.
"Yeah?"
Peter suggested and Ben nodded in agreement.
"Hey, Peter, what's dad like?"
Peter simply shrugged his shoulders
Ben wasn't sure when exactly he let go of his dad. But when he finally did, he felt like he had just run a marathon. Tired, but at the same time filled with energy, he was even sweating a bit. He wanted to talk to his dad more, But Â Pepper started talking to him about meetings, and other stuff, that sounded important. He wasnt comftrable interrupting.
"sounds good to me"
" Steve calm down the helmet absorbed the most of the hit now go get ice, don't worry I'll take care of him, now go"
Peter asked as he took a big bite of his cookie.
"If you say so".He said with your ruffled his hair and kissed his forehead."
"Peter I can assure you Whatever it is it's not as big as my news" Ben sounded out of breath and panicked.
"I will".
"A little, I know you think is weird"
"...Yeah..." Ben knew it was a joke but he still laugh nervously.
"What bad stuff?"
The helmet came off, and the second the boy's identical, brown eyes met, they both let out a loud gasp and took a step back, everybody else was frozen, but they were still whispering.
"So what? we'll just get there earlier or are you afraid that you'll bump into him?"
His breathing became heavier, and the chest pain came back once again, he moved on and ignored it, this time focusing on the furniture, that wasn't anything special but it was nice. Â There were a few books on the coffee table next, to the TV and a Sketchbook on the windowsill, that was connected to a fire escape. The apartment as a whole was warm and welcoming, much like Steve himself.
Peter was bouncing up and down his seat.
" So after you're done with your whole secret mission, if you're still in New York maybe we can hang out or you can message me".
"Yes, pops, I'm sure" He turned to his aunt he couldn't see far away very well but he could make that she was on her phone.
Peter yelled out as he reached for his father.
he quickly put on his seatbelt and buried his fingernails into the seat, as if the plane was about to crash.
his dad didn't say anything he just took a seat in the big chair that was next to him and placed his son on his lap."Sure thing"
"And I think Peter would agree with you".
Bucky kissed his cheek "I definitely qualify"
"He kicked me out for being too annoying, so I decided to come over and bother you instead," He said finally letting go of the boy.
he brought him closer to him ."Okay, but I must warn you it's cheesy"
Ben looked at the ground as he thought it over.
"Come on, for once I want snacks, you can even tell me your story on the way there"
He said feeling cocky and proud of himself that he managed to dodged it, but seconds later a much bigger balloon fell on him. "That freaking boy,is the most insane, Despicable two-faced person I have ever met in my life."
They both looked at each other and started to laugh.
"What do you say kiddo do you want to have a quick stop before heading home?"
"How did they even do that, do one of them have super strength or something, who the hell even did it!"
"And, last but not least there's my aunt Natasha, or Tasha, she is dangerous because she can always tell when something is off, and if you think you can read her emotions, you're wrong, trust me that's how Bucky lost an arm to her".
"Point is kiddo, I got plenty of blackmail material"
None of them knew what happened after they were forced to run last night, and definitely had absolutely no idea on what was waiting for them.
"What, he knows it's summer, right?"
After that. Both Peter and Ben confessed. But they didn't rat out any of their friends. They were forced to clean the cabin, and the next day they were escorted by the Camp's director and Maria, to a small cabin, it was isolated but it wasn't too far that it would be a safety hazard. Even though it was smaller, it had much more room seeing that the only piece of furniture were two twin beds, two desks on each side of the room, and curtains that were hanging on the windows. "Now, the two of you are going to be spending the next week in this cabin, learning how to act civilized, you will be checked on daily, and you will also have a separate table in the mess hall. And if we don't see improvements in your behavior, then we're going to call your parents, and the two of you will get sent home early. Do you boys understand?" The director said in a Stern voice
Ben couldn't fight his feeling anymore and he also didn't want to, as he spoke his voice was cracking."What happened, like why isn't he here...why did you leave us?"
Natasha suggested.
"Did he really ditched you, in the lake without any clothes?"
" it's such a cool name, did you just come up with just now, are really you're really going to help us?"
thank you for sticking with me,  you guys are the best!
Ben was sitting next to the window, drawing random things on it using the fog, while Peter was sitting in his side of the cabin, reading on his desk one of the comics he had brought with him.
she got close look at him."There doesn't seem to be any swelling, how are you feeling, be honest"
"I always wanted one of those."
"Sunscreen"
Ben asked almost in a panic.
"Now it's done". as he started to clean his brushed his phone started to ring."Just on time...um sport could you get it?". He said as he looked down at his paint-covered hands.
I'm  sooo tired, I'm sorry for the awful (like always)writing but if I don't post this now I won't be able to do it for another two day
"Also..thanks for actually picking me up," Ben said in a sheepish voice.
"I have to agree with that".His pops echoed as he came up to him.
Peter started walking towards the other boy while Ben was trying to keep calm by telling himself that this can't be happening, yes, Peter was identical to him, yes, the stories were very similar but he didn't want to believe it, That his dad lied to him all of his life.
"Well, sometimes I do wonder." they both smiled at each other and started to laugh.
TMI-BRR
"I guess you outgrew it".
"Well, if one of the kids is sick with more reason I have to get in there."
Peter was still having trouble reading his pops, but anybody could tell that whatever he felt all those years ago was still present, at least a hint of it. he bit the inside of his cheek before asking.
"It's you, it's really you, your here!"
Peter stopped to give Johnny a quick look before waving his hands in front of the two. "Okay, first of all, my dad wouldn't clone me...okay he wouldn't clone me and not tell me about it."
Ben said quietly as he looked around, sure, Peter had shown him pictures of his house, and everything, but the place was much more impressive in person. He took his dad's hand almost as if he was afraid to get lost in there.
Ben stood there, still flabbergasted. He made his way to Luke and Danny, who were the only ones left from the crowd that was witnessing the fencing duel. When he approached them, he was quiet for a bit, he looked at them and said in a soft voice.
"I'm sorry, I didn't want you to freak out and spit out your drink...I just wanted to know more."
"And for once in your life, you can say you were right."
He was lying, but that wasn't the worst part.
"Alright".
Ben said from the other side of the door.
" Ben, I think we're ready!"
He pulled out his phone as he thought it over."Alright, we have a little time".
"I can imagine". Tony then kissed the back of Ben's head before answering."What did you want to ask?"
"Peter, dad is getting married!" Ben yelled on his end
"Anyway, let's look at the list Pepper gave you."
"No, it's not."Ben protested again but made no effort to pull away from his dad.
Most of the staff members, were in the meeting, leaving just the volunteer counselors, a.k.a all high school and college kids, who volunteered to be here in charge of keeping the kids busy, with various activities after breakfast.
"You have horrible eyesight... my head hurts right now."
"I'll make the call," She said proudly and made her way downstairs.
He heard Jarvis chuckle and felt how he gently stroke his back.
He turned to his mom."I almost forgot about those, Obie gave it to me, he sent a basket and everything, I guess it was his way of apologizing. Apparently, nothing says "I'm sorry, I almost got your marriage annulled, and ruined your husband's career, and led you to have one of the most complicated adoptions in the world," like baby clothes, but at least he apologized, unlike Howard." He couldn't help but sound bitter about that.
The text you later, bro, in the bathroom so can't stay too long or it would look weird -PPS
"Okay, I want a good clean fight, understood?"
If one forgets their past they are bound to repeat it
"What's the story?"
He said before putting his glasses back on
"So, what came from new york?" He asked as he put his bag on the bed and begun to take out his clothing.
The place was slightly messy but perfectly organized at the same time, there was a wooden desk, filled with paint stains, on the corner with an old computer and enough space for him to sketch, the bookshelf was overflowing with art supplies and a few art books, just like the desk they were also wooden and covered with paint and it looked like they had seen better days, there were finished pieces hung on the wall and a few in the middle of the room, there was a place where he could paint, in one corner there were some finished pieces, some were covered other were just facing the wall, it looked big enough to Peter but his dad was a giant so he could see why he felt like a sardine, what he was more focus on was the actual paintings, there were all beautiful, they were all colorful and filled with life, the one he liked the most was the one his dad was currently working on, he was probably just giving it the finishing touches ,it was a forest at night underneath a sky full of stars. He didn't know the night could look this colorful,he then noticed what looked to be four dark figures in the forest, it looked like a family admiring the stars to him,they didn't have any characteristics to them ,it was just four figures two were much smaller than the other so that's why he assumed it was a family.
"You know, for people who are constantly trying to keep me out of the spotlight you guys make some questionable decisions."
In short, he felt completely miserable. But he didn't say anything, he wasn't going to let itchy eyes and the fact that he was sleepy ruin his day with his pops and aunt.
Next to it was a note that said:
"See, what did I tell you, love, hippie-dippy?"Happy chimed in.
"Shoot"
Ben asked in a sheepish voice.
Steve pushed Peter's hair back.
Ben couldnât stop smiling, happy to already have made two new friends, a great way to start an adventure. Not even the side pocket of his bag ripping open was enough to sour his mood, poor thing, had been through a lot in such a short amount of time. Luckily, the only thing in there was the deck of cards his uncle Bucky had given him. He had taught him how to play earlier that year, much to the dismay of his dad, and it had fallen right by his feet. "So... by any chance do any of you know how to play this? "He asked as he flashed the deck to Danny and Luke.
Peter just ignored them as he picked up his card and bit the inside of his cheek as he studied them.
"Hey, spiderling".
"...Alright?"
Peter said still holding the fuzzy toy close to his chest, once his dad was gone, he placed it on the bed next to the pillows and ran to get his glasses out of his backpack and hide them, one thing was spidey but explaining why he had his friend's glasses, he would get him more than a blank stare.
but Peter didn't care, he loved his old vintage Polaroid camera and wouldn't trade it for anything.
Peter suggested as he waved the cards in his hand.
"So, you ignoring every shortcut was something my dad made you do?"
He said to himself, as soon the Ball shot out he forced himself not to flinch or closed his eyes and took the swing as hard as he could and..he did it, he dropped the bat and turned to Steve and Natasha with a giant smile as he started jumping up and down with a huge ear to ear smile.
"That's where I knew him from!" Danny stood up from his bed as he had his revelation. But his friends just looked at him with very confused faces. "Long story short, my dad forced me to go to this really boring gala, and I sat next to him, we didn't really talk, I just remember him because nobody was bothering him, not even the paparazzi, which is super weird because normally they're really annoying"
He panicked but was still determined to get it out. He doubled down and began to pull as hard as he could, but all his efforts ended with him falling on his butt, and to add insult to injury, yet another bag was thrown in, talk about being kicked when he was down.
"So how about you, invite your husband to dance, we drink some more champagne and we eat some cake and then I can take you to our room and ride you like there's no tomorrow"
"I know what you mean! I love my family, but whenever I try to explain my family tree is a pain."
"Jarvis we're home"
"I always call you pops."
Peter said lifting his own cookie and tapped it against Ben's as if they were champagne glasses.
Ben gave him a small glare that indicated he didn't care who started it, he just cared who ended it, he turned his back to the other kids in hopes that he would get the attention away from Peter.
"...okay"
"How am I a two-face?"
Opening the door and Peking inside, he saw his dad talking on the phone, he seemed frustrated and was surrounded by big books, no, those weren't books they were, photo albums.
Ben nodded happily as his dad continue to move around his arms like he was a puppet.
He smiled at him as he took a seat on the bed." Every night when you were a baby"
Peter said with a small smile, as he finished getting everything back to its place.
"I don't know, will see"
" You can count the Widow into your plan?"
Ben asked as he took another bite.
"That makes total sense," He said with a big smile.
"Alright then and maybe we can stop by the post office and send your friend his toy"
he did, he wanted to look like his pops and aunt looked and hit the ball.
" Will do, tho I still have hope that I'll find a way to keep your small forever."
Peter asked in utter shock
"Right back at you,"
Why didn't they have that, what could possibly have been so bad that things turned out this way, why did his pops lie? his pops hated lying and yet he had done it all these years, why did his dad...no.
" Ben!, seriously what the hell is wrong with him, he was the one who suggested jumping naked, not my fault he is a sore loser." Peter punch the floor but still didn't have enough energy to get up from it.
"I'll be right back"
Ben said awkwardly
"And the counselor just let you do that?" Pepper asked concerned.
"You know, right now I can't decide what is more addicting your laughter or those lips"
"Buck, put him down he's not a sack of potatoes."
"Dad?"
"Hey, Stevie, wait up I need to talk- oh what happened?"
Miles asked, he was one of the other boys sharing the cabin with them, he was the youngest but still became quick friends with everybody, he also wasn't there to witness the duel between Peter and Ben.
Peter was rubbing his eyes almost the whole way there not being used to having his contact lenses, he was also reviewing the notes that Ben has given, him trying to memorize every detail. He couldn't decide whether the bus ride was taking too long or if it was going too fast.
The car drive came to an end and Peter became slightly comfortable.
"He is...incredible, he's so sweet and kind, and stands up for others, and makes me breakfast every day, and he's...well at least I thought he was honest...Why do you think they lied to us?" the boy asked sounding disillusioned, as he let himself fall to the ground.
"It's bound to happen sooner or later, by the way, sir a package arrived for you this morning, from new york".
It had been a rough morning, first the closet, followed by the spidey incident, but at very least his pops didn't know he had been on the phone with Ben all night, or at least late until he passed out on the phone. But the fun didn't stop there, shortly after they ate, he had a little incident including his glasses. He had thought that him not wearing his contacts during breakfast and putting them on later would be no issue, oh, but depth perception was not his friend, he ended up tripping over the furniture when his pops decided to move a chair by an inch, he also missed the bathroom door and ended up slamming into the wall .
"Any time, kiddo."
"Well, I guess I'll see you on the other side Rogers".
" Pop's, why would you do that to an innocent fry?!" Peter said in horror.
Ben said with a giant grin on his face as he also held back his tears.
"Are you going to put your name on it?"
"Are they your parents?"
"Daaad, stop," He protested but he was laughing.
"So, truce?"
"Okayhaveanicedayhereisyourpen!" He shouted as he put down the Pen on the table and ran towards his pops and Natasha. He hugged his dad hiding his face in his stomach praying that his uncle Bruce wouldn't look this way.
"Well, in that case, Hakuna Matata"
His aunt took a seat next to him and reached for spidey.
Steve asked intrigued.
"I like this one!" Peter said pointing at the campus.
"I'm your dad I notice everything. Also language."
"There that good," he said before taking another bite.
Peter had stopped eating and was unusually quiet as he listened to Ben
"I'm glad you did, would you like to go back next summer?"
"Pops!".
"mmhm, I think...I'm in the same house you are in, I even have more than a few Hufflepuff tendencies."
"I guess is just a me thing, pops"
He took a pause from his explanation to take a sip from his soda.
"I know so, just talked to him trust me,"
"That was an accident. Plus,I was trying to help you?! "
"Dear god that was so horribly cheesy... Oh, my god, my husband is so cheesy...my husband"
Peter stopped dead on his track when he saw three other doors in front of him, he looked between trying to remember the makeshift blueprints that Ben showed telling him which room was what. He reached for the middle and gave himself a mental high five when he saw he got it right.
He playfully pushed him away. Trying hard not to blush but failing in his attempt.
Ben asked his brother as he lifted the scissors that they manage to sneak in. It was their last day at the isolation cabin, and this was their last chance to do this before they had to rejoin every other camper into the schedule, so they wouldn't have that much free time anymore. They were in the bathroom so the clean-up would be easy, and they would be close to a mirror, and Ben wouldn't have to do this blind.
Maria Noticed this."Have you had any contact with him?"
"Do I qualify for that cute rule as well?" Bucky asked as he came up behind them
"When I went to get the scissors, I found these in lost and found, they have been there for a year now, so it's cool, they probably belonged to a counselor".
" You really were tired, huh, I was about to go up to check up on you"
"Really? That's so cool!"
"Hey, look it's your mystery twin"
Peter said with determination clear in his voice
Steve put an arm around him
"Someone is coming!" One of the boys said in a very loud whisper.
"Once a four-eyes, always a four eyes".
He pressed his finger between his eyes, again forgetting that he didn't have glasses to push back. " No one" His aunt did a quick scan of the restaurant but he didn't think too much of it, it didn't seem like she got a look of the so he thought he was in the clear, plus if is pops didn't know bruce what were the chances Nat did. He leaned his head on Pop's shoulder and witnessed how he took one of his fries and dipped it into his shake.
Peter explained, as he took the picture from him and placed it with the others. He paused before picking up another picture. He hesitated for a bit but he decided to show it to Ben.
He whispered into Tony's ears, it always amazed how saying those three words to the other man felt like the easiest in the world and how his heart was filled with joy every time he uttered them.
"Good to know I'm not disappointing my biggest fan"
Peter didn't say anything he quietly got up from the floor without breaking eye contact with Ben
" What does that mean"
Peter said to his twin, which made Ben laughed in response, as he took Peter's camera into his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, I know because you already said that like a million times already," Ben said sounding a bit annoyed, but couldn't really stay mad at Peter
"Wait?" Peter said, sounding so defeated as he rested his chin on the table.
"Nothing, just kidnaping you".
An older man stepped into the room.
The blond said pointing to Ben's bag.
"I knew I should have sent you to science camp," His dad said playfully.
"like what?". He asked sounding a little confused.
"Uncle Bucky!" He greeted him with a smile, but notice how he had the same look his pops had before running off, his gaze was even glued the same direction he went too, Peter was about to turn around to see what was going on when he suddenly heard his pop's voice yell.
Ben replied the way he thought Peter would.
"Did I do something wrong?"
There was a long period where Peter swore that he was going to die out of boredom when his pops and aunt had to take care of the grown-up stuff side of getting the new place but it wasn't anything he wasn't used to thanks to his dad's work, plus they had promised him a cheeseburger and after that the batting cages, he had never gone to one but it sounded like fun to celebrate, so that gave him enough motivation to keep his usual upbeat attitude.
"Pops, pops, Nat, did you see that I hit it, I really hit it!
Ben asked, as he grabbed a spoon full of peanut butter, and spread it out on top of an Oreo before taking a bite of it.
"I'm much better".
He took a deep breath and loosen his grip on Peter."What was the story you wanted to hear?"
He said as he opened the car door.
Peter pocketed the phone afraid that his dad might see it."It's just my friend from Camp."
Peter's eyes widen, as he violently shook his head and quickly swallowed his food.
The man said as he pointed to the car, but Ben was frozen, he wanted to say something but he could feel the words get stuck in his throat.
"Normal is overrated but you know what isn't? not getting eaten by monsters"
That morning, when Ben woke to the sight of multicolored string hanging from the bunk beds, and ceilings that resembled a spider web, he went back to sleep, thinking that he was still dreaming but it didn't take long for reality to sink in. He sat up from his bed, which made five rubber black spiders fall on his head. He screamed from the top of his lungs, which had the result of waking up the rest of the boys in the cabin.
his dad let him go but he was still hugging him. He was much sillier than Ben imagined him to be, especially after that first meeting.
"Yeah, yeah, that's his name, um... you do remember that friend I was telling you about in the car? it belongs to him, I must have packed it by accident, I don't know how that happened because he has an almost unhealthy attachment to it like it's a security blanket, like for example if he was in a place far away from home in a stressful situation he would definitely want it with him."
"Glad to see that you ditch the nerd camp, Finally you do something cool."
"Wait, I think I know who can help,"
The man smiled at him.
" But I think your right, and we should wrap this up, but we should do it with style."
"Why didn't you get along with dad the first time you two met, what happened after you drew him and how did you end up getting married in a boat?"
Steve playfully nudged him."That's what you get when you made me watch all the movies and read all the books with you,"
That caught Peter's attention, he turned to his godfather, as he sat up.
"I'm not betting my glasses!"
"My uncle Bruce sometimes lives with us, but right now he's off in another country doing some research, so you don't have to worry about him."
The music continued to play in the background as the photographer captured the image of the happy newlywed couple. Seconds, after the picture was taken Tony, took his new husband by the tie and pulled him in for a kiss. Steve happily Kissed him back while not resisting the urge to smile as the warm lips embraced his, eventually a laughter as sweet as honey broke out, with foreheads still pressed against each other and lips still so close together that they could touch with the slightest movement, it didn't take much for the laughter to infect the young inventor.
"No, we can't...because he's not home...he's.. spending the rest of the summer with his grandparents ... in...Washington...that's why he went camp there, cuz it was close to his grandparents...yeah ".Peter bit the inside of his cheek hoping his pops would believe his story and the look he was giving him didn't help his nerves.
"So dad and Pepper, huh? Are you sure this wasn't your plan to spend some time with me before I left? "
"Buddy that's great but keep your eye on the-"
"Why would you do that to an innocent fry?"
The short answer was not good not only did his head hurt like crazy but his vision was weird.
Tony said with a nervous laughter as the realization that he had just eloped in a ship hit him like an iceberg
"No, why?"
"The better question is what were you doing?"
" Kiddo, you might want to check your watch because there is no time difference between California and Washington".
"I was 19 he was 20."
"Here you missed one,"
Ben was quiet as he tried to remember if his dad ever dated someone.
One of the counselors yelled out.
"Wow...pops you're so tall, I can see everything from here, I'm like a hawk".he could hear his dad chuckle as he gave his leg a little pat.
"Stop shaking then!".
That made him laugh, apparently Peter was good at that, He paused and looked down at his cookie as silence filled the room again. "Hey...I'm sorry about the roof."
He had never been to a batting cage but it looked intriguing. It was outside and kids were running away, the sounds of their laughter over the sound of the baseball hitting the metal and wooden bats, The cages were outdoors filled with families. Peter was a little nervous never had done this and there was a reason why he was never picked first in gym class.
"How!!!"
As soon as he was in he locked the door behind him, and got out the eye drops that were in his pocket, he applied a few in his eyes, not wanting his contacts to dry out, or else he would be in real trouble. After that, there was a long pause, as he dropped to the ground, he didn't know what to feel, he wasn't exactly sad, and was still fully committed to the mission, he just felt tired.
They stood there for a little while and when Steve tried to get up Peter still refused to let go.
"Not in the slightest, it kinda just happened, your dad had this habit of just doing what he wanted and most times it had interesting results".
His phone started rigging he quickly got it out."It's Ben" after he said that he heard the apartment door open
"Wow!, buddy, are you okay there, what happened?" His dad sounded worried when he was surprised hug tackled.
"Are you still nervous? you said you were nervous"
Peter asked as he pushed back his glasses.
"If you say so, it was just one line and it was something like for the man who has everything or something like that, I don't remember the exact words but the note saidÂ  T.Stone"
"I'm sorry, I'm nervous!"
He was still sitting on the floor when he got out of his phone, remembering that he promised his brother that he would text him when he arrived.
"That's good to hear little bro, told you, dad is awesome " He yawned "In between the sentence." I think we can move to the second part of the mission we.." His voice became softer and sounded drowsy ."We... just need to focus".
The man came out from underneath the table and Peter's heart stopped, this man was His uncle Bruce.
"Give one of these to Dad, okay?"
Ben said as he leaned against the wall to make himself more comfortable.
Okay, next time just warn me-PPS
"Huh?" He said trying to play dumb."Nothing pops." He pulled away and took and took a step back and tried to swing.
He sighed in defeat and left it open.
His dad walked up to him and placed a helmet on his head. "There we go" he then handed him a bat."It's been a while since we had a day like this right? and I'm sorry about that, these last few months had been crazy"
"Well, it's just I haven't been able to say that in forever, pops, "no hello, pops", or "good morning pops", and I could say dad but it's not the same."
"That isn't too young"
"Your weird kid" Steve pushed his lips together in an effort not to laugh and handed Peter a bottle of maple syrup."Don't drown them"
"Why did you bring your snack bag to dinner?"
He paused and tried to think before he said anything."Well...you see I'm curious and you can agree that "He had to leave and he loved you" isn't enough".
"On your left!" followed by an even louder."Oh, come on!".
"Ben, that question has a long confusing grownup answer to it, trust me, you don't want to hear it, at least not right now."
"see, crisis aborted?"
"Yes, and no. My family is kinda weird, and a bit complicated. But I wouldn't trade it for the world."
"This time with no cheating,"
Peter reached for the door and opened it and got out as fast as he could.
Peter spoke up after standing there for a few seconds in silence.
Peter simply nodded and went to join the handful of kids, who have had shown up.
"How did you end up marrying in a cruise ship did you plan it?"
the staff member said with a warm smile, she stepped out the way and from a distance, Peter could see him, he quickly grabbed Ben's stuff and started running towards the man, as he got closer he could see that even though he was taller, more muscular, and had way more facial hair than the man in his old, wrinkled photo it was him, it was his pop's.
"I'll be okay, don't worry"
" First things first, I'm going to need you to magically forget some of the words I just said or at the very least not repeat them, because those are not allowed...for kids"
he found himself smiling at that, but he also felt tears, they were filling up his eyes, along with an odd feeling in his stomach, he could feel his face get red as thoughts started to fill his head.
"Done!"
"He. isn't. my clone, stop, with the crazy theories! Although... I have to admit I like the alternate universe one, that'd be cool. But still, stop it, you're making this a bigger deal than it is."
Ben finished putting up the drawings of his family he had made, they weren't god awful, but they were really sketchy and they were drawn with crayon. Also, half of them didn't even have noses, but it was all they had to work with. Seeing that he didn't have as many pictures as Peter did. He only had two pictures, the old one of his dad, and another one they took on his birthday, and his pops wasn't even in it, he was the one taking the picture.
"Actually, we all feel fine".
And just as his heart rate was starting to go back to normal the bus stopped.
"No, I'm not, Come on guys let's go!" Peter grabbed his backpack from his bed and headed for the door. He might not like the idea of running into Ben, but he also didn't like the idea of proving Johnny right.
"Alright, I believe you"
Ben looked up, it was true he was only playing with the already melted ice cream, he didn't really ask for it, Happy just gave it to him because that's what Peter would have wanted, he tried to eat some, as not to seem rude but he was too anxious to eat, let alone talk.
Steve cling their glasses together
Peter smiled at the thought of finally meeting him.
Ben yelled, being just as nervous as Peter, who had shut his eyes so hard that his face was wrinkled.
Peter stayed quiet, he was about to say something, but Maria got past him. and when she stepped inside, a bucket of syrup fell on top of the counselor, and before a scream even left her mouth, the fan had turned on making white feathers fall like snowflakes.
Peter waved his hand over his face.
"Well, that's what you get for being mean."
"What do you think?"
He offered his hand.
Ben said firmly.
"Wait, mom, just lower the volume but don't turn it off".
"See, this is why I think we should tell someone," Miles said with zero energy but still being the only one that made it to a bed.
Ben said with an unsure voice and pointed at her.
" Wait, you have contact lenses, right?!"
"I've missed you too."
After bucky left Peter walked around the apartment, while playing with his hands. when an idea came to his head, he picked up a couch cushion.
Peter felt like someone had suddenly shot him with a freeze ray and dropped the phone this day couldn't get any worse
Peter took a deep breath of relief and stopped planning his big escape. He looked down at his hands being grateful that he and Ben had the same coping mechanism when it came to dealing with stress.
Ben rolled his eyes at him.
"8 months, but like I told you we met like four months before that"
Better late than never, right?
Peter headed straight for the sketchbook, he started flipping through it, this wasn't the first time he had seen his pops' work, his dad had given him three drawings, and told him it was from his other dad, they were dedicated to him, and everything, the same day he gave him the picture, they were old, and time had made the paper go from white to yellow. They weren't as refined as these ones, but he still loved them. Especially, since up until now, they were the only way he could truly connect to his pops, a picture only told him what he looked like, but the drawings were much more personal and gave him a small glimpse of who he was, at first, he just hung them in his room, with pieces of tape. Later on, he worked up the courage to ask his dad for a frame for each one, but now he had the real thing, but he didn't know what to say to him, and he also, though he was a different person which made bonding a bit of a challenge.
"Not yet". His dad grabbed a thin brush and dipped it in paint and signed it,
"As long as you give one to Pops". He tightened the gip he had on Peter, squeezing him closer to him before loosen it up again. like Peter had mentioned they had been apart for 11 years, but now that they spend the summer together, and got to know each other, knowing that he would have to let go of his brother, and not see him for a very long time filled the young boy with a strange sense of melancholy.
Peter changed the subject, by putting the spotlight on Ben.
Even with those few differences, the boys were completely identical, to the point, where they were even wearing the same expression of shock. With their eyes completely widen and their mouth slightly opened.
"I had this since I was nine, and found it on my dad's desk and it's ripped...right down the middle".
"You have been biting your nails again, that usually means that you're nervous, so what's wrong?"
"Yeah...yeah...that's great...B-"
but before he got to the bathroom he heard a loud thump, he turned around and noticed a table filled with papers, it kinda reminded him how the workshop would look like when his dad and uncle Bruce were working, there was one guy sitting there but he couldn't good look at him, do to the fact that he was trying to get his notes from under the table, he also noticed a pen on the ground not far from the where he was sitting, he figured it belonged to the messy guy, He picked it up and walked over to him.
Peter looked around trying to figure out which one of the buildings his pop's studio was located in, after all, Ben never talked about it but there was one thing he did notice.
Johnny rolled his eyes at his friend not impressed by his offer "But fine." He jumped off the bed and onto the floor. "I'll take it, let's go."
" Okay first things first, Stretched out your hand".
"How do you think I got those?"
Peter lean forward in shock
his dad let out a dry chuckle at that."Thanks. That really was a lifetime ago I think you were nearly two months old at the time, we had just brought you home"
Ben would normally never tell anybody about this, especially a complete stranger, but there was something about Peter that made him trust him, despite everything that had happened, so he let his guard down.
"I'm fine now, I talked to dad and felt way better". He replied with a cheery tone.
"Speaking of cool uncles, where did you leave Sam?"
"No, and yes, so how long did you two date before you got married?"
"He didn't know I was taking the picture".
"No bears, just gum".He tried to smile but was too tense which made his attempt seemed odd.
Peter said Softly
he watched his dad carefully, he almost felt proud of himself when he was able to notice how he bit the inside of his cheek, as he looked to be thinking. Actually, now that he thought about it, Peter did the same thing. His dad then leaned forward to get the attention of the other man.
through lunch, Peter kept pecking over the booth but was careful to keep the lower part of his face hidden, he seemed to be in the clear, Bruce was too pre-occupied with his notes and lunch,
He said pointing to Bruce's picture
"It's been a while since I've heard it".
Danny asked in disbelief, after hearing Ben's story. last night when Ben finally managed to reach their cabin with nothing but a towel he didn't really bother waking up his friends to tell them what happened, all he cared about was not dying from hyperthermia and getting into warm dry clothing, he waited until the next day after the morning checkup to fill them in on what had happened.
Peter muffled as he wrapped his legs around Steve's waist, as he was being carried away.
Tony shot the blond a flirtatious look as he took a sip of his drink.
also, the first time I wrote this I wanted to see if I could fit aunt may into this but then I thought that if she was in this story she wouldn't have allowed any of this to happen.
What immediately caught Peter's eyes was the way the wall was painted, yes, it was a weird thing to notice, but then again Peter was a weird kid, most of the walls looked fine, it was neat and clean and it looked like someone actually knew what they were doing when they painted it, but looking around he noticed that the rest of it was the complete opposite, the paint strokes were uneven, and sloppy almost as if a child would have done it, that's where it hit him, his pops and Ben probably did this themselves, at first the mental image made him happy, but suddenly, he felt his throat go dry, his chest felt tighter, as melancholy came over him. He shook his head, and tried to ignore it, and kept looking around, his focus shifted to a couple of pictures on the wall and shelves, most of them were of Ben and his pop's, there was one he assumed was taken in his uncle's wedding, considering everybody was dressed up, another one was of his pop's Squadron, next to it there were a few framed medals, but they were overshadowed by what Peter had to assume, was every accomplishment Ben had ever made in his short life along with every drawing, it didn't take long before he came across a picture of Steve holding a baby, who was no older than a year.Â  Peter took a long look at it and a thought came across his head.
Peter froze, he was entering full panic mode, was this game over? He glanced at the window, thinking that maybe he could roll out of the car like in the movies without getting hurt.
with that, his dad ran off and his aunt came close and examined his head.
"No, but Pepper is my godmother, and that's her husband, Happy, he's cool, but he's not my dad."
Danny let go and started to scan the campsite.
Peter didn't hold back as he told her entire story, from the fencing duel to them finally meeting their other parents
Luke commented with a smile on his face.
"No...no wife," his pops said awkwardly
"It doesn't sound like nothing"
"See you around four eyes".
He extended his hand so they could shake on it.
"Sounds good!"
"What are you doing now?"
-As his pops started to paint Peter was watching closely but after a while, he started rocking back and forward on his stool asking a million question.
"I believe that". Peter said with a nod, it was true when his dad got an idea in his head there would be no force on earth to get it out, it drove Pepper and Rhodey insane but his dad was right sometimes it could be fun, "So he asked you?"
his supposed kidnapper said in a nonchalant voice as he brought him out into the living room
"You're not helping, Miles!"
changed drastically, there was silence along with this odd tension in the air
It was just easier to talk to him, there was no wall between them, and Peter didn't get a weird feeling in his stomach that he couldn't explain.
"I doubt is as weird as mine."
Luke and Danny screamed from their bunk bed, which had been covered with glitter glue and colorful feathers.
"Oh, um it's just I got gum in my hair, so my friend cut it for me"
"I promise."
"Why would you tell that while we're eating?!" Steve said disgusted putting down his own meal
"Yeah, but to look alike is one thing, you two could switch places if you wanted to".
"That was fun, so, Natasha has been helping you look for a new studio?"
Peter said afraid of what was coming.
"Fine, you are no fun".Bucky sat down who he thought to be Ben and ruffled his hair with two hands, one of them being a robotic prosthetic that kinda reminded Peter of Dummy.
"Hey don't blame me, blame Danny, he's the one that made the nickname stick."
"Wait, didn't you say you were a Ravenclaw?"
Peter laid down and held his stuffed animal over his head.
"It's just...it's just I don't know how to, I want to ask you like a million questions, but I don't know how to and I'm afraid that you'll get angry and not want to talk to me, or that your not going to like me anymore".
He was snapped back into reality by that." Yeah, the best".
"A Hufflepuff with Gryffindor tendencies?
"Finally someone who understands! You should see how my Pops and uncles look at me when I eat them, you would think I was eating a bug or something."
he was just guessing where all of this stuff went and ended up dumping all of the clothes into the hamper that was next to the door.
"You're in cabin Oakwood!"
"How do we do that?"
"What did I just say?!, also, like I said Uncle Bucky, along with his husband, uncle sam, are over at the apartment almost every day."
"Are you sure because-"
Peter paused, trying to see if that ran any belles but nothing came to mind.
"Yeah..."
I guess I forgot-BRR
"I'll take your word for it."
He pointed to the picture of his dad and Jarvis, which was connected with a green string.
Ben looked up at Jarvis, he looked and sounded annoyed while he said that last part, he glanced over at his dad, who looked like a kid who was seconds away from being grounded
Ben smiled at her, but he continued to look around, but he didn't see anybody else." Where's my dad?"
"There are four people"
guess you'll have to wait until the next chapter to find out and I promise it won't take me 84 years to update this time
"Okay, dad," He said a little too amuse after witnessing that. Jarvis let him go so he could get his bags but kept an eye on him.
"My godfather is sooo cool!" Peter said with glee.
"Hey, it stopped raining, do you want to go get something to drink in the mess hall?"
He felt her fingers run through his hair"What?"
" You panicking won't help, ice will"
"Didn't you eat like 5 popsicles that same day?"
"Um... How about you tell me one more story and I'll tell you about...um my friends Luke and Danny."
Peter pouted his lips but eventually gave in.
she shook her head.
"You be surprised what we got away with." The boy responded with a grin as he remembered the prank war that had send everything into motion.
-----
"Yeah, I did,"
Peter bit the inside of his cheek and shrugged his shoulders." Like I said I'm a curious kid".
"Hey, hey, look at me". He picked up his chin with his fingers ." First of all nothing you do will ever make me like you less, you're my kid, I'm always going to love you, and second of all, I don't want you to ever feel afraid to talk to me, okay?"
Peter was pretty sure that's the only reason why his aunt had carried him to his room was that she wanted to make sure he didn't crash into anything else on his way there.
He was nervous, and when he was nervous he would normally ramble off until his throat went sore, but right now he was silent, which couldn't be a good sign.
"See, the kid gets it,"
Life, standing behind me with a malicious smile ready to slap me in the face: oh, you'll see.
"I haven't gotten to the weird part, for one I know a lot about my biological parents, my dad never kept that secret from me...well except for their last names, but I know their first names, I also know that they were scientists and that my first last name came from an aunt I had, who according to my dad loved me more than the universe itself but who sadly passed away. I know it's messy, but I'm not done, another weird thing is that it wasn't always me and my pops, he used to be married to my other dad, but he left when I was really little, all I know about him is that he used to sing me these lullabies and play piano".
"Buddy, do you need help there"
"I know your pops' responds is always, that he'll tell you when you're older but even though, I would follow him to hell and back but that doesn't mean that I agree with everything, so, I say you give your old man, a taste of his own medicine, and be as stubborn as he is, and sure, he'll crack and no time."
"Okay, boys that's enough" The light-haired counselor came up to them to help them both out.
He replied almost daring Ben, but still maintaining a friendly tone with him.
"Are you going to keep it or sell it"
"I'm basically 11!" For a moment Ben thought about maybe letting Peter's hair as it was, and spare them both this torture. But he looked at his buzz cut, and compared to Peter's floppy long brown hair, he had to cut it, his hair grew fast, but it wouldn't have grown that much over a month. And his dad would definitely notice the difference.
He ran as quickly as possible to his pop's and uncle and when he was running past Sam he yelled out ."On your Right!". he stopped running and notice how his pops had to cover his face to keep him from bursting out laughing while his uncle stood there dumbfounded.
"Also, If Jarvis isn't cooking, we normally order in food "
His dad pulled him in for a hug, "Thank you Benny...wait what do you mean by both?"
"Kiddo are you okay, there?"
When he was standing in the line to get breakfast, a counselor that Peter was 99% sure had never spoken to him before, told him to enjoy his second serving of waffles, and to leave some syrup for the rest of the kids, before walking away laughing, as if it was an inside joke, to be fair, he was about to grab some waffles, and he did plan to drown them in syrup but that counselor didn't know that, regardless, he decided to brush it off. He did the same when a group of kids came up to him and made weird comments about how they were going to get a rematch and how they were going to win everything back before running off. But as weird as that was, it was the last thing on his mind at this moment. Because Peter was having the time of his life fencing. Normally, he would be the kid to get picked last for everything but against all odds, he was doing pretty well. Mostly because most of them were first-timers, but taking to account that Peter was one of the smallest boys there, and his sight gave him a big handicap. The fact that he was doing this good was a miracle. He guessed that his strategy of pretending that he was swinging around a lightsaber was paying off.
"We trade places!".
"Pops?"
"The better question is why didn't you stop me?"
" Pete, did our dad ever try to remarry?"
Ben laughed harder than before"
"Pops, are you okay?!"
" Ben, your dad's waiting for you over there, it was nice meeting you, I hope we see you next summer."
"Although if that was true the three of you could make a really cool Huey, Dewey, and Louie Halloween costume".
Peter stepped back to admire their work, as he thought about what Ben had asked him, he pressed his lips together before answering.
"Pretty much". Ben sniffed his nose."It's just super frustrating not to know anything, you know?"
"It wouldn't be surprising after all you boys grow like wheat".
"No, I have not forgotten that".Steve reassured him." After breakfast will head to the studio" He looked down at his food and took a long deep breath before looking back at Peter "And I will finish the story on how we met, that is if you're not too tired"
"It's Peter logic, trust me it's better not to question it."
Suddenly Ben's heart sank to his stomach, and his face melted down to a frown.
"I didn't get along with your father when we first met, one of my favorite things to do was tease him and get him angry, and one day I just started speaking in Italian, so he wouldn't understand me and then I switch to French, Unfortunately, I let it slip that I found him very attractive, several times and it turns out your father was fluent in both languages, it was kinda embarrassing"
"I thought you knew everything."
Peter reassured him as he adjusted his thick frame glasses.
Miles asked.
Peter carefully took it and took a drink from it.
"I know how to play, I'm pretty good at it, and judging by that giant pile next to you, I'm guessing you're good at it too."
"Don't worry, I got this...now...you said something about a note?". He tucked the phone between his shoulder and ear and rested his head on the wall.
Ben knew about that, well not everything about that but he did know that's how his godfather lost his arm.
Steve laughed again.
thank you  and I hoped you enjoyed
when the counselors shouted into the microphone, it was Peter's time to go.
"Man, I'm so tired I just want to lay down."
"You do, but you seem to end every other sentence with pops."
"Deal!"
"I've to herd your comebacks, I need you to be better"
Danny turned his attention to the mountain of luggage, trying to guess which one was Ben's.
"What do you mean rich?" Ben asked looking a little confused.
"What? people-watching is a good way to stay alert" Natasha said with an incurring smile
~Present day~
"Who says you have to?"
Despite being three seconds away from screaming his head off the words
"Um...pops, do you think we could have a sleepover?"
"Deal"
"That's all we need everything will fall into place"
"So, it's done?"
"It's the truth!"
"Hahaha, yeah" He laughed nervously and dry swallowed ."Hey, look a cobweb!" He got up and ran to the spiderweb that was on the corner he stared at it for a bit before he got out Ben's phone, he really did miss his camera but in the meantime, it served as a replacement although he was sure he was filling up the memory quickly with photo after foto.
it's Ben's turn to meet his Dad and deal with deal with obstacles along the way both old and new
"Nice, birthmark Rogers!"
"You corrupted my nephew, are you happy now?!".
"That doesn't sound like my dad either."
"Check!"
He told himself, before getting off the bus and got in line with the rest of the campers. It didn't take long for one of the staff members to come up to him with his big yellow duffle bag at hand, and a phone that had a note stuck on it with Ben's name written on it.
"Yeah...wrote to him last week."
"I'm glad you're my godfather"
"One from camp"
He yelled out
"Understood."
"Don't apologize."
"I make no promises".Ben replied going in for another hug.
"Yeah, can't have you all jittery in the car."
"Um...tell you what pops? ".
Peter un-tensed his shoulders at that but he knew he had to be more careful. "By the way dad, these pancakes are amazing "I can tell you like them," he said with a chuckle as he grabbed a napkin and clean Peter's face."When did you become such a messy eater?"
" I don't think Ben likes being part of this conversation".
"Is this is what happens when you get hit with a baseball?"
" I'm not joking, I don't care if you're my twin, I haved survive 11 years without you, I'll survive the rest of my life if I have to."
"What happened to your parents, That's exactly what happened to mine, my dad told me I had another dad, and that he had to leave when I was a baby, I don't remember much about him, all I have from him are a couple of sketches he left for me and...an old photo of him."
"He is my godson, I can do what I want"
"Is that a robot hand, and why is he wearing that hat?"
The other man added with a similar tone, but the honest smile that was painted on his face made the brunette's anxiety temporarily disappear.
He put down the notebook and ran to his brother's room, taking off the back-back and throwing it on the bed before rushing out.
"You know, you can back out if you want."
"Trust me, Rogers,Â  after you see this place you might name your next child after me or at the very least rename Ben"
"You seemed to be very cocky "
( like always sorry for my awful grammar, I can't really English very well and really need a beta reader)
Ben took a deep breath, dropping his towel, and started walking towards the lake, he could hear how the others were giggling in whistling at him, someone even shouted out
"Any request?"
"Absolutely, thanks it was my code name when I was in the field"
"Meh".
"Tell me pops, what did you do in your kid-free time?". He asked while unbuckling his seatbelt.
"that's true".
" I'm trying!"
"Are you alright?"
"Yes?"
"Yeah, thanks, I love those! Especially with peanut butter."
"He...came back and from there we things fell apart, and we couldn't put them back together"
"That doesn't sound like nothing, come kiddo talk to me, what's wrong?"
He laughed at the reference. And got up from his spot, that's when he noticed a picture on the ground, they must have missed. He picked it up getting a good look at it, before giving it back. In the picture, a younger version of Peter was on a beach, alongside a woman, she had long ginger-hair and was wearing a huge pair of sunglasses, the woman was smiling, her focus was on Peter instead of the camera, next to her was a heavier man, with raven hair, who had his hand around the woman's waist and a big smile on his face.
"You have no idea how much I've missed you!"
Peter looked up at him with a weak smile
"How do you know I'm the youngest? according to Jarvis, I'm the tall twin, and yeah he is, he even said we could work on this go-kart together " This time Ben was the worried one, he knew that time differences could mess with you "Hey, Pete, what time is it over there?"
Peter said basically shaking in his seat.
" Now, I'm sure that there is a wonderful story behind it but I'm going to need you to tell me the nutshell version of it because I don't know how long your Uncle Buck is going to be able to distract your dad"
Alright, night kiddo"
"Now, listen up, because this part is very important. When he comes back from jogging, you have to be up, if you're not, he's going to think your sick, so you need to be up. "
"What does that mean?!
Ben responded playfully, still on the ground, and despite his embarrassment, he returned the smile. Gladly taking the other boy's offer to help him up.
"Ben!"
"Jarvis? dad?" he called out, there was no response, He let out a sigh of defeat, perhaps he should just go back and lock himself in Peter's room and go to bed early, he thought to himself, he was just about to do that but he was stopped by his Dad's voice, he followed it to what seemed to be his office.
Maria looked up at the screen and noticed it was on the news, and did as her son asked."One would think you'd be keeping your eyes on the mailbox, instead of the TV."
"It's almost dinner time," Ben spoke up.
"Bingo"
"Boys, come on we agreed on a fair match"
Peter had told him that Jarvis was basically their grandfather and that made Ben really happy, sure he had his pops and aunt and uncles but he never had a grandfather. The closest thing he had was stories about his aunt may and grandmother Sara, but it wasn't the same as someone actually filling in that role. A month ago his family was small and broken, sure it was still broken but it was anything but small, he had finally met his dad, he even had a brother a twin brother for that matter, along with even more aunts and uncles, to say it felt nice would be a huge understatement.
Steve seemed to be processing the information with a blank stare that only made Peter even more nervous than he already was.
"Tons!"
These boys are a bit over there heads but Peter is determined to find out more about his pops and continue the mission but a long day of surprises may make that difficult.
The boy wrapped his arms around his neck and had no intention of letting his dad go anytime soon.
Peter looked down at his dad's hand for a few seconds, before smiling.
"Huh?"
"Looking forward to it,"
"Could that be me?"
His dad was giving him a piggyback ride back to the apartment while he asked for the millionth time if he was okay and if he was sure he felt fine.
"No way, I'm not putting those in my eyes it's gross!"
" Also peter?"
Ben turned to his dad. Much like the city themselves, his pops and dad seemed like day and night. He tried picturing them together as the much bigger adults they were now, instead of the version of the teared-up picture. But as hard as he tried, everything his mind came up with was ridiculous. Like his pops in a limo or his dad going grocery shopping, it seemed almost funny. His eyes lingered on his dad for a bit more before giving up and going back to the window.
"Nothing, your hair is just growing in weird, this is why I tell your pops not to cut it at home, this part looks like you cut it with a pair of old scissors while blindfolded.
FriedChickenNisha,foxaylove, and Cheshire_Jinx
Tony placed his free hand over Steve's mouth interrupting what seemed to be an inspiring speech about how their love will conquer all, now that he thought about it Steve seemed to have on of those for every scenario, it was really a talent, an annoying one at times but it was still a talent.
That made Ben laugh, he noticed that his dad much like Peter, his dad had the ability to make him do that without even trying.
" He's really bad at cursing I'm surprised he didn't call you a stupid face". Johnny said laughing
Bucky responded with a shrug
"Um, yeah just tired I guess". Ben said as he swallowed dry.
"Welp, looks like my vacation time is over, get in the car, kiddo".
Happy opened the door and as soon as he did Peter jumped out of the car and gave him a giant hug.
"Everybody boarding the second bus to the Brooklyn drop-off please bored the buses!"
"Promise"
" It depends". He put down his pallet and turned to Peter." Kiddo, are you getting bored?"
"Okay that's crazy it can't be the same, can it?! plus your picture is probably a whole picture, mine is just this wrinkly old photo that is ripped"
The young boy took a deep breath and played with his food.
"Wow!" Peter ran inside, this place was much bigger than the other studio, it even had a second story well it was more like a giant balcony than a second floor."Pop's cheek this out".
"Your right" He hugged him again this time feeling much better than before.
"You know my uncle Bruce?"
They both grab their cards and looked at them and the second Ben laid eyes on them, he didn't care about keeping His poker face.
"huh?"
"You should have stuck to betting just your snack bag, because..."
"Then cutting your hair was a complete waste of time, because it's not like I can go to summer camp with perfect eyesight then coming back needing glasses also having magically found a pair that is suited for my eyesight, is not very believable!".
Peter looked at Ben then quickly wrote something down.
"Remind me again why I'm friends with you ?"
" I am giving you my baby, don't break, it or else I will swear revenge on you".
"Ewww,You two are weird " Peter said with a chuckle, it was odd for him, the only married couple he had ever been around, or any couple for that matter had been Happy and Pepper and they never acted overly affectionate or joked like this, yeah he had witnessed his godmother constantly stroke Happy's hair, and take his hand. And Happy always had her coffee ready first, and smile every time she walked into the room but nothing like this, his uncle's acted like friends who got married, he didn't know that was possible ,he wondered how his Dads acted when they were married or how they would act when he and his brother would get them back together.
Steve paused and gave him a long look almost asÂ  if he was trying toÂ  remember something importantÂ  ."You got me there, still, I want you to go and stay in bed on time, I can even check the closet and scare them off for you"
They both started to laugh again.
Ben asked as he pointed at the boy in front of him.
Peter warned him about his dad getting stuck at work, but he had waited so long to meet him and the thought of having to wait even longer broke his heart.
"I can handle it" He rested his head on his dad's shoulder as he began to sing.
"Later when am done and the paint dries"
" And this is why I like Polaroids."
She reached for the door, but Peter got in the way before she could open it. Because he knew the second that this door was open,it would activate the final booby trap.
He started exploring and watching other kids arrive, trying to figure out who had been here before and who was new, even making a game out of it in his head. But he got a little too invested in it. Almost missing how the staff members were taking luggage from the bus over to a giant pile in the middle of the campsite, once he noticed, he quickly ran towards it. Luckily, his big yellow duffle bag was easy to spot.
Best of all the two boys were finally relaxing even making jokes and having a small conversation as the game went on.
"It's me".
And super cool he got us burgers-BRR
"The same one you were telling me about?"
"Sure" Peter did what he was told and accepted the call and then gave the phone to his pop's who was finishing washing his hand."Hold on" he said into the phone then handed it to his pops.
"Cool, I'm from Harlem"
Both his pops and Nat looked at each other."The kid has a point, mosquitoes are the worst"
Ben whispered as he continued to deal the cards. Unfortunately, the arrival of Peter caused everybody who was sitting there to turn to him.
Johnny sat up and switch positions now sitting on the bed with his legs hanging on the edge."Are you sure your dad didn't clone you or something?"
Ben took a deep breath and started cutting, the first cut was the worst, it took everything he had not to scream, although, he was pretty sure Peter did. After that it became easier he continued to compare the length of his own hair, as he continued cutting, soon the floor became decorated with Snippets of brown, slightly curled, hair. This continued for about an hour until Ben finally put down the scissors.
He looked up at his dad and tilted his head.
"I do want to meet dad..." he looked up at Peter with a smile on his face and a determined look in his eyes
steve said in a chuckle but Bucky made an interesting gesture at that
"Well, us Gryffindors have to stick together."
" No, he has dated a looooooooot of people, but none of them were serious, I've only met two people out of the billion he dated , they were both cool, one was this weird doctor, and another one was a really fun guy who listened to old music, but they didn't stick around for too long, what about pops did he ever try to marry someone else?"
"Okay, the first thing you have to know is that my Pops, has a beard now that's why I drew him with one second of all, he wakes up early every day, it doesn't matter if it's the weekend or summer vacation, he has a morning routine and he always follows it. he goes running in the morning, comes back, showers, and then starts making breakfast."
" I want to see them, can I see them?"
"We never met in personÂ  but I know he's an associate of your dad"
"So your dad works with robots or something?"
"It's not that crazy, okay, because if you think about it the probabilities of two people looking alike are high, I mean there are only so many faces in the world, some people are bound to look alike".
"Okay, back, what were you saying?"
Just by looking at his pop's face, he could tell he was not expecting that."Um...I'm not sure...maybe bigfoot? but then again Mothman can fly, so it could be a tie"
"Actually I asked him, I got down on one knee and everything. Okay, now it's my turn to ask something, why all the sudden interest? "
"That's my dad!".
He said with a shaky voice before running over to where he had left the metal container, with all his photos and started to look through them.
"We should ask them, like go up to them and say, hey dads, why didn't you tell us you adopted twins and then bailed?."
"Peter?"
Ben knew he must have looked like a deer in headlight much like his dad had, he quickly took them off and cleaned them on his shirt.
"Contact lenses that you own but will never wear?
"How do you know I'll take it?
"Ben!"
"Does he also know?!"
Just got home, BTW why didn't you tell me Pops is like a superhero!-PPS
"Fine, but I won't wear them until we leave, and what about you? my dad knows that I would rather die, than put on my contacts on, so how are we going to explain to him that I'm now wearing them 24/7?!".
the three boys laugh and give each other a hug before, saying goodbye. Luke and Danny were on the first bus to new york while Peter would be on the second one.
"Alright you have two more on this round"
Peter said as he cleaned the crumbs from his face.
"No, but then again I don't trust anyone, for example, are you really my mom or did Haward build you in a lab?"
"He's been around you a lot lately" Maria spoke concerned for Tony.
"they're fake glasses, which means that your smartness is only an illusion".
Peter laughed at that but stretched out his arms. "A quick one won't hurt but you'll owe me a longer one later, Deal?"
"Aren't the first ones really, really, old movies?" He questioned as he started getting up from the floor.
He said proudly being satisfied with his work, Peter stood up and looked at his reflection
Johnny said as he smiled at Peter
Not even getting a chance to finish his question, Luke had already managed to get his bag out, without hesitation.
Ben added. Turns out, he also had a very competitive side.
He said with a bright smile,
"Um...uncle Buck, can I have your extra dumpling?"
Ben took that advice and let himself fall into the bed, he really was tired. He heard his phone buzz.
"Yeah, I guess I'm nervous coming back home, pops."
"Um..is something wrong?
"If you're too tired you can sleep for another hour or so" His pops suggested as he finished cooking breakfast.
She said imitating the tone of voice Ben used while tilting her head and pointing at the young men with a bright smile on her face. She gently placed and on Ben's cheek.
"Yeah we are, so kid, did you bother your pops until he sang?"
"oh my God, you're like a superhero!"
Peter's eyes widen at the last part.
Peter looked up to face Ben.
Peter offered Ben, as he put his folded up close in the edge of the deck, he was still wearing a towel around his waist but he knew he would have to leave it behind soon.
"Check, and don't worry I know you'll miss me I heard you tell aunt pepper"
He looked out the window to distract himself. He had only been out of the city two times in his life, and he had to admit the view was stunning, Malibu was like something out of a movie. Bright and beautiful ,but despite the glamour, he would pick his city in a heartbeat. He felt his shoulders tense at the thought of home. Right now, Brooklyn seem like it was worlds away.
"Here, just take my hand and if you still feel nervous you can just squeeze it, how does that sound ?"
He noticed how his pops were following something with his eyes, but before he could figure out what he was watching, he had run off, seconds later he felt a familiar hand on his shoulder. He turned around and was greeted by his uncle, he was slightly out of breath, with his hair tied up in a messy ponytail, and he was wearing gym clothes.
"And if you were born on August 10th and I was born on August 10th that means we're, like brothers"
"Come on Rogers already said he's fine and you knowÂ  I would never let anything bad happen to my nephew, I'm sure you can trust me with him for a few minutes "
He said with confidence, the way he saw it just because this was humiliating, it didn't mean he couldn't do this without dignity.
Peter just threw his plushie on his bed along with his suitcase and collapsed on the ground.
"It's a little sweeter than butÂ  I'm used too but I think I prefer it like this, also you can tell it was just made by the smell and I really, really like that".
Ben was getting ready to pull it out, taking a hold of the big black straps. But his luck meter seemed to run out in that instance, as he watched his bag get buried right before his eyes, as five more bags were tossed on top of it,
Miles said as he gave Peter a goodbye hug. The two boys had spent the rest of the camp hangin out with the friends they made, after a long explanation, and apology ,and going over their plan every chance they got.
His dad took a deep breath and an even longer time to answer,
When Steve got home there was a calm before the storm, Peter had cried himself to sleep, which gave him time to disinfect all of the baby bottles, and got the second crib set up, so Peter wouldn't catch what Ben had. After he was done, setting everything up including calling Tony.
Before Ben could look up, his dad was ruffling his hair.
"Don't remind me Jar, that keeps me up at night in fact, spidering, could you do your old man a favor and stay little?"
"We should keep it down, we wouldn't want to wake them up." She walked over to the TV with the intent of turning it off.
Peter said as he let go of his brother.
"Not betting my glasses, but how about this, whoever loses has to jump into the lake later tonight?"
Peter rested his chin on his dad's head. It was funny the way he was sitting on his pop's shoulder made it impossible for either of them to see what the other's expression, and it represented their situation of being so close and yet so far, it had been easier to talk to him especially after his chat with his uncle bucky but it was still hard because he couldn't ask him things as Peter, he had to do it as Ben and that was especially difficult, his brother was quiet around adults, he was not, and most importantly Ben already knew everything about his dad, it was true that most kids weren't too close with their parents but he knew both he and his brother were, maybe because untill now it was just them but that was the issue, he wanted to ask things about his pops but he couldn't go: Hey pops can you please tell me things that you know for a fact I already know about you? without sounding suspicious or weird...well weirder, which sucked because he wanted to know crucial information outside of the mission, like what was his favorite movie or dessert did he believe in Mothman? important stuff.
Somehow three little boys had managed to put their bunk beds and luggage on the roof. Including placing Peter's black spider plushie on the flagpole.
"Okay, guys, who's next?" He asked as he shuffled the cards around.
"I told you that ditching the nerd camp for a summer would be interesting".
"Ben, you need to unpack". Steve brought him back to reality as he made his way to Ben's room with the big yellow duffle bag.
It felt like an internity passed by, before the black car pulled into the camp. He took a deep breath and slowly got up from the seat, as he saw the car door open and saw a man wearing a black suit step out of it. The man looked at him thinking he was Peter and smiled at him as he walked over him. He took off his sunglasses and put his hands on his hips.
Maybe the problem was that he didn't know him that well. All he really had of him, was an old picture and blurry memories, he never really gave a personality to the man in the photo.
"I'll let aunt Pepper know then,"
"Come on you little smart-ass just because the plane has your name on it doesn't mean it's going to wait for you."
Peter repeated the same words that his father had told him when he had asked that very same question.
"Just do it!"
Ben took one of the fries and dipped it into his chocolate milkshake
He passed the plastic container to his nephew.
Ben brought the scissors closer to Peter's head and closed his eyes before he made the first snip.
"I have no idea what you talking about"
"You are something else, kiddo".He shook his head and chuckled, he pushed Peter forward."What do you think?"
"Promise?"
"I was supposed to be in a meeting today, but then I thought I own the place, so I can ditch if I want to."
"...Did any of them get ruined?"
Ben's lip started twitching
"You can't use that one anymore".
"Yeah, totally fine, promise"
He shook his head and sniffed
"Hope so".
He took a seat next to the crib, even managing to close his eyes for a brief moment before his son woke up with a thunderous scream.
"Trust me, I do".
"Oh no, spidey."
"Isn't that the point?"
Ben was shaking while holding the picture close to his chest. just like Peter was, as he started walking towards him.
"You ain't that cute," He said as he got up but his husband immediately wrapped his arm around his waist, hugging him from behind and rested his head on his shoulder and Sam placed his hands on top of Bucky's and smile sweetly at his husband.
Natasha said with an agreeing nod.
The rest of the night was very uneventful. The two were half watching the movie as Ben told stories about camp. Ben felt ten times better, after that talk/cry with his dad, he still had a lot of questions but at the very least he wasn't overwhelmingly sad and anxious, he rested his head on his dad's shoulder as he could feel himself getting sleepy, it had been a crazy day.
Peter unfolded his arms and smiled at his twin, and for a second he forgot about the hang-up he had with his contact lenses.
this time Peter nodded his head.
"I'll show you"
With his arrival at New York City is Mission has started, now taking a Bens Place Peters job is to figure out tell their parents and why they broke up but the most important mission is to spend time just Pops pretending to be a completely different person proves to be harder than expected, especially considering that his actions are raising eyebrows all over his new house.
"You heard the boss".
Ben got up and started walking to the door, Peter didn't get up he just followed him with his eyes.
"I know right!" Miles replied.
"But you will have to wear them".
"That's us!"
"Slightly," He said with a smile, Ben did the same as he guided him to his room, or better said Peter's.
"What if it wasn't your dad?"
"I can't say that I do."
"For the last time I wasn't avoiding him, I just didn't go because I had a cough for staying in wet clothing too long"
He said in a low voice trying to pump himself up.
"You know when someone says they're fine a lot, it usually means they're not actually fine, are you sure everything is okay?"
Wait did Ben really stare at random strangers for a really long time and make up stories about them? his twin was so wired.
"Well, you don't seem to have any bruises, just be more careful, alright, son?"
"Remember what we talked about,"
Peter interrupted as he held the picture close to his chest
"Nat, please don't encourage this".
"Excuse me Mr. I think you dropped this".
Johnny ran towards him, tackling him.
"Alright, if you find someone I'll go on a date".
Peter was basically bouncing in place before attacking his twin with a hug.
Peter pocketed his phone and rushed out of the bathroom
Ben asked sounding nervous.
"Good boy" Happy gave in and smiled at the kid. "eh, guess I'll miss having you around, after all, you're the only one that can get your dad out of his lab when he's overdoing it."
"To be fair he always does it with a purpose" She leaned forward."So who is it, and what's the story?"
Peter suggested as he channeled a bit of his dad in an effort to sound cool.
"The story behind this, from what I know you hate having your haircut"
Ben said feeling ashamed of what he had done.
"Peter, take out your other eye contact, don't worry I'll help you get around"
On a red light, his dad turned to him with a curious smile on his face. "Well, it sounds like you had fun". He reached out to ruffle his son's short hair.
When they got to dinner he ran towards the bathroom he needed to put in his eye drop, asap,
"Sweet Christmas, that's cold. I'm sorry we weren't there to help."
"Yeah, but to be fair he's been like that since I was a kid", He said with a shrug.
"Aww, it's nice to see such a loving dad".Â  A random woman spoke as she watched them, Peter noticed how she was looking at his pop's hand. "Single dad?".
The apartment had a simple layout, it had three bedrooms, one was used as storage/office space, a kitchen that was next to the living room, and one bathroom.
"Tell me, how was camp?"
The picture was a little blurry, the first thing that caught his attention wasn't Peter's dad, it was the robotic arm wearing a Dunes hat. But once he looked past it, he could see a man in the background, it was hard to make out what he looked like because of the quality of the picture, and also the safety goggles he was wearing obscured his face, but you could still tell he had dark hair, and it looked like he was tinkering with something.
"My middle name isÂ  adventure," He said ecstatically"
"Well, I have to go annoy my husband now."
"Also what if we put these back in the deck and we grabbed new ones?"
Suddenly Peter got an idea in his head.
"Okay, okay"
"But I don't really ask my pop's about him, but I do have a picture," Ben said with a beaming smile.
"Yeah," Ben said with a shrug, Jarvis pulled him away hands still on his shoulder.
"I have goosebumps right now... Let's do this on the count of three, okay?".
"We're like twins, Benny"
They started batting, Peter instead that his pops and aunt went frist, he wanted to see how it was done, Steve and Nat hit every ball that came their way when they were in there, it was a pretty cool view. Then it was his turn. When it came to sports Peter had his strengths and weakness, for example, he could do a perfect cartwheel (He was looking to master the flip next), climb any rock wall that you put in front of him and he was fastÂ  but he had no eye to hand coordination, he looked like an alien that was put into a human body and couldn't figure out how arms worked. add to the fact that he was tired and flinched every time the ball came near, well let's just say it was a miracle that he only dropped the bat once.
" I'm actually prepared for that".He ran out of the bathroom and came back holding a pair of black glasses.
Steve pointed out.
"I love you"
"But those memories are super blurry and whenever I ask my dad about him he just says he loved me but he had to leave, that he'll tell me more about him when I'm older, you know the classic grown-up response."
Just got home, BTW why didn't you tell me Pops is like a superhero!-PPS
"No...I mean...no, not like that".Peter bit the inside of his cheek, the way his dad was talking reminded the when he spilled the water on himself. "What I meant, Ben was that we knew what to do when the other was sad or what would make the other laugh, you know?"
"Thanks, Kid" Luckily Bruce wasn't looking straight at him he was still busy getting everything from the floor.
"Check!"
Peter's face felt numb from grinning so much, he couldn't keep his eyes off his dad, this was almost like a dream, except for the knot in his throat, that forbid him from responding more than two-word answers to all of Steve's questions.
He didn't cry that night, he sat there, Obie's hand on his shoulder, squeezing it a little too tight, as the doctor gave the news. He apologized as if he had anything to do with it.
" Are you okay? your looking paler than usual?
Peter's jaw fell
"Okay, kids there's nothing to see here! We have more activities to attend to so Peter...I'm sorry, Ben, apologize, and Ben... I'm sorry, Peter, I am so sorry. You do the same, so the two of you can dry off, alright?"
"Grandma?" He looked down at the picture once more."She does look like you, well if you were blond...and a girl,"
Tony said as he brought down his sunglasses and smiled at his son.
He quickly took a bite of his own food of his burger. He heard the bell attached to the bell ring he turned around and noticed Bruce was leaving, he let out a sigh of relief thinking that the hardest part of the day was over.
She crossed her arms and smiled at him." I'm going, to be honest with you, kid, you never stood a chance".
Â¨I'll just rest my eyes for a second...So, not going to sleep Â¨ He thought to himself as he closed them, still trying to stay awake, concentrating on his brother's voice.
Peter was flabbergasted, how could she know and could she trust her? even if he could he didn't have much of a choice, so he did what he was told.
Before you go  I want to address t the Obadiah part, I know  gave  off a very strong  grooming vibe but I didn't put any warning tags because it was something I added  last minute and I'm not going in that direction but I understand if it makes people uncomfortable  so if you think I should add in the tags please let me know
Miles asked out loud as Peter open the cabin door and waited for his two friends to exit.
"Yeah, this place has a few of those, when you signed you can call an exterminator".
"Don't close your eyes!"
He said as he pushed back his fake glasses.
You know if these boys to take a second to sit down and talk to each other they would have avoided this whole mess, huh I wonder where they get that from?
He made a gesture to the mountain of luggage. They both grabbed on and started to pull. But even with their combined strength, it wasn't enough to get it out.
"Third night of the mission, anything to report".
" Unless you find out that you guys are actually triplets".
"A lot of things, we were separated for a while, your dad was in the army, did I ever tell you that? and while he was a lot of bad stuff happened"
"But-"
"Come here".He pulled him in for a quick hug.
"I thought you were almost a pre-teen"
Ben picked the picture up.
"How about whoever loses has to jump into the lake at night... Naked"
"No!" Peter responded with the intention of correcting him
"Can I look with you?"
"If you tried it you wouldn't say that, I used to think it was super gross too but then my p-friend convince me." He corrected himself and ate his milkshake fry.
He usually tried not to take his work home, so his full attention would be on the boys but sometimes it was necessary plus it kept his mind busy.
"You know, I never did show you those new pieces, how about tomorrow we head off to the studio
Peter looked down at the floor and went back to his spot. He couldn't help but think about the isolation cabin.
"I use you as an excuse to eat this stuff."
"See you soon Stark".
Fair warning I kind of lost my beta reader when I wrote this chapter so I apologize for the horrible grammar and misspelling, I'm fixing it but still if had I apologize
Ben handed peter five cards.
"Godfather" hit him hard, if this man was his godfather it meant that he was...
The two men were staring at him with raised eyebrows before they shared a look. "Sure thing"
That whisper was all it took for everybody to start running in different directions, and with all the commotion that was going on Peter got caught in the Stampede of children forced to run, but the worst part was that someone accidentally kicked Ben's clothes into the lake, without anybody noticing, not even himself. He started to swim up to the shore, only to see the approaching flashlight, he quickly jumped back into the water, and hid under the deck, not wanting to get caught. When he finally managed to get out he was shaking like a leaf, he desperately looked around for his clothing only to realize that they were nowhere to be found. Fortunately, he managed to find his towel, he grabbed it and wrapped it around his body as rage started to fill up inside of him.
" Wait, can I ask you something, how did you know I wasn't Ben?"
They both stared at each other, before breaking into laughter.
He got out of the car and headed for the trunk to get the luggage out.
"Is that, you admitting defeat?" Peter teased
"...Hi"
What Ben didn't know was that right as he hit the water a flashlight could be seen from afar.
"Oh yeah, she'll, call you later don't worry"
"You already let me sleep in, plus I want to have breakfast with you," He said with a sleepy smile as he sat up.
" You are, and we are going to comfort our parents and find out what happened!"
"But, I still don't get it what happened?"
He said in a loud whisper.
"Look, will finish this later, bye"
As the busses arrived at the campsite, Ben was the first one out, practically leaping out, eager to join his peers and stretch his legs, something much-needed, after the long bus drive. He hated sitting still in a car for that long, but it was worth it. Ecstatic to be out of New York. While he loved his home, leaving it behind was something he rarely got to do, and on top of that, it was the first time he got to travel alone. Ben felt like he was starting an adventure. It reminded him of the biannually camping trips he and his pops took. The first one at the start of summer, then again, right before school started, although, they only left Brooklyn for those, regardless, it was one of his favorite traditions. However, this year, things were different. Recently, his Pops, or better said his pop's work, had become more popular, and by default, more in demand, therefore busier. And in between finishing his new pieces, getting ready for his upcoming gallery, and finding a better studio. His pop's plate was full. In short, no beginning of summer camping trip. While sad to see it go, things weren't all bad. His pops had managed to find this place last minute, something he was incredibly grateful for, and he still had the august trip to look forward to.
" Morning, Maria". the boys said in unison before Panic struck all three of them.
" We don't have much time. your dad will be back any second, don't worry just put it in the case and ill get you a new pair tomorrow"
------
"I..missed you too." Peter got a good look at his godfather, he had long hair that was tied up in a ponytail, stubble on his chin and if it wasn't for the incredibly warm smile and carrying eyes, he had the look of someone you would actually hire to actually kidnap and kill someone.
"We're gonna meet our dads!"
Steve said with a cough as he tried to recompose himself
"Wait how was that a curse word?...that explains so much"
Suddenly the atmosphere in the room changed Bucky's eyes widen not knowing what to say while Steve almost choked on his drink.
He reassured him.
That he didn't know, he figured that they weren't around anymore, considering that Peter never mentions his grandparents, but it didn't change the fact that it made it sad to hear. He then tightened the hug.
"Not to brag, but I have known him longer than that. We were younger than you when we got stuck with each other, so, yes, I have plenty of stories, although for some of them I have to wait until you're a little bit older in order for me to tell them."
He showed off his hand "I have a full house."
"... then what happened?"
he ordered him.
Steve gave him a firm look. "Ben, don't lie to me"
"Oh, my god are you okay?!" Ben called out and ran to the ledge, looking down at the boy that he had pushed off by accident. Sure, he thought he was going a little hard on him, considering that he had the unfair advantage that he knew some basic fighting moves from his dad, uncles, and aunt. It was nothing too extreme they were very basic moves, but still, not all the kids could claim that they were taught how to fight by three ex-military men and the most badass person who ever lived.
Peter took his glass and jugged it.
"So, this is what betrayal feels like?" he let out yet another yawn "oh, that's cool we always do stuff like that and...um almost midnight?"
Peter remembered that guy from last years Stark Expo and he did not like him, Jhonny even said, he gave him and he quote "Creep vibes", and now he was sending stuff to his dad? he didn't like it but he is sure it was nothing, right?
Peter was looking out the window, noticing how his arrival had caught the attention of a few campers and even some counselors.
"You sure, buddy?"
"Check"
"I mean it "
He wanted to yell out in glee but before he knew it, he was already running into the car, with his dad holding him tight.
" you know if you two need to talk I can take ben in".
Happy ruffled his messy long brown curls and said his goodbyes. The boy watched him drive away, waving until the car was out of sight. He took his bags and begun exploring the camp. He spotted a boy carrying a backpack that looked to be just as big as him, if not bigger, a bunch of kids screaming and running around, counselors desperately trying to keep everything in order it looked... fun, for a plan B camp. It wasn't bad. Even if part of him was still upset that his plan A didn't work out. Which was attending science camp alongside Ned and MJ, like the last two summers before. Normally his godmother would have signed him up, with no problem, but it seemed like a being in the higher up, was working against them. Starting with the fact that the final deadline for the application got clumped together with the last week of school, as well as Stark Expo. From there it all went downhill. Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. From Peter getting sick, an actual fire, and almost losing a prototype. Fortunately, by some miracle, they manage to pull it off. Altho, despite their efforts, that day still became infamous in his household as "The day, Virginia Pepper Potts-Hogan, forgot to do something" In the chaos, they missed the deadline, and even with his dad, pulling the "I'm Tony Stark" card It was too late to get him in. And that was the story of how he ended up here. But it wasn't all bad, after all, he wasn't going to be completely alone here.
The thing about his pops, was that he was kinda strict about his diet, nothing too crazy, he eat regular things, and snacks were encouraged, (He rarely took them, but that was more of a him thing) Â He was like that about a lot of things, something about kids needing structure, and other stuff, he didn't go overboard or anything,Â  he just wanted him to eat healthily and all that jazz, sometimes they had take-out, but that was only when his pops got too busy to cook or when his godfather wanted to surprise him, his pop's had even gotten angry when he overdid it, so, junk food to Ben was somewhat rare, so he was enjoying this.
He hugged him back and pet his head.
Ben suggested sounding hopeful that Peter would say yes.
It's 13 years later and everything happens for a reason
he ruffled Peter's hair again.
he continued to flip through the pictures but he came to a sudden halt when he noticed something. It was the picture of a woman holding a baby, she was very pretty, well dressed with blonde hair, it was weird Ben had no idea who she was, everyone else so far he recognized from the chart he and Peter made, except for her "When was this taken?"
"What's happening!!"
" All I ask is Mercy from a weak stomach so no more gross ones"
There was a long pause.
then jumped into the car he could feel his heart racing, he was just a car and plane ride away, and if he waited for 11 years, he could wait a few more hours.
Tony looked up, he was surprised to see him but signaled him to come in.
"So, I'll skip him, now Jarvis is basically our grandpa, but you have to be careful, because if he or Pepper figure out our plan, then it's game over. Now my dad is always up, he doesn't really have a morning routine, but if he isn't working in the lab then he'll sleep."
The first day, they weren't allowed to go on the regular activities with the rest of the campers, so they spent all day unpacking and shooting hateful glares at one another. While not exchanging a word. The night wasn't any better. Peter was reading on his bed before they were forced to turn off the lights but Ben had decided to go to bed early, so he turned off the lights without a warning. Considering the Peter was under the assumption, that he was a sore loser, who threw a tantrum every time things didn't go his way, this only made him angrier at the other boy, so he placed his hand on the light switch that was on his side of the room and turned the lights back on. This action also didn't do anything to change the idea, that Ben had about Peter. That he was just a spoiled, little rich kid, who thought the world revolved around him. So once again, he turned off the light, this cycle continued until the light bulb finally overheated. As the room fell into darkness, Peter let himself full onto his mattress and murmured in a frustrated voice.
He pointed at an old sketch, it looked even older than the one he had on the walls of his room. The drawing was simple, it was just what looked to be a younger version of his dad sitting at a windowsill with his attention on the city below him, it wasn't very detailed but it was still an incredible drawing.
"Dad is one of the funniest, smart, caring, and loving person, you'll ever meet, yeah, sometimes he can't make it to stuff because he's super busy, but he's always making it up to me by spending an entire day with me, and telling me how proud he is, he tells me that a lot, he also keeps the paparazzi away from me, because he says he wants me to have a taste of a normal childhood, and he always says goodnight to me, it doesn't matter if he is miles away he always says good night."
"Something like that?" She said with a wink.
He smiled at the drawing of his aunt, going back to his much more playful tone.
The whistle blew and the mystery opponent wasted no time in attacking Peter with his sword.
On their way up Bucky came out of his own apartment.
"Go get your glasses" He did just that and handed them to her.
Before his Pops finished that sentence he heard the last ball get shot he turned around only to get hit with it and seconds later the ground.
"Is Peter the pauper or the prince?" Miles asked
Peter sprang up from the ground and started shaking Ben.
"For the Man who has everything and Â is impossible to shop for"
"I'd like that".
"I'll see you guys next summer, okay? And hopefully, we'll get to hang out more".
"Yeah, but that doesn't mean--"
Ben yelled as tears flooded his eyes.
He put away his phone and gave him a warm smile.
"Are your parents divorced?"
"I didn't know who he was, I just saw this boy, with the most curious eyes, I've ever seen, I didn't even think about talking to him, I just started drawing, he saw me doing it, but he didn't say anything he just smiled. something about your dad had this tendency of Faking smiles, but when they were genuine, it would light up to any room, don't get me started the sound of his laughter it was the sweetest sound...it just...wow" He let out a sigh, the memory of Tony came to him. " You know? he used to tell these jokes, I didn't understand but pretended that I did because it made him happy, and I got to hear that laugh, "
"I know buddy, but as I told you, I can't tell you the whole story right now but I do get why you want to know more about him".
I really am grateful for all of you, you guys make my day and I love you all but I want to give out a special shout-out to
Peter ran off and came with a stool and placed it down where he was standing."Why don't you finish it?"
"Inside and out, seriously, Ben, I'm the one with the glasses which obviously means that I'm the smart one."
"Of course it's me, as far as I know, you only have one super awesome uncle," he said, spinning him around.
"Come on, I saw this cool game, I want to try it out before we eat." He got out of the hug and ran towards the game, but he turned on his heels and faced his dad."I missed you like crazy too."
."Hi, aunt Natasha, it's nice to see you"
He nodded and cleared his throat before getting up and straightening out his uniform, he then offered his hand to Tony.
"I know that".He paused and grabbed a cloth and cleaned the wet paint off his hands ."Okay, let's play a game, say the first thing that comes into your mind, no hesitation just say it".Peter panic and blurted out."Who do you think would win in a fight bigfoot or Mothman?"
"Sure, this one?"
Once inside his dad put him down and Peter's eyes were suddenly filled with wonder.
He would have given it more attention to it if it wasn't for his dad's hand on his shoulder.
"Hothead, always a pleasure to see you! "
"I don't think it was from a company, it was a photo frame with two pictures, one was of him and his dad when he was little and the other one was of him and you"
"Thanks, uncle bucky"
"Deck of cards?"
Steve said shaking his head."Also, this is a two-way street because the day you and Sam have kids that's when I'll have my revenge "
"Nah, you're more in the hundreds"
this wasn't weird, it wasn't working.
Happy kneed down looking concerned for the boy.
Ben replied with a giant smile. It was just the two of them right now. Pepper had taken something to go and went to eat with her husband who was keeping an eye on them from afar.
and with that Peter ran off he said goodbye to the counselor and boarded the bus , as he took his seat , he did the math in his head, the camp was located in Washington , which meant that it would take the bus about 4 hours and 30 minutes, not counting stops to use the restrooms to reach Brooklyn, and counting the three hour time difference that means he would get there at 3 a.m., and that's where his pops would be greeting him.
He took his son into his arms.
Peter yelled when he noticed what the other boy was doing.
"Do you want to play?" Ben offered, mostly to be nice but Peter's presence made him tense up. He didn't know how to feel around him, and the fact that when the two of them were together, they always caused a scene, only made him feel even more uncomfortable. He tried to ignore it and focused on the game.
He thought to himself. Everything was close, Far and blurry all at the same time that's when he realized one of his contacts must had fallen out.
Luke was leaning against the bunk bed, with his arms crossed as he listened to the story.
" Oh, no". Peter's mind raced to try to think of a way out of this mess.
He had stopped fighting, and just let the tears roll down his cheeks, as his smile got even wider.
"It was Fun! at first, I wasn't sure if I would like it but in the end, I'm super happy I went". interestingly enough with his aunt, he didn't feel too nervous, like he did with his Pop's and uncle, in the beginning, it was easy to talk to her maybe because just like his uncle Sam, he knew that adults he trusted, trusted her so there was no reason to be shy plus her aunt had this energy about her that made it easy to let your walls down.
" Times like this I resent Barnes for getting married being your fake spouse exhausting, especially when you should be going out on a real date, come on I know plenty of men and women who would be perfect for you".
He clapped his hands and look down at the clipboard, where the boys had signed their names, to double-check that they didn't have the same last name, but it wasn't even close. Peter had signed as, Peter.S Parker, and Ben as Benjamin Reilly Rogers.
Happy didn't hold back and gave him a big bear hug, after a few seconds he pulled him away hands still firmly on his shoulders "If anything happens, just insist that they call us, despite their hippie-dippy policy, okay?"
Ben handed him a stack of photos.
"Hey, what is wrong with you?!" Ben yelled in anger as he splashed the other boy.
"That's Star Wars, right? You know, I never actually seen any of the movies".
He was looking over some of his own notes, of his latest reason why his dad didn't disown him, or project, as his mom helped him tidy up.
"Just bad stuff....like he thought his best friend had died"
Steve jumped into the conversation.
" I can't believe we pull that off without anybody noticing, is it just me or are we left unsupervised a lot?"
"This is so freaky".
Peter took off his glasses and put them on Ben.
" No, we're not, we're getting payback, " Peter said determinedly, he tried getting up from the ground but immediately went back down. "Right after we take a million-year nap, ouch. "
Ben looked around too and spotted a taller than average, dark skin boy, wearing a yellow shirt and gray hoodie. He watched as he walked up to a different but just as big pile and proceeded to get his backpack out with ease.
Steve reached out for his son and placed him on his lap.
"Ben, not too close I don't want it to bite you". His Pop's called out as he made his way up the stairs.
"Fine"
"Still parking, keep that on, well, mostly missing you, but I did finish those pieces I was working on before you left."
" We had a little accident in the batting cages"
"He's as clueless as your pops, I just told him to keep him distracted for a little while, no questions asked"
"Dad, I'm almost a pre-teen, I don't need a stuffed animal to sleep"
Luke just patted his friend Danny on the back, "Don't worry about it, will go easy on you, but in an off-topic question, did you bring any money with you?"
"No, it's okay I'm sure it can wait".
Ben looked down at the photo focusing on the younger version of his dad.
"You shouldn't stare at people it's kinda rude and creepy, pops"
"...I guess I'll see you around?"
She spoke in her cool soft voice while grinning at her nephew
'HOW TO FIX?' in bright red, and all caps
"...Crazy, huh?"
"Well I'm surprised that gum was the only food-related incident you had, considering all the snacks you took. I was worried that you made your cabin into a bear magnet."
"Haha, very funny."
"Even if it's about your pops" is dad hugged him tightly." Is that why you been quiet all day, you wanted to ask about him?".
"Don't worry if it does I'll find another weakness"
"Thanks,"
it'd be cool being the taller twin, Ben thought to himself, and if he was, he would never let Peter live it down.
Luke gave Ben a sympathetic shoulder pat as the rest of the campers started mocking him, as Peter started packing up his winnings.
Tony bit the inside of his cheek and tensed up, he didn't say anything he just continued to work.
Ben grabbed what was left of his previous winnings, and put them into the pile, as he did Peter took off his glasses, so he could clean them, but given what they were doing it gave the wrong impression.
"And what time is that?"
He said in a playful tone
One fateful summer day as rain poured outside of their cabin Ben and Peter discover that their two broken families fitted perfectly together and they decide that they had been apart for far too long.
Peter finally turned around and it took a second but he recognized the owner of the second voice to be his uncle Sam.
Happy parked the car and sent Tony a text to notify him that they safely made it to the camp.
Ben said as he said goodbye to Luke and Danny.
The rest of the kids started teasing peter but he didn't have a reaction.
That was enough to get the taller boy's attention. Luke waved at them before adjusting his backpack that was now hanging on just one of his shoulders and made his way toward them. "Danny, where did you go? I was looking for you,man"
That night, the two boys had stripped the sheets and mattress off their beds and build a fort.
"You are my little boy, a prince with chocolate eyes so curious and wide courtesy of dad, chubby cheeks and rosy lips that come from me-"
As Peter reached for his dumplings, his phone went off like crazy, he got it out and saw that Ben was texting him non-stop.
He cleared his throat
"Also, if you don't get that much information from my Pops, you can always ask Bucky, they've known each other since they were our age, if anybody else knows what happened, it's him."
She fondly rolled her eyes but smiled at them
"They're identical" or "wait, so they're twins?"
"Tons."
"So, do you know how to play, or do you want to have a practice round first?"
"It's not but I like the attitude".
"That bus ride must have given you quite the appetite, huh?"
"Yeah, she is, come on sport", He said patting Peter's back and lead him downstairs"
" And was the name of your Aunt who passed away May?"
"Um...Arcade then"
Here the thing I accidentally deleted this chapter but at the bright side I could edit  and make less you know god awful and it adds more information about the boy's family three and how they were adopted  but I do plan on going into that in future chapters,  yes there is going to be new chapters I promise I'm just  turtle when it comes to this things,
"Surprised Morning inspection, kiddos, get ready!".She yelled in the megaphone and head towards the oakwood cabin.
"Come on guys, don't give up so easily. Do I have any volunteers?"
"Anthony! if your father really had built someone, it would have been you."
Ben played with his food for a bit before he continued
Peter's eyes widen in a panic.
" There's no reason for you not to come in, right Peter?"
Steve looked ahead to make sure the light didn't change before turning back to his son.
"Well, I only have the dad, and my Pops used to be in the army, but now he's an artist, he has a studio and everything it's really cool."
"Does he still play the piano?"
" T.Stone? honestly, I don't know, could be anyone or thing like a company, dad gets lots of stuff like that but he always throws it away, what was it?"
"Ripped down the middle?"
"...How long were you married?"
"Sounds great!"
"Ignoring the fact that you two are in cahoots, I should let you know that Nat might have found you a new place "
"I was just looking through them to make sure nothing else was missing, don't ask it's a long story"
"And Will never wear, check"
"I am?"
Ben nodded but his gaze was glued to the floor."Who were you talking to?"
"I am a wonderful influence, right Benny?"
Ben responded with mischief in his smile.
"...yeah why?"
"You know it's still not your bedtime, we could watch a movie or something?"
It was funny at the start of the day he couldn't picture his pops and dad together, but now? it was clear as day, he could even imagine much more than the version of them in the ripped up photo, instead, he pictured the four of them, but not in an L.A, in his mind they were in Brooklyn, in the apartment, he and Peter would probably share a room and just like in the isolation cabin he would have to wake up peter twice. His dad would probably greet them both, by ruffling their hair and say something that would make them laugh while pops would make breakfast and give them a warm "Good morning".
"Um, that's okay I think they won't be coming back after last night, I made sure of it but I promise no more sleeping in the closet"
"I think so?"
he said in a hush.
Ben said as he continued to dip his spoon into his melted ice cream, but Happy was looking at him with a raised eyebrow.
"Yeah, but they're also really fun...Anyway, thanks for helping me..."
It was still a little bit longer than Ben's, but for a second, he almost forgot he was looking at in the mirror and not the boy.
" What, come on a kid when I first showed you this you loved it".
Ben got up and pushed Peter away.
" Yeah, they were playing poker and Buck bet his prosthetic arm, and he lost it to her, she did give it back... Eventually"
"Okay, think this goes here and this...here?"
"Would you settle for us buying you lunch?.
He confirmed before getting a good grip of the now infamous yellow duffle bag.
"Are you sure your okay?" His pops had asked for the millionth time as he kneeled down to examine his face.
Peter let out a giggle as she did this, maybe Ben just wanted to scare him and his godfather was just bad at poker.
"How did you--"
" No, wait."Peter singled to Johnny and Miles, to stay hidden as he ran to stopped her from going in which earned him a look from the counselor.
"It could be Nathaniel, but know don't worry I'll settle for lunch, plus I also like your name, Benjamin".She said putting an arm around him, bringing him close, and kissing the side of his hair.
"Aunt Nat?" His pop's friends really like the surprise entrance.
Peter said with a warm smile as he talked about his dad.
"That same day, your grandpa introduced us, No, not right away, Do you want to know something? Even though I was drawn to your dad right away, I didn't fall in love immediately, that took a bit of time but looking back now...he still made me fall pretty quickly."
"Try me."
"Not long, a little over 3 years, you want to know something silly I did?"
"Well, your a kid, to you 25 is 80, I must be a few thousand Years to you,"
"Do you want to cut your time?"
"I told you not to call him that!"
"You sound like pepper!"
"Gross, what is this!"
Steve walked over to him and it looked as if he was thinking about it.
She looked down at him, she was very pretty, with green eyes and red hair that reminded Peter of Ariel. He suddenly remembered how Ben had warned him to be careful around her but she seemed sweet, he didn't see why she could be so dangerous
Peter ran over to Bucky and hugged him tightly.
"What did you do"
"Crazy enough to work, and we're twins, after all. I really want to meet Pops, come on Ben, all or nothing!"
"A lot of people think he's a jerk, and make jokes that he doesn't have a heart, but that is not true not even a little bit."
Ben was right she was good and he had no choice, he grabbed spidey and took a deep breath "Alright... It all started with them sending us to the same summer camp".
"I'm back, sorry for the backpack thing."
Parents always try to do the best for their children but more often than not they would make mistakes.
"I do, but I don't wear them, I hate them"
"Ben, what have I told you about staring at people?" .His dad had broken his train of thought.
"Mine was an accident too, I slip when you gave me your hand"
It was like his head and body were on two complete schedules, On top of that, he never got to put in his eye drops so his eyes felt dry.
"Ben is your birthday by any chance August 10th"
"Welcome home, you two."
Peter was visually confused by his Dad's question. He looked around the car as if the right answer was hidden in plain sight.
"Benjamin Riley Rogers?!"
"When did you become such a coffee expert" A female voice spoke and Peter jumped when he felt two hands on his shoulder and a chin resting on his head.
"Hello, Nat," his dad said with a warm smile.
"And That's your Pops" she signaled him to take off and hide the glasses.
"Nope, this was my idea and I lost, I'm going through with it"
"Oh, no,"
The kid who had recently lost stood up and shrugged in defeat.
"Hallelujah, the curse you and Barnes had him under has been lifted"
"No, there are only four houses but you can be a combination of two or more or you can be in just one house but have tendencies of another."
"I can't wait for puberty to take your cuteness away"
When he approached the edge he tried not to think about it too much, only stopping to pinch his nose and close his eyes, before jumping, he hoped if he did it fast enough it would make it easier but the second, he hit the water it felt like being inside of an ice cube, it was so cold that it stung his skin but he powered through it, going as deep as he could.
Peter gave him a thumbs up.
Peter protested.
"Okay, Dippy, this is what you have to know. My house is pretty big, but for now, we'll just focus on my room, the lab, and the garage."
"No!". He took the toy from his dad in a panic.
"Go or your going to fall asleep on the couch, I'll be up there in a second".
"No, trust me, kiddo that wasn't the issue, that...I was still very much in love with him...that part...that part was certain, but the timing was wrong, but that one was on us, after all, we got married when we were too young"
And in case your wondering, yes that was the last time Tony saw his parents
"You're lucky your too cute to get mad at, welcome home kid" He looked down at his sweat-soaked sweatshirt."I would offer you a hug but maybe when I'm wearing something less...wet and smelly"
Peter took them and put them in their places.
"She's amazing!" Peter said beaming.
Steve's smile moved to the side.
Ben said with a shrug
."Hey, Nat, yeah that was Ben, he's been back for a few days why don't you ask him yourself? wherein the old studio, yeah, Sam told me...okay we'll see you there" He hung up the phone and smiled at Peter."Ready for another adventure, sport?"
"I should have gone to Science Camp."
- ---
Tony reassured him by taking the other man's hand and squeezing it.
" Yes". The boys replied with their heads hanging low.
"Me! I want to try"
" Hey...you want a cookie?"
"And delay my four-week vacation free from you? No way"
Steve said with a chuckle and instead of telling his son to let go he just wrapped one arm around Peter's waist and with his other free hand, he lifted the luggage and got up from the ground, and started walking towards the car.
he wasn't sure it was there or after the third conference, or the 100th piece of paper he was handed, but he had shut, down and he knew two things. A,Â  he was never gonna finish that later and B, he had a feeling he wouldn't keep that promise after all.
That night the boys skipped dinner by faking a stomach ache. They put pillows under the blankets and broke into the kitchen and the arts and craft closet to get supplies for their master plan.
"Like always, you'll be the first one to see them, don't worry, but first we need to unpack your things, and then get you something to eat".
He tilted his head, that answer only raised more questions."What do you mean?"
" I'm sorry! I'll keep them open, just, calm down".
"Yeah, right!"
"Better?"
"Will do,"
That response caused the other kids to complain and start challenging Peter to actually bet them, and maybe, it was the fact that he was secretly really competitive, or just plain peer pressure or both. That caused him to say what he did.
As they looked through the photo album Ben would occasionally ask where it was taken or what was going on that day, but tried not to do it too much so his dad wouldn't get suspicious, he noticed some of them were obviously taken by Peter but the other's was anybody's guess,
He said with a smile
"I owe you".Â  His Pop's let go of Peter and relaxed
Peter put on the glasses and looked down at the ground while playing with his hands
"Peter?".He asked sounding concerned for him but hearing his brother's name instead of his own made him shut down even more
"Hey, Benny, come here I got an idea". His uncle kneeled down and whispered something into his ear, Peter didn't fully get it but he agreed.
Ben nodded his head as he processed this new information."Okay, okay, new plan, all the counselors are going to be at the staff meeting today after breakfast, right?"
"That's a hard question to answer but I can tell you this, it wasn't because he didn't love you,you were his world you b-really where, trust me that day we both made the hardest decision of our lives, but a lot of different things happened and we thought it be better if we split up, Unfortunately, you got caught in the middle of all of this, and I'm sorry for that".
"Stop"
"I'm going to put a pin on this, you finish unpacking and I'll go see who's at the door" "Okay,"
"Alright"
He looked up to meet the owner of that voice. Who was a friendly-looking, blond boy, wearing a tie-dyed t-shirt, and who was offering Ben his hand to help him get up.
By the way, I also arrived, sorry I didn't text you right away we were out getting food, you were right, dad is funny!-BRR
"Jarvis is washing him".He said quickly because he knew Peter had it.
He handed his pops back his drink who was looking at as he had just started speaking French out of the blew
"You noticed, damn it, I thought I was being sneaky."
"An arm?!"
"I'm fine," He said muffled
"How long does it take you to finish a painting?"
"Don't kidnap my son".
"Go to bed," his dad said as he turned off the TV and got up from the couch.
His Pops started to laugh.
Ben looked at him with a raised eyebrow ,as he hanged the camera around his neck.
"But in the meantime, Ben, do you want to hear about the time he almost got us banned from Coney Island because of his weak stomach?"
"...Wow"
"It doesn't, but for obvious reasons, Peter is the Prince".
"And now we're here... Are you going to tell him?"
Peter said shoving the last of his Oreo into his mouth before taking another one.
Two young  men swore internal love to each other in a improvised wedding and  and even though their love was pure and true in there  wedding vows they made promise to each other that they did not know they wouldn't  be able to keep
Peter looked down
"Ben, don't encourage him."
"But still, the time difference can be a pain, the few first days of camp, I collapsed the second I saw my bed and it happened again yesterday, I took a long nap when I got here". He laid down on the tub.
The nerves were getting to him again, he started playing with his hands, eventually bringing Â it close to his mouth, with the intention of biting off his nails. But was stopped by the sound of his father's voice.
" Sounds fun."
"I know, but I promise, I only didn't once."
"What about you, what do your parents do?"
" No thanks, I'm out"
" You are a genius, Ben!"
" Um...something like that".
"Do you trust him?"
Peter had to admit that Johnny was right, sure it was no science camp, but this place was pretty great. They had lots of games to welcome the new campers, the food was pretty good, and overall he was having fun. He did, however, have a few weird encounters, for example.
"I'm decent, so if you're good and I'm good, how about we make this interesting?"
members, I mean who does this kid think he is?" Ben said getting a little worked up.
"Wait does that make you Mable?"
The two boys gasped, as they brought the two half closer together.
"Got it!"
After the campfire, everybody who was present for the poker game sneaked out of their cabins, and headed straight for the deck, for the big event. Everyone except for Luke and Danny, who had been caught outside their cabin by one of the counselors, when they tried to sneak off and were forced to stay behind so they wouldn't raise any suspicion.
Peter punched him on the shoulder.
"That's another thing you keep calling me pops."
Ben looked down at the ground trying not to give away how sad he really felt, he didn't even notice when the car door opened.
and maybe after that, grab lunch after, just like old times?"
"It's never a bad time for a burger."
Oh no.
Danny smiled when he saw who Ben was referring to.
"I'm all in! But if we're going to do this we're gonna do it right."
"Alright, but just a small one", He said as he handed him the cup." careful is hot".
"Did you not love him anymore?"
"I'm just curious".
"Yeah....where are you going with this Rogers?" Luke asked sounding intrigued.
He watched the woman's smile curl, he glared at them but for a second he saw the woman's eyes widen as if something had scared her. "Well congratulations,"Â  she said hastily before walking away fast as she could. he looked up at his aunt and she winked at him, okay, maybe she could be scary but he was glad the woman was gone.
"See, you know me kid, I'm more familiar with middle earth than this, but from you tell me, I think I'm the other way around."
"Couldn't have said it better myself Benny, also are you okay?". Peter asked worried for his brother remembering the strings of texts he had gotten the other day.
"I'm sorry too, but it's okay, after all, I turned your cabin into a sticky spider web, I think we're even."
Ben could make up an entire backstory for a stranger in the street, but when it came to his dad he couldn't figure anything out. His mind just landed on blanks, when he thought of him, he was always his other dad, his other dad who played piano, his other dad who had to leave, and who he desperately wanted to meet. And now that he was here, it was more like meeting an important celebrity instead of meeting his father. Peter had warned him about his dad's icy exterior, but assured him that it wasn't real. So Ben just had to get to know him better, but he wasn't sure where to start.
they both shouted as they ran in to get him, Steve soon scooped him up from the ground and ran to the nearest bench and placed him there.
The rest of the evening felt a bit awkward, and Peter didn't really leave his uncle's side, as he built up the courage to continue with the mission. But The time came where his lifeline had to leave.
"This is my dad".
Peter quickly put his phone away and sat down on the edge of the second story, his aunt soon taking a seat next to him.
" Why are you in my closet?"
"Yeah! which one is yours?"
The two 10-year-olds said at the same time, both eager to start the duel.
Ben pointed at the drawing of his dad, as he explained this to Peter
Peter grabbed his spider plushie and held it tight.
" I think you're an evil genius, and that we're definitely adding it to the mission".
Peter nodded, and now, instead of shaking he was basically frozen.
"Peter, you're freaking me out here."
She quickly reached for a small bottle of hand sanitizer and squirt a little onto his hand.
Peter pointed out. The two of them were building a board to keep track of all the members of their family, and the facts they have to remember if they were going to make this work.
" Were they really that alike?"
"Hey, I do cool stuff all the time, in fact, in my other camp we built rockets, can you top that?"
"I'm glad that you made a friend but that doesn't change the rules you can text him after dinner"
He took a deep breath and tried remembering the advice his dad had given him.
By the time they sat down to eat, he was now glued to Bucky's side talking about the first thing that would come into his head, as Bucky nodded and joined in when he actually knew what he was talking about.
Ben tried to get out of bed, but he got caught in the string and ended up falling on the floor that was covered in syrup, he looked up just as a water balloon was coming right at him, he managed to roll away before it hit him. "Hah!"
"Are you sure, dad is very protective over my picture, this is so weird"
"Tell you what, help me clean the table, and I'll throw in a bash of fresh cookies to the offer" "Race you to the kitchen!"
Peter yelled out his voice still shaky, he started biting his nails and stayed in the car a bit longer.
Ben asked looking very intrigued.
Ben lifted his cookie as if he was making a toast with it, extending the olive branch to Peter.
"I'll hold you to that".
"Even if it's about my other dad?"
"Wait, you mean right now, but dinner is not for another 30 minutes?"
He left the fort and headed for the third room and came back shortly with an old-looking notebook and sat down next to him.
"No more running into walls got it" Peter gave him a thumbs up.
"We should focus on the fact that we just got fucking married!"
"Probably". He did overhear Ben tell his friends that he would see them next summer but he wasn't sure." By the way, this place is awesome...wait does that mean I have to change my name to Natasha?"
" That's crazy!"
Peter pushed his glasses back and crossed his arms over his chest.
"Why are you nervous?"
"...I'm sorry"
"Your dad told me about your odd behavior even before we met, you sleeping in the closet, Spidey,Â  and all that, it didn't help when you called me Natasha, Ben never calls me that only Nat or Tasha, and despite him getting anxious in cars he can sit still for a long time" She put her arm around him."You really can't, Spidey, You bite the inside of your cheek, your dad used to do that" She whispered into his hair. "On top of that you kept rubbing your eyes, that's when I noticed the contacts and you panic when you saw doctor Banner, You took a new photo every other minute, your hair cut, I could go on for days ".
"Because I saw your face when I told you the rent price?"
"Did...did you used to sing lullabies to me?"
Ben looked at him with a raised eyebrow and wondered if this was his tale.
"Probably a rich kid who thinks the rules don't apply to him," Luke said in a huff
"You know the rules no phone in the table"
" I missed you so much".
"No problem, kiddo."
Johnny looked up to see what his friend was talking about, and when he laid eyes on their cabin he froze nearly dropping Peter.
"That one? a lifetime ago, I was afraid your grandma Maria might steal my baby, she refused to let go,"
"Wheres Spidey?" Tony asked as he tucked him in.
"You haven't been able to sit still this whole time"
"1, 2...3!"
"We missed you".
Peter yelled in excitement as tears started to flood his eyes.
" I don't mind you dating pops, in fact, why don't I set you up?"
It was only after he sent those messages did he noticed the time, Peter was three hours ahead, he was probably having dinner right now, and with Pop's strict no-phone rule, would make it impossible for him to pick up. He felt so alone. He just laid in the bed watching the hours go by, at one point Jarvis knocked and asked if he needed anything. Ben only responded with a no thank you. it was still relatively early and he didn't want to be left alone with all these thoughts and feelings, that he couldn't even process, he got up and started walking around. After a while, he started thinking that this maybe wasn't his best idea, because he ended up getting lost.
" Ben, that story you told me, that's my story, I was adopted, I even had an aunt who loved me more than the universe!" he put his hand on his head and took a deep breath
"Morning boys" A brunette woman greeted them as she spoke through a megaphone.
" I know, not bad for a 10-year-old with a shaky hand, huh?"
"Afraid your gonna lose?" Ben teased.
"Nothing, your father will shortly inform you".Jarvis gathered all of his clothing and putting them all in a basket."Don't worry about it, my boy"
"I promise not to call" His pops but one hand on his chest the lifted his other hand, making the oath to his son."Didn't know you were quite the spider-fan, buddy"
"And that's my pops!"
Peter said while lifting his palms upwards.
"I'm sure"
Peter made a noise and clapped his hands, before swallowing his oreo.
Ben said as he put the picture away and turned off the lights.
"There you are!"
"I love it," Peter said gleaming as he looked at the finished work.
"My dad caught me staring at it way too many times, so he decided to just give it to me, I know...It's super silly but I always have it with me".
From there everything was white noise to Tony, all he registered was that wasn't related to his parents was that Jarvis would look after the kids as he went to the hospital.
"Eww," he said while laughing as he read that last text, he put the phone aside and closed his eyes for a second.
"Ouch, are you okay, little guy?"
"No, I want to hit it at least once!"
Steve had kneeled down the instant he saw his child running towards him, he was waiting for him with open arms and when he was close enough he pulled him into his arms for a loving, long-awaited hug.
"Normally around 6:30 or 7:30 a.m"
"I don't know."
Peter looked at him as if he had grown a third arm on his head
Tony replied with the same ease and sweetness as the other.
His dad grabbed a tissue from his desk and clean the tears of Ben's face, who by now was a little bit calmer
"Um..ugh..uhh..yes, yes, that sounds good"
Ben, panicked but luckily for him, the seat belt light came on which means that the plane was about to land.
" No! Think about it are dads spent all this time and energy keeping us apart, I mean just look at our last names for crying out loud, so we should make it hard for them too!".
"Whatever happened had to be really bad, just running away like that it doesn't seem like my Pops."
After their awkward first meeting, and intense poker game and a series of misunderstanding Peter and been found themselves in the middle of a prank war.
"Thanks, for this"
The other eagerly took his hand and stood up.
"Okay-I mean, I'm not, I don't wear, who's Peter?"
"Or maybe it's like a prince and the pauper situation, where he's just someone who looks exactly like you, what? don't give me that face I like Disney"
"Yes," she smirked and started walking, she turned around and signal them to fallow her.
"Hey! What have I told you about east dropping?"
He held him tighter
"What gave me away?"
But when he saw that this kid was fast and quick on his feet he decided not to hold back, but apparently, he took it too far, when he delivered his final hit.
" I'm sorry... It's just you can't go in there because, because... One of the kids is sick! And it's a mess, you don't want to go in there, there's puke everywhere and it's sticky things...and just really you shouldn't go in there."Peter was clearly panicking.
