“Belova confirmed hostile operative,” Tony whispered into the mic, doing his best not to distract Bond from the work at hand. “KGB, Black Widow. No surviving associates. Proceed with caution. And use your mouth, she likes it better. Spare a finger for her ass and finish her off, I have other work to do.”
Pepper could not explain Steve’s unusual request, so Tony had no context for their meeting until the time that he sat down at the table across from Steve and saw it writ on his face, clear as day.
This time, Steve seemed to hear him. The combative ferocity in the Captain’s expression faded into a quiet determination that bordered on looking defeated, but eventually he nodded in the affirmative. Tony turned back to the steering column and engaged manual drive again.
Bless his trusting heart, Steve hadn’t even pressed for a location after Tony told him it was a surprise. Tony had told him it was private, a weekend off the grid for hiking in the wild outdoors away from the rest of civilization. No electricity, no wifi. Despite all odds and rational explanations, Steve promised he’d only be happier that way. Tony chose to believe him.
“Listen, I know this place, it’s not far, they do these ribs that’s insane, just falls off the bone—”
“Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark,” Chief Fury rumbled in a tired, displeased tone. The chatter around the room quieted into a startled silence as the confrontation grew louder. “I monitored your disheartening and distressing comments to Lieutenant Robert B. Banner. Your fascination with the boorish disorder of the 21st exhausts my patience. You are setting a subpar example for sworn officers and personnel. Do you truly long so fondly for chaos and disharmony? I promoted a silver class officer to lieutenant, and this is how you repay my trust?”
Tony gave him a long-suffering look that spoke volumes of how little he worried about Steve’s promises. “Steve, we’ve been over this: I know you’re good for it. It’s just money, we’ll figure it out.”
“I feel optimistic about your appetites this year,” Tony casually replied. “The Rubens seemed to me lonely without a second ribbon.”
Steve pursed his lips in distaste. How much faster could they have gotten to this point in the investigation if Hammer had just cooperated with them from the start instead of discounting their theories outright? “That’s… convenient. So, where is Richard Kline now?”
“I guess you can keep it,” Tony said with a quiet sniff, but as soon as Steve smiled back at him, he couldn’t hold back his own answering smile. Steve never shied away from reminding Tony how much he mattered to him, and Tony never tired of hearing it. Without fail, his heart felt like it would beat out of his chest from happiness
Most of the six kids in his group guessed variations of “hot!” and “sunny!”, and Tony told them all they were correct.
“Before you ask, I got the tequila,” Tony answered the phone with a big smile. “Coolest mom ever, by the way, I’ve never heard anyone ask for tequila.”
And somehow, against all rational counterpoints, Steve could feel himself swooning. He cleared his throat and tried to clear his head. Twelve years on the force, and he was a damn good detective. He was better than his teenage fantasies.
Tony gaped in surprise before he dissolved into a delighted peal of giggles, practically folding in on himself on the couch beside Steve. He might have tried to say something—he thought maybe Tony was trying to say his name, but there was no way to tell what were squeaks of amusement and what were recognized words in the English language.
Steve had stayed as long as he could, but once Howard was removed and Happy installed himself in the apartment lounge, he had left for work with the promise to return once he wrapped up his regular patients. They would count on him to be there.
The phone vibrated in his hand as the call came through. He watched it buzz for two, three, four seconds as he braced himself, cleared his throat, then connected the call with a swipe of his thumb.
Steve floated on air to the lecture hall. This was why he hadn’t run into Brock before, obviously - fate only let it happen now that Steve looked his absolute best, because fate wanted them to be together.
Steve needed a second—and a quick glance at the headboard—to remember where they were. “Appears so,” he grinned, far too delighted. “I helped put it together, too. Are you impressed?”
Steve pressed his lips together in a blatant attempt to resist smiling back, but it shone through all the same, his whole face warming as he smiled. He tried to hide his face against Tony’s leg, and Tony laughed before he could help himself, tugging gently on his hair to encourage Steve to bring his smile out of hiding.
If he didn’t know any better, Tony would have guessed his friend looked afraid, but that wasn’t his Steve. Steve Rogers jumped into any stunt with gusto. He faced crowds of thousands with infectious confidence and walked into every meeting with a warm smile and a firm handshake. Fear itself would know better than to mess with Steve Rogers.
Steve was still laughing too hard to do anything but giggle and wheeze, but Tony took the album out of Sarah’s hand to hold it up at an angle that let the sloshed drink spill away without touching the pages. He unwrapped his scarf and wiped at what little booze remained on the cover, drying it off before handing it back to Sarah.
“I’m five-nine,” Howard added without looking away from his paper, and Maria looked so pleased about it that Clint and Tony both rushed to plug their ears.
“One stopped code in penitentiary parking lot,” it announced in its gentle, sedate voice. “Doctor Helen Cho. Would you like to assign a coroner?”
Steve pouted down at the clean load of laundry he’d just thrown into the dryer, as if it would somehow yield answers to life’s craziest riddles. What level of Hell did sons who wished their mothers butted out of their lives end up in, for example?
that many days, it was a smaller part then. But let me tell you: every time I saw him, as often as he could, Steve would moan about how this was it, he was done. Loudly. Obnoxiously,” he added with an accusative glare at his unrepentant co-star. “No more Captain America, no more Captain America movies. So, when Coulson called and said they were interested in bringing me back for number four, I thought it was a prank.”
“Is it though?” Bruce pointed out, tilting his head back to look up at Tony curiously. “You put it on pretty thick today. You think you’re gonna get a reaction out of him worth writing about if you keep going like this?”
“I—ma’am, wait!” Steve called after her, but it was no good; Maria didn’t listen, and before Steve got to his feet, she had disappeared into the house, out of sight.
“007 is being cleared for active duty as we speak. He’ll want leads on Scorpius. Explosives haven’t gotten anything out of it, but, since this was what got you hired in the first place,” Bucky reasoned, “I thought you might have more luck.”
“Don’t you need medicine? Nurses?” Tony asked while helping Steve out of his loafers. “Steve, it was a
“Help yourself,” Steve called after him as he stepped into his jeans. His skin was still a little too damp, but he managed it eventually, and was mostly done lacing up his boots by the time Tony returned.
“She didn’t have to. I heard enough from her conversation with you the other night,” Tony growled with a new gust of rage. “How Women are so much better than men; what good would a man be, when one could choose a Woman?”
Bucky jumped to his feet and made a dash for Rumlow and Steve’s tussel, while Tony crawled across the floor on his hands and his feet, pressed as close to the floor as possible to avoid a stray bullet. He was halfway to Pierce’s desk when Pierce finally threw Ben aside and turned the gun on the wild fight between the three men. Bucky managed to wrestle Rumlow away from his best friend and tackle him to the ground, pummeling his face, leaving Steve rocking on his feet and panting for breath.
“Don’t try those cow-eyes with me, Rogers. I’m not dumb enough to be the one to break your diet. Captain America doesn’t have love handles,” Tony reminded him with a smirk, dropping one of the plastic bags in Steve’s lap without further ado. “Eat up.”
Without so much as a pause or foreplay, Steve sucked the head of Tony’s cock into his mouth, pushed forward, and didn’t stop until his nose pressed against Tony’s pelvis. Tony nearly choked on Steve’s name as he cried out in his surprise, his body arching off the mattress and clapping his thighs together around Steve’s head in an instinctive reflex. Rather than pry Tony’s legs apart from the grip he had around Steve’s head, Steve scraped his nails down the side of Tony’s thighs. The sensation sent shivers of pleasure down Tony’s spine, and he groaned his pleasure between attempts to catch his breath.
All of it! Playing with cotton candy was so much fun, it was so soft and fluffy! And Tony was pushing it back at him, that was even more fun! They could play in the cotton candy forever and, see, Tony was even laughing now, his cotton candy was magical!
“Only when medically necessary,” Steve promised with smile, and across from him, Tony snickered as he pulled the car through onto another road. “I’ll eat anything twice.”
“Steve—please,” he whimpered breathlessly, tugging feebly at Steve’s hair until Steve relented and released his cock. “Fucking—you’re, fuck, you’re
“He said he’d keep the search live for two more weeks,” Tony continued after a beat, clearly unbothered by Bruce’s threat. “So now I have two weeks to write a fluff piece women will like.”
“Steve, I think it was her,” he whispered urgently. Distantly he knew it could be the bloodloss talking, but in that moment this delirious epiphany felt more real than his own bones. He needed someone to tell Q or Bond; he needed someone to
Steve agreed and watched Tony leave. It took Steve an embarrassingly long time to realize he was staring after Tony even once the door had fallen shut behind him. Thoughts moved like cool molasses through his sluggish brain as he tried to pull together a plan of action. He needed a quick rinse after his flight, no question there. Jeans were always good, casual and classic. And October in New York was an excuse to wear clothes for warmth, as opposed to LA where ‘fall’ was still an abstract concept.
For one delirious moment, Tony was convinced Steve’s cock pushed up against his diaphragm to leave him breathless. Steve release his bruising grip of Tony’s hip to reach around and jerk Tony off. The first stroke of his strong fist had Tony’s eyes rolling back in his head, and Steve stuffed four fingers into Tony’s mouth to gag and distract him from shouting. Tony gurgled around Steve’s thick fingers, drooling and trying to express to Steve this mad wave of pleasure overwhelming him when his orgasm took him.
He groaned inwardly at the terrible wordplay he’d subjected himself to, however true it was. Screw Superman, Tony wanted Steve, even if it meant abstaining from sex.
Pierced raised his brows, and in his implacable serene way, turned to gaze up the barrel of the gun at Steve. “Tell me, Captain. What do you plan to do with that archaic weapon?”
“You know, I was thinking,” Steve said, ever so casually. “Maybe we could let that be enough econ for the day? Maybe… we could go see a movie?”
It wasn’t that they never talked. On Thanksgiving, Tony had ducked out of a family business dinner early to make that first call to Steve. Their conversation had been stilted at first, Steve struggling to restrict himself to only using Tony’s given name, and Tony fighting back tears. What he wouldn’t give for the freedom to ask Steve to forgive him, to take him back. The freedom to leave Stark Industries behind and live his own life, pursuing his own projects and sharing it all with Steve.
Unrelated fun design fact: Portugal also handled their problem with storks nesting on poles guiding power lines really fucking well (imo) -
“So empty, Steve,” he whined into the cushioned back of the couch, his eyes barely focused anymore as he drooled into the plush velvet fabric. “Need you, baby, been so long, Steve, need your big cock inside me—”
“Sorry, didn’t mean that,” he somehow apologized without laughing himself hoarse. “I’ll be right here with Netflix all night, okay?”
Friday didn’t pull any punches. Tony woke up to two voice mails from Steve: one that said he’d been delayed and would not be back until the following Saturday, and another to apologize for not wishing Tony a good weekend. Steve wouldn’t pick up when Tony called him back before work, but it was all for the better, probably, since Tony could barely find his own feet.
Steve and Peggy were early to his 10am, and Steve was passing the time by scrolling through his favorite posts on
“No, of course I told you a—my mother told me if I didn’t appease investors, if I didn’t, if I wasn’t like Howard, they would invest elsewhere. They don’t want the handoff to rock the boat. Without their investment, tens of thousands of families would be out of an income.”
Somewhere between headlines disagreeing about Jennifer Aniston’s newest beau and something about English royalty, Bucky saw Steve. The photo was grainy, unposed, and poorly lit, but it was so clearly Steve glaring into the candid photo with Tony wrapped in his arms.
It didn’t matter how many showers he took, Tony never felt clean. His skin felt too small for his body, itchy and dry no matter what vitamins he took or lotion he used. The discomfort was a constant distraction; nothing felt right. He would hug his mother even though it felt stifling and irritating, he would smile and shake hands even though his face ached and his fingers wanted to curl into protective fists. But he was Tony Stark. If he couldn’t keep up a charade, who could?
Tony glanced down at his hands again, this time busying himself by rubbing his thumb over the plastic label on the bottle until it came loose and peeled away.
” Tony started to say, but thankfully someone came up to offer him a bow and quiver before he gathered too much steam. He shot Barnes a withering side-eye before remembering that he was in public, and quickly did his best to restrain his flare of competitive indignation.
“Everyone is talking about you,” Steve murmured proudly between kisses, as if Tony’s career could ever mean more than their life together. “This is the time you should be jumping on different projects, new opportunities, not waiting on me—”
Steve grimaced, because Tony wasn’t wrong. “It sounds so bad out loud,” Steve muttered. “But that’s… I can’t help it.”
Sometimes, on the hazy cusp between lucidity and his dreams, Tony believed he could smell Steve in the thick fabric of his sweatshirt. Not the spicy, clean scent of Steve’s cologne, but the natural musk of his body, the memory of his sweat. Maybe to others it would not be so adored, and most would roll their eyes at his childish hope. Steve had not worn the sweater in over seven months, and while Tony refused to wash the hoodie, nothing could last forever.
The day of Tony’s defense passed much like Steve had predicted: flawlessly. Looking back, Tony was pretty sure he could have stood there in silence, lined up all the awards he had already received for Dum-E, and stilled graduated with the highest distinction.
Steve gathered both of Tony’s legs and squeezed them together, lifting him by his ankles until Steve could kneel at Tony’s hips. Gently, he eased Tony down again before releasing his legs, letting them fall open over Steve’s thighs. With one of the many gloves and canisters kept on hand in their nest, Steve warmed up lube between his fingers and started working open his pet, spreading the lubrication as deep into his body as he could reach.
Unless Stark had convinced himself there was a benevolent twist to the argument. Maybe the father really was an uncaring man who had no interest in his children, and would rather be rid of them instead of suffering a long divorce himself.
His legs fell open easily, and as he was wont to do, Steve stroked Tony’s cock until it jutted up against Tony’s abdomen, firm and leaking from the tip. With Tony practically writhing in his arms, Steve moved on from his pet’s cock and cupped Tony’s exposed balls in one hand, fondling them leisurely for his own pleasure. Steve kept Tony hairless for harvesting; it made everything easier, and on the occasion that Steve spread Tony open to inspect his pet, he would always stop to marvel at how delicate and silken Tony’s skin felt in his big paws. Reverently, Steve cupped and rolled Tony’s balls in his hands, rubbing soothing circles over his testicles with a slow, tender touch.
Steve frowned into his empty glass, then glared at her. “What’s that supposed to mean? I’m not rich enough?”
Tony must have looked about as offended as he felt by the suggestion, because Carol made the rare effort to gentle her voice when she continued Rhodey’s train of thought. “There are good restaurants in Boston, you don’t need to fly to Paris.”
Steve blinked back at him for a minute, frozen in the act of shrugging out of his jacket. “Is this where you tell me you’re already married? Two-point-five kids, house in Hoboken?”
“Sam had a bromergency,” Sharon said with a wry smile, not once looking up from her work. “Remember the super hot blond with the biceps? The one that makes you look normal?”
That night, happy, pleasantly tired, and warm, Tony drifted easily into a comfortable sleep. Steve slept on his back and Tony always tucked in close to the crook of Steve’s arm with his head pillowed on Steve’s bicep, sometimes on his stomach and sometimes on his side. From the first night they had shared a bed, they slept in the same way, Tony shielded by Steve, with Steve’s arm wrapped around his body so that his hand loosely cupped Tony’s hip or his ass. Their habit was born of a jumble of different feelings. Sexual interest, romantic impulse to be close, the darker, possessive desire to hold on even as they slept. For Steve it was reassurance. He had lost enough of his family to unseen danger, and now, his most basic instinct was to keep Tony close and safe.
” Tony demanded when Steve didn’t continue talking fast enough, and he dropped his coffee on the nearest flat surface before he accidentally spilled or broke it. “Steve, what—what did you—”
The truck pulled around to the back of Taco Bell when Steve reached the ground floor. He pushed his way past the handful of people in his way, rushing so he could keep it in sight when a motorcycle skidded past. The rider swung a heavy chain at Steve’s head, and for the first time in this century, Steve felt alive. For the first time, he knew what to do; he knew who he was and what he needed to do.
“Not us: you,” Steve corrected, again taking Tony’s hands in his for a gentle squeeze - but this time he didn’t look away from Tony’s eyes, searching his expression for any sign of doubt. “It can be this house, or if you don’t like it, a different house; a boat, a ring. Whatever you want, it belongs to you. But when I look at this place, I think of your mom who doesn’t like New York winters, and my dad who never takes vacations. I think about the dementia in mom’s family and all the ways she could keep active here at any time of the year. I think about hosting a Christmas where we can actually see our parents and Alma’s family at the same time. We can have our wedding here; the place comes with its own chapel. We can host our friends on holidays, or just get away when LA is too much.”
The creature swallowed down every drop greedily until there was nothing left and Tony started to squirm and try to pull away from the continued stimulation. A stern word from Steve made the creature release Tony’s cock and sore balls, and soon after that, it left them without another word.
“Your friend thinks he can just use people and spit us out when he’s finished just cause he’s got money? Well, tough titties!” Bucky shouted at him, “nobody’s taking advantage of my best friend! Not on my fucking watch.”
He brought his arms up around Tony’s body again, cradling him close without squeezing too hard. “This is not an argument, Tony,” Steve whispered, lowering his voice in his effort not to sound too stern. His husband was not a soldier, this was not an order. A partner was not an equal if Steve could so easily dictate his choices.
He swallowed Steve down until his nose bumped against his hip. This was no time to sleep, not with all the people buzzing and chattering around him, but Tony closed his eyes, burrowed in close, and let the world fade away. All that mattered was the task given to him, and to make his master proud.
“I recall Taco Bell did not cater to your expectations. If I may redeem the night,” he said, holding out the platter to make his point more clear, “please allow me.”
When Bucky finally interrupted him, it was to address the pilots of the royal guard who had followed Tony in the initial response. Steve knew that Tony had dismissed them after Air Force reinforcements arrived, but the Iron Legion had clearly elected to disregard their king’s instruction.
“It depends on what stage of evolution you’re talking about,” Tony was saying before Steve could find a way to get Bucky’s attention.
Steve blinked his eyes open and turned to Tony with an unformed question in his expression. Tony immediately quieted. What were the odds that Steve hadn’t heard so much? But as Steve pushed himself up to lean against the cushioned headboard of their bed and pulled Tony with him, his thoughtful, attentive look quickly put Tony’s last hope to rest. There was no doubt he had heard every word.
Everything had its place and its purpose. The only thing Tony couldn’t figure out was the eight foot tall mirror in a beautiful, gilded frame, propped up against the corner wall behind the couch. There was enough space between the couch and the wall that Tony couldn’t have reached it even if he tried, but that didn’t mean he understood why a tired, morose reflection of himself was judging him through the mirror.
What Tony wouldn’t give to have lived in Metropolis when Superman lived among them on a daily basis. If he’d only been born one generation earlier! He might have even met Lois Lane, had the chance to shake hands with her, the reporter who’d first planted the seeds of investigative journalism in his dreams, and how any journalist worth her salt wouldn’t take shit from anyone. Lois Lane inspired more of his life choices than Howard ever had, because not only did she tear down the bullshit year after year, but she landed the sexiest, most heroic man to walk this planet. Except, of course, Superman was an alien. Most of Tony’s teenage years were spent debating whether Superman
This time, the shock was numbing. Tony couldn’t hear the laughing gulls anymore, or feel the chill of the ocean breeze on his skin. Whether he wanted to or not, he couldn’t move a muscle or even breathe as he watched Steve go down on one knee.
“Let’s; you haven’t led me astray yet,” Tony reminded him happily. “Can’t wait to see you tonight, boo.”
Tony’s mom’s words pulled Steve from the safe space he had only just discovered, and he braced himself before turning to face her with a smile. He was ready to offer some polite greeting, some appropriate comment about her beautiful home, but whatever he had meant to say fell away.
Not that Tony could resist watching him walk away and disrobe, shameless in his confidence. To Tony’s surprise and mild regret, Steve wore a pair of swim trunks under his robe, probably in the event that Tony needed privacy to work. Steve made his way to the shallow, serpentine hot tub designed to look like a gentle brook which separated Tony’s office from his more leisurely reading nook.
He crawled a little closer to the other pets and laid down a respectful distance away. Tony guessed they were both somewhat older than him, at most in their mid-twenties, but it was difficult to tell in orange light. As they realized what he was trying to do, they both looked up to watch him. Tony scrambled to think of something to say.
“I’m coming!” he called from his bedroom closet, stepping carefully over overturned boxes of belts and shoes and bags that were decidedly
Steve huffed in amusement, and he couldn’t help but roll his eyes. “Yes, Tony: the rolls are happening. I already promised.”
Steve had never been so amused at being proved wrong. He grinned at Tony in return, and reached back to give his knee a pat. “Maybe next time,” he promised with a smile still in his voice.
Steve glanced around at the people lining up to volunteer for the game. “I don’t see any children,” he observed, then turned to Tony with a confident smile. “Give them no mercy, mein Schafes. For me and for the Rubens.”
“Your—Your Majesty? Is that really you?” he whispered in secret, as if he was communicating with a hallucination and didn’t want anyone to notice in case he was crazy.
“This has been the fastest twelve minutes of the day,” Steve agreed, and with a smile, Tony rocked his leg against Steve’s.
“Beretta, now with digital palm-printing, triggered when anybody but yourself attempts to fire the weapon. Digital prints are uploaded to our server within eighty seconds of the attempted shot, so long as the pistol is not submerged or buried in some way. The lip gloss is a fast-acting poison: a trace amount will hospitalize a man or animal of approximately 100 kilos, while a drop will kill the same body within seconds. It must be ingested to act to full effect; topical contact will only cause disorientation at most. The lipstick you carry may act as a protective layer for a short time, so if you paint your lips with the lipstick and add a minor coat of gloss, you may get away with it for a short while. Wash away with regular antibacterial soap. You already have the pills for poisoning, if you accidentally ingest some yourself. Finally,” he said, laying the pen on the block, “Barnes’ design: it has a sonic taser, a carbon dioxide laser, and an explosive package equivalent to 72 tons of TNT you can only use once. It has a surveillance component that can tail your target up to seven kilometers, after which point it will automatically return to the pen. It can deliver four subdermal doses: two lethal, two tranquilizers. And,” he finished, dangling the keys to the Jag. “Shiny new Jag, complete with pacifier seatbelts.”
The door opened and Stark strode out of the office without so much as looking at the interns (or Steve). Perfectly professional and poised, but Steve had hoped for a smile or look of recognition - anything to make him feel like he hadn’t made a fool of himself earlier that morning.
Steve looked down at his glass with a frown. There was no question in his mind why Clint would do such a thing, but just hearing more about how there were foster families out there who loved all their children made him bitter with envy.
Steve blinked at his phone, read the messages over twice, then quickly glanced up at the crowd milling around him. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but even as he tried to find Tony, something in his stomach curdled.
With a gentle hand at the small of his back, Steve directed Tony into a slight back bend that pushed out his round ass, highlighting their perky, round shape. Steve left him in that position for some time, even stepping away momentarily to give their shameless audience a view while he slipped a pair of lubricating gloves over his right hand. He rubbed his fingers together to activate the lubrication of his fingers, and he waited until it all but dripped from his hands before going back to where he had left Tony.
The surety in Jim’s voice comforted Steve even when he couldn’t understand what he was being asked to do. Somehow he felt like he’d know soon enough.
“I know it’s hard, man,” he said sincerely, rubbing at Thor’s enormous bicep. Thor barely batted an eye, let alone acknowledged him by looking at him. “I know she meant a lot to you, but… don’t give her this kind of power in your life. You barely knew her for two months.”
“—Gay is gay to people here! That’s all that matters. Homosexuality is illegal, do you get that? Four hundred lashes and who knows how many months in prison. I can’t leave my fucking room without an escort, for the safety of everyone around us. So I don’t look at another man the wrong way. Can’t you see what you’ve done?”
Steve frowned, but was fairly quick to comply: he crossed his arms and held on to his own shoulders.
Steve inched closer, and as the distance between their lips became dangerously tempting, Tony backed away. Steve wouldn’t let Tony get away, and he followed him at a collected pace.  “Then what about kids, Tony? How do you make them in your incredible future?”
“I was getting worried, Tony,” Steve lied, his grimace pulled into an unimpressed frown. “You couldn’t have called to say you were running late?”
The students wasted no time filing out of the lecture room, and Steve packed up quickly to go see his friend. He’d already kicked himself multiple times for not asking her name or for her number, because he was pretty sure if anyone would be a great addition to the Tuesday night hang outs at the Beauty Oasis, it would be her.
Steve pushed up on his hands and knees and moved to check the drawer, and he had just located the small collection of condoms when Tony sat up with a question on his face.
The two hopeful dogs obeyed Tony without any compunction, wagging their tails and desperate for validation, but Steve had many reservations about what Tony’s words implied.
” he sobbed, stalking to Steve’s side immediately as if hypnotized by the rolls. “What is—is that what I think it is? You’re—oh,
” Tony hissed, mortified. It wasn’t as if Clint had lied, but hell, he could have at least put it more nicely than that. To save himself the shame of meeting Stephanie’s pitying look, Tony stared down at his fried eggs and tried to shrug casually.
Or maybe long, frustrating work days brought out the pessimist in him. It was hard to tell sometimes.
“He said the divorce was for me, that he didn’t want to take advantage of me,” Steve explained, but even he didn’t seem convinced. “That I deserve better than someone twelve years my senior.”
“You’re not wearing a jersey either,” he whispered against Steve’s neck, his breath hot and wet over Steve’s skin. It was all Steve could do to resist squirming, or shaking Tony off. “Are you getting one, too?”
Slowly, focusing on Steve’s hands, his thick cock, and the quiet words he whispered in Tony’s ears in encouragement helped him lose himself in his fantasy. Removed from the real and present threat of the crowd around them, he started to feel out their rhythm more confidently, experimenting with different moments to squeeze around Steve’s cock until he learned what had Steve thrusting up involuntarily. A moan spilled from Tony’s lips, and he felt as much as he heard the crowd shuffling impatiently around them.
Tony’s phone rang a little before 10am the next morning. The ringtone was new and distinctive, and loud enough that Bruce and Thor could hear it from their respective offices.
He could have sworn he heard Steve chuckling in the distance. “Yeah? And why’s that, Stark? So you can lock me up for doing my job again?”
He only meant to deliver the plate then go back to get his own food going, but Tony was frowning down at his phone in a way that made Steve want to distract him. He had no interest in the phone, but he couldn’t resist sneaking in close to indulge in a moment of intimacy, first pressing a loving, unhurried kiss to Tony’s shoulder, then trailing a few more up his shamefully unblemished neck. Tony curled his free hand around the back of Steve’s head, holding him close and threading his fingers through Steve’s hair while Steve nuzzled into the soft junction of his neck and shoulders.
Steve stood up and without so much as a pause, he lifted Tony into his arms, holding him so Tony could wrap his legs around his waist. Steve got a firm grip of his waist and held Tony close as he turned them around and walked them to the nearest wall. His hard cock pressed against the cleft of Tony’s ass, and clearly unable to resist the urge, Tony reached behind his back to stroke Steve’s cock as much as he could reach him.
Forgetting his earlier soreness and any concern about his nudity, Tony leapt out of bed and ran out of the bedroom without so much as looking at Steve.
“You know this as well as I do, Graham, we Irish, we can only be mad about one thing at a time,” Colin said with a perfectly sincere expression, and Tony found himself grinning in delighted amusement. “Pots of gold, rainbows, yoga—”
Tony must have looked as articulate as a guppy fish the way his mouth opened and closed without uttering a rotten syllable. Opened and closed, opened and closed, until Steve only snickered and rolled away to grab his phone off the nightstand.
Steve frowned at himself through the mirror and, with one last look in the mirror and declared the whole look a lost cause. There wasn’t much he could do; the big S didn’t look right on him no matter what he did. Steve simply wasn’t made to be Superman.
Steve stared down at his phone. He had a vague idea of what he should do, and a very clear idea about what he shouldn’t do.
Twenty-first century etiquette differed from what Steve was used to, but he wasn't so dense that he missed the unspoken ‘better’ in Tony’s question. That didn’t mean he also knew what to say. Was he supposed to apologize? He wasn’t sure what he did wrong, but Tony’s smile didn’t reach his eyes anymore and Steve felt rotten.
“The computer identifies a trade or skill most suited to your genetic composition and selects one by cross-referencing all services projected to best serve society at the time of your release,” Tony explained again. “It takes into account your hormonal predisposition, your predisposition for certain injuries, your projected height—”
Never in his wildest dreams had Steve thought of divorce as something equal to marriage, but now he wouldn’t breathe for fear of missing a second of this new perspective Tony shared. He felt like a man who’d walked through life with blinders only to now have them taken off so he could see even more of the beauty in the world around him.
P.S. The person who leaked the nuptials to the Boston Gazette tried to confess, but Steve didn't want to listen.
Tony nodded in understanding. “Didn’t want to stand out,” he filled in, and Steve hummed quietly in agreement. “Go on.”
Without breaking their slow, steady rhythm, Tony bent over Steve’s back and pressed a kiss against his shoulder. “Breathe,” he whispered, easing his fingers out. Steve whipped his head up so fast he nearly knocked Tony in the head, but Tony was already straightening behind him.
Steve blinked at him in confusion. “I thought silver class adults were only restricted from getting married. There’s a bigger difference?”
Steve watched as Tony only responded to the children’s overexcitement with a warm, patient smile and thoughtful replies while he led them away in the direction of the park map. He gave them his full attention, spoke calmly and addressed every kid in turn, making it clear that he had heard every one of their little voices.
“Mom!” Tony glowered through gritted teeth, this time grabbing for Steve and pulling him down to sit on the bed so he could get his arms around him. “What the hell? What did I say about harassment?”
“Eight today,” Steve was telling him as he adjusted the position of harvesting machine, lining the arm up to Tony’s ass. It had a wide, rounded lip like a shoe-horn that Steve eased into Tony’s ass to keep him spread open as each new canister was loaded into him. As the first one slid into place and started fucking Tony from behind, Steve slipped the sleeve over Tony’s cock and strapped it into place.
To make it worse, Thor wanted to go all out for his friends with a suckling pig. He’d made it sound so easy, but it turns out that without Asgard magic, a pig needed more than 90 minutes to cook all the way through. Steve didn’t want take-out on a night he hoped would be special and memorable, so Clint came in clutch with plans for a comforting, homemade dinner.
In the far end of the living room, a poster of a distantly familiar man in Steve’s old USO costume was glaring back at him from a Captain America: The Marvel of Humanity poster. Steve couldn’t look away.
Steve turned on the automatic spin, but dialed down power from 10 to an 8, and then further to 7. On the first buck of the bull, Tony rolled with the toss easily, but at least he had one hand on the saddle now.
“If that’s how you react to flowers, babe,” he whispered hoarsely against Steve’s panting lips, “show me what you can do with me.”
“You have apologized. You’ve explained what happened. You’ve made meaningful changes in your life,” Steve listed, making a sincere effort to speak slowly and calmly, but he couldn’t ease his grip of his dog tags. “Sweetheart, there is nothing else I could ask of you. God help me, but I still love you, Tony. I think I always will. I only need you to promise me you won’t keep anything about your health or our relationship from me again.”
“You think I’ll miss seeing you in one of the most iconic roles of all time? I have three alerts set on my phone about it, I—” Steve abruptly interrupted himself and paused the video. “Did—did she just say—”
“No, even Stephanie wouldn’t say yes, Tony,” Clint said quietly, and inwardly even Tony agreed with that. “She’s not just a big, scary weapon. She was Stephanie’s friend.”
“One of the CERN administrators recommended it,” Tony told him, and Steve’s mischievous side-eye became curious again. “She’s from Greece originally and she said she comes here when she’s homesick. Then I couldn’t stop thinking about moussaka, so you’ll just have to suffer, because I’m craving Greek.”
Thunder rolled in the distance, and the promise of rain was heavy in the air. The stench of wild fungus growths and deep trenches full of sewer water clogged the humid summer night in a waxy and repulsive caricature of fresh air. Tony couldn’t have asked for a better conspiracy of good fortunes if he had tried.
“Steve Rogers, you were magnificent!” Tony cried in a burst of excitement, and, reluctantly, Steve gave up on Rumlow to face Tony. In his effort to keep up with Steve, Tony was struggling to catch his breath and even stand, but still his face shone with a beaming grin of excitement.
“I really like seeing people’s passion for something, whatever that may be,” he said, “usually people are performing, or to some extent aware of social etiquette and pressures, but those moments when people find a way to unapologetically be themselves and share something they love with you, it makes me feel… it’s this energy, it makes me want to sit there and listen to them talk about it for hours.”
Tony’s quiet giggling bloomed into outright laughter at Steve’s outrageous threats. “What does that even mean!”
“Mmm, sounds good… night, Tony,” Steve murmured as his hand dropped to the mattress and his phone was carelessly shoved out of reach under a pillow.
Tony eyed him dubiously, struggling to make up his mind. “...alright, you never heard this from me,” he finally conceded, “but maybe I am, a little.”
“I am most impressed,” Jane told both Steve and the two tailors waiting to address any concerns. “One cannot guess at the alarming size of your protruding musculature with this design. Even from the back you look less like a murderous meat-eating barbarian. Captain Steven G. Rogers,” she said with a big smile, “To the full extent of my expertise, I deem you officially prepared for your first dining experience at Taco Bell.”
The assistant brought out a little Dachshund puppy called Eli as Steve’s final and winning point of the day. Eli was half the size of Steve’s shoe, but he scrambled out of Steve’s arms to jump on Mango, and at that point, all the puppies besides Violet had taken over the couch in their mad play-fighting, dashing across legs and hands as they chased and tumbled into each other.
“What a marvelous display, Steve Rogers! You licked his ass!” he cheered, practically bouncing in place at Steve’s side. The Governor and his faithful assistant trailed after Tony at a much calmer pace.
“You’re not thinking this through. It’s a good idea because you’re informed of it,” Rhodey reminded her. “He wants to do this to Steve as a surprise. Hell, Tony, do you really want to spend your anniversary in your parents’ bed?”
“You know, you’ve never been more convincing. But why don’t you show me more so I can make a well-informed decision?” he said, handing Steve the key. “And, Steve? Just in case that wasn’t clear enough, your husband-to-be wants you to start this very important, intensely thorough inspection in the bedroom.”
The request was unexpected, and Tony frowned to himself before glancing at Steve again. He turned the car on autopilot so that they could speak more freely.
Steve could understand if they both saw the wedding as an impulsive mistake and decided to move on amicably. And when he was perfectly honest with himself, he could admit that he’d be (more than) open to agreeing that it was a lucky accident and giving them a chance. But he couldn’t handle the mixed signals. Tony felt something for him—something Steve badly wanted in his life—but Tony also seemed determined to undo their marriage. As time passed, his attempt to protect Steve from making a mistake sounded increasingly patronizing, and Steve wished he could pin him down and demand the truth.
Steve blinked once, feeling so blindsided and so confused he didn’t know what to say. All he could do was give Tony a critical once-over, but he couldn’t understand where, exactly, Tony was trying to lose weight.
“Just here to snoop around, then?” Tony guessed out loud. He carried the beers to the fridge after plucking two bottles out for them, giving her the time to do a circuit of the open-floor plan.
Some intrepid soul had gotten close enough to set to get a shot of Tony at an opportune moment when Tony was leaning to hear something Patty had said from her director’s chair. The tailor had taken no prisoners in the cut of that suit, and the shape of Tony’s ass was unmistakable.
Steve blinked back at him. He had never seen Tony malfunction before. Steve slowly moved his hand from left to right in front of Tony to see if he could get Tony to stop staring at him. Could the black suit be reminding him of Batman?
For one fleeting moment, he entertained the idea of sabotaging his own defense and staying on for one more year. One more year of his life together with Steve, being there for him as Steve finished his degree. That way Tony would even be there to see Steve in his graduation robes, stand in the crowd to watch him walk across the stage to accept his degree. His heart could burst with pride just thinking about it.
The next time consciousness intruded on Tony’s sleep, it was with a soft touch of his hair, lapping through it in a gentle rhythm. He smiled to himself and moaned quietly under his breath in appreciation.
As a final reminder, I did my best to tag everything for this chapter but there is a big chance that I've missed something. So before you continue, remember that this is a story where Tony is an underage boy who has been kidnapped for sexual exploitation. Nothing about this is kosher.
“Thank you, I love Mr. Fang,” she whispered, then promptly smushed her face into the plush toy and hid her blushing face against her dad’s shoulder.
“You think this is bad, you should’ve seen them gawking after my first Calvin Klein series went live,” Steve said with a sigh, keeping his eyes straight ahead. How’d he keep doing this to himself? “Sometimes I wish I could just shut up and fit in.”
“Single, no family,” Tony answered without pause. “Pepper is the only one, she’s my everything. I’ve worked with a few collaborators in the past, but not for those books, and never the same person twice.”
“Fuck you,” Bucky grumbled even as he rolled to his side and onto his knees with a great heave. Whatever else he might have said was lost in the thundering clapping of hooves as the cavalry neared.
Like Steve, she didn’t seem to have a herd of friends, but maybe that was how she liked it. That’s what Steve told himself anyway as he shouldered past the hurt and moved on.
Despite his partner’s horrified reaction, Steve’s logic made sense. Tony would never have considered it, but there were few alternative explanations for how Rumlow had evaded their overview of the city for so many days.
“Do not desist, Steve,” Tony told him, as matter of factly as he could breathless and giddy with drugs and happiness. “Kiss me.”
“Tony, get up here,” he called down before turning to hold his hand out, urging Tony to follow him. “This is incredible!”
Tony blinked back at him, nearly as taken aback as Steve looked. He racked his brain, trying to remember when he slipped and said penis; he couldn’t have—this was too important, Steve was too uncomfortable, he wouldn’t have been so blase—
Steve kicked the door shut behind them and practically tripped over his own feet in his rush to follow. They had stolen into a small janitorial closet, one with a small sink and counter space where all sorts of mops and cleaning supplies lived. There was barely enough space for them to stumble into, and even distracted by Aladdin’s trouble-making fingers and soft moans, mindful, protective Steve caught the small workstation Tony was rushing into.
“It’s not like that,” Bucky said quietly, and hangover or not, he looked wistful. “Q… had a relationship with the former Bond. His Bond died four years ago. I think it was the real deal. I don’t know what happened to him, nobody does,” he admitted in a quieter voice, “he disappeared, and his body was found later, desacraged. I think only H and Q know what was done to him, but I heard it wasn’t pretty.”
Tony felt Steve’s hands squeeze his waist gently in acknowledgment, a quiet sign of gratitude, and the relieved smile on Steve’s lips comforted him. But under him, Steve’s body still felt tense with questions he hadn’t voice yet. Tony waited with what little patience he had, combing his fingers through Steve’s hair absently and holding him close until Steve was ready to say more.
Color rose in Steve’s cheeks at the words pouring out of Tony’s mouth, and he ducked his head with a bashful smile. He took a moment to steady himself before he could look up and meet Tony’s eyes.
“Tony,” Steve said in the same quiet, cautioning voice that he used when he wanted Tony to stop worrying. “It is only the first week of December, we have time—”
“With all due respect: anyone but Barton,” Tony said immediately, but the quelling look Steve levelled on him quieted him at once. “Alright,
Late September in Harvard edged into cooler temperatures that encouraged most students to wear a jacket whenever they left the house. Steve had considered it, but even his favorite leather jacket would look awkward over armor, so he threw caution to the wind and walked the three blocks to the off-campus party in nothing but his gladiator sandals, leather pteruges, and scaled armor strapped across his chest that covered his right shoulder and arm. The strap across his chest and back was designed to framed his bare chest beneath his collarbone so the tension emphasized the breadth and proportions of his pecs to perfection.
“Chief, Code 1-8-7,” he reported, his voice frail and unsteady in the sudden crush of anxiety. “Murder-death-kill. Sir.”
“Can you picture me, breeding you? Filling you with more than my cock? Leave you gaping, dripping with my—”
“Not yet,” Steve replied in a playful sing-song, “Victoria said they’ll want to do dinner next time they’re in town. See,” he said, addressing the women, “I was working with them but something came up for their babysitter in the last minute, and Phil came in clutch. Took her to the zoo, they got ice cream. You’re pretty much her new hero,” Steve teased Phil before backing away. “And the next time I call, you better answer!”
“It’s your first time out in the country, Steve,” Tony huffed out, pulling up the bottom of his tank to wipe at his nose.
Steve froze inside Bucky’s empty bedroom. A part of him knew Bucky’s teasing had gone too far - he knew Tony was too smart not to put it together - but that didn’t mean he was prepared to confront it yet.
instead of a night-time date at a bar? Are you familiar with the concept of ‘mixed signals,’ Steven?”
Steve took a deep breath and tried to calm his tingling nerves. Focus on the present. Tony was still on the phone with the judge, so Steve used Tony’s distraction to his advantage to really look at the man whom he’d evidently married the night before. Even naked Tony was a striking man, confident and composed under pressure in a way Steve could only aspire to be. Shameless and helplessly smitten, Steve drank in the sight of his newlywed husband. In profile, Tony was a dream - from the elegant silhouette of his nose and lips, to the perky round shape of his ass. From the back his lean body revealed its strength in the shape of his thighs, his calves, and his sinewy shoulders, but it was from the front that he was truly breathtaking. Steve could have lost himself in those eyes, in the sinful promise curling his smile. Given half a chance, Steve could spend hours on his knees to see all the ways Tony’s lips exposed his passion further.
“I was offered the role in the eleventh hour. I loved the script, but Steve,” Tony’s words softened to silence at the thought of what Steve had done for him, and with a genuine, adoring smile, he tried to explain. “Steve was home with me that whole time. He turned down a lot of offers to do that, and he had a big project coming up at the same time. But he read that script and said I had to do it. He made that happen for me,” Tony finished, absently fiddling with the armrest.
With his food warmed and his book selected, Steve undressed and slid into the tub. The sixth chapter of Treasure Trail was his favorite, the words so familiar he could have recited them in his sleep. There, soaking in the warm bath and losing himself in the beloved pages of his book, Steve began to relax enough to relieve himself of the stress he’d collected all day long.
“You didn’t have to pay,” was all Tony managed to say as he adjusted his long-sleeved t-shirt and pulled his jacket on again. Steve meant to interrupt him, but something familiar around Tony’s neck caught the light just right and suddenly, Steve couldn’t stop staring.
“You said real but improvised?” he asked after a long stretch of reflective silence. “Could there be any legal issues there? Someone recognizing themselves and realizing what happened?”
“They tell me you are Captain America, or Captain Steve Rogers,” the old man said, his voice deep and soothing. Despite the scene only moments ago, he spoke without a hint of fear. “Your heroism saved the lives of myself, my associate, and countless museum patrons from a most egregious villain. I trust you cherish the peace and beauty of our perfect society as much as we welcome your revival.”
Without much fanfare, Tony pulled his shirt and his jeans off and climbed into bed with Steve. He had wrapped some of that ice from Steve’s freezer in a hand towel, and that was the extent of the romance they shared their first night together in bed: Tony pressed against Steve’s left side, pressing the cold compress against his bruised body, while they talked quietly together about anything and everything.
“Am I on glue here, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Brock?” Steve bit out, one raging word after the other. “We took the same LSAT, we’re taking the same classes—”
The soldiers readied and aimed their weapons as one woman leapt off her horse to approach them. “By the will of the King, you are under arrest for illegal en…” she trailed off as Steve found his feet and stood to face her. She stared at him with a sudden chill, then, stepping closer, she whispered, “...Your Majesty?”
Bewildered, Bruce blinked up at the Chief, then glanced at Tony as if his junior partner would know how to react. “Chief, I,” he stammered quietly, shaking his head. Tony had already stepped away from the terminal as Fury had demanded, but Bruce made no move to take his place. “What do I do? I don’t know—”
Steve’s buoyant excitement was infectious, his hope and optimistic vision for their future together so innocent and complete that Tony almost bought it, hook, line, and sinker.
Their server was immediately there with their waters, and Steve ordered the same burger Tony was there to eat. It almost felt like a normal dinner with a friend, until the server left and they were left together in their silence.
“I own real estate in New York City,” Steve told him, which finally seemed to give Howard pause. “Two apartments, one condo. Paid off; they’re paying my mortgage now. I’m eyeing a beach house in California as my next purchase. If you’re worried that my intentions are motivated by money, you are welcome to my financial plans. I’ve got the next five to ten years laid out to the dollar, and none of them involve your son.”
This was it. Steve knew it, this was his chance. He looked at Tony one last time, then made up his mind.
Steve shrugged one shoulder as if to concede an error on his part. Except, there wasn’t a humble bone in Steve’s body, so Sharon turned to shut the door behind them immediately.
If Sharon or her friends thought of a comeback, Steve didn’t catch it. He turned on his heel - swinging just enough for the pteruges to lift without unintended flashing - and made his way through the crowd in search of his man.
Steve jumped at his desk and looked up from his computer, wide-eyed, until he realized the unexpected interruption was Tony. Tony, who was standing in the open doorway of his classroom in a leather jacket and windswept hair. He wore the same sky blue tie he wore last time he visited them, the one decorated with countless colorful cartoon dinosaurs that the kids had saved up to buy for him as a class present after the best field trip ever.
“This won’t hurt,” Steve promised him. He stood up then and lifted Tony into his arms, carrying him a short distance away from the platform.
Tony’s lips curved up with a hint of a smile, but he took a drink of his beer and didn’t say anything.
The pleasantly amused expression on Tony Stark’s face chilled like sunshine on a bitter winter day. “Not to tell you how to do your job, detective,” he drawled, “but even if I did, a book signing would be the last place I’d admit it.”
Without warning, Steve took Tony’s thigh in hand and hefted it over the corner of the counter Tony was bent over, spreading him open to where his asshole was exposed from the stretch of the position alone. Tony struggled to even balance his weight on his toes, his sandal slipping on the cheap tiles so easily. Tony had no reliable way to hold himself up and no leverage to move. He was entirely at Steve’s mercy.
He could hear the water still running, and by the time he opened his eyes, Steve had washed off the plug and was drying it off.
He’d been propositioned before, that sure wasn’t new. It was a fact of life as a model - photographers, designers, make-up artists liked what they saw and could make or break a career if they wanted to. Steve had managed to get out of the offers that didn’t tempt him and happily given in to the people who did excite him, people he would’ve been eager to spend a night with even without a reward. But there was a formality to it, a space where it was expected and it was clear what might happen if he said no. Universities were supposed to be different, a meritocracy, where Steve would advance so long as he put in the effort and did the work.
The lewd sound of slick, slapping flesh ended abruptly, and Tony immediately leaned forward to give Steve his attention. “Darling? What—what’s wrong?” he choked out. There was no hesitation or frustration in his tone, even though his voice was unsteady and strained with need.
“Update,” the computer told them in its pleasant voice. “Specification deceased. Do you wish to assign a coroner?”
“Your Honor?” he said in a sudden rush of excitement. If they could invalidate the prenup, they were back to fighting for equal division of assets and joint custody—what Tony had described as a best case scenario only hours ago. “May I approach the bench?”
boundaries. And,” he added quickly, “You can pocket all your single gay acquaintances, because I’m already seeing someone.”
“Could?” Clint huffed, and he probably would have laughed if he wasn’t still recovering his breath. “He does care for you.”
His hand print got him into his own apartment just as Tony had promised. The lights came on as he asked, but instead of the light in Tony’s place that mimicked the 21st century light bulbs Steve was used to, Steve’s apartment was filled with something approaching natural sunlight. His furniture was sturdy and functional, and while they looked comfortable, none of it looked particularly personal.
“Do you remember where I live?” Steve asked, waiting to hear Tony hum in the affirmative before continuing. “Be here at six, and we can walk from here. Maybe grab a bite to eat on the way?”
Steve, on the other hand, seemed less taken by Tony’s unexpected appearance. “What the fuck are you doing here?”
Sharon looked up from her book at once and hurried to her feet. “Hey, Steve,” she said, brushing off her jeans and fidgeting a little with her book. “I, yeah, I was hoping to find you. I heard what happened yesterday,” she said in a quieter voice, getting right to the point. “I heard what Hawley said to you, and I, well. First: ew, that’s the worst thing I’ve ever heard one person say to another. Two: if you want to press charges, or report her to the department, you, you can count on me.”
“I never thought of it that way,” he admitted with an affectionate smile, pressing a soft kiss to Tony’s forehead. “You really are something special, Tony. You think you’ll always find ways to challenge my assumptions?”
“Fluid transfer?” Steve repeated slowly, unsure of whether this was some alarming trend that he’d never become aware of, or if Tony was legitimately concerned about saliva. “I’m talking about sex, fucking, boning, making the beast with two backs, the horizontal tango, laying pipe, the—I don’t know, hanky panky, the hunka chunka, there’s a thousand ways to say it and about a dozen different ways to do it, how complicated can it be?”
It wasn’t possible to walk into Steve’s room without knocking your knees into some big, so Tony stood as close to the doorway as he could until Steve could slip in, too, then turn on the light.
bardingbeedle asked: prompts if you still need them! how about steve cutting tony's hair (for some reason)? i feel like he would know how to bc he used to cut his mom's hair and maybe even his. and also maybe trimming tony's beard and just generally pampering/grooming/taking care of him too.
“Good. Then let’s get you to bed, Tony. That’s enough, Romanov,” Jim told Natasha before the video ended.
“Babe?” he asked, intentionally gentling his tone so he wouldn’t sound as worried as he felt. “Tony, is something wrong? Did something happen?”
She made her way to Clint first, carrying a change of clothes and the vial of potion that would turn him from a donkey to a human man again.
With a weak twitch of his fingers, Tony squeezed Steve’s hand. It took Steve a moment to remember that he had kissed Tony’s palm only minutes earlier. He tried not to laugh.
A flicker of movement on his camera feed gave Steve pause. He couldn’t be sure yet if it was a shadow or the movement he’d been waiting for, but either way, he turned in the direction of the old town square.
As slow and calm as Rhodes tried to be, his touch clearly startled Tony. He jolted in his chair, his hands grasping into defensive fists around the trigger. Rhodes moved quickly to control Tony’s right hand before he accidentally burned himself. It only took him a few seconds to free the torch from Tony’s grasp, but Steve’s heart dropped like a stone. The image of that torch flame centimeters from Tony’s bare neck haunted him, and it wasn’t until Rhodes was hauling Tony off the chair and over his shoulders that Steve checked back in with the video.
let your future wife or husband sleep in our bed in Portugal. I also have a list of twelve people that you may never marry. Break any of these rules, and I will haunt you until the day you die.”
“Here, I brought you my computer,” Steve said, not wasting any time on unnecessary niceties. He hauled one laptop bag off after the other, unpacking his laptop and his large Wacom tablet. “It’s not much, but it’s enough to make a presentation. It’s easier to just draw them sometimes, so I brought the tablet, too.”
Tony’s charade dissolved in a delighted fit of laughter, and he made short work of the distance between them to loom over Steve in his chair and kiss him quiet. Steve grabbed Tony by his tie and tugged him closer, until Tony was dragged right into Steve’s lap and turned prisoner in the circle of his strong arms.
Tony grinned at the insinuation of a story and glanced at Steve in his amusement before turning back to Bucky and offering him his hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you,” he said. “Steve talks about you often. Good things, usually.”
“You got a screwdriver?” he asked, already poking at an outlet that was screwed in much higher than a regular outlet, presumably to accommodate light fixtures. “Why’s this here when there already is an outlet in the ceiling for the light?”
“Steve, what are you talking about? And an ambulance, maybe? I don’t want to see it, just—keep it covered or, or whatever,
him, and he only just managed to lift his head to look down between them in time to see Steve guide his cock up to Tony’s hole and press in. Steve hadn’t bothered to shrug out of his robe or even push his boxer briefs down his thighs; he pulled his hard cock out over the waistband of his underwear, rolled on a condom, and pushed into Tony’s stretched, slicked up body with one smooth, confident thrust.
Sarah had a sixth sense about movement or light in her apartment, so Steve lit their way with the flashlight from his phone. They grabbed two bottles of water out of the fridge, then made their way to Steve’s room on their tiptoes.
Either way, Steve couldn’t wait to hear everything. More importantly, Steve couldn’t wait to get his hands on Tony and tell him how wonderful these surprises were, and show him how much Steve appreciated Tony’s efforts to be his attentive and doting partner from thousands of miles away.
Rather than responding to Steve’s question, Tony engaged the remote computer to call up the information directly.
“I did call to ask you out to dinner yesterday, didn’t I?” Tony replied with a playful smile. “This wasn’t exactly what I had in mind, so we can’t count this one, but—”
“Mr. Stark, you can’t think that way,” Steve said, but he ended his statement with a tired sigh that caught Tony’s attention. “I understand where you’re coming from, Mr. Stark. Trust me, there’s… sometimes, what we do doesn’t feel like enough. Burglars whose escalating crimes are seen as unrelated and dismissed with probation; violent exes who only go away for a few months on attempted murder charges because we caught them before they had a chance to go through with it. Times like that, I wish I could operate without a badge. Bend the rules. But we don’t play the parts we wish we could,” he finished softly. “Our choice is only to make the best of what we are.”
