Tony was desperate. He was beyond desperate, he was panicking. He could not go back to another life time of abuse. He had had his fair share with Ty. But he also knew that he was not in a place to say no. His father had already decided his fate and the Emperor of the East had sealed it. As an Omega, he anyway did not have much say.
"You are hurting me Rogers" Tony said, almost above a whisper. That was the first sign that Steve ignored. He was blinded by his irritation at the shorter man. He jerked Tony closer to him, as if it was possible and saw his brown eyes widen as he grabbed onto Steve’s shoulder with his free hand for more support. Steve practically yelled out his next words.
The nobles were stunned. They were not expecting the Emperor to defend the Emperor consort, that much was clear. “Ancient Dynamics that you talk about were uprooted the day we introduced the law of equal treatment and if I am not wrong I remember having both your seals on that document.” Steve would not tolerate such behaviour in his court, that much was clear.
As Rumlow walked away, the Emperor turned more to words torchlight. Now Tony could see his expression more clearly. Anger was still simmering in his eyes. This is when Tony thought how could he ever doubt the Emperor's intentions towards him.
“I know why,” the man continued to speak in a loud and jarring voice. He was swaying on his feet slightly and Tony realized he must have been intoxicated.
The Queen sat him down on the bed and sat facing him. “We could send a servant in your place to marry him,” she said. “He’s never seen you. And you will wear a veil with heavy ornamentation during the ceremony to cover your face, anyway. So, no one will know it wasn’t you, Tony.”
The attendants were busy serving course after course of the Italian meal to the members of the Rogers court who seemed to enjoy the food greatly.
“Oh God Tony you just can’t stop getting into trouble, can you? This is gonna hurt.” Steve sighed and with a sudden jerk, pulled a major chunk of the glass right out. Tony screamed and grabbed a hold of Steve’s shoulder, possibly the only thing keeping him from passing out.
Tony was in his lab, his safe place. He knew that no one, whom he did not want to see, could enter. Despite this, he shut the door to be safe and closed all the curtains through which the setting sun was shining. He went to his desk, lit an oil lamp, grabbed a piece of parchment along with a pen and began writing.
“Yes Your Majesty, Buck…I mean General Barnes and Natasha have really helped me a lot.” Buck? He was already calling Bucky by his nick name?  Steve was so jealous. It had always been easy for Bucky to gel with new people. Tony was still keeping his answers short. May be he was making Tony uncomfortable. He should apologise and leave.
Usually Tony was always up for a ‘city-hall debate’ with the Captain, but today he was just tired. Well Tony couldn’t be blamed; a fucking building just fell on him so Excuse You! His suit was destroyed along with his shoes as the repulsors had caught fire. So yeah Tony was paddling barefoot on the road in a worn-out hoodie and jeans with Captain America following and trying to give him a lecture in which he was most definitely not interested.
The Emperor’s eyes dropped to the food as if to check what was wrong with it, before rising to meet Tony’s eyes. “Why not my Prince?”
Currently they were sitting in the carriage carrying them to Brooklyn. It was just him and Pepper. Tony knew that Pepper was only trying to lighten the mood and ease his tension. They were soon going to enter the Rogers Fort – a foreign place. Tony chuckled at that but did not say anything further. His thoughts were still occupied by the Emperor, his efforts, his gentleness with Tony and the anticipation of meeting his in-laws. They were about to reach.
Despite his well-honed defences, Rogers’ beauty, like a marble statue, struck like a blast of flame, searing his senses, trampling his determination and made his blood sang with the serene hum of Zen gardens. Like the first time he saw Captain America’s movie, he became blind to everything but Rogers and he couldn’t help visually devouring him. But it was neither his muscly figure nor his stunning face that left Tony breathless and stupid. It was something else; it shone in Rogers’ eyes like sunlight on sapphire, gleamed on the very glow of his porcelain skin. He felt a surge of possessiveness so strong that he nearly recoiled. His heart was pounding a little too fast, a little too hard, the arc reactor almost singing, hot and whining in his chest cavity. Steve was like all his dreams come true, serenaded by Angels.
It was confusing and hurtful for Steve that his own soul-mate was digging into his still bleeding wound. Captain America looked at Iron Man, great wrenching pain in his heart. This was his soul-mate? How could Tony be so outright callous about his time under the ice?
Thor growled, squared up to Loki and stepped closer. “You listen well, brother! I...” He started before he was tackled by a fast-flying man in a metal suit, taking him far away from Loki.
Tony quickly enlightened him. “I’ve got a nuke coming in, it’s going to blow in less than a minute.” Tony said, tracked the missile’s trajectory. The nuke quickly approached oversea, towards the city. He glanced upwards towards the portal, a spark of an idea bloomed in his mind. Then he increased the power of his propellers, twisted in the air and brought himself upright, speeded upwards after the nuke.
Hot anger dropped into Maria’s stomach like a bucket of coals. She grabbed his arm only to be slapped hard. Losing her balance, she fell on the floor.
Rhodey is male and totally great guy, but he isn’t from 1940 century where the sexual caste discrimination is high and isn’t a high level alpha.
They got onto the plane and Iron Man hesitated a moment-for once hating how heavy his pheromone smelt -before finally removed his helmet, he needed to face his bogart head on.
Tony stared at him. Despite his better judgment, he could feel tears at the rims of his eyes. He quickly ducked his head, struggling to compose himself. No one had ever wanted him like that. No one had ever said I love you the way Steve did.
To say he was shocked seeing the first painting was an understatement. A devilishly handsome Anthony posed naked on a bed, looking out of the canvas so brazenly. It was covered in astounding detail, Anthony’s chest was perfectly replicated; each muscle and sinew line on his body was there. Tony didn’t know why he suddenly felt flustered. Every line and freckle on Anthony’s face was perfectly copied onto the painting. Steven Thorne must've had taken many weeks to get all of those right.
Anthony’s eyes deepened and his whole lower face melted into a genuine smile at that. The blood already coming up in Steven’s cheek. Anthony’s eyes were the most amazing shade of blue and when he smiled the world quite simply stopped spinning. And heaven helped him, he wasn’t being fanciful, he was not but he couldn’t tear his eyes from his soulmate's face.
The Omega sighed, he was getting downright irritated hence he looked around before retorted mockingly. “Erm… Shakespeare in the park?”
Tony ignored him and laughed mockingly. “You era of glory is long over Capsicle, most superhero and super-villain nowadays totally outclass you. You are useless, nothing but a smudge in a history book.” he continued meanly, dashing Steve’s fragile hope that his soul-mate wasn’t like what he saw in the footage.
Steve leaned against the railing and crossed his arms. He narrowed his field of view to the Omega and silently observed his soulmate's profile. Tony was all hard edges and bitter sad eyes after Coulson’s death.
Steve could practically hear Tony’s heart cracking. He wanted to say he wanted no one except Tony but he knew it would be useless to argue. Steve would save the argument for later when he had worm himself into Tony’s life and won his trust. He curled his hands into a fist, and he looked frayed at the edges, like he was going to split apart any second.
He was 28 and finally ready to settle down. Being with Pepper was joy and comfort, intermingled in an electric tangle he had never felt before in his life. His only regret was that it had taken a few years to realize how strongly he felt for her.
In Stark's penthouse, Loki crawled up the small stairs then turned to find himself surrounded by The Avengers staring down at him, as the victors. Their faces like storm gathering, Hawkeye looked particularly threatening with his arrow posed.
Alpha:  More than 2/8 of the population. They usually have more muscle mass and taller. Most Alpha is Slytherin plus Gryffindor minded they are not all evil  but they have a win-win mind, very ambitious, brave, confidence, fiercely competitive and cunning (strategist) and natural leader (half are control freaks) which is why they usually successful in anything they are into. Usually, the higher the level the more competitive, ambitious and physically stronger they are that is why high-level Alpha is respected and consider unique (of course it is also because they are rare).
Tony studied him, his gaze intense and probed, and the super-soldier felt like a bug pinned to a board, splayed out open—
Seriously did Rogers thought Tony didn't read Bruce's file, he spent hours over all the files even Roger's: energy readouts, incident reports, personnel evaluations, statistics, styles, aptitudes, strengths, weaknesses- he had all those in the back of his mind. For someone with an amazing military record, Rogers wasn't all that bright, then again so was the rest of SHIELD with the way they handled Bruce.
"Germany was previewed… this was opening night.” Tony rambled. “And Loki, he was a full tail diva, right.” Steve nodded in confirmation. “He wanted lights, he wanted parades, he wanted a monument built to the skies with his name plastered on it!" Tony freeze, his body locked up in shock as it hit him.
"I am sorry.”  Tony said, far weaker than he intended but not any less sincere for it. He licked his dry lips.
He had trusted Obie, he stupidly trusted Obie, enough that he had given him every security override he had. Both Jarvis and Obie had become his father figures long before Howard died. Both men made it their mission to know him as well as he knew himself and became Tony's pillar in life for totally different reasons. Tony wished he had figured out Obie's reasons earlier.
Steve was both surprised and alarmed at the intensity of Tony’s anger. He had done more than stepping on a landmine… just by mentioning footage. Tony Stark had something he didn’t want anyone to know. Most likely something dark and he knew Shield had the evidence. Was that why he was working as a consultant for free… and came here as an Avenger?
Rhodey: Low level Alpha. He was discriminate because he is not muscly like other Alpha but he prove them wrong. He is an Alpha through and through.
“What is Phase 2, Nick?” Tony questioned. Before anyone could answer, a loud thunk sounded and all eyes went to Steve who slammed an assault rifle he had found on the ship on the table in front of Fury.
Steve and Tony instinctively met each other’s gaze. Steve was looking at Tony, with all of his being focused on him as if he was the most precious thing in the world. The protectiveness he saw in Rogers’ eyes caused deep burning happiness. He mentally kicked himself. ‘NO, STOP IT, Rogers just stuck in his 1940 century mentality thinking Omega was the weaker vessel, and in need of big, manly alpha protection. Fuck that! I am Iron Man; I don’t need Rogers’s twisted gallantry.’ His traitorous heart still beating like a jackhammer.
“You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract!” Nick Fury’s voice heightened and Tony could hear the tension in his voice.
Steve grabbed one of the parachutes lying around and put it on in record time. “I don't see how I can.” More than getting back the Tesseract, every fiber of his being wanted to protect Tony. He felt like he could burn the world down to protect his soulmate and it scared him!
“Tony.” Steve called, dashed after him and grabbed his arm in desperation. There was brittle sheen in his silver-blue eyes. Nearly losing Tony once today was enough. “I would assemble the team. Don’t go there by yourself.” Steve used his Alpha voice, which in hindsight, wasn't the greatest idea. He knew he'd made a mistake when anger painted Tony’s face and his scent became bitter.
"There was an idea," the Director continued. "Stark knew this.” Steve glanced at the genius. “It was called The Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more.” Fury voiced, willed them to understand.
The chemistry was unimaginable, they never felt more alive. Their ease with each other was profound and immediate. They stayed together until the middle of the night; cuddled up on a blanket, just talking and getting to know each other. Howard was handsome, funny, and engaging. Their banter was playful, romantic and sexy.
There was nothing to do but pray, pray that his other half would come back. For what felt like the longest time, nothing happened. Desperately he prayed. “God Almighty please saves him. If you spare him I would ask you for nothing… not even him.
Omega is tricky not only as they being branded as the lowest caste they are also the minority (1/8 of the population). Most of them had less muscle mass and shorter than Alpha or Beta. And their heat also makes them less desirable as workers compare to Alpha and Beta. After the World War 2 Omega right and Omegas had worked hard for their place in society but they had yet to reach equal status.
Tony Stark was just as impudent he was shown in the footage. Steve’s despair turned into not a little rage. This burst of anger that flared through him terrified him, and it took effort to keep it under control.
Tony’s bond awakened when he first saw Steve picture when he was little. Steve’s bond would soon awaken when he saw Shield’s file that contain Tony picture. Tony knew how popular he was, he would meet Steve sooner or later. He was preparing himself to subdue the bond. Steve would be shocked at how much Tony rejected their bond, poor guy.
Regaining his balance, Iron Man came flailing back, repulsors flickering. Half a dozen warnings flashed on the HUD showed a gunner reappeared where Steve was trapped on a broken catwalk overhead while he struggled to push himself upright. The super soldier didn’t detect him.
Desperately, Steve pulled himself along inch by inch, grabbed the railing, and yanked himself onto the platform. He crawled as fast as he could while bullets came up from below and fired off another round at the enemy while trying to get to the red lever.
It was like all the weight lifted off his shoulders because Thor still pleaded him to come home after all he had done. It was sheer relief of still being accepted by Thor despite his mess. For a second Loki almost broke down, his eyes brimming with tears briefly but then he snapped himself out of it. NO, Thor only said that because he wanted the Tesseract. He was a liar just like Odin.
"And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster." Tony gripped tight to the other man’s hand, the gleamed of interest so evident in his eyes. It took a moment for Bruce to realize Tony wasn’t mocking him.
"Even if I cleared the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push." Steve’s heartbeat like a bongo drum at his words.
Tony didn’t say anything more but he kept looking at him like Steve was the punch-line to a joke only he could hear; there were anger and hatred in those beautiful, intense eyes.
He caught his face through the crowd, eyes wide, barely dared to believe, he whispered “OH MY GOD.” As his eyes locked on the most riveting man he’d ever beheld from across the room. Steven visually devoured him.
Steve found himself suddenly furious with Tony. An icy rage that had been building since the first time Tony rejected him howled inside of him. He knew that was a huge, blatant lie, he knew it!
He worried about how Pepper felt being an Alpha to an Omega who couldn’t get over his fear enough to let her see him without a shirt on since he used to trust her enough to put her hand inside his chest before Obie’s betrayal.
The words cut him deeper than he had thought possible. Rage had ridged his face and neck crimson like his flesh was on fire. It was his turn to level Rogers with a disgusted; scornful glare. “Fuck you.” he grounded out, released lips that were pursed so tightly they were turning white, balled his fists together to avoid launching a punch. “Who the hell do you think you were?” Tony's eyes glittered in anger and he hissed angrily like a snake.
I knew Tony was in pain but Steve silent agony over the lost one more good man while looking at the stain trading card speaks louder to me! It’s clear who is much more in pain. Tony express it louder while Steve is more silent in his agony.
Tony shook his head, taking in the flowers on the table and the amazing smell of the gently baking lasagna. “It’s project week and he had to meet with his friends to paint some planets. He’s going to come over on Wednesday instead.”
He walked back up to the house and put them into a vase, rifling through the cabinets until he found something that really seemed to be meant for a bouquet and not for a pint of beer. On the kitchen table was a little note that said that Tony would be back for dinner, he was out with Peter for a science project. It was signed with ‘your T.’ and Steve’s heart really shouldn’t have started to beat faster over that.
“Can I take off your shirt?”, Steve asked out of breath, when Tony had taken off his and thrown it into a corner of the room only to lean up and kiss and lick and bite every inch of his chest.
Steve opened Tony’s trousers and let his hand flutter over his dick, touching it, not touching it yet, until Tony whimpered. “If you let me”, Steve went on and slow pushed Tony’s trousers and pants down to his thighs, “I’m going to take you apart and put you back together. I’m going to keep you and cherish you.”
Not intending to stop, Steve focused on the rim of Tony's hole and pressed a kiss to it before he traced it with his tongue. Taking his time, he slowly jerked Tony off with one hand while he started to push his tongue against the muscles. He could already feel them opening up for him and he could press his tongue into Tony who reacted with a loud groan that echoed off the stone walls.
Steve chuckled and threaded his fingers through Tony's still wet hair. "I think he's learned that particular behaviour from you."
He kissed the spot under Tony's left ear and whispered "I want you", moved to the spot on the right side for "All of you." and breathed "Always." against Tony's lips before kissing him passionately.
“I mean it.” Steve caressed Tony’s face, pushed a couple of strand of hair out of his forehead and kissed him softly, on his nose, on his lips, little butterfly kisses down his throat. “You are the most beautiful person. And having proof of what you’re able to survive, of what you’re able to conceive with only your mind right here, right in front of me is making me so proud.”
Steve hurried to take the lasagna out and their dinner conversation turned to their usual topics – today they speculated about Nick Fury. Or, er, gossiped. Apparently someone had heard something about an incident with a cat. When they cleaned the table – now using the dish washer since Tony apparently did not think of regularly washing
Tony shrugged nonchalantly, stopped to examine his hand and looked up at Steve in a try to gain his dignity back. "I had the armour, though."
Steve reached down between them and wrapped his hand around Tony’s hard length. He was so caught up in Tony around in, in Tony under him, that his hand movements weren’t as refined as they could’ve been, but they got the job done. He jerked Tony off in the same rhythm of his thrusts. “Open your eyes for me, I want to look into your eyes when you come.” Steve was close as well and he knew that seeing Tony in ecstasy like that would be all he needed to climax.
"You feel so good", Tony mewled. "Damn you for dragging me on this rock, I want to feel you inside me."
When Tony started to kiss down over Steve's jaw again, Steve remembered through the warm fuzzy feeling his husband induced that he had come up to try and get him into the sea as well.
"I'm afraid not, Sir. He is reading his spider book." Jarvis sounded as fond as an only an artificial intelligence created by The Tony Stark could sound. Tony sighed in the same fond manner. "Well, I guess that's fine. Alert me in forty minutes or when he gets up, will you?"
Without missing a beat Steve replied "I love you too" and then they settled for another round of snogging before they ignored their discarded swim wear and jumped back into the water. There was a shower and a soft, dry bed waiting for them. And thankfully it was completely algae-free, Steve made sure of that.
Steve quickly found a rhythm that was so torturously slow that Tony let out a moan with every exhale, quiet little sounds that Steve loved. He used his tongue to tease the head of Tony's cock every time he bobbed his head up, his hands holding Tony's hips in place when he moved down and swallowed around the hard length.
"What did he do?" Steve sat down, placing the coffee so Tony could comfortably reach it even when he was snuggled up against Steve's side. Because that was exactly where Tony was curling up right now.
Steve pushed in with one hard thrust, nailing Tony’s prostate and making him scream. The overwhelming feeling of finally being inside of Tony took his breath away and Steve built up a rhythm, hard and deep and just on this side of slow.
“I’m not going to run”, Steve replied and with a couple of steps he was standing right next to Tony. If he took another step forwards their chests would be touching, and Tony would be pressed against the table behind him. “I’m going to stay for as long as you want me to.”
“And you’re begging for it so nicely.” Steve rubbed his hand over Tony’s thighs, leaning down to lick another bead of precum that had formed on Tony’s dick off. Tony mewled when Steve timed it with the thrust of his finger, adjusting the angle until he hit Tony’s prostate and Tony almost arched his back off the bed. “So beautiful. You deserve to be taken care of. You deserve so much love, baby, do you hear me?”
"That sounds interesting", Tony said and looked up at Steve with his dark eyes, pupils dilated. "But you're more interesting." He returned to kissing Steve's skin and Steve couldn't suppress a little moan. This was unfair.
Peter nodded enthusiastically and Steve tousled his wet hair before he climbed out of the water, sitting down on the edge with his feet dangling in the pool next to Tony. With a sigh, Tony sat down next to him in the same position and leaned against Steve’s shoulder, taking his hand.
He licked over Tony's body, down over the arc reactor and his abs until he placed soft fluttering kisses on Tony's erection. "You taste salty", Steve teased; Tony gasped when Steve licking a stripe over the underside of his cock.
“Well”, Tony retorted with a smile and knelt down so he was a bit more on the same level as Peter and Steve, “I guess unless you swim without Steve next to you it would be too early for that anyways.”
"There's nobody like you", Tony said, leaning his forehead against Steve's. "'s why you married me", Steve gave back; both of them referencing their new status as husbands as often as possible.
"Come on", he mumbled with a sigh and reluctantly pulled away. "Let's go for a swim, I found a little cave that I really want to show you."
“This is not the time for a water fight, though. Come on, once more, Petey, if you do the movement properly I’ll let you try on your own”, Steve offered.
He got up from his comfortable position in the beach chair, abandoning the glass of fruit juice to the little table where muffins and more juice were waiting for Peter to complete his swimming lesson.
"I was sunbathing!", Tony complained, but he made now grabby hands for Steve; apparently accepting his fate of getting cold salt water all over himself.
“Ohhhh”, Steve made. “Did you hear that, Petey? I think he’s challenging you. You gonna make me proud?”
His heart was still beating too fast, but Steve stood back up and was finally able to take in his surroundings. There was a cute little house besides a lake right in front of him. Tony’s house. The house where Tony had been happy with Pepper and his daughter, but there was an eerie silence setting down over it now.
Tony whimpered again, but he let Steve take away the pillow. Steve lifted Tony’s hips and put the pillow there instead, displaying him and spreading his legs. “Do you have lube?”
For a while they just kept sitting there, hands running over each other's bodies and making out without hurry; just enjoying the feeling of each other's arms and tongues and lips in the warm sun.
“That makes sense”, Steve had admitted. “So Strange made it impossible for what we did in the past to influence the future.”
“Steve!”, Tony moaned and he opened his eyes, his lips parted as well, when he came all over Steve’s hand. He was shaking, and Steve’s thrusts grew erratic before he came as well deep inside of Tony.
"Oh, so you like them?" Steve grinned and slowly grinded down against Tony, making sure the fabric would rub over Tony's skin nicely.
After a leisurely early evening watching of The Lion King, a home-made dinner and the muffin as Peter's dessert, the kid was actually back to yawning. He almost fell asleep where he was sitting over his plate, only crumbs of the muffin left.
“You did”, Tony said. “You went into the time stream and you came back out. No matter what you experienced in the mean time, you’re still you. It’s still you who I wanted to punch in the face for what you did to me every time I saw your face after Civil War. It’s still you who I want to ki–“ Tony cut himself off. The fragility that had softened his features disappeared and the hard lines were back. “Nevermind.”
“Mh”, Tony choked out, he was moving his hips down against Steve finger, slowly fucking himself and it was not enough, he needed more –
The litany of moaned curses and Steve's name told him that his husband was close and Steve used his second hand to slip the tip of his finger into Tony.
"Please quit teasing", Tony tried to gasp out. His pelvis was angled so that Steve had the best possible access without a pillow to prop him up and only when Steve was content that he had gotten Tony's hole as wet as it was possible without lube Steve moved on. He got sidetracked by the tendons on the inside of Tony's side and had to leave a bite mark there that elicited an impatient whimper from Tony before Steve focused his attention on Tony's cock again.
Now pulling Tony back in with his strength (Tony made a delicious noise about being manhandled like that) he kissed him again. "I'll see if I have his number somewhere, he'll show up around eight."
He pulled Tony's shorts off and helped him to lie back without hitting his head on the stone. Tony blinked and looked at Steve from half-lidded eyes which gave him an almost innocent appearance. Steve had to bite his lip when he looked over Tony's body, his half-hard dick all laid out for him like a feast. "Look at you",  he mumbled and traced a finger over Tony's nipple, making him writhe a little.
Steve moaned when he felt Tony’s hands slipping under his shirt and let his slide down over Tony’s back and over his ass. “Are you – are you sure? It’s not too fast? We can wait.”
"Hrmpf", was Tony's response, he was too busy with closing his eyes and cuddling up even further into Steve's arms.
Steve only replied with another giggle. "Don't worry, honey. This was damn uncomfortable anyway." "I liked it." Tony smiled up at Steve and sighed before he started to laugh. "Okay, I admit it, I am ridiculous."
A sharp intake of breath told him that Steve wasn't as cool as the sea water on his skin made him out to be and Steve got goosebumps where Tony's mouth had been mere seconds before. "I... Tony, I wanted to ask you if you don't want to come in. The water is amazing-"
They urgently moved against each other, Tony's noises turning into whimpers and Steve could feel him pressing his pelvis further down so his dick rubbed against Steve's belly with every thrust. Adjusting his rhythm slightly, it only took a few more thrusts until Tony moaned and came between them, his body arching against Steve. It didn't take long for Steve to follow suit, he just kept moving against Tony and his squeezing inner muscles until he climaxed as well.
"What's wrong?", Steve asked immediately, body tensing up against a possible threat, ready to protect Tony against whatever tried to disturb them.
“Let me make it up to you?”, Tony said in a soft voice. Steve felt a tingle running down his spine, turning his head slightly to look at Tony’s face, his smile, his eyes. He looked so earnest and mischievous at the same time and it broke Steve’s heart to know how many times Tony had gotten hurt in the past by him.
When Tony tightened the grip on Steve's hair Steve smirked around the cock in his mouth and pulled off. "Steve!", Tony complained immediately, his eyes meeting Steve's.
Immediately Steve grabbed Tony's ass, holding Tony's body securely and started to thrust up into him. "Oh fuck", Tony gasped and buried his face in Steve's neck. "Gonna come."
Steve's ass fit so perfectly into his hands, sometimes Tony wondered if they were actually made for each other. He guided Steve's movements and with the slow drag of the fabric, the slow kiss they were sharing started to get more and more intense.
"Steve, I swear", Tony moaned when Steve rubbed deliberately over Tony's prostate while tracing his rim with his tongue. "You swear what?", Steve purred, his voice so low and rough that it made Tony jerk his hips up a little.
Tony let his mouth wander over to Steve's right nipple and bit him there lightly. "You're more amazing", he said against Steve's salty skin.
“What the fuck!”, Tony yelled, and Steve had no time to process the fact that his hair was still dark without a single sliver of grey nor the fact that there was a perfectly round, glowing shape under his shirt because Tony had already pushed him backwards with all his might.
"You're lucky you already got me because that was the worst come on I've ever heard. And-", he raised his finger when Tony was already opening his mouth to protest, "and I've heard a lot of bad ones from you."
Steve almost choked on the cool air and fell to his knees, his hands searching for purchase in the leaves on the ground. It almost felt like he was back in his skinny body, having an asthma attack, and his panicked terror came back crashing down on him. Something was wrong, Steve could feel it in his bones. He took a deep breath in, counting to six, holding his breath while he continued, seven, eight nine, ten, then breathing out again. Fourteen. Fifteen.
When she opened her eyes again, several worried faces looked down at her. She recognised the voices of Peter and Gamora, but when she scanned the little crowd she was only looking for two people.
Steve smirked and blew a kiss to Tony before they both concentrated on the matter on hand: Tony sank down on Steve's dick, moaning when it stretched him that little bit more to make him feel extra good.
“I’m actually not! He’s doing good. You’re a good teacher.” Tony winked at Steve – but still got up and walked next to where Peter was swimming. Steve may have his stupid superpower and would be able to get to their son quicker but still. Just in case.
Tony looked so soft and vulnerable with the way he looked at Steve. “What do you mean that wasn’t you?”
“You should have thought of that sooner”, Tony finally said. His voice sounded hoarse and he couldn’t look Steve in the eyes anymore.
When he slowly padded into the en suite bathroom of the master bedroom Steve wasn't there yet, so Tony took his time. He smiled happily at his mirror image when he was brushing his teeth; today had definitely been his favourite day of the entire month. The opening of the bedroom door reminded Tony that it was about to become even better.
Tony's pout got worse and he narrowed his eyes at Steve, crossing his arms over his chest even though Steve was still holding him safe and close in his arms. "Can you please stop making fun of me? That ruined it!"
He squirmed a little when Steve's fingers brushed over it and smiled into Steve's mouth, biting his lip a little rougher than necessary in retaliation. It only elicited a moan from Steve and he traced the rim of the arc reactor in Tony's chest that was filling the space between them with its soft glow.
Tony chuckled and licked a stripe over the spot on Steve's neck he had just kissed. "Ah, I don't care. You look good in speedos, too."
For a rather long moment Tony let Steve have control, let him open him up slowly while they kissed. Let him return some of the teasing until Tony was begging for Steve to fuck him. That was what reminded him of his plan for tonight, though.
"Well I plan on coming with you today anyways." Tony wiggled his eyebrows and Steve rolled his eyes with a fond smile. "Oh, pretty please, Tony, you've never had sex on a rock in the sea before, had you? Like a merman!"
“I am! I guess otherwise I wouldn't stay above the water, right?” Peter splashed more water in Steve’s direction and grinned when Steve splashed back.
“Yeah”, Tony gave back. “And then we undid it and kicked his ass. And then you disappeared and left us all alone because we apparently don’t even
Clutching to Steve's broad shoulders they moved against each other, feeling each other's body heat and the familiar sensation of skin sliding against skin. Steve adjusted the angle a little so their cocks touched every time and they grew more desperate; Tony's hands gripping Steve's ass and trying to control the movement but Steve wasn't having any of it.
"Ohhh", made Tony and leered up Steve's naked chest. "Why are we wearing shorts again? This is a private beach."
This was the last straw. Steve didn't even have the time to check if Tony appreciated his pun before he started giggling uncontrollably. After staggering over to the bed and dropping both Tony and himself on it, his giggles had infected Tony who was still holding on to Steve's body from underneath him.
“I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable”, Steve whispered, suddenly overly conscious of how every word echoed in the bathroom and how Tony was kneeling on the cold tiles in front of him, still holding his finger in this hands.
Steve looked around, almost frowning when he took in the sleek modern furniture that clashed with the comfy aura the lake house exuded on the outside. This was clearly Tony’s own doing; his taste in furniture had always been questionable at best.
“No,” Steve said, stretching his hand out to caress Tony’s cheek and to take the pillow away. “Let me hear you, baby. I want to hear the beautiful noises you make when you’re taking my cock like the good boy you are.”
Since they had unconsciously moved closer together like two magnets there wasn't much space between them left and Tony used it to take a running start before literally jumping at Steve.
With a deep sigh Steve had leaned back as well, he hadn’t eaten much, but he was a bit too confused to enjoy Tony’s curry. “Okay, paradoxes. And now Strange did what?”
He leaned forwards and pressed his erection against Tony’s thigh. “Do you want to hear how amazing you are? How compassionate and brave? You would give everything to keep people save. You have the biggest heart, and when you set your mind to something you can achieve anything.”
“Yes, Steve, you feel so good, I love you”, Tony babbled against Steve’s lips when he leaned down to kiss him sloppily, more touching their lips together and breathing into each others mouth but it was the intimacy they were needing. Tony was holding onto Steve’s arms, squirming in his embrace to get closer, writhing under him every time Steve hit him at just the right spot.
A few meters next to them Mantis breathed out. “I’ve never felt so many repressed feeling before”, she said, her eyes big and sad. “Tony may have been disappointed by the world more often than anyone else, but that might be the only thing he never placed his trust in.” She pointed at the kissing couple. “Steve’s love.”~
“Please, please”, Tony whimpered, long since resolved to begging. He opened his eyes when Steve pulled his fingers back and moved back upwards so he could bend Tony’s legs back. Tony was lying there on his back, with the pillow under his ass, open and ready for Steve. “Look at you”, Steve whispered, aligning his cock with Tony’s hole but not yet pushing in, only pressing the tip against it. “Look at how flushed you are, the colour in your cheeks. Baby, you’re so perfect for me. You’re so good for me, for my cock. You’re going to feel so good around me.”
When Steve had tugged Tony's swimming shorts a little lower he dragged his fingers over Tony's ribs, not bothering to avoid the spot where Tony was ticklish.
“Mister Stark”, Steve said from where he had just landed in the dirt in a superhero landing. His face wasn’t giving anything away and when Tony gave back a choked “Captain”, Mantis tried her best to regain her composure.
Tony made a surprised noise when the cool wetness enveloped his body from one second to next. He didn't worry about getting water into his lungs, though. Before he had dipped further than a few centimetres strong arms caught him again and he got lifted up. His entire upper body was out of the water again and his face had never gotten fully covered by it. Tony smiled and loved Steve even more for giving him the possibility to have completely normal fun in the water without having a single bit of anxiety. The heady feeling of pure trust and love he had for Steve made Tony's head swim. "I love you, I love you, I love you", he mumbled over and over again, needing a moment close to Steve. Steve carefully put him down onto the sea floor and hugged him close. "Love you too", he replied, kissing Tony's now salty lips.
“I –“ Steve didn’t know what to say. There was nothing he wanted more in this world than to hug Tony, but he still wasn’t entirely sure that this was his Tony. That he was Tony’s Steve. That he belonged into this world.
Tony abruptly turned around. “I tried to push you out the door, or have you forgotten?”, he protested weakly, his eyes searching Steve’s face for something.
Steve chuckled and sat down next to Tony, their legs dangling over the water, his arm around his husband's shoulders. Tony snuggled a little closer and they sat there, looking over the sea until their bodies had dried off and Tony got bored. He got up and looked around; the cave was maybe as big as a queen-sized bed and the back part where the ceiling ledge blended into the steep rock for good was blocked by the tidal pool Steve had promised.
It almost had a beach party vibe (according to Tony),  was a water picnic (according to Peter) and should not be repeated because the taste of chlorine apparently didn't belong onto muffins (according to Steve), but they spent a relaxed time lounging in the beach chairs.
Nodding, Tony had looked intently at Steve. “He explained it like he cauterised a wound in the time stream. Or like gluing the holes we poked into the time stream shut.” Tony had smiled a sad little smile. “You won’t be able to go back where you came from except by aging, like the rest of us.”
Steve nodded, now a fond smile on his face and he ran his fingers through Tony's hair. "They are, but two weeks ago you killed that purple alien that spit acid slime on New York without starting to screech."
Guilt, anger, sadness, shame, self-hatred, disgust. Agitation and so much self-loathing that Mantis’ vision went blurry with tears. The emotions seemed to whirl together and multiply with every passing second, frustration, anger and trepidation mixing into it; making him seem alone and helpless in his sadness and dread. But everything was tinted with a layer of hope, bittersweet and misfitting and somehow making everything worse. She took in a deep breath, drawing her hand back so forcefully that she stumbled backwards but she’d rather sit in the mud all day than feel that any longer. Her heart beat was booming in her head, her breathing coming in short gasps and the feeling of unease didn’t fully leave her body even when she didn’t touch Tony anymore.
Steve could feel his heart beating fast, so fast, he was sure Tony could feel it. “I don’t want you to hate me.”
"Yes, Sir, Peter is located in his bed at the moment", Jarvis replied smoothly. Tony rolled his eyes, he knew that his AI knew that he had wanted to know what Peter was doing but Tony suspected that Peter had long since twisted Jarvis around his little finger.
They both moaned at the contact, hips snapping upwards to make that first contact between their cocks that much better. “Please, Steve!” Tony dug his fingers into Steve’s neck muscles before they slid down his back, taking in every indentation his muscles created there. “Please fuck me.”
While he'd totally say the same thing about Tony on every other day – once Tony sat down in this beach chair all his workaholic-ness had seeped out of him and he had turned into a Tony-shaped Steve-adoring jelly. Steve had grinned and poked him in the belly before marching into the perfect azure blue of the sea. For a while, Tony hadn't been able to keep his eyes off his gorgeous husband but the sun had turned him sleepy and he had closed his eyes.
“You have to say what you want, baby”, Tony whispered back, his eyes big and liquid and so dark, Steve could’ve lost himself in them. “Let me fuck you”, he rasped out.
For a moment Steve just kept playing with Tony's hair until he softly asked: "Did you tell him to go to sleep?"
Steve blew over Tony’s cock, straining and red and a bead of precum on the tip. “Such a pretty cock, so perfect, just like you.” Steve slowly licked a stripe over the underside before swallowing Tony’s cock down, letting his tongue dance over the head of it and bobbing his head a couple of times until Tony muffled his moan in a pillow.
"I think that was enough for today anyway, wasn't it?" Checking the big clock, Steve realised Peter had really been in the water for over half an hour.
Those words worked wonders, Peter scurried over and let himself be wrapped into a big, fluffy towel before the family sat down with the juice and enjoyed the muffins.
Tony kissed him good night and turned off the lights. "Always, little spider-boy. Love you too. Sleep tight and don't let the bed bugs bite."
“To avoid that time would collapse in itself he sealed it off. So whatever changes we made, they stay in the past, the outcome – or our present – stays unaffected by it.” Tony had pulled a face. “If you think about it, we could’ve brought back with us every dead person we care about, or talked to them one more time or something, and it wouldn’t have changed a thing.”
Tony was lying in a beach chair on a Stars And Stripes beach towel, sunglasses on his nose, sunscreen rubbed into his skin by a perfect blonde adonis just half an hour ago and a fruity ice cold cocktail next to him on a little table. An umbrella protected him from the direct sunlight but he was still working on the tan that turned his skin a warm bronze colour. Nobody and nothing would manage to interrupt his peace now. His phone was turned off, possible alien invasions would be taken care of by the rest of the team; he was on vacation.
“That’s the last time we saw you. That was a couple months ago. You never came back from where you were supposed to place the stones back in 2012. We thought you’d maybe taken the chance to return to the 40s”, Tony had said over the curry he had heated up for dinner for them. He had looked like he had a lot of thoughts about Steve possibly returning to the 40s, but he’d kept them to himself. “Sam wanted to go look for you, but Bucky convinced him not to.”
Steve had done enough of these ‘time heist’ journeys to know the feeling by now, and this one, it hadn’t even remotely felt like the others. He had just brought the last infinity stone back to its location in time and space before they had collected them and he had wanted to travel back to 2024 and Bruce and Sam and Bucky and a world without Tony.
“Just let me make sure it’s okay”, Tony said to Steve after sitting him down on the closed toilet lid and before he peeled the band aid off. The look on Tony’s face after realising that the slight burn wound had completely disappeared almost made Steve laugh. “Oh.” Tony was holding his salve in one hand and the crumpled up band aid in the other, staring at Steve’s finger like he couldn’t decide if he should be offended or not.
After stealing some of Steve's special mouth wash (it tasted of strawberries!), Tony grabbed a fresh bottle of lube and dropped his clothes into the laundry.
In fact the speedos were so tiny that Tony actually wondered if the right amount of stars and stripes even fit on there.
Steve blew a kiss to Tony, but Tony just captured his lips in a soft kiss until they melted into each other, undisturbed by the algae.
by coming out here to his lake house. Peter was still one of his number one priorities and Steve was pretty sure he’d heard the boy call Tony ‘dad’ on more than one occasion; and Tony had already informed him that Peter came over every Saturday. After that, when Steve read up on the legalities of adoption in New York, he wondered if Tony was happy. Tony didn’t seem unhappy, but he wasn’t with Pepper anymore and Steve wondered if he was lonely. Of course not right now, Steve was here, filling notebooks with sketches and Tony’s fridge with exotic fruit and Tony’s evenings with conversation. But before Steve, and – even though Steve did not want to think about that yet – after Steve would leave again. It just wasn’t the same, was it? As much as Steve wished he could be to Tony what Pepper had been a couple of years ago, he knew it wouldn’t happen. He focused on trying not to disrupt Tony’s life too much until he had figured out what to do with himself.
Steve blinked. He looked down at Tony's – perfectly normal looking – hand and then threw a glance over Tony's shoulder where the little tidal pond was. There were a lot of algae on the edge of it... and that was when Steve puzzled together that Tony had probably held onto them until he realised how soft and slimy they were under his fingers.
“Ah”, Tony let out a soft gasp and Steve immediately wanted to hear it again when he felt how Tony’s hips jerked up against him and how hard he was.
“Focus, Tony”, Steve had said with a smile that was maybe a little too much on the fond side. “I understand that. But didn’t bringing the stones back erase that issue? The extra reality that got created just gets cancelled out again, no?”
"Steve", Tony sighed contently, out of breath and enjoying the floaty feeling from the orgasm. Pulling off and pressing a kiss to Tony's come-stained belly, Steve was just about to scoot up to Tony when Tony suddenly started to screech.
Steve slowly slid down Tony’s body, leaving a trail of hot kisses behind and Tony’s hands moved to Steve’s hair.
"I love you", he mumbled and kissed Tony's hand a few times until he managed to hit the ring on his ring finger. Tony's answer could have been a "Love you too, Steve" but it might have just been a snore as well.
“Watch!”, Peter shouted and waved to his parents before pushing himself off the pool wall and starting to swim.
His giggles faded out when they took up the making out again where they had left it off earlier. Tony's skin had been a little cool from the water but he had warmed up so quickly under Steve's touch, Steve just couldn't stop running his fingers over him.
The giggles turned into a full blown ugly laugh and he tried to stifle it by pressing his face into Tony's neck, hugging his idiotic husband close.
"It's so peaceful", Tony commented quietly when they had rounded the riff and arrived at the other side at some rocks that were standing a good ten metres out of the water.
Peter put his head back so his hair was floating under the water like algae and he could look up at Tony who was now standing next to the pool. “Really?”
“Ah”, Tony replied. He narrowed his eyes at Steve’s explanation and Steve could see his brain working. Looking up at Steve, he cocked his head a bit. “We’re in the present. You won’t be able to go back to where you came from because we closed the time stream. It was the only way to keep the changes we made in the past in the past.”
Well. Steve swallowed down his embarrassment and went with it. “You’re adorable and I like you a lot. Like. In a ‘you’re cute’ kind of way.” He bit his lip and tried to hold Tony’s gaze, feeling his cheeks heat up. That was maybe not as confident as he had hoped it would be.
Tony didn’t reply. Instead, he took the step towards Steve. “I wish I could hate you.” With intent, Tony put his hands on Steve’s chest.
“What if I’m not ready for this?” Tony looked up at him, his gaze flickering from Steve’s left eye to his right and back.
"I'll never move again", Steve announced when Tony slowly rolled off of him. "Your own fault for marrying a sex god", Tony gave back and stretched to his bed side table to put the bottle of lube away and to get some baby wipes.
And then Tony explained. The tumbler of whiskey turned into dinner and while Tony was doing the dishes, Steve sat at the kitchen table, brooding.
"Steve, I touched some algae!", Tony complained indignantly, pouting over the fact that he wasn't getting the attention from Steve this horrible experience obviously required. Instead he was laughing! "And I don't even know how long I was holding on to them!"
"Flattery will get you nowhere", Tony whispered as breathy as possible, making sure that Steve would feel it against his cock. Just when Steve let his head fall back with a sigh and steeled himself for another round of teasing, Tony took Steve's dick into his mouth and immediately swallowed him down.
“I’m sorry Tony, can we maybe go inside? To have a conversation.” Steve tried to sound reasonable, but not condescending. He knew that Tony hated nothing more than being told what to do in a voice that made him feel stupid. He’d made this exact mistake so many times before, he wouldn’t now. When it might count. When it might be the last time he’d ever see Tony.
There were no toys on the veranda, no plants except for a dead looking cactus in a tiny pot. Steve knocked on the door. “Tony?”, he heard himself say, biting his lip afterwards, but it was too late, the name had slipped out already.
Steve only reacted by sucking a hickey into the inside of Tony's thigh, spending way more time there than strictly necessary. "Please", Tony whimpered when Steve's fingers brushed over his wet cock as if he was just trying to press his hand flat against Tony's abdomen.
"Yeah, because you're mine." Tony grinned and the playfulness came back in full force. "And now I want to see that promised cave because you got me curious."
Tony hid his face in Steve's neck, mumbling something into the sensitive skin there and sending a shudder down Steve's spine.
"We should swim back", Steve whispered into Tony's ear. "Because I don't want to risk another algae attacking you. I'd rather attack you myself."
“I suppose you have.” Tony still looked like he was waiting for something, but the alarm from the oven interrupted them.
"I'm glad", Tony said with as much loftiness as he could muster. But Steve only booped his nose and continued to cuddle him until Tony sighed and wrapped his arms around Steve as well.
Steve licked over Tony's throat and pressed a single kiss to the arc reactor in his chest. Every single time when he had Tony in his arms, naked and willing and so hot, Steve wanted to devour every part of Tony while telling him how much he loved him. And he did, he did it over and over and Steve still wanted to ruin Tony again, show him that he was his.
Jerking his hips into the wet heat of Steve's mouth a little, Tony tried to hold onto something but the smooth surface of the rock wasn't exactly made for that. Desperate, Tony held onto Steve's hair even though he got a tiny growl for that. The vibrations sent a shiver over Tony's skin.
“I would never do that to you”, Steve had interjected, horrified. He would never leave the team behind like that.
Steve laughed and opened the strawberry one. “Believe me, you had more than enough reasons to. And it’s not like... it had any effect.” He tried to hide his smile by eating a large spoonful of strawberry icecream.
Steve nodded and then added: "Yeah, it is", since he wasn't sure if Tony had seen his movement in the water. "The cave is just over there", he said and pointed at the rocks.
With a loud and cheerful “Yay!”, Peter pushed himself off the edge of the pool and concentrated on the right movements. Combining the classic frog movement of his legs with the slow, parting ones of his arms that Steve made him practise even in the dry sometimes, he slowly paddled through the swimming pool; Steve always close enough that he could grab his son anytime.
Mantis stumbled over a piece of debris, the silence of the now almost empty battle field like cotton on her ears. She had tried so hard not to look down at the bodies that she wasn’t able to hold her balance and fell. Only the fact that she got caught by Tony who had been walking behind her saved her from ending up in the mud - but looking back, that might have been more pleasant of an option.
But as soon as he had entered the quantum space he felt like he was being squeezed backwards, like he was completely taken apart and reassembled, with every piece of him just an inch further to the left. It was unsettling and Steve started to panic, but before the horror could properly take hold of him the time stream had already spit him back out.
“Do you want a pudding?” Tony looked at him with a tiny smirk on his face. “I don’t have cake but I might have some ice cream. Vanilla? Or strawberry?”
Nodding, Steve smiled. “Yeah, but I meant here... with you. If you’ll have me. I’ll spend every second trying to make up for my past mistakes.”
Now Tony half-turned in Steve's arms, grinning mischievously. Obviously Steve had to use this chance to kiss him; and one kiss turned into two turned into a lazy make out session while their hot drinks started to cool down, all forgotten on the table next to them.
"God I love you so much," Steve breathed and pulled Tony up for a kiss. Tony kissed back and still managed to mumble a cheeky answer into Steve's mouth, even though his tongue muffled it significantly: "Good thing you put a ring on it, then."
Steve laughed and took Tony's hands, admiring the ring on his finger for a moment and pressing a soft kiss to it before he straddled Tony's lap and snatched his sunglasses away.
"No, with swimming in the sea", Steve immediately said before Tony could develop any stupid ideas. "I don't want you to get eaten by a shark now that I've spent so much time teaching you how to swim properly."
Tony, apparently impatient to touch Steve as much as possible at all times, started to bite and kiss along his neck and had found a particularly sensitive spot right under Steve’s ear.
The stimulation had Tony whine out a throaty "Right there!" and when Steve pressed his tongue flat against Tony's cock in his mouth Tony tumbled over the edge.
Steve blushed a little, only the tips of his ears turning red. "I'm pretty sure JARVIS reminded you about sunburn when we were packing."
"Huh!" Steve immediately caught Tony, holding his body safe and close while Tony wrapped his legs around Steve's waist and his arms around Steve's neck. "Mr. Stark, you're quite the catch."
Steve smiled. “You needed to be angry, Tony. You are unapologetically you, and I wouldn’t want you any other way. I’ve learned this.”
Tony’s cock twitched when he heard that and Steve smirked. He quickly pulled off Tony’s remaining clothing and threw it off the bed; letting his own jeans follow until they were both naked.
Now it was Tony's turn to roll his eyes, but he giggled, leaning up to brush his fingers through Steve's wet hair. "Well, I guess if I get seduced by a beautiful blonde merman I won't be able to say no. What will my husband say when he hears about this?" With a theatrical sigh Tony threw his hands in the air and winked at Steve.
Tony tensed up a little, Steve could feel it because he had his arms around him and his face pressed against him and his heart ached. “Sorry, I-“
“So what am I going to do now?”, Steve asked when Tony came back, drying his hands on the towel before throwing it on the counter.
Tony’s hands ended up somewhere in Steve’s hair and Steve bit Tony’s bottom lip when he tugged a little too hard on his hair. The moan Tony let out made Steve want to put him on the table and have his way with him, but he pulled back, with difficulty.
“Fuck”, Tony almost purred when he took in Steve’s naked body before he looped his arms around his neck and pulled him down until their bodies were flush.
"Of course, Petey." Steve crouched down and pressed a kiss to Peter's forehead. "Just because you got through the pool once on your own you're not yet ready for any further water adventures."
“I won’t leave again”, Steve promised, his voice thick with emotion, while Tony was still trying to keep his breathing even. “What if I don’t want you to stay?”
Steve cleared his throat and leaned forwards. “What year is it?”, he asked. There was no point in beating around the bush.
Steve almost didn’t hear Tony over the sound of the opening credits of Godzilla, but he smiled. He felt like he was finally experiencing something real again, like he was able to feel something else than numbness and pain and whatever it was that made him able to do the being alive thing all day. Today had given him a lot to think about and Steve felt optimistic that he might finally be in time and space where he was supposed to.
Tony made a choking noise and turned around to the tap to pour some water into a glass. He drained it, and put it down next to the sink.
Steve poked Peter in his ribs and the kid started to laugh and wriggle until Tony couldn't hold him anymore. "Watch out, the floor is slippery but I have to put you down, you're quite the big fish here."
One evening Rhodey came around and Tony roped Steve into cooking a fancy roast with a billion side dishes until Steve burned his finger on the oven roast. He made it through the evening with a band aid on his poor finger as if super soldier healing hadn’t taken care of it immediately and even let Tony take off the band aid in the bathroom after Rhodey had left.
Steve had to grip the door frame to not fall back over. He was not over it. No matter how much time had passed in his perception since that day, since he had seen Tony’s body there on the battle field, he wasn’t ready.
"Perfect", Tony whispered, only pulling back enough that he could actually move his lips to voice the words. "Then I'll enjoy a wonderful evening with my family until then."
Tony immediately complied, bottoming out again and again until his muscles were shaking and a light sheen of sweat made his body shine while repeating Steve's name over and over. He had leaned back, with his hands next to Steve's knees for the angle but now he moved forwards until Steve could even close his arms around him.
