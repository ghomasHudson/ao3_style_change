“Why?” Natasha asked sounding exasperated.
“I manage.” Tony defensively replied. Steve nodded and looked to the blood stains,
Avengers Tower
Shaking his head to clear it, Rogers rose to his feet and advanced on Steve, kicking him in the shins, the thighs, and the stomach.
Widowed Omega with Pups.
This did have Grace worrying about parents calling her about broken windows when potatoes were fired at them, but really she was happy that her son was making friends at last and the bullies were leaving him alone.
It was the need to prove he could do this by himself that had him pushing down that knot and strengthening his resolve.
“Hey Steve, you okay man?” Sam called through the door. When Steve didn’t answer Sam pushed it open, peering inside until he saw Steve on the floor, then opened the door all the way and got down in a crouch in front of Steve, “This isn’t on you,” He said, “Not completely. We all a hand in this.”
“Yes,” Steve answered, “His name is Pietro Maximoff, he and his sister Wanda are both enhanced, they are unfortunately still at large and are to be considered very dangerous.”
And several moments of Tony’s wandering hands resulting in both him and Steve disappearing into their private quarters out of sight of the camera.
Steve’s cheeks were red and his eyes were shining with laughter. It should have been insulting considering the fact that Steve was laughing at him, but Tony couldn’t feel insulted, not when that youthful face was so bright and so full of joy and was shining right at him, was filled with so much happiness because of him.
He tried to move, tried to put his hands flat on the ground and push himself up but he didn’t have the strength and the slightest movement sent lightning bolts shooting through his back. Laying still seemed the best option to avoid anymore pain, but he couldn’t breathe like this, he needed to move.
Tony yelped, pulling hard on Steve’s hair, making him yelp too, which was no doubt the reaction Pepper was hoping for when she shouted through the door at them.
Steve, that was Steve. Tony tried to clear his throat, tried to speak but there was something choking him!
“Who is so beautiful? Who is the most beautiful girl in all the world?” Tony asked, leaning down to bump his nose against Lily’s
“Certainly Sir.” Jarvis replied.
“You didn’t let anything happen.” Bruce said, “And beating yourself up will get you no where.” He gestured to the water, “Drink, you are dehydrated and we need you on top form.”
Tony delivered the placenta at the hospital and was checked over as was the baby, whom he and Steve decided to name Christian James, both of whom were fine. CJ as they nicknamed him was found to be full term and a little small for a Pup but would quickly make the weight up and had no other difficulties.
Rhodey wouldn’t be far behind them, he was flying in from California having gotten immediate compassionate leave to come and be with Tony.
Clearly every instinct that Bucky had was telling him to run while he still had the chance. It was taking everything he had to fight the impulse and force himself not to do so. He looked from Tony to Steve, to the wriggling crying baby, to the unhappy man behind Tony, to the Cops, and then back to Tony who was gazing at him imploring him to do as he asked. His heart was pounding, and his mouth was dry, he wanted to run, to get himself out of there while he had the chance, but he knew intellectually that it would be a mistake, so he slowly but surely reached out and took the offered hand.
Steve snorted at that, “I’ll have to listen to it and get back to you.” He said, “But I thought you liked that one from Notting Hill.”
“MAMMA!” Peter moaned, “Dad?” He appealed to Steve, “Can’t you take him somewhere he’s being embarrassing again.”
Their mouths dropped open, their eyes bugged out, and they gaped at the larger, older version of Captain America.
“Oh, is that right, dude you’re zip tied to a bed.”
The enormous corpse of Hulk would follow her, the colossal beast finally struck down, impaled through the chest, a huge shaft of metal having torn a seven inch hole in his torso, obliterating his heart.
Why would a man who could afford to dine at five star restaurants and order the most costly items on menus without making a dent in his petty cash chose to eat at fast food joints?
“Right,” Tony said, “Where the hell am I, how long have I been here, what is going on, and who is running this little show?”
“You shouldn’t be able to walk away from any kind of fuckery at all, because if you can then it must have been a big fucking disappointment.”
“I don’t know, several weeks. Since Ultron I guess.” A mirthless smirk twisted Tony’s lips, “Maybe karma is catching up with me, my guilty conscience is haunting me.”
“Lies, slanderous lies, I have never seen that Chick Flick in my life Steven, how can you suggest such a thing!”
There was no way this wasn’t going to get into the media and it would be better if their parents heard the facts from the Avengers than from the news.
The bots rolled into their places and Sam and Thor placed coconuts into their claws, “Get ready, take aim, and fire!”
Tony’s hope that his discomfort wouldn’t get worse lasted only until after dinner, most of which he’d pushed around his plate feeling too nauseated and uncomfortable to eat.
“Hi.”
Stark Mansion, for all it’s sprawling and imposing grander was lived in, it was warm and inviting, Tony had made it a home with his small family, letting toys, trainers, discarded sweaters, and homework clutter up the place, had childish drawings on the walls with the oil paintings, photos of himself with the kids and dozens of the kids everywhere.
“No strain?” Steve asked.
“What, to get pregnant before you told me, so if I got mad I’d feel guilty about it?” Steve barked at him, “And not risk upsetting you because it might endanger the pregnancy?”
Tony scowled and went back to scrubbing his hair, “You are so going to be grounded Jarvis. That’s it, no more Internet Adventures for you, no more surfing cyber space whenever you feel like it. I’m going to transfer your data core into a microwave and you will spend the rest of your life warming food and having your circuits fried when people put metal things in you. And I will put lots of metal things in you! I will forever be shoving my junk into your hole!”
*****
“There are supposed to be files though.” Clint said, “We can get them.”
“Whoohoo baby, you are so turning me on!” Tony whopped over the coms. “Damn I want you riding my ass like your are riding that bike tonight!”
Cautiously he approached Tony, hardly daring to breathe as he drew closer and closer, he was just a foot away when Tony stepped out.
“Fair enough.” The host agreed and smoothed out his suit, sitting up a little straighter as silence was called with the warning that the camera would soon be on.
Looking like he was chewing glass, Steve nodded tightly, “Don’t go far,” he said, giving Rogers a warning glare which the other man returned in kind, following Tony to the deserted dining area to speak.
Avengers Tower
Steve straightened up, his eyes remained on Morgan and were swimming with sadness even as he tried to remain stoic. “A life on the run is no life for a baby.” He said, his voice shaking, Tony met his gaze, his own eyes shining with tears. “I can’t do that to her.” Steve whispered, “I won’t do that to her, she needs a home, stability, and I… I can’t give her that.”
“Lets stabilize him and get him to CT, I want to know exactly where that bullet is before we go digging.” At this point one of the Orthopaedic registrar’s joined them and began to examine the leg.
“You can have them tomorrow but not today.”
“He woke up with this lovely lady whose name was in fact Ivan!”
Prague
The Skrull shrugged, “I have his memories, all of them.” He looked to Steve, “Even the ones he didn’t want himself. The Alpha he loved betraying him, lying to his face about his parents Murders and then leaving him for dead.” The Skrull laughed, “He was pitiful, lying there, in that bunker, all broken and bruised, wasn’t even capable of putting up a fight, well, it isn’t surprising is it, after what you and that one armed friend of yours had done.”
“I wanna camp too and I wanna make S’mores.” Zach piped up.
Christine cleared her throat, “Rehab, is there a possibility that you will recover?” She asked,
“So… moving on, The Tower has actually survived pretty well, mostly only superficial damage that won’t take overly long clearing up. I should be able to have you, Bruce, and Thor moved in by the end of next week. I can even show you, your floor right now.”
Panicked, Tony immediately called his Doctor, bundling Zach off to bed with a dose of calpol, orange juice, and cold water for him to sip and fretted over the reading on the thermometer.
“Of course the whole team is present for training sessions.”
“What did you say?” one of the thugs asked him.
“Rhodey.” Rogers called out, “Thank God you’re here. Stark has gone mad…” He broke off as Rhodey’s face plate retracted and he was met with the Colonel’s furious gaze.
Spiderman appeared to pout, but Deadpool wrapped an arm about his shoulders pull him into a hug that Spiderman really didn’t want but was forced into anyway. “Don’t worry Spidey-pie, Iron Buns is just feeling sore today, Captain Amazing probably did it a bit too rough…” This was as far as Deadpool got before Tony was shoving Lily into Steve’s arms and grabbing Deadpool by his outfit and marching over to the landing pad obviously intending to throw him off it!
Natasha bit her lip and looked at Bruce; the Doctor shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat. "Peter is very sick at the moment and your parents think it's best that you don't see him like this."
He wasn’t going to be his Mother.
But not always…
“I’m fine.” Tony insisted, “I just haven’t been sleeping great is all, it’s nothing, it doesn’t matter.”
“The signal must be blocked.” Tony said trying to shift as best he could beneath Steve’s weight and the weight of whatever was on top of them. “Shit, without it the suit can’t lock onto the bracelets.”
*****
“I am!” Zach declared, “I’m Fire Cracker.”
“Hmm, I wouldn’t have thought you’d have it in you to be any good with children,” Natasha said, eyeing the pair.
“Stellina?” Steve asked.
“No, she’s been disrupted enough for today, stay with her at the hotel and I’ll call you.” Tony called back to Steve ignoring the impatient huffing from the Cop as his conversations held them up,
“Why, are you jealous?” Deadpool exaggeratedly gasped and pressed his gloved hands to the sides of his masked face, “Am I in competition with Captain Amazing Ass-erica?”
“I should just shoot the bastard and be done with it!” Tony grumbled.
Peter had homework to do and so retreated to his room to get on it, Zach engrossed himself in Doctor Who while playing with the cats, leaving Tony to curl up on the sofa with Steve and look over wedding menu options and Cake ideas.
“She did, she suggested I enrole him in a martial arts school for children his age. It’ll boost his confidence and teach him several skills.” Tony said, he wrinkled his nose, “She also suggested a Shrink but I don’t want to go down that road yet, not until I’ve exhausted other options.”
“Hey!” Wanda geared up to use her magic, but Vision was ready for her, and with a blast from the mind stone, he sent her reeling back.
“Lame.” MJ said, she looked him over, “Do you like grow extra limbs and eat bugs?”
“About fifteen acres Sir.” Jarvis replied,
“It’s a euphemism for genitalia.” Natasha explained, curlers in her hair, a face pack on her face, and her toes separated as she painted them.
*****
“Surely an agreement could be reached?” One of the school board said, “Having read Peter Parker Stark’s school record I agree that this behaviour was very out of character and considering that he was taken very ill recently I think the two incidents may be related?” She looked at her fellow board members several of whom nodded in agreement.
Killian chuckled, “Would you like to see?” he tossed three holograph nodes across the floor, “You know, since Bern I’ve been desperately wanting to bestow on you the same desperation you gave to me, I just couldn’t figure how to do it.”
“Tease.” Steve growled leaning in for a hungry kiss,
“I am sorry to tell you Mr Stark that you have suffered a serious and permanent spinal injury. When you were shot the bullet passed severed your spine between the L1 and L2 vertebrae, shattering L2 beyond repair, our neurosurgeons did their best, your spine has been stabilized but that is as much as we were able to do for you, the damage is beyond the ability of medical science to repair.”
“Not unless they are suicidal or masochistic.” Tony agreed, and tilted his head, “Steve, honey, can you breathe?”
“Oh and those muscles of his, God, I could climb him like a tree. Jarvis, do you think he’d mind if I climbed him like a tree?”
The thought of that, of Tony’s body crumpled in a pool of his own blood made Steve shudder. It was all too easy to imagine Tony falling to his death, his body replacing Bucky’s on the train, his face frozen in terror as his hand missed Steve’s and he plunged to his death.
Clint looked at Sam, Sam looked at Clint, then the two of them speed swum over to Thor and simultaneously yanked on the crocodile tipping Thor off the side and crashing down into the water.
“He’ll be fine.” He said to Steve when he looked up, “He’ll probably have one hell of a headache, but nothing else.”
Tony rose and eyebrow at the Demi-God who grinned at Zach, apparently not minding the way he was pronouncing his name.
Again Peter gulped, “He means Komodo Dragon.” He said in a small voice, “I didn’t think….well what were the chances….”
“What the hell was Osborn doing here?” One of the Fire rescue workers said looking at the remains of what might have been a lion or lizard.
“He’s thinking of seeing you in a speedo!” Clint snickered and was promptly slapped upside the head by Natasha. “God Woman, why are you mean?”
“Oh its not your fault a fence lizard decided to make Zach his bed last night.” Tony said with a shrug, “But maybe 86 the horror stories until we get home?”
“I don’t mean to interrupt, but you said something about wanting help?” he asked, Bucky, “Are you in trouble?” Bucky nodded,
It was once they were in the limo that the nerves began to show. Natasha sat rigid in her seat, her back straight and fingers laced together on her lap, while her face remained expressionlessly calm, her knuckles had turned white from the tight clenching of her fingers.
“You seem to be having some problems, Mr Stark.” Fury said, standing by the windows to take in the view.
He managed to keep from shedding tears by sheer will alone. Just thinking about Tony was heart breaking, he still saw him as clearly as if he were right by his sider even now. Could remember every detail, how his eyes crinkled and creased when he smiled brightly, the wicked cackle of his laugh. How his hair curled in the nap of his neck if he didn’t cut it, how it would flop over his forehead and caress his brow. How his eyes would darken, and his pupils expand when he was aroused.
“No.” Peter said finally lifting his head and wiping his face, “You don’t have to be sorry, don’t be sorry. You’ve done nothing wrong.”
“Are you sure?” he asked, getting a nod and Tony turned away, pushing his face into the pillows. Steve rolled his lips, forcing himself to back away, but when he heard a muffled sob his resolve crumbled. He was back across the room within two strides, up onto the bed in one fluid motion, and had Tony pulled into his arms, head against his chest a moment later. Neither of them spoke, there was no need for words, Steve held Tony, rubbing his back until he had cried himself out and fallen asleep, the Captain had intended to leave, but he was warm and comfortable, the bed was very soft and he felt too cosy to move.
“Too dry.” She said.
Zach wasn't fooled by how Bruce and Natasha tried to play down how serious Peter's condition was. He was too intelligent for that, they tried to make it seem that Peter was just a little sick and it was nothing to worry about. But Zach knew better, he knew that unless it was very serious, his Mamma or his Daddy would have come to collect him from school while the other remained at the hospital.
The sky was crystal clear and an impossible shade of blue, the sun was shining brightly and making the sea sparkle and the sand seem golden.
Zach immediately brightened, thrilled to be asked to teach Steve something so important, “Cause I can, I’ll teached you everything!”
“Yeah, I’m researching possible chemical components for making web fluid.” Peter said, “I need it to be highly durable, adhesive, and light.”
Peter felt very disconnected all of a sudden, floaty and light, everything was slipping away from him, the room seemed to have become liquid like, all melty and fluid, it was blurring and swirling….the last thing Peter heard as he fell into the swirling fluid world was the Doctor swearing and something exploding.
“I just want to look at some of the Kevlar that Mamma makes.” Peter said to Jarvis, his cheeks flushing. He’d never been a good liar, not even to an AI. “I won’t damage anything he’s working on or mess anything up I swear.”

“Dr Banner now might be time for your larger self.” Thor said as they ran to the burning remains of the base.
“Tony wait!” Steve cried grabbing at Tony’s forearm, “We need a plan.”
“They have engaged in a pancake flipping contest, two of which have stuck to the ceiling.”
“Time Travel though,” Rhodey shook his head, “Seems too…sci fi to be real.”
“Hmm, Papa Steve, I think that suits you.” Tony mused, shifting Lily’s weight a little, “So, we’ve only got any hour, where do you fancy going for lunch?”
“Umm, I guess.” Tony stammered, it was way too early to deal with this. “Have you talked to Steve about this?” Zach shook his head,
Steve snorted at the unlikely scenario, “You have seen way to many movies at this point.” They both stopped and jerked their attention towards the boys tents were there was a yell, a squeal, and then laughter.
“Thanks Friday.” He said opening the door to the stair way and began to make his way down, shooting dead soldiers as he went. Save for one whom he slammed against a wall, “Wheres Tony?” He bellowed into the man’s face.
“Could he though, I mean could he?” Ned gazed at Peter with huge eyes looking like a puppy begging for treats.
“You know, I’ve just gotta ask, if you are so much smaller in body than Supersized America over there, does that mean you’re you know,” He lowered his voice to stage whisper, “Smaller down there too?”
Pepper was right about the headlines, and the interest that had half the worlds press camped out before Stark towers, screaming questions and snapping pictures as Tony sat beside Steve explaining to the world of how he was a different Steven Rogers and how he had come to be in this universe, following the destruction of his own world.
I mean, take the President. He’s black! And your Friend Rhodey! Neither of them would have reached such positions in the forties. A black man would never have been made colonel back then, and Fury would never have been in charge of something like Shield. It just didn’t happen, and someone like you, an Omega, you’d never have been in charge of a company, you wouldn’t have been allowed to be C.E.O, and you certainly wouldn’t have been permitted to be Iron Man.
Tony would snort and roll his eyes at the spectacle, and uploaded images of a pyjama clad Zach standing on Steve’s chest to the internet with the caption, Cap’s Arch Nemesis?
“Peter!” Steve barked as Tony reeled back looking like Peter had hit him. Peter’s eyes widened as he seemed to realize what he’d actually just said and immediately regretted it as he saw the hurt and guilt blossoming on Tony’s face.
How he was going to explain all this to Pepper and Rhodey, never mind the Avengers, Tony had no idea, but for tonight at least he would concentrate on getting Steve and Lily settled, then face the rest of the world tomorrow.
Both schools were apologetic for the boys suspensions and after Tony and Steve assured them of Zach and Peter’s behaviour, both boys were allowed back into school.
Steve didn’t say anything, he couldn’t say or do anything, not until Tony suddenly gave a wet cough, his eyes flying open as his body spasmed with the coughing fit.
“Tonight.” MJ replied.
Tony’s eyes widened, Steve stared in shock, the mask falling from his limp hand, the man continued to squirm, “Who the hell is Bucky?” He demanded.
“Medical attention?” Natasha scoffed, “What he needs is to be arrested for assault and battery, if not attempted murder!”
Tony snorted, “Any how are you going to stop me?” Rhodey gave him a grin that was all teeth,
“Indeed.” Killian said with a smile, “As I looked out over the city I realized something. Anonymity. It’s been my mantra ever since. You simply rule behind the scenes. Because once you give evil a face you create a target.”
“Well giddy up cowboy, I’m fully prepared to have a little death with you!” Deadpool leaned forward and stage whispered, “My pants have Velcro seems for easy access to my ass-ets!”
“Right.” Tony said.
It was dark when they landed on Tony’s island which obscured most of the view  save for what was lit by the lights on the landing strip and the external lights about the villa which Tony led everyone to, down a winding rocky path through lined by palm trees, bushes, and other plant life that they couldn’t see well enough in the dark to inspect.
The asset stared vacantly, “Ready to comply.”
All American Throw Down!
Steve chocked on his laughter hoping that the two women didn’t start fighting and gave a sigh of relief when Tony joined them.
The plastic pistol had been easily hidden inside her bra, the darts had been hidden under her broad silver wrist cuff so the guards had thought that it had only been the cuff that had set the alarm off as she had been wanded without any other alarms.
Tony and Steve took the master bedroom with Peter and Zach going to share the bed with them.
“No,” Tony said at once, “She’s not… she’s in Malibu.” At Steve’s frown he went on, “We broke up about two months ago.”
Cheese souffle
“Yes dear.”
“This is really great Mr Stark, thanks so much for letting us stay over.” Ned enthused,
They ate on the patio watching the sun set, a brilliant ball of fiery orange and red dipping down into the ocean.
Finally, on November 30 2009 Tony went into labour.
"Damn right you are." Tony said, "To all of us, especially Zach, he's can't wait to see you."
Natasha cleared her throat, “As fascinating as this is, I think we should get back on topic. Stark says he can design a program that will go through Shield’s files, encrypt the ones that need protecting and upload the Hydra files to the internet.”
“I’m putting parental locks on your internet again.” Tony said, “You are too young to see such things.”
Tony turned a hard gaze on her, “I’d prefer the people having a say in what is going on in their country, and across the planet. That’s what a democracy is for. What this country is supposed to thrive on.”
“See, it’s easy.” Tony said, “Just relax and go with it.”
“So long as you keep it away from the food.”
Dodging laser fire Tony headed straight for the castle and smacked right into the energy shield, “Shit!” he cursed as he fell away quickly righting himself and firing back at the laser cannons that were targeting him.
But he had to go and spend Christmas with the others, had to act as if he was perfectly fine or he’d spoil this for everyone else.
“Sorry for scaring you Champ.” He said, relieved that he hadn’t hurt Zach when he’d stumbled.
“For our first dance.” Tony said, “Its one of the most romantic love songs in the world, or so Pepper and Jarvis tell me.” He leaned forward and stage whispered, “I think they are having a secret affair that they think I don’t know about. I am sure Pepper is going into Jarvis’ private server and sexting him!”
“This kid. Harley Keener, saved my life.” Tony declared, his voice echoing as he used the microphone. “I crash landed in Rose Hill after my house in Malibu was attacked by the Mandarin. My suit was damaged, the systems trashed, I had no money on me, nothing but the clothes I stood up in…” He paused and shrugged, “And the poncho I stole off a statue.” Some of the kids giggled at that.
“I have to go to him.” Tony said trying to get up again only to be rendered on his back once more with a coughing fit that left his head pounding and spinning.
“Tone’s, did you hit your head?” Rhodey asked.
“You’re disowned.” Tony said, shouldering his way past Wade to go to the bedroom and put some clothes on,
“He was a murderer, a war monger, just like his Son!”
“Are you sure?” Pepper said eyeing him critically, “You’re moody, you’re sipping ginger ale and you usually hate ginger ale, and I’m not being mean but you look like you’ve gained a few pounds, all on stomach.”
******
As messed up as he was, Bucky couldn’t help but to snort at Deadpool’s theatrics, that amusement however was short lived as Rogers freed himself and kicked Deadpool off him, sending the lunatic into sprawling heap of limbs and curses.
Sam sighed heavily through his nose and closed his eyes, just giving up on the whole conversation.
“Baby no, you aren’t evil, you could never be evil.” He held Peter tight, rubbing his back and pressing Peter’s head into his chest. “You are my baby boy, my Peteypie. There is nothing wrong with you, you are perfect.”
“He sure is.” Tony said grinning at Zach’s audacity, “Now lets finish this fucker off.”
“Well at least Cap’s had his revenge.” Tony said as he scrubbed himself clean.
Thor looked up with a frown, “People are surely not blaming us for these events.” He had been informed of all that had happened since he had left Earth so he was aware of what had happened to his friends and to Zach, something that disgusted him, because, as he said, “Only the most dishonourable of cowards attacks a child or attempts to use them as a pawn.”
With a full six months of no violence, and a good year of the same when he’d been hiding in Bucharest the courts did not feel he was a danger to anyone and acquitted him of the crimes he’d been facing making him a free man.
Peter pursed his lips as he considered this, it was possible Tony and Steve hadn’t mentioned Osborn’s more serious criminal activities, but Peter was pretty sure he’d have overheard something being said if they knew, it wasn’t like his hearing could miss anything now, not even when he wished it could. Hearing his parents having sex was seriously traumatizing.
“My magnetic ass.” Tony drawled, “Any other body parts attracted to it?”
“This will ruin Stark’s lawsuit.” He declared enthusiastically. “That bleeding heart whelp will drop the suit faster than he drops his pants in order to keep his brat in school.”
“Pepperoni, what can I do for your most deliciousness?” Tony asked, giving her his best grin, which Pepper rolled her eyes at.
“You’re a part of this family Jarvis, you and Friday.” Steve said, “Don’t forget that.”
Steve ruffled Peter’s hair for him and patted his shoulder, “Go on, get to your room, Or I’ll call your school and tell them that you need a refresher course in the sex-ed videos.”
“Well that’s what cosmetic surgery is for isn’t it?” Rhodey joked, “Seriously Tones, you’ve nothing to worry about, if I didn’t think he was serious about you, I wouldn’t have given him my blessing.” This made Tony pause,
“What, no!” Peter yelped finally lifting his head to look at her, “No rabies. Or cancer or Hepatitis. No sickness at all. I’m fine I promise I’m just different.”
“I’m afraid not, Doctor Banner, it is clearly synthetic in origin but has been present in Mr Stark’s blood for a long time.” The Doctor said, “We also have an idea of when and how it was administered to you, Mr Stark.”
Peter nodded, “He slapped her face. I mean, not intentionally I don’t think, but when he turned back to her his hands were up and he caught her.” He looked imploringly at his parents, “I couldn’t stand it, I just had to do something, I couldn’t just sit there and let him and Flash hurt my friends.”
“Think you can hold on tight?” he asked,
“Help me.” Peter whispered as the room began to spin around him.
“Like you don’t want to go back because that twenty-something waiter was making eyes at you?” Steve placed a hand over his heart,
“Tony’s afraid of the water.” Sam said, “That’s why he hasn’t gone swimming.”
“Now Stark, why can’t you be nice like Cap?”
He ran as hard as he could to reach the hospital, his little legs were shaking and he was panting heavily by the time he reached the doors but he didn’t stop, he made himself keep going to the lift and got into it punching the button for the third floor and sagged against the wall as the lift rose up.
“I didn’t know he’d do that.” Maya cried, she shook her head, “I needed the money to fund the research.” She looked accusingly at Tony, “Stane said Stark Industries would help but he…”
“Um okay, no.” Steve said both bemused and relieved that Tony was already planning for the future, “You need to rest and recover your strength.”
Tony paused for a moment, he could blast Rogers in the gut, he had perfect aim to do it, he could kill the man right here and now. Every part of his body was burning for him to do it, but he waivered, unable to take the shot, unable to murder Captain America.
“Can I…”
Fury ignored the question and went into a long speech about how Howard had been planning to create a new energy source that would dwarf nuclear reactors, how Vanko had been only in it for the money and had been planning to sell the research to the highest bidders, at which point Howard had him deported and when the Russians learned Vanko couldn’t make the reactors work on his own, had him dumped in Siberia.
“Tony, why didn’t you tell me sooner, why have you been keeping this secret?” She asked, “Fertility treatment is a bitch, the side effects are horrible.”
“What if he’s hurt, what if he’s dead!?” Ned screamed at MJ.
*****
It was very late evening before anyone wanted to eat any Christmas cake or yule log and even then they only had small slices having also enjoyed the chocolates that were being handed around and were content to spend the rest of the night lounging around and enjoying each-others company.
Tony’s head whipped around at Peter’s whimper and he was across the hall in a second, taking Peter into his arms and holding him close. “Baby, what is it, what’s wrong?” He crooned, rubbing Peter’s back and taking the boys weight against himself.
His breath caught as Tony came into the lounge, he was dressed in black jeans with a red silk shirt that Pepper had picked out for him, and a fitted leather jacket. His beard and hair were trimmed, his skin was scented from the shower gel he’d used and he looked as nervous as Steve felt.
“I am not having sex with you in a hospital supply closet!” He hissed thoroughly scandalized by the thought of it, and, to his shame, slightly turned on too.
In the bedroom Peter snickered, “Mamma and Uncle Steve are flirting again.”
“If we are ready to begin.” The moderator, once introductions and some light flirting was made, “Mr Stark I believe you have a statement you would like to give before questions?”
But when he looked down at Morgan he knew that he couldn’t just cling to his anger, things weren’t better, there was so much left to do, to work through, to resolve, he and Steve weren’t alright, they couldn’t just go back to how they had been, but Morgan deserved to have her Father in her life and Steve deserved to a part of her life…
“The test revealed that you have been effected by the gamma radiation that the spider was exposed to. Zach obviously figured that as it was radiation it meant you would become another hulk.” Peter snickered at that.
When Steve first awoke he didn’t remember where he was, then the memories of the night before came rushing back and he rolled over to cuddle around Tony only to find the other side of the bed empty.
His assurances brought smiles from all of the team except for Steve, because the Alpha knew, that even when they did find them and made them pay, they couldn’t make things right for Tony, nothing could undo what had been done to him.
Harley’s eyes widened, “How do you know I’m bullied?”
Tony opened his mouth to tell the Doctor not to let them in, but it was too late, the boys came bursting into the room, rushing to him and grabbing his hands, scrambling up onto the bed to kiss and hug him. Steve was not far behind them, gently lifting Zach down from the bed and popping him into a chair reminding him that he had to be careful with his Mother right now.
“There is no reason for Peter Parker/Stark to be excluded from school.” The Principal said, “This is the first time ever that he has behaved in such a way. I do not see a need for him to lose his position at school. Certainly not when the fight occurred with Harry, who has been in trouble for fights in the past with other students.”
That’s who I am, You, twelve years from now in 2023. It wasn’t Loki you were fighting for the sceptre, it was me. I had to come back in time for the Sceptre, but as you’ll have already seen, I replaced it once we were done with it, and by we I mean the team, or rather what is left of us, which I’m sorry to say isn’t many.
His skin prickled and all the hair suddenly stood up on his flesh making Peter turn with a start to find Bruce fiddling with some equipment behind him. Huh, his senses were really heightened.
“Of course.” Thor said as cheerful as ever, he made his way over to the pair and picked up a handful of pegs, “What do we do with these?”
Bucky, who was Bucky?
“Uh huh,” Zach said, “Can I call you Daddy?”
Thor and Sam landed in the ruins and swiftly began to join in the frantic digging, “Tony!” Steve bellowed, “Peter!”
Ned had never ridden a bike so fast in his life and neither had MJ, the two of them tearing across New York to the tower and running up to the doors and pounded on them buzzing the intercom frantically.
“I need a tablet.” He said, making Steve frown,
“Garish? This from a man who fights in gold and scarlet?”
Steve shrugged, “Depends if I’m getting off to a slow start.”
“No Howard, you can’t do this. He doesn’t need changing, he is perfect already!” Maria’s sobbing echoed in Howard’s mind and he shook his head, willing it away from him.
“Why didn’t you save us?”
Again, Tony typed on the tablet, “We don’t know for certain, obviously your senses have been greatly increased, which is why smell, sight, hearing, and everything was suddenly so strong for you; Bruce and I are looking into ways to desensitize you. Help you gain control of your senses, so you won’t be so overwhelmed.”
“I tried.” Tony moaned in his dream, his physical self whimpering.
“Maybe,” Sam said glancing around the kitchen, he grabbed a couple of wooden spoons from a ceramic pot on the countered and offered them to Steve to a roll of bandages.
“Buh buh, buh buh!”
“Everyone stay alert I don’t want any surprises.” Tony said as they reached the door, the lock was digital but Jarvis quickly took care of that and they pushed the door open, stepping into the facility Steve hadn’t been inside of in seventy years. Echoes of memories ran around his head as he followed Tony, Jarvis guiding them via a tablet Tony had brought, taking them to a lift down below the ground level, deep down where the heart of Shield had been.
“Come to join us little Starks?” Thor said.
"I'm sorry Ma'am, but it's our Son, he's only thirteen and we were told by his school that he's been brought here in critical condition."
“I don’t care!” Zach yelled, “I won’t go.”
“Pancakes better.” Zach pouted.
The complete download took nearly an hour, both to download from the servers and to them get used to using a body. Coordinating limbs was not something Jarvis had ever done and it took him time to get used to moving them, standing upright and walking.
‘You should have let me kill the Widow, then we could have found the Witch and killed her’
Peter gave Tony a grin over his shoulder and beckoned Zach closer so he could see the prawns too.
As the evening progressed Tony played a Dr Who board game with Zach and Peter, Clint and Sam looking on and giving commentary every now and then, Pepper and Happy had to say goodbye as Pepper had a number of early meetings the following day but promised to be up to see Tony in the afternoon.
“I’m alright Pep.” Tony said, as she pulled back and give him a glare he sighed, “Okay, I’m not, but I won’t fall apart. I’ve done that once and Steve got me through it.”
Peter had snickered at that, always finding it funny when Dumm-E used the extinguisher on him.
Closing his eyes Tony sighed heavily, “I like to think that we’d have met anyway, with or without Loki and his bat shit crazy.”
Vision lowered down to the ground and solidified, while Rhodey remained on guard. “Where is everyone?” Rhodey asked, looking around, “Rogers, Romanoff, Maximoff?”
*****
"Will you bring him in?" Peter asked shifting again and wishing the bed wasn't so hard and the sheets not so itchy on his skin.
They would, Peter knew they would, but he couldn’t help but to worry, after losing his birth parents, his uncle, and his aunt, what if everything was not enough?
Seeing that this was a losing battle Sam sighed and nodded, “Thank you.” He said to Tony who barely acknowledged it, ten grand was hardly worth mentioning to him.
“What about Bucky?” Steve asked, “I know we need to take down Hydra, but I can’t just forget about him.”
Steve deliberately kept the pace moderate, while he and Peter could manage a fast pace with ease Tony and Zach couldn’t, Tony wasn’t enhance and Zach’s legs were much shorter than everyone else’s.
When they finished skating Tony treated everyone to hot chocolate and snacks and they sat to watch some semi-professional skaters on the ice.
“A schematic layout came onto the HUD and Tony looked through it, the lab spaces he wasn’t interested in, it was the bio signatures that he wanted and thankfully, since becoming enhanced Peter’s bios were unique, his body temperature was slightly higher than average and his heart rate was slightly faster due to his metabolism running at a greater rate than the average mans, or boys.
Clint mouthed a LATER at Tony who winked at him and patted Zach to hold onto him as he wheeled himself further into the apartment.
“The energy, it is constantly in motion, constantly surging like the heart of a star.” He stretched out his hand not quite making contact with the orb within the sceptre, but traced his fingers over the flickering energy ball like someone running their fingers through a flame. “Like the heart of a star it contains great power and the potential to beget life.” A slow cruel smile twisted his features, “Or to alter lives and bodies.”
“I wish I had never fallen in love with Bruce.”
Well, actually, that’s the main problem. Things will never go back to normal.
There are awed faces all around Tony when Bruce transforms in front of the very informal gathering he called at the Compound, but Rhodey’s is definitely the funniest one. His mouth is wide open like a cartoon character and Tony can’t pass up the opportunity to take a picture for future blackmailing purposes.
Steve chuckles as he deposits a quick kiss on Tony’s lips.
Pepper throws him funny looks every time they video chat about the latest prosthetics and/or communications models Tony is working on for Stark Industries. Sometimes, other Avengers join him for a while, most often than not Steve or Natasha, but once, surprisingly, it is Clint who spends two hours sitting a few feet away from Tony. They don't exchange more than a couple of words the entire time Clint’s there but it loosens something inside Tony that he hadn't even known had been knotted up.
“You don’t?” Tony asks incredulously. “Tell me you’re not serious.”
Tony swallows, even though his mouth feels droughty, and the sound is incredibly loud in the stillness of the cockpit.
A year.
“No,” Tony answers. “Or maybe.. I don’t know, it’s—”
“I don’t want you to think that just because I’m offering that means you’ve got to take it,” Tony clarifies.  “Just like the first time this is only an offer, not an imposition. But I also don’t want you to think that if you accept it that means you need to go back to being Captain America right away.”
once as she had kissed his forehead and let him go back to sleep. His 48th birthday had been as unremarkable of a birthday as most but pain, during the few minutes he had been awake that day, had been the real protagonist of it, not Tony.
“Everything’s perfect,” Steve assures him, bringing his hands to the back of Tony’s thighs and tugging softly so the man has to place himself over Steve’s lap, straddling him.
“Yeah,” Tony murmurs in agreement. “Yeah.”
“Tony…,” Steve wails and that becomes the only word Steve seems able to pronounce.
This time his voice sounds softer, kinder. He’s not so much trying to make a statement but trying to apologize for his failings. He’s baring his soul to the universe and giving away the last part of his past self he still had kept hidden.
A little less than year ago Tony was waking up to Steve crying on him, resting his head dejectedly on his bed and letting Tony see him at his lowest. But in that moment Tony doesn't think Steve was making a conscious choice to trust Tony with his everything. The pain was so overwhelming Steve’s defenses had obviously given way and had not been able to withstand the blows any longer. He had simply broken down and there had been nothing he could have done about it.
It’s Pepper opening up about her stress with Stark Industries and Tony just listening to her, knowing all she needs in order to feel better is for him to be there as she vents. It’s Tony looking at her in wonder when she jokes around with him just as she’s always done, him wondering how he ever got lucky enough that she decided to give him her time.
“That sucks,” Tony ends up saying, because there is nothing more he can offer in words.
Tony, in a real show of maturity, sticks his tongue out, prompting a scoff from Natasha, still drinking slowly from her filled cup. Tony debates the risks of stealing the cup for himself but decides against it because a) he values his life, and b) Natasha likes her coffee overly sweet, more sugar than actual liquid.
The first several minutes are filled with small talk, mostly Pepper suggesting some of the restaurants dishes to him. A silence falls upon them as the waiter comes back again, this time to write down their food orders, and then leaves, leaving them both alone and with nothing to do but really talk or else the silence will still be keeping them company.
Tony asked himself again and again and again.
The combination of it all -Steve’s mouth on his ass, Steve’s tongue inside him, Steve jerking himself off while he eats Tony out enthusiastically- is too much for Tony to handle and for the first time in years, he comes untouched.
Steve had explained to Tony, during the slower-paced parts of the film, that even though it had been over 7 years since he had been pulled from the ice and his initial plans had been to catch up with as much pop culture as possible, his situation during most of those years hadn’t actually been conductive for that.
Tony nods, or at least he thinks he does, and he feels Nebula sit down on the seat next to his.
Steve doesn’t say anything at all, not that Tony would have heard him through the soundproofing of the workshop. He beckons Tony closer with his right hand as DUM-E starts approaching the door.
But he doesn’t say anything, he just gives Steve a couple of minutes so he can breathe deeply, sort his thoughts out and then speak.
_______________________________
Now that he thinks about it, Tony’s not sure he’s seen Steve truly happy either.
Tony has a minute where he all he can feel is disappointment flooding his every pore. This time there was no question, no yes or no possible answer. Steve was the one who made sure of that.
The memories come to him in less than a millisecond. It is definitely proof that he’s finally completely awake and alert.
Tony takes a tiny step forward, until the shield is grazing Steve’s knees where he’s seated.
Tony takes a step back but he doesn’t second guess it much when he keep a hold on Steve’s hand to pull him along behind him as he exists the room.
Even after his heart rate has slowed down and his limbs have stopped tingling, Tony feels off-kilter and depleted. Sometimes this still happens, this feeling of emptiness that fills his chest, this all-consuming nothingness that nests deep in his veins. It’s been like this on-and-off for years, for decades, really.
There are days they can’t stand to look at each other after their sessions, and not even just at each other but at anyone else they live with. The guilt is too powerful and they need to be alone. They all understand by now, luckily,  and it’s almost like it never happened when they rejoin life around the Compound.
_______________________________
Tony finds Steve where he said he would be: in his office. He must have finished the shopping he wanted to do because he’s now continuing his read of his book, turning pages carefully with the pad of his index finger.
“Don’t thank me,” Pepper pleads. “I wish I didn’t have to do this.”
“It had been coming for a while and it was a mutual thing. It’s sad but we’re both glad we did it.
If Tony takes his time to think about it his reluctance to see Steve has less to do with anger now and more with nerves.
Natasha follows his instruction and sits on one of the high kitchen chairs as Tony gets back to making the salad. He moves towards the refrigerator to grab more ingredients so the salad will be enough for both him and Natasha. The process is almost mindless -clean, peel, chop, clean, peel, chop- so he starts up a conversation with Natasha while doing it. There’s so many things to catch up on and most of it comes from Natasha.
Hi, everyone. We are going through some trying times at the moment and I sincerely hope you're all healthy and safe.
But even with all that there still had been a distance between them, a reticence from Steve’s side of things to see JARVIS as something other than a machine, a simple tool.
It sometimes feels even more difficult that when he first started having to deal with them. Back then the fear of dying was still because of his lack of understanding. Nowadays the fear of dying comes
“I think,” Tony says. “I’m starting to believe that too.”
There is nothing in the world like knowing Steve is on his corner like that, so loyal and devoted. Tony just wants the opportunity to show he can do the same for Steve. He needs Steve to let him.
“It really has,” Steve says and he places his hand on top of where her rests on his arms and squeezes lightly, making Pepper smile sweetly at him.
The conversation has taken such a turn it’s almost dizzying. This was supposed to become a fight, if anything. A heated argument rooted in Steve’s irresponsibly made statements to the public that have put the Avengers in an uncomfortable situation, in a precarious state.
There isn’t a reversal for the Decimation, Tony has come to terms with that no matter how much it hurts.
If Steve had any doubts before about where Tony wanted this to go they’ve now been completely vanished.
“FRIDAY told me you were back,” Steve tells Bruce. “Everything okay?”
Steve squares his jaw and he runs one of his hands through his hair.
In a way it had proven that the Avengers weren’t the dream Tony had wanted them to be. They were convenient, not inseparable and for Tony, who had so many expectations and desires set on them, it had felt like a blow stricken directly to the heart.
“I don’t hate you, Tony,” Steve assures him. “I’m sorry that I’ve made you believe that.”
Tony thinks back at her.
His speech is slurred but his voice is just as commanding as Tony has always remembered it. It fills the entire room even when his posture makes him look small somehow. It’s obvious that he has gained weight, his body no longer the perfect specimen Tony always wondered if magic kept. This image of him makes him look so much more human that Tony has ever thought him to be.
It takes him a while, but as soon as he’s free of the garment he balls it up and places it on the floor, resting his head on top of it.
Tony can spot almost all of these signs by taking one quick glance at Steve as he enters the kitchen and their eyes lock.
But for the first time in over 2 years thinking about his parents feels manageable again. It feels like something to still feel sad about but not something to let kill him.
There’s no hesitation in Rhodey’s stride as he makes his way towards his bed and grabs his hand. Their fingers intertwine.
“They’re not kids.”
Time is still irrelevant but Steve has the feeling that the coming down from it was as long as the unraveling itself.
And in the end, he was proven right about that, and that was what had probably hurt the most, the fact that he had been lulled into a false sense of security about her standing by his side when he should have known from the very beginning that it could never last.
“I couldn’t stop him.”
It only takes 10 minutes after Rhodey’s departure for Tony’s room to become a beacon for superheroes and aliens alike to come see him.
Steve touches the spot on his own neck that matches the one he wrote down for Tony as Tony’s next message comes through.
Steve’s voice sounds louder now that it has before. His words are unwavering and the tone of them drips honesty. Tony lifts his gaze and finds Steve already looking back at him. His face doesn't show the same confidence his voice does. He looks apprehensive, almost fearful. Tony hates that he was the one to put that look on his face.
Steve and Tony are sitting in the Avengers’ common living room, no one else from the team around, as reruns of Friends play on TV but they are not really paying attention. They’re positioned so Tony’s back is to Steve’s broad chest and the blond has been thumbing the hem of Tony’s t-shirt for the past 10 minutes. Tony’s t-shirt that is
“Yes, I did,” Tony reiterates.
In the end it’s that last name that changes Tony’s entire stance too; his shoulders drop, his hands unclench and his jaw unsnaps from where it’d had been horribly biting down on his teeth, the tension of the muscles already giving him a headache.
In the end avoiding Tony is a lot more complicated that Steve would have thought. Especially because Tony starts seeking him out.
He’d been doubtful -and maybe even a little afraid- to let all his inhibitions go and truly let them in.
The table bobbles as Tony rapidly stands and knocks into it with his thighs. Bruce and Rhodey reach over to keep their glasses from spilling while turning to look at him, just as Natasha and Steve do. Steve’s hand is hovering in the air, like he started reaching for Tony but stopped halfway through and now doesn't know what to do with it.
Time seems to stop when Steve stops in his tracks, eyes focused intensely on the clothes he’s holding. Tony gulps and braces himself for the question coming,  questions he has yet to find the answers for. But nothing happens as Steve shakes out of his stupor and moves to leave the items perched in one of the armchairs of the room.
There is surprise and there is predictability in seeing Steve through the glass. He’s sitting on the floor, in the middle of the room, DUM-E, Butterfingers and U surrounding him.
“It hurt, yeah, and it was a shock to know that they had been murdered but…” Tony has to stop to take a deep breath through his mouth and to gather himself before the tears he can feel gathering in his eyes fall. “You knew, Steve. You knew.”
Tony looks pointedly at the glass walls of the recovery room but he doesn’t comment on it, knowing they’re all way too preoccupied with the fate of the world at their hands to notice insignificant details like that.
His tone is teasing, light and his eyes are warm and inviting.
“And although I could see how much that hurt you, I understood. I saw it too. I saw that you weren't in a good place and I wanted to help but I think you made the right decision. You made the right call.”
“You literally just said it wasn't about my bad day,” Tony points out. “So make up your fucking mind, Steve.”
At the moment, Tony thinks if anyone were to be granted a look at them from the outside, all they’d see is two adversaries, two clearly divided sides going one against the other. Tony is desperate to break that illusion and bring them back to the same side, back to being partners and having each other’s backs in all battles and wars.
Tony looks at her and then promptly looks back down at his tablet, pressing down on the button to turn off the screen, and leaving the device resting on his stretched legs.
Rhodey comes to stay at the Compound for a couple of weeks at the beginning of September.
Pepper chuckles lightly, just a breathe of air through her nose.
Steve has been holding on so tightly to a loosely balanced rope, a rope that kept rotting no matter how much Steve ignored the signs.
“They were about you, yeah. They are about you. About me, too,” Tony clarifies.
Tony himself is engrossed in the movie playing in front of him right until the moment he realizes how close to Steve he’s actually sitting.
He continues by saying that nothing made any kind of sense when they got there because Carol proclaimed Thanos was completely alone, no defenses, no allies. Just him.
Steve looks almost glowing with the sun shining from in front of him, but his face is anything but peaceful or content at the moment. There’s a deep frown set in his expression, harsh lines he didn’t use to have when Tony first met him grooving his face.
They’re rowdy, and excitable, and fun, and sweet and Steve feels his chest bursting with fondness every time he goes down to visit them to what would have been Tony’s workshop at the Tower had he had time to actually live here.
“I guess it can seem… strange, that I wanted to talk to you even though we had never met before,” Pepper agrees.
“Oh,” Steve murmurs. “No, sorry, I… I didn’t”
“It means a lot that you stay around, Tony. That you really do think I’m good company.”
_______________________________
“I’m fine. The only thing bruised is my pride.”
“But you guys will get through this,” Tony says and he regrets to hear his voice sounding less convincing that he’d like it to. “I know things aren’t great right now but you guys can stay friends. You can go back to normal.”
He brings his left hand up as well and presses the palm of it on Bruce’s other cheek.
Before Bruce can respond to the question Steve appears on the doorway previously occupied by Natasha and Tony.
It’s a Saturday and Tony’s not alone.
Steve is the one to respond.
Bruce smiles softly at her and he’s looking into her eyes when he says, “I promise.”
Steve looks around the establishment.
They fall asleep still tangled, Pepper’s head back to resting on Tony’s chest, their hands intertwined and their hearts both a little lighter and a little heavier.
Today, Steve has prepared dinner for all of them after they had not eaten lunch together, an anomaly in their routine that had surprisingly knocked Tony a bit askew. Natasha had been in meetings all day long, Steve had ventured into the city for a couple errands he had to run and Tony had taken the opportunity to have lunch with Pepper, her in Malibu in her office as she ate a salad from one of her favorite French restaurants and Tony in one of the conference rooms as he ate some leftovers from Bruce’s dinner from the night before.
When Steve looked around he noticed that his friends had moved a couple of feet away, giving him and Tony a little bit of privacy.
He gives up fighting the regrets that keep trying to take over his mind and just lets them feast. In Afghanistan most of them had to do with having spent most of his life in a drunken haze, not having been a good enough friend to Rhodey and not having been honest about his growing feelings for Pepper. Space awakens in him this relentless grief about Peter and his failure to protect him. Space is also witness to his despair over not having been able to help Rhodey better and not having been able to keep his promises to Pepper.
The first few days he does so he tries to make it as inconspicuous as possible. He emails Pepper about a Stark Industries’ project they hadn’t quite set a date for yet and suggests speeding the process along. It makes him feel better, knowing that even though what he’s doing is totally his decision he is at least not entirely lying when he says he’s “too busy”.
“See?” Tony asks, turning back towards Rhodey but not letting of of Steve’s hand. “Steve would always be on my team.”
Steve sighs and he shakes his head before continuing and Tony hadn’t realized before but his fingers are nervously twitching where his hands rest on his lap.
On September 25th the day starts like any other and Tony prepares himself to figuratively cross off another day of the year. There is nothing to indicate that the day won’t be as normal as the last, no storming looming on the horizon, no warning bell or signal.
Thor, for the first time in months, brights up during conversations. He gleefully asks Steve and Tony to recount their getting together story time and time again, like he’s absorbing joy through them. He feels so much more like the Thor Tony used to see, the one that lived for other people, the one whose entire personality expanded when he was faced with other people.
_______________________________
Steve nods as he pads closer to the coffee maker and serves himself a cup of coffee. He takes the milk carton that Tony left on the counter and shakes it to see how much is still left. He empties it in his mug and he carefully breaks it and folds it before throwing it in its respective trash can. He opens the cupboard where the sugar is usually kept but he doesn't find it there. Tony holds it up for him to see when his eyes start searching the kitchen.
If Steve had thought he was mortified before he had no words to explain his feelings in that moment.
There’s the Steve who loves Tony, because he does, this Steve can now say that he does. This is the man that Tony unknowingly helped through it all. The Steve that has grown and matured and accepted his fate even if he still has regrets and things he wouldn’t have chosen for himself.
That picture is not what Steve’s looking at right now.
JARVIS doesn't wait for the go ahead and he directly starts projecting the images Pepper and Rhodey had been describing before.
Tony frowns, confused.
It’s Steve and him, of course. But it’s Steve and him getting to be together in the Compound, surrounded by their people almost every day.
It’s good they’re making a future for themselves instead of just working to make it happen for other people.
“Yeah,” Rhodey agrees. “No offense, Cap, but I wouldn’t have believed it either.”
It’s been six months since he came back to her when she thought all hope was lost.
Tony nods and he takes that small leap towards the edge he couldn’t take where Steve was concerned.
This is most definitely one of those moments.
They stay in silence a couple of minutes, Steve obviously waiting for Tony to say something -most likely something incendiary- and Tony refusing to speak.
Tony swallows and his throat feels suddenly parched. He grabs his glass quickly and drinks all the water in it in one continuous gulp.
Thor’s eyes are only halfway open and he’s blinking slowly, clearly not all the way awake yet. He pushes his hair, falling messily onto his forehead, away from his face.
“You know it isn’t fair how well you look when I look like this.” Tony gestures vaguely to his own body.
Steve looks surprised and Tony can’t blame him because he’s gravely shocked too.
Peter had stopped in front of his apartment block and had walked a couple steps forwards until he got in front of Tony and wrapped his arms around him. Tony’s arms had raised slowly and had settled in the middle of the kid’s back.
But almost 3 months into the world post-Decimation Tony can almost one hundred percent say that Natasha, Bruce and Steve have turned into the closest family he has ever had.
And yet.
“Together,” Tony finishes for him. “We can do this together.”
Everything is trembling around him or maybe it is just him.
“I appreciate everything you’re saying. It means more than I can possibly say. But this isn’t about my guilt or my self-blame,” Tony clarifies. “Believe me, I am working on that. I want to talk about how you’re feeling. I want you to explain to me what you’re thinking.”
“I honestly can’t understand what you’re saying,” Steve confirms. “I know I’m not your kind of genius but goddamn it, I don’t understand. Bad decision? Ruin us? What is it that you can’t talk to me about because it could ruin us? What…?”
He thinks he makes a painful noise, close to a sob but not quite, but Nebula doesn’t react to it. She just finally lets go of his hand and he suddenly and inexplicably feels cold. She can’t be feeling particularly well herself but Nebula’s movements are reassured and practical. She presses the button that opens the ship door and Tony can hear the mechanical grinding that must signify a ramp is extending towards the ground.
Tony nods towards the coffee machine. “There’s coffee if you want some.”
“I’m sorry too,” Tony replies, and instantly he watches Steve’s whole body deflate, like it has just let go of all the tension it was carrying. “What a truly terrible night, huh?”
Tony keeps being silent but he extends his arms so he can rest his hands on top of Steve’s where they’re placed on top of the table. The move drives Steve to meet his eyes and Tony nods encouragingly at him, letting him know he can keep going.
The days pass slowly but the weeks fly by and before Tony even realizes it he’s celebrating his 49th birthday.
Natasha grabs her fork again and takes a mouthful of salad to eat from it. When she stops chewing and swallows it she smiles apologetically at Tony.
“Thor killed Thanos?” Tony repeats, more confused than shocked.
Tony looked at Natasha and she looked back at him. Both of them seemed to be having a conversation only through their eyes and a few eyebrow movements on Tony’s part. Whatever it was that they had both silently said made Tony face Steve again and walk purposefully in his direction.
Since the Decimation happened, the Avengers -or what’s available and left of them- haven’t been needed to fight or protect the Earth, too damaged and affected to really be a beacon for any kind of show of strength or power, and whatever little troubles they’ve gone through have been easily handled by official authorities around the world or small-time superheroes that Tony trusts and has let be during this time.
_______________________________
But Steve is Steve and the sense of duty he feels in regards to this day is unbreakable.
Steve was mortified. He could feel himself flushing and, even though he knew it was impossible, it was as if the whole street had gone silent at the impact.
When they reach the bed, Steve drops Tony on it, who laughs lightly when he bounces a couple times on the mattress, and lies over him, pinning Tony’s wrist above his head and starts sucking on his neck, making sure to leave a mark that will be visible on Tony’s skin for days.
“It isn't
“What were you doing that had you so focused?” Tony asks, bending down at the waist to place a soft kiss on Steve’s forehead.
Tony calls him a romantic every time Steve plans any special dates for them. He usually follows the statement with an eye roll but Steve is always able to spot the blush that colors Tony’s cheeks. He would most likely deny it but Tony loves the care Steve takes to plan special evenings for them. He likes feeling pampered and cherished and Steve loves making him feel that way.
Tony has never seen Steve cry, not once in the 6 years he’s known him.
“Of course,” he says. “I still don’t know exactly why you wanted us to meet but I wasn’t going to say no.”
He’s frustrated because he can’t sleep and he’s frustrated for wanting to even sleep.
He wakes up but he doesn’t open his eyes, just listens to unidentifiable loud noises that could be voices or could be dreams. He somehow knows he’s alone in the room.
But accepting Peggy wasn't the one for him didn't mean Steve opened himself up to the possibility that there really was someone out there for him. Someone to suit him and understand him, someone who would never cower to him but also wouldn't be dazzled by what he sometimes represents, someone he could share every single aspect of his life with, including the bizarre and the hard parts. Steve didn't dream about that any longer.
Steve scoffs at Tony’s question, shaking his head.
Tony stands quickly from his chair, nearly knocking it over and making Steve look at him in concern. He clears his throat as he puts down his spoon and avoids looking at Steve’s bright, blue eyes.
“I’m sorry,” Pepper apologizes. “I didn't mean to surprise you like that.”
Although Tony’s tone was anything but humorous Steve cracks a little smile. Tony can read bitterness in it but nothing else and although he tries to decipher it further it leaves Steve’s face before Tony can make out anymore more concrete about it.
In the space of a couple heartbeats Steve makes an almost unconscious decision, more reflex than choice and he starts leaning towards Tony, his back moving away from the couch, his left arm finding placement behind Tony’s head and taking most of Steve’s weight.
“Well, thank you,” Tony says, lowering his eyes to his pasta and pushing it around the plate a little. “Pasta is really the only thing I’m good at cooking so at least there are a lot of ways in which you can make it.”
“I’m actually dying to get in the shower,” Steve comments as he tugs on the neckline of the dress shirt he’s still wearing.
Nine.
time, this has happened.
He takes the sweatshirt first and pulls it over his head. His nose catches the familiar scent in a second -a little earthy and a little deep- and it confirms Tony’s suspicions about the sweatshirts’s ownership. If that wasn’t enough, the fact that the item of clothing hangs from Tony’s body and the sleeves go way past his hands is also more than enough hint.
Rhodey falls asleep only fifteen minutes into the first movie. His neck is bent at a weird angle so Tony carefully places a pillow behind it. He knows Rhodey way too well at this point and he can already picture him tomorrow complaining about the pain while denying it having anything to do with his age.
“The Avengers haven’t been truly active in a long time. Hell, Iron Man hasn’t been truly active in a while. Sometimes I feel the need to go out and be Iron Man because it is who I am but… I still can’t go to how things were before. I guess I’ve evolved. Tony Stark
They’re in Tony’s workshop, Steve sitting down in the couch that Tony bought specifically for the times Steve goes down there to sketch or read in Tony’s presence, and Tony is standing by his workbench not actually working anymore, just moving around holograms and zooming in and out of pictures, clearly just trying to avoid talking to Steve.
But just because he goes to bed earlier than he’s ever gone to bed before except for his early childhood doesn’t mean his sleep is better. It doesn’t mean peace finds him as his head rests on the pillow.
The portal closes and Stark doesn’t come back down.
Pepper reaches over across the table and places her right hand over his left, squeezing gently.
At one point he says, “Rhodey, I was in
people, the ones he can’t bear to lose.
“I know we weren’t the best of friends, believe me I know. But we were friends,” Tony continues. “At least I thought we were. I trusted you and I cared about you even if I wasn’t good at showing it. It wasn’t Barnes that made me go absolutely mad, and it wasn’t the fact that Captain America had lied to me. It was that I never believed Steve Rogers would do something like that to me.”
Steve frowns and he tilts his head to the side, his eyes narrowed in confusion.
What an strangely comforting dream to hold on to.
Steve swallows and his eyes fill with tears when he remembers how hard those first few weeks were for Tony’s best friends.
“I don’t think it’d go over well if we all tried to talk to him,” Natasha points out. “That’s almost as bad as letting Valkyrie run away now.”
“Captain Rogers is requesting everyone’s presence in the living room.”
A light. A bright yellow light. A light so radiant he can see it even with his eyes closed.
But in a short amount of time so many things have changed.
His words might have sounded a bit too harsh but Tony wants to make it clear that this is something he would never hold against Steve.
Tony’s gone, he’s been gone for months, and every little thing Steve finds endearing and sweet and funny and brave about him is gone too.
“I’ve been telling you about Steve,” Tony denies. “There’s nothing going on.”
Tony exhales through the nose, a small and soundless chuckle. “Yeah, oh.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asked. “Did I hurt you?”
He says it as if they were for sure going to be seeing each other tomorrow.
Those days they rely on each other, always within a set of boundaries they’re working hard to create. They want to help each other but they can’t depend unhealthily on the other saving them.
Tony’s heart is beating wildly inside his chest and he can feel Steve going rigid next to him, his hands fisting on the couch’s cushions. He can’t see Bruce from his position but he can hear the surprised exhalation he just let out.
“I just…,” Steve starts saying, his eyes looking up to the ceiling. “There’s so many things I want to say, so many things I want to talk about… With you. I want to talk about them with you but…”
His thoughts are moving a thousand miles per second, theories and conjectures and plans already taking shape in his head. One persistent thought keeps making itself known, stretching and taking space up in Tony’s brain in full technicolor.
“I could come with you,” Tony offers when he sees Natasha struggling.
“I just want you to know that I mean it, okay?” Tony says. “Just because I’m back and you don’t like me doesn’t mean you have to give up Pepper’s and Rhodey’s friendships. They’re great friends to have and I would know.”
“And we are!”
(He does. He really, truly does.)
“I know,” Steve concedes closing his eyes and exhaling strongly through his nose. “I just don’t understand what is so bad about this.”
Steve takes a couple more steps into the room and he notices Tony sitting on the feet of the bed. His entire face lights up and Tony can’t fathom a day when Steve’s smiles don’t wake up something magical inside him, something he never even thought he had before.
“Everyone who needs to be here is here,” Natasha explains. “This is about Thor.”
The first one shows two emojis, the angel and the heart-eyed face. Steve, now well-versed in the art of Tony-Text, guesses this is Tony’s way of saying Steve looks like an angel that he’s very much in love with.
“Well,” Steve looked down at Tony, “Why don’t we put my strength to good use?”
“It would appear so sir. Which leaves the third and most likely suspect. A young man who had come into R+D within the last six months and has suddenly resigned without warning. Edward Bartlett. I have looked into him further and he has terminated the lease on his apartment, turned in his car, and emptied his bank account.”
*****
Clint grinned, “What doesn’t kill ya….”
Tony beckoned the boy further into the garage and the torch the boy was carrying revealed the armour. “OHMYGOD!”
“At least Stogers isn’t your portmanteau.” Clint offered as he scrolled on a tablet, “That just sounded wrong.” He gave a suggestive leer and shoved a handful of cheeseballs into his mouth.
“Sure.” Tony said giving Steve a smile, “Pull up a seat.” He said pointing to the table and chairs.
“Aww Nicky, were you worried about me?” Tony teased blowing Fury a kiss just to piss the man off.
“I suppose its too much to hope that they might blow themselves up with it?” Steve asked, but it wasn’t really a question, they all knew they wouldn’t be that lucky.
“Let him in Friday,” Tony said, flicking through the files and pausing on one that was dated December 1991.
“Well that’s great.” Steve said, pushing off the wall which he’d been leaning against with one shoulder, “If you’ve found it then you can fix it, right?”
“Well first you can start eating and drinking again, you can be honest when we ask how you are feeling, and you can just let us be around you.” Steve said, “The rest will take care of itself.”
It was adorable and so moving, the way Zach earnestly looked up at him, those impossible chocolate eyes pleading with him to say yes, while his little body vibrated with excitement.
“I know.” Peter whispered sniffling and wiping his nose on Tony’s shirt as he nodded his head, making Tony cringe, why did Kids have to be so filthy?
“Has Santa been in the night?” Steve asked, sitting up and pulling Zach into his lap so Tony could take a few minutes to try and wake himself up properly.
“Well it sounds that way to me.” Steve growled, “And I am damned if I am going to be sat here and be accused of things I haven’t done.” He got to his feet and stormed over to the lift.
Once enough wood, branches, and vines were acquired, Tony had Zach fetch some flat sided but sharp edged rocks which he had Peter use to sand down to the wood for the planks, which he then set about binding together with the vines and the branches.
“I’d have killed them if they had dared put so much as a finger on you.” Steve growled, startling himself and Tony with the vehemence in his voice. He shifted uncomfortably and glanced away as Tony started the car and pulled out of the car park.
“No, but I want to be home in a few days.” Tony replied, “I don’t like being away from my children for long periods.”
"What's his condition?" Steve demanded, "When can we see him?"
Deapool as always had an inappropriate comment to make things absolutely no better at all.
“Jay I hope you are back up to spec, buddy.” Tony whispered.
Natasha Romanoff’s family.
It had taken him the better part of a week to do that, and another ten days to make the floors habitable again. But at least the work had kept him from thinking, from dwelling on his fucked up life.
******
Loki sat quietly on the jet, too quietly, which Steve pointed out to Tony, who didn’t seem that bothered, and made some comment about some form of exercise and referred to Steve as a capsicle. The Omega’s arrogance and disregard for him ground on Steve’s already frayed nerves and he would probably have said more but at that moment Loki’s brother Thor arrived and things went to hell with Stark flying off after Thor and Loki and Steve taking a parachute to join them.
“They want their own private army of mutants.” Tony said, “Ross has wanted that since Bruce and the Hulk first came on the scene, he tried to recreate it with Abomination but that blew up in his face. Abomination is too dangerous and can’t be controlled.”
Fury regarded him coolly, “You know what your asking is murder.”
Wanda shrugged, “The same as I did for the rest of you, I made him see his worst fear.” She replied, “His was seeing you all dead, being the last one standing,” A cruel smirk twisted her lips, “You blamed him, in the vision I mean. You told him he should have done more and then died in his arms.”
The problem with this was that he didn’t know what to do.
*****
Happily he put on his boots and then sat down in a chair so Pepper’s hurriedly brought in stylist could comb and gel his hair into what she considered fashionable perfection.
Feeling exposed in more ways than one, Tony quickly grabbed his vest and pulled it on to cover himself, he flinched as Steve’s hands moved to the sagging waist band of his trousers and batted at the hands with his cheeks flushing, “I can do it.”
“Oh my God!” Sam said looking at the eclectic feast laid out before them.
“Indeed, Sir, and shall I alert Mr Hogan and Dr Banner as to what is occurring?”
“Well, this thing has Tony’s memories, that suggests that there was some kind of link between them, one that I would guess is now broken, since this things form was revealed against its will. He was electrocuted right?” Rhodey nodded, “Tony may have felt a jolt through the link, something to… give him some encouragement and maybe spark some hope in him that help is coming, all he needs to do is send us a sign.”
“I don’t expect anything from you,” Steve promises. “I don’t need you to tell me you love me too because I understand it’s too soon. I also would understand if this changes things for you, if you’re not interested any longer in exploring anything between us. But Tony…”
Tony clears his throat and places his hands under his thighs, sitting on them, so he won’t fidget with them excessively. His fingers still tick nervously under his legs but he just presses his thighs further into the couch’s cushion.
Steve muffles a groan as he pinches his left nipple between his index and thumb. Quickly, he moves his hand towards his right nipple and does the same to it. His cell vibrates in his hand as he’s doing it and the reminder of Tony being a participant in this even when he isn’t physically next to Steve finally does tore the moan out of Steve’s throat.
“All I know is that I feel like I’ve left him alone when he needs me most. Valkyrie says he has completely isolated himself, only letting Korg in when he needs him to bring him things. We’re all going through this, but at least we’re going through this together.”
For now, though, although it reigns high in the sky, full and blue and enticing, it’s not succeeding at capturing anyone’s attention in the Avengers Compound living room. Steve and Tony, the only two people in the room at the moment, are too busy bickering and throwing each other popcorn to pay it much attention.
“Same old, same old,” Rhodey responds. His voice then grows softer. “You’re welcome, Nat.”
Steve chuckles with him.
“Clint, man, this is not something we can just make go away,” Tony explains from his position on the couch next to Steve. “And we all know this is just a bunch of bureaucratic bullshit, anyway. I doubt it will have strong, negative repercussions. But it can’t be swept under the rug, not even with the world in this state.”
“Well, we didn’t even make it past the foreplay before we came,” Tony explains. “How teenager-y of us.”
Natasha follows his permission and walks into the room, directly walking to the bed’s right side and looking down at him.
“-that are still working, are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did, he did exactly what he said he was going to do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent of all living creatures.”
Uncrossing his arms, Steve opens his mouth as if to say something but he seems to think better of it and he closes it again and exhales through his nose.
The Avengers, for better or worse, are not the most important part of the equation.
Steve nodded at the explanation and nervously adjusted his hat.
“So many things had happened to you then and so many things have happened since then and I just… I feel like this is the right time. Now. Finally.”
“Hey.” Tony whispers back while Steve nears him. Once he is close enough, Steve leans down and cups Tony’s face in one of the palms of his hands, kissing him sweetly on the lips. The kiss is pretty chaste but Tony tries to deepen it and he gets Steve to bite his lower lip. Tony moans and places his hands on Steve’s waist, moving one of them quickly to palm Steve’s ass.
It brings him back but not entirely.
“I wasn’t the most supportive person in the world when Tony became Iron Man,” she starts explaining. “We were just beginning to explore our feelings for each other and I was so worried all the time about him, about what he was doing… I was constantly thinking of how I would lose him and how selfish he was for making me feel that afraid.”
“You’ve been on the workshop for almost two days, Tony. You need to sleep.” Steve pronounces. The blonde moves away from the bed and walks towards the closet entering the room that he was once scandalized about (
It’s cold to the touch even though it hasn’t seen the outside of Tony’s closet in months, since that night sometime in late summer of last year when Steve had so politely refused to take it back.
His head is resting on the center of Tony’s chest, right where the arc-reactor is. One of Tony’s arms is wrapped around Steve’s shoulders while the other is stretched over them as he takes the picture. Tony’s head is turned so that half his face is hidden by Steve’s head and his lips can press against the crown of his head. His eyes are half closed, his expression so blissful it makes Steve’s heart skip a beat.
There had also been another reason Clint’s reveal had been sort of an unbalancing point for him.
But Tony doesn’t sit on the couch.
“It was an accident, I swear. I was aiming for Natasha but she ducked.”
Entering his text conversation with Tony Steve reads the last message displayed on it, where Tony asked him to
Steve stays silent as he looks to the side and bites his lip. Tony tracks with his eyes the path of a lone tear that stars rolling down Steve’s chiseled cheekbone.
No matter the reason, Steve is a good leader even when he’s not trying to be. People follow him even when he doesn't ask them to.
Maria Stark, dressed in long, silk gowns and tall, pointy heels, looked perfectly made for such sophisticated clothing. She was queen of everything from what Tony could perceive, the air of rooms suddenly changing every time she walked through the doors. She commanded attention but she never seemed to demand it, and she would look radiant even in the grayest of days.
“I would never play paintball with you, Tony. Never,” Rhodey emphasizes.
“That’s what I think the root of the problem is,” Tony says.
_______________________________
Tentatively, and almost shyly, Tony starts moving his right hand across the mattress, trying to find Pepper’s hand. At first he gently bumps against her shoulder but she must guess his intentions because she immediately reaches over with her hand to grab his.
“I love you.”
But then he thinks of Natasha. He thinks of every version of her he has ever known. He thinks of her when they’ve been at their best, two complex and layered people that don’t always understand the other but still love each other the same. He thinks of her when they’ve been at their worst, when he’s felt betrayed by her and she’s probably felt disappointed by him. Tony thinks of Natasha and the fact that she’s family. Imperfect and complicated family, but family nonetheless.
But Natasha’s patience is visibly running thin and Tony decides to intervene to give her a much deserved break as she brings her thumb and index finger to press high on the bridge of her nose.
- Tony has felt the full blow of December 16th like never before, and he had been expecting -fearing and dreading- that it’d be worse now that he had Steve close. That the guilt of having forgiven Steve for the secret he kept for so long would have only enhanced the pain and the torture of that day.
For a second Tony thinks of pressing the button again and not doing it. It seems like resignation and giving up and admitting to himself that this it it, the end, no more coming back from it. But his fear trumps his pride for once and he takes a deep breath before he starts to speak.
“Yeah,” Steve confirms, getting closer to Tony and the bots as he walks into the room. “Just felt like knocking I guess.”
“Cap, hey, hey, look at me,” Tony calls but Steve is still breathing heavily and not really listening to him.
When Bruce finally comes into the room it’s obvious he has just woken up. He’s wearing his thick-rimmed glasses askew, his t-shirt is visibly inside out and he’s barefoot. He’s also panting lightly, like he power-walked the length of the hallway from his room to the living room.
Iron Man, we’ve evolved.”
When Tony wakes up in the morning, FRIDAY gradually letting in more sunlight from the outside through the windows, Pepper has already left and the engagement ring she had been wearing on her finger for over a year has been placed on the nightstand on her side of the bed.
Tony coughs as Steve is still looking around the room, both to soothe his dry throat and to try and alleviate the tension that he can feel already building up between them, before Steve has even made eye contact with him again.
Tony moves so he can sit to Bruce’s right and he puts his arm around Bruce’s shoulders slowly, not wanting to startle him.
“It sounds perfect,” Steve answers. “We can do this…”
“But during these times the Avengers are not the real heroes. All of you, who keep living day by day with so much pain inside you, who show your strength in the most unlikely of moments, you’re the heroes. The world needs you just as much as it needs the Avengers, if not more. We, the Avengers, need you. We need you to support your neighbors, to support your communities. We need you to stay on the right path. We need you to not lose hope.”
On another memorable occasion, Rhodey had showed up halfway through
Steve turns but before he can begin walking away Miss Pott’s voice calls him.
Tony’s hand tickles. He is now rubbing his whole palm against Steve’s cheek and not just his thumb and the hairs on his arm bristle at the full contact. It’s a pleasant feeling and Tony can’t deny that he’s been thinking about how Steve’s stubble would feel tot he touch for the past three days.
Tony frowns as Bruce points towards one of the water bottles Tony had brought outside with him. Tony nods, signaling it’s okay for Bruce to pick it up and drink.
“Go to the ground floor, trauma centre waiting room.” The consultant said.
“No, not that, the… flirting and breaking all that tension.” Steve said, “I thought I’d choke on my tongue, but you just handled it without batting an eye.”
Natasha and Clint easily took down the guards hardly making a sound as they swiftly and expertly dealt with them, while Tony entered the property and followed the scent of sex, stale alcohol, pot, and bad plumbing.
“And can I purchase more, say seventy to eighty, the lake included?”
Was Steve doing this because he was looking to reclaim what he’d had with his own Tony. Was he making do with this universes pale imitation? Tony had no doubts that Steve’s Tony had been twice the man he was. He’d certainly not made the same mistakes, and he and Steve had been married, they had a daughter together, of course Steve wanted him back, would have him any way he could.
Tony called ahead to the compound, to let the team know he was heading there, and that there was something important they had to talk about, but he didn’t tell the team about Steve and Lily until they had arrived.
“On my mark Sam, fire!” Rhodey ordered, together they rained down on Proxima, backed up by Bucky who fired the staff at her. They kept up the onslaught until she was gone, then turned their attention on the Hyena/warg creatures.
“This is beautiful.” Tony said a little misty eyed.
“Probably what I am going to say right now.”
As for those of you who are bullying others. I won’t name you or ask you to stand up. I will say this. Stop. Now. You might think you are funny; you might think you aren’t doing anything serious; you might think this is all a big joke. Well guess what, it is not, and this behaviour, this could follow you, out of school, when it comes time to applying for colleges they will want to know what kind of person you before they grant scholarships and the like, they aren’t going to want someone who is known to be violent or disruptive on their campus. Future employers won’t have someone like that working for them, and remember, thanks to social media practically your whole life is on display for the world to see, so if you do get named as a bully, then colleges, employers, even future romantic interests will likely learn of it and be disinclined to accept you.
“I am serious, I’ll confiscate your repulsors and leave you earth bound and helpless, you’ll be forced to clunk around like the Tin Man from Wizard of Oz, and don’t you think that’ll give you an oil can when you rust up!”
After a tearful goodbye, Tony turned back to Steve, Thor, and Hulk, who pretended they couldn’t see the tears in his eyes or the tracks down his cheeks, “Let’s get this finished then,” He said, with a shaky smile, “Then, we’ll pick up Shwarma and head to the Mansion in Long Island, Zach hasn’t tried Shwarma yet but I’ll bet he’ll love it.”
“Tony that isn’t true. You didn’t invite Killian to shoot up Zach with the virus, you didn’t tell Osborn to have his spiders bite Pete, you didn’t do any of this.”
“Yes, and normally, since it is a first offence, that would be it, aside from trash picking duty for two weeks when he came back into school, and detention for two weeks during breaks.” The Principal said, “But, as the fight was with Mr Osborn’s son…” He trailed off and gave Tony a helpless look.
Tony also needed to get Zach to his lab as soon as possible and start working on stabilizing Extremis.
They stared at each other, momentarily speechless and Clint snorted at them, “Yeah, sure, whatever you two. Go have fun, drink champagne, pull a moony to a few Paps, break a senator or two, and be back by midnight!”
“Lies, so many lies.” Tony said, he rolled over so he was facing the ceiling, “Maybe they will take after you, be blonde and blue eyed.”
“And now my penis has joined my balls. This is great, I now sexless, five minutes in this lunatics company and I am sexless.”
“Uh, do you have anything to eat?” Steve asked blushing a little, it was at times embarrassing that he had to eat so much, but his metabolism now ran so fast that he had no choice. It had been difficult back in the war with the rationing and he’d felt guilty, getting double the rations to everyone else, he’d made it a rule to never complain, to eat whatever was put in front of him regardless of whether or not he actually enjoyed it, after all, what right did he have to complain about the food he was getting when he was getting far more nutrition than anyone else?
“Listen up perverts!” She yelled, “Peter is not screwing any of you in webs, nor is he wearing spandex, leather, or any other type of bondage clothing, so go back to looking at internet porn you sad twisted freaks!”
“so how’s it looking?”
The uncommon but possible side effects were worse, anaphylactic shock being the most lethal of course.
“He did!” Peter agreed, “He grabbed me right out of school and had the gun at my head!”
“But I soon will.”
“That’s not a bad idea, good one Jay.” Tony said.
“Four, and he was traumatised as you would expect, it also took time for him to control his new abilities.” Steve smiled fondly, “He is a very resilient child though, he was declaring himself the Superhero Fire Cracker right away!”
Growing up in the depression Steve was no stranger to abuse. Desperate times made people more volatile, less inclined to care for others as they were struggling to care for themselves, and it wasn’t the done thing to mention that the Omega next door always had a black eye, or the Beta Woman was sporting a fat lip or had a broken arm, just as no one really noticed anything amiss when a child or Pup was beaten with a belt, or had his/her face backhanded, was sent to bed without supper.
“Why, why did you hurt Mamma?” Peter demanded, his bottom lip shaking and eyes brimming with tears.
“Oh shut up.” Tony grumbled,
The nurse's expression became even more sympathetic, "At this stage it is too soon to say. The consultant will have more information for you when he has Peter stabilized."
“Isn’t it?” Tony asked, “I chose to have the sceptre here. I said that no one would get to it, believed that my systems couldn’t be beaten, that I could face any threat and then Killian starts blowing shit up and everything goes to hell, all because of my damn ego.” He kicked at the nearest table making it shudder and scattered a box of screws across the floor.
Peter honestly didn’t think the pain could get worse until the first crunch of bone, when that happened he wasn’t even able to scream, everything went white inside his head and it was like the whole world had become white noise, he could focus on nothing, not even the pain that was searing through him, another crunch and oddly enough that one he didn’t feel, he couldn’t feel anything beyond that first wave of agony, couldn’t register anything anymore.
Laughing Steve rubbed his back and promised him a massage when they got home.
“Right, thank you Doctor.” Tony said relieved it wasn’t anything more serious but also dreading keeping Zach from scratching once the itching started, time to file his sons nails right down so he wouldn’t hurt himself, and dig out some mitts for him to wear at night so he couldn’t scratch in his sleep.
Tony leaned in and breathed against Steve’s lips, “I’ve never been so happy either.” He closed the space between them and kissed Steve, sucking on his bottom lip to draw it into his mouth. Steve’s hands spun his waist and began to lift his shirt but a giggle came from the doorway causing the two to break apart.
"There are other lands to conquer you know." Tony said laying down on his front and began to walk his fingers down his own chest and navel, "There is the arid planes with its single mountain in the centre that has yet to be explored, the twin islands that beckon to many travellers," He ran his hands over his breasts suggestively, "But perhaps you prefer to explore the dark caverns between the high mountain slopes." he slipped his hand between his thighs and wiggled his eyebrows at Steve.
“Wha…. The hell man?” Sam sputtered.
Peter was more serious and had been taken to theatre to be stitched up, his breast bone needing to be set and multiple stitches both internal and external were used to stitch him up from the vivisection.
“Jarvis can’t get through, the explosion must have shorted out Tony and Steve’s Com.” At least that was what Rhodey was telling himself, refusing to believe that it was anything other than a malfunction of tech. He wouldn’t believe it was anything else, not until he was confronted with a body.
All around him was ruin and death. Buildings collapsed into piles of rubble with twisted shards of metal sticking up out of the brick like plants stretching up out of the dirt. There were no plants now, they were all burned, every tree, every flower, every blade of grass destroyed.
“I don’t know, I think you’re pretty great myself.” Tony jumped as Steve said this, the Captain strolling into the kitchen and wrapping his arms about Tony’s waist, kissing his neck, “Bringing me breakfast in bed, hmm?”
Rhodey glanced at the suit then back at Tony a smile spreading over his face, “Goddamn man, you’re crazy and I love you, and I don’t know what to say.”
Steve closed his eyes and grit his teeth. Fury. The bastards had murdered Fury.
It was painful to see the shimmer of disbelief in Tony’s eyes as he gazed at him, utterly astonished by these words. Steve almost moved to take him into his arms, but Lily let out a cry and wriggled in the pram, she would want feeding soon, and a nappy change soon there after.
Peter fidgeted, “What changed?” He asked.
Steve felt his heart stop as he watched Tony’s Malibu mansion plunge into the ocean after the missiles had hit.
Pepper rose a plucked eyebrow at him, “It’s karma.” She replied serenely and took Zach while Coulson explained the situation to Tony and made sure he loaded up the flash drive and began to look through the information he’d been given.
“I could,” Natasha agreed, “But it is far more amusing to watch you idiots struggling.”
Steve, who had been shaking hands with Sam, beamed with pride, “Yeah, I’m his Daddy.” It was only thanks to the serum that he didn’t double over as Clint slapped him on the back.
Peter, who’s hands were resting on Clint’s shoulders slowly fell away to hang limp at his side. He glared at Clint, worrying at his bottom lip before he sniffed hard and spoke. “You’re stupid.”
“So now you’ve proven you can do this you are good to go, right?”
“Wherever you left them.” Tony called back.
Everything was burning. The sky, the air, the whole world was in ashes.
“Of course.” Tony muttered with a sneer, “The murder of Captain America and Iron Man will make people panic, they’ll welcome some powerful Anti-bad guy device, thinking that it’ll save lives, not realizing that they’ll be signing away their freedom to the people that murdered us.”
“That is so much better than Iron Patriot.”
“I think that’s enough, kid.” Clint said, patting his shoulder, he looked sadly at Natasha, “I thought you were better than this.” Natasha met his eyes silently pleading with him to save her, but Clint shook his head, “You made your bed, Nat. It didn’t have to be this way. But you chose to follow Rogers and cover up murder, now you have to pay the price.”
“It’s good to have dreams. I had a dream once, no, wait… I actually did wake up in a hot tub wearing a thong with Gwen Paltrow next to me.”
“Hydra.” The Skrull panted, “The found they had an even greater prize when they took Stark, one they did not expect, it doubled the bounty.”
“I’m sorry about the lizard.” Peter apologised.
He was put to bed in his new Captain America pyjamas with the Tardis rolled into his bedroom; and a huge smile on his face as he fell asleep dreaming of all the adventures he’d be having in his Tardis.
It wasn’t a name that Steve had been expecting but he couldn’t say that he disliked it either, “That works for both a boy and a girl.” He said consideringly.
*****
Tony wasn’t in the armour, instead he had on bracelets which could call the suit to him if needed and was wearing a bullet proof vest and carrying a side arm and a knife for extra protection.
Rogers stand offish, and condescending attitude towards him, had not helped matter either.
Tony opened his mouth to ask what Steve meant but before he could, Steve brought the shield down onto the thighs, the edge of the metal slicing through the flesh of his thighs, cutting down and hitting the bone beneath.
Steve gaped at Vision, “She, I have a she, I mean a her, I mean a girl, I have a girl, a daughter?”
Still, Tony resolved to talk to Steve about his heat, catching the Alpha as he headed to the kitchen for breakfast after his usual morning run and drew him to one side so they could speak in private.
Peter groaned, fuck his life. Just fuck his whole life!
Steve sighed. Apparently, this worlds Wade Wilson was very similar to how his own had been. Bracing himself for what would be an exasperating conversation, filled with sexual inuendo and inappropriate comments, Steve moved to open the window and let Deadpool inside, deciding not to ask how the maniac had gotten up there since it would no doubt be ridiculous.
Thor’s Mother.
“You are the peak of physical perfection, strong, healthy, handsome, virial. Where I’m reliant on this.” He tapped the reactor in his chest, “Am covered in scars, I have stretch marks, extra weight on my hips and lower belly. I don’t sleep for days because I get lost in work, and I get nightmares, and I freak out, I’m sarcastic, short tempered, and have no idea what a healthy romantic relationship is because I’ve never had one.”
“I don’t care, so long as all he’s doing is looking,” He lowered his voice, “But I’m the only one whose going to be doing the touching.” The low timber of his voice and the sultry lowering of his dark lashes had the unfortunate effect of going straight to Steve’s groin, which in a pair of tight cut suit pants was not very comfortable.
“I’m here, I’m fine.” Steve said, relieved he could lift himself a little off Tony so he wasn’t crushing him anymore. He made a mental note to talk to Tony about Howard again in the future, he wanted to know what Howard had done, what he’d been like to Tony as a child, whether he’d had any idea of what Stane was like, Steve prayed that Howard had been ignorant of what a monster Stane really was.
“Robbie, language!” The poor woman said, her cheeks flushing slightly, “Honestly he is Iron Man mad, I can hardly get him out of that costume long enough to wash it!”
While Rhodey, with the War Machine armour now arrived and at his disposal, and Vision, took charge of escorting Rogers, Natasha, and Wanda to prison and keeping them under guard until an extradition team came to take them back to America, (And brought a power dampening collar for Rogers), the others went back to the hotel.
“Maximum effort!” Deadpool yelled leaping onto Cull’s back and stabbing him in the neck, “This reminds me of fighting Juganaught. Did I ever tell you about that?” He asked Bucky as the Super soldier beat off a couple of stray Chitauri, “We beat him by shoving an electric cable up his ass and the irony is I was fighting along side a guy called Cable!” He yelped as he was grabbed by the ankle and tossed into the side of the compound shattering the wall as he went,
"I'll take you to him shortly." The nurse said in a kind tone, "If you'll come with me I'll find you somewhere more private to wait." Steve gripped Tony's hand and glanced at the teacher, she gave him a small smile.
“Sleep baby,” Steve purred, rubbing his face into Tony’s hair, “Talk later,”
“You’re not getting cold feet are you?” Pepper quietly asked him as he looked through a row of collarless silk shirts.
“Are we inviting Natasha and Clint to join us?” Bruce asked, “Or telling Shield at all?”
Darnel pointed to where the worst of the destruction was, the epicentre of the blast where floor burned on top of the rubble and none of the building was left standing.
“Fine by me.” Tony agreed, he glanced at Natasha, “If you promise to keep your claws to yourself you can come too.”
Picking out his wedding outfit was supposed to be fun.
I know some people might not like my solution for dealing with Hammer. But after what he's just gone through with Vanko, I couldn't see Tony wanting a potential threat hanging around when he's got kids to think about.
“Stop right there!”
Rhodey’s eyes lit up, “Like Afghanistan.” He whispered, remembering the explosion that had drawn them to the area where they’d found Tony, alive after three months.
“Mamma, if you marry Steef will him be my Daddy?” he asked Tony, his heavy lidded eyes gazing up at the Billionaire Omega as Tony tucked him into bed.

‘Steve is edible and Tony looks so snug in his arms, I am jealous!’ Another said,
“Dada!” Morgan squealed,
“Now, drink your tea before it gets cold.” Bruce said, “And tonight, you can help me make a korma from scratch.”
No, this was wrong, completely wrong. His heat had only been a month ago, even if he had conceived he couldn’t be this pregnant already. He whimpered as he felt more movement from within his body. He couldn’t believe this but couldn’t deny it either, he was carrying a baby, was close to delivering it if the size of his belly was anything to go by.
No doubt the spoilt Billionaire would have his lawyers and secretaries working tirelessly to paint them as the bad guys. That alternate reality him would be backing Tony up, making himself out to be a hero, when hadn’t he already proven he’d failed? He’d let his world burn while fleeing like a coward.
Weight gain.
“Wonder where I learned that from.” Peter said grinned widely.
“Really, isn’t that the same….” The Woman’s eyes widened, “You are…oh my God, of course you are.” Realisation dawned on her as she recognised Steve. “I’m sorry Captain, I should have realised sooner.”

“So, who knows about this?” He asked gesturing to his lower body,
“Yeah.”
He followed behind Tony trying and failing to keep from looking at the Omega’s ass. He knew Tony was being nice about him needing to get out and meet people his own age, but he didn’t want to, he was happy with Tony and the kids, he liked spending time with them, he didn’t want to go and meet some Beta Women or Omega, even if it might mean that one day he’d have his own Pups. He wasn’t even sure if he should have any considering the serum, it might have an effect on the Pups.
Peter expected to feel the pain of the impact against the wall and then the impact of hitting the floor, the first came but the second did not.
He shook his head and sank back in his chair, “How am I meant to speak to the world, to the media when I can barely speak to someone in the street?”
“Do you breathe fire like a dragon?”
Snorting in amusement Steve fished a couple of coins from his pocket, “Why don’t you two go and get some snacks while me and your Mother talk in private?”
“Thank God for small mercies, because you sure as hell ain’t mine!” Matt shot back at him, “And don’t call me Door Matt.”
Fortunately they were going into a hospital, face masks and surgical gowns were not something people paid attention to and both the surgical masks and gowns were already in stock in SI as they were used in some of the research departments.
“What did you make him see?” Steve had asked, his voice tight and sick feeling swirling in his stomach, bringing an unpleasant taste into his mouth, making his tongue feel bitter.
Steve took a shaky breath and watery eyes met Tony’s, looking painfully young and innocent, “I should have done better.” He whispered, “Tried harder,” His eyes flitted to Tony’s throat, “He could have killed you.”
Chuckling Steve got himself up and headed to use the other bathroom and then went to get breakfast ready.
“Well I think we can skip the preliminary details, Fury said getting down to business, “Hydra are onto us and have made the first move, a pretty successful one given that we’re all in hiding right now.”
“Thank you for agreeing to hear me out, I know that my proposal is extreme and I understand why you would be sceptical of its necessity as well as my being the one to control such a weapon.”
Use the camera crew for target practice. (Emphasis on this to Clint, Natasha, and Tony.)
Walking into the darkened room he saw Tony on the carpeted floor in the throes of an anxiety attack, and Rogers standing over him, with a trace of blood on his right hand. Tony’s blood.
Feeling dizzy and sick Peter reached onto the nightstand and grabbed his phone, logging in and calling the Tower.
“Yeah, she’s a huge fan of CSI and Law and Order.” Peter said shrugging, “The Principal’s lucky she didn’t call in Crime Scene investigators and lawyers.”
