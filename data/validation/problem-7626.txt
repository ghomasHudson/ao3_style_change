It’s cosmically cyclical, the fight over Tony’s future in baseball starting the chain reaction of Bucky and Natasha’s relationship which eventually led to this moment, their wedding, landing the two of them in a parallel conversation. The only difference is that this time Steve isn’t going to let it end as horribly as it did before.
"—and people are not a fan of his. We've had plenty of cocky, controversial players play in the minor leagues, y'know, kids too big for their britches, but never one that has been this outwardly disrespectful to the sport."
Howard winks again and give Peggy a kiss on each cheek before squeezing through the crowd to get back to the bar, empty glass raised like a torch guiding his way. Steve stands awkwardly with Peggy for a moment, his eyes now trapped in the lingering foam on the bottom of his glass.
,” his coach barks, giving him a shove back towards the bases. “Let the doctors handle Barnes!” he jogs to catch up with Bucky and the medics, putting a hand on the player’s back as they disappear into the stadium.
"Night, Rogers," Tony gives a lazy wave, slipping into his room.
" The reporter is looking Tony in the eye again. "Do you have anything to add onto that and perhaps clarify to the side of the baseball audience that isn't on board with your 'scientific' approach to the game?"
“Probably,” Tony agrees, his eyes shining as he stares down at the floor. His expression sobers, lifting his chin to look at Steve. “I know you may not want me on the team, especially after what I did, but I came back to try and fix things. I’ll still try and do that, even if we’re not playing ball together but… I don’t know,” he gets a funny smile on his face, making Steve feel like he’s part of some in-joke. “It feels right for us to be on the same team again.”
Steve pushes the door with his hand, hearing the chain click as it strains to keep the door shut. "I know she's in here, Tony, you don't have to pretend."
Steve appreciates the lengths Peggy goesto to get to know all the players. Ever since he started and felt like the manager didn't even look at him twice in the first few months of him being on the team, everyone else had nothing but good things to say about her. The Majors are just so different than the teams Steve has played for in the past. His relationships with previous managers and owners had felt so much more personal when the teams were smaller and the stakes were lower. It’s just something to sacrifice, he supposes. The Stars are still like a tight-knit family, and Steve is grateful to be a part of it. Getting sold off to another team against his will is the
“Alright, no more alcohol for you. Someone get this brat some water!” Natasha calls out, leaving her arm around Tony’s neck in a loose headlock.
The room isn’t designed just to be a reliquary for others’ accomplishments. There are display cases around the room as well, Stark-designed bats, gloves, helmets, and other gear that had been birthed from the man standing behind him. It’s a chantry for baseball, a sanctuary so carefully laid out that Steve is at a loss for words.
SportsCenter is normally playing on the big, boxy televisions in the gym, and it isn’t really something Steve tends to focus on until he sees a picture of Howard Stark show up on the screen before switching to a picture of a younger man who bears a striking resemblance to the business mogul. He must be the son that Howard and Peggy were talking about four years ago. It’s a striking photo, a black and white portrait of a youthful boy made out to look like a man. He can’t be more than eighteen, but has the smooth cheekbones and sharp jawline of his father. His long lashes cast shadows over dark eyes, an intimidating gaze paired with a coy, crooked grin. Tony has the expression of a man who’s just won a table of bet chips on a bullshit hand.
Tony. He has to go to Tony.
“How have you not found it yet? There’s only, like, a dozen channels.”
Seconds later, Tony’s door opens. His gaze lazily drifts over, wondering if he’s still dreaming when he sees Steve standing in the doorway, looking ghastly and downtrodden. There are dark circles under his eyes and day-old stubble shadowing his normally clean-shaven face, his shirt collar wrinkled and hair limply swept to the side. He’s holding a steaming coffee in his hand, wiping a hand down his face as he trudges over to Tony’s bedside. About four steps in, he seems to finally realize that Tony is not only awake, but is sitting up and staring back at him.
They drive to the other towns along the Outer Cape, Tony giving Steve a tour of his old stomping grounds. The area isn’t quite as popular outside of the Summer months, and they’ve come before the Thanksgiving rush of families who come back to their holiday homes. He has multiple seafood restaurants in Provincetown he happily takes Steve to, and after dinner they walk down the street, hand-in-hand.
“I think,” Tony takes a sip of the Bloody Mary. “I think a morning run sounds good right about now.”
"Oh, we freaking deserve the fuck out of it," Tony laughs, reaching for the salami that Steve has just opened. "I am in full support of that decision." He rolls the deli meat and pops it into his mouth. "Stay-cation?"
Grumbling, Tony lets Steve stand him up. "Fuck," he moans once on his feet, "that hurts." Lightly, he rubs a hand over his ribcage, frowning at the pain. "One of these days, my body is going to hand in its two-week notice."
Tony doesn’t mind the passage of time, when the day of the competition comes around, he'll simply forget all about it. Steve barges into the cafeteria and grabs Tony by the collar, and pushes him to the wall. Tony hears the collective gasps from the other students, yet his eyes are fixed on Steve's. They are glassy, red, and heartbroken.
His eyes grew wide.
Everything's alright.
Four years after…
When he gets a bruise on his eye due to a fight,
Tony  tries to give a small smile and a wave back, only to realize that the other guy is waving towards Natasha, who is behind him. Tony feels his cheeks heat up.
Now it was Tony’s turn to be shocked. “I’m… I’m sorry to hear that, Steve,” he says quietly. “Does Bucky know?”
If Steve had been more perceptive, he would have noticed how Bucky had stiffened up at the sight of Tony Stark. Instead, Steve answers Bucky's inquiry, and Bucky leaves the apartment.
"Captain Rogers, the bullet graze on the left side of your abdomen is not too deep but should be cleaned as it is healing slower than expected. I recommend ice and elevating your right ankle. Other than that, you have several bruises and cuts that are already healing. A shower should suffice to clean them."
“Stop being a baby and just sit still,” she chastises in annoyance, gently grabbing the uninjured side of his face again to angle him back towards her. “It’s almost clean, then we can bandage it.”
He’s in Steve’s bed. Tony sits up suddenly, staring at the lump under the covers next to him. Steve is on his side, facing away from him, seemingly unbothered by the fact that Tony had passed out next to him.
Tony shrugs. “You know me. I don’t want to stay tied down. That way when I start hating baseball again I can just quit and not have to worry about anything else.”
Tony sleeps through the second leg of their trip in preparation for the night ahead. After a bit of initial grogginess as they all file off the plane passes, Tony’s feeling awake and raring to go as they exit the airport. Media hounds are lined up outside, paparazzi with cameras and reporters with microphones trying to shove their way forward. Most if not all of the All-Star players are passing through this airport today, and every sports outlet is hoping to get any kind of quote from the players.
look pretty freaked."
Howard takes a deep breath before replying. “Well, if anyone could shape up that problem child, it’s you,” The man smiles, but it looks forced.
engineering, huh? That’s pretty impressive. I’ve got some pull at MIT, you know.”
Steve bumps his shoulder against Bucky's as he heads for the door. "I'll see you at Kurtz’s."
There’s a beat of silence after the accusation before Tony shoves at Steve’s chest with all the strength he has, Steve simultaneously releasing him and stepping back. Tony stumbles away from him, catching himself on the kitchen counter. For a moment, the only sound in the apartment is Tony’s labored breaths.
they win today.
Tony smiles tersely. “You’re not my type, sorry.”
They do their best to keep their vocalizations quiet, but there’s little to be done about the sound of the headboard repeatedly smacking into the wall and the frame creaking beneath them as they finally get out all the pent-up sexual energy that’s been saved up for several weeks now.
Tony blows his whistle, letting it dangle around his neck. “Alright, get your stretches in now because we’re starting with a scrimmage in fifteen. Once you’re done split up into Vets versus Newbies.”
"No, I don't think any of this would've been possible without everything Isaiah had given the team for the past twenty-two years," Dugan answers. “Everything I've done this season I have to thank him for. We're all doing it for him, right boys?"
, and if Tony hadn’t looked back to the catcher to see his gaze focused on Tony, even from a distance. Almost imperceptibly, the pitcher glanced back over his shoulder as well. So they had a signal for steals. Tony would have to cut that shit right now. He’s had just about enough of being in the golden boy’s personal bubble at this point.
Steve considers himself a very open-minded individual and a fairly good judge of character. He refuses to make assumptions off Tony’s character only based on commentary from others, even if he did get a slight glimpse into Tony’s attitude earlier that day. That was a singular news clip that could’ve easily been taken out of context and wasn’t an immobile testament to Tony’s personality. The optimist in Steve wants to believe the interview had been some fluke and maybe the Stark kid was having an off day or has just been painted in a rough light.
The first time Tony laid his eyes on Steve, he was completely blown away. Even if Steve’s cubicle was a couple of meters away from Tony’s, he was unavoidable. When he would get hot water from the pantry, Steve’s presence was everywhere, or when he microwaved his home-cooked meal, or when he goes to the photocopy room. Heck! Even at home. How can he not fall for this man?
"Look at that!" Tony whines, exasperated, throwing his head back like an angry teenager, "You went and got us in trouble with
"I wish I could share your world view Nat. But, I am not like you, in love with someone like Pepper. So, nothing seems magical to me now." He answers.
Steve is talking to him, but Tony can't hear the words, all he can think of is that their performance is a disaster waiting to happen. This is how cramming feels like, like being so unprepared for an exam that his mind is going to go blank. At this rate, he can only manage a half-assed performance, which is not on par with his standards.
Clint's eyes say
"Nothing about either of you is straight, but that's beside the point."
Tony looks up at the dark sky filled with red and yellow hues, feeling the anticipation as the people around them begin to scream the count down.
Upon his father's death, his mother started working overtime to make ends meet. She checks on him, but he cann't share the emptiness he feels. Sometimes, it’s hard to share feelings; his father’s memory has cast his dark shadow over both Tony  and his mom. He figures she feels the same way, and he decides that he won't open up to her because he doesn't want to burden her.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony says. “You’re like a lost puppy.”
"My parents died a year after my graduation, a car crash they say," Tony begins his tale. Steve remembers it was all over the news, and Tony continues, "I am not sure if you have heard of that, but that launched me to be the head of SI."
His mind chants.
"I've always loved you, Steve," Tony confesses."I never saw you as someone who'll I'd be content to just stay friends with, I always thought when the right time would come to tell you, but unfortunately, there was no such thing as
They go to Times Square a little bit before midnight. The festivities are all around the place: the music, the fireworks, the confetti, the people. The weather forecast said it wasn’t supposed to snow tonight, yet small flakes and flurries had fallen softly from the sky. Tony was glad that it wasn’t windy. Temperatures may drop to negative degrees, and he’ll still be warm with the absence of wind chill.
Links are also provided at the end notes.
Tony can't help but feel warmth bloom in his chest, at that moment, Steve is indeed…
He and Nat soon part ways. They have been neighbors for so long and have known each other since they were children. He finds it funny that the window of his music room is just opposite of Nat’s room. And he knows how much Nat loves hearing him play the piano. Sometimes, when he knows Nat is in a bad mood he would start playing
Contestant number 12 is called on stage. Tony can feel his heart thumping wildly inside his chest. He looks at the sheet music on his lap, his hands playing an invisible piano. He can feel the muscles in his neck tense up from always hanging his head low.
Thanks to Diana for Beta-ing this chapter. We are working under time pressure. Today is last day of posting. And it's fun working under pressure.
Tony glances at the grand piano at the center of his study room. The poor neglected thing has collected dust and become a study table covered with books. Pathetic.
"Do you know who did this?" Steve asked, genuinely concerned that he would want to help his new lover. He tries to soothe Tony by rubbing a hand over Tony’s arm. "How can I help you?"
"How about you, Tony?" Nat nudges him, "Any special girl or boy?"
Steve notices that his son is afraid of thunderstorms. Tony explains the reason why.
"I hate that I know what that is, but yes." Grabbing a few slices of honey baked ham, Steve shoves them into his mouth, groaning at how good it is. "Jeez, I'm starving!"
causing Tony to laugh even more. One thing he likes about Steve is that he could play along well with his fantasies. They are a perfect fit—he and him.
"I know it's Tony Stark," Bucky says. "You have always told me about him,"
Whenever people would look at the armor, they would fantasize about the glorious battles it has witnessed. But if only the armor could speak, it would tell you how Antonius wept as he reinforced the armor's security features because he was afraid that Stephanos might die as he faced off the so-called "Mad Titan" gladiator known as Thanos.
Tony really liked Steve, yet, it seemed that Steve didn’t like him the way he wants Steve to like him. When he sleeps at his side at night, he would imagine Steve’s body pressed to his body, encaging him in a warm embrace. And when Tony gets the urges, he would imagine himself being pinned down by Steve’s muscular body. He could imagine Steve’s weight, his deep voice, his light, gentle touches...
It's as he's carefully placing Tony on their bed that Tony wakes, blinking his eyes open and looking around confused before he realizes where he is. "Tell me," he begins sleepily, "that I didn't have to be carried to bed like a toddler after a road trip."
No place is safe for Anthony Edward Stark.
Yet...
Steve nods at him. “It was mutual, so don’t stress about it.”
He looks at the not-so-busy streets; usually, the streets are alive during rush hour, so different from the empty ghostly streets he is witnessing.
It's been over a year since he heard the news that said that Tony Stark, the CEO of Stark Industries, was found dead in a hotel in San Juan. The alleged suicide caused Steve to shed a few tears --His fondest memories were being Tony's friend before the country had succumbed to another debilitating pandemic, thus creating another wave of economic recession. Until now, he regrets not declaring his love for his friend when he had the chance.
"I'm sure none of it that great," Tony says as he tries to shrug off the conversation about him. "So- what's the plan this afternoon?"
He felt Natasha gently grab his hand, drawing his attention towards her. She gives him a sympathetic smile. "I'm sure you will regain your passion for music again. I just know it Tony." she pauses then gives him a sly smile. "This reminds me..."
He trudges along the city's polluted paths, his hands inside the pockets of his worn-out weather-resistant jacket. It's been a while since Steve had shaved his facial hair, let alone cut his hair, so he figures that he'll give himself a lovely trip to the barbershop tomorrow.
"Alright." He agrees with a defeated sigh.
Another pause. The matcha smoothie is excellent Tony thinks.
"Jeez, Nat, I'm just helping you -"
He stares at his phone, the name Steve Rogers looking back up at him before it’s replaced with Natasha's picture as she calls him.
"You… you were really amazing back there," Tony begins, unsure of what to say. "It's like the music came to you effortlessly."
And sometimes, Tony would be annoyed by all of those questions.
Have you slept well?
There are guards everywhere in the Stark Tower.
“Then, why?” Tony could feel his excitement stirring. “I thought you weren’t into men?”
interested in them. All at the same time? Really? He watches Bucky answer one phone call after another before he waves goodbye at them and goes off to god-knows-where, leaving Nat and Tony alone.
He's lucky, he knows, to have found another team that's so close and family-like. The Howling Commandos were a once in a lifetime group; their camaraderie and friendship only amplified their ability to read each other in battle, and it aided in helping to relax and unwind after. That Steve had not only found that level of companionship, trust, and loyalty in another team amazes him every single day. And to have found love within that team?
It’s only 4:30 pm, yet the sun has completely set. Tony finished doing his laundry, and Steve hasn’t returned from his shopping. Tonight is New Year’s eve; maybe he should invite Steve to Times Square later and do a count down with him. At least, if he doesn’t get the courage to confess, then maybe being together with Steve under the bright lights, festivities, music, and fireworks would start his year right.
Tony sighs in relief on his chair. “You scared me!”
He looks up once more at the dark landing pad. Tony used to light the runway when he came home.
Now Tony (or his ghost) is in his arms.
Tony smiles.
"He's just tired, Captain. As you all are."
The snap has affected everyone, and even Steve's friends have now dissolved into dust. And Tony, was he dusted too?
Tony gives him a look, he feels unsure about the idea.
Beautiful.
He looks up at one of his favorite buildings in Manhattan. The Stark Tower doesn't look as festive as it was once. In Steve's mind, he tries to capture the moments when the Stark tower used to be his home, where Tony would wait for him to come home.
his mind screams!
"Nope," Tony says, avoiding Steve's gaze. "Haven't played a single concert piece since I was 12."
“I didn’t know you loved the Andrews sisters, and your playlist is impressive, Steve,” Tony says as they settle in and eat their New Year’s dinner. The apartment lights around them gave a romantic hue, in Tony’s eyes that is.
Steve waves at them, and Tony feels his heart flutter.
“A triple chocolate one, just the way you like it,” Steve beams. And Tony just felt weak in his knees because Steve’s teeth were so perfectly aligned.
"Who is quitting?"
Is anything bothering you?
How's your day?
"'Night, Tash."
Tony is silent.
Kudos and Comments are appreciated.
Everyone wanted him gone.
The young lad with blue eyes bows at the end of his performance, and his young audience claps. (Which he accepts with grace). He looks up, and his eyes meet Tony's.
on Sam, and they are now going a year strong. Why can’t he do it with Bucky’s woodblock best friend named Steve Rogers?
but he is on his own. Tony is stirring, his breath coming short as he struggles to shift in Steve's arms without making his yet unknown injuries even worse. With a final glance towards his awake team members, Steve sends them a look he hopes exudes something along the lines of—
When he needed something to comfort him,
Tony avoids his gaze. "It's just like typing on your laptop's keyboard, it's only soundless tapping, which makes no sense."
“Hi, Steve!” he gives a grin and points to the bed. “Your sweater, its… its washed!”
He would only stare into Steve's sleeping face at night.
"Me too," Steve says. "So, what are your plans for today?"
“It’s ok Tony, I am happy to share with you,” Steve smiles at him. “It was summer this year when Sharon and I went to Florida for a summer get-away when I realized we are not going to work out,”
Tony sighs as he looks out only to see sheet music on Nat's window.
. But music isn't all about precision, it's about the joy and beauty that comes with it.
"So, I've heard a lot about you… actually." Steve tucks a strand of blonde hair behind his ear. He talks slowly as if he's choosing his words correctly. "And, I know that you always placed first in competitions, is it alright if I asked… why? Why have you stopped playing?"
"OH GOOD LORD, IS SOMEBODY HURT?" Natasha's voice echoed in the dark music room as she appeared.
Tony didn't notice that Steve was talking to him. The image of Steve with his violin flashes through his head.
Made in Rome circa 70 BC, with materials of bronze, wood, and leather, carefully constructed to withstand attacks from the opponent. The armor was worn by the famous gladiator Stephanos and forged by a master blacksmith Antonius.
Ever since Steve learned that he was such a Cap fan, he would always leave Cap fanarts for Tony in his post-it notes. What Steve doesn’t know is that Tony collects his post-its and compiles them in his red moleskin journal.
"You were out like a light," Steve consoles, gently removing Tony's sneakers. The movement aggravates the grazed wound, and he's barely able to conceal a wince. Tony notices anyway.
And then, there’s his roommate, Steve Rogers.
No, maybe I could sleep in your room?
but it comes across more weary than stern. He promises himself he'll check on everyone in a bit.

Link to the musical piece stated here:
But no, Steve is different from Captain America.
He can hear the audience's roar like they are at a concert. Somewhere, perhaps, Natasha and Bucky are wildly cheering for them. But right now, all he can see is Steve's beautiful form soaking in the stage's golden light.
"As you may have known, I busied myself creating weapons that benefited our country in a war with the
He remembers the way Steve pulls him by the hand enthusiastically to the stage.
"That sounds like a good idea," JARVIS says, "consider it done."
Day 1: Safety
"He’s  quitting." He tells Tony.
“I don’t know,” Steve says, looking down into his dinner then looking at Tony. “Perhaps our love just run its course and… it’s over.”
Tony expects Steve to laugh and brush off what he’s said, but Steve just looks at him somewhat sympathetically. There is a softness in his gaze. "It's not that you can hear it, but…" his hand gently touches Tony's. "But, something is blocking it."
"Nat!"
Tony can't pinpoint precisely the reason Steve's playing sounds different, but he is sure that Steve looks carefree and is in control of the musical piece. He can imagine the judges shaking in their seats as they evaluate Steve's performance. No doubt, they want to deduct points for not following the piece technically and adapting it to make it his own.
"Oh, Steve, this is my other friend, Tony." Nat says.
That's the end of my small Steve Y4: Health Problems and Disabilities square for POTS server's Smol Steve appreciation Bingo 2020. Hope you had fun reading this adaptation.
Tony smiles at the fond memory "Rhodey and Nat hated it-"
"Four years." Tony corrected.
It's been a while since Tony has been able to eat outside since he spends most of his days in the music room. He watches Steve in amusement as he orders two cakes and a smoothie. Tony orders the same cake but gets one cake less. Steve is right when he says their cheesecakes are to die for.

Thank you for all the love, comments and kudos. I really appreciate them. (Even if AO3 is not sending me any emails at the moment. huhu) <3
"S-S-tee-ve?" Tony lets out a mumble, almost fainting into Steve's arms. Steve tries to nudge him back to consciousness, calling out for his name, yet Tony could only manage short answers.
The weekend comes, and Tony finds himself walking towards the meeting place. He hates the familiar path he  walks. It reminds him of the times his father would drive him to the concert hall, and how usually the whole affair was a serious one.
A pause.
"Uhmm that's just a part-time job that I'm doing, you know transcribing pop songs into sheet music so that karaokes can use them."
Except for Steve.
Sure. You're always welcome, Tony.
He hears Steve murmur a mantra, then he looks at him and gives him his cue. Tony nods. He cannot screw this performance up. The performance begins, and Tony tries to take it slow. So far, so good. He can hear the notes as his fingers dance upon the piano keys.
"I thought you said, 'Don't push it?'" Clint quips, and it's a testament to Steve's current level of mental enervation that he doesn't see the bad joke he has walked right into.
"Tony," Natasha squeezes his hand. "Are you alright?"
Tony looks into Steve's eyes,
Have you slept well?
Tony vents out on Rhodey, Steve cries on Bucky's shoulder
(You should listen to these Chopin pieces)
Everyone wants a piece of him.
"Just finishing my mission report, Steve. I'm headed to bed as soon as I'm done."
The lovers parted with a kiss that afternoon after the two had exchanged numbers.
She must have been frightened! You have to help me, Steve," he cries more, "And the murderer has to pay for his crime."
"Fine! Four years of not playing, hey this might be a good opportunity."
"But I don't," Steve says. "You have always been special to me Tony, I didn't know what love was that time, I might have been too young and naive to have known, but you taught my heart its true meaning,"
"I only have coffee and bread," Steve tells him. The coffee Steve offers is a 3-1 coffee mix that is more sugar than coffee. Steve boils water in an electric kettle, he peruses his cupboard for more to eat, a couple of instant noodles and eggs, he hopes its enough to bring some nourishment back into Tony.
It has always been like this, the three of them: Bucky, Nat, and him. They have been friends ever since he could remember. Both of them are into sports, Bucky, the all-popular jock whose fame extends to other girls and guys in and out of school. He has around 1k followers, across Tiktok, IG, and Twitter, where he mostly shares his life (soccer). Nat, on the other hand, is currently preoccupied with catching her senior's attention: Pepper. It's all Tony hears from her these days.
Steve looks at him and gives him a smile. "Thank you."
"I've always thought of you," Steve tells him, finally pouring his heart out. "I always wondered what you were doing, if you were out there creating the technology of your dreams, like the way you bragged about in college,"
Everyone wanted him gone.
. At that moment, he feels a little sorry for Steve. He must be hoping for some time out with Tony’s popular best friend.
Steve grins, "Doctor Romanov said no hanky panky."
At the response of two bleary no's, and a snort from passed out Thor, Steve nods. "Okay, get some rest, get the medical attention you need, and don't push it. I'm taking Tony to bed."
“Steve,” Tony points out after a couple of bites of food. “Your playlist…” Tony remembers the title of the track titles such as
“Ahhh… Sharon found a new job in L.A.,” Steve says. “She feels she isn’t growing here in New York,”
On their way home, Steve's phone makes  a pinging sound. Whatever they are chatting about comes to a halt as Steve pulls out his phone. Steve's brows furrow when he sees the message.
Tony  hears the collective gasps from the audience. The lively and unique performance Steve is giving has stirred the sleeping audience. Tony glances to the side and sees Bucky on the edge of his seat, clearly smitten with Steve's playing.
The museum's curator would spit out facts about this beautifully handcrafted suit:
“I’m sorry,” Steve says in a hushed tone. “I was just surprised, is all.”
As he sits there, he listens to Natasha, recount the days when she used to attend  his piano contests and recitals. Those were the days she looked forward to, Tony hears her say, and this afternoon feels so nostalgic. Bucky, on the other hand, is busy looking at the pamphlet guide of the violin competition.
"I know… but--"
"I…" he began, shifting his eyes to find the answer, and he catches a glimpse of Steve's gloved hand shaking. "I've never seen someone receive flowers…?"
The scenery around him changes: a meadow full of blooming flowers.

"Honestly?" she rolls her eyes. "Pepper told me something: she says that when you fall in love, the world becomes… colorful. Things that you don't usually seem to notice now sparkle and the world is more... saturated."

This feels all so different, so strange from the teachings of his father. This guy, whose name is Steve, is like a roller coaster, and going on a musical journey with him feels exciting.
If only the armor could speak... it'll tell you of the tale of how it was born. The armor would say to you that it was painstakingly created by Antonius, the son of a wealthy inventor at that time. Antonius, the armor would say, made the best armor ever worn by a gladiator at that time. And it (the armor) is dedicated to a young attractive Stephanos, a slave who became a gladiator to fight for his freedom.
And sleep. You can't forget sleep.
"The horror!"
The year is 2018, and Steve saw different lights littered across the dark cityscape. Brooklyn looked so different when the night is even more bustling than the day.
He is Iron Man, the superhero who saves the world.
I know it ends in a bit of a cliff hanger: our two protagonists, mutually pining for each other, yet neither of them know it. I would want to explore this AU in the future maybe? Create a series around it? God, this is amazing, I wanted to write them all pining after Tony. He such an amazing bicycle.
"Steve!"
The meaning of the look isn't lost on Natasha, at least, and she claps Clint on the back. "I'll make sure everyone does as they're supposed to and acts like the actual adults they are."
Steve Rogers, Tony automatically smiles when he thinks of his name. Steve Rogers, who lent him a Captain America sweater for their office Christmas party just because Tony claimed he never owned an “ugly sweater” before.
He scoffs.
"Are you hungry?" Steve asks as he pulls on his pajama pants. "There's not much here, but I can grab some grapes and the cold cuts and a few bottles of water from the common area."
"I believe you." Leaning down, Steve presses a kiss to Tony's forehead. "Go ahead and start the movie; I'll get our feast ready."
“Wouldn’t work…” Steve says.
"I just took some; you can ask JARVIS if you don't believe me."
“I would hug you right now if I’m not busy eating my food at the moment,” he says lightheartedly at the blond guy. “What’s the reason?”
The afternoon progresses, and the two exchange  stories of how they got into music, or mostly Steve talks,  he tells Tony that he initially wanted to play the piano, but  chose the violin instead. Why? Tony can't recall some of the things Steve says as he’s stuck between his own introspection and listening to Steve’s reasoning for loving music.
And their lips meet.
etc. “Really have good songs… but why does your playlist have my name on it?”
"I was thinking that I would surprise Bucky by meeting him here, turns out he's unavailable."
"Today is my violin competition," Steve says as he points towards the concert hall. "I'm inviting you all to watch me," he gave Bucky a smile. "And hopefully leave  an impression on you guys."
“Can we please talk about it?” Steve asks softly.
He gets a warmer rush from that look on Steve’s face than the thirty-thousand he may or may not be taking home.
Tony glances back at him, a slow grin spreading. "Yeah, sailor?" He waggles his eyebrows.
Tony avoids her gaze and nods, accepting a kiss on his unscathed cheek. The door suddenly flies open right as Pepper touches the handle, a fuming Van Dyne's storming into the room, blowing right past her. Pepper just raises her eyebrows at Tony and draws a line across her neck, sticking her tongue out at him. He rolls his eyes and raises a fake finger gun to his head to blow his own brains out, getting a laugh out of his ex-manager before she slips out of the room and leaves him to his doom.
There’s a soft click behind him, Steve jerks out of his reverie to see the door closed behind him. He grips the handle and turns, the knob not budging an inch. “Natasha!” he calls, pounding his fist against the door as he jiggles the handle again in vain. “What are you doing?”
“Ah. Well, I guess there’s worse people to be snowed in with, right?”
“You’ll thank me later!” Ty laughs, shaking out the last droplets and tossing it in the recycling bin. “You can get trashed all you want afterwards, but you know you’re not allowed to drink before practice and games.”
Steve notices. Maybe Howard just means if Tony ever makes it into the Majors. He’s still young and early in his career, but clearly possesses the skill to be associated on the walls next to the rest of these players. Maybe it’s not so much whether or not Howard considers his son good enough, but
“Total blizzard last night. I know they were expecting a lot of snow, but not
were amazing out there today,” Tony counters. “Today. Every day. All the days. Isn’t she amazing guys!?” Tony grabs her chin, looking to the rest of the group for affirmation. Everyone is mostly just laughing at his antics, while Natasha tries to save Pepper from Tony’s grasps. He clings to her protectively, his coach eventually giving up.
The crowd shifts uncomfortably around them. While it’s clear most of them are already put off by Hammer’s blatant displays of his inferiority complex, many of the players are now turning uncertain stares towards Tony as well. Those kinds of accusations aren’t taken lightly in the current climate, even when coming from a raving asshole that can hardly stand.
Tony grins broadly, grabbing both from her. “Only for you, Doc. See you next week?” He yanks his shirt back on over his head and zips up his training jacket before hopping off the raised exam chair and hustling out the door, bumping his shoulder against Steve’s on the way out.
to change their minds. And what better way to do that then return to the league that scorned you and cast you out after using you to get to the top?” He’s playing a little dirty now, knowing the best ways to try and convince Tony to see his agenda by appealing to his dramatic side.
smirk. "Big fan, I assume. Want me to autograph your apron there?"
Their last conversation was more or less an argument. Carol was giving Tony a few days to unwind and adjust after leaving the rehab center, and even though he’d bought his plane ticket a few days prior, Tony called Steve in a panic trying to bow out.
“...Oh,” Tony says, hardly above a whisper. Something about the tightness in Steve’s voice feels so final, so resolute. He doesn’t want to talk about it. Don’t ask don’t tell, Tony supposes. Chest feeling heavy, he rolls back over himself, facing the wall yet again. He lets a few more minutes pass. “Steve?” He asks again.
Tony’s back his pressed against his front, his attention more often than not drifting away from the screen to instead focus on the soft looking skin on the nape of his neck, thinking about how badly he wants to kiss him there— how much he wants to let the arm wrapped around his waist drift lower so he can touch Tony the way he was touched last night…
Tony laughs and rolls his eyes. Steve can feel his blood boiling at this kid's attitude. He clearly has the attitude of a teenager who couldn't be bothered, which made sense as to why he has such a mouth on him. "Of course I am. It's what Starks do." He looks off camera then and nods to someone off screen before clapping the reporter on the back. "Feel free to quote me on that too," he says, pointing and winking at the camera before walking off.
He's stretching with Bruce, smiling and laughing at something Banner has said. It's good to see Tony smiling again, but his happy nature immediately disappears when he catches Steve out of the corner of his eye. Tony's face falls so quickly that Bruce turns to see what's set his friend off. He looks confused when he sees Steve, looking back at Tony who's now staring at the ground, mouth pressed in a tight line.
Tony just stares at him with a blank slate of hatred. "
Tony initiates the next kiss, running his hands through Steve’s short locks and pulling him down on top of him. The grip in his hair tugs his head back enough for Tony to mouth at his neck, Steve unable to hold back a groan at the sensation of Tony’s warm tongue against such a sensitive area. He can already feel himself getting turned on as Tony begins to suck and bite along his throat, blood rushing down south as the rest of his body begins to take interest. It’s an immediate reaction as he’s reminded of the sensations from last night, thinking of Tony’s talented mouth going to much more sensitive places.
Tony thinks.
Tony shrugs as he leans on the wall, trying to appear disinterested. "Well, he could have won if this was a violin recital, but it's not. The judges probably deducted multiple points from him."
“A bottle of chilled champagne already on the fridge sir, anything else?” Steve says in his
"Everyone okay? Anything pressing?"
7… 6… 5…
He tries to busy himself by killing time instead. Then he hears it.
He is part of SHIELD's elite team of unique people.
And so the destitute painter brings his friend home with him that night.
The living room is blessedly empty, and Steve takes a moment to crack open each door to make sure his teammates made it to their beds. In Bruce's room, he finds the scientist snoring lightly, and in Clint's room, Steve finds the bed vacant, but the large hanging egg chair has the archer curled up and wrapped in an obscene amount of blankets. Down the hall in Thor's room, the god is peacefully asleep, his arm around a body pillow and his hair splayed out. Only Natasha is awake, and he silently raises his eyebrows at her. She's sitting up on her bed, Starkpad against her raised knees.
“Kiss me,” he demands.
Have you eaten?
, he tells himself,
Because I want my passion for music to be heard. When I play on the stage, it's not for me, but for the audience, so if I give the most exciting performance, then I feel like I've accomplished my goal."
Steve yanks his necktie, and their foreheads bump into each other, causing them to let out agonized screams. Steve presses his gloved hand on his forehead while Tony thinks he might have died.
Coffee.
The links to the musical pieces in this chapter:
“Nah,” Steve says, “I would rather have someone closer,”
These were all things Howard used to say to Tony. Rumor is that his father was rigorous, and that poor Tony likely had bruises all over his arms. Tony would walk with his head hung low, during those times, and people sometimes treated him like an automated robot.
- This is Tony's piece in the piano competition.
"I think you would be the actual pain in
"You're really telling Fury to leave us be for two weeks?"
Tony, you have to take her requests seriously.
"Maybe he’ll  change Bucky's flirty nature? He was unsure at first, but I reassured him that I'd bring along my other friend so it won't be so awkward. That made him agree." Tony could already tell that this was turning into a bad idea, but Nat gestured that he hear her out first.
“I… was… when I was in college,” Steve explains, “Just so happened I never had a boyfriend because Sharon was there.”
Tony tries to force a smile. It is difficult to chase away the voices that scream
Tony still doesn't feel safe.
"Let's hope that's not going to happen anytime soon. Come on," Steve slips an arm around Tony's waist before he softly prompts him forward. "Let's  bathe and clean up. And actually-" looking up at the ceiling, Steve addresses JARVIS as Tony lays his head on Steve's arm and closes his eyes, "-do me a favor and tell Director Fury not to bug us for at least a week." Tony's body slumps just slightly as he begins to fall asleep on him, the brat. "You know what? Make it two. The Fantastic Four can get their butts moving and do something for once."
, while everyone is suffering from wave after wave of various pandemics. Instead of looking for a cure, they looked for someone to blame, and I was a fool for being so blind."
"Yup," Steve says looking at his wristwatch, "And we have to  hurry because the contest starts  in ten minutes."
He looks around Steve’s room, and the smell of Steve’s cool perfume hit him. He glances at Steve’s bedside table. Hmmm?
There are guards outside his mansion,
"JARVIS," narrowing his eyes at Steve, Tony grips the zipper and tugs it down, "scan Steve."
Moments later, the results of those who passed the preliminaries are posted. Tony had been sure that Steve wouldn't make it, but he did. And surprisingly won the "Audience Choice" title.
"Language!" Steve says sternly. "Look, you haven't played since you were 12, and that was three years…"
Tony gives him a half-smile then resumes eating. He wouldn’t admit it, but the atmosphere seemed to grow a bit more tense than earlier. He looks at Steve, but Steve seemed to ignore his glances. And it is starting to grate Tony’s nerves. “Alright Steve, tell me what’s going on,”
Thanks.
"Yes, ma'am!" The exchange does make them smile, and not for the first time Steve is overtaken with appreciation for this crazy family he stumbled into. They're almost too tired to function, but that doesn't mean they don't do their best to take care of each other. Sometimes, as the saying goes, laughter is the best medicine.
His Captain America mug was always there to provide him comfort,
"Steve..." Tony mutters weakly, "Is that you?"
over his shoulder and gratefully heads toward their room.
Is anything bothering you?
When Steve's name is announced, he sees Bucky suddenly paying attention, and Nat cheers from her seat. Steve walks on stage, dressed in his formal attire, a deep blue tux that matches his eyes. He wears black hand-wrist supports, which surprises Tony a bit. Overall, Steve holds his head high, the spotlight accentuates his beautiful features.
He watches Steve place the meals on the table. Neither of them were great cooks, so store-bought foods are the best at the moment. He would learn how to cook; yes, that’s in his New Year’s resolution.
Tony knows he is safe.
If only the armor could speak, it would tell you how Stephanos struggled to kill the mad titan and win his freedom later that day. Despite all the festivity that surrounded his victory, he chose to kneel in front of Antonius, as a free man, seeking Antonius' hand in marriage.
"Doctor Romanov is a killjoy."
Steve could remember the day he discovered that lights have different colors now, some are still golden, but lots are white, pink, green, and blue. It's incredible how things have progressed now that he is living in the future.
"Come here," Steve offers himself, opening his arms and spreading his legs for Tony to latch on a tight embrace. Tony does so and hugs Steve tightly, resting his head on Steve's chest. Steve savors the moment as if he could shield Tony from all the horrors of this world. Steve rocks Tony from side to side as if in a dance, he could feel the front of his shirt get wet as Tony sheds silent tears. Steve didn't dare comment on it, but hummed instead a familiar El Bimbo tune that brought them together from yesteryears.
in the concert hall his face was devoid of any expression.
How do you play a piece without feeling pressured?
Until
And yet...
Tony is home.
Sharon had come over to their shared flat twice, the first was after the new year of this year, and one was after her summer vacation with Steve to Florida. Tony could never deny that Steve and Sharon looked picturesque together. They were indeed the perfect couple. Time would tell when they would decide to tie the knot and then retreat to a suburb with a white picket fence, surrounded by their perfect blonde children. During the two times Sharon was there, he would always go over to Rhodey’s.
They're both in a fit of giggles as they polish off the cold cuts and the fruit and absolutely massacre Clint's cookies. And though their bodies still ache, it makes them happy to wrap their arms around each other and start to drift off to sleep, just as Milo is insulting Rex by calling him
, Steve thought. and when Bucky shows up in his doorway, Steve tries to hush him, indicating that he is with company.
“Tony?” Steve’s deep voice was heard from the doorway, and Tony felt his heart leap from his chest.
And even though he's only partially awake, Tony giggles, as he always does at that scene, and Steve thinks to himself that despite it all, he wouldn't change a single thing.
"Oh, so now you’re dragging me into your match-making sesh,  oh great."
“Why me?” Tony asks. Curious at why Steve would suddenly reveal the reason he was attracted to him. Isn’t this what he always wanted?
It feels wonderful to be clean, and once dry, both Steve and Tony sit cross-legged on the bed, facing each other and simultaneously applying Neosporin, bandaids, wraps, and ice to each other's naked bodies. Steve meticulously tapes the gash above Tony's eyebrow as Tony swipes some ointment on the graze and bandages it. Their movements are practiced and precise. Despite their exhaustion, they take no risks with the other's health.
"Wait? You play the violin? That's so awesome Steve!" Bucky exclaims.
One of his fondest college memories with Tony was when Tony taught him to dance the Boogie or Cha Cha, often using the El bimbo music. He always regretted not asking Tony for a dance when he had the opportunity to do so.
As the door closes behind them, Steve surveys the room. Bruce and Thor are both already asleep, Thor's head in Bruce's lap, and Clint, with an icepack tied around his head, is wrapping Thor's arm gently, mumbling about gods and how they
Pepper bothers me.
“Always Steve…” Nat sighs on the other line.
Tony takes a deep breath before summoning up his courage to pick up the call.
"Remember the times when we used to eat lunch by Nena's Canteen? You, Nat, Rhodey and I? I remembered how much you loved eating her sour and savory pork stew? You liked eating it with rice because you said it makes your stomach full. The food was only 7 bucks, yet you always insisted that you didn’t have enough money to buy the pork stew and then I ended up paying for it... and here we are with our situations reversed."
Steve smiles up at his best friend, bringing his arm up to wrap around Bucky’s waist. “’Til the end of the line.”
The woman laughs, shaking her head. "Don't let Howard hyperbolize me. I run a large charity foundation is all."
He along with the five other top performers on the Stars that season are going to get in front of a group of reporters and talk about what it felt like to be going to the finals in the ALCS for the first time in an eight season drought.
just yet, most of his personality tucked away in a studio space towards the back of the apartment that he’s renovated into more of a workshop. It pales in comparison to his labs at his and his parents’ houses back in California, but the scant space works well enough as a foundry for the ideas that just won’t leave him alone.
They’re up 3-0 by the fourth inning when there is a sudden whistle blown, right as Tony is in his wind-up. He falters, still releasing the ball which goes off kilter, bouncing off the batter’s helmet. Steve is puzzled as Natasha runs out onto the field, waving over one of the refs. She’s holding her clipboard up to block her face from any cameras. Several minutes of halted play pass. The stadium is restlessly quiet, their outfielders moving closer to call to the infield for some kind of explanation as to what’s going on. Steve gives a shrug, glancing between Quill on second and Clint on third only to earn equally clueless looks.
Steve isn’t surprised by Tony’s absence. While it’s supposedly for both of his parents, it’s quite clear it centers around Howard, everyone there focusing on all his accomplishments for the greatest sport in America. Maria is mentioned mostly as an afterthought. Steve only really tunes in when it’s Peggy who takes to the podium to speak.
Steve leans in close to him, keeping his voice low, “As glad as I am everyone is having fun, I kind of wish it was just the two of us so I could kiss you at midnight.”
Steve mutes the TV again once the next speaker steps up, realizing his own cheeks are wet with tears. He had been so preoccupied with thinking about Tony that he hadn’t even reached out to Peggy or thought about how she has lost family too.
his own, but it’s also the first time he gets the chance to take Tony apart for once.
Tony mockingly mirrors his incredulous look. “Why would I bother trying to find a more permanent residence? We travel a lot anyway, and who knows if I’ll even be here next season. Plus, I get all the perks of room service and don’t have to deal with annoying neighbors.”
"I'm sorry." Steve takes a deep breath. "When it was time for contract signing, even when we talked about it leading up to that, you seemed to make it very clear that you wanted Buck and me for the long term, and you wanted us together."
After about seven miles with breaks in between, they finally come to a stop at Carol’s cabin. Her parents are just now getting up for the day and insist Tony stays for a hearty breakfast. The Danvers are kind and welcoming, surprising Tony when they bring up how shameful it is that people are reacting so negatively to his coming out. On basic instinct, Tony just assumes that 90% of the older generation are the ones who spearhead the hateful movement against queer communities. Carol cordially shifts the topic away from that when Tony’s discomfort is clear, making a face at him from across the table.
“It’s fixed?” Steve asks incredulously. “I didn’t even tell you what was wrong with it— I mean, I didn’t even know what was wrong, it just stopped working one day.”
His mind berates him for his foolishness.
"So..." Steve pleads. "Trust in me Tony, give me a chance."
"I love you, Steve," Tony said. "When this is all over, we’ll be okay, I promise, I just need to bring Obadiah down and reclaim SI, reclaim what has been lost to me."
This Chapter is dedicated to small Steve, my wild violinist.
However, the tricky part is coming: the notes are starting to become complicated, and he knows Steve is gonna ramp up his performance. There it is, the erraticness of the music coming from Steve's bow, how can he keep up? Tony focuses on the score, and the notes that are sprawled across it start to fade and some fuse together to the point that it becomes unreadable. The notes are escaping him. He glances at Steve, who confidently continues to play his  part, and then he unintentionally glances at the audience which is a grave mistake.
pianist?" Steve exclaims.
"Oh, sassy!" Tony chuckles, and JARVIS heaves another sigh. Steve really does wonder, sometimes, why Tony programmed him to be able to do that. It's amusing, if nothing else.
“Why?” Tony presses on, and when Steve’s blue piercing eyes looked straight towards his line of vision, Tony felt his cheeks grow hot. He apologizes instead for pressing on.
Tony, on the other hand, finds himself ghosting the piano keys in thin air. Somehow, his brain tells him that he should stop. Stop this foolishness, yet he knows, deep in his heart, he can’t. There is an irresistible urge to do it.
Steve stares back with his light blue eyes twinkling. "C'mon, it will  be fun, and I know a good cafe downtown."
"Is he okay?" she asks Steve as he limps past her, Tony nestled in his arms.
It’s dark, yet the street lamp's light is enough to illuminate the man's features. Steve recognizes his former classmate from college--Tony Stark's face was gaunt, sickly-looking with his unkempt beard and hollow cheeks. Tony wore a dark poncho over his body for warmth. It is November, winter is soon approaching.
If only the armor could speak, it would tell you the most remarkable love story it has ever witnessed.
In the middle of the park, he sees a teen around his age blissfully playing the harmonica, Tony watches the musician sway to the beat of the playful tune he plays. His small physique makes him a bit shorter than Tony, yet his blonde hair perfectly compliments his beautiful face. Tony would describe his face as wonderfully chiseled and symmetrical, his eyes have long light lashes, and Tony can tell that he has a full bottom lip by the way he blows air into his instrument. In front of him are three children, their faces in awe, and perhaps his own face too as he joins the young audience.
For the first time in four years, Tony can hear the notes again, and he’s able to concentrate more on Steve's playing. Steve can lead, and he’ll follow, but there will still be a divergence in their playing, a certain style unique to each of them. He can hear the audience starting to warm up, the earlier disaster no longer weighed his mind down anymore. It is true, the music is within him, waiting to be released. Little by little, he draws out his passion. Everyone can hear his love for it. And, for the first time, when Steve and he reach their last notes, Tony feels like he has reached the shore and is finally safe from drowning.
warmth... whether it may be in the form of coffee or hot cocoa.
He knows that Rhodey is always at his side.
"Why?"
He places the sweater neatly on top of Steve’s blue bed cover, and he hears something ping from Steve’s desktop.
It's a familiar dance between them, and JARVIS makes an annoyed sound. "As usual, I can scan both of you at the same time. I am multi-talented in that way."
“Steve?” Tony questions trying to remember his basics on the Heimlich maneuver. Steve can’t die today!

There is a faint echo of the violin playing in the background. Tony hopes that Steve will continue , but the playing stops.
"I hear that." Leaning across the bed, she turns the lamp off, sending the room into darkness save for the dim lights of the hallway. "Goodnight, Steve."
"Oh look there he is!" Nat says, and Tony watches the children give Steve a bouquet of freshly picked flowers from the park.
Steve breathes a sigh of relief. "We really need some time off. This, all of this, is too much." Studying Tony for just a moment, he decides to let him sleep for a few as he finally peels off his uniform and heads into the bathroom to start a bath. He's able to get Tony mostly undressed without waking him, but Steve knows he needs Tony sitting up to finish. "Sweetheart," he gently prods, "come on, baths ready."
for. And here Tony didn’t think he could get a coach scarier than Natasha— boy, was he wrong.
A door opens from behind them, Howard now entering the room. "Sorry about that, everyone, conference call from China ran long." He’s wearing a three-piece suit, making it evident that Steve was not as inappropriately dressed as Tony tried to make him believe.
The Avengers are playing another home friendly today, a double-header against a team from New Hampshire. Despite their loss in last year’s post-season, the team feels stronger than ever so far with all their exhibition games. It was the first year in over a decade since they were even able to make it to the Championship, the team from Manhattan now growing into a fan favorite to take it all the way again this season.
Steve just grunts in a reply and takes matters into his own hands, unbuckling the belt and placing it in Tony’s waiting hand. Tony puts it aside and digs through his own drawers, finding a sleek black belt with a designer buckle. He tosses the belt to Steve this time, seeing the way he reacted when Tony got a bit too close and personal with his bits. He lets his eyes trail lower, at least pleased that Steve had the mind to wear a casual dress shoe.
Maria points out the window, down towards the building Steve had seen before from the dining room. He just now notices that the lights are on. “Whenever he’s upset, Tony goes to his lab to do work.” She presses her lips together. “I’m glad he has that safe space at the very least when he wants to get away from everything.”
“How does your knee feel?” Tony asks after his hunger is sated, now able to properly think straight again.
Steve’s expression is crestfallen, all the anger immediately leaving his eyes. “Are you sure?”
The fresh wave of anger and hurt ambushes Steve, heat flaring up inside of him and licking painfully at old wounds. “
on my life.”
"Yes, thank you, ma'am," Steve accepts some of the hors d’oeuvres off the plate. Crackers and cheese seems almost too simple for this kind of family, even with the cheese coming in perfect spherical form, sitting on seasoned crackers in the shape of flowers. He follows after Tony and Maria through a doorway to the right of the house, into their parlor. The room has huge windows, as did every other room in the house, and a large faux fur rug in the middle of the floor. There is an enormous fireplace underneath a large portrait of their family, immediately drawing Steve closer. It seems a few years old, Tony grinning handsomely, not a hint of teenage unrefinement in his features. Steve is painfully jealous while looking around at a few of the other pictures of a young Tony in the room. The kid never had an awkward stage it seems.
Tony opens his mouth for some biting remark but decides against it before he can voice his opinion. "Yeah, fine," he concedes. “And people call
from stealthy. He picks up his phone with a sigh. “I’m sorry, Ty is here.”
Tony was standing behind Peggy looking impatient but still somehow smug. This kid was taking over his team's attention, his own preferred defensive position on the field, all of Steve's patience, and now this. Steve draws a line in the sand. He doesn't get Peggy too.
“Want to grab a bite?” Steve asks as they head out to the parking lot.
, then you’re lying to yourself and you know it.  And I bet Steve knows it too.”
“Steve,” Tony grabs his attention.
Another day in school doesn't erase the thoughts of the past weekend in Tony's mind.
There is a pause
- This is Thor's piece in the competition.
In the kitchen, Steve dumps the bags of cold cuts, some fruit, and the water bottles into a reusable shopping bag to make it easy to carry. He snatches a package of cookies from Clint's shelf, silently promising to replace them, and heads back to his and Tony's rooms.
Rated: Gen
“You are intelligent and decisive, qualities that I really value,” Steve says, now with his smile widening, and if only Tony’s brain isn’t exploding at the moment, he would have seen Steve’s face getting redder and redder as he talked.
Have you eaten?
Rated: Gen
He remembers Tony as that bright, rich kid that he met during their ROTC classes. Often, Tony was always the butt of the joke because Officer Hammer was another rich kid infatuated with Stark, yet Stark always turned down his advances. However, Tony's wit had saved him from the jokes, and whatever ill thing that has been said about him came back to bite Hammer's ass, causing their officer to punish Tony further. Tony never minded the humiliation and punishments, though.
Tony's hands relax in Steve's as he takes a deep breath.
10… 9… 8…
Steve nods at the explanation.
I've made some Omelette and toast, they're on the counter.

"Great! I will expect you then. You'll love him Tony. You two might even bond about playing musical instruments, who knows?" She gives him a pleased smile.
How's your day?
"Well, there’s  this guy who wants me to introduce him to Bucky… you know, one of those Bucky fanboys." Natasha says as she adjusts the strap of her backpack. "He just transferred here this school year, he says his parents travel a lot, and he’s been a long time fan of Bucky's Tiktok videos… anyways, I told him I’m close friends with Bucky Barnes, and he was ecstatic! So I said, maybe I could introduce you to him?"
"Elaborate, please?" Tony's brows furrow, uncomfortable with the idea.
Natasha pats Tony's back and he looks over to see her smirking. Before turning back to Bucky and Steve, who are animatedly chatting with each other.
Tony looks at the window, mortified that it’s been broken for the nth time by Natasha. The fact that he requested to use the music room today means that he is responsible for anything that happens to the room during his requested time. How many times has he written an incident report about Natasha breaking the window? Twice? or Thrice in a month? The window is lucky if it survives for 2 weeks max. As his thoughts swirl around inside his head, the young athlete continues talking, sharing her need to impress Pepper and gain a
He goes inside Steve’s room, which was hastily put together. Steve isn’t necessarily a neat person, but he tries to. On the other hand, Tony had been very meticulous with his stuff that everything in his room has its own proper place.
Steve could feel his eyes go blurry with tears.
“Yeah, he does,” Steve says, causing Tony to bite his lower lip.
“Wine?”
He pulls his motorbike over to the lonely sidewalk. Even New York is lifeless now despite the lights.
He knows he's blessed beyond anything.
The sun rays penetrate through the blinds, causing Steve to arouse from his slumber. The first thing he sees is Tony's form snuggled against his. Steve watches for a moment when he hears some rustling from the kitchen,
Steve breaks into an easy smile. Ahhh, he is so handsome when he does that. “Thank you, Tony,” he says. He gestures Tony to their small dining area, and Tony could see the groceries on the counter. “I’ve got us some roasted chicken and mashed potato.”
"But you could have lost," Tony continues frankly. "You can't rely on audience impact always, the judges…" he falters for a moment as he remembers his father's words. "The judges won't care if you entertained the audience; you have to play the music right."
Maybe it's because he is Captain America?
"Then why would you decide to fu-"
And when it was time to go to boarding school, he wore all of his captain America shirts to feel a bit braver.
It starts with simple melodies accompanied by the noise of children playing in the background, their laughter hanging in the air. The sound of a harmonica seems to be coming from the center of the park. He follows the music.
"Steve," he says softly as Steve loosens his grip on his collar. "I'm sorry."
It's evening by the time the team gets back to the tower, the sun setting low over the Manhattan skyline and the streets busy with commuters racing to make their trains and subways. The mid-Autumn air is crisp and scented with wet asphalt from a rainstorm that had swept through barely an hour before, and the landing pad is slick when the Aven-jet's motors go silent. The team is heavy with fatigue; they are injured, exhausted, and worn out. It's been nearly three weeks non-stop; something about the October ambience has sent villains from as far as China and as close as China Town into a feeding frenzy. The Avengers are victorious, as they usually are, but it comes with a cost.
But aside from those facts,
"What do you say? Saturday? 3pm in the park outside the concert hall?"
“Coming home with you and to you had been the highlight that I could never put my finger on till I realized it a few months ago,” Steve huffs. “I can’t explain it, Tony. I like you. And I could only hope that you like me back too,”
then the image of his father flashes through his mind. Tony has to distract himself.
But Tony Stark was cold and precise, formulaic. He was focused on the piano keys, playing as if he knew exactly what the piece’s composer had envisioned when he’d written the piece. The judges watching  the performance were impressed, but then suddenly in the middle of his performance, the child genius stopped playing.
to soothe her nerves.
Tony scoffs. He must sound funny, his explanation is ridiculous. "However, the sound that doesn't register is the sound of my playing."
Tony knew ever since he was 13 that he was into boys. He finds ladies attractive but not attractive enough to invite them to his bed.
He couldn't help but stop mid-performance. Tony covers his ears with his hands, clearly panic-stricken. What is he supposed to do now?
"Listen," Tony says, "I… I'm thinking of calling Steve, I… I don't think I can do this,"
Natasha is limping, having landed hard on her right ankle after dodging from gunfire. Clint is nursing a concussion, leaning on Thor, whose right arm is in a sling. Bruce is barely conscious, shuffling along the walkway and muttering something about sleeping for a week.
Everyone cheers except for Tony.
“Sorry, but I think Bucky’s a bit of an asshole towards him.”
She gives him a sigh. "We would need your help Tony," she pleads.. "He is a classical musician. A violinist. And Bucky doesn’t know much about classical music, but you do, we just need to establish common ground."
Tony watches the two share pleasantries until Bucky shows up, and Natasha introduces Bucky to the blonde who goes by Steve. From the exchange, he pieces together that this is the guy Natasha wants  Bucky to meet and possibly date.
-This is T'Challa's piece during the competition.
"BUCKY!" the two teenagers yell at their other friend.
Everyone wanted a piece of him.
Why shouldn't he be?
There is a pause. Tony says nothing, as he digests Steve's words in his head.
The ump stands by his decision, meaning that their pitcher is only one poor throw away from giving up the lead they had started with this inning. The argument having wrapped up, Tony hops back to his left, giving up a few feet of his lead-off just in time for the pitcher to turn around, checking that the only current base runner is still keeping himself on first. There’s a lot of pressure weighing down on the pitcher right now, the catcher also completely preoccupied as they try to settle what pitch to attempt next. Trying to throw off the batter with another pitch outside of the strike zone is too dangerous; They can’t risk giving up a walk. With Tony as a lower priority, it’s as simple as Tony taking off at full tilt, simultaneous with the fastball.
The bat whiffs through the air, counting it as a strike. As soon as the ball connects with the catcher’s mitt, he’s immediately firing it back into the infield. Tony’s too quick, and the ball shoots just out of the second baseman’s reach. A costly maneuver on the IL’s part means that Tony slides into second before he can be tagged. It’s a clean steal that’s met with mixed response from the audience.
“I can stay,” Steve yawns, wiping at the tears that gather in his eyes in result.
“Mmhm,” Natasha rolls her eyes but accepts it before looping her arm through Steve’s and walking back towards the dance floor. “Thanks for saving me back there. James is much better at the… small talk,” she sighs, suppressing a shudder.
For the next couple of weeks, Steve is glued to the news cycle. He actually listens to the radio in his car on the way to and from the stadium, leaves his TV on in the background while at home hoping to hear something of Tony’s whereabouts. No one seems to have a clue, most of them stating he has not been spotted in New York or California, but that they’ve heard he’s back in Malibu making arrangements for the funeral and memorial services. Natasha tells him Fury will be flying out and that there’s a ticket for him if he wants it. It doesn’t feel like his place. He wants to support Tony, but he had only met Howard twice and Maria once. It wouldn’t feel right to go, and he wasn’t sure if he could handle the rejection if he showed up and Tony didn’t want him there.
“Actually, I’m kind of craving Italian.”
Tony turns the TV off and hurls the remote across the room. His phone starts ringing again, Tony answering it just to put an end to at least one of the calls.
Steve ignores him and storms down the hallway towards Peggy's office, not even sure if she’s here today. He rounds the corner and can spot his manager through her slightly cracked door, seated behind her desk, talking on the phone. She's smiling and laughing at something the person on the other line is saying, but that doesn't stop Steve from barging into her office.
Steve raises his eyebrows. “Are you asking me seriously?”
His knocking at Tony’s door doesn’t receive a response at first, and Steve is worried that between the phone call and now Tony had somehow jetted off somewhere. His irrational fear is eventually qualmed when he hears some movement in the apartment after a few minutes.
Anger flares up inside of him and it takes all of his self control to bite back his retort that he wasn’t the reason the game was getting held up. Furious, he turns back around, trying to shake off the comments from behind him. He winds up and pitches the next ball, immediately feeling that it left his hand all wrong from how he intended it.
“No, that’s not what I mean,” he cuts off Tony’s drunken rambling. “I mean… This. Us. Can we talk about it?”
Tony catches him staring again, laughter tapering off and expression softening to match Steve’s. He looks away first, mirthful, caramel eyes settling on Bucky and Natasha reluctantly kissing again when everyone starts clinking their silverware against their glasses.
Something flickers in her gaze, a discomfort that doesn’t ease any of his reservations in that moment as his mind starts to draw conclusions he hopes aren’t true. “Why don’t you have a seat, Tony.” She requests softly.
They haven’t even won yet— haven’t even tied— but that doesn’t stop the entire International team from surging out of the dugout to join in a celebratory pile-up on home plate as if they had. Steve had just knocked a ball all the way into the stands, bringing the score up to 7-9.
"Tony, it's four in the afternoon..." Steve says weakly as Tony folds himself up in the passenger seat, pushing his sunglasses up on his nose. He doesn't argue further, because he really wants to drive Tony's nice Bugatti. "Where do you want to eat?"
Steve clears his throat awkwardly. “There’s always a learning curve to switching teams, but Tony’s doing really well. The players are beginning to warm up to his… quirks. Even Coach Romanoff—”
Steve wanders around in the house, peeking into unlocked doors to find unoccupied bedrooms or bathrooms, trying to find a good candidate for their little tryst. He sneaks upstairs, listening for wedding guests passing by who all seem to be on the first floor, not wandering far from the ballroom where the reception is being held. He hears the sound of hasted footsteps and a door closing from a few feet away, quickly following the sound.
baseball, but here he is showing up early and staying late for practices, insisting just two weeks after his parents died in a horrific accident that he needs to play again… His coping methods clearly aren’t normal,” Rhodes sighs, staring out alongside Steve as they watch Tony pitch to the next player. There’s still something off, his posture much more stiff than usual, his decisions seeming erratic, but he manages to strike them out. Something about what Rhodey said to him must be getting through one way or another. “I know you have a soft spot for him, but what he needs right now is a reality check from his friends, not coddling from his teammates.”
Steve follows him without protest. Going with Tony wasn’t part of the plan, but he has a fair point. Leaves crunch under their feet as they trudge up the path, winding their way through the stretches of gravestones as they make their way to the top of the hill.
Steve steps forward when it’s time for him to take his own walk up the aisle next to Clint. The two best men are the last to go, one for the groom, and one for the bride.
Steve continues to press. If Tony didn't want to admit he was sleeping with Christine, that was fine, but Steve was going to confront this woman himself if she thought drugging people was acceptable. "Let me in, Tony."
Tony picks up a decorative paperweight from his coffee table and hurls it at the wall, Coulson and Hill both ducking away from the impact. It shatters against the TV screen, effectively cutting out the sound, splintering the glass front as the pixels flicker to a brilliant rainbow of blocky color and static before going black.
"Are you referencing teams like the Malibu Irons and namely the behavior of newest player Ton—"
“Maybe you will,” Tony smiles at her, folding his hands on the table. “My friend Steve here is ready to order.”
“Describe it,” Tony sighs, tightening his fist and sinking back into his pillows, closing his eyes. He spreads his legs on instinct, wishing Steve could be in that space, leaning over him and covering his body as his hardness hangs down between them, Steve pulling himself off, those intense blue eyes locked on his own—
The drink is delicious. It’s warm, sweet but not too sweet, has a clear alcohol kick to it but not in a way that’s overpowering, and Steve immediately takes another sip despite the worries of burning his own tongue. Tony walks past him to unceremoniously flop onto the couch, arm hanging off the side to grope around until his fingers enclose around the vodka bottle on the floor.
“Yeah, but that was then. Half a year ago. And we’ve both felt something for each other for longer than that, so what are you so afraid of?”
“Obie. Investors. The board. The press. Fans,” Tony clarifies before swallowing thickly. “And Howard.”
They arrive at the front of the room, dropping their linked arms to instead face each other, clasping each other’s hands. Clint is already weeping openly, holding a tissue up to his face to muffle the quiet sobs. Tony rubs his back comfortingly, Carol standing behind him and reaching around to do the same while clearly trying to hold back laughter. From where he’s standing, Steve isn’t able to fully see Bucky’s face, but he can tell by the body language alone that he’s moved to tears as well.
The tables have flipped on him since the All-Star game he played two years ago. He’s now playing
. Even though Tony has never met Coach Romanoff before today, there is a small, sane part of his brain that concludes that maybe pushing that final button isn’t the best idea.
Rhodey pops over the back of the chairs, watching in amusement as Tony makes a show of picking out the brackets for everyone to start competing in. He sets down a beer on the table next to Steve. “Told you not to worry about him liking it or not.”
“Of course,” Steve nods. “Thanks for talking to me about it… Like I mentioned before, your secret is safe with me.”
“Tony,” Steve calls out to him, voice raising in panic as he takes a few apprehensive steps closer. “Please, stop. Just sit back down and we can talk about this. I didn’t mean that
Tony huffs, turning his face into Steve’s hand to kiss his palm. “There’s no one even close, Steve.”
“Hey, Tony, you free later? If you’re not satisfied after getting fucked during this game today, I saw some old Wall Street pervs at our hotel who would probably love some company!”
“On second thought, maybe you should go back. A lot less rain in Malibu.”
“I love you too,” is all he can muster for a response, leaning in to kiss Tony once more. He wants it to be assuring, to confirm that Tony does show it, and apologize for ever doubting his fears were anything but genuine. “I’m sorry for being insecure, and that it was putting pressure on you. I only wanted to ask for more because… I don’t want to lose you,” he holds Tony’s face in his hands, watching the tension leave his face. “I didn’t want you to get bored and move on to someone who can give you more than I can.”
"Rhodes, perfect, where's Tony?" Steve asks.
"You really think Tony gets into that kind of stuff?" Steve asks, put off by Natasha's blasé attitude around Tony's supposed drug trip. Of course, Steve knows better, but even if he didn't, he'd hope their coach would show a little more concern.
, Tony. Some of them fight tooth and nail for years to get their opportunities, and you’re so damn
Steve makes a show of looking up towards the ceiling in thought. “Now, if only there was an immensely popular, successful, Major League Team in New York, full of promising, young, talented players and fresh management and leadership, strongly beloved or detested by all, that even non-baseball fans regard as one of the best teams…”
Steve shuts off his shower and turns to see Tony is staring at him, one dark eyebrow quirking upwards in a challenge. He leans casually against the linoleum wall, practically
"Okay, thanks. I'll see you in the morning, Tony."
“Yes please,” Sam groans, leaning back against the couch. Natasha scoops up all their empty glasses and heads to the kitchen.
