Tony’s eyes widened as he blinked over-exaggeratedly. “Excuse me? Twenty-
Tony nodded. “Sure. Why not?”
“Why does everything have to fly?” Jennifer asked. “Can’t we just have some things stay grounded?”
“Because he’s Spider-Man!” Johnny shouted, unthinking. His eyes immediately widened and his hands flew up to cover his mouth.
“I got you a car.”
“Breaking news! Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, also known as the superheroes Captain America and Iron Man, have just been revealed to be soulmates!” A reporter close to the podium smiled widely at the cameraman from her station. “That’s right! We have the moment their soulmarks appeared on camera! We’re reporting live from Central Park right now as this amazing, once-in-a-lifetime event plays out!”
Steve exchanged a look with Tony. They were here for a specific reason. They really should stay on task. But Tony’s eyes lit up at the mere suggestion of this unexpected drama.
Bobbi nodded. “Cass will handle it. Just give her a minute.”
“I don’t know! I’m trying to figure it out.” Tony leaned back, realizing he was getting stressed out all over again. “We’ve been friends for so long. It’s just, I don’t know. I don’t know how to even talk about it.”
“Always,” Steve replied as he jogged to the elevator, ready to put on the suit and go.
The camera shook up and down as the person holding it moved quickly towards the stage.
“Because of Thanos.”
The camera zoomed in on Steve’s face, twisting in anger as he pointed at a reporter before Sam ran up, smiling as he pulled Captain America away.
This is like the most obvious of obvious, but you’d be surprised how many people want to find their soulmates but cut off the easiest way! Exposing your hand is exposing yourself… to L-O-V-E.
“Actually, I heard he’s quite beloved in Latveria,” Sue said, pointing at Tony.
It had been such a fast, sudden event that Steve really didn’t have the time to be
“Oh for—are you okay?” Tony asked, irritated. “Is your throat clear? Do you need a lozenge?”
Still. There was no misinterpreting a kiss. And it was a great way to go for a start. No actual contact yet so Tony wasn’t put on the spot. Just enough to be obviously clear about his intentions.
6: Steve’s romantic interest in him began today after their soulmarks happened.
Tony waved a hand in front of his face. “Oh, this old thing? I’ve had it forever.” He laughed once, half-heartedly. “Yeah, no, I appreciate it. Thanks.”
“Oh, are you?” Tony smirked around his straw.
“Okay, you should stop killing people,” Tony blurted. “That’s what I’m getting at here.”
“Yep.” Tony cleared his throat, ran his fingers along the edge of the glass, then crossed his arms and leaned forward onto the table. “So, uh, how do you feel about that?”
“What do you think?” Tony asked.
[__]  1     < >     <3
“Okay, I got it,” Peter replied. “What kind of pics are you looking for? Valiantly fighting off enemies together? Out for a cup of coffee? Holding hands?”
“We haven’t had the time,” Tony explained.
Steve sighed. “I just feel like I owe him an apology. A really good one.”
Steve looked over at him. “Are you excited about Christmas?”
Sue rubbed his arm. “Sure you could, honey. Sure you could.”
Castle stared pointedly at Tony. “Don’t push it.” He turned around and walked away, out of Tony’s line of sight.
Even with that initial hesitance and anxiety-ridden wait, Johnny had never really thought Peter wouldn’t want to meet his family. They were the Fantastic Four. Everybody wanted to meet them. But Peter kept arguing that it wasn’t safe. If he didn’t think he could trust the Fantastic Four, who could he ever trust with his secret identity? Johnny had no clue how to fix this.
“Matt, I’m not sure we should be going this fast,” Foggy muttered, eyes trained on the ground, darting back and forth to inspect each step before he took it.
Steve nodded slightly. “Yeah. But this is different.”
Tony sighed. “You know, I’ll do it, but only because I’m incredibly magnanimous. I have my own problems. Is that shocking?”
“Still haven’t eaten,” Steve replied with a smile.
Tony glared at her.
“Yep.” Tony popped the ‘p’, pointing at Spider-Man in agreement.
Steve shrugged. “Sure, but…” He sighed. “I don’t know. How much does that matter?”
Dum-E’s arm drooped.
Carol’s hand appeared much bigger as she waved it in front of the camera. “I really like your mark,” she commented. Her hand dropped as she gestured to her own suit. “Obviously I’m biased, but the red and blue make such a statement. I love it.”
“Yes! Cagey!” Foggy insisted. “And I can’t help you find the perfect gift if you don’t tell me who the lucky guy is.”
“I would hardly describe the man in such complimentary terms,” Namor protested. “He is a peon pretending at greatness. Nothing more.”
Matt holds up a finger. “But
Bobbi laughed. “I remember that!” She glanced over at Bruce. “We got stuck in traffic around their tower. Nearly five hours!”
“Ms. Potts!”
“That’s it!” Tony exclaimed. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., I’m a genius!”
“Yes, really.” Castle glowered at him. “I already regret this.”
Johnny made a disbelieving face. “Come on. Obviously not.”
Sam dragged the guy around to the hallway. “Come on, let’s go.” He started dragging the man back to the main entrance. Bruce got up and followed along as backup, twisting his neck around. The man became a lot more pliant when he saw who was behind him.
The television showed Pepper spreading her hands out in greeting. “I’m able to answer a few questions.”
Tony nodded, unwilling to scare Steve away and hoping Sam’s teasing was a good sign. “Sure.”
Tony waved casually before disappearing around the corner. Steve looked after him longer than he should have before shaking himself out of it. There was nothing wrong with being friends with Tony. Teammates. He had a good relationship with a man he respected and admired. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing at all.
Vision frowned. “I have heard Galactus is unbeatable in combat, thus ensuring his never-ending dominance over the galaxy.” Wanda elbowed him. Vision looked over and studied her face. “Ah,
You better [9:15 pm]
“I’m so glad I have friends.” Tony looked at his bare wrist, ensuring it was in the screen for them to see. “Oh, look! Time to go hang out with my other friends, Galactus and Red Skull!”
Steve turned his left hand over, presenting his palm to Tony. They both looked down at his left hand. The mark spread out over his palm and fingers, sparkling a strong, bright red and yellow with small elements of white-ish blue appearing in tiny dots and lines. The colors moved quickly around the mark—as fast as Steve imagined Tony’s brain worked, as fast as Iron Man could fly.
Bruce looked over towards the front door. “Looks like he ordered about ten.”
you wont [8:59 pm]
Tony smirked. “Well, Mr. Rogers. Are you saying you were unprepared?”

“Why do you think you need a gift?” Bucky frowned. “I don’t think Stark’s
“Doom,” Clint replied, bored. “Ten bucks on it.”
Everyone began to get one or two slices, and soon enough two of the boxes were empty. Tony stayed sitting on the counter, frustrated.
“Johnny’s not soulmates with Cap,” Rhodey pointed out.
“And he said ‘oh, gee, Tone, that’d be, well, gosh’ and then
Tony spared a thought for whatever Hulk was doing in the sewers, and another for whatever Spider-Man was doing wherever he had swung off to, but he had his own mission in mind. On one hand, he thought he’d be more satisfied with getting an answer for how he had been framed. On the other, it only made him even more determined to find who was behind this. Someone had created a realistic hologram of his armor and specifically programmed it to look destructive, to actually appear to destroy civilian property, while these little annoying mini-bots were the real culprits. He was going to find this person. He was.

Steve had a comment on the tip of his tongue. Shouldn’t be hard for you. You’re always pretty. Or even more daringly, want some company? But the words wouldn’t come out. He imagined them vividly, like colors on a clear canvas, filling up the empty space between them. But in the end, all he said was, “Eight a.m. sharp.”
Tony waited a moment. “… And?”
Tony shook his head. “Only a few comments, nothing really substantial.”
he say? Maybe it was for the best not to comment to anyone before he and Tony had a chance to talk.
Sam elbowed Steve. “Took you long enough.”
This time, Tony did toast them as he walked away. He began to inspect the party-goers, making the rounds as he greeted and entertained them. But his eyes kept travelling over to Steve. It wasn’t exactly intentional. It was just that Steve looked so good in his dumb Christmas sweater and tight jeans. Besides sheer lust, Tony had an actual reason to keep an eye on Steve. He had a plan to talk to him at some point. It was just about finding a good time. It didn’t appear to be now, though. Bucky was furtively talking with Steve, who seemed to be trying not to look at Tony. Which, hey, that was fine. He could speak with Steve later.

“People already picked your face out of a crowd,” Sue stated. “This really isn’t that different.”
[__]  1     < >  5     <3  5
Tony smirked. “Sure. I’ll text you if the sky falls, too.”
“Hm?”
oh [11:13 pm]
“A brick is different! It could have caused a serious injury!”
The burger place was old-fashioned. Despite the clichés and jokes everyone made about him, sometimes he really did feel more comfortable in places like this. The restaurant was mostly painted in light pink and mint green with occasional silver additions. It had a wrap-around bar with barstools set every three feet in front of it. There were booths all along the walls—one underneath each of the glass pane windows. Tables and chairs took up most of the middle of the room. A light-up menu hung above the bar, and small advertisements for specials were placed on every table next to the napkin dispenser and ketchup. The best part was the place didn’t even have an official name. The sign outside was just a neon outline of a hamburger. As an artist, Steve had a healthy appreciation of a good logo.
[__]  1     < >     <3
Tony blinked. “That’s… very nice. Thank you.”
“We just don’t understand why you haven’t introduced him to us,” Sue said, looking at him with compassion in full big sister mode.
both.”
“It’s hopeless.” Tony threw his hands in the air, walking away from Rhodey with the air of a man who’d had enough. “Completely hopeless.”
Tony gestured to himself. “Moi? Need help with robots? No. No, no, no, you heard wrong.”
It seemed impossible to think they hadn’t touched yet. How could that be? How?
“He asked how bad it was.”
Johnny and Ben were sitting at opposite ends of one couch, with Ben leaning back and looking
“Practice.”
“I’ll tell you what, you’ve got a repeat customer, buddy.” Ben chuckled as he pushed his phone back into his pocket.
“I don’t know why everyone’s so focused on your mark,” Steve said with a bit of a pout. “I got a great one, too.”
“I mean I’ve been in love with you for years,” Steve stated. “You’re one of the people I trust the most in the world. I’m not going to act like we don’t have a solid foundation of friendship here. If you wanted to try something with me, I know you’d bring it up because you honestly want to and you think I’d enjoy it, too. Whatever that means, I’m open to exploring it with you.”
“Trust me, Cap, it’s news.” Sam smiled, amused by his friend’s comments.
Steve shook his head. “You can pull out my shirt any time you want.”
“Whoa there,” Bucky said, voice coming unexpectedly from behind. “Skrull or Hydra?”
!” Tony looked like he was ready to strangle him. “I’ve been in love with you for years, Steve!
“Yeah, shellhead. I’m here.”
Well, one of them. The other came down the stairs to his workshop, shaking her head. Carol looked at Rhodey, amused. “Is he being overdramatic about the missiles?”
Steve looked at Sue, confused. “Where did you hear that?”
“Understood, sir.”
Steve was right, as usual. In another five minutes, they started the debriefing, which went fairly smoothly. Tony was on his phone for some of it, only half-listening as he dealt with approving a few new designs for Stark Industries to begin testing. He made a few minor technical notes on issues he knew would pop up. It was easy enough to do alongside the briefing since he didn’t have any new information to add about the battle.
“He is,” Steve assured. “Tony’s… he’ll make sure everyone else is taken care of first before he gets to himself. That’s not how people see him. But that’s how he is.”
“What Clint said.” Steve shook his head, pausing before casually continuing, “Steve time.”
Steve sighed. “It’s for Tony,” he admitted. “I couldn’t find anything for him on my own, and I asked around but nobody had any good ideas.”
“Uh…?”
processing what he was seeing.
“It’s okay. I had to remind Tony, too. He’s waiting for you on the roof landing.”
Cassie nodded. “Bye, guys! Congratulations, Cap!”
Matt slapped his hand on his forehead.
He pushed that thought to the side as he began tracking the bots. As soon as he hacked into the firewall of the nearest one, it glowed a dull red and began to rise into the air.
Sue held up her hands. “Please, don’t mind him. We’ve always got some kind of family drama going on. I’m sure you know how it is.”
“Uh, less soulmate flirting please?” Tony quipped, distractedly keeping up their usual banter as he scanned for the source of where the bots were coming from. Besides, why was it always soulmates? He needed a break from it all. “I’m trying to work here.”
Pepper walked alongside Tony, frowning at her longtime friend. “I thought you’d be happier about this?”
“You don’t see cameras like that anymore.” Steve nodded to the instrument. “Everything’s digital these days.”
Steve was still staring at him. Tony felt his chest tighten.
Steve’s voice came through Tony’s comm. “Say thank you, Tony.”
“But they’re
“Wow,” Cassie muttered. “Drama-rama.”
Sam took the chair to the left of Steve. “You’re early.” He raised an eyebrow at Tony.
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. “What do you mean?”
“Of course you are.”
“I had a super soldier at my side. It was never going to hit me.”
Namor immediately began speaking over Tony. “There is nothing shameful about the Atlantean body. We train to peak physical perfection. Your eyes are blessed by the gift of viewing my skin.”
For the next fifteen minutes, there was very little talk over the comms. Tony was used to this part. Normally they’d take out the bots, find the villain of the day, and take care of them. But the bots kept coming, and Tony wasn’t getting a good read on how they seemed to be multiplying so quickly.
Spider-Man’s head popped up. “Really?”
Bucky’s eyes widened. “That’s not what I—”
Tony knew it was only a matter of time until he fixed the problem. With this lawsuit on his mind, it was of vital importance to get this upgrade in place. He needed to prove he could control his laser blasts down to a molecular level. That way he could factually dismiss all of his detractors.
“It’s more important,” Sam agreed. “So he might take some time to talk. But he wants to. Trust me.”
“If anyone can, it’s you, Iron Man.” He scratched his chin questioningly. “Aren’t you happy? I know you’ve liked Steve for forever.”
Finally, F.R.I.D.A.Y. replied, “I am now ready to pass judgment on the matter of your intelligence.”
“Tony, focus,” Steve said, but he sounded amused and Tony knew Steve wasn’t going to really get on his case. Yet.
Steve watched the man hurry away, wondering if he made the right call. He put the entire incident out of his mind and hailed a cab. It was done. Taking Tony home was his current priority.
He pressed two fingers to his temple as his shoulders sagged. “I forgot.”
! Here at Central Park, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark have just given each other their soulmarks! Get closer, get as much as you can!”
Tony laughed. “Wow, winghead.
Steve took a minute to turn off the lights as requested, realizing after he couldn’t find light switches that he’d have to ask F.R.I.D.A.Y. to do it. Once done, he picked up the blanket that was thrown to the side of the bed and laid down, covering both of them after he was settled. Part of Steve wanted to stay up and look at Tony—really take some time to appreciate this experience—but the majority of him was wiped out from the day. In fact, Steve was asleep before he realized his eyes were closing. His last conscious thought was that he wished he’d kept the lights on until he had gotten in bed so he could get a better look at Tony’s sleeping face.
The Stein @ChaseChaseChase * 28m
“Hello, and welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons!”
Steve walked forward, dropping both hands on the opposite side of the table Tony was using. “Tony. What are you trying to say? Do you not…” Steve trailed off, looking slightly away.
[9:10 pm] I’ll consider it.
There were also onlookers gathered behind the reporters. This was business as usual. The Avengers announced their appearances in advance in case anyone wanted to come. They went out publically enough that it wasn’t a big deal for most New Yorkers, who had their own affairs to be concerned with. Still, it gave Steve a warm feeling to see people who cared coming up to show it in person. He appreciated that kind of civic engagement.
“Is it a good person but a bad match?” Sue’s voice was quiet, hesitant. “Maybe… a distant relative?”
“Language, Captain Rogers,” Tony teased. He looked down at his hand in surprise, letting go of Steve’s shirt and running his hand down it once to smooth it out. “Sorry about your shirt.”
“Sure,” she replied. “And for Iron Man?”
Castle turned a corner, grabbing two guns faster than most people could blink. “Easy for you to say. Up there in your tower. Try living in the trenches, then see what you think.”
“Did you close the balcony door?” Tony asked, already knowing the answer.
Rhodey exchanged a glance with Carol. “We think you should try again.”
Tony glanced over to her. “You’re being very strange. Despite my innate trust of all human beings, I’m suspicious of your motivations.”
“When Captain America is your soulmate—”
Tony smiled back at them, simply letting himself be happy. “A billion.”
dont be a brat [8:41 pm]
He felt like he was straining something by pretending to be impressed. “Well, then, forgive me, your majesty.”
“I was actually just heading to bed,” Steve explained.
That was a real possibility. Steve had died once in the war. He had been revived through, frankly, a miraculous process that gave him a second chance at life. He and Bucky had discussed it often enough before Natasha—the idea that they had lost their soulmates decades earlier. Steve was happy for Bucky, but he knew the chances were slim of both of them having soulmates born so far in the future.
Tony slid into a booth right next to one of the large windows. He leaned back, letting his head fall on top of the cracked pleather that covered the seat. After a moment, Steve followed his lead. He sat on the opposite side of the booth without looking away from his long-time friend, newly-found soulmate.
Steve shook his head. “No, Tone. That’s so thoughtful. It’s… it’s a wonderful gift. Thank you.”
Reed looked confused but Steve, Ben, and Sue all laughed. Namor looked bored. Steve thought he appeared bored most of the time. He spared a thought for Johnny. He’d have liked to spend some more time with him—it was always a good idea to strengthen bonds within the superhero community. But it would have to wait for another day. They had a lot of work to do back at Avengers Tower. It would be irresponsible to put off solving the mystery of who made the fake doombots.
Steve cleared his throat. “So, um, how are you?”
Steve paid with a generous tip and picked up Tony, double-checking he had the helmet. Then he headed directly inside. No need to get noticed and stir up a frenzy. Once inside, though, Steve could only think that Tony needed to go to his workshop to take off his suit. So he took the elevator down and waited until F.R.I.D.A.Y. let them in to wake Tony up.
“And I kissed you.”
“You’re not going to complain about me getting in the way of your target?”
well [8:55 pm]
“Tell you what. I’ll double whatever those pictures are worth to you.”
“I’m texting Kate. She won’t believe it.” Clint pulled his phone out of his pocket, excitedly tapping out a message—with both his pointer fingers.
“He’s suing you.”
The entire table claps and cheers for a few seconds, which moves quickly into some of the players laughing, nodding, and talking amongst themselves.
“I agree. It’s weird. But it’s also weird that you never indicated you were interested in me before our marks appeared.” Tony tried to say it casually, but that kind of statement would set off Steve’s trouble sensors from a mile away.
He does not really notice how much it affects him or causes him until they are hidden in one of the rooms in one of the galas he has been forced to attend.
-I'm fine- kisses his cheek and then kissed him again on the lips, it is a calmer kiss, not as frantic as Steve had given her a few moments ago, she is giving him the most real thing between them, is Tony giving away a bit of her to Steve, sincere, tired, sore, even sad.
Then he fails when he hears her say - goodbye Steve- along with the pounding of Tony's shoes, he only stops when she is no longer there, and turns to see the path she has made to the exit as if he could still see her.
Tony's hands instead go down looking under the suit, she pulls his shirt off his belt and touches his abdomen, she seems to doubt for a moment, it's just an instant when she stays still even separating her lips from Steve's, but there is no time to question why because Tony licks her lips and Steve opens for her to take control of the kiss, while her hands keep going until she already has the shirt of the suit halfway to his body, her skilful fingers make his shiver arousal, touches his nipples and he can only move his hips looking to rub with something to ease his erection.
He is in the right universe, in the right place, but he is in the wrong time.
Steve drops his backpack in one of the compartments and turns to look at her, expected.
Tony sighs.
But when someone finally got through the shell that existed around her, that person became her world, Steve has seen how it happens, Natasha Romanov did it, under Antonia's defenses, she came under her skin and Tony lost the damn head for her.
She is avoiding him.
Steve touches her, his hands up the gray skirt following the path of her tights almost as soft as her silk robes until he finds the garters that hold them in place, it's almost as if Tony had prepared for this, it's so damn sexy that Steve can barely wait to put his lips there, he touches and she gives in, she allows it.
He hates not being able to see her face, because he loves to see Tony's expressions when they are this way, because for a moment all her masks and insinuations fall off and she shows the real Tony, full of desires and expectations that maybe will never be filled, but even with everything there is hope and warmth, there is always warmth in her eyes when she looks at him, but he knows that the moment he lets her go, she will take control of the encounter and drive him crazy.
He sits in this routine, until his commitment to S.H.I.E.L.D decides to interrupt it.
There are too many damn complications in their lives to even allow himself to consider completely that maybe he want to belong to the eccentric woman who looks at him with a tone of fun, desire and maybe a little need while finishing her third martini.
It is really incredible how suddenly everything is fixed and how suddenly she fits so well in his routine, sometimes they have lunch together, sometimes they meet to watch a movie on the big TV in the mansion, more times they find a place or a moment in which they will take the hand (or arm) of the other and will enter the first room with some furniture available to find better ways to be used.
Steve confronts him.
Steve lifts her up and sits her at the table, not in an attempt to make everything more sexual, but in an attempt to make her more comfortable while he is kissing her, not really needing it because Tony is just a few inches shorter than him, even less with the heels she is wearing and he just has to bend down a little to kiss her.
And Steve doesn't want to let her go, but he forces himself to do it, he forces himself to get away from her, he forces himself to take off his combat boots and his dirty clothes, while she takes off her robe, climbs back up and accommodates leaving a space for him .
His fingers are piercing the wood of the meeting table.
Janet re-directs the meeting and Tony has moved away from Thor completely, looking again at Janet, ignoring Steve again, in fact there are no more comments or flirting, it is as if she had closed in her mind again.
One of his hands stays there helping his tongue to give her pleasure, while his other hand stays on one of his thighs as if he were looking for the stability he needs to speak.
Nothing changes, they are friends, they are teammates, sometimes they are lovers and Steve accepts it, for once in his life, he accepts the inevitable.
-You're avoiding me- Steve says bluntly.
He runs home, away from the team, away from Tony.
He does not feel like discussing what he has done or why he has done it, so he remains mired in the rhythmic pounding that he is almost certain has synchronized with Tony's breathing rate.
-I'm fine- he barely speaks between his lips, because he doesn't know what to expect from all this and the anger is still latent.
And even so, he has been going crazy all night damn, with her gloating with each functionary and important person at the gala, where several dare to touch her bare skin, there are small touches that do not go unnoticed by Steve, who is now trying to proclaim every small space that was touched and desecrated with his mouth, in an attempt to mark every point on her body with a statement that Steve was there and every piece of skin has already been conquered by him.

Steve pulled off his helmet, straightening his shoulders and looking at Tony with hope blatantly exposed across his face. “Want to get dinner?”
,” Foggy enthused.
“I didn’t say that.”
Carol and Rhodey smiled at each other. They had a private conversation with their eyes, or maybe that was just Tony’s imagination, but soon enough Rhodey was lifting his pinky finger and pressing it to a very specific spot on Carol’s shoulder. Even through her shirt, their soulmarks reacted, hers glowing a spiraling mixture of silver, black, and red. His glowed a stunning gold alongside the more common red and blue. As their matching soulmarks reacted to each other, Tony forced himself not to look away. He was happy for his best friends. He really was.
Tony clapped Cassie on her shoulder. “I get it, but Wanda’s really worried about them.”
“There’s still a few boxes left,” Tony pointed out.
Matt leaned over to give Foggy the chance to do just that.
“Oh,” Steve said, feeling a bit like the wind went out of his sails. “Well, thanks anyway.”
Tony pat Steve’s arm. “Of course it’s safe. I wouldn’t chance that.” He shrugged. “There’s a difference between a suit being stable for flying and being combat-ready, that’s all I’m saying.”
Foggy also found himself blushing. “Then neither.”
Pepper smiled brightly and waved at the reporters as she walked back to the main door. She opened it, extending a hand for Spider-Man to enter. She walked in after him, ignoring the reporters pressing up against the gate.
“And what do you think about the detractors?”
“Of course. Shouldn’t be more than half an hour.”
A fifteen second clip plays of Steve letting go of Tony, Steve’s back turning, and Tony’s face showing off a new soulmark.
problems do you have?”
Tony rolled his eyes. The guy thought he was so freaking funny.
“So if I get an extra fifty subscribers, I’ll do a stream where I create an Iron Man mask and chest plate,
“Just tell him how you feel,” Bucky stated. “Communication will solve this.”
“What do you mean, anything?”
“Tony,” Steve whispered. “Hey, shellhead. We’re home.”
Tony immediately caught up, setting his suit to fly alongside him. “Hey, that wasn’t five minutes.”
[8:49 pm] Our mission went about as well as we could hope for.
Steve interrupted, concerned, “But doesn’t that usually mean the firm isn’t that great?”
Peter felt like the worst soulmate in the history of ever for forcing Johnny to keep this huge, important part of himself closed off from his family. But every time he thought he might be able to do it, to take that leap and reveal his identity to Johnny’s family, Aunt May’s face flashed in his head and his courage just shriveled up in the face of losing the last remaining member of his family. Spider-Man might be brave, but Peter Parker was just as much of a coward as he always had been, ever since he couldn’t confess his feelings to Gwen and MJ, didn’t want to confront Harry about his father’s mental illness and ensuing villainy, and allowed a thief to escape and kill his uncle because he was pissed off at a corner-store clerk.
Tony sucked in a breath. “Because, you know. You were a centerfold. In the forties.” He waved a hand. “In several magazines, to my understanding.”
“Or should I say hand-to… cheek? Because,
touching him? Am I that desperate?”
Reed spread his hands out in a peaceful, calming gesture. “Then explain it to us.” He smiled awkwardly. “We understand ‘complicated’, Johnny. We live ‘complicated’.”
Foggy took a quick gulp of his frap. “Yeah,” he blurbled. “Amazing!”
“Stevie, if you don’t go talk to him, I will tell Nat about this.”
“You were
Shaking his head, Bucky grabbed Steve’s elbow. “Listen, no, you know he does that when he’s stressed—” He cut himself off, pivoting to another point. “Or when he needs to think. You know how he is.”
, I can agree with.”
[__]  2     < >  1     <3
“Uh, you’re welcome,” Tony said, only about half-offended.
“They mean everything to me,” she said. “Take the damn shakes.”
Steve’s grin faded a bit. “Yeah,” he agreed, more solemnly than the joke called for. “Says that guy.”
Tony reached the abandoned lot with time to spare. He flew into the dilapidated building, looked around, and decided to set down in the middle of the main room.
A slow blush spread over Steve’s cheeks. Still, an easy smile fell over his face as he replied, “Sure. Anything you want.”
“Yep, yeah, New Yorkers get it. For those of you who, uh…
“Let them know we’re on our way, F.R.I.D.A.Y.” Tony dropped his tools and quickly strode to one of the suits he wasn’t working on. “Send an alert to Steve and whoever’s available.”
“Listen, superheroes are awesome. Gay superheroes are awesome. Or bi, or pan, or ace, or trans, or whatever! It’s just so great to get more LGBT rep in our beloved superhero teams!”
“No, Tony.”
“Sometimes. Not this time.” Jennifer shrugged. “These guys are idealists. Or at least, one of them is and the other goes along with it.”
Tony slapped his hands on his face. “
“One of the first major ones was when Professor Xavier and Magneto went public with their match. That brought up the ongoing debate of how to deal with a soulmate who espouses fundamentally opposing viewpoints to your own. Previously, there had been cases of soulmates who disagreed with each other on serious matters, but it was an incredibly rare occurrence for soulmates to go to extreme lengths. Domestic violence and divorce rates between soulmates have always been bottom of the barrel low, but Charles and Erik had been fighting very publically, very
“I don’t need to be a hero,” Castle replied.
Namor didn’t answer, instead choosing to throw himself into an armchair.
Tony shrugged. “I mean, he has a nice ass. That’s not my fault.”
. And he was. It filled him up from deep in his heart; an utter joy that he couldn’t control. He found himself smiling without realizing or thinking about it. He had even found himself humming as he walked here earlier. Humming! It was a lot to take in. Just being able to sit here and
“You’re late,” Pepper called from the car. “Now we have to rush. You know I hate rushing.”
Just… maybe not right away. He had been in the middle of working on upgrading his suit. Might as well go back to that.
“I was just thinking that,” Steve agreed. The waitress delivered their drinks, Steve thanked her, and, after she walked away, he smiled at Tony. “So. How are you, soulmate?”
“It’s about time,” Johnny said, shaking his head. “Feels like everyone was waiting for you guys to come out.”
An odd flicker caught Tony’s eye. He quickly finished the last three bots on the roof and flew over to investigate. A bot was projecting a shimmering hologram—of Iron Man flying into a car, intentionally smashing the windshield. The windshield almost got smashed in reality. A group of bots were hurtling towards it with a clear goal.
“How am I supposed to speak to her when she’s in space?” Pietro uncrossed his arms and jerked a finger into Tony’s armored chest. “This is your fault, Iron Man.”
“Makes sense.” Steve smiled. “Are you a present Christmas type of guy?”
“But I just told you I loved you,” Steve replied, staring at Tony, trying to understand. “And you waved me away.”
“I can’t. I already told you I can’t.”
“You’re beautiful.”
“Sure,” Tony agreed. “But they don’t deserve to die for it.”
Dr. Strange passed by, slowly shaking his head. “The energies of the universe are disappointed.”
“I wish,” Steve joked. “I just know you. Besides, you were thinking too loud.” He ran off in one direction, leaving Tony to go the other way.
Steve carefully let him down, holding onto his shoulder with one steady hand while he kept the helmet from falling on the floor with his other. “You fell asleep.”
There was an odd silence in the car. The heaviness from earlier came back with a vengeance, this time with a side of awkward confusion. Steve partially understood. Sometimes Tony laser-focused on a problem that appeared in front of him. A man shouting accusations and throwing a brick was not something any of them had expected this morning. He perfectly understood Tony’s concern—even if he really only wanted to talk about what being soulmates meant for them.
Matt grinned. “I won’t let you fall.”
, such an easy mistake to—”
Tony gently held onto Steve’s hand and brought it up close to his face, inspecting his own mark on Steve’s palm. The reds and yellows in it were bright and fast-moving, zig-zagging around in a way that made Steve dizzy when he stared at it too long. Which he might’ve done once or twice. There were occasional white-blue lines and small dots that accentuated the main two colors. It was an interesting mark. Unique in a lot of ways. Steve definitely hadn’t seen another mark that looked like it.
Jennifer was the only other person there. “Are you?” she asked, unimpressed.
A few seconds in front of the mirror calmed him down. He was Iron Man. People loved him, too. It was idiotic beyond belief to compare himself to some mystery person who Steve might never meet. They were best friends. That was enough.
“Finally,” Natasha groused.
“Okay, close enough.”
“Good, he says,” Foggy teased. “
“And a bunch of reporters blocked the car so we didn’t get to talk about it.”

Johnny took a deep breath. “I promise you. Sue, I
“Hey, guys! Welcome back to another night of defeating darkspawn, blood mages, and evil templars in Thedas. Before I get started, I got several messages from my followers asking if I was going to celebrate Captain America and Iron Man’s soulmate reveal. Uh, of course! It’s like you don’t know me at all!”
“Iron Man did not attack a civilian or store,” Pepper immediately said, speaking loudly and clearly. “We are looking into reviewing video footage of the fight to determine the true cause of this incident.”
“You’re thinking too loud.”
“But I don’t know why,” she replied, shaking her head. “If you could at least give a reason

Tony huffed out an extremely tired laugh. “I’m a billionaire, Steve. It’s burgers and milkshakes.”
Steve thought for a few brief moments before he shrugged. “People basically think the same thing they always have. Soulmates are the goal. Finding your match is what most people strive for. I don’t think that’s changed at all. As for what I think, I mean, isn’t it obvious?”
“Flying armor?”
“It’s more of a war zone than you know.”
“He left with Carol and Wanda,” Steve answered. “I think they were going to get Vision and then head to space.”
great [11:17 pm]
Clint grabbed two pieces. “Thanks, babe. You’re the best.”
Mornings weren’t Tony’s strongest suit. He had a deep-seated distrust of morning people, with the exception of Steve, who was the exception to every rule in Tony’s life. So when he was woken up by a video call, the very first thought he had was that a supervillain had finally found his ultimate weakness.
gift! And it would show Steve how fantastic and reliable I am!”
Bruce looked incredibly shifty. “I do. Usually.”
Bobbi elbowed her husband. “Shut up, I need to hear this.”
It quickly became apparent that Quicksilver had finally arrived when a flash of blue and white whizzed by them once, then a second time. “Where is she?” Pietro’s voice grew from a whisper to a near-shout as he stopped running, jerking to a stop in front of Tony.
Sam strode forward, heading into the building with Steve right behind him. Tony felt satisfied. It had been a good battle, overall. No major injuries, not much damage to property and city infrastructure, and everyone worked well together. They’d had worse fights—a lot worse. Tony looked at Pepper, ready to comment on their good deed for the day, but she was eyeing him critically.
His HUD showed it was 11:49 pm. “It’s almost midnight.”
“Iron Man!” A fist pounded from outside, slightly shaking the car. “How do you feel about having Captain America’s soulmark on your face!”
“No need for that! We’re all Avengers!” Cassie insisted. “Besides, now that you and Uncle Tony are together, I expect you to post cute pics online!”
“Yeah, we’re not—”

Tony turned around and held up a hand, attempting to stop Steve’s advance. “I want to talk about it,” he admitted. “I just don’t want to hurt you.”
“He’s gonna kill me,” Johnny muttered, sighing.
“Am I?” Steve asked, looking suspiciously over at him. “I’ll be on guard, then.”
“Fine,” Tony replied. He leaned against the counter and began eating. “Let’s hope they don’t have anyone running into their building.”
“The hypocrisy.” Bobbi sighed into the comms. “You never work. You’re just here to get everyone’s attention, give ‘em all a show.”
“Then why haven’t we met him?” Sue asked, confused and hurt. “Why haven’t
Tony opened a small slot on the side of his armor and took out a communicator. “Here,” he said, tossing it to Pietro, who caught it so quickly it didn’t even look like his hand moved. “It’s a high-functioning comm. You can use it to talk to Wanda. It’s an audio-only device, but it should be enough for now.”
“Are you calling that man a liar?”
A hand clapped on top of his knee. Steve blinked down and then looked over at Tony.
Tony’s shoulders sagged. “Yes. That’s it exactly.”
“Yes fair,” Carol replied. “This is for your own good.”
Steve quickly looked up at Tony, expecting a joke or maybe some critical judgment, but Tony was only calmly sipping at his milkshake. There was a moment where Steve considered it, but he shook his head. “Us old guys can look after ourselves.” He grinned. “Besides, I’m on a date.”
Sam moved his hand fruitlessly in the air. “I know! But people are looking for a story, Steve. And this.” He waved a hand between Steve and Tony, who were sitting across from each other. “This is a
“Oh!” Tony looked a bit happier. “About what?”
“You wound me, truly.” Tony let the blanket drop to his lap. Just to make a point. The arc reactor glowed a steady blue, something Tony was always aware of but didn’t pay much attention to. At least, not that often. “Where’s Wanda? Sleeping off the joy of having three soulmates?”
Namor lifted his chin, crossing his arms over his chest. “This fervor over secondhand copies will fade.”
Shaking his head, Steve reached out to hold Tony’s hand on the table. “Tony. Stop for a second. Neither of us is going to leave the Avengers. We’re still going to live together. We’re still teammates and partners. This is just another level to our relationship. One that it seems like we’ve both wanted for a long time.”
“Could it be Doom?” Steve asked, frowning. “Is there any chance?”
Tony smiled at him. “My hero.” He stood up, walking out of the room and to the elevator. “Sweet dreams, Cap.”
Steve peered at the man. No easy-to-spot soulmark. “Do you have a soulmate?”
“Wouldn’t dream of it, shellhead.” Steve returned his smile.
“You did us all a service today,” Sam states, trying to remain serious as a grin appears on his face. “And for that, I salute you.” He brings his hand up and gives a casual military salute.
“We all saw it happen live… except for those of us who don’t watch every single presser superheroes put out.
But he couldn’t seem to focus enough to finish the upgrades to his beam tech. Every time he saw his hands, he thought about looking at Steve’s hand—and his own mark permanently staying there. When he adjusted the gauntlets, occasionally he’d get an odd, distorted reflection of his face shining off the metal, and of course he couldn’t help but stare at the colors moving around on his cheek, constantly changing his appearance but always staying, just,
“You too,” Steve replied, smiling.
Matt walked up and laid a hand on Foggy’s shoulder. “Yeah, this is Foggy.”
Happy birthday, Steve! A new chapter to celebrate!
What he hadn’t counted in his equation was the unrivaled chivalry of Rhodey and Carol, who were both too nice for their own good. His two best friends reached out a hand to steady the witch, each of them grabbing on to one of her shoulders with a firm grip.
“He did. It was very annoying.” Namor sighed heavily.
“I love it.” Steve sounded incredibly sincere. He was glad that came across because he really did mean it, and it was important Tony knew.
“Um.”
“And, just to clarify, Tony is absolutely stunning,” Steve continued. “There really shouldn’t be any confusion about that.”
“It’s not,” Steve protested. “The fight yesterday, that was news. Even the brick today is newsworthy to an extent. People getting soulmarks is nice, sure. But it’s not
“As you can clearly see, Captain America and Iron Man are soulmates! Their soulmarks appeared where their skin touched. Although this raises questions, such as why the two have not discovered this previously and how this will affect their working relationship, the general public consensus regarding this revelation is positive.”
F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s voice filled his helmet as images and graphs popped up, alerting him to every possible angle of the situation in real time. “It seems Frank Castle is in pursuit of a criminal. Mid-forties, white male. Recently broke into a string of homes and stole valuables in the guise of installing home security.”
“Don’t care,” Castle huffed as he ran.
Steve dropped back down into the booth, craning his neck to watch the old man walk away. “It’s pretty late for a guy like him to be out walking alone.”
It wasn’t their fault he was fucking miserable.
Sue blinked at him.
Tony pressed his lips together. “Well, no; no, you didn’t. You kissed my suit.” He held up his hands. “And hey, I get it. It’s an impressive suit. I’m horny for it, too.”
Then Peter had grabbed his ear and Johnny had never felt so much like Reed in his
a very couple thing to do, sharing calendars.”
shes really mad [9:20 pm]
Pietro stepped back. Holding the communicator up between his thumb and forefinger, he nodded at Tony. “If this doesn’t work, I’ll be back.” Then he ran off, completely gone before Tony could formulate a response.
“No,” Tony quickly said. “Never.”
Steve turned around to stare at him. “Excuse me? You paid his bail.”
Pepper clapped her hands. “Okay! Cassie, I’m going out to answer a few questions. See if I can’t get some of the reporters to leave. Why don’t you shrink down and follow me out? You can still make it to school on time.”

A note on the audio: Apologies for the inconsistent sound quality on some chapters in the middle. You’ll know when you hear them. I did my best to clean up and amplify the audio on every chapter, but since this was my first podfic project, I was still experimenting with the mic and made some missteps in the initial recording of some chapters. I know better now, but those chapters are unfortunately not as high quality audio as most of the others. I still think they’re enjoyable because the story is fantastic no matter what, but just a heads up that there’s nothing wrong with your speakers or headphones; it’s just a few rough audio patches.

where I got the vast, vast majority of sound effects, plus all the music. I stuck mostly to TOS sounds because that’s the general era this fic is planted in, but occasionally dipped into other series sounds when I liked those better, because the fic is sort of at a transition point between TOS and TNG. I am not a purist so I didn’t overthink it too much, and everything definitely has that very iconic Trekky feel and sound.

I technically had the flu when I recorded this, and upon editing it yesterday and today, I discovered that clearly a little known symptom of the flu is a mysterious loss of ability to read or speak English. At least, that's how it felt cleaning this chapter up. I think I cut out all the worst takes and am satisfied with the final cut, but if there's anything you don't like about my narration here, I'm blaming it on the flu.

Part 4: Some Things Which Transcend Even the Discipline of the Service | Chapter 21
Part 6: To Boldly Go | Chapter 35
Did someone say TEAM BONDING?
It is the kind of man who remains as a private person, even if when he's the CEO of a company like Stark Industries and most of his life is in the public spotlight. He always seems to know how to stay on the sidelines, although Steve can fully understand, with curious  looks and the scrutiny he receives daily or at least has been since Steve come back from the ice.
-Captain I must inform you of a certain event that happened in your absence- there is a pause - One of the members of the Ultimate team has been in the hospital in the last three days-
Steve plays with the edge of the tiny lace panties Tony is wearing now and Tony can only say "please" in a small tone of supplication as if suddenly all the dirty and intelligent words that always come out of her lips had simply been forgotten or she just couldn't remember any to encourage him to stop playing and finally give her what she really wants, but Steve wants it to last and for once he wants to be the one who drives her crazy.
Everything is white noise and a tide in which he only navigates on autopilot, there is a question that comes out of his mouth as he start his way to the door - what hospital? -
She tells him that he has obligations to the team and that interpersonal relationships should not get in the way of team dynamics. Steve doesn't know if she is talking about his relationship with Tony or with Janet herself, only know that maybe she is right and he should at least return to the team's weekly meetings.
He is selfish and is being a fool, but for once in all these years he wants to cheat, so when the time comes and Reed and Tony have the portal ready, it does not stop, he talks about the whole thing for the first time since he arrived , tells young Tony the words he hopes will help him not to end up just right here, in the other side, an old man looking for his way to home. He wants to believe that Tony will say "no" when the time comes and his relationship with Steve will never turn into a vicious and painful cycle, the best lie tell to himself, look at the fluctuation in the portal, breathe and hope shines in his chest, it's something he has not fallen in a long time.
All of its qualities being in one way or another contrasted by some defects, quick thinking but unconscious when leaving the plan to gain ground putting herself in danger by trying to be reckless, intelligent but at the same time silly when judging a person, implacable but only she knew how to take that to the extreme being a danger even for herself.
There is a bright light that swallows everything and all the sound of the fight completely vanished in an instant and the only thought in Tony's mind was "This is it", the end of a life full of mistakes and successes, the Tony Stark's final. There really not many thoughts that led him to unconsciousness, but there was a person who tormented his last thought, Steve.
Steve does not know Tony Stark very well, for he is just the man who opened his house for a unique group of people and also allows them to have his bodyguard with them without asking for anything in return.
Steve does not approach the Stark mansion (which is now the headquarters of the Ultimates) until Janet cornered him after a mission to catch the remaining members of the Liberators.
Upon returning from a mission, he listens to Triskelion agents talk about her, there are not pretty things, Steve is contained, none of that matters, until one of them is proclaimed as the one who has left the marks she looks in recent days , the ones that Steve himself left on her skin and simply can not let it pass, in a boot Steve hits him, it is a somewhat soft blow, but that still leads the agent to fall to the ground unconscious, the other agents shut up and They look surprised while he leave the room to change for his civilian clothes without caring in the least what Fury has to say when he returns or even if this whole thing will bring him problems.
-You know that none of that matters, don't you? - she says while touching his arm and Steve just clenches his fists in response, she sighs again, looks tired but still raises her face towards him, looks at him as if looking to decipher what that even he has not been able to decipher in his thoughts.
She looks at him and nods.
Steve just looks at her with his backpack on his shoulder.
There is discomfort, nervousness in every little movement, but still security, she stays silent for a moment.
Tony leaves the mansion the next day, goes straight to the Baxter building and locks himself in the lab with Reed, Reed is always good, not only helps him find answers because Reed never eludes a challenge, he never ask questions, he doesn't make insubstantial talks, he doesn't force him to talk, concentrates completely on the problem in front of them and makes very good advances, until they get stuck, they are just tired, Reed offers him a guest room and Tony doesn't deny it, because he prefers stay here than go to the mansion.
He lets her feel how hard he is against the curve of her butt and kisses every part that is within reach, breathes her perfume and she whispers his name in a plea, which he ignores as she has ignored how much it bothers Steve that she wear this type of clothing, which reveals more than it should be right and that makes every damn man in the room look at her with desire, while Steve just wants to stamp each of them against the nearest wall.
Everything goes slowly, and for a moment he can almost say that he has begun to get used to all this, he have almost admitted that he no longer has the desire to return in time to recover his life.
He takes the first mission that Fury gives him, go and come back with a successful load of smugglers of little importance, ready to return to his routine.
Tony wait, although it had never been good waiting, he did, surely Steve would be on Reed looking for a way to take him home, it's stupid but there is Tony healing his wounds, trying to fix the armor as best he can with what he has and trying to think about what brought him to this place so he could make his way back.
His hand leaves his chest, returns to his path, goes down her side and begins to climb the "demure" dress that covers up to her feet to touch her, Tony seems to know what Steve wants to do or maybe he is responding to what she wants to, because she relaxes at the touch of his fingers to her skin, while on the road he is leaving her exposed, until he approaches her inner thighs and Tony's legs tremble as if he was already touching her.
She tries to look at him over her shoulder without much success, but he stands firm on her back, even joins her hands so that he can hold her like this with one hand, while the other runs up, touching her ribs to her breast and feels as her nipples harden under her hand, because of course with this damn dress Tony is not wearing anything  underneath, Tony squirms with a barely audible “Yes” under the moan that escapes from between her lips as his fingers play with her nipple and his mouth does not stop in search for the most sensitive points on her back.
Tony's fingers go up and touch his jaw, making him notice how much he's clenching his teeth. -There's nothing to protect Steve.-
- I don't remember asking you to avoid me like I was the plague - he growls.
She is sitting on the edge of her bed, with the sheets aside as if she was just getting up, she smiles at him with -Hello Darling- that just comes out gives him the strength to finally move.
The years pass and it's been so long that Tony loses hope, he doesn't even understand why he keeps trying, when in the end he always ends up in another universe that doesn't belong to him and still, he keeps doing it, running through the portal to the next universe, discarding statistics and creating new conjectures that can help him to be closer.
He close his eyes, he kiss her again and it's as if Steve were saying all those feelings that confuse him and make no sense to her.
He stays composed, takes all those feelings, puts them in a box deep inside his mind and encloses them there, staying out of the way, trying not to complicate all this further.
Nobody moves, as if Steve were a threat, almost as if they were waiting for Steve to become  Hulk, he will begin to break the whole enclosure and even eat the head of one of the members.
Tony clenches his eyes and touches the bridge of her nose, releases a sigh of resignation.
She doesn't take anything seriously, he can't help trying to live in a rigorous routine just broken by missions or by villains who don't have time to write their plans on Steve's well-structured calendar.
Every little part of him wants to follow her, but he knows he shouldn't do it, after all,What would be the use of following her?
Tony runs her hands down each side of his neck, plays with the hair at the base of his neck and the only certainty in Steve is that he wants her back in his routine.
She just touches his hair and repeats "I'm here honey, I'm with you" like a mantra.
Steve is approaching her at a slow pace, she also does not speak, just pour another drink again and this time she does not take it at once, just take a sip.
While she represented everything that had changed in this era and what could be the model for the future.
Upon entering he is received by various prying eyes and whispers that are not supposed to reach his ears, the whole damn complex knows it.
It is tight, it is hot and perfect.
Steve picks up his shirt, puts it on and puts everything in its place as best he can and when he turns back to her, she is looking at him, approaches him, gives him a small kiss at the corner of his lips, It's pretty… it's just Tony, with her pretty smile and for a moment it seems that he has made her happy, really happy and every little part of Steve feels floating, until she opens her mouth to make a “funny” comment about how he is getting debt to her because of the breaking of his panties.
Then it happens, it is his universe and the brilliant happiness spreads everywhere, it is perfect and he is so happy that he can't wait to see the team, to see Steve for the first time in all those years.
Tony moves away from his lips, in fact his whole body leans on the table and repeats "please" with a groan.
It is not a kiss that is meant to be carnal, it is a soft kiss.
The kiss scales quickly, most likely because of Steve's fault that he lets every word he is unable to say be silenced on Tony's lips.
It is ardent, it is completely sexual and it has all the characteristics that they write about Tony in the gossip columns, where it makes it seem that Steve has no experience and she develops to make all his fantasies come true, she is deceptively sincere, she is difficult to read more times that Steve would like, she doesn't ask for anything in return, she just gives herself to him and then everything is completely normal, as if the marks Steve leaves on her body were no more than moles that were always there.
There are words that Steve gets lost in the frenetism of reaching further to a point where he barely recognizes where she begins and where he ends.
-Sweetheart- she whispers calling his attention, touching his cheeks where tears are falling.
If he concentrates, he can even hear Tony's breath, which to his surprise stays silent, she has not even moved, there is no typical Tony behavior, no teasing, no assertive comments, no insistence she always has to when addressing an issue that is important, she is only there, behind him, looking at him as if she were waiting for him to discuss all this.
He doesn't know how long he has been doing this, it has been so much that even if he arrive in his own universe may be it will be like a entering a new one, he know it very well, because in all this adventure he has aged, he has acquired experience and now nothing will be as it was before.
Tony freezes by letting Thor go, who looks at them as if he was willing to take her in his arms and fly with her from the place, if Steve makes a false move, but Tony just nods.
He's tired, he's so jaded of everything that the simple thought of that behind this portal is his universe, his right time with all that he has missed, with his home ready to receive him, makes every little piece of him vibrate in emotion and a terror that melts inside the pit of his stomach, he's ready to go back, to see Steve and say "yes" to him once again, so it takes all his strength and courage to step inside the portal.
Steve reluctantly accepts it.
Although there is a universe where he falls and everything is like a dream come true, an utopia that plays with him and makes him hate not have been the lucky one to win the lottery in this vast multiverse, which makes him dream that if maybe he had been a better man and he would not have betrayed Steve maybe he would have this, a house to return after work with a husband who would give him a spectacular welcoming smile and a team behind him, maybe he would not have to count the days until the next catastrophe knocks on their door to choose the best option other than to betray Steve, maybe they wouldn't be destroyed, maybe they could have been happy.
-Are you okay Steve? - Janet is the one who speaks, looking at him with concern and Steve can only nod as he slowly drops the table.
He avoid staying more than a few hours in those universes where Steve exists, because it seems that if there is a Steve and a Tony they will always be magnets attracting each other and He certainly do not want to think too much about the implications of that.
And every part of Steve vibrates under her hands, as if something had broken inside his mind, he has all this need to tear its firmer edges, the need to protect her, to make her forget the bad, to make her happy.
All started with a clear change of smell, it was subtle, slow in a way that if Janet had not told him he would not have noticed, but after that he just could not help noticing every little sign.
The younger Tony takes a few days to finally appear in the Baxter building, but when he does he rolls up his expensive shirt and smiles ready to help them figure out how to send Tony back to his right time, Tony think send him back to his mansion and his Steve, but then he thinks things better, three minds are always better than two and he accepts and there comes a point where he even forgets that this other Tony he is working with is himself and there are only a age difference because this doesn't matter anymore.
Iron Man can even fly without using his wings, in fact the wings of Iron Man like everything in his body are covered with metal, his wings were not so big and even so Steve loved to see when Iron Man allowed himself to extend them, maybe Iron Man would have noticed it or maybe Iron Man did it without realizing it, showing up for Steve and making Steve feel completely disoriented and full of desires to take the hand of Iron Man, go out the nearest window to fly together and leave well in clear how much Steve admires him and wants to join him, to create a bond.
In search of answers? for What questions? if his mind is a jumble without meaning, he can't even answer what led him to have sex with her in the first place.
Watch as she stays a few more moments on the table and then also gets up, starting to accommodate her clothes.
Steve tries again and tries to convince him that he doesn’t care how he looks underneath the suit or what doesn’t allow Iron Man to show up to the others on the team, anything matter just them.
Steve's body is burning by letting go of her hands, taking off his clothes and letting her touch him everywhere, kissing him, but instead concentrating on making her moan and shudder in his arms.
He feels .. he doesn't know for sure, he runs his fingers through his messy hair..
Steve clings to his waist, while his lips kiss Tony's collar and collarbone.
- I'll catch up with you later - says Tony, recovering the joviality she had at the beginning of the meeting, Thor looks at them a few moments before agreeing.
Tony doesn't talk about the whole damn thing, but everyone on the team knows how much it affected her.
He buries his fingers in her short hair getting her closer, needing her because she can't leave him, because if she does he couldn't... because ... because damn he loves her.
"It is a quick mission" they tell him, but the mission is extended to about four days, it is not too much, but for once the mission time becomes eternal, he just wants to return to his routine.
Steve tries to calm down, but she keeps stinging, it's just frustrating and Steve just wants to shut her up at once, so he does, although not in the way he anticipates, Steve kisses her and it's not just any kind of kiss, Steve is looting Tony's mouth against the wall, there's not much in his mind, even less when Tony takes each of Steve's brain cells taking them directly to make a single function steal her breath.
-Miss Stark- He doesn't expect the impact that the response has on him.
His fingers begin to touch her seriously on the soft cloth, moving in circles, squeezing a little more just as Tony likes, she shivers and for a moment tries to release her hands from Steve's grip.
Steve can't stand whatever she thinks of him or the place he has decided to go to instead of Triskelion's well-stocked gym or even the one in the Stark mansion, so he just goes around it straight to the lockers .
Run, hit the box bag again, lift weights until the old gym manager says: - It's time to go home son.-
He enters his old apartment in Brooklyn, takes a shower and when he finally lies down on his bed he tells himself that the next morning everything will return to its usual course.
Maybe she got over him and found someone else to play with, maybe they just have to talk or maybe he should apologize, he will do it the next time.
-I just came to see how you were-.
Tony barely moves as if she was willing to run away from him at the first opportunity.
The pain in his limbs was not new, but the place where he was lying it was, there was nothing he could recognize.
That is why he has sitting at the table with the other members, on the other side of Tony, who does not even look at him or talk or do anything other than look at Janet and give a few points of view as to the strategy, she has a black business suit that fits well in every curve of her body and she is drinking the fourth glass of bourbon when they finish, she does not say goodbye, doesn't flirt, she simply leaves the room.
He think of his army battalion, all dead.
There is total silence.
Steve doesn't have an answer.
-What you want love- she says on his skin making him feel chills.
Steve feels disgust and hate himself because he should be the one who comforts her, the one who takes care of her, just a few hours ago she was in the hospital, she had been so weak, she could still feel weak and Steve is here, like a little boy, who need comfort.
In fact, it is refreshing to see New York while the helicopter descends to the Triskelion.
He tries to get close to her, touching her arm, but she hits him in the hand, stepping away from him, it seems that Tony's patience explodes because exasperation and discomfort radiate from her body.
They stay in that position for a few moments, Tony touches his hair and Steve stands still, listening to her heartbeat, as it slows down until it is a normal cadence and knows that it is time to go, kiss the place between his breasts before move away.
He touches every little space in her body trying to feel satiated, touching her as if it were the first time, as if he hadn't made that same journey in an attempt to memorize the way her body feels under his silk robes, the softness of her skin compared to the calluses of his fingers, clearing every scar and bruise that was ever made and faded over time.
-I was just doing my job- he argues.
He moves away from her lips and hands, so he can take off his uniform shirt.
-Then the words "you have to go", along with the missions that made you avoid the whole team, are signs of how much you love me around you-
Accelerate to the point where he pass several traffic lights and cause several cars to stop abruptly, but it does not matter, keep going until he is there, leave the motorcycle in the parking lot and when he arrives there is only one answer: she is no longer there, she went home.
-Well, chemo has not been a walk in the park darling- Tony smiled weakly, and touches Steve's hand.
He fly through the city until Iron Man stops him, it's an old armor and it could be Rhodey underneath, but it doesn't matter, because he's so happy, he's home, finally, after all this time he's home
And then all the pieces are connected, Steve just runs out of breath, there looking at him, it's not what he expected, it's not something he was prepared for, but still everything makes sense and Steve wants to be beaten for not having seen it before.
Janet knows, like everyone else.
He just goes quickly to the door of his new room and opens the door, freezing instantly when he sees her, Steve's heart goes fast, the adrenaline dies and every part of his body feels tense and sore waiting to see her fade in front of him.
And on the other hand Steve knows very well the best creation of Mr. Stark.
He stops, looks at her and for once, Tony seems to see through him as if she knew what is going on inside his head.
They don't talk about any of that, in fact it seems that all that event only happened in a crazy Steve´s fantasy, as if they just didn't think of the other one that way.
Tony is looking over his shoulder, with the same look he has seen so many times behind the helmet,
He spend a little time, there is no exit sound, just the typical sound of the gym, the sound of his hands hitting the bag, the sound of the treadmill while someone runs, someone's weights and the exhalation of the person who is using them.
He walk all the way to the old Archonis gym that he likes so much.
Every little piece of Steve's body tenses, he waited for an explosion, an endless number of her arguments and complaints asking why he did it, maybe a few insults and the anger that would only lead them to break whatever they have, because he is an obsessive and possessive asshole, she is a free woman who does not have to be accountable.
It's ... he can't ... he just keeps quiet, watching as she adjusts her robe again and smiles at him
- will be just me- he says because he wants her to be only his.
Antonia Stark breaks with all the conceptions Steve has about women.
They go down one by one, each agent ready to go straight to the showers.
They become friends again, they have strange comments between them, they become teammates again and they even become a better complement for the team, more synchronized, more efficient and hit bad guys hard.
-Get to bed with me darling- she says softly.
He close his eyes and start moving slowly, just in a cadence that feels good but only increases the need.
Awakening was a surprise, although it was not the first time that Tony had seen the end and still had returned.
He tries again and again, with time passing, becomes a routine, find someone who can help him to calibrate the device that opens portals that is already embedded to the rib cage of the armor and enters another universe.
He resigns.
Iron Man was completely different from his employer, vivacious, fun and the best friend that Steve had in all this new world, everything about him is incredible, the costume is something that even in the most incredible science fiction stories that Steve had read not even existed, it was not something that even he with a great imagination could have created, it is simply engineering carried to the highest level.
“I...I...doing that was new but I loved it very much Steve.”
“Now then, Steve, you look like you could use an upgrade,” Tony said as he eyed what remained of the suit. “Is that the same suit too?”
“She reminds me of my Ma already.” Steve said as he felt a tear slide down his face.
They stopped at a set of doors which Steve opened and led him and Tony inside and closed the doors behind them. The study had an atmosphere that felt cozy which was complemented with the fact that there was a fire place that was calmly burning in the background, a desk that had intricate designs in the wood with a cushy chair behind it, a number of bookshelves that were full of books, and a nice large window that was behind the desk. Steve walked over to sit in the chair and gestured for Tony to sit in his lap. Steve took out a piece of paper and brought over a fountain pen to start the list.
“Morning!” Anthony’s dad Howard said. “Looks just like our Stevie, eh? His owner’s a new guest, some good-looking young fellow with an accent. He’s in the pool right now. You okay?”
Steve, Natasha, and Sam were in Scotland at night moving from place to place quickly without being seen since they were wanted for violating the Sokovia Accords. Bucky was safe in Wakanda with T’Challa and Shuri working on removing the HYDRA programming from his mind so he didn’t have to fear being controlled again.
“It reminds me of when I look at you. Everything just seems to finally calm down and relax.”
After waking up in the morning, the pack continued on their journey to the east coast.
“You want to get a photo?” Steven asked with a smile.
“Stand your ground men, King Howard will not be an easy fight. He has one last chance to back down. If he refuses to stand down, fight and don’t hold back.” Steve spoke to his men.
“I had this dream not that long ago that we had a kid named Morgan. Why ‘Morgan’, I’m not sure. I mean, Pep has an eccentric uncle named Morgan, but I dunno, I guess I just like the name?”
“No King Steven, Anthony will be coming back and he’ll be married off.” Howard spoke, also angry.
Steve found himself on the day of their wedding in a side room off the lobby of the church. He was first in the entrance procession, and Tony was last, so he was waiting for the cue from Bucky that it was time to start. He did his best to keep calm as he looked at himself in the full-length mirror. He was in full dress uniform and had spent a lot of time the night before shining his shoes until he could see his reflection and polishing his medals until they gleamed. Steve clutched his Captain’s hat in his hands and didn’t know why he was so tense. He had faced world-ending threats, as well as being on the run from the government for years. But he and Tony had fought so hard to get here, he didn’t want anything screwing that up. At that moment, the door opened, interrupting his musings.
In the morning, Steve could feel someone licking his face which he guessed was Tony waking him up. When he sat up, Steve could see Tony wagging his tail with happiness in front of him and jumped off of the bed. After he got out of bed, Steve shifted into his wolf form and went outside with Tony following behind.
When the time came for their daughters to be born, Steve was with Tony every step of the way. He encouraged Tony throughout his labor and did his best to keep him calm. He was glad for the serum, which allowed Tony to squeeze Steve’s hand as hard as he wanted while he pushed, without risking hurting him. At the end of it, one child was placed in Tony’s arms and one in Steve’s. Both of them were in awe of what Tony had just done. Whether it was the Asgardian magic or not, Steve didn’t know, but they weren’t identical. The baby Tony held had big brown eyes and already had a full head of dark brown hair. “Hey Morgan,” Tony said, tired but happy.
“Hello, Anthony. Starting today, I’m going to be your new coach. You’re going to get to the Grand Prix Final. And you’re going to win.” Steven said with his Irish accent being prominent when he spoke and winking at Anthony.
A lot happened during the next year. In light of the battle against Thanos, Steve and the other rogue Avengers had been pardoned. There was arguing and apologies on both sides, and Steve and Tony talked a lot about the Accords, about Bucky, and everything that happened in the past few years. It was difficult, but both Steve and Tony knew it had to happen for them to move forward. They spent more than one evening in the beginning sleeping in separate rooms. But Tony never asked for the ring back or questioned wanting to marry Steve. Steve certainly didn’t question marrying Tony. They both knew they wanted this and were willing to work for it.
Hope you enjoy this chapter!
As soon as Tony ended Howard, everyone stared in shock and that gave Steve’s army renewed energy and the rest of King Howard’s army was slaughtered with ease.
“King Howard, I’m going to give you one warning and only one warning. Tony is not going to be yours to marry off to someone else that he did not consent to. Tony is his own being and can make choices for himself and you can’t change that. This will be your only warning Howard: Back away or there will be bloodshed.” Steve spoke with an angry tone and his eyes flashed red.
After they all clean up the dining room, the 4 wolves gather in the living room for some downtime after their meal. They seated themselves in chairs in a circle around a table and started playing a few card games like UNO & Cards Against Humanity.
It’s only been 15 minutes since Steve left and Tony is growing restless. He is scared of what could be happening to Steve right now.
Steve and Bucky were happy with their jobs. Working for the new police force gave them a way to use their protective instincts. It also had the added benefit of them being able to take in HYDRA sympathizers who just wanted to cause trouble.
“Welcome back home after five long years!” said the woman who held a banner with Anthony’s name on it.
by Hozier
After the news of his mate being pregnant sank in, Steve growled when anyone would get too close to him. His instincts were screaming at him to protect and defend his mate. It was very rare that Steve would leave Tony’s side. He only left if he was needed on a hunt, and even then he never took long and brought Tony all the best pieces of the kill. He wanted Tony and their pups to grow healthy and strong.
“What do you think the next season will hold for you?” A female reporter asked Steven.
Steve then guided Tony to the basement and into the weapons room. Immediately, Steve started to panic and rushed Tony over to a cupboard.
“If I may,” Thor butted in, “You, Tony, seem ideally suited for the task.”
“I said back off. If you can’t listen to basic instructions then that’s your own fault.” growled the golden Alpha as he looked back at Tony. Tony pushed himself further into the corner to keep himself safe. He just knew a fight was about to break out.
After they all make their way outside, Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy stripped down before shifting into their wolf forms. Rhodey, in his wolf form, was a charcoal grey color that was just stunning with how pure the color looked on him. Pepper, in her wolf form, has red and brown mixed to create a beautiful mix that looks perfect in the fall season. Finally Happy, in his wolf form, had a similar color scheme to Pepper but he was mostly brown with some red spots on his belly. All 3 of them turned around to see that Tony hadn’t shifted and they tilt their heads, seemingly in confusion of why Tony hadn’t shifted yet. All 3 of them walk up to him and rub their heads against his legs, seemingly signaling that they want him to shift.
“Huh? Lang?” As soon as he finds out, Anthony feels mortified that a video of him skating to Steven’s routine from the Grand Prix Final has gone viral on the internet.
“I do.” Anthony spoke while nodding.
Tony gave him a quick nod. “Cap,” He replied, giving a closed-off expression. It was the same kind of tone he used when they first met, back when they had been little more than work colleagues. Maybe that was all Tony thought of Steve now. “At least, I assume you’re Cap, underneath all that facial hair.” Tony’s eyes lingered on Steve’s beard, and there was a look in them that Steve couldn’t quite read. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought there was...a hunger there.
“I think one of the first things we should handle are the flowers.” Tony said as he held Steve’s free hand.
Anthony’s eyes snapped open and rose up. He watched as Steve walked in front of him and kneeled in front of him.
After they had their talk, Steve and Tony undressed for the night and got into bed, and fell asleep quickly with Steve having his arms around Tony.
“You see Tony, Omegas are only good for one thing. I’ve gotten word from the Stone pack that their Alpha son has come of age and is ready for a mate. I said that I would send him you. This way you are no longer my problem and you can retrieve us resources. It’s high time you take your place in this world.”
After a nice day of interacting with the citizens, Steve and Tony headed back to the castle. When they got back, Steve’s council was waiting for them and they looked worried except for Bucky who looked upset.
“Steve...we’re really going to have a baby.” Tony spoke as he had his hands resting on his stomach.
“Don’t you worry about anything Tony, we’re getting married tomorrow. So when King Howard comes to try to take you, he will see that you are my queen and that you will be bearing the heir to the throne.” Steve said softly as he stroked Tony’s cheek.
Steve walked Anthony out to the royal stables where a servant was tending to Steve’s horse.
“The thing is…” Anthony started off on.
“Well...the thing is that my father, or Sir as I ended up calling him, had arranged for me to be married to an Alpha from a different pack because he thought it was time that I had started being useful for once. In the middle of the night after he told me the news, I ran off so I wouldn’t have to go through a mating I didn’t have a voice in. I thought I was going to die in the snow but of course, you guys found me which is why I’m here right now.” said Tony as he looked around at the others at the dinner table. “I don’t know if my father is looking for me or not. But if I’m honest, he probably doesn’t care since he thought I was useless since I’m an Omega.”
“Now this may hurt for a little bit but I need some blood from Anthony to draw the symbols on his stomach. It will be pretty quick but I wanted to warn you about what is going to happen.” said the healer as he grabbed a sterile knife. “I need for you to take off your attire Queen.”
“Are you alright Tony? How come you’re not shifting back?” asked Steve as he sat up and looked at Tony who was still on the floor and in his wolf form.
“I’d love that, would like to get some fresh air after being cooped up in here,” said Pepper as she does some upper body stretching.
“Hey, Stark!” said a voice from behind Anthony which was Harold “Happy” Hogan, one of the announcers for the Grand Prix Final.
Shadows: This one’s a bit on the shorter side, but it’s full of sweetness. So… it’s like a cookie. ENJOY YOUR COOKIE!
Emmie: Here’s the 2nd chapter, hope you guys will enjoy it.
Fairly quick, the healer comes back with the things he needs and Steve is quick to hold Tony’s hand.
After the pack spent some time in Illinois, they advanced further on their journey before heading into the next state: Ohio.
Shadows: Hi guys!. Get ready for some surprises this chapter. It’s a fun one!
“What brings you here King Steve and Queen Anthony?” said the healer.
Well now Steve knew what that fight was about. “Actually I think it’s already here. We just fought off some aliens who were after Vision”
“Well luckily for you, I haven’t just been sitting around twiddling my thumbs,” Tony said as he hit a button and panel in the wall slid back, revealing a brand-new Captain America suit. “I assume it’ll fit, I didn’t exactly have your current measurements while designing it.”
“What are they anyways?”
“You asked for me, Sir?” Tony asked with his head down. As an Omega, he wasn’t allowed to look at an Alpha unless he was being directly talked to.
“Steve, I don’t want Howard to take me back.” Tony said while sobbing as he looked at Steve in the eyes.
Steve then leaned down to Tony and locked his lips with his. The kissing then got passionate before Steve pulled away a little before sliding his lips and tongue down Tony’s chest before coming to Tony’s penis and put it in his mouth and Tony started to moan...
“Fine,” Tony replied, not really responding to Steve. “Just get here as fast as you can.” And with that, Tony hung up.
As much as Tony wanted to keep his eyes closed, to just drift off and never wake up, something was calling to him. He blearily opened his eyes and saw a few blurry patches of brown, grey, and red reflecting off the snow. A deep howl cut through the air and it made Tony’s frozen ears twitch. He tried to focus as the figures got closer, but he found that he just couldn’t. Just trying to move was using too much energy. It was useless to try and answer. The figures were probably just hallucinations made up by his frost ridden mind.
“Thank you. I can get the saddle on her. You may leave.” Steve spoke which the servant nodded and left the room.
“Well, Tony...you won’t have to worry about your father trying to find you because we will protect you and you’ll be treated the same as how I treat Happy,” spoke Pepper as she stood from her chair and put her hands on the table.
“On to the most important part of the planning: what our attire will be. I have my tailors working on my attire which is a blouse along with a black waistcoat and pants. The buttons and ribbons on it will be red. Your dress is going to be black and wine red with a lace and corseted bodice with a square neckline. The veil will be long and lacy and have some embroidered flowers at the head and end. What do you think of your attire that I described to you?”
HERE THAR BE SMUT.

Thank you so much to everyone who has been listening along this whole time -- I’d love to hear what you thought of it! As always, emojis and keysmashes are 1000% acceptable comments :)
Today I was stuck in my office for a while so on a whim, I listened to the first chapter of this podfic and then the most recent one, and I was amazed at how much smoother I've gotten the sound quality and the narration since the beginning. Hopefully I'll only keep getting better.
And I'm hoping to do more one-shot podfics in the coming weeks, so if you're interested in that, you can subscribe to me. Happy Hanukkah and happy listening!
Part 4 has begun and so have the REAL PLOT SHENANIGANS.

It's also a very emotional chapter that required some SRS BSNS voice acting on my part, so I'm really excited for you guys to hear it but also a bit nervous. Hope you like it; let me know!

Thank you all for understanding!
Heads up: This chapter cuts off RIGHT BEFORE the smut hits. So if you're looking forward to the smut, I'm very sorry, it's totally worth it, but you're gonna have to wait another week.
