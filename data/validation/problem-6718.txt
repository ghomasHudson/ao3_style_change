Jessica let out a snort of a laugh but as the boy held his hands to the metal circle rim his eyes widened, head throbbing as images flashed before him.
Cap’sboot shifted in a circular motion, leg entirely following the motion as the skull masked mercenary surged forward. Steve caught the tip of his dirtied white boot with his leg, causing him to topple over. Their movements by this point were slow, lagged by fatigue, each motion more sluggish than the next. The heaviness of their clothing in the rain didn’t help; soaked garb making each move weigh like a tonne of bricks were tied to their limbs.
“You can’t be back you’re dead.” He growled, hating to say that out loud, the more he said it out loud the more real it all became.
Tony gave him a light nudge. “A white lie, Steve, since you’re a good guy… And I love spending time with you. Getting coffee with you, standing on the bridge after a mission, that’s what I call perfect.”
Steve’s eyes softened and he felt the small sigh of breath escape Tony’s mouth, though his words were truly touching, Tony felt actions spoke much louder than words and he knew Steve was the same when it came to matters of the heart.
“The others are insisting that I give you a proper scan, just give them peace of mind, will ya?” Tony pleaded, his attention caught by the black mark on Steve’s lower neck, peering at where the syringe had been planted.
“So what happens when you get caught by those spotlights? It’s like we’ve mindlessly been hiding since I saw them.”
To be quite honest, Tony had no idea what to do. He stared at the woman and knew it’d only be a matter of time before she broke free from the webbing using her powers. They were already starting to corrode at it. They didn’t have long, but the question was whether they had long enough for the genius to really examine what was wrong. That would involve having to remove her entire faceplate, which was much more troublesome than just an eye plate. He knelt down as Peter removed some of the webbing to reveal her face, she screamed at them, even louder without any obstruction before Peter quickly webbed her mouth shut.
Their pace picked up and they began to run, the helicopters gliding over but as soon as they did the two ran to a wall and sidled along it. It was an unspoken routine, and even with the memory lapse Steve knew that any form of spotlight was something to clearly avoid.
“It won’t take long; JARVIS can usually handle systems like this in a cinch!” Tony reassured him. “Trust me Steve; I want to get Reed back to safety as much as you want to.”
Steve snarled and reached around his back for his shield; now Tony knew he’d really found a sore spot and he was going to poke it until he’d gotten some answers. He couldn’t beat him on strength, that much was clear, so Tony would have to find some way to break him down. The armoured blond furrowed his eyebrows and lifted his shield, without ground to stand on he was fully reliant on his force.
“Go go Stark gum trap!” Tony ordered the car, rubbing his hands together to see his latest invention at work, but instead of gum shooting out to stick the cars down, actual gumballs popped out from the exhaust. Before he could say anything the road behind them was littered with rainbow coloured gumballs, the cars behind skidding and crashing off to the side after their tires were unable to keep a grip of the ball covered asphalt.
He wasn’t going to lie, he loved when Steve paid attention to him like that, and adored when Steve wanted to learn more about him. It seemed as though sometimes that he knew the ins and outs of Steve, and was far more interested in him than Steve was in him, but it was the moments like this that became more frequent as of recent that would prove to him that Steve was learning more about him too, as guarded as he saw himself as.
“So what now? What’s the plan Nick?” he asked, waggling his foot, now free of the brand by messy scratching.
“…” Tony took a moment to pout, jutting out his lower lip. “Whatever this is, if it involves insulting my sense of pride when it comes to project management, then you’re doing a great job.”
Slowly, the buzz saws pushed down, snarling and rattling viciously. They first ripped through Tony’s flesh, edges and splatters of blood decorating the blade tips as they circulated. He wanted to move, he wanted to pull away and scream out for someone to save him. His muscles twitched as though yearning to break free. Tears swelled in his eyes and his breathing hitched. All that he could do was hope that it wouldn’t work, but that hope and those internal prayers fell on deaf ears.
At that moment, he wanted nothing more than to embrace the man. With the realization he would lose him, he wouldn’t deny it anymore. He wanted Tony. He wanted to hold him, kiss him, be with him. He wanted to take back everything he said and did just to be able to see him smile again. He would change everything about himself if he could save his friend’s life.
ever so kindly gifted him with the ability to see once more…but the moment he’d been struck, Tony had known Matt Murdock was a lost cause.
“I wasn’t sure it’d work, but it has, so now I know how to do it,” he brushed away the bead of sweat that was just by his temple with his forearm casually.
as possible. The longer we keep him here, the less likely he’ll cooperate with us.” There was an air of professionalism about his manner but that was mainly an excuse, he just didn’t want Steve to be subjected to tests any longer than he should be.
“Take it off…” Tony whispered, only for Steve to obey, letting the blue shirt slip down his shoulders. Huge muscle bound arms, just as he expected, just as he’d seen and felt, the same arms that would deliver those distinctive bone crushing hugs that Tony adored. He loved those arms, there were no words to describe how much so.
When he finally reached the door, he knocked hard on the thick wood and cleared his throat for good measure, keeping his cap tucked neatly under his arm.
“I want to Steve… Really I do.” Tony’s blue eyes sparkled with sadness, looking up at him with a pleading face, his fingertips once more curling into the shirt of the man before him.
Tony pointed to a tiny metal pin tracker that was resting on his table. “Pretty convenient, trackers. Doom had one on me, I didn’t realise until JARVIS had done a scan on me when we got back and the lab was a mess. I reverse engineered it to see where exactly the signal was being transmitted to, and now I’ve got a handy dandy location! The track-ee has become the tracker!”
“No, I’m pretty sure. The Commandos took the lead on that mission, they did the hard work and I finished the agents off, made sure the area was clear and we went and defused a huge bomb that was lodged to blow up the city where most of our bases were newly being set up.”
“I, well, technically my bots had the life knocked out of them, but they’re coming to now, thankfully.” Tony inhaled a breath, his body still tingling from that tight embrace. “Reed’s been kidnapped.”
“You wish, Richards,” The voice boomed, brushing back his huge emerald green cape. He laughed and paced Tony’s lab, striding triumphantly around Reed, who was tied up on one of Tony’s work-chairs tightly with barb restraints, piercing his skin. Even with an inch of a motion Reed winced with pain.
The more Tony thought about it, the more it seemed plausible. Saving them would be easy. He just had to swoop in. It was a hell of a lot easier than what Marty McFly had to do…
James ducked his head to hide a smile she couldn’t have seen in the dark any ways. He bent down and apologetically kissed the bullet wound and then trailed kisses lower down her waist to the most sensitive part of her body. Natasha shuddered and her nails dug into his scalp.
Bucky rolled his eyes and murmured, “I’m heard enough of their fucking in one lifetime. I don’t need to hear no more if I can help it.”
How come they’d been allowed to dream with each other all of these years and now…now nothing. Steve was ripped from him without any warning.
“No, it’s not you,” Tony vehemently stated. “It’s me! It’s all me! I was planning on changing something to-to make your future better…”
Steve smirked at his boyfriend and whispered, “Wait, stay with me a while. We haven’t been alone since…well since-.”
, was Peter’s immediate thought. He wanted to work with his shield again. The dark mass was practically calling to him.
She was just about to propel herself over the top edge of a brownstone when the Winter Soldier suddenly loomed over her and his shadow cast darkness over her. Her only options were to jump or climb into the Soldier’s range of attack.
“Aw, I’m sorry, Petey,” Wade murmured. “I lost my own girl a while back. We were going to get married and everything…but…but, I know the feeling…” Wade tapped his chest with his fist and whispered, “It stays with you.”
Steve stumbled to his feet and weakly grasped the handle. Natasha grimly noted the cold room was keeping him weak. He’d only been out of it for a few minutes and whatever healing that might have occurred was probably destroyed by his reentering the cold room. He could barely stand nonetheless help her. He gasped, “Bucky-?”
Tony pointed to the moon and whispered, “Don’t tell anyone, but we will walk on the moon in another twenty or so years.”
Because he knew he woke up because he’d been so shocked and alarmed by the sudden darkness and that darkness was probably still waiting for him.
Tony dragged Bruce to the mansion’s labs and it took them less than an hour to make an explosion large enough to shake the building. The rest of the team came running but, instead of finding destruction, they found Tony and Bruce piled together on the floor laughing.
A light flush stained Steve’s cheeks and he leaned back into Tony’s side and countered, “You always look great.”
Tony double checked the tracker he put on Steve’s shield and saw he was indeed at HQ. So he flew right up to the glass doors of the Triskelion and ignored all of the warnings SHIELD relayed to him about his flight pattern. He was met by a dozen angry agents. He nodded to them and said, “I hear you have my boss here. He’s tall, blond, and in his nineties, probably here about social security benefits.”
Bucky’s gaze went from Peter then to Steve, his expression was unreadable. When Tony came to Steve’s side, something flickered in Bucky’s gaze and he smiled ruefully at all three of them. Bucky sarcastically stated, “I told you kissing her was a stupid idea.”
“You’ll overhear a lot,” she interrupted him. The bartender brought over the drink and she accepted it with a nod. She waited until the man walked away and asked, “What was it?”
Steve would just shake his head and would allude the question by answering truthfully, “I don't know…”
Last night, he slept restlessly as fragmented memories of Natasha invaded his usually dreamless sleep.
“Okay, that proves it,” Tony stated, landing next to Steve. “Our Captain never curses…” Tony leaned close to Steve and privately whispered, “Except when I touch him just
“Give him another hour, if he isn’t home by then, I’ll be right next to you in searching the city,” Steve said, wrapping an arm around Tony.
“You’re practically glaring holes into Stevie there. Did you two get into a disagreement while hunkered down in your hole?”
After a pause, Tony tipped Steven’s face toward him to study but Tony found himself being wrenched back instead.
“Us?” Steve repeated, straightening up and returning his hand to his side. Tony’s fingertips slid off his chest from the sudden movement.
He peered down at the discarded clothing on the floor and became flustered thinking about lifting his gaze any higher. Images of Tony standing under the water ran through his mind: Tony’s hands in his damp hair and water running down his torso, following the contours of his body leading down to—.
“One,” she stated, ignoring Stark and holding up one finger. “You will tell me your name. And two, you will tell me mine. If you still want to kill me after remembering both then you are welcome to.”
“Steve…” Tony began, his voice already defeated. He lightly rubbed the back of Steve’s hand with his thumb, trying to wordlessly comfort him from the action.
Peter shut the door to his room with a heavy sigh. His entire body ached and he had a shallow cut on his forehead which had finally stopped bleeding.
Peter was baptized and held by Steve as the water was run over his head. He frowned at Steve the entire time but did not cry because he was promised ice cream if he behaved. Steve had to hold back his laughter as he watched his son take the situation so seriously.
Steve’s flush expanded to cover his entire face and he murmured, “Yeah…I-Well I found a paint app on here…” He motioned to his tablet.
His heart clenched painfully as he remembered his last promises had been made to Peter. He promised Peter he would save him, would he break his promise to Tony as well?
Steve heard him but couldn’t reply at that point. He could only breathe, hold Tony, and experience all of his nerves come alive in a torturous agony.
Pepper twisted in the arc reactor and grasped his shoulder, asking, “Are you alright? What more can I do?”
“Captain Rogers is giving his report on the incident,” one of the agents explained gruffly. “If you will just check in, and maybe answer a few questions as well, then we can bring you to him once he is done.”
His son coming into the world reminded him his time table was closing and SHIELD was the obvious choice to drop.
“I would hug you if I probably wasn’t going to pop some stitches and bleed out just from standing…” Peter stated as soon as Wade was out of the room. Tony looked to his son and saw he was smiling just as brightly as Wade had been. Peter asked in a husky voice, “Did you mean it?”
Both women blushed and they fumbled with the visitor badges. One of them finally managed and held the two plastic card out to them and said, “Have a good day.”
no, just – just forget I said that – I can’t think straight – Steve – I’m so sorry, please –! I didn't mean it! Please!”
He got madder as he saw the faulty work done within. They connected his arm to his nerves and Bucky must had been in constant pain.
So, of course, when they’re about to go to bed they had to make love one more time and then promptly collapsed with exhaustion.
Tony looked up at Steve with large, wet eyes that broke his heart with the amount of pain within them. Steve carefully shifted onto his side and pulled Tony into his embrace. Steve couldn’t even begin to imagine finding Tony on the verge of death. He promised, “I’ll never leave you like that, Tony…”
this was impossible. But the girl spun a convincing tale and had “evidence.” In addition, it was juicy and appalling enough to make the media turn on Steve in a heartbeat.
Tony could not turn around and meet his eyes. He knew if he saw the painful truth in that blue gaze he would crumble. His armor was on in in less than a minute and he did not turn for a quick kiss like he usually did. His face shield dropped and he opened a private line with Jarvis. He commanded his AI to open the balcony doors and when they opened, Tony blasted out of the room without looking back at Steve.
Tony caught that hand and gently kissed it. He brought Steve back to the present as he whispered, “I missed you so much, beloved…”
Steve continued to stare at his friend and did not have the strength to reply to his name. The emotional turnover of having Peter in his arms then torn away was so draining that he barely had the strength to move.
Steve kept kissing him though, pressing kisses into his lips, his cheeks, his jaw, his forehead, and the like. He never wanted to stop kissing him. After all of those years of denying this, he wanted to make up for their lost time.
When Steve had caught a glimpse of the shadow behind the glass he stood and stepped once more to the window pane. “Tony, I’m sorry, I don’t know what happened, I really don’t… I…” He clutched his stomach. “I’m so hungry…”
Walking further, he spotted the bloodstain that was just on the edge of the alley that he passed by. That was it; that was the benchmark he was looking for, although it was one that made his heart hurt, being reminded of the peril that Jessica had gone through before they had to bury her. But from there he could trace his footsteps toward the shadowed part of the city again, it was reassuring to know at least he was close. He had to stop just for a moment and catch his breath, placing Steve down against the wall, ensuring that he was nowhere near the dried puddle of blood.  The man was placed down, slumping with his head hung, still muttering words over and over on loop.
Steve lurched forward and pulled Tony closer, staring into his eyes in a beseeching manner, as though he were imploring him for some sort of joke as the dull drone in his chest became progressively louder and much more painful.
This was his dream, on the other side of that mirror. Tony cleared his throat. “You know I helped create Ultron, correct? I helped create what made you who you are in your world.”
The person that he shoved turned around, pivoting on a foot in a demon like fashion with eyes widened, holding up a wrench was surely augmented, and a small pipe just above the forearm rose.
The room darkened as the power was sapped out of it. Carol from above along with Thor had managed to dismantle the lightening rod that was providing the power to the building, so now they stood with just Steve and Tony in the dark lab, with their eyes glowing a faint shade of blue.
“Yeowch!” Tony wailed, shaking his head and then reaching one of his hands into his pockets. “Now I know I had it somewhere…”
“Heroes are threats, they must be destroyed,” she spoke, shooting a blast of fire at Tony. He ran as fast as he could away, only to look over his shoulder once he had managed to get a fair distance away and noticing that the person had just gone back to their routine, their walking pattern, as though nothing had happened. He had to catch his breath just for a second, having run with that heavy weight in his arms.
“You see, Stark.” This was going to be the start of a long villainous lecture, Steve could feel it. He had always wondered what it was with bad guys and revealing their entire life story. “After the accident I was transported home, where I was seen by the best doctors of my country, magicians, you might say.”
“Ah, Tony!” A voice yelled from the other side of the room. Steve’s eyes followed it curiously only to see long arms stretching up and waving from across the room, now Steve had thought he’d seen everything with Tony – it looked as though this guy’s limbs were actually stretching, but Steve pegged it down to tech similar to Tony’s. Eventually he revealed himself from behind a huge chalkboard, walking up to Tony with his arm returning to its regular length, but unlike Tony Steve couldn’t spot any coils or hear a retraction mechanism.
love the rugged look, it’s sexy. But I can’t have you outshining me, Colonel… Not that you have much of a chance with this personalised chrome finish, but…” He chuckled, more for his own benefit than anything else. “Next.”
“Yeah, Tony’s great to have as my partner, I’ve never been so glad to have someone with his smarts and initiative around.” Steve patted Tony’s back heartily, almost making Tony’s hat fall off, which he quickly caught and placed back on top of his head proudly, glancing back at Steve with a soft smile of gratitude.
It had taken much longer than he intended. By the time he was out of the bathroom, fully dressed and groomed he managed to steal a peak of the fallen clock.
“It doesn’t make sense, Steve.” He said softly, staring up at him as Steve stepped closer and returned to wrapping his arms around him, now with his wings too covering the both of them.  “I… Always thought you were something else, I mean, heh, no one can be
He didn’t pull back. He didn’t want to pull back. Soft lips accompanied by the strong waft of cologne and elbow grease combined to form an extremely alluring moment, mesmerising even. He could feel every ounce of desperation and emotion poured into that one touch of lips, and that alone made the spark in his heart brighten and burst into flame.
Tony craned his entire body closer, leaning and watching the left hand, still attached to some of the wiring, move. His vision darted up to Steve’s face, seeing his eyes scrunch up, brow attempting to pinch, a weak movement from the corner of his perfectly shaped lips.
“Have any of you learned anything new about the person who hired the Chameleon or the break in at the Tower?” Bruce questioned as he buttered his roll. He was the team’s lone vegetarian and had piled a tall salad and a number of carrots onto his plate.
“Or maybe we’ll both be reborn and this time we will actually find each other in the real world,” Steve whispered.
Eddie shuffled the reports at his desk and peeked at Peter from the corner of his eyes and asked, “We cool?”
Every touch elicited noises from Steve that would have embarrassed him had he been in his right mind.
Tony flew toward him without any second thoughts and did not even hear Steve’s warning hiss in his ear as he exclaimed, “
Yet Peter was gone in a matter of seconds and Venom’s face appeared. The beast rose to its feet and repeated victoriously, “We
She soon found herself watching the man for no reason other than just to watch him to try and understand him. Why hadn’t he done anything? What was his motive?
Pepper led the way as he and Steve followed, holding each other’s hands. Both of them were jittery with nerves and excitement. They only let go of each other when they were both pulled aside to be outfitted with microphones and the connecting battery packs that hooked onto the back of their belts under their jackets.
“Peter, don’t overthink it, over time we’ll try out all different ways we can make love,” Wade retorted and Peter nodded. Wade became tongue tied for a second because holy Taco Tuesday Peter just nodded so this wasn’t going to be a onetime thing. He wanted to make love with Wade
He dug his fingers into Steve's blond hair and pushed him downward, encouraging Steve to go down further to where his already hard cock was waiting for him. He rubbed his arousal against Steve’s leg to further get his point across.
“We…We’ll just have to be extra careful and…and we probably shouldn’t see each other alone anymore…” Steve suggested even though it was the last thing he wanted.
He could trust Wade. The man already knew his deepest secret, that he was Spider-Man. And he knew without a doubt the man would treat him the same. He may squeal a little about him being the son of his “number two OTP” but, that’s just be Wade acting like his usual goofy self. That would be Wade just treating him like plain-old-Peter, not the Stark son.
“Sir, you must put a compress on your chest now. If you do not, you will suffocate within the next ten to twenty minutes,” Jarvis replied sharply.
He strolled onto the beach, his eyes riveted on the faraway mansion, as he finished the last of his drink. Behind him, the bomb went off and a burst of heat hit him as the café was destroyed in an inferno of flames. People on the beach screamed and leapt away. Their eyes were all drawn to the explosion, but Norman didn’t turn around to see the destruction. He dropped the mug into the sand and started his walk toward the mansion.
Steve was wearing his workout gear of black sweatpants and a loose white tank. He must have already done his run. He held a mug of coffee in one hand and a plate of eggs in the other.
Tears blurred his vision and he remembered Tony’s lamentations about Happy. Steve stated what Tony had, his voice came out in a squeak, “He’s a fighter. He can’t go out like this.”
Wade scrambled to his feet looking scared of him. Tony kept moving forward and did not stop until he collected the larger man into his embrace. Wade was stiff in his hold, like he didn’t know what to do, and Tony stated, “Save him. Save our Peter.”
with the technology of that era? It took Tony huge amounts of materials, space, and energy to create a small amount! If Tony could figure out the formula he could probably make enough to cover his armor and be completely indestructible.
“Some big stuff is going to go down in the main hall,” Peter replied, “Want to join me in watching?”
Tony removed his arc reactor again and applied the baking powder to the ruined chip. He then scrubbed it off with a wire scrub brush from his tool kit and was able to remove most of the rust from it. But the chip itself was extremely degraded and it didn’t look like it would survive another baking powder washing.
The train was going faster than the ones in his era, probably to deter any train hoppers, but Steve was able to jump on with no problem. He’d aimed for the open spot between cars and sat down on the joint connecting them. The ride was relatively smooth compared to the rides he was used to hopping in his era.
Peter sighed heavily and turned back to face the screen. Wade ran his fingers through his hair and murmured, “We don’t have to watch it if you don’t want to…”
They shared a few minutes of silence and Steve could half pretend that the last few years did not happen. He could pretend that Bucky was sane, Tony had yet to be born, and he was not internationally known and no one was sneaking quick pictures of them.
Cable wasn’t much of a talker and wordlessly hunched over the reactor, immediately getting to work putting it back together.
He had no idea how he was going to tell May that Peter was missing and had been taken by an alien symbiote which had nearly killed
“Thank God!” Tony gasped. He grabbed Steve’s arm and said, “Let’s go get some coffee or I am going to fall asleep by the time they call mistrial and there is
“Waited so long,” Tony panted as Steve tentatively first touched him. He let out a hiss of repressed breath as Steve’s fingers slowly trailed down his shaft. Steve watched Tony’s face. He was enthralled by the lust and love that warred in his expressions. But, when Tony caught his eyes, he held his gaze and love burned through it all. So much so, Steve was positive his expression did the same thing because Tony chuckled and whispered, “You’re amazing.”
Steve reached out to Tony but the love of his life collapsed, slipping from his grasp as limp and lifeless as a doll. Tony was silent as he fell, ramrod straight and made no move to stop his plummet. He landed severely on his front with a horrific thump.
Bucky frowned and grabbed Steve’s arm and admonished, “Hey! Don’t forget about my ticker! I got Grade A genes and a healthy appetite for the female body! Yet, I’m still never going to meet my perfect girl…” Bucky looked down, his face softening into a sadder expression to match his internal feelings, and whispered, “We were just dealt an unlucky hand in an unfair world, Stevie…There’s nothing wrong with me or you…Other than the fact that you can be irritating thorn in my side at times.”
“I hope so,” Tony replied and carefully stood, weary of his sensitive cock. He turned back to Steve with a smirk and said, “I hope they good quality too because I am so going to use them to masturbate to.”
He couldn’t do anything for Peter but, in this situation, he was utterly useless. All he could try to do would be to rip that thing from him but Banner had warned doing such a thing may be catastrophic. The symbiote had tried to strangle Peter for him merely thinking of getting rid of it. They had no idea what it would do if they actually tried it.
“Alright, here we go,” Eddie said and dropped his stockpile of projectiles on a nearby counter. He picked up his first choice, the textbook Peter had just been reading, and threw it at Peter.
actual Steve Rogers. As in Captain America, my platonic, back-from-the-dead friend who is in no way in a romantic relationship with me. Steve this is Pepper, a person I actually was once in a romantic relationship with because for my entire life I’ve dated women and only women so I don’t know why one of those said women would immediately assume I’m banging some dude... Oh, and if you call her Ms. Potts, like Jarvis does, she will poke out your eye.” Tony grinned cheekily at Pepper but the woman was staring at Steve with a critical eye. She still did not believe Tony’s explanation. Tony sighed and asked Steve, “Can we show her the shield? I don’t think she’ll believe me until she sees it.”
…But the feeling did not go away and he could not deny that it was there. That familiar feeling, that attraction that he had smothered towards Bucky, was still there and it could be stronger than the one he felt for Tony…
“We raised a mini you,” Tony whispered into Steve’s ear and four golden arachnid limbs rose out of the back of Peter’s suit.
Steve curled into Bucky’s body and held him close. Bucky kissed the top of his head but made no motions to go any further. He held Steve until he was able to contain the pain. He did not completely loose it like the night prior and was able to oppress it after several minutes.
Stark was still staring at the target, refusing to look at his implant. His arm shook and tears welled in his eyes.
you should not tear something up just because it is not alive! Be sure to ask me before you do something like this again, okay?”
Norman was laughing uncontrollably as he watched the SHIELD agents try and fail to stop him. Alone, Norman would have eventually been captured but Norman was not fighting alone.
Tony taped a fresh ice packet on his shoulder and the cold sank into his aching joint with a welcome relief. It had hurt something fierce since he fell on the Cobra but now it was throbbing after he wildly moved around to try to catch the hippie intruder. The Shelby Cobra was still an untouched ruin since both he and the stranger fell on it, but DUM-E took the initiative to spray it twice with the fire extinguisher within the last hour, so Tony knew it was in good hands.
Steve looked incredulously at the man then peered down at the injured man he was helping. An entire block had been destroyed by a monster from another dimension and this reporter wanted to clarify
“I can help, Tony,” Steve whispered. “I understand if you don’t want me there for you but as Captain America…”
Bucky slowly reached for the food with his free hand and then selected one slice of toast. He nibbled on it as Tony finished up on his shoulder.
She crossed her legs and said, “I know your mission is to kill me and I will help you if you tell me two things.”
put someone in that position. Thank you. If you have any questions please direct them to Ms. Potts.”
Steve expected Tony to reply via Jarvis, instead, the billionaire called Steve’s cell phone not a moment later. The phone vibrated in his pocket and Steve grinned upon feeling the sensation. He smiled warmly at Tony’s name on the screen then answered it.
The others noted his deposition, the horror of the situation was weighing him down, and it was decided that Wade was to be given the less laborious task of being the messenger. Wade didn’t blame them…but he wished he didn’t have to bring this to May either…
“Your presence is all I need,” Steve whispered. He crossed the room and hugged Bucky. Bucky stood stiffly in his arms then rigidly wrapped his arms around him.
Steve tightened his fist, unconsciously trying to grip the strap to his shield tighter. The strap was gone due to the new magnetic connectors and he felt a little uneasy without the familiar hold.
He tried to smile reassuringly at the camera, knowing everyone must be freaking out, but the gas potency was too strong for him and he was pulled back into the darkness. His smile faded with his vision and he wondered if he'd ever wake again.
Tony paused and then gulped thickly as his gaze finally flickered away for a second. He smiled at Steve and then retorted, “You would change your tune if you ever saw me without coffee. I am a grouch if I’m denied my caffeine fix!”
“I’m sorry I didn’t go after you,” Steve whispered suddenly. James glanced up at Steve but his friend was looking down at his lap. The smile Steve had been wearing when he first saw him was gone and his mouth was a hard, solid line.
“He did risk the future for his boyfriend, sounds like another brave time traveler I know,” Steve teased, lightly bumping Tony’s side with his elbow.
Wade sighed, dropping my head, and murmured, “You’ve saw me in Chapter Three, Pete. I ain’t pretty.” He pointed at his mask and declared, “This mask…it’s gorgeous, a work of art, but the face beneath looks like the remains of Picasso’s paint palette.”
Logan was sitting on top of Wade’s dresser, smoking one of his trademark cigars. He held up his hand to block his view of them and grumbled, “I’ve already seen too much. Hell, I've smelt too much, so
Tony groaned, “I would have left you the first night had I known that…and we don’t know if that’s the case!”
“Well, alright, let’s get right down to it then. You are no longer going to kill for Hydra. You are going to be your own person now. You’re going to be Bucky Barnes again,” Tony commanded.
“If it’s a competition then Stepan will win obviously,” Natasha replied, smoothing a hand over her round stomach. Bucky smirked at his wife, his dark eyes twinkling with mirth. Natasha smiled wilily back.
“Yah!” Peter exclaimed. Steve went to step away but Tony’s hand stayed on his arm and he tightened his hold on him when he went to pull away. Steve looked to Tony uncertainly.
The blurry world shifted as he was raised into the air and then it all began to bounce as he was carried away.
“The future has already fucking changed, J!” Tony exclaimed with a hysterical edge to his voice. “Play the rest of the conversation! I want to hear it in its entirety!”
So, yes, Tony was jealous but he prayed Steve would never have to experience what he had to. Tony had long since learned to let it roll off him but he doubted Steve could easily do the same.
Tony went through the door and began to move forward. Steve caught up to him and they wordlessly fell in step. Tony bumped into Steve’s side as they walked and Steve leaned into it with their hands occasionally brushing.
“Nothing is going to happen, Tony,” Steve sighed. “I know I messed up in the past but losing you changed that. I am not going to lose you again.”
Wade lived in a part of town Peter had only been to in his Spidey uniform. It was a tougher part of town where crime rates were higher and no one questioned the fact that their neighbor made a living as a mercenary. Everyone minded their own business and paparazzi never came down there.
just died, pal. There's no politics here, it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon. It's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10880 Malibu Point, 90265. I'll leave the door unlocked. That's what you wanted, right?”
Everyone turned to the forgotten Winter Soldier. Barnes was standing right where they left him but he now wore a resolute expression.
Tony’s attention, however, was not on himself, it was still on Peter. Wade was still holding onto him despite the vicious attack the symbiote was pelting him with.
Despite his protest, Steve was placed on the President’s detail after being scolded by a very unhappy Coulson.
“I think I’ll make my exit now then,” Pepper said and nodded to Natasha and said, “It’s good to see you again.”
Steve started to tremble and he tried to hold back his tears and be brave for Peter but failed. Peter’s face was inches from his as the tears began to fall down his face and his breath began to hitch in his throat.
Steve caressed the side of his neck and murmured, “Maybe here…I think you rested your head here and left behind some dirt.” Tony smirked at his jibe and Steve trailed his hands down lower. He slowly ran his fingers over the contours of his abdomen, just beneath his navel, tracing where Tony touched him earlier, and murmured, “Or maybe here…I think you left a few handprints when you touched me…”
He only had a month until he’d finally meet his mate. Years ago, he resented the coming date but, now, he was ecstatic.
of his suits. The suit needed to be charged at least once a day and it was really starting to get in the way. What was he going to do when they moved out? How was he going to charge his suit in the middle of the 107th without anyone noticing?
“I-I don’t know. I was just thinking that I needed to find a way for it to go back to the beaker and then…” Peter waved at the beaker, wordlessly stating the obvious.
Their mouths broke apart and they shared breathless gasps. Tony looked over his shoulder and grinned ecstatically at their friend. He could only imagine how happy and debouched he looked. His lips felt puffy and wet and Steve had run his hands through his hair so it had to look mussed.
Peter last communicated he was swinging over to Tribeca to help the police with what was supposed to be crowd control. The rest of them were in Lower Manhattan where the heart of the attack was but Friday reported Peter had run into enemy combatants and they hadn’t heard anything since.
After the statement, Steve went straight back to Peter. Tony found him playing with his Captain America action figure while Peter played with the Iron Man. By the look on his face, Steve could tell he was taken aback.
His mind irrevocably turned to the handful of memories he had gained and, most importantly, of Natasha.
Bucky hugged him back, his entire form shaking, probably with the same happy tears streaming from Tony’s eyes.
Steve did as Tony suggested and grabbed a plastic-wrapped navy blue suit with a white button up shirt. On the floor, Steve spotted some loafers with dark socks tucked into them so he grabbed them as well.
In the future, after Howard had died and Tony took over his company, Tony had wanted to ask him so many things. He had wanted to better understand the man that had been his father. Especially, after his plans to shut down the weapons sector, he wanted to know how his father would’ve felt about that. Mostly though, he wanted to know if the man was ever conflicted, if he had doubts…Or if he was every inch the man the world remembered him as from his newsreels: the charismatic genius that seemed to have no doubts that could stop him.
He practically threw the tickets at the poor teen and the kid pulled all three bears off the shelves for them. Tony greedily grabbed the Iron Man one first and looked at the tag on its ear. He crooned, “It’s called Iron Bear! Steve…My life is fulfilled. I am Teddy Bear merchandise now.”
Tony didn’t have complete control back, but he did have some movement. He tried to get up and run after the man but ended up falling on the floor.
Steve immediately moved into action, his shield sat on the other side of the couch. He didn’t put it back into his room after Pepper left.
Tony’s fingers dug into Steve’s chest and Steve placed his hand over Tony’s and squeezed it lightly.
The projection of his father was of an older version of him with an additional twenty years aging him that Tony never got to see. The widow’s peak of his hair went deeper and his eyes appeared more sunken in due to his wrinkles. He still held himself tall and wore a modern, well-tailored suit
Howard’s question stumped him. Steve didn’t know how to reply. Yes, Steve loved Tony but what did that love amount to if Tony had let Bucky die? Steve was too much of an emotional wreck at that moment to even begin to comprehend where they stood now.
When Wade entered the room, Venom reacted immediately by dragging itself away from the door and hissing at Wade like a serpent.
Looking back down at the dark liquid of his coffee, Peter bit down on his lip and worried it between his teeth. He lightly murmured, “I hope you’re right…”
Steve gently slipped himself out of Tony’s hold and exchanged incredulous glances with him. He took the phone from Natasha and brought it up to his ear.
The missile hit and another explosion wiped out all sound from his phone speakers and bulbous flames blossomed on the screen again.
Steve looked from Tony’s smile to the reactor and then back again and then gasped, “You-You did it?”
“Shut up, we’re older than you,” Tony replied. “Hell, Steve is older than all of us. Minus Thor, but Thor has the pure heart of a child.”
“I didn’t think this would be possible,” Bucky whispered. “I thought I’d die without finding my soulmate.”
He hoped Tony had returned from the past and got the help he needed. Steve’s heart shriveled as he considered Tony not surviving. Steve didn’t think he would be able to live in the future knowing that the man he loved in this era was dead…
Bruce brought forth a handheld scanner and began to examine the mass on Steve’s arm. He said, “Tell me everything that she said.”
They were on the second floor, overlooking a courtyard with a pool. There were several other units that surround the courtyard with a pool that then opened up to a beach. Cable relocked the door and said, “This place houses vacation flats so it’s usually pretty empty. Better yet, it’s within walking distance of a supermarket. Let’s go before anyone sees us.”
“Go go Stark blacklight!” He commanded, but instead of a blacklight a huge chalkboard popped up and unfolded from his hat. “No no, not black BOARD, black LIGHT!”
The lab assistants and doctors huddled around Steve, observing every twitch until his lids lifted with shock, blinking a few times, attempting to gain some sort of focus.
“T-tony…” he stuttered in return. The back of his neck was bleeding and tainting his hair, though there was a spark too, and a little smoke. Sheer luck was on Tony’s side, he’d really managed to do something to that chip.  Whatever that something was, it had freed him.
always told him. He swung his shoulders around and pressed a button that activated a rack of heat sinkers, sending them toward the two. The force of the bullets was enough to send them back, crashing into the nearest alley wall in pure synchronisation. Whilst the remainder of bricks collapsed on the two, Tony gestured to Jessica and Carol to follow him as he’d spotted an area to duck into. A manhole, of course that was just by the webbing that Peter had made.
Steve sat up, cold beads of sweat trickling over his temple, swallowing down a heavy gulp to try and moisten his dry throat, his breathing was quick, and behind that mask Tony stared with extreme and intense worry, wrapping his arms around Steve without a single second of hesitation. “It’s okay; I’ve got you, pal…” He knew post-traumatic stress when he saw it. Steve raised his arms around the metal body, closing his eyes to adjust and to just process what had happened in his head.
The dog barked happily, its tail wagging when Tony’s arm was being fixed, it’s flashing LED eyes blinking.
“I am much older than all of you combined,” Thor murmured with misunderstanding but he made no move to peer past Clint’s palm.
“What the fuck…” Tony gasped, watching the figure become smaller until he disappeared around a bend. He stumbled back to his car and whispered, “Cancel the emergency services, J…find out who that guy is instead.”
“SHIELD keeps an eye on all its people, even the ones who retired early,” she retorted. “SHIELD has already taken over the case, but we can’t find any trace of the intruder. What about your family? Your son?”
“Boarding school. I know you didn’t want him to go, but we both did, so it won’t be strange if we sent him. It’ll be the best excuse to keep him away from me and safe…”
Tony scrambled out of his car yelling for Jarvis to call paramedics and then he looked over the side and…and saw the intruder had fallen hundreds of feet to the beach below and…and was running again.
Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair and whispered, “I would gladly get stabbed by a hundred crazy women if it meant the end result was
who did it. No matter what happened in that time, you will always be my friend…if you’ll still want me…” Tony added the last bit, thinking of his own faults.
Tony stepped away from the podium and grabbed Steve’s arm, pulling him after him. Steve’s eyes returned to watching the back of Tony’s head.
Steve’s expression grew founder and he whispered, “If I wasn’t so head over heels for ya, I’d argue against it…”
They were back in their bedroom. The same bedroom where he and Tony were going to make love in so, so long ago. Their clothes were still strewn where they had thrown them and even the sheets still had their imprints. Nothing had changed since they were last there.
Venom was just as intent on catching a villain as Peter was and he ignored the civilians. Peter did not even detect a stray thought associating them with food and the relief Peter felt was almost palpable. Peter was stuck with Venom but maybe they could work harmoniously together.
Tony smirked and said, “Jarvis, please ask Ben if he can spend the night. Peter’s father has been detained for the rest of the evening.”
Ultron threw itself at Wade and slammed him into the wall. Wade grunted and Ultron wrapped its fingers around his throat. Ultron hissed, “I am no joke. I know you cannot die but I can snap your ‘baby boy’ like a twig. You…You…” Ultron’s voice dwindled as Wade lifted a square shaped remote. The robot demanded, “What is that?”
Only an hour before he witnessed his fiancé disappear into a dark void, carrying a nuclear device and a very slim chance at survival.
“Why did you never tell me?” Peter asked. Richard Parker’s image blurred as tears came to his eyes. Everything he knew was a lie. He wrapped his arms around himself and wished with all his damaged heart that it was Gwen holding him and not himself.
Cable unplugged the time glove and pulled it onto his hand. He clenched his fist and said, “Let’s get into position and fix the future.”
Steve had woken to what felt like the worst hangover in years and being trapped in a glass cage. He broke out of the cage and ran. Running cleared his head and he quickly evaded the people who ran after him.
“Yeah, I—,” he started to say and jolted when the device suddenly started to beep then out of nowhere a woman’s voice announced, “The call has been dropped. Please redial and try again.”
Thor grinned and, neither confirmed nor denied Tony’s statement, but replied, “Mjölnir will only be wielded those who are worthy. Tis a stubborn weapon that uses its roar as a battle cry to send shivers down the spines of my enemies.”
Tony frowned then waved Dummy away and the robot rolled across the room. A foot from them, the bot clenched down on the extinguisher’s handle and white foam spewed from the hose. It kept rolling leaving behind a line of white foam in its wake.
“I’ll go get my shaving mirror,” Steve said and began to push himself up to show Tony what he was seeing.
After another week of searching, everyone gave up the hunt. Life returned to relative normalcy after that but Tony never lowered the security and kept the metal shutters on the residential floors closed. Natasha and Clint returned and Thor announced that he would delay his return to Asgard until the Winter Soldier was found.
Tony shrugged and said, “I can just sleep in my suit. That’s what I’ve been doing since I got here…”
“When you suggested this farce, I was under the impression that we would actually put some thought into this,” Bucky grumbled.
They did not really wash in Tony’s shower but kissed and explored each other slowly, mapping out each other’s bodies with their hands and mouths. It was one of the most erotic experiences in Tony’s life.
He went outside and saw the agent straighten with the appearance of his Captain America regalia. The uniform seemed to give him an air of importance, his shield especially. He noticed the change when he started to interact with certain people in and out of uniform. He smiled at the man and asked, “Where can I put this?”
“Steve?” Tony whispered, unable to fathom what he did to his boyfriend just yet. He stared back at Steve's face, refusing to look down and see the horror he created.
Peter went straight to his computer and pressed the power button. The machine hummed to life and Peter sat in front of it. He logged onto the internet as soon as he was able but then paused as he stared at his search engine, not knowing where to go first. He was apprehensive about searching himself. He knew some of it wouldn’t be good…hell, most of it would probably be awkward or embarrassing.
He beadily eyed the energy bar Cable had tossed him. Cable seemed fine living off them alone, but Steve’s body burned through the calories provided pretty fast with his metabolism alone. He said, “I’m getting hungry…do we have anything more than this?”
Bucky would be the easiest. Using the suit’s stealth technology, Tony could catch the man before he plummeted to his death without anyone noticing.
So many changes had occurred that Steve could barely keep up and he kept wondering: should the world know Captain America survived?
“…Have you always liked men?” Steve asked, wanting to know ever since the elevator doors sealed between him and Tony.
It exhausted them so that they had slept through their alarm and Jarvis’s calls. Bruce had to shake them awake. They scrambled to get their clothes on, laughing as their bodies continued to thrum with excess energy from their relief and joy. They stole quick kisses whenever they got close enough in their readying.
He didn’t know what shocked him more: the fact that, that red figure was Deadpool or that he was carrying an obviously unconscious Peter in his arms.
Steve scrambled out of the bed and ripped off all the things attached to him. The machines in the room all started blaring their alarms shrilly. A nurse ran into the room and paled when she saw he was up.
. This alone is suspicious but it also showed traces of DNA of the known criminal: the Chameleon. That person is not Master Parker’s mother and is currently in the same building as him.”
He opened his eyes to see half the Avengers were already there, answering the priority alarm. Wanda had her hands raised and her pink magic glowing, Sam and Scott were fully dressed in their armor.
Natasha cupped the side of his face that was uninjured and stared into his eyes. His gaze revealed his true feelings: his despair for their fate and his love for her. He never thought she was a distraction.
“I like that,” Tony purred and the blush on Steve’s cheeks grew warmer. Tony continued, “I especially like that you are not testing your newly freed homosexuality out on me but are really interested in seeing me.” Tony reached out and grasped Steve’s forearm for a few seconds before pulling back and going back to unloading the food. His touch lingered on Steve’s skin in a tingling heat. Tony continued, “So Cap, I figured we eat then perhaps watch a movie. How does that sound?”
He heard the others run over but, upon their approach, Venom expelled its knife-sharp tendrils around Peter to keep them back and skewering Wade again.
Uncle Bucky stalked up to him and Peter could see his uncle’s right arm was trembling. He could tell his uncle was battling with his fragile psyche and Peter wondered how afraid he should be at that moment.
, the best part is the paint job!” Tony said then stepped back so Steve could get a good look at the high chair and all its gold and red glory. There was a U.S. flag stitched onto the seat backer and Steve shook his head.
Coulson sighed heavily and then redirected the question as he asked, “What did you want to talk about? What’s wrong?”
Peter froze and waited for Venom to drag them after their next victim but they did not move. Peter cautiously shifted and Venom let him. Peter dropped his arms and the symbiote did not restrict him. To test his luck, he suddenly dashed a few feet down the tunnel but was unhindered.
There was no questioning the glistening in Wade’s eyes were tears. His eyes looked like they were on the verge of over spilling, especially when his eyes crinkled from his resulting smile. He whispered, “Aw, Petey…you know how to make a guy feel like a million bucks.”
Thank you for reading! I am back after a long break! I am going to try responding to all of the comments I've missed while I was gone but, moving forward, I'll be posting to this new fic every weekend. Till next time! :)
For a moment, the life Steve had dreamed of flashed before his eyes. There would never be a picket fence at the Tower but, he had Tony and they could adopt kids if they wanted too. Steve wouldn’t mind making breakfast every morning for a tired, grumpy mate and a kid or two emulating their father’s grumpiness.
“Just leave me alone!” Peter snipped. He had been betrayed by all of them: Pops, Uncle Tony, Uncle Bucky, Aunt Tasha, all of them.
“So he is in one of the high-rises,” Tony muttered, expanding one of the holograms. His fingers tapped furiously as he searched.
She pulled him toward her with that connection and into an embrace which he did not fight. He fit in her arms like he belonged there and settled in with a sigh. He lay limply in her embrace and he did not attempt to hold her back but he took comfort from her touch. Natasha’s arms were tight around him, as if she were trying to hold him together.
Steve felt a flush hit his cheeks and he turned away sharply from Bruce. The scientist did not notice as he was too infatuated with whatever was on the slide.
“They must all be fighting the others,” Natasha murmured but the unease remained. This was too easy. Would the Red Skull really have left Steve so unguarded?
“So-?” Peter paused when Eddie crushed a paper into a ball and threw it at Peter. He could have easily dodged it. His spidey-senses even gave off the slightest of flares but Peter endured the slight tap from the paper and leveled an annoyed look at his friend.
Steve felt like he could easily slip into a panic attack and could already feel his breath quickening but he forced himself to remain calm. Steve lived in the dreamscape. All he had to do was think of something and it would happen. He closed his eyes and wished to be by Tony’s side. Everything around him became darker and Steve opened his eyes.
Tony was the one who came up with the idea. He knew Steve did not want Peter’s life dictated by the media like their lives had evolved into and, ultimately, because of that, they decided to go with the second option.
Wade came back into the room carrying an armful of various chip bags. They all turned to him and he said, “I couldn’t decide so I got a sampling of everything.”
Steve followed Tony to his car where his bodyguard, Happy, was waiting and rushed them in. The man then rounded the car, slid across the hood, and jumped in the driver’s seat before accelerating into traffic.
“Especially the ones trained by the Red Room,” Steve added, also a little awestruck. He never had seen either move so quickly.
Tony grasped his arm, his anger melting away some with this new information, and whispered, “Alright, then what’s upsetting you?”
Tony pressed himself into Steve’s hard chest and closed his eyes as he tilted his head upward with excited trepidation. He was going to kiss him. Steve was interested. Tony’s feelings were not one-sided!
Tony grasped Steve’s hand and added, “Seriously, thank you. You’re not just taking care of a problem, you’re utterly destroying it.”
Jarvis did not reply and Tony said, "Look...just find me a popular, lengthy Hallmark card and I'll read off that all sentimentality...I can't tell him all of that."
Bucky cut his hair into a new, shorter style and lent Steve some of his clothes before they left but Steve’s chest was a little wider so his shirt was sinfully tight.
Tony dug up everything about the Winter Soldier and tried to understand him or where he might take Steve. Any possible leads he sent to the others to follow up on and he continued to work as he waited on the results of their search. Everything was turning up futile.
Steve took a step toward him as if to stop him but Tony was already gone and Steve was reaching out to open air. His heart twisted painfully in his chest and he drew his hand back to his side.
Marcel pulled an 8x10 photo out of his folder and asked, “Was this the dress you took the sample from?”
In the coming weeks, Tony went through the motions of putting his affairs in order and the marks on his chest grew in size and discomfort. It hurt him to move his upper torso too fast.
Steve sat up and looked down at Tony’s tented trunks. Steve gulped, a sign Tony was starting to recognize as Steve’s desire and wanting something he shouldn’t. Steve tentatively asked, “D-Do you need help with that?”
Tony was on the closest thing to a bed in weeks and he was using all of his will not to sink into the bed and sleep.
“Do you remember what you promised last night? About not leaving?” Steve asked breathlessly. Bucky tensed and Steve said, “Please come back with me to the Tower…” Bucky pushed himself up to his elbows and looked sharply away, his gaze going to the door. Was he thinking about bolting? Steve cupped his cheek, trying to make him look back at him, and whispered, “Bucky, please—.”
No, wait, he was the one they had been looking for! The murderer! He finally caught Howard unaware – he finally –!
. It is tarantula sized in spider proportions,” Wade stated, moving his hips with Peter’s so that they were lightly humping each other. Peter flushed from the obviously overt sex act but he kept moving his hips and the flushed settled into his cheeks with his growing arousal.
! What turned me into Spider-Man, was made by my father, with his DNA! If anyone, but a relative, used it, it would kill them! Richard Parker is my father,” Peter stated, he looked to Tony and his brows knitted together. He repeated to Tony with venom in his voice, “Richard is my father,
Tony appeared in the dreamworld facedown on the ground. There was no definition to the world, just darkness, and Steve’s eyes just narrowed in on Tony.
The Sandman was no match for Tony and his blasters. He tried to crush Tony with his massive hand but Tony merely needed to point his thrusters at him to stop him and turn the sand into glass. He whittled away to nothing until he was just as weakened man, feebly trying to crawl away.
He’d barely gotten used to the fact that Steve was alive nonetheless engaged to him...but to see a photo from their wedding...
Peter stared at the reflective surface, remembering a couple years ago, being on the other side of those doors and nervously staring at his warped reflection. Back then, all he’d been worried about was being able to create a relationship with his father…
With SHIELD and the Avengers reemergence into the world, the Avengers, their mates, and families were able to move back to their Tower…and James went with them.
He bit down on his lip and got to his feet. Who was he kidding? This was his life, filled with pain, regret, and misfortune. His aunt’s words rang true, this was just going to be another hurt he was going to have to endure.
Tony was near salivating at the shield’s nearness but he practically choked on it when the man wielding the defensive weapon turned to toward Tony.
A frowning Tony poked at the fire Jacques built with a long stick. Bucky walked over to him and in that time Tony’s stick caught aflame and he dropped it into the fire. He stared at the flames, deep in thought, and didn’t notice Bucky standing beside him.
Which was why he shooed Peter out of his lab and snapped on some welding goggles and told Friday to call over Steve.
In answer, Peter’s clothes warped and covered his body in an inky coating. Venom whispered in his ear again, “One.”
With his lips wobbling, Wade couldn’t help but agree. He’d never felt more relieved or happier in his entire life.
Coulson dreamed up dozens of scenarios when he finally met his hero…but none of them turned out like this.
Steve bumped Tony’s leg with his and murmured, “I…I didn’t hurt your feet much from dancing, did I? Bucky says I got two left feet.”
He was not alive but he was here, at least, in the dream world. And whatever trial that was, he had made it through at least and was going to stay in Tony’s dreams.
He held his metal arm before him like a shield and angled his body as he weaved to avoid the bullets. With his other arm he shot at them as he was clipped and hit by their bullets.
Their eyes locked and they could not look away from each other. Tony did not know how long they looked at each other. He was so shocked he could not think nonetheless keep track of the time passing.
“Boy or girl? I vote girl. Natasha Jr. will need a partner when facing off against the boys,” Bucky stated.
He heard the whistle of his shield blasting through the air and he raise the fist with the wristband. Not a moment later did his shield slam onto his arm, locking in place. The rockets that brought it clipped off and Steve drew the shield in front of him.
Clint stepped beside him as Tony disappeared around the corner and Steve gasped, “Please, tell me he’s going to be alright.”
“Hear, hear,” Steve mumbled in agreement and leaned back into the couch beside Tony. He wrapped his arms around his husband and Tony returned the embrace. Steve took comfort in his hold and let himself relax.
“Hey, Steve—,” Tony began, his voice worn with exhaustion and it tore out Steve’s heart all over again. Steve immediately assumed it was an old message he somehow missed but as he listened it became extremely apparent that was not the case.
“No shit,” Tony scoffed. “I’m going to take it out, but I need you to be ready to save my life if something goes wrong.” Tony paused as he considered his next command, feeling the very idea leech the warmth out of his limbs as he considered it.
There was little to no information on the man himself and he could tell key things were missing from the files he was given.
Any good feeling he had disappeared when he saw the same thing that had happened to Tony was going to happen to their future son.
Around him, the team was gearing up or checking their weapons. Steve was fiddling with his weapon. He’d cleaned it that morning and it was ready to go but his fingers were restless. His eyes, however, were content to linger on the man from the future.
Pepper promptly turned around and started walking away. Over her shoulder, she said, “Have fun with your honeymoon phase, boys!”
He drew back his foot and hit Steve with his metal boot, cracking his ribs. Steve was going to try and remain silent but he couldn’t help but yelp from the sudden pain.
He had contacted Coulson for whatever information SHIELD had on the Winter Soldier. In the alternative timeline, the Winter Soldier had been an assassin hunted by the Avengers. In this timeline, he was probably hunted by SHIELD.
Peter chuckled and was looking at his friend in a new light. He replied, “No, this is alright.” He took another drink and decided, “You can even keep flirting with me.”
When had Jarvis removed it? It was such an insignificant clue to the past that Tony hadn’t even considered using the armor’s stealth technology to hide it. Had Jarvis done so as soon as Tony left the suit? Was it trying to somehow protect the future by hiding such an insignificant marker?
“Battles are chaos! We all can’t follow your formulated plan. Our opponents won’t do it, so why should we!”
Steve’s mouth flapped like a fish as he struggled for the words. Tony’s reasoning was incredulous and flawed and…and Tony wasn't having another affair.
Steve was trembling and breathing shallowly. The knowledge that it was Tony’s hands touching him made his touch ten-times more powerful.
When they got home, however, Steve’s heart still had enough in it to break again, because their new home was destroyed.
“Wait,” Tony gasped. Steve greedily sucked on his bottom lip, distracting him for a moment until he clarified, “
“I loved Bucky,” Steve retorted, his voice giving a little on the end. It was the first time he had voiced it aloud. He had admitted it to himself only just recently. He had tried to deny it like his sexuality.
Peter eventually fell asleep in Tony’s arms and he slowed his swaying to a stop. He was afraid to put the boy down or really move at all from his position. Peter was
A cloud of white smoke was beginning to dissipate in the middle of the room. A large figure stood in the middle of the smoke and was hunched over, coughing loudly.
He tried to hail a cab once he got into a safer area. The cabbie took one look at him and the blood that had spilt all over his white shirt from his head wound and drove off. He must have called the police because ten minutes later he had a bright light shined into his face and was ordered down on the ground. Steve complied and, for once, was glad for his universally recognized face as the officers were quickly able to discern who he was.
Tony celebrated Steve’s return with a mini festivity and brought out all of Steve’s favorite foods. They talked and laughed all night long. Neither strayed too far from the other’s side and they were almost always in contact as if both of them were afraid to lose the other again. They watched Steve’s favorite movies until they both passed out on the couch, late into the night.
Steve’s entire body stiffened and he looked to Tony. As soon as the Goblin had his hands on the time glove, he went back and to get the reactor to kill Tony.
Steve did not wait for a retort and slid Tony’s loose jeans and boxers from his hips. He bent down and, one by one, pulled Tony’s legs out of his scrunched clothing. When he stood again, Tony grasped his arm and made him look in his eyes.
Peter’s workstation sat right next to the couch and had evolved over the years too. Originally, Tony had built him a tiny fake workstation for him to play with as a toddler. Now Peter had an actual workstation. It was much larger and had tools similar to Tony’s and the ability to project interactive holograms. Odd bobbles and bits of machinery were scattered across its surface from Peter’s attempt at innovation.
“Thanks for the vote of confidence,” Tony retorted sarcastically. He tossed his tablet on the couch beside him and pushed himself up to his feet. He walked over to the smoking Iron Man toy and kicked it lightly and whistled, “Wow, you did a number on this thing…”
A content silence fell between them and, through half lidded eyes, Steve watched the curtains move, reflecting on the everything that had occurred since they last slept in this room.
The Hydra agent raised his gun again as if to bludgeon in his head with a second hit. With one eye already swelling shut, Tony squinted at the masked man with a grimace and fired a single shot at him. His aim was off so it only clipped the man's shoulder but a second shot to the back brought him down.
Natasha understood what James meant and replied for him, “What if they are hurting him? Would you be able to stomach watching them torture him
Visions and hopes for their future flitted away into the desolate chasm that was forming in his heart.
Natasha and Ben stood by his side as Peter’s godparents. In the pews, May, Bruce, Clint, and Tony watched the ceremony. It was a private ceremony in a church built for discreetness, originally it had belonged to a strong and religious Mob family but now it was merely a local church.
“I will never see you again,” James whispered, his voice breaking. His eyes told her this statement alone was true and how much he regretted it. She hoped he could read her as easily because she felt the same.
“It was you who said I could be a Commando,” Tony retorted, crossing his arms over his chest stubbornly.
Steve jerked in his stride but kept moving forward. Tony’s smile confirmed it. He really did not realize how badly he had hurt Steve. Steve smiled uneasily at him, hoping to mask the true depth of his feelings.
Peter dropped his head and adjusted his hold on Tony’s shirt. He whispered, “…But I did, Dad. I saw it. It…it happened with my hands…” His blue eyes flickered back up and he whispered, “I’m not a child anymore.”
“Not that I don’t love our little visits,” Tony drawled. “But, by your presence, I take it you’re here because of Steve?”
He flushed to himself as he imagined physically doing what he had done with Gwen…but with Wade instead. It was weird. He wasn’t going to lie. Would he let Wade kiss him tonight? He wondered what his lips would feel like. Would it feel rough because of the scars?
It started off on the right track. Tony had Bucky tell them about how he and Natasha had originally gone from comrades to lovers when they were working with the Red Room. Steve assumed he was gathering intel on how best to approach Natasha, not gathering ideas.
“The most secure location will probably be with the time machine itself,” Peggy stated, interrupting his thoughts. “We have a full battalion there and the fort is secured. It would be more dangerous for the suit if it was stored in one of the 107
“I say, let him try and ‘woo’ you and if you like it, go for it,” Bucky stated. “Tony’s a smart guy and he knows more than he’s letting on. I bet he’s got an eye on all the major historical events that are going on right now. He won’t let them change. I trust him.”
They moved fast, almost frantically, trying to collect as much pleasure as possible before they came. Peter was hunched over him, his mouth centimeters from his, and their breath mingling in a hot cloud between them.
“Yes, because it sounds like you are weirdly flirting with me and your boyfriend is standing only five feet away from me.”
“You’re going to die,” she hissed pointing to his bleeding arm. She froze as, before her eyes, the wound healed itself. The blood dripping down his arm slowed and then stopped all together. The hole in his arm shrunk and knitted itself together before her very eyes.
Steve hummed in agreement and kissed Tony deeply. They fell back onto the bed, both laughing joyfully upon landing.
Steve expected him to cry again, simply embrace him for comfort, or maybe open up about what happened.
Tony's grin grew wider and he pulled Peter toward the team. His adoptive family all greeted him warmly and the feeling on Peter's jaw went away.
Steve felt exposed and it made him nervous and lustful at the same time. He had never been completely naked with someone before, not even Peggy, and they hadn’t been a virtuous couple.
He squinted at the empty bed and blinked a few times to make sure he was really seeing it devoid of both Peter and Tony. He saw Peter’s IV pole on the other side of the bed and stepped closer to perhaps get a clue as to what happened.
Steve grasped Tony’s hand and reminded him, “My life truly started when you fell into that time machine.”
Steve did so without question and even slid under the blankets with him. But, as soon as he lifted the comforters, the light from his reactor illuminated both of them and Steve paused as his eyes were irrevocably drawn to the lines on his chest peeking out from his shirt collar.
Tony leaned in, placing himself just a breath away from Steve, and breathily murmured, “Oh, I do mind. I am
For once, the landscape was his own. They were in Steve’s childhood home, sitting in the small living room where the largest window in the house was. They sat in the sofa chairs by the window, looking out into the overcast, grey streets. It was raining and the only sound that could be heard was of the heavy droplets hitting the roof as well as the occasional droplet breaking through the ceiling and hitting something indoors.
She punched him with the metal arm and he flew back into the fire. She kicked one of the explosives that had fallen out of the suit and fired the repulsor at it as soon as it hit Kilian. It exploded, totally destroying Kilian and engulfing Pepper in the edge of its flames.
Bucky was more curt in his greeting and crossed his arms as he grumbled, “You got a look in your eye that tells me I gotta tie Steve to me or else you’re gonna drag him off and get him in trouble.”
After seeing the territory and adjusting it to his needs, Bucky seemed more comfortable in the house. Even with just one arm, the man moved around with the fluid ease akin to the big cats Tony had seen locked up at the zoo. Bucky was clearly still dangerous but, luckily in his eyes, Pepper and Tony were his cubs not his prey.
Once he started talking he could not stop. He told her about first meeting Peter, about his son growing up, how smart he was, and how easily he made friends. He did not shy from the hard topics and also told her about Peter’s captivity in Hydra’s lab until he was two-years-old and about the powers that occurred because of it. He told her of Peter’s struggle of balancing life with the Avengers and life in the outside world with a secret identity. And he told her of Peter’s interest in meeting her and how he grew up fascinated by her ghost.
Steve inhaled sharply and Tony probably wouldn’t have heard it if he were not so close to him. Steve slowly whispered at a lower volume, “I…I care for you too, Tony…” Steve enfolded him into his embrace and murmured, “I wish I could have been the one to travel to your time…then this would have been so much simpler…”
“You asked yourself how much longer you could do it? Do what exactly?” Peggy murmured with interest.
!” Tony gasped excitedly, sticking his head back into the open doors. He explained, “Bruce has a mini fridge in his lab! We can stuff some of those zucchini bites in there!! He’ll eat those!” Tony pulled out a wrapped up plate and kissed Steve’s cheek as he stepped past him. Tony smiled at Peter and said, “When I get back we should all share another slice of cake! Be right back!” Tony waved to them as he disappeared down the hall.
He glanced at said man beside him. He’d been tense ever since they left the base. Tony could distract him for a moment…
“Nothing,” Steve replied and the lie seared his throat. He reiterated, “Nothing much. He pretty much told me not to follow him…”
Eventually, Thor got so fed up with not being able to order a S’mores Frappuccino at his favorite Starbucks that he blasted out the windows as he yelled at the reporter to stop accosting him. Tony, of course, paid for all the damages and Thor got his beverage after he autographed a picture of himself for the store owner to put up on the wall.
He dug his fingers into his thigh instead and reminded himself geeking out over his number two OTP will not sit right with anyone present. Plus, these were Peter’s parents. He needed to build an actual relationship with these men; he should not keep thinking them as these fictional characters he imagined being fluffy together because they were
“It is,” Steve agreed with a heavy sigh. “Let’s take care of SHIELD and then we can all sit down and talk about this.” Steve motioned to the beard. He was ready to tell the story and move on from it. He was also ready for a shave and a haircut. He had resolved to get rid of the beard once he saved Tony and he’d accomplished it.
Peter ran his tongue across the back of his teeth then asked, “Do you think I will be able to see her soon?”
They set up camp with big smiles and were loudly deducing what kind of state they’d find Zola in. Most depictions were of a scared, filthy man, an image Bucky tried hard to imagine because every time he closed his eyes all he saw was Zola standing over him with a needle or electrodes or a gas mask or…
Steve chuckled but he couldn’t help but wonder what that name could be. The MK 15 on its chest made sense now at least...
Natasha’s face hardened and she said, “I know what you are planning. Stop now or I will retaliate. You do not want me in the middle of your and Steve’s relationship.”
An alien ship must’ve crashed into one corner because the entire north side of the building was caved in and all of the windows were blown out. Most of the kitchen was gone and looked like it had been on fire at one point.
At one point, Bucky pinned him to the mat, his metal arm thrust under jaw, restraining his neck. His other arm immobilized Steve’s body down onto top of one arm and the other was trapped in Bucky’s vicelike grip. Steve struggled to break free and Bucky bent over him and Bucky hissed, “Trapped, soldier? Want to escape? Is something bothering you? Don’t worry, we’ll make it go away. We will make you nothing again.”
The Captain did not reply so Coulson reaffirmed, “I will go now. The psychiatrist will be with you momentarily.
Without looking back to the couple on the balcony, Wade ran to the elevator and followed his boyfriend.
The man’s eyes flickered down to the gun and then back to her. Cocking his head to the side, without looking away from her, he asked, “And if you could have both?”
Tony sighed and ran his fingers through Steve’s hair. Steve closed his eyes at the feeling. He loved it when Tony ran his fingers through his hair.
The judge slammed down her gavel and stated, “The prosecution is right in the defendant’s flight risk and the bail mirrors that risk. I assume it won’t be a problem seeing as how Captain Rogers is in a relationship with the richest man in the city?” Marcel pursed his lips and the judge smiled. She slammed her gavel again and stated, “Court is adjourned.”
The detective placed his hand on his hip where his revolver was unclipped and ready to use. He stated, “I am going to ask you one more time, put down the shield and come with me. Your DNA results are in. You are a match.”
Steve instantly was on edge by Tony’s manner. Whatever was in that box was bad news and it contained information Tony did not want Steve to know, information that might affect their relationship as Natasha eluded.
Howard hugged her, hoping to comfort her. The fact that Cap was dead was too shocking and he couldn’t truly believe it just yet. She let him pull her into his embrace for just a moment but then she pushed herself out of it. She stated, “Steve wanted me to relay a message to Tony…I thought I should tell him what happened to Steve and Steve’s final words all at once to lessen the blow…”
Sneaky nodded and then rose into the air from a force of light coming out of his hands and feet. It stated, “I have your radio frequency. If I find anything, I’ll let you know.”
“Yes,” Steve replied. He sat next to her and gently brushed hair out of Peter’s face. He asked Natasha, “Did he hurt you? He does not know his own strength yet…You’re actually the first person I let hold him since I got him.”
There was a hole in the roof and Steve leapt into it. The hole went right through the roof and the floor below. Steve spared the first floor a quick scan to make sure there were no enemies.
His hips pushed hard against Steve’s body, trying to grind himself closer toward the super soldier’s huge standing length.
Purple Man loomed over Tony, grabbing his hair that poked out of what was left of his helmet and using that as means to raise him, staring deep into his eyes.
Tony was in his room, taking off his black tie and letting it hang around his neck while unbuttoning his dress-shirt, stretching a little.
“Ugh…” Tony groaned rubbing the back of his head that had smacked into the silver lined wall behind him.
“What are you?” Tony yelled, demanding an answer as he narrowed his eyes, knowing his luck it was the chameleon or someone, this couldn’t be real.
A flash of blond hair was the first thing he caught a glimpse of in the blur during being dragged back through the alley. His repulsors took a time to light up – his scrap box fixing wasn’t exactly perfected yet. As soon as he could he raised his hand up and pointed it toward the woman that was holding his shoulder plate.
Tony Stark would pride himself on precision and accuracy even in the barren deserts of southern Nevada at the heart of the Mojave, nearing the infamous Death Valley which coincided with the location that was flashing up on his HUD. Bright vermilion hooplets on the intricate GPS mapping system would show him the whereabouts of the Captain that he was searching for. Luckily there were numerous tracking devices in Steve’s costume (some unbeknownst to the soldier himself) but every single installation was for Steve’s own protection and proved more than handy in situations such as a kidnapping. Tony would sometimes internally thank his own genius for prompting him to bypass minor verbal contracts agreed upon, but when it came down to the line it was all for the greater good. How else would the Captain agree to have multiple tracking devices embedded throughout his costume, some devices as small as a sewing needle or thumb tack? Freedom is what he had preached for so long and for Tony to be watching his every move was invasive to say the least. It wasn’t as if Tony watched every one of Steve’s moves (he was just curious
it, he could feel every ounce on his frame, he could feel his bones bending inwards and caving in on him.
Tony stared at each second that ticked down. With each moment that passed, as the bot reeling itself in and Steve lunging at it. Luckily Tony had anticipated such a reaction, and the first bot was a dummy, the second rolled itself through the decontamination doors. This was the moment that he bit his lower lip with pure nerves, his hand returning to clasp the bottom on his chin as he maintained the same perplexed stare while the second bot scooted around Steve just as planned. T’Challa and Hank stood just behind Tony, both with their arms folded watching every small jerk that Steve was making, observing with intense scrutiny.
“Steve, put yourself in my shoes, would you believe it if I walked into your room and said that I was an angel?”
“If you have a problem, you’re more than welcome to protest. I’m not an evil man. In fact, I’m rather fair.” Tony shrugged.
Steve looked at him, feeling the slip of breath near his ear, every small hesitation and hitch. He placed him back down to the ground, temporarily.
With a thick swallow Tony followed the Captain’s command, appreciating it even. If Tony was going to be naked, he would’ve preferred if Steve were in the same situation; maintaining their equality, although it was clear in this instance that Steve was the one in change, particularly given Tony’s strangely emotional state which he was going to blame entirely on their reunion. It had been so long, too long.
“I know…” Tony sighed heavily, his head lowering with distain. “I saved as much as I could, but we’ll see how much actually survives when we’re back.”
Time after time he would ask this question but receive no answer, no, he would remain trapped in limbo for what seemed an eternity. He couldn’t even see his friends or family enter the gates as passed on souls, all was clouded to him. In limbo he shall remain, trapped and surrounded by nothing but clouds and hearing nothing but this voice as he begged for more answers.
His patience wore thin after hours scrolling through dimension after dimension in search for the perfect partner. Although each was tempting, he knew he had
It was infuriating. He couldn’t move, and he wasn’t being heard no matter how loudly he was shouting, but Steve Rogers was a man of persistence, he wasn’t about to give up. He tried and tried, no unsure whether it was making any difference or not.
Not exactly the sentence that Tony wanted to be greeted with after spending all of his time doing work, and finally being able to catch up on some shut eye (all be it to the aid of a couple of pills that he was given), nonetheless, he had managed to rest for a short while but that didn’t allow his guilty conscience to rest once.
“Rest, yeah, that’s right.” Tony nervously stuttered, trying to lead Steve over to the mattress they had lain out the night before for him and making sure he was placed upon it. “You rest, sleep, get some sleep.”
“S’not what I’ve heard,” he spoke, his accent heavy. “You’re gonna tell me how you managed to get Parker off the radar.”
“Tony, Tony we have to go, we have to get out of here! We have to go tell the others…!” Steve’s hand moved to his radio, trying to press the device only to hear static and loud explosions in the distance. His breathing quickened. “Tony, Iron Man!”
Bucky knew that he was the most agile of the two, and used Steve to help climb closer, grabbing onto the panel of the bomb and flinging it open, watching the door fly off and plummet to the ground, causing him to make a loud swallow. Of course there was hesitance in his motion, and he knew he had to be careful with it, but the sooner he could get it done, the sooner that they could go back home. Steve approached with the same mind-set, carefully trying to amble his way up and fight the air resistance that was pushing him back to reach Bucky’s side.  Before he could, there was a loud beeping and he saw his sidekick’s fingers begin to move quicker. “Cap, Cap it’s going to blow!”
“You know what, Victor, I’ve always been a fan of heavy metal but this takes it to a whole new level.”
“Okay, so let’s start where you left off, the 1940’s right? Fury tried to make you integrate to the 1950’s sort of thing, you were just heading into the 60’s so you’re up to date until then, let’s show you a few more things.” Tony found himself scooting closer to Steve, taking in that smell of what to him were the remnants of gun powder or soot that’d imbedded itself so deeply into Steve’s skin that not even 70 years in ice could ever remove it.
“I’ll get you out of here!” Tony reassured him, while Steve was trapped in a circle of flames Tony had to find some way to form a bridge over them. He glanced back at his other suits, but they were surrounded by flames and rubble too, and it wouldn’t surprise him if the entire internal system was down. It must have been if the sprinklers weren’t working and JARVIS wasn’t responding.
“You know, you promised to get me out of here by last night…” Steve muttered after hours of silence.
He just fixed his collar and made haste, weaving through small gaps between desks and trying to dance between the other officers walking around with coffee in their hands or stacks of papers and bags of evidence. The place was filled with life, just as he had expected and dreamed of and he was seconds away from becoming one of the cogs in this well-oiled machine.
A couple more hours passed until Steve had heard a knock on his door, turning his head to it. There was only one person that would come into his room this late at night, and low and behold when the door opened it was Tony – standing there in a long, oversized Stark Resilient t-shirt and boxers, rubbing his eyes. Without a single word, Steve scooted over in his bed. Tony shut the door behind him and slipped under the warm cotton sheets…always so pristine, despite being so old.
Captain America wasn’t having any of it. He reached for Tony’s shoulder and with that stiff authoritative “Tony.” Accompanying his actions, he tried to tug him back a little, the helmet in his arm clattering to the floor. The suit lit up, as Steve touched him the gauntlet from the other side raised and he spun around, grabbing Steve’s hand and practically throwing him against the wall. Tony’s eyes looked as though he wasn’t expecting his own movement, in fact, he looked horrified.
“When you put it like that, it’s creepy.” The boy lay on his back, shutting his eyes for a moment. It felt great to be on a bed after so long, a comfortable mattress, a moderately soft pillow behind his head.
“It all happens in the main tower. The supreme leader resides there. The chips that everyone has, the augmentations, all of it takes place there. At first they thought tracking was enough, now they aim to control. And they will kill anyone who stands in their way.”
How could anyone love someone that looked like that, particularly the man that he loved the most. Although he was sure that vanity wasn’t what attracted Tony to Steve, there were doubts in his mind that would return now and then. But if he was a creature locked in quarantine how could anyone ever love that? There was an entire world outside that box and what was to say that Tony wouldn’t one day step away and move on, leaving Steve there forever.
Tony snarled and shot his repulsor toward Steve, unable to balance after it but finding footing once he was leaned against a wall behind him.
Two minutes later his attention was caught by a criminal being hauled in, only he was singed from head to toe – completely burned. The tips of his hair still had embers sizzling bright, even the ends of his moustache were smoking.
Just as the bot leered, metal creaking with its movement, clearly targeting the two men, an arrow lodged perfectly just by its tear duct; it beeped a couple of times before exploding, taking out one if its eyes and sending the bot back in a much more frantic stagger backwards, loud electronic groans coming from its innards.
a man of thought, a scientist of creation that could invent things that would even amaze the great Tony Stark (although it took a lot for Tony to admit that he was impressed). The thing about the scientists within their group was that they were all specialists in their own division, and even with Tony’s seven doctorates, he still found himself specialising in engineering. This was very different from Reed, who preferred studying interdimensional travel and particle theory as well as side-lining his vast knowledge of human biology, chemistry and physics. (At least they had shared common ground on their knowledge of electrical engineering). Tony rarely questioned Reed at all in regards to his work; what the two of them had specialised in had made them the people that they were today.
It all came back to him the moment that the details were uttered. After all, it was his command that got them all in this position in the first place. If only he’d had time to do a more thorough search, but there was no time to dwell on the past, not when he wanted answers. No, he needed answers.
Tony awoke the next morning, feeling the rays of sun burst though the kitchen window as he kept his eyes tightly shut, yawning and stretching his arms out as he looked around, seeing the empty bottle. He sighed deeply,
He was sure he was going to bleed out and die right there and then, but he felt the heat from one of Hammers bots over his shoulder.
“Pretty sure those two finally sorted things out, all the tension seems… Well, it’s dissipated and they look happier.”
“I do but there’s one thing I like about it the most… Asides from your attention to detail.” He gestured to what were supposed to be the turrets.
“Uh-uh, I wouldn’t move… Unless you want your face fried, Captain. Your will power may be strong enough to keep my powers at bay but I don’t think you’re strong enough as a whole to withstand a repulsor blast from your ‘friend’ at point blank.”
Steve’s legs were now one of his most powerful assets, and he would use them to their fullest capabilities.
They trickled down his cheeks, leaning closer to Steve and feeling his chest tighten, just to hold him like that, so limp, so pale. He leaned closer, feeling his lower lip quiver.
“I love you…” Tony whispered uncontrollably, the fire inside him being lit after being dormant for years
Nick took one last glance over his shoulder at the screens, the much happier man and his best friend, going about their day as if nothing had ever changed. He was living the world that he could have only dreamed of, and it was truly beautiful. A world at peace.
Tony lifted the faceplate and stared, saying, “Just who the hell do you think I am? I got it from good ol’ jolly Saint Nick gave it to me in his bag of presents.”
“I do, Steve… Well, with all that’s left of it that is.” He said, tapping his own reactor before letting his hand resume its rightful place around Steve’s small waist.
Tony turned his head over to look at the fallen bot that encased Zola, clicking his tongue and shaking his head. “I can carry his main CPU back home for the others to deal with. To be honest I just want to slam him into the negative zone.”
“It’s great! By the way, her name is H.E.L.E.N. She’s a companion AI to JARVIS, she’s your driver right now so I’d be nice if I were you, Rogers.” Tony replied with a proud smile. “Isn’t it amazing? I managed to create an AI in a matter of moments.”
“Peter you try and web them back, I’ll get Carol and Jessica,” Tony barked out as he resumed his rightful stand as the leader of the group that he would still deem, as scattered as they were, the Avengers.
“A little consideration here!” Tony yelled through the cuts of wind that forced him to shut his eyes before they began to water. It was hard to hold onto the jaggedly shaped armour, and what made it more difficult was the fact that Tony still hadn’t gotten used to his new hand yet. He could grip things but gripping them tightly was another task in itself; in his mind there was an easy comparison between his hand and one of those claw machines at a fairground. He knew he had to let go and intercept him, maybe even distract him even though the super soldier seemed un-phased that he was holding onto his leg.
The question was, now that the wings became slightly more visible, was Tony actually starting to believe in him? Particularly now that he was seeing the feathers fall. Angelic grace was something that Tony didn’t believe in, so how could it sway his mind? The only reason that he was sitting here and witnessing this, enduring it all was because he loved to be in Steve’s company, no matter what they were doing. They could be arguing but at least he wasn’t alone. He hated being alone.
Tony almost fell to the ground; instead he dropped to his knees with his hand pressed on his face. Victor was alive, and he’d stolen the schematics that he’d wanted all along – and Reed was gone, clearly kidnapped by the signs of it. Tony had, moments earlier, pieced together that liquid nitrogen would give Doom the chance to freeze Reed and take him, rendering him helpless.
“Watch that potty mouth…” Steve wanted to sound more stern but the more he was speaking the more helpless he sounded, and he hated that, internally blaming the dip in his tone on the sedatives that were being flushed through his entire body.
. But he couldn’t judge on first encounters, even though that’s what he used to do back in the day. He didn’t have time for meet and greets. There were soldiers that he would see for a day sometimes at base before having to go on missions with them. Not all of his duties revolved around the Commandos.
Tony ran into the kitchen to see the others there for breakfast, running to the fridge and pulling out some burgers from the night before, and other bits and pieces that he could find. While T’Challa insisted that keeping Steve on a strict diet was important to observe any changes in his system or any potential reactions, right now Tony didn’t have time to think, nor was he particularly capable of thinking clearly. He grabbed what he could with the others staring at him, utterly bewildered.
“Go on, Stark…” Hammer took a few paces, standing alarmingly close to Tony, whispering so that his cigarette singed breath touched Tony’s skin. Steve could smell the cigarette smoke on his breath from the floor and it made him cringe. “Break him… And feel that you’re breaking him, your friend… I want you to remember every second of this.”
“Where?” Steve asked, the sun beaming right into his face, forcing him to lower his visor on his cap.
Steve couldn’t see the downside unless he was being thrown into a trap, but right now he had no choice but to listen, knowing for well if he ran off he wouldn’t exactly know where to go.
It was now done; the gleaming armour, with silver scratches from the welding and golden faceplate was now his. It was full powered by his heart and it looked god damn beautiful as it caught the light. It was possibly his most streamlined armour to date—but that was probably because it had virtually nothing in it. Few weapons from when it was damaged, no shielding capabilities asides from its rough exterior – only a couple of lights, the rather non fancy LED’s.
Doom snapped his fingers and one of the suits of armour that stood by the side of the room began to move, shakily making its way over towards the fierce man stood in front of them. Tony held his hand up, ready to fire, tense with his shoulders raised. Steve had never seen Tony eye anything that intensely in his time with him; he knew then and there that Tony had a single priority and that was saving Reed. All the statue did was hold out a folder of papers which the inspector recognised instantly; the schematics for his original build that he’d stolen, all scrawled and scribbled over with Doom’s ‘improvements’.
Tony didn’t reply, he just stared at his foot then back up at Steve, “I… I really kissed you?” He asked.
“Put her…” Peter returned a tone just as bitter, “We can take her to the closed off park, it’s where the other superheroes have been put to rest.” He replied, refusing to look at the man who asked him the question.
Doom frowned under the mask and cleared his throat loudly, “As I was saying. After the accident they rebuilt me, they made me who I truly am. I was shed of my human skin and I was made into a GOD.” He stood up, hands sparking with electricity.
“You got it, boss!” Tony extended his hands down, into the car window as the moustached driver screamed with fear, not knowing what on earth was happening – seeing these two long robotic hands reach into his car and fiddle about with the steering wheel, but all that happened was Tony’s hands getting slapped away by quite powerful blows. The driver was clearly a martial artist of some sort, a small slap was enough to get Tony’s hands back, feeling the pain even though his limbs were metal.
Tony’s fingertips ran along the nape of Steve’s neck, trying to bury just under his collar. The second that Steve felt it, he reached blindly for the tie that was hanging loose around the billionaire’s neck, giving it one small tug before it fell to the ground. The faint chime of Steve’s dog tags filled the room as he moved.
The dark haired man rummaged through the set of wires, then there it was, the goldmine; a power panel. He pulled it out, examining it, turning it from side to side, reaching for his leg then opening it too after a tough tug of the metal plate he’d put over it to match his armour. It was a quick fix for him, but it’d do.
“Tigra and Luke… Danny got out lucky, but he’s gone somewhere else to deal with his own thing. Can’t imagine how much that was killing him…”
The memory of seeing his team engulfed by that explosion made him feel ill. He sat up and coughed, placing the seemingly newly acquired metal appendage over his mouth.
“It does…” His voice trailed as he leaned closer to Steve’s cheek, giving it a swift lick with the tip of his tongue, wiping away the blood. “…look like something.” The metallic flavour lingered on his taste buds. Tony licked his lips to display his satisfaction, before grinning such that all his teeth showed. His sharp canines were on display, dazzling in the artificial light around them.
“There’s no time to be sure,” Janet interrupted, using her stinger to cut the wires, drawing out the copper innards from the plastic casing and then placing them together as told.
Tony wasn’t a religious man but when good things happened, he needed to thank someone. After all, there weren’t many good things in his life, all considered. But Steve was one of the best things— no, he was
“You’re going down, pal, I won’t let you two stand after what you did to Tony!” Steve shouted with conviction.
Tony wanted to feel unbroken, he wanted to touch the man and for his heart to lift at every single utter.
That HURT. It really did. Tony was dazed, struggling to get up off the ground. He could hear parts of him pop out of place; unfortunately the impact was so hard that a couple of screws had fallen loose. Again the projection appeared above his head of birds singing and circling around the top of his hat while he smacked his glove, trying to get it to power up again to work but it kept morphing between a real looking hand and his red metal glove with the mechanism having fallen out of joint.
“You know, the thought crossed my mind but I dismissed it since he actually seemed as though he wanted to help. But you know as well as I do that he doesn’t help people out if there isn’t a price tag attached to it. It started with the rich customers but then he started offering his services to the public and you know, I’m no business student but…”
Now suspicions were at their highest. Carefully he stepped in, hands raised to his chin, readying himself to punch out whatever came at him.
“Tony, Tony!?” He shook the engineer’s shoulders. “Tony, wake up…” With worry he looked over his shoulder, trying to find the cause of the fallen man. All he could see was that huge suit with its eyes lit up, hanging from the work-chains. Then his eyes scoured the room to see the other suits all broken in pieces, which sent a spike of worry through Steve’s spine. They were once preserved, beautiful, and statuesque and now they were all shattered hollow shells of what they once were, every single one of them amounting to the pile of pieces that took up most of the floor.
Tony was pacing like a caged animal, walking back and forth. His black Armani shoes echoed a distinct clicking from the heel as he strode from one side of the lab to the other. His hand held his chin while his other patted his thigh, needing something to touch and play with.
All Tony could hear was mutters in that extremely strong Brooklyn accent. Tony could tell. Growing up on Long Island meant that he was used to hearing a particular accent, and Steve’s was definitely out of the blue – old school, strong, a hint of rough edge to each word, a slur. It had a hint of Woody Allen’s voice, or like the guy was straight out of ‘The Wise guys’. He’d always noticed it would flare up when Steve was concerned, and would return to its formal well pronounced accent when he was trying to deliver instructions. It was soothing, strangely.
“Take it off!!” It yelled, leaping at Tony and grabbing the mask, placing its palm firmly over the faceplate. “How dare you, HOW DARE YOU! You are mine, it does not deserve you! Only I, I am the only one!”  Tony could hear a loud crunch when the metal started to flex and bend, the vice-grip of the huge armour weighing down on the fragile plates. Tony fired the powerful unibeam from his chest, which made the suit flinch with a giant gaping hole, collapsing. But Tony didn’t have time to sit back and soak in his victory, not when he could hear the countdown ringing in his ears.
Their embraces were always like this – always more than just a hug, always more than just friends. There was something deep and profound they had, and it felt deeper than ever at that moment in time. He could feel Tony’s heartbeat against his chest, he could feel the soft buzz of his reactor, he could feel the gentle tremor of his lean, athletic body.
The man in the blue armour stared, a tiny smile over his own lips. “At least they went out together…”
He kept a grip of Tony’s hand, glad that he was there for support and most of all glad that he was back to normal. “We need to find the others.”
“Tony!” Steve called after him, struggling to run with the weight on his legs, but managing a firm, heavy footed jog inside, immediately covering his mouth to shield himself from the smoke. It was devastating to see what was once his home now collapsed and broken with nothing left.
T’challa stepped out of the scanner and decided to peer over Reed’s flailing limbs and began trying to evaluate the statistics himself. Tony sighed heavily as he placed the circuit board down completely and took a spot next to the two who seemed extremely perplexed by the results.
“I know but I guess angels can’t forget their roots, they can’t lose faith completely because they know that there’ll always be someone to save them, like a feeling in their heart that they can’t explain.” Steve’s hand drifted to Tony’s cheek and he held it lightly, his palm pressed against the man’s velvet skin.
“Yeah, silly.” Steve said with a chuckle, stepping closer to him with his wings fluttering happily at the statement and the wide dark blue eyes that stared back at him.
“I wouldn’t lie, especially when you know what this is. If I die, the memories go, just… Like… that.” He snapped his fingers, each pause making Tony’s heart skip a beat as the man neared the switch he held in his palm.
Steve reached for a kiss, his lips trailing along Tony’s lips, dancing over his patches of facial hair and crinkling his nose at the tickle of it.
Steve and Tony inched forward, Tony slamming the right door open with a punch, while Steve kicked the left door open and both practically fell inside with the power that they had used. The sirens above only intensified, and as they both turned to look at Janet and Natasha behind them, the doors were blocked by bars that flew down from the top frame of the door.
Now it was time for Tony to express how much he’d learned about Steve during their time together; Steve was always hesitant to fire his gun, unlike most of the partners that he’d had in the past, Steve didn’t have an itchy trigger finger. He preferred to defend and the way he conducted himself brought Tony back to his old history days and fantasies of being a knight, and no knight would be complete without a shield, which is what he provided Steve with.
“Mainly people we locked up, either they’re working for the security force here or sewer dwellers, and trust me, there’s not enough of us to take em out. They’d jump at the chance to kill us; we learned that the hard way. That’s how we lost… “
ever so loudly as they darted down the road. It was hard enough as it was trying to go past the metal posts; Tony had to quickly dodge from side to side to avoid the civilians that were walking down the streets who clearly the bad guy that he was chasing didn’t care about.
“Oh no, not missing a thing.” He whistled, shooting a sideward smirk in Steve’s direction which instantly brought the heat back up to the cops cheeks, nervously shifting and trying to divert his attention, before something really took a hold of it; there were loud sirens from behind him and flashing blue lights, but it wasn’t just one car, there were multiple cars that were nearing them, their icons flashing on the radar that was projected on the dashboard.
“Blood rush, I assume.” Tony mumbled, rubbing Steve’s back and sitting next to him, eyes fixed on him with concern. Even though he was focused on Steve he could feel the eyes of the others from behind the glass and wondered if this is how Steve had felt throughout the duration of his stay; watched, spied upon with little privacy. Instead he huddled Steve close, keeping him tight in his arms as though he were trying to protect him from the overlooking gaze of the others. He stayed there and pressed his faceplate to the side of Steve’s face. He desperately wanted to lift it and give him the reassurance he needed and much more, but he knew that Steve had to be completely cured before he could do that. Tony had faith in the transfusion and hoped that would work, hoping at that point was an understatement; he was actually close to praying it would work. He was sick of telling the others that they couldn’t come in to visit him because he knew that Steve would hate being seen in the state that he was, so having to lie to the other Avengers about Steve’s health was slowly tearing him apart as it was.
He was eager to see how the arm worked, and how Tony dismantled it and changed it. At least the skill would come in handy in the future, and honestly, a little education was nice after spending so long on the run.
Dark clouds swirled and loomed over one of the tallest buildings in New York City, the dark purple that they were tinged with growing darker closer to the building.  It certainly was a sight in itself to take in, with the shades of purple creating some sort of organised gradient. But luckily this allowed the others to spot where the main building was without a single doubt in their mind. The Mind Prism inside must have been creating the weather that had managed to span the entirety of the city.
The same went for Steve; he couldn’t stop staring at Tony’s flushed expression, his wide mouth, head back, his heaving built chest rising and slumping, calling out for
“Tony and I are one, we are the same. We share thoughts, and the conclusion is that you are out dated, and must be exterminated. Survival of the fittest. You are the original and now with a new and improved serum based upon your own, Tony and I shall be superior.” It spoke, throwing Steve back to the ground and kicking his stomach hard.
The systems had shut down the moment that Tony had commanded them to. By the time that they had finished eating the rest of the corpses in the room, they were able to make their way to the door. Tony scratched at the metal plates trying to open them. He knew that scratching would do no good, but when he tried to grab the handle like he normally would he found he was unable to – it was as though his brain wasn’t connecting with his body. He continued to rake his fingernails across the surface doing more damage to his once perfectly manicured nails than to the door itself.
Much longer was an understatement.  Panic stricken and in a hurry, he dashes down the stairs without putting on socks. Socks are over rated in his opinion anyway. But he stops as he reaches the bottom of the silver spiral staircase (which by the way makes you extremely dizzy if you run down at high speeds) and remains perched on the last step.
“Go go Stark jetpack!” This was something he wasn’t too keen on using, because the instant he said it he felt the armor from his legs spread up to his back, panels locking into place which took their time. Each fold in his armor locked into a 1 centimetre thick panel, but panel upon panel added more depth to the metal sheath over his body. Each clipped into place, two trapezoid shaped panels pushing their way further out and lighting up with blue as they’d form jets. When these jets lit they tore through the cloth of his neat trench coat that he valued ever so much, but it was the quickest way to get from point A to point B. With the back-jets formed they lit along with his feet, using his hand repulsors to balance himself as he flew quickly toward the fallen bot to absorb its power pack and regain the energy that he’d lost.
It was time to use the knowledge that Steve had instilled in him; think like your enemy. That’s how the man had saved him in the field many times, but had also gotten the upper hand when fighting him in the ring. It was only during the war that he had realised that it was one of the most important lessons that the Captain had ever taught him.
Whatever else he was going to say was cut off and Steve shouted something indiscriminate. He stared at the portal and gasped into the com, “Tony? Tony, can you hear me??”
“…Right,” Steve said, Steve stared dumbly at Happy for a moment as he processed his words. When he finally understood them and, saw that they were indeed back at the tower, he stated, “Thank you.”
Peter grinned and embraced Wade. He whispered to him, “Whenever you’re ready, I’m ready, but know I’ll always love you…”
Steve chuckled but fell silent as Tony grabbed the towel off the counter and scrambled to Steve’s side. He sat on the rim of the tub and his eyes raked over Steve’s form as if he had not just seen it when he stood before him seconds prior.
Since the invention of the soul implant, many accounted it with the ancient Greek belief, that everyone was born with only a partial soul and that your soul could only be whole with your mate’s other half. The soul implants were made to find your other half.
“I have it on me,” Peter replied with a grin. He couldn't wait to see their faces once Venom was in action.
“It’s just that you are a great guy and I know you still love Bucky and I don’t want you to feel as if I'm trying to get between that and –.”
Tony slipped over him and pressed him into the bed. He greedily kissed his mouth and Steve’s cock instantly popped up. Steve ran his hands through Tony’s hair with a slight moan and rubbed his body wantonly beneath Tony. Morning sex was his favorite kind.
Steve graciously accepted a mug of coffee from Tony and then patted the spot beside him. Tony took the silent cue and, with his own mug in hand, he pushed himself up onto the examination table next to Steve with a heavy sigh.
“No!” Peter stated, “Everything has been relatively peaceful! I have no idea why Wade would bring you here! He’s risking the future!
Howard had no time to contemplate his notebook's part in all of this because, before he knew it, the tesseract had been found. He personally went out with his team to retrieve it.
Steve didn’t wait for him to come to a complete stop. He slid out of the car as it was slowing to a roll and went straight into the tent with Tony in his arms. There were already some soldiers laid out on small cots, groaning or biting their lips as the medics looked over them. Steve’s eyes quickly spanned the tent and then fell on his friend. He practically sprinted toward Gabe and called out, “Jones! I need your help!”
The rest of breakfast was quiet as usual but the atmosphere was different. She finally felt comfortable with him.
“It seems she kept our disposed of samples,” Tony explained as diplomatically as he could when referring to his and the rest of the male team’s masturbation habits.
fair. The employees and their kids loved to see them. Sunday night was always their biggest night. Were they going to bail out on it in order to get married?
“Perfect!” Tony gasped. “I will talk to him right now!” Tony spun around and spotted Bucky leaning against a wall on the opposite side of the room. He was watching the kids play and looking miserable. Tony called out, “HEY! ROBOCOP! You, me, balcony, right now.”
As Peter took a hot shower, Wade went onto Peter’s tablet and pulled up the storage app where he and Peter saved all their photos. He swiped through them and each photo drew him back in time as he remembered each instance. There were birthdays, holidays, or just lazy days.
Steve suddenly wrenched himself away from Tony and any clue or semblance that he was going to kiss him, came from the brush of hot breath wafting over Tony's lips and the cooling of the front of his body where Steve had been pressed against him.
“It’s just the way you two are around each other. I can’t explain it but, even though I spent only a few minutes with you two, I felt a connection between you two that was deeper than friendship.”
Steve’s heart seized with worry, but Bucky assured them both, “You probably have a concussion. That’s normal.”
Tony was put under but it felt like he only closed eyes for a few seconds and, when he reopened them, he was in a whole other room and Steve was carding his fingers into Tony’s again.
The darkness was immediate and that edge of fear was still there, but it was overwritten with the knowledge that he had survived the impossible and his soulmate would be there soon.
“Looks like Spidey picked off the last bot in the north,” Tony stated into the comms. The only bots on the scene were smoking wrecks.
“What to do think?” Steve asked, wrapping his arms around the smaller man. Steve stooped his head toward Tony as Tony smirked.
“B-Buc –,” Steve murmured, he reached out and brushed the tips of his fingers along Bucky’s arm. All emotion left Bucky’s face and he stared at Steve blankly. He clutched both sides of his head and stared starkly at Steve.
They hurried to the elevator and Steve chortled as Tony tugged on his arm. They entered the lift at a run and crashed into the wall and each other. They erupted into a laughing mess as Jarvis wordlessly moved the elevator for them.
He pulled back out of the embrace and Bucky’s gaze flickered from Steve to Natasha then settled on his lap. His expression was unreadable but his eyes were stormy again.
Steve rolled his eyes and said, “I’m still trying to adjust to the fact that I am his father. He also has other family…Not on Mary’s side but Richard’s…I think I want Peter to get to know them. I just don’t know where to begin…”
As those thoughts rolled through Steve’s head, Tony made it all perfect as he whispered into Steve’s lips, “Love you.”
Peter leaned into him with a sigh and let him rock him. He was a little unhappy that Wade’d still be breaking the law and hurting people, but…Wade was willing to make a huge change in his life for him. And maybe, overtime, he’d start to take on less and less "illegal" work. For now, Peter could accept Wade may have to break the law. Heck, Spider-Man was considered a vigilante since he wasn’t signed up with any government sponsored team so he was technically breaking the law every time he donned his mask.
Peter’s heart squeezed and he had to pinch his lips tightly together to keep his automatic smile from blossoming. Aunt May liked Wade...
When they next returned to the dreamworld, Steve could tell by the depth to the bags under Tony’s eyes that he had pulled an all-nighter…Maybe two all-nighters…
Bruce and Tony seemed to be having a similar silent conversation except Bruce wore one, very readable expression that could be promptly read as: “Are you shitting with me?” Tony’s answering, haughty expression was “Shut up!
Natasha met Clint in the lobby and held up her phone to him so he can see the image on the screen. He’d just arrived, having come all the way from Brooklyn.
“Makes perfect sense in the future,” Tony replied with airs, making Steve roll his eyes. He'd been using that excuse to get away with things for days. Steve strangely rolled with it. It unnerved Tony at first but it was how Steve was. He rolled with whatever was given him and Tony had fun with it. Tony asked, “So when are the Commandos moving out?”
“Okay,” Tony murmured, taking it all in stride. His heart was pounding furiously and a slight sliver of fear was stabbing into it but Tony was easily able to ignore it because Thor and his hammer were there.
He went straight to the elevator and could hear Clint grilling Natasha on all the details about what happened. As he stepped in the elevator he asked Jarvis, “Is Tony still in his workshop?”
Once they were inside, Tony pushed him to the bed and Steve willingly stumbled back a few steps and fell back on the bed. He never removed his eyes from Tony as Tony sauntered in front of him.
In his sleepy state, it hadn’t occurred to him that Dum Dum might be a little shocked to see his one time leader back from the dead on Entertainment Tonight as the hosts gossiped about Tony’s mysterious new lover.
Steve’s eyes darted all over the dark chrome machine. It was built humanoid in nature with arms, legs, fingers, even two eyes, though they glowed with a faint white light. He noted the robot had a marker on its chest though he could not make any sense to what “MK 15” could’ve meant.
A number of emotions went through him but he stayed rooted to where he was sitting and strangled his fingers together. Steve walked over to him in concern and Tony watched every movement like a frightened animal.
Steve took a deep breath and transferred his hands to Tony’s hips as he smiled up at him. He whispered, “You
Steve’s voice trembled slightly as he commanded, “G-Gabe, we need privacy. Bucky go – go get Tony’s toolbox from Panzer. And Peggy…” He turned to her and she looked at him with a plainly shocked expression. “Go find Iron Man.”
“Awesome, target Big Bird and fire away,” Tony said, looking up to his opponent with a smirk. The missile fired and the Vulture tried to scramble away but he got only a few flaps in before the missile hit one of his wing turbines, totally destroying the wing. The man plummeted to the ground and probably only survived thanks to the second wing slowing him down…a little. He doubted he was going to be getting up anytime soon.
Tony smiled and he looked over his shoulder to where Peter sat on the couch with a new controller in his hands. Tony whispered, “He’s a smart kid. I just wish he would see himself as
He let Tony pull him in the direction of his bedroom by his wrist. Tony did not pause for pretty words or give him another kiss. He pushed Steve onto his bed and stared at him with hungry eyes. Steve was naked only from the waist up but he felt completely naked the way Tony was looking at him. Steve’s gut churned nervously but he licked his bottom lip in eager preparation of kissing Tony everywhere: lips, neck, torso, dick, and ass. He was going to taste him in every way possible just like he always dreamed. He just hoped he would not make a fool of himself…
Eddie swallowed his water thickly and, without meeting his eyes, replied, “You shouldn’t…you don’t have to thank me, Peter…”
Bruce was the foremost expert in gamma-radiation and the only other person alive other than Peter to survive the exposure to it. Bruce had been Peter’s doctor ever since SHIELD found him. Steve would not trust Peter to anyone else but his friend’s capable hands.
Tony mostly attributed it to missing Steve, but he assumed part of it was also but to the effect of tight bandages around his chest. Tony had only been able to give himself rudimentary sponge baths underneath his sleeping bag to muffle the light of his arc reactor. His skin was sensitive around his reactor and he could still kinda see those odd lines around it. He couldn’t get a good look at it without leaving his sleeping bag because then his reactor would illuminate his tent with its blue light and everyone in the vicinity would know something peculiar was happening within it.
“We’re all okay…scared but fine,” Howard replied with a heavy sigh. He sat down and leaned into his head as he whispered, “You were right, Peggy. All those years ago I didn’t listen and it almost cost me
Peter wanted to sleep with Wade. It wouldn't be tonight and probably not even tomorrow but, eventually,
He tossed the empty bottle over his shoulder as he left the lab. Dummy would pick it up or set it ablaze, either way it would be disposed of.
Their friends did as they were told, even though most did it begrudgingly, and Steve, Peter, Bruce, and Tony made their way down to the lab.
Grinning cheekily, Tony turned back to the Captain and put his hands on his hips with a heavy sigh. “If I wasn’t meeting my soulmate in a month, I’d be all over that.”
Tony glanced up and raised a single eyebrow, past the rim of his goggles, as he asked, “Are you hinting that I should be doing the same?”
“I-It’s something he should know,” Bruce interceded. “But – I – You- You have a son…” He gasped the last bit, his voice layered with surprise.
To answer Bucky’s question, he took the phone off of mute and said, “Uhhh, Dum Dum, Steve wasn’t the only one to survive…”
“Me too,” Steve stated breathlessly. He laughed, feeling giddy and gasped, “I can’t believe this is happening.”
The amount of press outside their building more than halved itself after a terrorist attack on a United States military station in Afghanistan. A man calling himself “The Mandarin” hijacked US networks and took credit for the act. Clint and Natasha were immediately called in by SHIELD to assist in looking for him and Tony had Jarvis trying to follow the traces left by the broadcast hackings.
Tony rubbed his crotch into Steve’s hand and murmured, “I can’t possibly rise to the occasion right now, but later, I might be able to assist you in that.”
Despite his spasming muscles, Wade let go of Venom and reached out to Peter. He grasped Peter’s face and begged, “
“J, I’m stepping out I need to look at your hardware!” The suit opened and Tony jumped out. His eyes instantly went to the chest shield and saw Stark and Son was gone…but MK 15 was still not there.
Tony was clearly no longer talking about Wade and Peter. Steve turned back to him stared deeply into Tony’s eyes and carded his fingers through Tony’s hand as he clenched it more securely. He promised, “As will I…”
Hulk loosed one of his meaty hands around Schmidt and then slammed him into the wall before he could finish.
Bucky actually looked like he wanted to argue that for a second, but he must have taken it as a command because he remained silent.
They kissed again and Steve grasped Tony’s hips to press their bodies as tightly together as their lips. Tony groaned into his mouth and Steve dug his fingers deeper into Tony’s flesh.
She knew the exact moment he noticed the metal object because Peter stopped breathing. She heard him sit up sharply on the bed and imagined him looking around the room for the source of the object. He settled down and she could just barely hear the light dragging sound of the flesh of his finger as it brushed against the metal. It was quickly followed by the light popping sound of Peter briefly kissing it and then laying back down onto the bed.
“Hi,” Peter’s voice still broke but this time it was from a combination of being dry and overwhelmed with emotion as he stared into Wades beautiful blue eyes. He muttered, “Do I really look bad?”
“I love our kind of stuff,” Tony murmured as sexily as possible. Which was hard as there was the non-sexy feeling of sand irritating his ass crack. He pulled the super soldier into the water. Waves crashed around them and the tide pushed and pulled at their bodies.
As his muscles untensed, Tony recognized the car too and now knew why Jarvis told him to sit down. This was footage of the night of his parents’ deaths. Tony grabbed onto Pepper tightly with his other hand and she unquestionably held onto him with both hands too.
Steve refused to let go of him the entire night…but, come morning, Tony was torn from his arms like he was every time his soulmate woke…like he always will.
Eventually, Tony’s phone dinged, alerting them to their time being up. The noise woke Peter, who mumbled unhappily from lack of sleep.
“Oh…” Steve looked up from the glow and saw Tony smiling at him. He flushed with embarrassment. Steve loved new things, especially the impossible. This man was the living embodiment of it and Tony clearly noted his wonder.
Tony flew faster than he ever had before. It was reckless and was pushing his repulsors but he had to get to Steve.
Tony opened his eyes, his gaze looked a little fevered, but he groaned heartily when he saw who had joined him.
Tony’s eyelids dropped a fraction and his hooded eyelashes shadowed Tony’s eyes similarly to the first time Steve noticed it. Steve felt himself relax into his familiar, warm gaze. Tony lightly ran his hands up Steve’s chest and wrapped his hands behind his neck.
“So I agreed to go out with him before he could back out and it was the smartest thing I could have ever done with my life,” Steve stated, smiling at Tony. Tony returned the grin and leaned forward with a kiss. Tony’s lips were warm against his and so familiar. He could still remember that day he asked him out so easily but he could have never imagined the depths of his emotions he would feel toward this man.
Minutes prior, Marcel had pulled him aside and told him the mountains of favor towards Steve’s defense was a very good sign. He did not want to make any promises but he heavily alluded to their winning the trial.
Peter fell into his side as the bed shifted under Tony’s weight. Peter was still clutching his phone and Tony saw all of the unopened notifications. Tony asked, “Have you gone online yet?”
Steve jumped to his feet with a grin, he knew that jerk’s voice anywhere. He turned around to find Bucky and Natasha standing at the lab entrance with their luggage.
A hush had fallen over the victors and everyone’s gazes were full of hurt and pity and pointed in one direction.
Steve blushed deeply upon hearing the sincerity in his voice. He did not feel sexy he actually felt like a clumsy huge mass of muscles, uncoordinated with unsure hands strangling the sheets. He felt so exposed and huge without his clothes and Tony's eyes only added to his insecurities. Tony made no move to touch him. Steve squirmed and mumbled nonsense under his breath, trying to mask his uncomfortableness.
After she left, it was late afternoon, and she had unhappily agreed to help him with investigating Obadiah. The sun would be setting in another hour and that meant Enigma may run by for his second scheduled jog. Despite being exhausted, Tony was still too curious about Enigma to pass up the opportunity to see him again.
, Tony,” Steve whispered, letting his fingers stray to Tony’s hair. He ran his hands through the younger man’s hair for a moment and remembered doing so when he was a child…but Tony was a child no longer. He’d grown up into one of the most amazing men Steve had ever met.
“I’ve got to,” Steve whispered in reply. He ran his hands over Peter’s brittle cheeks and placed his forehead to Peter’s. Their eyes met, blue meeting blue. Steve’s stare was steady and Peter’s eyes were beginning to water.
“…James,” she whispered her voice sounded small as it was being crushed by the weight of all her grief and lost years. “His name was James.”
Wade lightly tapped the front door with his back without looking at it and it closed with a gentle click.
Tony and Steve shuffled over to the front door, putting on their hats and glasses to hide their identities from the general public.
None of it mattered to Tony because his heart had been torn out of his chest and was going to be buried in the casket with his husband.
Peter looked up at Wade in shock. More people knew he was Spider-Man than knew he was Tony’s son and he almost let it slip to Wade.
“What happened?!” Steve demanded and interrupted. Tony’s right side was drenched in blood and it stood out starkly on his white shirt.
She slowly inhaled and then stated in an even voice, “Are you going to just stare at me or are you going to help me up?”
Steve smirked and all thoughts on his other life vanished. Even if he had used the fake name, he wouldn’t have been able to live a quiet life, his shield was proof enough. Steve grasped his defensive weapon and slipped it on to his arm. It was a part of him and without it he felt helpless.
Fury tilted his head to the side as he looked them over and then he stated, “Either the two of you got some hair dye and Botox and found a way to teleport here in time to save Spidey or I am dealing with more damn clones? You two are supposed to be on the other side of the solar system right now.
Peter shook his head and murmured, “No, don’t bother him or Steve…I don’t want them worrying about me…”
Steve thought himself totally lost to the moment until the door opened and he jolted up with the sound. Tony jumped back too, more from Steve’s reaction, and released his cock with a pop. Tony spun on his knees to face the source of the sound: Pepper.
Peter was whimpering but had yet to start crying. When Steve scooped him up Peter sighed and relaxed against him. He grasped Steve’s dog tags and clutched them tightly. He fell asleep in an instant, with his dog tags still in his grip, but Steve did not put him down. He wrapped his arms protectively around his son and ventured back into the living room.
Beyond the doors, he could hear his dad. He knew it was his dad, he recognized his voice, but he had never once heard him make such noises. What had happened?? What was wrong??
“I want to kiss you again,” Tony stated and fear raced through Steve. He stared incredulously at Tony and slowly shook his head.
No matter how much Steve wanted to look on the brighter side, he became tenser and more contemplative as the first day of his trial approached. Tony would find Steve staring off into space with a hard gaze and looking irrevocably alone. Tony hugged him every time he saw Steve get that look to drag him back to reality and he’d remind him, “I love you.”
Ben and May Parker lived in a very quaint house in a suburban Queens neighborhood. It was small, two-story house that looked with its ranch-style it looked like it had been built in the 1970s. It had a large flower bed in front of it and a nice manicured lawn. The front door was open to let in fresh air through the wrought iron screen door. The door opened up to a porch, it was in the need of a new paint job and three, uneven stairs led up to the porch a few feet from the sidewalk.
Howard rolled with it, pretending he was unaffected, and asked Tony about his speech. Their conversation was stilted and Howard was relieved when Peggy stole Tony to tease him on his growing goatee.
Peter picked up his step and turned on his music as soon as he entered his room before he could hear anymore. He fell back onto his bed, chuckling to himself. Those two were always ridiculously affectionate but he was happy to see this media storm didn't change that aspect of their lives. Even though it was awkward as hell, it also made his heart feel lighter. His parents still could find joy in all of this chaos...maybe Peter can do the same.
She went down the hall and said, “Barnes, you drive a hard bargain, but I’ll take it.” To Steve and Tony, she called over her shoulder, “Enjoy the sex, guys!”
They parked in the garage and Tony was ready to run upstairs and immediately start making love to his super soldier.
He held Peter up and got a good look at him. Peter jutted his lip out and his face scrunched up with frustration. He had the same hazel eyes and dark brown hair and…his face, even though he was so young, there was no denying it. It was his future son…no, not future, it was the present day and he was holding the same boy he and Tony were going to adopt.
He started to smile again and it made Tony more wary of the man. He hadn’t seen his father smile this much growing up like he just did in the last hour. Their eyes met and Howard’s smile didn’t waiver and it took all of Tony’s will not to look away.
Natasha was the first to move. Her first few steps were obviously forced as she did not want to take them but as she started moving, she started gaining momentum. She walked with purpose and hit Tony on the neck with a light jab and Tony’s eyes rolled into the back of his head and he slumped forward. Natasha caught him then slung him over her shoulder like Bucky had done with Peter. Natasha had tears falling from her eyes and she turned to Steve and she nodded curtly to him.
Without any urging from them, she murmured, “I remember going into labor but I do not remember the birth…They had tied me down and pumped me full of drugs. The next thing I remember is someone holding a gun to my head and pulling the trigger.” She touched the side of her head, where the injury must have occurred hidden beneath her hair, and murmured, “I later woke in a dumpster, buried beneath a pile of garbage. I was groggy but I knew I could not go to SHIELD. They were the ones that tried to kill me, and the Parkers would have been under watch to make sure they knew nothing…The only one I could trust to help me, and not to go to the police, was Osborn. And he’s let me stay here ever since…”
Beyond the barricades, were reporters but everyday citizens were there as well. One side held supporters, holding signs proclaiming their backing, and on the other side was a gathering of protestors against him. It was the latter group Steve’s eyes focused on. They were already worked into a frenzy and chanting for his conviction. They held signs calling for him to abdicate his shield and saying he was going to hell.
He laid the album on top of Steve Roger’s business card and then got off the couch. He went straight to his room, tossed his mask on his bed, and then opened his laptop. The internet tab was already open with an article about applied sciences which he wanted to read. Peter ignored it and typed into his search box: ‘Parker and Stark.’
Tony recognized the alarm as being an outside priority and was somewhat gratified that the current tower reconstruction would not need additional construction.
He stopped altogether when he came across the pieces to the circular placard that had been around it.
“Proof that Tony Stark has a heart,” Steve sadly quoted and then ran his fingertips over the word “heart.” With this proof of Tony’s ability to love, Tony would survive and then fall in love with Steve.
“Yeah…Sorry about that. Think of it as a compliment. You’re hot and my body is letting you know it’s excited to be touching you,” Tony said with a cocky smile to disguise his fear. Was he pushing Steve too much? Was going to destroy their friendship in the end?
Steve laughed, drawing a smile to Tony’s lips and stopping his tirade. The older man grinned sincerely and whispered, “I thought I was going to never hear that beautiful sound again…”
As their audience screamed excitedly, the Avengers came on stage wearing their best and Steve’s priest crossed the stage to stand with them.
He opened his arms and Steve stepped into them. Embracing Iron Man was a whole lot different than Tony. His hold was cold, hard, and strong but beneath it all was the man Steve was coming to love. He lay his cheek against the warm arch reactor in Tony’s chest and closed his eyes. Iron Man took off with a sudden jolt and Steve tightened his hold on his fellow Avenger.
Steve was a little thrown off by the request. He expected to go right to kissing. Handholding was so…innocent. But then again Steve was flinching at the simplest of touches…He flushed maybe this practice was not going to be the raging make out session he was imagining it to be.
Steve was sitting next to a slumbering Tony and holding his hand. A couple of days had passed since he last spoke with her, but no amount of time spent in Tony's presence could stop the draw of destiny.
“Oh, but there is a way out…” The Goblin looked to where Steve, Tony, and Peter stood and then laughed, “I just wanted to see your faces when I destroy your timeline and lives right in front of you.”
Tony merely buried his face deeper into Steve’s stomach and hoped he wasn’t too late to salvage his relationship with his son.
“Oh, please shut up now! That is not what I was asking!” Peter groaned, burying his face in his hands. This conversation just took a turn down a very dark corridor. He sighed heavily and looked at his step-father. He murmured, “I think I’m interested in…a man.”
Tony was the strongest man he knew but that did not change the fact that Steve was weak. He was torn between what he had with Tony and what he had wanted with Bucky.
They shared a moment, simply staring at each other. Peter was the first to break eye contact and looked away with a slight flush. Wade caught his chin, preventing him from completely looking away.
Tony had enough time to inhale sharply before Jarvis reacted to the breach in his personal security. Following the security protocols, the suit lifted its arm faster than Tony would have ever been able to do and delivered a sharp blast to the face of the man who was about to kill him.
Still leaning into the wall, Steve closed his eyes and began to stroke himself as he imagined himself with Tony. This time Steve returned the kiss in the latent memory and Tony pressed his body into Steve’s. They opened their mouths to each other and Tony’s hand found its way into Steve’s pants.
of his dirty secrets. She knew about the monster of a crush Steve harbored toward Tony. Steve tried to tell Natasha everything with one look and her responding expression was for him to provide actual answers pronto. He nodded but kept his mouth shut, indicating they were going to talk in private.
Steve sleepily rubbed his back and murmured in a whisper, “Next time we should fall asleep on something cushioned like the couch or a bed.”
Steve immediately ran toward the noise and he was soon followed by the rest of the Avengers, including Bruce who was growing larger by the second.
“Well I hope so since you’ve told me you love me a dozen times now,” Tony retorted with a happy grin. He had dropped his tablet and it lay forgotten at his side.
Steve strolled in, fresh from a shower. His very presence relieved some of his stress. Tony reached out to him and Steve wordlessly fell into his side. More stress melted away and Tony sighed into Steve's shoulder.
“Follow my lead,” Tony said. He squared his shoulders and yelled to the gathered crowd, “Ladies and gentlemen!” He caught their attention as everyone around them froze and Tony, grinning like a madman, gasped, “Go! Go!
“Unfortunately my human interior was,” was the brisk reply, Steve could hear the clipped amusement in his gravely robotic voice. Steve flushed. He hadn't realized there was a human in that thing, nonetheless Howard’s relation. Stark continued, “The exoskeleton was made by me, his son. Tony Stark.”
-!” Tony yelled, his voice growing tighter from his grief. Tony ripped his arm from Natasha’s hold and stepped away from Barnes, facing the one wall with no one to see him break. Tony slammed the wall with both of his fists and fell into the wall with a cry. Almost like a toddler having a tantrum, he repeatedly hit the wall. He embraced his anger and kept hitting the wall because, he knew if he embraced the despair, he’d curl into a ball and cry for days on end. As it was, he already felt like a hand had plunged into his heart to tear it out of his chest and all that was left behind was a bleeding crater.
“D-Don’t make noises like that, baby boy,” Wade gasped, kissing the side of his face as he spoke. “I’m barely sane as it is and your mouth alone has taken me to the edge. You start making noises like that and I’ll go totally crazy.”
Steve did exactly what he would’ve done in the past when he needed to get some where far and fast with no cash.
Peter quickly sat up and nearly ran out of the room. His dad had been pulling all-nighters in the lab and Peter felt like he had barely seen him the last fewdays. He felt uneasy when he was not around for long periods and irrationally feared losing him too.
Steve was thrust into a dreamscape with no definition, just violent red and black colors clashing together and Tony screaming and struggling against an invisible opponent.
This was not a dream. Dear God, it was real. His heart stopped beating and rolled down to his stomach where it landed heavily.
Peter snorted and leaned into Wade as he said, “Pops, you remember Wade? And Wade, well, you also remember Steve but you clearly would like to get to know his apron more…”
“I’m surprised I didn’t hear about it! Usually when an American goes missing everyone knows within the minute it happens! And I can’t believe America doesn’t have half its armed forces searching for you already! I will get you the phone! Wait here!”
Afterwards, they sat together, facing each other, Tony’s legs draped over Steve’s thighs, their cocks nestled together side-by-side in the space between them, and their hands covered in suds cleaning every inch of each other. They never stopped kissing each other, whether it was their mouths or kissing the other’s skin.
“No,” Tony said and shook his head. “You know I don’t like to take things to help me sleep. They always make me groggy for too long.”
your family, Peter especially. He’d do anything to not only kill Peter but torture him along the way…”
Ben asked, “Why haven’t you contacted May or I? We listed you and Richard as dead. Where have you been all these years?”
Steve grasped his shoulder and nodded, hoping Tony was right. He closed eyes and prayed they wouldn’t be too late.
“Well now that we found you, Natasha and I will probably go back to following any leads we have on the Mandarin,” Clint speculated.
Unknown to him, on the other side of the country, those sky-blue eyes opened for the first time in over seventy years.
Tony greedily took in Steve’s nude form. The man was a work of art. He had run his hands countless over it but would never get enough of it.
The Iron Patriot nodded and silently walked up the stairs, sliding past the President into the airplane. The President waved one last time to the white house photographers before following Rhodes back into the plane.
“It’s Extremis,” Tony explained grimly, also getting to his feet. He explained, “It is a compound that is highly unstable. It makes people crazy strong, able to heal from anything, and flammable…so flammable they can explode. Kilian’s the real Mandarin, not the one on TV. He’s been using these people as his bombs…He pumped Pepper full of it to get to me…Rhodey can you and Jarvis handle these goons out here, while I go save Pepper?”
He cooked and prepared the coffee with military efficiency and gave the meal as much attention as he would give battle plans. It helped in distracting him from his headache.
Steve let Tony pull him away and sadly watched the back of his head. He did not look away from him, even as they stepped outside and people were yelling questions at them and the flash of cameras nearly blinded them. Tony tightened his hold on Steve’s hand and lifted his other hand to wave at the reporters.
“Never! You’ll never catch me alive!” The driver said, twirling the tips of his moustache and laughing maniacally, swerving the car straight into Steve’s. The old car was already suffering and Steve knew for well that it wouldn’t withstand battering from a much newer import.
spotted, we’d have to abort the mission and ask Strange to wipe their minds for us…” Steve held a hand to his chin for a moment. “We’re not exactly
Steve was walking the hallways because he’d just had a dream which rendered him unable to sleep; a loud booming voice, “Find the angel, find the angel, return him home, find the angel.” The voice repeated in his head over and over. It had gotten to a point where it was getting so loud that he jumped as he woke up. It wasn’t the first time he’d had that dream either, it was reoccurring and had become more frequent as of late. He couldn’t just ignore it so he continued to think about it as he walked along the empty hallways, with everyone sound asleep.
Tony’s eyes instantly welled up with tears as he stared with disbelief, his entire body shaking with fear as he braced himself for his punishment. Whatever ‘this’ was, he didn’t look happy at all. He stared at him with icy eyes that could stare right into his soul to see how baron it had become.
Loud explosions nearby, the commandos taking the ground, the smell of soot in the air and gunpowder even this high up in the air.
“This is the last one, I promise you. It’s me programming things and sometimes it doesn’t go according to plan. Sometimes you have to get injured to learn from your mistakes.” He didn’t want to tell him that the bot he was working on, that was once sentient, was rejecting the AI that he was trying to install to override the old one, that whenever Tony was close to it, it would knock him away with those powerful iron fists. He couldn’t explain that to him, because he was desperate to fix it. If Tony made a mistake he would do everything in his path to try and repair it, or live in constant regret, it was simple. This was his problem,
Then they finally reached it, after traversing the city, with no malfunctions so far in his basic suit which was a plus. Things seemed to be working well, even better since his power supply seemed regulated and the suit was moving in sync.
“I just must’ve hit a few parts, they need fixing…” he reassured them, even though it was the sound of his loud heart beating against some of his metal components. He’d never heard it do that before, in fact it felt strange, but whenever he so much as looked at Steve, admiring those sharp azure eyes and the way that a few rogue strands of blond would poke out from his perfectly formed coif, he felt that same beating. He just had to make sure it wouldn’t drum loudly like that; the last thing he wanted was for anyone to be concerned about his functionality.
“We’ve created something Tony.” Hank spoke soberly. “Reed theorized a formula that should help incapacitate him, even as he is. It’s more than enough to knock
It was so good to have him back. He couldn’t explain how much he had missed him in those short moments. Pleading to Tony’s humanity was often a painful thing to do, but regardless, it had brought him back to his senses.
“Just fine!” Thor replied in a booming voice over the radio that could’ve possibly deafened Steve. He was busy covering Carol, and ensuring that the canons and drones that flew up toward her were being taken care of, while she was doing her fair share of machine throttling. Cap made a mental note to turn down the volume whenever he was talking to Thor and led the others forward.
“Team?” The signal was still filled with static. “Team, your opponents, they’re probably under the influence of the Purple Man, I don’t know why, or how— “
As much as Steve wanted to have faith in the man that he held his heart out to, he realised after a few days that the entire situation was becoming bleak, and perhaps there was no way to recover. He had though that he was getting better all this time but actually seeing what he had become began to trigger more inside him, he could feel himself changing, he could feel his memories fading one by one.
A sense of relief washed over Tony’s face and he placed his palm firmly on Steve’s muscle clad shoulder. “You’ll be running in no time, Cap.”
“Hey Steve, I also… Noticed that you were into drawing, the way you doodle constantly in the car when we’re on patrol, and you know NYC has plenty of art galleries open. What say we head to one, one day?”
Tony began to talk as they walked through time, walking from the prehistoric to current day, spending a particularly long amount of time on the moon landing section where Steve just seemed absolutely wonderstruck. Tony had to explain that his own trips to space were rather frequent, but his explanation turned into bragging.
After arriving in record time (as per usual) back to the mansion in NYC, Steve was taken to the medical bay for a routine check-up. He seemed completely fine, considering the horrors Zola had put him through in that lab... He stood up well, he had regained his strength after having the time to rest in Tony’s arms, and he was all cleaned up almost the moment they had touched down at HQ. Routine checks were always tedious, especially for Steve, who knew that he would heal one way or another thanks to the serum that was flowing through his veins. In truth, he hated being treated after the amount of time he had spent in hospitals as a child due to his numerous ailments. Although his mother was a nurse (which brought an element of comfort to whatever procedures were necessary after being surrounded by medical knowledge even at home) he resented the fact he was so sick as a child because he knew of the toll that it had taken on his parents and their relationship. Hospitals were never cheap, nor was medicine in a day where even bread was considered a luxury. The Great Depression was one of the hardest times to grow up in, and even more so for a family that were struggling with a perennially sick child. That resentment of those days had carried through to this era, and though it may not have been as relevant in this day and age, the memories continued to linger. After all, perhaps if he could have afforded it, he could’ve helped save his own sick mother by giving her the care she needed. He was grateful for the healthcare now, and adored the science and innovation behind it all particularly with the results that were being produced with Stark’s move into healthcare and the massively improved quality of it all in recent days, but he hated being the one sitting in the hospital bed getting poked and prodded by needles. The amount of times that Steve had been captured and thrown on medical tables to have samples extracted so he could be cloned or the serum could be replicated was countless. Whenever he would walk into a room as cold and sterile as the medical bay was it would send shivers up his spine, so he would try and rush the process by complying.
“Is the pot calling the kettle black?” Steve flashed exactly the same smirk behind the screen, unknowingly mirroring Tony.
Steve lurked around the mansion, going from room to room to establish the situation. It wasn’t laundry day, no sir. According to his internal calendar laundry day wasn’t until two day’s time, and JARVIS wouldn’t let the sheets leave the mansion, there was a strong system in place.
To this day, he held a grudge, trying to parry the guilt off himself toward the sniper, although he knew Steve would have never been in that position if it hadn’t been for his action. Blame or not, that was something he had never forgotten. Tony Stark wasn’t afraid to kill. He didn’t like doing it, but he would if he was driven to the extreme. His eyes narrowed, his position crouched ready to obey his instinct when he caught sight of Cap slumped in that corner. He had to move to protect him, but Crossbones seemed to have no intent of going toward Captain America, which was strange. Still, he tried to sidle toward the Captain with tiny sideward steps.
“I’m not even down there and it smells disgusting. I don’t remember sewers smelling this bad! You’d think with the lack of chilli-dogs and vendors that this thing would smell way better.”
At one point, he was sure that he could hear Hammer laughing. He tried his hardest to open his eyes, to get some sense of perspective, but he could see nothing but shadows moving above him. It was a violent and excruciating pain that snapped him back to consciousness; two metal blades edged just over his shoulder, large metal machines with their buzz saws at the ready to push down. Even with the smallest pressure the blades were tearing at his exposed skin that the saws had already cut to – having buzzed through his protective shoulder shell.
Terms of endearment in that satin voice made Steve eager to continue, grazing his lips at first against Tony, but the billionaire wouldn’t have just that. His arms slithered around Steve’s neck and he pulled him forward, eager to be satisfied. His legs spread and he could feel the way that Steve’s entire body pulsed against his own, particularly down by his hips. The soldier was stiff, and feeling him rut up against him even with that thin barrier of clothing between them sent surges of pleasure up his spine, searching for more.
“Chief!” Tony waved enthusiastically at Fury, happily jogging to his side with a smug smirk plastered over his face, Steve joining his side whilst Carol and the others stood by the side-lines after explaining to Fury what had happened. Those bots wouldn’t have been stopped without Steve and Tony’s help.
Now he fell away from him, falling faster and faster, soaring through the sky as his eyes stared at the man he had grasped. His reactor flickered from trying to distribute the power, his repulsors dimmed.
Soon his vision focused on the other man who sat in the corner of the quarantine room. His clothing was torn; the blue t-shirt with a once white star was now tainted with red and grey. The torn trousers were now worn at the knees, the dog tags hung around his neck. Everything was utterly in shambles. Steve’s body twitched as though he were flinching at the constant pains his body was going through with the changes. His pale eyes even more sunken in with his cheekbones and jaw appeared far more angular and protruded ominously. Dark black varicose veins threaded throughout the plains of Steve’s once glowing skin to make it look much more lifeless than Tony had ever seen him.
“He’s going to have to make me a brand new suit and get me a new set of wheels for me to forgive him this time.” Rhodey joked, as serious as the situation was, but it helped. After all, the Commandos would do exactly the same thing, even in the darkest situations, as much as they made jokes, they took the situation extremely seriously.
Peter shook his fist at Tony and then let out a huff, quickly raising his shoulders again as there was another devastating sound of impact from above. “We should help them.”
Tony knelt down, feeling some sort of resistance in his body. He could see hazy images of his head; he and Steve standing on a rooftop together, Steve with his hand on Tony’s shoulder, giving that stare that he could never forget… So filled with warmth, love, affection, tenderness – Steve.
Steve stood defiant to complete submission, but replied with a comfortable grin that could be interpreted as psychotic as he too leaned closer to the veneer. “Do you want to pass up on a valuable asset? That is my question in return, Tony.”
There the man lay, muscular, beautiful, despite all of the technological enhancement, staring up with powerful eyes and that powerful expression. Steve’s hands continued with the light fondles, making Tony blush lightly especially now he was touching his length, each touch exciting him more and more. He took a moment to appreciate his body, but it was hard to when he could feel tingles of pleasure when Steve caressed his excitement. Tony let out a deep groan when the Captain’s fingertips moved to caress his inner thigh instead.
“One!” They shouted in unison, firing the powerful unified blast toward the Green Goblin who screamed out in agony, but managed to throw the bomb in his hand toward the two. The blast went as planned, severing the hand with the focused dual power. It was the bomb that was unexpected, flying their way, Steve quickly moved in front of Tony, trying to protect him and he held his other arm up that had his shield strapped onto it.  The bomb smacked into the shield and sent Steve flying back, but Tony was saved and ran as quickly as he could to fetch the hand before it hit the floor. There was a loud clang as the smoke cleared; Tony’s widened blue eyes caught sight of the severed, bloody green hand on the floor, the palm loose. He glanced over his shoulder. “Steve!?” He called out in panic, taking a slow step toward the fallen Globin who lay there unconscious.
His head went from side to side, trying to spot the billionaire – he caught him running into one room that was always locked that had piqued Steve’s curiosity once or twice. Quickly he followed, only to be bombarded by smoke again, coughing loudly as it flew into his face.
Tony snapped his teeth at it wishing the ringing in his ears would cease, instead raising his hand and charging up the unibeam from the centre of his chest – he still had the entire plate on. Aiming it close he fired it and not only broke the speaker, but blast a hole in the wall. However the impact was so strong and he was so frail on his feet that he fell back from the recoil of the blast. Steve crawled up beside him making a distressed groan, Tony replied with the same haggard facial expression remaining on his face, laying there for a moment.
Just as he did, the umbrella poked out of the top of his hat and of course, spread wide open, Tony had to angle his head toward the beam – it didn’t deflect them but it certainly protected JARVIS, until the umbrella was nothing more than a couple of rods of wire.
“Oh… Holy shit!” He cursed, not expecting that. It was amazing, this pulsing was pushing against his sweet spot over and over, making his body shudder with bliss, his eyes shutting whilst beads of sweat trickled down his back.
The ticking of the cogs resounded throughout the entire old, rickety building, heavy machinery slamming down on their respective parts, churning and producing, hot steam releases piping throughout the air and whistling as they pressed and released.
A bar was laid across Steve’s legs, which didn’t help him. Both legs were covered completely by this huge, solid support beam that must have fallen. Tony placed both hands on the bar, his fingertips curling around the metal edge, his electronic fingers following before he heaved once; using up the entirety of his remaining strength to shift the bar only inches off Steve’s body. His heart was thudding in his ears when he lifted it, back muscles tense, knees bent whist he pulled with all of his might – tugging the bar only to push it away from Steve’s body. It landed on the ground with a huge thump, creating a small dust cloud. Tony’s hand swiped in front of his face, his fingers numb from the over exertion. He coughed and turned his head away from the dust and residue.
“Geez, sure is different…” Steve said as he lowered the visor of his navy blue police cap to protect his eyes from the rays that beamed down from the cheerful sun above, barely breaking through the canopy of skyscrapers yet still managing to shine ever so brightly. Brooklyn wasn’t that far away from NYC; actually Steve’s journey was around 45 minutes to get to the other side of the East River via subway. It was a small journey but Manhattan seemed like a different country entirely, which was surreal to say the least; everyone had different accents, they were so preoccupied with themselves, and it just seemed so busy.
“You’re right, you’re not like me. You’re you, you’re Tony Stark, you’re Iron Man, you’re a one in a million, a strong hero who has been through so much. You’d lost your company, fallen, and then you picked yourself up. There’s no reason you can’t do that again...”
“His blood doesn’t have the technopathic capabilities yours possesses. Yes, he could be used but there wasn’t enough blood in him, and his version of the serum is so old that it’s a wonder he’s still alive, actually. You on the other hand… You have the new enhanced serum. Whenever I did tests using this soldier’s blood it just deteriorated…”
It was like going through a maze, which was a reminder to Steve as to why he didn’t exactly like corporate buildings. Eventually, they reached the fire escape, then down the stairs. There Hank was, on the ground, unconscious and bleeding out. Janet had clearly tried to make a makeshift bandage for him with torn rags from her clothing, wrapped around him tightly.
“I won’t like you when you’re angry? Okay, so, Bruce must be even more pissed off that you’re stealing his lines now,” he said before blowing a strand of hair out of his face.
A powerful smack to the jaw sent Steve to the ground by the machine right away. His hand went for his jaw immediately to cup it as he stared up at the armoured man that was stood before him, standing in all of his glory, tall an mighty; Iron Man. Steve’s widened azures focused on the armoured hero as he placed his palm on the dusty floor beneath him, just about ready to push himself up again.
He pushed back and white smoke leaked from the back of his suit as he’d managed to put a little more pressure on the release until it was activated; freezing the webbing which then made breaking from it a cinch. Tony landed on his feet with an audible sigh of relief. “Are you ever going to go with my freeze resistant chemical compound suggestion for your webbing or was my entire 10 minutes of research into the suggestion a complete waste of my time?” He brushed off the remaining white ice particles and held out his arms, showing that he wasn’t going to attack, nor was he preparing one.
The ring was wonderful; it looked as though it were made of scrap metal, as though Steve had made it himself, a little silver ring that looked like a tiny wrench that was just small enough to fit perfectly on his finger.
Steve leaped upward and delivered a powerful strike with the heel of his foot, crashing it down on Tony’s shoulder and sending him face down into the floor again.
Her eyes didn’t leave his face, and Tony could feel them as though they were burning a hole in his forehead, well that would be an excuse for the excessive sweat that dripped down his temple. He began to take out the wiring system that was attached to her wrist, the wires going into her arm and showing on the upper layer of her skin as though they were veins. Surprisingly the technology was very well integrated into the human body.
“Watch that potty mouth.” Steve said, although he’d heard worse in his platoon, he just wanted to taunt Tony, even when they were being so loving.
“You’re okay, aren’t you. You’re okay… You know who I am, Steve, you’re getting better!” He almost yelled.
That little piece of acknowledgement and gratitude from Captain America, his hero, was enough to make his heart race. His expression changed from caution to enthusiasm in a heartbeat. Luckily, his faceplate was hiding that. He didn’t want Cap to think too much of it.
