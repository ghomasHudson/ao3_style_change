Tony smiled, shaking his head in disbelief. His son really was that modest... or ignorant of his own brilliance. Either way, it was rather adorable. "And you're smarter than most of the people I," he coughed, "Ms Potts, employ."
"D-done," said Peter quietly as he pushed the pieces of signed paper towards Ross. The older man had a malicious glint in his eye, his face painted in the thoughts of his scheming mind.
They were submerged into darkness. An empty, cold darkness. The pair's confusion was voiced as the once yellow light began to flicker a crimson red. The heating must have turned off too; the boys were now beginning to shudder.
The elevator doors opened and Tony guided the two soldiers into the lounge. "Take a seat," he offered, indicating to the black sofa, "I'll just go get Pete."
Peter struggled against the restraints, letting a few tears slip down his face. But it didn't last for long... The Soldier was quick to forcefully push the boy's head back into the metal, holding it back as parts of the machine began to clasp around it. "Bucky I-" Peter pleaded, his words cut off by a rubber mouthguard that was shoved into his mouth.
Steve stood up, walking over to the stand. He quickly threw a glance towards Bucky - who gave him a reassuring smile back. "I believe...," he raised his voice slightly, before continuing, "I believe that my son, Peter Benjamin Parker Stark-Rogers, should no longer remain in Anthony Edward Stark's custody."
For a minute that seemed impossibly long, the room was quiet - not quite silent, just an unsettling kind of quiet. The only sound was of breathing: Zemo's calm, relaxed breaths and Peter's heavy and broken breaths, verging on hyperventilation.
Tony ruffled Peter's hair. He then turned his attention back to the redhead. "You. Me. Dinner. Tonight. The Penthouse." He smirked as Pepper opened her mouth to argue. "Shush," he said, "It's non-negotiable." He brought his finger to his lips, signalling silences
Tony's face reddened, "I'm flattered, Petey, but do you remember anything about the spiders, anything?"
"Welcome, Midtown," exclaimed a lady, who was wearing a white lab coat, "My name is Katie, and I will be taking you on your tour today!"
"It went okay," Tony said calmly, making sure not to worry the boy anymore than he had to. "How comes you are still in your PJs?"
He heard a sigh from the other end of the call. "No. Someone will, if you interfere. That's how it works now."
"I... I don't remember," the boy stammered, unable to focus on anything in front of him. Instead his gaze drifted to the sheets of his bed - taking comfort in the blank canvas of white that was covering him. At least he knew that it had kept him warm the previous night; he had no idea what the man could do - even if he seemed to be rather concerned about him.
Peter shook his head in disbelief, and Tony laughed whilst mumbling, "So should we get started or what?"
Vasily Karpov was one of the best handlers Hydra ever had. He had made sure The Winter Soldier would be worthy of all the praise the organisation gave him. He also kept the asset in line, punishing him relentlessly until the man he had once been shattered into a million pieces, leaving behind just an empty shell. He was also an organised man with an organised mind. He had a good memory and believe it careless to forget even one single mission report. That's why Zemo had come to him.
"Relax, I'm homeschooling him. So's the rest of the team, actually. Clint is great with languages and surprisingly English, Rhodey teaches him math, Vision teaches him history and geography, Wanda helps with social studies and I teach him sciences... Advanced MIT level sciences for that matter."
The man in Black then decided to catch a ride through the sky by grabbing hold of Sam's leg. The Falcon tried to shake him away, kicking his legs in protest.
Karpov seemed appalled by that idea. It was a rule all members of secret organisations followed: never get associated with law enforcement. It will never end well for anyone. Karpov shook his head, "No. No cops."
The man began to stand up, before being interrupted by Steve. "Wait. Tony. I need to say something else. Avengers related."
"Hey, kiddo," Tony replied, his voice warped slightly by the noise of his suit, "You up for a bit of patrolling?"
"Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition," a man diminutive man, who also had a dusting of grey hair coating his head, replied. His voice was cold, tarnished with the ideals of someone that always believed they knew best... someone that thought rules were more important than morals.
Steve pulled a rug from beneath one of the German men, sending him flying. They may not have been fighting on the same team but at least now they had a mutual enemy. Bucky brought the blond back from his thoughts by slamming another man against the wall, the man's eyes rolling inside his head at the impact. "Buck! Stop! You're gonna kill someone."
Ross sighed. "But with you also comes death. Tragedy. Disaster. Hundreds of people die, and there are thousands of casualties."
Peter knew how terrible Vision's cooking skills were but he was feeling rather peckish. "Sure, thanks," he answered, after much hesitation.
There was a bed in the corner of the room, if you could call it a bed. It was more of a cot - a thin mattress secured to a metal frame, with only a sheet on top. A white sheet. In a pile, on the bed, were some clean clothes: a white polyester shirt, and some white, sports pants. However, there were no socks or shoes, and Peter soon realised that the ones he had worn before had been stripped from him.
Vision ignored him. "In the eight years since Mr Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And, during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate."
"I am your father!" Tony shouted, his voice modified by the mask. He pulled it off. He could tell Peter had gotten freaked out, nervous even... "Ned, is it okay if I take you back early?"'
Clint picked up the teen, hauling him out of his seat. "Why you little brib√≥n..." he hissed, before throwing the kid to the floor - tickling him.
Bucky grinned, "I sure did. Me and my pal Alfie used to play it back in the day... Your Pops, here, can't play to save his life."
He placed the cup and kettle on the table. Then, whilst quickly turning on one of his holograms, he said, "Oh that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid." Steve stared at the picture of the teen in confusion. "Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. He had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul." Nat frowned. She was also worried with where the genius was going with this.
"What?" Peter snapped. His Dad's voice had been dialled up to eleven. It was too loud, almost deafening.
"Uhuh, kiddo. 'Bout time I meet the kid I've been spending all my money on for your movie premieres and comic cons." He was joking, of course. Those events cost less than the bottle of whisky he was currently pouring from. It barely made a dent in the small wallet he carried around for those weird places that didn't accept cards, let alone his actual fortune.
Tony reassured himself, however his forehead was still wet from his sweat. He still didn't know what to say, and as the word started to form on the top of his tongue,
"Come on, kid," Clint exclaimed, tugging the teen off of the couch, "Your Dad would skin me alive if you don't finish your work."
Not bothering to question why, Steve did as he was asked. This time, he realised what Tony was so interested in. The ground was making a hollow sound.
"You're welcome, Peter," Vision replied, before heading through another wall... one which led to Wanda's room. The teen wondered why he was going in there.
The boy's curly, brown hair was laced in dust and bits of dry paint: cuts and bruises were slowly forming across his face. His eyes were closed, making him appear to be sleeping - the only sign he wasn't dead being the faint movement of his chest. His white shirt was stained in blood, his own blood, and it was turning a shade of reddy-brown. Every few seconds, the teen would whimper in his unconscious state, before falling back to the darkness.
"Dad," Peter said, when they had finally finished covering String Theory, "Can we watch a movie, after dinner?"
"And that," Pepper said, gesturing to the amount of food left on each plate, "Is a story for after dinner."
"You alright, kid?" Tony asked. He held his right hand down to his son, pulling him up of the ground. "Nice PJs by the way," he added, after noticing the Iron Man pyjamas Peter was sporting.
Peter shook his head. "They've turned you against yourself. Not the other way round. I swear it. They're the bad guys."
Peter grinned, turning off his VR Lightsaber, chucking it onto the seat. They had been battling each other, recreating the Battle of The Heroes, which from their favourite episode of Star Wars. "I know right!"
"At least I'm now like you and Pops," Peter exclaimed. Then after seeing the smile on his Dad's face fade, he added: "Sorry."
Ned appeared to be gearing up to make a small speech. "Mr Stark, I... uh, um, I mean... Tony, um, thank you for this." He gestured to his plate, the people at the table, and finally the room in general. "Today has been awesome!" He was smiling wide and his Confidence Hat sat in his lap, his plate nearly empty.
Tony strode into the restaurant, Peter's hands clasped around his own. The boy was shaking - his nerves getting the better of him. He didn't quite believe his Pops that Bucky was hone. What if the man tried to kidnap him again?
"I mean," Tony paused. "You're practically ready to graduate high school already, kid, why not work on something a little more advanced?"
"I don't quite believe you, kid," Tony scoffed, "You see, you do this thing with your hands whenever you lie."
"That is why he will not be with you, Captain. Why don't you let your son have some bonding time with his future stepdad?"
‚ÄúGet the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?‚Äù Sharon supplied, hoping it was the right answer the Captain wanted to here.
Bucky pecked a kiss on Steve's cheek, "He loves you no matter what... if he's even a tiny bit like his old Pops then he'll be fine."
"If that was actually... if that was actually Buck, then shouldn't I be the one to bring him in? The only reason he'd be acting like this if if Hydra got him again," he said, his voice breaking every few syllables. "I'm the only person who has ever brought him out of that trance. Shield will need me."
The door opened, causing Peter to flinch back in fear of what was to come. There was a blond man stood there, one he hadn't seen before: but one he already knew not to trust. Everyone here was dangerous... even Bucky.
Rough fingers slide back along his jaw, spilling down along the curve of his neck and onto his chest. The night before, Steve had been so careful to avoid his scars, fingers purposefully skittering away, only skimming the edges of the long, horizontal mess that crosses over his breastbone. It slices straight through the circle of scar tissue that used to house the arc reactor.
.‚Äù Tony blinks back the tears biting behind his eyes because this is supposed to be good. It‚Äôs not sad, it‚Äôs good and he‚Äôs okay and this is so, so right. This is everything, damn it.
Steve groaned against his back; forehead pressed into the space between his shoulder blades. ‚ÄúTony, please.‚Äù
It‚Äôs the next best thing to punching him because he can bite down on his bottom lip until he tastes copper and fist his hands in that long blond hair and
Devastation and hope contradict themselves across Steve‚Äôs features when he lays eyes on Tony‚Äôs wedding band. It‚Äôs made a home inside the hollow of Tony‚Äôs left clavicle, delicate chain pooling at his throat and though Steve doesn‚Äôt look away he must know enough to keep his mouth shut.
‚ÄúTony.‚Äù Steve squeezes him tighter, presses his face into his chest and breaths. Wet spots appear below the arc reactor and Tony realizes that Steve is crying again, silent and motionless. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough.‚Äù
Steve laughed, wet and short, trying to picture her pouring a young, drunken Tony into her car, stern even in disarray. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù
Two voicemails from Ross make clear through potentially chargeable threats that he better not be preparing to pull some ill-advised stunt. He reminds Tony that the press will look as bad for Tony as it will for all of the Avengers, and they all know Tony can‚Äôt afford that right now. He‚Äôd better get his head out of his ass, and quick.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about what happened,‚Äù Steve blurts, because it feels like the next right thing to say. It seems to catch Tony off guard.
‚ÄúI can see that you‚Äôre hurting. You may be surprised to see what you find if you change your mind about talking to him.‚Äù
Bucky‚Äôs still not understanding, clearly, because he doesn‚Äôt say anything and just tilts his head, quirking an eyebrow. What was it about super soldiers that makes communication such a challenge?
Pepper clocks the glass in his hand and for a second Tony wishes he had had the foresight to pluck a second flute from the tray; something to chase down Pepper‚Äôs disappointment with.
Or maybe missing past-Steve, the way things had been before, when they had all curled into each other in the Tower, covered in blankets and half-open candy boxes, watching a shitty action movie. The rest of the team might‚Äôve been there, or it might‚Äôve been just Tony and Steve. No matter, Steve had been the constant and despite himself, a part of Tony wanted him there tonight. Which would have meant he couldn‚Äôt let his guard down and relax, and he wouldn‚Äôt have stayed long in the end.
gone. Who knows who else remains? It doesn‚Äôt matter, he thinks frantically. It doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs left because half of them are gone.
A ripple of uncertainty races over his skin, leaving him chilled. Tony‚Äôs got everything figured out. He‚Äôs looking right past the smoke and mirrors and reaching out to wrap his fist around the very core of Steve‚Äôs being.
The motor oil is still shimmering against his cheek and Steve‚Äôs fingers twitch at his side, restless with the urge to rub it away. If Tony makes light of this, the scaffold around Steve‚Äôs heart will fold and Steve‚Äôs not strong enough for that. He‚Äôs not.
If he lingers on that train of thought too long, the anger will dissolve into loneliness and he‚Äôll want a drink, so he shoves it away and thinks of literally anything else.
‚ÄúAnd on which day will they worship me as the God that I am?‚Äù Thor demanded. ‚ÄúI will mark it promptly on the monthly moon chart.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt just the first, Tony.‚Äù Steve hadn‚Äôt missed the note of self-deprecation under the Omega‚Äôs words or the way that the caramel scent burnt around the edges. ‚ÄúI mean, of course you were the first O, but it was so much more than that. You know that.‚Äù
Over the next few days, Steve lingers in his space when they‚Äôre not training. He slips away and joins Tony in the shop, sketching while Tony works. The silence feels important, necessary as they take time to reacquaint themselves with each other‚Äôs presence.
Until the alarm had gone off and Tony had insisted that they not let all of the prep Steve had gone through go to waste, pulling Steve up the bed and lining up his cock before Steve thrust in to the hilt. The sweet whispers turned to filth and rushed desperation to pull another orgasm out of Steve because,
‚ÄúWhat were you doing?‚Äù Tony tried to demand but the words came out slurred and broken as if his tongue was too big for his mouth. It was almost as if he was hungover, confusion and disbelief rife in his expression.
When Steve‚Äôs cock bumps the back of his throat, Tony moans, sending a series of vibrations rushing through him. It‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs perfect, and Tony belongs to him. This mouth, these beautiful, skilled hands. The way that Tony swallows around him like he‚Äôs already trying to milk Steve through his orgasm.
Until Steve was introduced to the most arrogant, egotistical Omega he‚Äôd ever met. An Omega who strutted his way through life as if he hadn‚Äôt a care in the world. An Omega who had strutted into
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be like that, and you know it,‚Äù Steve says with a stubborn purse of his lips. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be back at the Compound in a month and this is going to happen all over again.‚Äù
Tony squirms closer, thrusting his hips down hard into Steve‚Äôs and rolling his throbbing erection against the echoing bulge in Steve‚Äôs jeans. The sounds pouring out of Steve now are music to his ears, a song that never gets old and unlocks a series of vivid memories from the shadowy crevices of his mind.
They were so beautiful together, his Alphas, all thick muscles and soft hands. Steve, so commanding and strong, anchoring them both, slid a hand between Bucky‚Äôs legs and stroked him a few times. He slipped his fingers between Tony‚Äôs legs and stole from the puddle between Tony‚Äôs thighs. Using Tony‚Äôs own slick, Tony watched with rapt attention as Steve stroked Bucky, wetting him until his cock was shiny and ready, a deep, near-painful red.
Tony reaches up to brush a hand through his hair but before it touches him, it twitches and falls away. ‚ÄúSt‚Äî‚Äù
Without even thinking, Steve catches Tony‚Äôs hand before it falls away and presses the palm against his cheek. Rough calluses rasp across his face and Tony is looking at him with an uncertain awe, as if Steve‚Äôs already hung the moon and he‚Äôs still searching the sky for the stars.
Bucky had scented of cream; rich and thick with an underlying whiff of vanilla that crept into the back of Steve‚Äôs sinuses and liquified his brain. The mouth-watering aroma trailed after him when he left for work in the morning, and greeted him heavily in the evening when he returned.
‚ÄúI heard you.‚Äù Tony cuts him off, not prepared to hear Steve try and talk him out of this, if that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs trying to do. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you know that I did, but I heard you back before, when you‚Äì‚Äù
He‚Äôs been so lonely for so long, but now love hums all around him and it‚Äôs perfect. He‚Äôs full to the brim, overflowing with warmth and peace, like he might never have to face the chill again. The ice, Siberia, all the dark things of the past flow to the sidelines because everyone is here. He‚Äôs here.
Damn it, he‚Äôs been lying to himself and will always lie to himself when Steve‚Äôs involved. Talking about it could change
Tony is sitting right here, a hairbreadth away. His hand is still raised, and his fingertips are shiny and sticky with sugar. Steve swallows and a thick layer of honey warms him all the way down. When Tony‚Äôs eyes follow the trail, tracking the bob in his throat, the warmth explodes into desire.
Steve‚Äôs thoughts went blank as Tony started trembling, his body shuddering like a leaf in the gale and another sob escaped him. Tears started to flow down his face and he couldn‚Äôt seem to draw a breath, curling in on himself when Steve was the one who wanted to sink through the floor.
The hands on his hips are biting into his flesh and Tony reaches down to press one harder, hoping Steve gets the message. When he does, Tony whines into his mouth, the pain-pleasure blurring together, recreating the bruises that Tony has always cherished there before.
‚ÄúYeah, yeah, Rogers, we all know that already. What part of quick and painless didn‚Äôt compute for you?‚Äù Tony grouses, earning himself a room full of scowls and barely hidden disdain.
There‚Äôs something he needs to say, and he should have said it weeks ago. He was doing so well, being honest, letting Tony in, doing things together, and it‚Äôs not supposed to be this way. They‚Äôre supposed to be a team and Steve‚Äôs fear feels crippling.
‚ÄúAs in, let‚Äôs move on. I can‚Äôt say it doesn‚Äôt sting, Nat. It probably will for a long time. We‚Äôll just try and figure it out anyway.‚Äù
But Tony knows the power that Steve holds in his hands and has been careful never to give himself that kind of permission again.
‚ÄúNot that you have a choice in the matter,‚Äù Tony said, ‚Äúbut when we get home, we‚Äôre getting married. I‚Äôm not letting you go, not after this. I mean it, Steve. The second we set foot on solid land. Married. Forever. No exceptions.‚Äù
Could it have been possible that Steve knew Barnes was out there? He‚Äôs been in pursuit of the Winter Soldier for weeks now, and for Barnes to show up here, to watch them‚ÄîTony shoves the thought aside, checking off all the mental boxes for neuroses and low self-esteem.
The second the words leave his mouth he knows they‚Äôre a lie. Steve feels like garbage. Tony has experienced horrors that Steve could have never dreamed of and he closes his eyes, remembering what Tony‚Äôs told him about Afghanistan, the Mandarin attack, every moment where his control has slipped away and Tony‚Äôs been at the mercy of others.
‚ÄúYou called me here, you know. Something in this crazy universe thought the first thing you needed to see when you came here was some handsome genius.‚Äù
A few days in New York could be manageable. Tony could go back, stay at the Tower in a guest room or something. It didn‚Äôt have to be as maudlin as he feels.
‚ÄúOf course, I made it. Couldn‚Äôt let my best guy go into surgery alone, could I?‚Äù Steve ignores Pepper‚Äôs affronted gasp and the light smack that lands on his bicep. He can‚Äôt take his eyes off Tony.
The sound of skin sliding against the glass is an obscene melody in his ears, accentuated by the pianissimo of Steve‚Äôs desperate, little gasps. As Steve drops his head to bite down on his shoulder, Tony jolts forward, stomach pitching as he almost collides against the cold glass.
‚ÄúTony. I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm in this. Whatever you need, whatever I have to do to show you that. There‚Äôs nothing else, and there won‚Äôt ever be.‚Äù
life, scenting of dark, lush coffee, black as sin, with a mouth on him that made Steve flush like he was back in ‚Äò44.
After, Tony was gentle and soothing, pulling him against his chest and easing a hand over his back until he was dozing off, satisfied yet somehow not fully sated.
Sometimes Steve looks at him as if he‚Äôs terrified the floor will open him up and swallow him whole. As if he can‚Äôt bear to take one wrong step because everything will crumble around him but he squares his shoulders when he can. He‚Äôs not always honest about what he‚Äôs thinking, so Tony pushes him until he talks. In the moments when Steve can‚Äôt truly form words, Tony gives and lets him off the hook, kissing him instead.
Before Steve even opens his eyes, he knows he‚Äôs back in Avengers Tower. The thick, old blankets curl around him and a lifetime of memories drifting through the apartment. Of all the places his mind takes him in his sleep, Steve hasn‚Äôt been here in years.
Lang, she supplies, is visiting with his daughter for the evening, and Rogers has been called away on an independent mission. Somehow, even that irks him, because this whole thing was about being ready and prepared for an invasion and Steve thinks he can just fuck off to god knows where whenever he likes?
Tony narrows his eyes and Steve waits for whatever comes next. Why does he feel so uneasy? It‚Äôs normally so much simpler than this; they fuck, or they fight and even if they fight, they still end in a vicious, raging heap on the floor with Tony buried deep inside him.
When Tony shuddered again, a grotesque, full body roll, and moaned Steve‚Äôs name, Steve‚Äôs heart ached for him. The decision almost felt as if it were being made for him. He couldn‚Äôt just let Tony suffer, trapped in whatever horrors danced in his mind.
‚ÄúI want to talk to you,‚Äù Steve says plainly, stepping across the few feet that separate them until he‚Äôs dropping down into the armchair at the corner of the sofa and leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd still be here. Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get the chance.‚Äù
‚ÄúCan I take a look at this later?‚Äù Peter blurts, ‚Äúif you wouldn‚Äôt mind Mr. Barnes, Sgt. Barnes, Winter Soldier, uh, sir? I‚Äôve never seen anything like this before. It‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù
‚ÄúI called her the first time I got wasted,‚Äù Tony continues. ‚ÄúShe was so disappointed, but it was hard to take her seriously in yesterday‚Äôs make up, her hair up in curlers on the top of her head. She even had her slippers on, pink, fluffy little things, looking so serious.‚Äù
!‚Äù If he didn‚Äôt have a grip on Tony‚Äôs wrists, he expects Tony might slap him. He jerks at his hands again, and Steve holds fast. ‚ÄúMy Mom. My goddamn Mom and you knew! You fucking‚ÄîYou knew and you didn‚Äôt say anything but you said‚ÄîAnd you keep saying that you‚ÄîDid you even mean it‚Äî"
tell him. Tony wants to do this together. He wants them to be on the same team, and if they‚Äôre even going to have a shot at that, Steve needs to come clean.
It‚Äôs muddy and complex, and Tony can feel his own heart breaking as he looks the man he loves in the eyes and silently begs for him not to let Tony go through with it, even as he shoves his fists into his pockets and steels himself to push on.
‚ÄúAnd I think he‚Äôd thank me for this, Stevie,‚Äù Bucky goes on, as if Steve hasn‚Äôt spoken at all. ‚ÄúHe gave up everything so we could live and this isn‚Äôt living. Not even close. He‚Äôd thank me and you know what? I can make my peace with that.‚Äù
Tony wrapped his hand around Steve‚Äôs wrist and felt the suit squeal under the weight, dragging them both down. Water was spilling in through the cracks in the arm and ice speared through his extremities.
Had he been stubborn when Steve had come back? The cards are stacked against him on this one because he‚Äôs usually damned stubborn. Except he had good reason here and he‚Äôd been clear, every step of the way.
It must just be some minor suit damage, because though Tony isn‚Äôt responding he appears to be picking up on what Steve is saying over the team line. Just as requested, Iron Man turns and starts blasting towards him, landing on the ground a few steps away and firing a repulsor blast at Steve‚Äôs shield.
‚ÄúIt allows you to basically re-process traumatic memories and do things differently. A ‚Äúchoose your own adventure‚Äù if you will.‚Äù
Thankfully, his meeting takes longer than anticipated, and Pepper insists on getting coffee afterward, which means by the time he‚Äôs back at the Compound it‚Äôs near dinner time.
Tony shoots him an odd look, one corner of his mouth dipping down. ‚ÄúJust think about which version of yourself you liked the best, and blink. It‚Äôs that simple.‚Äù
There‚Äôs a moment of hesitation where Steve gives him a disbelieving look as if he can‚Äôt believe Tony is pushing him, or can‚Äôt believe that he‚Äôs still sitting there. Whatever it is, Steve takes a few jerky steps back over to the chair and sits down, stiff and bewildered as if Tony‚Äôs pulled the rug out from underneath his feet.
Steve jerked his head towards the door, the illusion shattering in an instant. The intruder, Amy, or maybe Amanda, a large woman with streaky grey hair and an ill-fitting pair of scrubs, stood at the threshold.
From this distance, Tony can‚Äôt make out his face, only a smear of pale skin hidden in shadows and the reflection of the moon glinting off the metal arm, exposed to the shoulder.
"Says he's retired." Natasha smiles. It was unlike her to let her guard down in such a public place but it was most likely she knew no one was going to interrupt them.
Peter started to shiver uncontrollably, shaking his head in protest. "No, no, no... No," he mumbled. His Pops had told him all about Hydra: how they had experimented on people, how they wanted world control, how they had somehow brought his best friend - boyfriend, he corrected himself - back to life.
The Dark Room? What the hell was the Dark Room? It didn't sound good to Peter but he couldn't escape from Bucky's grip: the metal arm already felt like it was choking his jugular.
"Yeah, I'm fine," he replied, watching the judge intensely as he spoke to one of the jury members. Hopefully, this time tomorrow Peter would be moving into his new room: ready for a new start.
What if Peter only loved him when Steve was there? What if he only pretended to love him, what if it was all an act?
Peter reluctantly forced his hand into the greeting, regretting it simultaneously. The man - Zemo - had pulled him into a headlock, only just leaving him with enough space to breath. And even then, it wasn't a comfortable position to be in.
"Okay..." began Steve, realising Peter didn't want to talk about it; then as he noticed his son's choice of clothing, he said in mock anger, "Anthony Stark, what have you done?"
The next day was Friday, and that was the day Steve Rogers and Tony Stark had set up a meeting with a law attorney. The meeting was at 10:30, so Tony of course showed up at 10:45.
Clint gently touched Tony's shoulders, something he did to Cooper whenever he felt down. It probably didn't help but it felt nice trying to. "How comes you haven't told Peter, yet?"
"Oh yes," Zemo said calmly, his face twisted in an evil smile. He looked happy... too happy for regular day to life, and far too happy to be kidnapping enhanced teenagers. The man waited a moment before continuing, either trying to figure out what to say - or just stalling for dramatic effect. "Are your accommodations meeting your standards, asset?"
Tony watches as Steve tries, desperately to explain. The memory shifts to Steve trying to tell him before the video plays, before they enter the bunker, in the middle of the video. He apologizes while Tony‚Äôs already attacking Bucky, holding his hands up in defense instead of trying to intervene.
The soulmark on his wrist had always been the tether, something to hold on to when the nightmares felt more real than reality and the Valkyrie was going down, fast. Even before he knew what it meant, or who it tied him to, Steve‚Äôs soulmark had kept him grounded.
‚ÄúThis is what you wanted, right Steve? You wanted to fuck until it feels better. Does it feel better?‚Äù Tony‚Äôs voice is a hiss between his teeth, hands scrambling at Steve‚Äôs back as Steve straightens, sliding backward with Tony in his arms until he‚Äôs pressed against the headboard and Tony is sitting tall astride his lap. It gives Tony more leverage, and Steve helps him fuck down harder and harder until it starts to blur into a searing pain deep in Tony‚Äôs belly.
It all ends too soon, when a massive swirling orange portal appears in his bedroom and Tony‚Äôs pulling the blankets up to his chest like a scandalized miss. He doesn‚Äôt have much of a choice when Voldemort himself steps out of the portal, Bruce half behind him with bugged out eyes, and tells Tony that he needs him to go with him, that it‚Äôs time.
‚ÄúIf I wanted a getaway car, I‚Äôd‚Äôve called Happy,‚Äù Tony grumbles, and that‚Äôs when Bucky grins at Steve, using the hand Steve has on his shoulder for leverage to pull him in and clap him on the back, disheveling his tie in the process only to start fussing with it all over again.
He hollows out his cheeks until Steve‚Äôs vision starts to blur, clearing his throat when he pulls off to take him in deeper. Without the serum, Steve‚Äôs cock is smaller and Tony seems to take pride in how he can take him fully into his mouth for the first time, swallowing around Steve‚Äôs cockhead until Steve has to close his eyes. He loses himself in the hot depth of Tony‚Äôs throat. It‚Äôs too good.
done that. He and Bucky have done that. There were reasons, sure, but with his partner standing in front of him, eyes clouded with pain, it feels damn hard to justify. Maybe he just wants the opportunity to explain. Again. In person this time.
, Steve!‚Äù Tony shouted, hurling one of the pillows in his direction. It fell limp and useless onto the floor, halfway between the bed and where Steve was pressed against the doorframe.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go ask him. Corner him,‚Äù Bucky decided, shooting out of the bed and tugging on a pair of Steve‚Äôs sweatpants that had been kicked haphazardly to the floor the night before.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Steve says as Tony pauses halfway down the stairs, giving him a startled look. Then he smiles, helplessly shaking his head.
Tony doesn‚Äôt offer placations or reassurances. He sits in the presence of their grief and breathes, as if it‚Äôs the easiest thing in the world. As if he somehow has learned to sift through all the sadness and let the days pass through him like a sieve. Steve watches his eyes drift over his shoulder, catching sight of the photograph still hanging in the kitchen.
‚ÄúIs he in the Compound, FRI?‚Äù Tony‚Äôs crammed underneath a prototype of repulsor technology he‚Äôs trying to figure out how he can add to a Quinjet for better aerial attacks. The tech is on point, but the compatibility is proving trickier than anticipated.
With a sharp pivot, he slips past him and crosses the room to the door. He cracks it open and gives Steve a hard look. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for you to go.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen you meet him, you can decide for yourself,‚Äù Tony snaps back, but it‚Äôs teasing and void of any bite. ‚ÄúAny more questions, kid, or are you ready to meet the rest of the team? Before you can handle meeting a wizard, you‚Äôre going to need to make it through this band of freaks and weirdos.‚Äù
Steve‚Äôs cock slipped out of his mouth as Bucky tugged Tony up into his arms, using reserves of his strength to manhandle Tony exactly where he wanted him and Tony spilled forward, a limp doll, open and easy with pleasure. Steve wrapped Tony‚Äôs arms around Bucky‚Äôs neck for him, pressing up against his back and for a second, he could feel Steve‚Äôs cock slip between his legs, sliding against where he and Bucky were joined.
Tony is silent for a long time and when Steve looks up, his face is sad. It feels like they‚Äôre having two different conversations and when Tony clears his throat, shoulders ticking up stiffly, dread runs down Steve‚Äôs spine like an ice bath. Before Tony even opens his mouth, Steve‚Äôs breath catches and he starts to consider that the uncertainty he‚Äôs been feeling speaks to something more than he‚Äôd originally anticipated.
‚ÄúThe mission intel was wrong. It was HYDRA. It‚Äôs been HYDRA all along and they‚Äôre S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony. Everything Peggy ever worked for‚Äî‚Äù Steve cuts himself off, that‚Äôs not the important part. ‚ÄúThey sent in the Winter Soldier, and we weren‚Äôt ready.‚Äù
The little part of Tony‚Äôs heart that follows Steve wherever he goes is missing again. For the brief moment they were together, it was nice to feel whole. Even when it wasn‚Äôt.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been the one saying all along that as long as we‚Äôre together, it‚Äôll be fine. This is another one of those moments. We got lucky, and Morgan, hell, she‚Äôs everything. She‚Äôs perfect, and this life we‚Äôve made together is just as perfect. But not everyone was so lucky.‚Äù
‚ÄúFRIDAY, call Pepper please.‚Äù Steve requested, and the soft click of the line connecting was initiated. In just a few moments, her voice echoed through the hallway.
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he interrupts, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never turn you in, not even after everything. So what does that say about me, huh?‚Äù
Steve forces himself to relax, pushing the calm into the muscles that bunch and stiffen in his shoulders until he can ease back against the pillow. One of Tony‚Äôs hands tangles with his own and when he closes his eyes, the glow is still there, exactly where it should be.
When Tony starts to move, a painstaking, controlled pace meant to wind Steve up and drive him mad, Steve arches up and wraps his arms around Tony‚Äôs waist. Just like the first time, he presses his mouth to the arc reactor, tracing the mottled skin at the edges with his tongue.
Tony watches as a few more memories fly by Steve, quick snippets of their time together. They‚Äôre always the same, Steve finds a way to tell him the truth, whether the truth about his parents, about Bucky, about lying to him if enough time has passed to warrant it. All of it.
Tony takes two steps backward, safely back at Rhodey‚Äôs side as Bucky turns and strides out stiffer than a board. There, that wasn‚Äôt so bad.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt listen. You‚Äôre so focused on what you think is right, you don‚Äôt care to hear what the rest of us have to say. Barnes doesn‚Äôt want to be an Avenger. I see it, the team sees it. But you seem to think it‚Äôs the right thing for him‚Äî‚Äù
Steve opens and shuts his mouth a few times before he shifts off the bed, pulls on his boxers, and disappears into the bathroom. He returns with a wet cloth and sets it on the edge of the bed without another word.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not making fun of you!‚Äù Steve exclaimed quickly, watching as Tony slipped further away from him, crossing his arms over his chest dubiously. ‚ÄúI swear. I didn‚Äôt even say anything to begin with, it was Clint, but I‚Äôm still sorry because I didn‚Äôt mean to embarrass you or upset you or piss you off. I was trying to do exactly the opposite, but you know. This is just what happens, I guess.‚Äù Stop talking. You‚Äôre rambling. Stop fucking talking, Rogers. ‚ÄúI just wanted to make you dinner. That‚Äôs all, I swear.‚Äù He finished hopelessly.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hear them out.‚Äù Tony waves them over, and when they sit down, it feels like the beginning of the end.
Using his hand and his mouth, he works Steve over until precome leaks steadily over Tony‚Äôs fist and Steve isn‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôs coming or not. He‚Äôs trapped in the unforgiving purgatory between desperation and relief, tears streaming down his cheeks.
Tony clears his throat, a familiar prickle behind his eyes as he blinks and looks away. He‚Äôs not going to fucking cry again. He‚Äôs not.
‚ÄúCan you just give me five minutes, you pig-headed asshole?‚Äù The mask of cool detachment wavering. He smirks at the insult as she unruffles her feathers and picks up the pieces of her composure.
‚ÄúI can feel that that‚Äôs not true.‚Äù Steve growled deep in his chest; a natural response to an Omega‚Äôs ‚Äì
‚ÄúListen to me. We are going to screw this up again.‚Äù Steve shakes his head in protest. ‚ÄúWe are. That‚Äôs what we do. But we‚Äôve got to start making plays together, not opposing each other. I need you to talk to me.‚Äù He pauses and waits for Steve to meet his eye. ‚ÄúI need you not to be Captain America the second things start to become uncomfortable. Stop hiding behind that.‚Äù
Tony‚Äôs in his arms, alive and alight with desire, his head hanging low with his wet mouth open, and it‚Äôs all Steve‚Äôs ever needed. He came so close to losing him, but Tony‚Äôs here, now, vibrant and willing in his arms.
Divorce, something that he had once seen as the pinnacle saving grace. Something he had held onto for years as a secret wish for his mother. Something he had never once anticipated wanting or needing for himself.
‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs so much cooler up close,‚Äù Peter reaches out to shake Bucky‚Äôs hand but barely even glances at his face as he takes in the length of silver prosthesis and weaponry.
‚ÄúMom only cooked on special occasions. Usually she had someone on staff who would cook all these fancy, elaborate meals. I hated them half the time, and we never had anything that normal people got to eat. Jarvis ‚Äì the person Jarvis ‚Äì used to make me all sorts of kid‚Äôs crap when Mom wasn‚Äôt around. He‚Äôd make grilled cheeses and homemade pizzas and those shitty chicken nuggets from the box.‚Äù Tony shrugged, self-deprecation tilting the edge of his lips. ‚ÄúMy favourite was always his wagon wheels with butter and cheese.‚Äù
When Tony doesn‚Äôt know what to say, Steve fills the silence. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been waiting for this. You‚Äôve been testing me. Don‚Äôt think I haven‚Äôt noticed.‚Äù
Everything in his body warns him that he should run. He‚Äôs playing with fire. He‚Äôll never get enough‚Äî
This is the first time Tony‚Äôs actually seen him this close up. There are dark, sunken circles under his eyes and his face looks tight and tense. He looks awful.
He jolts out of sleep to the sounds of Tony‚Äôs screaming and gives F.R.I.D.A.Y. a sharp order for the lights. The soft, dull yellow fills the room, and Steve lays a hand on his shoulder, firm but not pressing him down.
Tony curls onto his side, taking in Steve‚Äôs sleeping form beside him where he‚Äôs flat on his back. The gentle rise and fall of his chest are soothing where he‚Äôs flat on his back. Steve looks lighter than he has in weeks, the bags under his eyes already fading and the crease between his brows smoothed out. Tony reaches over and runs his finger across his forehead but Steve doesn‚Äôt stir, still dead to the world.
But the gig was up, marked by a mixture of excitement, and searing-hot embarrassment gurgling in his stomach.
Below them, the water crashed in high swells, ravaging over each other as they reached up to greet the storm rolling in from the east. The once blue waves churned like the nausea in Tony‚Äôs stomach, where Death called like a siren and Steve was racing headlong into a decision to steer their ship towards her wreckage.
Bucky leaned back in their nest, one leg cocked at the knee and splayed himself shamelessly as he reached out both arms and pulled blankets and pillows alike into his sides.
. Steve pushed into him from behind as Bucky shifted back. He hasn‚Äôt knotted him because ‚Äì because Steve. Of course, Steve. Tony blinked blearily, taking in the look of amazement and love on Bucky‚Äôs open face and he smiled.
That sounded more like it. The way that Steve had come back in, white as a sheet, paired with this revelation, suggested that Steve had had no idea how significant his injuries had been after Siberia. Click, click, click, all the little pieces started to fit into place.
When he rolls his hips up, quick and dirty, Tony is hard against him, and he groans, dropping kisses wherever he can reach with Tony‚Äôs hands in his hair. ‚ÄúThe fellas though‚Ä¶‚Äù
Before he‚Äôd come out, after Afghanistan, Tony had lived as an alpha for a long time, dampening his scent and downing suppressants like candy. He‚Äôd moved on since then, but nesting remained a sore subject.
‚ÄúYou make these impossible choices because you think you have to, Steve. Aren‚Äôt you tired of fighting?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre beautiful,‚Äù Steve gasps out, and one of Tony‚Äôs palms slaps down on his chest as he jerks forward, involuntarily. His eyes light up despite the twist of an almost-shy grin on his lips.
The battlefield starts to fade away and Tony‚Äôs body drifts into nothingness. The last thing Steve sees is the blank, unseeing darkness of his eyes before the scene peels back like the nanites of the Iron Man suit, leaving the room a crisp, stark white.
‚ÄúBrace for impact, Sir!‚Äù JARVIS called through the ringing in his ears. Everything was numb. The world was spinning. Steve was unconscious, hanging from his grip, slack and still enough to be lifeless.
He‚Äôs pulling off his tie on a Thursday afternoon in the kitchen of the Malibu mansion, almost complete in its remodel, when FRIDAY interrupts the mental blueprints he‚Äôs drawing up for R&D.
Tony‚Äôs hands work to have Steve equally as bare, shoving and pulling until they join Tony‚Äôs clothing in a heap beside the bed. Tony touches every inch he can get his hands on, caressing the barely noticeable ripples between Steve‚Äôs ribs and biting down on one of Steve‚Äôs nipples until he‚Äôs panting, groaning his pleasure into the dark.
Tony doesn‚Äôt have time to protest before Steve is coming, his face contorted into something so profoundly sad that Tony‚Äôs eyes burn when he shuts them. Wet, hot release streaks across his face and against his better judgement, Tony‚Äôs opening his mouth, tongue out, ready to suck him down all the same.
It‚Äôs the first time that he‚Äôs heard Barnes speak since the bunker. His voice is different now; it‚Äôs soft, unassuming, and laced with a little hint of Brooklyn that Steve only ever lapsed into if he was angry enough.
?‚Äù Tony all but screeches, hopping up from the chair and crossing the room. He drops down at Peter‚Äôs side on the carpet, and tugs Bucky‚Äôs arm towards him for a closer look.
Something creaks and groans beneath him, but Steve ignores it, yanking Tony back just as he‚Äôs about to hit that crest. He wraps a hand around himself and tugs Tony back by his hair with the other.
‚ÄúCan we try tomorrow, at least? To talk? Please, Tony?‚Äù If only Steve didn‚Äôt look so desperate, limp cock out, sweat running down the side of his jaw and disappearing into his beard, it would be easier to say no.
Howard is shouting, berating one of the staff, Jarvis maybe, Tony can‚Äôt see past his turned back, and Maria steps between them to tell Howard to stop.
‚ÄúI was handling it.‚Äù Tony waves a dismissive hand and leans back in the chair. He almost crosses his arms over his chest, arms twitching back to his side as if he‚Äôd thought better of it. They all know a thing or two about hostility and open body posture. ‚ÄúI did handle it. I‚Äôm here, aren‚Äôt I? I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù
He‚Äôd almost forgotten that sound. There‚Äôd been a time where he thought he might never hear that sound again.
‚ÄúCaptain Rogers initiated the sequencing independently. He‚Äôs unable to alter the original programming and I‚Äôm having some trouble overriding the system. I‚Äôve located the error in my network but B.A.R.F. will require a manual override until you have time to complete a coding update on my network connection.‚Äù
Everyone is there. Everyone he could have ever wanted, spread across the couch and oversized armchairs. In the centre of the room, Peggy is flanked on either side by all the Howling Commandos, relaxing against the couch as if they‚Äôre all just there waiting for him.
‚ÄúI want to tell you to fuck off.‚Äù Clint snapped, light and playful. Thermoses handed to Natasha, he shrugged on his winter jacket and pulled on his boots before he paused, digging around in his pockets and coming up empty. ‚ÄúYou seen my gloves?‚Äù
‚ÄúNoted.‚Äù Tony grunts. ‚ÄúNow, is that it, because this whole situation makes me feel like I need to go into lockdown for a week and lick my wounds. I‚Äôm calling it for today.‚Äù
He‚Äôs raw and open all over again, vulnerable in a way that he realizes he‚Äôs invested no matter what, and the answer is meaningless at this point because tonight he‚Äôll go back to the Coast, and Steve will put one foot in front of another until he either pushes on or transforms into something else.
The beard burn is new, scratching and leaving a prickling trail of heat when he pulls back only to dive in deeper. Steve‚Äôs beard rubs against his balls and the base of his cock and when he slides his tongue down against his perineum and Tony curses himself for only being able to have this once.
‚ÄúWe can figure this out. Tony, please let‚Äôs at least try. No yelling this time. I promise I won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been months and I don‚Äôt want to lose you over this.‚Äù
Tony huffs an almost-laugh and closes his eyes, tipping his face up towards the sun to pray to Odin for patience or a quick strike of lightning. When he opens them, Steve no longer looks gutted and there‚Äôs a renewed anger there simmering below the surface.
Tony didn‚Äôt respond, writhing against the bed as a hoarse cry ripped from his lips and Steve called out his name again. Clamping a firm hand down on his shoulder, Steve tried to shake him awake but Tony‚Äôs body fought him off, one arm flailing out to protect himself.
Tony veered back, suit arcing through the storm as the black sky bled into the water and Tony couldn‚Äôt see where the sea ended, save for the white frothing peaks of the waves cresting in the chaos.
‚ÄúI thought Rhodey would have told you.‚Äù Tony starts, ‚Äúbut I can also understand why he didn‚Äôt. After the fight ‚Äì after the shield ‚Äì the suit was destroyed. There wasn‚Äôt enough power to pilot it, and it had been bent in. I would have died, Helen said, if T‚ÄôChalla hadn‚Äôt been there.‚Äù
When Steve finally quiets, Tony reaches past him, trying not to jostle or dislodge him, and taps him on the shoulder with the top letter from the pile. The most recent one. The one where Steve‚Äôs ended with,
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Peter demands, waving his hand across the holograms to pause them. The colour in his cheeks is dissolving quickly. ‚ÄúYou never‚ÄìI thought you said‚Äìoh my god, Mr. Stark, I‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt realize. Oh man. I‚Äôm so sorry, Mr. Stark‚Äì oh no what did I‚Äì‚Äù
than Steve seemed to grasp. Long, deft fingers had traced patterns in the sprinkle of hair on his stomach, curling between the strands in a journey up to his chest.
‚ÄúYou ridiculous little punk,‚Äù Bucky shook his head and Steve‚Äôs cheeks pinked up again, eyes tipping off to the side. Always so shy, his Alpha. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve wanted you forever. And then you went out and found this perfect Omega and Lord help me, I wanted him too. I shouldn‚Äôt have, but I did.‚Äù
‚ÄúI talked a lot about your big ego getting in the way of everything. Then Bucky snapped and said ‚Äòhave you ever tried to apologize half as hard to Stark? Damn it, Stevie, get your head outta your own ass. This is on you.‚Äô‚Äù
Tony remembers Steve, standing in front of him with both of Tony‚Äôs hands held loosely in his own, smiling down at him. In that moment, Steve was almost the happiest man on earth, second only to Tony himself.
‚Äú‚Äîif nothing changes. You want to apologize for beating me half to death Steve? Start fucking listening. To anyone, I don‚Äôt care if you never listen to me again. Listen to someone. Do some self-reflection or whatever the quacks call it. I don‚Äôt know, Steve. Fucking grow.‚Äù Tony waves an ambivalent hand between them which is an instant mistake because they both clock the way his fingers are trembling, violent spasms running up and down the length of his arm.
It doesn‚Äôt even feel real. That they‚Äôre here, that the space woman with flaming hair has found them in time and brought them back. It‚Äôs a miracle he doesn‚Äôt even deserve.
Is that true? Has Steve meant any of what he‚Äôd said, or were those Bucky‚Äôs words spilling from his mouth? And if it was true, why didn‚Äôt he stop? Why keep pushing and forcing Tony to bend, even after he realized that that‚Äôs what he‚Äôd been doing all along? Where‚Äôs the explanation for running roughshod over him all over again here, in New York, a year later and coming on the heels of his so-called revelation?
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd I miss, punk?‚Äù Bucky‚Äôs eyes are already on the horizon, shoulders braced for a fight. Behind him, the suit is rushing forward over Tony‚Äôs face again, and he turns toward Steve, expectant.
‚ÄúMr. Stark can kinda hold a grudge,‚Äù Peter tips his head in sympathy, but his eyes, when they turn on Tony, are light and teasing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a look at it for you. Can‚Äôt promise I can fix it, but I‚Äôm pretty good with chemical compounds‚Äìmaybe there‚Äôs a way to lubricate where it meets the shoulder and ‚Äì‚Äù
Despite the extreme amount of effort it seemed to take, head dizzy and spinning with pleasure, Tony propped himself up on an elbow and pressed a hand flat against Bucky‚Äôs stomach. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll love you anyways. Always.‚Äù
Tony leans down and presses his lips to his forehead. ‚ÄúYou do. You absolutely do. You‚Äôre so hard on yourself. Just let me do this for you. For him.‚Äù
It‚Äôs not long before Steve picks up the pace, groaning and rolling his hips as Tony explores the defined curve of his ass with one hand, spreading and kneading. He slides a finger down the crease of Steve‚Äôs ass and feels him shiver so he does it again, lingering over the pucker of his hole and pressing light against the tender flesh there.
There‚Äôs not a lot of light in the room, but there‚Äôs enough for Tony to take in the horrified look on Steve‚Äôs flushed face. He swallows hard, resisting the urge to cover himself and close his eyes.
‚ÄúUs. I thought that that would be enough to at least get us talking again.‚Äù Steve sighs and runs a hand through his hair, tipping his head back to look up at the ceiling before his eyes slowly skate back down to Tony‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt figure it out for a long time after. The longer I didn‚Äôt hear from you, the angrier I got. The more resentment built up.‚Äù
He wants to wrap Tony up in his arms and never let him go. He wants to watch Tony‚Äôs face open with laughter as he throws DUM-E‚Äôs tennis ball around the workshop, and listen to the rock music he still can‚Äôt stand.
eviscerate them both. Amazing how it only takes ninety days to end something Tony spent months planning for. Something he spent years enjoying and forgetting to savour.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault, Tony. It‚Äôs not.‚Äù Steve presses his lips into his ears and speaks in a low tone, so only Tony will hear him as the others start to gather around them.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me now. I almost died, or maybe I did die, I‚Äôm not sure. I don‚Äôt know how I feel or what to think. I don‚Äôt know anything anymore, Steve. Except that‚Äî‚Äù Tony swallows, clears his throat, closes his eyes, and opens them to stare into the warmest blue eyes he‚Äôs ever seen. When he forces out the words, they‚Äôre little more than a whisper of a breeze through translucent curtains. ‚ÄúExcept that I love you. I‚Äôve always loved you.‚Äù
Steve felt a phantom kiss to his lips and smiled, letting his eyes drift close to savour the moment. He floated along the sea of endorphins and imagined Tony tucked in beside him with his head on Steve‚Äôs chest, tracing little patterns across his belly and traversing the trail of hair that led down from his navel.
Tony isn‚Äôt even looking at him. It‚Äôs only been days since he came clean, and Tony‚Äôs been rigid at best. They‚Äôve been busy with the fallout from Sokovia, and though Tony comes to bed every other night, drained and exhausted; he no longer lets Steve pull him in. He lies there, stiff and visibly aching, refusing any source of comfort.
‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù Steve snarls, jolting into the couch to pull off Tony‚Äôs fingers. He‚Äôs not going to play this game with Tony. It‚Äôs not worth it, it‚Äôs not‚ÄîTony‚Äôs body follows after him and he can‚Äôt squirm away. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù
Was it still that? Bucky couldn‚Äôt remember how long it‚Äôd been now, but he was sure he‚Äôd apologized, repeatedly, and offered a slew of reassurances both serious and when he was buried to the hilt inside of the O, singing his praises. Sighing, frustrated, Bucky let the weights slam down against the mat and enjoyed the way they landed with a dull thud.
‚ÄúYou got up to a lot more than just defeating the Krauts, Rogers,‚Äù Dugan booms from the sofa and Steve whips back around to grin at him.
He couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. About them. Tangled together in the dark, all hands and fingers and
As Tony curls impossibly closer, goading him and pressing little promises to take him apart into his chest, Steve lets it all sweep him away.
Tony‚Äôs breathing evens out, tempered and slow. If he hadn‚Äôt known better, Steve might‚Äôve thought he was sleeping. Usually at this point Steve is waking up, rolling his sore shoulders and filing away another harsh, impossible fantasy so he can greet the day.
‚ÄúTell us yours, Stark,‚Äù Wanda draws his attention, drinking from a can of pop that Tony doesn‚Äôt recognize, realizing that it‚Äôs in another language. Sokovian maybe. He wonders if she‚Äôll share one, later.
Steve flinches, knuckles whitening around the handle of the door still clutched in his left hand. For a second, Tony thinks that he might deny him. That Steve might push ahead, bully his way in, and refuse to leave until he‚Äôs gotten what he needs of Tony, whatever that is now.
Tony deliberately drags a hand from Steve‚Äôs belly to his chest before letting it curl around his throat and linger there until Steve‚Äôs breathing kicks up a notch and he bites back a moan.
The letters are in a neat pile on the roll-away table beside the hospital bed to his right. Pepper is dozing in the chair to his left with her shoes kicked off and her legs curled up underneath her. It would be a shame to wake her when she looks so tired, and Tony tries to shift quietly in the bed so as not to disturb her.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a dick.‚Äù Tony growled, a put-upon sound that didn‚Äôt come naturally to most O‚Äôs, pushing out of Steve‚Äôs lap until he upright and shoving Bucky down into the mountain of blankets.
Steve sniffled, coughing around the sear in his chest and nudged closer to Tony, searching through the pile of blankets for his warm to see if he might find a few more hours of rest. He reached over to sling an arm around Tony‚Äôs waist and draw him in, to press his face into the side of Tony‚Äôs throat where he might still smell of spice and expensive cologne.
. Bucky, a shadow over his shoulder, hands stripping off his shirt to explore the expanse of perfect skin.
Everything about Steve should have Tony running for the hills, but here he is in broad daylight in the middle of a sidewalk in New York, holding the love of his life anyways. ‚ÄúMaybe we could just sleep. Together. While you‚Äôre here. Just sleep.‚Äù
He‚Äôs hurt Tony and Tony‚Äôs hurt him and Steve is still so fucking angry but there‚Äôs nothing to do with the rage.
Tony deepens the kiss with a sweep of his tongue, tilting Steve‚Äôs chin up further and running his fingers along his jaw, pressing into the tender spot behind Steve‚Äôs ears that drives him wild. Right on cue, he moans and shifts forward on the bed, pressing them together from chest to knee.
Tony almost misses Steve‚Äôs whisper of a response. It‚Äôs so quiet and gentle, so unlike the Steve he thought he knew. He‚Äôs been expecting Steve to be angry, because Tony‚Äôs failed, again, and with such a heavy cost.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Tony grinned, wrinkling his nose. ‚ÄúYeah, right now I am.‚Äù He pauses, linking his fingers with Steve‚Äôs. ‚ÄúDid you tell her? About us? Before‚Ä¶‚Äù
Steve comes to him like a sexual marionette and when Tony turns around, already working at his belt and shoving down his slacks, Steve‚Äôs hands take over. His jacket is stripped off his shoulders and he hears the rustling of Steve doing the same before two hands shove him forward at the hips and he lands on his hands and knees on the bed, ass up, face down.
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs said he doesn‚Äôt want to go. He‚Äôs said he‚Äôs not ready, and you‚Äôre going to burn the Avengers to the ground if something happens out there, tonight. You didn‚Äôt even ask him, Steve! You didn‚Äôt ask any of them!‚Äù Tony throws his arm out in a wide arc, gesturing at the pristinely dressed Avengers behind him.
‚ÄúYou can cry, Steve, it‚Äôs fine. There might be some yelling too.‚Äù Tony gives him a lopsided smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been so great at all this. My therapist tells me that anger
‚ÄúI hate this tie,‚Äù Tony hisses as he pulls off, gasping in a breath before swallowing Steve down to the root.
‚ÄúOur stuff will be here in a bit, so what do you want to do first?‚Äù Tony leans against the island that juts out to form a half-sunken wet bar. ‚ÄúA tour? Dip your toes in the ocean? What?‚Äù
‚ÄúJARVIS?‚Äù Steve asked, later that evening as a pot of water boiled, a half-dozen pasta sauce recipes open in front of him.
Anger sparks underneath his cool composure and the tick in his jaw tells Tony that he‚Äôs on the right track. He‚Äôll push him further if he needs to, if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to take to. Steve doesn‚Äôt reply, but his breathing changes and betrays him.
‚ÄúI was afraid,‚Äù Tony starts, brushing Steve‚Äôs hair back from his forehead as he leans forward and licks a hot line up the underside of Tony‚Äôs cock, tipping it up and towards his belly for better access. Tomorrow, Tony will register Steve‚Äôs tongue as a restricted weapon, the way he licks and laves the sensitive underside and slowly pulls the tip into his mouth, hollowing his cheeks before sliding all the way down. ‚ÄúIt felt like nothing was different. I was so angry with you. I just wanted to hurt you‚Äîoh Jesus Christ that feels,
Rhodes becomes Jim, and though he never quite respects Steve‚Äôs rank, they get on well enough. They trade war stories, and Steve marvels at how little has really changed after all. He doesn‚Äôt visit often; the military is stretched to its limits between emergency relief and rebuilding, but Tony relaxes when he does.
. Except no one knew he had the burner to begin with and the unspoken expectation was that he‚Äôd call T‚ÄôChalla anyways. The burner phone is just the dirty little secret he shares with the wet marks on his pillows.
If the last time was hate-fucking his way to closure, Tony can‚Äôt begin to understand what this is. Whatever he was looking for a handful of minutes ago is long gone now and the ground he‚Äôs gained in ninety days is meaningless. Tony is in tatters and yet again he‚Äôs as battered and exposed as he was in Siberia.
Tony is pinned underneath him, breathing hard, grinning up at him like he‚Äôs somehow won their little game. Which isn‚Äôt how he should be looking at him, because this is the third time Steve‚Äôs pinned him in as many minutes. But Tony just keeps beaming, like sweat isn‚Äôt dripping off Steve‚Äôs forehead and onto his chest, and there isn‚Äôt a bruise already forming on Tony‚Äôs cheek where Steve caught him with an elbow the last time Tony had him in a headlock.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to humour me, kid. I‚Äôm fine, really.‚Äù Tony offers Peter a smile but he‚Äôs already giving over, rolling his eyes and stepping into the car as Peter follows behind him and shuts the door a fraction too hard. So, he has a soft spot for the kid? Someone needs to look out for him.
Exhaustion creeps into his bones as Steve picks them off one by one until the fighting is over and the team starts to trickle out from the surrounding blocks. They fall into a half-circle around Steve and he takes a quick inventory of potential injuries, pleased when everyone seems to be mostly alright.
After proving that Tony Stark, Not Recommended, had been a serious underestimation of his skill, Tony could even argue that he deserved this pseudo-retirement. The team has new blood now. Spider-Man, War Machine, and the Winter Soldier have been made permanent additions, along with Ant-Man and the Falcon. Though Tony isn‚Äôt so sure about Scott Lang.
Secretly he loves it because then he won‚Äôt even have to say anything. The team will tease them, and Tony will laugh and make some sort of off-kilter joke to colour the tips of Cap‚Äôs ears, and they can all move on.
‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Steve said shortly, breakfast interrupted by Clint and Natasha ambling out of the elevator and fighting over the remaining dredges of coffee in the carafe.
He knows exactly what Bucky‚Äôs going to say, and he can almost hear the reaction. In hindsight, maybe not his best moment?
Bucky rumbled audibly when the beep sounded. ‚ÄúStark. This is at least the third message I‚Äôve left you. ‚ÄòM startin‚Äô to take it personal. Call me back.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, we didn‚Äôt!‚Äù Clint interrupted. ‚ÄúHe said wagon wheels. The pretentious little Italian rich boy wants wagon wheels for dinner.‚Äù
and that it‚Äôs real, not something he has to say or wants to say to make it all go away. That he understands that he fucked up and fucked Tony over and Tony is worth it, he‚Äôs been worth it this whole time. That‚Äôs the hottest part, somehow, because nothing has ever really made sense when it comes to Steve and Tony‚Äôs messed up brain.
Lifting back the sheets, Steve crawled back into the bed with a shiver, curling onto his side where he could still see the sun.
The man that has Steve, literally, worshiping the ground he walks on. Bucky doesn‚Äôt owe Tony anything. So he chalks it up to guilt over the murder his mostly innocent parents and throws on some obnoxious, loud music to try and drown out his subconscious.
The Tony in front of him shifts into a seated position, taking Steve‚Äôs hand in both of his own and waits.
‚ÄúIf this is going to work you‚Äôve got to start seeing me for who I am. And you need to let me see you too. I don‚Äôt need you to be perfect. Just, admit when you‚Äôre not, and start listening to me, okay?‚Äù
Steve laughs into his mouth when Tony leans in for a kiss, carefree and happier than he‚Äôs been in a damned long time.
Steve smiles against his chest, reaching down to tug one of Tony‚Äôs thighs up higher. His erection rests heavy in the cradle of Tony‚Äôs body, slick and drooling with want against the trimmed hair between Tony‚Äôs legs. ‚ÄúYou always say that.‚Äù
Steve shakes with quiet laughter that feels foreign after so many tears and a memory so painful, and reaches down between them to pull the blanket up. The hospital room is cold and the blanket is a sorry excuse for warmth but with Steve at his side, Tony feels himself start to thaw and he nudges closer, wherever he can reach, out towards the ease and comfort that Steve‚Äôs brought with him.
‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs this?‚Äù Tony brushes away the tears creeping out of the corner of his eyes. ‚ÄúTalk to me.‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause, you arrogant, stubborn bastard, despite everything, I still want to have faith in you. I want to believe that ending our marriage meant something. I want to believe that you can be better than the man who lied to me, who stopped listening to me. Who tried to kill me, okay Steve? I want to believe there‚Äôs a better man in there.‚Äù He slaps his hands against his knees and gives the chair across from him a pointed look. ‚ÄúSo, which man are you gonna be?‚Äù
Tony is still slick and mostly open from the night before, and with the stretch of tender fingers, and a little extra lube, Steve is sliding home into his body again. Both of Steve‚Äôs arms wrap around his chest, pillowing under his head.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing this. No, Steve. I took a turn. I took a lot of turns. I took so many turns I don‚Äôt have an arm now! Why would you‚Äîhow could you volunteer me for something like this without even asking me?‚Äù
He closes his eyes, breathing in the aroma of Tony‚Äôs expensive cologne and the lingering smell of burnt metal in the air. When he opens them, he‚Äôs twenty-seven again and a lock of hair falls forward over his face. The button-down and slacks are comforting, wrapping him up in history and a visceral sense of familiarity that shakes him to his core.
Steve nods before he disappears through the doorway and Tony drops his head into his hands. All he can feel, all he can think, is that Steve is finally figuring it out, and that is so profoundly unfair. There‚Äôs no relief, just an open wound ripped wide again. Tony is bleeding all over the floor.
Steve hasn‚Äôt tried to kiss him, not in the entire time they‚Äôve been sleeping in the same bed, curled up together on the couch watching bad daytime TV, sitting pressed side by side when the doctors had told Tony his arm wouldn‚Äôt get any better, and recommended amputation.
So, when things started to change, Bucky assumed it was Tony that had set the ball in motion. Tony seemed to set everything in motion.
The second mistake comes when Tony turns and presses his forehead against Steve‚Äôs temple. He lets himself breath Steve in, inhaling the rich, spicy smell of his shampoo and something that‚Äôs unmistakably
Natasha sighs and leans against his workbench, effectively cutting off all his access to a new set of arrows he‚Äôs been working on for Clint and forcing him bodily into the conversation.
It would be so easy to let him stay. To welcome him back into his bed, his arms, his life. Except nothing has changed, this is just Tony coasting along with the high of his endorphins. Sex never changes these things. It only hurts, and Steve knows how to hurt him just right.
‚ÄúYes, Tony, it‚Äôs good,‚Äù Steve says, shaking his head as Tony beams down at him, panting. ‚ÄúThis is more than good. This is something worth holding onto. Wouldn‚Äôt you say?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I think you must be mistaken. I don‚Äôt remember signing anything that said I work for you, now.‚Äù Tony snaps.
Steve startles, looking from the midwife to Pepper to Tony. They‚Äôd just agreed on that name last night and to hear it from someone else‚Äî
Tony‚Äôs fear too intense to pass off as anything else, as Tony fell to his knees gasping and Bucky stumbled backwards.
Conversation stops when he steps into the room, eyes turning up expectantly, but that‚Äôs not what makes Steve‚Äôs breath catch in his throat. Across the room, Steve takes in the sight of his mother, dressed in her Sunday best, as young and beautiful as he remembers her from his childhood.
‚ÄúNever thought I‚Äôd land myself a sugar daddy.‚Äù Clint teased, leaning back in his chair with arms crossed behind his head as the room dissolved into laughter.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôll go if I tell ‚Äòim to take a hike.‚Äù Bucky said though he could already see the distress and protest in the look Steve was giving him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not together, Stark. You don‚Äôt have anything to worry about. That ended a long time ago and I‚Äôm not lookin‚Äô for anything. Not expectin‚Äô anything.‚Äù
Tony feels frustration clawing at the back of his mind. He‚Äôs already going to have to lose the arm, he knows that, and it feels supremely unfair that Steve can sit there and not say a word. As if it doesn‚Äôt matter. As if he doesn‚Äôt care. As if he really trusts Tony to‚Äî
‚ÄúHelp him!‚Äù Tony screamed into the storm, the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives rushing towards them. Natasha‚Äôs shock of red hair came into view, shoving through the pandemonium. She was on them in a second, fingers at Steve‚Äôs throat to feel for his pulse. Then the heels of her hands were pounding on his chest in a quick, steady rhythm and she breathed for him.
‚ÄúWell what are we gonna do?‚Äù Bucky demanded, letting Steve lead him by the elbow back towards the elevator and up to their shared floor.
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm going to kill you next time.‚Äù Steve pulls back slightly and shoots him a pained look. It‚Äôs neither the time nor the place, but he means it and Steve probably knows that. ‚ÄúNo, I won‚Äôt. But I‚Äôll melt down the shield and make it into something else. A set of bookends or something. Don‚Äôt think I won‚Äôt.‚Äù Tony pauses and rolls his eyes with a defeated sigh. ‚ÄúJust keep talking to Barnes, will you?‚Äù
Steve was groaning, panting into his shoulder, mouth open and pressing barely there kisses into his skin as Bucky was knot-deep inside him too, linking them all together with that aching stretch.
Disdain convulses across Tony‚Äôs face and before Steve can blink, he‚Äôs storming around the desk, stiff when he comes barrelling into Steve‚Äôs space. There‚Äôs a brief moment where Steve thinks Tony might cock back and knock him to the ground. He‚Äôs always said he‚Äôd love to punch him and maybe this is his chance. But once he‚Äôs close enough that Steve has to tip his head back to keep eye contact, Tony just fists a hand in his shirt and hauls him closer.
Steve does, hips pistoning faster now, with a hand sliding under Tony‚Äôs hip to grip his cock. He gets in one hard stroke before Tony‚Äôs smacking his hand away and shoving back harder. It hurts, and Tony wants it to hurt.
‚ÄúAnd now? Because if there‚Äôs something there, Tony, even a part of something, I‚Äôm willing to do what it takes. There‚Äôs a lot in the way and God knows it‚Äôs going to be awful. But if there‚Äôs something, I want to try. I want you and I‚Äôll work to deserve you, to earn back your trust and your respect. Whatever you need.‚Äù
Rhodey wraps him in a tight squeeze and guides him over to the table. Tony sits down with his family and eats his dinner the way he‚Äôs supposed to, a smile plastered on his face as Rhodey enlightens him on what he‚Äôs missed and demands new perks be added into his braces. Like being able to shoot missiles. Because Rhodey needs things like that.
What would Tony whisper to him? Something sweet this time. Tony would want to take things slow, to savour and enjoy. They‚Äôd just saved the world after all, and after the frantic passion had been sated there would be time for love and deep, desperate desire.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in this together,‚Äù Steve reminds him. Always. ‚ÄúMaybe not everything needs to be a battle anymore. Don‚Äôt you think we‚Äôre getting a little old for that, sweetheart?‚Äù
It hits him that Steve might be out of his depth. Between Bucky‚Äôs smart mouth and Tony‚Äôs sharp personality, he should have predicted they‚Äôd become fast friends.
after all this time has his burrowing closer, desperate to climb inside Steve‚Äôs skin and stay there forever.
‚ÄúFor the most part. It wasn‚Äôt this‚Äîwasn‚Äôt you. But I loved her, too. It wasn‚Äôt always easy, and some days I thought about going back. But it was a beautiful life and I wouldn‚Äôt change it.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were a drunk. A sleazy, slimy playboy who didn‚Äôt give a second thought to anyone but himself. You had the biggest ego I‚Äôve ever seen and you didn‚Äôt think about anyone but yourself. But then I got to know you. Slowly. And I started to see that that wasn‚Äôt much more than a fa√ßade you hid behind.‚Äù
In the end, it‚Äôs not difficult. It‚Äôs as simple as twisting his fingers through Tony‚Äôs and taking a stand. It‚Äôs as simple as accepting what they have to and refusing to budge on what they don‚Äôt.
Tony shakes his head, and the fine hairs tickle at Steve‚Äôs nipples. He tightens the arm he has wrapped around Tony‚Äôs midsection and pulls him in closer. It doesn‚Äôt matter that a few short hours later Tony was awake and smiling, or how Rhodes and Pepper had sat on either side of him and murmured constant reassurances. Until Steve had Tony in his arms again, kissing him through the daze of the anaesthesia, Steve had held his breath.
‚ÄúListen to me,‚Äù Tony hisses in his ear, mouthing at the soft skin below. ‚ÄúThis is the man I fell in love with. You‚Äôre beautiful. Delicate, breakable, and still the strongest fucking person I‚Äôve ever known.‚Äù Tony picks up the pace, grinding his hips into Steve‚Äôs ass and Steve can feel Tony‚Äôs cock in his throat, spearing through him.
It just so happened to be the night Tony came stumbling in drunk, having missed dinner altogether, marking a choice remark about Irish brothels that made Steve blush to the tips of his ears.
Tony doesn‚Äôt stop until he‚Äôs safely inside the car, barking orders to the driver before he folds in on himself in the backseat, shaking and gasping for breath.
The last person he passes is Barnes, who, even in the middle of the room, seems sunken in the shadows. The assassin‚Äôs eyes are trained on him, calculating his movements, cataloguing his reactions. It‚Äôs chilling and slips through the cracks of Tony‚Äôs shaky defenses with ease.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre meeting Laura and the kids to take them tobogganing.‚Äù Clint supplied. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be back sometime after dinner.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe said he wants to be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, so that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs going to be. I‚Äôm not pulling him in again, platypus.‚Äù
Steve struggles in his arms, fights, and Tony doesn‚Äôt let him go. He forces Steve back onto all fours and curls over him, pressing his forehead into the top of Steve‚Äôs spine, right at the base of his neck and lets out something of a sob of his own.
like he deserves better. It‚Äôs an axe hanging between the, waiting to sever the delicate threads of whatever this is and might become.
Tony finally wriggles Steve‚Äôs pants off and fists him again, sliding the tip of his cock against his hole dry, moaning when it catches against the rim in that way that drives Steve wild.
Steve takes the second leaflet from him, frowning as he opens the top page and takes in the heading. It‚Äôs so simple, just three little words, but Tony sees the moment that they slice through the last shred of his resolve and rip him to pieces.
A massive pile of blanket skitters across the floor as the burly super soldier underneath them scrambles backward and springs to his feet. Tony knows the moment Bucky registers who‚Äôs standing there, his expression waffling between defensive and sheepish but landing in a grim mixture of both.
?‚Äù Tony counters, pulling the tablet back. He punches in a series of numbers and a new video appears, the spider kid sneaking down an alley next to Stark Industries. He never reappears, but a minute later Tony‚Äôs intern appears around the corner and strides straight into the building.
Steve groans a steady stream of expletives that send shivers of heat up and down Tony‚Äôs spine and he feels his balls draw up tight to his body, his stomach curling with a tension that threatens to snap. With expert flicks of his wrist, he twists his fist around Steve‚Äôs cock and watches as his eyes flutter shut and his body tenses, arching forward and swallowing Tony‚Äôs length inside him entirely as he shatters and comes.
When the disbelief crumbles into stark realization, Tony physically staggers. One of his hands shoots out to brace himself against the tractor, and he looks like he can‚Äôt catch his breath. He‚Äôs a man laid low, if Steve‚Äôs ever seen one.
Steve comes to him as an old friend with a mosaic of history and Tony doesn‚Äôt allow it to go any further than that. Steve only falls out of step once, when his eyes linger on Morgan in Tony‚Äôs arms and he gives Tony the look of ‚Äò
Gasping into Tony‚Äôs mouth, torn between the desire to melt into the fantasy and shove it away, Steve tips Tony‚Äôs head back and claims him. He‚Äôs not here for awkward, fumbling kisses. He‚Äôs here for the passion and the rage, the atonement he never finds in his waking life.
orders and run with them. Knowing now that Steve will listen when he speaks, respects limits when he sets them, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs everything.
Tony loved that‚Äîwaking up in a hot pool of release knowing that he‚Äôd come from only the friction of Steve‚Äôs cock in his ass, forced to rut up against the sheets. And Steve would give that to him, too.
They‚Äôd buried men at sea for hundreds of years, hadn‚Äôt they? Stitched them up in white, said a rushed prayer and dumped their bodies into the sea for all eternity. During the war it had been a necessity. No casket, no flag, just a corpse and the endless rocking of the water for a man‚Äôs final rest.
As a heart attack. And you‚Äôd better get with the program, because if you pull any of your dramatics and screw this up, I won‚Äôt look the other way so easily this time.‚Äù At least he has the nerve to threaten Tony to his face.
Steve searches Bucky‚Äôs face, looking for some place that might give but Bucky isn‚Äôt fighting. He‚Äôs not going to hold him down or block his path. He just sits there, waiting, and Steve knows he won‚Äôt be able to make Bucky understand.
Tony collapses into his arm and the pain stops. The gauntlet falls away, dropping into the dirt where they fall, Tony on top of him. Steve can‚Äôt breathe, but he can feel Tony gasping, little hitching breaths. In his arms, Tony‚Äôs face is burnt. His beautiful, beautiful face, skin raw and blistered. His hair is flickering with embers and Steve runs a hand over it, through it.
Steve comes apart painstakingly slow under Tony‚Äôs firm touch, building to a peak before breaking and spilling over the horizon. Pleasure stretches along the contours of Steve‚Äôs body, illuminating the creases in his perfect skin and shadows in the hollows of his hips.
‚ÄúSome idiot wizard turned up today and said that Independence Day is on the horizon, and apparently that‚Äôs enough for Ross and the WSC to look the other way. All hands-on deck. I‚Äôm arranging your flights now, and FRIDAY is encrypting your pardon documents. They should be arriving on T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs private server as we speak.‚Äù
They unwrap each other with reverent fingers and it feels like touching bare skin for the first time. Tony‚Äôs work-rough hands explore the planes of his chest, thumbs dragging over his nipples and pressing down into the buttresses of his hips. The arc reactor gives off a gentle hum, lighting up Tony‚Äôs face and reflecting in the blown-black of his eyes and Steve considers that it might be impossible to resist Tony this way.
All at once, it‚Äôs worse than anything he‚Äôs experienced. Worse than free-falling from space or drowning in the cave in Afghanistan. Worse than any hangover he‚Äôs ever had and the betrayals that have trailed after him his entire life.
Sometimes, sitting perched astride Steve‚Äôs hips while he loses himself in pleasure is like watching the sunrise.
‚ÄúI‚ÄîTony, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Steve murmurs, shaking his head with sad, mournful eyes. ‚ÄúI need you to tell me how to fix this because I can‚Äôt figure it out. Just tell me.‚Äù
None of them had mentioned it, though Steve was sure that he wasn‚Äôt the only one that thought about it. Who wouldn‚Äôt, having found not one but
and see Steve‚Äôs massive arms wrapped around her small, sleeping frame. On those days, he stays away until the pain fades into the background and he can breathe again.
‚ÄúTony,‚Äù Steve groaned, barely more than a whisper, thrusting up into his fist and gasping as he imagined Tony watching, licking his lips and oh‚Äî
Steve brushes a hand over him, wiping as much as he can off the armour while Tony looks away. He refuses to let himself process that this is
"Oh my gosh, we were panicking so much," Steve chuckled. "Then Pete comes back with ice cream on his face and a new toy in his hand."
"Pete, kiddo, this isn't the time for you to have a tantrum. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen you pull a tantrum before..."
"What?" Ned asked, unsure of what his friend was trying to raise to his attention. He seemed scared, worried... Ned had heard of people listing stuff to calm themselves down but he didn't understand why Peter was so panicked by the dark.
Peter's eyes lit up, a smile forming on his face. "Wait... You mean I get to come on patrol with you and the rest of the squad?"
"I... I just don't feel up to it. I'd rather focus on anything but Midtown right now." Peter pulled out of his Dad's grasp, "Especially with everything else I'm going through..."
Peter stepped into his window, pulling off his mask. His hair stuck upwards, his brown curls waving in the breeze. "Fine..."
"And how many more people do we save?" Sam snapped, leaning back in his seat. "I understand that some lives are lost. But without us there would be no survivors. None!"
So the pair headed down the the hallway, running straight into Zemo himself. "Mr Stark, Mr Rogers... How wonderful it is to find you down in the hallways of my home. We've been expecting you. Obviously, you took a little longer than we might have hoped. We had to resort to some... creative uses for your son."
The young boy grit his teeth; the pain may have been bad but it wasn't... unbearable. At least it was nothing compared to what had happened the day before. However, the tension in his body lightened as Zemo removed his hand.
"I still want an answer. Whether I do or do not like it," Steve insisted, taking a step towards the shorter man.
"Two more shall take its place," finished Zemo. "It's why our founders chose the name... our organisation can never die out. We have the strongest men. We have weapons and knowledge that Shield would die for. And they will... at our hands."
The Winter Soldier looked to his supervising officer, his face as emotionless as always, and waited for an order. Usually when the sirens went off, he was dragged out to fight: or he was placed back under cyro, to wait for another day. However, this time he had been stationed to wait. No exact orders. Just to wait for Zemo.
"It'll be okay, Steve," he said, finally, standing up and putting his arm around his friend. "I'm with you till the end of the line, pal."
The teen watched in horror as the man's metal hand landed upon a control panel. He tried to scream no, to tell Bu- the Soldier to stop but he couldn't. No sound came out. He was well and truly done for.
Clambering out of the bed as eagerly as he would on Christmas day, Peter scampered across the room and crouched down beside the tray. Cautiously, as if fearing that it was a trick and would explode the second he touched it, Peter picked up the spoon and cautiously sipped at the soup. It was watery, bland, and bitty, but it tasted like the finest chocolates to his starved body. He couldn't fool himself into thinking it was chocolate for long, as it was freezing cold and couldn't warm his insides as chocolate would.
"Yeah..." Tony had used that excuse many a times, when he was younger, and quickly decided to cover up for his son. "I still set him homework, though. It helps him learn to deal with deadlines."
Peter braved himself as he watched the blade curve and turn on his skin, drawing out a symbol. It kept on going - the precision of the knife never failing, for what felt like hours. Time was really like that: it goes quick when you're having fun but when you're being tortured, and you just want to escape reality... it pauses. Freezes. And waits until the worst is over to continue.
"Your's weren't bad or anything... these are just better," he replied, picking up another handful of fries.
Peter once more obliged, stretching his hands out in front of him, and letting his gaze fall to the floor. The metal cuffs that were placed around his wrists gnawed into his skin. They dug into his skin and almost drew blood. After taking a deep breath, he asked bravely, "Where are you taking me?"
The four continued to fight, trying to escape from the others in the area. Someone threw a bomb at a building, sheltering the street in rubble. The man in black let go of Sam's leg, grabbing at Bucky and Steve swerved the vehicle through the debris, leaping out and pulling the man away from his friend.
"Hello, is this your car out front?" Zemo asked, slyly. He took a few steps towards the Russian, unsure of how easy it would be to gain the intel he needed. "I jumped the curb," he explained, "Maybe we could take care of it ourselves, though. If you wanna call the cops, tha- that's okay too, I guess."
Peter rushed into his room in a strop: immediately heading to his main closet. He grabbed his largest suitcase, the blue and red one that Dad and Pops had bought him for their holiday to Corfu, and started to angrily throw clothes into it.
Peter spun on the spot to face the door. His eyes widened at what he could see. Ned was laughing, pulling out his blue lightsaber as a joke, whilst the other teen tried to stop his shaking.
"They were Shield agents, Dad! Level 7! That's higher than you. So, I skimmed through a few of their files and documents. My father... my birth father, was the person who modified those spiders back at Oscorp."
His metabolism seemed to be finally taking his toll, as his insides felt as if his stomach was eating away at itself. There had to be food, he thought to himself, there just had to be. No place, no matter how horrid, had no food inside it. Fortunately, luck was on his side for seemingly the first time in hours, as his heightened senses picked up food that proved to be there. On a tray - a white tray, of course - was a glass of water and a bowl of soup.
"What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people."
Tony put his arm around the teen, when they walked into the lab. He could see the anxiety building up beneath the boy's skin, showing through the creases in his pale skin. Peter had been trying to suppress the worst of it: the way he could feel this weird tingling sensation throughout his body, the way he could hear the conversations of people far away, the way he could barely focus on one point of view. And that had made it worse.
"You're going to read this, –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤/asset, you're going to read this and then repeat back to me everything it says."
"Tony," Steve said firmly, relieved to have finally been able to put a word in. "Someone dies on your watch, you don't give up."
"Well, anyway, I was looking through some of the files and I came across one which had my parents' names on it."
"None at all, Tony. I'll call Peter and Bucky, see what's wrong," Steve said smoothly, refusing to be aggravated by the matter.
There goes Plan A. If he can't go looking for Bucky, or this person who claims to be Bucky, what is he meant to do? Just sit around and twiddle his thumbs? No way. That won't happen. That can't happen. "Are you saying you'll arrest me?" He wouldn't put it past her but after the law few years he doubted she would be that cold towards him.
"What?" asked the boy, turning his head towards the source of the sound. There had been nobody else in the room before, he was certain of that.
"Which one's that?" Tony asked, more out of fatherly love than the desire to know which nerdy creation his son was building in his bedroom. He often bought the kid new sets but he didn't really check what they were, only to make sure Peter didn't already have it. Occasionally, when he wasn't too busy with Stark Industries or the Avengers Initiative, the genius would sit in Peter's room with him, helping him with his Lego. He was definitely putting his MIT education to good use. He chuckled, quietly.
"They'd know your identity, Pete... you'd have to sign both your alias and your real name. They'd make in public information. You're already in a hell of a lot of danger being my son. But as Spider-Man... well, we'd have criminals lining up outside to come kill you."
"Well, I love them, Tony exclaimed - ruffling his hands through Peter's hair. "However, I don't think Pops will be able to deal with two Iron Men in this Tower. To be honest, I'm not completely sure how he deals with just one."
Peter sat down on one of the hospital-like beds, shuffling up enough for Tony to sit beside him. Once he was seated next to his Dad, he said: "I can hear everything. I can hear the conversations of people in different rooms... in different buildings for that matter."
"I don't know," the blond sighed, "Whatever  would be in his better interest. If Tony has to get stripped of his rights to custody... well, that just means he's no longer fit to be a father."
After the chain from Peter's wrists to the desk was fastened, Blondie left the room - leaving Peter alone with another man... "Oh no," he whispered under his breath, realising who that man was.
Natasha walked over to Steve. He had been standing quietly alone in the aisle. His black clothes clung to his shaking figure. Nat had never seen him like this. Ever. "When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her," the soldier mumbled, his eyes still facing the ground.
"Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt." Now, the man was trying to humour the Captain. It wasn't going to work, though. Instead it just added to the uneasiness created by being without his shield. It was almost as if a part of him was missing.
Peter walked out through reception, sighing in relief when the cold air of the outside world hit him. He was sweating, whether it was from nerves or heat he couldn't tell, and his vision was blurring.
"Why not?" Tony repeated, "Because, one, it would be breaking the judge's rulings, and two you've got schoolwork to do."
"Peter," Steve said softly as he gently tucked the boy's curls out of his hazel eyes. "You awake, bud?"
"He still has that toy, you know. He left it with me, though," Tony replied, with some bitterness in his voice.
"When does he usually sleep until?" Bucky asked curiously, keeping his voice down as Steve's footsteps padded over the carpet. "He's a teenager, don't teenagers usually sleep in?"
At that moment, Peter's bedroom door opened and, the boy tiptoed out of the room. He was wearing black tracksuit pants, and a Captain america tee, and was rubbing his eyes sheepishly. "Bucky, what was all that shouting? Who are you?" he asked, blinking rapidly.
"Where're you going, Dad?" Peter asked, watching as the brunet rushed past him - sunglasses in hand.
Dragging the teen to his feet, Zemo detached the chain that bound Peter to the table, and threw him against a wall. "Do you really want to test my patience, –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤/asset?"
"Just remembered the Stark Expo... damn that would have been neat if Howard had managed to get that car to work."
"So am I. I haven't been this stressed since the last time Peter ran off," Steve replied, a smile tugging at his lips.
"You mean I have to put up with all your flirting, which, by the way, you are not that good at?" Peter asked. His eyes widened. His lip dropping. This was the look Peter gave his father whenever he wanted something. And in all fairness, that didn't happen very often. The kid was grateful. Extremely grateful.
Fun? That word didn't seem great coming from Zemo's mouth. In fact, nothing he said ever seemed worth celebrating.
Peter stared out of his window, watching as the skyscrapers and buildings went by in a haze of browns, whites and reds. What was it that Katie had said? He searched through the back of his mind, trying to cut out the conversation he had had with his friend; he only needed the background sound: the information the tour guide had given them.
Except it had been a week already...¬† and Tony and Steve growing nervous. Peter had been through a lot - S.H.I.E.L.D. had found the files and documents of what Hydra had done to him, and all of it had disgusted them.
As a pair, Iron Man and Captain America were the epitome of stealth and organisation. They infiltrated the base with next to no trouble, and were soon creeping through the halls and listening out for any noise. The noise came in the form of Steve dropping his shield on the metal floor.
"Tell me more about Peter," Bucky exclaimed, his arms wrapped around the blond. The man had mentioned him a few times briefly but had never gone into detail.
Steve nodded numbly. "Why are we automatically assuming that Peter's been kidnapped? That really says something about how much faith you have in me as a parent."
"You're Steve..." Bucky replied, slowly. "I read about you in a museum." Steve quickly realised that Bucky was back to himself yet he didn't have his memories. Stupid Hydra and their stupid mind-wipes.
The pair sat in silence for a little longer, before Bucky broke it once more. "I'll leave the KFC in here, Peter. Your Pops will be back soon... he's on a mission. I'll... I'll be in the lounge if you need me."
"Same sort of stuff as Pops. But I can climb, and I have this sixth sense. I call it my Spidey sense," Peter rambled, stopping when he saw the bemused expression on Bucky's face.
Bucky broke a bannister and swung down on it. The sound of wood snapping flooding the soldier with more adrenaline. He then took out another three men, careful to make sure no one is behind him.
"Before he parked it behind a desk," Tony picked up the kettle and slammed it against the table. "See the world... Maybe be of service." Sam stood there, his body tensing as he forced himself not to shiver. "Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which I what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where. Sokovia."
Spider-Boy, or was it Spider-Kid? Wait. No. Spider-Man, that was it! A radioactive spider bite at a place named Oscorp. He was Spider-Man. But that couldn't be his real name. Peter. He was sure of it by now, his name was Peter. Peter Stark-Rogers. He was a superhero, and he would make it out of here alive.
"If it's Avengers related, why is it just us two? Don't you need the whole team for this kinda stuff?"
"Fine... but only because I don't want to deal with a man that can fight pretty swell and an arrogant man in a suit..."
Steve watched as Falcon swooped down from the sky, heading right towards Steve. "Sam, southwest roof." He braced himself for the impact, and threw himself off the roof onto the neighbouring building.
"Bucky isn't crazy!" Steve blurted suddenly, eyes snapping up to lock with Tony's. It sounded as if he hadn't spoken for hours.
"It's just... it seems a bit like a rebound relationship," the blond shrugged. He was quick to add, "To me," after noticing that Tony was now sending him death glares.
The boy, now unsure of what to think, hesitated before getting up. His knees almost buckling under the sudden movement. "Who was he?"
"Fine," muttered Peter, then as he saw his Dad's hands holding something behind his back, "What is it? Did you finish the suit?"
"Y'know I'm not part of Hydra - right? I never will be. I won't. I... won't," said Peter, in a way that was more of a reassurance to himself than a response to the man. His eyes followed the man, who was now picking up a large book, the cover of which was blue and coated in dust.
Peter quickly closed his browser - deleting his search history - before spinning around on his chair. "It was just a lot to take in, y'know, Pops and Bucky..."
"And I still do," the billionaire said with a slight hint of rage in his voice. Yet, he was still keeping his calm relatively well, especially after the amount of 'definitely coffee, nothing stronger' he had consumed between the boardroom and the penthouse.
Bucky's eyes widened in confusion, and amazement, as he heard the Irish woman's voice appear from nowhere. It wasn't exactly frightening to him, though, he had always been a lover for technology. He could remember the last time him and Steve went to an expo together... a Stark expo. One that Tony's father had hosted. They had seen a flying car - that hadn't quite worked - and he was now wondering if Howard had ever perfected it.
Instead, Steve found it funny, chuckling behind his hand for several moments until he regained his composure. "Right, moment over... let's set off, shall we?"
She placed her hand over her heart and exclaimed, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt write it... though,  I do wish I was able to take credit for that.‚Äù She again suppressed her laughter at Sam‚Äôs facial expressions. She pressed a small, silver button and pointed up at the screen; the audio of it was now turned on.
"Well, someone's gotta look out for the little guy, right? And, when I'm not here, who better to than you?"
"Hate you too, Capsicle!" Tony quipped. "Kinda wished Howard hadn't helped you illegally go storm that base." He glanced across at Steve's confused face, and added, "Oh yeah, you can bet he was real proud of the fact that he had done something important for America's glorious Captain. Never shut up about it."
Tony glanced down at his Rolex before replying with a simple, "Nine thirty." This was the time Tony usually woke up at, unless of course Peter had school - which wasn't a problem now, however the teenager seemed distraught. You see, Peter wasn't one of those 'imma stay up all night on tumblr and wake up at eleven' kids. Sure, he had stayed out pretty late on the few occasions him and his Dad had gone out patrolling: but that was different. He would always wake up early. He had alarms set from 5:30am every morning, and stuck to them every single day.
"There probably should be 350 spider's in here, but for some reason the scanner is only detecting 349 life forms," Katie said, her eyes frantically searching through the cage: hoping to find the source of the missing spider. "It probably just died. Most of the animals that are not used to the experiments do. However, it is always in a non-painful way," she reassured the group.
Opening the door in a heat of the moment hurry, Tony and Steve ran into the room. They were faster than any other lifeform on Earth - even faster than Quicksilver, Wanda's brother... the one who had died saving Barton, and that kid. The bags under both of their eyes were showing, however at this moment they felt more awake than they had in awhile.
Something cold and dark takes over in Steve‚Äôs belly, a tight fist wrapped around his insides, squeezing. The words are out of his mouth before he can stop himself. ‚ÄúKids won‚Äôt bring Peter back, Tony.‚Äù
Steve props himself up on one elbow and palms the side of Tony‚Äôs face. How Steve can caress him as if he‚Äôs something delicate and worthy of being cherished, Tony doesn‚Äôt know. He‚Äôs hurt Steve just now, cut him deep, and Steve wears that baldly across his face. He‚Äôs holding Tony anyways.
‚ÄúWe should test how good those senses stand up against my arrows.‚Äù Clint‚Äôs fingers twitch as if he‚Äôs prepared to reach behind him and grab arrows that aren‚Äôt there.
He watches with his breath in his throat as Tony pry the gauntlet off Peter‚Äôs wrist. Tony slides it down his own, Peter half collapsed against his chest.
Steve quirks an unusual smile, the right corner of his mouth quivering before it tips up and he shoots him a genuine flash of teeth.
The suit failed as they reached the edge of the ship, sending Tony and Steve sprawling across the deck, shattering through boxes of cargo and slamming into the side of the vessel. Before he could issue another order, the suit released and Tony was scrambling out between desperate breaths, prying away what he could with numb fingers.
So why does even thinking the words leave his breath catching in his throat and his heart racing in his chest, pounding against the back of the arc reactor as if it might escape through his ribcage and run back to Steve at the first chance?
The Alpha‚Äôs eyes flashed, instincts flaring when his Omega forced him back into a submission but he didn‚Äôt rise to the challenge. Instead, the room swelled sharply with Bucky‚Äôs arousal, whipped cream enfolding them.
‚ÄúPeople?‚Äù But Steve already knows. He doesn‚Äôt know how he knows, but there‚Äôs a little tug at the back of his mind and he can
‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Tony glances over the seatback to see Steve hovering in the doorway, tie loose and looped around his neck, jacket over one arm and his sleeves rolled up to the elbows. He looks so handsome Tony wants to cry, wrap his fingers around his forearms and hold him still so he can trace his thumbs across the strong, steady pulse in Steve‚Äôs wrists.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to bring Peter back. I‚Äôm not trying to‚Äîto replace him. Nothing could ever‚Äî‚Äù Tony‚Äôs voice shakes, and he swallows, hard. Steve‚Äôs aghast to find tears in Tony‚Äôs eyes, and the apologies can‚Äôt come quick enough.
Tony readjusts in the bed, fiddling with the edge of the strap to the harness that keeps his destroyed arm close to his belly. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre releasing me tomorrow.‚Äù He forces himself to meet Steve‚Äôs eye. ‚ÄúOkay. Yeah, okay.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing!‚Äù Steve cries, desperation so palpable Tony thinks this must be what a caged tiger feels like, padding endlessly in circles, eyes white around the edges with fear. ‚ÄúThat fucking terrifies me. I keep asking myself if I say the wrong thing ‚Äòis he going to leave,‚Äô ‚Äòis it all going to fall apart again‚Äô and I can‚Äôt take that Tony. I can‚Äôt. So if that‚Äôs where this is headed then just say it. Say it!‚Äù
Steve frowns, lips pursing as he holds up a legal-sized envelope, thin enough that it could be empty. ‚ÄúOur Judgement was ready.‚Äù
Later, he'll ask Steve to squeeze the air from his lungs until the world narrows and all he knows is pleasure and the twinkling lights of the night sky refracting in the depth of Steve‚Äôs eyes.
Steve hangs the photo of all three of them, Steve, Tony and Bucky, in the room he‚Äôll make into an art studio. Bucky is pressed between them, rolling his eyes at Tony‚Äôs peace sign, and the grin on Steve‚Äôs face feels like a distant, foreign memory now.
Steve freezes up, his arms tightening so severely that Tony can see how his biceps are trembling under the strain. The colour drains out of his face and his mouth opens and closes. Once, twice. When they do come, the words are so quiet he could have missed them. ‚ÄúDo you really think that?‚Äù
Zemo pointed to a screen, and then to the door, before answering Steve's question. "He's in there. But I wouldn't go in there right now."
Zemo looked around the apartment, turning over every inch of it. Eventually he came across a book. A blood red book with a dark star on its front. He smiled to himself. If he had to use this book and other darker methods to get what he wanted then so be it. He glanced behind him at his handiwork. Karpov was tied upside down from the ceiling, his head in a sink, which was slowly filling with water. He would be dead within the half hour.
The sound of siren blaring suddenly flooded the room. Something bad was happening. Something awful. The boy wasn't too sure what it was - but alarms were bad. Fire alarms, school alarms, all alarms... none of them led to good.
A strange sensation waved over Peter. He couldn't be Spider-Man, now. He had to wait for the UN to let him. He could train, of course. But, he couldn't go out every night with his Dad. He couldn't save people unless he was given permission. The teen took a deep breath. He knew this was better than the alternative. If his identity was ever revealed to the government then he would be forced to give it up forever... and it was likely there would be worse consequences too.
The armed forces moved in quicker, forcing Bucky to his knees. Some moved Steve's arms behind his back, making sure he couldn't 'try any funny business'. The man in black raised his hands, pulling off his mask as they ignore him and turn their attention to Steve. The man was T'Challa, the Wakandan Prince, or now King.
Peter sat down on the school bus, beside his best friend. "Hey, Ned," he said as he pulled out his phone.
"Provided I'm not totally misreading this situation, you're implying that it isn't Bucky but it could be the Winter Soldier?"
Peter began to open his mouth to make a quip - a trait of Tony's that had rubbed off on him, but shut it almost instantly. There was no point going through pain like that again... none at all. He felt the cold, metal hand grasp his pyjama tee's collar, and closed his eyes. He was shivering, shuddering and shaking: his teeth chattering as he held his breath, waiting for whatever would come next. "Move it," spat Bucky, kicking the back of Peter's shins.
"Go pack your bags, Pete," he muttered, waving his hand in dismiss. He went back for another drink from the bottle.
Steve said nothing. The absence of a good friend and colleague hurt. Fury, however, seemed to never grieve. Never.
"Yes," Peter spat, working up all of his courage to rebel. He couldn't let them win. He wouldn't... He was Spider-Man, he was a hero. "You won't kill me. I know that. You need me alive," he added bravely.
"He's our son, for gosh sake, why can't I know?" Steve asked, trying his upmost best not to clench his fists.
"Yes, I get it, we're both older than we look - some of us," Bucky placed a hand on his chest, "Look a lot younger than we actually are..."
Nat shook her head. "She's right. If this a planned attack it reminds me too much of my... my previous jobs."
"Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir." Tony shoved his phone back into his pocket. He looked sympathetically at Peter, knowing full well what it felt like to be stuck in your father's business room with nothing to do.
"Rusted, Furnace, Daybreak-" the man continued, smirking as the soldier placed his hands over his ears: his attempts to muffle out the sound failing. The words were tearing at his memories. The warm thoughts and feelings. His love towards Steve.
"Six m-" Peter whispered, "That's a long time." He grinned, his voice getting louder, "For a second there, I thought it had been a few years. I mean, Dad, your hair really is going grey."
Steve thought back to a conversation he and Bucky had had prior to everything. And by everything, he meant the incident of his son being kidnapped.
"You and Bucky, and yes I know you two are a thing," he added after seeing Steve's expression, "Where are you two staying? After The Hub..."
"Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives," Tony said, picking up a small black case. He grinned, showing Peter the contents of it. "Felt timely... FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most."
"Of course, you'll be amazing. It'll be a little rocky at first, but it always is when you learn something new. He seems to like you as a chess partner, if that's any consolation."
‚ÄúBird costume?‚Äù Sam said, annoyed. He sighed, loudly. ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù He placed the paper on the table and gave Sharon a look that anyone could read.
The teenage boy was still confused: his Pops had said that the meeting - the accords, or whatever he had referred to them as - was going to affect him in a big way. But... what were the accords, exactly? The billionaire had assured him that he would inform him about anything concerning him that had come up in the meeting. However, Peter had doubts that his father would tell him the whole truth.
Peter glanced at him and responded slightly shyly with, "Hi..." Steve had sat down on the couch, next to Bucky, but had made space on the right of him for Peter.
"I thought you said you homeschooled him, Tony?" Steve asked, still glancing at the empty space Peter had disappeared from.
"Focus up," Tony interjected. He fluttered his hands in the air before continuing. "I'm sorry. Did I just mishear you, or did you agree with me?"
"It's fine, kiddo, we can pick them up later," Tony reassured his son, picking up the Iron Man build-a-bear and laughing. "You actually kept this thing?"
Then for the next hour and a half, the two Avengers went though files of paperwork, until they had legally divorced.
"His parents were killed in a plane crash, Pete was the only one to make it out alive... unscarred actually. Then he lived with his Aunt and Uncle up until the Battle but their apartment building was destroyed... Peter was the lone survivor."
Steve coughed in amusement, "Yeah, yeah, we all know that I still look like a twenty year old." Bucky playfully shoved him, earning himself a grin from the blond.
"Kid, it's half seven," Tony said, an idea forming in his mind. "Do you want me to order in pizza, then we go work down in the labs?"
"Objection overruled," announced the judge, "Mr Rogers is correct, matters concerning your child should be shared, whether or not you believe they are deemed 'important'."
After a few moments of silence, Steve managed to regain some control of the bike and overtake the van he'd been swearing at for the past ten minutes. "What's the news going 'ballistic' about?" he asked eventually.
"Nope," Peter stated, "Auntie Tasha said I should wear a Hulk onesie seeing as it's Doctor Banner's birthday today. She said we need a bit of Hulk and Bruce around the Tower to remind everyone about him."
The number was unknown but it was obvious who they were on about. Peggy. It broke his heart to say he saw it coming, after all he was a man out of time- all of his friends, other than Bucky, had grown old without him. Most had died. Her time had ran out, however morbid it sounded.
Shaking his head in disbelief and confusion, the boy queried, "Who are you? How... How did you get in here?"
Peter jumped up from the couch, webbing the remaining bags of food towards him and his Dad. "I'm starving!"
The other three around the table burst out laughing. "Yes, Tony, I'm sure Iron was named after you," Pepper said through her chuckles. "Boys, when was it found?"
Steve vanished from the room, probably to find his shield. Tony only realised his comment was mean when Steve walked past him again, muttering under his breath to himself, "He's my son too."
The Stark raised his eyebrows, taken back slightly by the sudden question. "Uh, yeah... I've worked on a few flying cars. Did one for this guy who really loved his cars, once. Think he named her Lola, or something..."
Peter begrudgingly followed his Dad into the Tower. Every single sound, every little whisper, was amplified in his head. He could hear - and at the same time not hear - the words his Dad was saying to him. It was like being in a room and watching as people spoke, hearing the words, but not understanding any of it.
At this exact moment, 5:47pm June 3rd 2016, Tony was sat on the chair beside Peter's bed: a book in his hands. He was there purely because there was nowhere else he could be: Dum-E was trying to clear up his lab, emphasise on the trying, and the rest of the team were being secretive - mainly his ex, and his boyfriend.
"Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you."
Peter glared at the man, his fists clenching as much as they could with the handcuffs on them. "Where am I, who are you?" he muttered, his breathing becoming shaky.
Steve walked up to Bucky. His hair was slightly shorter. He was wearing a maroon jacket. But, it was his Bucky. The Bucky he hadn't seen in six months. "Do you know me?" he asked, his eyes flickering back towards Sam, occasionally. They were in Romania, Bucharest to be precise.
"Then why don't you go do something?" snapped Steve, throwing his head backwards before letting it drop into his hands. He was trying his upmost best not to yell, not to shout, but it was hard - and it was draining him.
Nine hours later, Steve walked down into the lab, only to find Tony frantically running around the messy room. He looked at his husband with concern. The billionaire looked a state: his hair was sticking up all over the place, there were dark bags underneath his eyes. He appeared to have been down there all day, researching or experimenting or doing whatever Tony Stark does. "Tones, you need to get some sleep," the soldier stated, hoping to get through to him.
Natasha was struggling to lie. Steve could hear how untrue it was just by the way she was saying it. He needed another way to get to his boyfriend.
Natasha smirked. "I'm training with Peter, later. Tony asked me to teach him how to throw a decent punch... not sure why though." She eyed the doorway, and watched as the two Starks walked in. "Speaking of the devil..."
"No," protested Peter, his smile fading, "But not Bucky. He... He went bad, Dad, he let them hurt me."
He didn't look okay. He was trembling. There was sweat rolling down his face. His breathing was shaky. Steve was positive he was lying. "How have you been after all-"
"Because, Captain Rogers, I may not look that old - but my time as a field agent has gone and come. You're the best we've got and you've done this before."
Bucky burst out laughing, unable to keep a straight face. "You thought Peggy Carter and Howard Stark? Oh my gawd, you're adorable."
"Morning Peter, have a good night's sleep?" Steve asked, hugging his son for a brief, few seconds before returning to get his breakfast.
Tony put his arms around Peter, "It's okay, kiddo. Let's do some spider-stuff to take your mind off it."
"Mostly good stuff, kiddo," Bucky replied, chuckling slightly. "Relax, I'm joking. Yeah, he's told me about how smart you are - and that you've got heart."
"What do you mean you don't want me to?" exclaimed the teen, sounding more lively and awake than he had at all that evening. "You...you told Pops that the Accords were a good idea, didn't you? You disagreed with him."
"You're an intelligent boy, aren't you, –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤/asset? Do you know what this is a symbol of?" Zemo asked, pressing his hand down on the bleeding cut on Peter's arm.
"I'm not sure, bud... I'm not sure." The billionaire looked out of the car window, watching the buildings disappear whilst Happy drove them back to the Tower. A few more minutes of silence followed before Tony finally asked, "What do you want for your birthday this year, kiddo?"
"She probably just said that to scare us," Flash whispered to Ned, after noticing his trembling form.
The boy knew it was there, but he couldn't physically feel it. It was an abstract feeling, One you couldn't quite describe if you tried. "I don't know what you're talking about. Everything you've said to me has been a lie. You're trying to turn me against them. It won't work, though. It won't."
"Hey, bud," the genius said calmly. He nudged a pile of books to the side, before sitting down beside his son. "Aren't you meant to be sleeping right about now? Isn't it like... eleven at night?"
Peter greeted Tony at the bottom of the Tower, wearing only his pyjamas - despite the time. "Hiya, Dad. How'd it go?"
"Just make sure to keep your face covered... for two reasons. One we don't want any of my enemies finding out you're the newest hero. Two you're meant to be sick off school."
Bucky pulled himself up off the ground but his luck is quick to disappear as he is quickly slammed against a wall. He blinks, trying to regain control of his spinning vision. It felt like he was on a carousel, the world swiftly turning around him. It was quick to come back, though, probably due to the effects of the serum. That had to be one of the pluses of being The Winter Soldier.
"That is all, your honour," said Steve as he walked back over towards Bucky. The man received a pat on the shoulder from the brunet and a friendly smile.
"D-dad?" Peter stuttered, his face crimson, his eyes wide in shock. A part of the boy still imagined his Pops and Dad getting back together, despite the fact that Pops had already moved on. His Dad had been looking at his CEO, in a way Peter could only describe as admiration, for years. Maybe he should have seen it coming... but then again since when did the expected every actually happen?
"The news is going ballistic," Tony commented casually, listening to Steve swear - and by swear, he means say words such as heck and gosh, and complain about how sticky the gears on his motorbike were.
"I was always in here. I never left. But they're trying to get rid of me. They think they've succeeded as well. They won't. The bad guys never win."
"That... And I've got a headache," Peter answered, not elaborated on the details as he didn't want to stress his Dad out.
Nothing bad happened that evening. In fact neither of the Starks had to step in at all. All crimes they spotted were mediocre, so Friday and Karen would automatically contact the cops.
Steve eyebrows lowed, his eyes narrowing at the sight of who it is. Of course, the man wanted revenge on his friend, who did not and Steve will always repeat do not kill his father. However, he was slightly confused. And, after a second, he found himself staring at the young man with a look of confusion painted across his face.
Tony span on the spot to face the soldier. He couldn't quite believe what he was hearing. He took a few deep breaths, before figuring out what to say: "See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to... What do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?"
The assassin bit her lip, using all her training to keep her cool. The Avengers couldn't retire. Not when the world was just getting even more dangerous. Not right now. They would retire when they were sure Earth was safe, protected. Even if that meant going against the United Nations, and anyway it wasn't like Natasha hasn't broken the law before.
Tony left the courtroom distraught. He had two weeks to prove that old Capsicle wasn't good enough to look after Pete. That would be challenging, though, seeing as the man had been rather great at raising the boy.
"Da-a-a-ad," Peter whined, pulling away from his father's grip on his hand, once they had reached the penthouse. He was embarrassed, confused and annoyed... maybe not so much of the latter. "If Miss Potts is coming over later, what am I doing?"
The schematics make sense, but he just can‚Äôt quite get it right without Sam feeling like he‚Äôs lilting to the left. At this point, Tony is pretty sure Sam
The suit takes the weight of his fall, but in that split second, Steve can almost get his hand around the gauntlet. It‚Äôs just out of reach, beyond both their grasp. Steve struggles through the dirt, mud in his mouth and Tony‚Äôs hands clawing at his sides.
Natasha flicks one red-painted thumb, and the next picture is a grainy image of the two of them, Steve‚Äôs swim trunks riding dangerously low on his hips and Tony in his arms. They‚Äôre kissing, the sun gleaming off their wet skin as Steve walks them out of the ocean and back up towards the mansion.
Steve rolls his shoulders back, and for the briefest moment, Tony thinks he might actually be talking to Captain America. They blur together before his eyes, a mixture of earnest regard and fierce determination, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like the man he‚Äôd married. There‚Äôs a touch too much of that red, white and blue.
‚ÄúCat‚Äôs out of the bag, Cap.‚Äù Tony quirks an eyebrow at him, deferring to Steve‚Äôs lead as if it weren‚Äôt Tony who‚Äôd asked to keep things quiet, just a little while longer. Steve steps in close, resting a hand on the dip of his back and peeks at the phone over his shoulder.
‚ÄúHow long has it been since you felt good?‚Äù Tony slides his hand up the inside of Steve‚Äôs arm, tracing light across the wrinkle of skin on the inside of his elbow, before dropping off onto the side of his waist. One of Steve‚Äôs hip bones angles into Tony‚Äôs palm, just above the low-hanging fabric of his plaid sleepwear.
Tony turns in his arms and captures his mouth. It should be sweet and soft, all the gentle things that they‚Äôd ignored when they‚Äôd been desperate and clawing at each other. Except it‚Äôs just as heated as before and Tony can feel the arousal pool in his stomach all over again, his cock twitching valiantly in his pants.
A thumb flicks over one of his nipples, and Steve jerks into him, chasing after his mouth. ‚ÄúI thought you helped design this?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou love this.‚Äù Steve drops a kiss on the side of his head and stretches out beside him, toeing off his shoes and crossing his arms behind his head. The sun laps at his socked feet and disappears where the shade starts at his knees.
Tony wraps his arms around Steve‚Äôs neck but not before guiding Steve‚Äôs hands to his hips. And then they‚Äôre swaying together, everything else bleeding into the background while Tony plays with strands of his hair and lets his gaze drop down to Steve‚Äôs mouth.
It was a near perfect depiction of the friendship Bucky and Tony had created, sprouting from the ashes of Siberia and having grown into something truly amazing.
It rolled in a circle like a metal lid dropped on the ground, making a booming noise on impact and grating noisily for several seconds before Steve put his foot on it.
Oh right... Peter thought to himself. Ned didn't know about anything that had happened. He just thought that Peter was away: travelling. To him there was no coma, no fighting, no torture, no Hydra. No Spider-Man. And, that was the it had to stay. Peter wouldn't be able to live with himself if something happened to Ned because of him.
