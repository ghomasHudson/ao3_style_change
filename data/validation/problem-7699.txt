The world whited out before him as sounds transformed from screaming to a brutal, guttural growl. Spittle had splattered across his face as he struggled against the metal hand clamped around his throat, threatening to crush his trachea. He could barely make a sound. He gasped for air but the maniac holding him down never ceased. His eyes were an inferno of anger, his face a grimace of loathing. He was hell bent on killing Tony.
“Are you sure, Bruce and I built Ultron?” It haunts Tony. He doesn’t often admit to it, that he actually questions he’s own judgement. “People died because of Ultron. Died because of us – of me.”
As the rays dried his lips and the taste of blood filled his mouth, Tony squinted as the world started to blur around him. His eyes. God, his eyes! Every blink scraped the cornea raw. The glistening sun against the tarmac of the roof top baked his retinas and he swore he could feel the fine cones and rods of the back of his eyes flake off as the vitreous humor dried. He moaned as he pulled and tugged against the nails impaling him to the wooden beams. He refused to die like this. He refused to become like that thing hanging on the cross not two meters from him – still alive. It shifted at any sound he made.
“Your eyes look fine,” Steve blurts out and then stammers. Just standing close to him, Tony can feel the vibrations of actual embarrassment. “I mean-.”
Tony’s eyes flare with annoyance and a touch of rage. “He could have killed you; I did what I had to do.”
Steve jerks and turns to find Stark – Tony- standing at the doorway to the building. His arms are folded and he analyzes Steve with a critical eye. Steve does nothing to hide the old scars lining his back.
Swallowing, he shook his head and the hot tears fell down his face. The pain robbed him of his voice. Her weight shifted and then a light kiss touched his cheek.
Even his friend Sam Wilson, a former slave, went westward when the war ended. He didn’t wait around looking for opportunity in a land overrun by carpetbaggers and former slave owners looking to shore up their wealth and status in a post-slavery world. The West presented a fresh start for many.
Steve bows his head and pinches his nose. He sighs and then looks at Tony. “You know how that sounds, right? No. You have to go. They need to run tests.”
. How the hell could anyone think with that noise? Din and clatter at the same time with little defined sounds or words or anything! He flinched and closed his eyes even as they prickled with tears. The pain Steve suffered topped all of the noise, ached in Tony’s own gut. “How the hell do you handle all the noise?”
“Sorry, I didn’t mean-.” Steve says as he swallows down the sliced mango.
Tony never played many instruments as a child, just the requisite piano, but caressing Steve reminds him of how every small stroke, every gentle pulse causes a reaction, a melody. It’s the same with Steve. He shudders and writhes under Tony’s hands. The power of touch rings true when it comes to Steve – it very nearly undoes Tony.  His hands on Steve’s shoulders, he pushes away. The look of disappointment on Steve’s face mirrors his own, but if he learned anything through the years – slow and steady wins the race especially in matters of love. Or so he thought. He’d never actually won the race.
“Oh lovely,” Steve responded. “Go back to sleep, Sam.”
Steve started picking his way through broken metal and debris. Tony as Iron Man followed him. He scanned the wreckage for any clues who his new pack mates might be. JARVIS collected the data. Steve spent time helping the clearing crews and lifting heavy objects for them. Tony suspected he only did it because he thought waiting around might lead to Bucky showing up.
Tony stops him by grasping his hand. “Steve, you don’t need to know. We might never know.”
“Clint,” Steve said but even then Tony knew instinctively that Steve wasn’t revealing everything. Some other truth lie hidden in plain sight. “But Clint – I have to deal with Clint. I don’t even know how. I need to talk with Bruce.” The scattered thoughts rattled the link between them and it surprised Tony to see how off centered and a mess Captain America could be.
Contrary to what the media believes, Tony hasn’t had many partners. As a young man he played the field, but then the accident happened, and he severely cut off his sexual antics. He’s no blushing virgin to be sure, but his partners of late have been few. His last partner had been Pepper. It worked until it didn’t with her. They were on two different trajectories, and Pepper did have a tendency to mother hen Tony.
Bruce squinted at Steve. “Not dreamless?” His mutter startled Steve and he only shook his head.
“Yeah, I know.”
Bucky blinked rapidly and then pursed his lips. “Yeah. Me too.” He left Tony then, his demeanor diminished, and Tony couldn’t help but see how he attempted to remake himself even with only one arm. The man simply wanted to be small like Steve had been – non-threatening and hidden away from prying eyes. The heat of shame warmed Tony and he almost went after him but Strange called him back.
“Nice isn’t it?”
“You bastard Steve Rogers,” Tony replies but it has no heat to it. “I don’t regret it. I don’t regret having Morgan and finding that happiness.”
“What did you think was going on Tony? When you heard my thoughts? Did you even consider-.” It’s hard to believe that Tony dismissed such a vital piece of information. How could he? Why would he? What did he hear? “What did you hear?”
“Yes, my fair human. A zombie. This has been tried multiple times in the past and the world has been overrun with mindless undead. They may not look for blood, but they care not what they eat as long as it is fresh, and it is raw.” Thor studied his coven leader. “Why would they do this when they know the consequences, I don’t know.”
“Ms. Potts would like to talk.”
“And you were raised, to be a good Catholic boy?”
“Well, Dad says that now that you know about us, we can expect you to pop in at any time.” Her expression goes blank for a good thirty seconds and it’s freakishly unsettling, but then she smiles at them and hops off toward the fields.
Steve screws up his face. “Unstable what?”
Without further word they head back to the jail, Steve only looks behind him once to see the pinched worried face of Pepper. He slows and takes her arm, helping her along.
“I’m still not sure what you expect of me. You don’t want another lesson right now. So I am at a loss as to what I can do for you.” Strange steepled his fingers just like a classic clichéd villain. Maybe he was the villain of the story.
Just as he wished, the alpha fills him again and again, plugging him and forcing him to hold it and lay on the cold floor as the alpha eats or feeds him. The alpha makes him crawl and beg for any food. The alpha slaps him across the face when he fails at any task. He licks the alpha clean when asked and when the plug is finally removed, he sobs as the alpha doesn’t allow him to come.
“What the-?” He’s not even watching the movie. He’s staring at the little painting with its little trees and pond. This one even has a little lakehouse – like it’s trying to be part of the movie. Why does Pepper keep littering his house with all of these insanely Hobbit inspired pictures. It looks like she’s trying to establish the Shire or something in his penthouse.
“He can’t kill me in here.”
Every moment in the sun meant another piece of him destroyed. If his hands lost flesh fast enough, then he would be free, but that made no sense because the thing on the cross next to him was still bond. It opened its lipless mouth at him and a stick like tongue flailed. He gagged, and more blood burbled out. No matter how hard he tried his efforts were fruitless. The sun shined down and peeled away his flesh leaving the muscle exposed, but soon that burned. His nerves screamed as the agony set him in a haze of never-ending pain.
“No,” Steve said after he’d thought about it. “Not at all. Nothing really happened until he touched it.”
Steve stands up from the basket and goes to the side cabinet where he keeps a water pitcher and bowl for quick clean ups. He pours out the lukewarm water and notices that Tony picks up the garbage bin and brings it outside. When he returns the bin is pristine and doesn’t smell anymore.
“Tony,” she says and leans in to lightly brush her lips to his cheek. “How are you feeling? I’m so sorry I haven’t been by to check on you.” She squeezes his hand and, while others spouting those words would sound superficial at best, the warmth and tenderness in her tone shows that she’s anything but.
“I’m not so sure. People do amazing things every day.”
"Don't worry, get yourself ready to go," Steve yells back as the door explodes inward. Steve leaps at their assailants, kicking one and then shoving another in the face with his outstretched hands. He whips some of the discarded metal at another of the attackers like it's a discus or shield. Turning, he topples the man with a quick jab to the throat and then he sets on the horde streaming through the door. Picking up the abandoned assault rifle from one of his first victims, Steve nods to Tony and then fires the gun, screams, and sets on the terrorists. In seconds, he has them on the run, and he sprints after them, down the dank tunnel.
“Because we think you may be the first human Divini.” Natasha’s words hit him with a force reminiscent of his plane crashing all those years ago. They cracked through his reserve, his normal stoicism. They rammed right into his gut until he struggled to take the next breath. Someone’s hand was on him, on his back. Someone was telling him to breathe.
“Is it now?” Tony looks him up and down with a smirk. “You’ll always be Captain to me.” Though the tone isn’t unkind, it is far from fond. It lashes into Steve until he’s barely able to stand there while holding his tongue.
The omega licks his lips as if he wants to tell a lie, as if he could. The scent of his bonding gland warms the air and Tony nearly feels the struggle within the omega vibrate through the air.
He needs a moment to rectify his thoughts with reality. The idea of a professional just brings up old fashioned thoughts of prostitution. Clearing his head would help. “Can I get a moment?”
“Protective,” Steve says. “It’s not a problem. I understand.” While it might freak Steve out a little when he finds little notes in his laundry concerning his care and treatment of Tony, he can understand the loyalty his friends and family have for him. Steve finds Tony fascinating.
“Yes,” Steve says through clenched teeth. He tucks the pad away after entering the name, and clasps Stane’s hand with a quick shake. “Your father and I did have some interaction.”
It rankles Tony but he appreciates the omega’s boldness – it will serve him well during the Council meeting. He could beat him, punish him now, but he needs to learn a little more about the omega before he considers what to do next. He assesses the omega, who still has the data streaming before them. So blatant. Considering his actions, the omega
“Keep in position. Don’t come.”
“You don’t get to do that,” Tony said again as he got to his feet as well. Natasha followed him. “You stay with us. We’re your family now. We’re your pack.”
“How? How do you know it works like that?” Steve asked as he spun on his heel under the hologram.
As he flicked through the pages, Tony fell into a chair and cross referenced the experiments, the investigation with other volumes of his dad’s work. It seemed nonsensical and repetitive. Human perfection – Howard had scrawled that word over and again in the diaries. Did Howard actually think that vampires were the perfection of humans? That couldn’t be right, but then Tony found references to the serum.
That couldn’t be right, but Steve left the phone on his lap as he weighed what had happened. It might have been a fluke. It could go away. He knew he was only fooling himself. The truth was he could feel the new vibrations from both Bucky and Tony. While Bucky’s sounded like one of those electric guitars being tuned, Tony’s – Tony’s glided along in a whisper and soared like a bird on wings. He enjoyed the feel of it, the tenderness but also the power.
“You know I’m right.” Tony keeps his hand on Steve’s shoulder, inching it up to the nape of his neck. “Don’t do this to yourself. We’re going to make it right. We can now that we have you.”
“No, but people see you as the ultimate omega warrior. You’re not supposed to falter. You’re not supposed to fail.” Natasha grimaces as if she’s remembering something from her own past. “Sometimes it’s okay to fail.”
“That artists aren’t valued in a war machine economy. You ever think that one of the reasons the incursions keep happening and peace can’t be brokered is because the economy relies on war to stay afloat. At least for the Inner Systems?” Steve asks. It never occurred to him before as he stands there and stares at the mirage of water. Even a spray of fine water droplets hits his face.
“Hmm, better than okay. Haven’t felt this good in years.”
“The honor is mine, sir,” Steve said. He remained calm. No need to show his anxiety and worry to these men. They were shrewd, and Steve needed to know exactly where Pierce stood.
“There you go. Let’s see those blue blue eyes again. You know you need to stay awake this time. Last time you were awake for a whole 37 seconds. Got everyone excited.”
Steve wants to answer but silences his reply. He waits for at least another half hour before he’s sure that Tony’s breathing has evened out and slowed. He calls Tony’s name a few times just to be sure, and then he slips off the bed and hits the enter key. He only hesitates a second before he does it. He can’t not do it. But the fear is real. What if something happens? They’re on an isolated island far from any medical help. He needs to believe in Tony and not his fears born out of years of his sickness or his mother’s. The computer softly beeps when he hits the start. He watches the screen for a minute, but there’s nothing really to see, just the progress. Tony keyed in all the steps. Steve has nothing to do but wait. He has at least another hour before he can sleep as well.
“Shit. Steve, no. Don’t do that to yourself.” Tony thinks. “Well how about Star Wars. A New Hope. That’s fun.”
“No one is going to control me,” Steve said. No one could ever control Steve, not Bucky, not Peggy, and especially not the US Army. SHIELD was nothing in comparison. “I’m going. I need the job.”
When he does open his eyes the lion is sitting up, his blue eyes showing a depth of wisdom and pain that Tony cannot parse. “Listen, you make it through this, you’ll come with us. Just don’t eat us.”
“Hey, you want to make breakfast anytime I have no problem,” Steve said. “As I recall you’re pretty good at that.”
The clock ticks. The others are around him, waiting as well. He both wants them here and wants them gone. He should have insisted that Sam go with Steve. The new quantum realm/time machine platform had been constructed in short order, too short. They cut corners. It barely pulled enough juice to power the converters. Wherever or whenever Steve appeared on the other end, he could have been injured, harmed, or worse. Killed.
“How many are true competitors and how many are agitators?” Steven asks as they descended the curved staircase.
“Sir? Is there something I might help you with?”
Steve shouldn’t tell anyone, he should keep it to himself. But he needs help and Tony risked everything to save him. “It’s when the worlds break down.”
“I have a situation, I can’t explain over the phone. Is it possible for you to come to Colorado?” Tony asked. He pleaded with gods he didn’t believe it to allow him this small grace.
“Passes? Passes what? A mile marker? What?” Tony snapped. “Because if you’re saying he dies, that is not going to happen. Steve Rogers does not give up. He never gives up.”
Steve clears his throat and asks, “So why the name?”
“Yes,” Tony says, and the Boundaries in the distance vibrate with his sin.
Steve put his hands in his back jeans’ pockets. He stepped backward toward the windows as if he might leap to freedom. “Tony, I don’t have a choice in these matters. Well, not all the time. Sometimes they just happen.”
“See this, I got this in my chest because I used to be a dick.” He stops. “No not really. I trusted someone who was a dick, someone who led me down the path of denigration. So now I have to live with this thing in my chest so I don’t fucking die.” He places his thumb on the arc reactor switch and then twists. There’s a special motion he needs to do to free it from its chest port. He designed that after the whole Stane fiasco. “Here we go.” It pops out.
“Thank you, Captain.”
Tony tilts his head. “Of course. But these would disintegrate with the introduction of semen or would eventually disintegrate throughout the day if not introduced to semen. They would just wash out. Don’t worry about incontinence because the stretch is completely controlled. Seems a lot more convenient than this archaic thing.” He tosses it to Steve. “Tell me if you’re interested. It’s a simple applicator.”
“Is Steve in town? We’d be happy to have him over for dinner,” Pepper said. Her act cracked in front of Tony; he assumed that Natasha could read it easily enough. Pepper wanted his old life out of their life, out of his mind. She hated Iron Man, but not maliciously. He knew that he understood that, but the yearning still plagued him.
“The bond,” Tony said and bowed his head. He had wanted it. Then he could only freeze in terror of it, and now he mourned it. What the hell did he want? He didn’t know, he couldn’t tease apart his fears from his excitement. “It’s not strong. He wasn’t strong enough at the time.”
“That’s because you’ve consumed about a dozen cups of coffee, two Mountain Dews, and I think too many 5 hour energy drinks that might just cause your heart to explode.” Steve yawns. “Can I go and get a shower, at least?”
Steve nods and pushes the papers around while he keeps one arm clasped around his belly.  He doesn’t complain as he works on the armor pieces. He picks up the tools and slowly begins to assemble the armor – as much as he can without Tony in place in the armor.
“I’m not in any danger,” he said, though he never denied what she inferred.
Bruce glared at Tony but then stepped to the side of Clint’s bed. “Are you ready?”
“So it must have something to do with the soul pack,” Steve said. “It must be his first lesson.”
Well, these days you have to know both styles. Hand drawn and digital. I worked for an independent comic book company until they went out of business. But I do freelance a bit.”
Between the seconds that Lgoan speaks and the breath Steve takes, he lives an entire life. He recalls the other life, the one where he left Logan because he couldn’t sit on the sidelines. He had to go back to New York, to the world, and do his duty again. He remembers the terror of the invasion, how they thought they could hold it back, but not even the full strength of the world’s armed forces could stop the Ornari. He recalls the harried exodus as they escaped the city, as they rounded up as many civilians as possible to get away from the growing terror. Most of all, he remembers Tony. He doesn’t want to lose this; he never wants to lose the memories. It’s a life he may never live, but it’s one he doesn’t want to surrender.
Captain.”
Steve got up from his seat to intervene but Tony laughed at Strange. “I heard you were a famous surgeon and now you go around in a cape and act as if you’re some hocus pocus wizard. Hogwarts and Harry Potter land is down in Orlando.”
“What?” Tony challenges him. “What have you seen?” He expects the inevitable from sighted person.
“War games!” Thor said and picked up his glass as if to throw it, but Sam caught his arm and shook his head. “Oh yes. No throwing in front of the little ones.”
Steve falls silent as Tony grabs another of the containers in the picnic basket. He opens it to find brownies. Happy knows him too well. He plucks one out and bites into it. Steve huffs at him.
As he races down the narrowing hall, the troopers scream for him to stop. They run after him and Bucky’s able with the blaster still clutched in his hand, to twist around and squeeze off a few blasts, but they aren’t aimed and they hit the vulnerable stone walls. Rocks and pebbles fly and scatter over them. The fortress trembles against the attack. Another barrage of bolts strikes close to Bucky’s head but he’s able to duck and turn to run again. He knows he can’t keep this up for too long.
Tony decides it’s best not to tease him too much. He eats but then notices something is missing. “Where’s the coffee?”
Tony stands under the willow tree as Steve lays out a blanket. He spins on his heel and stares at Happy in the distance who is just driving away. His life is driving away from him, it has been since that fateful day in December when his father drove them home from an early Christmas Party. Sometimes, in the dead of night, Tony still hears his mother’s failing voice calling for his father. Howard had refused to wear his seatbelt – of course- and had suffered the consequences. He’d been thrown from the car, died instantly. Mom – well, it took time for her to fade away. Tony swears and blinks a few times. Memories aren’t like vision. Vision is a momentary thing, a thing that can be cut off. Memories stay.
One of the doctors catches Steve's arm and says, "We were trying to help you, remember that."
Steve clears his throat and bows. “Sorry, my prince. I’m Steve from the Widow’s Brothel.”
Tony’s seen Steve – knows he’s well endowed, thick and lengthy. Tony throws his head back as he must imagine Steve penetrating him, thrusting.
“Prove it, what mistake did you make?” Tony whispered as the night slipped away.
Heimdall huffs at her, sticking the point of his sword in the ground. He lays his hands on the pummel. “I am not sure I should. I am not supposed to interfere.”
Tony blinks away tears. “We’ll have another chance. Don’t worry. We will.”
Steve peers up at Bucky, the smirk on his face revealing so much more, and then he decides to play along for a bit. Over the years, Steve’s learned that when Bucky wants something, something that he knows Steve would disapprove of, he plays a game of bait and switch.
Every night, when they all leave, Steve sneaks back into Tony’s room. He nods to the nurse and sits down. He holds Tony’s hand, rubs his thumb along the palm and talks to Tony. He tells him about how poor he was before he took the job as his personal assistant. He elaborates on his next big comic book idea – about a skinny weasel of a guy with a heart of gold who gets vitarays and a super secret serum to make him strong and big and he fights in WWII.
He jerks and rubs a little at his eyes. It will never do to have Captain America see Tony Stark – Iron Man – moping. “Yeah? What are you doing in my neck of the woods?” He climbs to his feet. He waves away the schematics, but the machine still vibrates with energy. He’s nearly done with it. He only needs one more finally piece.
“Maybe,” Tony said and doubted very much he would ever have a child. A family wasn’t really in the cards for someone like him. He knew that even at his very young age.
“Okay, then why does he need a fake date? Can’t he get someone on his own?” Sam interjects.
“I didn’t ask how much sleep you need, I asked if you got any lately,” Natasha says and peers around him. “Where’s Buck? I thought he’d be trailing around you like a puppy.”
“I don’t know who they are. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do,” Steve said. He shuffled over to the window staring out at a landscape that looked not like the remains of the New York battle, but an apocalyptic war. Dust and ash blew down the street. “I can’t fix this if I can’t fix us.” The vehemence in his voice was betrayed by the honest horror in his expression, the fear mingling in his eyes.
“So, he’s stuck?” Sam says and grimaces.
At home he brewed himself some coffee and settled into his living room, which he would have called a  parlor in his day, with the bundle of papers on his lap. He needed to learn what to expect with this soul pack. He put the mug on the table and fished through the papers, organizing them into different topics.
“Who did you dream of as a child, Tony? Who did you hope the universe would send to you to save you?” Blu asks, his voice a low purr that comforts.
Sam huffs into the receiver. “He’s rolling his eyes so much I think he can see his brain matter.”
Tony glances at Steve for confirmation before he nods. “Yes. I can feel every breath he takes.”
Tony had no idea what the hell Bruce was talking about but he said, “Okay?” The way the bond felt – tenuous, fragile, but also precious and welcoming – caused Tony to quake inside with hope and with horror. “It’s not going to break, is it?”
“So?” Tony asked.
“How does stew and fresh bread sound for dinner?”
“I was married, had kids.” Clint fell silent and then sighed. “Shit. I haven’t talked about Laura and the kids in years.”
He knows what happens when he doesn’t come clean.
Closing his eyes, Steve wipes away the horrific images, the sounds, the smells of the surgery invading his brain. It isn’t real. It’s meant to terrify him so that he cannot fight. Steve calms and allows the peace of his self-awareness grow.
“Toward the light, sir.”
“Fell right down during one of the shows in Buffalo. The handler, my handler said it was part of the act. It wasn’t - my blood sugar must have been low or something.” He digs into his food again.
“You read that crap? Come on now, that’s as bad as reading Popular Mechanics,” Tony admonishes
Tony remains undeterred. “Oh I think you do, good Captain.”
“You didn’t finish?” Tony concluded. They walked the long block in the dark. The street lamps were insufficient to guide their way.
“Look at you,” Tony says in a low voice. He can barely make out Steve’s features in the glowing light of the lamp post. “You won’t let anyone save you.”
“I think that’s call sexual harassment, sir,” Steve remarks but then leans over and plucks Tony’s glasses off his face.
Tony leads him through the station as if he’s lived here all his life. Natasha knew the prince so it’s no surprise that Tony knows the station well. They weave through the early morning traffic as throngs of people move through the station’s concourse, corridors, and gantries. Most of the station feels more like a building while some of the areas try to mimic the outdoors of the planet Earth. A projected overhead sky with trees and trellises of vines with flowers hanging heavy off the wrought iron gateways decorate the passageways as they head toward the park.
He screamed out a cry and came awake. Panting Steve shuddered and picked up his hand to touch his cheek. All he felt was the warmth of his tears. Tony shuffled awake next to him. He rubbed at his eyes.
Tony follows orders this one time. He thrusts forward and all the muscles in his pelvis tense with pleasure. He hisses and holds back. He doesn’t want to be like a teenage and come within seconds. He wants this to be about Steve and about him – together.  He grinds forward and then until he’s buried to the hilt. Steve jerks and exposes his neck, every vein and tendon popping.
And Tony does.
“Tony,” Steve says and a certain low grade hysteria rises in his chest and he squeezes his hands into balls. It can’t be. Tony did not find out about Bucky. T’Challa wouldn’t have betrayed him – but if Ross and crew threatened him, or the whole of Wakanda, what would T’Challa do? He’s a king, a ruler charged with the protection of all of his people, not just a stranger. “Tony, please.”
Tony defies orders and walks into the Compound. “We’ll die.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about Rogers.”
Decided, Steve says, “JARVIS?”
“Tony? Steve Rogers is here to see you about the offer,” Pepper says. She steps out of the way and allows Steve to enter before she closes the door. Standing behind Steve, Pepper gestures to Tony. He’s never been good with reading ambiguous sign language, especially now.
Pierce said, “Lower the gurney and release it.”
He rubbed at his face and whispered, “Get yourself together.”
Without breaking his stoic expression, Steve replies, “Oh I’m not trying to land him, I’m just using him for sex.” He escapes and doesn’t look back at their faces. He sidles back to the viewing window and peers over the edge.
She leads him out of the bath and has him lay on the tiled floor on top of a plush towel. Everything is so extraordinarily luxurious he could just fall asleep.
Steve only glares at him.
“I’m not even sure what this is. I don’t know how to pick anyone? Strange said it would just come to me,” Steve replied and his wrist hurt again, as if just being in their presence caused something to flicker and burn. He pulled the cuff of his sleeve up again and Bruce bent over his arm.
“You bastard!” Tony screamed.
“No,” Steve interrupts the silent communication. “I can do it. I just wanted to make sure that wasn’t an issue. I’m not in need of a lawyer or anything.” He picks up the pen again and signs the form. Pepper offers him the tablet and he does the same on the tablet document after checking to ensure it’s the same one. It’s both insulting and reassuring that he’s so exacting.
“It’s my responsibility, even as an angel I have free will,” Steve says and places his hands over Tony’s as he leans into the kiss. And they do kiss, it is not light or tentative but fierce and rebellious.  Steve shifts his hands to grasps Tony, pull him closer, allow him to feel Tony’s body against his, his flesh vulnerable and open to Tony. It isn’t only the passion in the kiss, but the willingness, he tries to show. That he would give up everything for Tony, that he would walk through the gates of hell.
“God,” Tony says and hangs his head. Suddenly, everything feels heavy, his head, his eyes. He pushes the heels of his hands into his eyes. “I’m not sure what’s happening Bruce. But this thing, this seizure thing has changed something for me.”
“I shouldn’t have.” He moves to get away but Tony grapples with him, keeping him in place.
“That, my dearheart, is your prostate.” Tony smiles and then slams into that spot again sending Steve into a crazed sob of pleasure. “It’s delightful, isn’t it. That deep spot, inside you, waiting to be touched, wanting to be touched. It’s a little bit of decadence, a little secret you can keep. When we’re in a meeting.” Tony leans down, whispering over Steve. “When we’re in a meeting and I tap on the table, you can imagine that special spot that I’m hitting.” He shoves forward again eliciting a howl from Steve. “It’s a secret between you and me. You know I can touch it, I can fuck you and this reaction is ours. It’s our alone.”
“They were probably Hydra anyhow,” Steve said. He stood by Clint’s bed and put his hand on Clint shoulder. The man vibrated with energy. His whole body pitched and shivered under Steve’s touch. His soul echoed his body’s shuddering. “This is my fault, Clint. We’re going to fix this now.” The confidence in his voice belayed the true fear thrumming through him. Clint had been through so much after Loki. His mind had been violated and he spent hours upon hours in counseling and not trusting himself. On top of that the idea the Hydra had been in charge of his recovery had spooked Clint enough that the normally reticent archer confided that fact to Steve. The guilt about what happened when he had been under the influence of the staff ate at Clint. Steve might not know Clint all that well, but he understood the kind of man he was. Offering Clint a way to redemption during the Battle of New York had been the right thing to do, but now Steve doubted his actions. Asking Clint to join the pack when the archer had subtly showed signs of doubt may have caused even worse damage to the nascent bond.
“I am sorry. Pepper and I – well, we’ve been handling the situation for so long that we’ve actually stopped handling it and started to handle Tony. We started to treat him as if he couldn’t make his own decisions, as if he doesn’t understand. And that’s wrong. All of it is wrong.”
“They won’t let you take me.”
“I’m sure you did,” Tony says as he tapes his ribs and cleans the cuts. But his mind circles around the word
Tony grasps Steve to his chest, holding him tight. In days gone by Steve would have struggled away from a demon’s touch. He would have fought with all the strength of the righteousness imparted in him by the Soul Keeper’s binding. Yet now, as he feels something familiar and comforting about Tony, Steve allows himself to be held. It steadies him, gives him strength to combat the internal battle and break away from the viper snaking its way into the confines of his soul. He shudders and a moan escapes him, but he sags into Tony’s embrace, safe.
The soup is delicious and filling with the fresh bread. Steve devours it much to Tony amusement. How he knows, Steve’s not sure but he adds a slice of his own bread to Steve’s tray. He gobbles it up before he even thinks to thank him for it. “Oh yeah,” he’s chewing as he says it. “Thanks for the bread. For everything I mean. I’m starved.”
“Then what is stopping you?” Tony slinked back down to place another bruising bite to his shoulder.
“Thank you,” he smiled. “I’ll return the favor if we survive tomorrow,” he joked. Tony didn’t respond and he immediately felt guilty as he rolled onto his side. “I’m sorry, that was a really bad quip,” he admitted.
“I heard that!” Steve yells from his room.
Tony shrugged, his hands in his pockets. “Better now. You should talk to him, though. Nat explained some stuff to him. So did Clint. Thor seems kind of – scared, frightened? Those words seem wrong for a demigod. But he seems a little taken aback being assigned Guide.”
Bruce jumps in – clearly anxious to get answers. “Do you think we can isolate the singularity?”
It surprised Tony then when they moved the gurney out of the laboratories. Ross headed the procession. Six agents, two clinical researchers, and the undead corpse on the gurney with a phantom trailing behind. It all seemed so ridiculous that Tony wanted to laugh, but he knew if he did he would only cry so he followed (but had no other choice) and they ended up in the lowest bowels of the Triskelion. The prison level.
“Sandwiches!” Tony laughed.
Steve.
“The workroom is for equipment fabrications and cleaning. Prince Anthony has informed me that you are to be allowed anything you need for your comfort and ease.”
“Are you coming into heat?”
He didn’t let Bruce dissuade him; he never gave him enough time. The rest of his run from the hospital blurred by him as if he’d suddenly flashed through the world in hyperdrive. He ended up in the suit, rocketing toward New York. He’d nearly made it fifty miles before his brain kicked in and asked him what the hell he was doing. He stopped in mid-air, hovering over the web of highways linking Washington DC with Baltimore and points north.
“Text to Pepper: hey Pep can you find Steve for me and send him my way?” He thinks about it. “Friday also – text to Steve: Steve, can you drop by the clinic we have some things to sort out.”
“You fucking let them beat you, didn’t you? This isn’t a game, hero boy.” Tony knows what those soldiers like, what Raza’s men enjoy. A beating, some torture. It’s what those on the edge of life will do to others to get what they want. He’s beginning to understand the terror of war – not only the business of it.
Steve only shakes his head. “Doesn’t matter, I don’t think it matters anymore. I would lay down my life for you-.”
Steve visits the bathroom and then returns, plucks his phone from its hiding place, and flips open his sketchpad. He thinks about sharing the sketches with Tony. The ones of his hands, his lips, his eyes. It thrills him and terrifies him at the same time. Imagining Tony seeing himself the way that Steve visualizes him throws light into the darkness, like water across a lake at night. It ripples through Steve with some kind of hope but also the dread of the darkness. Before he can pick up his pencil again, Tony stirs and mumbles.
“Sorry, sorry. Those are private-.”
“Break her heart to know you moved on and fell in love,” Tony whispered as he kissed and enticed.
“G-got it done then?”
Rumlow snickers and then drags Steve by his collar through the narrow passageway to a smaller room that looks like it’s probably one of the storage rooms for the station. Most of the times these are locked down, but since it looks like it’s part of the working kitchen for the lounge where the luncheon is being hosted, it’s open.
"What? No, not at all," Steve says and furrows his brows. "I'm fine, or will be. Just get in the suit."
“You want me bleeding and torn, fine, but then you deal with the consequences when it comes out you assaulted a member of the Escort Guild.” Steve waits and Rumlow processes. It takes too long and Steve rolls his eyes. “Are you ready or not. Because this is getting tedious.”
Steve practically glares the reporter back into her chair. “Ma’am, that’s my husband you’re talking about. I’d appreciate it if you remembered your manners.”  The crowd gawks and then the reporter withers back into her chair.
Tony jerked, startled at the voice. “Clint?” He squinted as Clint walked to the side of the cell. The pitiful recessed lights barely illuminated anything in the small cell. “What the hell? Get me out of here. They have Steve.”
He needs antibiotics, something to clean out the wound. At the very least an antiseptic lotion or something. As Tony rests, he goes to the workbench and pages through the papers. There are drawing and partial pieces of ideas, but he’s not sure what it’s supposed to be, or even if Tony was cognizant when he drew them. Then he looks at the cylinder on the bench. Picking it up he holds it in his palm and realizes it is the same dimensions as the hole in Tony’s chest.
“No, thank you, sir. If there isn’t anything else, I’ll be going to bed.”
Steve leads Tony into the mud room and then they enter the main kitchen. Tony knows the place like the back of his hand, he designed it. When he first purchased the land, he had one of the best architects in the business work with him on the plans. The main floor invites the occupants and visitors with its open spaces and high ceilings. Tony kept to a clean line design with modern features but also brought in the rustic feel of the Canadian wilderness, adding exposed beams and a natural stone fireplace that reaches up to the second floor. On the second floor with its open staircase and landing to the first floor, there are five bedrooms and five full baths. Each room has its own ensuite. The basement floor or really the ground floor from the street in front of the house has Tony’s workshop and a three car garage.
Steve dropped the scrubber and hung his head. He waited a moment and through their link, Tony sensed that Steve worked at stilling his temper. In and of itself, that surprised Tony.
The seven leap at Steven as if on cue.  It is brutal and shocking. Steven flips one over his shoulder into one behind him as if he has eyes in the back of his head. The sound of bones cracked and crushed echoes in the room against the heavy panting of men in battle. Steven doesn’t stop. He immediately gathers up the stunned man and smashes him into the next attacker. It works, but it also throws Steven off balance. He stumbles and one of Estane’s omegas gets the upper hand and punches Steven in the groin. He muffles a cry as he hunches down on his knees. One of them laughs at Steven and goes to smack a boot in his face, but Steven catches the boot and jerks the leg, pulling it out of the socket and fracturing the bone at the same time.
“Even back in your day Captain, they appeared. Surely you understand that as there were bands of brothers during the war,” Doctor Strange said as his stare bore into Steve. “Though no one really understood it that way, nor did it mark as overtly as it does now. It’s hypothesized that some of the magic leaking into the world may have linked these friends, these troops, together into a pack through their interdimensional energies.”
Because he’s always slipping out and telling Happy to meet him hours later. He should be more serious about his own safety. Maybe he should call Pepper if he's not going to confess his downright ridiculous intention to Rhodey. Oh, and what should he say there? Dearest Pepper send police to this location as of nine this evening because someone needs to retrieve my cold dead body. He shakes off the anxiety and pretends he's okay with the idea of dying for some sex worker.
The rest of the ward, Steve’s mother and her death bed dissipated into the darkness. Steve shoved hands into his faded brown trousers. They looked like they were two sizes too big. His shoes had holes in them, the toes of the leather split open. “This is who I am Tony. I don’t know if you realize it, but I spent the vast majority of my life like this.”
When he was thawed from the ice, no one knew he was a sub/omega. Not even SHIELD. When he went to Fury and asked for an alpha it had been a miracle the man’s working eye didn’t pop out of his head at the time. Natasha came to the rescue. She was the one who found Tony for him. He can still recall, the moment that Tony walked into his small room at SHIELD NY office. There he was, arrogant, cool. And Steve wanted to run, but his body told him something different. His body bent to the will of an alpha. Not only an alpha but a dom to Steve’s sub, and on top of that a Prime. Prime Alpha’s were rare – most went mad. Tony was a Prime, and he had it under control.
“Damn if there isn’t. I can do something. I can get the Fleet-.”
Steve chuckled but it wasn't one of his alluring laughs. This one sounded harsh, used, even pained.
“JARVIS, Steve is not allowed in the workshop. EVER.”
Tony winks. “No, I think I’d like the back room.”
Arrows whiz by and flames spark from the Red Knight’s palms. The dark beasts around him crow and growl at the Silver Knight. Almost upon him, the arrows dart like a hailstorm. He’s very nearly to the gap. But he won’t make it – he knows that now. He will not accept this cursed fate. His beast seems to read his mind and rears up, knocking him from his saddle. He grasps to hold on, but the beast is too wicked to stay. It escapes with its bearish teeth in a snarl.
Tony slips them out of his pocket and holds them up.
“Wha-what?” How could she have heard that? “No, Pepper, that’s not what happened. I’m pissed at him. He’s a pain in the ass.”
"Just watch him. Ye have little faith."
“Okay, Stevie, I’m gonna blast off the rest of the chains. I can’t take this damned thing off your head, but right now let’s just get out of here.” With a quick gesture, Bucky tells Redwing to get out of the way. He lights on top of Steve’s shoulder and waits. Bucky fires quickly and repeatedly to break all of the rest of the bindings, shooting at the ankle chains and the chains that kept his body linked to the wall. It’s then that Bucky figures out that even the bucket to relieve himself was out of reach. Steve must have had to rely on Red Skull and his troopers for everything. It curdles in Bucky’s belly.
He had no right.
The fact that Tony asked that brought to the fore the fear they both shared. Steve cupped Tony’s face with his hands, purposefully staring into those faceted eyes that seemed to shimmer with gold flecked crimson. “I see the man that I love.” It was true. All of it. The horror drilled straight through to the marrow of his bones, the terror struck there, but also the lasting, enduring love for Tony. A love that healed him once and would again. Not everything would be easy, but their love presented a new day, a new hope for them to survive the torment and agony they suffered.
“That’s my boy. None of that baby crap with that stuffed animal you insist on dragging around. This is my boy. You’ll figure it out. I’m sure. Maybe someday you’ll even figure out how to miniaturize the arc reactor!” Howard smiled. Even with the sharp jab, Tony beamed at Howard’s words. It was so rare to receive a compliment from his father.  Howard cupped his hand around Tony’s shoulder. “Maybe next time I go to the Arctic Ocean to search for Cap’s plane you can come with me. Just the two of us. Father and son.”
“Stark?” It fell into place then, the horrible truth. Steve shuffled in the bed and Sam groused at him to stay still. “Tony Stark?” Steve hitched in a breath and his lungs tightened on him. The monitor beeped in protest. It couldn’t be right. The first time he’d tried with Tony, the soul bond fell apart. It unraveled. No. No. No. Maybe his anxiety came from the two new members, or the pain spreading out from his wounds, not the deeply seeded fear he’d managed to hold at bay all of these years.
She smiles and shakes her head. “No, Samantha will be your personal assistant throughout your stay at the Alpha Omega Retreat.”
“You’re the only one I ever intentionally bonded to.” Steve played with the cup on the table. The condensation made little droplets down the side of the cup. “It’s not supposed to work that way, but it did. I’m glad.” He looked up at Sam. “I’m glad and it would -.” He stopped. Speaking his emotions would always be difficult for Steve. “It would tear me apart if something I did or said changed that.”
“What’s up, Cap?” Scott has endlessly teased Steve because Captain Wilson has exclusively contracted with him ever since his first time.
His brain jumbles the events of the last few days. It seemed that they’d spent a good amount of time ambling, strolling along with the project but then everything sped up as if they were suddenly in a race. Steve doesn’t like the feel of it. It’s too rushed. For him, in the army, he needed everything double and triple checked. He doesn’t doubt the Tony worked his controls, checked his math, verified the results of his tests, but it all fell together too fast at the end. Maybe that is how science works. Steve doesn’t know, he’s not a scientist. Tony is. All the wonders that Tony will be able to-.
Tony bows his head and moves away, dropping back onto the bed. “I appreciate the sentiment, Steve. I really do. I think your earnest about it. But this isn’t a walk in the park. It’s not going to be fun. Pepper and Rhodey are going into full protection mode as we speak. Just getting them to calm down and listen to me is going to take a damned army.”
Steve takes the box with trembling hands. Tony ignores how much his hands shake as he opens the box. It’s what he feared. A bonding collar. Steve has others – or had – from Tony. But this one, this one is gorgeous. Tony spared no expense. The center jewel setting looks exactly like the arc reactor once embedded in Tony’s chest. It’s a sapphire. The Asscher cut black onyx gems line the collar made of vibranium. Steve knows that metal with his eyes closed.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says. “But you drew her, do you draw her often? People you know often?”
Snorting, Tony falls back and Steve guides him to lie down. “Are you okay?”
“No, he’s an ass and his technology pushes the hyper-scape system too far. He’ll end up exploding half of the ships under his designs,” Tony says.
“I don’t think so?” Steve said. He twisted his mouth as he contemplated, and then said, “How about we try this? You could try and send a signal to me.” Steve went to the fire again and sat down on the rug. He must look ridiculous, big and clumsy as he tried to exude calm.
"I've never seen anything like it before," Natasha agrees as she pours more alcohol along the bloody gash. Bucky jerks in response.
“Not like this,” Steve said and sat back, away from Sam. “Not even close to this. It’s real or it feels very real.  I think it might have something to do with the soul bond.”
It had been good to talk to Sam. The adoration Sam had for him diminished and their friendship grounded in reality. If anything, the universe had gotten it right when Sam had been designated as Companion. While Steve could confide in both Natasha and Sam, there was an ease with Sam that brought about a good feeling, a sense of camaraderie. When Steve went to bed that night, he felt as if tomorrow and the meeting with Wong would prove fruitful, if only Tony would open his ears to listen.
“Wrap is in the middle of your plate.”
Steve snapped out of it. Putting the phone on the tray table, he closed his eyes. One thing at a time. He needed to think things through, and he needed to talk to Tony.
“No, I’m not. This kind of thing I live and breathe. Let me tell you there’s no one else that can put on a show like me,” Tony says.
The arc reactor in the armor brightens enough to illuminate the whole of the den, the prison that Steve has been most obviously tortured in for months while Tony begged someone to believe him. What he sees as the soft blue light lands on the figure before him, takes his breath away. Tony’s muscles, his lungs, his brain, his body forgets how to breathe, because what is before him is impossible.
“Sir, according to all of the historical knowledge, interviews with known associates, and his one true love, Agent Margaret Carter, Captain Rogers never dated or saw any women on the side.”
“You don’t sound like a confidant,” Steve said. Again, he shot one from the hip.
“Well, first it might be nice if you started by calling him Tony,” Sam said as he folded his hands in his lap. “Second, gotta give him time. He has to come to realize that Bucky is not defined by some image. He’s a separate individual and should be accepted on his own merits.”
“Yes. My transcripts are right in the second pocket of the portfolio.” He reaches to the binder and tugs at the paper for Tony. “I also have a thumb drive-.”
He hated Howard then, but he clung to hope. Now, as he looks at the lion chained in the corner, all hope withers away. Tony shivers because even in the desert it’s cold, especially in a prison. His doctor, Yinsen, who saved his life is puttering around in what Tony can only call a makeshift kitchen. He’s boiling something their captors gave him. That’s the order of the day. Boiled whatever. Maybe it’s boiled shoe leather. He remembers that sometimes during the Great Depression people were desperate for food. Were they that desperate? He’s not desperate. He has no appetite.
Clint salutes them and says, “Have it your way.”
“Pepper?” he asks just as the door to the inner suite opens and Tony walks out. He’s freshly showed and only wears a towel slung low at his waist while he carries another to dry his hair.
Tony only laughs in reply.
“So did I,” Steve said. He hadn’t even hesitated when he stated it. “I liked what we’ve done so far, too.” He tacked that on as if to reassure Tony. A kiss – that’s all they shared. Two kisses. But to Steve it meant something so Tony needed to be satisfied. A silence dropped over them, as they stood standing side to side, hip to hip in the common kitchen. Tony discovered a kind of ache emanating from Steve. Fear tangled up with yearning.
The next few moments are untamed as if Tony’s been starved for this all his life. A connection, a person willing to see him. He fucks into Steve and the heaviness, the thickness of Tony’s cock inside Steve sends him into a weeping mess. He’s crying as he comes, the wildness settles, and the orgasms takes him. It’s a wonder to behold. The stretch of Tony’s cock, the pulsations thrill him and set Steve on fire so that he almost believes he might come again. He watches the prince though, watches Tony’s blissed out expression, the loss of the tension lines that Steve hadn’t even known were there, the relaxation of his shoulders as he comes and comes. His body seems overtaken by the need to spend itself. As the prince comes, his body wrestles and rebels against him forcing him to allow it this pleasure, this long awaited feast. Tony throws his head back and groans out a guttural cry. For a long moment, Steve wishes they had barebacked so that he could feel the heat of the prince’s come inside his body, but that’s not allowed so he quickly wipes the thought away. Tony quakes and then quiets abruptly.
He recognizes Tony -
Maybe, just maybe when Strange told them to follow him through the golden portal again, a tiny wisp of regret hit Steve. While Strange spoke of their progress and the rest of the day included multiple trials and lessons with the rest of the pack, Steve longed for the cabin again. A do over – they called it these days. He missed his chance. He’d given Tony the wrong impression. For once in his life, the door to romance and something more opened, and Steve closed it.
Steve leads Tony closer to him; they’re nearly touching now. “It’ll be useful in combat.”
It takes a moment before he answers. “Yeah. I’m good. I’m ready to get this done.”
“Yep. I have a few loyal people around me who help. You’re in that select few now, Steve. Can you handle it?” Tony wants to move this along. He’s tired and he still needs to get Steve to understand how to walk with him, how to steer him through crowds. How to be his eyes.
“Everyone else needs training. Not everything can be dumbed down for you, Obie,” Tony spits back and Steve clamps a hand over his mouth not to laugh at Stane’s aghast expression.
He rubs at his eyes. It’s one of his go to mental knots – thinking he’s not worth it. It might be the reason he always went to the extremes. Maybe also part of the reason he agreed on Project Rebirth in the first place. His life detoured from reality a long time ago. When he walked down that long hallway with Peggy towering over him. Yet did he ever think he would have to chance or the ability to shed the fake façade and find someone he desired.
“Inside the thing-.” Steve says and sees Tony shake violently against the cold. They are both going to die of exposure if Steve doesn’t get his act together. He checks out the device, sees a small metal panel on the front. He twists the tiny knob and the metal door opens to reveal the inner housing. It looks like the inside of a clock, except it’s sputtering and popping instead of ticking away. He has no idea what it does. All he knows is that it keeps Tony’s heart functioning and Tony alive.
The SUVs surrounded them. There was nowhere to go. He couldn’t leave Tony. The V-Corps agents got out of the vehicles, weapons at the ready. “Out of the car. Now!”
“Love you.”
“Yeah, it’s fine.” Steve’s breath warms the space between them.
“Believe me, I understand that,” Tony replied. It had been the third night in a row of endless jostling for position. Even the dinner they were attending was awash in intrigue and subterfuge.
“That’s rich, son, that’s really rich. I’d throw you out on your ass right now, but you just fixed old Betsy and I’m worn tired and old from all the intrigue in my life,” she says and she gets up to walk over to the air conditioner. She turns up the fan until it’s deafening. She lets the air blow over her as she talks. “Here’s something you need to know, you can’t see my son’s dead body unless you get in touch with Agent Coulson. You talk to Coulson, you can visit my son’s grave. Coulson’s a good man. He’ll help you.”
“Listen to your Guide, my friends,” Thor responded. “It is all of us. We have expected him as leader to piece together our pack, to tell us how to bring such divergent people together not only as members, but as family as well.”
“Apologize and tell him you’ll respect his vow. He’s a man of his word, Tony. You know that. It’s one of the things that makes him
“You’re welcome.” He bows slightly.
“Yes.”
Steve doesn’t answer.
Steve keeps a hand on Tony’s inner thigh but doesn’t stroke or move at all. “JARVIS cool the room 3 degrees.”
He reaches over and strokes his hand through Blu’s magnificent mane. “Where’s your home big guy? Maybe I can get you there when I call for help.”
“Color?” Steve asks as an older gentleman joins them in the kitchen.
Bruce only shook his head. He knew. Tony could tell that much, but he clammed up immediately.
when Bruce jumps in and keeps them on track. “Reed, Bruce Banner here, we need to know a little about what Steve talked to you about when he was in Japan.”
“Well, if it worked right all the time, then I wouldn’t need a PA now would I?” Tony says and slips Dummy into his pants’ pocket. The slight curve of it should be hidden by the front of his jacket. “Good?”
“You’ll freeze!”
THE END
Tony, whose back is to the wide elevators, turns around and invites Steve. “No, come in. You’ve met Pepper, but not Rhodey. He’s here for the weekend with his fiancé Carol Danvers.”
Steve smiles and it hurts. “It’s a nice thought, Tony. But we all know that no congress in the Stark Systems would allow funds to be wasted on a Resident Artist. You don’t even know if I’m good at all. At least, I think I’m a good fuck.” That last line causes a shift of Tony’s features as if he loathes to admit that Steve is a whore. This verifies what happened earlier, Tony couldn’t even say Steve’s status. “You know it’s okay, right? Sure, I still have some issues now and again. But generally, I enjoy my job, Tony. What’s not to enjoy. I get to have sex and get paid to do it?”
“You couldn’t have known what Zemo was up to at all. None of us did.”
Steve dropped the phone as the shame heated his face. All those nights he pretended to – he dreamed of Tony. It was okay, he’d told himself. It was just a silly fantasy, something to get the frustration out, something to ease the tensions. He’d fooled himself all along. He blinked away the tears as he stared up at the ceiling. Perverted, deviant. That’s what they called it back in his day when he grew up. It was his normal. He’d go to prison. Ridiculed. They wouldn’t do that today, but that didn’t mean it was right. But was it wrong? His brain ached in a confused mess. The pain in his head mirrored the ache in his gut. His eyes stung with unshed tears and he pushed himself to go through the Soul Mantra several times to quiet the erratic harmonies emanating from him to the others in the pack.
“Thanks, Nat.”
“Well, I’d love to spend time watching you, learning from you, Tony. It’s always a surprise to me that scientists and engineers don’t think that people outside of their discipline would be interested. We are – I am. I might not get all of it, but it’s so enthralling.”
“It was as much as I deserved. Your daughter is growing up without you because I couldn’t do better. I couldn’t stop Thanos, I couldn’t listen to my own promise.” The same old ache blossoms in his chest again.
“No, of course not,” Tony said. “I even said no the last time. He insisted.” Tony stopped. Blaming what he’d done on Steve would get him nowhere but hell.
Sam raises his eyebrow at that statement. “I’m surprised, Fury can be a hard one to deal with, but he sees the reality-.”
Tony stares down at the small toy. “I remember holding you when Jarvis – when he died. You were there all along. You’re here now. What do I do?”
Tony stops picking at the threads of the couch. “Yes. If the cube contains space – JARVIS are you saying what I think you’re saying?”
He steps across the small divide between them and he knows the second he sees the bones in the back of the nearly naked figure – his fears dry up and drift away like dust. He goes to his knees and reaches out, tentative and afraid. He should hurry up; he should get moving. But he wants to know that Steve’s alive and well, the moment he touches the shoulder every hope will dissipate.
“Doctor Banner?” Wong said. “You’ve done something similar to this before when you were able to bring Mister Barton from the edge of darkness when his way was lost.”
“I don’t really want to be nice to the predator that’s going to eat me when this is all over.” The lion was in desperate shape. Thin, ragged, his fur matted. If it got the chance it would definitely devour both of them.
“Are you two going to be able to do this?” Sam asked. “Because I want to be sure before I lay my boy’s fate in your pigheaded brains.”
“I was once told we are where we come from,” Steven says.
“I will be.”
“Take care, babe. Don’t like John-boy do you no good.” He walks out and Steve follows him to close the door.
“What about me?” Tony wanted to ignore the question and ask Bruce about Sam, but he tried to cool his jets, forced the panic down.
“It’s a spy organization. What did you think?” Tony said. “They are probably jumping up and down with glee that you bonded to Bruce – the Hulk – already. Now you can control him and bring him on ops and cause all kinds of issues.”
“Jeez, I thought this was a public park,” Steve mutters.
When Steve notices that Tony’s watching him, he slows down and drops his fork. He wipes away the egg on his lips. “Sorry, I get really hungry, especially in the morning. I used to try and be more polite about it, but then I started fainting halfway through the morning.”
Sam considered him. “It’s the soul pack,” Sam said. “If you keep going like this, you’re never going to find your roots.”
Steve takes a bite out of his cracker, sweeping away the crumbs. “He’s not wrong.” But a cease fire might end with some of those very regions he wants to protect falling into the Kree’s hands. It’s not a good balance and the Black Panther of Wakanda Systems knows it. He’s probably attending the lunch to feel out other pathways toward peace.
“He nearly drained you. He was dead,” she said. She looked at him then. Her eyes that smoky green that Steve learned long ago meant that she saw things around him, the shadows and dimensions of other worlds, other times hanging close by. “He’d been crucified on the roof of the Triskelion, from what he told me. He doesn’t want you to know. I think you should know. You should know all of it. He said you went through too much, though. What they did to you, the scars they left.”
“I know.” Steve chews the pot sticker – for this he uses chop sticks. His eyes wander away from Tony, as if he wants to avoid the truth. His confidence with the chopsticks wavers and he drops the one he tried to pick up. While he works to get it again, he adds, “I just wonder which one is really me.”
The omega jangles, but he doesn’t have good footing with the spreader. He suffers for it; his body juddering in the bindings.
“JARVIS, locked the doors and dim the lights, but keep the hologram.” Tony guided Steve up onto the couch. He pulled Steve into an embrace and held him for long minutes, stroking a hand up and down his back, then he said, “This isn’t about pressure, Steve. You need to feel comfortable.”
She snickers. “I’m not talking about whether or not you screwed up. I’m talking about the fact you called me and not Rhodes or Pepper.”
That had startled Tony. He hadn’t expected Coulson to just up and leave. The idea of having him here and being part of Tony’s life even in a smallest of ways, had actually soothed some of Tony’s anxieties and given him hope that at some point he’d find the courage to deal with his memories of Steve. “I didn’t think you would ever leave. Good luck.” Tony added in a mutter, “Where ever you’re going.”
Steve isn’t even naked. He still has a shirt on, his pants (from where Tony is standing) are puddled at his feet. The man behind him only has his pants pushed down, and thrusts into Steve with a wild angry rhythm.
“So, in other words you’ve been in your rebellious phase all your life.” Steve peers over his shoulder and there’s something cocky, almost swaggering about his expression. He’s teasing Tony to say something out of line.
“Did he walk to the bed or did you carry him?” Steve asks.
Steve stays quiet, only the beeping of the heart monitor might give him away.
“This isn’t in your ledger, you know,” he spoke quietly but Tony still overheard him.
“Thank you, sir.” Steve doesn’t want to venture to the question of his months missing in action. Everyone knows where he was now, everyone’s heard the stories of Andersonville, the Confederate prison encampment where nightmares took root to grow and mature and follow a man all the days of his life.
“Come on, we don’t have time,” Steve says, and Tony clasps a hand to him.
“I think-.” Tony stops he’s over the moon, he hit the jackpot. He must be dead. “I think I must have died. Did Ultron kill me?”
“Come on, let’s go down to the workshop.”
“Thanos would have vied for the title of Soul Keeper,” Steve supplies.
The interface’s smooth glass like surface glitters and then the doors to the left of it open. “Good luck, Lord.”
He’s not blind, he understands consequences, but he also knows he’s been abandoned and the only person, the only soul in all of the Realms that came for him – was Tony. He’s not only in love with Tony, he’s beholden to him. He would lay down his life for him and that’s when it hits Steve, full and complete, cracking his chest, bleeding his heart. He does not need a sexual act to bond with Tony – he’s there – so close he knows that he’s teetering on the edges of oblivion.
At that Steve only laughed, leaned down, and kissed Tony so thoroughly it stole his breath. He cupped Tony’s face in his hands and said, “Oh darling, the stories you tell me.” He rolled again, the feeling sending spikes of hot need through Tony. Steve placed his forehead against Tony’s and rocked, and rocked, and rocked. It moved them in such a way as to give Tony just enough stimulation to perch him on the edge of want, but not enough to tip him over it.
He nods.
“Always,” Steven mutters but takes the sit as Tony goes to the bar.
Tony laughed to himself and his eyes snapped open to see the dark waters faded into the starry night. Why would Steve name him as friend or even lover? He barely knew the man. Tony fooled himself a million times over the years. He wasn’t going to allow a childhood dream influence him now. He needed to withdraw from longing to be a part of some weird soul pack or even from being part of the Avengers. He was on his own these many months. He had been Iron Man protecting the world before and he would be it again.
“She left you?”
“Sure, sure!” Tony waves him off and focuses on cleaning the dishes. He doesn’t think about what ‘work’ means to Steve, or at least he tries not to think about what work means. His mind is an endless wheel, chugging over and over with a cascade of thoughts to feed it.
"You don't get a lot of clients?" Tony asked because where was the money going if not for living expenses. From what Tony saw the man with Steve Rogers' face didn't seem to have a drug habit.
“I was assigned to you. You’re important in the grand scheme of things. I understand Realms are intersecting now, Asgard will cause all kinds of trouble-.”
“Sort of,” Steve says and leaves it at that, not explaining. Before Tony asks for further details, Steve jumps to another subject. “I didn’t know. Men can marry?”
“I don’t know about that.”
“I’ve been in the workshop. I thought you were going to get some rest.” Tony notes that the blankets are strew on the floor as if he couldn’t find comfort in the soft mattress and chose the floor instead.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers after a moment. “I only wanted to help. I know that what Doctor Strange said to you this morning affected you. I wanted to somehow help.”
“It is from my point of view.” He turns his attention to Steve. “Now, Mister Rogers, can you tell me a little about your last heat?”
Steve detected another presence not far from him, but not touching. He reached out only to check and found Tony’s soul a pulse away. Bruce shifted their souls, using their energy to shore up his own as he started to peel back the façade of silence. The dark waters around them lifted away only to reveal the tendrils like vipers thrashing about seeking freedom. This was Clint’s soul, corrupted by the broken bond, trying desperately to set itself free from its link to the mortal realm.
Rumlow laughed at him and rolled him over so that he saw what was in front of him.
“Steven, this is Heimdall. He used to guard Asgard when there was one to guard. He died at the hands of Thanos under the influences of the Tesseract.”
Steve rolls his eyes and says with a full mouth, “I tried to clean it. It didn’t go well.”
“And Ross,” Steve said and nodded. He felt tired, burnt out from the day and the news. “We need transportation. A way out.”
He may be strong and stalwart. He may have been Captain America once. Part of him remains, but he’s been disgraced and disconnected. Stumbling back to the sink he gags as he sees the gland again and then a wave hits him. A wave of darkness and stinging light. He blinks a few times to try and regain his vision, but it fuzzes out at the edges. He swallows compulsively, trying to steady himself. Reaching, he grabs the letter that was on the sink counter with a bloody hand and trembles. He cannot step or move – the room swings and sways. Something is wrong.
“I’m not sure; you brought it home,” Steve responds and figures that Tony has an idea about said creature sitting in the middle of the throw rug licking its tiny but delicate paw. “What did you want to do with it?”
“It’s more elaborate than most. The alpha should be able to take you here, regardless of position. There’s a bathroom there, and there’s a chest of drawers with different toys and implements. Food will be delivered twice a day. A refrigerator holds snacks and drinks and it’s by the foot of the bed.”
“Well, a little more than that.” The dark shadowed response chilled Steve.
Steve stares at him, a quiet rage thrumming through him. “I’m sorry I ever met you.” He grabs his bulky bag, drags it onto his shoulder. “I was talking to Odin because he came up to
Steve lifts his chin. “Don’t do that. Don’t think this is something momentary. I wouldn’t have told you if I thought you or I would walk away.”
“No, you didn’t.” Bruce doesn’t elaborate. “So. Logan?”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Steve whispered while he lightly rubbed Tony’s chest with the tips of his fingers.
Steve swallows hard, the acid taste back in his mouth again. He picks out a cigarette, his hands tremble. Buck has a match lit and Steve leans down to the flame. It’s warm against his face and something smooth and wonderful comes over him – remembrances of times past. He finds himself settling in next to Bucky as he inhales the intoxicating smoke.
“He was manipulated by a mad man.”
“No, no. I could use some company that’s not trying to manipulate me in that way. Other ways are just fine.” He winks at Steve. Scratching his temple and then pointing at the door where Steve entered, the prince asks, “So what were you doing down here.”
Tony goes all soft inside. “Yeah, that sounds nice.”
“I need the great outdoors, the fresh air,” Stark replies. Steve can’t get a glimpse of them, but he stops and listens.
After some time, Tony speaks, “You’re drawing me, aren’t you?”
“Buck.”
Tony’s brow popped up. “Wow! You aren’t joking are you?”
“Well,” Tony says. “You know everyone here, but my intended.”
Clint stood to the side of the puddle of light encircling Steve. What he saw, Steve refused to be ashamed. Steve stared straight ahead, ignoring Clint. The ball gag still stuffed in his mouth. He stunk of blood, and urine, and come. His chest had been torn by the vampire. His abdomen ruined by the nanobots that burnt themselves out by flaying and charring his epidermis. He still felt the burn on the side of his head where Rumlow shocked him. His mouth tasted like the plastic of the ball and his lips cracked and chapped.
Steve bobs his head. “Yeah. I do. Buc-. My friends would say that but not using that term. I think that’s a new term.”
At least his mother had always been supportive of him. He might have cried on her shoulder as a young man realizing his fate, but she told him stories. The stories of the omega warrior and how throughout history it had been the warrior to protect people, to secure the alpha and his clan, to ensure life and liberty. He might have been somewhat awkward and filled with a warrior’s rage but he was a warrior and he would find a good alpha. Someday. His mother promised.
“No, but it is time for truths,” Tony says and his words are tender, loving.
Tony wants to reach out and grab her, but he uses his voice instead. Pepper would be proud. “You do this, Ultron wins. You get that right? We have Ross coming down on our heads soon enough, if we don’t wipe Ultron from existence then we lose. Not only the Avengers but all of us. Everyone. Seriously, Doctor, do you think I matter that much that my life should balance out the lives of billions of people?”
“You’re not giving my mate pig’s blood. You’ll kill him!” Tony said.
“Well you always used to go to that little shop around the corner from the Tower. I went into Manhattan and I asked them to make some of their creamer and brought it with me.”
“How about you sit down back in the living room, and I get you a compress?” Steve says. “Warm compresses always helped my Ma when she had migraines.”
Steve’s head pops up and he smiles. He looks all of fifteen. “Yeah?”
Steve grabbed the pencil again and tapped it against the edge of the table. His nerves ratcheted up when he thought about talking to Tony. “I could try.”
“And now?” Tony asks. How the circumstances would make anything different would surprise Tony.
Tony pets his hair and whispers, “It’s almost over. You’re almost free of him.”
As he stepped up to the door of the penthouse office, it swung open to reveal the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Human Security. While Ross always looked aggravated, Pierce welcomed Steve into the office and offered a hand. “It’s an honor to meet you, Captain. My father fought in the 101st.”
“Blu?”
He kicks as the side of the large ominous machinery next to them as they hide. The impact of his bare feet (why the fuck are his feet bare) causes the plating to dent and then he tears it off using only his hands. With the plating to shield them, Steve grasps Tony and they head toward the door. The bullets ping, singing off the metal.
“Steve?” It was Clint.
That was when he stumbled to the doorway to the ensuite bathroom and clutched the frame with his hand. He closed his eyes and felt the throbbing ache. “Steve?” He felt it then, the openness, the raw wound. The soul pack was bleeding and their leader rudderless. “Where’s Steve? Right now, where’s Steve?”
He loves dealing with these foolish AI’s.  Nothing like his own. He frowns and hits the screen. “Lord An’Tony of the Stark Family. I am invoking my Right of Possession.”
“I find a lot of things strange, Cap. But I think this is just Ultron testing us.” Tony adjusts the bag on his shoulder and follows Lila. Steve notices how he clenches his fist around the handle of the bag, and he hasn’t removed the gauntlet yet. He’s on alert.
“Well, Nat kind of expected that. We’re all going to ground. Can you make sure our finances stay solvent?”  He hated to put her in the middle of this, but he wanted to ensure the safety and well being of his coven.
Tony gestures for him to follow and Steve takes his place along his side. The walking stick, Dummy, comes out and Tony taps his way to the room. He grips Steve’s upper arm and they weave their way through the maze. He’s unsure how Tony would ever find his way around the mess. Tony reads his mind.
“We’re close, Steve. Really close. I just need to get some more-.”
“I’ve always known you weren’t an early riser. I think everyone knows that. You sleep weird.”
Steve has no choice; his biology takes over and he falls down to his knees and then puts his face on the cool tile floor with his ass in the air. He can feel his slick wet and heavy at this cleft. The alpha walks over to him and examines his ass, pulling apart his cheeks and sliding a finger into him. Steve judders under his touch and closes his eyes. There’s part of him that wants to run. The last person to touch him had been Tony and that was ages ago. He forces himself to stay put, and remain calm.
“Is Tony still asleep?”
“If soul packs are possible, we all changed, Captain. Everyone within the time loop changed. The only one who didn’t was me,” Strange said and stood up. “Now I must take my leave. Good luck, and good day.”
“There’s always someone worse,” Steve states. He’s seen what’s worse and he never wants to see it again. “We face what’s coming and we do it together. We find a way through it.”
“I’m appreciative of his trust-.” Steve starts to say, hand on his chest.
“I do, but I thought they kept to themselves most of the time.”
“I should take it easy? You’re right. I will.” He stops and watches as Blu settles down in the stream of water, letting it cool him. Tony lies down next to the stream and places his injured arm in the water, the cold spring does him good. He sighs as he watches Blu roll over on his back and let the water rush over him. He’s a magnificent animal, powerful, well-toned, intelligent, and, oddly, kind. As he observes the big cat, Tony takes note of the slash again. He should get up and make sure it gets cleaned.
“Don’t do this,” Tony said.
“Sorry, I don’t have the digital key. They never trusted me with it,” Clint said. His face was pale, and his eyes set like stone.
Promising himself that he would put it all aside, Tony checked the time and decided to get breakfast ordered and dressed for the funeral. After he ordered he pulled out his phone and read a few text messages from Pepper and from R&D. Pepper’s wasn’t urgent and nothing R&D did without him was urgent either. So he went to toss the phone when another text came through.
Clint spins around like a drunken top once, wobbles a little, and then spots the painting. “Don’t know. Been there about a week, though.”
Rumlow digs out his cock which stands at attention. Steve smears the spit along the shaft, eliciting a guttural groan from Rumlow as he drops his head back against the wall. Exactly what Steve wants. He grabs the dick, twists, and with other hand balled into a fist he punches Rumlow square in the face. He hears the popping crack as the bridge gives way. He lets go as Rumlow shouts in agony.
“You’re very dedicated, Happy.”
Drool drips from Blu’s mouth and his eyes glaze over.
Which is probably true. Tony hasn’t been sleeping well. The images of his dreams haunt him during the day, and he yearns for them at night even though they exhaust him. “Well thank you.” He stows the suitcase armor next to the fridge. “Make yourself comfortable Tony. Have a beer Tony.”
“You’re always so dramatic.”
Steve stepped through as Tony welcomed him into his suite of rooms. “Not really.”
“Please.”
“When you get to recovery.” Cho pats his shoulder as they move him from the table to the gurney. His body feels like gelatin. The weakness pervades every muscle, every joint. He feels numb all over and barely attached to his body.
Tony reaches out and grasps Steve’s hand. It seems more intimate than a month should feel. “You’re not losing everything. You’re not.” Steve tightens his grip as if Tony is a lifeline to keeping him stalwart and firmly in place in this reality. Tony can’t get the images out of his head, the reality where this man is supposed to be his husband. He can’t leave it alone. It’s like a loose thread in a sweater that he just tears at, picking and picking until all the weaving comes undone. “The images are too real, Steve. I can’t let you go. I can never let you go.”
The doctor might be insane, Tony concludes. His brain blanks as he listens to the woman who looks like an Amazonian. She is tall and handsome in a beautiful way, and incredibly, unmistakably insane. Or an idiot. He’s not sure yet.
“No, yes, yes, I knew her.” Steve says and looks into the middle distance. “No point in stopping now. Right?”
“Don’t you have to prepare for the press conference?”
Tony sighs and nods his head several times. Relief loosens his shoulders and he says, “So, we can do this, can’t we? You said you love me, but do you, do you love me?”
“I think being Beloved makes our connection different though. I think it’s deeper, possibly even able to transfer more direct thoughts.” Steve couldn’t fathom why he was trying to make it better for Tony.
He crossed the distance between them and grabbed Bucky in his arms, held him close. It took only a few seconds for Bucky to respond. His whole body shuddered under Tony’s embrace and then he buried his head in Tony’s shoulder, his one arm wrapped around his waist. He spoke, muffled into Tony’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry. I wish I could take it back. All of it. There’s so much crowding my head, filling it with noise and horror. I just- I’m so sorry.”
Thankfully, the prince’s features soften to an almost playful expression. “Don’t tell me I have competition.”
“No. Tony, I don’t want to know. I just want you to promise you will stop this nonsense of disappearing for weeks, months at a time. The stockholders don’t like it.”
“We have to go,” Steve says. “But where?” He adjusts the straps of his backpack and watches as Tony does the same.
“What does that mean?”
Ross only nodded to agent who brought in the bottle of blood. The man escorted Clint out of the cell.
“I can get around, it’s just a nick.”
“A little. I’m not ready to go that route,” Tony says. “Now hush so I can listen to the ocean and drink my hot chocolate which is excellent by the way. You’ll have to give the recipe to Jarvis.”
