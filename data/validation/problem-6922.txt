“Sure, even if there are more werewolves than redheads on this earth.” Bucky answered back at the mechanic who nodded along. the wolf then tilted his head curiously and proceeded to share his own thoughts.
“I got clients here too you know. Leaving for even an hour is bad for business.” he drawled letting himself fall onto his chair, clearly unmotivated.
"You don't mind? I actually can get drunk and I feel like having a bit of fun. And for God's sake have a doughnut. "
Fury didn’t anything for a long minute. He ran his dark fingers over Goose head who let out a happy purr and narrowed it’s eyes at Tony. The wizened tried to be patient during this minute but when the King stayed mute, he decided that the negotiations were over.
“...What? How the hell did you survive on your own? How the fuck did you escape the Court’s eyes? A walking piece of granite-like you is hard to miss.
His shirt was dark with sweat and grease but thin enough for his visitor to notice the light blue halo coming from underneath it. Tony snapped his fingers, bringing back his attention to his face. That’s why he hung around with humans usually. They couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary, bless them.
“Yeah, now I know, I’m pissed because you didn’t tell me, and you just expect me to be fine I-! H-how is that a thing?
Steve looked surprised at his actions and did a double-take between their leader and the wizened. Fury said to the Fairest to leave it be and they both went away to search for the client. While waiting for them, Tony let himself rest again a tronk. Rubbing his eyes and giving short slaps to his cheeks, he tried to keep himself together. A meow made him looked at his feet where Goose was lying, belly up. Soft fur on display but Tony just glared at it.
When the three of them were on the threshold, Bucky pushed Steve slightly forward. Making him face the Wizened who looked as surprised as the blond. The wolf jerked his chin in his direction before walking away from the entrance with one last goodbye for Carbonnel. The exchange was odd for Tony but not for the Fairest who seemed to be displeased by his attitude. But he took a deep breath and did what was asked of him. Gazing directly at Tony he said:
Steve made a face at his question. Or maybe it was the nickname? To be fair, it was a shitty nickname, he needed to find another.
Our stony couple is on a rough start but it'll get better ! (but it's probably going to be a sloooooow burn x,D )
“We tell them there are other non-human beings and when they are ready they come to ask for more information. It isn’t the easiest subject to breach when many of them are still reeling from their trauma and identity.
“Are all changelings this relaxed about their... nature?” Bucky looked cautiously to his friend who shrugged. “I can’t say I understand but I know it’s no good memories.
“It has always been a thing. But Werewolves cannot see our changelings appearance so they think we're humans. Also their packs are rare in large cities. It was quite a surprise when Rogers brought him here.”
“There are.” Fury deadpanned. Many thoughts of strangulations and 1st degree murder bloomed inside Tony’s mind.
Tony lift his head to ask her more about it, but the Widow was gone. Message delivered. The Wizened looked back down at Potts and sighed. Was she close to that other him? Was she still mourning like Jarvis and it’s why she was looking for him? Even though, she won’t get any answers from him. He couldn’t speak for that Fae version of himself.
A quick hand snapped over Tony’s wrist and held him tight. Cold blue eyes suddenly opened and fixed their glare into Tony’s brown’s ones. He screamed in surprise and tried to shake his hand off, his fight or flight response clearly setting for
"Heh, you get used to it. Plus it's not as if I have a choice in that matter. I was a mechanic as a human. It was already a part of me when I.. Well, you get me. It's just second nature to me."
Tony’s eyebrows rose at that. Okay, that was a hard one. Not impossible but that was going to be hell to find the right spells, enchantments and material to realise such a feat. No wonders Agent insisted and nagged him with this, you couldn’t leave this in the hands of anybody.
The Wizened was still fuming, determined to walk out to the door when a familiar silhouette caught his attention. Tony slowed down his pace until it reached a stop. Steve Rogers was trying to turn invisible in a booth alongside a window. Alas for him, being a Fairest meant being too noticeable. He was trying, Tony could give him that: the little "Brooklyn" cap, the training pants and the large sweater would with a normal human be a nice camouflage. But it could hide the tall frame or the sharp jawline or the piercing blue eyes that would glance around curiously.
"The carvings and speels will come after I made the entire prosthetics. The wyrds follow the flow of every joint that will then help with the shifting and the morphing.  I can change the prosthetics in one shape to another but it needs to activate itself when he shifts right? That's the issue, I can't seem to understand exactly how the shift works and how to accord it to the arm... Paw. Let's call it Parm.
Thor looked at him with sad eyes, his smile still plastered on his lips. Guilt twisted Tony’s stomach as he realized how harsh he was on him. He couldn’t blame the larger changeling for trying to move on from their past and Thor didn’t deserve the anger when he had only ever be kind to him.
Tony felt his body froze. The weight of one of his real names suddenly on his shoulders. He glared at Fury who was still wearing that infuriating poker face.
"Oh god. Buck he's actually dying, and letting it happen." Steve's face had gone white, and Bucky jumped up towards his friend, worried he was going to collapse.
"I would listen to him, Sir. I've never seen Steve this murderous. That's saying something considering I was with him in Russia." Clint's voice suddenly appeared, containing a similar level of anger in Steve's voice.
He couldn't help just stopping for a moment, and closing his eyes, relishing in the sun on his face, and breeze against his cheeks. He forced himself to snap out of it, and took off at a limping run, knowing that the moment his adrenaline wore off, he knew all his injuries were going to come back to him at full force, that and he knew it wouldn't be long before he was pursued.
"Okay. I want to see if you can press this buzzer in case you need anything, I won't be far, and I'll check on you, so you won't be alone, don't worry." He placed the buzzer in Tony's left hand, purposely making sure he was always in Tony's line of sight, and after a few goes, he clumsily pressed the button, he thankfully didn't need too much force, but if he just made a fist, and bashed it, it would go off.
Tony opened his mouth to speak, and began to panic as no sound came out, and then there was pressure in his throat, he tried to raise his left arm, but was only able to lift it an inch or so off the bed before it flopped back down.
"God, I shouldn't have mentioned that. It's Steve. Tony, it's okay, you're not there, you're with me. Please."
He tore through the forest, focusing on keeping his feet moving, and away. He eyes were focused on the ground ahead, while periodically looking up and around, also using them to compensate for his damaged ear drums, ear drums he damaged in an explosion during his great escape. He was relatively sure they could heal, but he didn't have the time to wait for them to do so.
"Hello Miss Potts. It has been a long time." JARVIS sounded bitter, and Pepper couldn't help but wince, feeling like he was blaming her for something.
"Thank you." Steve said, just loud enough to be heard over the hissing. "So, where was I up to? Yesterday, Tasha smiled, like a full on toothy grin, Clint was even teasing her that she had finally 'got some'? She only smacked him once for it, which according to Clint and Bruce, he's lucky he's not dead." Steve's voice seemed to break on the last word, before he cleared his throat.
Judging by the spike in Tony's blood pressure, his heart rate increasing, and the look on his face, furious wasn't even close to describing how he was feeling. Unfortunately, his abused body struggled to keep up, his diminished lung capacity from the reactor was bad enough, but the amount of secretions in his lungs, and higher need for oxygen, a need his body couldn't currently provide, sent alarms blaring and people rushing into the room. He could hear people talking but, due to the rushing in his ears, was unable to make it out.
"It is okay. You have a tracheostomy. That's why you can't speak, and you'll be weak as you've been in a coma. Can I do some observations?"
"Yes, sir." JARVIS said harshly, he wasn't happy about what Tony was doing either, but when giving a direct order like that…
"Rada says he's been with them for three days, and has had a fever for the last two, it only got significantly worse yesterday, since then he's been hallucinating, and drinking little. His wounds don't appear to be infected, so she was thinking it was his lungs. She's given him what herbal remedies she had, and sent her husband and son to the nearest town the day before yesterday for antibiotics, but they won't be back until tomorrow at the earliest." Tasha spoke now from his left, next to Bruce.
Rob helped him out of the chair, he could now walk for a decent distance, he was going to the end of the corridor and back, but he was still building up some muscle strength, and with only one arm, he was struggling to get out the chair and upright without a little help. Rob took him into the bathroom, gave him towels and wash stuff, showed him where the call bell was if he needed help, and set up the chair in the shower in case he needed it, then closed the door and left him to it.
"Well remember that I was the one who stopped you going to the Raft for the rest of your life. I was the one who saved you from death row."
"Welcome home." J greeted him as he stepped into his mansion in Malibu. He hadn't set foot in this place since a few days before his abduction, which was now over a year ago.
"You win." Steve whispered, then in a flash, was gone. Leaving Tony to breakdown as he finally realised what he had done.
"He was scared of me Thor. You didn't see him… I know he's a fighter, but his heart was already relying on the reactor, even without the pacemaker Bruce had to fit into it, and he is breathing artificially through a tube in his throat. I'm not even so sure he wants to be here anymore." Steve took a shaky breath. "I'm not ready to let go of him yet though. Is that selfish?"
"Sir, lovely to see you." Tony smiled, and tapped out his response, and J waited for Tony to finish before he spoke. To his surprise his own voice came out the speakers.
Last he remembered, they had split up over half a year ago, hadn't spoken to each other since, and Tony had died… hadn't he?
"You're not yourself. Come on. Let's get you dressed." Steve said quietly, desperately trying to hide the pain on his face the comment made.
"Oh Tony." Steve's voice came from the doorway, he entered the room and sat on Tony's bed, as Bruce slipped out of the room.
"That was all we heard for six months, until a source close to Mr Stark told the press that he had recently woken from a coma, a coma which he had fallen into shortly after his captivity. Mr Stark still hasn't been seen out in public since being at JFK airport, where we now know he was travelling to Germany, although multiple sources have reported to us that he had self-discharged from a private hospital almost seven months ago, and his whereabouts are currently unknown. Some speculate that he is suffering from depression and the effects of PTSD, and now cannot be in public due to his mental illness.
Tony could feel movement against his hand, suddenly the arms didn't feel as constricting, more comforting. Steve. He tried to match his rapid breathing to Steve's, something Steve must have picked up on, as he slowed his own down.
"There was a world threat from some aliens a few hours ago, Steve tried to stay, but he was needed. It's actually the first time you have been alone since you were brought here." Tony looked at Rob, and figured if he can't speak, he could try and mouth his questions, thankfully Rob seemed to understand. "You're at a private hospital outside of New York, you were actually at the Avengers Mansion until a few months ago when there was a threat against the building and thought it best to hide you a bit better. You've been in a coma for around six months."
"Steve's… been having some issues with SHIELD, and due to some clause in some contract, they managed to take JARVIS, he's refused to work for them, unless it's benefited your well-being, and Steve wasn't… pleased. But now you're awake, the clause is null and void, and as your next of kin, Steve needs to go to SHIELD and get him back." Clint said quietly.
"Ah. He's just upset. I recommended he take some time out, he's not left here for longer than 12 hours before now. I know he wants to be with you, but it's not healthy."
"Hey Tony, sorry." Rob's voice came around the bed. "I was looking at some of the machines on the other side. "Feeling better?" Tony shrugged his left shoulder, and looked around the room questioningly. "Not sure where everyone is, other than Bruce. I know there was an… argument yesterday, and Steve left looking upset, but asked Bruce to stay with you. Bruce is talking to the hospital's director now. He shouldn't be too long. Now, we are to try and see if we can wean you off this oxygen, then the physio's are going to come over later, and try to teach you how to clear your lungs a bit more effectively. And talk you through some exercises for your arm and legs that you can start. They were doing regular therapy with you before to try and stop your muscles atrophying as much as possible."
"Mr Stark, Tony. I know it's a shock, but it's almost a medical miracle you're here at all. You're one lucky man, also having such a wonderful group of friends who visited so often, the amount of times I've seen visitors for those in similar conditions to yours dwindle after the first month or so. Also, your husband, definitely a keeper, he has stayed every single night, and most days."
Central Park was finally in sight. Tony was leading the way, offering from time to time to carry Hank, but Steve knew that offer was just in good will. It was worry dictating their sprint toward the gates; luckily the park hadn’t been struck by any of the explosions, and still maintained the fresh and clean atmosphere even as surrounded by chaos as it was.
Tony sat down for hours, trying to use what he could to assemble it. The faceplate was first, then the helmet, down to the neck. The back piece was the hardest since it had so many pieces but he decided to take inspiration from his earlier designs and weld over it until it was a flat surface with ridges just for his back. As long as it served its job of protecting him, then it was fine in his eyes. The chestpiece was done and slotted with ease over his chest, complete with the bright light in the centre that was now his only source of power for the suit. Then he reached the legs. He stared at the red boot then looked at his new leg augmentation, still writhing over the fact that it was Osborn’s technology. It wouldn’t be part of him unless it looked the part, or of course he refused to let it be part of him. Tony worked on the leg, pulling out some of the circuits and replacing them with his own, and then finished off with the boot cover. Ever since Extremis he’d been getting closer and closer to his suits, and always said that he and the suit were one; now they really were.
He wanted to kill Norman, but he knew that would be letting him off easy, now he had more important matters to tend to.
Though in reality it was nice, at least for Tony. Terminator Steve, on the other hand, had a differing perspective.
The familiar feeling of his hand wrapped around the neck of the bottle was somewhat soothing; the way his hand slid along the glass as he pulled the top open without even needing a bottle opener. His entire body was so numb from the pain and loss as well as guilt, that he couldn’t feel when opening the bottle had left a large gash along his hand that was oozing blood the instant that he placed it against the cool side of the bottle. This was his saviour. He had slipped so far into darkness there was no use finding a rescue rope, it was time to just accept his fate and slip down to join the other shadows in the abyss of despair.
The sound of trickling water was the only sound in the entire room that Steve was locked in. Patterns and traces dancing down the curve of his back as water sprinkled from the shower head, his golden hair that was always perfectly styled now dripping wet as a mop of dirty blond over his eyes. Steve rested the palm of his hand on the tiles of the wall, just allowing the water to engulf him. The steam and mist from the warm waters, the only warm presence in the entire room, bringing him a sense of serenity.
Tony slipped even further at the jerky movements of the man he was gripping onto. He needed to use his hand repulsors again to keep him upright, but that’d mean losing support from Steve entirely. He had to risk it, so he pushed himself off the man and attempted the hand thrusters just as he’d done before.
Steve’s eyes shot open at what was before him. Bruises coated Tony’s upper torso to his shoulder, down his arms, which was why he hadn’t been wearing anything sleeveless lately. “What happened to you…?” He whispered in shock.
Steve stepped through the door in his bright blue shirt accessorised with a custom tie that he was given to match his shield, a gift from Carol, looking rather dapper even without the dark blue blazer that he was wearing earlier that evening. “I know, I know.”
“That suit. It’s not right.” He was quite frank with his wording. “You know during the fight, didn’t it seem… odd.”
“This has nothing to do with me being new to this era, this is dangerous, and I know danger when I see it.”
It could’ve been said that Tony feared her, just a little, but that generated more of an unspoken respect. She was strong, loyal, powerful, stunning and definitely not to be messed with.
“JARVIS… What do you see?” Tony asked again. “JARVIS?” He tapped his faceplate, groaning as he noticed there was some sort of signal disruptor about, that was the only way JARVIS would be blocked. “Hammer, that’s slimy. Come on, play fair!”
With a discontent huff, Maria headed out. Normally she wouldn’t, she wouldn’t dare budge, but she could see by that look in his eyes, the pause and dip in his tone, that this meant something entirely different to him, which was perhaps the reason that Fury was so keen to hide it from him. Rather than return to one of the jets, she stayed by the outside of the door, just in case. This after all, was a mission set by Fury, and she wouldn’t let go of it that easily.
Peter was the one who made the first move by shoving the first heap onto the pale body, Tony followed and didn’t stop until they both had managed to cover her up, and raise the ground back to the level that it once was. Honouring tradition, Peter grabbed a brick that wasn’t hard to find considering their surroundings.
“C’mon, c’mon…” Steve whispered under his breath, desperate to catch up with Tony. All things considered he was actually worried about him, wondering if the driver had a gun, then Tony would really be in trouble.  They could only slip up so much before they were caught out, Steve knew that for sure. But it was no use; the car wouldn’t go any faster.
“Touché!” Danny grinned, sweeping back his blond hair that was lodged out of the bright green bandana by the powerful gusts that swept along the feet of the robot, that slowly drew its legs back and went for a kick, luckily the draw back motion was slow enough and both Luke and Danny stood together with their feet firmly planted in the ground. Luke grabbed the foot of the bot was already stable and Danny threw a solid punch once his partner had stabilised it.
Steve took a couple of steps closer to him, casting a shadow as he seemed to loom with his large stature, “Tony...”
They had both been on kitten duty for an entire week and everything was starting to become routine, which wasn’t great for men like Steve and Tony who would often thrive on excitement and adrenaline. Whilst they were on patrol in their (now cleaned up) cop car, Steve sighed quite audibly.
Panic was an understatement. He felt intense pain just from looking at it that made him yell with shock, screaming into the sky. Tony’s tools were his hands, they were his most valued treasures, his real genius and outlet – his hands were his everything and now one of them had been taken away from him. He should’ve counted himself extremely lucky that it wasn’t his dominant hand, to be stripped of something he valued so much made him quake with fear. Internally he wanted to count his blessings, but it was hard to when he was riddled with agony and sadness, bitterly reminding himself that ‘it could be worse’, that didn’t work even in an ironic sense. He was much more vulnerable without it, not that it was the only thing on his mind at that point; he was scared, afraid of what had happened, afraid that he was unable to prevent it—afraid that he was unable to save Steve.
“Sacre bleu!” He turned around, catching the bright red gleam of Tony’s rocket boots and gloves, heading straight toward him. The man twirled the corners of his moustache in anticipation as Tony neared.
“Yeah, he had the usual. I brought food down for him but he ate two plate-fulls. At least he’s eating, right?”
“What’s that?”  He asked, gesturing to the monitors. There was far too much scientific jargon for even him to comprehend.
!” he yelled, turning around in his swivelling, huge, leather chair, arms resting on either side as the feline in his lap made a loud meow in protest until his silver gauntlet-covered hand rest on top of its head, to which it closed its eyes with contentment. “I know, Morgan, we must get rid of Stark once and for all…” The cat purred, its tail brushing along Doom’s wrist. “MODOK, did Batroc at least manage to place the tracker on Stark?”
It was the one day of the year where he was actually allowed to sleep and he undoubtedly relished the time in the smug confines of his king sized bed, furnished of course with Egyptian cotton sheets. Only the best especially since he was sharing it lately. Even though it was a shame that his partner tended to enjoy nights in the gym and being nothing but consistently busy as opposed to letting his mind rest and actually drift to sleep. But Tony didn’t blame him at all, particularly since he was the same – possessing a mind that would never shut down. So it’s not much of a surprise when Tony opens his eyes full y and stares at the blank space where the super soldier should’ve been resting. His hand reaches to the smoothed sheets that lacked warmth and felt his heart sink a little. Strangely enough, Tony loved waking up next to people, especially Steve. He loved to hear his soft breathing in the morning and would always amble closer to use him as a pillow. Waking up without him like that morning left that empty feeling in his chest.
me,” Steve kept repeating to himself aloud, hardly heard above the engine, but still, repeating it only helped push his sense of urgency and made him drive faster. The radio blasted too, but HELEN turned the channels from music to the news. That’s when Steve heard…
Tony shook his head. “I was just thinking maybe fresh air might help.” His voice was a husky whisper.
Steve stood by the water dispenser, taking a sip from a Styrofoam cup. Being told to wait in the staff room while everyone went about their day wasn’t exactly how he thought he’d spend his first morning; he’d been thinking of being out in a car in a high speed chase or wrangling up some robbers from a local bank. New York was full of crime that needed to be stopped and in his mind every second that he was spending idly sipping water next to a cooler was a second wasted.  It was hard to stay peppy while his thoughts went to what he could potentially be doing. He drifted further and further into his thoughts before Jessica poked her head into the room again, just in the way she’d done before.
“Uh… Son, do you mind telling me where I am?” Steve asked as he knelt down to talk to the child, confused as to where he was and how he got there. But suddenly his wings were more opaque to his own eyes, the tips bending as he looked around, confused.
“The assimilation process isn’t complete, Mr Stark, you can’t just pull him out into the real world like that!” One of the lab assistant’s yelled.
“I’ve saved you and you’ve saved me before, Tony. I think we’re beyond thanks.” He said with a breathily chuckle.
“Yeah, yeah.” Steve gave Tony a playful shove, and it was met by the dark haired man wrapping both arms around Steve’s huge bicep which did take both arms to wrap around to finally catch a comfortable grip, pressing his cheek against the round of his shoulder.
Six days without sleep was almost unheard of for a human being. There wasn’t one person that could out-last Tony Stark and his immutable insomnia in the entire tower, and yet Steve seemed to do it without even realising. Tony had grown past thinking that it was just the serum keeping him awake, coming to the sad realisation that it was indeed something much more than that, a realisation that he didn’t want to make.
As soon as he reached his lab his disassembly line assembled around him to try and pluck pieces of the suit off him, but it was harder than he expected. His eyes lit up, trying to use extremis to disable the suits systems completely which worked a little. The pieces were still being stubborn though, and he could feel wires trying to push up through and into his veins until they were wrenched away, causing his golden under suit to recede, clutching his wrists that still had numerous circular puncture wounds that were seeping with blood.
“Don’t worry, I’ve got this, Rogers!” He replied, reaching into his pocket and pulling out one of the gadgets he was working on in the car from time to time. Then again Tony was constantly working on new things when they were alone on patrol, between cat-rescues. This one was a small circular device. “Handy dandy Stark destabiliser!”  He beamed, holding it up in the air for that added dramatic effect, before slamming it down on the hood of the car that he’d managed to scramble to. At first nothing happened, it just fizzled and Tony frowned, muttering to himself before tapping it a few times and then suddenly—
Tony reached his hand back to pat the bot on the head, to see its eyes flashing happily again when he did so. “Shhh, Jarvis, he doesn’t need to know that.”
Tony slowly got up, brushing his jacket off again and frowning at the leaper. “Go go Stark soap!” He said, his trouser pocket making a DING sound. Steve turned to him, confused as to what he was doing next. Tony reached into it and tugged out a bar of soap, pushing it into Batroc’s mouth.
Drops began to fall on the mess of papers in front of him, blurring the ink that was scrawled all over them. Water spreading, tainting, blurring the reality, obscuring and acting as a catalyst for the ink to bleed while more and more drops fell from Tony’s eyes onto the paper. His hands balled into fists by his side and he began to sob between gritted teeth.
Their bodies were melded together on the mattress, after hours of pleasure, Tony never being more grateful for both of their extreme stamina thanks to the serums they both had injected into their bodies, but he had never met his match, not until today, and boy he had never been as grateful as he was that moment. The feeling swirled in his stomach, he they both knew that they weren’t going to last.
Steve tapped his radio. “Carol, we’re trapped in lab upstairs, Janet and Natasha are outside – make sure they’re safe. I’m sure Clint’s got their back.”
Stepping back and glaring, Norman returned to the computer, typing in a few commands and with that, Steve heavily stomped toward the two.
The dog tilted its head, its large ears flopping either side as it did. “Ah yes, Officer Rogers, Sir’s new partner. I’ve heard ever so much about you.” It spoke, returning to tending to the other bots, nudging them with the tip of his nose to attend to what they were supposed to be doing, tilting its head to Tony as a bot scooted over and began to work on his arms.
His hand reached and settled on Steve’s shoulder “Whoa, slow down there.” He could see how Steve’s skin paled significantly when he rose. “You okay there? Steve?”
And with that the connection was cut, just as Steve had anticipated. At least he had managed to convey a message, but he had to try the others, going through the radar and radio systems and attempting to fiddle with the wires to recalibrate the signal tune to another teammate’s radio.
“I’m on fire?! Put it out! This is an Armani coat!” He waved his hands around. Suddenly, that cool collected demeanour Tony had before in the office, briefly, had faded into the image of a fumbling inspector.
“And your chip, the one you three have since you were recently incarcerated, you have a hybrid chip which can potentially engage mind control on you?”
With relief he stepped to the grips that held Steve in place and began to knock them away from Steve’s face. “Come on Cap… Let’s get you out of here…” He paused before he finished. He freezes, his eyes being the only movement, panning to the needle that was injected to the top of Steve’s spine. Suddenly panic ensues.
The patriotic star spangled man growled under his breath. He hated his city being in danger as much as anyone else, but bombs in recent times, the increasing terror threats since that dreaded day, always made him tense up more than usual.
“Steve, I got it, okay. Eeesh, calm down…” Tony groaned, slowly unzipping the suit and letting it hang by his waist, pooling on the bed.
It was all white noise to the man that seem mesmerised as he took a step closer, eyes locked with the ones that he was so familiar with. One foot followed the other getting even closer whilst the blond haired man just stared at him with narrowed eyes.
“When the military were trying to cordon off the disease, try and contain it, they bombed everywhere. Napalm, manly. Millions of casualties. It wasn’t any good, not at all. You know what that meant? More augmentations for those affected. ”
Steve skidded to a halt in front of the young woman, with Tony flying past and clearly struggling to stop, so instead he performed a giant U turn but that wasn’t before the wind below generated by the jet of the boots managed to blow away a young couples well organised picnic, yelling “Sorry!” on his way back to Steve and the young lady.
The floors were black marble, the walls lined with fine portraiture all of Victor himself, but the style of the paintings gave off a renaissance vibe, that along with the peculiar looking suits of armour that they’d passed in the hallways. Everything about Victor screamed a lust for power and Tony kicked himself for not having noticed this sooner.
Tony nodded and took a sip of the black liquid before placing it down, but he almost spilled it when he jumped after he heard a loud noise. Quickly Tony made sure the glass was one sided again and there Steve stood, a towel around his waist as he punched the wall over and over. He looked over to the punching bag to see it on the floor, beaten down and ripped, and now Steve was punching at the wall blindly.
It had been an entire day since Steve had been in quarantine. As promised, Tony didn’t sleep at all. The engineer was running on nothing but the constantly refilling pot of coffee that was several steps away from him. He sipped from a mug that was in his hand while he was staring at a couple of calculations. Tony had moved his workbench so he could face the observation screen and keep an eye on Steve while he was working. A day was nothing for a man who would spend days on end awake, so this was none other than a casual all-nighter for him. The rest of the Avengers had long since come to the conclusion that Tony Stark was nocturnal or that his blood was brown – filled with coffee.
The team stood, respectfully, all seemingly eager to take down their assigned target. But there was a quietness about them, an uncertain shift about their movements that indicated that there was something making them uneasy, but none of them could quite place what exactly was making them so unsure. Carol turned to Steve, as did T’Challa, as though he were to confirm Tony’s orders.
The kiss heated and Tony began to make soft sound under the kiss, not whimpers, but mewls of satisfaction, having finally after all these years met the lips of someone he had held so dear. Pieces of his memory began to flash through his head, and the instant that he had reached the segment where they were at war he found himself screwing his eyes up tighter. Pushing more and more of himself into the kiss, wishing that event had never happened.
“I’ll love you until I die, and beyond that. Stay strong. –S Rogers.” It read, it was definitely Steve’s handwriting, that distinct messy scribble. He placed the paper to his nose and low and behold, it even smelled of him. He held the letter close to his glowing reactor that seemed to be glowing even brighter after he had found the letter.
A more rugged version of Steve appeared on the screen with his hair slicked back in a messy coif, stubble lining his square jaw and an eye-patch covering one of his eyes. “Colonel—Good, perhaps, but not close to what I have in mind.” Tony held a hand to his chin. “I
“You speak like you’re straight out of those fairy tales…” Tony sighed. His heart was still pounding from the kiss, his lips yearned for more but there was a hesitation, a pain in the back of his mind that he feared. He feared rejection, he feared being left alone after destroying what he had with Steve.
“It’s true, I mean, well… You believe and trust me Tony, and now I’m just asking you for this one thing, just please believe me…” He said, reaching around and touching Tony’s wings again. This time Tony felt a strange sensation surge through his body, it was as though he was feeling someone dive into his thoughts and he looked up at Steve.
The soldier was breaking. His heart was crumbling, shattering, tearing – every single possible way of being destroyed.
Steve’s palm smacked his own forehead hard enough to make a sound, frustrated by Tony’s banter, and he hesitantly peered through his fingers to see the detective flashing the toothiest of grins.
His eyelids flickered as his eyelashes weighed down with the drops of rain dancing along them. Slowly, he was pulled out of the perpetual darkness, reaching for the light.
Taking the junction, he followed the younger man instead, tracking down Peter with ease, holding out his arm as the forearm plate popped out, revealing a missile which he timed perfectly, and releasing it between the pendulum swings of Spiderman.
Tony ran over to the pile of red scraps the moment that Fury pointed it out, picking up the shards of what once was his armour. There were pieces he could fix, others were unsalvageable. With a heavy heart he picked up the faceplate that was fully intact bar a couple of scratches. “Give me all the tools you have," he replied in a low voice.
Steve was getting used to the brand new cybernetic augmentations Tony created for him. The genius was fascinated with the bond that was created between the two by using a single drone’s parts, so instead of destroying it completely, as he had intended, he ended up modifying it and maintaining the core. There was no way he wanted to severe the connection between the two after they had gained something so strong, and become even better than before. Tony built on top of the legs, enhancing their capabilities too, and creating an even stronger bond between them. Besides, Tony wanted a candy apple red arm, and he’d managed to get that, giving Steve a patriotic red and blue paint job. But the best part? The cloaking devices. With a flip of a button the augmentations blended in and appeared as though they were normal limbs, which helped Steve with the adjustment process.
She let out a smooth chuckle and replied with a rather surprisingly hard smack on the back. “Just call me Carol. You’re a newbie here, aren’t you?”
Steve groaned, trying to ignore the pain in his stomach again, but this time the wince was a clear as day to Tony.
For wings that he didn’t really believe in, Tony was saddened that they were broken.  Was he really getting upset over figments of Steve’s imagination?
The dog let out a small huff and let Tony do his job. The detective leaned closer to the device and pulled it off the wall, the lights in the building slowly coming to life, beams lighting up again, the alarm starting to sound once more.
“There are some things about me that no machine will ever change, Tony.” Steve said with a beaming grin, throwing his shield in the way he was well accustomed with at the other lab assistants that came at them with the same black and hollow stares. He watched it ricochet off the others, returning to his hand then whirling it out for another go.
Tony launched himself forward and pressed his lips against Steve’s, his eyes tightly shut. This seemed like the end of the world to him, so now he could carry on without regret.
Tony’s phone was finally returned to his pocket after a good while of fiddling around with it. The sound of Steve’s feet scraping against the ground was starting to grate at him already, and he could only imagine how annoying it must have been for Steve. Still guilt ridden, Tony was keen to suggest alternatives to help Steve. “Hey, Steve, you know we can’t walk around in these tatters.”
“There’s something inside me Tony.” He whispered to the screen, lowering his head a fraction to count for that inch difference in height.
“It’s you!” He said proudly, “I got all of them. They’re mine. They’re my favourite.” He said, hugging it close to his chest. Steve gave him a soft smile in return, ruffling up Tony’s hair.
“It’s possible.” Reed considered that but was beyond curious, wanting to learn more about what exactly was pushing Steve’s blood through his body with a lack of functioning circulatory system. He needed to investigate. By a force of habit his thumb pressed lightly into his temple, rounding in a massage motion to somehow provoke further thought on the matter.
At that moment, he saw it. He saw a man in glorious red and gold armour step out and fire a blast from his palm at Tony, knocking him flat on his back to the ground. Tony roared and tried to get back up, clawing at the leaves around him before a man in stunning red white and blue stepped up to him, standing over him, staring with wonderfully azure eyes as he held a strange looking gun to his forehead.
He gasped, chocolate coloured eyes sparking to life right away with a wide blink. He gasped as he inhaled fumes from the surrounding rubble and smoke and began to cough and hack, his hand reaching over his mouth and covering it. He was strewn out on the ground, on top of something but unable to move his left arm. His shoulder twitched and he tried to move it, but even with all of his strength he couldn’t raise his hand up.
“It appears to be quite severe. Symptoms that it can cause range from flashbacks to the past to ringing in the ears and even blurry vision.”
And with that, he left, leaving Captain America in his dream world, giving him sanctuary, solace and peace.
Their duty was to serve as soldiers of God. To fulfil the word of the creator. Protect and guard with the purest of souls finally getting to return to heaven, where they shall get all they have ever dreamed of; past the golden gates and into paradise to rest for eternity in bliss.
“I did. I don’t sleep much.” He walked a little inside, the small padding of Tony’s fluffy slippers with his initials on them catching Steve’s ear. “So I work. And it appears you don’t sleep either.” With good reason, and Tony understood that first hand. There was a reason that he always had trouble sleeping, and sometimes it was the constant threat of bad guys trying to kill him in his sleep, and others it was night terrors from when he was taken hostage and forced to build a device to keep himself alive, and the constant torture he had gone through during the interrogation and capture process.
Natasha rolled her eyes, knowing that it there was much more between them as the rest of the team did, finding it amusing that they had taken this long to work it out between them while Janet leaned closer with interest, trying to hear more about the two.
His breathing quickened, his body felt numb but he knew that he had to do it. This was the only chance he had if Steve’s condition continued to worsen.
“Its times like these you could really use a drink, huh?” he asked with a weak smile, trying to shake the remainder of blood and dark fluid off his mechanical hand.
Steve was pounded to the ground, taking batter after batter to his chest and abdomen, gritting his teeth, furrowing his brows and just taking it, hacking out as he felt the wind leave his lungs every time he was hit.
Internally his thought process was wondering why this door wasn’t opening at all. At some level, he realized parts of his brain had shut down, certain segments misfired wildly. He could still think, he could still feel a knot in his chest whenever he looked up at the blood drenched muscular man that dragged his feet over next to him. He wondered if Steve could feel the same, thinking to himself that he probably could.
The man was on the ground, entire body shaking as volts of electricity coursed through his entire entity, amplified by the armour he was in. It’d managed to reach Steve’s core, breaking past the Oscorp manufactured Arc Reactor and rebooting it with an entirely new, enhanced energy force. The shock that occurred during impact fried some of the circuits, the raw energy incinerating anything that couldn’t handle it.
Peter raised his arm and shot some webbing over the rooftops that shrouded the alleyway in an attempt to create a canopy to shield them from the lights that came their way, as if that would help, but desperate times called for desperate measures. The webs weaved to cloak them in shadow as Jessica tugged at Tony’s arm to guide him away, but he was far too focused on Carol. He knew that buzzing in her eye wasn’t just a coincidence, there was a trigger, and perhaps her viewing the chip that they had taken out had been that very trigger. That just proved another point to him, that these augmentations weren’t just tracking people, they were being used as Big Brother.
A civilian walked by and without even stopping to think about it, Steve grabbed the young man and began chomping away. There were loud screams from nearby and Tony ran to join Steve, helping him tear open the bowls of the person that they had taken down.
“So do I,” Steve agreed, pulling his gloves a bit higher up his arm so that there was not a single crease in the bright red fabric.
He kicked Tony’s side, watching as the rib panel of Tony’s suit was broken into. “I even tried to make the humans kill you. I had such an easy way too - Captain Marvel was supposed to be another test that failed. The compatibility has something to do with the serum; perhaps maybe, it was his conditioning. Either way Captain America is the only successful test on a superhero. So I’ve had to kill every other superhero because they were the threats to my program. But she was just great to use as an incentive for the public to fear heroes. Who doesn’t fear a hero gone crazy? So the humans would feel threatened and they would kill her themselves, but once again you had to step in the way… So do you know why you’re here, Tony? Do you know why I’ve kept you alive for so long?”
Reed stretched his left hand over to squeeze Tony’s shoulder once more, feeling how very tight the muscles were at that moment. “You need to use your head, my friend. I know this is the worst situation to be in, but maybe you need to spend time out there yourself. Perhaps some time with Rhodey?”
Steve gasped and looked back at Tony, frantically trying to grab Howard’s wrist, but it was as though he were a hologram, going through him. Hell, he couldn’t even be seen by the man he was trying to defend Tony from.
Tony was a man of science, but he’d known with his previous work with Victor years in the past that the man was open to all sorts, and even teased his belief in magic, of which Tony had constantly mocked him for, as did Reed.
“Here!” Tony threw over a syringe that he’d picked up at the hospital. “It’ll knock her out for a while.”
Suddenly the sigh of relief didn’t seem very relieving. His dark cobalt eyes darted up to Nick, his face set into a harsh frown.
“Oh, it’s a formula one of my interns helped me with, his name is Peter Parker, certainly a bright tool!”
Whenever he tried to think about it his mind would drift onto other things, mainly the constant and reoccurring pain in his stomach. He had attempted to ration the food that he was given as he was used to back in his own time and back on the field but he would feel his mind just black out completely, as though he had fallen into an abyss and when he had finally managed to heave himself out of it, the food was gone and his hands were covered with the crumbs and remnants of the once whole meal.
“You don’t mind if I borrow your medi-scanner do you? I’m in extreme need of preventing my hypochondriac of a wife from taking our children to the hospital whenever they get so much as a cough.” Reed spoke, though exaggerating in this case to a large degree.
“Yeah, it’s a great one. Keeping this one. Definitely. “Tony spoke proudly, slipping his phone back into one of his white pouch-pockets and dusting his gloved hands off, feeling accomplished.
The faster Steve’s hand moved the closer Tony felt to the brink, his palms gripping tightly on the man’s chest, his nails trailing down the cold steel to make a screech but ensuring he made marks, wanting to possess him as he’d wanted to do for so long.
Tony staggered around aimlessly, sniffing out something and following the fresh scent that wafted his way. Steve followed, hunching as he walked, the broken shoulder he had from the gate smash drooping to one side.
The first observation that he had made was that the hand was in fact not part of his armour at all. It was black, thin, a skeletal structure that moved as though it were real. It began to tremble as the realisation became more and more clear, noticing how it was attached to his elbow and that was where it ended the trembling alone was just too realistic, too humanistic.
Tony was about to pin the guy to the wall, palms facing him before the leaper grabbed Tony’s hand once it neared him and threw him into the wall behind him. Tony, with such a strong momentum powering him had no choice but to crash into the wall.
All of the Avengers had finally moved in, the house was packed as even the others from the West Coast had come for the grand (re)opening of the Avengers mansion.  Parties were something that Tony loved, and Steve loved too, especially when it came to mingling with his future team mates and learning about each of them. It was a surprise when he had encountered a familiar face, one from World War II and his recovery mission long ago, Logan Howlett. Though it did seem that his memory wasn’t as good as it used to be, nonetheless, it provided a little comfort to the solider that he wasn’t entirely alone as much as Kid Omega loved to say otherwise, but it was banter (assumingly). A range of different personalities, a cluster of noble souls all gathered in one place.
“Shut up.” Peter sassed back, tired of this entire debacle by now. Internally he wanted to admit that this was Tony. He was conscious of his projecting, aware that if this was nothing but wishful thinking…
“Keep running!” Steve shouted, hoping to find the main lab soon by darting into the elevator and leading the others there. Tony grabbed the doors and slammed them closed.
“I made a mistake with it, in the first place. You don’t know how many people were hurt because of it!” He could see the way it pushed Rumiko in his mind, repeating over and over, the way it took him away, and now it was being used again. He tried repeatedly to destroy it and now he had no other options – he had to fix it before it was used again for evil.
Steve waggled his finger at Tony. “Don’t get cocky. We can say it was the perfect balance between tech and old smarts.”
He ran between gaps in the machines, keeping his back pressed to the solid iron plates behind him, peering just around the corner when he had managed to catch a flash of bright red and gold coming right at him.
Robotically, Steve turned his head, staring down. Blonde curtains making the cyan gleam much brighter as his eyes were shadowed.
“Steve Rogers...” Tony muttered, leaning down and resting the edge of his chin on Steve’s head, happily sat over his lap.
The loud doors creaked just as loud as the staircase that he was on earlier did, the rusted hinges squeaking before letting out a low judder. Steve was prepared
Steve held him close, not even hesitating for a moment as his grip tightened, his hands held against Tony’s skin.
Tony stuttered, burying himself into Steve’s chest but he couldn’t hear a heartbeat, he just felt the heat of his body that he had yearned for all this time. “Steve, no, Steve...”
“Those are my boys, you’ve got Dum-E, Microchip, and that one with the arms is… Arms… I built them myself, pretty impressive, no?”
“Please Tony… How can I… I don’t know how I can prove it to you.” He said, as Steve spoke his wings began to droop a little. Tony squinted again, seeing the beams of light behind Steve suddenly lower, as though they were moving according to his mood. The more disappointed Steve was in Tony’s lack of belief the lower the lights seemed to go, as though they were trying to envelop him to comfort himself-  as though Steve was wrapping his own wings around himself.
… I’ve been working alongside Tony, helping build and develop him into the man you see today; part man, part machine. He’s a perfect mix if I do say so myself, I’m quite proud of my work and I’m sure he’s a valuable asset to the rest of the department. He is rather unique and involves constant improvement. My calibration techniques assist Tony in performing far more efficiently.”
“I’ll fly so high in the sky that no one can hurt me. I’ll take Jarvis with me too. We’ll fly away from here.” He said with a firm nod.
Tony had to slide off the bed, regretting the decision almost instantly, the cold hitting him right away. His undersuit crept up his skin and he reached for some of the parts of his suit, sitting back on the bed with the acrylic shard and a couple of tools that he’d found from the first aid box; a scalpel and spoon, even the smallest tools were the most helpful in those sorts of situations. It was time to fix that power regulation problem.
"JARVIS called Buck, asking for help to save you, I got one of your old reactors from Stark mansion, and came here. If Pepper hadn't been here, you would have died. Bruce is on his way too, Tasha and Clint have gone to get him, so he can fix your old one, as this is one of the palladium ones." Steve gently traced around the reactor, as Tony looked away, feeling ashamed that he had failed once again, while he didn't actively kill himself, he let it happen, and couldn't even do that right.
"Captain America spotted at the annual New York gala for War Veterans last night, minus wedding ring and a beautiful blonde on his arm. Is the romance between America's two most famous superheroes over?" Tony should turn it off, it was only a gossip channel, but his mouth had begun to dry up as he realised that Steve may have truly moved on, and continued to watch. "The great love story between Steve Rogers and billionaire Tony Stark started five years ago, where they were first pictured in an embrace after a battle in Florida, shortly after Miss Potts, confirmed that they were due to be married later that year.
"Reconsidered?!" Steve roared, Tony heard a clang like a chair being flung. "You are the reason he is here! It was your man who told Hammer where he was! And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me he had been abducted until a few days later, and didn't give us any leads for three weeks. I probably wouldn't have found him if not for Tasha and Clint defying your orders. I don't fucking care whether you believed that I would 'compromise' the investigation or not. You don't get another chance. What has happened to him is on your head Fury. Now get out. I don't want to see you, ever again."
The various agents in the halls, while utterly shocked to see the billionaire there, jumped out his path, not wanting to be the subject of his ire, and only mildly surprised when they saw him storm straight into the Directors office.
And while the calls and texts dwindled, the only person who stopped trying to contact him was Steve, his most recent voicemail citing that he couldn't do this anymore, Pepper implied by the texts and voicemails that she knew where he was, but as he blatantly didn't want to see her, she wasn't going to force herself on him.
"Me. The flashbacks are… horrible. When I was washing, I could only wash with a flannel." He then with some clarity was able to smell his own odour. "I stink."
"We have attempted to reach Stark industries, and the Avengers for a comment, and they both declined. So, it appears that the two are separated! We shall miss this couple dearly. We also would like to wish Mr Stark a speedy recovery from all of us here. Now onto the best and worst dressed-"
"I won't be long." Steve smiled at Tony. "Don't leave him." He glared at the others, one rolled their eyes, one glared back, and one just nodded seriously.
"I'm sorry, you know I can't tell you that. It's looking more promising, but his brain activity is relatively unchanged. Although he still hasn't shown signs of brain death, so there is a chance. It's still a waiting game." A soft female voice came from Tony's left.
"You look like the same old Tony, if not a little slimmer than normal, and looking more bad-ass with a slightly busted nose." Natasha smirked, covering for a crestfallen Clint who was suffering under Steve's glare.
Tony looked around, feeling a little helpless, if someone walked through that door right now… no he wasn't going to think about that, there was no way Steve would leave him if he wasn't sure he would be safe. He instead decided to take stock of his body. He could wiggle all of his toes, and the fingers of his left hand, his right however, while no longer extremely painful, the instructions from his brain didn't seem to make it to his hand, and continued to lie there motionless. His sight was completely gone in his left eye, but his hearing was relatively fine. He could see he wasn't connected to any machinery other than the monitor, which meant he could breathe for himself, although he was curious as to why he had a tracheostomy, and secretly a little terrified of the thought.
He lay sprawled on the ground, taking stock of his injuries. Between the broken fingers and nerve damage to his right arm, loss of a portion of his sight in his left eye, multiple previous concussions, deep gash in his thigh, broken and crooked nose, burn marks across his body, water in his lungs, lacerations just about everywhere else, and severe dehydration, Tony understood he wouldn't survive too long without medical attention. But he couldn't help but let out a small chuckle of relief, which turned into a splutter, simply pleased that if he was going to die, he'd die free, and by dying he could defy his captors that one last time.
"Does your chest feel a bit tight?" Tony nodded, and Steve pressed a button on one of the machines next to the bed, which started up what sounded like a small motor, and then his lungs felt a bit warmer as humidified air reached them, he could quickly begin to feel some of the tightness receding. Steve perched on the edge of the bed, and Tony lay his head on his shoulder, looking at his other teammates.
"Clint can you now attach a new bag of fluids to that line and let it run, don't squeeze, I don't want to overload him. Tasha, take this and attach it to your side, it's antibiotics."
"Tony, you're going to recover from this chest infection, get your rector fixed, and then you're going to talk to someone. It doesn't have to be me, ideally I'd like you to talk to a psychiatrist, and if that fails, we will get you admitted until you're better. I'm not expecting you to be back to the 'old' Tony, but I want you to be able to live, not simply survive."
"See, back to normal soon." Steve said happily. If Tony could have he would have laughed, he knew how long, tedious, and sometimes painful this whole process would be, and it will take him about a year, if that soon, to be anywhere near his old 'normal', if that was even possible. Instead he frowned worriedly at Steve, truly understanding how off balance Steve had been by everything, and he didn't miss the worried look Bruce also shot Steve.
There was complete silence, then the clicking of Pepper's stilettos and almost silent tread of Natasha, and the door shut quietly behind them.
"Try the workshop." She trekked down the stairs, and didn't see him there. "I don't… oh god, Tony!" She had spotted his feet, peeking out from behind a desk, the rest of his body hidden.
Pepper had received a strange call from Steve, saying JARVIS had called him, and she needed to get over to Tony as soon as she could, and was thus now outside his house.
"Put him down!" Bruce was there the moment he was on the ground, tilting his head back to try and open his airway. Tony knew he should be breathing, but simply didn't have the energy. "Clint hand me the i-gel. Size 4."
"Mr Barnes, I contacted you to inform you that if this device isn't repaired, which it won't be without your help-" JARVIS suddenly stopped speaking.
Unfortunately, even death couldn't be that easy for him. He knew that by the steady beeping of the monitor to his left, and soft sobbing to his right.
"I came as soon as I was told. I'm sorry you were alone." Tony looked at him as if to say 'are you an idiot', and something must have translated as Steve chuckled through his tears. "I love you."
"So?" "All of them are from either Mr Rogers, Agent Romanoff, Doctor Banner, Miss Potts, and Mr Hogan."
When he came to he was on a hard cot. It was cold outside of his blankets like the tiles he was used to, but before he opened his eyes he could tell he wasn't in his cell, from the cot, and from the lack of blinding light above him, also he could tell his largest wounds had been bandaged.
Bruce then, for the first-time Tony had ever seen, started crying. Full on body shaking sobs, and while Tony placed a hand on Bruce's, he wished he could talk to tell him what an idiot he was being, but instead had to listen to his best friend cry.
Tasha then left, and the click of the door closing was so final, he let out a shaky breath and look up at the ceiling, addressing JARVIS.
"Take it one step at a time." Clint piped in, eyeing Steve seriously from where he was perched near the window, the super soldier just waved him off nonchalantly.
Tony repeated to himself over and over again, as he saw the completely and utterly heartbroken look on Steve's face. Steve reverently picked up his husband's ring, and held it tightly in his fist, looking Tony directly in the eyes.
Someone was holding him, the men from Afghanistan or Russia, he was unsure, but he had to get away, or they'd hurt him again.
He fell on his knees next to them, and quickly pulled the faulty reactor out of his chest, and skilfully reconnected the new one. Then everyone held their breath as they waited to Tony to take his.
By this point Tony had taken a step back, he was very mildly aware something was being shoved into his throat, and Bruce was pumping air into his lungs, but was relaxed and pain free, most likely due to the lack of oxygen to his brain, but those were just details.
"Sorry U, just make more noise when you're on that side, and I'll know you're there." He patted the robots strut who had bleeped sadly at Tony's jump.
"I need one of you to attach the defib pads to his chest, in case we need them, and the other to get the emergency drugs out, get some amiodarone and adrenaline out and ready. Then grab the orange bag and set it up, it has a CPR machine we designed that should be able to work around the reactor, so we don't do more damage with conventional CPR."
Steve wanted to touch every part of Tony’s body and couldn’t hold back his hunger, pulling his lips back and trailing down kisses along the edge of his jaw and toward his collar bone, nipping possessively. Tony happily obliged with his head tilting accordingly to allow Steve more room to pleasure him, his hips gently rutting against the other man to show his intent which was met with a happy murmur to Tony’s flesh.
Tony could hear a whisper from behind the glass, heaving himself up and staring at Steve, watching his lips move to utter those very words over and over.
He scrolled through more possibilities before his attention was distracted by the mirror, and he moved to face it again. “I want him with no inhibitions. Ruthlessness encouraged, but this needs to be
Steve knelt down, but Tony stopped him before he could say anything, holding up his hand and pointing the repulsor at MODOK, allowing him to hear the high pitched charge-up noise it made as a warning.
He bypassed the disk and leaped forward as quickly as he could, latching onto the scaly fabric of Steve’s costume just above the abdominal plating. He stared up at him, giving him a comfortable smirk. His actions seemed counterintuitive, even to him, but he knew his logic would prevail – although not with 100% certainty.
“How am I supposed to do that Steve? Don’t you dare, don’t you dare ask me to do such a thing!” He shouted, pointing at the glass with a quivering index finger, his entire body unable to stay still. He could feel his heart beating quicker and quicker as rage began to overcome the sadness. “Not after that, not again!”
Peter pushed the gate open, with the broken chain that was supposedly to keep the park off limits hung loose. The clatter of chains against the iron bars made the sound echo even louder  and caused a haunting chill to spiral up Tony’s spine. After the ex-billionaire shuddered he walked inside, now seeing makeshift tombstones made out of things like bricks and planks of rotted wood with carvings where benches used to be, and children used to play.
The smell had led them to a woodland area of the park, a mini forest with a tiny man-made pond. Tony stepped through the water, reaching a tiny man-made creak to spot a little girl clutching a doll with Steve craning his neck to spot her too. She was whimpering, crying as she held the toy bunny in front of her face. Eventually she peered over the top of the doll and began to shake more at the sight of the two. Steve tilted his head at her, feeling a sinking feeling swirl within him, with that he turned and dragged Tony away.
Tony instead held up his hand, indicating Steve to hold that thought while he pulled out the antennae from his hat and then placed his thumb to his ear, squinting.
“No… You know…” How was he going to phrase this? He’d known Tony all of his present life, Tony Stark was the man who had first sat down with him when he had arrived there, he was the one who took him to museums, shown him everything he had missed, sat in theatres to show him inspirational speeches that he hadn’t been there for, he’d given him the Avengers mansion and a place to stay as well as introducing him to a group of remarkable people who soon became his friends and family, furthermore he gave him a home and most of all, gave him a purpose. Tony Stark had given him everything he could’ve ever asked for, and it was then that it had clicked properly; Tony was an angel. He was Steve’s angel throughout everything.
“Steve?” he called out again, turning from side-to-side to see nothing but the mess of rubble that he was standing on. He took a few more paces. “Cap!”
“What kind of malfunctions, Tony?” Now his tone was becoming more serious, his eyebrows furrowed, giving Tony that glare that he would only see him give criminals.
Tony glanced up from a circuit board he was working on, lifting his large golden framed goggles to perch on top of his head, “There’s a small glitch, Reed…it doesn’t seem to be working properly on some people.”
Steve stared at him for a moment as they exchanged a stare that in his mind lasted for hours. It was so intense, just so warm. Tony looked so in need of Steve’s comfort, and strangely enough it was as though the Captain could feel something in his chest – a feeling of guilt. He wondered for a moment if it was just too much time being spent with Tony that he could feed off his emotions. After all, Steve was surprisingly in tune with others emotions, especially Tony’s given their unspoken bond that had turned into something much more in secret. Something in him urged him to brush his hands through Tony’s hair for a second, just in gratitude before they stood up again. “Feels better too. Come on, I know you’re eager to get back – the sooner we get back the sooner we can get in contact with the others and check that they’re okay.”
It took months on end for Tony to recover from it, hell, he couldn’t even stand in front of cameras and deliver a coherent speech, and talking in public was his forte. If he couldn’t manage to pull himself together just for that, he didn’t know what he could do. Resorting to drinking again, without his pillar to keep him sturdy, seemed the best option he had. He loved Steve very much and he didn’t need to say it for everyone to know that the feeling was mutual, and it was just a sheer shame that things had to end up this way.
Once back on course Tony continued to navigate. “Left, Straight, keep goin’!” he shouted with excitement, hearing the buzz of adrenaline ringing through his ears. Steve felt exactly the same way, eyes on the road until they spotted the end of a purple and yellow painted Peugeot just over the hill.
It was one of the most interesting speeches Tony ever had to make, alongside the lab assistants to help him deliver it. The hardest part of it all was when he had to tell Steve that his friends had died, and Bucky had died during that explosion and was considered KIA. Surreal was the word, especially since it was as though he were talking to a living doll. That speech of course came after the soldier had shot up in bed, tugging off every wire, ripping them off as though they contained some sort disease.  He scrambled, tried to escape and it took about 8 people to try and hold him back, but Tony refused to treat him like an animal. He negotiated with him, said he could leave as he wanted as soon as they talk. The Captain agreed, but blamed his compliance internally on his disorientation, using this talk to bide his time until his head cleared and he could at least gauge where he was and how he had gotten there.
“Calm your bones…” Tony sighed, pulling out the acrylic shard and then beginning to make a small incision into the neck. The shard wasn’t the most hygienic thing to use but it was the only tool he had to work with. In the exact same place as Peter’s chip was, was the supposed ‘anti-toxin’ chip which he supposed everyone this day and age had in order to survive. “So, you know about the tracking in this thing huh? What’s it for?”
Tony coughed up a pool of black liquid, collapsing to the ground with his cheek pressed against the cold metal tiles, a coppery taste filling his lungs.
“Oscorp made the augmentations before the government got super involved. They gave them to hospitals, and special augmentation clinics gave them to people, and then after that a select few were asked to submit. Superheroes and us, were asked to submit. The people weren’t asked at all, why ask them? They ain’t going to provide any use. Like your registration act, it’s like that. You give in and then you get to work with the government. Obsorn, Stane, Hammer, Bain – they’re the ones who submitted. We weren’t told about this, none of us were, we found out after the submission period ended. So we were shoved out, whether we liked it or not.”
Tony began to stammer, his chest aching at the memory of it. “Victor… I don’t know what happened to him, but I’m sure it was brutal. When I tried to find him, they’d taken him back to Latveria, probably with injuries leaving him nearly dead. That’s the last we heard of him. All of this was for some stupid schematics… Those very schematics that were used to save me. You see, Steve, my body was almost completely destroyed in the huge explosion when we crashed – I mean, think about it, oil tank and collision – of course there was an explosion. My body was taken back and I was a lost cause, about to be left to die, when Reed stepped in with the schematics and decided to use them to save me. So my own brainwork along with Reed’s was used to build me into the ideal robot, the ideal police tool, the perfect detective. Which is why and how I’m standing in front of you today.” Obviously there was some work needed on that ‘perfect’ police tool point, but Tony elected to leave that out for the time being.
“Sure, yeah, just let me, I’ll be right back.” The dark haired man pushed himself up, with Reed watching him instead. He coughed and dashed out as quickly as he could to get Steve some food, anything he could grab.
Now that he and Steve had made peace with each other, and as keen as he was to atone for his broken promise, for now he had his head rested on the table – his cheek pressed against the metal surface that reflected his untamed beard that was growing further and further out of control with each passing day; unkempt. He breathed softly in his deep slumber, but his mind was plagued with nightmares about betraying his closest friend.
A sad sigh escaped Tony’s lips, but he knew that Steve was still alive. He could feel his soft breathing as he held him close, knowing for sure he had to get him as far away from the public eye as possible. That, and he had to get back to Carol to make sure that she was safe where she was, considering that they left her in such a state back by the park. That and he had to get Peter back from whoever had taken him and he needed to get his helmet back. The first call of action was to return to the hospital and pass the park on the way, that way he could get Carol and take her there too. The main task would be trying to navigate himself back through this foreign place without Peter’s help.
“Explosion was by the park, just a bit further up. You know how long it’s taken for the park to look like that after what happened?”
In truth, Tony Stark was sick of it. He sick of being trampled on, and he was especially sick of his genius being suppressed by those that he cared for and constantly tried to help. He was a gift, the voices in his head (a side effect to using the symbiote as a base for his armour, though tamed as he thought it was, was unsafe for that very reason – a reason that Tony had dismissed relatively quickly) reminded him. He was doing the world a service, creating deterrent after deterrent to the madness of world conflict…and he had been rewarded with the title of ‘lord of war’. The funny thing about turning over this new leaf was that the new adapted habits that would have served to make his younger self’s gut churn in anger were now meaningless to him. He felt no guilt over making others suffer because of their mistakes, especially if they had no faith in their newfound messiah. In fact, he was beginning to
He knew what he was looking at. The device Reed had protected with the lasers was a dimensional mirror, allowing one to see into any dimension they so chose. All Tony had to do was to input his desired criteria, and the results would appear in front of him. His attention pulled to a computer screen just beside the mirror and that was where Tony began his work. He wanted someone strong, loyal…no,
“I know, I know…” His eyes fell to his hands fiddling nervously in his lap. “I just want to do a good job.”
“It appears Batroc has been captured.” A disgruntled voice replied, much higher than the one that had posed the question. The strangely formed robot with a huge head and tiny legs, seated on a floating chair with a tiny rocket thruster keeping it afloat, moved from screen to screen.
Steve tore himself away from the screen and turned to the food, eating just as he did before, quietly huddling the food to himself and trying to make it last this time. As much as he wanted to take slow bites and chew it all it was as though his body was trying to fight against him at that point and began tearing and ripping at the food. “I’m so hungry…” He muttered between bites.
“You mean they didn’t tell you?” Tony craned his neck to get into the car, peering over at Steve who was busy with an entire box of tissues that he’d found in the car, desperately trying to clean himself and his once pristine uniform off.
The last thing he could remember was walking the streets, heading to Coney Island with Bucky when he was sucked into an overwhelming darkness, and now it was still dark, just at that moment he could hear voices scrambling, some distant mumbles about being fragile, and then a mention of Captain America.
Steve met Tony’s eyes with surprise, shocked that he was willing to go off their assigned task, but relieved too. He placed both hands firmly on the wheel, grinning.
The behemoth of a man took Carol’s arm, lightly at first and gave her a deadpan expression. She tried to smile reassuringly but the grip began to tighten and tighten. That moment she knew this man wasn’t desperate, there was just something wrong with him. She tried to yank her arm away, but even with her extreme strength he pulled her down, throwing her to the floor with immense force.  The concrete slab which she was thrown against cracked with the weight of her back pushing down on it. She let out a yelp of pain and Jessica ran in, only for another woman this time around the same height as Jessica to run in and punch her hard in the gut. She came out of nowhere, again at a speed that didn’t match her body. That same deadpan expression echoed throughout, and she turned around with precision and elbowed Spiderwoman whilst she was winded. Tony didn’t want to stand there and watch, and he certainly wasn’t going to even if he was instructed to.
“You have to give him credit, he makes great robots. This looks way more life-like than his suits do.”
Steve jumped, facing Tony who was in his red velvet robe, leaning in the doorway of the lab. “The one you’re looking at, it got hit by lightning. I was fighting a guy named Whiplash when it got hit. It’s not been the same since…”
“I wouldn’t.” Norman cut him off, pressing down on a miniscule remote, whilst his hand rested in his ornately lined pockets.
“Armies are nice though, you could always use them to do other things rather than completely useless drones that just become suicide bombers. No sense of self preservation, always depending on others to save them.” Norman preached, kicking Tony’s hand away and turning his back on him, only to stare at the wall of stasis tubes.
“Norman, since he gained more political sway... Implemented a new legislation. No tech. All tech is Oscorp tech, so we’ve been trying to run our own computers incognito but he’s shutting down our satellites. So communication between us all is down. That means when the Avengers dispersed for safety, we couldn’t get back in contact with them unless they made it to our base, which constantly has to be relocated. So you can imagine the pain.”
“I know this is a lot to take in. And I want to help you, I feel since I’ve taken over from old man Fury, that it’s my duty to.”
Steve eyed the dashboard and shook his head; Tony tried to resist a chuckle but instead let out a snort, shrugging his shoulders at Steve while they zipped along each street, taking VERY sharp corners that almost lifted the car off the tarmac with each spin and swerve. Steve had to hold on tight, while out of Tony’s jacket a couple of belts seemed to zoom out and secure him to the seat, making a content hum when he knew that he was fastened in tight.
“It’s nothing; we just need to get you in that room for a second, just to run a few more tests.” Tony reassured him, heavy words coming from a heavy heart filled with regret, feeling as though he were truly betraying someone he held so close to his own heart. But it needed to be done; it was in Steve’s best interests, so he was telling himself.
“Tony, please, just tell me the truth! I’m sick and tired of being lied to and being made to undergo test after test.” Steve pleaded this time, though his voice remained harsh and curt, the inflection and the slope of his eyebrows was much more begging.
He suited up straight away in his anti-contamination suit, priding himself on how great it looked compared to the biohazard suits the others would enter the room in. Carefully the armour locked into place, clicking and sliding until it was all secure. The faceplate was the final piece to slip on over the shell of the helmet, making a loud clank as it firmly secured itself over Tony’s tired eyes. Within moments he could see through the tinted lenses; they added a cyan hue to everything that he could see. Stepping through the first chamber and then into the main room, he finally stepped up to Steve. This wasn’t the first time he had walked in to examine him, of course he was there with the others. Although the first attack haunted his mind he reminded himself time and time again that now that Steve was sedated he couldn’t move, he wasn’t awake, he was barely conscious – he was comatose.
Obediently following the command he rushed and did the same, the figure looming closer, cackling loudly and throwing the Jack O’ lantern shaped bombs toward the two men. Tony and Steve dived either way of the bomb, with Steve’s heavier legs being much more difficult to move in.
“Shhh... I’m here... Tony, I’m here...” He said, lifting Tony’s face to rub his cheek against the boys.
“So, first of all, you’re probably wondering what brought us together.” Hammer started off, as if he were in some sort of business presentation ready to introduce his product.
That was the first time he’d called him by his first name, properly. It just slipped out by instinct, smoothly sliding off the tip of his tongue.
The second they were outside, the flames burst from the inside out, taking over large portions of the building. Tony’s eyes were lit with horror as he watched his heart and soul become engulfed in flames; all of his suits, all of his hard work, all of the memories of the team – all gone. It was difficult for him not to well up at the sight of it.
“Because it’s my work, and my work will always, always be better than Oscorp,” He replied firmly, showing off his hand as he held it up and wiggled his fingers. Peter huffed happily in return and then crawled a little closer to Tony.
Tony sighed and patted the dashboard, the car slowing down a little—just close enough to hear what they had to say.
He could feel a shiver down his spine and brushed it off as the after effects of the release of emotion,  then he felt it again, a touch to his back. His eyes fluttered open slowly, turning around very carefully as he spotted Steve’s arm, curved around him. Panic washed over the blissfull feeling and he stared at Steve, who still had his eyes shut.
have been outdated, there was something he could never lose, and that was his faith in humanity over technology.
“I think the number increases every time I ask you.” Steve chuckled, shaking his head, and managing to get Tony up to his room, placing him down on the huge oversized bed that looked overly extravagant as usual, once more with an ornate golden headboard that had an iron man helmet each corner of the bed-stand.
Steve snapped out of his daze, still seeing speckles of white light before his attention turned to the plane, latching onto it alongside Bucky who followed Steve’s movements.
Steve frowned and gestured to MODOK frantically, “Tony, keep your head in THIS game, not those games!”
“Your assignment’s here.” Fury sorted through the few papers that were left on the desk and slid it across the large desk toward Steve dismissively. “Now get on it.”
He laughed. Sometimes Steve would say the most naïve things, he guessed that it was all part of his upbringing and the fact that he grew up in a ‘pure era’, considering he was in the war and all. He half expected Steve to be nothing like the comic books when he first woke up. He expected him to have a potty mouth, just like the rest of the army lads. But as always, Steve proved him wrong, and was one of the most mild mannered gentlemen that he had ever met. Shy in some cases, when it came to talking about intimacy, but still a man.
“I’m not, I’m just trying to tell you the truth-” Steve pleaded, watching Tony get to his feet. His eyes once more drifted to the damaged wings that seemed to trail on the floor as he walked.
Finally, after all these years, he and Steve could cease their bickering and work together in harmony to bring forth the perfect world that Tony had envisioned. This was just the start.
“Steve?” Tony made a cautious tread closer to the glass, realising that Reed must’ve left the two way function activated. “Steve, how are you?” That was a stupid question and Tony cursed himself for asking it.
Tony rolls his eyes and carries the heavy bags, that Steve made look as light as paperweights, toward the tree, placing them just by the stump and tried to avoid the Vision who was busy trying to decorate that giant thing.
Within a split second Steve’s expression shifted from concern to apoplectic. Then greeted the man who had just awoken with a smack across the face, forgetting his hand was now covered with metal. Tony swung his head to the side and winced in pain, clutching the spot on his jaw.
“They’re… Really dark, damaged… they look broken.” Steve said as he delivered the sad news, genuinely looking heartbroken.
For the life of him, he couldn’t remember his last moment with Steve, he could remember seeing him, fighting him, but that was it – and that was infuriating all in itself.
“I know the feeling.” Steve nodded sagely. “My ma always wanted me to join the force so here I am, don’t regret it for a second. Though what gave it away?”
“Security access is limited to Fury, huh? So I take it he’s hiding something…” As he had proven during acquisition of SHIELD, nothing was too big for Tony to handle, even though being Director was proving particularly difficult, especially when he was trying to solidify and fine-line the details of an act he had in mind, but that could wait till a later date. Now he was focused on finding out what exactly it was Fury was trying to keep under wraps, and it was the ideal time, knowing that the man wasn’t there to stop him somehow. Even though Tony was the director, Fury always found a way to maintain his power, but that was soon to be undone.
He stepped carefully, the rubble making rattling noises as he passed through, metal footsteps echoing throughout the hall. Tony finally spotted the door which he had been in, and took those last steps toward the room, placing Steve on the bed that Peter once rested on and then fell on the other bed, shutting his eyes and taking deep breaths, coughing a little at the initial dust. There it was, looking right at him; his beloved helmet. He reached toward it with hands shaking from fatigue and held it close, giving it a peck on the faceplate before placing it back upon its resting spot.
“A scarf for Strange, a pair of matching jumpers for Billy and Teddy, Sam gets that new baseball jersey he was eyeing up, Bucky gets a gift voucher for an all you can eat diner that serves the world’s biggest 14 inch pancakes in Hawaii.”
In the dark room there were two beds and set of curtains separating them with some machines either side. This was definitely an old hospital room. He took a couple more steps in toward the beds, sitting on the edge and bouncing a little, dust flying everywhere. “Well...” He paused to cough. “Guess we’ve got ourselves a room in hotel de mort.”
Tony blinked away the tears that began to brim in his eyes, watching on helplessly as the Captain sat by one of the walls.
“Never mind.” Tony brushed him off. “Anyway… So, that was the accident, and now you know and realise how valuable these schematics are. That’s why I need to keep them secure.” Tony stood up and paced over to a huge machine, pressing a few buttons and tugging out a small disk, holding it up into the air. “These are the schematics. Now that you’re my partner you need to know too, to keep them safe at all costs. Reed’s here to help us, and you know how fantastic he is, he’ll keep them under lock and key as he has this whole time.”
“I can get to him quicker with my boots.” Tony said, gasping and ducking back into the car when the open door knocked a lamp post with a loud PANG and flew off, hearing a couple of angry civilians scorning in the distance as the door rolled on the sidewalk with a loud screech.
This had become his routine; whenever either of them had a nightmare that they simply couldn’t put behind them, they would venture into each other’s rooms provided they didn’t have company and rest assured that they would be safe next to one another. It was a mutual understanding, a bond that they had both shared, even just as friends…though that additional comfort was undeniably something more. Once more, it became apparent to Tony that Steve was his support system. After that entire…episode back in the searing heat of Death Valley, Tony was filled with constant nightmares of Steve being taken away from him yet again in the worst ways possible. He was grateful that he didn’t have to explain that aloud to Steve.
Tony was jolted awake when he heard the loud thud, raising his now reddened cheek and rubbing it while he turned to reach for the switch to make the glass two sided again, but everything was chaos in his head the moment he woke up. He had to snap to his senses and smacked the button to adjust the settings of the quarantine screen, that’s when he saw it; black smudges along the screen with spider-web cracks, very small ones, but they were still there. It must have taken immense strength to even phase that glass, so seeing it broken made Tony’s sense of danger spike. He then heard the screaming, the shouts of pain and kicked the chair that he was sitting on away while he stood to his feet to look at Steve who was on his knees, clutching his head and screaming.
“Tony… Tony I promise you, I’ll do everything I can, you’re my everything, you are…” He said, hugging him tighter, but Tony didn’t really seem to react. He carried on sobbing.
The blond was more confident than Tony had anticipated, though he did make a mental note of how many women would fawn over him and that natural confident persona that made the Captain who he was managed to transfer through to Steve, of course it would, Steve was the man behind the shield. The Captain’s strong arms raised, instead of stroking him with it, he was rolling his own hips against the dark haired man, the feeling of their lengths slicking against one another made constant moans of bliss escape the Tony’s hand heart shaped lips which were soon hushed by the crush of Steve’s lips against his own; heated, desperately, longingly tasting him. Tony’s hand scrambled over for the bottle of lube that had rolled next to him, letting out a soft murmur against Steve’s lips as a warning before lifting it up to his mouth popping it open with his teeth, making Steve’s entire body tense at the sound alone.
From the sheer emotion and intensity of the kiss, a small tear was squeezed from Tony’s shut eyelids.
“Tony, please.” He opened the door fully, now on display was the beautiful set up that just an hour ago, and was a complete mess. The tree was fully decorated with ornate accessories, the fire was lit and stockings were placed above it. The smell of turkey wafted up Tony’s nostrils as he took another step inward for a better look, his eyes widened with awe.
Steve’s vision focused after moments of his world being reduced to a hazy blur, and he made out Tony against that blur. Just as Tony was about to touch him Steve shook his head and coughed out, vomiting out a large black spew of liquid that trickled down his chin, colouring his bottom lip grey.
“I’ll handle it,” he mumbled. “We’ll just have to stick with a divided force, divide and conquer, like the Romans.”
Tony kept his arms around Steve’s strong frame, trying to keep calm, taking deep breaths to steady himself, he was caught up in Steve’s pain and could practically feel it. With each ear-piercing yell that Steve let out echoing his broken tone Tony felt closer pushed to the brink of tears.
A dim response if any, Tony’s pitch lowered, imploring the man, praying that this display of submission would speak louder than words, continuing to lay as he was. As if he could move any further. Definitely not in the state he was in.
“ Well let me make my own assumptions. I have in front of me a changeling who spent 10 years without even looking for a Court, who doesn’t know shit about our society and now knows better. You must be incredibly smart! Or just full of yourself. I also can see you’re not letting go of that ring who stinks Fae, and since you’re a Fairest, it doesn’t seem stupid to think you’re more than a favourite. You were a lover, a high-class mistress for one of Them. “
Thor lifted Tony a bit higher with a thoughtful frown, unbothered by the squirming man in his hands. The Wizened could hear the snickers and laughter from the people around and tried to shut them up with a glare. Unsurprisingly it didn't work.
Widow siped her glass and Tony left his stool, ready to leave this place. Not before grabbing the plate with the doughnuts. He would send the plate back to the pub. Maybe.
Fury turned on his heels and started to walk deeper in the garden, followed by Steve and Goose. Tony wondered if he was the only person who didn’t follow Fury blindly. Sadly, at this moment, he was there for business. So with a sigh, he begrudgingly went after them. The moss and plants seemed to merge together the further they went, rising up high above and turning to a semblance of oak trees. A sick feeling started to grow in the changeling’s stomach. The way the place seemed wide but stifling at the same time, the lack of sense in the flora surrounding them….
He motioned at one of the wooden beams of the pub. Sitting on the highest was a sleepy hawk who seemed more inclined to nap than to watch Tony. The Wizened sniffed unconvinced. He didn’t like changelings who stayed in animal form too long. He had bad memories with an octopus changeling who got too friendly with him. He turned back to complain to the barkeeper but alas, he has rushed away to the kitchen. Probably scaring the cooks to death with his booming voice and commands. The mechanic sighed and rubbed his face. If it hadn’t been for the fear of meeting Ms Potts he wouldn’t be hiding here he would be back in his workshop, happily taking in clients and doing his job.
On the other side, there was what they called the “garden”. It didn’t look like a garden if you asked Tony. It looked like the inside of a cave: rocks and moss with strange flowers who didn’t seem to mind the lack of sunbeam in there. In the middle of this strange place…
“We don’t mix well with others.” he shrugged. “We keep an eye open for other changelings but that’s it. Our Court says it’s too dangerous and reckless to engage with others…” he waved at the man’s whole body. “other you.”
Tony sent a side glance to Steve. Fury didn’t seem to be charmed or influenced by the fairest. So it couldn’t be just because he fluttered those white eyelashes of his. So Fury probably needs a werewolf. Give him an arm, offer a community of changelings for his friend, and get yourself a loyal doggy.
While he was working he managed to chat a bit with Bucky while Steve just stayed back, watching silently Tony’s every move. Not with that frown, he meet him with, he seemed curious and interested which made the Wizened smug. Just a little. he liked to impress people with his skills. Something he couldn’t enjoy, since he played the simple car mechanic for a living. He could do so much more but no one wanted someone who had no diplomas to his name. If only they knew who he was… But that wasn’t possible anymore, he shouldn’t go down that road.
Tony let out a "meh" and felt himself being walked out, steady hands on his shoulder and hip. He blinked a few times, felt the cool air of the outside and, without calculus and schemas to keep his mind reeling, he could feel himself slipping further into slumber. But falling asleep in the arms of a stranger? That was a no-no. Quickly he pushed the hands holding him away.
Tony flinched at the mention of the... Other him. Two years that thing lived as him before ending his own life. He still didn't understand what had brought it to do so but if it had made a strong bond with Mrs Potts back then he would have to face its ghost.
“I’m surprised you changelings weren’t aware of us though. Pretty sure non-humans tend to meet or are vaguely aware of others.
Steve flinched and clutched his hand to his chest. Tony could admire how his blue eyes seemed to turn different shades of dark blue before going back to normal. Tony could only stare at them and had to blink a few times to snap out of it.
“Well bud, when a werewolf loves another werewolf, or human, very much, they fuck and pop out a litter.
.” snapped Tony. How many times did he hear those words: stay with us, don’t bother building a life outside those walls. There are other monsters, humans while never understand. It’s us against the world. Fury has lost the touch with humans but that was the problem. There were still humans at the core. You couldn’t just lock your pairs away and hope they’ll forget.
“What the fuck is wrong with both of you?!” the werewolf growled. "And call off your robots Carbonnel!"
“But if you’re not a changeling, what the hell are you?” he laughed. “No humans are allowed here and I doubt Fury is one to make exceptions.
“Why are we even helping him? Is this a deal between a pack, are we on negotiations with other non-humans?
The large blond nodded at this and leaned on the wooden bar, his long hair sliding off his shoulders and onto his resting arms.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you, buddy.” Tony warned. “That thing is also a changeling and a mean one at that.
Steve gritted his teeth, clearly uncomfortable and Tony let out a soft sigh. He shouldn’t push just because he was curious. Even if the ring was the weirdest thing possible.
“So what do you need exactly. If Fury called for me, I guess it isn’t just an arm you need. Ask away, don’t be shy, I’m good at my job.
"Don't read too much into it: sometimes it's just relaxing to be around other people like you. That's it.  What about you Rocky? Trying to drown your sorrows in some good wine and get blissfully drunk?
Tony leaned in, standing in a close face to face with the beautiful changeling, and, with all the spite he had, whispered:
“Help Barnes. We will pay you your fees for the material of the prosthetics and for the price of the enchantment, once you’ve complete and finished it-
Sorry for the long wait! This chapter was supposed to be longer but I decided to end it here because it seemed more natural for the plot. In the next chapter we'll have more of Steve and Tony bickering! And bucky being tired of them.  ;)
Fury was… Strange even for a changeling. Half of his face and body was made out of shadows. The skin seemed to fume, black mist that coiled around him, sometimes shifting on his skin like clothes. Even when you shook his hand, it seemed as if his fingertips were intangible and will turn to smoke. Only one eye would peer at you, actually looking like -well- normal. Slinking between his legs and running up towards Tony, a ginger cat miauled at the guests. The Fairest actually smiled softly at the cat and held out his hand to pet it.
“Let’s try this again. My name’s Tony Carbonnel and I won’t stare at you creepily when you sleep again.”
“You thought I was a statue not even two seconds back. Pretty sure you didn’t notice me then.” drawled the Fairest, clearly unpleased at being called ‘granite’.
Tony had to trot a little to keep up with the tall legs of the barman. Thor had this slight default of not realizing how much people struggle to keep up with him. On the good side of things, even though he was loud, he was friendly and always smiling.  Quite different from the other gloomy changelings which were probably why Fury was keen on keeping him. As the smaller changeling caught up with him he wondered for how long had the elemental been there. When Tony arrived at the court a couple of years back, Thor was already there working as the barman/server at Valhöll. They’ve met, Thor hugged him and for the next hour, Tony would get electric choc whenever he touched something. Since Tony didn’t stay long among the changelings he never got to learn much about Thor. He knew that he made his peace with being a changeling, actually bosting when he claimed to be an elemental and being able to wield thunder and lightning. Of course, he never showed anyone his powers so he was probably lying. It is too hard to use the magic, the wyrd, their body is made of, for your own benefit. You lived with it, sometimes it does shit without you being able to do something about it. That’s it.
The Fairest seemed genuinely worried and started looking around the room and through the window. As if someone was coming to jump out of the street ready to mug him. Tony found it cute, after all who didn't want the literal sosie of Michaelangelo's David to be concerned about their ol' little self. Especially when that man could easily sweep him off his feet in a very cliché way. Nevertheless, the Wizened didn't want to share his story. Not to Steve who had been allowed to get his life back and couldn't understand what he was going through. Instead, he'd rather ignore for a few more minutes the 'Potts Problem'.
"Why are truly you here Tony? You only talked to the barkeep, and that was more of a one-sided conversation.
"As I said, don't read too much into it. All of us tend to end up wandering here." Even when they don't want to.
It has been said that Fairest had the biggest struggles with going back to normal life. The Fae were abusers and probably jammed lies upon lies in the changelings’ heads to keep them by their side. Hell, Tony could relate: his own tormentor would shower him with affectionate words, telling him how beautiful and how perfect he was making him.
“That I am. But call me Tony, since we’ll be seeing each other a lot.” he walked up to him already measuring the shoulder and thinking of what he was going to do. “Never saw you around Valhöll, are you’re a newbie like Rocky?”
Tony rubbed his chin thoughtfully. He’ll probably need to see Bucky shifting from human to wolf and back to human to have an idea of the spell he needs to work on.
The surprise and the recognition of the voice made the Wizened swallow down the wrong pipe and he started choking on the pastry. Widow's expression didn't move in the slightest but she tilted her head on the side as he struggle to breathe. To those who knew how to read her, they would be able to say that she was amused by the sight. After all, it was quite a scene to see a grown man acting like a fish out of water. Thor took mercy upon him and hit him heavily on the back so he could spit out the murdering doughnut. He gulped down a few lungfuls of air before waggling his finger at the Darkling.
“I hate this place.” he whispered, earning a purr when he scratched the cat’s chin. “Out there I can pretend I’m human but not here. Never here. It’s not wrong of me to run away from it, is it?”
Hope you liked the chapter! Let's pretend it hasn't been like... nearly two months since I last updated?  In my defence, September wasn't easy on me but this story is being written trust me. But I wasn't kidding when i said it was going to be a slow burn. xD
Tony turned around with a raised eyebrow. The Fairest looked away embarrassed at being caught, for a split a second, before facing him again. At least, he didn’t shy away when caught. The Wizened turned fully towards him. He didn’t like what Steve said. He couldn’t pinpoint if it was a compliment or an insult. And maybe the changeling didn’t know it himself. Sadly for him, Tony was the kind to push and be inquisitive when something was said.
Tony offered him a stolen smile, the ones he used against paparazzi when he was younger, and offered a vague answer.
He actually nearly believed his own insult back there in his workshop. Did Steve regret Arcadia, in a land full of pain yet wonder? Did a part of him fall to Stockholm Syndrom? Was it possible to feel anything positive towards Fae even through mental trauma? It seemed impossible, especially after all the horrors, through the body modification and the whole I’m-stealing-you-from-your-life-and-family thing. No changelings had affection for Arcadia or for anything that comes from there.
Fury could silence her with just a glare, his hands resting behind his back with a clip of his heels echoing on the metallic floor beneath him.
The sun was shining, the birds were singing and the busy streets were lined with civilians heading to their workplaces on that Monday morning.  The fragrant aromas of caffeine and gasoline wafted through the air while everyone went about their daily commute like clockwork. Despite the constant honking of the horns that signified the regular heartbeat of New York City, it was the perfect day; policeman Steve Rogers couldn’t have possibly asked for a better start to his first morning working in the NYPD.
The lab workers typed frantically, and then a young lad came scuttling toward Steve, dressed in high shorts, a flat cap and white shirt, looking rather smart.
“We’ve been in the sewers and they know it. We step a foot out here on the surface and they know about it too. But they’re happy keepin’ us in the sewers… Like rats. You see, we got the latest chip in us. We can’t take it out of ourselves either without pressin’ on one of those red wires that you can go past. Sure we can help each other but none of us knew tech, and they captured MODOK and got Zola killed by those mobs.”
It wasn’t any use; Howard seemed to reach through Steve and grabbed Tony by the collar of his shirt, yanking him forward and off his feet.
They walked out into the bright light, shielding their eyes. Tony instead slipped on his somewhat repaired helmet and began taking strides through the city with a much stronger heart. Now that he had Steve by his side he felt invincible.
His frustration had reached the end of its tether when he stared up at the darkened sky, filled with clouds with one or two stars making their appearances. He let out a whimper of frustration, considering a whimper was all he could muster with the lack of strength he had left. He was completely drained and his movements clearly displayed that with their sluggish sways. His rage built up and he ended up kicking a stone out of the way, only for it to fly to one side with a loud thud.
Marc barges into the kitchen holding a raw turkey, only to have it snapped away by Tigra, who thinks it’s fun and games to chase around the raw bird, though becomes annoyed almost instantly the moment that Sam zooms past and grabs it from her grip. Suddenly the ‘catch the turkey’ game becomes a trend, with Danny leaping into the air with poise and grace and grabbing it from the unamused young lady who shoots a glare at him soon after. But that wasn’t her giving up, no sir. She stoops down into a prowl, easing her way, step by step before launching herself onto Iron Fist, who then drops the turkey. Once more, before it hits the ground Carol breaks it’s fall with a dive and clutches it to her, getting to her feet and giving everyone an authoritative glare. That stare was powerful enough to make the strongest opponent back off, and then without hesitation she hands it back to those working in the kitchen to prepare the huge bird.
The clanks of metal flooded the small quarantine room, large thuds and growls as Steve snapped at the bar, his once perfect teeth chipping away to reveal a more jagged edge each time he attempted to chomp at the metal beams that composed the first bot. Tony cringed with each loud screech of metal rubbing against the bone.
The mirror shimmered and a tall, statuesque version of Steve took the zombie’s place; as handsome as ever, but a cybernetic right arm and a white star enveloped with a red circle around it. Tony stared at him and the harsh expression remained on his face. He regarded the information that flashed up on the computer.  “General America… No, I prefer Captain. Besides, that arm of yours will have to go, sweetheart. My tech
“They’re working on a device that’ll allow the Purple Man to take the whole world under his control. Tony was under his power again, by the time he came-to they’d managed to escape,” Steve chimed in.
Fury clenched his teeth, his voice becoming more of a stern mutter, “And I’d like to extend a formal apology to Tony Stark… Who if not for his… Smarts-- ”
Steve gave him a nod, once again biting his lower lip. He wasn’t nervous, not with Tony’s reassuring attitude, but he wanted this to be perfect.  He very carefully unzipped his trousers and slid out of them, resuming his position on his knees between Tony’s legs this time, leaning closer to blanket him once more, stealing his lips for another deep, loving kiss. This time Tony let his mouth relax, and he could’ve sworn he could taste apple pie in the sweet Captain’s lips.
Peter managed to get away by wriggling constantly and pulling at her thumbs and tried to shoot a series of webs around Tony to attempt to free him from the grip, but now that Peter was free, she focused both of her hands on the dark haired man in the suit of armour. There could’ve been trails of fire streaking behind Carol due to how fast she was going; the momentum she was gathering was insane. Tony felt his armour heat up, parts starting to melt before with a pulverising smash he was thrown to the ground. The webbing around him provided little help, but that was needed, at least to cushion the impact. He backbreaking thud to the ground made Tony scream out in pain, throwing his head back. Even with that armour on it felt as though his bones were shattered.
Slowly, with that heavy pounding resonating in his chest, he turned to stare at the stub that was left of his arm.
“Guess it’s my turn to see you off.” Steve said instead, walking out of the lab and back up to their rooms, continuing the talk, probing each other with questions until they reached the end of the hall, even so, just standing in Tony’s doorway bouncing questions back and forth. Something told Steve that they’d be doing this for a long time to come.
The plank that Steve was chained to now rattled with tremendous force, as Steve’s entire body was wracked by horrific spasms, almost as though he were having a seizure. The only thing that kept his head from hitting the wall was the giant syringe that was planted firmly to the top of his spine; whenever his head jolted back, it’d hit the large tube and he would fall forward again. His arms and legs squirmed and writhed as though he were yearning to break free, his eyes opened wide and rolled back so only the whites of his eyes were visible. To Tony Stark, this was possibly the most terrifying thing he’d ever seen in his life, and he had seen some
“Never mind, I can get a new one… Those books were for show anyway.” The voice spoke in a calm, chilling voice.
“Don’t blame yourself Steve, we’ll find who did this and we’ll hunt them down. I promise you.” He spoke with conviction, comforted by the touch near the arch of his spine. He pulled back to press their foreheads together.
Now, that was a conversation starter. Tony had kept that particular room locked and sealed for a good reason. Firstly he didn’t want to fuel Steve’s ego, and secondly he didn’t want the others finding out about his fascination with Captain America, though Pepper made it clear once or twice that he was making it extremely apparent. It didn’t help when he had brought the holo-shield prototype into a boardroom meeting and kept fiddling with it when there was important business to be discussed. Tony Stark was, and always would be, the world’s biggest Captain America fan-boy.
“Such sentiment.” The bot groaned. “In moments the entire SHIELD database will be uploaded to my systems. I will have all of their knowledge. And then we shall become one, and you shall gain full control, absolute unobstructed full control.” It placed its fingers under Tony’s neck, raising his chin, ignoring the unkempt tufts of hair that managed to slump forward over his brow.
“Well, I suppose they were real, but the truth is that I didn’t know. I thought it was a dream, so I’ve not been able to see them personally – only in my dreams.”
Steve’s eyes widened with panic, he could feel his heart drumming as he inhaled sharply. Over the course of the week he’d grown somewhat attached to his new friend, the last thing he wanted was for him to get hurt. “Stark!”
“We…need to get that thing working again, huh?” he said, tapping the reactor with a stiff movement of his hand.
“Sorry Chief, guess this is why you should digitize files huh? I should help you with that sometime.” The man said in a cocky, confident voice as he removed that fedora that Steve had spotted and pushed his hand through his short, neatly trimmed black hair with stunning blue eyes that were earlier hidden by the shade casted by the hat.
Extremis’ powers now had little to no limitations, especially with the new symbiote-infused armour that he was using enhancing his abilities even further. This meant he effectively had no limit, at least, he was yet to reach the limits of his armour; Extremis was all bio-tech, all controlled by mental stimulation. He strode past, his headset taking in each exceptional detail of every immaculate device that he passed ranging from a small scale Hadron Collider to modified versions of the nanny-bots that Richards had used to look after his children whilst he, Ben, Johnny and Sue were on missions together. Reed
that Tony had thought was a potato turned around, hovering in its chair with its tiny legs dangling and mutilated face grimacing with its teeth on show. It reminded Tony of a shark, with layers of teeth lining its mouth, and a gem in the centre of its head.
“Yeah, true,” Tony replied, his arm looping around Steve’s, with the excuse that he was helping him walk.
“We’ll make sure he gets out of here, come on.” Steve gestured, running in with reckless abandon. Clearly, the incident with his legs had more of an impact on him than he allowed the others to see, but Tony noticed it and made a mental note to address it later. For now, he followed Steve with Janet shrinking her size and zooming in to lead the way down the corridors.
Steve’s eyes focused, though his iris seemed to flicker in colour. “You shall be destroyed.” The vice grip intensified.
Steve Rogers had fallen into a deep slumber, being cast into ice, frozen for 70 long years. Within those 70 years he was stuck in limbo, staring at the gates of heaven, admiring their golden shimmer but he was locked out. He was one of the few angels cast to the Earth during the war, to protect many and save countless lives. He performed his duty but was still not allowed into the heavens.
Tony slipped off his faceplate, and the rest of his armour followed obviously except the parts that were attached, and placed them in a rag of a bag that was lying around. It was more of a sheet, but fashioning it into a bag wasn’t rocket science. Actually,
“Y-yeah!” Steve snapped out of his daydream and smiled right back at her.  His azures went straight for her name badge, golden and slick, pinned and polished to perfection on the front of her uniform. “Ms. Danvers.”
“Oh, officer! How can I ever thank you?” She reached over to pluck the ball of fluff from the policeman; it meowed in protest at being tugged away from the warm bosom of the cop but eventually settled back in the safe arms of its owner. Meanwhile Steve’s attention was drawn toward Tony instead of answering the question posed to him. Tony poked his head up from the bushes; how could Steve miss that crooked antenna peeping above the greenery?
Tony stares for a second with curiosity, watching the way Steve was rummaging through the bags that he had brought back, taking out something small that he hid in his hands. “Oh?”
“Why’s that sir?” A curious young intern enquired, peeking over her crescent, thick framed glasses, her clipboard held to her chest. “He’s a hero, wouldn’t it be best for him to go and join Iron Man and the others out in battle? I mean we could always give him therapy to help him with the issues that he has--”
“If you last…” Fury muttered under his breath inaudibly. He had little faith in anyone lasting and was already prepared to just pluck out the paperwork for a new partner assignment.
Everything had changed, not only the people. Cars were all electronic, and it wasn’t much of a surprise that Oscorp’s brand label was on the engine. He tore some of the wires out that he thought he could use as connectors and then returned back to Tony’s side, trying to connect his own star shaped reactor to Tony’s flickering one. He’d done hotwiring before, and he’d certainly jumpstarted a car; hell, the super soldier had even defused a bomb . He wasn’t as technology illiterate as many people deemed him to be. Luckily Tony had faith in him; he’d always had faith in him.
Tony shook his head, “I can’t see anything...” He said, looking over at Steve and still seeing the light from the hallway cast those wing-like lights over him. “Though, the way you’re sitting, it looks like you’ve got wings.” He mused.
The more they talked the more Tony was growling and trying to desperately squeeze through the gap in the bars to try and claw their faces off. He would’ve just loved to see them on the ground, those smug expressions wiped off their faces. Their words had very little meaning to him but he still could sense that they were aimed at him, targeting him, victimising him as many had done before.
Enlightened, he decided to resume the mundane work that he had to attend to. The fun was over for now, and he was fully aware of every last detail of every operation that was now going on in SHIELD, as well as the entirety of its past. Tony Stark was now confident that SHIELD was now under his full and complete power, which made him much more secure, and it was indeed important for a man that was directing a security company to be indeed secure.
“You can feel my wings… See, only other angels can feel each other’s wings…” Steve explained, drawing off what he could remember being told during his ‘dream’ of being in limbo.
“Let me…” Steve urged, placing his hand between Tony’s legs and gently rubbing over the skin tight material. His hand made a soft massaging motion, timid at first, but then putting a bit more pressure.
“Tony.” T’challa stepped in front of him and placed both hands on his shoulders to calm him down. “It did not work. We need to find more solutions, study him more.”
Tapping the oak table with frustration, Steve glanced forward, peering at the inverted image of Taskmaster and his giant shield running amok in down town Brooklyn, which was no surprise. Steve knew they both shared that turf as their home-ground. The familiar buildings around him were prompts of his heritage, even in modern day, some had changed and others hadn’t. Still, he didn’t want anyone to get hurt, and was spurred on by his attachment to that particular area.
Steve and Tony casually stepped closer to Hammer, even though the man was backing into one of his machines.
“Mostly, my friend. However, this is not natural.” Thor gestured outside, even though the tinted windows it was clear to see that the grey that the clouds wasn’t natural, but it was tinged with a purple lining which became more visible from their superior vantage point within the mansion.
They held one another for a long moment, letting every single argument that they had against one another melt away.
Tony belly crawled toward Batroc, reaching for Steve’s belt and grabbing the set of cuffs off it, since it was closer. Steve felt the fumble by his rear and blushed profusely, clearing his throat to brush those thoughts to one side, satisfied when he heard the click of handcuffs after Tony had restrained Batrocs wrists together.
The bot was taken aback, grabbing the dark tufts of hair between its fingers ever so gently at first before yanking him back. “You are making me do this. Humans are imperfect. You will be perfect. You had made me to be perfect, and you shall be too.”
“Tony...” He said, shaking his head, reaching for him and pulling him lightly into his large muscular arms that were covered by the draping white fabric that seemed to glow. Tony felt his heart sink as the familiar embrace of his friend, of his partner was felt around him, providing him with warmth when he was drenched with the rain that he had been walking in, that even left a small puddle by his feet.
“Not bribe… Okay, bribe. But listen, Steve, hopefully this is your ticket out of here! We can’t see if we don’t try.” He explained,
“I know Buck, we’ll try to get to it!” He said, reaching his hand up and starting to climb the moving jet, which was even harder now that his hand continued to have that tremble to it, the ringing in his ears persisting even though he’d managed to snap out of the daze, it still left that residue.
“Whoa, that was fast…” Steve turned his head toward the car, watching the bots hard at work. One of them had a spray can, going back and forth with a hot rod red, another attached a huge spoiler to it – it hardly looked like the same car at all by this point. It didn’t even look police regulation; Steve was actually unsure whether ‘car 616’ would ever be able to sit in the police car park again without standing out like a sore thumb. “Uh, Tony, I’m not sure we can ride that…”
“Oh say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light!” Hammer sang with a tone deaf voice that made Steve cringe.
The director lowered the folders he held extremely slowly, unsure if he was just becoming delusional from all the stress he was under, but he could’ve sworn that he noticed Steve’s hand move. Was it possible that he was waking up after the wires were pulled, that soon?
He grit his teeth, his body numb, nothing but rage in his mind. “Arrh!” Tony screamed, pushing himself up on the single ankle he had left, throwing his body with every last ounce of strength and grabbing Norman, pulling him to the ground and beating him, over and over. Tony was blinded by rage and offence.
Thankfully, he came back to life, like a miracle, like an angel and he could only hope the same for everyone he had buried ever since. Every time he would shut his eyes at a funeral he wouldn’t pray, he wasn’t religious – more agnostic, but that wouldn’t stop him from hoping that the same miracle would happen and that they would live again. Even now when he shut his eyes, it wasn’t only Jessica he hoped for. He’d hoped for everyone around him, all of his fallen toy soldiers and even the man who he couldn’t see amongst them… Captain America.
The man in the hot-rod red suit shot a repulsor ray straight at the large bald man, “Ever heard of not manhandling someone like that, chrome dome!”
“It’s a start,” Tony finished, ushering the Fantastic Four to show off his and Steve’s personalised floor filled with joy, and unable to explain how happy he was that they had built that room together. That they had built themselves a home again, and it would always be
“Good boy!” Tony praised him, running up to the switch and holding it up. “So this controls the robots in the city, huh?”
Janet flew in, and used her stinger, throwing all she had at the bots that were beginning to cluster in the foyer, using her size to float behind them and aim for their circuit board.
Steve then walks in with a dozen bags in his hands, barely able to see over the top of them. He tries to place them down as carefully as he could, and with that wobble of the top of the bag, Tony takes it as his cue to run toward the man like a puppy expecting treats. He ran up to the man and helped him with a few of the bags, doing a sweep of the room before he places a gentle peck to Steve’s cheek.
“Don’t do this.” Steve said, in a softer tone, though every time he spoke it seemed as though his voice was echoing.
Either way, Tony looked rather dapper with his hair out, strands delicately and carefully placed and styled to perfection, walking around with Steve proudly and showing him all that he knew about art. It came a surprise to Steve that Tony knew as much as he did, but then again he was a genius. Tony appreciated the finer things in life, beauty was one of them, and art was beauty. Upon finding out that Steve was an artist it had become his prerogative to show him the galleries of New York.
“Tony, I’m… I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you, I’m sorry.” Steve said, proceeding to resume his position that he was in, resting his chin on Tony’s shoulder and hugging him tightly, feeling no protest from the man he held in his arms.
He was a maniac. Absolutely insane, that bone chilling laugh was something that would echo throughout the chasms of Tony’s mind for the rest of his life, he was sure of that. It was difficult to hear at points considering all of the machinery around him had come back to life after years of being dormant; huffs of steam exhaling from the small pipes, the conveyer belts moving with loud gears grinding underneath them – all but one belt, and that was the one that Tony was strapped on.
“Sir…” Maria attempted to say, but never before had she heard his voice so strong and filled with conviction.
He pushed himself up and kicked Tony’s side, watching the man roll to his side in a slump, relentless booting his spine over and over. Tony’s eyes shut and he cursed.
The alarms in the house began to sound and both Tony and Steve turned their heads in tandem toward the speaker, Steve hobbling toward it with Tony clutching Steve’s arm at the time as he reached for the speaker, or tried to, realising it was too high up.
Reed was close-by, having not heard the soldier respond until now. His eyes lifted from his notepad and he stared over Tony’s shoulder, resisting the urge to stretch his neck for a closer examination, but even he knew that would probably receive a slap in the face from Tony.
The praise made his cheeks glow red, lowering the visor on his hat and lifting his palms to face where the lasers seemed to spawn from, quietly whispering the command before the cyan shots flew out of his palms and destroyed each one, leaving them with a clear path.
Tony was just about to open his mouth when a man burst through the doors; if he used a little more force he probably would’ve broken the handle. “Anthony!” He yelled, “What are you doing? Why are you talking so loudly?!”
That was when Tony’s internal alarm bells began to ring and he’d managed to speed up the process. The most important part of it all was that he had to clear his mind and focus, just as Steve had taught him in their sparring lessons back when Steve didn’t even know that he and Iron Man were the same person, the blissful old days where ironically things were much simpler, even if it meant being two separate people. The catch of Steve’s word made him spin around once he was done with Zola and he flew toward Steve, kicking and repulsoring any other creatures that decide to obstruct him. It was like a video game and he was finally getting the hang of the controls and knowing exactly where these things would spawn from, luckily though there wasn’t an unlimited number of them, so after he managed to finish the final few that hurled themselves in front of him he landed just in front of Steve.
“Steve!” He cried. “Steve, oh Steve. Captain… Love… Darling!” A flurry of muddled words poured from his mouth as his body was filled with the deep heat of Steve lighting a flame inside him.
Steve opened his eyes, letting them adjust to the light, but seeing a dark shadow behind Tony rise taller, before spotting the menacing yellow narrowed slits. “Tony!” In that split second Tony was plucked from his arms, the metal red hand reaching for Steve and slipping out of his grip, just as Bucky had. Time slowed, he watched him get pulled away, get torn out of his classic armour like an oyster from a shell, and then away, crashing through the ceiling and out of the mansion roof.
Meanwhile, Steve just seemed to just hold him, his eyes glowing faintly in the dim light and Tony stared at him with confusion. He seemed to be in a trance of some sort, and then suddenly he pulled back with a gasp. Moving his hands away from Tony’s back but his wings fluttering out and then curling around Tony once more. “Tony… Tony I…” He stuttered, leaning down and pulling him into an even tighter embrace than before, his face resting against Tony’s, rubbing their cheeks together. “Tony I’m so sorry… I’m sorry…”
Tony picked up a relatively large slab of concrete that had fallen from the ceiling and with the help of his enhanced arm, he had managed to use that to create a bridge – he then had to repeat, grabbing more and more slabs, anything he could find that wouldn’t catch fire and threw them on top of the other, forming a small path.
birthday party made him open a seemingly empty can and a spring-snake popped out and scared him so much that he fell over and started crying.
Tony’s eyes once more saddened at the sight of it, and then reached down; removing Steve’s other boot cover, and then his other gauntlet. He sighed heavily and found that the more he was discovering the more grief it caused. There was hesitance in his action when he reached for the edge of Steve’s shirt, but the super soldier nodded, giving him his consent. He rolled up the familiar, star spangled uniform to see that most of his torso was covered in the metal plating, with a giant star shaped reactor in the centre, but the metal was somewhat transparent and it was strange; instead of wiring Tony could see a fusion of circuitry and clockwork wheels. He’d become a clockwork soldier.
“Norman you scum…!” He yelled with venom. “Let me see your god damn face!” His stare incredulous as he yanked the mask up, only to see another man’s face. That wasn’t Norman… It definitely wasn’t Norman. Filled with shock, that boiling sickness and acidic taste in his mouth once again began to rise up his oesophagus.
“This stupid radio stopped working Tony, since when have you started making shoddy tech?” She frowned, leaning on him as he helped her get out of there with Steve following close behind with Hank draped in his arms.
“Tony you’re better than this. You need to be strong, you need to keep going and lead now that I’m not around to...”
“Any time, Tony.” Steve smiled briefly, his hand brushing by the back of his head. Perhaps the Captain was more self-conscious than he had thought, clearing his throat afterwards in subtle embarrassment.
“Tony!” Janet called when Sue, Reed, Ben and Johnny had shown up to join the celebrations. “Tony! Come on, he’s
He had held both repulsors out, and kicked open the door with powerful force. His lights guided his path, even as nervous as he was to see an enemy he hadn’t seen in so long. To be honest, the thought of Hammer sent chills down his spine, the man was always so obnoxious, so twisted and insisted in constant low blows. Unfortunately, dealing with someone who called themselves ‘smart’ often meant that they would think outside the box, which was far more troublesome to predict, even with Tony’s simulator software giving him odds and statistics in the corner of the HUB display on his internal monitors. The eyeslits he was peering out of also lit his path as he stepped further into the dormant factory. He didn’t know why on Earth he should be nervous about this plan given that Hammer was inferior to himself in terms of intellect, it was the unpredictability and uncertainty that came along with it. But Tony reminded himself it was only Hammer he was dealing with, so there was no reason to be scared. Instead he held his head high and continued with renewed confidence.
He had to snap out of a daze, shaking his head a little. “Y-yeah, I got it…” He clutched Steve a little harder, leaning on him.
Tony’s eyes sharply widened, though it shouldn’t have surprised him in the slightest. Of course his augmentations has the ‘Oscorp’ logo and not any of the other ‘evil scientists’ – this whole thing was an Oscorp system. Which begged the question, what happened to everyone else? Tony’s eyes were fixed on the scrollbar as he typed in a couple of commands with Steve observing his movements carefully.
Tony rolled his hips, arched his lower back and shut his eyes again, moaning close to Steve’s skin, moving to press his lips to the super soldiers neck and try and muffle his sounds with the others warm skin.
“Let’s get this show on the road,” Steve said in the same style Tony would usually, to get him back into the mood. The small gesture didn’t go unnoticed; it made the worry fade a fraction from Tony’s features; a smile tugging at the corner of his lips as he took to the passenger’s seat. JARVIS barked happily, his tail extending into some sort of wire and plugging into the car, all Steve could do was watch as the car came to life – blue lights flashing around the complicated screens that popped up and decorated the windshield.
Stepping out of the Chief’s office with the paper in his hand, Steve walked down the stairs, frowning even more than before at the white sheet. Though it was a relief to be out of that room, at least he could breathe in fresh clean air; well, air tainted with the smell of freshly ground coffee in this case.
“This has been happening since we found him sir, what we were afraid of. The Post Traumatic Stress causes—“
Steve grabs a tuft of Tony’s hair, in the way that he loves to do, and curls it around his finger, trying to tug the man toward him. Now, Steve wasn’t one for public affection unless it was a special day, which was a pleasant reminder for Tony that it was indeed, a very special day.
“Tony, tell me what’s wrong? It’s that suit, isn’t it?” He turned to the empty suit of armour. “Rhodey told me to keep an eye on it, he said it wasn’t right. Is that why you… It wasn’t you that punched me, was it?”
“Currently in the mansion, not got much time by the sounds of the connection. Have you managed to get in touch with the others?”
Carefully he hooked his other arm under Tony’s thigh, the other two agile fingers easing their way through the wall of tensed muscle, with Tony releasing staggered moans that raised an octave with every inch further he went, being slow, caressing and gentle. It was still strange and extremely invasive, to feel someone pushing that deeply into him. Tony’s back twisted awkwardly only for Steve to hush him with soft murmurs.
Tony couldn’t help but laugh, he didn’t know if the lack of sleep was making him imagine things, but this just seemed stupid. He was never the religious type, nor had he ever been. He was raised in a home where science
One day he sat, with his large white wings curled around him, huddled up with his knees to his chest as a large opening was formed in the clouds; a bright light which caused him to stand to his feet, staring at it with his wide blue eyes in awe. Was this his time? Was he finally going to be accepted into the host? What about this angel he was supposed to get?
“Not just a model plane, it’s the only one left of its kind!” Tony is keen to point out. “You know how much that’s worth? Probably half a grand… Worth it though, he’s my best friend. I can’t wait to see the look on his face.”
“You have no idea who you’re talking to... Now tell me. Tell me!” Tony’s voice raised an octave every time he yelled, sneering.
Steve's finally woken up, with the thought of being an angel in his dreams but he realises soon enough that it isn't a dream, and finally finds the angel he thinks he was meant to retrieve.
“You gotta have connections. But the time for submitting was over, it was like an amnesty when this thing with the bombs and the chips first started.”
“Don’t call me director…” He grumbled. “I hate that job… God damn admin work all the time, you know how much red tape I have to go through, even in my position?”
“Why can’t I enter?” Steve asked, after hours, days, weeks of waiting, he would ask the same question over and over.
