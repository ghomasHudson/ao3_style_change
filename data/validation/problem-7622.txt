So he practiced, punched until sweat was dripping down the side of his face, drenching his t-shirt. He practiced his kicks; roundhouse, side-kick, crescent kick, which made his lower back twinge until he repeated the motion on both legs, forty times each. He did sequences, his body sinking into the familiar actions until all thought vanished from his mind save for the intense awareness of his muscles, the minute corrections in trajectory and the lessening or arching of angles when necessary.
And maybe that was always his problem. That he
In Stark he saw…
Bucky had taken this all in with the deceptively casual observance of a Winter Soldier’s training. If this was his first time seeing them, the bots probably didn’t typically have the run of the Compound, and there had been the offhanded mention of how Stark liked to hole herself up in her workshop for days - which he was beginning to suspect wasn’t actually an exaggeration.
He’d thought that out of all of them she would’ve been one of the first to come, if only for her informally appointed role as referee and middleman to their two very obvious groups.
He smirked and sent her a decidedly obnoxious wink.
Vision draped yet another blanket around her violently trembling shoulders.
“Oh,” she whispered, then shook her head. “I thought you knew-
“Wait,” he interrupted, his voice sounding like gravel in his own ears, so rough that even Shuri looked at him curiously, momentarily brought out of her ramblings. “
Countless faces, opponents, appeared before him: people whom he’d beaten, a few he’d lost against for some reason or another. Eventually Ayo stepped in, jerking her head towards the mat and swiftly stepping in as his partner. She was an excellent fighter, her movements rapid and her hits quick and snakelike. She may not have had his strength, but she made up for it by going for his balance, getting the drop on him more than once.
. But Toni, who knew about guilt, who knew about
knew, what the answer was going to be. The knowledge that Sam thought the same felt unbelievably like relief, at odds with everything he knew and everything he wanted.
“Whatever your decision, you’re not alone in this, Toni. If you bring him on board we will do exactly what we said we would do. We will take care of our own.”
Toni, of course, refused to let fourteen hours of intensive surgery drag her to the bedroom for much needed rest in spite of how her back and feet ached in protest.
what to do. Not the rest of it, not the big things, the milestone things, not yet. But this...
Sam opened his mouth, closed it, then nodded. “Waffles sound great. Thanks Mrs—”
There was a strange detachment to her speech, as if she was talking,
Agent Fern’s spine straightened even more if that was possible and Steve couldn’t help but picture Toni’s fond amusement at the good little soldier routine.
“Good evening, Toni,” he said, and the exhaustion in his voice carried clear across the speakers. “How are you?”
One moment she was silently cursing herself for being unable to do anything and the next she had an armful of sobbing child, squeezing the life out of her lungs. She hesitated only briefly before wrapping her arms around him, letting him cry into her neck and get all his tears and snot and probably saliva all over her.
His hold on her softened and his eyes were sad and disapproving and she felt like a child being berated for doing something she
“She gonna make it?”
Steve closed his eyes and just breathed.
And she had been unkind and he had not deserved it.
That really shouldn’t have affected her as much as it did but her heart jumped inside her chest, something warm and soft curling behind her ribcage. And Toni didn’t really know what to say to that as color crawled its way up her neck until neither she nor Shuri were able to meet one another’s gaze and poor Peter just looked even more confused and maybe a little embarrassed being witness to whatever
Toni felt it before the hiss of the door met her ears. She felt it in the way the air felt colder, a gust of northerly wind pushing its way into her lungs once more. She felt it as the fine hairs on the back of her neck stood on end and the invisible weight of a

Her hands were shaking and she was pretty sure she was going to pass out.
“Then
because he had—
The only one whose voice he couldn’t hear was Steve’s, and a furtive glance through the corner of his eye told Bucky that Steve hadn’t move an inch. There was strain in his expression and Bucky suspected that his fingers were digging into his forearms but no words left his mouth.
“So why are you letting your sister beat up our fearless leader in the middle of the hot Wakandan sun?”
A second later there was a socket wrench flying towards his face, someone - Steve - had shouted,
“He put himself in an underwater prison and left his family,” came her somber reply, but Toni could tell it wasn’t deeply felt. Call it favoritism or years of rooted friendship but in this regard at least, Barton would always be a weak spot. She didn’t outright blame Toni, though, which was something.
“Well,” she breathed, lifting the arm once more. “Look at you.”
“Toni,” Vision called without turning around, “I believe Dummy is attempting to intimidate your patient.”
tech,” she continued with a confidence that never once came close to arrogance, “is undeniably superior and the components far less invasive. The neural interface is also a lot more sensitive so you’ll know almost immediately if anything starts to feel wrong with the arm once Toni has installed it. And we’ll also be doing continued maintenance checks to make sure it remains compatible with your body.” She set down her tablet and fixed Bucky with a reassuring look. “It’s a long procedure but Toni, Shuri and I have gone over it countless times and my team and I have been on the forefront of medical advancement for years, so you’re in good hands, Sergeant Barnes, I can promise you that.”
“Hey, Laura,” he whispered.
The name
A shield over her head.

T’Challa caught her around the middle before she could go after him, fury and worry written in the furrow of her brows and her downturned mouth.
He heaved a heavy, agitated sigh. “Yes.
and his neck felt hot and cold, his palms clammy -
There was very literally chaos in the streets because taking out all the traffic lights within a five-mile radius in during lunch-hour rush would do that. Natasha had already gotten the okay from the Panel while squeezing herself into a suit and Toni received a call from the mayor herself so they were a go all around.
“I’m on site now!” he interrupted. “Boss, there’s Spider-Man’s webbing all over the-!”
or disagreements arise, they will be handled far better than last time.”
Things she might be able to fix.
She’d wanted to protect him. And yet circumstances took that away as well.
They weren’t okay. They wouldn’t be okay for a while, yet. But she and Nat had woven something relatively stable for the time being. Not a friendship; there was too much hurt and distrust for that yet, but it was
She inhaled deeply, held the breath and looked straight ahead where Ellis was sat, expressionless as ever.
Steve took one step towards the door, surprise and confusion jerking his movements.
He knew she did. He may not like it and he may never agree with it but he knew
“They did,” Nat carefully supplied. On the TV, Captain Kirk had a few hundred tribbles fall onto his head. “It’s all in there.”
“I’ll pay you back; might take a few years, though,” he joked as War Machine smashed through the side of the building.
Toni gave him a grateful, if small smile, and rose unsteadily to her feet. “FRIDAY, call in and book out the restaurant for me, honey.”
“For real.”
to be worth it.
,” and just stayed there with him, allowing herself this moment to just sit in the company of someone she loved and whom she thought maybe, in his own way, loved her back.
Licking his dry lips, he met Shuri’s eyes, pleased that her earlier wariness had worn off and was now replaced with genuine curiosity.
Laura smiled. “It was my pleasure.”
Afterwards she’d come to Toni and demanded a new set of widow bites.

“I would say that what you are doing now proves otherwise.”
They sat there for a while, shoulder to shoulder, talking about nothing in particular. There was a restlessness to Steve, evident in the dart of his eyes from one corner of the room to the next, the tense and release of his shoulders, the crossing and uncrossing of his arms.
“You say the word and I’m gone. You call the shots around here.”
“Fuck,” she cursed, as one of the panels on his arm started to smoke. "
want to hurt people so this,” she said, gesturing with one hand, “is for them. And not even
The hair-raising sound of cutlery across ceramic startled the buzz out of her ears. Toni blinked at her hand, which was almost bloodless as it gripped her fork. Her peas were scattered off the plate and on the tartan tablecloth.
Wanda was sat on one of the benches, worrying the hem of her gray top and darting looks at Vision, who was deep in conversation with Doctor Strange. Steve had yet to formally meet the supposed sorcerer, and other than a one-sided conversation with Vision when he’d dropped him and Bucky at their quarters, he’d had little to no contact with the rest of them. Clint sat on the opposite end with his back against the wall and his legs stretched out on the bench as he spun a drumstick between his fingers. He hadn’t seen Scott much lately, too preoccupied with his daughter and Hope Van Dyne as he must’ve been, though the latter Steve wasn’t entirely certain about if the badly concealed bruise Scott was sporting on the bridge of his nose was anything to go by.
She turned to look at Sam and found him looking grimly back at her. And by some unspoken truce, Toni slipped off the stool and Sam started rolling up the sleeves of his t-shirt.
Lots of conditions. The world wasn’t happy. Not with the Avengers, not with Rogers, not with

Vision, for his part, looked
as she called them. Butterfingers, he discovered, was just as if not more suspicious of him than Dummy was, his camera zooming in on him threateningly before Stark - fondly - shooed him away and told him to play something called Mega Jenga with Dummy. There had been a moment of puzzling confusion when a bot called You had rolled up to Stark and proceeded to beep at her in a soft, cooing sort of way that drew Bucky to the conclusion that You might have been intended to be female.
In her mind’s eye she could see the man who had managed to change her more in those three months than most people had deigned to take the time to. She could see Yinsen and his gentle hands, his soft, forgiving eyes as he asked her not to waste her life. The second chance that he had given her.

Shuri sneered in disbelief. “You were

And while Steve believed to the very core of his soul that Bucky hadn’t had a choice, that
When he looked back on it, though, Steve hadn’t really given Bucky a choice in the end.
“Are they not?”
She would see the way his eyes bore right back into hers, unwilling to look away, determined to hold her gaze so she could see
. No one knew about Siberia save for her, T’Challa, Cap and Barnes. And
The only one who seemed upbeat, fondly enough, was Peter, who was practically bouncing on the spot.
“Yeah,” she said. “Must’ve been then.”
It was the most honest thing she’d said to Natasha in the aftermath of dust and frayed, bloody nails and a cold so deep it was as if she was made of snow.
.” He looked at her, then, something warring in his pale blue-grey eyes. “And she said that you’d seen it.”
.” He flashed her a grin, thinking about all those days training out in the heat until the Dora and the sun tempered his body into something new, something rougher.
“Ye-es,” he said slowly, his muddled brain taking a bit longer to connect the dots. And then it came to him.
“I’m fine. Just restless. Been sitting too long,” she muttered instinctively, blinking rapidly. Her eyes felt so goddamn dry. “Wish every country were as reasonable as Nigeria,” she said, changing the subject because world-changing Council meeting and all and this shit was important. “Egypt was being a real asshole just now.”
He set the mug down and looked up; Sam was sat opposite him with an arched brow.
to the
Bucky felt the corners of his mouth lift slightly. “Yeah. See you in a bit.”
Except...except no. No he wouldn’t.
He frowned. “You think…”
“No.” She shook her head of blonde hair. “It really wasn’t.” And now they weren’t just talking about Ross and her frankly untenable so-called reputation. She would’ve preferred if they’d stayed on that topic.
T’Challa was silent and she didn’t blame him for that, for the inability to give her words of comfort and reassurance, because there were none. There was nothing that could possibly make this moment of resentment okay.
“How’d you know about the others?”
Behind her, Helen was smiling beneath her mask, a sheen of exhaustion on her forehead but the dermal regenerator in one hand, held in quiet triumph like the Rod of Asclepius.
“And you, Spiderling? You gonna go tear up my lawn?”
Laura woke, disoriented, squinting into the brightness of the room and blinking rapidly. For a moment she thought it was already morning and was then confused when she looked out the window and saw the sky still dark.
She still didn’t look up at him.
“FRIDAY,” he sighed, exasperated.
“They are not exactly in the best position to be making grand changes,” he chided, “but they do not, as you seem to believe, sit around and do nothing. The Captain trains with the Dora. As does Mr. Wilson and Mr. Barton. They learn about our culture and they help where they can. They help protect our borders from…unsavory people. Mr Barton even has a small following of children and young people who are eager to learn archery. Ms. Maximoff helps in the orphanage and Mr. Lang has taken up a temporary teaching post at a high school.” Through the entire speech Toni just found her shoulders getting heavier and heavier. “They are doing what they can, Ms. Stark, within the limited capacity that their situation has given them. But they do want to come home. They are still healing from the loss of it.”
“Yes you can,” she argued weakly and he chuckled, swiping an eyelash off the curve of her cheekbone.
So why couldn’t he ever just
Her eyes were drawn to the corner of the room, where an unfinished suit of red and slate blue-gray was draped across a table.
“The harder it’s gonna be,” he finished, looking at her. “I know.”
She mustered a kind smile anyway. “Princess Shuri. It’s a pleasure.”

“From what I can ascertain from Roxxon’s files, only one of their more recent inventions has the highest level of encryption and over seventy terabytes worth of documentation. It is some form of energy containment field-generator, not dissimilar to the casing of your older arc reactors. I am transmitting the information to the Compound now for later analysis.”
It was a warm night and Toni’s bare feet sank into the dewy grass. It was a beautiful place, so far away from everything else, secluded in a way that could almost remind her of the Barton farm were it not for the city light glow she could see over the treetops and the fact that she could actually

The question came seemingly out of nowhere, jolting Toni from her intense focus of going through the shoulder plate’s internal circuitry just

Toni opened her mouth, closed it, then turned and frowned at Hope, feeling thrown for a loop.
He came around to perch on the edge of her work table, trying not to make his disapproval at her evidently sleep-deprived state so obvious.
Toni just about had a fit but managed to maintain at least a decent level of composure, even as her body was practically
The man laughed, low and lazy. “Easier to come by than you think.” Then his eyes rolled towards the one-way mirror, meeting Toni’s gaze with impossible precision. “You’ve got one right here, don’t you?”
“Ellis has announced the pardons, hasn’t he?” she asked, her eyes catching the brief flash of a falling star.
.” And here he paused and Nat observed him carefully, taking in the subtle incline to his chin and the hard set of his expression. “I believe we all know what the outcome will be. We have worked tirelessly over the past months and I believe this final hearing is more of a...formality. A PR strategy by the Council. Do you agree, Ms. Romanov?”
“I shall redirect this conversation to the question I had intended to ask earlier. Do you trust Natasha Romanov’s presence in the Compound? If you have any reservations as to her intentions I will be more than willing to monitor her activities.”
“Sleep in tomorrow. You deserve it.”

Winter frost crept up the corner of the glass. The lawn below glittered with ice and the sky overhead was a glorious if distant blue, cold and unfeeling. It was supposed to snow later that night, she knew. First snow of winter. She dreaded it a little, the cold. The snow. The gray. Even indoors with the temperature perfectly regulated, her lungs constricted as if she was still breathing in that Siberian air.
He shook his head and took a long drink out of her mug of hot chocolate without asking. “We lost their trail at the river and the machine with it. SHIELD’s got eyes out but I dunno, man.”

her entire body in what she assumed was supposed to be a delighted hug.
“Any second now, Boss.”
Just before the police took him away, Toomes managed to break free of the restraints and grab Toni by the front of her t-shirt and hissed something in her face before T’Challa could intervene.
It was beautiful and so, so different from what HYDRA had forced on him. There was a sleekness to it, the grooves between each panel thinner so that it would look like seamless metal from afar.
Also what did you guys think about Ayo? I love the Dora Milaje so much and Ayo's "Move. Or you will be moved" in CACW was one of the BEST things I've ver seen. That woman takes no shit. I'm kind of disappointed she didn't get much of a speaking role in Black Panther but hey, we got to see Okoye kick ass, so that was cool. ❤
His eyebrows arched in what was perhaps amusement and she suddenly felt very self-conscious.
it. She thought she’d done that what with the training period and unlocking all the extras as he progressed and improved.
“This is familiar, isn’t it?” she asked as the taste of wheatgrass and pineapple slipped down her throat, the flavor muted by the memory of her and T’Challa seated at a restaurant months and months ago, while Toni stirred the foam of her fruit juice and laid all her scathing baggage bare before him.
“But I am not going to be like you,” she whispered with a fire that was so like her brother’s and yet so uniquely and beautifully different. It was a conviction, a truth branded into her very bones. “I’m smarter than you. I’m going to be
Her lips twitched marginally. She’d never gotten the chance to use Protocol GTFO but while the image of a fire-extinguisher-brandishing Dummy attacking Maria hill was funny in her head, the chance that Maria might just point her gun at him was decidedly
“I have been well.” Toni couldn’t help but notice how unsure he sounded, in a way that he hadn’t for so long, as if he was asking her permission for something that she couldn’t grasp. “I have been accompanying Colonel Rhodes to physical therapy three times a week.” Toni suppressed a flinch; that was one thing she should’ve been doing from the very beginning. “The bots are well; they have been asking after you. As has FRIDAY,” he added as an afterthought, his expression curiously blank.
Toni shook her head. “Rhodey has enough to deal with and Pepper is running a company.” But it sounded like a flimsy excuse to her own ears and Hope knew that. “Look,” she sighed, “there just...there’s just never a good time. Rhodey and Pep know, hell,
Or maybe Vision knew that she knew and just didn’t care.
He sighed softly, elbows resting on his knees as he gazed, unseeing at the floor, cursing himself at how easily his thoughts always strayed towards Toni. Toni and that stupid letter and that stupid phone.
“Totally. That’s how it works, right?” She gestured vaguely, which was hard to do because T’Challa didn’t seem in a hurry to give her hands back. Maybe he was worried she was about to literally fly off the handle or run away. It wouldn’t be the first time. “Democracy and…everything.”
“Think I’ll pass for now,” she said quietly, scratching her sternum through the thick sweater Vision had knitted for her a couple of weeks ago. He was such an old man sometimes.
And in that moment Nat felt her awareness sharpen to a pinpoint and all her skills emerge just below the surface of her skin,
At one time Toni might even have taken pity on him and inserted a joke, a tease here or there, just to make him loosen up a little.
-then looked away.
“Isn’t it?” Her gaze locked with Rhodey’s and they just looked at one another for a long moment, an entire book of things that didn’t need to be spoken passing between them at the point of contact.
“Let’s try this again.” She scratched the skin around the arc reactor and looked directly into Natasha’s face. “Why are you here, Natasha?”
In the end the Council promised the look deeper into the Accords and more than one Panel head agreed that some of the issues highlighted with them needed to be addressed sooner rather than later.
of his best friend. Bucky didn’t know whether that was because he’d never quite got over Steve’s change or whether it had to do with his HYDRA-blended memories.
“Nanobots,” she said with a grin over her shoulder and Kamala patted Butterfingers’ visual input unit and pressed a kiss to it in what Toni thought was the sweetest gesture
“Kamala Khan. Fifteen. Pakistani. She was exposed to some kind of mist. I’d normally say a biological weapon but there were others in the vicinity and she’s the only report according to FRIDAY.”
“Captain Rogers indicated in his letter that Toni should call only if she needed him.” Vision cocked his head to the side a couple degrees in an approximation of a shrug. “We have not needed him.”
“Nice work,” Rhodey snapped professionally as they were coming up on the damage. “Me and Spider-Man’ll take those trapped either side. Iron Man’ll relay scans of the buildings to us and keep them from coming down with us inside. Vision you take Roxxon with Wasp, Widow and Panther. We need to know who these people are and what they’re looking for.”
“Your own concoction?”
“Mm...m’ fifteeeeen.”
But HYDRA didn’t need to know that, she thought darkly.
“He’s such an asshole,” she muttered, then automatically pouted her lips when Natasha began dabbing lipstick onto it.

Hope chuckled self-deprecatingly. “Yeah. I wasn’t angry at you,” she admitted. “I mean I guess I was a little but...when I read the Accords I knew why you signed them. And seeing everything you guys did about the Accords
When Ellis smiled there was no mirth.
Nat nodded and just like that, turned the whole thing into a training session. “See his shoulders? Totally relaxed. He’s not rushed. He’s acting like he has all the time in the world.”
“What the hell are you even doing in New York? Where’s your mother?” she asked as they carried Kamala into one of the elevators. “Goddamnit, I need a damn travelator in this fucking place.”
“Nat?”
Steve stared at Bucky for a long moment before finally speaking.
arm - with a slow smile tickling the edges of her mouth, something wondrous and awed in her expression as if it wasn’t the work of her own hands.
“Why do you hate him so much?”
Toni nodded as if by rote. “Because you wanted to fix the Accords.”
When she was done, Toni hesitated only for a moment before picking the girl up - and fuck but kids were heavier than she realized - and put her back into bed. As she’d exited the room again, leaving it slightly ajar, the way she’d learned the girl preferred, she thought she heard Laura’s bedroom door click shut.
She smiled despite herself. “You seem to do well enough.”
“—didn’t think to mention this before?”
And just like that, sensation
“I cannot make you a princess or a queen,” he said finally, and she almost spoke up and told him that she was

Steve was with Bucky, Sam, Nat and Wanda when FRIDAY’s call came.
Ackerman regarded her over the rim of her glasses. “By that comparison
Toni pressed her lips together and squinted at Shuri’s morose form, torn between amusement and concern. “I could say
And I get it. I’d’ve done the same. But
They’d have to deal with that sooner rather than later.
Vision made a soft sound that might have been exasperation. “Of course, Toni.”
And so her days went on this quiet piece of land, so far away from everything that she knew.
“Maybe you should try meditating.”
“You pretentious white boys should praise and fear my glorious IQ. My very existence should be an affront to your sensibilities,” she’d said once and Steve had laughed and laughed and laughed. When she’d indignantly asked him why he was laughing he had told her, tears of mirth - and perhaps something else - leaking out of the corners of his eyes,
The next morning she did it all over again. And the day after that. And the day after that.
towards an inquiry into Wakanda’s international dealings.
“Special,” Vision finished for her.
“Then I go back to the drawing board and start this from scratch,” she told him simply. “And if you decide you don’t want
It was like something melted inside of her and her muscles noticeably relaxed, the cold that had been seeping into her extremities retracting with a strangely familiar kind of warmth. Something pulsed beneath her sternum and her gaze landed briefly on the amulet around his neck before she raised her eyes and met his uncertain expression.
“Are you really...Toni...Stark...Iron Mmmm…” she slurred and Toni spared her a quick, if panicked smile.
He looked at Toni, her spine ramrod straight as she stood by Bucky’s bed, her hands clasped tightly in front of her.
“Don’t be dense. Toni Stark has been very vocal about your friends’ detainments without trials. You would get a trial. And if not you would find some way to keep your friends safe while being a vigilante as a huge gesture of defiance to the world.” She looked down her nose at him despite being slightly shorter. “It wouldn’t be the first time.”
He knew it too.
A cold breeze filtered through the doorway of the shed and for a moment all she could see was white and the solid dark grey of a bunker. The air burned her lungs, made it hard to move. She reached out with one gauntlet for the shield.
She pretended not to watch as he reached for the plate with scarred, trembling hands and proceeded to serve himself. She’d read his file, knew about the car crash and the months thereafter where he practically drove himself into bankruptcy then disappeared off the face of the planet.
He reached out and touched her wrist, gratified to see the way her nervous energy seemed to subside beneath his palm.
“If we’re talking for the good of mankind, the latter, obviously.”
A loud banging on the door snapped them both out of their reverie.
“So these are your digs,” she observed as they walked around the courtyard where he’d first fought with Shuri all those months ago. It felt like a lifetime. “Pretty sweet for an international fugitive.”
Helen nodded. “The dermal regenerator should do the trick and his healing will cover the rest as best as it can.”
He seemed to have forgotten that she’d taught him everything he knew so she was completely aware that she was being watched.
He looked down at her, surprised. “You initiated the Clean Slate Protocol?”
You better get on that fast! I’m detecting another bomb-”
“It’ll stop you from dreaming.”

Toni had been tempted. Of

Inside of her.
Again, this fic is un-betaed, so regardless of how many times I read this there will probably be some very obvious mistakes that my sleep-deprived brain is incapable of catching, so I do apologize!
Toni’s life settled into a new routine at the Barton farm. Once she’d relayed all her existing ideas to Laura, she found an adept sounding board, who tossed questions back just as quickly as Toni answered them. She even offered ideas of her own. Once Toni had pulled up the Accords with her first series of amendments and notes, Laura had immersed herself in it, adding comments and propositions in far better script than Toni’s chicken scratches.
“See that, guys?” she’d told them, patting You’s CPU casing. “That’s Peter Parker. You’re gonna meet him soon, I hope.”
of all of you kids and I’m so proud of
Toni snorted, stirring her spoon in her empty coffee mug. “With Barton around? Doubt it’s gonna remain unspoken for very long.” When she sensed Nat’s mood dip further, she reached out and patted her awkwardly on the arm. “Hey, if anyone can get through Hawkeye’s dense skull it’s you. You didn’t lock him up in an underwater prison and keep him from his family. Dude’ll listen to you.”
After a moment her expression hardened, her gaze darting quickly from the arm to the 3D chart she had conjured up to her right.
Oh and one final thing. I'M GOING TO WATCH AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR ON WEDNESDAY AND I AM NOT READY. *screams into the void*

A plume of emotions unraveled inside of his chest, pulling his thoughts in different directions and stealing the words from his mouth.
About half a minute later he lowered his hands, the glow disappearing, then turned around and looked at her, a troubled furrow between his brows.
There was a round of abruptly-muttered approvals with an undercurrent of electric tension that was hardly present in the old team and

The word echoed in his ears and through his body and in all the parts of himself that had hollowed since leaving Toni in that godforsaken bunker.
“Barnes,” she called, her voice sounding far away.
“—not such a good idea until we can come up with something safe—”
“Stevie,” Bucky said quietly, “C’mon. It’s fine. Just leave it.”
Toni met her gaze unflinchingly,
“We’ll be ready when you are.”
“What’s that you’re working on?” Kamala asked from where she was playing tic-tac-toe with Butterfingers.
Steve strode over and enveloped his friend in a hug and Bucky, after a couple of seconds, returned it with his one flesh arm.
It was tense and ready, postured and stern. But it was also a man frightened, a man helpless, a man physically attempting to hold the unravelling parts of himself together.
“that’s not what I—”
“I thought the title was rather clever. Very tongue-in-cheek. Boss made me install about ten levels of Stark-grade security on it to ensure nobody could plagiarize it before it was published. But that’s another matter.” FRIDAY paused and Laura could almost imagine the woman - probably a red-head, dark red as opposed to ginger - clearing her throat. “I truly apologize for frightening you, Mrs. Barton, but this is of the utmost importance. Boss hasn’t made contact with me since she locked me out of every single piece of tech she brought with her and left New York. I believe it was a way for her to disconnect after what had happened in Siberia.”
Rhodey bit off his words and her heart clenched. “You left a
But Rhodey’s side of the bed was empty. The bedside clock read eleven-thirty and he was stepping out of the bathroom, freshly showered and fully dressed and limping over to the door to get his braces.
“Maybe you did not have a right to interfere in this boy’s life and pull him into a war that he had no part in,” T’Challa conceded, and Toni’s form became, if possible, even smaller, as if she were a berated child. “But what’s done is done and he is a part of this, of your life now. You owe it to him to be honest. You either take away the suit you gave him or you take responsibility for putting that burden on him in the first place and whatever decision you make, you hope for the best.”
Toni nodded encouragingly and stepped back a little, Stephen’s trembling hands hovering over hers as he started to let the power flow, generating a soft, orange warmth that she felt against her skin. As usual, his hands stilled, the tremors shuddering to a stop as his muscles visibly relaxed.
His lungs seized and he stopped breathing.
In front of them Van Dyne crossed her arms, an irritated scowl on her already stern face.
Or maybe it would something like
T’Challa smiled genially and held out his palms in an open gesture. “Come now, Captain. I have seen you fight. That type of skill takes diligent training, the like of which you haven’t had since coming to Wakanda. Surely a little light sparring with my sister will help you get back into the habit.”

“Do you remember how we first started this?” Helen asked after a time, her voice light but also curious.
“Stephen,” she said once, firmly but kind. “Helen, Shuri and I? We wanted to do this for you from the moment we saw that our tech worked for Rhodey. It was only a matter of time, really. I’m just...I’m just glad you’re in a little less pain than before. And who knows? Maybe one day we’ll even be able to make this permanent.”
Would if she could, she wanted to say. But that was a lie. She wasn’t ready for therapy. Maybe she never would be. Bruce hadn’t been that kind of doctor, as wonderful as he was, and right now she had so much on her plate that the thought of giving an extra couple of hours to something as invasive as therapy made her want to scream.
Vision surveyed her for a long moment, unreadable,
Toni pursed her lips but nodded.

Vision nodded slowly. “He either believes that HYDRA will come to rescue him or that whatever else they have planned will go smoothly with or without him. Either way he has a remarkable level of
“I have some turnips out back. Brussel sprouts and kale too. They’ll be ready for harvesting soon. I could use the help when the time comes.” Toni didn’t say anything and just sat there in the grass, waiting. “Also got an old pickup that needs some work. Clint’s been promising to fix it up for years but he never got around to it.”
Bucky gritted out, the blunt tips of his fingers digging into the flesh of his shoulder, right above the metal implant, but no one other than Steve appeared to have heard him.
“Toni, I—” he started, then stopped, shaking his head like he was berating himself. “I can’t thank you enough,” was what he settled for in the end.

So I need to fix what I can because if I don’t- And when that battle comes and we’re not ready… I couldn’t live with myself if I had the chance to fix things and I didn’t. So yeah.

“Hopefully this time, now that we are laying it all out for the world to see, people will begin to understand the importance of what we are doing,” Vision imparted, and god, he sounded like JARVIS.
She thought back to months ago, when Nat had first come back and brought up the phone and Vision - wonderful, incredible Vision - had calmly but ruthlessly struck that idea down.
Years and decades and centuries and millennia
Startled, Laura looked around for the said phone and found it lying harmlessly on the bed, below the floating white screen. She held the delicate device in her hand, the screen - what appeared to be Toni’s hefty email inbox - now hovering in front of her face.

And something that had lain quiet and patient inside of her, opened its eyes and woke up.
The surgery was apparently in two parts: the first to remove the current implant and the second to fit in the new one. After that he’d be given a few days to recover before Stark installed the arm itself.
But her features were so familiar with the expression that Bucky knew this wasn’t the first time she had smiled like this; it was just his first time seeing it.
“I knew you only liked me for my money,” she tried to joke and he arched a brow.
“It wasn’t all him,” KAREN replied with a note of amusement. “He has a friend; Ned Leeds. He’s a good kid. You’d like him.”
Things in the team’s apartment had been...strained to say the least. Lots of emotions floating around, lots of discreet looks through the corners of eyes and lots of confusion and frustration and a whole lot of
“Doctor Stark?”
“To think of everything that has happened since then,” he mused, swirling his wine around then setting his glass on whatever desk or table he was sat at, his eyes focused somewhere she wasn’t privy to.
“Natasha.” She kept her voice even, despite being phenomenally aware that all her cracks were showing.
Against her will, she felt her earlier panic subside somewhat. Across from her, Laura gave Sam a small, polite smile. She glanced at Toni, licked her lips, then stood from her seat, brushing nonexistent lint from her pajama top.
“What?” she asked slowly, setting the mugs down and pushing the sweetened one towards Toni.
And Toni’s shuddering voice still echoed in his ears, clear as a bell.
“Are you
“Wow,” Laura declared slowly, and Toni’s face heated with embarrassment, “there’s a lot more where that came from, huh?”
Because it hadn’t
Avengers on active duty, with jobs and responsibilities, and Steve and his team were in this tentative place of limbo, where they hung around waiting in anticipation for the next step, the next formality.
“Shut the fuck up, Romanov,” Toni snapped back without much heat.
But she might as well have been a hurricane.
In the corner a machine was weaving together a red and dark slate blue suit. There was already a pile of what he assumed were duds or faulty suits kicked haphazardly under another table.
“It’s cold,” she stuttered and Rhodey wordlessly took off his jacket and handed it to Vision who helped her put in on. “It’s not just me, right?”
Several emails were sent out with tentative meeting dates. The Accords were still in the first stages of amendments but it was getting on. She still needed to vet it past Rhodey, Pepper and Vision before it would be anywhere near submission-worthy, but it was going to happen. She was going to
Her mother’s voice.
“It’s like an Avengers’ daycare center with state of the art facilities, all expenses paid for. All we’re missing is Shuri,” she thought wistfully, knowing Shuri would’ve enjoyed this.
” and it was the most irrationally annoying thing. The man said something to her, grinning arrogantly in a way that made Steve grit his teeth, and Toni arched that familiar, disbelieving and wholly unimpressed brow.
If Fury had a Big Week then Toni would argue - and
Before she could slip into something maudlin Kamala came out in the suit, beaming at all of them. At some point she'd cut up a piece of blue fabric into a domino mask and placed it over her eyes as well and Toni and Hope shared an exasperated and resigned look from across the kitchen. They all offered the necessary oohs and aahs and Kamala preened under all the attention.
In her own reserved and prickly fashion, Toni liked Kamala a lot, adored her in a way that almost scared her, just like it did with Peter and Harley. She was yet another kid to worm her way into her rusty little heart and Toni wouldn’t deny that she felt a sometimes extreme level of overprotectiveness when it came to those kids. It was the same kind of feeling that she had with Laura and her children, and what had made her install an overkill of defence mechanisms on the farm just to keep them safe and call to check in on them at least three times a week. It was the same kind of feeling that made her give Harley a device akin to a panic button as well as a direct line to JARVIS when he was around, and later to FRIDAY, which was how he’d found his way to the Compound in the first place. It was the same kind of feeling that convinced Toni to part with RIA and give her to Peter.
Dinner had been an affair. Everybody seemed to know something was up, even Nathaniel, who chewed on Toni’s sleeve more vigorously than usual, but she appreciated their effort to keep spirits up by tossing jokes and funny family stories back and forth and steering clear of more serious topics.
“they don’t even need to
The numbers in the tiny black screen of the oven told her it was five minutes past four in the morning. She blinked at it slowly, feeling awareness come back to her in tiny nudges on the corners of her conscience. How long she’d been sitting there she didn’t know yet; she could barely recall what happened after Cap...Rogers...

Everybody’s heads snapped to the side when the door to their apartments opened and Aneka walked in followed by-

He wasn’t mad, per se. But then he was still drugged up. And Toni did seem sorry about everything. More than she needed to be. And she’d sworn not to do it again, so.
But Steve couldn’t smile. Ever since he’d told everyone the truth, smiling felt taboo and it was like his face had forgotten how to anyway.
“You know what I hate about the current education system?” she asked, and Kamala looked up at her curiously. “The fact that it puts a hell of a lot of pressure on kids. They’re always expected to

Several floors below her, he responded in kind.
Cooper’s eyes widened like he couldn’t bring himself to hope.
“That’s my girl,” she said, then continued louder as she addressed Steve and the others, her voice only marginally mocking, “Okay, people, so here’s what’s going to happen.”
But Wanda shook her head, frustration evident in the furrow between her brows. “No. It’s
“I am here.”
“Closing containment chamber...and....done. Beginning modulation sequence now.”
Across the room Natasha saw Coulson lean forward in his seat, Melinda May and Daisy Johnson beside him. It still gave her such a kick whenever she saw him. They hadn’t spoken properly yet, just briefly in passing when he helped get her another alias. But they’d need to remedy that soon. As if he’d heard her, he turned and met her gaze, holding it.
“Well.” His lips curled into a rueful smile. “I have to believe you. Wouldn’t make sense not to considering everything I’ve seen and done ever since obtaining this power. So yes, I believe you and I believe what you’re doing, bringing Steve Rogers and his merry band of
Yeah, they really needed to have a talk about the whole concept of a secret identity.
He spoke a good game but Toni could hear the edge of fear in his voice and see the tense strain on his forehead and seriously, god bless the resilience of kids when it mattered.

in a way that made something cold and anxious settle in the pit of her stomach. He cast a fleeting look at the kids before leaning forward, speaking low and quiet. “During my training the Ancient One said something to me. She said that something was coming.

direction they were waiting on, Helen included.
Instead, it was Barnes whom she couldn’t help but focus on. It was Barnes, who lay there on the operating bed with one arm and the other a gaping mess. It was Barnes, who looked pale against the sleek lines of the operating bed, whose eyes were closed and who had a tube inserted down his throat, Barnes who was linked up to an array of drips and IVs and who was undergoing one of the most revolutionary surgeries of the decade.
“Could be something really lowkey,” Natasha pointed out.

She’d promised Rhodey.
“Toni?” Pepper was reaching out for her, looking worried. “Honey, are you okay?”
Toni had been privy to Peter’s identity, whether by his own admission or because she’d made the call and hadn’t given him a choice in the matter. Before giving him the new suit she had probably intended on clarifying just how far he was willing to let people, let the

This story has been a mental and physical challenge for me and is easily one of the longest things I've written/am writing and I'm learning a lot not only through writing but from the comments you guys leave me so really, thank you.
Toni knew that in the moment of quiet that followed, near silent footsteps were making their way towards her. She felt it in the tingling at the back of her neck, the raising of hair on her arms and the staccato of her heart beat against the arc reactor, deep within her chest.
At some point Toni had walked out of the Compound, barefoot and unsuitably dressed for the night weather that had taken a turn towards winter.
the sight of him stealing the breath back out from her lungs and making her freeze as if a bucket of icy water had just upended itself over her head.
She could practically hear Cap’s disappointed voice in her head saying,
“I hear you commandeered a certain genius princess for one of your secret projects. T’Challa looked like he didn’t know whether to rejoice or fear what the hell you two were gonna come up with together.”
“Yeah,” she said, squeezing Peter’s fingers and smiling up at him, mustering as much reassurance from the bare reserves of her bones as she could. “Yeah, I’m okay.”
Wanda lifted one shoulder in a shrug but there was a coldness in her eyes, a suspiciousness and dislike that she always failed to hide whenever Toni came up.
At least she hoped he would be after all this was over and he was done laying into her for taking his suit and putting him in danger and probably very nearly getting him

Two days later she came across a glass cabinet in the lounge that she’d been too hesitant to venture into. It was full of family photos, many of them candids. One of the photos was of a baby Cooper grinning up into the face of the man holding him. The man’s face was out of the frame but she recognized the v-shaped scar on the man’s hand, embedded in the flesh between the thumb and forefinger.
“You have a family back home, do you not?”
like. There was a lot to be deciphered in her words but Laura could hear the message clearly; we miss her and we want her to come home.
“Today was a good day,” he said, in a soothing voice.
He tilted his head to the side. “Why does it matter to you?”
His and Steve’s confession about what had happened in Siberia had gone down about as well as anybody expected. Though their interactions were frictional at best, Bucky had been thankful for Sam’s calm presence through it all, keeping Barton from taking a swing at Steve, laying a gentle hand on Wanda’s shoulder when her eyes filled with tears, a conflicted expression on her face that Bucky had no way of deciphering, talking low and quiet to Lang when he practically collapsed onto a seat with his head in his hands, clearly thinking about his daughter and trying to reconcile his leaving her with his reasons for joining the fight.
“There’s just one more thing, sir. What about Thaddeus Ross? You and I both know that even once the Avengers are back and legitimized he’s still going to do whatever he can to compromise any understanding we’re able to achieve.”
“Yes,” he drawled, with a telling flicker towards his faintly trembling scarred hands. Toni grimaced internally; she knew what surgical rods and a tragically ended career looked like. “I was. I went to a talk your med branch was holding. You were there. You introduced your non-radiative imaging machine.” He smiled but his blue eyes were unblinking, scrutinizing her every move. “I was very impressed. I wanted to introduce myself to you but-”
“The usual,” she replied with a frosty smile that Toni imitated and hers was
“It’s a
Doctor Cho was speaking and Stark was nodding attentively, her expression one of serious concentration. She was partway through a sentence when she must have noticed them coming through the corner of her eye, for her entire body stilled like a wind-up toy coming to an abrupt halt, her hands frozen mid-gesture.
Because that was a very literal leap of faith, that was Toni putting her life in Spider-Man’s hands, that was Toni

The skin around the arc reactor throbbed, still bruised. Had she not fitted her suit with its own reactor that day, she wondered if a super soldier would’ve dug right into her chest and pulled it out.

“He is not at his home in Queens,” Vision promptly supplied from her phone, which T’Challa had taken from her. “I have directed Agent Hill to take a team down to the site for cleanup. She is sending her second-in-command, Agent Fern, down shortly and Ms. Romanov has already informed the Council and the Panel of the situation.”
take their side? “I think we’ve got a win in this one.”
“I try.” She wandered over and perched herself next to him on the edge of the console, watching as he stuck his hand through a small portal next to him and pulled out a glass of lemonade. She was even more surprised when, rather than hand it to her, he laid it on the console between them, letting her pick it up in her own time. “Thank you,” she said quietly and he gave her a flash of a smile before sipping his own drink.
But he saw it as a ringing endorsement, a testament of
“I spent eight straight days with her on the Guarantor Clause. His Highness brought it up during the first round of talks but we’ve been breaking it down even further. Doesn’t affect you anymore but for us masked guys who’d prefer to keep our identity from the public and the Council? It’s vital. I only got through sixty pages of her notes but I kept seeing Spider-Man’s name pop up.” Hope crossed her arms and jerked her chin towards where Toni was cleaning the blood and dirt from Parker’s hands. There was something very intimate about it. “She knew from the start that she wanted to be Spider-Man’s handler because she knew he was just a kid and would want to keep his identity a secret. The clause has a huge section on anonymity and even provides for where a masked hero doesn’t want his or her identity to be revealed to the team.”
Wanda had taken hers to her room, disappeared for a good eight hours, then come out and quietly handed her obviously thoroughly-read contract back to Natasha.
“You cool if I shoot you in the eye with a nail gun,
Vision, as always, was a lifesaver.
The direction her mind was going was visible on her face and T’Challa marvelled at how far they had come in such a short time that he was able to identify it or that she was comfortable enough around him to let him see.
“Who the fuck’re you?” Harley asked, looking Peter up and down, unimpressed.
“I have seen him try so hard, every single day, to fight the monster he believes he is. Do you know he actively tries not to touch people because he’s afraid he’s going to kill them?” she demanded, the color high on her cheeks in her fury. “Can you even imagine that? Even when he is himself. He refuses to

what he was, what he saw mirrored on her face.
In the window, Vision saw her reflection bow her head, as if in defeat.
No wonder he’d left her there.
“Why did you decide to join the Avengers?” she asked after a time, keeping her voice soft and open.
“Cassie seems like a really a cool kid. You should be proud.”
with such innocent reverence that Toni felt it radiate through the screen and into her.
“Why don’t we discuss this further over dinner?” T’Challa interjected before they could all start talking again. “It has been a long trip and Shuri was telling me she was very much in the mood for that burger place you took us to last time.”
She laughed tiredly but it was a laugh nonetheless that softened the almost perpetual tension in the corners of her eyes, a rare enough sight these days that Rhodey committed it to memory.
Thankfully they both knew to leave that well enough alone.

“Yeah, probably. He’s got anger issues. It’s nothing - okay well it
And then Toni started to clap, slow and mocking and Steve just stood there like the helpless idiot he was and took it.
Something obvious.
Toni lifted a shoulder in an awkward shrug, feeling suddenly self-conscious.
She sat on the frigid ground, her back resting against the walls of the greenhouse she and Vision had built with their own two hands, and looked up at the clear night sky and the stars beyond.
“My brother called me before he brought Sergeant Barnes back to Wakanda and told me that he was innocent and that Everett Ross had the real man in custody. I didn’t believe him. Not until he brought him to my lab. Have you ever seen an injured lion being taunted and attacked by one of our war rhinos, Stark?”
“Cool.” She glanced over her shoulder one last time and Bucky surreptitiously pocketed the wrench. “You’re free to go, Barnes. Enjoy the arm.”
There was a small camera unit on the long implement above the claw and Bucky blinked slowly as he was surveyed up and down, and had to lean backwards when the claw got just a little too close to his face, spinning around slowly as if contemplating the level of harm it intended to inflict.
Leaning in close, he gave her a pointed but kind look. “Regardless of what you might think, we

“An exaggeration,” he said bluntly.
“But this,” T’Challa continued as if Toni wasn’t screaming for her mother inside her own head. “This is going to work. The governments of the world will have to listen.
“I’ve seen your facilities. It’s got
At that moment Toni came striding swiftly into the operating room, her scrubs, matching the high-necked ones that Helen and the rest of her team wore, already neatly donned, and her hair in a hairnet that was tied at the back of her head.
Toni laughed shortly, bitterly. “What could I...how could I

, but from the wry look Nat gave her she suspected she’d not succeeded well enough.
Stark had blasted off HYDRA’s arm in a tempest of fury and pain and now she was about to remove the physical pieces -
“I asked her to. And in the interest of transparency, and you can totally be mad at me for this in addition to my other shitty actions but I think you’ve realized by now that I’m a piece of shit and invade people’s privacy and never ask for permission.”
“Wanna take a fly with me?” She smiled, and it was warmer this time, not tainted by the layers upon layers of compact guilt and pain and exhaustion. And Vision found himself smiling in return.
“I need to think about this.”
“Heart rate is still dangerously high.”
The table was eerily quiet. All eyes, including Nathaniel’s, were on her.
Nathaniel cooed up at her. If that wasn’t stellar praise then she didn’t know what was.
She groaned again and Peter yelped behind them.
Toni felt the corner of her mouth quirk upwards in spite of herself. “Yeah. Guess we have.”
Because it was her.
Another little thing I added was KAREN's voice being Toni's mother's, or the mother whom she remembered from her childhood before things got complicated. I have a headcanon like Toni wouldn't have been outright able to call her AI Maria so she probably settled for 'Ria' because it was Howard's nickname for his wife.
Steve had never intended for things to go down the way they did, but at this point, he was just following the plot.

Natasha studied her face fiercely for a long moment before something sad, almost distraught, passed over her striking features and her shoulders slumped like all the fight had just left her body.

After a moment of his silence, she licked her lips and looked away, saying quietly, almost

It just sucked majorly that when it counted the most she’d flaked.
And why did it sound like she was talking to them? Why did it sound like an accusation?
The specs for Barnes’ arm were open on the tablet in front of her and she’d been putting it through simulation after simulation to test its durability and resistance when her finger stilled, hovering an inch above the touchscreen.
Toni couldn’t help the grin as she heard Rhodey’s unintelligible grumblings through the comms.
“Barnes.”
And Black Widow was always on the clock.

“What did he tell me, Romanov?”
Laura’s dark brown eyes lingered on her even as she spoke to her kids.
Her mother’s scream.
Her eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “Yes. The choice,” she said again, but slower this time. “Choice is a big deal these days. That and consent. If you don’t want this now, you say the word and you’re free to leave. We’ll find another way.” She spread her fingers wide, palms open like she was holding something invisible and unspoken up for him to take, freely given. As if it was
And laughter. Lots of laughter.
Peter tugged off his mask and Shuri swivelled around in her seat, the both of them wearing similar expressions of youthful, wide-eyed expectation. Rather than stifling, their attention felt patient and Toni was grateful for it as she ran through her conversation with Strange and examined FRIDAY’s analyses of Strange’s powers while he was in the Compound.
She sniffed at intervals. A cold? Maybe the air was too dry. Maybe she was just tired.
This was him. Her Rhodey. Her one-hundred percent reliable, perpetually beautiful Rhodey.

But it was something uncomfortably similar. Some sort of feeling of
To her surprise he chuckled, a low and drawling sound that made her think of loose leaf tea on a mountaintop and old books that stained her fingers black with powdery ink. The image disappeared as soon as it came and she blinked, coming back to awareness as his laugh tapered off.
“Thought you’d never ask, Boss. Nice to have you back...
It took Stark three seconds after that to realize herself what she had done. Bucky watched as her smile went tight before sliding off completely, and her expression chilled as she stared first down at their clasped hands, then slowly raised her eyes to meet his, horror and revulsion making her eyes go wide.
“Yes,” she answered truthfully, looking him in the eye. “More than a little, anyway.”
time,” she swore, and realized that it was one of the easiest things she’d ever promised.
Toni glanced over her shoulder but Laura was kneeling in the dirt with her back to Toni.
“Sure thing, boss.”
Kamala’s expression when they’d presented the suit to her after everyone had gathered for dinner one night had Toni nearly getting all misty-eyed and Hope suspiciously turning her face away.
“Oh my fucking-!” Peter exclaimed with wide eyes. “Dude, is that her
The one to Gulmira.
Several council members didn’t look impressed.
“What the
There was anxiety, a healthy dose of it. But there was...anticipation, apprehension, excitement and something that he thought might have been premature relief.
A wide-eyed nurse stood in the doorway leading into the operating theatre, nervously shifting from foot to foot.
The space she filled - simultaneously small and infinite - as she dozed against him in the quinjet, wearing his SHIELD t-shirt, the weight of her so fragile and precious.
“I remember everything,” he began finally. “Every single thing that has ever happened, everything that I’ve seen, everything that I’ve ever read. Down to the smallest details. But that day in New York…” She didn’t even need to ask: she knew
“She’s gonna be fine. You did really good tonight, kid. Next time, though? Call me. It’s a lot quicker than that death trap you have outside. You bring that all the way from Tennessee?”
“I-” Toni began before she was promptly pushed down onto the toilet seat.
“Maybe I’m just trying to make up for everything else I’ve done. All that blood on my name.”
He didn’t know yet what to call it.
“Already on it, Boss,” FRIDAY responded immediately, her voice sounding almost hard. “Checking surveillance cameras within a five mile radius. Relaying all information to you, Happy and Vision.”
Worry did that to a person but it was plainly obvious to Nat that this was something more than that. She’d already figured out Spider-Man had been a kid the first time Toni brought him in and she’d heard the excitement in his voice and seen the adolescent lines of his body, only on the cusp of broadening upwards and out.
Bucky hesitated.
” she stuttered, and her hands were shaking on the wheel.
Two years ago they’d collapsed side by side in a portable decontamination container, naked and bleeding and laughing hysterically after a gruelling fight with some Chechen insurgents.
And that gave Steve strength.
A hand closed around his heart and he wished so badly right then that he could’ve retracted the last four words because of the
was unsaid but she heard it anyway.
“Oh. That’s a shame.”
Her chest ached and she was pretty sure the hand not holding Vision’s was numb, even from where it trembled on her knees.
That didn’t mean that it didn’t feel like it was personal. Or that Steve wouldn’t understand if it was, all things considered.
hold us together, we’re dead in the water without a paddle here.”
There were a few heavy beats of silence before she spoke again.
“I did not lie, FRIDAY,” Vision soothed with a level of calm that he knew would infuriate her as much as she could be infuriated. Ma’am’s creations were often as complex and startling as she was. “I merely provided Dummy with an explanation of my goals. Ma’am may not be here but she soon will be. Thanks,” he added, letting his mind enter the stream of computer code that ran through the Compound, “for the most part, to you, FRIDAY.”
It took a while but the name came to him eventually. Harley Keener. The kid Toni talked about incessantly whenever she got off the phone with him. He’d only briefly caught a glimpse of his picture on Toni’s phone once. From the limited number of conversations they’d had about the kid, he seemed to be both a smart alec and somewhat of an inventor. The fact that Toni got along well with a kid like that was unsurprising but he’d never expected her to actually invite them to the

in her expression.

Toni nodded slowly. “So you took it.”

. Like those split-second moments during a mission where she realized she’d walked into something a little out of her depth.
“Yeah,” he admitted after a while, looking off into the corner but seeing a replay of the Avengers on the news. “Not sure at what though.”
Natasha pondered on the irony of it all, wondering why Toni had consecutive bouts of shitty luck and why the universe seemed to be out to get her at every turn when all she wanted to do was something good.
, T’Challa.”
Without waiting for anyone to respond, she weaved her way around the table and left the room.
Her heart froze inside her chest cavity, a trillion stars condensed together and vibrating at a frequency beyond anything the world had ever seen.
