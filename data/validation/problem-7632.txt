“There’s someone else.”
Steve grins. “I know.”
Steve flexes his muscles, dramatically. “Right.”
“You came to my house, because you wanted to warn me about that HYDRA agent, right? And the fact that SHIELD might make contact with me?” Tony clarifies.
Obadiah growls and slashes him with those knives on his hand, cutting deep into Tony’s arm, just below the burn. Tony yelps and kicks him hard in the stomach.
“I do,” Maushmi pipes in. She leans forward, almost toppling out of Steve’s arms, if he hadn’t grabbed onto her before she fell to the ground. “Are you going to stop them from coming after us again?”
assassins?”
Abraham hits another button, and padded restraints close in on Steve’s head, holding him still. Steve’s wide eyes glow a darker, more intense blue than his normal eyes, and finally, the injector vials empty completely.
“Yeah, James, turns out being dumped has negative effects on a person’s self-esteem and mental health issues, so they turn to self-medicating so they can get out of bed every day!” Tony retorts, his voice turning into the edge of a blade with every word that passes out of his mouth.
And then, it’s just him and Steve, and they’re both breathing heavily, and there’s fire around them, turning Tony’s skin sweat damp.
“You don’t even know them; how would you know?” Tony huffs.
Steve just stares at him, a raging, singular profile on his own, pale and taut. “When did you become so bitter, Tony?” he asks, coldly.
Tony feels the emotion flood into his throat, knot there painfully.
He doesn’t mention that he and Ty used to fight a lot, because those fights usually ended with Tony taking a punch to the face or the gut.
“No, yes,” Tony grinds his teeth, and finally, explodes, “I don’t fucking know!” He drags his hand through his hair. “I guess… I don’t know what the fuck’s wrong with me,” he grumbles.
Tony takes a brave step forward. “Your loyalty was supposed to be to your family,” he says, stonily. “Your loyalty was supposed to be to your husband, your children, not some seedy intelligence agency that would’ve seen you get blown up in fucking Kandahar and not given your corpse to the people who actually love you in this world.” He shakes his head. “You proved that you don’t give a shit about me, about our kids, about this family. You have lied to me at every opportunity. You didn’t have to do that.” He blinks away the dampness that enters his eyes. “You could’ve told me the truth at any time, and you didn’t, because it didn’t serve your purposes. It
Tony grunts when Steve spins him around, pins him against the wall with his chest pressed against the notches of Tony’s spine. There’s a damp noise that fills the alley, and Tony pounds the flat of his fist against the wall, when Steve slides his fingers inside him, filling him full, filling him perfectly. He twists and crooks his fingers, searching for that spot that makes Tony’s toes curl, and when he does, he mercilessly attacks it, knowing that Tony’s burning up with the desire to have Steve inside him.
them to touch you. And you wanted him to touch you. You wanted
Tony’s sitting on a chair in a tent, with his hands tied painfully behind his back, and a gag in his mouth. He struggles, but all that it serves to do is make his shoulders ache even more than they already do.
His voice is barely above a whisper, warbling on the edge of hysteria, like Tony’s hand is the only thing grounding him to this earth.
Steve wouldn’t do this, wouldn’t touch him like this, because this is how it begins, it devolves from here; this is how Ty started, and it ended with him being admitted into hospital with his body broken and bloodied and bruised and with his jaw fucking wired shut.
Slowly, though, he starts to come out of the depression that had ensued after they’d received confirmation that he would never go back his serumed self. He trains with Natasha, building up muscle and strength, and he goes out, to the VA, on runs, and he meets a nice ex-pararescue named Sam, whom Tony thinks could steal Steve away from him and he would probably be okay with it.
“Then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters right, you’ve got some place to be in a half hour,” Phillips snaps.
“Yeah,” Tony says, resoundingly. “He left a letter, but it didn’t explain anything.” He wrings his hands together. “I just assumed he was done with me, you know? I’d outlived my usefulness to his cause, and he’d… he’d gotten a little something extra for all of the problems that I gave him.”
“That’s ‘cause you’re in
Coulson doesn’t miss a beat. “Only family allowed, Tony, I’m afraid.”
“How did you, how did you even know to do this?” Steve asks, his eyes widened with obscene awe.
“I didn’t know you two were going to be there,” Natasha says, almost hysterically. “If I’d known, I’d never have worn it. Tony, I’m a bitch, but I’m not a complete cunt. Yeah, I was trying to mess with you a little, try and get a good picture of what sort of person you were, but I wasn’t deliberately trying to sabotage your relationship.”
“No, I’m just realising exactly how cruel you can be,” Tony barks, his voice snapping like a rubber band. “You think you’re losing me, and you’re trying to bind me to you. We already have kids, so what else is left for you except to prove that I’m a total slut for orgasms, but no, no, no, that would be too dangerous, right? If I was a slut for orgasms? No, that might mean I could go out and find someone else to give me my orgasms instead of you. That’s not good at all, is it?” he taunts. “No, you want me to be aware of the grand realisation that you are the best and only person to give me what I so desperately want, so I don’t any good ideas about walking out of this house and finding something that detracts away from my glorious purpose of being a fucking nursemaid and whore when you feel like showing up. I hope you feel better about yourself, Steve. I hope you’re satisfied. I genuinely hope you feel like you succeeded, even if there’s more to a marriage than great sex, because at least,
Sam shakes his head. “No, I didn’t know that. I’m sorry,” he offers.
First, she asks them if they want any wine.
“What are you doing?” Tony demands, his voice rough. “Why’d you stop?”
“You’re good with them. You do everything with them. You take them to all of their after-school activities; you drop them at school, and you’re always there to pick them up. You go to every single event, every recital, every class. You fix up their hair just before they get into the car. They listen to every word you say. You’d die for them, wouldn’t you?”
Most of the time, it is all very innocuous, and Tony finds himself second-guessing his hysteria, his discomfort; after all, Grant is his goodbrother, his alpha’s twin brother.
Steve’s brow furrows. “Did she know what?”
“What are you doing here?” he asks, hurriedly.
Tony chews on his lower lip, but finally nods with a sigh.
Disappointment curls in Tony’s belly – he would have liked it if Lord Steven had stayed longer, but perhaps that was wishful thinking.
“I…” Tony is completely lost for words, floundering. “I know how it looks, I know that if it were me on the other side, I wouldn’t believe that James and I were just friends, and I don’t think that, with our history, we could ever be
“Tony!” Wanda shouts into the phone. “Tony, they’re inside the house! They want the kids! Tony! Tony-”
Maushmi pats him on the cheek. “He just wanted to try a different bed, but I reminded him how good this bed was. He won’t leave you again,” she says, confidently.
“It’s not just about your drama,” Steve says, kissing the top of his head. “I love you, and we
Toni sighs, and she tips her head back to catch his eyes with hers.
He slips into the back seat just as the twins open their eyes, and they both climb into his lap, and immediately start blubbering, turning his skin and clothes wet with their tears.
James lets out a loud groan, slinging an arm over his face. “I think you might have killed me. I think you might have drained me off all fluids,” he complains.
Steve purses his lips. “Then, Thor’s mother will come through,” he says, with immaculate confidence.
“No, I suppose not.”
She’s fierce and unapologetic and stern in a comforting way, and she sits there lets Tony go first, lets him spill out all of his guts onto the floor.
“You’re so fucking dumb,” Steve declares. “You think I left you because I wanted to leave you.”
“Yeah, my friend, someone broke into her house; they attacked her. She’s on the ground. She needs an ambulance. Yeah, she’s still breathing. She’s face-down on the carpet. She has a head wound, but it looks superficial, so I haven’t moved her just in case. I’m calling her husband as well. Yeah, thanks, thank you.”
“Now,” Steve smiles, pain etched in all of the lines around his mouth, “now, I know that you can’t love me, that you’ll never be able to love me, and that’s fine, I understand that, I understand–” He closes his eyes. “I have the same face as the man who brutalised you for months. How could you possibly love me? But I know when you asked me to come to your bed, you were asking me out of duty. I want you to love me, and if you can’t love me, that is fine. Your… your value to me is not based on how often that you spread your legs for me, Tony, or the number of children that you bear. I do not see such things when I look at you, and I am fine. You do not need to feel bothered or required to attend to me in such a way. It would be unfair for me to expect such a thing from you. I
Tony rushes over, bringing Steve his clothes, and he stops right in front of him, swallowing thickly as his mouth goes as dry as sawdust.
Tony nods, demurely, teeth sinking into his lower lip.
James shrugs. “We’re all adults here. I think we’re fully capable of making this choice, and we’ll deal with the consequences once it’s done, like adults.”
“Fuck,” Tony says, breathlessly, and tips off his cock, back on the bed.
to be with me, and I don’t care about any of them because I had
The frat boy righted himself on his two feet, brushed imaginary dust of his stupid polo shirt, and scowled hard, his face transforming into something resentful and sour.
“They didn’t see me like this?”
“Now, time for sleep.”
Steve rubs at his arm, ever comforting. “It was just a dream. It’s gone now,” he promises. He hesitates. “You know, it’s weird, because I had a bad dream too last night.”
“Goodbrother,” Tony replies, his voice strangled.
Steve smooths his thumbs over his cheekbones, so unbearably soft.
His mouth is pulled back from his teeth in a snarl, baring the pale, sharp shine of his molars.
“Okay, what the hell.”
Tony eyes the kids still playing hopscotch. “I have to take the kids back,” he says, uncertainly.
Tony looks at Eshe, dread sinking into his gut like stone.
Wow, Tony likes her even less than he did before she opened her mouth.
Tony twists around in horror at the same time the killer makes a grab for his face with his knife-fingers. He instinctively throws himself back, hitting the ground, before he scrambles back, scrambles to his feet, and runs like hell.
Maybe that’s what Steve sees now, when he looks at him, sees the fat on his body, the new person that he is now, instead of the boy that he married.
Steve is pale and taut in his rage. “I am
“You said your piece; now, let me say mine,” Tony barks at him. “I wondered for years what I’d done. I’d wondered if I’d said something, done anything, acted too clingy, whether you’d heard something about me that turned you off me. I felt like shit, constantly, thinking about you, thinking about how much I’d embarrassed myself around you by acting like we were in love when you clearly didn’t feel the same way.
Pepper and Natasha wander off in search of a guest room, leaving Tony and Steve alone in his room.
“Come back inside. I just have to talk with your Aunt Wanda. You can watch Dora on the TV,” he cajoles.
“I’m someone who cares a lot about you,” James replies, simply. “I’m someone who’s worried about you.”
“That’s just going to have to wait, Mr. Stark,” a grouchy voice enters the conversation.
have to say this, until you start to believe me.”
“I’m glad.”
Sam frowns. “Why?” he asks, confused.
“I can take care of myself,” Tony growls low in his throat.
After that, there is immediate silence.
Toni looked up, curiously.
But no, Tony now knows why it has dwindled, and it’s because of a beautiful redhead named Natasha Romanoff.
“You don’t understand,” is all that Howard says.
“I’m glad he did. I’m just pissed that it wasn’t me. We got home and… God, I fell apart,” he muses, dragging his hand over his face. “I just… I fucked up,” he says, honestly. “I really fucked up. I hurt Tony, and I hurt our kids, and they were hurt because of me. I know they were HYDRA, the guys that took them, but I should have been there. I should have been protecting them, and I wasn’t, and they almost got hurt because of me, and they deserved better. Tony took charge again; he went to the hospital, spoke to Sam and Wanda and got them to forgive us, and I just… I kind of just sat there, by the kids’ beds, and I didn’t want to move. And then, Tony came home, and we talked, and it was… I don’t know, it was
Tony resisted the urge to laugh. If only, he thought, it was that easy.
Yinsen blinked. "I—" He tilted his head, considering Tony with new interest. "I wrote to your father several months ago, asking for him to provide some extra protection around town. Would you like to see the letter he sent me?"
Harley's head came up fully. "I don't want to talk to you," he snapped.
"Twice?"
"You think I
Tony raised his eyebrows. Captain Rogers failed to continue his thought, staring back at Tony expectantly. Christ, Tony thought.
Captain Rogers had remained out in the garden for almost the entire time Tony had been in the house. He'd only come inside when they were all preparing to go and saying their goodbyes. No one else had seemed to notice except Barnes and, to Tony's surprise, Wilson, who had given the Captain a keen look and drawn him aside for a hushed conversation before they all left. Tony burned with curiosity to know what was said, but he'd learned his lesson for the day about eavesdropping on talk not meant for his ears.
Peter's hard expression broke and he drooped. "My aunt
"They were quite worried about the ladies' safety with only me for protection." That was enough to make the icy tendril climbing up Tony's back relax a little; how could anyone doubt Fury's protection was beyond him. "Seems they've been hearing some stories of the robbers we've been having trouble with these past months. So they decided it would be best to accompany us all back home."
"I am." Yinsen reached back into his desk and withdrew a small book. "I've been collecting evidence, as much as I can. I was hoping to find a sympathetic magistrate who would be willing to investigate, someone who couldn't be bought."
"Duty calls, gentlemen," he said. "Be seeing you."
Tony held up his hands. "Take pity on a crippled man, sir," he said and started for the carriage.
She glanced up at him, pale eyes difficult to read. "I would think you'd want him to know. Him and Steve."
"Yes," Captain Rogers said. He sounded as soft and distant as he had last night. "I haven't been home in a long time."
Shield Hall was no Stark Manor, but it was magnificent in its own way. Tony found the harsh lines a little much, but they were softened by an abundance of windows and some interesting choices in art. One of the servants spirited away his trunk as he turned to look at some strange piece with several truly evil looking children frolicking that sat near the staircase.
Tony knew he was making a sour face, but he couldn't stop himself. He'd planned to treat his bruised side himself and hopefully keep anyone in the house from finding out he'd been injured. That idea had lasted until he'd opened his door that morning to find Bella already waiting for him, hands full of bandages and fuming.
Tony forced himself to wave a casual hand. "It's not like I keep a list of everyone I courted. It was six years ago. Who can remember back that far?"
Pepper’s little cottage was just as he remembered it, though it had still been her father’s when he’d last seen it in person. It was hardly as big as the great hall of the manor, but its white-washed exterior and pale roof were so tidy and lovely that it seemed altogether more elegant. Pepper’s father had enjoyed gardening, and Tony was pleased to see she’d kept up the vegetables he’d tended, as well as the bunches of roses, lilies, and tulips he’d kept near the front door. He stooped and plucked one of the bright red tulips.
The accusation burrowed under Tony's skin. He bared his teeth. "I don't
The tension seeped out of the Captain all at once, his shoulders relaxing and the harsh lines of his face easing. Tony's hands clenched and his stomach churned. What did it even matter if he proposed, he thought. Captain Rogers was going to marry Peggy, he hated Tony, they were nothing but the lingering shadow of old pain to each other—
As Tony passed the sitting room, he heard voices. Curious, he drifted to the door; as far as he knew, the other adults in the house were supposed to be out and about this afternoon. He froze in the doorway when he realized the broad-shouldered back he was staring at belonged to Captain Rogers.
go back on your word, would you?"
"You played with it every day." Something had shifted in the Captain's voice, making it come out dark and rough. "Don't you remember?"
Tony thought about Fury's bulk and black clothes and eyepatch. He'd pretty much become immune to the whole effect after years and years of being his neighbor, but it was probably pretty scary to a kid. Hm.
"Not that kind of party. A welcome home party. Just the three of us." Rhodey looked at Tony and back at Pepper and, proving he was definitely the most sentimental of the three of them, his eyes misted just a little. "It's been years since we've all been in the same room together. You and Pepper have finally made up. Pepper's having a
"It'll be fine," he said flippantly. They'd adapt, anyway. "Fury's not that bad. And we can always prank him if he gets too intolerable. That makes him
"Is it my fault it tickles?"
She dipped into a low and clumsy curtsey. "Yes, Lord Stark! He's inside."
“You didn’t visit with him when he returned?” Tony asked, surprised.
Yinsen cut him an unimpressed stare. He could probably quit being a doctor and just go around the country being unimpressed by people but Tony didn't think he wanted to hear that.
"Our uncle would never throw you out, Lord Stark!" Sharon said. "He likes you far too much."
Tony smiled; he couldn't help himself. He saw Fury shake his head out of the corner of his eyes, but he didn't pay him any real attention, not when he had someone who was actually interested in learning about machinery. He had only met a few people - man or woman - who really cared to learn about it and he was always attuned to any sign of interest, anything that would let him talk at length about his favorite subject. Peggy blinked, obviously taken aback by his enthusiasm, so Tony tried to reign it in a little.
Tony sagged. “You really know how to string a fellow along,” he said.
"You're being dramatic," Pepper told him when he voiced this thought to her at the end of the week, unable to keep it to himself anymore. "You've never been a cat person, anyway."
He could make out a dark shape down the road. As it came closer, more details revealed themselves; a heavy skirt, carefully coifed hair, a pale face.
The unexpected invitation for dinner at Stark Manor had come just that morning. A little party to welcome some friends of Lieutenant Barnes, apparently. A flurry of activity had eaten up most of the afternoon as the ladies rushed to prepare themselves. Tony had also spent a little too long trying to find something to wear. He thought his grey suit was stylish enough but he couldn't stop fiddling with his cufflinks.
Sharon had gone back to her breakfast, but Peggy looked between Tony and Fury with a crinkled brow. Tony offered her a reassuring smile, hoping that would soothe her even if he was a little curious at what she thought about the little byplay.
Steve gazes at her like he’s trying to see through the armor, like he wants to melt it off her. It scares her, sets her nerves on edge, because not too long ago, not nearly as long as she wishes it’d been, he tried to tear it apart.
She knows that he is sincerely sorry, but she isn’t sure that it
She hasn’t closed her eyes even once.
“You know I hate feeling useless.” She does. She knows that it irked him when he was a skinny, sick kid in Brooklyn. Knows that it irked him when he was a puppet for the government to use. Knows that it irked him when he was a step behind everyone else in the chaos that was the future.
, and it makes her hands fist with the urge to punch him.
So he allows it to go on, allows him to pretend there is any possible outcome other than the one they have both seen.
—of Steve being right… she doesn’t want to examine that either.
Toni’s right hand and Rhodey’s left are clasped together over his chest, and her other one is shoved under his pillow. She never sleeps like this, can never stay still, but that’s exactly why he’d demanded that she do this time.
Until he smashes the suit down onto the ground, into the pavement.
, how much she always wanted him, how badly he ruined her.
“Rhodes, she’s out of control.”
Toni had expected that, when they finally met again, it would be under dire circumstances that would unite them, drive them together, force them to put aside their differences.
“Don’t you fucking dare, Rogers. Look me in the eyes and tell me I’m not bringing them back.” He does, he stares, and still, all she can see is stuff she doesn’t want to examine.
, she told herself. It has been that way from the very start, from the very moment she was born. That has never stopped her before—no reason why it should now.
Toni’s just getting back to her feet after having shaken Nebula off her when someone else, much stronger and heavier, knocks her down again.
His tone is final, like he thinks that’s supposed to explain everything, but all it does is confuse her more, make the thing inside her curl tighter.
“I won’t hit you.”
Apart from the night before with Rhodey, it’s the first time she is exposed since coming back from space.
Because she is
“Toni, what are you even talking about? I’m not hitting you.”
angry she could set the world on fire.
“Exactly.”
He whispers a last goodbye against the carnage that was his mouth, murmurs

Steve snorts. “Really? Because I think it might be the opposite.” He’s right, to some extent.
, it thrums through her radioactively, reverberates against her bones like poison, but she gives in anyway, because she doesn’t have the capacity to resist him all the time.
He beats him—
“Then say it.”
“What are you doing?”
Nobody is doing much of anything. Nobody knows what to do, how to prepare for whatever is coming, where to start.
“Because you’re Toni Stark,” says Steve, and it is the exact moment the Doras use their spears to push them apart, the exact moment Rhodey comes looking for her, the exact moment the sky darkens.
, edge the line of
—the faceplate off the helmet, listens to the alloy wrench apart.
, he’d said when he had caught her rubbing the arc reactor. It had been a battle to get her to put away the nanobots, but she had conceded when he’d looked at her with the saddest face she’d seen on him since the accident.
She considers telling him that she hasn’t slept because there is a black hole in the middle of her chest that is sucking the light out of her, because stuck permanently to the back of her lids are Peter and Strange, her mother, Quill, her father, Mantis and Drax,
And that is perhaps the cruelest thing he could answer with, he knows that. Because Toni doesn’t deal well with not being able to solve a problem, with having to concede control over an outcome. Because the possibility—the
Steve’s face is a devastating mix of anger and disappointment, sad and miserable even under the glare of the sun. Toni thinks that whatever comes next in this fucked up intergalactic war, this is the last time they will see each other.
“Toni, come on. I said I was sorry.” His hands are raised almost to his shoulders, brow furrowed and tone pacifying. His whole demeanor screams
She snorts, doesn’t even try to rein it in. “Yeah, sure, okay. Whatever you say, Cap.”
, when they will finally,
Against his tanned skin, Steve’s eyes are blue, blue,
it out with a screech.
The third blast gets redirected far off because someone tackles her down.
Everyone else had kept their distance. Everyone else distrusted her.
“Are you here to supervise me? Because that role is already taken. I’d hate for you to waste your time unnecessarily,” she mocks.
The midday Wakandan sun is unforgiving on what little skin she shows: hands, neck, face.
It comes out overwhelmingly pained, like it was torn out of the depths of his soul, like it is as broken as the depths of hers.
The blood warms him, covers him in a blanket of safety and peace, of relief, of
In a flash, she’s snarling at him, stalking closer and taking Steve by surprise, if the look on his face is any indication.
Nebula stays silent the whole time, leaving her to drown in the turmoil of her thoughts. And she does, for a while. She replays the battle over and over and over again, until her lips begin echoing Peter’s voice, until a scream rips itself out of her throat to resonate through the ship.
“Why did you have to lie to me?”
and runs his hands—
no team, Rogers.” She’s close enough now to notice the ashen appearance of his skin, the way his eyes flicker over her new armor. “There stopped being a team the minute you lied to my face.” It’s vicious, almost as much as the ire boiling within her.
In front of her lie the remnants of the battle she missed. The ground is uneven, large and small craters alike littering the expanse of it; a number of trees have fallen down, their toppled trunks barricading the forest beyond the field; discarded weapons are scattered around, perhaps worth recovering if alien.
“Peter’s—he’s—he’s
She understands, but he doesn’t, like he can’t acknowledge his own faulty rationalization.
She doesn’t though, she
She walks, stops, crouches. Walks, stops, crouches. It’s mostly a mindless task that allows her to

He ruins Tony the way Tony ruined them, lovingly
“No thanks to you,” Toni snarks back, and whatever she had expected, Steve’s shoulders loosen a fraction as he nods gravely.
“I know, baby. I know.”
It’s no wonder he has never liked her.
“And you can’t go a day without reproving me, can you?” Toni’s words drip acid, searching for something to burn through.
There are no words, no sounds beyond the violent clanging of metal. They have nothing left to say, nothing that could change what is going to happen, what they have both agreed upon.
“What?”
The fact is, Toni knows too much about Steve, more than she ever wanted to.
“Toni, you can’t run away. I’m sorry about the kid, he—”
with him denying everything. Whatever mistakes she has made over the years, Toni has made the effort to recognize them, to try to make up for them, to give out reparations.
His face draws into a horrified sort of shock that fills her with a bitter satisfaction that feels wholly insufficient. Steve looks a little like he did when she told him about Ultron, when she told him about Wanda. He looks a little like he can’t believe he’s reached this level of disappointment.
The second blast misses him again, this time because he throws himself to the ground.
When she disappoints him, she disappoints herself.
“I’m not leaving until I speak to her.” Steve uses his Captain voice, the same one he’d used to tell her
“Early morning?”
again, she stops herself from making it worse, from spreading out all the razor-edged shards of her for him to see, finally,
There
, like they were for very brief moments in their relationship, but the gulf between them now is so wide that it really isn’t anything close to even that.
So they laid down, curled into each other, and murmured reassurances until Rhodey fell asleep.
Because she can’t stop seeing them: her mother, Peter, Strange, Quill, her mother, Mantis, Drax, her mother, Howard, her mother her mother her mother.
She turns to go, starts walking away, but makes it only a couple of steps before his voice stops her.
So Toni walks away, doesn’t look back, doesn’t see the lonely tear running down Steve’s face.
That’s not what happens.
Toni is surprised that she didn’t hear him coming. Once upon a time, Steve had been obvious, unmissable. She supposes this is not Captain America anymore, supposes this is Nomad.
, to take it back. There are things impossible to forget, impossible to forgive, and she knows, with absolute certainty, that this is one of them.
something. Toni can’t bring herself to believe that it changes anything, that there is a future for them in which they stop snapping at each other—even if it isn’t a future in which they are each other’s first choice.
When he spots him back, he hesitates but seems to understand, even from a distance, that there is no escape, that there is no hiding from fulfilling their duty.
“Get away, I’ll do it myself.”
All of her life. Her
She could see it in their eyes, in the way their expressions screamed

Steve asks, “Will you please open up the faceplate?” and she does, only because it’s Steve, only because he’s the only one she wants.

Until, to her astonishment, he shows up.
He looks down at Tony, at the small gash high on his forehead, at the trembling of his pink lips. He looks and he commits it to memory, this moment before the end of it all, before the final stretch of this road they have been walking down for too long.

She’s sure, already, that she doesn’t want to.
Sam perks up, sitting up straighter, leaning forward, his eyes sharpening in awareness.
“I felt like shit, of course,” Steve goes onto say, weary and spent. “I thought I was betraying Bucky by feeling anything for you, and then, I don’t know, after a while I forgot. It still hurt, it really fucking hurt to think of them, but it was… I started to come to terms with the idea that Bucky was really dead, that… I don’t know, I think Sam called it an ambiguous loss? And I was starting to come out of it, come to terms with his death. I still loved him, of course, loved Bucky desperately. He was my first love, my oldest friend. He was… even when I had nothing, I still had Bucky. And I suppose, the more time that passed, the less I knew of how to explain it to Tony, to tell him about Bucky, about how I felt. I didn’t want to hurt him, didn’t want him to stress over the idea that he was a rebound, that I was still in love with someone else, because that
“Yeah…” Tony drawls.
Sam leans back, satisfied.
“Come on, let’s see if Ma’s got some stuff from that time.”
“Where is it?” Steve asks, urgently.
The thing is, despite what others may think and believe and assume, Tony
, and I know you don’t need me to keep you safe,” Steve says, fisting his hands in his hair. “You’re strong on your own, and you don’t need me, not really; you can take care of yourself. I’ve heard all of it before, okay? I know that it’s demeaning and unfair and a shitty excuse, and it makes you feel like I don’t have a good opinion of you, but you’re wrong.
,” Tony growls, feeling a bite of bravery coming from somewhere.
Steve huffs and turns onto his back, so that he can pull Tony onto his body against his ribs, with Tony’s head resting on his breastbone.
“For the last fucking time, I am not sleeping with him,” Tony snaps. “I haven’t slept with James since I was in college, before I even met you. I am not sleeping with him now, Steve. I don’t know how many fucking times I have to say this, or rather,
“Okay,” she says, slowly. “Steve-”
He’s been working out; who is he working out for?
“What happened at the interview, Tony?” Steve grits out, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“So, you wanted to have us both?” Tony taunts.
“No,” Tony says, quickly, bluntly. “No, you don’t have to do that. It just… it bothers me that you defend her.”
“Steve,” Tony replies. “Steve Rogers.”
“Marry me,” Steve insists. “If we get out of this alive, marry me, stay with me, live with me, love me, I don’t give a shit; I just want us to be together.”
his husband.
“At the beginning, I guess… I guess I was scared how it would look,” Tony admits, honestly, wringing his hands together, dread dropping line stone in his gut. “I thought… I thought if I told you, you’d think there was something going on between me and him, and there
Even now, holding it, he remembers the way that Tony had shouted at him in Siberia, the weightless sensation in his hand as he dropped it.
Coulson stops just in time, aiming his gun towards the sky.
Steve looks down at himself, and the red really does go everywhere. “I mean, I think you wouldn’t have asked me to help you through your heat if you didn’t find me attractive,” he says, shyly.
, Wanda. You deserve a better friend than me.”
James looks at Tony. “May I?”
And now, he realises that he never had a chance, that they were always going to walk away from him.
“I would say it is.”
Peggy swallows hard. “You’ll have my resignation in the morning,” she promises, roughly.
A slow smile creeps across his face. “You a nurse, doll?” Barnes asks, appreciatively, looking him up and down.
“So fuckin’ pretty,” he murmurs, staring down at her.
good.”
“What the hell is going on?” Steve demands.
Tony covers his face with his hand.
“Aw, no, don’t do that,” Steve protests.
, in our religion is, I suppose, the span of the universe, how long it takes for it to begin and then, end. There are four
Be a man, they said, even when he looked nothing like a man once upon a time.
“Approximately one-hundred and seventy ounces,” Tony replies.
“You don’t get to tell me that,” Tony says, furiously. “Not now, not ever. You don’t… you don’t
In his religion, they burn their dead.
“I have to leave you here for a little while,” Steve insists, putting his hands on his thighs. “I know where the gem is, Tony. If I take you out of here, they’ll start combing the place for us.”
“It’s okay, Tony,” he murmurs, sorrow lining his face, even as he bears a smile for him, just for him, like now, faced with the harsh truth that Tony is dying, Steve wants to be strong for Tony, wants to give him comfort even in this moment where his world is ending. “We’ll be alright. You’ve done your job now; you saved us. You can rest.”
happy.
Natasha grabs him. “I’m not insane, okay?” she barks. “Don’t look at me like I’m some kind of fucking nutcase or something–”
Peter and Maushmi are sitting at the kitchen counter, eating their cereal, when the doorbell rings.
“That’s the way I like them,” Tony says, his throat flexing, something curling hot and mocking in his belly at the sight of Steve, with all those muscles, in that leather jacket and his thin white shirt and his slacks that cling to every line of his legs.
, huh? The idea of facing HYDRA together, because that’s all we need in this world, right? Each other-”
Steve purses his lips thin. “Strip,” he orders. “Slowly.”
He pushes the boy’s head back into the table and stares straight at Tony, with a smirk curling the edge of his mouth, as he finishes, three thrusts later, letting out a low groan with his release.
Steve sits up a little, his eyes hot, his brow damp with sweat. “Only if you want to,” he says, dazed.
“Sweetheart,” he says, and Tony’s throat unexpectedly tightens at how raw, how wounded his voice sounds, “sweetheart, I’m not going
James huffs. “These guys are assholes, Tony. They don’t deserve mercy.”
That is something Tony doesn’t know if he can take. He can be the poor, cuckolded husband, he can smile at Natasha Romanoff and pretend like he doesn’t want to bash her skull against the wall for fucking up his happy marriage, if it was even a happy marriage before she sunk her claws into his husband (maybe, all he’s been doing is piling more and more scar tissue over open, festering wounds, wounds that will inevitably be the death of them but wounds he’d always been willing to ignore), but he won’t stand there and let him treat the children like they aren’t enough for him either, just like is.
He lies down on his dry sheets and cries himself to sleep.
The way that he says
Tony sighs, leaning back against the table. “Well, let’s just say that, as someone who is arguably the best mechanical engineer in the country, and all I can say is that this stuff is… it’s impressive, to say the least.”
The lift ends its journey, waiting for them to exit, and Tony absentmindedly scrambles for the handle to pull the gilded door to the side, so that they can leave. Steve doesn’t seem like he’s in too much of a hurry to let go of Tony, and he yelps, when Steve’s abdomen braces, and he’s being lifted into the air.
Tony pales.
“Look, man, I don’t know why you’re here, why you’ve… you’ve picked me, but you can’t, you can’t do this. I mean, I’m not saying I’m perfect, but I sure as hell haven’t done anything to be
"I had read some books on advances in fossil record," he said, still distracted by the mystery of the Captain's absence. Was he still standing outside? "Fury's manor had more rocks around it than mine did, so I thought I might have better luck there."
Tears clung to Pepper’s eyelashes as she pulled away from him. That disturbed Tony almost more than anything else—the last and only time he’d ever seen Pepper cry had been during their disastrous fight six years ago.
He folded the letter and put it back in its envelope. He replaced it in the box. He glanced at the flickering candle and then, resigned at his own terrible decision, reached in and withdrew another letter.
Her brow furrowed. Tony imagined that she knew what it did to her lovely face - doubtless, more than one man had been swayed by that tiny motion. He stood firm.
this chapter gave me NO END of grief. i rewrote and rewrote it many times. i'm still not very happy with it, but if i look at any more i will cry so it's going out into the world in all of its messy glory. next chapter will hopefully be less of a pain and thus be out sooner.
“Well, I was close with every child my age within a ten mile radius of the house,” Tony said, hoping he sounded more casual than he felt.
Captain Rogers rolled his eyes. "Your doctor told you regular exercise and time outside to aid your recovery," he said in the bossy, overbearing way Tony remembered from the times he'd been sick as a child. Some things didn't change. "And what have you been doing? Holing yourself up indoors, barely even talking walks around the gardens—"
Yinsen's mouth pursed. "Something like that."
The girl led them inside with quick, disbelieving looks at Peter.
Tony needed to say something. Fury was watching.
"Mr. Stark, you have no idea how much—"
"'s fine," he said.
Tony tipped her a wink. “Oh, he never harassed your geese, my lady. That was
The butler did not look approving, but going by Peter's widening eyes, Tony might as well have plucked out the moon and put it in his hands.
He smiled at Bella and ignored the sharp pain under his breastbone. "Of course not," he said at last. "If that's what they both want, I wish them nothing but happiness."

The next year had been hard - Mrs. Rogers had died only a few months before Tony's birthday and everyone, Tony included, hadn't felt very celebratory. And by the next year, Captain Rogers and Barnes were on their way out to sea and it was only Tony, Rhodey, and Pepper left. Tony had felt the Captain's absence like an ache; he'd been a pain to deal with.
“Good. Now can I come in so we can talk about how
An ache spread under his breastbone, sharp and piercing as a physical wound. But what right did he have to be wounded? As far as Captain Rogers knew, Tony had dropped their—their—
Tony smiled at her. “I know you do,” he said. “Why do you think I do it so often.”

"And a smaller gun you can hold with one hand?"
He walked through all the rooms on the third floor, and all the rooms on the second. Many of them had been opened up, sheets put away and furniture arranged. Yesterday had been a frenzy of dusting, according to Jarvis, though Tony had been away for much of the morning and afternoon. The rooms all gleamed, the furniture looking new and untouched. Bucky shouldn’t have any complaints.
"Very pregnant," he said, keeping his unease under wraps. "If the baby doesn't come soon, I think she's going to riot."
Tony blinked. Pepper looked exasperated again.
As they passed Captain Rogers, he didn't offer a hello and Tony ducked his head instead of meeting his eyes. He could feel the stare on the back of his neck as they entered the house, but he refused to look back.
"You can keep from riding any more horses at night," she said. "You're asking to be robbed."
the point."
Captain Rogers' eyebrows shot up. "What?"
only interested in that and not in just taking a hand from a child, then I'd think this is the best possible situation for everyone. Or am I wrong, Mr. Toomes?"
"She was very cordial to everyone," Peggy said. "I think we will all be fast friends."
find a reason to be elsewhere."
That made sense. The papers hadn't mentioned much about the Captain's crew by name and Tony took in the assortment of characters with curiosity. These were all men who had been with Captain Rogers for the past six years, who knew things about him that Tony was totally ignorant of.
Tony bared his teeth in a hard, bright smile. “Well, I do love to surprise,” he said in his airiest voice.
"Or maybe some natural disaster will sweep through the land, preventing us from attending."
“Mr. Coulson said you seemed upset,” Jarvis said.
Time lost meaning in the middle of the project. Tony got so engrossed in nitpicking the way a certain cog would sit and trying to figure out a way to increase pressure without compromising space that he wasn't really surprised to look up and find the light outside darkening without any sense of the hours passing - he was, however, surprised to see Harley tucked into one of the dining room chairs, watching him avidly.
Pepper. Good Lord.
"I thought you were walking with Miss Carter." Tony hadn't meant to say it, but the words were already out. "You're back already?"
That stung, but it was a fair blow. It was what Tony deserved for eavesdropping. He clenched his fists and released them.
Tony stared at him. Toomes stared back, eyes narrowing.
If anything, Harley seemed to pale further. "We can't live with Sir Fury!"
"My heart is tied to my work, Miss Carter, as it likely always will be. I haven't met anyone who could distract me from it yet."
The words felt like a challenge, a blade drawn. Tony stiffened and turned away from her, searching for a distraction.
Tony sighed as the carriage came to a stop. He got out and helped down Peggy and Sharon while Fury attended to Bella. The girls chattered together excitedly. Tony hung back as the others led the way up the drive. It was a little strange to be coming up the drive as a guest.
"Dan," Captain Rogers said. "The trees everything you hoped for?"
"I'll really come." Tony patted Peter on the shoulder and contained his own frown at how thin it was. "I doubt the magistrate will listen to me, but I can at least throw some jargon around and see if it will get this boy released."
“You really shouldn’t take the art at face value,” someone said over his shoulder. “Uncle Nick has a strange sense of humor about it.”
"I'll have a talk with him," Tony said. "He can do better than some
"Those weren't picture books?"
He should go. He probably should never have come, but it had been a ritual of his after Captain Rogers had left to begin his adventure in the Navy. Every year he'd made the trip down to the cemetery to spend time with the kind woman who had taken in a wild, annoying lordling and given him some idea of what it would feel like to have an actual mother. At Cambridge, he'd tried to bury the rising guilt over not visiting but it had been impossible to ignore the longer he stayed away. It had been a relief to be able to do it this year, a silver lining in his wretched choice to stay and face the demons of his past.
He hadn’t, once. When they were children, Tony had been thick as thieves with all of them—Bucky, Pepper, Rhodey. Steve, too. No,
Tony's laugh wasn't as carefree as he wanted it to be. "Bother me? Rumors stopped bothering me when I was about six."
"You could hang it up somewhere," Captain Rogers said. "Keep it in a closet. Something."
Oh, Lord. "I insist they stay with you," Tony said firmly. "I will be just fine on my own and there are robbers in the woods."
"Nothing that bad, Mrs. Fury," Rhodey assured her. "But now that I'm here, it's time I have a little conversation with Pepper."
"You get used to it," he said. "Come on. Let's go round up your sister and drop by Dr. Yinsen for your mother. If we're quick, we can make it back in time to steal some food from Fury's kitchen."
Tony took the blow without showing it, or at least he hoped he did. Of course Captain Rogers would find him changed; Tony had only grown more haggard and pale during his academia. Captain Rogers, on the other hand, had grown into himself. He was also much changed, but he had only grown more handsome, more certain of himself, more capable. Where Tony had withered away, he had blossomed. Was it any wonder he looked at Tony with indifference and scorn?
, Lord Stark! Your work can't occupy you forever!"
A laugh. Tony almost closed his eyes, gritting his teeth against the hard clench of his stomach. He knew that laugh.
"Oh, I'm just easily bored. Thought I'd pick up some light reading."
Stark Manor had not changed in six years.
“A lieutenant? Shouldn't he be sailing the high seas, protecting our borders from degenerate Frenchmen?”
“I wouldn’t say a
But he didn't.
"Amnesia? Do you know anything about recovering lost memories, what kind of treatment—"
And as he said it, he only hoped that he could force it to become the truth.
The old butler inclined his head. Jarvis had been the Manor’s butler since before Tony was born. With his parents away, Jarvis had also been the one cleaning up after Tony, scolding him, and playing with him. In many ways, he was something of a father to Tony, or least a beloved uncle. Still, he despised long distance travel and found letters boring—Tony hadn’t heard from him since he left home. He was startled to see streaks of white in Jarvis’s gray hair and more lines around his eyes.
"There is nothing as intolerable to me as an easily persuaded mind," he said. "Flitting from this thing to that, changing your opinion with the wind. Allowing others to sway you from what you know to be true or good."
Tony closed his mouth with a sharp click. He, like the rest of the table, looked at Captain Rogers. Captain Rogers flushed under the weight of everyone's surprise.
"How much do you know about what happened to James?"
"You never told me that."
tree?"
"My cousin is inside with the Wilsons and Lieutenant Barnes," Peggy continued. "Come, I think you've earned yourself a bit of a sit-down."
"You live in town, don't you, Mr. Parker?"
Sharon didn’t seem to be aware of that silent exchange, but both Bella and Peggy looked bemused. Tony offered them a tight smile.
That got him another sharp look. "If this is some kind of weird interrogation—"
Tony woke late the next morning; it had taken him such a long time to fall asleep last night that fingers of sunlight had already been approaching his window by the time his eyes had closed. Groggy, it took him much longer than usual to dress and find his way to the dining room; everyone was already halfway through their breakfast.
"What did he do?" Pepper asked, so softly.
Tony blinked, still trying to come out of the engineering fog. "
"We didn't
He backed up a little, alarmed, as Peter's eyes filled with tears and it looked like he might go in for a hug.
For a long, suspended moment something clicked and he could feel that freedom in his grasp. The weight of his guilt and hurt and regret lifted as Goose galloped; he was outside of himself, too focused on the dark trees and cool night air and the heaving bulk of the horse underneath him to spare any attention for his thoughts. It was brilliant. It was peaceful.
“You need someone to stay with you,” he said, proving how good he was with strategy by the slick change  in conversation.
"I've been trying my hand at fermenting wine," she admitted. "It might not be any good, but it's drinkable."
She took Goose's reigns and calmed him with a few softly spoken words. Without letting go of Tony's arm, she began to frog march him down the path toward Stark Manor.
He hadn't had a good excuse to get out of this dinner, though he'd cycled through half a dozen ones that might work in a pinch. Since Mrs. Barnes had mentioned him by name in her invitation  -
Yinsen sighed. "Sir Fury doesn't think it's his place to interfere. Don't you see? You're the only person who can make any difference here. That's why I'm asking you."
Tony crossed his arms, watching Peggy tug Sousa with her down the forest path. "I feel like I should be offended," he said. "But honestly, I almost feel sorry for Sousa."
"I was the one who called it off," he said again. He couldn't sit down; he paced instead, crossing Pepper's small kitchen and turning to cross it again. "He proposed. I said no."
His mind, normally so competent, was overrun with too many possibilities. Panic threatened to overwhelm him and he had to clench his fist so that his fingernails bit into the skin to gain some control back. He forced himself to take several deep breaths. He'd known he'd have to see Captain Rogers today. It was just—after missing dinner, he'd thought the possibility of their meeting was gone and he'd allowed himself to relax. Now, being confronted with it again so suddenly, he found himself stalling out.
"You loved him," Pepper said, less outwardly gobsmacked. She settled her hands on the swell of her belly, frowning up at Tony. "You still love him."
"Got any theories on these robbers I've been hearing so much about?"
"They got a prime spot on
"If seeing me causes him pain
“I suppose I can understand him wanting to return home,” Jarvis said.
"The basic design as it stands now, Trevithick's work, it's solid but not exactly overwhelming." The lecture was familiar; he'd given it more than a few times over the past few years. He traced the edge of his coffee cup with a finger, keeping an eye on Peggy's expression to make sure she was following. "Even that is an improvement over horses and carriages, especially to transport large amounts of goods, but there's not enough power and a definite problem with overheating. But it's a fix that's relatively easy to put in place." He paused and wished he had something to draw on - it was much easier to understand what the problem was with a visual aid. "You see, just adding valves on each cylinder with a wrist plate control would allow from much more precise steam expulsion and keep the engine from stalling
have that effect on people. "Quick question - is there a reason everyone in town watches me like a magister watches a thief?"
"I'd be proud to accept that title. Someone's got to keep you from getting a big head."
Tony's stomach contracted so sharply he almost gasped. He clenched his hands on the straps of the worn little suitcases that Harley and Lucy had packed with their clothes and toys.
The Wilsons exchanged a look. The brother stepped forward and offered his hand to Tony with raised eyebrows. Tony didn't quite know what to make of his challenging expression and kept his handshake quick and impersonal.
, blah, blah, blah."
Tony didn’t want to open the letter. His father hadn’t sent any since he’d started attending Cambridge five years ago after his mother’s death. His father had been unconvinced of the merits of attending university at all, but Tony had roped Obie to his side, having him cite all the noble sons who were attending and making contacts and friendships with other noble sons. Tony had kept his mouth shut on that front. Obie was his father’s oldest friend and the best negotiator Tony had ever met; he was the only one who could ever really get through to Howard other than Tony’s mother. Besides, it didn’t matter if his father thought that Tony was only going to Cambridge as a stepping stone on his way to the House of Lords and what Howard considered Tony’s future, not if it meant Tony could actually learn from something other than outdated books and his own imagination. He’d had other reasons to want to get out of the Manor, but his father also hadn’t needed or wanted to know about them.
that?"
“Where’s Dr. Falcombe?”
a perfectly nice manor, not three miles away?”
He set it carefully on the floor.
"Are you all right?"
Tony scooped the letter up with his free hand. His landlord had doubtlessly left it there for him—he rarely got mail, other than the odd letter from Rhodey or Obie, and so fine an envelope had probably flummoxed the poor woman. Tony dumped his papers and books on his bed and sank into the rickety chair at his desk, letter still in hand. The front only had his name and address in the spidery scrawl Tony immediately recognized as his godfather’s awful penmanship—no return address, though Tony supposed he didn’t need one. His father had occupied the same townhouse in London for most of Tony’s life.
Yinsen stiffened. "Excuse me?"
"Has it helped?"
Mrs. Barnes greeted them at the door. She wore a fashionable and somewhat daring deep blue dress, her auburn hair swept up and adorned with pearls. In the candlelight, it was easier to see how beautiful she was.
"Oh?" he asked, faux-cheerful. "Is this the bet about which of you will confess your undying love for me first?"
"Important's overrated."
glad if you were to walk with us, Lord Stark! And you could check in on Mrs. Keener as well."
"You're right, of course," he told Pepper, because the last thing he needed was for her to worry endlessly about it and better still if she thought he was dealing with things much better than he actually was. "I'm sure we'll be fine." Then, with a wink, he added, "But I'm still going to be over here, thinking earthquake-like thoughts."
Tony waved a hand. "I'm just doing my patriotic duty," he said. " Helping a veteran in need - I might start singing the national anthem." He snorted. "No, sorry, I wouldn't torture you like that. No one needs to hear me sing. But the point is, it's no trouble. Banner's an odd duck, but he's got a knack for medicine."
Pepper’s eyes widened. “Tony—” she said.
“Of course, of course.”
Perhaps this was finally it; the writ that would see Tony tugged home by the leash, however long it was, that Howard always had around his neck. Tony’s hand tightened on the letter, wrinkling the fine paper. He would be forced to sit among peers of nobility and listen to their thoughtless droning about laws and subjects that bored him to tears. He would be forced to abandon everything he’d worked so hard on here, forced to leave his projects unfinished. Tony ground his teeth. Gods be good, he thought. It was a nightmare.
Barnes' answering smile was not much of a smile at all. His eyes were cold. If Tony had been able to spare any of his concentration, he might have allowed a moment of revelation; clearly, Barnes had been informed about everything that had happened six years ago. That was not the face of someone greeting an old friend.
Tony would have. Not that there was ever a chance for that. For him, there never had been anyone else; the moment Steve Rogers had saved him from the back of a rampaging horse, had walked back into his life after years away golden and sheepish and intent on Tony, there was never any chance for someone else to worm their way in.
"Oh, late Tuesday night, I think? He was riding in the dark, silly thing." Peggy laughed again. "He is a delight, but he's rather odd, isn't he?"
"Honestly. You're both grown men now . . . supposedly." Tony resented the way she eyed him doubtfully, he really did. He had graduated university! "I know it can't be—comfortable, but surely you can make nice for a few hours for the sake of everyone else."
“May I see the letter?”
"I know you will do what you can," Yinsen said. "Thank you." He tilted his head and his wry smile deepened. "And don't forget to come see me again about that ankle. I'll be expecting you."
that?" one of the Navy men - Morita, Tony thought his name was - asked, brow furrowing.
Tony's smile was sharp. "For me, sure."
supposed to mean?"
“That’s it,” Fury agreed. “Welcome to Shield Hall, Lord Stark.”
“Very well,” he said. “I’ll be right outside, Mrs. Killian. We should check a few more things before I return to my clinic.”
Tony thought and thought. Pepper, bless her, let him with only the hint of a question in her face. But she was right—there was no one else with the time and no one else Tony trusted enough that he’d be able to leave without worry.
For a moment, Tony didn't think Rhodey was going to take the Captain's hand. When he did reach out, his grip was noticeably tight. Captain Rogers' eyes narrowed but he clenched back just as much until their handshake was more some kind of weird contest. Tony frowned. They released each other and Tony thought he saw Captain Rogers flex his fingers before he tucked his hand behind his back.
“You’re her landlord, not her brother or her husband,” Yinsen said. “These matters can only be discussed with family. If she wants to tell you, she will.”
Captain Rogers straightened, easy smile falling away. Tony resisted the urge to do the same as those blue eyes searched the room and came to rest on him.
Tony didn’t let the affect that name had on him show. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Fury watching him. Fury, unlike Peggy, had been around for much of Tony’s childhood. Their group had never spent much time near the Fury mansion unless they wanted to steal something from the gardens, but doubtless gossip had provided many tales of their exploits. Tony didn’t think anyone knew the full extent of Tony and Captain Roger’s relationship, but he wouldn’t put it past someone to have figured
Captain Rogers laughed; the same sheepish, boyish laugh Tony remembered so well.
“No! No.” Captain Rogers had taken a deep breath and then looked Tony straight in the eye. They’d only been eleven then, not even close to adulthood, but he’d looked like one right then. Tony remembered his heart beating faster. “I mean, Jericho is how we met, isn’t he? So when you look at it, I hope… I hope you’ll think of me. And you’ll smile.”
“Oh, uncle, it’s just that the stories in the papers are so exciting! Just last month, they said he captured one of the fleeing French warships!”
"Well," he said. "Now that they're gone, I think you and I can talk properly."
Tony lifted his chin as he turned to look at Fury. What was his
"We've heard a lot about you, Stark," Wilson said. "Everyone in town was surprised to hear of your return."
Tony didn't know what to make of his bewildered expression. Childhood was behind them, but surely they weren't so old that Barnes had already forgotten about it?
"—can't believe you never wrote to tell me you were
"It's—" Tony reached out and pulled back his hand before he could touch the objects in the corner. How did he even begin to explain? "It's just—"
"You're thorough." Tony meant it as a compliment but Yinsen's brow crinkled. "It's a good thing, doc."
Tony offered Peggy an easy smile. “We were friends as well,” he said to Peggy’s delighted gasp. “He and his brother both lived very close to Stark Manor.”
take on Sousa about poetry. He reads nothing but the stuff, drippy as it is."
Fury made an unhappy sound. “I  knew that damn school was a waste of money. I don’t know why I let Bella talk me into it.”
After dinner, Tony hoped to be set free but the party continued - the men gathered in the billiards room and the women in the parlor. It only took an hour before Tony excused himself and made his escape to the library for some quiet.
"Sorry to interrupt," he said. He sounded a little breathless and he cleared his throat. "I wasn't aware we were going to have guests this afternoon. Just a little curious."
Tony expected to hear—something under that statement. Judgement, a warning tone. After all, Tony was an Earl to be and Pepper was, to most people’s minds, a nobody—he had little business poking around in her affairs enough to know so much about her life. It was more than a little scandalous that he’d gone to  her house unchaperoned at all, though Tony had never really cared much for such things. But Peggy sounded warm and she was smiling at him.
Jarvis’s hard look said he was not fooled. “You were very close,” he said again, more meaningfully. “And while I have never been sure of the details, I am aware that you had a—falling out, of sorts, before he left to fulfill his post with the Navy."
here? I thought you said you’d never come back.”
"I'll check back in with Mrs. Keener. She's almost fully healed herself. Miss Toombs hasn't been feeling well - her father asked me to stop in and check on her as well."
Well. Tony deliberately didn’t think about the way he’d completely lost his head just yesterday.
Tony choked out a bitter laugh. "No," he said. "I mean, not really. When have I ever listened to Howard? When Captain Rogers returned from sea, when I saw him again, I—" Tony cleared his throat. "Well. I guess it didn't matter to me, what I'd promised my father. I wanted—everything Captain Rogers offered me. I was ready to propose by the end of the summer. I thought it didn't matter, Howard's approval. Except Obie... Obie said—"
Damn her. Tony straightened and turned just as the door opened and Captain Rogers came in, ducking his head so he didn't hit the frame. How tall had he gotten, exactly?
"I'm just saying maybe I'm not the best person—"
Tony could, but it would hardly be convenient to rent them in town when he was staying to keep an eye on Pepper. He almost suggested staying with her, but bit his tongue at the last minute. Tony had never cared much about propriety, but he was hardly stupid—even he knew that a single, wealthy man staying in a widow’s home would lead to all sorts of nasty rumors, no matter that Pepper was pregnant.
The morning the tenants were due to arrive, Tony walked Stark Manor.
"And more." Sousa sounded odd, a little high-pitched. "Lord Stark was kind enough to escort me on my way through the forest. He's been helpful in explaining some of the more unique types. A native eye, you might say."
The walk, at least, was pleasant. The heat of the sun soaked through Tony's clothes and the crisp breeze carried the smell of wildflowers and growing, green things with it. They made their way through the meadow of grass in front of Shield Hall to the road that led into the forest, forking toward town and following the river only about a half-mile in.
Saying all those facts together didn't make Tony feel any better.
"Come
He could have keeled over from relief as Harley appeared in the doorway next to Bella, his hands firmly on his hips. That was the second time this kid had bailed him out of an uncomfortable situation; he'd have to get him something nice as a reward.
“Excellent. I’ll do interviews tomorrow then, get everything settled. With any luck, they’ll have a whole household to welcome them when they arrive.”
," Fury agreed with an eagle eye spearing Tony.
He turned. Captain Rogers was in the doorway. Tony's voice died in his throat with a strangled sound and he involuntarily took a step back, bumping into the table. Captain Rogers' face flickered but it was impossible to tell what he was thinking. God, Tony thought, that smooth mask really did hurt. He thought he knew why now. Once, Tony had been able to read Captain Rogers' expression from the tiniest of hints. To have that intimacy stripped away just drove home what a precious gift he'd lost. At least anger would have been
"Hey now," he protested. "I'm not exactly investigator material here. Even if you don't think I'm involved, why give it to me?"
Eventually, even he ran out of things to talk about. When he fell silent, voice a little hoarse for the effort, he felt surprisingly lighter. He hadn't expected to feel any relief at talking to thin air. Maybe Bruce had been on to something - Tony had always dismissed his talk  at university about feeling catharsis from speaking to dead loved ones as nothing more then trite spiritualism. He'd have to send a letter to let him know he might have changed his mind; Bruce had always enjoyed making Tony admit he was wrong, not that he'd ever say so.
"It's not just people in town. Mrs. Fury said you'd courted Pepper before," Captain Rogers ground out. The words were wooden, a little awkward, as if he didn't know how to shape them. "She said you were—" His brow lowered. "You were engaged. That's why she thought you'd—"
Tony blinked up at him, taken aback. He'd grown so used to shielding himself from Captain Rogers' cold indifference that even the weakest nudge into familiarity left him off-kilter, heart beating faster. Captain Rogers met his gaze and—there, at the corner of his mouth, the tiniest tick up.
he,” he said. “And what exactly does
“I’ll survive,” he said and flounced out.
He’d known they'd moved in, of course. Coulson had been quite clear about the timeline. It was part of the reason he had decided to spend his afternoon at Pepper's, repairing bits and bobs around her house. He'd needed the distraction.
Oh, Lord. Tony had never breathed a word about what he'd gotten up to in that smithy to Captain Rogers; he'd been embarrassed at the time and later it hadn't felt necessary.
Tony hesitated. "Mrs. Killlian—"
Tony winced. He’d forgotten about that, actually.
Sousa raised his eyebrows. "From Steve, of course."
of it."
"No," he said and though he was making a play at derisiveness, his tone was fond. "He's never really been that good at keeping secrets."
. Tony pressed the heels of his palms harshly into his eye socket until he saw black stars dancing across his vision. He'd come running when Tony fell; he'd helped lift Tony into the carriage. Even when he only thought of Tony with disdain, he couldn't stand by and watch him be in pain. But that was no sign of a deeper affection - it was just confirmation of the Captain's own good, warm character. Still, the tiny moments have kindness and closeness had almost made his icy distance and hard words hurt worse.
"I only went down there a few times," Tony said, trying to sound snotty. He prayed for Bella to drop the subject. "I was never in his way! If he complained
Parker straightened. Tony had the feeling he was seconds away from throwing him a salute.
“I say you must be out of your damn mind.”
I shouldn't come," he said. "But it's not right! It was only a bit of bread and Harley's mother has been sick and they're going to take his
"On your head, then," Fury said, clearly wiping his hands of the matter. "If you're going down to visit Mrs. Killian this afternoon, take your little hellions with you. I don't want them underfoot."
burning. He was not going to cry. He had cried himself silly six years ago; he had no tears left.
"You can't seriously be angry at the boy for taking some bread, Fury," Tony said. "We both know you've got more than enough to spare."
Harley scoffed. "That's the best you can come up with?"
Tony doubted Harley would, but he knew that Fury's goodwill would only cover so much. Better to let the boy know to keep any thievery well-hidden.
"I plan to take in Mr. Keener and his younger sister as wards at Shield Hall," Tony said. Harley inhaled, quick and hard through the nose at the mention of his sister. Tony didn't look at him. "And I will be paying for the services of Dr. Yinsen to look after their mother until she has fully recovered." He raised his eyebrows as Toomes' mouth opened and closed in silent outrage. "Do you have a problem with that?"
It was a little odd to hear Mrs. Barnes list out this wifely fretting in her soft monotone. Tony would think she was putting on a show if he hadn't seen her with Barnes that night. Mrs. Barnes might fake a lot of things, but she hadn't faked that.
"Lord Stark," she said when it was his turn for introductions. He bent over her hand and pressed a perfunctory kiss to the back; her skin smelled of lilies. "I'm pleased to see you again under less dangerous circumstances. Have you recovered from your fall?"
"Last year, James was taken during a raid." She said each word carefully, with crisp enunciation. "The men who took them did worse than kill him as repayment for his actions against their countrymen. When Captain Rogers recovered him, he had lost his arm and much of his memory from before that imprisonment."
"Oh," he said. His brain was
"Is that right?" he asked. "I shudder to think what kind of tall tales have been passed amidst the townsfolk in my absence."
Had someone told her that too? He had no idea how often they spoke of their childhood or how fondly they remembered it. Tony himself regarded that time with mixed feelings; it had been some of the happiest years of his life, but it was forever tainted with melancholy now.
Tony rolled his eyes and made a face. Peggy giggled and Sousa smiled but the pinched expression on Captain Rogers' face deepened.
"Lieutenant Barnes, you
say about me? I hope he’s not pining away still. I’ve told him once and I’ll tell him again, sometimes people just aren’t compatible.”
“Mr. Barnes,” Jarvis said after a long moment. “I haven’t heard much about him since he went into the Navy.”
"Is this Mr. Wilson courting her?" Tony asked. He hadn't gotten the impression that Sharon was seriously considering anyone. "Or are they just friends?"
Barnes waited as Tony ambled out of the carriage, not reacting even when he knocked his bruise climbing out and made a low hiss.
She snorted. "All right," she said, indulgent. "Perhaps he
Jarvis cleared his throat. “As you were,” he told the servants and they dispersed with some covert glancing. Tony sent an amused side-eye toward Jarvis.
"I didn't think you were all that interested in train engines, Stark."
Fury didn’t confirm or deny, but, then again, he never did. He was a secretive man who kept all of his cards very close to his chest. It had always annoyed Tony, even as a child. There was a reason so many of Tony’s childhood pranks had been pulled on the Furys. He’d never met a more infuriating person.
Sousa looked at it. His brow wrinkled.
Tony distantly heard their merry promises to keep an eye out. His entire body tingled and his vision swam in and out, as if he were drunk or extremely tired. As the carriage jostled to a start, he had to hurry to grab the nearest railing to keep from falling over. He managed to look at the others as they pulled away, but Captain Rogers was not looking back at him. Tony stared at his fair head until they turned a corner on the forest road and the group disappeared from sight altogether.
“Fine,” Tony said and marched past Yinsen for the bedroom.
Pepper raised a hand to her mouth. "Oh, Tony." Her eyes widened. "Is that why you—?"
Yinsen paused. “I’m not at liberty to tell you that,” he said.
people,” Tony said.
“You want to go into town later today,” he parroted out of sheer habit. Pepper blinked, then scowled.
“Of course he’s coming,” Fury said before Tony could make some excuse. Tony looked over at him to find Fury’s eye firmly on Tony already. He frowned and Fury frowned back. “It would be the height of rudeness to refuse such an invitation,” Fury said. “They might think he holds some grudge against them. People would certainly talk.”
"Who?"
Strangely forthright. "Nothing on me to take tonight," he said.
Tony turned to the door. “Mr. Coulson said they’ll be moving in the day after tomorrow. Better get a move on, lots to do.”
“—ony?”
"Was she?" Peggy sounded surprised and pleased.
know anything about engines?"
The real answer was no, of course, but Pepper's indignant face was funny. Tony pretended to consider it and watched with well-hidden amusement as she got redder and redder.
Tony's ankle still throbbed as they made their way down the lane toward the forest path. He hobbled bravely on, gritting his teeth against the pain, walking at half the speed of his companions and ignoring their concerned looks. It wasn't that long of a walk back to Shield Hall, but at the moment it felt like a monumental trek. He was determined to make it without relying on his companions; they had already seen him quite at his worst today and he didn't want to give Captain Rogers any more reason to think him weak. If he had to crawl, he'd do that and not one plea for help would escape him.
“I’m sure,” Steve says, disbelievingly.
, licking into him. He cries out, fisting his hand in Steve’s hair, and Steve spreads his legs wide, hands a hot brand on the insides of his thighs. Steve licks and licks and licks, and Tony’s on fire, God, he’s burning, and he gets his hand around Steve’s cock, stroking, and Tony’s coming, coming like there are stars and planets going off behind his eyes.
Tony sighs and rubs the back of his neck. “I’m not good at that,” he confesses. “I’m not… I’m not good at the conversation stuff.”
Steve drags his hand over his face. “I didn’t… I didn’t want to fight,” he says, wearily. “I’ve had a long day.”
Steve pulls out his heavy, hard cock, pale and long between his fingers, the head beading with pre-come. Tony sighs, tilting his head forward, and Steve’s free hand works its way into his hair, threading through the strands, and gripping a good clump of it against the scalp.
He makes his way over to the dilapidated kitchen and runs a glass under the tap, filling it with water. He comes back into the lounge area and hands it to Tony, who takes it gratefully, happy for his fingers to clutch around something solid. The water soothes the wretched dryness in his throat, eases the knot in his lungs, and he drains the whole thing, placing it delicately on the table, where it won’t leave damp ring marks on the papers littering the surface.
“I don’t know what to think anymore,” Steve says, furiously, throwing his hands up in the air, his fingers clenching and unclenching around air, as if he wants to fist them in his hair. “I just don’t. You… you’ve been lying to me constantly, you disappear from the house and no one knows where you go, you’ve been acting so differently, and I don’t know what to think anymore. Today, today, after all the shit you gave me about my attitude when we fucked last night, you took a call from this guy that you’ve had sex with before, and you came up to me and you came up to our children and you
Abraham pulls down an overhead microphone, looking to the booth above the lab, waiting until Phillips is standing near a speaker. He taps hard on the microphone, and Phillips winces, holding his ear.
“What happened next?”
The car crashes back to the stage, and Tony winces, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Where would you have gotten the crowbar from?” James teases.
“I have a lot of scars,” James says, shrugging. “What’s a few more, huh?”
“At the other end?”
“Tony.”
“Natasha?” Steve’s voice cracks, and there’s a bleak look in his eyes. “Fuck it,” he growls.
Steve makes a grab for the bunch of flowers that Tony’s holding, but Tony slips out of his grasp.
Steve groans as he sinks into Tony, inch by inch, and it doesn’t feel the way it did during Tony’s heat, that all-encompassing fever being soothed by Steve’s cock; it feels clearer, with Tony fully aware of everything, the sensation of being split open and filled.
Natasha shifts on her feet, awkwardly. “I’ll, uh, I’ll leave you alone, then. Thank you for letting me come in, have a chance to explain myself. I hope… I don’t know, Tony, I know we probably won’t be friends, but I’m hoping that we can be friendly, at least, one day, maybe not soon.”
“Now, just step away from Mr. Stark,” Coulson replies, reasonably.
“I had no other choice,” James argues. “You wouldn’t have answered my calls. You wouldn’t have seen me any other way, unless I took you by surprise. Please, I need your help.”
“No,” Tony snarls, feeling that knife-edge of protectiveness grip him fully (he’s felt that for few and far in between people: his children, his husband, Rhodey, Pepper, Wanda, Sam, his mother when she was alive, Jarvis was the first). “No, I’m not…”
Tony frowns and peels it out, ignoring the way that it sticks to his fingers, and brushes off the dust.
Tony runs his tongue between the seam of his lips.
Steve leans down and presses his mouth to Tony’s knee. “I absolutely understand all of those things,” he murmurs. He clears his throat. “I want you to call me sir.”
Steve resolves to be the one to steal the adrenaline.
Howard is still stoic, still looking as though nothing can touch him – Tony aches to remove that veneer, to rip it to shreds and rejoice in the ending of it.
Tony shakes his head.
Sam sighs and rubs at his temples. “I don’t fucking know anymore,” he says, his voice flat, gravelly. “I am
Tony’s eyes roll skyward to catch Steve’s, the pupils blooming black, and Steve grunts, thrusting deeper into Tony’s mouth. Steve’s cock spills thick and hot in the next moment into Tony’s mouth, and he swallows him down, his throat flexing.
He kisses him, his tongue worming its way into Tony’s mouth, and Tony struggles, his shoulders twisting in Rumlow’s hard grip. Tony bites down, catching Rumlow’s tongue between his teeth, until his mouth fills with a sharp, coppery taste, and Rumlow shouts, pulling back with a furious look on his face.
He goes on to talk about Natasha, and Tony holds himself bunched tight, like he’s going to fall to pieces if he lets even an inch of himself from his binds. He tells Eshe about their relationship,
Tony’s brow furrows. “I swear–”
“Steve, he’s in love with Bucky Barnes. He’s always been in love with Bucky Barnes. I could see it…” he clears his throat. “I could see it in his eyes. That means…”
“I love you too. I love you so much,” Steve says, with passion that borders on madness. “And I promise you, this asshole, whatever it takes, we’ll kill him, we’ll do it together, and you’ll get your fucking justice.”
Rhodey looks up from his half-full glass of champagne. “I have to admit that I’m not exactly the kind of guy that knows anything about wedding dresses,” he points out.
“So, you believe me now?” Steve says, his voice still dragging like steel over stone.
Tony bares his teeth. “Obadiah Stane is alive. I don’t know how to explain to you how he is alive, but he’s alive. Whatever you did to him wasn’t enough. It didn’t kill him completely. He killed Pepper and Natasha, and he’s already tried to kill me and Steve half a dozen times already. The next time I fall asleep, I’ll be dead, because I can’t keep fighting him, and he has all the power.”
The cement scrapes at his skin, and there’s blood, he can smell it in the air, and he can feel it damp on his skin. When he opens his eyes, he’s on his back, staring up at the sun that bears down on them, and his body is aching, and his mouth is dry, and he can hear his heartbeat in his ears.
She’s asking a question none of them have an answer to.

James’ brow furrows, and he nods.

, it just makes me feel like… like I’m on the outside again, like she’s who you want, like she’s what matters to you more than I do-”
“And you understand that I
“I’m just glad you’re okay,” he begins.
Instead, he lays a hand on her shoulder, gives her the smile that he’s been giving to the press and all of the rich, pampered, gelatinous blue bloods he comes into contact with, and says, “Thank you, Natasha. I’m so glad that I know you.”
Tony and Abraham grin at the colonel, while Hodge peeks out from under the jeep.
“That is a very specific hatred.”
“Sir?” Steve stands at attention. “If you’re going after Schmidt, I want in.”
Tony frowns, a little discomfited. “Wasn’t it?”
Steve nods, even if he looks displeased, rising to his feet and getting ready to leave the bar.
Steve scowls. “Hey, Phillips was going to stick me in a lab. At least Brandt got me here.”
“Fuck,” Tony declares, when his lungs start burning and he has to pull away. “I forgot how good it is to kiss you.”
“You should have told me,” Tony rebukes. “I got full around the tenth dumpling or so. I would have given you the last two.”
Bucky stares at him for a moment, and then, he promptly bursts into tears, taking Peter from Steve’s arms so that he can clutch at Peter. Peter doesn’t hesitate to throw his arms around Bucky’s shoulders and kiss him on the cheek, and honestly, that just makes him cry harder.
The house is empty, and when he comes back to the living room, in front of the television, lies Wanda.
“Of course she did.”
“He is your brother,” Tony snaps. “Surely you feel some measure of anger towards me for what I have done to your only brother.”
Tony presses down on the gear shift and the gas, and they’re off, down the quiet street.
“His ma gave it to him. It used to belong to his dad,” James says, suddenly, and his face cracks wide open, as he tries to comprehend why he said that and why he knew that.
“Who vows to fight like a man for what’s right, night and day?”
Tony chews on his lower lip. “That seems like a stupid reason,” he says, defensively.
“Tony,” Steve says, sternly.
dirty,” he growls. “What the hell was that, huh?”
Steve draws him into a filthy kiss, even before he’s cleaned the come off his face, his hands sliding into his hair, and then, with a grimace, Tony is the one who’s pulling away.
There’s a deliberate silence that hangs in the air, as if JARVIS is quietly waiting for him to come to the conclusion himself.
“Oh, well, they’re really cute. What are… what are their names?”
“Yes, you are.”
Steve just stares between the two of them. “Is this how you talk to each other all the time?” he asks, almost sceptically.
Bucky’s arms tighten around him. “Then, we’ll adopt you,” he promises, and then, swings Peter up so that he can throw his legs over Bucky’s shoulders.
Tony’s tongue runs teasingly along the seam of him, which is shiny with a pearl of pre-come, and it tastes salty on his tongue, while his fingers press at the skin right behind his balls. He pulls back, letting his mouth lap suck at the head, quick and gentle
Steve runs his tongue over his lower lip, nodding to himself, and then, he rolls off Tony, perching on the edge of the bed. He runs his hand over his face and through his hair, fisting his fingers in the strands.
Without missing a beat, she says, “I would have protected you.”
“Neither have I,” Steve agrees.
Steve’s face crumples so quickly and so painfully. “I know, I know, baby.”
wanted you. You’re… you’re beautiful and intelligent and fierce, and you’re strong and full of pride, and I wanted you that very first moment that I saw you in that courtyard,” Steve says, with a passion that borders on madness. “But I’m… I’m eight and ten, and you are six and ten, and yes, two years doesn’t seem like that much of a difference, but it is to me, and you had never even left your lands before–”
He was a mouthy kid, too. He picked a fight with everyone, especially when he saw a situation he didn’t agree with, a boy who didn’t know how to take ‘no’ from a lady, assholes who yelled slurs, meatheads who were rude, stupid, who made fun of people for cruel, hurtful reasons; he picked a fight with all of them and got his ass handed to him, every time.
Tony sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. “It’s not about forgiveness,” he says, haltingly, his face strained. “It’s about not being able to go back in time, James. Too much time has passed; too much has happened, to you and to me. It’s too late for us. We can’t… and I don’t want to go back. I love my children, and I love my husband. I do. He’s hurting me; he’s hurting me a lot, but I still love him. I still want my family whole, and if I… if I let things change, if I left him for you-”
After all, these are the things you do for love.
“I took one look at you, and any… any strength that I was trying to muster to do what SHIELD would have wanted me to do, I… I couldn’t, I just couldn’t. I was hurt, and I was so fucking angry, but…” Steve looks away, the lines of his body knifelike. “But I didn’t care what you’d done to me. I didn’t care if you’d been using me. I would’ve let you walk out of here, even if it was with the Winter Soldier.”
Maybe there will be one day where he can look at Natasha and talk to her and not immediately think of all the times that he imagined Steve losing himself in her beautiful body, her unburdened shoulders, her white skin, her lack of children and responsibilities, all the awful things that he’d thought about himself and his appearance and his inability to hold Steve’s interest.
. FRIDAY, override. Do whatever you need to. Get me my suit.”
She doesn’t either, but at least she has ideas.
“I have nothing to say to you.”
She knows.
There’s something coiling at the pit of her stomach, winding up, up, up, beginning to slither towards her chest for her to process it, to see it, to
everything she has seen.
She stays silent just to prove a point, doesn’t make a single sound, a single move. After a minute, he sighs and lowers his head.

The biggest problem isn’t that. It’s that ultimately, her own standards raised to resembles his.

This time, Steve walks away. She lets him.

She stays quiet, stays where she is, but mostly out of shock.
His memory is perfect and he is patient, so he allows it to go on for a while.
, to keep both her body and her brain occupied. It’s the only way she can get a respite from the tremors that haven’t stopped in hours, from the ache in her left arm, from the hole at the center of her chest, from the burn emanating from it.
Her chest burns cold, sucking in photons and freezing her slowly, and her arm aches dully, itching to be numbed, and maybe it’s just her mind, but she feels like the tremors going through her are trying to shake her out of her broken body.

She fears she doesn’t know any other way of being around him.
He does it again, and again, and again. He rips the armor apart piece by piece, claws his way to the delicate flesh that hides underneath. He is merciless with the metal, discards the fragments of it for someone else to clean up later.
Amidst her bafflement, she spares a brief moment to question for how long exactly that will remain true.
Toni is shorter, so much shorter than him, but she tilts her chin up, squares her shoulders, glares at him provokingly. Recalls the mocking way he spoke to her that day and eases her mouth into a slight smirk.
“The team?
His face falls, slackens in regret, maybe. Disappointment.
In the last hour or so of the trip, she manages to calm down a little. As much as possible given the situation, anyway.
. FRIDAY, do
Steve’s face is slightly confused, but mostly it’s gentle,
He left before the Captain could say anything else, climbing into his carriage and clicking his tongue for the horses. He wished it didn't feel like he was running away. He wished even wished Captain Rogers would, against all odds, ask him to stay. But he was silent as Tony made his escape, only watching as Tony directed the horses back to the road.
"Still as hearty as ever, that one. He'll outlive all of us." She turned to Peggy and eyed her. "In any case, we need to be going if we're to enjoy the weather before the sun sets. Shall we? There's a particularly nice walk along the edge of the forest."
Tony sighed. “No,” he said. “No, I’m afraid it isn’t.”
He hopped down from the carriage and collected the children's meager belongings. He jumped when he turned and realized Fury was right at his shoulder. He moved quietly for such a big man.
And yet, he still hesitated. The last time he’d seen her, they’d been screaming at each other. She’d thrown several books at his head. There was no guarantee the same wouldn’t happen again. Or, even worse, she might cry again. Tony couldn't stand to see Pepper cry.
He glanced at the letter again, stomach rolling. He had little desire to return to Stark Manor, which had once been his kingdom and was now only a source of unpleasant and painful memories. But if he didn’t do as his father asked, he was much less likely to allow Tony to stay at Cambridge. There was nothing for it—he’d have to return for the first time in six years.
He snuck a peek at her and winced at her trembling mouth. "This is why you said those things." It wasn't a question. "When I—when I confessed. How soon after all this was it, Tony?"
, idiotic things to do, this one really takes the cake, Tony Stark!"
He blinked, taken aback. "Very little," he said. "All the gossips say he was wounded in the war. I can see with my own eyes he's changed."
"He hasn't made anything formal," Peggy said. "Uncle Nick doesn't approve."
"I'd say I'm a genius, but it hardly takes one to read Mr. Parker's intentions."
He looked at the letter again, deeply troubled by the mention of those
Toomes foreboding look deepened. "Four bags of apples, three loaves of bread, a pound of ham, and a newly baked blueberry pie."
"But, I mean—you
A tiny snort. Tony froze and Captain Roger's expression twisted. He clearly hadn't meant to make the sound, especially loud enough for Tony to actually hear him. For a moment, Tony looked directly into his eyes and it was like time had never passed; they were boys playing at being adults, whispering jokes to each other in the dance hall, and Tony's biggest ambition in life was to make Steve break his stiff good manners and laugh like he meant it.
“It seems we have some exciting news?” Tony asked. “What’s happened now?”
talk about it. He's staying in your house!"
He didn't want to voice the sleepless nights he'd spent wondering if Captain Rogers' affections were actually solid enough to withstand all of these hardships. Would he want Tony if he was cut off from his family name, his fortune, his future? He hated thinking it, hated doubting one of the few people who had supported him for so long, but it didn't stop the insidious thoughts from lurking. He doubted himself too; surviving on love was all well and good in novels, but it was hardly as romantic in real life. He could make his funds through his inventions, maybe, but how was he going to get anyone to actually take a second look at them without the weight of his name to throw behind his eccentricity? And would he survive the long, lonely months without Captain Rogers when he was off at sea?
Goose was a good-tempered horse and just as fast as promised. Tony made crossed the woods and went over the hill in little time, pulling up into town within ten minutes.
of all people—"
"I didn't even know you could read, Dum Dum—"
Captain Rogers visited Shield Hall frequently enough that Tony couldn't relax altogether. He'd managed to avoid being alone with him again, but he was well informed of his comings and goings by the Carter cousins and it seemed everyone in the household was set on marrying Captain Rogers off to Peggy as soon as his intentions were given.
At the edge of the forest, it was easy to see the grand walkway up to Shield Hall was full of commotion, people moving to and fro, with a strange carriage pulled right up to the doors.
Was she doing this on purpose? Tony couldn't understand why. He bit his cheek so he wouldn't ask what else Captain Rogers had told her about him or why his reading habits had come up in conversation in the first place. He reached for the storage closet instead and opened it up, expecting to find the usual array of cleaning supplies. But the closet was mostly empty except for a few odd, large shapes bundled in the corner. Tony leaned in to get a better look and his nervous tension fled, leaving only surprise.
Tony was queasy at the thought. "Got it. He's got to be in some serious pain, then."
"You'll go to London right after?"
"I remember," Captain Rogers said. He sounded odd, almost a little uncomfortable. "Down to the river, isn't it?"
"And a cooling machine to keep food cold for hours?"
"No. He needs help, Mr. Toomes."
"What has the boy told you?" Toomes asked.

guy."
She stopped. Tony’s heart beat hard against his ribs. He knew who she was going to mention, the next name she’d bring up. If there was anyone Tony could be accused of coddling, it was
"And he never told you? Why he was so—unhappy?"
"Well." Tony considered the dark woods around them, Goose still sidling nearby, his bruised side. "It's not the best place for a first introduction. And I've never been particularly good at propriety."
Tony felt like he swallowed sand. He cleared his throat. "We were close as children. But you know how it goes with time and distance. We grew apart. We haven't so much as exchanged letters for years."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh yes,” Tony said bleakly. “Very lucky.”
“Retired, I’m afraid. He is having a very pleasant time in—”
Work was the only reliable release from the torment of his thoughts. He took some of his schematics for a design he'd been working on down to the dining room - the only place with a big enough table to hold the sheaf of thick parchment he used to draw them - and spread everything out. It was a relief to clean his mind of everything but work. Emotions were messy and difficult - machinery was clean and predictable. Safe.
He caught Sousa make a strange expression out of the corner of his eye. "Lord Stark—"
"It's about the robbers," Yinsen said at last. "There are rumors."
Tony blinked. He hadn't expected that. "Yes?"
"Lord Stark! Lord Stark!"
Jarvis could win awards in understatements.
That got Peter a harsh glare. Tony checked and almost smiled to see the pitiful look on the other boy's face. What an open book.
Captain Rogers reached in before Tony could think to try and stop him. With careful hands, he brought the little bundle into the light of the library candles.
Tony offered Sharon a flirty smile, silently cursing Fury in his head. "Definitely not engaged," he said. Sharon deflated. "I wouldn't do that to anyone, not when they couldn't really compete with my
Tony hadn't realized that anyone else was listening to their conversation until he heard a booming laugh from his left. Mr. Dugan leaned forward and clapped Tony on the shoulder.
Tony closed his eyes. A wound like that would have been debilitating to endure, he thought. And living with the aftereffects was not likely to be a walk in the park either—between the ghosting and the struggle to adjust to only one hand, there was always the potential for infection. No wonder Coulson had seemed sure Barnes wouldn’t be returning to active service.
"I can think of better things to see eternity in than a flower," Dugan grumbled.
"I didn't care much at the time. I was eleven, what did I know? I just wanted them to be safe on a good ship. So I said yes."
"My apologies," Sousa said, mouth twitching as he took in Tony's dishevelment. "I didn't expect to meet anyone out here."
She bowed her head, smiling just a little. "So I've been told."
“Lord Stark,” he said. Tony didn't bother to ask how he knew - even if he hadn't been around when Tony was a child, everyone had always told him how much he took after Howard. “What a surprise so early in the morning. What can I do for you?”
"Yeah, you. See if you hear anything, see anyone suspicious, that kind of thing. If you do, send me a message to Shield Hall." He considered. "If I'm not here..." He hesitated but he knew better than anyone that Captain Rogers wouldn't just turn away someone who needed help. "Send it Captain Rogers at Stark Manor."
Barnes didn't look convinced, but it wasn't like he was particularly easy to read anymore. He made a low noise in the back of his throat and shook his head.
Tony rubbed his face. "He forbade me from applying to university before I turned eighteen - he needed me here to look after the manor. I was to keep any of my strange inventions to myself. And when the time was right... when the time was right, I was to marry whoever he chose for me."
"Ouch," he managed to get out.
." Parker scowled. It was completely unintimidating on him. "I couldn't let Mr. Toomes cut off Harley's hand!"
Pepper tucked the tulip in the pocket of her dress. She examined him from head to toe, then exhaled, shaking her head a little ruefully.
this morning? "I doubt it," he said coolly. "I'm sure he expects me to disappear into the House of Lords as soon as I'm done with Cambridge."
Fury approve of?"
Awkward silence fell between them at the memory of their last conversation. Tony shuffled on his feet and thrust the flower at her again. This time, she took it, though she rolled her eyes a little as she did.
"My lord—"
“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “He’s here, then?”
The town was fairly quiet as Tony rode in with Peter behind him. They passed some people, who all stared up with wide eyes, but no one stopped them as they came upon the magistrate's house. It was a nice little place set at the far end of town; as they approached, the door opened and a tall young woman came running out.
"Admittedly, this comes from my own observations. I could be wrong about you. But I'm hoping I'm right and that I'm not mistaken asking you for help."
"Sorry," he muttered. "I just—I remember it. From school."
“Miss Peggy Carter,” she said, offering a short and somewhat sloppy curtsy. “And
“I think you’ll be pleased, Lord Stark,” Coulson said. “The lieutenant’s offer was more than fair. I’ve accepted on your behalf. If everything goes well, they’ll be arriving to move in the day after tomorrow.”
"The banns have hardly been read for them yet, Tony. Peggy is a lively conversationalist and you know she's always had an interest in sea travel."
Pepper chucked her roll of yarn at him. He caught and tossed it back, smacking her in the face. She sputtered at him, trying to lumber to her feet, and Tony laughed.
were the only flower thief among us!"
a lot of steve's attitude about tony will become clearer once we finally unravel what actually went down between them six years ago. I'm looking forward to cracking the chestnut but for now, steve's meanness does have a reason.
Yinsen seemed as surprised by the strength of his voice as Tony was. They stared at each other. Yinsen's sharp features softened just a little.
“Baby,” Pepper managed to say through her teeth.
"I wanted to forget it ever happened," Tony said into Rhodey's shoulder. "I was getting really good at it, too. King champion of forgetting painful memories."
But now there was a letter.
"I'll . . ." He turned back to the carriage, back to the door. Fury watched stoically, his uncovered eye piercing. "I think—"
“When are you due?”
Captain Rogers' eyes narrowed. He stepped forward, crossing the room to stand in the doorway of the closet. Tony shifted away, trying to ignore the warmth of him crowded so close.
Poetry was, largely, meaningless to Tony - he could appreciate a well-turned phrase or a beautiful line, but he had little patience for parsing it for deeper meaning or practicing the shape of the words in his mouth. Still, he could appreciate Sousa's recitation - he spoke with deep feeling and obvious love for the words.
next chapter may or may not have steve. this is persuasion - it's all about that build-up, yeah?
Freshly clean, Tony didn't waste time in finding a distraction. If he was without something to work on, he would only be able to think about Captain Rogers coming over to ask Peggy on a walk or Peggy's blush or the way they'd been standing before he'd barged into the room.
Tony rocked out of Rhodey's hug to stare at her. "What?"
"Many minds have tried and failed to puzzle out that very question," Tony said, all irony, before he could remember to censor himself in front of a lady.
Another thump that Tony took to mean Bella was swatting her husband again. "Have you seen the way he looks at her, husband? He is in love, I'm telling you! Don't you agree, Lord Stark?"
"Ah," he said and he knew his voice didn't sound right but he couldn't force the levity as easily as usual. Captain Rogers' brow furrowed. "Young love, is it?" He tried a wink.
The sheer idea made Tony’s chest throb, his stomach tightening into such a knot that he almost felt sick. He clenched his hands into fists, reveling in the harsh bite of his fingernails into his palm, the pulled skin of his knuckles. He needed to get a grip. It had been six years, hadn't it? He should be over it, shouldn’t he?
"I've been told so more than once."
Tony scowled at her and she gave him a no-nonsense stare back.
Tony could make a filthy joke but it didn't feel like he and Yinsen were at the right place in their relationship for that so, like a good patient, he bit his tongue and did as asked. Yinsen bent his head and returned to lightly checking Tony's sore ankle. He had a delicate touch and warm fingers. Tony relaxed a little, trying to keep his knee from jerking whenever the doctor hit a ticklish spot.
“A newly married man, my lord,” Coulson said. “A lieutenant in the Navy.”
? Courtship must be a sorry state of affairs around here if that's what people consider romance!" He made a disgusted noise. "
one of the things i knew going into this project was that tony's reasons for saying no to steve were going to be different than anne in the original persuasion - he and anne are so different personality-wise there was no way i could keep that the same and keep tony at least somewhat in-character. as for the robbers - some of y'all can probably guess the situation, but that's a thread that will unravel further on in this story. i do promise that it does tie in to the overall persuasion arc we've got going, but much like the failed proposal background, i added them in to make the story a little more tailored to steve and tony's specific dynamic & personalities.
Tony blinked at her. He had only met Pepper’s husband once, just after his mother’s funeral. He was a local man, a bit of a dreamer, with an eye toward enterprise that his frail body couldn’t match. Tony hadn’t liked him, though it had little to do with his designs on Pepper—he’d had a conniving, greedy attitude that had made Tony’s hackles raise. He hadn’t been happy when Rhodey had reported Pepper’s courtship and eventual marriage, but considering their falling out, Tony hadn’t felt he had the right to intervene. The last he’d heard was that they had moved into Pepper’s father’s cottage and Killian had been recruited into the army.
When Tony returned to Shield Hall that evening, it was to utter chaos. He stood in the main hall, watching bemusedly as Fury’s wife, Peggy, and her cousin Sharon all chattered excitedly amongst themselves, each one louder than the last. Fury, ensconced in a chair in the corner, looked aggrieved and long-suffering. Tony winked at him and Fury rolled his eyes.
"My mother's ill," Harley said. He didn't sound upset about it, but he was tense again. "She can't work anymore. That's why I was stealing." He hesitated. "My sister was hungry."
Captain Rogers' stiff expression shifted into something rueful. Tony wondered if he was remembering, like Tony was, how often he'd been the one to try to keep Tony in bed when they were children and Tony was sick or injured. He would come up to the Manor and read to Tony or distract him with questions or tell him all about the town gossip.
"I think I know you," she said. "That is, if the stories are true. You're Lord Anthony Stark."
"Hold on, I want to see this mysterious equation!" That was Sharon, down at the other end of the table. "Show the table, Mr. Sousa!"
“You’ve been invited as well, of course, Lord Stark,” Peggy said. She was less obviously excited than her cousin, but her cheeks were certainly flushed as well. “Lieutenant Barnes asked for your attendance specifically. He and his wife wanted to thank you personally for letting them use your home.”
"Enough. I believe his punishment is unnecessary, Mr. Toomes."
"Harley Keener," Toomes said. "He's been making a nuisance of himself this month. This is his fourth time being caught stealing food." He gripped the boy's shoulder; his hand looked enormous on it. "Look up, boy. Lord Stark has taken an interest in you."
," he said which was an astounding lie on any day, let alone to the person he'd run further away from than anyone else.
“Aldritch died, Tony,” Pepper said. “He died last year. Just before the war ended.”
Tony didn't back down as Toomes met his eyes. They stared at each other for several moments. Toomes clearly expected Tony to fold and he seemed more and more annoyed as Tony continued to look back at him without doing so, keeping up his pleasant smile the entire time. Eventually, he lifted his hand from Harley's shoulder.
Tony stared at her. “Rhodey wouldn’t have left you like this,” he said.
Tony didn't think he could bear it, especially not after Captain Rogers and Peggy were married. It was hard enough to witness Peggy's soft blushes and obvious happiness now, to see Captain Rogers warmth and goodwill directed elsewhere.
“You already know who I am, so let’s leave off all that nonsense,” Tony said. “This is an emergency, doctor. Mrs. Killian has had some sort of accident and she's injured."
“False contractions,” Pepper said. “It’s not uncommon, this late in the pregnancy. Dr. Yinsen said it’s unlikely to happen again so long as I don’t over-exert myself.”
, Tones!"
"Do you believe the rumors? About me?"
Tony heard Mrs. Barnes laugh behind them. "Now I really
It wasn't long before the shadow of Shield Hall appeared in the distance and they pulled out of the protection of the trees. The lights were all out in the windows; doubtless, most of the household had gone to sleep before Tony had decided to go out. He sighed a little as they pulled up to the stables. Fury was not going to be happy with him tomorrow. Maybe he could downplay things a little bit or even hide the situation entirely. The last thing he wanted was a lecture.
"Mr. Keener," he said as he took the seat opposite Harley. "Sounds like you've been busy."
beautiful." Sharon leaned toward Tony conspiratorially. "And stylish! She told me she's had all her dresses made just for her by a famous dressmaker in
"He promised to keep it a secret and he swore he'd support us, but he persuaded me to wait to propose," he said. "To give it some thought. And that was my downfall, really. I thought and I couldn't stop thinking about how Captain Rogers could—disappear during the war or how I didn't want to spend the rest of my life cloistered up because I couldn't afford university. My doubts weighed me like an anchor and I started to second-guess everything."
"To be honest with you, Lord Stark, I worried over him for quite some time. That's partly why I made the trip out here."
"You're shattering my idyllic view of country life here, kid."
Dr. Yinsen's eyebrows rose. "Your family is in such desperate straights you're leasing your ancestral home, Lord Stark. And we may not be in the height of society out here, but your father's—
"I still do," Tony said. "I'm taking some time off to deal with my family affairs, but I hope to sit for my master's soon." Peggy's eyebrows rose and Tony offered her a smile. "Engineering is my focus," he said. "My father would have preferred something frivolous like philosophy, but I found I needed something to study with a bit more meat on the bone."
"Why not?" Rhodey's scowl deepened. "I can call him whatever I like when he breaks my best friend's heart."
"All the same, I'm surprised. You must know as well as I do that my husband won't welcome your help."
"Does he talk about the past often?" he asked.
Finally, he sighed. The sun was warm and intense overhead; he took off his jacket and spread it on the ground, loosening his cravat, rolling up his sleeves, and slipping out of his accursed boots. His ankle was difficult to ignore after so much movement and standing, so he carefully lowered himself to the ground and sighed in relief as the ache eased.
"Well," he said. "The thing is, I know someone who could use some help. A friend of mine, she's pregnant and she's not supposed to do anything too strenuous until the baby comes. You'd be a big help."
meant, but the look in Pepper's eye warned him against it. Instead, he turned his attention back to her stomach. Pepper had always been a slight woman--her pregnant belly made her look like she'd swallowed several watermelons.
, but—"
"Traitor. What's she been telling you?"
Jarvis’s brow crinkled. “Your father wrote you?”
He strode away without another word. Obviously bewildered, Sousa offered a longer goodbye and hurried after him, struggling to catch up to his speed. Peggy frowned after them, hands on her hips.
"I couldn't walk home," Rhodey muttered into Tony's shoulder. "Had to stay the night and listen to you whine about the prick the entire time.
"I am not going to say a word to him." Tony pointed a fierce finger at her. "And neither are either of you. It's for the best. We wouldn't have worked out."
. Peggy, didn’t I tell you to just ignore him?”
Tony smiled at them. "I'll be just fine," he said. "I wouldn't want to slow you down. I'll come along to the Wilsons in my own time and meet you there."
"Not really." Tony shrugged. "I can walk on it without limping, anyway."
When he was a child, Tony had thought there was no grander place in all the world. The manor had been his own personal kingdom, a never-ending playground. He’d known every nook and cranny of it and the surrounding grounds, the bustling town down the river, the thick, dreamy woods that separated their property from Baronet Fury, their closest neighbor. He’d known every tree stump and field and cow. While his parents preferred the London townhouse, Tony had loved Stark Manor with all of his heart.
“Rhodey didn’t even like telling me you got married,” Tony said. “What? He's not here? Where the hell did he go?"
Barnes?”
Her hesitation was so visible that he didn't actually believe it. She was too self-contained, he thought. She didn't wave her emotions like a flag to be seen by everyone around her. If she was emoting, then she wanted to see him to see her hesitating and if she wanted that, it must be for some purpose.
It wasn’t a large box. He’d bought it in town when he was fifteen, from the local antique store. It was a beautiful little thing, made of rosewood with tiny starburst inlays along the hinges. Tony had wanted it immediately. When he’d brought it home, he’d dithered for weeks on what to put in it—it was too large to keep odds and ends, too small to house any clothes or knick-knacks.
Captain Rogers, however, recognized the trick. His eyes flashed and his mouth tightened. He took a step forward. Tony had never been afraid of the Captain before and he wasn't now, but something between them went taunt with that little movement. A thickening in the air made Tony's skin prickle.
"Go ahead and find Mrs. Fury and tell her you're in my care," Tony told Lucy. Harley frowned at him, but grabbed his sister's hand and vaulted out of the carriage, carefully skirting around Fury. "She's much nicer than this old bear!" Tony called out after them.
"I really think you should
Tony couldn't tell if the low hum that Captain Rogers made was a noise of approval or not. He swallowed, ignoring the dryness of his throat.
"Fine, fine," he said, holding up his hands. "No, I am not going to spend every minute today wishing for an earthquake."
?" Harley scooted forward, focusing on the schematic on the table. "For what? A train?"
That made her fierce look soften with amusement. "Get in the buggy, young sir, or you'll see how I go about punishing those who don't follow my orders!"
Pepper crossed her arms over her chest. Her face was approaching red now, a sure sign of temper. Tony would be warier if he wasn’t utterly distracted by her
"No." Tony held up his hands. "No, no, no. We're not going to talk about Captain Rogers. Hell, let's not talk about the past at all. Let's get some drinks and relax and celebrate Pepper's impending lack of sleep when her baby finally decides it's time to enter the world. Okay?"
Tony made a face. "Thirty's just around the corner, Rhodey," he complained. "I've been 'all grown up' for a while."
Nobody stops him. They see the red on his hands, see the blood that covers his fingers like the gloves that come with his uniform, and they let him go.

we’re in the middle of something more important than your resentment?” He isn’t quite shouting, but his voice is louder than it was before. “Even after all these years, after everything that’s happened, are you really that self-centered still?”
The streets rage around him and the air howls in his ear, but it all becomes background once he sees him again among the chaos.
is standing to one side, Romanoff to the other. Front and center is the only face she wants to see: Rhodey’s, tired and worn but with a soft smile and shiny eyes.
It lasts eons. They dance around each other, move back and forth to the rhythm of their mutual destruction, both of them working to prolong it, prolong the inevitable, prolong their destiny.
“Why do you keep bringing him up? Can’t you leave him alone?”
“Rogers,

—under the force of his knuckles. The edges of what remains of the helmet dig into his cheekbones and jaw every time his head rocks sideways, slice the thin skin and the fragile veins and the weak muscle to grind against the sharper points of his cranium.
“Scared of your reaction,” Steve says, honestly. “I was scared that you’d blame me.”
Tony has fucked up his kids so much that his son, at four, is already worried about what people would think of him so he wanted to protect himself from that, protect himself from the judgment of people around him, keep up appearances by making another drawing that seemingly displayed his happy family.
Tony nods, after a moment.
His body sags, and there is come on his belly, and Steve is grinning between his legs, his mouth damp with Tony’s slick.
Howard looks sheepish. “I did say a few years, didn’t I?”
“Let me guess, strip club?” Tony taunts.
Tony bites his lip in anticipation and climbs onto the sheets. “On my hands and knees, on my back, on my stomach? What’s your poison, handsome?” he asks, coyly.
He loves Steve Rogers.
“Shit,” Steve hisses, staring at the burn and the sharp, jagged cuts on his forearm, which is bleeding freely, bleeding a lot more than Tony had assumed it would.
Toni sighs and turns onto her belly. “You could fuck me in the ass, while you use the vibrator on me?” she offers, sliding her hand across his belly.
Tony purses his lips, the air looming stagnant in his lungs. “I had to talk to them about it,” he whispers, “about the photos, what we found. I had to ask them. They said that, well,” he clears his throat, “they said that they hid it for my own good, that they wanted me to live my life without what he did to me hanging over my head, that they killed him because they wanted real justice and because he deserved it, pretty much everything that I thought they’d say.” He purses his lips. “Well, I suppose it all would have worked out if Obadiah didn’t come back from beyond the grave in our dreams to kill us all,” he says, dryly. He shakes his head. “Did you get the stuff?”
“I’ve never done this before,” he confesses, gnawing on his lower lip. “I’ve never been with an alpha.”
With incredible swiftness, Tony backhands the needle into a far wall, which shatters the glass into a million pieces onto the floor.
His shoulders are broad, but narrow, bony with lean muscle, muscle that he hasn’t lost after all these years, the benefit of being a veritable blacksmith in this day and age, even if engineer is the more appropriate term.
“I hope you brought enough for yourself,” Tony tells her, softly. “I assume you’ll be eating with us.”
And then, time passes, weeks pass, months pass, years pass, and Steve gets married to Natasha, has lovely, white babies with her, and stops visiting his first family, his first husband and the kids from his first marriage, and Peter and Maushmi, as they grow up and their father stops caring and visiting, lose their kindness, turn into cold, reserved human beings, who don’t believe anyone when they say that they’re loved, and only believe the fact that their father inevitably abandoned them for a new, more socially conventional and racially acceptable family, and it’s all because Tony wasn’t good enough for Steve to stay.
“It was disgusting; that’s what it did to me.”
“Huh,” Steve says, surprised. “She’s usually so nice to me when I show up with the kids.”
Tony snorts. “I shudder to think what is considered troublesome details.”
“Yes, I do!” Steve insists, fiercely.
“You can’t… promise me you won’t,” Tony says, suddenly, his voice sharp, reaching out to clutch at James’ hands, so hard that his nails dig into the skin. “Promise me, James. Promise me you won’t

“I made you think that too, I made you think that I could leave you, that I could ever tear myself away from you.” Steve drags his hand over his face, and when Tony gets a good look, he can see the tears in his eyes. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry about everything, the lies and the shit that made me look like I was cheating on you, because I couldn’t do that. I love you, I love you as much as I loved you when we first met, before the kids came along, and frankly, I might even love you more, today, after we’ve built a family together, after you helped bring Bucky back to me.”
“I don’t think you’re crazy. I just want you to sleep,” Maushmi snaps.
“Don’t talk about him like that,” Tony says, with a dangerous edge to his voice. He looks away. “I was above the age of consent.”
