With a soft grunt in pain, Peter managed to sit up straight. Never had he been this grateful for toilet paper as it had broken his fall. He shook his head and looked at his side, noticing Quill’s legs sticking out of the soft purple pile. He snorted, serves him right! His eyes then grew wide as he now came to realize he was one person short. ‘Loki?’ he called out but got no reply. Shit, Thor was going to kill him. ‘Loki?!’
‘You’re forgetting the skin tissue underneath the victim’s fingernails, that could be a sign of a struggle.’ Sam noted, ‘What do you wanne do, Rogers? Should I sent someone to pick up Miss Potts?’
‘Could you please stop doing that?’ Thor said as he raised his finger to interrupt the man. ‘It really gives me a headache.’
‘Do you and Thor share a room?’ Steve asked kindly at which Loki nodded, explaining that he did not like to sleep alone. ‘Did you have a good relationship with Mister Killian?’
It took Tony a few minutes to realize that the blond had been awfully quiet. He pushed himself up, skin sticking against Steve’s as it was covered in a thin layer of sweat. ‘Rogers?’
‘O-kay,’ She quickly shook her head to rid herself of the slight confusion a polite but forced smile on her face. ‘I am
‘Sure is,’ Steve agreed as he looked ahead, then turning to the raven again. ‘Would you like to draw with me?’
‘You will follow me and won’t touch anything,’ Stane announced as he unclasped his seatbelt, ready to step out of the car. ‘Understood?’
‘You’re programmed, right?’ he impatiently pulled the machine out of the sorry excuse that were his clothes. ‘I want you to tell me you want me. Beg for me. Can you do that?’
‘Yeah, I know,’ A grin formed on Tony’s lips. ‘Quite surprising that I’m here considering this is my home. Now tell me; who are you and what do you want?’
So, first of, thanks for all the AWESOME reviews you guys left me! I really didn't expect this fic to turn out this popular, thank you all so much!
Again, I really hope you enjoyed it. I do have plans for writing a second one... Marvel - and the murder on the Witch...
‘Daddy gave him to me before he fell asleep in the hospital.’ Her smile slowly reached her eyes as she looked at the rabbit. ‘He’s very ugly, but I love him.’
The two panted and stared each other for a moment, their breathing finally stabilizing as they wrapped their arms around each other, their lips meeting yet again in a gentle and loving kiss.
Quill stared at the god for a moment and then laughed, ‘Yeah, right, can you imagine? Lokes and me skipping merrily through a meadow with those little self-made crowns made of daisies?’ The Ravager snorted sarcastically, but as the god of thunder still looked at him with a questionable expression, he quickly continued. ‘No, man, I just need to borrow him for a moment as a translator. You see, normally I would use the translator imbedded under my skin in my neck, but Drax broke it during a fight over the last chocolate chip cookie so... and Loki’s got Allspeak, right?’
‘Everything’s fine, Peter! We will be down in a minute!’ Tony shouted, followed by a sigh so deep the three could hear it down the stairs. They kept their gazes towards the stairs, their eyes widening as they saw Tony finally leaving his room. He was wearing a baroque-style suit, his Breeches stopped at the knee, with white stockings worn underneath and heeled shiny black shoes, which had large square buckles. The man's long, narrow coat was trimmed with a leaf-pattern braid and all the fabric was in yellow-ochre and gold, except for the white stockings and white dress shirt.
‘The captain must have taken shelter in there,’ Thor said, trying to look through the windows, hoping to spot the beast. ‘We should proceed with caution…’
The doll didn’t move until they arrived at an all too familiar building. Steve stared at the mansion, at the marble steps that lead up to a grand door. He recognized the casement windows and velvet curtains, the beautiful statues adorning the driveway.
He screamed as an electric shock coursing through his body the moment his fists collided with the door. He jolted backwards, feet slipping down the first step of the stairs causing him to tumble down.
‘Not to worry, he will be quite alright,’ another unfamiliar voice sounded, causing Loki to stare past Wanda again. ‘Please, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Vision.’ The android smiled, ‘and you must be Loki. The effects of your spell are quite intriguing, I must say.’
With a deep sigh, the god turned on his other side once more. He would have to talk with Loki once all of this was over.
‘God, it’s been ages since I watched a Disney movie,’ Tony yawned as he stretched his arms and legs, almost punching Steve in the eye as he did so. ‘Good call, kid.’ He smiled and looked at Peter who was sitting next to him.
Loki had closed his eyes as he placed a gentle kiss against his boyfriend’s lips. Norns how he hated himself for bringing his friends in this senseless situation, but at the same time, he was very grateful for the teen to be by his side. As his heart started to beat at a normal pace again, the voices seemed to quiet down as well. They did not disappear, not completely, but it was more of a distant murmur now.
‘Well, if you ever need me, or change your mind,’ Strange said as he turned around, holding up one hand and waving the other in circles to create a portal. He then turned around and looked at the god again, ‘you know where to find me.’
Whatever was in it must be heavy, for the scraggly man had to use all his strength to wheel the box inside. The stranger huffed before walking out, sand and dirt falling from his shoes and staining the marble floor.
‘I don’t have any evidence, not yet. But I’m sure we’ll find some if you could give me and my team some time.’ Steve tried, but already saw that Fury was not buying it. He had to come up with something better.
He needed to walk; he knew he had to for it was his master’s order, but he couldn’t. His feet seemed glued to the floor, every muscle refusing to oblige.
‘I-I,’ the raven stammered as he tried his best to sound strong and determent, ‘I am Loki Odinson, second born child o-of Odin Borson and Frigga Fjörgynsdóttir a-and prince of Asgard!’ he stated, his hands formed into softly trembling fists.
Strange didn’t move a muscle. His facial expression stale as he stared at the god. ‘Thought you would say that.’ He sighed before showing a slight smile. ‘Maybe it’s for the best. I don’t even want to imagine what a nightmare your brother would be during puberty.’
A careful smile formed on Steve’s face, the blindfold still covering his eyes. He seemed… relieved, though Tony was too engulfed in his own pleasure to really notice. ‘Maste-’
‘Are you questioning my good intentions, cap?’ Tony asked, pretending to be offended as he crossed his arms.
Standing in front of him, wearing nothing but a tight dark blue bodysuit, was a man. The playboy froze, not wanting to see the look on his own face as he stared at the divine body in front of him. The man was tall, hair blond and shoulders broad. His waist was small, legs strong and every muscle clearly visible beneath the suit. His eyes, however, were still closed.
They ordered pizza by night which Tony handed Steve with a smile, then hesitated a little as he realized a robot didn’t need any actual food.
Before Thor could even react, the two were back in the hallway where they started, the god nearly losing his footing as they shifted rooms again.
‘Hey kid,’ Sam started, his eyes locked on the captain who was still running down the tracks and he smirked. ‘Wanne pull a prank?’
Tony’s voice finally reached the doll, pulling him out of thoughts. He looked at his master with fear in his eyes which soon ebbed away as the billionaire pressed a gentle kiss against his lips.
As the playboy sang the last note, a gentle breeze moved through the trees, his clothes dancing despite the heavy rain while Tony made a twirl, birds chirping loudly.
Loki and Sam stopped a few feet ahead, both laughing as they saw the captain get back on his feet, though Loki rather seemed to laugh along with Sam rather than at the prank they just pulled.
‘That would be a child, I think,’ Natasha Chuckled and she looked at the archer with a smirk. ‘Surely you should know.’
‘Hm,’ Stane hummed, though it was not clear whether it was out of amusement or disappointment. The man then glanced at the floor, watching a cockroach crawl by. He looked at his property again, a wide grin forming on his face. ‘Grab that.’
A light switched on, though it was not in the corridor. Tony squinted his eyes as the curtains on the second floor opened, revealing a young teen. The boy’s tousled hair covered part of his eyes, which he rubbed sleepily. He yawned and stared at the man standing on his porch, most likely wondering why the stranger was there in the first place.
‘What do you mean? Like ghosts?’ Peter frowned as he now looked around him as well. ‘You trying to say that there are actual ghosts here?’
‘Shall I go into Rest Mode?’ Steve suggested quietly, voice hoarse as he tried to please his master. He instantly turned his gaze to the floor as he heard Stane’s footsteps coming to a stop, his hands clasping the sweatpants Tony had given him.
‘… No,’ Vision shook his head, ‘no, it was your brother, Thor, actually, who brought me to life with the use of his lightning and,’
‘Hello! Anybody in there?!’ Tony’s voice was loud as he leaned forward, waving his hand as the ex-soldier’s eyes were fixated on the grey walls of the room. ‘Killian tried to kick you back to Russia. He tried to send you to your death!’
he walked over and pointed at the body sitting silently on the couch. ‘This is nothing but a sex doll, a
‘I-I am eight years old,’ Loki replied shyly, staring at the large black eyes sewn into the red mask as he dared to ask; ‘Sir, who are you?’
‘Well…’ Thor hesitated, looking at the two Peters who were already getting their coats. ‘I don’t know…’
Loki jumped off the small stool he was standing on and quickly hid behind the captain, the highly questionable and, to him, plain scary expression on the soldier’s face nearly bringing him to tears. ‘I- I am truly sorry!’
‘Is that why you murdered him, Mister Barnes?’ Steve asked, compassion softening his voice. ‘To protect yourself? To protect the ones you now call your family?’
‘Using my last name, huh? That can’t be good,’ Tony chuckled as he entered the small bedroom of Steve’s apartment in his boxers, a glass of scotch in his hand. He walked towards the bed, smiling as he mentally compared his own cluttered apartment with the ever-so tidy bedroom of his partner. ‘What’s wrong, hot stuff?’ he asked as he placed his drink on the bedside table and joined Steve underneath the soft, dark-grey blankets.
‘Please what, Rogers?’ Tony grinned as he admired every inch of Steve’s body, his fingers trailing down the man’s perfect abs. ‘Tell me what you want.’
‘It’s always such a miracle how you solve these cases so quickly, Stark.’ Strange snarled in disapproval.
‘… Nah!’ Quill let out but as Thor’s look remained serious, he continued. ‘You’ve got to be messing with me, right?
‘I did not kill him,’ Bucky looked up, desperation shading his gentle brown eyes. ‘I had no reason to, not anymore at least. The threats started about half a year ago, but it stopped about a week after.’
‘Brother?’ Thor replied as he sat up straight, rubbing his eyes. ‘What is the matter? It is the middle of the night, you should be long asleep by now.’
‘We lost him,’ Bucky shrugged, not even looking at the god as he walked towards the game of chess, picked up a black knight and moved it on the board. ‘Checkmate.’
They had gathered in the living room of the large mansion on request, tension almost visibly vibrating through the air as Steve’s voice was the only sound that broke the silence. Miss Potts was sitting on the sofa, Wanda sitting left of her and Loki on her right. She nervously eyed the two detectives, her heart beating even faster as she noticed the two uniformed officers who had accompanied the two detectives and were now standing patiently in the corner of the room.
Tony wondered if the doll could even feel tired, as it was more likely that its battery would run out of juice. ‘Or maybe you need to be recharged?’
The billionaire glanced up the stairs before nodding, silently leaving the house and stepping into his car. He drove off, glancing in the rearview mirror one last time to see Stane slamming the door shut.
The raven uncomfortably placed his hands on his lap and fiddled with his sleeves, ‘I just like this kind of clothing…’
He held his weapon close, sneaking towards the man without making any sound. As he opened his mouth, ready to speak up, a portal suddenly opened in front of him with a wave of the stranger’s hand. Loki stopped abruptly, wanting to retreat, but as he stumbled over his own feet, he yelped and fell straight through the portal.
‘Mister Odinson, I’ll ask again,’ Steve spoke sternly, ignoring the girl’s remark. ‘Was Loki asleep in his bed the moment you entered the bedroom.’
‘Thanks,’ Steve chuckled as the raven scooted over and carefully placed his soft hands on the captain’s arm. ‘My brother said you are all warriors, he had not told me you were also artists.’
‘I will answer the door,’ Thor said as he quickly swallowed down a mouthful of stolen pancake. ‘Just make sure to save some of those pancakes for me.’
‘Doctor, such a pleasure as always.’ Tony smiled, though the sarcasm in his voice made it clear he was teasing. ‘Let me guess, the victim’s cause of death was falling from that window?’
‘They are amazing…’ Loki let out in a breathless whisper, causing the Avenger to look at him in complete surprise.
The blond stood up and turned towards the door again with a deep and loud sigh, ‘Alright, I understand. I’ll probably read all about it in the newspaper tomorrow. Good luck explaining this to the Chief Police Officer, sir,’ this remark caused Fury to look at Steve through his lashes, a grim expression darkening his face. Steve continued with a smile, ‘Well, Killian was quite the big shot, owns a lot of properties, has been into contact with the police on multiple occasions, yet we spends our time on archive work rather than investigating his death.’ The blond wrinkled his nose slightly as he held the doorknob in his hand. ‘Don’t think the Department of Justice will be too pleased to read that. Oh well, it’s your call, sir.’
Hitting the brakes as hard as he could, Quill somehow managed to dodge the old man. He threw his entire body into a sharp turn, causing the cart to spin out of control. One of the wheels hit the edge of a small promotion stand, launching the three Avengers into a huge pile of bright purple colored, lavender-scented toilet paper.
He pressed his eyes shut for a second as the image of Steve’s bloodied and semen-covered body came to mind. He didn’t want to hurt him, didn’t want the blond to do anything he didn’t want to, his mind than twisting over the fact that he was a doll and could not
Stane gritted his teeth, his voice filled with frustration and anger. ‘This is all your fault! If that little freak of yours doesn’t come back I’ll fucking sell you off on the black market! See how kind those people are to a fuck toy.’ He pushed the blond back to the ground, followed by a merciless kick in his chest.
The soft swing of a contrabass filled the air, blending with the tunes of the drums and piano. The song was slow and gentle, guiding a woman’s voice. Surface noise, originating from wear, misalignment and pressing defects, gave the music its characteristic crackle.
‘I see,’ Steve hummed in delight and tried to press his lips against Tony’s, but the man teasingly moved backwards a little each time the blond made a move. He looked at his partner in slight confusion for a second, but eventually just smiled as he saw Tony’s iconic smirk appear on his face. ‘I think I am starting to understand your situation, sir.’ He pushed Tony against the tiled wall and took a firm hold of his wrists, holding them above his head in one hand. ‘I will personally see to it that your punishment will fit your crimes.’
Thor slowly stood up from his seat, anger raging through his core and blazing in his bright blue eyes. ‘As I said, Mister Rogers,’ his voice was strained, his nostrils flaring as he took deep breaths. ‘I would have killed him, if I would have noticed that he had even lifted as much as a finger towards my little brother.’
‘Tony,’ Steve chuckled as he tried to resist the hands that were now slowly moving down his neck and to his chest. ‘shouldn’t we stay here and keep an eye on Loki?’
Loki looked down in shame, quickly averting his eyes towards the marble floor. ‘My apologies, i-it is just,’ he mumbled as he kept looking at the soldier from the corner of his eye, his feet dangling from the couch as he was just slightly too short to touch the floor. ‘Your arm, sir. I think it is truly amazing. You are, like, part Midgardian and part Destroyer.’
‘Thor, I didn’t do it,’ tears broke down the raven’s eyes as he looked at his older brother in desperation. He cried, sobs disrupting his breathing as Tony silently moved him out of the room. ‘I swear I didn’t do it!’
‘Uh, yeah, sure, there’s a refrigerator over there, help yourself,’ Tony pointed at a small white refrigerator underneath his work desk.
Jarvis opened one of the windows, knowing there would be no chance of talking any sense into his creator. He kept monitoring the stranger as he entered the building. The teen peeked into every room he came across, yet never entered one.
Tony let out a soft yelp as he was pushed against the wall again, his chest pressed against the wet tiles. He closed his eyes as he felt Steve wrap his hands around his waist and eagerly pull down his pants and underwear. ‘I think this might be against the law, sir.’ He panted, feeling the blond’s fingers wrap around his hard cock.
‘See you in a minute, Lokes,’ Peter smiled as he waved. His smile was short to last, however, as the towering god had now turned his attention towards him, a deadly expression on his face.
This won't be the last you will read of me, I promise! As some of you might know, A Tale of the Trickster and the Spider is still on-going, plus, I have started a new fic!
to, he really did, but there was this little voice in the back of his head that stopped him from uttering the words.
Thor wanted to open his mouth and counter the man’s offer. He wanted to say that he was wrong, that he would never consider letting his brother stay like this on purpose. He
The four continued to move according to plan. Peter in front to light the way, followed by Tony, Loki and Thor. As they reached the first level, they were quick to find the captain.
This new information only sparked more questions. Tony observed the box, fingers itching to open it. ‘So… nothing dangerous? Can you tell me who it’s from?’
‘Yes, I have succeeded,’ The raven snapped, his stomach suddenly twisting in an unexplainable feeling of rage and loathing. ‘So you have not to worry, I will soon cross the river Styx and return to the abyss of the deceased you doomed me to!’
‘Yes, I just tried to help you!’ As Loki said this, the other Avengers fell silent. ‘I just… You were so excited about this feast and you said you would do everything to win tonight’s costume contest, so I thought…’
‘No, detective Stark,’ Pepper said calmly though a hint of irritation vibrated in her words. ‘I was in bed,
‘The god of thunder… Thor…’ Loki looked at the blond for a second, then stood up and threw himself in his brother’s arms. ‘Brother, what happened? W-where are we?’ he asked, his hands holding onto the man’s shirt in clenched fists as he looked at the other Avengers from the corner of his eye.
It was only when the raven broke his character that Peter noticed he was holding his breath. He smiled a little nervously but finally relaxed as Loki’s eyes filled with love once more. ‘Well, that certainly is a very convincing costume… and act.’ The teen placed his hands on those of the god and gave him a quick kiss. ‘I didn’t expect anything less from you.’
‘Power of friendship?’ Peter chuckled as he sat on his knees. ‘Isn’t that the power of the good guys? I thought I was the villain.’
‘Then… who’s the kid on the second floor? He looked shocked to see us, or rather, to see St- the doll.’
‘It’s gonna be okay,’ Tony reassured, pressing another kiss against his temple. ‘I’m not gonna hurt you.’
‘No, no Loki couldn’t have done this,’ Wanda nearly whispered as she placed her hands in front of her mouth. ‘There must be some mistake.’
Thor’s eyes widened as he looked around himself, noticing that Loki was, yet again, gone without a trace.
Loki looked at the clothes he was wearing. A one-shoulder Greek toga draped down his body, covering endless white legs. A white satin rope carefully knotted around his waist, showing the god’s slim waistline. His alabaster skin in great contrast with the black fabric and black leather wristbands. His hair hanging lose, one side tugged behind his ear. ‘Yes, I believe this is a rather appropriate costume for this festival.’
‘Sure, Rhodey, it is a great story, actually.’ Tony chuckled as he wanted to grab himself a cup of coffee. He then sighed in irritation as he held up an empty pot. ‘Okay, who took the last coffee?’ He asked as he turned around and looked at the Avengers sitting at the table.
Peter looked passed the man, his smile slowly fainting as he spotted some scratch marks on the doorpost. They had damaged the wooden frame, splinters sticking out and a few dried drops of blood contrasting greatly with the white frame. ‘Do we… have a cat?’ he asked hesitantly, his hands clasped around the straps of his backpack.
‘Need a little help, dad?’ Peter offered as he walked up the stairs, seeing how Steve struggled to look through the small holes in the mask, the large paws of his costume making it almost impossible to hold onto the railing or get a proper footing on the steps of the stairs.
Tony frowned and looked at Natasha and Sam, who were equally stunned. The man grabbed his own coat and quickly followed the blond out of the police station.
A shivering breeze moved over the floor as the door opened with a screech, a steep stair leading into the basement greeting the teen. The fluorescent lights on the ceiling flickered, the musky smell of mold and dust overwhelming.
‘So, any news on how we can get your brother back to normal?’ Clint asked as he sat down next to the god.
‘Well then, it seems like we will be heading to our quarters as well.’ Thor stood up, his younger brother still in his strong arms. ‘I thank you for the movie and your company.’ The god nodded at his fellow Avengers after which he went up the stairs and walked towards the raven’s room.
Loki giggled, ‘I just wanted to say that I had a lot of fun today.’ He smiled brightly. ‘Also, from now on,
Bucky jumped to his feet, his eyes cold as night as he walked straight for the officers in the back of the room who were already pulling out their cuffs. He clenched his hand into a tight fist as the two officers warned him to stay back, the only thing keeping him from fighting being Wanda who jumped in between.
I have been trying to think of something which I haven't seen/read all that much, so these ships/ideas are not all that common :) (or at least, so I think ^^')
‘Oh yeah? Well what if I do this,’ Peter smirked, tickling Loki until he was squealing and squirming under his touch. ‘How you like that, War Machine?’
‘Loki, I think Lady Maximoff would rather bathe alone.’ Thor said quickly, taking his little brother from the witch’s hands.
Tony crashed his lips against the doll’s, his tongue forcefully entering its mouth. ‘I’ll give you more, doll.’
The blond seemed so helpless, waiting patiently for its master to tell him what to do next. Tony wanted to rip Steve’s suit off right then and there. ‘Come on, doll.’ He grabbed his hand, guided him into the bedroom and pushed him on the bed.
He stared blankly at his empty hands after swallowing the last bite, swearing he could feel the cockroach squirming down his throat.
I will be going tomorrow (24-11) and will be dressed as Thor in disguise! (Ragnarok version, when Thor and Loki visit Earth in search of Odin and meet Doctor Strange)
Loki glanced from the floor beneath his feet to his brother, his chest starting to heave. ‘I, I hope so,’ he whispered in slight panic. ‘For Norns sake, Thor, I do not want to become the keeper of souls…’
Loki observed them carefully, watching them talk together, laugh together. They did not seem hostile and it made him wonder whether he should ask them for help, or at least for directions. But he knew better. He was in an unknown environment, surrounded by strangers and, considering his surroundings, he assumed he was not even in the realm of Asgard anymore. He decided to stay low, maybe wait until nightfall and use the darkness as a cover to sneak out of this building.
The teen stared at the raven for a moment and sighed, ‘Lokes… how come only my dad transformed into his character? Why not you or me?’
blood, and as far as I am concerned that is not royal…’ he then mumbled, ‘though you always act like a spoiled prince, I give you that. You must first marry royal blood to call yourself one, someone such as,’ Thor first wanted to point at himself, but as he saw the playboy’s unamused look, make-up running down his down his face, he shivered and continued. ‘Someone such as the son of T’Chaka.’
‘Believe me, kid, news like that spreads like a wild fire in these kinds of pubs,’ the man smiled, offering the blond another drink. ‘You know, rumors had it that he-uh, that he did things, to kids,’ the sentence was balancing somewhere between a statement and a question. The man kept looking at Steve, hoping for any form of confirmation but he quickly continued as the blond looked back at him in silence. ‘Well, tell you this, if he would have been
‘Then we’ll get fired,’ Tony stated matter-of-factly and he shrugged. ‘but it won’t get to that point. I mean, we’ve been dating for a couple of weeks now and no one has found out, right?’
‘His name is Aldrich Killian,’ Sam continued to inform. ‘Forty-six years old. No wife, no children. He was a ruthless businessman, has made the news quite a few times for all kinds of charges but was never convicted. He started out with his own company about twenty years ago and quickly made it to the top.’
‘She is of to work. I tried calling her, but she wouldn’t pick up her phone. Bucky is now going after her, it won’t be long before they’ll be back.’ The woman looked up at the two men, their questioning gaze causing her to continue with a sniffle. ‘Bucky Barnes. He lives and works here as well.’
‘Yeah, quite literally, I heard. Listen, about him being a kid, what would you say if we make this spell permanent?’
‘This is so amazing!’ Loki suddenly shouted. He touched the mechanical wings and squealed even louder as Sam now activated the three miniaturized jet engines, housed in the backpack.
‘Nope, sorry, still a single child,’ Tony smirked as he stood in the door opening of the kitchen, two mugs of hot chocolate topped with whipped cream in hand. ‘Now listen, Peter, I don-’
‘I always hated that word,’ Pepper explained lightly. ‘Though you are not wrong. They live and work in the mansion, under my care.’ She turned her attention towards the blond opposite of her. ‘You wanted to know why them, right?’ As Steve nodded, she continued. ‘Wanda and Bucky have about the same story. When they came to the RRO they would not talk to anyone, did not even dare to look up, both too afraid of being tortured or murdered. They wouldn’t even speak to our interpreters. Most refugees open up to us at some point, eventually, but they didn’t. They would’ve both been sent back to Russia and Sokovia if they would not cooperate and I, well… I just couldn’t send them back...’
The sunlight blinds Steve's sight, he raises a hand to cover the light and glance to the alley, then Steve crossed the street and reach the alley in time to see two men, both wearing suits, one of them trying to pull the briefcase with the Tesseract out of Tony's hand who had a firm and tight grip on it. The other punched Tony's on the face, leaving a bleed scratch on his left cheek. Tony kicked the man who was pulling the briefcase on his stomach, which made him stumble backward. A spike of adrenaline flows in the super soldier's veins, Steve takes the other man by his back by his collar, pulling him away from Tony and punched him on the nose, it instantly starts to bleed, he punched the guy again and so many times, that the man hasn't had a chance to hit Steve, he fell knocked in the dirty ground.
After paying for everything, they change their clothes in the fitting room, thanking the salesman and the cashier of the store. Now they were properly dressed to the 70s. When they exit the place, Steve realizes that the sun is setting, he had lost complete sense of how much time they spent in the store. Of course, it was Tony's fault who took so long to choose his clothes.
Steve looked at his side to catch the view of two swans in the lake in Central Park. The color of the leaves turning into red and orange matches perfectly with the sky in the background. The reflection of the trees on the water makes it seems like a fancy bloody carpet, where the white colors of the two swans were untouchable. A fragile smudge. A pure thing in the middle of a contaminated world and those swans are still able to keep their purity. They say that swans mate for life, and watching those swans together makes Steve feels lonely. That’s an odd feeling for him. Loneliness. Steve never thought of himself as someone lonely. Though, it was true that since he came back from the Army a few months ago, he has never had anyone. It’s not easy to be a gay fella in the Army, and Steve preferred to keep that piece of information confidential.
Tony closes his eyes, taking a long breath filling his lungs with so much air that his chest clenches so hard that it becomes painful. Tears rolling thick and fast down his face, therefore he holds his sobs clenching his jaw until he feels his head aching.
“You’re good?” Steve mumbled, looking up to those brown eyes that he loved so much. Tony nods frenetically.
Everything in the restaurant shows sophistication, mixing the old and the modern perfectly. Luckily the place isn't crowded, which means that there are plenty of tables available, and, of course, they took the one next to the large glass windows with a splendid view of the ocean and the illuminated avenue outside.
"Hydra. Hydra wants the tesseract. They have people infiltrated in the Army. Some of them must've seen us."
"I'm worried because when... We can't go back and I have no idea how we're gonna do it. Th-That's all my fault. If I-I hadn't lost that fucking and stupid cube we would already be back, and everyone living their lives as they want to. It was a fucking ordinary mission and I fucked it up." Steve stops him putting a finger on Tony's lips, making him shut up. Tony was overthinking, and also in the middle of an anxiety attack, he was just worsening things to himself.
They haven’t had sex yet, although this fact doesn’t bother Steve since they were still getting to know each other. However, Steve can’t deny that he’s kind of expecting it. He had seen Tony almost naked a thousand times since they started to work together, which the brunet’s body was enough to make Steve aroused, and it was getting harder to disguise, now that they spent a lot of time together.
"Huh? I--" Tony stammers, looking back to see Steve closing the door. "I'd like to thank you, doctor Pym, for..." Tony switches the weight of his body from one foot to another. Hank looks confused at him, but he waits for whatever Tony has to say. "I--, actually, I'd like to say that I highly admire your work, these prototypes you're working on, uh." He whistles. "they're revolutionary. I'm certain that it's gonna help plenty of people in the future."
He has what’s he’s asking as soon as the blond slid his fingers out him, pouring more lube in his hands and rubbing it throughout his hard cock. Steve lined up with Bucky’s entrance, and the soldier had to hold himself to not push his ass back, but when Steve pushes forward, he takes it. He takes it all, feeling his walls slowly adjusting to the girth invading him. Both of them grunted.
The two men walk silently, both lost in their thoughts. This is a hell of a situation that they dive in and Tony couldn't stop thinking about his family, though he knew that Steve couldn't either. Did the avengers get the other stones? Were they safe? How much time has passed in 2023? They were supposed to be back in less than one minute.
"What are you doing?" Tony asks with a hoarse and sleepy voice, he attempts to stretch, but stops as soon as the move makes his hips and legs hurt, he's definitely a little sore, a quick and pleasant reminder of the sex they had last night. He rubs his eyes lazily to glance at Steve.
Then, he turns around and spots the pawnshop that Tony got in. When he steps inside he realizes that Tony is having a heated discussion with the owner.
Tony can't help but question himself over and over again. He feels an anxiety attack building inside him. The billionaire turns his gaze to the window, feeling the wind on his face while he's still in the road. It does not help, matter-of-factly. He digs his nails in the palm of his hands, expecting the pain to help him to focus on what really matters: Steve.
Tony reacts, leading Steve through the hallways while he groans in pain. This is his fault, Tony blames himself, he shouldn't have been so reckless, but at the same time, he knew he needed to do something. Tony shakes his head trying to push away his thoughts, he needs to focus on getting out of the warehouse while the Hydra agents were running to the place of the explosion.
Steve was the one who took most, he told Tony about his family, his parents, his childhood as a sick and scrawny kid in Brooklyn, he also talks about the war for the very first time since Steve had woken from the ice. He trusts Tony and he felt comfortable to open up to him, as the brunet has already done so many times, he confides his fears and his insecurities, being certain that Tony supports him, and for the first time none of them felt alone anymore. They could lean on each other, because if they have each other then they'll be fine.
Tony stood up with difficulty. He might have a concussion since everything was spinning around him, and his sense of balance was completely useless by now. He puts himself straight, his eyes never leaving the man in front of him.
Steve leans next to the exit, his face is covered with ashes and Tony supposes that his own face is probably covered it, too. Tony takes a breath, but he chokes on it due to the inhaled smoke.
"How do we gonna do it, then, genius?" Steve teases, which makes Tony's lips curled upward. "It's a 44 hours trip."
"Yes, doctor." He replies promptly. "I guess he maybe is out for lunch." Stark frowned to his answer.
"Yes, it is the latest technology, they said that the images are five times better!" She sounds excited to show her new acquisition.
Hank is talking excitedly about all his initiatives to bring young people to work as a scientist and develop a critical sense on their own projects, he also says that Pym Technologies are working on an exchange program for next summer. A student comes in their direction a little rush.
“That was messy, wasn’t it?” Steve said, turning Bucky around and placing a sweet kiss on his lips. Bucky put a lock of his hair behind his ear and raised a brow.
Steve looked at him, a small smile forming on the corners of his lips when Tony leaned in and met his lips in a tender kiss. Opening their lips slowly, enjoying the simple contact between them, before his tongue slipped in Tony’s, involved in the warmth of the model’s mouth. Brief, when they pulled away, pressing their foreheads together as Tony traced his thumb on Steve’s jawline.
"Fuck you" Tony spits, his hands clenched into fists. The man chuckles as he already expects that reaction. "Who the hell are you?" People are looking at him like he is a crazy man for talking with a piece of metal on his ear. The man ignores the question.
“Thank you,” Steve said, turning his back to look over the pictures and make sure that they were printable, or didn't have any blur.
“Huh,” Bucky drew Steve’s attention back to him, lifting his fork in a gesture as he spoke. “There’s this woman, she went to check in the new billboard for SHIELD Clothing in the marketing department. Natasha Romanoff, have you heard of her?” Bucky asked, but he didn’t wait for Steve’s reply. “Her photographer was fired for harassment, I guess, something like that. Anyway, I gave her your number.”
They appeared in the Army Base laundromat. It was empty, for their luck, because two men coming from nowhere would scare anyone, it also would be a hell of weird since one of them was wearing a SHIELD security modern uniform and the other, the Captain America's suit and shield.
Tony looks to his feet, upset. Steve touches his hand slightly and discreetly. He was tired of hiding who he is but knew that they couldn't risk it. Look what happened to Tony just a few days ago, he didn't want to pass through a situation alike ever again. One time was already displeased.
"You already told me that, Mr. Stark." His arms fell loose on his sides. "Besides, that is not an option. As I was saying, we need someone with your expertise. Have you imagined what you can offer to the world?"
Tony sighs, completely overwhelmed by the view of it. Okay, that's far from unexpected. It definitely wasn't supposed to happen, none of this was supposed to happen, actually, Tony had put them through this, but right now he has no time to regret it. They both know there is no solution to find here, with the technology available in the seventies Tony is not able to make another one, or even test the safety of it if he succeed to recreate it one day.
Then, he was sent on a mission to rescue a crew of soldiers held captive by a terrorist organization known as HYDRA. Turns out, Bucky was part of this same crew, and when they were back in Afghanistan, they went to several missions together, which one of them make Bucky lost his left arm. That was the end for both of them. Bucky was sent home, and Steve finished his period in the Army, getting back as soon as he was discharged from his duties.
“More,” Bucky said. It sounded muffled because of the cushion, so he said it out loud. “More, Stevie. More. I need more.”
"Trust me..." Steve sucks his neck, leaving a beautiful and red hickey on it. "I do." Tony finishes. "Get off of these clothes." The billionaire complains, bossy as always.
great. Steve tasting every inch of his mouth, Tony letting his hand sliding on Steve's side pulling him closer, their bodies appreciating this proximity, Steve's hand going and resting on the back of Tony's neck, deepening the sensation.
"Go ahead, you can do it, Tony." She said reassuring, telling Tony that he could admit his feelings.
I believe some people might be disappoint by this end. I wasn't certain about it, as I wrote this fic I was always wondering if I should change the end, because that was what I was planning since the beggining. I decided that I'd stick at this end. After all, death is something that we are all affected, and no matter how painful it is to live without our loved one, it's still worth. It's hard, but life keeps going and we have to move on with this pain inside our chest.
Steve waits for Tony in the apartment doorway, while the brunet goes signs whatever paper he needs to and pay the rent in advance to get the keys. He gets back soon with the keys rolling in his fingers, they got in the apartment and Steve closes the door behind him before turns to the billionaire with a grimace.
“Yes. She works in Human Resources. Do you know her?” She asked, and quickly waved her hand. “Of course you know her. She was in the military.” Natasha murmured more to herself than to Steve, though the blond nodded affirmatively. Natasha handed a couple of documents to Steve. The soldier looked down at it before reading them attentively, ignoring Natasha’s firm gaze on him.
“So beautiful, Tony,” Steve says, a drop of sweat rolling down Tony’s hairline, and Steve leaned in to catch the Omega’s lips in a dominant, passionate kiss, exploring Tony’s mouth with his tongue, closing his hand around Tony’s cock, which makes the Omega’s back arches as Steve’s steady hand pumps his aching, reddened cock, his thumb spreading the drop of pre-cum on the cockhead.
Tony doesn't even try to stop the loud moan that comes out of his mouth when Steve pulls out and then in again. Steve's left hand hold his hips with a tight grip, Tony knows for sure that the blond's going to leave a bruise, but he doesn't care, he loves it, he loved to look himself in the mirror and find an unexpected bruise, of course, only the ones that remember him of the amazing sex he had with Steve that ended up in those bruises. His other hand is holding his lower belly firmly, stopping Tony from move.
Steve sats on the bed panting and putting his head on his own hands, covering his face, he breathes fast and short, clearly too overwhelmed by the bad dream. Tony's sat by the soldier's side, he rests his hand on Steve's shoulder again squeezing it, attempting to reassure the blond that he was okay, he was safe. It seems to work, because Steve passes his hand through his wet hair and turns to look at Tony, he looks thankfully.
For minutes, there are only Tony and him in that empty corridor where the open window and the strong, cold wind outside could give them both a severe case of pneumonia. Steve already had pneumonia when he was younger. God, he hated the winter season. He remembers that when he was younger, his mother used to keep him locked at home, all the windows shut and Steve could not even get closer to the front door. His only distraction was his sketches and Bucky that would come over and play with Steve, drinking hot chocolate and watching cartoons together.
"It's okay, Tony," Steve mutters calmly, rubbing his hand on Tony's biceps. "It's okay." He drops a kiss on his forehead.
However, the blood is quick by his side, holding him up and putting him under the shower. The cold water hit him while he still has his clothes on and he swears against everything. Steve helps him to take his clothes off and bath.
The sun was glowing on the horizon, the birds were chirping, everything give her signals that this is going to be a marvelous morning, but Natasha knew it wouldn't. Her mornings were not the same since the snap, it has been this way for the past five years.
Tony's brown eyes sweep the room. He notices that the bag he had brought from their old apartment was zipped, everything they had collected since they got stuck in 1970 was in that bag, already packed. Tony mentally thanked Steve for that.
"They've been looking for you, Captain, for years." The man coughs and blood comes onto his hand. "HYDRA will not give up now that they know you are alive and with the Tesseract." Steve's face is neutral with a relentless countenance, his jaw is clenched, he's angry.
Last weekend, Peggy was asking Steve’s advice for the flowers when Tony called him, inviting him to Stark Tower for dinner. Steve loves to spend time with Tony, so his answer was easy. At first, he showed Steve some of his creations in the lab, apologizing for his excitement, even though Steve loved to see Tony’s grin, and his happiness every time he was talking about his projects. So, after a few glasses of wine, they ended up cuddling on the couch.
The pub was crowded, the counter was nowhere to be seen since the people inside were leaned against it with their eyes fixed on the TV where the speaker narrated the game, people shouted at each score made and poured their beer on the counter and on the tables next to it every time they toasted a move was made. Tony wasn't exactly the kind of person who roots for teams or any other kind of sports, but being there with Steve was nice, watching the blond grins like he never has seen before. God, he was so
That's when everything went to hell. Because they didn't listen to the footsteps approaching, then a flashlight blind them momentarily.
Pietro seemed quieter than Wanda, he hasn’t talked much since they met in the elevator, but Steve could tell that the twin boy was, perhaps, a little bit protective over his sister. Pietro offered Wanda a cigarette that she managed very well between her fingers. Steve didn’t like smoking. The smell was just awful, and it never brings out good memories. Steve hated that smell along with the smell of alcohol. But Steve didn’t want to walk away and end up upsetting Wanda and Pietro on his first day, plus Wanda has been being nice all day, so Steve just muttered an excuse to get mint gum chicle in a magazine kiosk on the other side of the street.
"No, I'm just..." Tony stops when he looks the spot behind her, he puts his glasses on. It is small for the actual technology, but it is there, he can see it clearly. "Do you have security cameras outside the bakery?" He tries to sound casual, but there is too much interest and a certain excitement in his voice.
Bucky curled up his toes when he felt Steve’s fingers sliding up and down on the sole of his foot. The tickles turn his blood hotter and send it right to his half-hardened cock. Of course, Steve knew exactly how to tease Bucky to get what he wanted. Plus, the fact of the two being super-soldiers, they rarely didn’t have the energy for that kind of thing.
Tony takes another sip of his coffee, giving him a thumb up, the gym is just a few streets of the apartment, of course he'll be fine. He almost want to roll his eyes for Steve excessive care over him the last days, but he can't blame him to it, Tony was beaten up in the streets, if it was Steve in his place, he knows for sure that he would also be careful with Steve.
In the back of the office, there is a glass that separates the office from another room, the blinds were down. Steve watches Peggy got in the room on the other side talking with another woman. It's been a long time. So long. It was weird seeing the woman that he had fallen in love a few years ago, now she just looks a remind of his past. He was in love with someone else. Someone that couldn't correspond to his feelings, but he couldn't stop caring about him either. Steve sighed.
Even Thor, who spent most part of his time in Asgard or outer space, he missed him asking about 'Midgard's objects and habits' or telling stories about Asgard. He also missed reading the newspaper on the tablet that Tony gave to him when they moved in the compound, the Internet is really useful and he couldn't deny that he missed it badly. He never thought that someday he would miss all of this when eleven years ago he felt out of place and time in the brand new twenty-first century.
Tony nods adding milk and eggs to his mental list. They have to buy exactly the quantity that they are going to use, otherwise, they would waste it and Tony hates the thought of waste food so relentlessly. They will leave in three days, three days to get in Pym Technologies again, and take the particles they need to go back home, Tony can almost sigh in relief thinking about it. There is nothing to worry about, right? Everything will work according to their plan, everything is going to be fine, he tranquilizes himself.
“Yeah, sure. So, yeah. We never made it officially,” Tony shoves the pill in his mouth. “I--I just thought--”
Smoke rises from the sink when he lets the water drop into the burned pan, which only worsens the smell.
He feels his hole tightening around Steve's cock when he comes. White strips spiraling in the ceramic wall and Steve's hand, coming down his fingers.
Steve intertwined their hands as they came up upstairs. They stopped at the front door as Steve looked for his keys. He was never able to find his keys inside the pockets with the amount of trash Steve keeps in there when the door opened suddenly.
"By the way," Steve starts saying, Tony turns to look at him from the doorway. "It's 08:30 a.m. Better hurry up if we want to catch breakfast." The brunet doesn't reply, he closes the door, and Steve just heard the water running inside.
We're close to the end, and I'm happy to announce that this story is officially complete. I'll post it regularly now.
“Watch some movies, maybe,” Tony turned around to the sink, rinsing the glass. “What was that TV show you were talking about?”
He has no idea how he got there. His feet just remembered all the way he had made just a couple of days ago and led him to the place unconsciously. All the way down here the streets were dark and this part of the city wasn't too much crowded like the avenue they had gone through earlier, the only noise filling that street were his sobs. He felt stupid for crying, why was he even cry anyway?
He puts the portrait back to its place and makes his way upstairs. In the hallway, he hears giggles coming from the only door opened, he walks silently and slowly and stops in the doorframe leaning against it and putting one of his hands on his own hips, a genuine smile playing on his lips.
"I don't think they were successful. Hydra was exposed and taken down in 2014 by you, Natasha and Fury. We can't change this timeline, we would screw everything up." Tony says calmly, but he understands Steve's anger. After Tony learns that HYDRA was doing human experimentation, he stopped feeling bad for the warehouse.
Of course, the guy's friends didn't like it at all, the guy with a ridiculous orange jacket comes in his direction along with the one wearing checkered pants. Tony took a step back, if he turned the corner he would reach the apartment, he could run and get safe at home, but when he attempted to run the guy with orange jacket pulled the breach of his sweatshirt, which made him fall on the ground and scratch his forehead, he felt the blood sliding down on his temple.
Steve follows his way, he needed to find out where Hank Pym's laboratory was, so he could get the particles they needed to go back to 2023. He walks reading the names on the door, Armin Zola, Howard Stark, names he already knew, and a few others that he had never listened to, then he found it.
"Tony. Tony!" The blood pounds loud in his eyes making the shouts fade away on his way to the door. He didn't look back.
“I love you three thousand,” Morgan answers back giggling. Tony’s eyes full watered. He gets up and walks to the door, Steve was keeping the door opened so Tony passes.
"A fire devastated a warehouse in San Francisco yesterday, according to the Fire Department the fire started around 7:30 p.m. due to an electrical malfunction. The police say there were five casualties, including the director of the biomedical company, Thomas Pierce, and seven more injured. The victims were taken to the hospital..." Steve puts the TV in the mute, after seeing Tony's countenance.
They headed to Steve and Bucky’s apartment where they used to celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas, and all other holidays someone could think of. Steve was homelike. There was nothing better than staying in the comfort of the house. He only got out when Bucky, or Peggy, or Sam asked him for something. Although now that he was hanging out with Tony, he had been a little absent from his household.
She sighs concerned, rubbing her hands all the way on her face to her hair. A door opens and she turns to see who is coming in.
‘Mister Odinson, there is another reason why we are asking you this,’ Steve started cautiously, though he maintained eye contact. ‘We did some research on Mister Killian. There have been charges pressed against him for sexual abuse.’
‘Right, but-’ Steve wanted to protest, but was hushed by Tony’s lips against his own. He closed his eyes, his muscles relaxing as he breathed in the man’s scent.
‘Hold on tight, kid.’ Sam smiled, placing Loki on top of his backpack, making sure the raven could hold on to the harness.
‘So… who are you supposed to be?’ Peter asked as he wrapped his arms around the god’s waist, ‘An ancient Greek version of Black Panther?’
‘What about the skin tissue underneath the victim’s fingernails? Something happened here that night, Stark, and I’m gonna find out what. Also, don’t you think Barnes reacted a little strongly when we asked him if anyone would have sex with Killian?’ He then looked over at Wanda, Loki and Thor who were all busy doing their own thing, yet remained at each other’s side. ‘And we haven’t talked to all of them, yet.’
‘Thor, you can’t go picking on him now that he’s smaller.’ Steve said as he picked Loki up, holding him in his arms.
‘I think it’s about time we did something about those,’ The grin on Stane’s face was almost feral. He closed in, holding the needle just above Steve’s eyes. ‘Not to worry, doll. Soon you won’t remember anything, anyway.’
With a shriek, the trickster stumbled backwards, tears nearly flooding his eyes as he now realized all eyes were on him. He looked around in a panic, his mouth slightly ajar as his breathing became shallow.
‘Wait, aren’t you surprised by this?’ Natasha raised her brows, not understanding why the soldier could stay so calm.
‘Well, this is me, and this is Thor, aaaand this is the bilgesnipe that tried to kill us,’ the trickster explained casually, a smile on his face. ‘You know, just an average battle.’
‘This is just going to end in one hell of a horror movie,’ Tony grumbled as he managed to pull his feet out of the mud. ‘Have you ever seen “The Blair Witch Project”? That’s what this is, I swear. And then one of us will suddenly disappear and the other’s will start screaming and yelling and apologizing in front of a hand-held camera, and given the fact that I’m of royal blood,
‘Mind your heart, Stan,’ Tony said as a slight smile finally formed on his face again and he raised his glass. ‘Never knew you had a brother.’
‘What can I say, Rogers? Murder is an emergency, I’m sure she’ll cut me some slack. We’re colleagues, after all.’ The other countered with a confident smile, dark sunglasses covering his eyes. He looked up at the building, his mouth slightly ajar as he stared at the old, yet stately mansion. ‘How fancy.’
Steve leaned into the kiss, wanting it to last forever, but as always, Tony had other plans. He felt Tony’s lips move from his lips to his jawline, to his neck and down his chest. Before he knew it, the other man was on his knees, his mouth teasingly against the head of the blond’s already leaking cock. Steve threw his head back and gritted his teeth, his fingers wondering through Tony’s hair as the playboy pulled down his boxers and wrapped his lips around his cock.
‘-We were just about to leave,’ Steve spoke, interrupting Tony who had already jumped up from his seat to face the older brother. The blond stood up, following his partner’s lead as they both walked towards the front door. ‘Ah, yes. One more thing, Mister Odinson, why did you not tell us that you were with Mister Barnes the night of the murder?’
Tony blinked his eyes in complete surprise. He opened his mouth, wanting to ask him how he did it, but Steve cut him off.
‘Don’t worry, Rogers. I know what you want.’ He smiled gently, vulgar words whispered soothingly; ‘You want me to fuck you. You want me to fill you and ride you till you are nothing but a drooling, moaning mess.’ Tony grabbed the doll’s wrists and roughly pushed them into the matrass above the man’s head. ‘You want me to take full control. To leave you utterly helpless as I make you scream and beg for more.’ His grip on the machine’s dick tightened, causing the doll to squirm and whimper.
‘Could be,’ Steve shrugged. ‘Problem is we don’t know who’s blood it is that was found on our victim, so really it could be anybody.’
Steve laughed sheepishly, wondering how he should have interpreted Tony’s double entendre this time. In the end, he just decided to lean forward and give his boyfriend another kiss.
Just a few more minutes, Thor thought as he closed his eyes again, his arms wrapping just a little tighter around Loki.
‘So, you want to defend Earth, uh, Midgard, right?’ the playboy asked as he straightened his back, his voice strong and determent.
‘What?’ Peter asked after raising his face from the cushion and gasped for air, ‘Oh, you mean this?’ he asked as he looked at his suit, ignoring his father’s remark, again. ‘No, dad made a modification to my web fluid formula, so I took it for a spin after school. Nah, I’m just beat from classes all day. Sometimes I just think mathematics teachers are out there just to make life harder, I mean, you try and figure out how-’ Peter then stopped and frowned as he only now noticed that the captain was sitting at the salon table on the floor, a board of chess in front of him. ‘I didn’t know you played?’
‘I start to understand why my brother does not look at you in favor,’ Thor grumbled, leaning against the wall.
‘Loki,’ Wanda quickly moved forward, taking the crying child from the doctor’s hand. The raven immediately wrapped his arms around her neck as she pressed a gentle kiss on his temple. ‘So this is how the mighty wizard of time treats innocent children?’ She asked, glaring at the doctor, her words heavy with her Sokovian accent.
The raven then stopped as he heard the muffled sounds of music coming from a staircase leading down. At first, he thought they would probably lead to a basement but as he now heard a man’s voice singing along to the loud music, he could not help but wonder what secrets would be down there.
‘But the threats suddenly stopped,’ Tony continued. He folded his hands behind his back and casually circled around the table. ‘What did you tell him when you found out, Miss Potts? Did you threaten to throw him out of your company? To call the police? Maybe offered him sex in exchange for leaving your little family be?’
Tony tilted his head. He didn’t know Obie had a kid, and even if he did the boy now standing at the window looked nothing like him. The child, who didn’t seem much over fourteen, stood still for a second to observe him, then seemed about ready to close his curtains again.
Rain was falling from the once clear skies. It had started out as an insignificant drizzle, causing Tony to murmur and mumble, but as the drizzle then transformed into a curtain of heavy rain, the Disney princess just started to loudly complain. The god of thunder and the playboy walked on front while Loki slowly walked way back, Peter somewhere in between the three.
Loki didn’t look up, making Tony wonder whether the child did not hear him over his laughter or was simply ignoring him.
Thor remained silent for a moment and sighed, ‘that might actually work…’ He then looked up at the teen, a slight smile on his face. ‘My apologies, Peter, my reaction was uncalled for. It is just… I want what is best for Loki. I am quite certain mother would have been able to send him to bed with just her caring smile, but then again, as my brother had already stated, I am not her…’
‘No, I meant actual honey,’ Natasha smirked while Peter could not suppress a loud snort as he saw Clint’s slightly disappointed expression. She opened a drawer, grabbing a bottle of syrup and a glass jar of honey. She then turned around and looked at Bucky who was washing his hair in the sink. ‘You forgot to put this on the table, soldier.’ She said in a soothing voice, picking a crumb of pancake from the man’s cheek as she walked passed him.
‘This place…’ he started, voice low and heavy with emotions. ‘I wish- I really wish I could tell you what they want from you. Why you are here and what’s going to happen to you… but I can’t.’ He tried to stay calm, tried not to let Peter’s confused and desperate gaze get to him. ‘Stane adopted you, didn’t he?’
‘We don’t think anything, we just ask,’ Steve added calmly. ‘Do you think there’s anyone here who would-’
‘Killian could have made a fortune out of your business, but he couldn’t have it. And why is that? Because one woman was standing in his way, or better yet, four refugees. He was furious,’ Tony continued and then took a deep breath. He walked towards her, slowly, and placed the palms of his hands next to Pepper on the cold surface of the table. He leaned close to her, a smug grin on his face, ‘You want to know what I think, Miss Potts?’ He nearly whispered, clearly making the woman uncomfortable. ‘I don’t think your little family was as happy and loving as you proclaim it to be. I think there was definitely some tension between Killian and your four “cohabitants”. Killian wanted them gone, out of the house, making it seem like the four you saved used you, then packed their bags and left. Surely you would be willing to sell your company after such a shitty move.’
‘Did he-’ Tony started carefully, but Loki already nodded again before he could finish his question.
He leaned forward and hovered over the doll, a smug grin on his face as he saw Steve’s chest rise with fear. ‘
‘Are you not having fun, brother?’ Loki turned around and smiled. ‘Try to raise your arms, like this!’ The small trickster waved his hands in the air, feeling the breeze run through his fingers as Quill took another rapid turn.
The trickster could hear his brother’s words echo through his head. Thor was right, until now every person he had spoken to had been very nice to him. Loki wanted to step into the light of the hallway, but he jumped back behind the cabinet again as both his brother and the stranger were gone with the blink of an eye.
‘Anyone else got the feeling we’re being spied on?’ the man spoke as he slightly narrowed his eyes and tried to look past the two women, causing Loki to quickly hide behind the wall again.
Steve blinked at first, but then just smiled. Tony wanted to play a game and Steve was eager to participate. ‘Fine,’ he wrapped his arms around the man, puling him closer against his chest. ‘Tell me, sir, what is it you wanted to confess?’
‘It’s almost 90 degrees out there,’ Stark remarked, doubting the teen’s words. He sat next to Loki, leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms, ‘I’m sorry, I’m not buying it.’
‘I could give you a ride,’ Peter offered carefully, not really understanding why all the others were so reluctant to volunteer. ‘Hey, maybe the three of us could go!’ he looked at the young raven at his side with a smile. ‘Would you like that, Loki? Would you like to join me and mister Quill to the supermarket?’
‘How am I supposed to get down the stair like this?’ The captain responded, now sounding more beaten down than angry. The creaking sound of a door opening followed, and Steve stepped out of his room and into the corridor. ‘I can’t see a thing with this on my head, Tony…’ he pointed at the large mask he was wearing.
Steve stuffed his face, barely chewing before taking the next bite. He eventually looked up at his master, noticing he hadn’t moved an inch. His master stared at him, blinking his eyes. Steve slowly lowered his pizza slice, his cheeks coloring red, ‘I- I am so sorry.’ He only then realized his still had his mouth full and quickly swallowed. ‘It’s just- it’s been so long since- w-well-’
had to drink it. Tony’s face twitched in irritation as he remembered his seemingly endless arguments with the god of Sassgard. He then looked at that same god who was now hanging from his neck, hugging him with the most adorable smile Tony had ever seen.
‘Looks like Norse and Greek mythology really don’t mix well, huh?’ Peter tried to smile as he helped the trickster back on his feet. ‘We’ve got to find my boyfri- dad!’ Peter quickly corrected himself. ‘We’ve got to find my dad.’
The four of them fell completely silent, Bucky’s expression going dark within a split second. ‘Yes?’
‘Of course, Loki,’ the god said as he put the raven back on his own two feet again. ‘I will follow you in a minute!’ he quickly added, watching how Peter and his brother disappeared towards the outside training grounds.
‘With the national symbol of America as my witness,’ Tony said with a straight face as he pulled the captain to his side, one hand raised, on arm intertwined with that of the blond. ‘I am certain, o mighty god of constant concern.’
With a nod of his head Steve went over the young woman, Tony right at his side. ‘Miss Maximoff?’ he asked gently at which the woman stood up. ‘I’m Steve Rogers, Criminal Investigation Department, this is my colleague Tony Stark. I heard you found the body?’
‘You know what, Thor, you’re right,’ Bucky nodded as he grinned, ‘Next time, I’ll give him a bell to play with.’
‘That would be you and Tony.’ the god smiled, ‘You are brave warriors, just like me and Thor, so I drew you as well.’ Loki looked at his drawing with pride, he then looked at the captain, holding out his drawing. ‘Here, it is for you.’
‘Doctor,’ the god nodded as Strange walked towards him, a serious expression on his face. ‘For what reason do I ow this pleasure?’
‘Splendid, now has everyone got their sweets ready?’ Loki looked at the two Avengers at his side, all three of them holding the candy close to their lips.
.’ Steve smiled somewhat uncomfortably, now wandering what kind of place Asgard must have been like. ‘And who are these two guys?’ he asked, pointing at the stick figures in the corner of the drawing who were holding, well, they were holding something.
About thirty minutes went by before Natasha returned with a book in her hands titled; “Sherlock”. ‘Okay, this might not really be a children’s book but I think you’ll like-’ she stopped talking mid-sentence as she stared at the Soldier for a moment. ‘Barnes,’ she continued, irritation ringing through her voice, ‘where’s the kid?’
The god jumped up in his bed and quickly got dressed. Was his little brother okay? Maybe he had just gone downstairs to get some breakfast, or maybe… maybe, the spell had worn off… When would that have happened? Would Loki leave him in the middle of the night without saying anything? He could have at least wake him up, right?
Tony shivered at the breath ghosting down his neck, wanting nothing more but to throw the blond over his workbench and let his hands roam over his naked body. He turned around, every form of sinful lust disappearing as he looked straight into Steve’s tired, yet grateful face. ‘Hm?’
‘Okay, so you hold on tightly, like this… and then you try to flip it, like this.’ Steve explained as he flipped a pancake in mid-air, catching it again with his frying pan. ‘See? it’s easy. Now you try.’
‘Nah, Peter’s got that covered, plus, I think Loki was Nat’s responsibility. Or Barnes. I don’t know, I heard them arguing in the kitchen. I think they were looking for our tiny god.’
‘A super market?’ Loki repeated, tilting his head. ‘So, that is like, the Asgardian markets, but then “super”?’
Tony stared at the massive box that was delivered on his front porch, a frown on his face. The crate was slightly bigger than he was, the boxing revealing no name nor address.
‘Wanda Maximoff, twenty-three years old, born and raised in Sokovia, a small country in Europe. Came to America at the age of fourteen and now lives and works here as a maid.’ Natasha informed the two. ‘She found the body when she tried to close his windows on the third floor. Immediately called 911.’
‘But Thor, we always took baths together, remember? Hey, maybe you could join us!’ The trickster then looked at the witch again, ‘would that be to your liking, Lady Wanda?’
‘This what you want, doll? For me to fuck you into the matrass? To keep pounding into you till you can’t fucking walk anymore?’ Proving his point, Tony slammed his hips forward, burying his cock deep into the machine’s tight heat.
The doll knew pleading would be pointless as his master stepped out of the car. He took a deep breath to calm his racing heart, still wondering what he did wrong to deserve being send back into the hands of his former master. Maybe Tony found a malfunction. Maybe Stane could send him to his creators to get him fixed and then he would be good to take back in again.
‘Just because I like guys does not mean I like them all!’ Peter continued, ‘Now listen here, I love Steve! And you are with P-!’ the teen then quickly shut his mouth as he looked at the trickster on the ground, ‘with Peter…’ he mumbled. ‘Oh god, Lokes, I’m so sorry!’ He quickly moved to Loki’s side and helped him up. ‘Are you okay…?’
Peter tried to move back, his heart beating painfully fast in his chest. ‘H-hello…?’ he sniffed and whimpered as the sound did not stop, his lips trembling as he saw a foot stepping into the light. The teen quickly covered his eyes with his hands; ‘Go away! Please!’
bad.’ But as his boyfriend started to curl in on himself, Tony’s expression changed completely. ‘Steve!’
‘Thor?’ Another voice called out and the three men turned around, meeting emerald eyes. A young teen was standing in the large doorway, his hair black as a moonless night, his skin pale. He was wearing heavy boots covered in dirt and garden gloves, about a dozen roses and some green resting in his arms. His clothes covered every inch of his skin, which seemed rather odd considering these warm Summer days.
Thor remained silent for a moment as he thought this through. A chance for him to guide his brother, to raise him into a gentle and content adult. To not let him suffer all the horrors he had gone through. He had to admit, looking at it like that, it did not sound all that bad. His brother, placed under a spell for the rest of his life…
The scent of blood, sweat and disinfectant created a suffocating air throughout the room. All lights were dimmed to near darkness, the Operation Table next to Steve polished till it gleamed in what little light was left. The table tray adjust to it displayed a wide variety of instruments; scalpels, scissors, saws and syringes all neatly ordered and ready to use.
The woman stared at the god of thunder for a moment, her eyes trailing the god’s body up and down and a slight color formed on her cheeks. ‘I, I think I am fine bathing alone, thank you.’ She managed to say after clearing her throat.
He looked at the older god, noticing the golden hair surrounding sun-kissed skin. Loki sighed. How he had never concluded on his own that he must have been adopted was still a mystery to him.
The young teen looked up and offered her a weak smile. ‘Of course not,’ he held her hand in his own, trying to reassure her. ‘He’s our dad now. He loves us. Cause that’s… that’s what parents do…’
‘None. He said he finished walking his last security round through the mansion somewhere around twelve together with Thor.’ Natasha continued. ‘Then dropped Thor off at his room and went to bed.’
‘Never get used to what?’ Peter asked with a smirk as the two now followed the trickster in a casual stroll. ‘The fact that Loki now suddenly turned all cute and enthusiastic, or the whole rainbow bridge thingy?'
‘Ah… Yeah, of course there is.’ The man mumbled as he had to step on a chair to reach it. ‘Jokes about my height never get old, huh?’ His name was written on the front of the note. He turned it to find a short message;
‘Because my dearest Tony here made a bet with Bucky,’ Steve said as he placed a hand on his boyfriend’s shoulder, and although his words were kind, his voice ringed heavily with irritation, ‘and he lost.’
Stane merely raised his brow, unimpressed with the doll’s pleading blue eyes. ‘Did I tell you to stop?’
Natasha looked at the three men working in the kitchen, a smile forming on her face as she watched them slaving over the hot stoves. ‘Honey,’
them! My dads are gonna kill me when they find out… Oh no, wait, let me rephrase that, first Thor is going to kill me, then he’ll bring me back to life, and then my dads are going to kill me.’
As usual with all the Avengers gathered, lunch was one big chaotic but cozy mess. Steve and Clint had to work overtime in the kitchen now that the always hungry Guardians had come to join them. The two men were more than grateful for Gamora to offer them a helping hand, but she was quickly dismissed as all of her pancakes turned out crispy and, well, scorched.
A silence followed as Bucky continued to read his paper, now and then shifting his gaze from the printed texts towards the small god who kept staring at him. ‘What?’ he eventually asked, trying to sound as kind as he could.
It didn’t take long for Steve to step into the playboy’s workshop, the sweet scent of soap following him, overpowering the smell of grease and sweat. He saw the playboy and smiled, cheeks rosy and body wrapped in warm and comfortable clothes.
‘Cease your tantrum this instance, Loki! You have had dinner, now it is time for your bath and off to bed!
The raven silently nodded and slowly walked back towards the mansion, looking over his shoulder every few steps until he was inside again.
‘I think you’ll be surprised, kid.’ Quill laughed. ‘It was awfully nice from the shop owner to still let us buy these slurpees by the way!’
‘Don’t give me that look,’ Obadiah snarled, ‘Fuck it’s always those disgusting eyes!’ His hand wrapped around the blond’s throat and he pulled him to his feet. ‘Get on the table.’
‘This is Loki, sir. A spell failed and backfired, causing his body to degenerate to a child-stage form.’
Also, I was thinking about writing a Halloween themed short for tomorrow... anyone interested in that?
‘You live here as well, don’t you?’ Tony asked, looking at all the tools that were neatly hanging on the wall. ‘What do you do for a living? Don’t assume you’re a maid, huh?’
‘Look at them, as if they are a family.’ Pepper nearly whispered as she lowered her tense shoulders. ‘Mister Rogers… Aldrich’s death has to be an accident… It just has to be.’
At that moment, Peter received a swing of Steve’s arm to his stomach, causing him to fall against Tony’s legs. The four men looked at the captain as he squirmed on the ground, his face towards the wall. The costume that he wore, it… it changed. The horrible tangled brown fabric changing into soft fur, the paws on his hands and feet slowly growing into actual claws. The fake tail that first laid motionless on the floor now moving agitatedly and in uncontrolled motions, sweeping from one side to the other.
‘That man tried to place a curse on me,’ Loki murmured while he was sitting on the kitchen countertop, looking at the marble floor. ‘If it was not for my brother, he would have cursed me…’
Tony’s movements picked up speed, the sound of skin slapping and the playboy’s moans breaking the silence of the bedroom. The smell of sweat and sex filled the air, though soon another scent mixed in as well. A scent Tony could not quite grasp.
Without a hint of reluctance Steve dug his teeth into the remains of the cockroach. He bit it in half, its gizzard ripping and spilling all over his tongue. The insect’s body fluids ran down the corner of the doll’s mouth and stained his skin. Each bite, each time he chewed, send shivers down his spin, yet he continued to eat. He felt the remnants of the bug’s shell stick to his gums, a leg stuck between his teeth.
Tony’s smile disappeared as the doll gazed at him. ‘I can’t wait to take you apart in my workshop and fix those creepy eyes of yours though…’
‘A-and this kid they were talking about?’ Tony continued, blind to the bot’s obvious anxiety. ‘He said he was yours, right? Do you have a son? How is that even possible?!’
Thor frowned worriedly as he trailed the god’s footsteps, noticing how the flora withered and died under the raven’s feet.
‘Shut up, inmate,’ Steve growled, pressing his groin against Tony’s ass. He moved his hand, gently at first, but soon pumped it up and down so quickly that the only sound audible in the room where his partner’s pleads for more.
‘It’s important to get rest,’ Steve kindly reminded him. ‘Please allow me to clean up so you can go to bed.’
‘These are togas, my friend,’ Thor said as he wiped a tear from the corner of his eye, ‘very different.’
the opposite of what I said, Peter,’ Tony sighed as he handed one mug to the trickster and one to the teen. He then sat down on the floor next to Steve, giving him a kiss followed by a quick smile.
He looked up at his master, ocean blue eyes begging, though he did not even know what he was begging for.
‘Easy, big guy,’ Tony said as he crossed his arms and rolled his eyes. He already knew that the god was overprotective when it came to his brother, but it seemed like this has only become worse now that Loki was a little kid again. ‘your “baby” brother is playing in the backyard with Peter. No stress.’
‘Are you ever going to cease your complaining?’ Thor managed to intervene with a deep sigh. ‘You are of
‘I love you too, Stark,’ A smile finally shined through on Steve’s face. He tilted his head slightly to press his lips in the palm of Tony’s hand.
‘Some cuts and nasty bruises caused by the fall, the head trauma being the cause of death,’ Strange said as he sat in the chair opposite of Steve’s desk. He stirred his tea, the autopsy report neatly placed in front of him. ‘There was alcohol in his blood as well.’
‘We still have nothing,’ Steve rubbed his tired eyes. ‘Let’s go have a talk with our youngest suspect. See if we can get anymore information out of him.’
She peeked inside and saw that the large bedroom was empty. The bed was perfectly made, the large television hanging from the wall broadcasting the early morning news. She tilted her head, then sighed in irritation as she noticed the open casement window through which rain was pouring in. She placed her tray on a table and walked into the room with big steps. She leaned slightly out of the window to close it and cursed softly in her native tongue as her clothes soaked in the rain.
‘Booze, sex and then die right after,’ Tony remarked. ‘What a way to go. Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase “happy ending”, don’t you think?’ He looked at Natasha with a smile at which the woman threatened to hit him on the head again. Though Tony did manage to raise one side of her lip which he counted as a win.
‘They are mine!’ Loki shouted and he laughed, charging straight towards Peter and tackling him to the ground. ‘Evil shall never triumph over good!’ he raised the small stick above the teen’s chest, holding it tightly with two hands.
‘Nonsense, you are a growing man, Peter,’ Thor laughed as he grabbed his own glass and handed the other to the teen. ‘This will make you strong,’ he added with a wink, not noticing the unamused expression of the captain since it is hidden under his mask.
The doll immediately tensed as his master called his name. All the tenderness and warmth was ripped out of his voice, leaving a shallow sound. His chest tightened with anxiety, causing him to fall back into his old habits. ‘Yes, master?’
‘So what do you want to do now?’ Natasha asked as she sat down on the corner of the blond’s desk. ‘We still don’t know whether the victim was murdered or if it was just an accident.’
‘Thanks, kiddo,’ Steve mumbled as he took Peter’s hand and, with a little help of his son, finally made it to the bottom of the stairs.
Anyway, here's the next chapter. It's not as funny as the others, but I think it's kinda cute and gives some explanation on how/why Loki is living with the Avengers in the first place. :)
It was then that Loki started to open up, little by little. He had brought Peter carefully selected fruit, and at some point, told him short stories about himself, which were usually nothing more than a few lines, but still. It was then that the other Avengers saw what the god of thunder had seen for centuries. Loki was a good person, he just needed time and a helping hand to show him kindness and compassion.
Loki stared at his concoction in anticipation for a full minute, but as the potion remained serene, he smiled proudly. ‘This should do it,’ he nodded confidently as he turned to his table again. He grabbed five champagne glasses, which were standing at a corner, and placed them next to him, filling them half with one of Tony’s expensive champagnes and half with his potion. He now needed to add one last thing.
Also, as some of you might already know, I am Dutch, so if you find any spelling errors or syntax mistakes, please let me know! I absolutely love learning languages and I'm trying to write as authentic as possible!
‘He’s my younger brother, turned sixteen last week. I would appreciate it if you would leave him alone.’ The blond’s voice was low, making his sentence sound more like a threat than a favor.
As our most beloved and sorely missed King of Wakanda once used to say; "I never yielded, and as you can see I am not dead!"
Steve stared in front of him for a moment longer before meeting Fury’s gaze. He responded with a soft grunt, leaving the man’s office without another word.
The two glared at each other for a moment but then started to laugh. ‘Same time tomorrow?’ Clint asked as he stored his bow in a specially designed case.
‘So the four of them are all refugees and they all live in Potts mansion,’ Steve concluded and then looked at his team. ‘but why?’
His hand trembled however at the thought of the number of corpses who had rested on this very same mattress.
Tony’s disbelief quickly turned into full-blown anger. He turned to the doll still siting silently on his bed, his words dripping with frustration. ‘Where was this?’ he asked as he paced back, raising his voice as he continued. ‘That syringe- is that why your eyes-?! What was in there? What did he inject you with?!’
But a loud, booming sound made the playboy close his mouth as the floor trembled beneath their feet. A phenomenon like that could only mean one thing.
"Watch your back, Captain." The soldier got the man by his collar, raising him from the ground, the man laughs unafraid, looking straight to Steve's blue eyes. "Hail Hydra." That's his final words before bits the pill inside his mouth.
Therefore, he snuggles himself against Steve comfortably feeling the supersoldier wraps an arm around him protectively. Steve drops sweet kisses on Tony's back neck and shoulders, cuddling him. The sensation of his lips is marvelous, breathtaking, and Tony just wishes that it never ends.
Steve can’t resist that sassy smile on Tony’s face. Tony leans up, catching Steve’s lips kindly, experimenting with each other’s lips before their tongues met in a quick, lovely kiss. They are smiling like two in-love teenage boys when they pull apart.
There's hand on his shoulder forcing him to stand up. Tony blinks again trying to focus on something, on someone, in a matter-of-fact. He stares at Steve, the supersoldier is shouting something, but he can't listen, the whirr in his ear are too loud now. He feels Steve's arm wraps around his waist pulling him out of the lab.
“We should have finished it two weeks ago, but,” Natasha sighed. “we had the harassment problem, and a sexual assault episode, so we’re restarting it today.” Steve nodded and followed Natasha when she stopped next to a desk where all types of equipment Steve might need, and some he has never ever dreamt to use were available. “I have to make a few calls, so I won’t be here, but Wanda,” Natasha pointed to the redhead on the other side of the room. “She’s my internship. She knows how I like it, and she has everything prepared. Ask her for suggestions. She loves it, by the way, and she’s really good.” Natasha’s phone chimed in her hands, but she ignored it until finish all instructions she had for Steve. “You can leave for lunch with Wanda, I’m sure she can show you around.” The phone chimed again, and Steve may have seen a flash of the name ‘Tony’. “I have to take this one. See you.”
"I don't know." He takes a sip of the warm liquid, it smells good. "A lot could go wrong, Nat. Everyone knew the risks. Tony better than anyone, why do you think he refused to help at first?"
Tony ordered a hot black coffee in the middle of the afternoon, in the summer season, the weather was so fucking hot that it seems insane, Steve don't say anything about it, though he's amused. On the other hand, Steve preferred an iced coffee, he wasn't a huge fan of the beverage, but seen that the only empty shop was the cafeteria, he guessed he didn't have another option. Also, because Tony literally dragged him in the place.
When he opens the door for him and Steve's room, he sees that the blond is asleep for his relief. Steve went through a lot yesterday and they haven't talked about it yet, but what it is in the folder is true, then he needs to know what exactly happened while Steve was in that improvised infirmary.
Steve keeps a safe distance from them, watching when the man pulled out a key and opened a large door. Tony’s eyes met his for just a few seconds, his brown eyes looked defocused, Steve notices. Suddenly, a terrible thought comes to his mind: drugs. Tony is drugged. Holy fucking shit. Steve rushes into the hallway, but he didn’t reach them in time, the door slams with a loud bang, and Steve didn’t listen to any key locking the door from inside.
Natasha waves her hand to Steve to follow. The blond looks quickly to where Tony’s standing with Wanda, but the brunet is too focused on explaining energy, electricity, and physics to look back at him. Steve does not see any other option than follow the red-haired into her office.
Steve is not the kind of person who hides his emotions, Tony sees clearly that Steve doesn't believe him. And Tony knew that he was not fine, not with Hydra chasing them and harming civilians to reach them.
"Guess I got enough rest," Steve says, standing up and getting Tony's jacket, the same he was wearing yesterday. "What is that?" Steve takes a small tube with a blood sample out of one of the pockets. "Where did you get this?"
“Good,” Steve smiled. His eyes focused on Tony’s beauty, still inebriated by the wonderful scent of his Omega. “Love you,” Steve said, though he didn’t allow to Tony said it back, the desire to kiss those red and swollen lips more urgent than ever. They’re too caught up on each other to notice the door opening before a voice shout.
“Thanks so much,” a red-haired woman that should be in her earlier twenties came in along with a blond, wait, is his hair white/silver? Steve wasn’t sure how to define it.
anything would have happened these guys would clearly cover each other, we’re getting nowhere with this.’
The garden was swarming with police within a matter of minutes after Wanda had called 911. Men in white overalls were investigating the crime scene, taking pictures and searching for… Well, Wanda was not quite sure what they were searching for. Evidence, probably.
He raised his fist and crashed it against the blond’s jaw without restraint, over and over again, not stopping till he heard the satisfying sound of bone shattering beneath his hand. Steve meekly laid still, arms strained at his side as he knew the beating would only get worse if he tried to defend himself. Tears blurred his vision as they streamed down his temple and disappeared into his hairline. He bit the inside of his cheeks to suppress his screaming, the taste of copper filling his mouth as blood pooled on his tongue.
‘Killian hated Barnes, Maximoff and the Odinsons for Pepper’s rejection on his offer.’ Sam noted, ‘He must have thought that if they would just leave her, Pepper would become less passionate about her work. Tension must have been running high in that mansion.’
‘Brother,’ Thor whispered, grabbing the trickster’s wrists before he could follow into the kitchen, causing Loki to jump.
After finishing their drinks, the three went back to the Avengers Compound. Drax was the first to notice Quill’s lack of snacks, making Peter and Starlord stare at each other as they tried to come up with an excuse. Luckily for them, they had a little Liesmith on their side and Loki was quick to convince everyone that they already ate all of their snacks on their way to the compound.
‘Bucky dropped me off at my room after we finished our rounds,’ Thor stated as he was sitting in the interrogation room of the police station, Steve and Tony patiently sitting in front of him. ‘We heard the shower running, which was strange ‘cause Loki never stays up that late.’
‘Oh, no, dad, it’s okay,’ Peter quickly smiled as he showed his arm. ‘Look, I’m not even… well, I’m just… There is hardly any blood, see? I’ll be fine.’ But the creature did not look up.
Loki walked through the halls, searching for something he would recognize. He was used to navigating himself through large buildings, the Asgardian Palace was definitely bigger than this compound, but still, he found it hard to distinct all the rooms and halls.
‘… Y-yeah, I- I can do that.’ The teen did as he was told, slowly but surely moving down the steep stairs. He nearly fell as he was almost at the bottom, parts of the old wooden banister breaking underneath his weight. He yelped as Steve managed to wrap his arms around his waist, clinging on to the man for dear life. ‘What’s happening?!’ he shouted as panic started to take over. ‘Where am I?! Why did dad bring me here?! Why are
At that moment, Scott suddenly expanded himself on top of the kitchen table, causing the plates and cups to chatter on the ground as he lay on his back. ‘Yeah, no problem,’ he said in a strained voice, taking off his helmet to take a deep breath. ‘I’m fine,’ he managed to smile but his expression then turned more sour as he noticed Bruce’s peanut butter jelly sandwich sticking to his helmet.
‘But I do not want to go to bed yet,’ the young god pouted as he wrapped his arms around the captain’s neck and he looked at Peter, his emerald eyes wide and sparkling in the dimmed lights. ‘Surely I can stay awake just a little longer, right? Big brother?’
‘Well, it is what I heard,’ Peter smiled, scooting himself in between his two fathers and taking a sip from his cocoa. ‘Hey, Lokes, would you like to have another big brother?’
‘Right,’ Steve nodded. ‘Did anything unusual happen last night? Did someone maybe have an argument with Mister Killian? Or did he behave any different?’
Peter and Loki both looked at the sky in surprise, quickly taking a step back as Sam landed in front of them, the mechanical wings of the EXO-7 Falcon harness smoothly retracted. ‘Ready to roll, kid?’ the man asked as he adjusted his black and red goggles. He then noticed the raven child at the teen’s side, ‘So, this is what happens when you mess with magic and what not, huh?’ He asked with a chuckle.
Bucky felt Steve pressing his growing, hard girth against him as he undid the knot on Bucky’s pants, sliding his hand in and wrapping the dark-haired’s cock with a hand. Bucky muttered something almost intelligible to himself in Russian. Steve always finds it so sexy when Bucky says things in a language he can’t understand.
Tony slides his hands into Steve's pants, touching the blond's hardened member, circling his thumb around the head of his cock. A drop of pre-cum sliding through his fingers, when Tony massages his cock, teasing the captain.
They took a table next to the windows, they sit in front of each other. Tony puts the briefcase by his side. Soon, a waitress comes to take their order, she doesn't take her eyes off of Steve. Tony clenches his teeth, he feels so bothered, he is so pissed with the waitress for drag Steve so much attention. He rolls his eyes, he shouldn't be jealous, Steve and him are just teammates, nothing else, despite Tony's hidden feelings.
“Thanks, Wanda,” Tony gives her a small smile. The youngest nods, walking away. “Is it because we were holding hands? Did I turn it awkward? You should’ve told me that you are uncomfortable that people know we are dating,” Tony concludes.
Steve acquiesced. He couldn’t help but feel a little upset for Tony not having told him about his relationship with Pepper, since they both still work together, and Pepper seemed really close to Tony. Though he couldn’t blame Tony either, after all, it was in the past, right? It doesn’t matter what was in the past.
"Is everything okay?" The brunet asks with a brow lifted. Steve simply nods and turns around to take the driver's seat, Tony opens the door and accommodate himself in the passenger's side, Steve throws the plastic bag to him, Tony caught it and opened a bag of chips and starts to eat offering it to Steve who takes some.
“‘M coming,” Steve replied, ignoring the will to check the correspondences and entering the room again.
"Do you mind if I take a look at some footages? I've lost my wallet this morning when I went to the grocery store, which is close here, maybe I can see if someone took it?" He asks uncertain, because, in fact, he already asked a lot to this girl.
“Out,” he just needed to say it once before Thor and Bruce rush out and Bruce closes the door as best as he could with the broken knob. Steve turns his attention back to Tony, his eyes checking Tony’s body once again looking for any injuries, but the Omega seems fine. “You’re hot,” Steve says, frowning and noticing for the first time that Tony’s skin is warm under his hands, the strong, accentuated mint scent filling Steve’s nostrils, and making his body react immediately if the bulge in his pants is any indication. “Heat. You’re in heat, Tony.”
She unfolds the letter and reads it while holding the Pym particles on her left hand. She feels her eyes watery reading it again, but she keeps reading, swallowing the lump in her throat.
“Hold on, doll,” Steve adds a third finger knowing that that would be enough to not hurt Tony, he thrusts the three fingers getting Tony open to take him. The Omega whimpered when Steve pulled out his fingers, leaving him hollow for a moment before the Alpha lined his cock up to the Omega’s entrance, pushing the head of his cock through Tony’s muscles easily. Steve closes his eyes as Tony takes him all, the wetness and warmness from Tony’s hole too good for Steve, so fucking good. “I’ve got you, doll,” Steve whispered delightedly in Tony’s ear, enjoying the sensation and biting the Omega’s earlobe in tease, giving time for Tony to adjust to his length.
"You're gonna love it, otherwise you don't have a heart!" Tony exclaims indignantly "No, better, I don't think we can keep a relationship if you don't like jellies gums." Steve laughs at the serious face Tony made, but he can see the brunet's lips curled up while he bumps onto Steve's shoulder purposely.
“What kind of caption is that?” Steve raised a brow to his best friend. Bucky walked around to take their dinner out of the bags.
The morning light is shining through the window next to the bed, which makes Steve's hair even more blonde, illuminating his face and his blue eyes, it looks like Steve has a bright aura around him. It's beautiful and pure.
He never felt so free like right now. Steve pulled him closer, and suddenly he was sat on the blond's lap while they kissed. Steve hands sliding on his side, his big hands were capable of breaking plenty of things, punching and kills enemies, but against Tony's skin, they were smooth, loving, and warm while the blond worships his body.
"Ouch, hell. Guess I have a problem, no way that will not kiss you because a fucking cut." Tony complains and Steve laughs. "I have an idea."
“Stop,” Steve turns his head harshly, his amplified senses getting the word that wasn’t exactly shouted, but the reason why he understood the word so clear is that it came out from Tony’s mouth. “Stop! I told you to stop!”
Then, his eyes fell over a screen on his right side, he approaches from it. Steve was tied to a stretcher, an IV tube connected to his body, delivering some unknown substance into his body. Tony felt sick, what the hell are these infamous doing to Steve? His hand clenched to a fist, everything looks so quiet.
"It's fine, Tony. I'm a gay guy from the forties, I get it better than anyone." Tony gives him a weak smile. "Let's go." He points the direction with his head, so Tony follows him.
He stepped out of the bed careful not to wake Steve, he took a quick shower and left without breakfast or coffee. There's no need to wake Steve for that simple task, he was more than capable to do that on his own. When Tony Stark has an idea, he got obsessed with it, not even basics necessities could get him rid of it.
“Holy shit!” Steve turns his head to the door, seeing Bruce standing there, his eyes now covered by his hands. “Sorry. I--I--I’ll tell the others you’re unavailable,” Bruce’s neck and face in a scarlet ton of red. He stumbled and dropped a chair on his way out. Tony bursts into loud laughter that has Steve quickly following.
‘As you can see,’ Thor continued a bit annoyed as he noticed the still gazing eyes of the Ravager. ‘this is indeed my brother. I hope you understand now why he is in no condition to join you on your mission.’
‘Funny thing though,’ Clint started as he continued cooking. ‘Normally, people just come and go during lunch, but for some reason, when there’s pancakes involved, they all assemble like it’s the freaking end of the world.’
‘Can’t hear you over the sound of having fun, kid!’ Quill laughed as he made a sharp turn to the left which nearly tipped over the cart.
‘N-no,’ Peter reluctantly shook his head. ‘We still have time! I say we hurry up, find my dad, eat those stupid candies and we’ll be home before the party ends!’
Peter gave a quick nod, ‘Me and Cassie, yes. I- I don’t know where she is now though. I don’t know where dad has taken her.’
Sam looked at the playboy with a raised brow, but then shrugged. ‘Okay, why not? Twenty bucks saying it’s murder.’ The two shook hands while Steve walked behind them, disapprovingly shaking his head but deciding to stay out of this one.
The scientist knew it was programmed to apologize, yet he found himself amazed by the sincerity bleeding through its words. ‘Don’t worry. I know just how to fix it. At least for the time being.’ He quickly grabbed a scarf that was hanging from the coat rack and covered Steve’s eyes. ‘There, much better.’
‘Yeah, I really want my man back in bed with me tonight, sleeping alone sucks,’ Peter shrugged as he said so, causing both Loki and Tony to raise a brow. ‘I just hope he’ll be back to, well, his actual self. I’d hate to wake up and find my bed covered in fur, can you imagine how horrible that would be when he’s shedding?’
The smell of candy and sweets filled the air together with the comforting sound of Avengers laughing and chatting. The lights were dimmed low, Halloween decorations in every corner, causing for a chilling effect. Music was briefly heard every time the door to the living room opened and closed and Loki swore he could hear Drax and Quill’s laughter above all the other sounds. The party had already started about an hour ago and the raven had intended to leave his bedroom sooner but making the potion took more time than he had anticipated.
The doll opened its eyes, responding to the voice of its master shouting its name. He was sitting on his knees, the cold of the stone floor creeping into his legs and up his hips. How much time had gone by in which he was not allowed to stand? For how long was he kneeling in this basement, waiting without food or water, for its master to return?
‘Oh, stop your foul mood, Loki.’ Thor smiled, ‘According to ancient Midgardian mythology, Zeus and Hades were brothers, so are these not the perfect costumes for us?’ Thor looked from the raven, who watched him with a raised brow, to the teen next to him, who nodded in agreement.
‘We… found some information, that, well…’ the blond continued carefully. ‘Has Killian ever approached you? Or done anything to you that you did not want?’
‘Once we find your little brat,’ he hovered over his doll, hands resting behind his back and smirking as he saw the effusion of blood in its broken jaw. ‘We will make sure he will never dare to leave again. Your brat’s been naughty, Rogers. Surely you understand that some form of discipline is necessary.’
‘Hi, Thor, uhm, sir,’ Peter stammered a little, looking up at the towering god, ‘I, I hope you don’t mind. Lokes and I were just playing and, well, he asked me if-’
‘It was not me who doomed you, brother,’ the blond god hissed as he held on to his brother’s arm with a firm grip. ‘It was by drawing of lots that fate had send you to the underworld! I inherited the skies, and our brother Poseidon-’
‘Any witnesses?’ Tony asked lightly at which the young woman frowned, a slightly perplexed “no” being her answer.
Bucky looked at Thor for a split second but then averted his eyes to the floor as he the blond squinted his eyes slightly. He remained silent.
Steve stared at the operation table, his heart beating loudly in his chest. Something about the shiny object made his skin crawl, made his lungs refuse to suck in any oxygen. It felt like a memory was locked away, one that was unpleasant or even cruel, but he could not recall it.
‘It does taste weird…’ Tony noticed but he shook it off and placed his empty glass back on the tray as well.
‘How am I supposed to know?’ Pepper’s brows furrowed, her kind and soft expression ebbing away with each question, making way for frustration. ‘Maybe he was… maybe he just masturbated.’
The squeaking sound of his bedroom door slowly opening made the god look up, his eyes widening in surprise as he saw his baby brother standing in the doorway.
‘Oh you know I’m talking about you, Groot.’ Quill scoffed, ‘don’t try to deny it! Anyway, I need someone with a car to drive me there, my license doesn’t really count on this planet.’
‘Ah, yes,’ Fury looked up from behind his desk, papers and files piled up next to him. ‘I heard you and your team have some time to spare, so I want you all to help me work through some files. The detective’s department is late with its reports, as always, so it’s about time you start on those.’
Thor had to remind himself to unclench his fists as he looked at the detective’s smirk. ‘Nothing. I went to bed.’
The captain chuckled as nodded, giving Tony a kiss as he walked by, earning himself a flirtatious pinch in his ass from the playboy. ‘Peter you want something to drink?’ the blond continued with a slight blush, deciding to ignore his boyfriend’s sly move.
‘I don’t know,’ Bucky voice filled with tension again as he looked at Stark. ‘Ask the others! They’ll tell you the same thing.’
Their tender motion halted as the music stopped, their eyes closed as their lips touched yet did not kiss.
I adjusted both songs just slightly to fit the story, but I do hope you will recognize them and that it will make you laugh.
‘… Leave it,’ Tony kept staring into Steve’s eyes. ‘Just- leave it, for now. Let’s both go to bed. Seems like you had a pretty long day, so I can only imagine how tired you must be.’
Sam frowned heavily but then decided to laugh and shake his head, ‘Yeah man, sure, whatever.’ With a simple touch on the mechanical weapon system strapped around his wrist, Sam expanded the wings of his suit, causing Loki to gaps. ‘The name’s Sam Wilson, kid,’ the man said, placing his hands in his side as he stared in the distance, ‘but you can call me Falcon.’ He then looked at Loki as he first heard no response. The raven seemed completely frozen on the spot and just stared back at him with wide eyes, his body completely tensed. ‘Kid? You oka-’
‘I. Don’t. know!’ She stood up, her fingers tightly clenched around her purse. ‘I don’t know what games you’re playing, but I can assure you that you will regret this!’
‘I can completely understand Thor’s actions,’ Natasha admitted, a glass of red, delicious wine in her hand. She was sitting at the round table in Rogers’ small apartment, Tony sitting next to her.
‘Ohana means family,’ he smiled as he squirmed a little, making himself comfortable in his brother’s warm embrace. ‘I am truly grateful that you are my family.’
‘Unlikely. Masturbation does not leave these kind of traces,’ Tony put on his sunglasses as some rays started to shimmer through the leaves of the oak tree. ‘We’ve also found some blood around the-uhm…
Bruce looked at the playboy and then at his cup of coffee, ‘Well,’ he started but Tony was quick to interrupt.
‘Uh,’ Sam started, staring straight into big pleading emerald eyes, ‘yeah, sure, I guess.’ He then turned to Peter and whispered, ‘Please tell me I’m not the only one who is freaked out by this.’
‘Sir,’ Jarvis turned down the loud music, breaking Tony’s concentration. ‘Your guest is done showering. I took the liberty to let him dress in your sweatpants which seem to fit just fine for now.’
‘Where you alone?’ Steve asked as he sat down at the kitchen table, a glass of lemonade in his hand.
‘I cut myself, accidentally, a-and Mister Killian, he got angry so he, uhm,’ the raven was shivering, waves of heat and cold leaving him nauseous. ‘He pulled down his fly and told me to… to use my mouth on him. He said it was my fault that he got so mad and that I should make up for it… I was so scared, I-I didn’t want to, so I pushed him away.’ Loki was sobbing now, his voice quivering. He slowly stood up and took off his sweater, revealing small black bruises just above his hipbones and bright red strips crossing his back. ‘He, he reminded me that I had no choice. He grabbed me, a-and pulled down my pants, and I-’ Loki swallowed thickly, trying to force himself to say it, but he couldn’t.
What was it again? Hold it tight, like this. Then swing, throw it in the air and catch it in the other hand and... stab.
‘Stane!’ the teen shouted from the top of his lungs. ‘Stane! Open this door!’ He raised his fist to slam them against the wood. ‘Open the d-’
‘I knew you would like it,’ Peter smiled brightly as he laughed along. ‘Now come on, let’s go. We don’t want to be late for the party. Thor just told me that Quill and his gang are already here so…’
The raven and the teen turned around, noticing how Quill was running towards them with a shopping cart. He stopped just in front of the two and smiled, ‘Who’s in for a little fun time?’
Tony froze for a second. Was this really the same god who tried to take over Earth? Was this really the same guy he’d been fighting with over countless small things like whether or not it was normal to drink alcohol during the day? What was it to Loki anyway? It’s not like
He heard no sounds of failed experiments, followed by a curse coming from a billionaire and a gamma energy expert. He heard no sounds of a captain and a soldier running down the track in the garden or a teenager frantically shouting that he was late for school and asking people if they had seen his backpack.
