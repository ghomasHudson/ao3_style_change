Tony would’ve been even more stunning if he didn’t wobble and lurch to the side when he tried to move back into the bathroom again, and Steve instinctively shot up to catch him. Tony tried to push him away, but Steve grabbed firm hold of him and held him close to his chest, not letting him escape to suffer alone again.
no, I err, I didn’t think you’d like an octopus dick as much as a regular tentacle,” Tony answered awkwardly, all his tentacles wiggling in self-consciousness.
Bucky gently manoeuvred Tony out of the kitchen and into the living room as he spoke. Steve saw the wheels turning in Tony’s brain, and cursed himself for not thinking about this sooner. His hungover self had only thought about food, getting it himself and coaxing Tony out of the bathroom so he could have some too. And then his post hungover self had only seen the advantages of eight flexible appendages. He really was a caveman.
“Why? I don't understand what's going on.” Steve felt himself get angry with powerlessness. He understood why Bucky snapped if he tried to talk Tony out of the bathroom for hours. Getting angry would only make Tony get defensive however, and make him stay in there who knew how long.
From inside the bathroom he heard movement from the tub again, a sort of squeaking noise, something that sounded like a wet rag dragging across the floor, the opening of the closet and then the rattle of a pill box. The door Steve was leaning against moved inwards a tiny bit, and the bottle was dropped through the crack, before it closed again with a bang.
It was Bucky’s turn to look annoyed at Steve, getting up from his chair to wrap an arm around Tony’s shoulders.
Nodding miserably Tony climbed onto his lap, and, oh, okay, that was… that was really nice, with all the wriggling and the suction things that held onto the fabric of his overalls. He wondered how it would-- no! Tony needed to pee, this sounded like a thing they could find out together.
“This is the hottest fuckin’ thing ever,” Bucky whispered and Steve had to agree, smiling against Bucky's lips when Tony giggled.
“No, we're not.” Steve sighed as he picked up his coffee. “Tony already doesn't trust us, we're not gonna add to that.” It was a low blow, playing the trust card, but he was flying blind here, and he really wanted to resolve whatever this was and proceed into hangover cuddling.
Tony whimpered and Steve shook the lethargy of post orgasmic chill off long enough to pull Tony into his lap again, the underside of the tentacles soft and warm against his heated flesh. All three of them would need a bath after this, but Steve didn’t care when Tony was so warm and pliant and smelled so nice, like a day at the beach.
He pulled away a bit to search Tony’s face and top half for any other signs of transformation, but couldn’t spot any. No gills, that was good, wasn’t it?
“After I thought you had a tentacle face this is really not that bad,” Steve grinned, earning him a splash of water in the face. “Come on, let’s go get you dried off and put some breakfast in you.” Steve fetched a towel and helped Tony out of the tub, hugging him tight for a moment. “It’ll be alright, you’ll see.”
Steve wanted to point out Tony still had two perfectly serviceable human hands to undress Steve with, but he knew his boyfriend would only take it as a challenge and not as the helpful advice it was meant to be. Looking at Tony concentrating hard, with that little frown between his brows and the tip of his tongue sticking out wasn’t a hardship, so Steve sat back and let his hands wander over the rough skin of the tentacles he could reach.
Now this sounded more like their Tony, Steve was glad to note, but Bucky was still engrossed in his phone. Tony frowned and one of the tentacles slowly raised and slapped the phone from Bucky’s hand. “Hey, look at that!” Tony looked too pleased with this accomplishment in tentacle manipulation for Steve to chide him.
The argument, if you could call it that, slowly filtered into his consciousness. He wished it didn’t. Sleep was a far more benign state than this headache where his brain tried to escape its confines through his skull. Even moaning seemed too much of an effort, so he lay there trying to block out the voices.
Steve felt a bit silly asking this like they were back in high school, especially since Bucky was quite clearly being fondled, but Steve didn’t know what the proper protocol was if your boyfriend’s accidental cephalopod-ness turned you on; his ma had raised a polite man after all.
“Just run the damn bath so I can take a leak and have breakfast. That bacon over there is taunting me. And where is my coffee?”
“Cut it out,” Bucky muttered from somewhere inside his burrito, but shot straight up and Steve opened his eyes to see what the fuss was about. Their eyes found Tony at the same time, sleeping soundly on his stomach, looking decidedly human-shaped. Steve carefully lifted the blanket and sighed when there weren’t any tentacles hiding under there. He didn’t know if it was a sigh of relief or disappointment, probably a little of both. Just thinking about their… adventure made his post nap wood twitch in interest, and when he looked up he saw Bucky was already busy kissing Tony awake.
Steve felt his cheeks colour as the tip worked its way even higher, tickling the skin of his inner thigh until it couldn't fit any further. Steve's gaze flicked from Tony who pretended to eat to hide his grin, to Bucky who looked in awe at their boyfriend, licking his lips. Seemed like Tony was learning fine motor skills with his tentacles awfully fast.
Across the hall he noticed Bucky falling into the same state of shock, but the other man recovered quicker than Steve. Maybe because he’d seen part of Tony already.
When he got to the hallway he could hear hushed voices upstairs. Sounded like Tony and Bucky were awake as well, they probably hadn't come down so as not to wake him. He tried to relieve himself as fast as he could, which wasn't very fast at all since he was still in his fighter pilot overalls and the zipper got stuck. He cursed Tony and his love of uniforms until he got the thing down.
Wish you could feel what I felt,” Tony whispered, sounding strained, but Steve was too overcome by all the sensations to answer with more than a moan.
“You’re such a caveman, why do we put up with you again?” Steve mock chided him, winking at the same time. “Tony, let me in before he ravages me!”
“Have you tried your hectostylus yet?” Steve wondered if it had the same sensibility like a human dick. There must be something nice about it, otherwise why bother?
“I’d do it again, I’d do it every fucking time,” Tony says, hot tears still running down his face. “I’d do it all–”
“If it gets you to stop talking, yeah,” Tony mutters, but the line of his shoulders is relaxed like few people ever are when Bucky’s around, and deep inside, Bucky feels another frozen, tied up knot start to unwind just a little.
Steve swallows the lump in his throat, and breathes through the pang in his chest. “Because you’re my best friend. Because I get tired too sometimes, and on those days… you always make it better. Because you’re the first person– you’re the only person I think about when I think of home.”
"'Sleepin’ in with Papa'," Steve reads the caption, and then pulls Tony in a little closer. "I didn't know you'd taken a picture. You never said..."
When he looks up, he spots Thor, Clint, and Bucky jumping around a decent sized fir ahead. Bucky’s beanie topped head is nodding enthusiastically, and even Bruce is grinning.
His breathing is slow and deep-- the way it always is, the way Tony always wants it to be-- but it’s also louder, and certainly more nasally than it has any business being. It’s not long before Tony abandons the movie and lets his eyes rest on a far more beautiful sight.
"You’ve gotta be kidding me,” Rhodey gapes. “The first day I met you, you were wearing these bad boys. This is the Tony I know, the Tony I grew up with.”
,” he mumbles against Steve’s lips, against his cheek, his nose, his eyes, every part of his face he can reach. Steve’s arms are tight around his waist, holding Tony to that muscled chest he loves so much. He palms the skin over Steve’s heart and revels in the strong, sure beat he can feel beneath. “I love you,” he whispers.
Steve nods. “My favorite smile... ah, there it is,” he says, when Tony’s lips quirk up in that particular way he loves so much, small and soft, but every bit as real as this thing between them is. “I could look at it all day. Could look at you all day.”
"Tough luck, toots. But look..." He pulls up another picture, this one showing Steve and their daughter sleeping face to face; there's a soft morning glow coming from beyond the frame, and their matching hair gleams golden as they share a single white, fluffy pillow. "This one? My absolute fucking favorite," he says softly.
“Good, ‘cause I like you too,” Steve whispers against his lips, and presses them together a second later. It’s slow and soft and comfortingly familiar, and Tony revels in the rush of warmth that runs down his spine.
Steve just rolls his eyes, and begins rearranging the presents beneath the tree. “Y’know, every year, I think there’s no possible way we can have more gifts under here, and every year, I’m proven wrong.”
Steve lets Stark pull away this time, and this time, the billionaire's eyes won’t meet either of theirs. "I, uh... I might've, you know, panicked? And I didn’t let them finish talking. And there's also the, uh, slightest chance I might've broken a shit ton of traffic laws getting here."
“I thought that was the plan for the next two weeks,” Steve smirks, and leans in again to nip at that plush, reddened lower lip.
Steve puts a warm hand over Tony’s mouth. “Come on, just this once,” he says. “And I’ll never bother you again. We can take hot chocolate and a blanket, yeah? It won’t take long, but we need to go now. Please?”
“See what?” a voice calls out from down the hall, and seconds later, Tony’s heart skips a beat when Steve walks in, arms lifted high over his head as he stretches languorously. There’s a sliver of soft, tan skin peeking out from under his white tee, and Tony feels that deep, familiar pang of longing burn hotter in his chest.
Steve uncurls his hand from Tony’s waist, and tip his chin up until their eyes meet. “Are you okay with this?” he asks.
“Oh my fucking god,” Clint comes in, rolling his eyes as he settles into his bean bag. “Spare us the foreplay, please.”
bright. God, I wish I could explain it,” she wriggles in her seat. “The science, I mean. It’s– it’s fucking brilliant! Took us days to come up with it, drove Pops crazy–”
“I don’t--“ Tony starts, but a sudden bout of laughter from outside Pepper’s office makes him stop, and his heart skips a beat when he registers whose it is.
The rope is rough around his wrists, but it’s not so tight that he can’t move his hands, and he has them free in seconds. So either Tony Stark managed to get kidnapped by idiots— in which case he’s going laugh about this until he forgets it, like he’s forgotten about every other time except… you know— or they didn’t actually mean to keep him captive. He’s not sure which it is for now, but he’s sure as fuck not going stay here and find out.
He quickly mounted the stairs to find Bucky sitting on the landing with his back against the bathroom door. Steve noticed he was still in his costume (the Dude), his face haggard with large bags under his eyes. When Steve stumbled upstairs he sighed in relief.
It stayed quiet in the bathroom. Every so often he heard another squeaking sound, and from below came the comforting noise of Bucky making a mess of the kitchen while making something delicious for them. It was almost peaceful, until Tony’s voice came from close by, probably leaning against the door as well.
When Tony sagged against him, even put his arms around Steve’s neck, he pulled him tighter, relief of Tony being alive and with them again battling with the worry about Tony having tentacles. Tentacles!
"Stop making them yourself then," Tony quipped. Steve felt tentacles move over his back and his shoulder, caressing him softly and wasn’t it the nicest thing, being wrapped up like this.
“Sounds logical.” Steve reached out and turned on the bath, but turned to Tony. “Should there be salt in there? Aren’t all cephalopods salt water creatures?”
Steve fell down on his knees in front of Tony and pulled him into a hug. “I’m relieved for you, honey.”
The tentacle fell limp and Tony’s whole body slumped in exhaustion, as he lay panting against Steve’s chest.
Steve gingerly stood up, holding onto the back of the couch for support as he wobbled to his feet. The world did a little seesaw lurching thing, but quickly stood still again, and he picked his way through the semi-darkness. It must still be early for it to be this dark and quiet.
“Well, I don't know what you look like, do I? Seein’ as you're acting like a fifteen year old who got dumped.” Bucky yelled back.
“Tony, sweet thing, you know we don’t care how many limbs you have, as long as you’re okay?” He said carefully.
“Tentacles.” Bucky’s confirmation sounded casual, but the way his hand shook as he brought his coffee cup to his mouth belied the calmness of his voice.
“You look real pretty sitting on Stevie like that,” Bucky remarked form across the table. His voice was a lazy rumble, and he looked at them like they were a snack ready to eat.
Together they managed to get Tony down the stairs without incident. The way the tentacles rippled and moved was more than a little fascinating, but Steve was too worried Tony might take a tumble to pay it too much attention. Tony was a fast learner though and he hobbled down without a hitch.
“Shh, don’t worry, sweetheart. We’ll eat you when you’re back to human, how does that sound?” Steve tried to put Tony at ease. The way the tentacles moved and glimmered in the light did
As if Tony read his thoughts, Steve felt something move between their bodies, something dextrous and agile. Not agile enough to get ahold of the zipper, though, and Tony pulled back from the kiss to huff in annoyance, looking down at the tentacle that failed to do its job with a frown.
He couldn’t be too sad about the loss of his overalls when he felt the tip of a tentacle wriggle its way under the hem of his sweats, teasing his taint before wrapping snug around one cheek. The suckers felt soft until they suddenly
Steve thought he could come from that sensation alone. They let go with a wet suction sound and Tony's gasp made Steve look back at him.
“I feel seasick because I keep wobbling on these things and I need to pee but I don’t know how!” Tony sounded crestfallen, all but hanging onto Steve for support now.
“Come out and stop me,” Bucky hollered back, and yay, Steve's headache was back. Bucky stroked an angry hand through his hair. “Our moron genius in there tried an incantation and transformed himself into some kind of… thing? Don' rightly know cause one moment there's this blindin’ light and the next I see some Davy Jones kinda shit scurrying outta the room.”
"What? What is it? Why did you stop?" Bucky demanded and turned around as well, only to stop up short when he saw the marks on Steve's back. "Damn, doll."
“I want you to now.” Tony whined, his head falling even farther back to show even more of his neck in hopes it would tempt the obviously interested alpha.
Steve frowned and gave Tony a look that made it plain that Steve was not happy with Tony at the moment, before shaking his head at his exasperating lover.
“Anthony Stark, you are twice the man your father was and every inch the King you were meant to be.” Pepper said with more conviction that Tony had ever heard from her, which was saying something seeing as Pepper had lead whole armies singlehandedly.
The photos of the little baby girl were such a hit that Pepper was actively campaigning for the super hero couple to start up a blog so she didn't have to be constantly fielding calls from every form of media imaginable begging her for more pictures of the Rogers-Stark babies. So far Steve was completely against it and Tony was moderately apposed. But, Pepper was like a shark who had scented blood in the water and was gradually wearing Tony down. It was only a matter of time before Tony gave in and both he and Pepper knew it. Steve was also aware of how she had cornered his partner like a predator who had almost sunk her claws into her prey, but he wasn't going to give in that easily.
Steve turned onto his side, his head propped up against his hand so that he was looking down at Tony. His other hand reached over and began to gently caress Tony’s cheek. “Well then, anything you want to tell me, I want to hear.”
“My father took many other wives when he was with my mother. She was his primary wife and none of them lasted long, but he still married others. One of his unions was particularly devastating to my mother. It was a seventh degree marriage, a one night union for a soldier, but a child came out of it. My half brother, Bucky, was born and his mother died bringing him into this world.” Steve explained.
Tony, who was still standing where Steve had left him, slumped slightly and sighed. He slowly made his was over to Steve who was still clutching Peter tightly.
“It was good. Jarvis was teaching me about how they built the palace today. Did you know there are secret tunnels hidden in the walls.”
“How about you start with why you’re back here after two years.” Tony snapped, his head turning to stare at Steve even though his face remained completely passive.
He shifted restlessly as the feeling grew. Steve groaned above him, pulling away so he could look at Tony. Tony whimpered and tried to pull Steve back to him, but his Alpha wouldn’t more.
Despite having complete trust in Thor, Steve was currently panicking at the thought of leaving Peter for such a long and in his opinion unnecessary excursion. This night out was going to be the longest period of time that both Steve and Tony had been away from Peter, and Steve was not at all liking the idea of being away from his baby boy for so long.
The two of them made their way back into the bedchamber, Tony heading over to his dresser once more to finish undoing the ties of his doublet and Steve once again standing awkwardly nest to a doorway.
"Still can't believe you insisted on doing this yourself, Cap,” he says, lips quirked up into that smile he can never help but make when Steve’s involved. “I can't believe you managed to drag me into this, too-- Tony Stark doesn’t pack, honey bunch.”
“Do you not want to be with me anymore?” He asks, and his eyes are already blurry but he will not let the tears fall.
“I’m not…” Tony shakes his head, but doesn’t pull away when Rhodey moves in front of him to put his hands on Tony’s shoulders.
Steve steps further into the room. “Hi, babydoll,” he grins, and pepper’s kisses all over their daughter’s face when he lifts her into his arms. “Having tea time with Daddy?”
Tony breathes in a shaky breath, blinks away the faint sting in his eyes, and leans up to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “You’re the best.”
” He calls over Pepper’s shoulder, and she turns to find Barnes and Wilson standing sheepishly in front of a toddler-sized lump of the same blue balloons she’d been blowing up. “Keep making Michelin man there any bigger, and Steve’s going to come home to some pretty empty walls. You good, Barton?” A muffled "
The fondness in Steve’s voice settles over Tony like a warm blanket, and when he turns, he’s helpless to return the blond’s happy smile.
me. I love your eyes, I love your smile, I love the way you smell like metal and motor oil even after you’ve showered. I love the way you bite your lip when you’re trying not to laugh. There’s not a single part of you that I don’t love, not a single part of you that I wouldn’t give my life for.”
He doesn’t even complete a whole round before he’s bored out of his mind, paintings and sculptures he’s seen only minutes ago already fading from his memory. The champagne glass hangs upside down from his swinging hand, and he can’t even muster a fake hum of interest at anything anymore.
“C’ffee? Gimme,” Tony whispers, and Pepper and Steve both chuckle when he pulls away to down it in one go. “More?”
“I always knew you’d make a wonderful father,” he hears Steve whisper, and closes his eyes to fight the sting of sudden tears.
Look… There’s no one I trust more than my team. Every mission, every fight, they’re the ones I will always place my bets on. And this guy– [
“Well, I’m hoping you’ll give us a chance to prove you wrong. But for now, do we have a deal?” the Captain asks, holding out his hand.
Steve’s smile is the last thing he sees before the screen goes black, and when Tony throws the blankets over his head, he knows there’ll be no nightmares tonight.
"Then imagine my surprise when the first thing they fucking tell me when I get off the plane, after a fourteen hour flight, is that the Avengers have been at HQ all day--"
“That wasn’t very nice, darling,” she hears Tony say, seconds before he pops into her field of vision to scoop up the girl into his arms. “Come on, let’s get you some of Cap’s pancakes before the other gremlins gobble ‘em all up, yeah? You too, Pep. Up and at ‘em.”
"Might be some bad times in there too," Tony says, eyes falling to the hollow of Steve's throat, and just manages to catch his nod.
“You ass,” Tony grumbles, even as his mouth is turned up at the corners. “If you wanted me to move, all you had to do was say so.”
“That’s what they all think,” Tony says, and he’s more than a little surprised when his voice comes out steady, and just a little bit lighter than before.
Steve bites the corner of his lip, and looks down at the plush puppy in his hands. “It’s been perfect. I’m havin’ a great time.”
“Ugh, you ass!” Tony growls, swatting at Steve’s shoulder as the blond laughs. There’s no one around as far as either of them can see-- just trees and snow and the vast, grey sky above them-- and for one blissful second, it feels like they’re the only two people in the world.
“‘Kay, Daddy,” she nods, and marches back across the room with a twirl of her blue Princess dress skirts. “Cat, d’wanna play wif my dolls?”
He wants it more than he’s wanted anything in a long time. But until he can have that, he knows his place is here, knows it as much as he knows that Tony does too. “The team would fall apart with both of us gone, though,” he continues, and feels Tony’s sigh echo down both their chests.
“Zip it,” Tony hisses, barely breathing as he positions his phone closer to their sleeping baby girl. A couple of taps later, he steps back with a proud grin. “There. Isn’t she just... God, hon, did we make a kick ass kid or what?”
-- out there relaxing. I want to see them smile, see them laugh and have fun. I want to run in the mornings and swim in the afternoons, and sleep to the sound of the ocean outside my window. And I want you. Here. With me.” He whispers the last word, and even though his heart is suddenly beating so hard, he’s sure Tony can feel it through their chests, he doesn’t move.
,” his voice breaks. “Babe, you’re gonna have to hear me out, ‘kay? I’m– this is… if i’m only gonna do this once, I’m gonna fucking do it right.”
“‘s because you’re too short to reach all those really high shelves everywhere,” Steve replies, and then yelps out a laugh when Tony smacks him on his shoulder.
“I thought I’d, uh, do some body parts. I have Nat in her ballet slippers, and, um, Clint’s arms. And Buck’s smile, and... everyone else.”
“You’re probably right, though,” Steve says gloomily. “The last thing I want is to get you sick, too.”
“I’ll show you cocky,” Steve growls, and a second later, flips them over until he has Tony beneath him.
“I can call you Bucky too?” Bucky asks, and feels an easy grin settle on his face when Stark rolls his eyes.
“Make me,” he says, and Steve does, turning him around until their mouths meet in a slow, languid kiss. Tony loses himself in every swipe of Steve’s lips against his own with an ease that he knows will never fade, and presses his chest as far into Steve’s as it will go, their hands still together between them.
“Thank god,” he sighs. “Now that we've got that out of the way...” he holds out his hand, “Tony Stark, native Manhattanite. Genius, billionaire, philanthropist, and current grad student in Engineering. I've got three Ph.D's, and in five weeks, I'm going for my fourth.”
He doesn’t know where to start. The eyes, the hair, the jaw-- those fucking shoulders are a wonder and oh my god, Tony’s being held captive by this man but he really wants to
“Do you mean to tell me,” Pepper says slowly, hands on her hips as she stares at the two of them incredulously, “that neither of you remember how you ended up with those rings on your fingers?”
“I’m trying to get into the school spirit a little more, okay?” Tony tries to pull away, but Steve’s hold slips down to his waist, and he gives up with a huff.
,” Steve’s voice breaks, and it’s the pain behind it that finally makes him look up. Warm fingers wipe the tears from his cheeks, until Tony can see blue eyes filled with confusion and concern.
“Better,” Steve whispers, a delicious looking smirk now settled firmly on his face. “And just so you know, I plan on returning the favor.”
“You better,” Tony grumbles, but by the time Steve’s dragged him out the door and into the dark, winter night, he can feel the smile settling easily on his face.
“Doesn’t have to,” Steve says softly, and then points to the cupcakes. “I didn’t know which kind you like, but I figured you can’t go wrong with chocolate.”
Steve just tugs him closer, and Pepper feels something fall into place when Tony smiles into his Captain’s chest.
“Hey,” Steve cups Tony’s cheek until their eyes meet. With his boyfriend on his lap, Steve has to look up, and as strange as that is, he suddenly thinks it might be a good thing. “What’s wrong?”
And when, one day, Steve takes him down to the garage to show him his motorcycle, Tony spends the rest of the day in a state of perpetual arousal, from both the bike-- it’s black and classic and one of the most well-kept machines he’s ever seen-- and from the thought of what Steve must look like riding it, those strong, thick thighs straddling the beast between his legs...
At his partner’s statement, Steve’s eyes did one more sweep of his children and took notice of their daughter’s condition. Worry bloomed on his face with remarkable speed and he quickly traversed the room, arms stretching out to take his daughter from her Uncle.
“My Lord Royal Consort, the King has returned and wishes you to join him in the dinning hall for a feast in your honor that has been hosted by the Queen Mother.” The messenger called. “I have been asked to escort you.”
Steve’s chest rumbled in a low growl beneath Tony’s hands before he slowly, hesitantly pulled back. Steve’s hands released Tony’s ass and drew back up to the small of his back, seemingly unwilling to part from Tony completely.
When they finally pulled away a bright smile graced Tony’s lips. He leaned up to kiss Steve’s forehead before moving to stand and get ready for bed, but the super soldier, it turned out, had other ideas.
Finally after about an hour of looking, Tony had settled on a short list of his favorite t-names and a-names. He settled rather quickly on his favorite t-name, Taelyn. The a-names, however were a little harder. Eventually, he settled on three names; Adeline, Aillidh, and Amory.
The rope would apparently be used for an important ceremony to mark the official one year engagement Tony and King Steven would enter into. For some bizarre reason they called it a “hand fasting”. During that time they were to produce a child to complete their marriage or decide to go their separate ways. All in all, this felt more like a real wedding than an engagement to Tony, but Thor had assured him that was not the case. Tony was also still a little unclear on how a child made a marriage, but that was what Thor had told him and Jane had corroborated it which meant it had to be true. Jane would never lie to him and was alway careful to make sure that Thor wasn’t leading Tony astray on how to behave in Celtic society by convincing Tony that Thor’s idiosyncrasies were normal. Tony loved the big, blond man dearly, but he was definitely an odd one.
Steve’s hand moved from his cheek to gently grip his neck. Tony’s breath caught and he felt his libido start to react to the possessive hold of his alpha. The heat began to build faster when Steve’s thumb started rubbing Tony’s still unmarked bonding gland. Despite everything his father had done, selling him around to gain favor from his father’s business partners, Howard had been clear that they not damage the prime value of his merchandise. Tony hated that his father had treated him like nothing better than a prized cow to breed to whoever suited him, but was also glad that his own protectiveness of that particular part of himself was backed by his pimp. Tony was greedy in wanting to choose how own mate, even if he would never have the freedom other omega’s had in doing so. This marriage and this man was his choice in a way that so few of his partner’s had been. He had picked Steve, not for love or even lust, but he still chose him.
The couple’s young son soon began screaming and crying as well, a habit which he had taken up recently whenever his baby sister started wailing. At least Peter only joined in on the crying when Sarah was really in need of something or distressed.
Steven’s finger’s brushed Tony’s as he took the goblet and drank. It felt like little bolts of lightning sparked between them when their skin touched. Tony barely noticed the crowd cheering again as Steven looked down on him. The people around them must have gone back to dancing as the noise ramped up again, but to felt like Tony and his new fiancé were in their own world.
The Parkers had been old friends of Tony's and when they had come to Tony and Steve with their young son begging them to protect him, Steve and Tony were more than happy to do everything they could. Including adopting the young child when his entire biological family were murdered by Hydra. Thankfully, Richard and Mary Parker had kept Hydra from knowing that they had a son and were able to entrust Peter to Steve and Tony before it was too late.
Tony hooked his arm through his fiancé’s as the doors before them opened. They entered at the back of the hall and walked their way around the tables of people to where the large chairs still sat. There was now a table placed directly in front of the chairs that were occupied by the other members of the royal family. They walked down the front table to the two seats in the center and took their place.
Steve made quick work of Tony’s belt with one hand while the other kept him thoroughly preoccupied. Once the younger man’s belt was finally off, Steve removed both his hands from Tony’s body eliciting a whimper from the man above him.
Steve handed Tony the baby and she gurgled happily before settling quietly into Tony's arms. A small smile flashed across Tony's face before he refocused himself. Steve reached over and pointed at the embroidered name.
Richard Parker had explained to the super hero couple how the little baby had gotten his powers when he and his wife had left Peter with Steve and Tony. Peter had somehow managed to get into the container where Richard was keeping the genetically modifies spiders he had been working on during his time undercover at OSCORP, and the baby had been bitten. After a couple of hours of crying on Peter's part and a frantic Mary asking her husband exactly what those spiders would do to their son, Peter had calmed down and within a matter of days was displaying the new abilities the spider bite had given him. Richard had immediately destroyed the remaining spiders, even thought he knew their affects were directly linked to his own DNA and therefore would only work on himself, bis brother Ben, and his son Peter.
“Its terrible.” Tony finally said, shattering the silence of the house. “They’re all dead. The other Avengers. Our team. Their bodies are scattered all over the place.”
Steve slowly made his way out of the conference portion of the helacarier's main control room. He navigated his way through the ship to the medical wing and to the small room that Fury had arranged for the little ones.
“Bucky understands that you are my one and only. That is one of the many reasons why he is my Tanist, my right hand. He will honor you and our vows even if I should die tomorrow.” Steve said solemnly.
Steve smiled, “Its near the coast in a sheltered valley. There is a forest nearby and a mountain range less than a morning’s ride.” Steve blushed. “I hope you’ll like it.”
Tony peaked inside the two trunks on either end of the armoire and found the one on the left hand side filled with cloaks and other common items and the one to the right was filled with shining armor on top of which was a large circular shield with a star emblazoned on it. Tony carefully closed the trunk again. He then moved the empty trunk by the door to be dealt with later.
Peter was staring up at his parents in fascination, one fist, that had once held a handful of cheerios, stuffed entirely into his mouth. Tony looked down dramatically at where Steve had indicated, took in the image of his son, blinked, and then looked back at Steve.
“Steven, I offer this goblet as a symbol of how our pairing with be full and sustaining.” Tony said.
“It is an honor to meet you Anthony. I am so glad to be welcoming a third son to my family.” Steven’s mother said with that same glowing smile on her face.
A hush fell over the throne room. The lords and ladies of the court who had previously been milling around the edges of the room were suddenly silent except for the few shocked gasps that escaped from the gaggle. The King turned away from his captain of the guard, James Rhodes, to look at the man approaching him. The minute his eyes landed on the white star in the center of the silver armor, he tensed.
“I am sorry, I don’t have a goblet as fine as the one you have given me for you to use.” Steven said, genuine regret coloring his voice and filling his eyes. “But, I promise you, I will give you a goblet more befitting of you on our true wedding night.”
"Oh, so she will hate us for naming her Sarah hm?" Steve said, almost daring Tony to disagree with him again.
"…And make sure Peter doesn't get into the cupboards again. Last time we had to re-buy everything. Emergency numbers are on the fridge. And…" Steve continued.
"Thank you!" Tony practically squealed before jumping up, pressing a kiss to Steve's cheek, and skipping over to the shield agent that Fury had assigned to managing all the legal details of the adoption.
He deftly jumped through the hole in the wall and began looking around the inside of the building. He had made it about halfway through the rather large structure when a loud sound made him jump.
The man gestured to the hall behind him and Tony dutifully closed the door to his and his fiancé’s quarters before following him.
Steve wrapped his arms firmly around Tony and pulled him tightly to his body so that the man was pressed firmly to his chest, his head resting right under the larger man’s chin.
"Oh God!" Tony exclaimed. "I'm sorry. I thought you would recognize me. I mean its kind of hard not to."
It was this scene that a triumphant looking Tony charged in on, newly printed birth certificate in hand. Tony paused for an instant as he took in the sight before him. His lover stood tall with their two children clutched in his arms, a happy and contented look on his face face. Their son, one thumb in his mouth and the other arm still clutching his teddy bear, balanced on Steve's hip. Their new baby girl sleeping curled against Steve's strong chest. It was a sight to behold and Tony could feel his heart melting into a giant puddle of mush at how wonderful it all was.
About a minute into Steve's rant, Tony got bored and decided that now was a good time to try to get his very worried lover out of the house. Tony had managed to get Steve part of the way to the door again, but Steve was still continuing to shout instructions over his shoulder.
Steven was starting to look distinctly uneasy now. Tony knew that the Celts didn’t follow the same types of customs the Etruscan’s did and had probably never seen anyone greet their leaders in such a way.
A rush of affection swam through Tony’s chest… wait. No. Thats not what it was. It can’t be. Tony refused to admit he might already have a crush on his husband. That was unacceptable. It was too early, they had only know each other less than a day. The whole point of this marriage was to get a strong warrior with a skilled army to marry him so that he could take his city back. Affection and feelings were not part of the deal! He was just lucky his husband was hot. It would make the sex better.
“No, I am not going to tell you where they are. I’m sure you and ned will be running around them far sooner than I’m ready for, but promise me that you will always tell Jarvis, Uncle Rhodey, or me when you do. For my sake?”
Suddenly a cry erupted from the baby monitor on Steve’s night stand. The couple jumped and broke apart, both of them looking at the baby monitor that the genius billionaire had enhanced because he’s Tony Stark. How could he ever resist improving upon the poor excuse for a machine that Clint had given them once they told him about adopting Peter?
Tony huffed and closed his legs. “Fine.” He turned onto his side. “Are your sure you don’t want to hear the rest of—”
It took more willpower than the King dared to admit for his eyes to move up from the breast plate to his face. The sky blue eyes he found there bore into his even from across the expanse of the throne room. To anyone else those eyes would only show determination and fierceness, but the King has seen those eyes filled will more emotion than anyone else. He knew what those eyes looked like above him and filled with passion, he knew what they looked like when brimming with love and the joy of fatherhood, and he knew what they looked like when consumed by hurt and anguish. He could see that now. The same hurt and anguish they had shown when the man had betrayed him, but now there was a heaviness to them that the King was unfamiliar with. A weight that had settled on the man’s soul.
Steve and Tony just stood there in complete shock and bewilderment before realizing that they should probably go and try to help their friend with their rampaging toddler.
“Tony!” Steve yelled, turning to fully face his partner, while their infant son looking tiredly between his parents with a pacifier in his mouth and an elephant plushy clutched tightly in his little arms.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Peter had also begun to explore more of his powers and had recently been spending most of his time on the walls and the roof. Which had initially scared Steve to no end until he realized that Peter was in compete control of his powers, which he had possessed since long before his adoption.
Steve and Tony had made their way back to the shield helacarier with their two little ones and the rest of the avengers, who were enjoying fussing over their nephew and new baby niece. The head doctor on board had cleared the little baby girl and had concluded that she was about a week old. Steve and Tony had therefore estimated her birthday as May 19th.
Steve regretfully withdrew his hand allowing Tony to pull away again. Steve placed his goblet of meed down next to him and retrieved the satchel from where he had placed it on the furs without Tony’s notice. Stupid. Tony chided to himself. How had he been too lost in Steve to notice something so simple? He needed to be better then that. He couldn’t let Steve see his weaknesses.
“Well I guess I should start with how my father wasn’t a very good king. He cared little of the wellbeing of his citizenry so long as they were well enough provided for to pay taxes to him. Because of that, he expanded the city’s mercantile class and made it the trading capital of the Etruscan empire. But the people who suffered because of it…”
Steve pulled him even tighter against his body and nuzzled his head against Tony’s as a way of both urging him to continue and comforting his love.
Once the entirety of the Avengers team was gathered in one of the more informal dining rooms within King T’Challa’s palace, Steve and Tony explained how their daughter had been having strange reactions to people or events and how she would sometimes start screaming with terrible headaches.
Steven’s bright smile seemed like a good enough marker for Tony to say he had done fine. Then again that may also have something to do with the omega call to his alpha’s vows, but Tony preferred his own interpretation.
"Why don't we just use both of them so that we can get her birth certificate made up before we land?" Steve implored.
Tony pushed open the door and quickly dropped his hand. There standing just inside the entrance to the floor stood Steve Rogers.
"Thanks Thor. We shouldn't be back too late. See you latter" With this Tony started trying to lead his partner to the door.
“No. Please don’t.” Tony implored in as firm a voice as he could manage, seeing as he was basically begging his future-husband to care about him in a way Tony had never expected anyone to, and still didn’t. It was a weak naive hope that Tony thought he had let go of years ago. Apparently that was not the case.
Steve winced. “Lord Commander Rhodes thought I was best placed here. After all, I would never let anyone past me if I was guarding the two of you.” Steve looked down at his feet and bit his lip.
This ended up backfiring because Tony, as it turned out, couldn't decide between their two top picks. Finally after getting tired of Tony's complaining, and due to their near imminent arrival at shield headquarters, Steve intervened yet again.
Tony took a breath as the pieces of knowledge began to fall into place. A Chernogorivkan woman with red hair who was much farther north and west than a member of her tribe ever should be.
Tony flashed Steve a cocky smirk and was met in turn by an angry scowl. Tony's smile slipped immediately and he realized a little belatedly that he was in a lot more trouble than he thought.
Burying his nose in Tony’s hair, Steve continued, “This has gone too far. I’m worried about you. I’m so worried.” He pulled him closer to him as if he could absorb the other man’s pain into himself.
“I’m full,” Steve declared loudly when Bucky let out a soft moan and his eyelids drooped. He shoved his plate away and inwardly cursed his choice of costume again. Next year
Bucky stroked slowly up and down the swollen part of the tentacle, clearly searching for what felt best. When he rubbed his thumb over the groove on the inside Tony all but wailed, his other tentacles attaching themselves to Steve’s legs. Steve wouldn’t be able to wear shorts for weeks and he loved every second of it.
“Are you… are you in pain, Tony? How are you feeling?” Bucky had stepped closer as well, running a hand over Tony’s back, stopping just short of where his ass used to be. “I’m so sorry I didn’t stop you, doll,” he said, and looked heartbroken.
It took some doing to get Tony situated in the tub. Steve got soaked in the process, but the happy, relieved smile Tony gave him when he finally felt his bladder, that was somehow still in the human part of his body, empty was worth every inch of the trouble.
Bucky didn’t even deign to receive Steve’s look of annoyance, whipping his phone out his robe pocket instead.
“Hey, stop it. I don’t peek under your robe, do I?” Tony batted Bucky’s hand away with a human hand and slithered off Steve’s lap.
How the hell Tony had come to that conclusion would forever remain a mystery because Steve remembered it was the right front one and reached out to wrap his hand around it. While looking Tony in the eye he brought the hectodick to his lips and gave it an experimental lick. The taste was bland, slightly rubbery, but the shudder that went through the whole appendage was delicious. He loved proving a point.
“You should eat in a bra more often,” he said with a grin around a mouthful of pancake. He really shouldn’t eat this much, it spelled two extra morning runs this week, but Bucky’s food was just too damn good.
Steve put his hands on his hips as he tried to see if one of the arms was different from the others, but from where he was standing they all looked the same.
Steve bent down to look at the tip of another tentacle. “This one doesn’t, so I think that’s your… penis arm?”
Suddenly Bucky squeezed his hand painfully tight and came violently, muttering a string of curses with his whole body shuddering and jerking against Steve. He needed only a few more strokes himself before he shot over the edge as well, biting his hand to keep from moaning too loud as he came harder than he had in a long while.
They managed to hobble upstairs and crashed in their bed in a tangle of limbs and more limbs, falling asleep feeling sated and secure. Post hangover sex naps were the absolute best, in Steve’s opinion.
“Hey, that’s not playing fair, see if I’ll make you pancakes,” Bucky replied grumpily as he picked up his phone. At Tony’s pout he relented and after an almost shy kiss on Tony’s cheek he went downstairs to get more coffee and bake more greasy food though.
When Steve winked at him, mouth still full, he felt something curl around his ankle under the table. He almost choked on his pancake, until he saw Tony looking smug. The tentacle slowly moved until it wriggled its way underneath the fabric of Steve’s overalls, caressing the skin of his calf.
The first tentacle Tony lifted had a groove on the inside, running all the way from the tip to where Steve couldn’t see anymore. “Like this?” He waved the tentacle in front of Bucky, who looked up to frown at it as well.
“Where’s your dick?” Bucky suddenly asked, studying Tony’s lower body. It made Tony stop trying to get ahold of the zipper to look down as well. Steve suppressed both the urge to throw something at Bucky and to pull the zipper down himself; it was a reasonable question.
The final piece fell into place for Tony. “We’ve met before.” Tony paused. “Or I at least saw you across the ballroom one night in my father’s palace. Though I remember the name Natalia floating round the rumor mill around that time.”
Tony had an equally relieved look and visibly slumped at having found his wayward children, however, he was much quicker to notice his daughter’s position and evident distress.
“Steve.” Tony reached out and cupped his husband’s jaw, Steven’s eyes shot up to meet Tony’s gaze. “My Steve.” He said with determination.
“Aw, aren’t you just the cutest little cock blocker ever?” Tony cooed in his baby voice, his lips puckering slightly to add to the over all affect.
The noise was so high pitched that it made the old minister wince, but King T’Challa did not. He recognized this noise and the particular nickname that was being screamed.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Tony made his way down the stairs to the floor dedicated to the royal children. Tony’s hand drifted self consciously to his belly when confronted with the nearly empty hall. There were half a dozen chambers on this floor, but only one was filled. He and Steve had only just had their son Peter when war broke out and then… well then there was no possibility of more children.
“I agree.” Steve stated softly looking over at his sleeping children. “We already have Peter to worry about. I honestly don’t know what I would do if I had to worry about both of my children’s growing abilities and the way people might try to use and manipulate those talents.”
“Whatever the circumstances,…” King T’Challa bravely broke the heavy silence. “she got the measure of my Minister rather quickly. I have always thought that something was off with that man, and she just proved that I was right to be suspicious.”
Steve reached over and the baby unconsciously grabbed hold of one of his fingers in her tiny fist. Peter chose this moment to once again drop his bag of cheerios, which was caught in an instant by Steve. This feat elected another ecstatic cry and bought clapping from Peter. Steve gently gave the bag back to Peter, who by this point had decided he was tired of being ignored again and started kicking Steve.
“No problem,” the man smirks, holding out a handful of napkins. “Not much left in there, lucky for you.”
There’s a muffled voice coming from the other end, along with a rustle of papers, before Steve speaks again. “
“It’s still dark out! Jesus Christ,” Tony mutters, nuzzling into a warm, deliciously firm shoulder a second later, and can’t hold back a happy sigh when Steve’s arms pull him closer. “Lemme sleep, you ass.”
“I can, um, I can cook for you? I’ve been told I make a mean Spaghetti sauce, so maybe if you want... It probably won’t be as nice a time as I was hopin’ to give ya,” Steve looks down, sounding more hesitant than he has in all the time they’ve known each other. “But I’d love to do it, all the same.”
you. Future you– put security measures in place in case it ever happened again. It hasn’t even been two hours, here.”
His breathing is deep and steady, chest rising and falling in a way that never fails to comfort Tony, but the hand holding his hasn’t gone limp, and it hasn’t let go.
He doesn’t know how he makes it all the way to the end, but eventually Steve sits in the middle of his gifts and starts opening them-- he does it every year, without fail, and it’s such a
“Honey,” Tony scoffs, and tells himself not to feel so giddy at the way Steve’s cheeks flush at the name. “If you think I don’t have a dozen other ways to get there–”
“I said… I love you.” Steve steps closer again, and his eyes are a sky Tony wants to spend the rest of his life living in.
“Yeah, well,” he shrugs, reigning in his laughter in the face of his husband’s ridiculously adorable excitement. “I figured it’d only be a matter of time before you’d go ahead and get one– and honey, I love you, but I can’t even imagine the kind of thing you’d bring in here.”
“But when you’re... when you’re that age, it’s simple-- have fun, get fed, and then just... have someone there, when the day’s done.”
“Me,” Natasha pipes up, pulling at his sweater, and Tony’s face softens as he presses a quick kiss to that red, red hair.
“He’s beauty and he’s grace, he’s falling on his face!” Clint sings as he skates by, leaping and landing a perfect triple axel a second later, and not even Steve can hold back a chuckle at the ridiculousness of it all.
Steve smiles again. “Good choice, kiddo. But you should probably get that homework done first, alright?”
“Actually, I’m feeling a little pain, these ropes are pretty rough. Wanna play nurse?” he asks, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively, because even tied to a chair in an abandoned warehouse, Tony’s always had a fine eye for beauty, and she’s got it in spades.
“Back atcha, Shellhead,” Steve says, even as his own cheeks turn the softest shade of pink, and Tony smothers the urge to press his lips to the warm skin. “It’s good to be home.”
Of course the universe would find a way to screw him over, just because it’s the most important thing Tony’s ever done.
– is replaced with a soft warmth Tony doesn’t think he’s felt since he was a boy, and it takes him more than a few moments to recognize it as awe.
“So, either of you wanna tell us how you ended up here?” Tony asks, and tries not to feel like a parent being called in to their child’s school.
“Hey, Shellhead.” His voice is rough and tired, but it’s still the most beautiful thing Tony’s ever heard.
“Probably,” Tony chuckles, and Steve turns to face him just in time to see the gleam in his eyes turn wicked. “But can you blame them, gorgeous? You’re fucking unreal.”
“It’s fine, Captain,” Pepper says. “I need to check over some things with my secretary, and I promised to talk to the Head of Marketing, so I’ll just eat on my way.”
“I just… I don’t know why I’m doing this anymore.” Tony says softly, tucking his head under Steve’s chin. “I know we talked about winning and, y’know, being up there together, and… You’re a shoo in, babe, that’s a given. You don’t even have to do any of this shit, but…”
The silence is just a little more calm this time, but there’s no mistaking the tense line of Steve’s body.
“Yeah, you’re right,” he says, and then takes a step closer until their chests are almost touching. “I haven’t even asked you out.”
“God, I love you,” Steve breathes, and as they push further into the trees, Tony lets the words wash over him like the warmest blanket.
“We sure do,” Steve grins, and bops Tony’s nose as he picks up a handful of oranges with his free hand. “Hows about you and I go make some art, huh?”
“You’re damn fucking right we’re okay, you big, beautiful idiot,” Tony laughs, and it’s a little watery but neither of them give a damn. “I’m a genius, baby– how could I ever even think about letting go of the best thing that’s ever happened to me? Besides,” he says, and cups Steve’s face in his hands. “My only good dreams now are about you.”
But even though they’ve talked, they’re not the tightest of friends, and Tony decides one afternoon that he really fucking needs to change that, which is how it all starts.
His mind is a mess of alcohol, broken glass and scraped knees, and the sound of his father’s screams won’t fucking leave him, so
know, because he’s not in the habit of making acquaintances with the city’s criminal underbelly. But he’s heard a lot about the man, how he runs his part of town like no other, with an efficiency both ruthless and kind. How he will not kill unless one of his own’s been put on the line. In a world of devils, he sounds like an avenging angel— if an angel ever dipped his hand into the business almost as bad as hell.
“Good morning,” Steve tells her, depositing a full plate of pancakes, eggs and bacon in front of her a second later with a grin, and she returns the greeting with one of her own.
“That doesn’t work,” Tony whines, and in the moonlight peaking out from the window, sees Steve roll his eyes.
The words fall out of Tony’s mouth before he can stop them, and he almost cowers under the steely blue glare aimed his way.
Steve smiles into Tony’s hair even as his eyes stay closed. The feeling of cool crisp sheets is rivaled only by the warm, delicious touch of Tony’s hands on his chest, and lower… “Now?”
“Got a party this weekend. Thought you could drag yourself out of your big, empty mansion and come around for a couple of hours.”
“He’s– he’s not my boyfriend,” he says, even as he catches Tony’s eye and returns the wave sent his way.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“No!” Captain America declared firmly before turning around to place the now nodding off Peter in his crib.
The couple nodded and the conversation soon drifted to other, though not always lighter, topics. Steve and Tony, however, spent the majority of that night, and many to come, worrying over the fate of their children. Particularly the now prominent possibility that their baby girl could develop an ability, and a fairly powerful one by the looks of it.
Tony heard what was distinctly a growl from behind him. Apparently his new alpha was the possessive type. Thor squeezed Tony one last time before putting him down. He slapped a hand down on Steven’s shoulder.
When he finally returned home, Captain America was a mess. He had cried for days about Bucky and having lost him again. Tony did everything he could to comfort his lover, but it didn't seem to make much impact. The only thing that could heal Steve was his family’s love and time.
Steve wished they could film this, but even his horny self knew that was a bad idea. Instead, he looked back to see four tentacles move their way, Tony frowning in intense concentration.
“Look, you were right,” Bucky said and lifted his laptop to show Tony something, the beginning of a smile on his lips.
“You’re disgusting, Steven, and you called Bucky here a caveman. Honestly, I feel like Pygmalion here. No more eating in underwear if you don’t learn some manners,” Tony reacted haughtily.
As he sat up the headache didn’t get worse, and he didn’t feel the need to run to the toilet to barf. Drinking water for the win! He would never do shots again though. He vaguely remembered someone dressed as a sexy zombie challenging him to a shots duel, and well, he never backed down from a challenge, did he? What followed was a haze. He thought Tony and Bucky had carried him home between them. He knew he’d had two liters of water before going to sleep and yeah, that was what had woken him.
To make up for it, he cleared the table, washed up and finally changed out of the smelly overalls into sweats and a shirt. Shower would have to wait.
" Bucky exclaimed, arching his back into the touch. Steve tried to memorize every detail because he was definitely gonna try and draw this. The vibrant red of the tentacle was beautiful against Bucky's tanned skin, curled possessively around Bucky's bared throat.
“Better stop or he’s gonna pop before the fun part,” Bucky warned, so Steve pulled back and wiped his chin on his sleeve.
Steve had to agree. The tentacles started around where Tony’s hips should be, as thick as Steve’s thigh and gradually tapering off towards the tip. They were a vivid red, but where they hit the light they shimmered and appeared almost golden. It fit really well with the Princess Leia costume he was still wearing the top half of.
“Come here, sweet thing.” He held open his arms and watched fascinated how Tony used four of the tentacles to move himself from his chair to Steve’s lap. As soon as he was settled Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, at the border where his human skin transformed into a rougher texture.
“How do you want us?” Bucky asked Tony, kissing along his jaw. Steve didn’t wait for an answer, but pulled off his clothes in a few swift movements. He knew whatever Tony came up with was gonna be good. He stroked himself as he watched Bucky torment Tony with his tongue and teeth. When he lubed up his hand and reached lower, to prepare himself, Tony batted his hand away with a tentacle.
“Sir, yes sir,” Bucky griped, but it was faint, his whole posture slumped as he was weighed down with fatigue and worry.
“I kinda liked sitting in your lap,” Tony confessed, two of his tentacles and his human arms wiggling nervously, like it was something to be ashamed of. Steve didn’t understand, Tony sat in his lap more often, but maybe octopeople didn’t do that?
From inside the bathroom a soft sob could be heard and Steve saw how much Bucky regretted his outburst, rubbing his forehead as a way of hiding it. “I’m worried, Steve,” Bucky whispered, “I don’ know what’s going on.”
“Woah, did you know octopuses have nine brains? Every tentacle has its own brain.” Bucky exclaimed, making all three of them look intently at the tentacles for a minute.
Steve nearly missed Tony's quiet “me neither,” when Bucky came up the stairs with a breakfast from heaven.
Steve turned the other way to look at Bucky what had gotten Tony so excited and startled. The suckers had left an imprint, perfectly circular marks in a broad line across Bucky's shoulders.
“Tsk, oh ye of little faith. I’ve done the math, honestly, if my math says it’s safe then it’s safe.”
“I need to sit,” he moaned, his knees wobbling when another upstroke rubbed the underside of his cock just right.
“Of course you do, not even you are that perfect,” Tony’s sullen voice was moving away from the door again.
“Got it,” Tony smiled when Bucky pulled back, playing with the rope of Bucky’s bathrobe with one hand. “Hentai, huh?”
“Are we breaking down the door?” he asked casually when he put the tray onto the floor and sat down cross-legged across from Steve.
Steve knew this could only spell trouble with a capital T, but he was too sore and probably still drunk because the logic of why this would be bad eluded him at the moment. His groan was too weak to be heard above the Greek that now came from Tony’s mouth like he was born on mount Olympus, and when he tried to move, the world, or his brain, or both spun so hard he very purposefully stayed as still as possible. Whatever was about to happen couldn’t be any worse than how he felt right now, he thought, right before he passed out again.
“Wow,” Bucky said slumped against Steve, stroking the tentacle nearest to him, a thing Steve momentarily didn’t feel the strength to do.
, and suddenly there's a blindin’ blue light and the sound of waves, and when my eyesight comes back I see a bunch a
Steve still had no clue what was going on here. It seemed a bit too elaborate to be a prank, but what Bucky claimed was too preposterous to be true. His headache was steadily getting worse, and Steve knew the painkillers were in the bathroom with Tony.
When Steve woke everything was quiet. Too quiet. More like an absence of sound than true tranquility. There should’ve been snoring, for instance. Maybe the prittle prattle of a coffee machine or the running of the shower. Instead there was nothing, and the unease this caused made Steve wake up faster than he would’ve liked. At least the world didn’t spin anymore when he tried to move.
“Did you take a good look at that text you were readin’ from? Cause now we’ve calmed down and eaten some I’m thinkin’ we can look for clues, yeah?”
“Hey fellas?” Steve said as he nuzzled the back of Tony’s neck, wrapping a possessive arm around his waist.
“I kinda see the perks of this now,” Tony shrugged and wiggled two tentacles while he used two others to unfasten the clips of his bra, clearly showing off.
A tentacle was hidden under Bucky’s robe, and Steve guessed he was getting the same treatment. That was more than fine by him so he resumed kissing Bucky as filthy as he could, to give Tony a show. It seemed to work, because the tentacle in his pants started rubbing the tip up and down his crack, and he had to stop kissing momentarily, leaning his forehead against Bucky’s.
“Excuse you, I just proved that the nonsense in this book is indeed nonsense. The worst that can happen is that we’ll smell of seaweed until the sun sets.”
The look Bucky shot him was part annoyance and part something else entirely. “Look, I was convinced it was some kind of drunken hallucination thing? Like, how everyone looks prettier when you’re drunk, only with more limbs? But why the hell would Tony be in the bathroom for, what time was it again, six hours if there wasn’t something fishy going on?” Bucky said as he waved a piece of toast at Steve.
Steve sighed quietly, willing his racing heart to calm down a bit. Tony never ever admitted to being afraid, always taking on whatever scared him headfirst. It was one of the things Steve loved about him, his blatant refusal to be cowed. The man on the other side of the door didn't sound like his Tony at all, and it scared Steve more than he could let on, because his lovers were counting on him.
Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair and kissed him deeply, without hurry. Steve only startled the slightest bit when two tentacles wrapped themselves around his shoulders, pulling him closer. He absentmindedly wondered how much strength was in them, but it was a backseat thought. His first concern was getting the stupid overalls off.
The tentacles travelled higher, sadly ignoring his ass, but when Tony made them latch onto the skin of his back and
Tony didn’t mind, if the soft smile was anything to go by, and Steve waited patiently for him to put down his fork.
“Geez, doll,” Bucky breathed when Steve sucked the tentacle in, letting his tongue play around the suckers. Tony looked at him wide eyed, biting his lower lip which meant he was trying to keep silent. Steve briefly closed his eyes when Bucky tangled his fingers in his hair, guiding Steve’s movements.
“C’mere, you. It’s your turn now,” Bucky waved Tony closer, grabbing hold of the dicktentacle that was swollen stiff and slick with lube.
“Bet that feels good, don’t it,” Bucky asked Tony who nodded but didn’t look away from where Steve tried to suck in even more. The tip began to stiffen under his ministrations, which must’ve meant he was doing something right. The way it had rendered Tony speechless was intoxicating, and apart from the suckers it was just like sucking a human dick.
“We love you no matter how many appendages you have, you know that, right?” Steve asked as earnestly as he could, looking deep in Tony’s eyes. It was imperative to him Tony knew this. Tony was gorgeous to him no matter how he looked.
Steve shuddered when Tony started with stroking their calves, the sensation so different from human hands, but also not, because Tony knew exactly where to tease them to make them shudder and the skin erupt in goosebumps.
“M’kay, I’ll just wait here for Bucky to come and bring us breakfast.” Steve knew only Tony could outstubborn him and Bucky, so trying to convince him when the other had made up his mind about camping out in the bathroom was as futile as trying to stay dry in a thunderstorm with nothing but a napkin. (He might’ve tried.)
"Here?" Tony asked innocently as he traced the shape of one pec with the tip of a tentacle, "or here?" The tentacle moved to cover Steve's nipple, sucking itself firmly attached.
“So that’s four hours to enact all of our favourite hentai?” Bucky grinned next to him, earning him a swat from one of the tentacles.
“Thanks Tony.” Steve popped two pills in his mouth and dry-swallowed them, shuddering at the awful taste.
“Told ya, after you passed out on us Tony tried out one of the spells in that old tome we got at the yard sale last year, remember? Said it was a Halloweeny thing to do.” Bucky took a big bite of his bacon and egg sandwich and chewed thoughtfully. “So he's talkin’ Latin--”
"It feels like I'm fondling you with twenty fingers at once," Tony said in wonder, reaching out to mark Bucky's front as well.
“On your hands and knees, both of you,” Tony said, and just the thought of what was about to happen sent a thrill through Steve strong enough to make him shiver. He wasn’t the only one, if the speed by which Bucky  complied was anything to go by, and soon they were leaning with their forearms on the couch, ass presenting to Tony.
There was a glint in his eye and a blush to his cheeks that told Steve Tony was liking the way they were approaching things now, so he bent forward to pull Tony into a kiss, a real one with tongues and lips and Tony’s hands in his hair. Steve pushed the bra down far enough to bare Tony’s nipples, running his hands gently up and down over them until they were stiff and sensitive and Tony moaned low in his throat.
He reached out for another piece of bacon when suddenly it hit him with the force of a heavy truck, or a tsunami, to stay with the nautical theme.
“Okay, let’s get you back in the bathroom so it doesn’t matter where you let go,” Steve said and half carried Tony the few steps back. “Wanna sit on my lap?” Steve didn’t know if Tony could fit anymore, his lower half was large now, but he didn’t mind getting squashed or peed on if it made his lover feel better.
