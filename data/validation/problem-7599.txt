“Good sir, would you do us the honours?” Tony asked the priest, who was seated off to the side and in shock by everything that had just happened. “We don’t need a long ceremony or anything, but if I could be married to these two, that would be great.”
Steve felt his own emotions bubbling up as he watched Bucky cry into his hand, finally stepping forward to take a seat next to him. Putting his arm around Bucky’s shoulders, he pulled him in close, hugging him as tightly as he could. He didn’t ever want to let him go again.
“Are you kidding? That’s the most fun thing we do, of course I want to have sex again,” Bucky said, blushing when both of his husbands burst out laughing. “Shut up, both of you.”
“Good, because I can’t sleep,” Steve said as he let out a sigh, pulling Bucky closer in their pile of hay and blankets. His nose itched badly, but he didn’t want to let go of the other man. “Tomorrow is it, it’s the wedding. We’re hopefully never going to have to sleep in a pile of hay again.”
“Are…are you…?” Steve was shocked beyond words, not knowing where to even start with how terribly wrong this was. His morning with Peggy forgotten, all he could think of was Howard Stark kidnapping Bucky from the hospital only to subject him to tests so he could make a baby machine for his son. “D-do you even like men?” He didn’t want to think about Bucky being raped on top of everything.
“If you’re wondering about your things, we spoke to your mother last night, and someone will go collect them today,” Pepper reassured him, figuring the man would want to have his possessions, as few as they may be.
“My gods…” Bucky threw back the hood, taking a deep breath of relief as he looked over at Steve doing the same. “I don’t want to be a monk. Ever.”
“I’m looking for it…here, right there,” Bucky said, positioning the wand and holding his breath so he could get a good look at the screen. In the middle of what looked like greyish white static, there was a black void, and inside it a blurry ring. “That.”
“Pretty please?” Tony whispered back, leaning over and kissing him soundly.
“Very good idea,” Pepper nodded, her voice tight and irritated, eyebrows raised as she tried to contain herself. “Go. Now.”
“I can go first, I don’t mind. Tony…” Steve locked eyes with his boyfriend as he took his hand, flashing him a smile as he realized what he wanted to say. “Tony, you are so compassionate, you have so much life and love in you, and being around you makes me feel the same way. So I’m saying you’re contagious, but in the best way possible. Thank you for inviting me into your home and heart, you’re amazing, and I love you to pieces. And Bucky…” Steve turned to him next, unable to keep the corner of his lips from lifting as he squeezed Bucky’s hand. “I think you’re the first person I really loved with all my heart. You’re constantly saying about the things you don’t know or haven’t seen, and I just want to experience it all while holding your hand. I don’t want to let go of you, I feel like all the light would go out in me…” Taking a deep breath, Steve fought back tears as he looked at Bucky, trying his best to calm down. “I love you so much…”
“I taped a plastic sheet to the backseat, we can put him there, and then we’ll have to drive really slowly and carefully because I don’t see those bumps being very good for someone in labour. In retrospect, I should have gotten this road fixed and paved,” Tony said, mentally kicking himself for missing that detail. He was going to feel guilt for every pain Bucky had along that road.
“Call me a nerd, but I’m hoping for a log cabin style place. I made a small one for a show and tell once,” Steve chuckled sheepishly, though he was glad that his tales of being a dork usually made Bucky laugh.
“That is more than okay, that’s perfect!” Tony grinned, loving the mix of wonder and possible fear this was going to inspire in people. What mattered is that it gave them something to talk about on top of the upcoming wedding. “Can you make it a bit scary? I think people like a bit of a scare.”
And how could King Anthony resist a good mystery?
“There’s a table right there, Janet uses it for whatever she’s modeling,” Tony moved past Steve, going over to the table and sitting on the corner. “We can bring in furniture, people, whatever you want. Animals maybe, though I don’t know how still they are.”
“Don’t beat yourself up any more,” said Bucky, burying his face against Steve’s neck, closing his eyes. “…let’s not talk about that any more, or Tony…let’s just sit like this for now. Let’s just pretend everything is going to be okay.”
“I want to do it for you,” Bucky said, biting this inside of his cheek as he managed to peel off a piece of blood covered wood, setting it neatly aside before he began to saw at it again.
Stane paced back and forth through his study, hands clasped behind his back, counting his own footfalls across the stone floor. It felt like seconds were passing as minutes, the sun had gone from the pinnacle of the sky down nearly half way into setting. He would have sworn he watched every minute of it moving across the heavens, but the ache from his knees reminded him that he’d covered miles walking back and forth. He didn’t see every second of it descending, though he wished he’d spent his time more fruitfully. He could have at least read a book.
“Anything you like,” Pepper reassured him with a smile. “If you want to keep your hair long, Jarvis can just tidy up the ends a bit. He’s quite good at what he does.”
“I haven’t found a reason why not yet and…” Tony gave them a quizzical look, trying to figure out what was going on exactly. He’d spent time with these two men at the same time before, at it usually involved more angry glaring and less comforting hugs. “You two want to tell me what’s going on?”
“I tried, but every time I did, you interrupted me and wanted me to see something,” Pepper pointed out softly, really not trying to make him feel better about himself,  but it was about time for the truth. “You weren’t willing to lead for a long time, you wanted to do your own thing.”
Bucky stared at Steve for a moment, not knowing what to say to the compliments he was giving him. He’d never thought very highly of himself, and even his last companion hadn’t said things like that, and he’d claimed to be in love with Bucky. He felt like for the first time in his life, someone was appreciating who he was, someone genuinely liked him, it was far beyond his wildest expectations.
“And did you even almost get caught?” Tony was seething now, wanting to hunt down Nick Fury and tell him off for his lax security teams. He wanted his fiancés safe, this obviously wasn’t safe, and he wasn’t happy.
“He’s carrying my children, you won’t shoot him either,” Tony said, about to step forward when he watched his father take the safety off the gun, directing it back at Bucky.
“Yes, I want to see him! Now!” Tony shouted, standing up, his brain throwing questions and fears at him faster than he could process them.
“So…” Stane paused for a moment, not sure exactly how to put this. “So I can’t guarantee Tony wouldn’t be stupid enough to give up the crown for these two disgusting peasants. I can see him just throwing it aside for a normal life, leave a vacuum behind, and again, that would leave us fighting for it like everyone else.”
“What if I’m right?” Bucky asked, pushing down his pyjama pants to squirt some gel on his stomach, picking up the probe to run over his lower stomach.
“Oh…yeah, I guess we can get some for the family, I just wanted a snack,” Bucky laughed, finishing off his orange juice, and reaching into the cooler beside him for a bottle of water. “I’m going to regret this, I don’t want to get up and go to the bathroom.”
“So…this is a competition?” Steve asked, looking back over at Bucky, feeling guilty that he wouldn’t look back at him.
“My birthday is coming up, it’s in a month, and I’m not married yet,” Tony explained, turning his body to face Rhodey. “They’re saying I have to choose now between Steve and Bucky, and I have to have this wedding pretty much immediately. Pepper has already planned everything, they’re going to start decorating the chapel.”
“Everything with you is serious,” Tony didn’t budge in the least except to sink in his chair a bit. “Can’t we just ignore tradition? I mean, we got rid of killing a servant during the Night Sky Festival, surely we can get rid of this.”
“Uhm, not often, really. I don’t have a good sense of the movement of time because it was the same thing every day, but I’d say…maybe once a month?” Bucky said, making a scrunched up face as he tried to think about it more intently. “He always made sure I had a picture of you on my wall, and he’d tell me that you were going to have children with me. I didn’t know if you would raise them with me or just use me for breeding, though, he never said what kind of person you were, and he never said if you’d even like me. Just that you were very smart, and that I was going to make smart children with you.”
“And it better be working because we want to see some skin, damn it,” Tony whistled, clapping his hands together with a cheeky smile on his face. “Take it off! Take it off!”
“I think you might be be better off where you are,” Steve said as he took a seat himself, not bothering with the menu either. He didn’t feel very hungry at the moment, but he knew he had to order something. “I haven’t had one of those for a long time, that and a coffee sounds perfect right now.”
“Thank you,” Bucky nodded, just glad that their family members were okay, though he knew he’d feel better when he saw them for himself.
“Of course, we’ll just leave a few shorter pieces in the front,” Jarvis said, combing through Bucky’s thick hair. “And what would you like to do about your beard? Will you be wanting a shave or a trim?”
“I already told Bucky we’d both fuck him later at the same time,” Steve grinned, reaching down to give Bucky’s ass a squeeze before putting his hand against the small of his back. “I mean, unless you had other plans in mind.”
“What are their names? I’ll have them fetched from the crowd,” Stane offered, stepping out of the shadows, his hands tented in front of him. “Their names?”
Steve’s eyebrows raised immediately, looking at the woman as if to ask if she was serious. When she didn’t even blink, he knew that she was waiting, and if he really wanted this, he better speak up.
Steve just closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to picture two little ones running all over the place, driving them crazy every chance they’d get. He was scared for Bucky, that thought hadn’t left his mind for a second, but there was a glimmer of hope for a perfect future that he couldn’t help wanting to dwell on. His husbands, his children, he needed for all of them to make it safely out of this.
“I swear, you two drive me insane,” Bucky shook his head, not even trying to push it any more than that. He knew when he was beaten, and he honestly didn’t mind losing to those two. “You’re lucky I love you both so much.”
“The lottery,” Tony said matter of factly, finishing his drink and gesturing for another.
Tony stood up from his seat, tugging Bucky in closer to hug him tightly, rubbing his back in slow circles. Breathing in the smell of the shampoo from the guest bedroom, he made a mental note to get some for his own bathroom. “I think Steve’s right, I think you’d drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what could be influenced and what isn’t,” Tony said lowly, not wanting to let Bucky go now that he had him. “I’m not going to insult you and tell you what you’re feeling is fake, okay? You are who you are, and that’s why I like you.”
“I believe in you,” Tony said to him, clasping his hands in front of him as he looked at Steve, admiring how handsome he was. This competition couldn’t be on looks alone, though, because it would end in a stalemate. “And if there’s anything you don’t know how to do, Janet said she’d teach you.”
“You haven’t seen it yet,” Bucky said matter of factly, leaning back as Steve’s touch began to overwhelm him. He’d truly thought in all this time that his appearance had disgusted Steve, it was a miracle to know he didn’t. “Anyway, my question time, did you ever have a thing for Sam?”
“…I wish I could…I wish I could get you out of here…” Steve said softly, trying to rack his brain to think of some way he could get Bucky out of here, but Bucky couldn’t cross the doorway without getting electrocuted. “If you can’t get out of here, we’ll get you out of the mansion somehow.”
“Of course, anything,” Bucky said, looking up at him, a faint smile on his face.
“And your mom, Steve, does she need anything in particular?” Tony asked Steve, breaking his train of thought. “A pardon, a healer, anything?”
“…you know, there’s a bar in town that has a drink called the Sourtoe cocktail. It’s a glass with a shot of whiskey and a mummified toe, so if you want to join me and earn a certificate with your name on it, Stevie…” Tony chuckled, trying to lift the mood a bit, though he didn’t blame everyone for being exhausted and cranky after travelling for so long.
“Come in. But I can hear you wherever you are in this suite,” Natasha warned Steve as she backed off, going to take a seat, crossing her arms and legs.
“No. All I thought about all night was seeing you two again. I just thought you might want one,” Tony said softly, understanding Steve’s frustration. “We’re going to get him home soon.”
“It’s fine, I’m not going to be upset because you’re taking care of yourself. We were doing this anyway,” Steve reached over, taking Tony’s hand and giving it a squeeze. “We’ll just get to find out sooner, hopefully.”
“I can’t…” Tony began, finally finding his voice once he was under the covers, looking over Bucky’s head at Steve, then down at Bucky, unable to help giving him a very awkward smile. “I can’t believe, I…you’re both incredibly kind, and I’m incredibly blessed just to spend time with you.”
“I’m not alone, there are a lot of good men in that profession,” Steve felt like he should stick up for at least some of his coworkers, or former coworkers if this went well. “Like Sam, he’s a great friend and one of the nicest people out there.”
“Uncle, I…”
“There was no way I could convince Tony to marry you before now,” Stane scoffed, shaking his head. “I couldn’t convince him to do any of his Kingly duties beyond signing things. You think I could have made him marry you? He doesn’t even want to do it now, and his throne is on the line.”
“I wish I could forget it now,” Pepper put her elbows on the desk and leaned her head against her hands. “Can’t you go down in history for being the nicest king or something? Maybe the king with the most paintings, can’t I just find you some artists to do portraits? One for every outfit you own.”
“I, uhh, my marriage ended,” Steve said, deciding to just be upfront about it. If it was going to be a problem, he’d rather deal with it now than wait in paranoia for someone to take him out.
Steve wanted to call Tony arrogant and tell him that the were leaving the second the chip was out of him, but he couldn’t fault a single action Tony had made since they met. He was willing to save Bucky, he was willing to let him free, and Steve felt a bit guilty that he’d never considered that to be a possibility. He’d damned Tony before they’d even met, unfairly so, so the other man deserved a proper second chance.
“Who would I talk to about that?” Steve asked, wondering if he should start with something like an apple rather than jumping right to an animal.
“It’s worth the chance, Bucky,” Natasha said, pleased that he hadn’t hit anything or thrown something at something else. This was going much better than it would have with Namor.
“They would know the plight of many of the commoners, I’m sure they would be able to tell King Anthony what it’s like to live here,” Sarah picked up a biscuit, wishing they had butter to go with it, but she only saved for that on Steve’s birthday.
“I’m not going to win, Mom, there’s a one in a…I don’t know how many, but the odds aren’t good,” Steve said, though he regretted being so negative when he saw his mother’s shoulders fall a bit. Maybe he should just let her have this bit of hope, who was he to crush her dreams? “But…I mean, someone has to win, right? Why can’t it be us?”
Bucky looked away for a moment, rocking a little as he clenched his eyes shut, trying to calm himself down, though it wasn’t working. The more he tried to push things from his head, the more they latched on, screaming that there was no part of him that was his own any more, that nothing about him was real, it was all manufactured by scientists in a lab.
“Bucky, you have to tell us what’s going on, okay?” Tony got Bucky back on the couch, rubbing his back in circles. “Bucky, are you okay? It’s okay to admit that you’re scared.”
Bucky stopped kicking, crossing his arms across his chest and hugging himself tight before looking up at Steve. “I have to scan it before I eat it, my food gets tallied by calories, fat, and carbohydrates, and I have to do time on the exercise bike when I go over,” he said, looking up at Steve, his eyes focusing on the white box in his hands. It had been a very long time since he’d seen a box like that, but when he had, the bike riding had always been worth it. “…what’s in the box?”
“Sarah has a point, we should work together,” Natasha said after a few seconds of silence, feeling Bucky’s glare without looking over to confirm it. “We’re competitors, but we might need to help each other out. We can look after each other as a group.”
“Let go of him now!” Tony snapped, taking a step forward when Howard reached inside his coat pocket, pulling out a handgun and aiming it at his own son. “Are you serious? We both know you’re not going to shoot me.”
“Can you imagine eating like this every morning, though? What is it you’re eating, you’ve had an insane amount of it,” Natasha sat up in her chair a little, putting her plate to the side as she laughed at her friend.
“And I am your protector, and a very busy man,” Fury said, keeping his gaze unbroken. “Also, you like me.”
“What is it, Buck?” Steve asked, turning his head to face his boyfriend as he got to his feet.
“I’m sure he has his reasons for making us wait,” Natasha said as she looked at the books lining the walls, wondering if anyone ever read them. She felt like she’d never felt before wearing a fashionable black dress with short, curled hair. “Maybe this is just creating drama.”
“I did,” Bucky said affirmatively, nodding a little.
“Is it all the sex?” Tony took a sip of his beer, winking at Bucky, who burst into laughter.
“I’m not trying to hurt him, I’m trying to heal us both,” Steve replied to her, not backing down from his spot, even if it looked like he really should. “I want to make things better between us, so we don’t have this tension. We were best friends pretty much all our lives, we shouldn’t be like this now.”
“What, like you?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow in a moment of amusement as Pepper turned bright red and tried to look like she was concentrating on her notebook.
“…neutralize?” Steve asked, that word seeming a little out of place. “How dangerous is he?”
“…how you always put me in the middle,” Bucky said, a little smile on his lips as he looked down at his hand on his stomach, and the braided gold ring on his finger. “In bed, on the couch, out here, I’m always in the middle, and I know you say you both just like having me close but…I know it’s because you want to surround me with love. You’ve even taught the kids, they tell me they love me constantly, almost as much as you do and…and I want to thank you because I don’t know how I survived without love before.”
Washing his hands and ready to go back to bed, Bucky felt a strange pain in his back that took the wind out of him for a moment. Putting the lid down on the toilet, he sat down on it, putting his hand on his back and closing his eyes as he breathed slowly. It was probably a pinched nerve or something, but he couldn’t help but to worry about it. He didn’t need any more mystery pains, his body already felt like he’d switched places with an old person with how slow he was to get to his feet.
“I will sing for you on our wedding day, same thing I told Tony,” Bucky sat up, picking pieces of hay from his hair as he looked over at Steve, suddenly feeling more than a little evil. “Do you still think about fucking me?”
“I did it a lot thinking of both of you,” Bucky teased, breathing harder as he felt another digit slip inside him. “That felt better than anything, pretending you were inside of me.”
“I want to do that again…” Tony grinned in the darkness, feeling oddly shy, a character trait no one would usually ever associate with him. “Is there any way we can do that again?”
Tony hit the brakes hard, which only made them hit a pothole even harder, straining all of them against their seatbelts. Once they’d come to a rest, Bucky tore off his seatbelt, getting on the backseat on his hands and knees, not caring that he was half on Steve, just needing to get the pressure of his weight off of his back.
But more than anything, Tony was just scared this wasn’t going to work.
“N-no. No, I don’t want to wait,” Bucky said suddenly, shaking his head as he heard the shower stop in the bathroom. With a look of determination, he reached out to place his hands on Tony’s hips, slowly balling up the material in his hands and pulling the shorts down and off Tony, letting them fall to the ground. Unable to fight his curiosity, Bucky’s eyes wandered down to Tony’s cock, swallowing hard when he saw the length of it emerging from his dark hair.
He was going to have to do this, just as soon as he worked up the courage.
“You okay, Buck?” Tony asked as he broke his lips apart from Bucky’s only to start kissing and biting up his neck. “Everything going okay? You like the two of us spoiling you?”
“I weigh a lot,” Bucky said through tears, shaking his head, and leaning back against the seat.
“Yes, not that I want Gwen gone but…I really want to see him too,” Bucky said, watching as Steve took Gwen back into his arms, though the spot wasn’t empty for long before the smaller baby was placed beside him.
“Oh fuck yeah,” Bucky’s voice trembled, mouth parting in a circle as he clenched down on Steve’s fingers deep inside him. Every time Steve brushed against that one spot, it was like lightning going through his veins. It had been so long since someone other than himself had been inside him, he forgot how good it felt.
“Nope,” Tony picked up a piece of fried meat, taking a bite of it.
“Me? Where are you going?” Stane just knew this was going to fall to him, and he was none too happy about it.
His eyes meeting Sam’s, Steve knew that he meant what he was saying. If things got bad, if they had a chance, he was going to do his damndest to get Bucky out of his prison, and now with Sam, he had a much better chance at doing that.
“You’re as safe as any of us can guarantee,” Fury said as he got up in the cart with them, signaling for the driver to take them to the castle.
“Come in,” Steve said, sitting up a bit and setting down his phone, having spent the last hour reading a book on it after Bucky passed out against his chest. Before then, they’d been talking about all the places Steve was going to take him once he felt ready to be around people, though Steve was sure that they were a long ways off doing that yet.
“Eighth lower level,” Steve said after putting his pass in and scanning his eye and thumb, leaning on the wall as the elevator sunk, glad that he was alone on it, though he knew that would likely come up at some point. Holding the white box from the bakery in both hands, he sighed softly, worried that he was going to screw this up and make Bucky hate him. It would be a quick way for all this to get so much worse, and he didn’t think he could handle the stress of that. He didn’t know if that would bring his job to the same end as his predecessor, or if his own fate would be more gruesome.
“Not yet! Not…not yet…let her sleep, I’m okay,” Bucky moaned, clutching his stomach as he clenched his eyes closed, trying his best to breathe. “It started after four…”
“You’re right. Like if the questions is ‘what’s the stupidest thing I could do now?’,” Steve shot back, reaching out to grab the bottle. “I am not trying to tell you what to feel right now, Tony, but I am begging you to look for another way to deal with it because I do not want to lose you to drinking. You will break Bucky’s heart, you won’t be able to be there for the kids, and I don’t want to lose you either.”
Pushing open the heavy door of his study as he pocketed his keys, Stane turned the heavy locks to secure the door after him. Doing his usual check for any magical hearing devices around the room, he went to sit down at his desk to deal with the situation. First off, he poured himself a half glass of whiskey, taking a sip as he looked down on the desk at the wood case in the corner, his eyes running along the dark, unmarked surface.
Tony held his breath for a moment as Bucky leaned his head against him, pausing for a moment before his hand on his side, hugging him closer. Looking beside Bucky at Steve, he hoped the other man didn’t think he was trying anything, he just wanted to comfort Bucky, and he was pretty sure that’s what Bucky was asking for.
“I bet they don’t eat many pies,” Sarah added to the conversation, going over the most expensive foods she knew of in her head. “I have no idea. Maybe some sort of bird, like a swan?”
“Alright. Well, the biggest baby is a girl, and…” Dr. Marner paused, trying to be a little dramatic for them. “And the other is a boy. Congratulations, who had one of each?”
“I’m guessing you don’t like on a tiny bit more than the other…” Rhodey could see the conflict in Tony’s expression, he knew this wasn’t some shallow decision for him. He was taking this choice very seriously, and Rhodey had to say he was proud of him for it.
“No,” Bucky corrected him, shaking his head before taking Steve by the hand, lacing their fingers together. “I never wished that I didn’t do it.”
“What needs changing?” Stane asked protectively.
“But this really could mean something good for everyone if you influenced his policies, if you-‘
“That was five hours ago! Why didn’t you get us?” Tony asked, frowning as he knelt next to Bucky, putting a hand on his back. “We would have sat up with you, you didn’t have to be alone. You’re not doing any part of this alone, baby.”
“Sire…I mean, Tony….” Bucky was starting to worry, Stane was taking a while, what if they’d arrested Natasha. “About my friend who’s coming to live with me at the castle. She…out of desperation, she’s stolen a bit, and-“
“Excellent. Good. I just sent her a text,” Tony said, taking a seat on the couch again, setting his phone on the table beside him. “I’m sorry, it’s just been a very intense day so far, I just need to do something nice.”
“Okay, considering how long it takes for me to get dressed up and slap a crown on my head, do you really want me to go do that?” asked Tony, giving Pepper a warm smile and cocking his head, trying his best to look cute. “I can just go there like this, and we can get this started that much sooner. I mean, do we really need me to be dressed up for this?”
“I don’t want to lie to them, I don’t think I could keep up a lie that big,” Bucky said, wincing a little from the pain in his shoulder, hoping that he hadn’t made things worse for himself. “If you want me to say someone else did that to me, we can…”
“We have to leave now. I’ll explain in the car,” Tony said, stepping into the room, a gym bag in his hand, opening a safe and filling the bag with its contents. “We don’t have time to bring anything. Follow me! Go go go!”
“I’m sure he’ll be very happy to use his powers to delight the poor,” Stane hoped he wasn’t going to be the one to go up into his tower to propose all of this to their court wizard.
“You’d like him, you really would,” Steve said, sadness in his voice as the corner of his mouth curled up in a smile, unaware of the tears in his eyes. “He’s so special, Sam, and not because what his body can do, but for who he is despite all of this. How he can smile still is beyond me, but then I see his face and hear his voice, and…holy shit, he just gets me every single time.” Sniffing, he reached for his napkin with a shaking hand, picking it up to dry his eyes. He hadn’t cried about this, he was always the one trying to stay strong for Bucky. It never occurred to him that he needed someone to stay strong for him.
“Is that good or bad?” Tony asked as he lit up the lanterns on his desk, setting the last one down as he went back over to take Bucky by the arm, taking him to a bookcase full of what looked to Bucky like mostly toys. “These are most of my creations.”
“I think we killed him,” Tony laughed as he slowly withdrew from Steve’s body, helping him to flop to the side so he could recover. He wasn’t done yet, though, and neither was Bucky, and staring at Bucky’s ass presented in the air, he knew exactly what he wanted. “Bucky, you good to keep going?”
Bucky looked up into Steve’s eyes, not speaking for a second as a smile spread across his face. Leaning up towards Steve, Bucky pressed his lips against the other man’s in a cautious, soft kiss, letting it linger for a few seconds before it broke. “I’m glad you’re here too…” he whispered against Steve’s lips, his cheeks flushed as his heart thundered in his chest. “I don’t know if you wanted me to do that, b-“
“Father said he’s installed a perimeter around the mansion, I won’t be able to leave there like I can’t leave here,” Bucky said softly, looking utterly defeated as he hugged himself tightly. “…if I did get out, I…I’m legally dead, I can have children and if I do get pregnant, there’s nowhere for me to go for help because no one knows what they did to me. No matter what I do, I have to hide away from the world for the rest of my life.”
“That’s just how I want to be,” Bucky breathed, looking up at Tony as he positioned himself in front of him. Licking his lips, he pressed a delicate kiss to the tip of Tony’s cock as he looked up at him with wide, innocent eyes.
“Yeah, I’m a thief. So is Natasha. I didn’t have much choice.”
“He can’t leave that room, he’s got a chip in him, it’ll electrocute him. And even if I could, I don’t know where I could run that would be safe for both of us,” Steve said, defeat in his voice as he stared down at his meal, picking up a piece of potato and taking a bite, not wanting to look suspicious by not eating. “I love him, Sam, I’m not leaving him, I’m not going to abandon him to a life of slavery, having kids and maybe never even getting to see them or raise them. His existence can’t be just breeding with Tony Stark, I have to be there for when he needs me.”
Steve wasn’t sure what he’d expected from all of this build up to come to this strange room. There were a few chairs along a desk facing a glass wall with a control panel on it, the rest of the room mostly empty aside from some medical equipment, a comfortable looking couch, and a desk with a monitor on it. The glass wall itself was quite long, about twenty feet or so, with a single door in the middle, and on the other side was another white room, brightly lit as well. There were a few pieces of exercise equipment on the far right, an exercise bike bolted to the floor, a yoga ball, and a couple small hand weights. On the left was a bathroom, a toilet, sink, and a clear shower stall, with a few bright red towels hanging from the walls. The middle was the largest section of room with a metal bed bolted down in the corner along with some bookshelves and a dresser. In the far corner from the bed was a television, a few consoles, and a case full of dozens of games. Sitting in front of it was a teenage boy with long brown hair pulled back into a ponytail, wearing a thick black hoodie and shorts, a black controller in his hands as he mindlessly continued with his game despite the people staring at him. It was something he was painfully used to.
“We’re getting married,” Bucky echoed, unable to wipe the smile off his face.
Tony didn’t say anything as Howard led him through the house, trying to make himself take long, deep breaths to keep himself from losing what little control he had left. He wanted to cry, his father, the only parent he had left, had done something so reprehensible that he had no idea what his next step was going to be. He didn’t even know what they would begin to charge him with, or if Howard’s lawyers would let him slip away. The only thing he could think was that he had to see Bucky, he had to make sure he was okay, and then he had to figure out how to right what Howard did to him. Walking into Howard’s home office, Tony didn’t compliment his father on a trap door well hidden as his desk moved to the side to reveal a stairway.
“He won’t leave us, he can’t…” Steve said, struggling to keep eye contact with his husband as he felt the tears dripping off the bottom of his jaw.
“Tony, I pledge my life to you, I…” Steve had a speech planned in his head, but it was all gone now, not even leaving scraps behind to go off of. Slipping the ring on Tony’s finger, he decided to just wing it. “Tony, I know a lottery brought us together, but that’s not what keeps us together. In the short time I’ve known you, you’ve been thoughtful, kind, and I love spending time with you. What I love even more is how you treat Bucky too, my heart sings every time I see him smile because of you. I don’t want to be with just him, I want to be with both of you. I love you both, Tony and Bucky, I always will.”
“You must have come pretty fast,” Tony’s brow knit for a moment as he tried to think of how far away Latveria was on a map. It was at least a two week ride.
“Steve, you know I mean it when I say I pledge my life to you,” Bucky begged his trembling fingers not to drop the ring, mentally cheering when he managed to get it on Steve’s finger. “I gave an arm for you when you were ill, and it was the best decision I ever made in my life. I don’t know what I’d do if you weren’t here, I wouldn’t be strong enough to make this journey without you. Tony and I are great together, but we need you too. You make me feel so safe, Steve, you…you make me feel more important than a king. You both do. I love you so much, I don’t want to lose you for anything.”
“I’ll do my best…” he promised softly, looking at his mother, and forcing a smile. “I want this life for us, Mom. It’s just hard for me to not want it for him too.”
“You be the King you want to be now, you start today,” Pepper set down her notebook on the floor, taking both of his hands in hers. “I’ll help you with anything, okay? We can figure out what’s been going on and fix the economy of the Kingdom.”
“A trim, I think,” Bucky said, though he immediately second guessed himself and looked over at Pepper. “What does the King like? I mean, I’m supposed to be impressing him, what if he hates long hair and beards?”
“Hey…” Tony said, stepping into the room and walking over to the bed, sitting on the edge of it. “How’s Bucky doing? Did you take him in the sun room when I was gone?”
“Are you sure about that?” Von Doom asked, raising an eyebrow as he looked back up at Tony standing at the pulpit.
“Or it could have slowed right down, you wouldn’t have wanted that,” Tony said, stroking Bucky’s hair, his hand pausing as it moved over his ponytail. “When you’re feeling ready to talk to someone else, I promise you I’m going to get you the best help, but for now I want you to know you always have me. I’m here for you.”
“You must be Steve Rogers,” Howard said as he stepped into Bucky’s room, a friendly smile on his face as he extended his hand.“Yes, sir, I…” Steve stood up in a hurry to shake the CEO’s hand, too shocked to wonder why he was there. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Stark.”
By the time Tony got home, it was after midnight, and he was both exhausted mentally and physically. Dropping his keys on the table and his jacket on the floor behind him, he headed for one of the many bars around the house, this one being in a room a few doors down that Howard had used for entertaining. Pouring himself a neat scotch, he downed it in one gulp before making another, praying that the alcohol would burn away the headache behind his eyes that had been nagging him since this morning. After another full day of pouring over records, he couldn’t find any trace of Bucky anywhere in Stark Industries files. He had wanted to bring Steve with him so he could open the elevator to the place where Bucky had been kept, but he wasn’t about to take the man away from Bucky right now. He’d get in, he knew where it was, it was just a matter of time until he could bring the police in for more evidence against his father.
“I have people trying to escape me, it’s not much fun,” Bucky said as he wrapped both arms around his bucket, putting his face inside of it and moaning softly. “I read so many books, I didn’t think it would feel like this, I didn’t think anything could hurt this bad.”
“No, Tony, you need to listen. Bucky’s pr-“ Steve began, looking down at a pale and nervous Bucky when he realized what a big step they’d just forced him to take. “Bucky, we didn’t have a choice, we had to leave like that…” He doubted anything he said was going to make this situation any better, he felt helpless. “Tony, he can’t go on a plane with him like this. He’d draw too much attention.”
“We have lots of time, don’t worry,” Steve reassured Bucky, rubbing his good shoulder to ease some of the tension in it. “Even if they don’t have names for a bit after they’re born, they’re babies, they won’t know the difference.”
Before Bucky could get too emotional, Tony’s mouth found his, moaning hungrily as their tongues met. Bucky felt like his legs were going to give out as the kiss deepened, his knees trembling as Steve came up from behind him to nip a line down his neck and across his collarbone. Sandwiched between the two men paying him a lot of attention, Bucky reached back with his hand to cup Steve’s head as his tongue danced against Tony’s.
“You haven’t been, Bucky. And this isn’t something small,” Steve said, about to scoop Bucky up in his arms and head up to their shared bedroom when Tony appeared in the doorway looking spooked, wide eyed and pale. “Tony?”
“Tony, we’re Bucky’s home. He was happy in the mansion too, right?” Steve pointed out, sure that Bucky would agree with him on this. “He wants you to be happy, and the only reason I’m not including him in this talk right now is because his blood pressure was a bit up today.”
“I’m always going to need you, don’t talk like I won’t,” Bucky replied, rolling onto his side, leaning his back against Tony’s chest as he reached for Steve. “Can we just…can we just be close like this tonight?”
“It’s for you,” Tony said proudly, having put it together himself over the past few days since their first meal together. He realized immediately what the problem might be, that Bucky couldn’t both hold and crank it. “Here, I’ll hold it, you turn the little crank there.”
Tony closed his eyes, reaching over to his Uncle, his fingers brushing the top of the bowl before he sunk his hand into the mess of tiny paper scraps. There were so many, and they were so delicate, they slipped through his fingers as he tried to grab just one. Drawing his hand back a moment to regroup and try again, he felt something stuck to the side of his index finger. Touching it with his thumb, he realized it was a single piece of paper. Grasping it, he opened his eyes as he drew his hand back, peeling the number off his finger as he looked down at it.
Nor did he see the smile on his face.
“So that’s why you did the lottery? Because you wanted to marry a peasant?” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow, shocked to hear all of this. This wasn’t what his view of Tony was at all, but he had to say he liked what he was hearing.
“At least that much,” Natasha scoffed, eyeing the coffee again. She was pretty sure that she and Bucky had drunk most of it, the two were practically vibrating in their seats, but she still wished they had more. “Bucky, we get to live like this. Well, hopefully you can convince the King to sell some of this stuff for a better cause, but you know what I mean.”
“We are, but this isn’t done yet,” smiled Tony, having a quick word with the priest before picking up one of the crowns. “My husbands, Steven and James, kneel before me.”
“Now, the rings. Anthony, if you would remove yours and pass it to Steven,” the priest directed, waiting for them to do so. “Now, Steven, place the ring on Anthony’s left ring finger an-“
“Seriously? I’m marrying…” Bucky closed his eyes, shaking his head as he couldn’t believe his luck in that moment. He’d resigned himself to being alone forever, but here he was with two soon to be husbands, and he didn’t think his heart could feel any fuller.
“So it’s settled then, we’re getting married,” Tony purred, utterly thrilled, and already very, very impatient for the big day. He didn’t think he’d ever await his wedding day, especially this much, but he didn’t think he’d ever find a Steve and a Bucky either. He couldn’t believe how fast he went from doubting love to accepting it with open arms. This was like magic; only something bigger than what Strange was capable of.
“No, it’s not, it’s not fucking good! My father got away with it!” Tony yelled as he drove through a red light, trying to force himself to calm down before he killed them, or someone else. “Fucking lawyers and bribes and I don’t fucking know, but he’s out. He’s out and he’s going to come for Bucky, because Bucky can go to the press, he’s the only proof that exists and my father will wipe him out. We have to get away. Far away.”
“If you’re sure,” Tony took off his shirt, switching it with the new one, and taking both soiled shirts to the wood stove. Looking over at Bucky leaning against Steve, the young man’s eyes still red with tears, Tony took a deep breath and pursed his lips. “…I’m going to get a therapist, I’m going to talk to someone about my father. And I think Bucky could use one too.”
“There you are, I was wondering if you’d gotten lost or something,” Tony said as he looked over, watching as his friend walked closer. Moving over on the ornate bench, he cleared space for Rhodey to sit as his side. “Did anyone see you come?”
~~~~~~~~~~~
“I didn’t know you sang,” Steve whispered to Bucky as Tony took their glasses off them to refill again.
“We’re well rested and fed, I assure you,” Von Doom said with a smile, though there was no joy in his eyes. “We were travelling for your wedding, actually. It’s a shame to hear what happened to your fiancés, though I’m glad that Latveria can be by your side in this terrible time.”
“Bucky? Buck?” Steve called out, walking down the hall, poking his head in each room to call out his boyfriend’s name. He hadn’t seen him since breakfast, where he’d barely eaten anything, and since then neither Steve, Tony, nor any of the staff had seen him, and he wasn’t answering his texts. “Jesus, Bucky…”
“You shouldn’t. I’m sure she’d rather you remember her for more than how old she was,” Tony put a hand on Bucky’s back to comfort him. “I lost my parents when I was young, too. But it’s not really the same, I still had a home, people around me. Don’t think I’m trying to compare us.”
“Stane, you better have good news for me,” the man said gruffly, staring intensely up at Stane. “I’m sick of you telling me every day that you don’t know what’s going on.”
King Von Doom arrives according to his and Stane's plans, and Stane is let in on a secret.
“Because I’m terrible at making food,” Steve joked, though he could tell from his mother’s expression that she wasn’t amused. “Being a soldier meant I could make more money for us, and I want to help people. This is the best way to do it.”
“I can do all of that with you here,” Steve gave her a tight squeeze, wishing he could fix what his mother struggled to hold together. “I can do it even better with you here because you can be in your grandchildren’s lives. You’re not stopping me from doing anything, Mom.”
“I’ve spent too much time down there already,” Tony remarked, flopping down in a chair with a newly poured tumbler of whiskey. “It’s time I start regulating my time between being a King and being an inventor.”
“We…we give them both a chance,” Tony smiled, opening his arms wide as he looked at the two confused looking men. “I’m going to date you both, and then I’ll make my decision. I’ll make the announcement right before the wedding and walk one of you down the aisle.”
“We’ll have to set them up then,” Bucky grinned, playing with a piece of hay, wishing he could braid it like Natasha. “I mean, what else do two kings have to do? We might as well get some kids in love together.”
Looking up and turning around, Steve’s jaw hit the floor as he saw Tony standing in the doorway, almost stumbling over his own feet as he rushed to pull him into his arms. Holding each other close, both men finally felt some relief at being reunited.
“I’m proud of that fact,” Pepper smiled a little, the compliment warming her heart. Here he was so upset and grief stricken, and he still cared about her. “Sire-“
“What did they tell you would be happening today? You must need new clothes, you can’t go around in a dressing gown,” Sarah couldn’t help the excited little laugh that left her lips. “My son has a dressing gown!”
“Maybe, I don’t know. Probably, you’re such a genius,” Bucky laughed again, wiping his eyes as he looked at Tony, pressing a soft kiss to his lips. “Oh my god, I have two arms again. This it…sorry you didn’t get a present, Steve.”
“And yet here we are,” Tony ate one last grape before turning back to his coffee. “It doesn’t matter if they’re rich or poor, I’m bringing a stranger into the house either way. You may have researched these people you suggest, but they can hide intentions just as much as anyone else. Probably moreso. I don’t care if this impoverished person’s agenda is to just stay with me to be rich and live in luxury. I can handle not being loved for the right reasons.”
“It’s just nice to feel so clean, and well rested, and…” Steve only wished he felt more at home here. It was comfortable, but it would take him more than one evening to feel truly settled. “It’s hard to think of this as home though.”
“I don’t know. I just…sometimes I think it’s convenient for them that I do like men,” admitted Bucky as he squeezed Tony’s hand in his own, chewing on his lip as he tried to think this all over. “But Steve said to me that if it’s what I really feel now, then that’s what’s going to be real for me. I don’t want to be with a girl, I don’t want to be with anyone but you and Steve, and I want that with all my heart so how could it be anything less than real?”
Standing up off the bed, Bucky walked over to Steve, who stood almost a head taller than him, looking up into his eyes before his gaze turned to the box. Looking them over for a moment, he carefully began to reach for the lemon vanilla, his eyes moving back up to Steve to gauge his reaction to Bucky’s selection, waiting for one emotion specifically. When Steve didn’t look angry or say anything, Bucky carefully took it from the box in Steve’s hands and brought it over to a clear box on the table. Placing it inside, he hit a button, his head tilting to the side a little as .
“…if Tony’s doing it, I should do it too,” Bucky said, not sounding as sure of himself as he meant to, swallowing hard the more he thought about it. “I mean…could you go with me?”
“Honestly, I can’t say I know much about Canadian geography, I’ve never been there, but…” Steve pulled out his phone, glad that he’d remembered to charge it overnight, and looked up their new home on a map, his eyebrows raising. “That…is north.”
Ronin was relieved when his target finally went to sleep, convinced he was going to have to stand back and watch the man pleasure himself.  It wasn’t that he had a problem with masturbation; he had a healthy relationship with the act. But that didn’t mean he wanted to see some guy do it in front of him. He had an easier time with blood than he did with other people’s come.
“I’m lying in hay on wood, how comfortable do you think I am?”
“…you know what?” Tony said after a moment, closing the book and handing it back over to Pepper. “Good detective work, Pepper, but both of these people got their tickets fair and square. It’s not right to deny one just because the ticket seller made a mistake. I’m not going to punish them because he can’t write on a line right.”
“Bucky, that’s…no. You’re not a baby machine, you’re a person,” Steve said sternly, not wanting to argue with him, but wishing he’d see sense that Tony and he loved him for more than his ability to carry kids. Sometimes he worried that Bucky didn’t completely believe them, it was something he and Tony were going to have to keep working on.
“It’s not even that…it’s not about going outside,” Bucky interrupted, bringing a hand up to rub his eyes. “As nice as it would be to go outside, I mostly want…I want my feelings to be my own, I want to know if I like someone because I truly do, or because they fucked me up so much.”
“They won’t be a stranger by that point, I’ll have gotten to know them,” Tony smiled, amused by how bothered his uncle was by all this. He loved the man, he was like a father to Tony, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t fun to mess with. “I can court someone in a month, I’m sure people have done so in less time.”
“He’s right, we were going to get under the blankets, it would have been adorable,” Tony said, giving Steve a smile of his own, shrugging innocently and shaking his head. “How about you go back in the bathroom and come out once we’re all set up?”
“I’m glad you’ll be there, but I don’t want to wreck your life either. Is this pineapple?” Bucky asked after a mouthful, looking into the smoothie, trying to look for anything that would distract him from his train of thought.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Only if you take yours off too,” Bucky grinned, biting his bottom lip as Steve took a hold of the dark underwear, pulling them down his legs and off in one motion. “That’s me, what about you? And you, Tony, I shouldn’t be the only naked one here.”
“I always wanted to learn the guitar before, but…” Bucky laughed weakly, patting the stump where his arm had been. “I wouldn’t mind my goats, if that’s no problem. Is there a place I can keep them?”
“If they’re still here,” Natasha snorted, shaking her head at the incompetence around her. Not that she minded playing bodyguard to Bucky; she was the only person she trusted to keep him safe. For extremely obvious reasons.
“I know you’re bringing a stranger in here and making my life difficult,” grumbled Fury, staring Tony down with every ounce of frustration he was feeling. “I know you want a party to start this all off with.”
“It’s at the front door, Tony,” Steve said as he grabbed the blanket off the couch to wrap around Bucky, waiting until his contraction was over before trying to move him. “Just wear those boots, you can step into them. You look cold, you’re shaking all over. Do you need another blanket?”
“Where would the baby sleep?” Bucky asked suddenly, taking both Steve and Tony by surprise. Realizing he had both of their eyes on him, staring in surprise, he felt like he should continue. “…you can’t test who the birth father is, not unless there’s a medical reason…I want the baby, and me, to have the last name Stark-Rogers, and I get that you can’t marry me because I’m technically dead, but…”
“Oh, you must be Mr. Rogers,” the nurse said, waiting as Bucky removed his heavy hoodie, leaving him in a tank top, to get his blood pressure read.
“Don’t worry about it. The police are going to have to talk to you, though, but I’m going to have my lawyer with you so you’re not alone. You’re not in trouble though, neither am I, all the evidence is pointing to them attacking you and us defending ourselves,” Tony reassured him, feeling confident enough about that after the last few hours he spent at the Whitehorse division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. “I’m just concerned about you, I want to take you home and hold you.”
“Sounds like a plan,” Bucky said, excited about going to the great kingdom of Wakanda with both his husbands and the rest of his family. Less excited about his gift to the other two, really doubting himself at the moment. “Okay, about these presents-“
“…could you make that Corvette a vintage Indian motorcycle?” Steve asked, the corner of his mouth tugging up a little in a nervous smile.
“I do, good sir, with a full heart and a clear head,” Tony said as he looked between Bucky and Steve, his face aching from smiling so much.
A visitor comes in the night, and some plans need to be made.
“You should,” Tony said, reaching out to put his hand on her s to make her stop writing. “You have my word.”
“Coach me?” Bucky raised an eyebrow, fiddling with the empty arm of his robe.
“We have to go through the roof and we have to do it now,” Steve said urgently, crawling across the floor as quietly and quickly as he could manage, pressing his hands against the inside of the roof, looking desperately for a weak spot in the thatch roof. “Bucky, start looking for a spot we can go through.”
“Shut up, shut up, shut up…” Tony didn’t know what to do, he felt like his heart was being squeezed in his chest. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing, he couldn’t believe what his father was admitting to. “You stole a child, mutilated him, and locked him up…for me? And you didn’t think that I would have a fucking problem with it?”
“You are fucking stunning, don’t you ever think differently,” Tony replied as Bucky wrestled his shirt away, going for the button of his jeans next, his own hands busy dropping Bucky’s pants to the floor, leaving him in his boxers. He gave the younger man a moment to catch up, stepping out of his jeans as they hit the floor and kicking them aside, standing in his own shorts. “We don’t have to go farther than this if you don’t want to.”
“No.”
“I mean, look what else they did to me,” Bucky shrugged a little, looking down at Tony’s mug again, not sure as to why they were talking about this stuff again. He was tired of talking about all of that, he just wanted to move on and concentrate on living his life now.
“That sounds fine, you’re the goat expert,” Natasha reached over to get a log, adding it to the fire before she turned back to Bucky. “Maybe we should wait, have a big meal the night of the lottery drawing.”
“Tony, hello,” Steve said as casually as he could manage when he opened the door and came face to face with the King. He knew the man was coming, but that didn’t mean he was prepared in any way. He’d spent most of the day pacing nervously.
“Are you sure taking that job was a good idea? I mean, the motorcycle is really, really cool, and the raise is nice, but if you’re not happy, it’s not worth it,” Peggy shook her head, genuinely concerned for her husband.
“…I can’t imagine wanting something more than this…” Bucky said in awe, finally letting the tips of his fingers touch the glass, surprised at how warm it was. “Except to go out and touch it, that would be…can I have some grass? In books they talk about the smell of grass, but I can’t even begin to picture it.”
“Sire…”
“I’m so bad at naming things, I think I should be out of the running,” Steve said with a little laugh. “We had two alley cats outside of our place and I named them Mr. Tabby and Mrs. Black, and then it turns out I got it backwards and Mr. Tabby had Mrs. Black’s kittens.”
“There’s no rush, Steve, I have to head to D.C. tomorrow for a week, and if you don’t find a place in that time, then that’s fine too, we have a spare room for a reason,”  Peggy said, looking at him sadly as she reached out to rub his shoulder, giving it an affectionate squeeze. “I love you too, Steve, and I hope we’ll be friends after this because I would miss you so much if you weren’t in my life.”
“Very fair, sire,” Pepper said, looking at the two men, realizing she had some organizing to do if they were both coming to the castle. “How many rooms do I need to have waiting?”
“Steve, I’ve met someone,” Peggy said, seeing that Steve was faltering, figuring she could make it a lot easier for both of them by being direct. “I haven’t done anything with him, nothing like that, I would never cheat on you, but I like him. A lot. When I’m with you, I feel like I’m with one of my friends, but when I’m with Raj, I feel…I feel like I want to be with him.”
“Honestly? Kind of. I thought there was no way that he could hide something like this from you, I thought you had to know what was going on,” Steve said as he looked at Tony, frowning. “I assumed that your relationship with you dad was like me and my mother, because she was terrible at keeping secrets from me. I knew my Christmas presents pretty much the night she bought them, she’d drop these horrible hints and I’d know what I was getting right away. I know now that I shouldn’t have done that, especially considering all the security I had to go through to get to Bucky’s room. If you’d have known, he’d have just been kept here.”
“Is the mysterious answer to this riddle trans men? I am aware of the existence of men with uteruses,” Tony took a sip of coffee, a strange feeling of dread coming over him looking at Howard’s expression. He was pleased with himself about something. “Look, Dad, I’m not looking to get set up with anyone. I’m sure he’s very nice, but I’m not into dating right now, and that really wouldn’t be fair to him. It’s nice he volunteered but…”
“I won’t doubt you. You think I’m not scared? I’m terrified, and I’m not the one doing all the work,” Tony said, pulling Bucky closer gently, not wanting to twist him up somehow and have the next contraction really hurt him. “I don’t feel qualified for this. At all. And I’m thirty three, I’m running a company right now, but I’m still scared about being a father.”
“Night, Bucky,” Nathasha yelled back from her room where she was too busy reading by candlelight to lie down for the evening. “Don’t make me police you to keep fiancés from sneaking in there.”
“It’s going good, we’re meeting through a mediator to dissolve everything and there’s no hard feelings so it’s been pretty easy so far. At least I know it won’t cost me an arm and a leg,” Steve said with a smile, turning his head to place his order with the waitress before looking back to Sam once she left. “Everything’s going as well as I could ask, and she’s seeing someone now, so she’s happy. That’s what I want most out of this, I’ll always love her, and she deserves to be with a guy that puts a smile on her face.”
“I’m so glad you like it,” grinned Steve, happily carrying his work of art over to Tony, passing it up to him on the chair and watching as he hung it up. “Little to the left, little…perfect. Right there.”
“I’ll take an afternoon at home with just me and Benjamin, we can lie in bed and sleep,” Bucky said, not sorry to be left out of this particular family trip. “Don’t wreck the van trying to be cool.”
“Did you get the goats in?” Namor asked right after, not moving in his chair after an exhausting day fishing.
“Mention it to Pepper tomorrow, she can send the right letter to the right place,” Steve looked over at the other two, starting to get nervous about his present. He’d spent weeks on it, but it still didn’t seem like enough, especially after finding out what Tony’s was.
“I like it,” Bucky said, smiling up at him as he reached out to wrap his arms around Tony’s neck. “I don’t know what I’m going to call you both. Give me some time to think about it.”
“Oh? Under which circumstances?” Steve laughed, grinning more when he heard Bucky chuckling himself.
“Thanks…” the young soldier, a man barely twenty one named Steve, said as he took the hot tea from his mother and watched her hang up his uniform to dry. “Sorry I was late, Sam and I were helping a woman with her shopping.”
“I just…I feel like that name’s bullshit,” Tony began to pace, looking over at Clint as he realized how close he was to losing one of the men he loved. He wasn’t very impressed with that. “I…I suppose you can live if you keep helping us.”
“Sire, PLEASE…”
“I want to go home,” Bucky whimpered, holding his stomach and breathing slowly. He’d only been to town once since they moved to Dawson City, and he’d hid in the car the whole time. “I just want to be with you two, I don’t want to do this with anyone else. I just want to go home with you.”
“I haven’t heard you complain about the plan,” Von Doom said crisply, raising an eyebrow. “You’re not backing out of our agreement, are you?”
“I think I’m going to like living here more than at the mansion, I like that we’ll all be closer together here,” Bucky said, lying back down to look up, eager to see a properly starry sky. The view at the mansion had been a disappointment, but if Tony said there were lots of stars and lights here, he was going to love it.
“Fabulous,” Tony said sarcastically, hitting the button before going to open the door, standing outside of it. “Okay, you’re free, I suggest you get the fuck away from my father. I’ll set you up with what you want and you can live anywhere in the world, just not in my basement. Come on, get moving, this isn’t happening now or at any point in time.”
“How much does it hurt him? Is that really necessary?” Steve asked, looking back at Bucky, feeling terrible for him. Even if he was special, he needed friends, and he didn’t know if just him was going to be enough.
“Bucky and Tony, I love you. And it’s settled then, we’re going to stay here together, forever,” Steve said, getting a blanket to pull over the three of them, wrapping his arm over Bucky too. Looking over him to Tony, he smiled widely as their eyes met in the light of fire place, their fingers touching as they splayed out their hands on Bucky’s back.
“What’s going on out here? Can Eddie play with them or are they going to bury him or something?” Tony asked, carrying a very squirmy toddler who wanted to go play with his siblings and the dog.
“So…do you have big families?” Tony asked next, not entirely sure how to make conversation with these people. This was very different than in court.
“Driving down that road is punishment enough,” Steve said with a laugh, glad to see Tony smiling after how upset he’d been this morning. “Okay, I think we’re having two boys.”
“Steve is pretty smart…” Bucky frowned, not looking quite so confident.
“Hang on…” Bucky closed his eyes, kicking harder, his legs aching so much he could cry, but he wasn’t about to stop.
“You’re going to kidnap the consort of the King and think that you can get away with it?” Bucky said incredulously, shocked by the plan, or lack thereof.
“Fuck…” Bucky slumped back to the floor, closing his eyes. “I’m fucked.”
“The wine’s not going to do that, let me get you a whiskey,” Pepper hurried over to the refreshment area of the King’s personal tent, pouring him a glass with a couple shots in it. Bringing it back over, she handed Tony the glass before straightening his crown. “You’re going to do fine.”
“Then why are you alone? I thought you weren’t courting anyone because…” Sarah trailed off, not quite sure how to end that sentence.
“Our court artist, Janet Van Dyne, and now you,” Tony grinned, excited for Steve and Janet to meet. “She’s wonderful, you’ll like her a lot, but she says she’s happy to share her space and supplies with a fellow artist.”
“I can talk, if you want,” Clint offered with a shrug, looking between Natasha and Bucky. “I mean, I have nothing against you, buddy. I was hired for this job, and to kill the other fiancé. I don’t know his name. I’ll cooperate however you want.”
“I still hope I don’t suck,” Bucky replied, blushing as he tried to calm himself down, wondering how Steve felt about all this. He supposed they would find out as soon as they found him. “Do you really think Steve will be into this?”
“I don’t know, it looks like they went all out for this, why go cheap at the end of the night?” Bucky shrugged, wondering if he should get them each another beer, and maybe try to grab some more cake. “Just in case, we should pig out now.”
“So you don’t want to lose, but you want Bucky to win?” Tony repeated to see if he had that right, crossing his arms over his chest. “What do you want, Bucky?”
“But we can do it!” Gwen protested as she climbed down with a pout, going down the slide and walking over to them to plead her case.
Steve straightened the strap of his messenger bag, following Ms. Carr through the doorway and into the hall they were in yesterday, though today they’d gone to the right instead, towards an elevator.
“…I know you and Steve would say that, but it’s not as easy to convince me it’s true,” Bucky grunted, taking another small piece and putting it with the first. “Just let me do this and I promise you I’ll stop apologizing to you.”
Bucky looked up at Tony again, swirling his tongue around him, sucking hungrily as he tried his best to push the man close to the edge, though not quite over it. He wanted tonight to last longer than that. Having Steve fucking him again just made him want more, it awoke the thirst inside him he’d ignored for so long. He didn’t know how he lasted years without having another man touch him, but now he knew he was quickly going to get used to having two. Squeezing down around Steve, he pushed back so he was flush against him, needing to feel him buried deep.
“Then…good luck with that,” Stane smirked as he raised his glass to his nephew, tossing back the alcohol as he laughed inside his head.
“Why Canada?” Steve raised his eyebrow a little, looking at Tony in the rearview mirror.
“Oh wow, uhm…” Steve cleared his throat, feeling horribly put on the spot. “A girlfriend in high school, then I met someone else in college before I met my wife, and…that’s it. May I ask why it’s relevant?”
So when Bucky leaned his head on Steve’s shoulder, wrapping both arms around his waist, Steve felt like his heart was going to break inside him. Pulling Bucky into a hug with both arms, Steve held him tightly, leaning his own head against Bucky’s to be that much closer to him. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath, breathing in Bucky’s shampoo and body wash, realizing how much he didn’t want to let Bucky go right now, or ever again.
“…I don’t know….” Bucky said, going back to sit on his bed as he ate his cupcake slowly, enjoying it as he broke off pieces and put them in his mouth. It was the most delicious thing he’d eaten in a while, or since he’d had Jack to look after him. It wasn’t that he wasn’t being fed, but no one else knew what he liked, or where to get it, and he hadn’t felt comfortable making demands about what he wanted. The closer they were getting to his birthday, the more tense he felt, and that wasn’t exactly helping his appetite either.
“You’re neither of those things, especially not broken,” Steve corrected him, lacing their fingers together and bringing Bucky’s hand up to his lips to press a kiss against it. “Nothing about you needs to be fixed, Bucky.”
“It’s not what I’m going to do, asshole,” Bucky grinned, still in a fighting stance, and ready to play dirty.
“I want it to be like marrying Steve and Bucky even though they’re dead,” Tony clarified, looking at Stane as if he was challenging him to change his plans. “I loved them, I want them to be as loved in life as they were in death. I want them to be buried as Kings.”
“I think the healthiest thing we could do right now is stop looking for who to blame and look for ways to move on,” Steve said as he watched  Bucky open his mouth to argue only to close it again. “Bucky, we’re going to be staying in Dawson City, both because Tony needs to stay put until the police clear him and because we thought it’s where you want to be, is that okay?” He smiled a bit when Bucky nodded, though he could still see worry in his eyes.
“Entirely too much of the buildings around the castle are made with straw,” Strange said in a way that encouraged Tony to just drop the matter. “I can make light without heat.”
“Peter Joseph came in at four pounds and three ounces, so he’s a lot smaller than his sister, and a lot quieter,” Tony said, watching Bucky pull the baby closer. “Gwen and Peter are here, baby, what do you think about that?”
“I’m sure I can,” Tony’s smile slowly faded from his face as he wilted in the chair, leaning his head back to look up at the ceiling. Steve and Tony felt so far away, he just wanted to reach out and touch them. But that wouldn’t be for a few days now. “Just no harm in being prepared.”
“Why don’t we just see how they get along themselves?” queried Bucky, taking a drink and licking his lips, loving this whiskey business. “I mean, you and I got together without any help.”
“Bucky’s going to need me if you’re bringing him there, you can’t try to sneak him away from me,” Steve said, his voice clipped as he tried to keep his anger from seeping into it. “He’s terrified of this whole transition, and it would only scare him more to do it alone.”
“No, I sat down and crossed my arms, sorry,” Tony said meekly, not moving as Pepper fussed over him. He liked Pepper a lot, enough that their dynamic wasn’t nearly what it should be for a King and his assistant. He never felt the need to pull rank on her, especially when she was just looking out for him.
“I think that was part of Father’s success, to be honest, it’s why I want to do it,” Tony pushed his plate away, taking a long sip of coffee. “I think this could change a lot.”
“So this is about your choice...” Steve murmured, looking over at Bucky, and then back to Tony as his heart ached in his chest. He wanted to give this to Bucky more than anything, but he knew he’d be too proud to just take it.
“Yes, you should wait until after then,” Pepper said, turning to a new page in her notebook as she nervously chewed the inside of her cheek. “Tony, we have to talk about the funeral a bit. What do you want the clergy member to say about them? I can interview Sarah Rogers and Natasha Romanov, but this is about you as well. They were just about to marry you.”
“I can’t…I can’t do it…” Bucky whimpered, breaking down in tears, shaking his head.
“…I need to lie down,” Bucky said, getting to his feet quickly and all but running from the room and upstairs to their bedroom, leaving Tony and Steve blinking in his wake.
“Going now!” Tony said as he rushed past Pepper to the door, not wasting any time heading to the dining hall. He knew he’d pushed things with her, he’d have to make it up to her later, but for now he had a fancy dinner to host. On top of having potential fiancés to woo, and families to impress.
“Yeah, after him,” Clint said as he pointed over at Bucky. “I came in through his window when he wasn’t in the room. I was going to kill him here and then move over the outside of the building to your window.”
“Okay this is sounding too complicated and dangerous,” Steve shook his head, not agreeing with the way things were going. He didn’t want to risk his mother in a room next to a bed on fire either.
“My name is Steve Rogers…you can call me anything you want, Steve, Steven, Mr. Rogers, whatever makes you comfortable…” Steve said, deciding to give the kid a bit of choice in his otherwise captive life. He felt both guilty for Bucky and frightened for himself, but he wasn’t going to let Bucky down if he could help it. If everyone else was going to make his life hell, maybe he could be a spot of relief. “I don’t know what you want me to call you, I know th-“
“What, getting in the car with three things?” Bucky asked, breathing slowly with his eyes closed, trying not to get sick. “Four if you include me.”
“I’ll stay here in the castle with Sarah, and Bucky and Steve will go back to our old house. A friend of ours can protect them,” Natasha nodded, sure of her plan and knowing that Namor could do the job. Even if he wouldn’t appreciate being volunteered.
“I would never leave you,” Steve said, realizing to himself how deeply he meant that once it left his lips. “I swear to you, Bucky, as long as I’m living, I’m going to be with you.”
“What?” Tony blurted at the same time as Steve, wavering on the road of a second. “No, Bucky, you have nothing to be sorry for. Don’t you dare think that my father being insane is any of your fault. You didn’t ask for anything that happened to you.”
He couldn’t think of anything he’d done wrong, everyone at work seemed to like him, he hadn’t been inappropriate with someone, all the clients had given him good reviews. Jennifer herself had told him that he was one of the best employees on the customer care team. Though, the more he thought about it, the more he realized it wouldn’t make any sense to send him to the other side of the Stark compound to be fired. He was pretty sure he was heading where the labs were, but he wasn’t nearly qualified to work there, so he knew it wasn’t for a consultation.
“You’re at twenty six weeks, you’re going to get bigger,” Steve said as he gave him a hand getting to his feet. “Don’t take a long shower, don’t tire yourself out.”
“Mhm…” Bucky grunted in his sleep, suddenly shaken from the light sleep he’d fallen into by what he didn’t know. The second he opened his eyes, however, a mix between a gasp and yelp left his lips as he rolled over just fast enough to avoid having his head chopped off. “TASH!”
Breakfast and makeovers for the Rogers and Barnes/Romanov families on thir first morning in the castle. Along with a bit of plotting.
“Is he still on the floor? Tony, get him up, I got this,” Steve said, coming up the stairs with an electric handheld saw, holding the cord in his hand as he walked over.
He was here to win, and he wasn’t going to let Steve distract him from his goal.
“Yeah, I don’t think so,” Bucky leaned back, taking a drink of orange juice, keeping a completely straight face. On the occasions they had to return to the Stark mansion, he coped with their time there, but he was much more at home when they were back in Dawson City. “Steve, can you give me a ride into town later? I want to grab some ice cream. And a pizza.”
“I promise you, I’m not going anywhere,” Clint reassured him.
“What?!” Tony was on his feet in a flash, his act forgotten as he heard the state his Kingdom was in. “How much? Do I want to know how much? And how much tax are the people paying?”
“I’ll go get him,” Tony said, disappearing into the house, going upstairs to change their current youngest son into something more outdoorsy.
“How are you doing, Buck?” Tony asked, remembering what they were talking about earlier and hoping that Bucky was less afraid now. Honestly, he couldn’t imagine what would be going through Bucky’s head, he could barely think with what was going through his own.
“Trust me, you’re the much better choice,” Natasha took Bucky’s hand, giving it a squeeze as she smiled at him. “King Anthony’s going to fall hard for you, I know it. You’re handsome when you clean yourself up, you’re nice when you try, and you’re smarter than anyone at that castle. You can fix this kingdom, you can be the ruler we’ve all needed.”
“You don’t have to be…” Steve said as he got up from his chair, taking a seat next to Bucky on the bed and putting his arms around him tightly, pulling him against himself. “You’re not alone, you got it? I’m not going anywhere.”
“Is that your plan then?” Stane asked, a new smile spreading across his face as a plan began to form in his head. Oh this was perfect, his nephew really was an idiot sometimes. He knew where they were now, it would be easy enough to wipe them out, and Von Doom would be back in the running. If they were really dead, Tony wouldn’t have the heart left in him to oppose them.
“I don’t think that’s going to work,” Steve chuckled softly, trying to keep things light hearted even though he could see how distracted Tony was. “Bucky, why don’t you go have a shower? It’ll help pass the time til we talk to Dr. Marner.”
“If you feel it, and you believe it, then it’s real,” Steve said to him, rubbing his shoulder a little. “They’re still your feelings.” He didn’t know if what he was saying was true, he had no idea what Howard Stark did to Bucky’s mind, but he had to say something to make him feel better, he didn’t want Bucky to suffer any more than he already was.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!”
“Wow…I…” Steve shook his head and laughed out loud, signing the contract. This wasn’t what he was expecting when he came into work today, but he wasn’t going to complain either. “When am I going to meet Bucky?”
Just after eight in the morning, Howard left his bedroom and walked down the long hall to the bedroom Tony had chosen for himself as a teenager. He wanted to talk to his son about their new house guests, figuring that surprising him with something like this well, he could explain it so much better than Steve or Bucky could. He could make Tony see what a gift Bucky was, and he wanted to see his son’s expression when he realized Howard had fixed that problem for the family. Knocking on the bedroom door, Howard waited a moment before letting himself in. Seeing a bag on the neatly made bed and no other sign that Tony had been there, he realized that his son was more predictable than he’d ever want to admit. Heading downstairs, he didn’t waste any time, going straight past the kitchen and dining room without a glance, and towards Tony’s workshop. Not bothering to knock, he stepped inside, able to hear the sounds of Tony’s music, though it was a group he couldn’t identify. He’d given up on music after the seventies, it all sounded like noise to him, which was why it was so much more satisfying to be the one to turn it off.
“There’s a lot more to it than that,” Pepper pulled her papers away from Tony, turning her attention back to them. “For starters, we have to figure out how many families will be participating, which ones are eligible, which ones we definitely can’t include…”
Steve, Tony, and Bucky celebrate their first anniversary together.
“No, just…” Bucky gestured to a chair in the corner that had a hoodie draped over the back.
“Just a bit of one…” Tony said, snatching both pieces of paper to look them over, checking his seal to see which one was counterfeit. They both appeared fine, though, completely official in every way. Taking a deep breath in, he looked at his uncle for a moment as if expecting to be told that this was a stupid idea.
“Then wait until you’re in better shape to do so,” Stane instructed, hoping he could just keep Tony from getting too involved with things before this wedding.
“…thanks, Sarah,” Bucky nodded, his lips pursed as he looked down at the ground in front of him. “I appreciate it, but I still…I can’t pretend I’m not upset still.”
When Bucky’s eyes began to open, he didn’t know where he was for a moment, feeling like he was lost in a dream still. He felt like he was drifting, like he was in a gigantic warm bath, feeling supported but weightless at the same time. Blinking, he looked up at the ceiling, a flash of panic hitting him when he realized he didn’t know where he was,  which only grew when he realized he couldn’t feel his body.  Weakly, he moved to push himself up off the bed, jumping a little when he felt a hand close on his wrist.
“Hello today, how are you feeling Bucky?” Dr. Marner asked cheerfully from her home office. She hadn’t seen Bucky for a week now, though she’d told him to keep checking his blood pressure along with a few other tests he could easily do himself.
“Okay, there’s…there’s an extra person,” Tony said after a moment of everyone looking around confused. “What’s going on?” \
“What if I said you could have them with a man? That he could carry your child?” Howard stepped forward, watching the confusion form on Tony’s face as he gave him a smile. “After you came out, I spoke to some doctors, and they devised a way for a male to bear children.”
Walking from the elevator, Steve carried a box with a chocolate chip banana muffin for Bucky, figuring he should have a treat if Steve was able to go out and eat. Wondering if he should have gotten Bucky some fancy latte or something, he was about to enter the room when a man came out the door with a box in his hands filled with a bunch of Bucky’s favourite video games. Wide eyed, Steve ran into the room to see why they were clearing out Bucky’s things, muffin forgotten in his hand. Stepping inside, he immediately saw Howard Stark standing in the middle of Bucky’s bedroom as the young man sat on the bed in tears. There were a couple others, including Bucky’s nurse, and they all seemed to be packing all the contents of his room. Setting down the box, Steve stepped through the doorway, heading towards Bucky’s bed. Reaching down to him, Steve took his hand as his attention turned to Howard, furious that they’d do anything to Bucky without him there to comfort him.
“Steve, what’s going on?” Bucky asked weakly, not sure he wanted to know.
“Good morning, Bucky, and…Natasha, right?” Pepper asked, smiling when the other woman nodded. “How is your meal? Is everything to your liking?”
“Oh my god…” Steve said weakly, kind of zoning out as the doctor directed Tony around Bucky’s belly, trying to wrap his mind around two babies. One baby was supposed to be dangerous to Bucky, two was…he was afraid of what two was.
Though the colour of his clothes were the last thing on his mind.
“You’re going to be my husband, Buck, just like we’d always planned,” Steve laughed, delighted to see Bucky so happy. It had been a long time since he’d heard that tone in his voice, he’d thought it was long lost. “Only we will also be royalty, which we hadn’t planned. Tony, how’s this going to work? Will we be…also Kings?”
“She’s…she’s really pink,” Bucky said, looking her over in awe, pushing back her little hat to look at her thin blonde hair. “She’s beautiful, she’s really…” Emotion was hitting him hard, though this time his tears were from bing happier than he’d ever been in his entire life. “I get to be her father…”
“Of course I do. After what he’s been through, he doesn’t need to be forced into having a kid,” Tony said, shaking his head and looking back towards the house as he picked another bag up. “…this stays between us, got it? I-I would like to be a parent, but not at the expense of Bucky in any form. I promise you.”
“Will they be reasonable still if I hold out for new boots?” Nick queried, trying not to smile as he heard the whispers behind him.
“I can get these,” Steve said as he picked up the biggest bag, about to grab another when Tony grabbed his arm. “What is it?”
“They’ll stay here,” Tony reassured her, nodding slowly as his eyes drifted off back towards his feet. “I want them to spend the rest of their days in comfort, I’ll give them titles if I have to.”
“I thought I was going to hate you,” Steve whispered, chuckling as he moved his hand up to touch Tony’s shoulder, giving it a playful squeeze. “I’m glad we can do this too. I mean, I didn’t even really look at men before Bucky. He kind of opened up my eyes to that.”
“Yes, Sire?” Pepper asked as she came closer, leaning in just in case what Tony had to say needed to be quiet.
“We can play this til you know everything about me, it’s okay,” Steve said as he watched Bucky take another card and hold it up. “Oh wow, a King, how much does that count for, is this like Blackjack and it’s a ten?” Watching Bucky nod, he took a deep breath, holding both hands up with fingers splayed. “My mom’s name is Sarah, I like apple shampoo, I drink my coffee with two creams, I suck at hockey, my favourite holiday is Christmas, I like Sam Adams beer, I’ve only left America once to go to Mexico, my first car was a Ford Escort that I crashed into a tree, the first time I got drunk I accidentally peed in the laundry hamper, and I love peanut butter.”
