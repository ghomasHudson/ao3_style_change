And how, Steve wondered, were they managing to do that? Unless, of course, they had actually switched them off. As he understood it, the whole world ran on computers and Jarvis was probably the most advanced computer program on Earth. There was nothing better, according to Tony, for cracking a computer program than a more advanced and intelligent computer program. "How about the Pentagon's?"
The Iron Man flew south, following the California coast, the stars bright above and the sea and cliffs dark below, the lights of cities and houses streaking by to his left, with only the very occasional flash of navigation lights to relieve the blackness to his right.
"It is in the Iron Man suit," Tony said, releasing her. "I'm going to drop in on the boys and girls at Stark Air Specialists and see how they're getting on with my secret project."
Yet, though he was exceptionally busy with the rebuilding of the tower (and, where he could help, with the rest of Manhattan), pulling apart what he had been able to salvage of the Chitauri tech, upgrading the armour, setting the research department straight at least once a day and laying the groundwork for the next but one innovation in personal communications, part of his mind continued to speculate about the attack on Steve's Brooklyn apartment.
"When I was captured by the Ten Rings," Tony ploughed on, ignoring the protest because he was pretty sure Steve didn't really mean it, "one of the tortures they used to try and force me to build weapons for them was to hold my head under water."
For a while they followed a gravelled track at a slow pace, Tony looking to his left, then he turned suddenly, making Steve grab for a handhold. They bucketed across rough pasture, where the only sign of a track was some crushed and flattened grass which disappeared into a line of trees.
He held out an arm and Steve stepped into his grip, his right foot resting on Iron Man's left. They shot into the air to the accompanying shouts of the SHIELD agents.
Tony lifted the cup to join in the small toast. "I'm honoured to meet you. Phil was a..." He paused, thinking back to his conversation with Captain America on the helicarrier. They had both been right, but Cap's verdict was the only one appropriate here, to a generous relative. "He was a good man. He died trying to save one of us."
"A few bad apples doesn't mean either the government or the Pentagon is all rotten," Tony said, in an obvious attempt to comfort him.
Before the ice, he'd managed to banish this ... desire ... for some men to the very back of his mind. Before the serum, he could not imagine approaching a man any more than he had been able to approach a woman, and after it there had been Peggy...
The Panther grimaced. "Once it was the king's bodyguard, then its members were appointed guardians of Wakanda and now... I think the best term for them would be 'secret police.' Our very own Gestapo," he added with a quick, speculative glance at Steve, "though formed with the best of intentions."
"You do realise that Tony's probably sleeping in the armour? He said he was going to do that on the way back from Wakanda – though at that point he was hyper from some sort of stimulant King T'Challa had given him. Not personally, I mean, but authorised the local physicians to administer."
"Ha! Less than six years before we make arrangements for your hundredth birthday." Tony saw the shadow cross Steve's face and cursed himself. He couldn't take back that unwelcome reminder and was left floundering for a way to make this right. "And boy, will it be some party," he added lightly.
My life has come to this, Tony thought, as the sort-of SUV that Okoye had located and T'Challa and Steve had 'liberated' approached the cluster of graceful spires rising against the fading stars above the rain forest that spilled down to the edge of the lagoon.
They put out fires, dug into smouldering piles of rubble and earth, and carried away bodies, alive and dead.
T'Challa parked the SUV alongside a line of trucks inside a cavernous space that seemed to be beneath the building, though moonlight cascaded from a circular light well above. The area had originally been heavily planted, but the grasses were wilting, and the edges of the palms were brown and brittle. Undergrowth had been beaten to the ground and some areas were blackened and burnt either by fire or chemicals.
"The best choice. Volstagg the Valiant is on watch. When we leave it will be as the Warriors Three."
"Hey, you saying that I'm not loved by the NRA?" Tony protested. "I would have thought they'd adore me for being a living embodiment of the Second Amendment. I'm going to send back my membership card."
And yet there was a flicker of warning in Steve's mind as he met Howard's eyes, however honest his gaze.
Though, since he had met Presidents and Prime Ministers and Generals and Admirals who were now legends, and not been intimidated by any of them, there was no reason his stomach should lurch like this.
There was a small, affectionate smile as on Steve's face as he absently rubbed Tony's thigh. "Maybe he was one of those people who can't tell other people how they feel about them. I suspect he never shut up about you to his friends and colleagues."
Steve leaned forward, palms flat against the window, because his legs were trembling, the strength in muscle and bone melting away. He bit his bottom lip, staring out into the night because if he concentrated on the sensations roiling through his groin he wouldn't be able to stand, wouldn't...
As he tumbled through the air, Iron Man caught a glimpse of the woman standing on the remains of the prow, arms raised, then the man with the sword snatching the gun from where it was lying on the deck, with the man who had been carrying it unconscious – or dead – beside it.
"It would certainly confuse them," Tony agreed. "Everyone knows Steve Rogers was Captain America, and if you use 'Captain Rogers' most people will assume you're thumbing your nose at the government. Even if they believe it's your real name, they'll probably think you're your own grandson..."
T'Challa barked a score of words in what was presumably Wakandan, and the warrior backed up even further, reaching up with one hand to touch the wall, part of which slid aside.
"Thank God!" Sending his armour back to its niche in the Armoury, but keeping one of the gauntlets, with its palm repulsor, in place, Tony hurried into the house.
There was a disbelieving snort close to Tony's ear, but he was too angry right then to identify the origin. That assumption plainly came from Pepper, and told him all too clearly why she had been trying to contact Steve. What was more, Happy, one of his oldest friends, had plainly swallowed her version of the story – whatever it happened to be – whole.
Once the building and those Hatut Zeraze who remained alive were secure, Okoye returned to the Golden City, hoping for better news of T'Challa. A number of the prisoners accompanied her, but her team – plus those prisoners who were not only fit to fight but determined to do so – were assigned to Tony, whether as allies, bodyguards or to keep him on a short leash he wasn't sure. Using captured vehicles, they spread out to look for more of the enemy, while Iron Man took to the air, Jarvis hunting heat-signatures through the jungle.
It was Jarvis who answered, the traitor. "Originally, yes, Captain, but she has already sent her apologies to Mrs Arbogast. Indeed, she did so some hours ago."
More dangerously, he plainly had a plan in mind – yet another thing he hadn't yet explained – but at least he had made it clear that Steve was a part of it.
"I'm going to work in the isolation chamber over there," Iron Man said, waving a gauntleted hand. "In the suit so I don't contaminate the samples. Thor told me it would be several days before you’ll  have  your full super-soldier strength back and you look like hell. Bed, Steve. Now."
Steve dismissed that with a wave of his hand. "How are the tribe going to get to the island? Is there a bridge?"
"Well, yeah, this is SHIELD, buddy. After the Avengers split, Fury thought Cap would drop right back into his place with us but that wasn't happening. So he planned to tug on the leash to bring Cap back into the fold, convince him he'd be safer with SHIELD."
"You think SHIELD is behind all this?" Steve asked, keeping his voice to a whisper. He was remembering his feeling of panic when the explosion in his old apartment had blinded Tony and flooded the room with a gas would have killed him if he had not been in the Iron Man suit.
Tony felt Steve tense at his side, one hand snaking out to the doors, presumably checking their escape route – but Tony, who had glanced at the doors only seconds before, knew that the locks, if activated, could not be opened by passengers.
Yeah, right, maybe, "That timing sucked so much," wasn't quite right for the occasion, particularly as he didn't want to criticise Pepper – had no right to criticise Pepper.
"Everyone get back. I'm gonna drop it now," Iron Man's electronically distorted voice boomed. He shot backwards, the repulsors blinking out and the tail dropped, denting the pavement.
Bruce snorted. "Well, if you put it like that... I found what would react with the contents of that sphere you brought from New York. It just reacted rather too well."
Tony stared at him with widened eyes; then his surprised expression cleared. "You looked him up on the net, right?"
But had become obvious that his own organisation was leaking too. Someone was trying to kill him... someone who knew he would be within easy reach of the eStark store in White Plains on that particular day, someone who knew that he was arriving at Vicstar Field instead of McGuire, and someone, it appeared, had known he would be in Seattle today.
Well, if someone else took charge of his everyday life and, between them, Steve, Jarvis, Bruce and Mrs Arbogast were managing that task well enough.
"Anything I need to know, Jarvis?" he asked, with his mouth full, knowing the AI could pick out his voice amid the babble.
At eleven fifteen, Jarvis announced that the malware had been removed and the data was accessible, or would have been if it was not encrypted, and Jan announced that she was whacked and was going to bed. Betty followed her.
"Your actions put the population of Wakanda at risk," Tony snapped. "Mine saved one and a half million lives. What was more, I was wearing several million bucks' worth of battle armour. You had nothing.
"Tony," Steve said, with a quick glance to where Thor was standing beside the door, watching them with fondness tinged with amusement. "Thor may be in exile from Asgard."
Steve hadn't mentioned the artefact over breakfast or asked to see it, which Tony figured meant that he had already discovered it was gone. Maybe he even guessed what he had done the night before. Of course, he would also guess that Tony could retrieve the artefact any time he wished – and he would have to in the end, or Gene would want to know why. The last thing he needed now was a fight with the Mandarin.
He was beginning to believe that their rescuer did have enhanced senses, because even his own serum-increased night vision had made out nothing ahead. Even now he could not discern the shapes of the pursuing vehicles behind their blazing headlights. Between them, though, the passing jungle stood out sharply in those headlights, if blurred by speed.
Hands – not his own – were holding him upright and Stark was asking him, urgently, if he was all right.
"Three of 'em. I sent the Mind and Time Stones back to where they should be right now. If hadn't been for Thanos's horned minion I could have put the space stone back—"
The warrior swung the butt end of the spear at his head. Ignoring the temptation to grab it, Tony slid underneath the blow and struck upwards at the warrior's unprotected throat.
As quickly as he could with the pain slowing him, he donned the suit. As he settled it into place, the door opened. Steve stilled. By a stroke of good fortune, it was opening towards him, so that it blocked the view of both Steve and the bed from anyone entering.
Tony grinned to himself, though without much humour. He was beginning to get to Fury, after all. "You could try. But that wouldn't get you your agents back. And if you can't find Wakanda, how can you invade it? Going to throw another nuke this way? I wouldn't advise it."
Ahead of them, the track ran through a gate in a high thorn fence and on into a large clearing, filled with a village of circular mud huts thatched with grass. Except that the walls were not mud but some material that glowed warm gold in the rising sun and the thatch
SHIELD had to be involved. If anyone had been serious about killing Steve, it would have been easy enough to shoot him or set a decent bomb instead of that ridiculous flash.
Pepper wasn't there very often, but Happy applied himself with grim determination. Being outclassed by the Black Widow apparently rankled in a way that being outclassed by Steve did not.
. Goddamn, what was I thinking about when I told Bruce I could trust you? Keep your pincers to yourselves! Christ, I'd be better off with Twiki! Jarvis!"
The Panther nodded. "You're right. We think that the source is a massive meteorite that fell from space many millions of years ago, probably before there was life here, because I do not think anything but bacteria could have survived such an impact. Chance and tectonic movement eventually brought it here and closer to the surface.
Steve had almost forgotten. That Tony had not was something he was going to have to consider later. Now, though, there were more urgent questions. "Jarvis, what was the cause of death?" he asked.
Her eyes only flicked away from his for a moment, but it was enough to give her away "Perhaps. I wonder if you have any idea how many times I have been warned not to trust you."
"Uh. No. Why should you think that?" The words were out of Tony's mouth before he realised it might have been better to let Marilyn go on thinking just that.
"I don't need your protection. I'm Iron Man, remember? Guy who saved New York from being nuked by our own side? Who's got a whole superhero backup team to call on if he needs them?" Not that there was much left of that. "You, on the other hand, will be a hell of a lot safer away from me and from SHIELD."
"I don't remember much until I... er... woke up and found myself the size of a doll in the middle of Oklahoma. Things got a bit exciting for a while, until I spotted some buildings. Once inside, I managed to avoid the inhabitants but not the local radio station, which  one of the kids was tuned to permanently at full blast. I needed to let you know where I was, so I ... suited up, to use your phrase.
"Jarvis has the source pinpointed – a comms tower just over the county line," Tony told Steve. "Looks like it's Ten Rings behind everything, including the weather and power loss."
"There cannot be enough memory or processing pow—" For the first time ever, JARVIS broke off in mid-complaint. "Sir, I— Is this the future of technology?"
For the first time in as long as he could remember, Tony was happy. He was full of sublime food and had managed, all afternoon, to avoid the personal conversation he was dreading. He was driving a supercar convertible with the roof retracted in the Southern California evening sunshine with Steve beside him. Of course, he couldn't open her up, but Steve's awe at the very-nearly-unique car had been sweet. So was the sound of the perfectly-tuned engine.
Steve, now bareheaded, glanced towards him, then, as Tony attempted, not very successfully, to apply the air brakes, vaulted easily on board.
prisoner, to do with as I please," T'Challa said haughtily, not pausing as they entered a corridor, with closed doors to either side, labelled in a script that looked like it bore a possible relation to Arabic. "He has information about the whereabouts of my brother – after I have that information you may have him to do with as you wish."
Tony was regretting his decision to base himself in Malibu. The long flights from New York or Seattle left him with far too much time to think. There was only so much planning he could do, so many calls he could make, so many calculations he could work through with Jarvis, until his mind moved, inevitably, to all his regrets.
Watching Steve closely, he saw him frown in puzzlement, then his eyes widened as he understood. "You'd do that?"
And, because he was who he was, he stepped forward to face that anger when all he wanted to do was run for cover. "Tony, thank god you've gotten back from Wakanda in one piece. Are T'Challa and Okoye okay?
And he was back, once again, on that train snaking through the Alps, and Bucky's face was suddenly vivid, mouth open in the scream that still haunted Steve, as he fell, all too slowly, away into...
"Bodies?" Tony was asking sharply, without looking up, his fingers dancing across the StarkPad's screen.
Tony put his fingers over Steve's mouth. "Hush. You won't. I just wish we had the next week or so to ourselves."
"Damn right. I can have the contents of the truck shipped here as normal freight, though I'd prefer you supervised the transfer, Hank."
"There is a point near the American coast around which the hurricane seems to be avoiding, though it is nowhere near the eye,"
Though he would have sworn that Tony was engrossed in his work, the other man looked up at the sound. His expression changed from concentration to concern in an instant, and then he was crossing the room to Steve's side.
The Smartphone videos of that had been blurry, particularly when blown up in the hope of getting detail, but they had been enough to bring Bruce on the line even as Tony reached the Tower, and he had landed with the other man's voice in his ears.
Would that man have fallen in love with Tony? There must be some way to give him the chance, to give him back the life...
Ten minutes later, Pepper arrived in the Rescue armour and started living up to her superhero name, but, really there was no one left to save, at least not in the water. The waves – water and shock – from the explosion had struck buildings and highways, bringing down the former and bowling cars from the latter. Luckily, they had not been strong enough to flood more than a couple of dozen roads and three railroad stations.
"Which is given off when one of these mini-portals explodes. So it's our diversion." Tony picked up the mercenary's gun and gestured with it towards the door. "Shall we dance?"
They were deep in a discussion resulting from the pooling of their respective deductions when Jarvis interrupted them:
The weight on his back was resolving itself into a warm person, maybe human, probably female to judge by what were almost certainly breasts squashed against his back, and his nose brought him the scent of leather and a familiar perfume.
"The girl is Whitney Stane. Madame Masque. The mask allows her to disguise herself as anything or anyone, but it has also affected her mind. She escaped from SHIELD custody over a year ago. The Doombot is a substitute for its creator, almost identical and also capable of disguising itself. It was the one that flew them in, as Whitney can't – fly, that is. Victor Von Doom was the ruler of Latveria – a genius capable of inventing such a thing. He's also dead."
"Tell you what?" Tony asked, with feigned indifference. "Scientific details that'll just go over your head?"
He shook himself. He had no right to lecture Steve about recklessness, one way or the other. Time to put his feelings on the subject behind him.
"Oh, I'm not so sure about that. But at least she held off killing me until we arrived here," Steve said, forcing a grin which widened into a real smile as Natasha and Clint spilled from the second elevator.
"Wait and see. Meanwhile, make that super-soldier strength useful and help me shift these crates to the loading bay."
And Tony moved with it, without thought, between the girl and the monster, powering up the palm repulsors as he did so.
North was unperturbed. "I'm still hoping Rogers will try to rescue you," he replied. "I'm told we have at least four potential buyers for him, or at least his blood."
"Two aircraft, two teams, double the insurance," Natasha said. "If these new beauties can't handle another couple of bodies, they aren't going to be much use to us."
It was only five minutes since the War Machine attacked, but night fell more swiftly here than in New York.
It was almost human, but with a head far too big for its body, a massive jaw and sprouting antennae. The floor around its feet appeared to be moving, a living black carpet spilling into the room.
But even as he had been making the decision that college could wait until he and Stark Solutions had helped his Dad lick Stark International back into some sort of shape after the mess Stane and Hammer had made of it – and reclaiming it had been difficult enough, though it had left him even greater respect for Roberta Rhodes' ability as a corporate lawyer – he had had that talk with Pep's father.
"We've stored the less critical material there – and the Chitauri machine, shrunk and buried," Hank told him. "Bruce figured you wouldn't want to risk that anywhere near a population centre."
"I think we're safe enough. I've exchanged pleasantries over the internet with these Wakandans, and I don't think I've done anything to offend them. They're also a source of naturally occurring vibranium. Which they supplied to my Dad. I think they're on the side of the angels. Meanwhile, I'm gonna get some sleep. I suggest you do the same. Tomorrow is going to be interesting."
"It is only because of SHIELD that Rogers is alive right now," Fury said. "With no thanks to you. You gave up on him."
"You're as obnoxious as Steve with the orders," Tony said, putting his glass on the table and reaching for the butter.
"You think you might be able to reverse-engineer the serum?" Tony wouldn't ever underestimate Bruce's genius.
"Unless Storm and the lady are agents of the mercenary group we fought in Wakanda," Steve pointed out. "Be careful, Wasp.”
"Of course. Last night he was too tired to communicate in anything but grunts. This morning— Well, I wouldn't be asking you if I'd gotten anything coherent out of him before he disappeared, apparently into a meeting he'd normally avoid if at all possible. What he did say was that I am not to allow Jim back into the Tower. Which is ridiculous because Jim has the override codes to Tony's workshop as well as the penthouse."
Steve only really heard the first word. "Don't call me that," he said dully. "I'm not him. I can't be him. There's been some terrible mistake."
"Score one to you, Stark." The voice was light and amused. Then the pilot took off her flying helmet, revealing a second helmet of bright blonde hair. Now she was standing close to Tony, her blue eyes met his on a level. She said, "I want to talk to you about James Rhodes."
He had little time to sightsee, though, because the Master ushered them through double doors and into another room, this one more conventionally furnished in a vaguely Asiatic style.
There was a deliberate tap on his helmet. Then someone shoved at him. Though he tried desperately to keep his balance, to force the weight of the suit to hold him upright, he failed. There was an instant of unbelief, then the world upended itself and he crashed sideways to the ground.
Through his panic he remembered that there was at least one other Tony Stark here in New York right now, supposedly about to share shawarma with the rest of the newly-formed Avengers. Was this a result of their intervention? The other possibility, that a version of Tony had been diverted during his and Steve's previous visit to this time was, if anything, an even worse possibility.
God, he really needed to examine Cap's shield. Vibranium steel – his father had said that in his hearing. His interrogators had said the ARC reactor was fuelled by vibranium and talked as if they had access to a natural source. It all added together, but would these people talk to him? At the very least, if they were satisfied he was manufacturing vibranium rather than buying it from an illegitimate source they might leave him alone.
Tony had almost dropped his passenger in shock, his breath caught in his throat, the ARC reactor heavy in his chest.
Instead, Steve broke eye contact. Turned away. "I haven't seen Sam since... since the showdown with Zemo," he admitted.
Then a darker shadow passed swiftly between him and whatever-it-was, and that leading dumbbell shape...
"That is better," the Wakandan's deep voice said. "Even with the cowl down, I kept seeing my brother. Though I am not sure that is what Stark thought—"
"Jarvis, bring round the stealth armour and load it in number 2. Barton, Romanoff, just follow the black armour when – ah, here it is now. You got comms in?"
"I admired Howard, but I was never quite sure if he regarded me as a friend or an interesting experiment carried out on a naive fool." For the first time since hearing of Howard's decades-long search for his body, Steve wondered if the man hadn't felt guilty – or if, perhaps, other people hadn't made him feel guilty.
Realistically, it was impossible that his fingerprints would work the mechanism, if, indeed, it had ever worked, but he still pressed his splayed hand into the depressions.
Tony still wasn't sure whether Gene's overtures were genuine, but there was evidence that the Mandarin had been surreptitiously intervening in emergencies throughout the Far East, and not on the side of the bad guys.
Steve didn't dare move, didn't dare say anything. His fingers were still tangled in Tony's hair, and his lips bruised and tingling from the kiss, the taste of Tony's tongue lingering on his.
The thought anchored him even as he watched the Ancient One repair the broken window with a wave of her hand.
Steve took a few steps towards Xavier, noticing that neither of them was leaving footprints on the sand.
"Well, well, visitors from Asgard," Tony said out loud, trying to keep his voice steady, despite his heart thundering in his ears, his breathing quickening.
As he rose into the air he saw what purported to be a Sikorsky S-70C in commercial livery swinging into as tight a turn as it could manage at the sight of the Iron Man. He was willing to bet that it was armed with as many guns as its Blackhawk relative, but its pilot knew when it was outgunned.
"What am I doing here? I had a message to say you were stuck at O'Hare and needed me to be somewhere in the Black Forest.
The aircraft, flayed of its rotors, lay on its side, fire glowing under the topmost engine. The air stank of fuel. The pilot, a dark silhouette against the red glow, was apparently struggling to open the cockpit door.
"Jarvis! Once we're through, shields up!" Steve risked a glance behind him. There was no sign of any of the vehicles, or any of the men. But the helicopter – or whatever it was – was swinging in pursuit—
"I need to see Steve first." Not that he had any intention of going to any Charity Gala. Not tonight.
"We're both a little worse for wear – and no, Barton, alcohol was not involved, just my own hijacked tech. But if you insist... Jarvis, video link."
"Weather's not so good. Looks like a storm coming in from the Pacific," Tony said. Then, into the silence: "Clint?"
"Yes, sir, Captain, sir," Tony snarked, but there was no force behind it. It sounded like banter with a friend. Which is what it felt like.
He didn't really remember being carried through the corridors or into the elevator, but he woke up as he was being unwrapped from the comforter. The sheet beneath him was silky on his skin but he missed Steve's warmth.
Steve winced inwardly, remembering how he had asked Tony if Coulson's death had been the first time he lost a soldier. Plainly not.
He'd seen the Captain only once since, after they'd actually unfrozen him. He'd been comatose even then, floating in a life support tank. Fury hadn't suggested Tony help to wake him that time.
"They had a list, and I was only halfway down it," Lori said. "I had the impression they weren't looking that hard. They friends of yours, Tony?"
"I'm in," she said. "And I'll tell you one thing, fellas: Storm didn't kidnap the VIP. She's just a kid but she's free and carrying a handgun and one of those weapons we saw back in Wakanda. Storm's got the same. Probably don't realise the funny-guns are keyed to one person and pretty much useless."
Hogun unwrapped the bundle he was carrying and spread the contents over the end of the bed. "Change into these. Quickly."
For answer, T'Challa pulled the White Wolf mask over his head to cover his face, then, somewhat cautiously, opened the door and stepped out. "No one here," he told Tony. "Come alo—."
"How would I know?" Pepper snapped back. "Jarvis won't let me in, or give me any explanation. I can't contact the plane. I had no idea where you are. I still don't have any idea where you are. Unless you’re at Travis."
Tony came close to panicking, but by then his arms had closed around Steve and Steve was clinging to him and he was almost overwhelmed by waves of tenderness and desire.
"I wouldn't be too sure of that, Director. Velasco took his Chitauri space-force carrier to McGuire."
He hit the water ass first, and hard. It left him with an open mouth and too much water coming in as he thrashed his way back to the surface.
Tony snorted. "That's pretty much how I landed in this mess in the first place, letting her think. And how the hell did Mrs Arbogast know about Pepper anyway? No, no, they're as thick as thieves – of course Pep told her, if only to make my life more difficult." Tony ran both hands through his hair. "Damn, damn, I was never any good as CEO. I need to appoint someone, at least temporarily." His mind was skittering over names and not finding anyone suitable. Fuck it, he'd left everything to Pepper and now...
Tony shook his head. "Nope. That may be compromised. Besides, Thor and his group are out west. By what may nor may not be coincidence, that's the way that the kidnappers of Lieutenant Storm and Princess Shuri were taking them, though their final destination probably wasn't in the States. The War Machine armour attacked me and Cap in Southern California, and was tracked by sharp-eyed fans coming from the North along the coast."
Steve left him to it and roamed the room, not sure what he was looking for, but that there would be something.
"Okay, Iron Man, go get them. I'll handle below," Steve ordered as he pulled a tiny but powerful flashlight from one of the pouches of his utility belt.
It seemed like a long time before Steve knelt and placed the posy of tiny blue flowers below the headstone. He remained kneeling, head bowed, for another minute or so, then rose and looked about him wildly.
But Tony's arm was tight across his chest, holding him back. "Don't, Steve. They're top SHIELD agents – the Black Widow and Hawkeye – you wouldn't stand a chance."
Here, indeed, they were. Jarvis opened the doors to the house without being asked and Steve led the way through to the huge living area.
Steve could imagine the lightning blasting, the hammer flying through the air so fast it was a blur, all Thor's terrible strength and power unleashed against those who threatened his lover, his friends, and was glad he had not been there. He might have felt compelled – to try – to stop Thor, even though he knew that, in the same circumstances, he would have had no compunctions about killing.
But when Betty contacted them – and he was sure she would contact them because she was one smart lady – he knew that both of them would go barrelling to the rescue. All the Avengers would, to rescue one of their own. Besides, he needed Bruce and had a feeling he was going to need the Hulk sooner rather than later.
"Would depend on how much he wanted to interview Storm. He could have gotten to Vandenberg before the plane landed, or even intercepted it."
She moved to the edge of the balcony looked out into the sky, shading her eyes with her hand. For a moment she was still, then she turned and smiled at him, though it did not reach her eyes. "All warriors have bad memories, and according to Thor you are Midgard's greatest warrior."
The vibranium and all of Hank's, Jan's and Bruce's equipment was loaded into the truck, then Hank and Jan took the passenger seats in Happy's cab, and Marilyn decamped into the interior with the cargo and Tony.
Tony held his breath, stilling his harsh panting, but that only made the creaking of the straining armour more obvious. But was that the hiss of the servos?
"Is this mutiny, Rogers?" Fury demanded, and Tony couldn't tell if he was joking or ready to pull out restraints.
New York had been disorientating and difficult in its mixture of familiarity and strangeness, so he had come west looking for an America more in tune with his memories, and found kindness and hospitality and suspicion and patriotism and faith. Yet each was so often tainted with an idea of America that he did not want to recognise; of ignorance, of prejudice, of fear and, God help him, a hatred of foreigners, of immigrants, of the Federal government...
"Not that I saw. It went under the waves and the ship vanished. Not before the woman had done something to the suit, though."
Steve left her to it and searched the leader of the mercenaries, finding what seemed to be a communication device pinned to the man's collar; he only hoped no one was trying to call him right now. A small device hooked to his weapons belt seemed more hopeful, with its little infinity symbol and 'look we're making this simple for idiots' on and off switch, and a bright red button with a sliding lock.
"You never responded when I flirted with you," Tony protested. "Never responded when anyone else did, either." Though he'd actually been grateful for that. "It's one of the reasons that I want to give you the time and space—"
Pepper was staring at the Gulfstream. "If Bambi didn't pass my message on why are you still here? You should be—"
"Oh, for fuck's sake! Stop lying to me," Tony shouted. "Everything was just fine this morning. Then a few hours later, you run for it. Why?"
He opened his mouth to comment but Pepper was off again. "Tomorrow can we fly out to it and see if General Fury will let us on board? I still need to impress him like wow! And don't think I've forgiven you yet for letting Dad send me off to California without you. You owe me, Tony Stark."
Tony groaned. Pepper had picked his replacement PA, and he had been sure she had done so because the comfortable, middle-aged woman was no threat to her position. He had been proven wrong. Mrs Arbogast organised him with the same efficiency as her predecessor and was even better at keeping time-wasters away from him. People underestimated Pepper because she was beautiful, Mrs Arbogast because she looked like a pleasant middle-aged matron. Tony never liked crossing either.
Tony took a deep breath. "Dr Henry Pym is a biochemist who has invented a way to shrink people to the size of insects. Jan also grows wings when she shrinks to wasp size – and I'd really like to know about that myself. Hank has now, according to Jan here, invented a way of turning himself into a giant. Jarvis projected a holographic image of the Hulk, which I'd programmed into a strategy simulation, to disguise him. I presume he vanished by shrinking to ant size when Jarvis switched off the projection. I recognised the technique. Jarvis and Steve worked something like that a few months back..."
Once erect on her Jimmy Choos, she eyed him eyed him coolly, and greeted him with an even cooler, "Mr Stark."
"Aliens will be back. If not the Chitauri, then others. Earth needs to be ready to battle them, if and when the time comes. Wakanda... could help."
"First thing of all, the Department of Defense have persuaded the government to enact an emergency measure granting the Army exclusive and perpetual copyright on the Captain America name and uniform. They're also claiming that, as Cap was upgraded by a 'government project' – and they carefully don't specify which government project – he belongs to them, body and soul."
Hennis smiled nastily. "We don't need a warrant. We're operating under the authority of the Joint Chiefs."
"Loki was lent another Infinity Stone, the Mind Stone, disguised as a sceptre, to help him conquer Earth. The mastermind behind it was a powerful alien warlord called Thanos, and within the next six years Thanos had accomplished his aim, to create what he thought of as 'balance' by killing half the living things in the entire universe using an Infinity Gauntlet containing all six Stones..."
Though Tony was trying to sound indifferent it was plain that this simple courtesy had affected him deeply. Had his childhood really been that bad?
Only when he did that, when he dropped his guard, the faces from his dreams, his nightmares, came dancing across his vision: ghostly, old, bloody, white-eyed, accusing...
"Come this way," Xavier said, swinging his wheel-less chair around in the air. "We can talk in my study."
Tony sighed. "Steve is morally right and Bruce is right about the dangers, particularly as Steve is still alive. My Dad knew damn well he should have destroyed this thing, and I know I should destroy it too. I
They left him alone in a small, comfortable room furnished in what he was beginning to recognise as typical Wakandan style – half twenty-second century, half traditional East-African.
"Our enemies come here by magic," Okoye said in a tone that brooked no argument. "I have had them under observation and they now have vehicles that can travel through the deepest jungle. Those appeared overnight in the city, as if the magics that protect us did not exist."
"Now you're scaring me, buddy," Rhodey said, his voice sharp. "You're doing something that's gonna get you into trouble, aren't you?"
Hill shook her head at him. "Stark, Banner is immensely dangerous, Rogers is suffering from PTSD, grief and culture shock, Barton needs medical help after being screwed over by Loki and Romanoff requires just a small shove to turn back into the amoral killer she was before Barton recruited her. Director Fury thinks you'll all come back when you're needed, but how sane any of you will be is another matter."
Steve fought to control his breathing. "I think I had a right to be angry," he said. "In the garage, you brushed me off," he went on, knowing he sounded petulant and not caring much in the tumult of his feelings. "When I got out of that car... seeing you alive... all I wanted to do was go to you. I'd been... worried."
Tony's expression was troubled but he merely said. "I'll bring you some black coffee and sugar and cream separately so you can experiment," and was back within thirty seconds with just that, while Howard served him with a plate heaped with what turned out to be very tasty food.
"Why should I?" Pepper asked scornfully. "When we've been together less than half a dozen times in the last two months. When even then you were ... distracted. You never really commit to a relationship, Tony, we both know that."
"The call we heard summons my tribe to the Panther Island," T'Challa replied, his voice close to inaudible though his mouth was less than three inches from Tony's ear. "We are moving in that general direction, though I find it hard to believe that Hunter would make such a mistake."
It disturbed Steve that he had far more personal evidence that the Norse gods existed than he had of the reality of Jehovah, Jesus or the Virgin Mary.
"Closed," Tony replied, opening the faceplate of the armour. "The mercenaries guarding it are dead, though you have a massive clean-up in prospect at the mine. Between one of their guns and the vibranium-steel doors the roof didn't stand a chance. That also took out the mechanism generating this side of the portal."
"Yeah, and SHIELD agents turned up just after the explosion – and hightailed it out again as soon as they realised I'd spotted them."
And Steve, Tony knew, was still burning that torch for a woman who might or might not still be alive, whose living, breathing double he had encountered on the battlefield.
Tony kept his voice quiet and neutral, though he wanted to grab her, shake her, or perhaps fuck her through the mattress. Except the time for that was past. "How long have you been working for SHIELD, Pepper?"
"SSR were incredibly lucky with Steve," Tony agreed. "Can you imagine what the hawks in Congress and the Pentagon would do with a whole regiment of super-soldiers – a military super-hero squad?"
"Yeah. As if I wasn't unsuitable already. Then there was Peggy." Steve's voice had softened, become slower and reflective.
Steve's jaw was jutting dangerously. He stared at Tony for a long moment, then turned away and strode for the door.
"I already have to deal with you being the absent chairman without our LAX team and your personal pilots reporting a missing seventy million dollar aircraft."
Jean looked puzzled. "But I could read his mind," she protested, "though it was the strangest I've encountered. He certainly believed he was Doom. The woman with him was shielded, but what little I could read suggested something even odder. I don't think she was human."
Steve, meanwhile, had subdued White Wolf and was grinning down from the walkway at Tony. "Good work," he said. "Keep the gun and pick up a couple of those machetes. They could be useful."
Taking a deep breath, he allowed himself to fall towards the wall of cloud around the eye, letting the armour be swept along by the force of the wind – no use fighting it – using the repulsors just to stay horizontal until he could see the waves reaching up for him.
All three bots had retreated to the far side of the workshop and were making no attempt to assist him, which was probably just as well as he had already consigned them verbally to the scrap yard, a step down from his more usual threats, which they tended to ignore.
"I called Jarvis, and he told me you weren't available but put me through to Jan. She suggested a plan."
"It may not be dangerous in itself." Bruce was looking abnormally grim. "But if I was still working on the super-soldier program and had gotten access to it I'd also be demanding access to Steve, to his blood and other tissue samples. And
The instant the vehicle stopped, darkness fell around them and the loud noises of the jungle night ceased equally abruptly. So did the driver's chant.
To his surprise, it was Happy's voice that answered. "I'm fine, boss. I'm sorry. I was just sitting in the limo watching for anyone who might ticket me, an' suddenly I couldn't see nothing or hear nothing. Then I guess I must've passed out."
"Wait for me." T'Challa lowered the roof, pulled the eared black hood over his head, and took an inhumanly long leap onto the tree trunk, running swiftly along it and disappearing into the forest.
"And thank you for saving all our lives yesterday," she added, placing a mug full of coffee and a plate piled high with pastries in front of Steve.
Bruce snorted, but there was affection in his voice as he said, "I don't know how he puts up with you."
"What's goin' on?" That was one of the soldiers, who was following, though he was having to jog to keep up. Tony noted that his (unfamiliar) gun was in his hand. "Hey, big bad Wolf, that Stark you got there? Why's he still alive?"
"I am happy," he protested. "I have Steve back. I also have you back. I just... lost my cool. There are too many reasons... I will not have him die again for me. And I'm lousy at relationships, Thor. I fall for the wrong people or I lose them, and it's always my fault. I can't do that to Steve."
"That's tempting, but I'm not sure it'll do your aching back any favours." Steve was grinning as he bounded to his feet. "Go on, Tony. I take it your housekeepers have gone so I'll change the linen here, have a shower, and then see what there is to eat. By that time you might be a bit more human."
But Hennis had him again, was shaking him furiously, and was demanding that he open the elevator doors.
It was gone now, and a world without Steve was dull and grey and didn't matter very much. Tony knew he was in shock and that, sooner or later, he would lose this detachment, this clarity of thought, but he wished the numbness could go on forever...
"What?" Tony had hoped that Steve might have been in contact, had expected Jarvis to put him in touch or at least give him news. This abrupt announcement was a warning of sorts – Jarvis wasn't saying who it was for a reason.
Steve's head came up. "I think hundreds of people are dead," he growled. "God knows how many blocks in Queens and Nassau County have been flattened and all because you sent Barton and Romanoff in prematurely to the wrong target—"
"I think it was lucky for the people of Seattle, co-incidence or not. Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt."
Tony saw Jan's eyes narrow in anger. He said, quickly, "Jarvis, have Ms Potts' luggage brought up out of store, and any of mine that she might want to borrow. Also, alert Happy that I need him. He's to meet me in the garage."
The work on the conversion of the floors of the tower just below the penthouse to accommodate the (still mainly absent) Avengers proceeded apace with Steve – and Pepper, when available – attempting to put a brake on Tony's wilder and inevitably more expensive ideas.
"He says it allows him to talk to aliens," Jan said airily, ignoring the man's expression. "We were testing it out when we heard—"
"Only when you need the Avengers – and then I won't be alone. Or a soldier," Steve replied. He threw Fury a sketchy salute, and climbed into the SUV.
By all logic, the fugitive knew, he ought to be heading into the city, where it would be possible for him to buy clothes – and shoes, he really needed shoes – and to find somewhere to hole up and consider his options.
Iron Man landed lightly on the sidewalk just behind a plainly shaken security guard who was explaining to the cops that, "He held them off me with a shield. I didn't believe in Captain America an' he wasn't in uniform but it couldn't have been anyone—"
Jane Foster's voice, at a distance, cried, "Wait! Thor..." This was followed by kissing noises, then silence, then Dr Foster's voice again: "He's gone. You know, it never occurred to me that he would be able to do anything against something that big or I'd have asked him to go myself."
"There's an alien device – machine – artefact, I don't know. A... friend of mine sent it to me because he couldn't figure out anything about it, couldn't make it do anything. Neither could I, until I touched it by accident, had a really weird experience. Soon after, you woke up."
Tony hurriedly opened his eyes and lifted his head and, yes, Steve Rogers, unremarkable in chinos and a plain blue button-down shirt, was leaning back in an armchair that Tony didn't actually recognise, fair head tilted to look upwards in, presumably, the direction of the hidden speaker from which Jarvis's voice was emerging.
That's the Howard in him, Steve thought, but had already learned better than to say so aloud, whether to Tony or to Tony's friends, so he turned the conversation to the ridiculously eclectic art – some superb modern pieces, some quite horrible kitsch – scattered about the penthouse, already aware that the former represented Pepper's taste and the latter Tony's. By the end of the meal they were chatting, if not like friends, then like people learning to enjoy each other's company.
Every eye was suddenly on him. "Steven!" Thor's exclamation was unashamedly happy. "Did we wake you? I knew we should not have brought Volstagg." He threw a wide grin at the huge redheaded man.
The disappointment was so overwhelming that Steve opened his mouth to curse at Jarvis, but Tony beat him to it. "Fuck it, Jay, I told you I didn't want to speak to anyone. If it's that urgent you can take a messa—"
"Yeah, right. That was before, this is now. Lockdown this lab. I don't want anyone in here until I've finished. That includes Steve and Bruce and Pepper and everyone else I might have been foolish enough to give overrides to."
Tony sat up abruptly, stomach churning with a fear he couldn't have explained. "What's he doing there?"
"Hold it right there," that was the mercenary leader. "What you do with your brother is your affair, but Stark is another matter. The quantum-bridge has been destroyed. The men guarding it are dead or out cold. My lieutenant has vanished. And Stark..."
"You think you hold all the cards, don't you, Stark? Okay. Deal." He touched his finger to his ear. "We're done for the moment. Withdraw all agents back to the helicarrier."
"Naturally," Iron Man replied. "In ten years there'll be nothing else on the road." The cars' passenger doors slid open. "The accommodation isn't up to that in the Tower," he went on as Steve and Clint slung the hand baggage into the back of the first SUV and Danvers, Storm, and Natasha climbed inside, "but there are beds, food and lots of hot water. It was an on-site hotel back in Dad's time, but we revamped it into apartments for visiting consultants, air force personnel and politicians. Stark Energy leases it from SI, but they currently don't need it. So... eat, sleep and we'll work out our next move when we're all refreshed."
Thor reached over Tony's shoulder and placed a hand on Steve's forehead, then moved it to cover his heart. "What evil caused this?"
Steve dropped Tony abruptly and tried to turn away, but Tony blocked his path. "Idiot," he scolded. "I didn't say 'stop', I said, 'slow down', just after I said I wanted to seduce you. But.. I just... I just want... need... to make it clear... So you can back out if you want with no consequences. I'm gonna stay with you whether you have sex with me or not. If you'd rather just sit and watch TV, or cuddle on the sofa or even in bed, that's great. Just so you know you don't have to pay anything for my company tonight. Or any other night, come to that."
Steve turned back to Tony, apparently unconcerned by the disappearance of his escape route, and reached out to tip his head to one side and shine the flashlight on it. "It doesn't look too bad – though we need to get Bruce to take a look at you."
"Isn't one a consequence of the other? Hold yourself in readiness, Barton." Tony rose to his feet. "Meanwhile, I have a company to run." He grabbed the last remaining doughnut and crammed it into his mouth. "Ciao," he said, round it.
The rest of his team was now arriving; circling behind the SHIELD agents, to the latter's considerable alarm. One vehicle, however, floated in between Tony and the Wakandans.
But Tony was now ready to repel boarders. With Jarvis protesting in his ear, he held up his left hand, palm outwards, and even Fury paused at the sight of the soft glow of a repulsor powering up.
And he, too, hesitated for an instant, because the man standing beside the portal was clad in scale armour, with an open-faced helmet, a scabbarded sword at his side. The mercenaries were ignoring him but their leader turned, his gun coming up to point at Iron Man.
"And none of us are looking to sell," Tony said easily. "Steve, this is Miranda, our utterly divine chef. She doesn't admit to a surname. Miranda, my guest is Captain Steve Rogers."
Steve grinned to himself, but he was growing increasingly uncomfortable. His erection, trapped between the leather seat, pants that were suddenly far too tight, and Tony's hip was now actually painful.
Now it was Tony's turn to take a quick breath of surprise, one he suspected, from the pregnant pause, was something Fury had also taken.
"Possibly, but not without defeating the king in mortal combat. And the Panther god would not accept him – or her – and much of our defence rests on the Panther god. Though how they have breached those defences, how Klaw arrived at the most sacred place in Wakanda, how these foes entered the Golden City without the co-operation of the God himself, I still have no idea. Yet they did it, and until I know how—"
"Already have," Steve pointed out. "Would you prefer fireman's or bridal carry?" His voice held a gleeful note that suggested he was looking forward to it.
When Tony entered the master bedroom, he found Steve asleep on the bed, fully clothed except for his shoes. He looked just as pale and exhausted as he had down in the workshop. Tony ached to stretch out beside him and take him in his arms.
Tony burst out laughing, more carefree than Steve had yet to see him. "Jan, I want you to meet Steve Rogers. Steve, this is Janet Van Dyne; heiress, playgirl, biochemist and fashion designer. Or did you sell the fashion business?"
Tony shook his head. "What you don't know, you can't be pressured to reveal. I don't want you torn between your friendship with me and the Air Force. Or the law."
Rhodey whistled. "I can see why you're hiding out in the woods. But you have another problem, Tones."
"Then I do so. Gladly. We will discuss terms later." T'Challa held out his hand and Tony shook it. "You will not be out of pocket, or disappointed."
"We're here to help with the clean-up and rebuilding," Velasco explained, "and Colonel Rhodes here has been assigned to help."
"You know, that's odd," Fury said, looking hard at the glowing repulsors as the massive alien war machine edged along Madison Avenue, its sides only a couple of feet away from the right hand skyscrapers. "Because the night after the battle, people up in Connecticut reported a series of lights in the sky, and the shadow of something very big moving across the stars."
"Damn you, Tony Stark," Pepper said, her voice suddenly quiet. Though her cheeks were now flushed and her eyes bright with unshed tears, she was in command of herself and her voice was steady. "Do you want me to leave right now?"
Tony let out a huff of relief. "Oh, I guess you couldn't... Wow, you were still kissing me even though you thought..." He took a deep breath. "Pepper – that's over – finished – kaput."
He made his decision. "There's a bio-engineer called Helen Cho," he said. "Keep an eye on her career and arrange a meeting when you think the time is right."
"Lunch," Tony said. He took Steve's hand and allowed himself to be hauled to his feet. "And horror is probably right— what the—?"
Tony really did not want a run in with the dogs and, judging by the tension in Steve's hand as it gripped his arm, he felt the same way. He wondered if it was the dog or the black clad man that caused the same tension in the leading members of their escort as they came to a halt a few feet from the vehicle.
The lab buildings were unremarkable, screened from the local road by trees, but far more extensive than Tony had expected.
"Says the man who turns green because of the action of gamma rays," Tony snapped. "So maybe you should be the one who thinks there is something wrong with modern theoretical physics."
"What does she – and Odin – think he can tell them? Legend says that Odin knows... well, a great deal."
Someone opened the door from the living area. Steve reached to switch on the lights, saw the woman in the cat-suit from Howard's message, and a man in black and purple, with a drawn bow in his hand, and started to roll out of bed.
"Rituals?" Tony interrupted, pouring scorn into his voice. "Christ, Virginia, I never expected you to be a Mason. But then, we never shook hands."
"I could have killed him any time if I'd wanted to," Tony pointed out, his voice cold enough to freeze Steve in the ice again. "You saw Iron Man take down Chitauri Leviathans, Rogers. If I'd deployed missiles or the Jericho weapon, every single one of you, with the possible exception of Wanda, would have been dead. But I don't kill friends. And what Barnes needed was – is – help, both legal and psychiatric. We needed to know the brainwashing had totally worn off. Which it hadn't. Hydra wins because
Steve's first feeling was annoyance, but quickly followed by concern. He crushed the impulse to put Tony to bed. Lifting him was certain to wake him. And he dare not touch him, not right now, when his control might slip so easily. Instead he changed course, opened the French doors as quietly as he could, strode across the jetty, dropped the robe and dived straight into the lake.
"Tony." Steve spoke from behind him, then a hand fell on his shoulder. "It wasn't Rhodes." His voice held all Captain America's moral certainty.
Steve had known that the facilities here were extensive, had even seen photographs and plans laid out on the computers back at the Tower, but the sheer scale of the reality once again brought home how much Tony was worth, not only in monetary terms. And how much else depended on him.
One thing about this unseasonable weather; it made observing Tendring/Ten Rings Tower from the low cloud comparatively easy, and the noise of the wind and hail covered the sound of the repulsors.
Steve shoved the pilot at him, and Iron Man hooked a gauntlet through his collar, before holding out his other hand. Steve tried to wave him off, but Iron Man was having none of it. His hand closed around Steve's arm, then the repulsors on the boots flared and he was towing both men out of the wreckage and towards the flickering light of the surface.
"So not one of ours. And someone wanted John Storm off the project. Did he annoy some influential staff officer or other?" Steve asked.
Tony opened his mouth to yell a protest, and it was then that the explosion tore up the road where the car would have been if it hadn't been skidding across dirt inches from the drop to the creek.
It was only then that he realised that Steve's arm had gone round him in support. "They know about the electro-magnet in your chest," he said, close to Tony's ear, and the phrasing was a warning. "I had to tell them what it was for – they were going to remove it. They thought it was a weapon."
"Master. Yogthulu. I call you." The voice, cracked and lifeless, came from across the room, from the battered head of the Doombot.
That would be the evacuation alarm. Everything was going to T'Challa's plan. With the assurance of a man on his own ground, he set off towards what Tony presumed was the nearest exit.
"This should be returned to Asgard," Thor had said. "Its absence would also split the time stream. Besides," he added brightly, "you may need it. And I have Stormbreaker now."
Finally, though, SHIELD released him, and he blasted up as high and fast as the suit could take him.
Whatever Fury had to reply was lost in the roar of Iron Man's jets as he rocketed away towards the horizon.
Tony dived for the trunk, laying his fingertips against almost-invisible sensors. The trunk sprang open and there it was, the case containing the lightweight version of the armour. It couldn't provide the protection or the weaponry of newer suits, but it had repulsors and a link to Jarvis and Tony had practiced donning it so often now that it would take him less than a minute.
Bruce was also grinning, possibly at his own joke, possibly at Hank, who had taken a couple of steps into the room, careful of the carpet of ants at his feet, to reveal that the insect-like head was, in fact, a helmet with antennae and a jaw-encircling comms unit – a fact which Tony knew because he had built it for him.
"Probably not." Tony said, as he began to leaf through the papers, speed-reading and scribbling his signature as required. "But she doesn't have a choice."
"Maybe he thought you knew?" Tony whispered. "Maybe I'm... darling, don't you know?" Terrified of the response, he leaned down and kissed Steve, who pulled in those last few inches to lie across his chest.
Occasionally, watching Thor with Jane or Bruce with Betty, he felt a pang of regret for his relationship with Pepper but he watched with disapproval as Darcy flirted with a seemingly oblivious Steve. Sure, she was pretty and funny and intelligent and, if you discounted the seventy years Steve had spent frozen in the ice, only a little younger than he was, but...
"You called Hunter – White Wolf? – your brother," Steve said. "But... er... that doesn't seem likely."
"No? The tech isn't more advanced? Was Hydra really that far ahead? Or you don't remember crashing into the ice?" Stark's eyes had narrowed to thin slits of blue. There was an intelligence there that ought to have been frightening, but somehow wasn't.
"Well, it's better than trying to interrogate White Wolf," Tony pointed out. "Unless we can get our hands on their all-too-fuckin'-effective truth drug. Besides, I want my armour, and the only way to get that is to contact Jarvis. Easiest way to do it is via the internet. Hence, computers."
"That was before—" Tony stopped himself before he could admit whatever it was his tongue had been going to say for itself. Not "before I fell in love with you" because it wasn't true. And even if it had been, he wasn't going to lay either of them open to subsequent heartbreak.
As he came out of the doors, with security in pursuit because he had hurdled the barriers and not handed in his temporary pass, the armour – the Mark VIIA – was waiting for him, gleaming red and gold in the sunlight, surrounded by its own admiring crowd with their phones raised in photographic worship. Tony spread his arms wide and it assembled around him, though he had to lift his feet in turn for the boots.
. Your cerebral cortex wasn't operating. It didn't re-boot until the serum had healed it. Which is a perfectly good explanation for your loss of memory! If they hadn't wanted the serum they'd have turned off life support a year ago. So even if this stupid theory of yours is right, Steve, he's dead. If he ever existed at all."
"Except us? I don't think so," Cap suddenly reached out and diverted a blade inches from Tony's arm as it came in from the side. "We need to get out of here. Can you fly?"
Unable to stay in the same building with the people he relied on conspiring against him – though he would have been hard pushed to say what sort of conspiracy they might be hatching – he paused long enough to change into a suit and dress shirt (not a tux, which would make him stand out in the venues he had in mind) and took the private elevator down to the lobby rather than the garage. He still had to find a chauffeur he could trust now Happy had transferred his allegiance to Pepper, damn him, and knowing better than to risk one of his special babies in New York traffic when he had drunk as much as he intended – he'd once misplaced a Lamborghini for six months – he took a cab and headed downtown.
The answering sigh of relief was also engraved on Tony's memory for all time, as was the way Steve had allowed himself to be drawn close. Even in post-orgasm drowsiness, their bodies were a perfect fit.
"Wait!" Tony didn't want to test whether the armour would stand up to super-soldier strength. It would be a pain to get the dents out without the facilities of the armoury. He ordered the armour to retract not just the faceplate but the whole of the helmet.
He crushed panic. Life without Pepper was not something he was ready to tackle just yet – maybe never.
Steve was sitting on the floor under the shower head, his arms wrapped around his knees, water streaming from his bent head and down his shoulders.
The President shrugged. "She's legally an adult and she's learned how to shed her security whenever she feels like it. Normally, she tries not to worry me, but she won't follow orders when they’re relayed by certain key members of my staff."
Iron Man flung light down onto the track he was creating, and the truck followed its path, reversing as fast as the path become visible in its mirrors.
"That was the destination on Danvers' flight plan. And that's where the UFO reports are coming from, of strange lights in the sky and a private jet putting on an aerobatic display."
Which was all too true. And deep down he had been relieved. He liked – loved – Pepper but he'd been – was still – more attracted to Whitney – and he hadn't been in the least bit jealous when Pepper had been, sort of, pursuing Gene. Well, not jealous of Gene. Maybe he had a thing for supervillains after all.
"Who the hell are you?" Steve was demanding, in a voice which was so unlike him that Tony kept silence as he dropped from the sky to land behind him.
It was by no means the first time they had travelled in this way, but this was the first time Steve had had time to savour it. He loved flying with Tony, not just because of the exhilaration of speed and danger, but because of being close to him, reliant on his amazing technology. He had always found it faintly erotic, so what had happened tonight perhaps shouldn't have surprised him.
"Jarvis, physics doesn't work like that. If nothing else, every single fuse and transformer should have blown and if they didn't then the wiring would burn out."
But then there was the memory of Tony relaxing in his arms, sleepy and trusting, as he carried him here, to his own rooms because he was terrified that he would not be allowed to wake up next to him, Tony's arms closing round him the instant he came to bed, with a little mutter of contentment before sleep overtook him—
That produced another grin. "They'll have problems finding a candidate because I haven't any descendents."
As the doors slid open, the squad barrelled out, guns at the ready, going high and low. Hennis was the last out, jerking Tony with him, as red-crew-cut shouted at him to go back.
"I was not running!" Steve knew he was being childish but Tony in this mood brought out the worst in him without any effort at all.
As they scrambled back through the forest, he was busy working out just how he was going to raise his suspicions with Steve, or whether he ought to at all.
"That's worrying." Tony shifted a shoulder downwards so that Natasha could see Steve's back at eye level.
He was too great a problem for Tony and Howard to deal with, for all their confidence in their own judgement. They were taking too great a risk for someone they didn't know and had only met a couple of days ago.
"Tony," Steve interposed, without force, but there was a note in his voice that blocked the other man's flow of words. "Not Rhodes, then, and Bruce is fine, so..." He suddenly looked alarmed. "Is something wrong with Pepper?
Inside, it was cool and dim, save where the sunlight streamed in through the open doors, illuminating rough-surfaced walls hung with rugs, weapons and animal skins.
"Let's hope I don't," Steve said absently, turning slowly around. The airfield stretched away like a concrete desert, weeds emphasising the cracks in the runway, the buildings roofless and boarded up... except for the great hangar towering to their right, shadowing half the airfield with its bulk.
And moved into Iron Man's metal embrace. Then Tony was kissing him; half angry, half tender, all desire.
"Computer, amendment to my previous order. The house and armoury are to be secured at all entry points. Free movement only to me, Dad and Captain Rogers," Tony ordered as he hurried toward the doorway. He paused in it and looked back. "Dad, look after Cap – Steve – for me, would you? He's lost his memory of everything before he went into the ice. Even his name. Fill him in as much as you can. I'll be back as soon as I can get rid of Pep without making her suspicious."
"Bother." The milder Jan's expletives, the more strongly she was feeling. She looked down at herself and winced. "Hank needs to make some changes to this fabric," she said flippantly. "The rain's turning the yellow bits of this costume transparent. Don't suppose you're going to be a gentleman and lend me your metal suit."
Tony grinned to himself. The Iron Man had been hit by Thor's lightning. This style-challenged idiot couldn't have the same impact.
"And I was the one who put Hank and Jan at risk, too, sending them here without your permission. I should have known it was a combustible mixture."
"Please lie still, Captain," a polite, educated, English voice said. "I have informed Mr Stark that you are awake."
Someone spoke close enough to his helmet and loudly enough for him to hear. "They didn't tell me to expect Iron Man but I expect they'll pay me a bonus, particularly when I bring them the armour—"
Tony wasn't sure that allowing Hennis to drag him over to the wall that hid the private elevator from which he had emerged into the lobby was cooperating. But with the rest of the assault squad clustering about him, he was quite certain that his plan, at least, was working.
Hank, who had been looking as if he were about to burst in an effort to suppress words that Steve feared would condemn him and Tony, suddenly let them flow. "Got interrupted yesterday. Jarvis insisted, and everyone else had disappeared. Didn't want to upset King T'Challa, either, as he controls vibranium, so I guess you want to keep him sweet." He stopped and added, in a very different tone: "You look pretty beat up, Tony."
"Probably, but it was Cap who suggested we take a spare arc core with us, told us where to find one and how to change it, if necessary."
It was better this way. Better than facing a world in mourning for its hero, and certainly than facing Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Spider-man or, worst of all, Morgan, ever again...
The elevator hummed and jerked slightly, pressing against their feet as it picked up speed. A glowing line besides the buttons showed how far they had ascended.
The restraints on Tony fell away, and T'Challa took his arm, hustling him out of the car, across the parking area, through a door into a circular, dimly lit circulation area, and straight, it seemed, into the arms of oncoming warriors.
She was only just in time. Doom – or whatever facsimile it happened to be – was now fully materialised, and an unknown woman – white haired, slim to the point of thinness, ethereal, lovely, definitely alien – stood beside him. She did not look happy to be there.
"Well, then," Bruce began, "Christ!" Tony hoped desperately that exclamation didn't signal a Hulk trigger.
"No, sir. SHIELD were apparently satisfied on their access of the dummy database. They do not appear to harbour any suspicions that it is not what it seems. "
"That's because you don't really know him," Tony said dryly. "Though you're a super-soldier. So there's that."
He wondered what Steve was dreaming about: Peggy Carter, probably. He didn't want to believe that it might be Barnes or Wilson, didn't dare think it might be himself.
"We've no weapons," Tony said. "No shield. Not that I'd've risked it in a place that produced vibranium."
That hurt, desperately. But not as much as what Tony had done. Tony who had everything to lose – his wife, his daughter, his home, his friends – had willingly sacrificed himself to save the people of the universe from a second Snap.
His wound had taken six days to heal completely, leaving his back unscarred. Tony maintained that this showed the super-soldier process had given him an accelerated healing factor, and that this was probably the reason he had survived being frozen in the ice. He also told Steve all the reasons why this should not have been possible, which made quite a long list.
"Good, we'll be going then." Tony clanged to his feet, started forward and then, realising he had no idea which of the slightly darker patches against the dark grey background was actually the door, stopped dead, and demanded, "Where's my helmet?"
when he set this—" Trap? Puzzle? Puzzle! "Steve," he said, trying to keep the excitement out of his voice. "Did my Dad have access to your fingerprints?"
"Like you were after that night at the Barton farm?" Steve cursed himself for that, for how much it revealed about how abandoned he had felt.
Lying on the sun-warmed flat rocks behind the ridge that lay to the south of the lake, with Steve at his side, their hands just brushing, Tony should have been reassured. In fact, he was deep in worried thought. It had been a slim chance that becoming lovers would dissipate the cabin's pull. Distance, altitude or a good chunk of solid rock between them had been more hopeful.
A different voice interrupted. "Mr Stark, I have the UN Ambassadors from Kenya and Tanganyika in reception, together with their entourages. They are insisting on speaking to you tonight..."
It seemed to Steve that he was standing on a wide empty beach which stretched away in every direction, until, at the far horizon, it disappeared into sea, or mist or both.
"Whew," Tony said. "A whole lot of people loaded for T. Rex in a city whose laws effectively ban assault weapons. Though I suppose if those are our military the point is arguable. Ready the building shields, Jarvis. Any move in our direction, just raise 'em – don't wait for orders from me." Even as he spoke he was checking positions and patterns and letting his mind run freely. "I don't think we're under attack. They aren't watching us but the approaches, apart from the different units who are watching each oth— What the hell?"
Hunter shrugged. "No one in your country knows that you are here, Stark, and my allies here insist that you came here to aid T'Challa in his quest to destroy all that matters about Wakanda."
Which was distinctly unfair. If there had been any chance of an accident Tony would not have allowed Pepper to arrange for it to take place in the full glare of publicity, and he would have been suited up himself.
For a while there was no sound in the room but that of his own harsh breathing and the thumping of his heart.
There was a short silence, while Tony rubbed his face with his hands and tried to get his temper under control. What was more, in instructing Jarvis, he'd forgotten the most important command of all. "And, fuckit, trace Steve and Jan."
"I could fly the suit right now," Tony protested, because he knew Steve wouldn't let him attempt it.
"God, what a mess," was Clint's opinion, when the explanations has been given, the briefing finished. Tony had somehow managed to push away his personal pain, and force himself back into a semblance of detachment.
"I found it," Gene said. "In a chamber of a Makluan temple I thought I had already explored. It isn't Makluan, though. I examined it, but couldn't work out what it was or what it did. So I passed it on to the person who might be able to."
"Jean." Tony took off at a run, slithering down-slope towards the lake. He could hear Steve's feet following, coming closer, and then the other man was past him, running at a pace he could not hope to match.
Tony dropped to his knees, shield held over his head, sliding downslope as blood, metal and scorched flesh rained down on him.
So he grabbed a towel and scrubbed himself dry, scowled at the pale face with its stubble and dark shadowed eyes staring back at him, donned a towelling robe and padded back into the workshop.
"Metaphor, Rogers, metaphor. I don't have the clout with the White House or the Department of Defense that I had when I was their chief armourer, and Trade and Energy are in the pocket of the big oil companies, but I should be able to track down who's behind this, and why the White House is backing them. Let me deal with all of it. I'll just need your proxy for the legal department." He took a deep breath, then went on, his voice taking real fierceness. "They've taken everything else from you; I'm damned if they're going to take the name, the uniform or the shield. Next, Jarvis!"
"Which none of us are likely to see," Natasha said from behind him. "Do not use our names so freely, or I'll communicate yours – your real one - to the authorities."
"Well," Iron Man said, "as you still won't let me make you a suit, and I'm not sure I'd trust either of the assassination twins with one, or two, and Jan's flight isn't long distance, the team needed wings. So..."
Which Tony was accessing with Extremis right at that moment, brushing aside protection and firewalls. At his side, Rescue, who was practically jumping up and down with excitement, raised her faceplate.
"And you make sure I can find you," Steve said, in sudden revelation, not sure why he was still angry, not even sure that he was still angry.
Suddenly, two voices overrode the question, coming from the helmet speakers, fighting each other for recognition. "Sir, life signs—"
All speech stopped as Tony and Natasha entered behind the Ancient One. The dozen or so men and women gathered in the room were mostly dressed in a variation of short robes over wide pants, though one woman was in shorts and tee, and two of the men were dressed in business suits. Tony looked for the crimson cloak with the personality as worn by Strange, but did not see it.
A body wearing one of the white and red nanotech suits he had built for travel in the Quantum Realm was sprawled on the floor twenty feet away. From here he could see its neatly coifed fair hair.
As he approached the research centre, a craft similar to the one T'Challa had used to rescue him and Steve from White Wolf's clutches rose to meet them, its lights blazing in the new darkness.
Except he had no right to be angry. Steve had acted to save lives – his, Pepper's, Happy's and Hill's – before putting his own at incredible risk. Tony hadn't been able to decide, when he landed on that hangar roof, whether he wanted to hug Steve or hit him, then shake him until his teeth rattled.
Tony waved that aside as irrelevant. It was time to close the trap. "Most importantly, though, you were the only person who could have told anyone I would be in Seattle last week. SHIELD was there. So was a gamma-ray monster."
Tony had said something about making it easier for them both when he carried Steve at speed. But the technologies Tony had employed to solve the problems of grip, impact and oxygen deprivation were, Steve guessed, unusual even for the twenty first century. Perhaps he ought to thank him.
Steve still hesitated, but he knew he could not stop Jarvis from raising his voice, sounding the alarms, or strobing the lights. He sighed, bent down and kissed Tony gently on the cheek, then the lips. "C'mon, honey, wake up."
Tony snorted, punched Bruce on the shoulder rather too hard for it to be totally friendly, and hurried out. He might just have time for a shower as well as a change of clothes.
They needed no words. They had not needed words since the battle of Manhattan. Finding the correct controls, Tony sent the vehicle backwards and to the right.
"What do you want me to talk about?" Tony asked airily, avoiding Steve's eyes, though the blue of the sky beyond the windows was almost the same colour. "The weather? I'm not British and besides, it's all right here now that Thor's gone, though there's a nasty hurricane out in the Caribbean."
"You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike," Tony muttered, as they disembarked in an area where the latest tunnel widened to form a cave, of sorts. The vehicle's lights picked out what looked like tool marks on the nearest wall, but hardly penetrated the four tunnels that sprayed off at irregular intervals. "Next thing you know, we'll need to find Flood Control Dam Number 3."
"You can, of course, but I have a mansion sitting right on Central Park that is currently unoccupied. It's secure – at least it was in my father's day – and we stripped out anything valuable many years ago."
"Which would finger SHIELD as the people who planted that booby-trap in Steve's apartment, particularly as they knew about it – knew who Steve is, where he was, could gain access—"
"Even if that were the case, Steve, and everything says it isn't, then it's not you – it's something that's been done to you. You're innocent."
"Jarvis, what did I tell you about tattling to Steve behind my back? Oh, Bruce said 'Hello' by the way, and wants to know why you put up with me."
Even as Steve scrambled off the bed, Tony, who had made no move, said, "I take it this is important, Jan. And private."
"Right now I'm more worried about Lieutenant Storm. And about what the fuck is happening in the Air Force. 'Sides, you need me for that flight plan and permission to land. How do we get to LAX?"
"Good. Then line up the info the Widow and Clint sent us, with printouts for Steve. And alert Marilyn that she isn't going home for a while..."
Tony worked surprisingly hard, with the same fierce concentration Steve had seen during his manic bouts of creative engineering. It wasn't as easy for him as it was for Steve, whose muscle memory was phenomenal, but no one could fault his application. On those days where there were no lessons, Steve could usually persuade Tony to spar with him and it seemed to him that Tony enjoyed those sessions more than the formal lessons.
It was Thor who answered. "Captain Rogers was healed in Asgard. It was he who sent me to turn the hurricane aside."
When reality slowly re-emerged, Tony found he was lying on his front, with his wrists bound behind him. He could see very little, though there were several pairs of booted feet, but he could hear T'Challa talking swiftly and volubly in Wakandan.
"But then I wouldn't have been in time at the mine. They were about to leave, with some vibranium, at least, leaving the portal generator hidden. They can't get back here right now, but as to where they've gone and who's behind this, we need to question your prisoners. They're our only lead."
"Because I know how much your brothers both value you," Steve responded. "I also know the royal family of the Panther tribe does not kill unnecessarily." He leaned down and hefted suit-and-sunglasses over his shoulder.
"Hi, Pep," he said brightly. "Just checking that you got my message, and asking that you get me the names of the PR people I got out of bed last night."
Well, at least then he wouldn't have to face the fact that he was on a team with a Norse god, Steve decided wryly. Call Thor Odinson an alien if you liked, but he had intrinsic powers beyond that of any human, was able to command the storm, wielded a hammer called 'Mjolnir', had a father called Odin, a mother called Frigga, an (adopted) brother called Loki and was, apparently, over a thousand years old, yet still considered himself young and relatively untried.
Steve shook his head. "The first thing I remember is a mock up of a '40s room – but they got the detail wrong. The radio commentary was of a baseball game I'd actually attended." He paused, frowning. "I was too concerned with that, and my memories of the Red Skull, to take much notice, but I think the inside of my right arm was a little sore." He looked at each of them in turn and added, candidly, "I heal fast, since the serum."
"Sure." Steve turned back to the screen with an expression that suggested nothing so much as morbid curiosity, while Howard took Tony's arm and hustled him out of the room.
"There are no spacecraft, military or commercial, in development at any Stark company," Jarvis answered.
Steve was too damn smart – and bound to side with Rhodey. Sure, Rhodes had had a difficult choice but that wasn't
Pepper, as ever, ignored him. She grasped the artefact in her bare hands, lifting it from the bench and turning as she squinted at it.
"It's still following," Storm reported. "Gaining on us. Damn fast, considering this plane gets as near as dammit it to Mach 1. D'you suppose it's gonna project another portal?"
For the first time, there was the hint of a laugh in Virgil Potts' voice: "You and me both, son. So she's still on the Iron Man team?"
"Place we can eat great food and can't be disturbed. Besides, I want to give the Ferrari Zegato a run. You're going to love both, Steve. Let's go find out what Ann-Marie thinks is fashionable for a Californian Fall."
"Tony, you must know how much I want to stay with you," he said now, "but this body isn't mine. Maybe... maybe even your love, this strange bond between us, isn't mine either. Maybe, when you meet him—"
"Get out of here! The gas—" Tony struggled to his feet, with outside assistance that he presumed was Bruce. And where was Steve anyway?
Tony ignored him, concentrating on the familiar part of Selvig's Tesseract analysis. If you factored in influence of Dark Matter—
The silence was broken by a loud mechanical grinding, with the hissing undertones of hydraulics, echoing horribly in the chamber.
Carefully, he climbed out of bed and onto his two feet, clutching the headboard as the huge room began a slow spin.
"It's not just about sex." Steve said firmly. He stood twisting his wedding ring on its finger, and then raised his eyes to meet his brand new husband's. "I love you."
"Sure he can, but why haven't you asked SHIELD?" The answer was already clear to Tony before he'd finished the question. "Or is the info from SHIELD?"
"I didn't even realise I was being abducted until I met the Princess. I thought it was a USAF SNAFU. Maybe it was."
The woman gave a scream of rage that resembled that of the figurehead, and flung out a hand, fingers spread.
Tony wriggled until his head was close to T'Challa's right ear. "Any idea where we're headed?" he whispered.
He did not mention Summers, but Steve could guess that neither he nor Tony was fully trusted, at least by Summers.
Tony sent the vehicle sweeping in at head height into the fight, making warriors and dogs leap for their lives.
Bisexual, they called it now. Back before the war, he hadn't been able to put a name to it. All he had known was that to act would have been to dishonour all the Christian morals his mother had tried to teach him.
"And maybe you should, you know, guard against them going behind your back..." was Bruce's contribution.
And if any of them should happen to get in a lucky shot – well, maybe the wholesale slaughter option would look a whole lot more attractive...
Howard sighed, released Tony's arms, so he could run a hand through his hair. He was trying to smile, but Tony had known him too long to believe it was anything but forced. "You don't get enough sleep, son," he said. "Yes, I know I'm a fine one to talk – guess it must be genetic – but at your age you need your sleep. Maybe you should get some rest, join us later?
"You want even more miracles than your father did," Marilyn grumbled. She handed over two folders. "Luckily, you own most of the voting shares in StarkEnergy."
"Effectively," Steve replied, equally quietly, but showing no sign of flinching. "I wasn't going to let you go in alone – and Happy's a great guy, but he wouldn't be any help to you if something goes wrong."
"Eat," Thor said, placing a plate with chunks of bread, slices of rare beef, and cheese in from of him, a knife and fork precariously balanced in between the food. "This is good too," he added, moving butter, mustard and mayonnaise to where Tony could easily reach them.
Steve, white-faced and terrified, shook him so hard Tony's jaw set in an obvious attempt to stop his teeth rattling. "What the
Tony groaned. "Not sure I can get out of bed, let alone walk. No, it's okay. Just a little stiff. No, no, I mean my muscles are stiff, though the other might be true with a bit of encouragement from you, and not so little..."
The wall was over eight feet tall, but Steve vaulted it easily. He still wasn't sure that coming back to the Stark house was the right decision, but it was already easing his fears, reassuring him that he was safe and welcome.
"Yes, I do. Shhh, baby. Let me do this for you." Tony's fingers were working with such easy skill that Steve could no longer resist, even if he had wanted to, or frame any further words.
"He fought on my side for the same reason Natasha did – because they knew that, however disagreeable it might be, the Accords were the only way the Avengers could survive. I was right.
It was dappled grey, the same colour as the clouds and the sea, and it appeared to be a giant flying reptile ... Steve's memory supplied a reference – a creature attacking in
"You've been brushing up on your Old Norse," Selvig said, "or maybe Icelandic. Or was it that AI of yours instructing you? Any word from Thor?"
The two new aircraft had gone, but the big doors were open, and the tarmac outside was floodlit. A group of six people in red coveralls were standing waiting for them.
"I'm sure you did. Welcome to sunny California," Tony said dryly. He turned to the other woman, and smiled."Hi, Helen of Troy. You're very welcome here. Steve, could you escort this pair back to the house? I need to call the cops about an attempted mugging that just took place outside my gates, and then CSI the... um... scene to make sure said cops don't find any evidence that contradicts my story. They won't push too hard. Jarvis is going to provide them with CCTV footage showing the muggers drove off in a hurry when Steve arrived, aren't you, Jay?"
It was as well that Steve complied, as a couple of dilapidated farm trucks came barrelling out from the buildings at the bottom of the shallow valley, filling the road.
He should not have been surprised – the balcony could have held most of the party still going on on the other side of the windows. Indeed, his father had suggested staging a firework display to be viewed from there, but that might have brought back too many memories of their fight against the Makluan.
Instantly, he pushed back, taking the whole length of Steve's cock into him. He wasn't really ready, and Steve wasn't small, but it felt so good, even the burn and stretch...
Velasco was shaking his head. "Can't have happened. Security was tight as a drum around that thing, and those working on it died in the explosion."
There was a squeal in the background that did not sound like either Thor or Selvig, even as Dr Foster said, "Yes. Yes, of course. Thor, honey, don't crush the cell. It's fragile, at least in your hands."
Every muscle in Steve's body was tensed, as he cursed his helplessness. If he had really been Captain America he would have been able to protect Tony and Jean, help Clea, but... he... could... not.
"I didn't know we were going out." Steve had been anticipating – and dreading – a private time here with Tony to talk things over.
"Chunk of concrete," Steve replied, peering over his shoulder in an attempt to see the damage. "I need you to tell me if it's just bruising or if it needs a dressing." He looked down at his shirt and added, "I guess it might."
"I've benefitted so much from the serum," Steve said, "that denying it to others, to my country, seems incredibly selfish. Then I remember that the Red Skull was also a result of something very like the serum. So, if we are all agreed, we destroy the Vita-ray device. Tony will look over the files, extract those that relate to the construction of the device, and then we'll burn them too."
Then the sky was steady above him and Tony realised, far too late, that once again Steve was throwing himself between him and danger, whatever the cost.
Hovering at five hundred feet, Iron Man and Captain America surveyed the wreckage, watching as the SWAT team poked, with apparent impunity, at the jumble of stone, concrete, steel and glass.
Steve sighed and, laid down the charcoal and not-paper on which he had been drawing, leaning back into the pile of cushions at the raised end of the recliner that Thor and Hogun had installed beneath a transparent canopy on a balcony that thrust out towards the sparkling sea.
Though he wasn't sure that, "I'll have that drink now," was actually meant as a statement of surrender.
Steve opened his mouth to explain, but before he had uttered a single word, Iron Man crashed into the room.
He had just added cream to his coffee when he saw Jan making her way back through the cabin. She paused to lean over and check on Hank, whose face was buried in the pillow, then Lieutenant Storm, who was sleeping with his head flung back and his mouth open, before speaking a few words to Natasha, who jumped to her feet with every appearance of enthusiasm and made her way through the door into the cockpit.
"She didn't ask. No, no, Steve, I'm not answering you either. So tell me, what happened to you in Asgard?"
They had turned three of the sharp bends when alarms started bellowing deafeningly all about them. At least, he took the noises like an elephant trumpeting to be alarms of some kind.
After what seemed like an age, Tony heard the soft sound of the elevator doors opening; Pepper had insisted that they make a noise and he couldn't be bothered to change that even though she had left the penthouse – and him – for good.
It didn't take him long to discover how the super-soldier popsicle had left his little wet cell. Only a short distance beyond the lab he found a cluster of dead bodies and what looked like some kind of life support gurney, though it didn't have wheels. It also seemed to have collided with the wall, which might possibly have broken the dark-shaded half-cylinder top – though that shouldn't have caused that much damage – but would certainly not have torn the restraints apart.
"Right. I can deal. Hadn't we better get on with this impromptu board meeting? I'm going to love writing the minutes, even if it is below my pay grade." Marilyn grinned happily. "Minutes of the Emergency Meeting of the Board of StarkEnergy. Location: inside an armoured truck on Grand Central Parkway. Present: Marilyn Bartowlski, secretary, and Anthony Edward Stark, Chairman and Chief Stockholder. With two out of three members present, we are quorate...."
"You would be," Steve said, with a grin, and rolled on top of him, pinning him with hands and mouth and the weight – though not the full weight -- of his body. "Let me," he whispered. "Let me do this for you."
Jarvis, who oversaw the security here as at the Tower, made sure there was no impediment to his path back into the grounds. He was walking up to the door when the AI's voice spoke into the earbud communicator that Tony had insisted he wear every time he went beyond the house.
Even a couple of weeks ago, Steve might have thought this was paranoia, but now he wasn't so sure. What was more, he didn't dare ask Tony, in case it endangered their cover. After all, he hadn't believed it possible for Tony to remain silent for more than a few minutes, yet they hadn't exchanged even a dozen words since leaving Stark Tower.
Fandral considered him carefully, then resumed his seat beside the bed. "Thor has not given me leave to speak of this, but then he has not forbidden it either. We will make a pact, the two of us. I will tell you what happened, and then you will sleep. Satisfactory?"
"We need a distraction. Leave that to me." Okoye slipped away, her bare feet making no sound on the concrete.
It was after midnight when they landed in the garage at the Malibu house, the transporter settling beside them, its grisly contents hidden behind sleek technology.
Steve was already striding towards it, and Tony followed in his wake, grumbling that, "You might at least congratulate me on being my own Q."
"Not a chance, honey. Not a chance. It's... you're so beautiful, babe. So damn wonderful. And hot. God, I want you so much. I thought I'd already proved that, but if you wanna make it a challenge I'm gonna fuck you so hard you won't be able to think, let alone doubt me."
Nor had he any doubts about who was lifting him far above the street, heading, no doubt, for the confrontation he had tried so hard to avoid.
"They kinda inherited the search. Only when they found him they listened to the shrinks, an' they messed up. It appeared Cap wasn't as good at taking orders as they thought he'd be—"
Steve stopped dead. He did not turn, but instead watched the reflection of Iron Man in the glass as he hovered inches above the stone terrace.
And the explosions and the fire had triggered another bout of flashbacks, ones that hadn't been mitigated by the conversation of the scientists, who were no longer talking in words, let alone in plain English. They seemed very excited about something, though Steve hadn't been sure what.
"Okay, but there's something I have to deal with – something I saw with Extremis when I was in Fury's office. Could you...?"
T'Challa spoke a few words in answer in a language that did not sound Wakandan – plainly a greeting – then switched to English. "This is Okoye. She is one of the Dora Milaje, my ceremonial bodyguard, and the first I appointed."
He supposed he ought to say something, but this was all too personal, his emotions too engaged. Once he started talking he wouldn't be able to stop. And Steve, if he knew him at all, was too embarrassed and horrified by his own actions to engage.
"Yes. The hands and the family aren't here right now. I went to open up the cabin and provision it myself. But are you sure you can't stay here with us, Tony? Food's likely to be better, unless your friend Steve here's your personal chef."
The Iron Man armour was travelling high above the plane carrying the Avengers to Seattle, its sensors continually scanning for a threat. Only Tony, though, knew the suit was empty, save for its own Jarvis download. He himself was in the upgraded stealth armour, heading not for Seattle but for DC. Both armours were a lot faster than any jet currently in the skies, commercial, private or military so Tony knew he could catch up with the plane carrying the Avengers and hangers-on and even swap armours before they reached their destination.
"You don't have the right evil overlord face for it. Though according to Rule 35 a goatee makes even the right face look like disaffected member of Generation X."
It took time, but he managed to reach the far side without a ducking. Thankfully, he scrambled clear of the water and into the scree accumulated downstream of the landslip.
"Not if you're still on Eastern Standard Time," Steve told him ruthlessly, steering the young man towards the door, where Danvers was waiting impatiently for it to finish opening.
Tony didn't want to answer that, but he could not stop his muscles from tensing at the reminder, or his intake of breath.
Steve pulled back to look at Tony. His face was flushed and tear-stained and he should have looked dreadful – perhaps he did, on some non-Steve scale – but Tony wanted to fuck him there and then.
Iron Man landed them both next to the limo just as a couple of SHIELD helicopters raced over the horizon. Happy was still covering Pepper with the shield, the case containing the suitcase armour at his feet, dented but unopened.
That evil tasting coffee. Sure, Jan had made it, maybe, but he bet it had been Steve's idea to dose it with sedative, and if he hadn't already been so tired he'd have spotted that he was being distracted.
"Maybe not, but you gave it willingly enough, didn't you? And you were pretty damn cosy with him and Hill at Coulson's funeral, not to mention the Wake. All that bullshit with Happy being unable to drive and me being too drunk to fly the armour – you were Fury's mouthpiece all along."
With vast tracts of the North West US and Canada and what seemed like an infinite amount of the Pacific rotating imperceptibly below him, he hovered on the repuslors and tried to stop himself shaking.
"Yeah, sorry about that. That's the way government institutions work, then and now. They followed fuckin' procedure even for Captain America. This time it's worked in your favour. You can move in here right now and Fury can't say a damn thing about it."
The two men looked at each other with identical expressions of shock and fear as they waited for the tower to collapse under their feet.
The portal snapped shut, leaving behind a trail of red – splinters of red pincers, still-waving red tentacles – and the lower half of a tortured human body, lying in a pool of blood on the parquet floor.
"I can't believe this strong silent type shtick. A New Yorker? Irish American? Never kissed the Blarney Stone while you were in Europe?"
Steve ignored this as simple distraction, folded his arms and gave Tony the benefit of his best Captain America glare. "So she's still alive. Why does she think you aren't?"
"Plenty of time." Tony was far more interested in the artefact than what was only nominally his nineteenth birthday party. Tonight was about business; contacts and networking and encouraging clients and rivals to get inadvisably drunk.
That Captain America was here was something anyone with access to You Tube might have guessed, but Hennis, or whoever had sent him, had to know that Captain America was the one and only original and, as far as Tony was aware, the only people who were actually certain of that were SHIELD and the Avengers, and these people were not SHIELD. Not Fury's style at all—
"How could you know that?" Carter asked. "You didn't... Oh, wait. Damn, I know I should have checked with Fury when he came through on that number. He didn't, did he? But the call came from his cell. How—?" Her eyes went to Tony. "You."
Pepper laughed and kissed him just behind the ear, which was really promising because she knew how much of a turn-on that was for him. So he stopped resisting and clattered down the stairs beside her, through the foyer and into the night, where the limo was parked, undoubtedly illegally.
The thought that Tony or Natasha might be coming through the door stayed Steve's hand, but all the same he dropped into a fighting stance.
This time yesterday he had been in the workshop with Tony. Acting (and Steve had no doubts about his function there) in the same capacity as one of the helper bots (but Tony loved those bots) was, in its own way, as intimate as being in bed with him.
Dr Ross looked surprised. "The Hulk hasn't smashed up Harlem again, has he? Or was it this morning's romp around Manhattan? He didn't look to cause much damage but news channel editing can be deceptive."
"I hadn't," Tony said, "but you weren't thinking straight. Sure, a dime to a dollar, Jan knows, and she'll tell Hank. Thor – who knows and approves – wasn't there and neither were Bruce and Betty, who'll be cool, anyway. Barton and Romanoff will take it in stride. T'Challa – who knows what the cultural attitudes to homosexuality are in Wakanda, though he's an Avenger and a friend. But Danvers, Shuri and Lieutenant Storm? Trust them, casually, with gossip the Press would shell out thousands to publish. And at this critical time. Nope. Not gonna happen."
It was Steve who, unexpectedly, took on the role of making sure they ate and slept, who hid Tony's whisky on bad nights and who watched over Bruce's experiments while he caught a few hours sleep, because Bruce did not trust Jarvis, let alone the bots, the way Tony did.
"Yeah." Tony pulled back to arm's length and Steve let him. Plainly, Tony was back in control of himself. "Apart from some of the weaponry. They've been reluctant to get rid of all the Hammertech rubbish, but there's something else, something I can't get to the bottom of."
Wind snatched at them but the Iron Man armour was more than equal to its power as they descended at speed into the storm. Rain clattered from the armour and from Cap's helmet, obscuring both vision and sound.
She had been isolated at UCLA, while Rhodey was in his first year out in Colorado at the Air Force Academy. Tony himself had been working with his father and travelling the world, not to mention going on duty as Iron Man.
"No, but instinct—" Steve fired, once, twice, and the suited figure swerved to one side. "— makes you turn —" He fired again as the armour honed in on them. "— if your display says a bullet's coming straight at your eyes."
He reached out to the gems, felt the links between them, the power than ran through them and through him.
"Because he was a coward," Tony said harshly. "Because he thought you were, and I quote him, 'the best and most moral man I ever met.'"
Think about something else. What had happened to upset Tony today? Was it his conversation with Bruce? Or perhaps it was letting Pepper down. Not that that wasn't an everyday occurrence.
"Hey, you!" The stocky, powerful man whose shoulder bars that seemed to make him the group's leader, called out, striding towards Okoye, who backed away, gasping something in Wakandan. The man grabbed her by the arm. "How did you get here?" he asked roughly, in a voice that held more than a trace of some Eastern European accent.
"Not that I know of," Marilyn answered promptly. "It wouldn't be valid now if he had. His will passed probate over twenty years ago."
He lowered his eyes from the sky, and met those of the Lady Sif. "Fuc—" He bit off the curse. "I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I thought all that was over. But you mustn't – I mean..." he faded out as she let him go. After all, she was an Asgardian, a god.
Okay. What now? Despite the pea-souper – a description that stabbed at his heart because he had learned it from Peggy, Peggy who had drowned in this very lake – he had to be close to the shore. Not to mention the hotel pier and the boats moored to it, but he was darned if he could see any of them. Or the lights of the hotels and houses, which had been so obvious earlier. No moon or stars to give him a direction, either. Nor could he see the glow from the fire, though he could smell smoke in the air, turning the fog into smog.
Though he knew, because he had seen it happen before, that within a day or so there would be no trace left of the injuries, the pink fading to the same creamy fairness that never seemed to tan.
Through the dreadful pain, it seemed to Steve that as blackness drew a blind over his sight, fierce eyes, green and gold with slitted black pupils, stared down into his own. Hot breath seared his skin.
"You became Iron Man at sixteen?" Despite this confirming what Howard had said, it was still difficult to believe.
As he'd been certain they would, those accusations broke Pepper's remaining control on her formidable temper. Her hands were balled at her sides and her eyes were suspiciously bright as she snarled, "Fuck you, Tony Stark! If you really believe that, check my bank account."
They were sipping their coffee when Miranda arrived. She closed the door firmly behind her, and while accepting their profuse compliments on the food, was plainly on a mission. "I have a message for you from the boss," she told Tony. "He says 'I'm grateful—'"
The woman – the Ancient One? – ignored her, keeping her eyes fixed on Tony, unperturbed. Her voice, though, was strong and full of anger. "Do you realise what you have done?"
Thor sighed and shook his head. "I hope against hope that I do not. But I fear that I what I suspect is true: that Karnilla, Queen of the Norns, is not dead, as Loki assured us, so many years ago, but hidden here on Earth, even from the eyes of Heimdall, for if he knew she lived the alarm would have been raised. As for the stone – it is as dangerous as she is, nearly as powerful as the Tesseract."
"Sorry, Cap, but I'm going in through your window." Tony had already activated the laser beam was cutting through the glass, close to the frame.
Tony knew his own name could easily have been engraved there too. Though, of course, as a consultant he might not have qualified.
For the first time, the Ancient One showed emotion, and that emotion was shock, though she covered it quickly.
With some distaste he stripped the pants from what was plainly the largest of the bodies, rinsed them out in the river, and dragged them on, wet fabric recalcitrant against equally wet skin. The tunic was wearable as it stood, though it was too tight and now had a hole where he had torn away what was plainly an identifying badge.
Steve took a deep breath and straightened his spine. "Then I guess I'd better call her. Get her on the phone for me, Jarvis."
"Stop whining, Tony," but Natasha was looking at him with unusual fondness. She frowned. "So you sent two stones to their rightful place, you have three..."
Tony hadn't spoken about this woman – whether as Rescue or Patricia or Pepper – as if she was his girlfriend.
"The new king was a young man who had spent much time abroad and he hesitated, at first, to change T'Chaka's policies. He set the Hatut Zeraze to find out how Klaw had entered Wakanda and who had sent him. In this task they failed, but reported that a very secret international agency had tried to cross our borders at the time T'Chaka was killed."
"Depends on whether she had weapons and if I had my shield," Steve said, the tension visibly beginning to leave his body. "I'm just fast and strong. She's all technique. I wish I had her training."
He tossed the buckle away from him, hearing the thud as it hit the wall, knowing it would stick there as if it had been glued. Using his weight to bear Steve to the floor, and his body to hide what he was doing with the wire, he hooked it into one of the terminals on the edge of the arc reactor, then pulled Steve's face tight into his body, just in case he was tempted to look.
"Ah, so you haven't a warrant or any evidence and while your first statement is unfortunately true, the reply to the second is 'not anymore.' Hell, wish I could say that for both." No, Tony. Keep your cool. You're going to need it. "And I'm the owner of this building, with a team of hotshot lawyers like you wouldn't believe. You want me to call them and ask how many laws you're breaking? You don't come after an AWOL soldier with lethal force! Has he committed a crime?"
Pepper rose to her feet. "I have to go, but... You're good for Tony, Steve. Most of all, you wouldn't abandon your ideals for him." Pepper kissed Steve on the cheek, which made him flush, then gathered up her belongings and left.
"Or why you overdid the hostility to Natalie Rushman, another SHIELD agent, despite having given the order to hire her. But you thought you were safe because I don't take an interest in hiring anywhere outside R&D, right? Same with the
"I owe my freedom to all three of you, so thank you," Clea said. "I did not believe an artificial creature could have such magical power. An embarrassing mistake and one I will not make again."
"You've given me exactly what I needed," Steve said. "That... that we can do this without fear of arrest almost makes this century worthwhile."
Danvers was still hesitating. "John Storm," she said, at last, as if testing them. "Stark asked me to look him up and ask him a question."
"I can understand that," Tony agreed. "But that isn't what Cap was really asking. He and I both want to know what triggered the explosion."
One or two of the agents gave him very suspicious looks indeed at that statement; they probably spoke Italian, and had much the same attitude to magic as Tony did himself. Or they had believed the WSC's propaganda about that nuke.
Tony's stomach lurched, an all too familiar feeling these days. "As far as I know he's in Nevada riding herd on a bunch of rookies."
"I'd better. I'm gonna call Jarvis and get him to send the armour here. You want it to bring your shield?"
"Round the back of the house there's a walled yard," he said. "Don't try the doors – there may be someone watching. Find the areas that can't be seen from the anywhere but the house and go over the wall. Dad will meet you."
"I am a patriot," Tony said. "But the world changed with the Chitauri invasion, Madam President. It's your job to preserve and protect the United States – and lead the free world – but I – the Avengers – can't afford that bias any longer. Stark Energy is providing a way to avert climate change before the world drowns under ice melt and the human race chokes on too much methane and CO2 and rots from cancer. I'm not going to pull back because it might damage Roxxon Oil's profits or, to be frank, put coal miners out of business when, even in the States, I'll be creating as many jobs as people are losing. I'm changing the world, and it needs to be done fast. Even now it might be too late."
The StarkIndustries hanger and private terminal at JFK airport had been there since Tony's grandfather had moved it from LaGuardia in the late 30s and Tony suspected it had never been updated; in fact, he was sure some of the mechanics had been there since then, in that they still referred to 'Idlewild'.
Tony waved Bruce to silence as the familiar voice said. "Fury here. What the hell is this about, Stark?
Tony wasn't sure he believed him anymore, but a car is a weapon in itself and a SUV more so. It wouldn't help them to crash in the middle of what appeared to be a jungle. An African jungle. Probably with resident big cats. Maybe elephants. Or bears? Did Africa have bears? Where the hell was Jarvis when he needed him?
Of course, he could ask Tony where they were going, but that might make it seem as if he didn't trust him. He wasn't going to do that because the one person he was sure about was Tony. And he was, which was strangely more difficult, learning to trust Howard.
Steve hoisted White Wolf into a fireman's lift with casual ease, and jumped down from the walkway. "I don't care what they're called. We need to secure this trio and hide them."
"Maybe thirty feet, prow to stern. A single square sail. It had a tent thing instead of a cabin, and there were no oars. Or oarsmen."
Steve stepped back. "Tony, go upstairs, shower and change," he said firmly. "Some of these conversations will have to be Skyped – I'm sorry, Stark VoIP'd," he corrected, at Tony's glare.
The Panther, now dressed in his black suit but with the facemask and hood thrown back, also wore a necklace of what appeared to be lion or leopard – panther? – fangs, laced together on a chain of glowing white metal with a faint purple tint that looked like a vibranium alloy of some kind.
"No, Pepper, it is your problem that you leased my tech to SHIELD. Are still leasing my tech to SHIELD."
From there, he could see Steve and their unexpected ally, white and black clad, fighting back to back in a deadly dance that was awe-inspiring.
When the aircraft touched down, Iron Man didn't. Instead, he continued to fly on above the taxiway, eventually leading them through the doors of a huge hangar standing wide and welcoming, light spilling out on the concrete.
"Bad memories?" she asked, and it did not occur to him until much later that it was strange she used that word instead of 'dreams'.
Trapped without cover, knowing he couldn't cover all three hundred and sixty degrees, he skittered backwards on the boot-jets, still fending off the things with his repulsors, until Steve Rogers – Captain America – was in position at his back, batting away the incoming spinning blades with his shield in a continuous fireworks display. That was only to be expected: according to his father the shield was probably capable of repelling an atomic blast.
"You left when I did," Tony went on, "and you haven't changed. So you must have been either coming back or on your way to shower when Jarvis called you to the... altercation... at the gate. That can only be seconds before he called me. Steve, you were out there for nearly four hours."
The voice was drowned as thunder boomed. Something hit the armour hard, lifting the Iron Man from the roof and sending him somersaulting wildly. His arm hit something—
"I don't care. Eat or I'll feed it to you piece by piece. Hold your nose too if I have to," he added, remembering threats from his father's butler, the original Jarvis, when he was small. To his relief, this drew a chuckle from Steve.
However, Natasha lifted a glass half-full of a colourless liquid he suspected was vodka to show him she was fine, and shook her head.
He flung himself into his chair and spun it several times before asking the question that was bothering him most. "Jarvis, where the hell is Steve anyway?"
Tony rode the elevator down to the lobby with only part of his mind listening to Jarvis's briefing; this situation was dangerous but not entirely unexpected, given what had happened in White Plains.
"Hank's is fair," Jan said. "He's around somewhere. Dr Henry Pym, possibly the world's greatest biochemist – maybe he can help."
As if by magic, a hand appeared from behind his right shoulder, offering a small cup full of liquid that gleamed amber and teased at Tony's nostrils. He took it without a word noting, as he did so, that, though the hand was gnarled with arthritis and covered in brown age spots, it was as steady as a rock. He was not surprised when, on turning, he found himself looking into a weather-battered and heavily lined face with clear gray eyes under an Army hat. The out of date dress uniform was now a little too large, but it bore a first sergeant's chevrons and an impressive array of ribbons.
Pepper had changed when he'd made her CEO, just as he'd changed after the Ten Rings had kidnapped him. After the Battle of Manhattan they'd settled into new roles but he suspected that neither of them had recognised the changes in the other until it was too late.
"Anyhow, Hank says to tell you that he thinks the Chitauri and their semi-organic tech are silicon-based, or he would think that if it were possible for silicon-based organic compounds to exist in Earth temperature ranges."
"Sure. He'd supplied me with one when I really needed it. I hate dry funerals – or anything dry come to that. Except dry Champagne. And gin. But Champagne is better for celebrating the death of your enemies. I'm really looking forward to Hammer's. D'you know if this guy really is Coulson's grandad?"
"I was lousy at being a high schooler," Tony said, defensively. "My best friends nagged me into building suits for them, the girl I had a crush on turned out to be a supervillain, and so did the boy I had something of a crush on. And I helped him gain more and more power. I lost any chance of control of Stark Industries – and Justin Hammer was ruining it anyway – so I had to found my own company to—"
"Oh. In that case, I might just be able to help. I used to be Chief Security Officer there. Of course, if you're asking me to breech security there..."
The hidden doors to Tony's private garage opened before he had even slowed the Harley to a crawl, and he parked beside a line of sports cars that looked as if they might take off and fly, all painted the most outrageous colours; scarlet and electric blue and chrome yellow. Which made the black or grey of the fleet of limousines opposite look almost odd; Steve had a sudden urge to paint pictures of Iron Man in full flight along the sides.
"It's a shield," Tony said, torn between amusement and disappointment. "Made from a vibranium alloy."
"He didn't go upstairs," Bruce said, keeping a tight grip on Iron Man's arm as they shambled forward. "He dragged me outside and was about to go back in when we saw a couple of suspicious types leap into a car and take off. He— Stop. Doors. Now, forward – down steps, Tony, be careful." It was too late to stop Tony stumbling, but this time he actually managed to keep his feet, even though he could hear rain drumming on the outside of the armour. Well, he would definitely be drier than Bruce.
"Don't you dare!" Tony retorted, struggling to his feet, but there was a part of him wishing he could remember what it was like to be lifted and carried in Steve's arms. "Coming out to share the spa with me?" he countered.
Then the man in black moved closer to Tony and spoke very softly, not in English but in German. "Both of you get into the vehicle – the Hatut Zeraze won't be alarmed. They will think White Wolf is putting me off my guard while you wait for your bodyguard. On the left of the control panel is a recessed black button. When you press it it will active an automatic pilot. You will be flown directly to Dar es Salaam, where you should be safe. There is also a cell phone that will operate there, US passports with appropriate visas, and local currency. I would advise your immediate return to America."
weird way of delivering it," Tony said. "Damn, I'm going to have to talk to Fury – and maybe the military, ASAP. So, Bruce, the thing exploded and you were startled enough to... well, to suit up in an involuntary fashion. What happened then?"
"Of course," he answered. "If it's necessary. That's why you're the moral centre of the Avengers, rather than me. But you don't need to compromise yourself. You aren't Captain America any longer. You don't need to sign the Accords."
Rhodey, in full War Machine armour, was standing ready to assist if something went wrong – he had, he had said, seen Tony's prototypes in operation before, thank you.
Jarvis said nothing, though he gave a deep, exasperated sigh, which was quite an achievement for a being with no lungs. Seconds later, the helmet was filled with Iron Maiden.
It was too much to think about. He needed coffee to boot his brain. Then, he was sure, it would all be simple once again.
Tony slumped against the wall outside the Boardroom and let out a long breath. He was exhausted and his head was pounding again and he desperately wanted a drink – but he now had two more weeks to negotiate with Pepper or find a successor.
They arrived in what was, presumably, the London Sanctum, by portal, though, as Tony remarked, at least the Ancient One was polite about asking them to step through and therefore much to be preferred to Strange's portal-side manner.
Steve remembered the hammer moving fractionally in his hand, then the doubts settling into his mind as it remained firmly on the table. He also remembered Thor's grin as he said, "Well done," to Tony. He hated that Thor could do that so easily, accepting the horrible risk Tony and Bruce had taken simply because it had worked.
Normally, on waking from such a nightmare, he would have asked Jarvis if Tony was in his workshop, and, if he was, would have made his way down to sit, watch and talk. But Jarvis did not have a presence here and, even if he had, Tony did not have a workshop or a lab.
A slim woman who was only five foot two really should not have been able to push him back so easily. "Sleep," Jan repeated. "If anyone is going to use the couch, it'll be me. You wouldn't fit. But I'm going to go help Hank.
"I was afraid of that," T'Challa said, replacing the access panel. "I will have to petition the Panther god and persuade him to let your armour into Wakanda."
"He's fixated on the super-soldier process, which makes Steve a target. After all, he's the only one it ever worked on. And, then, of course, there's your father's work."
"She kinda warned me, back at the Oklahoma base, though I think she was telling me not to take you seriously. And Thor already knows and approves. I'm not taking bets against Natasha and Clint working it out, either.”
That hurt. "Not sure about Dad," Tony said lightly. "He was sorta obsessed with you. An' he married very late. Looking for an heir, same as he expected from me."
"What exactly did happen tonight? Did the helicarrier just decide to blow up? Or was she sabotaged?"
But the terrible thing was that he had forgotten about her in Tony's arms, forgotten everything but a new and probably fleeting joy. Perhaps that was what he deserved.
Then multitudes consolidated into one – no, wait, two? – and he was whole in a way he had never been, but without any chance to rejoice or to analyse what was happening to him, he was spinning through time and space, dragging the fragile connection with him...
Steve eased his position in the front passenger seat of the battered station wagon – Tony called it an SUV – and watched the evening sunlight flickering hypnotically between the branches of the trees that flanked the road through the hills. That flicker was also getting faster as, for the first time in their journey, Tony put his foot on the gas. A quick glance up at the windshield showed eighty miles an hour on the head up display.
A motorcycle suddenly swerved across the limo's nose. Happy, caught off guard, braked a moment too late, and spun the wheel so desperately that, instead of avoiding a collision by riding the kerb, the limo fishtailed, its rear clipping a the side of a truck that had inexplicably decided to swerve across their original path, and, incidentally, slashing through a tyre. The impact shoved the limo up onto the sidewalk, sending pedestrians scattering.
"Shields up, anyway. And stay alert." Plainly, the flare and the fake engine problems had been designed to attract his attention. Tony could only admire the pilot's skill, though he was deeply suspicious of his motives.
"It matters because we cannot trust SHIELD. We cannot trust the government. We cannot trust the military. We cannot trust the Board. We're on our own, Pep. Totally on our own. "
"That little, huh? Thank God you stepped on the brakes when you did. I could have hurt you – or at least shocked you badly."
. Tony only hoped the blessing would work. "Take care, Erik," he said in response, and blasted to the skies, the transporter following in his wake.
"I never wanted that thing on my base," one of the two Air Force Colonels – Marchand presumably – growled feelingly.
The letter started, "My darling Steve," and Tony felt his stomach tense. Even if Steve didn't believe that Peggy had written or dictated the letter – or perhaps especially if he believed she hadn't – that must hurt.
He dismissed such thoughts as unimportant right now. What counted was survival. He was cold, but not as cold as he might have expected. And hungry. Ravenous, in fact. His injuries were painful but not unbearable, though they might become infected through contact with the estuary water.
There was a pattern to Tony's actions that Steve had come to recognise. To Pepper Potts, who loved Tony but, Steve was beginning to suspect, loved her work and the company as much – he hoped, for Tony's sake, that it was not more – Tony had gifted the company itself, or rather, the thing she most wanted, which was the power to run it as it needed to be run.
"My armoury." It was said in a matter-of-fact tone, with perhaps just a hint of pride but none of aggression. The young man – Stark – was watching him with interest, and no trace of fear.
"But—" But Pepper had tried to keep Natasha away from him, had told him firmly that he couldn't have her on staff, had been – damn it – jealous...
"Just so, Ms Potts. But if I have identified them correctly, this is their second attempt to access our data, and their previous targets were SI shipping documents and accounts—"
"Just remember who buys your servers – and to deploy the Mark 8 on schedule. And don't think you're fooling me, by the way, Cap," Tony added, without looking up.
Tony had been scanning for the Soul Stone since he had known it was missing. Now he made a wide gesture at the floor. "Look around you. See the splinters, and dust. That's the Soul Stone. Apparently us breaking loose destroyed it."
"It does," Happy grunted, "if you want to keep blood off your uniform. Bruising's worse. Surprised you're still movin'."
"That's what Stev— It doesn't matter. I can't give him what he wants. Or what you want, Colonel, though in your case it's because I don't know. Unless, of course, this is a fishing expedition on behalf of the military who've finally noticed my weakness for beautiful blondes."
Whatever he was lying on jerked to the right. Someone swore, low enough – or muffled enough – to be on the verge of his hearing.
That memorable morning in October, sea fog had swirled in below Stark Tower, filling the streets and lapping halfway up the sides of the skyscrapers, hiding the traffic and the people making their way cautiously along the streets below. It made Steve itch to get out his watercolours and try to capture the interplay of mist and sunlight and glass.
"I can think of a dozen reasons," Pepper told him. "Not the least of which is sheer exasperation. Now, I need to get back to my visitors. We'll talk about this later."
"You mean you haven't killed him?" Tony said, levelling the gun at White Wolf's slumped body as Steve let it drop to the earth.
"While the internal US conspiracy poses the most immediate threat and are more easily identifiable – thanks mainly to Hawkeye and the Widow – I believe the mercenary group to be far more dangerous. They have tech none of us completely understand, they almost certainly have possession two of the Chitauri war machines downed in the Battle of New Y—"
. And in doing so you pitched Barton against Widow and Wanda against Vision. You may not consider me your friend, but they—" He broke off because that wound was still too raw. "Even if you'd won, what do you think would have happened? Do you really believe the US government – the UN, the Security Council, the EU, the Chinese, the Russians, Wakanda – would have just thrown up their hands and torn up the Accords, let you and Barnes run free, even let the Avengers go on existing? You're not that fucking stupid!"
Tony dodged back out of the room, hearing the glass smash against the wall as he closed the door. Pepper really was a lousy shot.
"A fashion designer who wanted to be a biochemist and now wants to be a superhero." Hank sounded not so much angry as resigned. "In the shower, Tony. The plumbing's a tad odd, but an engineering genius ought to be able to figure it out."
They had both ended up naked, and the mutual masturbation session that followed had been satisfactory.
There was an odd, strangely stricken note in his voice as Tony said, completely against his practice. "Um – sure. Nat, could you get me a pen and pad out of the glove box, please. I'll write a personal message for your nephew, Officer...?"
"You left your cell switched off so he was tracking you via your bank account and credit cards – and you hadn't used either for nearly a month."
Steve took a flying leap that landed him on the jetty and sprinted towards the French doors. "Wait—" Tony began, but then Steve was inside, without even a glance behind him.
"I've no idea what day it is, but it looks like coming up to sunset. Right. Give me that gun and let's do this."
While T'Challa dragged the unconscious men inside and bound them securely, Tony seated himself at a terminal. Within moments, he had access to the internet, and was threading his way through his own security.
Anyhow, Thor had taken off on a personal quest; Bruce and Natasha were sharing a room which left him and Tony with the room one of the kids had vacated.
"Cap is healing nicely. As for the First Aid kit, I'll send them a dozen. Tell your boss he can be proud of them, would you, Miranda?"
"Then we'd better go back and make sure it's secure," Steve said, and someone was tugging his other arm, so it looked like his team mates had him trapped between them.
There was a long pause. Steve could imagine Tony glaring at a woman who, in his imagination, was a cross between Bette Davis and Rosalind Russell. Then Tony said, more quietly, "The ARC technology is far more important than either of us, Pep, or Stark Industries profits."
"I've also included that in the final draft of my report," Pepper replied. "Basically, that by mutual agreement we've decided I should give all my attention to Stark Industries, while you're taking personal charge of Stark Energy. Anything else is none of their concern."
Even the Mayor had arrived in the hope of seeing one of the huge obstructions moved from his streets, and with the Mayor had come half the city's financial notables and the full panoply of the media. Happily for Tony, Pepper was dealing with him and them right now.
"Sir, it is good to hear your voice," Jarvis replied. "I deployed the Mark IX the instant the aircraft on which you and Captain Rogers were travelling signed out from Kenyan ATC without giving a destination or being acknowledged. The armour has been unable to locate you."
And that was Tony, only just making himself heard over the screams, shouts and warning cries from the crowd.
"No, no, no. Him sleeping at this time of night is so exceptional we need to cherish it. It just means this call will be twenty minutes shorter."
"Jarvis," Tony said, after a moment. "Was Pepper always this cynical? Or was I simply blinded by lust?"
The drapes were drawn away  from the big windows in the living room in Tony's suite revealing a star specked sky and a lamp speckled shoreline. Two pairs of red and green navigation lights were bobbing out on the lake.
"I fear it might have been a mistake to teach Loki how to summon the Ravens," the blonde woman – Thor's mother? Frigga? – admitted.
Betty's expression was a mixture of fascination and astonishment. "How can Mr Jarvis be managing security both here and at the Tower?" she asked.
But Tony was grinning as he pulled him over to the long seat beneath the curve of window. Steve went willingly. Between relief and desire he would have done anything for Tony at this moment.
Iron Man rose to fifty thousand feet, well above the highest altitude reached by the hurricane winds, where the great swirl of cloud was reduced to what looked like nothing so much as a painting of a spiral galaxy on a blue background. And that background was beginning to darken. He could see the terminator, inching across the ocean. Soon all that would be missing were the stars themselves.
Even as he leaped forward, reaching for the handle, braced for the pain of his bare hand on metal hot enough for expansion to jam the catch, Jan left his shoulder. There was brightness in the air, a crackle of power, and the catch and lock were blown away. Steve levered the door open with the edge of his shield and grabbed the pilot by the shoulders, heaving her – if it was Danvers – out and away.
He didn't believe it. There was something disguised by the projection; who or what he couldn't say. But, right now, the only entities who had access to the program were himself and Jarvis.
"So it keeps coming back to your sister, Grimm, Richards and that damn backyard rocket that killed them."
"No." But even as he spoke, Tony's insufferable ability to calculate the odds was telling him that he was as sure as he needed to be.
Bruce laughed. "You said the spheres and their contents might be alien tech. I wasn't sure you were right, but if you were then maybe the spheres were aimed at something alien already in New York, so...?" Bruce raised his eyebrows at Tony in his best professorial manner.
," Tony grumbled. "What happened to the guy who told me something worked on 'some kind of electricity'?"
He'd told Rhodey it was a rain check. "Postponed but, yeah. I was going to call you this morning, but something came up."
Yes, he was on the shoreline, he decided, crushing the thought that this might be an island. But it wasn't an exactly helpful shoreline, and there was no way he could get ashore at this point.
"Kneel before Doom!" the robot, or whatever it was, boomed, reaching out one handed, hooking the steel gauntlet underneath the edge of a sleek sports car and, without effort, sending the vehicle rolling towards Howard, who scuttled away. The sports car hit what looked like a super-charged sports wagon, in a thunder of crushing bodywork.
Falling into old habits, he made himself a vegetable smoothie (celery, carrot and spinach made for an odd and watery combination but he was past caring) and ordered up a hamburger with all the trimmings from a – reasonably – local restaurant.
"Don't you know?" Tony found that difficult to believe. "SHIELD certainly does – well, Fury does. Phil Coulson did. So did the WSC."
Ah, that was clever, and if his previous statement had contained all the evidence he had it might have convinced him, because he wanted to be convinced. He raised his eyebrows. "And that included Fury?"
The man held up his hands, palms outwards. "Name's Tony – Tony Stark," he said in a calm, soothing voice. "They also call me 'Iron Man' though the armour isn't actually made of iron. I didn't choose the name. I know this is all very strange to you—"
"I can detect no more than severe bruising, some of which must be the result of his fight with War Machine, rather than his experiences in the Atlantic," Jarvis answered.
Now that was plain misleading. What the hell was Bruce's game here? Not that messing with Fury's head wasn't the most fun one could have without the involvement of sex or alcohol.
Tony grinned. "You'll never know for sure," he said. Then, to Steve, "I'm certain 'Peggy' would have suggested you contact her great-niece. How far were you willing to go, Carter?"
Even though Tony's strength had been enhanced by Extremis he had had to call the armour in order to lift Cap and put him to bed in a guest suite in the mansion.
to go with that line? Really?" He fought to keep his voice level. "I ought to have brought Steve, just so
"I don't need to any more. I'm in control. What do you want me to do? Have them spell out 'No Kill I' on the floor?"
"It's Whitney, isn't it?" Pepper went on. "Would it have helped if I'd dyed my hair blonde like she does?"
"There's a faint trace of gamma radiation," Iron Man said, "and the explosion has done nothing for the building's structural integrity – and damn it, Cap, stay away from that hole because I'd rather carry you down than see you end up splat on the hangar floor."
Hurriedly turning away, he busied himself watching a poker game. He'd've liked to join, but he was banned in every casino on the East Coast, plus Nevada – and probably Monte Carlo, though he hadn't checked recently – from any game where there was an advantage in counting cards. Not that he counted cards – that would have taken all the fun out of it – but they might have given him the benefit of the doubt.
Almost at once, the mists rose up and surrounded them. Above them, Jean was burning, a great bird of fire to light their passage. The red-gold light rolled off the swirling fog, revealing nothing.
"Assisting first responders. There's no intelligence, and they say this Ten Rings group isn't— hey!"
Before Steve had made up his mind to ask again where they were going, the car halted in front of heavy metal gates in a high fence following a strip of cleared forest that ran across the valley. Tony honked the horn and the gates swung open enough to let them pass, though he stopped briefly and exchanged a few words with the guard who came out of his post to greet them.
"So I guess we're stuck. Might as well enjoy ourselves while we're here." It wasn't much warning, but Tony knew how quick Steve was at picking up on the most oblique of cues, so he was confident as he reached out a hand, hooked his arm around Steve's neck and pulled him into the sort of embrace that could have only one purpose.
"Did I say that aloud? Yeah. The ARC reactor – this thing in my chest that keeps me alive – was poisoning me. It's fine now. But things sucked for a while."
He could no longer hold back tears as grief overwhelmed him. He pulled Steve's body into his arms and dropped his lips to the cool forehead where a gash from cheek to hairline showed only faint traces of blood.
"Tony, Steve. You need to know that AIM was responsible for sabotaging the arc reactor on board the helicarrier and, therefore, it was probably AIM agents who abducted Steve – so if your conscience has been troubling you about assaulting them, Steve, forget it. They're a high-tech terrorist organisation which seems to have been hiding out in Latveria. They also raided a SHIELD biological facility researching the super-soldier serum so I suspect that was where the last of Captain America's blood samples and the extracted super-soldier serum was being stored. As Fury is incandescent I presume SHIELD thinks they took those, and the research results."
It vanished, and he was still falling, onto the floor of the workshop, where he lay bereft and shivering, with the beginning of a headache pounding behind his temples.
"I'm acting as your friend, Tony. Now we're under threat from alien invaders the super-soldier technology is as vital to our defence policy as your weapons, and you're withholding both. There are going to be consequences and I won't be able to protect you."
Tony decided to answer the second question first. "Because he built what you might call a backyard rocket," he said impatiently. "He somehow persuaded a test pilot friend of his to captain it, went into orbit with a couple of other scientists along just in the time for a massive solar flare. None of them made it back."
Whether the armour's sensors picked up his movement or body heat, War Machine broke off from his search, one arm coming up, the open hand pointing directly at Tony, who flung himself towards  the shield. Still skidding on the rough ground, he snatched it up and put it between himself and War Machine, doing the mental calculations that came to Steve by instinct as ducked his head and angled it —
"Well, the Rainbow Bridge – the means of transportation to the other eight of the Nine Worlds – is now restored. As soon as this was accomplished, Thor sought leave to return to Midgard. There is—" Fandral actually twirled the ends of his moustaches "—a young Midgardian lady. Her name is Jane and she is valiant and beautiful."
He wanted so desperately to believe that his friend, his fellow adventurer – the supervillain, his father's kidnapper – had reformed.
Tony hesitated, looking at the folder as if it might bite him. He tapped it with one finger. "Is this so explosive that you needed to bring it yourself?"
Even if he hadn't known where the store was, he would have immediately spotted the location from the chaos outside, with police cars (bearing city, county and state insignia) and ambulances parked haphazardly across the pavement, and a NYPD SWAT team running in from where their truck had been parked several hundred yards away in the honking and completely stationary traffic.
"I wasn't even asked," Tony said plaintively. "But I really would like to know who built it. Because NASA certainly didn't. And there hasn't been a squeak out of Boeing or Lockheed, or Airbus or even ISRO – and no one else could even... Tell me it isn't Hammer, because, boy, you are better off out of it if Justin had anything to do with it."
Tony decided to take this in stride, and limited his reaction to a raised eyebrow and a deep breath. "How long do we have, JARVIS?" And, if his eyes were pricking with tears, he was not going to let them fall.
Which was comfortable, though surprising, considering the last thing he had seen was Steve falling...
"Then, fair trade, Pepper, I have to be Steve," he said, which made her laugh, and that was delightful.
He hoped it would take time to take effect, that the serum might have made him immune to its effects, though at the same time he was hoping that those effects would contaminate his blood, his genes, his cells so much they would not be of use to anyone, but it burned his throat, his stomach, then ran tingling down his nerves and thrust spikes into his head.
The smell of burning plastic and wire almost overwhelmed the smell of gasoline, then the robot collapsed under him.
"You don't trust me." It was absolutely forlorn. That hurt, but there was too much at stake for him to weaken, even though he was cutting ties that had once meant everything to him. Still meant more hurt than he could currently bear.
"Many things can kill. You say you were enhanced by science. Did you choose to be a soldier, or did others choose for you?"
"Then I give you permission to look for him." T'Challa shrugged, stepped up to a door which Tony hoped was not chosen at random, and submitted to the sweep of a retinal scanner.
In the workshop, the dedicated bots were just finishing stripping Tony of the armour while Steve tapped in the access code and Jarvis let him through the security wall.
"Okay, I'll give you that one but this... rush... scares me. When we started this you were all for taking things slowly."
"We can certainly aid each other," Tony said. "First, I need my armour. That means either retrieving the watch White Wolf took from me—"
And then, suddenly, it was growing larger and heavier, pushing his fingers apart. Moments later, Janet Van Dyne, clad in a blue pants suit – with ripped sleeves that were definitely not fashionable revealing the gleaming metal encasing her arms – was standing in front of him, her waist solid and warm against his palm.
Steve had been edging away from Tony and behind the Hulk. Now, he raced forward, scooped Hank up into his arms and fled back on towards the far door.
"I can't stay here," Steve said. "I will not place you in danger, Tony. This place is vulnerable. Both Loki and Ultron targeted it."
She said: "This is Anthony Stark – Iron Man – and Natasha Romanoff, sometimes known as the Black Widow, but they are not exactly the people you saw defending New York today. This afternoon, Dr Bruce Banner, who was also not exactly the Hulk, came to me from the future to borrow the Eye of Agamotto. For reasons that seemed good to me at the time, I agreed. Moments later, the Eye was returned, but at the same instant an event occurred that caused a major split in the timeline."
"She's the best person to handle it," Steve said, with an assurance he did not entirely feel. "So long as you're right about Storm."
that is true," Danvers said, "and I haven't seen any identification, mister, you are on an Air Force base, attempting to detain an Air Force officer and defying the orders of the Air Force base commander, Colonel MacTavish, and a special agent of the Secretary of the Air Force from whom he has requested assistance. Me."
"Somehow I doubt that's going to work," Tony observed grimly. Then, and it was a sign of how the drug – and maybe the alcohol – was still affecting him that he had been so slow to connect the voices with where he was, he said, "Shit, I'm an idiot. Jarvis, these people spoke a language that sounded vaguely East African. Let's check the area round those diplomatic missions."
Tony unclipped his seat belt and came to lean over his shoulder. "That's Pepper. You can't mistake that hair. Happy, plus car. And that's – oh, fuck it, that's Hill."
"A holographic projection?" Tony asked. Because there was something very familiar about it. "One of ours."
So he'd been surprised when he'd gotten the call on his cell phone – and the Howlers and the SOE sure would have loved those – about an hour ago. Even more surprisingly the call had not been from a member of SHIELD or the Avengers but from Jarvis, whose very English-sounding voice made him nostalgic for Peggy and Falsworth but who Tony Stark had said was some sort of intelligent machine. Whether or not Tony was joshing him about that, Jarvis had, most deferentially, demanded that he come to Stark Tower at once. His – its – voice had sounded almost panicked, as if a machine could be panicked.
Tony dropped his hands and stood back. "So, you have no evidence that I'm gay – no, bisexual, because you know better than anyone how much I like women – yet you accuse me of fucking my closest male friends. You're so insecure you can't believe I've been faithful to you—" And he had, if with occasional difficulty.
Tony was leafing through files, using the scanner he had borrowed from Bruce's lab to add the important pages to a thumb drive, when he heard a disapproving "Harrumph," and looked up to see Jan, arms folded and tapping one foot, watching him.
Tony was still smarting as he watched another tanker draw up beside the Gulfstream V – the only SI aircraft currently available – with a barely controlled urge to get his own hands on the rig. They would be faster through the safety checks if he did them himself, and if this mob didn't get a move on he was going to miss the meeting and Pepper was going to kill him...
Tony needed a drink – several, and badly. "Tough," he snapped. "Call for a pool car and driver. Jarvis, if anyone needs me, tell them to call Happy in the limo. I haven't decided which club or bar I'm frequenting yet." He stamped towards the elevator.
Carefully, Tony eased his phone from his pocket. The screen lit at his touch, but there was no trace of a signal.
"For that, Director, we'd have to be under your command." The amusement was back, in force. "If you should happen to discover who set that booby trap, I'd appreciate you contacting Stark Tower. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
"And when I managed to disable it, it self-destructed. I've been trying to track down who was in it – not its normal pilot, Lieutenant-Colonel James Rhodes – how it was modified and who modified it. Not to mention who sent it to kill us. Or, if Steve is right, me."
With a dreadful crack, a bolt of lightning hit exactly where they had been standing, throwing dirt and rock and concrete high into the air, and adding the reek of ozone to the smell of burnt bodies.
"And we also have a debt to pay to you," Steve said. "The more you involve the Avengers, the less you have to involve your own people.”
"This is still American soil, Stark, for all you've tried to declare independence for Stark Industries. You're not above the law. Steven Rogers is here and you
The Hulk roared and stomped, cracking the tiles and concrete. A splinter sliced through Tony's cheek, but he ignored it.
And came out onto a metal platform edged by waist-high railings. In the faint light coming through the crack he could see a rocky roof a foot or so above his head and a short flight of steps, perhaps ten feet of them, leading downwards into – what? A cave? An underground lab? A missile silo?
"Or disintegrated." But Tony didn't believe it. His luck was never that good. "Okay, Jarvis, by tonight I want our own twenty-four hour camera surveillance on all the downed Chitauri troop carriers."
"A mugging that took a chunk out of the perimeter wall? And left smoke rising on the other side in the grounds?"
"Of course we did. And found nothing. Nor, from the expressions on their faces, were they expecting it." She was frowning. "And if it was treachery, that implies conspiracy, and I do not believe that is feasible. No one could have planned for this."
"What the fuck is that?" Danvers howled, even as she sent the SI jet screaming low across the expanse of the Travis airbase with the tower screaming for her to abort.
"Well, that explains why SHIELD were waiting for us here," Clint said wryly. "Nat spoke to her when we were trying to contact you, see if you could aid us in coming in."
Steve looked at the envelope in his hand as if he had never seen it before. His back was stiff. "This came in the mail. It's been forwarded from the Brooklyn apartment – by SHIELD, I suppose."
