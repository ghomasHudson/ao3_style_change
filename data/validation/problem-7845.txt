he’d say, before Tony finally gave in.
Tony thins his eyes at the man for what has to be the third time in the past half-hour. “It isn’t a dildo. It is a healing amulet–”
Steve’s belly betrays him, grumbling at the sight of crispy meat as his nose samples the savory scent wafting towards him.
going to let them get away with this?”
“We’re not staying married. That’s not an option.”
“Where’s your mother?” Dad asks, undeterred, before calling out. “Maria? Maria!”
“No, but being a jerk is.” It’s catching already.
“Do you feel their concern is unwarranted?”
Romula viros mule trecentos = Romula… thousands of men
“…Yes,” Tony says, scooting over as Steve takes his seat beside him.
“You’re saying you want
Steve still maintained the fucker deserved it the first time, though.
Steve ignores them both to inquire “…Did it feel nice?”
The buyer’s face darkens. “Am I supposed to take your word for it?”
It is not long after that Antony suggests making their arrangement more permanent.
They only get as far as DC before Howard summons them back. He had talked to President Wiesner, promised MIT a new library wing or whatnot to allow Tony back that very semester. Tony had thought he had caused enough property damage to earn himself the semester off, but he had made a slight miscalculation. He either underestimated the amount of hush money Howard is willing to pay to make certain indiscretions disappear or overestimated the president’s pride. It’s disappointing, but he supposes every man has his price.
“Not really.”
“Shame you never really took to Oina like your father.”
“But the deaths? The hauntings?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who?”
Tiberius smiles in a knowing fashion. “Are you feeling unwell?”
Doesn’t matter. It’s his house now, and he makes the rules, which means no early birds before 2pm. At least. He’ll tell Steve after what’s-her-name leaves. Speaking of… why is she still here? One of these days, he’ll hire a personal assistant to see his “dates” out. That will save him from any awkward goodbyes and mumbled half-truths about calling them later. If he pays enough, maybe this hypothetical PA will even overlook that it’s not entirely appropriate to ask an employee to escort out emotionally-vulnerable personal acquaintances in various states of undress.
Percival rounds on the man, punching him in the arm. “A pox on you and your house! I am the best shot here, you ass!”
Steve is quiet for a beat, then: “You know if you need anything–”
But Antony isn’t looking at his face anymore, his gaze lowered to the four purple bruises on either side of his pale hips in the shape of fingers. They appear almost black in the low light.
There’s nothing to do but talk. However, even knowing the reason is likely boredom, Steve finds the Mandalorian to be particularly chatty.
Steve hears Tony suck in a breath beside him, but he pays no heed, too distracted by the five empty nooses at the end and how a couple of the extant corpses look… nibbled upon.
“We all must make do with our lot in life.”
“Yeah… and um… well, how’s Steve handling it?”
Pepper comes to the door as they are about to land. She’s dressed in a sharp light-colored suit and blouse with a matching cloche hat, her heels tapping impatiently as she waits for Tony to crack open the door. He’s wearing little more than a robe with wrinkled lounge pants and slippers peeking out the bottom.
Unsure of himself, Stefanus steps closer. “And where do you want me, Antony?”
“And what do we have here?” the rich man says as he circles Suibne, his hands slipping over his hips down to cup his ass. Suibne jerks away at the touch, but the slaver pulls on his lease in warning to stand still. “Why the cap?”
“You don’t,” Tony insists. “When it’s just the two of us, you don’t talk nothing about girls. It’s superheroes and Danger Mouse and whether vanilla is better than chocolate – which it is
Fidelis can only sigh in exasperation, pinching the bridge of his nose to massage the space there with thumb and forefinger. “For the love of the gods, boy. Just win. The collegia retiarii already has to dispense the funds for one memorial today. Try not to tax our financial reserves by dying.”
“All your clothes,” Purple Man prompts him when Rogers stops short of full nudity. He hooks a pair of thumbs into his underwear then slides them off as well. He stands before them then, stoic, unmoving, his eyes vacant and glazed over purple.
“No…” Steve says as he rubs the back of his neck. “I’m just saying it’s different is all.”
The only thing that will make him feel better is for Tony to suddenly become a different person entirely.
Stefanus is pounding into him now, his own breathing turning labored as he mouths at Antony’s jawline, his tongue dragging across the skin there. Antony can feel the cool clamminess of his skin, smell the combined sweat of their bodies musky in the air, and when Stefanus slides in at just the right angle over and over, sparking pleasure along his spine, Antony muffles his shout into the man’s shoulder and comes, painting the space between their bodies white. As he descends from his euphoric headspace, he vaguely registers Stefanus speeding up before his body becomes rigid as well and his motions jerky, as he spills into Antony himself. He then collapses to the side, slipping out of Antony before he’s even soft, as if he had feared Antony wouldn’t have allowed him to finish once he had come.
Suibne bristles beside him and turns away resolutely, digging his spoon into his rations and nearly inhaling the contents so as to be allowed to leave the mess hall faster.
“It’s not.”
Steve can only hum his agreement.
It is.
when you grow a full beard. The five patchy pubic hairs you pasted to your chin don’t count. Until then, go to sleep, or I’ll pluck each one while you doze at midday on the morrow.”
“I need to know,” Steve insists. “If it was Rhodey, wouldn’t you want to know?”
After they return to the villa and Antony has directed him to place the amphora in the bath angled just so to allow optimal viewing of the painting from the tub, Stefanus draws them a bath to wash away the grime of both the city streets and Antony’s run-in with Servilius.
He rolls his eyes. “That’s why it won’t count. Duh.”
As if reading his mind, Steve calls out from the kitchen. “I just moved in a couple weeks ago. I’m still getting situated. It’s not a permanent set-up.”
“Don’t lie.” Purple Man doesn’t know why he even tries. Stark’s wasting his breath, what little he allows him anyway. He straightens up. “I don’t have time for this. Captain?” Rogers looks to Purple Man. “Strip.”
They talk on the helicarrier ride home, strapped down beside each other in the cargo area.
“Oh hey, so your bed’s being delivered today. I hope you got all the sheets and pillows off the old one,” Stark greets him as he pours a second mug of coffee for Steve and slides it across the counter.
And now, here they are saddled with a baby, and it’s all Tony’s fault.
“I made the shield myself,” he tells Steve one day in the training room.
“Yeah, yeah I do. It can be hard, and I’m glad you’re trying to get better. Proud of you, man.”
Stark turns around to casually lean against the counter. “What do you mean?”
“Relax, why don’t you?” Purple Man tells Rogers, and his body visibly slackens as if he is a marionette whose strings have been severed.
“Tony? Hey, Tony,” Cap is murmuring as he pats his arm. “You gave us quite a scare back there. Clint just left, and Bruce and Nat went to get lunch. Pepper’s here, and Rhodes came by, but uh… she’s talking to the doctors, and Rhodes had to go to the Triskelion, but he’ll be back later this evening.”
It could be a result of sparring. Perhaps Stark had pulled an (ass) muscle while wrestling Steve. Fully clothed. In the gym. Just a traditional match between two buddies, two colleagues. Mano a mano. Platonically-speaking.
“I do not think there is much risk of that.”
Tony flops down on his pillow with a dramatic sigh. “Does your libido ever quit? Tell you what: Give me a couple days – a week tops – and I’ll join you in a broom closet somewhere for a couple rounds of ‘I’m not dead’ sex. Should be life-affirming, you know. A good time had by all.” They can iron out the details later, what this means for the two of them, for the Avengers as a whole. Is this an HR violation? It feels like one. Will they have to disclose their ‘relationship’ to the one-eyed wonder? Then again, he probably already knows, the nosy bastard.
“Wait,” Tony holds up his hand, causing Steve pause. “There’s a dance coming up next month. Do you want to go with me?”
“You’re right, Cap…”
He sets out early the next morning for the ludus, aiming to acquire the services of the secutor that had so enchanted him in the arena. He passes through familiar streets, reading his favorite risqué graffiti and finding new ones from the night prior.
Tony bites Steve’s bottom lip hard enough to draw blood.
“There’s a first time for everything.” Tony places Steve’s hand on his own shoulder while snaking his own to cup Steve’s back. He then grabs Steve’s other hand. “Besides, I’m the one who took the initiative to ask. I think that entitles me to assume the leadership role.”
“I’ve got something for you, but I am uncertain whether you will like it,” Antony tells him one day when Stefanus has come early to his bed chambers, ready to escort him to yet another social call on behalf of his father’s campaign.
It’s everything he has ever wanted and more. Tony turns away, blinks the tears from his eyes, and Steve holds him, careful of their sleeping baby.
“You should stop taking everything so personally.”
Steve thinks with a distinct sense of displeasure.
“Yeah, and if you kept to your weight class, maybe you’d even have a shot,” he quips. Steve was always the type to bite off more than he could chew, throwing himself headfirst into fights he couldn’t possibly win like a rabid Chihuahua. He wasn’t going to take down anyone nipping at their ankles, but he’d make sure his opponent regretted whatever they did to set him off.
He’s already sick, been sick for months, and he knows with a grim sort of clarity that he is going to die. He has no one to blame but himself. His carefully-cultivated acerbic personality, his general cynicism and promiscuity as well as any promises he’d made to himself once he discovered his genetic predisposition, all of it didn’t stop him from falling in love with Steve “Captain America” Rogers.
“And you’re not even curious about what you’re missing?” Stark presses.
Stefanus sits up, leans forward towards the other man. “I do care for you, Antony, whatever you think my motivations were, that has always been true. It is still true even now that I am free and have a choice in the matter.”
In some ways, Steve regrets it. He regrets not leaving Tony behind in the settlement where he can be safe with the others, where he doesn’t have to deal with the things the Avengers must do every day. Tony is not soft but not exactly suited for this life either, at least not yet and maybe not ever. Only time will tell…
“Depends; is it working?”
“How old is he supposed to be?”
“No, of course I can’t turn invisible.”
“What?”
Tony hadn’t even considered the money a loan. “If you can’t pay me back, I’m not planning to hire an enforcer to break your kneecaps, Cap,” he replies, playfully stealing a french fry from Steve’s plate.
S-A-F-E, a pause, Y-O-U-?
Steve extends his hand for a shake before he can even register the name, but when he does, his brow rises. “Frank?”
Pathicus: An adult man who bottoms (for either men or women), but is more manly in presentation than a cinaedus.
It won’t be enough, unfortunately.
Steve tries to imagine what
“I said lie down.”
“Make yourself at home.” Steve opens his refrigerator in his mini-kitchen. “I’ve got… well, I’ve got milk. I could make some cocoa if you’d like.”
Tony wipes his face, scrubbing his chin last before folding it up and discarding it on the side of the vanity. “Yeah, well… it is what it is.” He flushes the toilet. “Now, what was it you were all fired up about?”
Could he walk away now? After everything they had shared?
“Okay, here’s what I never understood about the Jedi. You live your whole lives from the age of three on up always training and studying to be these super-charged knights only to never get laid,” Stark is prattling on. “How does that make any sense? You could be sex symbols across the galaxy instead of the eunuchs you are.”
Steve holds his new position. “Why do you say that?”
“You give yourself to me because you must, but you would freely choose Bacchus if you could,” he murmurs, reaching down to lightly cup Stefanus’s cock. “Do you use this when you’re with him?” Antony gives him a stroke, but Stefanus is cold to it, pointedly looking away from the man standing before him violating his body. Antony must find his response unsatisfactory because he reaches around, grabbing the meat of his ass. “Or does he get to touch you here?” Stefanus holds still, stubbornly refusing the react.
“…Anymore,” Tony amends.
The fucking irony of it all.
It happens again.
“I just don’t understand how this could have happened.”
But Steve insists, “Stay.”
Hadrianus sponsors the next Gladiatorial Games to boost his popularity, hiring Priscus’s ludus to supply gladiators and choosing Stefanus to fight a highly-successful retiarius for the main bout. Antony worries his father will take the opportunity to execute Stefanus and arranges for his seasoned competitor to be unavailable.
“Master Erskine–”
“I think there has been a mistake–”
“What did you think about the parbit? You liked those, right? I was thinking of maybe pairing them with a kebab of those weird fruits you found.”
“Do you now?”
“I must have left it at home seeing as how we needed to make room in the private jet for your extra swim briefs,” Steve replies, unzipping his duffle bag. “Now be serious; we have a job to do.”
This isn’t working.
“No.”
“It’s not happening again,” Tony repeats, with all the conviction of a man fully in charge of his mental faculties, of his urges and desires. A man of action, of spotless integrity…
“…Yes?”
An explanation of the clothes Stefanus wears is in the next chapter, but basically, it’s the outfit of a freeborn boy under 15 or 16, and Priscus is an uncomfortably dirty old man. Age-wise, Stefanus is borderline to maybe a little older than that, and as a slave, he would be considered available for sex at younger ages, but basically, it’s a disturbing (though not uncommon at the time) fantasy nonetheless.
Tony bats Steve even as he blushes at the observation. He knew he should have shaved before heading home.
Stark sits back. “Thank you, Steve.”
For his part, Steve is having way too much fun with their discovery. “Maybe if we’re lucky, we can find his royal highness’s collection of ruby butt plugs.”
But that was before he had come across the location of the tomb of Pharaoh Ramesses VIII, the final resting place of the Golden Rod of Destiny. Passed down from his father, the storied Ramesses III, the last great monarch of the New Kingdom, legend had it that the Golden Rod could cure all matter of ailments (except, of course, assassination). It was a long-shot, but the pull of yet another healing artifact proved too great for Tony to ignore. And so, he had phoned his long-time friend and former temporary assistant, James Rhodes, shortly after the man had settled into his role heading the Paris branch of Stark Industries.
“…Yes?”
“Does it make you feel any better?”
“Maybe we can iron out the details on the way home?” Steve suggests, his fingers interlacing with Tony’s.
“No need to be a dick about it. I was just asking a question.”
“Not really, no.” Tony had lost it on a stranger’s bed at a frat party first chance he got. “But you know what? It’s your decision.”
Tony had gotten as far as dialing the first six numbers, but he always hung up before the seventh. He doesn’t even know what he’d say: that he’s sorry, that he wants Steve back in any capacity he is willing to give him… that he’d like to know if Steve still loves him?
When Tony slowly comes to, he’s in a private hospital room, hooked up to several monitoring machines. There’s a rhythmic beeping under lied by the soft buzz of florescent lights. He is dressed in an oversized backless hospital gown, washed hundreds of times to worn softness and tucked under several layers of hospital sheets. His throat is scratchy and his breathing shallow and pained, and he gasps slightly upon waking, startling the lone visitor at his bedside.
“You beg so pretty,” Tony says, giving him a stroke, causing Steve to shudder and clench around his buried fingers. “And your hole is so tight. I’d love to take it for a spin.” Steve groans at the thought. “Maybe next time,” Tony adds with some regret. The way Steve’s ass is rippling around his fingers would feel amazing on his dick. “But I think I promised you something else, hm?”
Antony withdraws, steps away.
Had this always been the plan? Had Antony lied to him, manipulated Stefanus into thinking there was ever a chance both he and Bacchus could walk out alive then convincing his father to let him deal the final blow should Stefanus win?
“I suppose not,” Purple Man concedes, resting his cheek on a closed fist in boredom. “I never made my G.I. Joes have sex as a boy.” He angles his head to look at Rogers’s face in curiosity. The man’s eyes are closed, his jaw tight and squared, teeth indenting his bottom lip in what might be either pain or pleasure. It’s hard to say when the only noise is the squelch of wet fingers and Tony’s muffled cries.
Tony stops, considers it. “…I s’pose you’re right.”
“You’ve got to be kidding me!” The Mandalorian – Stark – shouts as he hurries the last few yards to his ship. He picks up some debris outside, rushing in where there are further shouts of disbelief and rage as he releases an impressive bevy of curses, only half of which Steve is familiar.
Michelle doesn’t seem to understand that.
Steve is not going down so easily, and now that the number of his opponents is down to one, he estimates he has at least an even chance of survival.
It’s a hard line for Tony, one of the few dealbreakers he’s had in all his liaisons, no matter how fucked up he got.
to the suggestion.”
Tony crosses his arms and rolls his eyes, hiding his hurt at the confirmation of his suspicions. “Six weeks, so you can relax already. You’re not my baby daddy, Cap.” It’s not like he was expecting Cap to be happy about it, but seeing the man’s abject terror at the possibility he may have spawned with
And just like that, Tony’s first kiss is gone and done. He’s elated and fluttery inside, maybe even a touch shy as he glances over at the other boy who is studiously trying not to look in his direction. It was kind of nice, a little sweet even. Maybe–
Tony’s eyes widen; his nostrils flare. “Get out.”
…It is exponentially worse when news of his romantic exploits and proclivities reach Hadrianus.
“Jedi can employ this persuasion technique to compel others to do something or convince them of… of alternative realities,” Steve explains, “but I’ve never been very good at it and never with more than one person at a time.” That was the downside of always solving his problems with his fists, the gentle art of persuasion (or mind-fuckery as some of the other Initiates would call it) is almost completely lost on him.
“Why should I trust you? The Mandalorians are sworn enemies of the Jedi.”
Stefanus doesn’t follow. “Dominus?” he prompts again.
“Mr. Stark,” a young man – one of his contractors – interjects, “if you could sign off on our work–”
“I am worried about you, Antony,” Romulus had said once when he had noticed Antony had dropped considerable weight in an effort to maintain Tiberius’s boyish ideal.
“Alright,” Tony tentatively agrees, picking up their plates and silverware. “I’ll be in the kitchen, washing the dishes when you need me.”
“Oh gods, Stefanus,” he cries out. “Harder, harder… Fuck! Oh fuck!”
Stefanus can take the hint. He divests himself of his own belted tunic, folding it to place on the floor as before.
Rhodey takes one look at Steve and rolls his eyes. “Really, Tones? Not him too,” he huffs.
It’s a convenient, if concerning, declaration, with the underlying insinuation that the boy wouldn’t be tracked or missed should he disappear onto an outgoing ship.
easier anyway, until Tony makes the mistake of bringing home a man.
…Horrified?
It’s going so well that Steve invites Tony to his old neighborhood to meet his other friends, including the infamous Bucky Barnes.
Oh… Bucky thought, but no. No, that’s not possible. Steve hadn’t done anything yet, least of all with Tony Stark.
Steve crouches in the grass and peers through binoculars to assess the target: a dilapidated Home Depot in the middle distance, a large S.O.S. comprised of weighed-down faded orange buckets peeking out of an overgrown rooftop garden. He lowers his gaze to view the front entrance, clearly barred from the inside, wooden slats clearly visible through the shattered sliding doors. The parking lot is full of copious amounts of immobile desiccated zombies, having long dried out in the California sun. A few still amble around aimlessly, stumbling between busted-up cars and the corpses of their brethren.
Master Phillips had told him in their very last conversation.
And when Tiberius turns his smile towards Antony, it feels like the sun itself with how it warms him up inside. The beard is such a small thing in the long run, and shaving will make his lover happy. He has all the time in the world to grow one when they are older and Tiberius gets used to his own scruff, he thinks.
Steve isn’t convinced. “Thanks for coming home, Tony. I really appreciate it.”
“I will
“Why do I have to wait at all?”
Antony nods. “See to it that you don’t.”
Suibne kicks him.
So, Tony had gotten around with a lot of people in his social circle.
He presents it to the group. “That meat grinder Tony was going on about,” he replies, holding it out to Tony. “Found it in the back. Maybe now we can finally put your crazy-ass obsession to rest.”
Bruce scoots over to make room for Steve, who sits between him and Nat to plug in.
They’ve never gone to the same school, but Steve will be starting sophomore year of high school while Tony will be matriculating into college. It’s a completely different stage of life. Steve must feel like Tony is abandoning him.
No, not that backdoor. Shut up.
Steve looks around; the gala is clearly not over.
He should never have called.
“What do you think you’re doing, Master Erskine?” Master Phillips balks, scowling at the man, refusing to so much as acknowledge his new charge.
Cap waffles for a moment longer and then exits the lab. Tony slows, puts down his tools, pushes back from the Iron Man armor, and massages his forehead with both hands. He breathes out slow and steady.
“Mm hm.”
“Just booting it up,” Tony tells them. “It’s a little slow. I’m working on optimizing reaction time.” When the interface sparks into something he recognizes, he forms a fist and twists before straightening his arms to his sides. “J, the door,” he orders, just as the glass door slides open and Iron Man flies into the living room, coming to a stop just above and behind Tony to hover.
Tony shoulders slump at the gentle censure.
Steve can do that.
“Yeah, I’m right. Now, you’re going to bed,” Rhodey unplugs the phone before grabbing an extra pillow and blanket for Tony to sleep on the couch.
“Whoa. That’s a very personal question. Boundaries much?”
And what of Bacchus?
Stefanus looks down at his stomach then at the matching smear over Antony’s. “I can clean that up, Dominus,” he says, quickly rising from the bed in search of a cloth.
“No can do, buddy. I’m sorry.”
“The mission is a bust. It’s been six days, and no one has approached us. Perhaps Fury’s intel isn’t as good as he thinks, but I’ve got only a couple years left, tops – not all of them good, mind you – and I’m not going to spend it feeling sorry for myself. It’s one of the few luxuries I can ill-afford.”
Roman money is as follows:
“I see you left my son to clean up on his own,” he comments, his chin tipped up so he can peer down his nose at the taller man. “Is that a common occurrence?”
“I thought we were celebrating. Twelve weeks and I’ll be out of your hair for good.” Tony downs the rest of his glass. No point in letting scotch go to waste. He still pulls a face; just because a vintage is old and famous, doesn’t make it any good. Speaking of… “Don’t you have a boat to catch? The waves may not have scattered all his bones yet. You might be lucky enough to find a femur this time.”
“Behave or your dominus will have you castrated,” the man had threatened before roughly pulling a cap over the crown of Suibne’s head.
“So, you’re running?”
Steve mulls it over. “…I still say it’s a dildo.”
“Now that we understand each other: Where is he?”
They had covered the how in fifth grade health class. Two people wish for a baby deep down to their very core, and one is willed into existence.
Stefanus steps over the threshold, allowing Antony to close the door behind him. By the time Antony turns around, Stefanus has already untied his belted sash and is working on his tunic.
“As you say, it is an election year,” Antony reasons, “and I do not like the look of Hadrianus’s opposition. Harm may befall me on one of my many social outings to
Tony looks disappointed but understanding. “They’re in the toiletry bag alongside the lube,” he repeats.
And so, by the time he has dressed and stretched a bit to work out his sore muscles, he exits the ship’s sleeping quarters to find Stark, who is already situated in the common area of the ship discussing something with Rhodey in hushed tones.
The guys graduate high school that summer – Steve and Bucky and all of them – and scatter shortly after as they enter the next phase of their lives. Bucky and Dum Dum enlist in the army after graduation, while Jim goes to technical school. Jacques becomes a plumber’s apprentice. Pinky gets a job at his stepfather’s grocery store, and Gabe attends community college while hoping to transfer to a SUNY later.
Steve grimaces and pushes him face-first into the pillow, his hand firmly planted on the back of his neck. “Quiet. No talking,” he orders. He picks up the pace, fucking into the man with reckless abandon, his expression pinched and eyes squeezed shut against the swell of memories, tears leaking at the corner of his eyes and mingling with beads of sweat dripping down his cheeks.
“He’s not my friend,” Steven mumbles, not quite looking at the man.
Steve is not fine. Tony knows it, and Tony is pretty sure Bucky knows it. He can see it in the slight tremor of Steve’s hands, in the way his eyes are level with everyone’s shoes, in the low haunch of his shoulders.
She rushes past him before he can so much as say ‘hello.’
The man seems to accept the excuse, pulling his tunic up and over his head to reveal…
They have to hold him down as the slaver accepts Priscus’s iron brand of ownership, heats it in the forge in the back, then presses a stylized ASPS into the arch from thumb to forefinger of Suibne’s right hand. The boy cries out then as the slaver holds the brand for a touch longer than necessary, and the white-hot fire along Suibne’s nerves fails to abate even when he pulls it away so the new wound can be washed with a healing salve and a bandage applied. Suibne wriggles his fingers to stretch the tortured muscles and ligaments, thinking of the permanence of Priscus’s brand on his skin and wincing at the burn. Even if he were to escape, he will never be free of it.
“Abstaining from sex when you’re unattached isn’t necessarily ‘the right thing,’” Tony points out, complete with air quotes. “Hell, if I looked like you with your super-soldier stamina, it would be a revolving door of partners. I don’t know if I’d even bother wearing clothes. Or underwear. It would be silk robes, day in, day out.”
Shows what Steve knows. Tony has a month’s supply of cocktail garnishes secreted away in his personal stash. Steve would probably make that face again if he mentioned that, the one where he pouted and drew his brows together. Tony hated that face, but mostly he hated disappointing Steve.
Stark is still for a long moment. Steve is uncertain whether he’s mulling it over or just mulishly standing his ground – it’s so hard to tell when all he can see is an impassive mask – but his plea must work because the Mandalorian steps aside.
“I’m just curious is all,” he replies. “I’ve heard that Jedi are able to move things with their mind. Telekinesis. My hypothesis is that it’s a load of bullshit, just something that got exaggerated, like when they say vornskr can shoot fire from their mouths when their breath is just hot and their sting deadly enough that no man has survived it. Maybe someone saw a Jedi throw a moderately-sized rock one day and then it became a boulder in the retelling and later still, it was said to have been thrown using telekinesis. That sort of thing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It is not done.”
“It’s from Britannia,” Antony says. “The shape is more like that of a hoplomachus shield though it be sized like that of a secutor, but I thought considering your history, perhaps you’d feel more at home with something like this.”
Steve had wanted to meet Tony’s family for months now, but his boyfriend had always demurred. And now, faced with the inevitability of Steve finally meeting his father, Tony only rolls heel-toe then back again, staring hard at the door. “You know, there’s a Burger King about five miles down the road. We don’t have to do this.”
“My pleasure,
“Nothing?” His father looks like he’d very much like to hit her but refrains. “You call this” – he holds up Tony’s Xerox packet – “nothing?”
Few would understand.
Stefanus’s eyes flutter open, his mind sluggish to return. “Dominus?”
Tony pats Steve’s shoulders before dropping his arms entirely to pick up his backpack while Jarvis collects the rest of his things. “See you at Christmas, or… you know, earlier if you’re in the Boston area.” He turns to leave.
Tony snorts. “You look like you’re a pro at that.” But Steve says nothing in response as he withdraws his hand then lifts Tony up and sheaths him on his dick with Tony’s thighs draped over his arms as he pumps him up and down. Tony can only circle his arms around Steve’s shoulders for leverage, moaning and holding him close as Steve uses him.
.” He spits out the last word like a cuss.
“I was only pointing out the obvious. Look at you. You have to know what you look like, what you are. You’re going to fail out of the Order after the Initiate Trials anyway. I don’t know why they even bothered admitting you.”
As Tony had predicted, Marvels accepts his proposal for a special issue of “Tony Stark Adventures” sending over his most recent chronicler, Pepper Potts writing under the pseudonym Frank Finley, to produce the feature.
He chuckles at the
“Captain America,” Steve states with no hesitation, not even a hint of doubt as to the pertinence of such a name.
“Oh come now, Tony. What did I say about lying? It is rather unbecoming of a superhero.”
“Steve?” Stark hesitates, suddenly concerned.
“Yeah, yeah… how much longer do I got, J?”
He crosses his arms, steeling himself against Tony’s infamous determination. “I worked hard to get where I am. I’m not blowing it on a prank.”
“…Can I play?”
And so by the time Howard calls their hotel room and very sternly orders Tony back to MIT, Tony wants to tell him to fuck off, that he’s not done finding himself yet (AKA he hasn’t gotten Steve laid).
Tony strokes Sparky’s snout, encouraging her to “Go on ahead. I’ll catch up with you in the apple orchard. You deserve it.” He then turns to address Steve, “So, uh… is that why you were acting so weird? You thought I had gotten some, and wanted pointers or something?”
Tony only rolls his eyes and sighs. “Don’t tell me you’re still saving yourself for Peggy Carter.” He can’t possibly still be holding a torch for her after nearly a decade of little to no contact.
“…You know it’s nothing to be ashamed of. You’re attractive and single. It happens.”
“It’s fine, Tony. Really,” Steve replies, even as his eyebrow twitches and the grip on his glass tightens. “I am aware you’ve had other partners, and what’s passed is the past. I’m not going to hold anything against you.”
Probably not. With how close they are, that had the same chance of happening as him and Bucky, for Chrissakes. Plus, Steve is pretty sure Rhodes is straight.
“No, of course I don’t think that,” Steve states, a touch miffed. “It’s because it’s you. I’ll never be satisfied with one night. I just can’t, okay? I want something you’re not ready to give me, not now, maybe not ever, and that’s okay. You’ve done nothing wrong, and I don’t expect… You’re not obligated to do anything. Really. It’s my issue to deal with and mine alone. But it means I’d rather not start anything at all with you if it’s only going to be a one-off.” He tosses a new six-pack of socks onto the top of his other clothes and zips up his duffle bag.
He eventually finds Tony in a windowless cement cell on the far end of the building, handcuffed to a chair, a little battered but otherwise whole.
Tony rolls over to face away from Steve. He lifts an arm, rolling his hand at the wrist. “Yeah, you’re probably bored anyway. Might as well cut our losses.”
Rhodey shows up early the next morning with a lift and a change of clothes to help Steve blend in.
require sex or much of anything really in exchange. And this is a problem because…”
Tony snorts. It’s clearly an innocent (albeit hilarious) butchering of ‘eat out together.’ The fridge is empty, having been cleared out by Banner during one of his high-metabolism-induced binges earlier that afternoon, and Steve is perusing Yelp; he clearly means they should go out for dinner. It’s not like the guy is caught up on current sexual lingo.
“Anyone but Channing Tatum,” she replies.
Priscus’s eyes positively sparkle with a knowing sort of look. “Oh yes, that one. He is quite popular, especially after his rousing performance yesterday. I have had many inquiries for his unique skill set.”
“Then that settles it.” He reaches for his coin purse.
“But I wish to continue our relationship without the bonds of ownership,” Stefanus says, his voice low as he strokes Antony’s thigh fondly. “I wish to be free.”
“You are free to leave as are your friends.”
The name catches his attention. “You know who I am?”
“What of it? He is taller than Master Yoda,” Master Erskine replies, being deliberately obtuse.
“Really? I have the same thing, except mine are superheroes,” Tony shows Steve his set-up. “Welcome to Stark-tropolis, home of the Avengers.” He picks up each minifigure, excitedly introducing them to Steve in turn. He holds up a red-head wearing black. “This is ex-KGB assassin Natasha Romanov, named after that princess who went missing after the commies killed her family…” then a man wearing glasses and a lab coat “and this is Bruce Banner. He’s a super smart biologist, but he has anger issues and transforms into a big unstoppable green monster when upset.” He picks up a minifigure he scavenged from a rare Norse mythology set he got in Norway – “And this is Thor, God of Thunder, maybe you’ve heard of him; he was kicked out of Asgard by his dad for being too much of a smart-ass” – followed by another he had taken from an old limited-edition Robin Hood set. He had painted this figure purple as it used to be his favorite color, but now he has regrets considering the poor guy no longer blended into Sherwood Forest. “And this is Hawkeye. He’s an expert marksman and spy. He talks constantly, never shuts up really.”
“That’s a recent development.”
“Oh come on, Buck. You know me better than that.”
“It isn’t about what we deserve,” Aemilius heaves, his voice hoarse with fear or from the near strangulation, Stefanus is unsure. Aemilius clasps the victor’s thigh and presents his neck as he has been trained to do. “Uri, Vinciri, Verberari Ferroque Necari… this was always the way it was going to end. For all of us. Eventually.”
“How do you figure that? Tony. You’re dying. You’ve been dying for months now, and no one knew. Not Pepper, not any of us.”
“I’m fine.”
Is this punishment for an imagined slight, for Stefanus’s refusal to give up Bacchus when he had the chance? And now, he must kill him after all. The betrayal, the deception, tastes of ash in his mouth.
The sharks circle – “Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark!” – until Tony acknowledges one of them.
Latrunculi: Ancient Roman strategy game
“What?”
“Does it still hurt?” he whispers. He knows what he felt, the edges of rather extensive scarring spiderwebbing from the center of Stark’s chest. They feel old, puffed in some places, stiff and tight in others.
“I might do that anyway. It would be more comfortable than bedding down next to you.”
Tony looks Steve in the eye, his line of sight hovering a good six inches higher than he had anticipated. “You grew,” he says after a beat.
Tony can feel his face burn as he bats off Steve’s touch. “Yeah well, it toughened me up, taught me independence. I don’t have to lean on others when I can rely on my own intellect and ability.”
Tony wakes up the morning after, bleary-eyed and aching with a stale taste in his mouth. He looks over and sees that yes, Cap is snoring along right beside him, his face disarmingly handsome and sleep-soft.
“I was thinking of adding canons, maybe some missiles, give the suit a little more oomph, if you know what I mean,” he says, the wiggle of his fingers mirrored by the Mark LIII. “Just imagine it, Cap; all that firepower dancing at the tips of my itchy fingers.” One bad day away from total destruction.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry to leave you in a lurch back there, winghead,” Tony says, tipping his drink to his lips before remembering it’s empty. He drops his hand, letting the glass dangle with his fingers loosely clasping the rim. “How was the eulogy? Uncle Obie do a good job?”
“I cannot see how.”
The man turns to him, his expression perplexed. “Aemilius was a retiarius, not a secutor.”
“I’m not seeing anyone right now, if that’s what you’re asking.”
“Whatever transpires… neither of us are at fault, Stefanus,” Bacchus tells him. “This day, though unwelcome, is not unexpected.”
“I didn’t say anything,” Tony protests, and he wasn’t going to. Far be it for him to judge how the other half lives, especially someone who hadn’t inherited his millions.
Nat elbows Clint’s arm. “I’m sure the list is shorter than that.”
“Tony, can I speak with you? Alone.”
Steve looks happy but uncertain, like a man who has gotten everything he’s ever wanted but knows better than to trust it. There’s a moment of hesitation and then: “I– I’d like that.”
Steve ogles Tony’s admittedly-subpar drawing. “Why does he have a clamshell on his head?”
Tony only grumbles, “Last time I do you a favor.” He looks over at Stark-tropolis. “What do you say, Cap? Ready to save the day?”
Stark doesn’t clamor for his weapons; he doesn’t try to climb the line of Steve’s body to get to them while Steve desperately tries to hold him off. Instead, he simply says “Oh” and heads into his ship.
“You went out tonight.”
Tony slams the door in his face.
“Steve. What–”
“Are you going to try to fight Dad?”
“Master Phillips?”
Antony accepts the greeting before reclining on the empty settee opposite Priscus. “Yes, very much so,” he replies, easing into an informal diplomacy on behalf of his father. “I hope we can count on your support in the upcoming election.” Among certain circles, it always played well to pay lip service to the paterfamilias, such fealty being the cornerstone of Roman society, at least in theory.
Tony begins to struggle, trying to break out and reach the phone. “I have. I love Steve, and I’m gonna tell him.”
“How do you do that?” Tony’s arrows had all missed the target completely, landing outside the rings with a few impaling the surrounding wall.
Steve turns the minifigure in his hand, noting the tiny wings painted into the side of his head. “…Thanks, Shellhead.”
Steve shakes his head. “I just don’t want to have any regrets.”
“No.” Tony locks his ankles behind Steve’s back, trying to keep him in. He needs him to stay, to finish, no matter the cost to Tony’s body, the higher the better in fact.
(The rich rarely want their furniture sullied with the grime of slave garments, thought they strangely have no compunction about the cleanliness of their bodies.)
Cap tries to avoid him after that until Tony settles onto the sofa in the sunken living room, flirting and cuddling up to Bruce.
Tony is an excellent liar.
Tony hefts up his gun. “Lead the way.”
Jarvis had called emergency services, and Tony is rushed to a private (and very discreet) emergency clinic where they administer sedatives and monitor his condition through the night. By the time Tony comes home, Steve had found and flushed his stash, and made him promise never to do such a thing again.
“Does he know anything about Egyptology? About the Pharaohs?”
“Sparky?”
He crosses his arms. “I’m not crazy,” he pouts.
“You really must try the flamingo tongue,” Antony suggests, his eyes alighting on the nearest plate. “It has a fatty flavor that is simply delightful.”
So Tony wraps a sheet around his waist and shuffles closer, shifting gingerly to avoid the tenderness in his ass. “I’ve loved you for a long time, Steve Rogers, and… and well, the circumstances aren’t ideal, but I want to make a real go of it.” He peers down at their daughter, holds out a finger for her to grasp in her tiny fist, as he admits, “You weren’t the only one who wanted her.”
“I thought it was rather obvious. You like me; I know you do,” Stark repeats patiently.
“The Jedi have no shortage of enemies these days. You should be grateful to have an ally. Any ally,” The Mandalorian crosses his arms, his hands nowhere near his blaster. “Plus, your master paid in advance.”
Tony slips into his study.
“But it’s still in his… bed, I guess? His coffin? Why isn’t it outside with everything else?”
“What’s wrong with him?” one man had asked, eyeing the cap advertising he was sold as-is with no guarantee as to his health or temperament. “Is he plagued with morbus gallicus?” He leans in close to Suibne’s face to inspect his smooth chin. “He doesn’t appear to suffer from mentagra.”
“Fuck off!” Tony shouts, curling into himself to shield his body from the cold. Though muffled by the pillow, the lights and ambient noise manage to further exacerbate his hangover.
It is not.
“Of course not.”
Tony’s breath catches in his throat. “Say it again.”
“Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant!” he calls to the man’s retreating back.
Tony presses his nose to the glass as he watches Jarvis escort their new housekeeper, Ms. Sarah, and her son to the in-law suite that served as a servants’ quarters. Steve is small, scrawny, and blond and (if Tony plays his cards right) his new best friend. Jarvis and Ana never had children, and the other students at his secondary prep school were all so much older than Tony, but Steven is eleven, the same age as him, and will be living on-site at the mansion. He is, in effect, a captive audience.
The referees step in, declaring Stefanus the de facto winner of the match as he rises to his feet, gazing down at Bacchus still on his knees.
“Your body language is more honest this way.” Bacchus sees an opening, aiming his false trident to spear his knee. “…And had this bout been real, you’d be crippled, possibly dead.”
“Perhaps we got off to a bad start, Staius,” Tiberius tells him rather magnanimously. “I am willing to start over should you agree.”
“You spoil me.” He checks to make sure the safety is off, one eye looking through the site at the floor. “You really shouldn’t have, darling.”
His voice isn’t winning him any points either.
“If what?”
It isn’t a terrible idea, but – “Because dating a fellow Ultimate worked out so well for both of us?”
“I said no talking.”
Stefanus eyes the long, browned strips of flesh, the bile rising in the back of his throat at the sensory memory of its taste and what happened in the aftermath the first (and last) time he had such an opportunity. “Thank you, but I will have to decline.”
Dracula seems to cotton on to the source of his unease. “I do not wish to cause my son pain, and Anthony would be very sad if you were to meet an untimely demise at my hand.”
…Let’s try this again, hm? I think I’ve got it right this time.
“How far along are you?” Cap finally asks, his voice strangled, his body tensed as if stuck between flight and fight.
But Erasmus waves off his concern. “I have confidence he will find his footing once his feet stop growing.”
He rolls his eyes. “Do you ever quit?”
Another pause, then: S-O-R-R-Y and W-H-E-R-E / A-R-E / Y-O-U-?
“Why hello there, gorgeous. Aren’t chu a tall drink o’ water?”
“My, you really are the clever one,” the first sounds almost impressed. “The vow of silence begins upon your agreement to our terms.”
“So what do you say? Half pepperoni, half abomination?” Tony offers.
“A little warning next time?” Steve tells him, a touch miffed once Pepper shuts the door.
“Don’t you start up on that again.” Steve is so frustrated; he’d even begun to look at
“Yeah, about that,” Tony says, trying to smooth out his hair. “It’s been fun, but I’m trying this new thing where I don’t sleep with my assistants.”
“…That won’t be necessary.”
And again.
That stops Steve in his tracks. He turns. “…What?”
“Occupied,” he states weakly then groans, resting his cheek on the bare seat, a bit of regurgitated cocktail dripping down his chin. “Can you come back and yell at me later when I’m back in tip-top form?”
“Tony–”
Probably.
“I am, but no one’s going to approach me if you’re standing right next to me looking like a member of the Secret Service instead of a man on his honeymoon.”
His father would have his hide if he ever found out the provenance of that particular scrawl. Though in his defense, he was very drunk, and Romulus had dared him to do it.
So Steve simply sighs, his eyes steady on the road. “Of course I did,” he replies evenly. “You reminded me fifteen times and saw me load up Billy.”
Suibne cannot shake the boy’s presence later. As a retiarius, he is chained down in the same claustrophobic block as seven others of his class. Four bunk beds lie interlocking along the wall of the rectangular room with a tight space in the center small enough to allow only two men to stand shoulder to shoulder. Predictably, the only available bed is a straw mattress on the top bunk above a young man named Aemilius and situated directly adjacent to Bacchus’s bunk in an L-formation.
Rhodey has got to be kidding.
“…My best friend thought it might help me.”
“Oh my God,” Tony exclaims, realization dawning. “You know exactly what it means to eat someone out.” There is only one possible explanation. “Steve. Have you been watching porn?”
Stark grits his teeth. “I didn’t thank you.”
“My mother’s dead three years past.”
And so he says, “What’s the matter, old man? Performance issues? You know, not uncommon, especially at your age. One out of five–”
Later, when Rhodey rings up Tony about the interview, Tony can hear the near-naked glee in the man’s tone as he asks, “So… what did you think of Mr. Rogers?”
That is certainly true. From what Stefanus had observed, Antony does not want for much of anything and regularly shared his wealth with acquaintances and household staff both. Case in point: the cost of the bolt of cloth he now held in his hands likely exceeded the per diem he paid Priscus to rent Stefanus for this very trip, and yet he thought nothing of fashioning it into a base tunic for a slave he didn’t even own.
ever seen you?”
“I thought this time Red Skull can try to gather all the supervillains into a cabal of some sort…”
Or perhaps he had known all along and simply didn’t wish to see it, the truth engraved in hundreds of tombstones in the cemetery reserved for the disreputable, the forgotten ones who lived under the crushing heel of servitude and more often than not died young.
Hadrianus’s expression is calculated but stern. “Have you finally grown tired of him? I must admit your infatuation lasted longer than ideal, but I am glad you finally have gotten
For his part, Stark takes a deep breath, but he holds steady, as if steeling himself for the next blow he knows must be coming.
“Can he dig?”
“You’re right. The desk would be easier to clean.” Purple Man pulls Stark’s rolling chair away from the desk then turns his attention to Rogers. “You. Come over to this side and bend over the desk. Let your leader see the goods.”
This was a mistake.
“What? Why?” It’s not Steve’s fault Stark didn’t secure his ship properly, and besides, he is simply a padawan, an unpaid apprentice. He didn’t have the funds for this.
“This can’t happen again,” the man states as he threads his arms through his shirt and pulls it over his head, “Ever.”
Tony pinpoints the problem almost immediately. Steve had written the correct hex code alright.
“…I could use the break,” Tony tells him instead. “Just think about it, Steve. Wide open roads, new locales, plenty of hot and willing local girls. We could do all fifty states. I mean, some states will be kind of tricky. Like Alaska. Kind of far, sparsely populated, and the sex ratio is just not in our favor, you know. Plus, their food sucks, unless it’s like salmon or whatever. I don’t know if they even have the components of a decent burger or if everything has to be like… flown in by plane, but we can’t just skip Alaska. That would be crazy, right?” He considers it briefly before replying, “Right.”
“There’s no place to stow him; he’s huge,” Stark complains.
“Well, not much he can do about it, is there?”
“Tools, nails, screws, seeds, food, fuel, matches… those are priority,” Steve states, snapping his binoculars closed to pocket them. “But if we have the space and you find one, then you can have your meat grinder.”
Master Erskine doesn’t move. “You go on ahead; I’ll catch up at port.”
Tony rolls his eyes at the man’s short-sightedness. “I haven’t had a cheeseburger in literal
Steve examines the photo, the colors faded with age, then tosses his own shield to Tony. “Come on. I’ll let you practice with the real thing.”
“But what?”
Rhodey just stares. “The guy – who has loved you for a while now, possibly years – will move on in the next six months? We’re talking that guy?” he says flatly.
“Your friends were not so kind,” the first orb observes.
Antony’s head snaps up. It is a secret, him and Tiberius, and if Hadrianus ever found out… “You cannot tell anyone. Swear it to me, Romulus. No one else can know.”
Tony does go inside, but he refuses to divulge the cause of Steve’s exit. Rhodey is already aware of his sexual proclivities, but he knows nothing of Steve’s.
,” Tony states. “Why can’t you send Cap and Jan? It makes more sense. They already live in sin; it’s not that much of a stretch he’d pop the question once her divorce finalizes.”
“We are not permitted to discuss the details.”
“But you have granted me that choice.”
“Oh… Oh God, Tony,” Steve audibly smacks his lips. His eyes are half-lidded with sweat dripping off his forehead and glistening on his bright red chest. His fingers grasp the sheets as his body tenses up, his toes curling and back arching over the bed. “Jesus, God Damn!”
“There is no harm in a second look.”
Perplexed, Steve looks up from his calculus homework, his pen tapping at the open book. “Tell you what?”
Tony narrates the action. “…Until finally – Naught remains but a frozen, petrified figure in a state of suspended animation,” he says, moving the submarine in a slow arc around the minifigure, “a figure which drifts past the undersea craft of – The Avenger!”
“You really don’t know?” And now Bucky sounds confused. “Only virgins attract unicorns, and if Stark’s unicorn is missing…” he lets the implication hang between them.
“Because you can’t do it,” Stark declares triumphantly.
Tony gives himself a further ten minutes to collect his addled thoughts, process what had happened, and re-evaluate certain assumptions before putting on a robe and seeking out Steve to
But now Stefanus’s face dims, his brows lowered in frustration. “You do realize we aren’t like that. We never were.”
“That’s not an excuse,” Tony interrupts. He rubs at his blurry eyes, already irritated with himself. “I’m just really sorry, and I hope you can forgive me.”
And that is it. Their relationship ends not with a bang, not with the sword or spear and Stefanus bleeding out on the sands, but with a whisper, a glance, or so Antony believes.
Before the situation can devolve further, Stefanus gently grasps Antony’s elbow. “Antony… you have a meeting with the city planners this afternoon, and there is much to prepare. It would be a shame to keep them waiting.”
“Fifteen.”
“I don’t mean to imply anything. I’m sure we’re good, but if we could go to the clinic first, and maybe get tested…”
Later, he would wonder if she was simply lonely.
“Tony… you know how I feel about you, and that hasn’t changed,” Steve says softly. “I understand you’re still in recovery. You still have a lot of stuff you’re working through, and the last thing I want is to pressure you when you aren’t ready. I– I’ve wanted you for years, and I can wait a while yet.”
“I hope you’re right about that, for both your sakes.”
“Oh, I’d say pretty stupid,” the Mandalorian says, taking a step forward, stopping just outside lightsaber range. “Relax; if I had wanted you dead, you’d be on the ground with the others. I was hired six months ago by your master to protect you should the worst happen, to ferry you to the planet Tython where you could be safe, hidden with a small enclave of your kind.”
“I’m not an invalid,” Tony insists, ruffling his hair with his free hand.
“I’m still right here,” Tony adds, leaning up against the back of the couch. They can’t even wait until he is out of the room to gossip behind his back? The audacity.
“I’m so sorry, Steve.” Tony sounds small, like he wants the ground to open up and swallow him whole.
“Alright,” Bucky concedes even as he thins his eyes at Tony from the other side of Steve. “Fair warning, we play ball in a grass field, not Yankee Stadium.”
“You like Legos?”
Then again, his only crime had been trying to take the mission seriously while Tony was treating the entire venture as a goddamn holiday. Why should Steve be the one left out to suffer? Worked up over the injustice of it all, he stomps back inside, ready to give Tony a piece of his mind then force him to sleep on the floor where he can roll around to his heart’s content. He doesn’t even knock as he throws open the door.
Tony is still dictating his movements. “I am now walking towards the parlor, and…” he rounds the corner, his tense shoulders visibly relaxing at the downright domesticity of the scene before him. “And good. You haven’t killed each other.”
Stark clears his throat. “Two days is a lot of time,” he replies, his voice dropping low.
“Yes, please.”
Steve turns his gaze askew as he rubs the back of his neck. “It’s not… She– she doesn’t like men in general, all right?”
Stark harrumphs, but he assents to his friend’s wishes, passing both to Steve. “Alright. I’m unarmed. Lay it on me.”
Steve,” Tony insists.
“I was two inches shy of the ceiling,” he complains.
He slides in closest to the hull, lying on his side faced away while Stark slips in behind him, an arm thrown low over his middle. There are lips on the back of his neck, pressing soft kisses upon the skin there, as Steve drops into a deep, satisfying slumber.
Tony entangles his fingers in Steve’s. “I’m ready.”
“Next stop is Tython. Are you ready to rejoin your Jedi friends?”
Though the other boy had quickly bested him in their earlier contest, Suibne thinks Bacchus may be the one with a head injury when he approaches him at meal time, sliding next to him on the bench and beaming in his direction. Suibne clutches his bowl of barley and boiled beans tightly, thinking the larger boy liable to steal what little he has in retaliation for the black eye blooming on his cheekbone.
It would never work.
He had rented a studio in Brooklyn, and most of his “furniture” (if it could be called that) was clearly broke college-student dorm fare. There’s a card table surrounded by milk cartons and folding chairs as well as an old television set on an IKEA coffee table, but at least he had a real full-size bed, big enough for two.
Presently, he’s shuffling papers in front of Tony, trying to sort out Stark Industries finances, its leadership. “There is the question of the annual Arctic survey to locate–”
“He’s a mechanical engineering student, too?”
Tony offers to cosign on Steve’s student loans, but Steve declines his offer, instead attending part-time community college for graphic design while working retail in a paint shop.
“Not to me, it doesn’t. I’m supposed to be… Captain America always does the right thing – no hesitation – even when it’s the hard thing.”
“Steve… I know you don’t know him well, but Steve is amazing, honeybear. A real stand-up guy,” Tony babbles as he takes another hit. “And he gives like… the best hugs, you know. No exaggeration. Really holds onto you, makes you feel safe and wanted and warm. I love his hugs. They’re the best. Steve is the best.”
Tony sidles up to his left. “So… what are you thinking?”
Bucky had been popular, kissing all manner of fellow younglings, but Steve had not been nearly as successful despite his friend’s best efforts. He hadn’t had his first kiss by the time he passed the Initiate Trials and that streak continued through his apprenticeship under Master Erskine. Having been singularly focused on becoming a knight, it hadn’t seemed like a big deal at the time, but as he watches Stark strip off his beskar chest plate and shin guards but leave his helmet, Steve wishes he could have maybe kissed a being or two before this point.
There will be a time for regrets later, after the last touch, the very last kiss, but for now, they can savor it all, wrapped up in each other.
But Rhodey is shaking his head. “No way, man. You do what you want, but I’m sitting this one out.”
“So… all that’s left is the divorce,” Tony begins. He doesn’t sound too happy about it.
“Excuse me?”
“I’m not looking for a prostitute.”
“Now tell me, Tony. Tell me
“Well, it’s not like I’d say it to his face.”
“I see your… companion is missing today.”
evident in his tone – before pivoting to Steve. “Steve, this is my father, Vlad Dracula.”
Also, in the late 70s/early 80s, only 1 in 5 Americans had cable. Most families had like five channels. And VCRs came out in 1975 at a cost of $1,400, but it was around $640 in 1982 (when the average yearly income was around $14,500). Bucky thinks Tony is rubbing his family’s wealth in his face to point out to Steve how much better off he is now, and Tony doesn’t understand that the average family doesn’t have these things.
“What are you writing?”
“Oh.” In hindsight, that explained why she kept mentioning needing to refresh her drink or be literally anywhere else, and Tony had followed her around like a lost, exceptionally-clueless puppy. Perhaps his audience wasn’t even as charmed as he had imagined they were and were silently wishing he’d just shut up, but he couldn’t take a hint. He had wanted to fit in and instead had come off as some weirdo with boundary issues, hadn’t he?
Purple Man isn’t sure why. (He’s not a mind-reader after all.) The good captain is attractive but dull, too principled to be interesting, not like Stark, not like the Purple Man himself. He supposes there is no accounting for taste. Purple Man wonders whether Rogers has ever removed that stick out of his ass and let loose.
“You most certainly will
“Sure thing, Cap.” Tony gives him a military salute in jest. “Iron Man out.”
“It’s our last night here,” Stark informs Steve yet again. Rhodey is due in the morning to tow them back to town where he has already stocked up on everything Stark needs to repair his ship.
His opponent, Aemilius, unencumbered by the heavy armor of a secutor, circles him, the retiarius net swaying and swooping from his heavily armored left arm in a scene reminiscent of a fisherman closing in on his quarry. Stefanus can barely see through the small eyeholes of his enclosed helmet, his head protected but peripheral vision curtailed as he concentrates on the dance he had learned so well in his early years at the ludus, observing the small tells in his opponent’s stance as Aemilius prepares the cast.
“What’s with the peach fuzz?” Bucky had teased, zeroing in on the change in Tony’s appearance almost immediately. “Trying out something new for the ladies? Does it tickle?”
Tony slides the scroll closer to the third member of their party. “Pepper, back me up on this one. What does this look like to you? A scepter, yes?”
Being from Britannia, Stefanus is likely unfamiliar with Antony’s native tongue, because his expression passes from confusion to what might be understanding if not for the final look of weary acceptance.
Cap has to agree. “Yeah, I’m not sure how–”
But it is not their decision.
That was one of the first things Captain America had said to him on the day they met, when he has stared down Tony with contempt, had sized him up and found him wanting.
“Mm hm.” She scratches something else down. “Do you often use humor to derail uncomfortable conversations?”
Master Phillips knows what that portends. “He doesn’t have the temperament,” he says, pointing out the obvious.
“…You’ve spent way too long trapped in that mansion by yourself,” she states as she holsters her machete and begins to scale the fence.
“Your dad won’t like that.”
Tony stares off into the middle distance, his attention phasing in and out until he catches his physician recommending “We would like to schedule an ultrasound to confirm–”
Stefanus stops him outside the cosmetics stands. “You are too kind, but do not feel you have to adorn me in… all matters of finery.” Before, back when he had been lean and lithe, his clients used to paint his face white in the matter of women and prostitutes then perfume his hair to cover up the noxious smell of such beauty treatments.
Tony perks up at that. “Do you think they’ll have meat grinders, specifically a LEM Products #10 manual grinder?”
That’s a thought, but “I’m an engineer, not a biologist.”
“And there is… I have a friend back in the ludus. I will do anything you ask, find any way to repay you, but if you could free him as well–”
Steve crosses his arms. “Sounds like a good way to catch HIV,” he states.
“There. Just like that,” Tony declares, his voice impressively even.
The boy looks up.
Tony gives Steve an appraising look, his gaze calculated before declaring, “Okay fine. I’m in. What about you, Cap? You ready to pretend to like dick or is the thought of presenting as queer triggering your good ol’ American fight or fight response? Because the anonymous thing isn’t going to work in this scenario. Anyone paying attention is going to know I married Captain America, even without the cowl.”
Maybe then, Tony won’t care about the man as much as he does.
“You wanna go? Let’s step outside, ya cockeyed bastard,” Steve had slurred at the larger, much burlier man who had made a comment about the rank smell of rotted fish stinking up the first-class lounge.
“It was cancer. Steve didn’t tell any of us, except Bucky before we shipped out, and Bucky didn’t tell me until she died. You know how the guy is. He probably thought she’d get better and didn’t want to be a bother.”
“Asshole.”
As silence falls in the clearing, Steve turns on the Mandalorian, his saber still raised in battle mode. Steve is no fool. He knows their history, the long drawn-out war between Jedi and Mandalorians that left the latter’s planet hostile and uninhabitable save a few domed cities. There is no love lost between their kind; no way a mercenary – a Mandalorian at that – would rescue a lone Jedi.
“Hey,” he interrupts. “No PDA. I’m right here,” before he mutters, “though that didn’t stop you last night.” He needs to set his own limits before this… whatever this is… goes any farther than it has.
“No sweat, Tones. I’m just glad you’re finally getting help from a professional.” Rhodey had been really worried about him; Tony can tell by the naked relief in his voice.
There’s more shuffling then a screech of metal followed by a flurry of boots.
Antony’s hands pause.
Stefanus nearly falls onto the bed behind him, his knees giving out like a puppet whose strings have been cut. He lies back and gazes unseeing at the ceiling then at the nearest wall in the middle distance.
Steve hands Stark’s weapons to the man and then follows after the Mandalorian.
Bacchus can only hold him back, his arms tight around his back as he cries.
He hears them: the crack of snapping vegetation, the heavy step of metal boots, their identical shouts and high pitched whine of their weapons as they spread out and pepper the underbrush with blaster fire. Some even travel ahead, skirting the edges before doubling back, trying to surround Steve in a net of personnel.
. “Gross.”
Bucky gives him a hug in response, holding on for longer than necessary before he pulls away, patting and squeezing both shoulders of his long-time friend. “We’ll meet again, hopefully before the next trials.”
Leave it to Tony to complain about the harbinger of his death as opposed to his actual demise.
He's breathing heavily as Tony’s own levels out.
“This is why I wanted to take separate kayaks,” Steve mumbles.
Tony turns away as he squeezes the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger before declaring, “Just… just let me go, Cap. It’s time.” Cap is used to losing good soldiers. Tony will just be one in a long line of casualties.
And so, by the middle of the night, Tony is fantasizing about an earthquake shaking open the floor and swallowing him whole. Maybe in his devastation, Steve will forget about the events of the last few hours and remember him fondly as the man he was before all this… a man who he didn’t know had fucked half of the Upper West Side.
“I like you, and I think you like me, too,” he says suddenly, adding, “and I think we should – if you wanted, that is – I think we could, you know, see where that goes?”
“You and I both know it’s got to be real. Cap doesn’t love me, and the only thing telling him is going to do is make him feel guilty for something he can’t control,” he reasons. The ache in his chest deepens and burns at the thought. “This isn’t his fault, alright? I know I can be a selfish asshole, but I’m not gonna do that to him.” Tony already has a bum ticker; it will be best for Steve and everyone else to assume it was his heart that ultimately gave out.
“Oh, so you can see a little?”
Steve simply stares at him from the opposite end of the couch. “…You went for the throat,” he points out, his tone incredulous.
Dum Dum’s spine straightens taut. “You threw the first punch.”
He sighs. “Well, if you do, then I’ll be there for you, okay? Anything you need; anything at all.” There’s a large hand on Tony’s shoulder, which he shrugs off.
He can’t possibly be suggesting what Steve thinks he’s suggesting, but just to make sure: “Meaning…”
“There were no straws.”
And now Romulus looks morose.
in Step 1, but Purple Man can be patient, especially when he wants to make a point.
Antony supposes he will soon be in a position to find out.
And damn if that doesn’t make Steve’s stomach flip.
“That’s different. We are…”
Steve fumes.
“I don’t care about that. All I care about is what’s right, and what he’s doing to you isn’t–”
Steve holds him closer. “Thank you,” he murmurs. “That will also give me some time to get some supplies. I uh… I did not expect anything to happen tonight, but you can stay if you’d like. I have an extra T-shirt and sleep shorts you can borrow.”
Cap quickly locates his pants, throwing the sheet directly in Tony’s face. He shrugs them on as Tony reorients the sheet to wrap it around his body.
“You are overstepping. Some of us have social lives. We don’t want to be spotless,
“And whose fault was that? You were never around, too busy chasing after a ghost to see what was happening. Hell, maybe if you had stayed, she would have changed her mind or not fallen in love with someone else in the first place. You ever think of that?” Tony had begged him to stay, and yet the man still chose to abandon her – abandon them – for
Steve puts his own dinner aside. “I’ve been thinking… we could die tomorrow,” he says. He’s not quite looking at Stark, instead staring at his hands, the blush already creeping up and burning the nape of his neck.
talk.
Steve exhales and his shoulders droop in what Tony interprets as relief. “…We could work out a co-parenting arrangement.”
“I can’t help it, okay? I’m just–” Steve sighs, borderline miserable. “It is what it is.”
He pops his head out of the ship’s open side door, pointing at Steve. “You! You are reimbursing me for this!”
“It’s nothing personal, but this can’t happen again.”
Steve is about to follow when Dracula attempts to shut the door in his face, only to be stopped by Steve’s foot in the door and arm braced in front of himself to stop it from breaking his nose.
But Barnes doesn’t stand down. “You’re just jealous Rogers didn’t have to bribe nobody for his spot. They just accepted him, no questions asked. You think you know better than the masters?”
“Do I really have to spell it out for you? I don’t care that Stark railed you so hard that your bed collapsed, but could you maybe talk about your sex life when I’m not around?” Clint doesn’t feel he’s being unreasonable; it’s just common courtesy when you live with housemates.
He then crosses the room and leans over to caress Antony’s cheek in a mimicry of affection he does not feel.
Tony scoffs. “I’m only a month older than you!”
“Shiv-na?” Bacchus tries.
“Yes, I believe we understand each other.”
Steve has been spending far too much time with the geriatric set.
Tony falls back a bit behind Steve, his baseball bat raised but still a touch squeamish about being so up close and personal with the undead. He will adjust in time; they all have had to. Eventually.
“Well, a man’s got to do what he has to,” he replies ominously.
“You are strong and were able to avoid my bite,” Dracula says, observing how Steve’s bruises are already healing on their own.
“Uri, Vinciri, Verberari Ferroque Necari” is a vow gladiators recite before fights. It means “(I will endure) to be burned, to be chained, to be beaten and to be killed by the sword.” Even freedmen/freemen who have sold themselves to the ludus take this oath with the understanding that they could very well die.
Tony grins. “See, now you’ve got it.” Perhaps this won’t be so bad after all, this friendship thing.
“Okay, I got it,” Tony agrees, sounding defeated. There’s another beat before he asks, tentatively, carefully: “Is it… do you always have to think about that?”
Dr. Ferguson hums, her pen moving across her pad in wide loops. “And why do you think ‘honeybear’ is worried?”
. “She’s sick, and you can’t go.” Surely, his father loves Mamma enough to make every effort to ensure she lives, even if it means giving up his fruitless, decades-long obsession over a ghost.
The situation does not improve at dinner.
He supposes the money didn’t hurt.
“I thought it was the staff. Didn’t expect our visitor to push past me into the room.” Tony throws him his clothing from the floor. “Now get dressed and finish packing, we have a long day ahead of us.”
“But hey… it’s not like he’s taken. I haven’t heard… Maybe it was just a fling. It doesn’t mean you’ve lost your shot,” Bucky tries (poorly) to cheer him up before mumbling, “And maybe now at least one of you will know what to do.”
Stefanus nearly beams. “I could assist in that.”
Steven looks at his feet. “Figures. Brock says I’m too old for a family. He says they’ll sell me for spare parts if I don’t get big enough to leave on my own.”
Probably the latter.
They had been disposing of their food waste a short distance from Stark’s ship, but that proves short-sighted when the refuse attracts a pride of saber cats. Steve had run towards a shout that quickly morphed into screams until he came across Stark pinned by an eight-legged creature. Two already lay dead while two others pounced onto his flailing limbs, trying to use their teeth to get around the beskar and leather.
“Steve?” he croaks, his throat scratchy from last night.
Steve thinks of Master Erskine with his kind eyes and soft voice. A weight forms in Steve’s belly, and he swallows around the lump in his throat. “My master is dead.”
The saber cats hiss, but are wary of approaching the Jedi and so they retreat into the tree line. Steve feels for their presence, not dropping his guard until they are gone. He drops to his knees beside the fallen Mandalorian.
Tony can feel the anger, old and profound, rise up. “…You think I’m what? Too easy?” It’s obvious Steve doesn’t want to stoop to his slutty, slutty level by being with someone like him, and the knowledge wounds something deep inside him. “For your information, just because I have a lot of partners doesn’t mean I’ll fuck just anyone that asks.” He knows he’s attractive, and that in combination with being rich and a certified genius just means he has options, damn it. He scoffs, “You really think
“I don’t kiss and tell.”
“Very. How else is he to ensure my safety?” Antony tilts his head to the side as he regards his friend’s curious expression. “What?”
Servilius scowls and looks pointedly at Stefanus. “Is yours available?”
Not when the very thought of it makes the man shudder. Irrumatio has never been Antony’s preference, and so he replies. “No, it is a rumor I heard, and I was simply curious.”
Dum Dum sighs, bringing Tony back to the matter at hand. “Never gonna live that name down,” he grumbles before getting down to business. “Look, Bucky told me not to call, saying that we should respect the guy’s wishes, and normally, I’d agree, but fuck that, you know?”
“You need to be more careful, Tony. You could get very sick doing what you do,” Steve says softly, looking down at his hands. “Did you know that guy’s last name? Did you even use protection?” He surreptitiously peers over at the room trash can to see if he can find the spent condom without digging through the contents.
Her casket is made of solid mahogany lined in blush-colored silk and covered in the largest arrangement of white roses money can buy. The booze is top-shelf and the food even better, until his father takes a drunken swing at Tony’s ex-piano teacher and knocks over one of the canapé tables in a crash of glass and caviar toast points. Uncle Obie had to hold him back while security escorted Mr. Morelli out of the funeral.
He knows Steve–
The following morning after a hearty breakfast of oats and dried fruit, Suibne spars with Aemilius.
“And who’s fault is that?”
a small diversion for the crowd to slake their bloodthirst between bouts featuring real men.”
“This what you want, huh?” Steve whispers into his ear, his tongue sliding over the shell. He pushes down Tony’s pants to his knees then unfastens his own. He pulls a slim packet of lube from his pocket and tears it open with his teeth to smear it over his erection.
“Oh hey you, long time no see,” the bartender says as he pours a scotch neat for Tony and a beer for Steve.
“Easy for you to say,” Tony retorts. “You’ve never spilled your deepest, darkest secrets out to a… to a–”
Tony digs his heels in about six yards away then leads Steve off to the side of the room. “What was that about?” he asks him point blank.
It will be ten years, give or take. Ten years under Master Erskine’s tutelage. Steve will learn the ways of the Jedi, become a knight in his own right, and be a part of something bigger than himself, something good.
“I just don’t want to lose it to someone I met three hours ago. I know it’s prudish, but I just want it to be special, you know?”
“Don’t freak out,” Steve implores him, even as the baby starts up again. He bounces the child in an attempt to calm it, but with how rigid, how stricken Steve is, the motion can’t possibly be comfortable for either of them.
Six weeks later and Tony has regrets.
“You don’t get it.”
“So you can ram into mine and capsize us both? No thanks.”
Captain America is above reproach, the patriotic embodiment of their great country, but Steve Rogers is just a shell of a man, weak and flawed and ultimately unable to live up to that lofty mantle.
And again.
“Yeah,” Steve concurs.
It is a pragmatic solution to a whole host of issues, one that would tie Stefanus to Antony for the near future, if not for life.
Mr. Rogers removes the paper from under his arm and unfolds it to reveal a classified ad circled in red ink.
“I don’t know.
During the gladiatorial games, Stefanus catches the eye of Antonius Staius, the son of a high-ranking senator. Antony rents him as a “bodyguard” for the night.
Only one problem: “What if he moves on before all that happens?”
“You don’t have to. Loverboy over there is practically glowing.”
Tony kicks him under the table. “I was high. The weed was probably laced with E or something.”
“Antony,” he corrects him.
“No, I– there’s nothing wrong with my eyes.”
And he does manage to stay true to his word. It is easy in a way, at least at first.
He recalls Bucky back on the estate, back when Steve had been undersized, underfed, and too mouthy for his own good. Bucky had pulled more than one bully off him, had snuck him sweets when his tutor, who had been trying to instill a sense of class cohesion, hadn’t been looking. It was Bucky who funded his purchases of armor and a horse, who had vouched for him, given him the opportunity to prove himself when he came of age and rise up to his current station.
Michelle finishes lighting up then taps the pack until she loosens a fresh one to hold out to Steve. He accepts, and she flicks on her lighter underneath as he breathes in, allowing the end to catch.
He flips them both over the back of the couch and tries to wrestle the vampire to the ground even as Dracula gains the upper hand.
Tony seems to release the breath he is holding – “Good to see you too, Dad” – and crosses the threshold.
Because Steve is tired of waiting, his patience having worn threadbare under Master Phillips’s frustrating inertia. “But when?”
Hadrianus doesn’t call his bluff, letting Antony’s decision stand. He presents the rudis and phrygian cap of freedom to both Bacchus and Stefanus at the close of the games, releasing them from Priscus’s service and gladiatorial combat altogether. Antony can only watch as Stefanus helps Bacchus limp out of the arena into the hypogeum, meeting his eye when Stefanus looks back one final time to acknowledge the man who freed them with a curt nod.
“You don’t have to call me that. We’re alone,” Steve states, his tone sour.
Steve obliges. “Steve.”
“Wow, now you’re just purposely old-man-ifying expressions.”
“Oh, I have an alert that informs me every time my name is mentioned in the media. It’s probably that fluff piece I interviewed for a couple weeks back.” He clicks on the indicator to expand the news article, but instead of a review of his role on the Ultimates and what it meant for Stark stock prices, it’s a blown-up photo of Steve fucking into a dark-haired stranger from behind, cropped for decency but the situation obvious based on their matching expressions and nude torsos, his beefy arm swung around to delicately handle the man’s throat, with a headline splashed across the top declaring “Captain America’s Crippling Sex Addiction.” There’s a round inset stock photo of Tony looking upset with a smaller subheading, “PRE-NUP? Tony Stark Devastated Over Husband’s Infidelity, Considering $2.3B Divorce.”
It's a shame his mother hadn’t lived to see it. Or him.
Bacchus looks dubious but doesn’t say anything further as both finish their meal in silence.
Steve reaches out to lightly grasp Tony’s nearest wrist, his fingers whisper-soft as they stroke the back of his hand. “Depends on the guy.”
“You’re right,” Cap agrees, much to Tony’s surprise. “So I’m not gonna bench you, but if you won’t voluntarily step down for your own health, you should consider how it felt to think you might have lost your baby today, and how bad you’ll feel next time if you aren’t so lucky.”
“Aerospace,” Tony specifies. “It’s basically a specialization of mechanical engineering. We’re in a lot of the same classes, so we end up studying together a lot. He’s not like the other people in my dorm. It’s just nice being able to talk about applied mechanics and have him understand what I’m saying, you know?”
“If it’s taking you an hour, then you should see a doctor,” he hollers, checking his watch for what has to be the tenth time.
“Did you mean it?” Antony asks, his expression unreadable.
“Stark Industries is international,” Tony retorts. “This might come as a surprise to you, but certain discoveries have transpired since you’ve been on ice. For starters, the world revolves around the sun, not America. Shocking, I know. Tell me if I should break out the smelling salts, in case you’re feeling a touch faint at the upheaval of your entire world view.”
He looks back. “Yeah?”
Because slaves looked the same (ethnically-speaking) as the diverse free populace of Rome, many were branded on their hands (usually soldiers) or commonly on their foreheads. Slaves may be tattooed with “Stop me! I am a runaway!” or “tax paid” on their foreheads for slaves owned by the state, and fugitive slaves who were captured and survived their punishment may also have FVG (for fugitivus) tattooed on their foreheads. Because of this practice, many slaves wore headbands and escaped slaves prayed to Asclepius (the Greek god of healing) to remove their marks. In this fic, Priscus prefers to not mark the faces of retiarii (who fight bare-headed) or any slave whose pretty face might turn a profit through prostitution, but he will do it if they try to run.
. We are not about to invite two strangers, who may be enemy operatives, back to our room for extramarital sex.”
Stark stands, grabs a spit, then walks over to the other side, holding it out to Steve. When Steve doesn’t immediately accept, he buries the sharp end near his feet, returning to his side to dig into his remaining share.
“On second thought, the feast may be just the occasion.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Not this again.”
“...You’re not good at this people thing, are you?”
Steve manages to collect his limp body in his arms. Tony’s head lolls to the side as he groans through blue-tinged lips. The air is too stuffy, like trying to breathe in thick cotton balls. He’s vaguely aware that his dress shirt isn’t fully covering his ass, and the others will see more of Tony than any of them would prefer if Cap chooses to carry him back to the light of the party.
“Have you been exercising? Your arms are getting bulky.”
It is never going to happen for him now.
Tony almost chokes on his smoothie. He coughs and pounds his chest to clear the burn in his windpipe before mumbling, “I told him to use the back entrance.”
It had been a laughable dream, in retrospect. A fairy tale you’d tell children about heroes overcoming impossible odds with everything returning to normal as if nothing bad had ever happened. And yet–
position elevates
to smoke; most chemical dependencies had little effect on him after Rebirth, but sometimes it was nice to have an excuse to stay silent for two minutes without the need to make awkward conversation.
“We’ll be legends.”
Stefanus remembers the resistance of his blade through muscle. Aemilius didn’t want to die; his body had fought its death though the spirit had been resigned. He doubts there is meaning, much less honor, in such a death. What are they fighting for if not to sate the bloodlust of men who would never dare step into the arena at the risk of their own lives, to die so that others may experience the fragility of life by proxy and thus be rejuvenated? What honor, what higher purpose could there be in such a death? It was not like his service in Britannia, where his people had fought against the Roman invasion, to protect their home, their families, only to lose and be enslaved in the end.
Tony can’t help it. He starts to laugh.
“I am not ang–” but Steve thinks better of the lie, amending it to the more truthful: “I am simply disappointed. I should have been eligible six months past, and yet, here I remain.” Master Erskine thought him prepared too, but that was before his untimely death, before Steve ran down and crushed his former master’s assassin in what Master Phillips clearly thought of as emotionally-driven overkill.
Steve scrunches his nose. “I’m too old to be a foundling,” he states rather pointedly.
There’s a crash from within, followed by shouts and curses, metal objects clattering and banging. Rhodey flinches; Steve holds tighter to the man’s blasters.
If Tony had missed Steve and their friends during fall semester, those feelings become more acute the following spring. Having sampled a taste of his old life during the break, Tony feels their absence as classes start up again. He misses Manhattan as well as having friends and being among people his own age. Life at MIT feels so barren by comparison…
Steve silently withdraws his hand while Tony looks almost weary. “What happened to the DVR I got you for All Hallows’ Eve last year?”
Ah yes, Master Phillips: the face of an Ugnaught and the heart of an insect. Steve is about to imply as much when Phillips suddenly grabs Steve’s robes, jerking him down as he ducks himself, twin plasma blasts scorching the pillar in front of them where their heads had been.
He puffs away at the smoldering stick. “Honestly?” He inhales with a wheeze. “Not really, but not much I can do about that.”
Tony gives her a roguish smile. “I’ll rest when I’m dead.”
Bucky has forced his hand.
“He looks old enough to grow a beard should his lanista desire.”
Steve is defensive as he protests, “I told you I wasn’t good at it.” He pushes aside the slumped body, hurrying for the door panel to close and seal it.
In an ill-advised attempt to fit in, Tony had attended an off-campus frat party. Dressed in an MIT sweatshirt with the hood up and sporting patchy facial hair, Tony had passed as a regular freshman. It had helped that the party was dark and everyone else was already wasted.
“Well, what about chu?” Tony accuses, shrugging off any attempts to placate him. “I’m Tony fuckin’ Stark, and who’re you? A fuckin’ nobody, tha’s who. The hell would I want with a fuckin’ virgin who don’t even know how ta use his dick!”
Immediately, they turn, each fluidly drawing his lightsaber as they face not an unknown enemy but the very escort meant to fight alongside them. They parry and advance, deflecting blaster fire as Steve deftly circles behind Master Phillips to meet the clones coming from their original destination, all intent on their destruction.
Dolete puellae. Vos mentula desuerit, dolete puellae. Pedicare volo. Cunne superbe vale! = This has been translated as “Weep, you girls. My penis has given you up. Now it penetrates men’s behinds. Goodbye, wondrous femininity!” or (less charitably) “Cry, girls. My penis has given you up. Now I want to fuck ass. Goodbye, arrogant vagina!” So uh… translation is more an art than a science, probably.
Upon entering the living room, he had grabbed a beer to give himself something to hold, and then another when he had drained the first out of nervousness and lack of anything better to do. The alcohol loosens something inside him; whether it’s a psychological or physical effect of the social lubricant is hard to say, but halfway through his third, Tony is speaking a mile a minute to an enthralled audience of fellow co-eds, discussing the ethical considerations of emerging artificial intelligence technology.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. My technique is flawless.”
And so he takes to the trees, taking out clone foot soldiers individually and in small group using guerilla tactics when he can and hiding when he can’t. He dodges detection, trying to find a way out, but still the net tightens, constricting his options until he is cornered and forced out into a clearing, surrounded by clone soldiers.
He recalls Mr. Morelli pouring his mother a glass of vin Santo.
“The oil is on the table over there,” Antony reminds him before he can get much further. “You’ll need to spread some on your cock before you have me.”
“I slept just fine next to men in the war, but there are limits.”
“He would have thrown you overboard, and you would’ve died of hypothermia if the impact didn’t kill you outright. Then I’d have to inform your next of kin, and I don’t fancy breaking a mother’s heart,” he states flatly. Facing Virgil’s family had been hard enough, and to have to do another so soon…
“Nope.”
“Yes, Master Phillips,” Hodge replies.
“Because he’s lying,” Bucky adds.
“Steve’s favorite show about a secret agent who is a mouse. It’s huge in the UK.”
“It’s Antony,” Antony corrects him once again. “And there is no need. You can lie here for a moment; catch your breath if need be.”
The man’s face twists, but still there is a macabre sort of humor in his eye, considering the circumstances. “That is rather disturbing.”
Antony looks surprised, his fingers delicately tracing his lips, as if to feel the lingering warmth of the unexpected action. “You didn’t have to do that. I did not purchase the shield so you’d feel obligated–”
Purple Man smiles.
Romulus gives him a flat look.
“No.”
Tony claps his hands together. “Excellent. Now that we’re all acquainted, we should board and find our rooms. I have booked one for each of us.”
He brings him to Hadrianus, who gives him a cursory glance, his gaze zeroing in on his untamed hair. He frowns. “Took you long enough. I was beginning to think you would miss the excursion entirely.”
The man sure loved to hear himself talk, but as Steve understands it, that’s a pre-existing condition. Steve and the others follow after them, landing deftly on the other side. They make their way to the side entrance then bang on the door to announce their arrival.
Steve only smiles. “I didn’t want to make a liar out of you.”
is almost on!”
He supposes it’s the lack of a fight putting the men on edge and causing arguments to erupt among them more often of late. It had been a couple fortnights since their last contract when they had fought under Lord Fury’s banner to keep his liege lord’s enemies at bay. Steve hadn’t been familiar with the particulars, but then again, it hadn’t been his job to know, only to fight for his shilling a day plus a share of whatever regard Bucky had managed to secure for them for their service. It is a hard, dangerous life, but it is a good living, better than he could have made had he stayed a tenant on the Barnes family land, and he got to remain in the employ of his closest childhood friend, protecting his lord by serving alongside him. It was what Lord Barnes had asked of him when he left, though the order hadn’t been a necessity. Steve had always held a special regard for Bucky and would have followed him to the ends of the known world regardless of any vow.
What he needs is another bottle of the good stuff, but Tony doesn’t think Steve will take kindly to the suggestion. His friend probably had all sorts of ideas about what a proper grieving process entailed. Tony had seen it already. It involved a stiff upper lip, punching bags, and the inexplicable lack of sex.
Tony brushes off her concern, choosing to introduce his team to each other. “This is Steve Rogers, my new assistant,” he says, turning to Steve, “and this is Frank Finley, my chronicler from Marvels.”
When Steve returns hours later with some edible mushrooms, Stark had already snared and spit-roasted two small mammals over the fire. He rotates them to evenly crisp the skin as Steve takes a seat across from him. Steve fills up a pot with some water from his canteen and places it near the fire to boil. He’ll have his mushrooms while Stark eats whatever he’s cooking. Steve hopes he chokes on the creatures’ tiny bones. He hopes–
“Hush now,” he says gently, his touch lingering a hair longer than necessary before he withdraws and closes the hatch.
They don’t talk about it again. In fact, they barely talk at all. Not after that night nor over the next six years until Howard dies in a car accident one icy evening just before Christmas. Tony attends the funeral in a drunken daze while Uncle Obie handles the specifics – greeting guests, the eulogy, the burial.
“Ah yes. The boyfriend.” Dracula positively glares at Steve as if he is a leper or rather something Tony tracked in on his shoe. “Tell me, Steven, how would you smite Anthony’s enemies, hm?”
Novicus: novice gladiator
“Why do you even care?”
Clint gives a morbid half-grin as he pairs off with Sam. “No smooching in the lumber department, you two.”
– Antony can only hope the man didn’t pay for bad fellatio – but he supposes it’s no longer an issue based on what looks to be either a follow-up declaration of the superiority of anal sex or a jab at the man’s preferences:
“I am… happy to be of service to you in whichever way you choose to have me,” Stefanus replies flatly, the hesitation plain in his tone.
Stark prods him again, poking him in the side with a stick as he sat by the makeshift fire, trying to relax.
“Is it going to happen again?”
“I am looking for an all-night assignment. Full service.”
“Do I really hafta spell it out for you?” Steve rolls onto his stomach, head cradled on curled fingers propped up by his elbow as he gazes up at Tony with a languid stare. “I can suck cock with the best of ‘em. Interested?”
“Maybe nothing. I’m not eight years old anymore.” He’s not the inconvenient child always in the way whose father was too busy to so much as attend his birthday party multiple years in a row. DUM-E had to cut the cake, for Chrissakes. He had the photos to prove it, though Tony still wondered why he kept any of his childhood memorabilia. Incidents like that were best relegated to the dustbin of memory, buried deep enough for the therapist he never hired to not uncover.
“Not in the traditional sense, no, but there is more to life than the pollaxe and mace,” Bucky insists. As the younger son of a nobleman, he is always one fall of the horse, one rusty nail away from becoming the heir and so was required to learn his letters from a young age. By contrast, his men drew from the lower classes where such pursuits were more recreation than necessity, and a poor choice at that.
“To Aemilius,” Stefanus agrees, tapping his cup against Bacchus’s with a dull clink. He drains the contents completely only for Bacchus to refill it anew.
“Your anger is precisely why you are not ready, young padawan,” Master Erskine elaborates, despite the lack of verbal complaint from his student.
The gala is a mistake, a poor choice for an occasion of such import as his very first date with Steve. He had thought it would be the perfect way to charm the man, an excuse to get gussied up and show how his larger-than-life persona could be channeled into something good, something pure.
Master Erskine hums, leaning forward, observing the boy with a critical eye. “He is so much bigger than you. You must have known you couldn’t win.”
“I know that!” Steve says, his jaw tight and voice a touch too loud and way more aggressively defensive than Tony had been expecting. “You shouldn’t joke about that stuff, Tony.”
Rhodey reiterates, “So, if you’re putting a cop car on a building – even a fake one – it’s gotta be without me; got it?”
Rhodey/Romulus is Antony’s close friend and a scholar. His real name is Julianus Rabirius (Rabiria being a real minor plebian family of senatorial rank in Ancient Rome), but Tony nicknames him Romulus after the mythical founder of Rome.
I could make you laugh, laugh until you wet yourself, until you fall to your knees, shaking and clutching your chest, your diaphragm aches, and you can’t draw your next breath, until tears are streaming down your cheeks and you suffocate with a final gasping wheeze, as a testament to just how damn funny I can be. It must have been the best joke in the world – a joke worth dying for – that’s what they’ll say when they see your broken, twisted body in tortured repose, eyes bulging and a Cheshire grin frozen permanently on your face. I could make that happen.
“Hey Winghead! Catch!” Tony tosses Steve a minifigure painted in the likeness of Captain America. “I thought since he’s going to be more-or-less a permanent fixture of the Avengers, he should at least look like himself.”
He needs Steve angry.
However, as luck would have it, Stefanus doesn’t stay amongst the retiarii long. With the most recent munus complete, Priscus finds himself short of secutors, allowing Erasmus his choice of losing retiarii to retrain into his class.
Steve gives him an odd look, his brows drawn together. “Don’t you have to return to MIT eventually?”
Master Phillips taps down on Steve’s shoulders, making him crouch all that much deeper. “Jedi forswear all attachments.”
And of course, Tony has to be a dick about it. “Really, Steve? A lesbian? Why do you always have to like the permanently-unavailable ones?”
Steve falls back into his seat on the log.
Once Steve has retrieved the supplies, he opens up Tony slow, pushing his fingers gently into Tony’s entrance, allowing him to enjoy the stretch as he nibbles along his jawline and down his neck to suck at his collar.
“You are spared,” he whispers, still in disbelief, in awe. “You are safe.”
He seems to consider it. “He was stern,” he replies, “Old and wrinkled, that kind of jowly you get when you’ve only ever frowned your whole life. He also had a giant stick up his ass. Not that surprising though. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree; you clearly learned that from him.”
Master Phillips’s voice whispers from the back of Steve’s mind.
What follows is a crash of porcelain followed by a shout, and then Tony is there, trying to pull his father off his boyfriend.
not Steve.
Again.
“Tony. How is my favorite partner in crime these days? Enjoying the fresh air, are you?” When Stark doesn’t reply, he drawls on, “Let me guess: The world has already devolved into chaos and you’ve come to spring your old friend Purple Man from the clink so we can fix it, change it all back to what it was before. It was so much easier then, wasn’t it, back when everyone was of the same mind?”
“Steve Rogers has
Tony narrows his eyes. “Careful, darling. People may take that the wrong way, and there’s only so many bruises I can explain away by saying I ran into a door.”
At least until he meets honeybear.
Tony rolls his eyes.
“If you believe that, then you can wait another eight or nine hours to call.” Rhodey looks pointedly at the clock. “Besides, it’s like 1 a.m. He’s probably asleep. If you’re going to confess your eternal, undying love, don’t you want him to be awake to appreciate it?”
Stark tugs at the cloth belt at Steve’s waist until it becomes loose in his hand.
Tony explains anyway. “There was a Last Unicorn convention where all extant unicorns get together and fight it out for the title of Last Unicorn standing. It’s supposed to be ironic, I guess.” As if unicorns are capable of understanding irony. “Sparky here is the grand champion for the second year running, especially after I redesigned her armor.”
“Fair.”
“Hey, you ever run into anyone you knew from… well, from before?” he asks.
He can’t outrun them.
“I wasn’t the one who could have saved her,” his father replies, the admission harsh and clearly painful for him. “She loved someone else.”
“You’ve never been kissed?”
Though it might be easier to do so if his former partners weren’t accosting him every fifteen minutes, Tony supposes.
“Are you certain? It is rather–”
with men, and it just became legal in Massachusetts, so is anyone really going to be surprised you jumped on the chance to elope with some muscle-bound Brad Pitt look-alike so soon after your last failed engagement? Look, I’m no expert in what gets you going, but Captain Rogers is considered easy on the eyes. He’s exactly your type.”
Tony grits his teeth. “I mean I see perfectly fine.”
He wants to go down right now and introduce himself, but maybe that will come across as too eager, too desperate, like when he had gone to lunch on the first day of school and realized he didn’t know where to sit because he was too new and too young and everyone else already had friends from middle school. He had come to realize that the key to being cool was being aloof, but by then, it was too late. His reputation as a needy baby had already been cemented.
But Rhodey captures Tony’s hands in his own and pins him to the couch. “Tones, think about what you’re doing!” he says urgently, his eyes wide and slightly bloodshot.
Steve gives him a look. “Is it really that difficult to believe I’m here of my own free will?”
“Is your sister aiming to take over as paterfamilias once your father has passed?” Antony quips. “How progressive.”
“You know I care about you, Antony, and I would love to spend the rest of my life with you…”
“I was talking to Mr. Tall, Blond, and Handsome,” he continues, passing the beer to Steve. “Raul is here tonight. You should say hi.”
“He’s a man.”
“It’s stupid.”
“Then we’ll figure it out together.”
am not good enough for
“Do you… do you not like that I shop for you?” he asks.
Tony agrees, and after the adults leave, the other boy shoves his hands in his pockets. “The name’s Steve.”
“Every goddamn day. I can’t afford not to.”
Tony leans back in his conference chair, his head tilted and fingers fanned over the side of his face from chin to temple. “Cap, your suit,” he says.
Tony quickly comes to regret his choice of assistant.
“Of course, sweetheart.”
No one responds, which is somewhat foreboding but not exactly surprising. Zombies aren’t the only danger in the wastes.
And he does. Try, that is. He tries, but he can’t shake his curiosity. Tony had lost his virginity, but to whom? There were really only a small number of likely candidates, and his memory goes into overdrive trying to recall the whereabouts of each one on the night in question.
It’s late one night when they’ve made sundaes and settled down to watch a movie on the large projector screen in his former game room that Tony finally feels ready to open up, just a little. “So there’s this guy–”
As a reminder, Tiberius Stone is Tiberius Servilius Priscus Structus. He is Pierce’s nephew. The Servilii gens were a very powerful, prestigious patrician family that later had plebian branches. The branch of the family with the cognomen Priscii (meaning “antique”) remained patricians and often carried the agnomen Structus. They continued to have great influence through the Republic and into the Imperial period. All that is to say that Ty is of a significantly higher social rank compared to Tony, though they may be equal in wealth.
Steve’s lip twists with annoyance as he rests his hands on his waist. “Is this really the time to nitpick semantics?”
,” he repeats, completely flabbergasted that Steve had somehow missed that not-so-tiny detail. And too
“For the treatment of…”
That won’t do.
Steve watches the exchange with dawning horror. Oh God. What if it’s Bruce? How could Steve possibly please Tony if he’s been with the Hulk? The sheer dimensions alone would–
“Yeah.”
But Director Fury is undeterred. “You did that just a few months ago.”
The title means “Either fuck me, or let’s fight” and is from a poem recorded by Martial. He references this epigram supposedly written by Octavian (the future Augustus Caesar) to insult a powerful female opponent Fulvia, whose third husband was Mark Antony, in defense of his own dirty poetry.
The man looks down then. “That was too far, and I would understand if you wanted to make a complaint to Director Fury,” he says. “I’ll uh… I’ll be out of the tower by the end of the day.”
When they’re safely in hyperdrive, he swivels his chair to face Steve. “Did you… what did you do back there?”
“You’re not reporting me to the brass?”
“A lot of late nights spent at the office?” Purple Man guesses.
“What do you think of this blue?” Antony says, holding up a bolt of expensive cotton fabric to Stefanus’s tunic. “I think it brings out your eyes.”
“It’s not my fault bullies tend to be on the bigger side.”
Ireland, but that’s not important.
“Well then, good thing I ain’t one. I’m just sayin’ so it’s out there… You can drop the act. I already find you attractive,” Steve says, a touch exasperated. “So… what do you say?”
Tony cups his hands around his mouth to project his voice. “Anyone home?” Clint nudges his shoulder to silence him, while Tony turns to face him, completely oblivious. “What?”
“Okay, spill. What’s her name, winghead?”
“Okay fine,” Tony declares. “But I’m hiring you to make a logo for a new division of Stark Industries. I’m thinking green energy or something.”
And so Purple Man reclines onto his cot, his arms folded behind his head, and laughs and laughs and laughs.
He’s not.
“Based on the size and development of the flowers, your condition is quite advanced.” J.A.R.V.I.S. pauses, likely calculating his prognosis. “Projected life span at current rate of decompensation: four to six weeks.”
But the boy had finished it out of anger, whether natural or from a deep-seated rage at his circumstances. Master Phillips isn’t sure which, but he has seen enough. “We about done here?” he asks Master Erskine.
“Did I lie?”
Master Phillips had. A strong pull, a hook, a tantalizing itch in his subconscious screams at him. There is a source radiating raw Force energy nearby, beckoning him closer.
“All?”
He is a block away when something else captures his eye causing him pause, another errant script tucked into the side wall:
Master Erskine had reviewed the file of one Steven Rogers. Orphaned at age four, he had been fostered out to a series of homes before landing in the group home ten months prior. Since then, he had been involved in a series of unexplained incidents and subsequently racked up a long list of demerits. The director of the establishment seems eager to be rid of him and is even willing to waive the customary waiting period and adoption fee, though he had heavily hinted that a donation in exchange for a speedy process would not be remiss.
They didn’t.
kissing?” Stark leans forward. “You thinking about kissing me?” he asks, his voice low, almost sultry.
“And why did they think that?”
“I am more than just thinking about it. I have already offered to take him in as a Jedi Initiate,” Master Erskine states, his tone still frustratingly calm and even, further raising Master Phillips’s hackles. “The Force is strong with this one.”
“I just–”
“Really?” Stark exclaims, throwing up his hands. “With that sour mug, color me shocked. I mean, he was clearly concerned to have hired a Mandalorian to protect you, but he didn’t have to be such an asshole about it. I gave him my best jokes, and the man never cracked a smile, not even once. Just stood there frowning, and asked ‘are you done, son?’” He plants a gloved finger in Steve’s chest. “I am a mercenary and well past my age of majority and never have I been referred to as a child, not even when I
“Well no, not exactly.”
He switches the radio back on. S-A-F-E / P-L-A-C-E, a pause, T-E-L-L / Y-O-U / T-O-M-O-R-R-O-W / H-O-P-E / O-K / N-O-W
“No, it wasn’t,” Tony says, already bracing himself for whatever fresh hell is coming their way.
Maybe Tony is his father after all.
“How about a kiss to celebrate?” Tony suggests as he clumsily maneuvers once again into the guy’s personal space.
“Is it getting any better?”
“When I first came to this cursed city, I had everything taken from me. I owned nothing, and this place… it just continued to take ever more than I thought possible,” Stefanus says, turning to look at Antony. “But then I met Bacchus, and he was… he was kind to me even when I had nothing to give. He gave me hope, a goal to work towards even when I was at my lowest. If not for him… do you know how many times I thought about it? How many times I considered murdering the men who touched me, about what I would do if I had nothing else to lose, but I couldn’t leave him alone in that place. It is what I held onto in my darkest hours.”
“Move,” says one of the stormtroopers. “Or we will move you.”
Point is there could be an innocent, nonsexual explanation.
A futurist and a man out of time walk into a restaurant, angling for a fight they don’t know they can’t win. The futurist is full of ideas, and his partner is full of ideals. They want to save the world, to make it a better place. And they do for a while. There is no war, no hunger, no pestilence. All the struggles plaguing the human condition solved within a single month. They achieve everything they’ve ever wanted…
“It’s the truth.”
hit his partner. He throws his napkin down on the table. “I think I’m done here. Come back to the room when you’re done being… you.”
“Rise and Shine, shellhead,” Steve calls out a week later, his tone chipper as he flips on the lights at an unreasonably early 10am. Tony groans and stuffs his head under a pillow while the woman beside him screams and steals all the sheets in an attempt to cover her own nudity, revealing Tony’s naked ass to Steve.
So perhaps Tony’s original intentions while embarking on this little affair weren’t exactly pure. He had seen a chink in the façade of a perfect all American hero, and he had picked at it, hoping to defile Steve, to degrade the image of Captain America as one last fuck-you to Howard and his legacy. Just imagine: the quintessential all-American hero balls-deep in an all-too-American monster.
His tone seems to cow Steve. “It’s just… I thought you only liked women,” he nearly whispers.
He decides to keep it.
Tony looks put out. “That obvious, huh?”
That’s it.
“School just hasn’t been the same without you,” Jacques says as they sit in the shade of a large tree, the weather too hot and muggy for much else. “Freddy’s been trying to horn in on Peggy since you’ve been gone.”
So, maybe Steve is not ready to settle down exactly. He’s not looking for forever – has learned that forever is never guaranteed to begin with, no matter his partner – but he could spend the next two years or however long he’s got with Tony, living each day as it comes like the gift that it is.
His piano lessons stopped that very summer after he had begged his father to stay, and he hadn’t seen his ex-piano teacher again until he was thrown out of his mother’s funeral, caviar smeared over his black suit. Perhaps Tony had always known…
it is impossible to avoid. Even your grumpy asshole of a master must have cared for you. He must have felt you were special because despite whatever bullshit vow he made to the Order or the Force or whatever, his attachment to you inspired him to reach out to me to ensure you lived through whatever hair-brained scheme he tried to pull off.”
It hadn’t been a “yes.”
“Move in with me,” Tony blurts out, “Into my room. We can convert your room into the nursery.” He cringes internally. Maybe he’s being a touch forward and so he explains, “My room is bigger, and your room is in the right spot, far enough away so that she shouldn’t wake up Bruce or Nat.”
“There’s a good man.”
Just then, the lights turn on, and there’s a commotion in the foyer as a duo of police officers muscle their way through the front door and announce themselves. Mr. Big Hands swears, grabs Tony, and hurries them out the back, getting lost in the flood of underage partygoers fleeing the cops.
“Does it… does it always hurt?” Suibne asks, the words nearly unintelligible in heavily-accented Latin.
“That can be arranged.”
By the look on Steve’s face, he probably doesn’t have to; the man has eyes and is smart enough to put two and two together.
It changes nothing.
Dracula must have come to the same conclusion. “Perhaps I have been a touch… hasty. You will protect Anthony?” he inquires.
There are things Tony missed about being a child: the endless potential, a metabolism that can’t be beat, and hell, being able to turn his head all the way to the left after sleeping on it wrong.
His mother had stopped by the game room, the mansion’s newest residents in tow. “Tony honey, have you met Ms. Sarah?”
“And…” he prompts.
Steve is quiet at home, much more pensive than usual. When Tony asks him if he wants to play Avengers, Steve declines, instead inquiring, “Have you really already kissed a lot of girls, shellhead?”
“Antony–”
Until then, at least he has Bacchus.
“This might come as a shock, but not everyone finds me as lovable as you do.”
A man can’t eat pride.
“You will be back in Boston by Monday,” Howard orders him. “This is not up for discussion.”
“Answer the question. What did he look like?”
Having come to his decision, Steve nods.
“Tell him to lose the uniform.”
“The ink isn’t even dry, and we’re already suffering from a dead bedroom,” he laments, delicately holding up a crumpled flower, turning it this way and that in contemplation. “What happened to the man I married? Where’s your sense of adventure? Of passion and romance?”
“We– we’re not...” Steve blusters, settling on, “I’m still intact.”
“…Why are you wearing dark glasses inside the house?” Steve asks with all the bluntness of his eleven years. “Are you blind? Do you need help finding your cane?” He surveys the general vicinity, looking for the signature white cane of the visually-impaired. “There’s a blind kid in my class, and sometimes she wears sunglasses indoors, too.”
Rhodey turns to Steve. “Can you hold his blasters for five minutes?”
“It is not what most would prefer, no.”
“Not when it’s a lie.”
“I do not think they would appreciate such fine craftsmanship, but thank you… perhaps I can wear it to your father’s victory feast.”
Antony broods upon a marble bench amidst the carefully cultivated hedges in the peristylium. He finds no joy in the elaborate fountain, in the beautiful shrubbery and flowers of the enclosed garden as he contemplates recent events. Antony can now admit that when Stefanus had made his plea, he reacted… poorly. Perhaps it was base jealousy that another could occupy the man’s heart in such a fashion or it was Antony’s encounter with Tiberius earlier that day that set him on edge, but they are poor excuses indeed, because the result remained the same. Antony had been tested and ultimately proven himself unworthy of the man’s trust. He had feared losing Stefanus, and instead of dealing with it in an appropriate manner, he had given into fear and became just another man who hurts Stefanus deeply, intimately, just another who would force him to submit glassy-eyed and unresponsive to his unwanted touch. And now, Antony reaps the fruits of his actions, all the shame and regret and loss filling his very being. He hadn’t gone through with it, but the threat, the way he had exerted his unspoken power over Stefanus will alter their relationship irreparably, if he can hope to salvage it at all. Would Stefanus ever forgive him? He didn’t think it likely, but that was no reason to not try to make things right.
As luck would have it, Julia is quite nice. She listens to him talk about his relationship with Tiberius, about how he had tried so hard for so little, and sympathizes with his plight.
And now Stark has Steve apologizing to
Maybe then, he can finally get some uninterrupted shut-eye.
“Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has just declared himself Emperor and dissolved the Republic to form the Galactic Empire under his rule,” Rhodey reports.
Stark.”
In short: someone to straighten him out.
But that doesn’t stop Steve from wanting.
“Oh, uh… Christmas, then?”
“I know what you’re thinking, but a lot of people use therapy. It’s not a… you don’t have to be… I just think you may benefit from professional,
“Did you lose another bet to Stark?” he asks Steve the following morning.
“…Perhaps some archery practice is in order,” Dum Dum pivots instead. “Percival could use the practice. He near missed half his shots during the last skirmish at the behest of Lord Phillips.”
“That vappa ac nebulo, that cursed bearer-of-filth,” a familiar gravelly voice grumbles, a quiet sort of rage behind the invective.
“It’s okay. You’re not obligated to do anything. We really can stop at any time if you don’t–”
“It’s kind of hard, you know,” Steve says. He doesn’t look up as he clarifies, “Moving sucks. I liked where we were living, and I miss my friends. I didn’t want to leave, but Mom says this neighborhood is better.”
“And I…” –
“You mean sex?”
“Brothers,” he concludes with a nod, “If not by blood, then by circumstance.”
drinking for two after all,” he decides. He turns back to Tony, clasping him by the shoulders with both hands. “We should invite your partner. Let us leave no one out.”
“I don’t kiss and tell,” Stark states evenly.
“Lead the way.”
“I can get you more,” Rhodey offers.
“My place or yours?” Tony says coyly.
“But… six months?”
Luckily, Rhodey runs a ship repair yard, and Stark’s ship, stripped as it is, passes as exactly the type of clunker he normally collects for spare parts. They enter virtually undetected, allowing Stark to get to work making his ship space-worthy once again.
And so Hadrianus rephrases his inquiry. “Are you trying to ruin me?” he spits out.
“Seems like your problem has a pretty simple solution.”
But the man insists. “I need it. I’ll buy it. Besides, it will make a great addition to my private bath. An inspiration really.” His voice drops low. “Perhaps you can accompany me in the bath later, and we can… appreciate the arts. Together. People say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.”
“You think we can pick up a pie on the way back? Apple with the lattice top from that one place. You know the one, across from that fancy grocery store. It’s Steve’s favorite.”
“You’re still a child yet. Sometimes, it takes a while…” Mr. Morelli plays a sample of the new music, his tanned fingers moving deftly across the ivories. “And a little practice.”
“It was Dum Dum what started it,” Percival accuses.
Steve is about to respond but stops himself. The fae didn’t specify when the vow should start, and he’d rather not risk any assumptions. He motions to his mouth, his throat, but keeps mum.
Bacchus can only smile and rest his own hand over Stefanus’s to reassure him. “I will see you at the winner’s feast after,” he says before turning to gather his weighted net with practiced ease as well as his trident. He palms the long handle, tossing it lightly to test the balance. “I hear tell Pompeia will be there, and she may offer you a discount after such a… riveting performance.”
“What happens now?”
Just then Steve walks in with nary a limp. His super healing must have worked quickly as there isn’t even a trace of what had happened the night before in his gait. No stiffness, no favoring of his backside. Nothing. He is a sturdy one; not that there had been any doubt about that.
Steve doesn’t break his stride, bringing his lightsaber down then around, fluidly turning to face Stark’s direction as he execute the next moves. “You don’t seem to have any trouble, and not one of your partners has ever seen your face. How one’s face looks hardly seems relevant.”
“If you’re having so much trouble following guidelines, how about I simplify it then, make it easier for you to remember: No talking. Period.” Tony flips onto his knees and elbows and spreads his legs. “Now, fuck me like you mean it.” When Steve doesn’t immediately shuffle over and slide back in, Tony looks over his shoulder. “What are you waiting for? A written invitation?”
Steve draws his lightsaber, and tosses off the first saber cat with a forceful wave of his hand. That draws the attention of the remaining two, who growl at the intruder, unwilling to relinquish their prey.
And so when the Avengers meet up for their biweekly team-bonding gathering in the Avengers’ Tower, Tony makes it his mission to antagonize the man.
Rhodey’s reply is deathly serious. “You looking for a real answer?”
“Really?”
"Lead the way."
Stark sighs, sits back and starts to chuckle. “Okay, fine. The Force. At least we’re not dead.”
“We just got to keep moving, take it day by day,” Steve tells Tony, ever pragmatic. “That’s how we survive.”
“Shall I inform Captain Rogers?”
“About that thing you were talking about, you know, before dinner.” Steve’s jaw becomes hard, his lips thin.
Purple Man is getting better at this, or Rogers really does want to make Stark feel better given he has no choice in the matter. Either way, this isn’t how he wanted to spend his evening. He looks down at his watch. “This is getting dull, and we really should be getting back to implementing your plans for clean water in Ethiopia. Why don’t we move this along?” He sits back and steeples his fingers.
“I will, Fidelis,” Bacchus confirms, and Stefanus knows he speaks true.
“Fuck him.”
“Of course it is.”
“Greedy. You’re being greedy,” Tony grouses. He hunches over then thinks better of it as he tries to stand taller, his back straight, almost overextended in his attempt to become eye level with Steve. “Why not save some height for the rest of us mere mortals?”
Tony’s next arrow spears the dirt two feet short of the target.
“Stay,” he says, his breath warm against Tony’s ear.
There’s something about it that rubs Tony the wrong way, riling up the fighting spirit he had always reserved for Howard. “You got something you want to say?”
“What do you mean ‘theoretically’?” Stark asks, his fingers curling into quotation marks.
“You did not have to, not with your face so drawn.”
“Steve?” Tony says, his good eye zeroing in on the newcomer.
They’re both wearing entirely too much clothing, a problem Tony quickly remedies by unbuttoning Steve’s shirt with his teeth while he makes quick work of Steve’s button fly.
the electorate. Mayhap it would be best if I employed the services of a bodyguard, a man trained in the martial ways to accompany me as I make my rounds drumming up support. For the good of my paterfamilias, of course.”
“That is a distinct possibility,” Stark allows, swallowing down another bite of stew.
Antony’s fingers slip along the crack of his ass as if he wants to hurt Stefanus like Stefanus is hurting him. When that inspires no reaction, Antony presses a blunt thumb against his hole until it gives. Stefanus’s body goes taut. He sucks in a breath, shakes his head no. His body is too tight, his muscles tense as he takes the abuse.
Steve simply glares at his unwanted visitor. “Why are you here, Tony?”
The antechamber is full of various treasures stacked upon each other – chariots, linen boxes inlaid with gold and lapis, other belongings and small figurines representing servants and vassals to serve the pharaoh in the afterlife strewn across fine tables carved into stylized animals – and a doorway to their right leading to the burial chamber flanked by life-size statues of his personal bodyguards.
And another:
“No, it wasn’t.”
“Careful,” Stark admonishes them as the sounds come to a stop. “These devices are delicate, and I cannot have you throwing them about.”
“I used the Force,” Steve replies simply, finally removing the seat harness so he can breathe easy again.
the bed? Could he really generate that much power as a top? And to be so blasé about this occurrence… Clint didn’t know he had it in him.
His father is the first to emerge with Mamma following shortly after, sounding distraught. “I’m sorry, Howard.”
He looks at the public advertisement of the munera pasted outside the Forum, tracing Ignatius’s name with his forefinger.
goes unsaid. “Rhodes has always been better at managing your worst impulses anyway, at funneling them into something less damaging.”
Ancient Roman naming convention allowed for up to three or four names. The first name (praenomen) is a personal name. The second name (nomen) is a family surname and the most important of the three. Some people had a third name (cognomen) which was at various times, a nickname or a way to identify a particular branch within the family. Occasionally, it highlighted an individual’s achievement, usually in warfare. Some people even earned a fourth name (agnomen) for additional victories. The upperclass usually used the third name to refer to each other. For instance, Caesar’s name was Gaius Julius Caesar and Cicero’s name (sometimes known as Tully in English) was Marcus Tullius Cicero. However, not everyone had a third name (e.g. Mark Antony’s name was Marcus Antonius). In English the –us is often dropped from Roman names, so Marcus Antonius becomes Marc Antony, Plinius becomes Pliny, Constantinus becomes Constantine, etc.
For Tony.
Every time, Steve asks if he’s considered calling any of them – Natalie, Becky, Stacey, or Bea – and every time, he seems disappointed when Tony says he has not. Tony doesn’t understand how to get it through his thick skull: he isn’t interested in anything more than a single night’s romp. With
“What is it you want, Tony? I can call you Tony, right? After all, we will be working together rather closely,” Purple Man had said, leaning in close so the man couldn’t miss his influence. “You must have plans. A man like you – one who has everything – why would you risk your life flying around in that contraption? Iron Man, the Avengers – this can’t be the extent of your vision.”
“I could have something made for you for when you accompany me on my social calls,” Antony reasons, passing the fabric to the seller and pointing to the bolt Stefanus had selected. “I’ll take this and the red wool over there. The one edged in gold.”
Dad looks up, and is immediately displeased. “Tony, what–”
Steve exits the bathroom shortly after, toweling his hair dry. He gives Tony a cursory glance. “I’m sure you would have gotten lucky if you didn’t try to hit on both of them at the same time,” he tells him.
“He’s a willful one,” the slaver divulges. When the buyer goes for Suibne’s mouth, he warns him, “and he bites.” The fingers pause. “But his teeth are good. He has the full set, except at the very back. Those haven’t come in yet. He’s likely fairly young, and his beard may take years to come in.”
It’s too late; Steve has already felt the anomaly.
“The Jedi High Council tried to stage a coup to depose him. They failed, but the Chancellor has declared the entire Order traitors to the Republic. They’re slaughtering them all across the galaxy. Summary execution by their clone subordinates.”
Stark secures the strip behind Steve’s head with a knot.
. It saddens his friend that he would choose to be alone, as if Steve himself hasn’t made the self-same choice, granted without the fun of actual sex.
“You Jedi… aren’t you clairvoyant?” The Mandalorian asks before simply shrugging at Steve’s silence. “He said there was something wrong, a rot in the Republic they were trying to identify and root out. He worried that if they failed, there would be repercussions for the Jedi.” He looks down at the pile of dead clone soldiers. “Seems he was right.” He holds out his hand for a shake. “The name’s Stark, by the way. Tony Stark.”
“You did.”
The Stark Energizer satellite should maintain Purple Man’s hold on Stark, like it has the Avengers and the general populace, but still, Purple Man never leaves his side. He can feel it sometimes, Stark testing the bounds of his mental captivity, tapping at the purple ties that bind them together in his mind. He’s not strong enough, will never be strong enough, not at this range.
“Yeah. Tell me something I don’t know.”
That gets their attention.
Luckily, Steve is of the same mind as he walks off, but then he pauses at the door. He turns around to look back at Tony, still naked and tangled in a sheet, his hair wild and skin slicked with lube, sweat, and drying cum. Tony’s breathing has grown shallow, but Steve must chalk that up to their recent activities because he doesn’t mention it.
“I’ve fought and beaten quite a few vampires in my day,” Steve grasps his steak knife tightly, cutting another ragged slice of blood sausage and spearing it along with a piece of stewed apple. “Hitler had many in his army.”
“You don’t think he can like… turn invisible, right?” Rhodey inquires. “Is that a thing Jedi can do?”
But Purple Man doesn’t let up. “Look at him, Stark,” he says instead, his tone low, dangerous. Stark complies, gazing down at the way the sweat glistens off Rogers’s trembling, flexing muscles, at the exquisite pain evident in the visible half of his face turned to the side, cheek resting against the desktop, sliding back and forth in time to his thrusts. “I want you to feel this.
