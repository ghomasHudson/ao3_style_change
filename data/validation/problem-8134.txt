Steve looked down at his phone and smiled. "Hello, Tony."
Tony frowned. "He's going to ache if he sleeps like that all night. We should take him to bed."
"Yeah, of course."
"No problem. No let's run this a couple times. We're going to do great."
"Come on, girly." Ness and Maggie walked back to the living room.
Black Widow didn't answer. She attacked.
"JARVIS doesn't know when to stop. Like Mr. Stark, I think he's a bit paranoid." Peter sighed.
Peter blushed and headed to the elevator. He could hear Wade laughing quietly. And Strange scolding him quietly. "You're such a child, Wilson."
"I'm not an idiot." Thor defended himself.
She nodded.
She needed out.
"Hello, everyone." He put his jacket and a bag down on a side table. The wood creaked.
"Huh?" Ned asked.
Peter snorted. "It's okay, even us humans rarely know how to answer that question. And remember, you can call me Peter. Mr. makes me feel weird."
The screams wouldn't stop.
"Why not just give him access to my blueprints? I mean, I messed them up on purpose. He doesn't strike me as the tech-smart kind. He probably won't be able to figure out what's wrong with it."
"Thanks, Peter." She nodded. "And thanks...for the suit, you guys...really didn't have to."
Steve nodded and kissed Peter's neck. "Sorry, Pete. I just...didn't want to let that man stick around."
"Yes." He answered immediately.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nice to meet you." Peter shook his hand.
"You talking to me?" Peter asked. "Can't be. Anyone with an IQ knows spiders are arachnids. Wait...do you not have an IQ?"
"Okay. Close your eyes, Margaret. Relax."
"It's okay, Cape-y. You didn't know." Maggie pet it gently.
"If you think this is hell, you're wrong. Believe me, this is only the beginning." He leaned forward into her face. "If you don't start behaving, you'll be in pieces when I'm done with you."
"Right here, Maggie, isn't it?" Tony gestured to a plating of food.
Dr. Strange looked from Maggie to Wade, then nodded. "Of course. Any questions or concerns, call me." He turned, created a different portal and vanished.
She wheezed and gasped, coughing and gagging. "I don't know."
"Keep it easy for now. If you don't, you'll only be on light duty for longer and I'll tattle to Steve on you. Seems he's feeling really righteous and protective right now." She nodded to the TV, where the press conference had just ended.
"And you, Captain Rogers."
Vanessa bent forward and kissed Maggie's cheek before she leaned back in her chair and opened her phone.
Peter felt a hand land on his shoulder. It was good, because while his presentation had gone okay, he felt horribly nervous. The hand on his shoulder wasn't normal. Tony'd usually wrap his whole arm over Peter's shoulders, but this was just a firm, steadying hand. More like a mentor, less like a father. Which was good. Tony moved him slightly from the podium with his good hand and he took center stage.
"Yeah, that place."
"Sounds like a plan. And not just for magic-y stuff, okay?"
Her heart pounded in her chest. No. She didn't have time for a panic attack. She needed to move. She rolled and saw it.
"No problem, knock 'em dead. Okay?"
"Oh, do you care for that intern? He's a smart boy, I could use a mind like that. Think he'll fair better or worse than you did?"
"I'm going to try to keep this short. I'm not a fan of bullies. It's pretty well documented."
Peter knew she was bragging him up to try to be nice, but he really wished that she'd shut up. His spidersense was growing more and more crazy with each word she spoke. He could almost feel the evil, calculating gears in Stane's head turning.
"I can. Don't act like you haven't already stalked her."
"The stronger you get, the stronger they'll get. The visions show up in your dreams because that's when your mind is really at its most vulnerable. The more your power asserts itself though, the more on guard you're going to have to be. You have to be able to direct it, control it. Or it will overwhelm you some day." Strange frowned.
Strange shook his head. "That's not what I mean. I'll always be here. But I'm not going to put myself in that place. That's her choice. She's had enough of her control taken from her. She should get to choose. I can only show her and offer it to her. The rest is her choice."
"Ow." She hissed through her teeth. It thankfully was just water...but god it was hot.
"Just a little distracted."
I almost titled this chapter 'Dun Dun Duuuuuuunnnnnnn!' but then I didn't. Haha
"You're thinking too much, that's all." Peter promised. "Here. I'll show you. Close your eyes and just do what you feel like you're supposed to do." Peter took the lead and Steve listened, closing his eyes. Peter led him and Steve followed without missing a beat. "See? Subtle. But you know exactly where we're going at all times, right?"
Upon re-reading this I felt a little weird, so explanation time. I initially wrote some training scenes with Maggie and Dr. Strange as part of some foreshadowing and they actually worked really well together character-wise. I just got this father-daughter vibe from them, so I kept writing more to discover that and I liked it so much that it's now a thing. This doesn't mean he's replacing Vanessa and Wade. But earlier in her story she already doesn't view them as parental figures, even calling them 'Wade' and 'Vanessa' rather than mom and dad or even aunt or uncle.
"I just want this over. I want my family safe. I want my life back. I felt like I haven't fully had control since Afghanistan. The thing is...I'm more in control than ever, of me. And I have so many more people that make life worthwhile in a way it never did before. Now he wants to take that too. He can't have it. He can't have what's mine."
"Are you ready?"
Steve smiled. They had good friends, they really did.
"Um, I was going to help Tracy today. I didn't think you'd be down here." Peter didn't need to be babysat in the tower. It irritated him. Nat already followed him to school. Clint had picked him up and driven him to dance and searched the place top to bottom. Happy barely let him get on the elevator in the tower alone. It had been two days of constant surveillance and it was getting a bit annoying. Peter knew he could take care of himself. Plus, he had Karen and JARVIS in the tower. If he got into anything he couldn't handle all he had to do was talk to one of them and the wrath of the Avengers would rain on his enemies.
Steve huffed out a breath.
Maggie shook her head and looked up. This person was obviously tall, towering over her. "He's wearing a fish bowl."
Tony nodded, took a deep breath and launched after the drones.
"Any time, friendly neighborhood Spiderman helps frenemies too."
"Don't leave, okay?"
"They went home for a bit. To shower and get you some comfy clothes. They'll be back soon."
"Is no one else stressed out by a fourteen year old kid standing on the edge of a roof, poised to jump?" Tony asked.
"Need help with the rest?" Strange asked.
Peter sighed and lay in his bed and decided to actually listen to Maggie's message. It must've been shortly after they'd all texted. Peter'd shut his phone off so it wouldn't interrupt him. He wanted to listen to it just in case there was something else in it aside from presentation stuff. He opened it and hit play.
Her vision blurred as he pulled again on her hair and slammed her head against the wall again. Every time that spot hit the wall, it hurt worse.
"Hello, my little flower."
"You're telling me you can't find our girl?" Vanessa asked. "What does that mean? You can fucking see everything. You see more than the NSA!"
She closed her eyes. Maybe Strange was right. Maybe not all of her slips through time would be death and despair.
"No judgement." Peter said raising his hands. He could tell via context she hadn't really had a childhood. If she'd felt safe when she'd been accidently made a child, then who was he to judge. He was just glad people had been there for her when she was so small and vulnerable. "Didn't know your dad could smile."
"Oh, come on, be real with yourself." Peter said.
"Head hurts."
"M-me too." Maggie pouted.
"Yes, please."
There was a loud bang above.
"No baths. Keep the pressure wraps on as long as you can. Don't soak them. If they come off..." Strange glanced at the Wilsons. He schooled his face quickly, but there was a twinge of mistrust. "When they come off, call me, I'll change them."
The kid was sabotaging his own work. Altering it in little ways that made it impossible to work. Peter, would be the only one who knew that it was different. That meant the kid suspected he was being watched. Had Tony tipped him off that someone was looking for power? Peter couldn't have known on his own. "Stark warned the kid to watch his step."
"Annnnnnnnnnd I look good in red. Look, you two figure it out. I'm not picking a side. It's not fair." Peter raised his hands.
"Uh...hi?"
Peter looked away too.
Not-Wade asked her if she was alright.
Strange paused. "Miles Davis?"
Peter stared with wide eyes. "You didn't list ballet." She was amazing at ballet. She didn't go to a professional school, but she could BE a professional.
Peter looked at Maggie. "Are you okay?"
"Oh, honey, I can make this last for DAYS."
"Umm... Can I leave my gloves?" Maggie asked.
"Chicken?" Peter added.
The man pulled the needle from her neck, then began to pat down her pockets. He slipped his hand into her back pocket. "There it is." He pulled her phone out. "That's what I needed."
"How? I'll handle it. Interdimensional food ordering isn't covered on most phones."
"Are you distracted?" He asked quietly.
"I'm feeling really anxious right now. Like eight out of ten anxious." His breaths came in little pants as he looked over the edge.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yes, it's because you're all sore losers." The movie started, with singing. Tony groaned and covered an ear with his functioning hand. "Dammit, I can't even cover both my ears!"
"Scary. She'd need a good teacher. Good thing she has one." Wong nodded. "And she's a good kid. It's good when powerful mutations or abilities end up in caring hands rather than vengeful hands."
"Um...I left you a present. We didn't talk about it...but you'll find out when you put the mask on and um...land safely. Um..." Tony suddenly pulled Peter into a hug. "Are you sure you don't want to start on a smaller building?"
"And there goes all our hard work." A low voice drawled.
"Thanks." Peter hugged him. "How do you do that?"
"Oh, fuck." Maggie huffed out in pain as she was hit with a kick to the chest, as if she weren't already struggling with breathing due to smoke inhalation. "Okay then. Time to fight dirty." This is what she trained with Wade for.
This...was probably what hell looked like.
Peter headed into the tower through the window.
A man climbed up over the side of the roof. He had four metal arms strapped on him.
"I don't want to leave him alone." The kid had literally just had a damn flashback of his dead aunt. Steve did not want to leave his son alone. What if he woke up alone? What if he had a nightmare? Steve didn't want him to be alone.
Maggie's eyes widened. She didn't touch people often. So she knew what Wade's hands felt like. She knew that his hands were always much warmer than her. And the texture of his skin... This wasn't Wade. The scars looked accurate, but didn't FEEL right. And his hands were cold. This wasn't Wade. That meant...none of it was real. They weren't making nightmares come true. If that were the case, if it were a power, then the people would be accurate not just in appearance, but in feel too.
"I'll look." He promised with a nod.
"Oh." He'd taken time away from the sanctum when she was unwell? Wasn't he in charge of protecting their whole dimension? Why was he sitting in a med bay with her when she was perfectly fine and with her guardians? She tried not to look at him like he was an idiot, she knew what that felt like. Instead, she rolled with it. "Okay. Can I go home?" She looked at Wade and Vanessa.
Peter ran for the edge of the building. And threw himself forward. He swung about to come in sight of the Tower when Maggie damn near collided with him.
"Hey, bud." Steve called and walked to him, sitting next to his bed. "You good?"
"Yeah." She nodded. Then she looked at her bag, following his gaze. "I pack light. I'm not fancy. Only carry what you need, you know?"
Take care.
She rolled her eyes. "Jesus. How strong are you?"
"Yeah."
"Oh, shit, yeah." Peter ran to help his dad.
Tony pointed to Peter. "You told her who I am?"
"Yes, ma'am." Tony saluted her.
"I also got extra. Didn't know if you were enhanced or not. I'm used to feeding super metabolisms though."
"Traumatized teen in the room." Peter called before dropping from the ceiling and pulling off his mask.
"Sorry." Maggie took another breath and relaxed.
"Yeah, she's my dance partner. My life is just...so complicated."
"What's going on?" Steve asked.
"Ran into Mr. Stane."
"You don't screen my calls anymore, got it?" Maggie poked his shoulder. "It's a nine-hour difference, but still, don't screen my calls."
"That's not an answer, Peter." The voice answered. "Hmm. I'll choose then."
"Show me where she went. I'll find her." Tony said gently.
"You okay? You keep doing that." Peter commented.
"Love you too." Peter whispered, and relaxed in Tony's arms as he felt a gentle kiss to his neck. "I'm not falling for it ever again. I know you."
He yanked his hand away immediately. "It was a nightmare...a bad one. I've had those too."
"It's not that bad. I've seen skulls cracked open. You're going to be alright."
"My mind is almost exclusively logic. Having a non-linear mind around is... helpful sometimes." Dr. Strange admitted. "Thank you for the suggestion. I'll see if it works, after you've gone, no need for you to get in the middle of the fight."
"What if I am?" She folded her arms over her chest.
"CAN you help?" She looked at his hands.
"Tear those stitches and I just might." He smiled up at her in that way that wrinkled his eyes, but showed he wasn't actually amused.
Tony looked down at his calculations and sighed. He couldn't tell Peter this. Not until this was all just a memory, but the kid, his son, had likely saved his life. Without the upgrades and the reinforced chest plate they'd worked on together after Christmas...Tony was pretty sure there would have been more than hairline fractures. In fact, he was pretty sure broken ribs would have been the least of his worries.
"Captain Rogers is in the medbay and would like to see you."
"So you lose your ability to help yourself." Dr. Strange sat back down. "There is balance here, Margaret. I'll help you find it. I'll make sure none of you is lost in the process. And I'll help you get stronger too. I know you're stronger than what you can do now. You haven't met your limit, not with your powers and not with your day-to-day." He nodded to her. "Breathe. Relax. But tell me what you see, what you feel. Start again. Don't lose yourself. To find balance you have to know what you can do. Let's learn that."
They watched another episode of Hannibal and Strange still seemed uneasy with Mads.
Tony frowned.
"Adorable. JARVIS, keep that one too."
Vanessa's head tilted to the side. "I didn't get it. It's cool though, kinda funky. Suits you." She grinned.
"And there are things in this building I can't see. It's weird. There's danger in directions I can't discern. That doesn't happen to me." She frowned. "Be very careful. Especially around Mr. Stane."
"Sure thing, Portman."
"Maybe... Well, he seemed to be hallucinating. I don't think I've ever really observed chemical dangers. Maybe he's poisoned?" That likely wouldn't kill him, probably would explain the hallucinations and the weird danger level. "Danger's all around him, but not really on him, not fully. He's in danger, but not...but there's no source either. I just don't get it."
"She's over-reacting, sit back down, Kate."
May limped toward him, her body shifting unnaturally. Her skin paled. Slowly, her body rotted until it collapsed in front of him.
Steve smiled gently. "You're gonna make it."
"Why?" The man asked. "Because you pissed me off. This would have been easier, if you would have just stayed put."
The door was yanked open. Dr. Strange's eyes looked down at the place where Peter's hand was on Maggie's side. His eyes lifted back up and he raised an eyebrow at Peter and leveled an impressive glare at him.
"In the building? Care to be more specific, J?" Tony asked, stress in his voice.
This time he dropped and went still.
And he wasn't disappointed. She danced like a professional to 9 to 5, her performance of straight ballet mixed with such a song...actually kind of worked. Tony appreciated her old school taste, as all the other performers before her had picked current hits, musical numbers, or classical music. He watched, amazed at her abilities.
"Of course. She'll report to me on everything pertinent, but she's yours. Have a good patrol, Peter. I'll see you once you're home." JARVIS disconnected. The red and gold associated with his interface faded from Peter's heads-up display. Then blue light filled the display instead.
"Let go of me. Fuck!" That was Maggie's voice.
Peter rolled his eyes. "Trying to teach Papa some moves. He's sorta getting it." They agreed to surprise Tony for the wedding. So they downplayed any and all progress on Steve's part, just to add to the surprise.
Strange took a deep breath of his own. They must've taken out their anger on her when Peter left. Or they'd wanted her to tell them where he went. "Okay. Mrs. Wilson, please go wait outside. Dr. Palmer and I will take care of her, okay?"
"No joke." Peter nodded. "Thanks, by the way." Peter gestured to the line they were waiting in. Ned got them both tickets to the newest Star Wars film. Peter promised he'd get the snacks. Well, technically his Dad was getting snacks. Peter didn't want to know how much was in his 'modest bank account' that Tony had set up, but Tony made sure Peter had access to it at all times. The watch Peter had not only had Karen in it, but a panic button, a tracker, and could do touch-free payments. And apparently he had a stock portfolio to make 'passive income' and assets. Apparently Pepper and Tony had put it together, Peter knew there was something about real-estate and precious metals...but Peter had just about passed out at the number when he'd seen it. He'd never be able to use that money.
"Dammit!"
The song came on and Peter took a breath, he was going to do it right this time.
"Or at least in a place with equipment, medicine, and a capable doctor." Strange corrected.
"Yup, usually is."
"Reacquainted?" Maggie squinted. With who?
"Oh, Peter." His papa knelt in front of him, dressed in his suit. "Hey, bud." His eyes were full of tears and he looked down at Peter's hand. "Oh my God, Peter... I'm so sorry." He whispered. "We're going to get you out." He pulled on the metal. It didn't budge.
Maggie gave him a look that she hoped said 'duh'.
"For act two, I'll do Polonius. Hamlet is yours though, okay?"
"Dunno. Let's go with that though. Karen, take note. They weren't knives. They were appendages."
"I should check on her. I mean, if her head was bashed in..."
"I'll take you to them." Strange promised.
"It's going to rain." She nodded.
They knew about May and Ben. About the foster homes. About Dad and Papa. The Tower wasn't safe. School wasn't safe. Dance wasn't safe.
Steve took a deep breath. He hated being a dancing monkey. But if it meant sparing Tony the pain of it, he'd jump in front of the metaphorical bullet. Especially when the man was already down a little bit. Steve looked of at the sound of an opening door, saw Pepper and smiled genuinely.
"We'll be there, soon. Okay? Hold tight, Maggie."
"We're not going to be doing anything strenuous. No overtaxing the mind. No advanced math or reading French."
"What do you mean he shoved you down?!" Steve was furious. "We need to go talk to the school."
"I've treated Margaret personally. She will be fine. She needs rest, not you being loud. Once I am finished with her treatment, you'll see her. She's doing fine. She'll heal well. But I need to finish, got it?"
Tony's head dropped. Any one of them could have been the one that took Peter. Any one of them could have changed cars at any one of those garages. There's be no way to know and...the number of possible cars just went up drastically. There'd be no way to tell for sure. It could be weeks, searching every location that every car went and that was if he was able to eliminate most of them first. "What else do we have, J?"
"Those the last words you're going for? Such a shame. You should have died in Afghanistan, Tony."
"I won't."
Peter snorted. "Super frenemies."
"Look, Ms. Black Widow, you're fighting the wrong girl." Maggie gritted out, holding Nat's batons back with her staff...barely. Maggie noticed Clint drawing back his bow. Maggie couldn't take much more. She already had cuts in her body, three wounds that would all likely need stitches. And she could barely breathe, the smoke making her feel raspy and just awful.
She sighed heavily.
Steve wrapped an arm around him and then leaned down, pressing his ear over the reactor. "Nope. Still ticking." He smiled and stood up straight, pressing a kiss to Tony's temple. "He's going to be okay. He's a good kid and a smart one. Plus, he's stronger than me."
Maggie whimpered when she heard her dad's voice. She reached out for him. Too dizzy to know which one of the three dads she saw was him.
Tony grabbed Steve. "Find Peter, get him out. We'll fight this thing."
He felt sick.
"Am I allowed to let the arachni-kid in through a window?" JARVIS asked.
Ned made a face at some of the colors. But narrowed it down to a choice between burgundy, black, or navy. "Which one do you like?"
"It's okay that it's weird. I mean, your life is...crazy."
"Peter has just entered his bedroom window. He appears healthy, sir." JARVIS said. "There were no violent altercations today, according to Karen's report and my data concurs."
"Thank you, honey." Tony sighed as he took a sip. He put the mug down and fumbled with a pill bottle. He looked tired, his hair a mess, his facial hair wasn't groomed, he was in a tank top and sleep pants, his arm in a sling. Dark bruises visible along his left side.
"What's up?" Ned asked.
"Well, shit." Tony watched as his targeting systems lit up like a Christmas tree. "That'll work. JARVIS, keep rolling on that, they may be able to give me information. Avengers, let's get rid of these things."
"You were not on floor sixteen." JARVIS said.
Peter gently pushed Ned back, out of the way as the bad guy huffed and lunged toward him. Peter didn't use his strength. He didn't have to. Nat's training was really handy for this. Within seconds he had the man disarmed and carefully knocked unconscious. "Cool. Thanks, Nat." Peter knelt down and released a small amount of web fluid to tie the man's hands. "Gotcha." He stood and looked at Ned. "You okay?"
He glanced at the door to the practice room. It was open. Usually she could close it. Today, she kept it open, as if needing a way out. "I get it. If you don't want to do it today, that's cool."
"I'm not judging." Strange held up his hands. He put the book down on the table in front of him and held out his hands.
"We can't just forget this." Steve snapped.
"Cool." Ned grinned. "So, how's the new...everything been going?"
"Hey, are you okay?" His papa asked gently.
"I'd stop if I were you." Was her voice, familiar? Her hair was... wait. That auburn color was familiar.
Maggie nodded. "Screw that. I'll MAKE you an opening."
"I'm still sorry. You're really talented and you should've gotten to show this dance off. Maybe at the next performance, in June? I should be okay then."
"Really?" Maggie asked. She thought he would have had it in high school. He was a doctor, so he had to be smart, why hadn't he had it in high school?
"My dad? You mean Wade?" Maggie asked. "I get it...he's...a lot to deal with. I love him, but...it's a lot to deal with sometimes." She laughed. "It's taken me a while to get used to it. You may want to tell your AI to keep an eye out, he has a way of sneaking into places he shouldn't be."
"I've done this loads of times. My web shooters are fantastic." Peter was not going to talk about the one time a cartridge ran out and he'd fallen fifty feet onto a dumpster, because Tony didn't need that stress in his life. Plus, the new heads-up display they'd been working on kept track of his web fluid (at Peter's (hopefully) subtle suggestion).
"She wouldn't let me touch her. She needs a few things stitched, but she won't let me near her. I think it's the adrenaline. She'll calm down in a few moments and we'll be able to see what she needs. Now, why haven't you taken that arm off?" She nodded to the part of the suit still left on him.
"Well...shit." Strange whispered. The bad guy was still out there and still disguised. They hadn't found him when they'd gotten Peter...because he'd left to tie up loose ends. He took a breath. "How's Peter?"
"How was the rest of patrol?"
I do still read comments and I love every last one. Just have been super busy so I haven't found the time to reply to all of them. Doesn't mean I love you guys any less, just means I have less time and more on my mind. Sorry about that. I'll try to catch back up...someday. More notes at the end.
"I'm not going to let you fall." He promised.
"Just getting under your skin." Tony poked him. "How is balancing all of it? Still doing okay?"
"What's up?" Maggie asked.
"What?" Peter called loudly. "Shit! I forgot. Be there in a minute! Sorry, Maggie, I gotta go. Stay safe, okay?"
"She's not a fan of strangers, Zio Clint." Peter warned. Then he smiled when Steve made himself a little smaller, turning away from Maggie so she wouldn't have to see him. "Thanks, Papa." He whispered to him.
Tony walked back to Peter's side and kissed his forehead. "I'll be right back. Going to get to update the A-Team. You okay?"
Strange snorted, but nodded. "I'll accept that answer. What happened to her?"
"Considering the time I've had...yeah, I'm okay. Freaked out and missing a few digits...but okay."
Maggie felt her consciousness return abruptly. She'd been having such pleasant dreams too. She didn't open her eyes. It was probably a flare of danger somewhere that her mind decided she needed to wake up for. She snuffled and shifted, already starting to drift off.
Maggie's lips twitched up in a small smile. "You're okay. You're..." Maggie's eyes met his hand and she frowned. Her pupils were different sizes, slightly. So slightly that Peter was surprised that Dr. Strange's unenhanced vision noticed. She looked a little...out of focus. "'M sorry."
"He's amazing." Maggie agreed as It Never Entered My Mind began to play. She loved the instrumental song. It was gorgeous.
"Margaret, you trade your mind for insight. You don't have to. Time has it's own rules, yes. But you do not have to lose yourself to understand it. You have the power to work with time. Take control, don't let it control you."
"Oh the dance partner. Lovely to meet you in person." Steve spoke like nothing was strange. It...seemed to help. The tension in Maggie's shoulders lessened.
"As long as Clint doesn't blow up the cake, I think it'll be fun." Peter grinned. "You got to call me and tell me about this...Karma-"
Take Care.
Are you wondering about the heartbeat thing? Tee-hee. Not telling yet.
"That's..." Maggie's eyes widened. "A lot of wiggle room."
"Alright." Peter shrugged. Then he heard it.
"You're our kind of weird, kid." Beck ruffled his hair. "You looked good up there today."
"Including epipens? Because the lady in the office made it quite clear that life-saving medicine is locked up in some back room. What happens if a teacher refuses to let a student leave their class, like what happened to my Margaret? Or if they're on the other side of the school and can't make it down? Or if someone loses the key to the prescription drawer?"
"Yup." Strange said, cleaning her shoulder gently.
"Twelve?" Steve asked.
The man in the suit leaned forward. "So, Peter, for science. Which hurt the most? The scalpel, the hand saw, or the knife?"
"Peachy. Just seeing how you're progressing." Tony said.
"I can help. The area's clear. Let me help." Peter said.
"When Tony asked about Maggie, the man responded in the plural. He has both of them." Steve said. "It isn't in his interest to get rid of either of them." Steve's jaw flexed.
"Okay." Ned went silent instantly, sensing the mood.
"Pete, can you help me with this real quick. Time sensitive."
"Dude, you're disinvited from Lego night."
"Of course. Want to tell me what happened?"
"No. I learned the hard way that all the warnings come after the spells. I read the warnings first these days."
Then Peter's eyes widened as the hair on his arms stood up.
Maggie waved and stepped through. "Woah."
"There's always another way, right?"
"A little more than kin, and less than kind." Strange muttered bitterly as he carefully chopped vegetables.
"But wait...that means... You were doing all that when you were on the...at the church? But that means." Ned's brow furrowed as if he were doing intense math. "No wonder you looked so small...the amount of calories..."
"With practice you will be. I've been dancing for a while."
"I'm helping." He insisted before gently grabbing Maggie's hand. "I know you don't want to, but we've got to make sure there's nothing wrong. Vanessa will stay with you." He was lying, of course. Vanessa would have to leave. But Maggie wasn't going to be conscious much longer and he wanted her calm. Wanted her to feel safe before she passed out.
"Hello?"
"He wouldn't...go after Peter, right?" Steve asked, though he didn't sound too sure.
"I know. But Queens is in that direction, and what sort of friendly neighborhood Spiderman would I be if I didn't make sure you made the walk alright. Besides, I've been trying to get all my merit badges." Peter teased.
Ness laughed and kept watching with them.
Helen looked at Maggie. "May I see your arm?"
Strange nodded. "If you ever take my daughter's ability to get ahold of me again, I'll bring you and everyone in this school down. My daughter was so far gone she couldn't take her medicine. My daughter was throwing up and sobbing for hours yesterday. And that girl has a high pain tolerance. You put my daughter through that pain. When she asked for help, you denied her. When she wanted to ask me for help, you denied her again. I don't do well with people who hurt my daughter." Strange stood up. "If you would like to avoid a lawsuit, I'd change your policies. And my daughter will be carrying any of her necessary medicine on her person from now on. If her phone is EVER taken from her again, I will not be so polite. Have a nice day."
She relaxed and let him pull her. Her leg shook worse, but then she felt her weight come off her balancing leg. Peter'd lifted her off of it.
By the time they got to the cake, Clint and Thor already had some and were calmly eating it. Clint was sitting on the table with his legs swinging. "Want some?" He offered a plate to Peter.
"Did you honestly think we wanted you?" Not-Tony asked.
"She can sense danger." Wade said. "She probably knew something was wrong or that something was about to be wrong."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dr. Strange looked a little confused.
"The brat pulled a vanishing act. I thought I told you to keep that doctor distracted. What do you mean we have bigger problems? ... Shit."
"Everything." Peter mumbled.
"Okay. Okay." Strange nodded. It couldn't be possible. His rational mind knew that. But...well, then again he knew by now nothing was entirely impossible either. "Let's get you out of this room. Will that help you feel better?"
"Don't be sorry. It's nice to meet you, Maggie. Peter's talked about you a lot. It's nice to know he's got good friends."
Maggie hung up and shook her head. "Sorry about her. She's...a character. So's Wade, if I'm being honest." She ran her fingers through her auburn hair awkwardly.
But she didn't stop screaming. Even when he shouted, begged them to stop, promised he wouldn't fight.
"Her...guardians. I don't have their numbers. She should though."
"Peter?!"
Peter's eyes widened and tears fell from his eyes. "Maggie?" That had all been real? She'd really been trapped in that hell with him? He'd left her... That was his fault. He'd LEFT her.
"We have the best kid." Tony responded. The show started and Tony had to admit that there were a lot of talented kids out there. He had no clue how many of them could make their body move that way. It was stunning. But he wasn't there for any of them. He was sure his son's performance would be the best.
"For what?" Strange demanded.
"Her name was definitely Nurse Joy. Do you think she'd check on my balls?" Wade asked.
"Focus...then tell me."
"Whoa."
"Finish up your plate, kiddo."
Now he just had to handle Peter.
"You okay, Peter? You look a little pale."
"I's gone...it's broken. Evr'thing is. There's nothing lef'."
Steve snorted and pulled Tony against his side. "Shush. Maybe next time." He conceded.
"Those exist?"
"Shit! SLOW DOWN FOR FUCKS SAKE!" Maggie shouted. Probably using her power to slow someone down. "Sorry, um, Broadway and Gates. Do you know where that is?"
"Damn." Maggie whistled, settling next to Peter. "I mean...I know some kids get cars when they turn sixteen but..."
"Me? No. I'm staying close with a suit."
"Well, great. Until then, I guess it's me against the world." Tony groaned and got himself up, taking to the sky. Now he had two enemies. One who was actually a friend and one who was a monster. This wasn't going to be fun.
She choked, her face changing colors.
"We know." Ness grinned.
"That's not something to be pleased about, Tony. Jesus, the man wants to kill you."
Strange chuckled as he finished pressing down the bandage. "You're all set."
"What?" He asked.
"Mmhm." Karen agreed. "Peter, you're nearing your curfew."
Peter knew that those sounded pretty good, as far as he knew. His ears could tell she wasn't anywhere near as raspy as she'd been the night before, and her heart sounded steady. Peter walked across the room slowly. "Good signs?"
Tony nodded. "You knew what that was, you're at least college level math. Not too shabby."
Maggie laughed. "Not sure that's what my powers were meant for, but go off, I guess." She settled and focused on the weather, just to see if anything would come up. After an unmeasurable amount of time, she sighed. "It's going to rain in three weeks."
"Sold for glue. Once you work someone to the bone, use and abuse it, the people in power no longer needs it."
"You really okay?" Peter asked, sitting next to Maggie. He didn't reach out and touch her. When he had panic attacks it helped to have Steve or Tony hold him...but he could understand why Maggie didn't want to be touched.
So far, so good.
Her eyes narrowed. "It wasn't a lab accident...was it?"
"You'd better try. And I've got a discerning eye, so don't bullshit me." His hands were shaking, but Vanessa didn't hold that against him, considering it wasn't a nervous indicator.
"Yeah." Tony called as he worked on the arm of his suit. "Quick tip, kid. Pretend like everything in here will explode."
"It's the rule. He's going to have to get over it."
Strange snorted. "Try anyway. In fact, try to give a weather forecast."
"It looks good. Don't worry about it, Pete." Beck soothed. "They're super excited by it. Where are the initial few coming off the line going?"
"Thanks, Nat."
"Mm-hm." Not really. She got a couple hours of sleep. Not much at all. It was hard for her to sleep in a new place. All the new sounds and space. It kept her up.
Strange nodded and took that one on the chin. He knew he looked like shit. He felt like shit. Had that whole attack in Hong Kong had been to distract him? With what Maggie said about drones...if the beast had been a hologram...it made sense why nothing worked against the damn thing. It didn't exist. The people who'd taken those kids had done their homework...all for what? To hurt two innocent children? He hated whoever had done this to his kid-to Margaret.
"Spin the camera. I saw the news, show me the room."
"I know it hurts, a couple more and it won't hurt anymore." He'd never found himself soothing patients like this before. Normally, when he got people on his operating table, they were unconscious. He didn't NEED to have a bedside manner, because they were already out. "You're doing good. This one will be the worst of them, hold out a little longer." And it was a bad cut. Deep, painful...bleeding much more than he'd like. It would be okay, sure, but...he didn't like it one bit.
"Shut up, Flash." Peter didn't have time for him. He headed for the door. He pulled out his phone to text his dad.
Peter snorted. "Thanks, bro. Same." Peter nodded and looked around his room. It was a far cry from being homeless. His project though, was a brain child of a homeless kid. Now he was the son of the richest man in the world, about to announce a product that would help those who where stuck where he'd once been. It was overwhelming.
Tony looked at him and smiled. "You know, this is fine. The trouble's worth it, plus, I knew this one was coming. I mentally prepared for it months ago. We're going to be fine."
"Yeah, awesome." Peter nodded.
"I'll call them and let them know you're sick. Don't worry about it, try to get some rest, okay?"
"I feel like Dr. Strange is lying to me."
"Maybe once things cool down a little bit you can talk about it." Aaron said after a moment. "Everyone handles stress and pain differently. My youngest girl, stubborn as can be. She broke her arm on her bike. Next day she was back on the thing in her new cast. My boy broke his finger and demanded to be babied for a week, couldn't even bother to open the fridge on his own, he was absolutely ridiculous."
"How was school?"
"Thanks." Maggie walked to the nearest bathroom, the one she usually used when she visited. Sure enough, there was a toothbrush, toothpaste, and mouthwash waiting for her. She brushed her teeth and washed her face. Still feeling a little ill. Why would she do that? Then, she paused. Her watch...in the vision. Her watch had been gone. She never took off her father's watch. Why was it gone in the vision?
"Okay." Peter nodded. "And the building, it's running just fine, right?" They weren't doing the presentation at SI. They picked a different venue so Peter's power source could show off exactly what it could do. They didn't want it trying to compete against the arc reactor. That wasn't what it was for. It wasn't some grand, expensive science experiment. It was grounded, meant for the little guy, the everyman.
She trusted Peter. They'd danced plenty of times and she'd never felt this. They worked together. They'd survived kidnapping and torture together. They were close. Would he hate her if he knew this? That she liked him like that? She...she wasn't like the other girls at school, who went from turned on to gushing about how much they wanted sex. She didn't feel that but...there'd been something. She knew she didn't want sex but...she now knew she was attracted to him and what the fuck? What the hell was her body doing? She didn't give it permission to do any of this.
Peter flinched at the callous words. "What do you want?"
Maggie felt something coming back to her, as if from a dream...or vision. "Drones."
Mild violence. Was going to go into more detail...but honestly I didn't have the energy for it. Let's just say Beck lasted a very long time before his end. Yeah, the line from Deadpool "Like to see Captain America do that." inspired the anger in our Steve.
"Sounds cool. Meet you at the halfway place, like normal?" Maggie asked as she pulled her auburn hair up into a tight bun by muscle memory.
"Oh. Well that makes sense. I mean, if someone's coming up with spells they'd have to DO the spells before they figured out what happened with them."
"Oh, don't you go sighing." Helen huffed. "If anyone here is allowed to be put out, it's me. You, your husband, his team, that all made sense. Now two kids? Seriously. KIDS?"
"I can't lean that way."
"Thanks, Fri." Peter said. It felt weird...not talking to JARVIS. JARVIS though was gone. He frowned and got showered and dressed before heading out to the dinning room. "Hey, guys."
He didn't even know what happened.
"Okay." Maggie nodded, keeping her face serious.
"No promises. I'll try to come back sane."
"I know." Peter whispered.
She jolted and turned. "Sorry. I just...saw danger...maybe a car accident and I-"
Peter glanced over and saw her texting 'Dr. Dad'. His contact picture was...weird. Peter would describe the doctor as stern, almost cold (not in a mean way, just sort of distant, above others), borderline stoic, and sarcastic. When he interacted with people, he came across as the boss in every room he entered, sort of how Peter's Dad acted. A sort of confidence that bordered on arrogance. Peter'd only ever seen that stern personality relax around Maggie. But the picture on the phone was of a child-version of Maggie sitting on his shoulders, her tiny hands in his hair. Dr. Strange had a huge, happy grin on his face as he looked up at Maggie like she was his whole world. Younger Maggie was looking down at him too, laughing.
Peter didn't feel his spidersense going off. And he heard Tony's heartbeat echo metallically. THIS Tony was real. His dad was real, that he knew for sure. Then he turned to Steve. "What movie was the last movie that was on on Christmas morning?"
"Wouldn't sealing them being more important?"
"No problem, Pete." Aaron stood up straight. "They love you, I know it. He got hurt, he's probably under some stress. Just give it some air."
"Fair enough."
Peter flung himself into Steve's arms and then shouted in pain when his left hand hit Steve's back.
There was a replay a few minutes later.
"I'm a genius, kiddo, and I know you. Plus, you and I don't often meet in public. If some kid shows up in my lab and isn't acting like my son, I'll notice." Tony nodded. "They don't know you like I do. I'm famous, anyone can play the snarky asshole, but you? They don't know you. They can't mimic you. You're one of a kind." Tony smiled gently. "Alright, that's a lot of feelings for one day. Food?"
Dr. Strange somehow had a trashcan just in time to catch her vomit before even she knew she was going to throw up. "Get it out. Breathe."
"Shush and watch."
"Their screams will echo in Valhalla!"
"Mostly knife-proof. I'll say...bullet resistant. Also fire and heat resistant...just don't jump into a fire...you're face won't be covered. The coat is the safest part. Heating and cooling, so you aren't ever overheating or freezing. It doesn't really have an AI like, Peter's, but it does have an emergency beacon. If any of your health metrics slip into a dangerous level, JARVIS will know. You'll have backup. Even hooked it up so Wade'll know too."
"You're the best, E."
"And add another thing to my plate? Was the therapy, dance, decathlon, high school, vigilanteing, and getting to know my place in a new family not enough?"
"What was that for?"
She wasn't lying.
"I completely agree, Sir."
"Not at all."
"Oh, we don't WANT to hurt the kids. We do want to hurt you... The thing is...if we hurt you physically, that really isn't enough. Stane already tried that...we're looking for a fresh new approach here. I hear the most terrifying thing for a parent is knowing their child is in pain...and not being able to help."
"I worried she might be turned vengeful given her time with Wilson... and her past. She's a good kid, I don't expect that to ever change. Worries like that, though are for the future. Can only help her now. Future will sort itself." Strange sighed. "She's a good girl. I don't want her to be hurt again and I don't want her to lose herself. She needs guidance. I can't do all of it, but I can help." He looked at the necklace. "This is stupid. Is it stupid? Too much?"
"There's too much out there. It's distracting."
Peter nodded slowly and let her guide him to the table.
Maggie broke right into a Thriller dance without even a slight hesitation.
"What? Yeah, of course. I've even gotten to work with Dr. Banner."
"You're late, I already ate. Have whatever you want, sweetheart."
"Just a reminder, Peter, you're past curfew." Karen said. "Mr. Stark is calling."
"We need to have a talk." Steve said.
Maggie's eyes widened. "Wait...take off your gloves."
"Okay." She snuggled closer. "I'm sorry."
Maggie snorted and turned back to Peter. "Seriously, you got to be more careful, especially right now. You're all shrouded in danger vibes. I'm not trying to be mean or anything. I just want to help ease some of them away."
"Of course you can't. You're too weak."
Peter's head tilted to the side. "Can I touch you? Like adjust you?"
Take care. <3
"Yeah." Peter nodded. "Thanks again for food. I was hungrier than I thought."
She gasped and kicked her legs futilely.
She gagged and held the can close. "I..."
"On my way home."
"Thanks."
"I tried to take his head off. He scared me. Knew who I was and everything. I'd been living with my new name and he just outed me and my past and... Anyway, we eventually talked. He's been helping me train for a while now. Wade usually handles the hand-to-hand stuff, but Strange gets my powers better, he helps with that."
"You're a kid. I'm not going to do what was done to me. You get to look like a kid. You get to stutter and fumble with words. I'll be there to help. I'm not leaving you up there alone. Though, it's adorable that you were practicing your presentation."
"You gotta stop calling me that."
"Just her phone. She has a watch, but it wouldn't be trackable. The thing's almost thirty years old, it was her dad's." Wade said.
Maggie nodded. "Wade and Ness are here?"
"Oh...this is going to be fun." Peter laughed.
"That building is... I don't think it's stable anymore." Peter said with wide eyes. He'd managed to subdue the baddie with one of Vulture's weapons, but it had heavily damaged a building. He was on the side of a wall, looking at the building across from them.
"I'm worried." Vanessa said. "I don't know what this is, Wade, but I have this pit in my stomach. I just know something is wrong."
"Maggie? Are you okay?" Wade asked, gripping her hand.
"You're welcome, Peter."
"Not married yet." Nat pointed out dryly.
Strange waved a hand.
The next act came on. And Tony, really wished he could pay attention, but Peter would be next. Tony tapped on his phone really quickly, to make sure the camera he'd set up above him would record the whole thing.
"And I know who you are." Maggie commented, raising an eyebrow at Tony. "Super runs on all sides of this family, huh?"
The door opened.
Maggie turned her head toward Strange's voice. He was actually there. Holding her hand too in his own gloved hands. "Wh-what are you doing here?"
Steve nodded.
"JARVIS is on it, give us a moment."
"Could not!" Tracy retorted.
"Keep it in the bedroom, you two." Nat said, wiping her face with a towel. "There's a kid present."
"Didn't wanna intrude." She shrugged and hated how her shoulder and side ached because of it.
Maggie looked properly scolded, her head dipped. "Yes, sir."
Vanessa stared at her face, then frowned. "She doesn't normally talk in her sleep."
"I don't wanna leave you." Peter shook his head.
Maggie stepped forward and hugged him.
Peter swung through the city and landed on a building. He tilted his head to the side and looked across the narrow street. "Hey! Reset!"
"Wha-no. No. She's just a friend."
"Is it that ugly?"
"Oh, hey Peter! So glad you aren't being hogged upstairs today." Tracy walked forward and grinned. "How are you feeling about working on your project a bit more? Or do you wanna learn a bit more about coding today?" Tracy's job was to work on the new prosthetics. She was really good at it and Peter would love for Ned to learn from her, because she was brilliant with a computer and she and Ned would nerd out together. But Peter couldn't really think about her work no matter how cool it was...not with Stane in the room.
"Please don't. No Wicked, I can't take it. Everyone sings that music everywhere."
That was answer enough. Peter knew about Deadpool though. Beck would be dead...it would just depend on when he decided to let it happen. Peter wished he could feel sorry. But after all the lies...after all he'd put Peter and his family through...after seeing all that Maggie and her family had gone through... He couldn't force himself to be sorry.
"Steve is fine." He assured her.
"Alright. We'll get you on the schedule. There are a few things you need to do (more accurately NOT do) before we can do the work. I'll give you all a packet. And we'll talk about some rehab that will help walking you through getting used to the prosthetics. Okay?"
"I'm home." Maggie called as she closed the door. She put her jacket down on the counter and turned to the fridge, quickly snagging a drink.
Strange laughed and cried at the same time. "Thank you."
"Enlighten me."
"I need to see her." Wade protested.
"Dude, that's sweet. Your parents are awesome." Ned grinned.
"Have you like, ever, seen yourself? The flips you do? Totally a floor routine."
Why did Peter have to make logical sense when she wanted to freak out?
"Thanks, Dad."
"You still awake?"
Peter swallowed and winced, thinking about it. His stomach turned.
"You shouldn't have underestimated me." Tony smiled. "You keep making that mistake. When will you learn?"
"Hey! That was. Did you just whoosh off my friend?" Maggie asked, the fight abruptly ending.
Peter laughed. "That's good."
"Yeah. They just hurt during the rain. I think I should be okay to work like this though. Don't wanna put them back on at the moment."
"I'm..." Peter paused.
"I have to admit...sometimes she scares me." Thor said after a silent moment.
"It's cool, to have a mentor like that. I guess I sort of felt that way about Dad, before anything was official. Going to his lab and tinkering was...my safe haven. You seem to feel comfortable around him. That's good." Peter nodded. He hadn't seen Maggie that comfortable around people. She seemed calm around Vanessa and Wade, but after that, she always seemed to have some sort of wall up. Her eyes were always darting, searching, looking for threats and danger. He could relate, given his spidersense. But, though brief, he'd never seen Maggie take off her gloves around anyone, except Dr. Strange. That had to mean something.
Glass shattered. Strange turned his head just in time to dodge a fist to the face. He waved his hand and the bug in blue and red was out of sight, out of mind. He did take a very firm hit from Maggie's staff though. Maybe she was getting stronger. Much harder and he might have had a fractured bone for his trouble, and it was sparring...she was holding back. He certainly was going to have bruises.
Maggie nodded. "Well, technically, I do know he's not a villain... I could tell just by seeing him on the TV. That Stane guy creeps me out though."
Peter sighed, knowing his dad and papa didn't quite agree with him being out there at his age. He wasn't going to have the argument again. He glanced at the TV.
She jerked back, pressing herself to the wall.
"I couldn't tell."
"Psst."
"Mom didn't really work with me...my head stuff. She got lost for a while. Teachers didn't want anything to do with me, I was too difficult. And the special education teacher I had treated me like shit. They told me it would probably always be...well their word for me was 'stupid'." She bit her lip. "Then I started noticing that I couldn't keep my powers and my mind at the same time. Then HE showed up. My powers were the only thing that kept him from doing worse than he'd already done to me. I didn't WANT to get better. I was afraid if I got better someone else might try to hurt me like him and I wouldn't be able to get away."
"This way, you're leaning again." He shifted her upright, just a little.
"Says the ex-super villain." Maggie said with a smile. "To be fair, your rep is getting a little better."
The man who'd been responsible for his torture was above him. And two children stood between him and that enemy. Tony couldn't care less about his own trapped form. He wanted to scream, beg the kids to run, to hide, to save themselves.
Peter landed on the building opposite of SI and his eyes widened. His dad and Stane were fighting. It...wasn't pretty. He regretted ever coming up with a power source idea for his internship. He hated that the brutal clashing, the hits his Dad was taking, was all on him.
"Peter, you had the whole front row in tears. Yes. If strangers got it, your parents definitely got it. That was a brilliantly designed dance."
"Isn't that?" Steve started.
Peter listened. He could hear the doctors working on his dad. It seemed Dr. Cho liked music on while she worked too. No problems seemed to be going on with his dad. They were all calm, even chatty. Peter sighed in relief, knowing his dad was safe and in good hands, apparently the break wasn't too bad and he was getting a few stitches. He wished his papa were with him, but he knew his papa would be there as soon as he could be.
Who was 'him'?
He was pretty close, within a couple feet, so she reached out and grabbed his hand. She just wanted to make sure. Every time she closed her eyes she was worried that things had changed, that they weren't real. But then she felt his scars under her sore fingertips and she could tell what was real. The same was true of visions. She could tell reality and visions apart because she couldn't feel visions, but she could feel reality. Without a hesitation, Strange wrapped his hand around hers, gently squeezing. "Sorry. I jus'...keep checking."
"I can help!"
"It couldn't be real though. It...it couldn't be." No. Peter remembered far too well getting the call. Losing her. Going to her funeral. Seeing them bury her next to Ben. No. She couldn't have been real. Why did she seem so real? He whimpered and curled into a ball.
Take care.
"Water-type fan, actually." Maggie answered.
"Yeah...actually. I've got an address...it's...in the direction we found the cuffs."
Steve smiled then and took Peter's hand. "You all good, bub?"
"Thanks, J."
"Okay." Tony went to sleep.
"No." Though he could see the appeal of trying to drink away the screams, he promised her he'd check. "I'm...going to see what happened." He nodded and went back to the Sanctum.
"Zero out of ten for style. Didn't even think of painting it, did you Obie?" Tony snarked. He got up and backed toward the shattered wall. The wind blowing around him. He didn't want Obie near him. He needed a suit first before he engaged.
"'Kay. Wan'...wan' Strange."
"Sorry. I can get you a little more pain meds, but they're going to make you drowsy."
"Um...I just feel a little ill."
Maggie walked into the room.
She'd tried...and she'd told the weather.
"You caught me." Peter rubbed his head. "But my favorite is the high bar. You should check me out, I'm going to the 2016 Olympics. Make sure to tune in. I'll probably take it easy though. Would be bad form to take the gold with super powers."
"She's okay. I promise. You're going to be fine. You're safe." He soothed, grateful that Christine led him right to an empty bed. He gently set her down and looked up at Christine. "I'm helping on this."
"Uh-uh."
Maggie had worked really hard and passed her class. He'd wanted to congratulate her, maybe take her somewhere to celebrate. He was proud of her. She'd worked hard. That was worth rewarding. He knew how much she struggled. He wanted to encourage her. Foster that work ethic.
"On it, sir." JARVIS responded. "Thirty locations meet current parameters."
Peter froze. Beck? No. There was no way. Beck was too nice. How could he be the nice, friendly mentor and the guy who'd sliced off fingers... Actually...that made sense. "He was in the lab with me, when Not-Tony first showed up. He's had access to me from the start of my internship almost." Peter whispered.
"You okay?"
"Hey, Peter, you okay?"
"Reset and I came running. There were explosions. We can help!" Peter needed to help. This was HIS fault.
"Of course."
Ness gently massaged Maggie's feet. The girl wasn't...fully herself. Ness would say it was sort of like looking at her reflection in a funhouse mirror. All the pieces were still there, but different parts were out of proportions. Her energetic always moving was gone. She slept a lot more. She cried a lot more, woke up screaming from nightmares again. It had been a long time since she woke up screaming on such a regular basis. And her focus was off. She'd walk to the fridge and forget what she'd wanted by the time she got there.
"And thanks for the head start." Peter nodded.
Peter walked down the hallway and swiped his card at the lab doors. He looked around the room, taking in the faces. Some of the usuals were there. He waved to Tracy and smiled. There was a man Peter'd never seen working with some sort of holograph. He was tall, with blue eyes, dark hair, and beard. He smiled warmly at Peter. "Hey, you must be Mr. Parker." The man waved his hand and the holographs disappeared. "Tracy was babbling about you. You got the internship, huh?"
"Yes, it is."
"Hey, JARVIS." Peter responded happily as he swung into Queens. "What's happenin'?" He asked as he flipped up onto a building. He stuck the landing and damn it felt good to be back.
Maggie blinked at him. The question confused her for a moment, but then it clicked. "No."
"You will be falling for six hours, at least, if you don't go sit down."
"That reference my brain caught." She laughed. "Sure, you can be king of the lab. Thanks for the help. You know, I don't mean to be insensitive, but it's nice having you down here more often."
"And you should note that you leave a trail behind when you do that." Maggie nodded her head toward some webs.
"Yeah." Peter nodded.
Maggie's breaths were coming in quick rasps, her eyes watering.
Tony raised an eyebrow as Steve walked off the stage, then hissed when Cho pressed on his side. "Still sore there."
"No." She glared at him, even while coughing up blood.
Natasha appeared, immediately assessed the room, then nodded to Tony. "JARVIS got some recording, some of the first ones we found, and Beck's...confessions, got us a decent list of names. We've gotten all of them. They're all scheduled to be tried...except Beck who is currently...tied up." Nat reported.
Karen's silence was not reassuring. "I believe he simply wants you home safe right now. You can ask him when you get there."
Ned put on his game-face. "Okay, I'm going to say suit. So, try on the black and the gray, then we can figure out which color shirt."
(See the end of the chapter for
"My AI." Peter answered. "Do get ahold of the police so they can get the thieves picked up." He followed her.
"'-packed with Muggles, of course-.'" Strange turned the page. "'Harry swung round. The-'"
"Nice job, паучонок." Nat agreed. "I'll help you work on your grappling next time." She patted his shoulder and walking with him to the bench.
"I'm alright though, seriously." Peter promised.
"Drones?" Maggie asked.
"I know what it's like. I found a new family myself. I had a feeling that letting you go to them would be better than anything the police could have done. We all need true family." She gently rubbed her watch, as if she didn't know she was doing it.
Strange straightened. "I know. Believe me. She's going to be fine." He turned and walked to the curtain around Maggie's bed. "Almost set?"
"Okay. Well, let's try to give you this dream again and see what we can find."
"Don't worry. For real though...living cape."
The Cloak drooped.
"We're just borrowing her for a bit." A distorted voice answered. "If she's good she'll come back in one piece. If not...well, that's on her for not being a good, cooperative girl."
Maggie wanted to laugh, but she knew it would hurt. She felt sick to her stomach and kept her mouth closed, just in case.
Peter tried to follow along with Karen's advice. How? How did that happen? How did that seem so real? Was he hallucinating?
Steve laughed. "You got it. Tony, you'll be having more than coffee. I insist. No arguing."
"Sorry." Peter frowned when he collided with Maggie for the third time. "Timing's still a bit off." He grabbed ahold of her arms to keep her from tumbling over. She wasn't a slouch. She was well-built from dancing, but running into a super-human could throw anyone off balance.
"Don't do it, Iron Man isn't the bad guy." Peter insisted, grabbing her back, tight. "Please."
Peter didn't really want to leave this dimension, wherever it was, it was quiet, calm. There were no fake people. No torture. No bad things. In the real world, SI was dealing with another crisis, New York was on fire, the world now knew Tony Stark had a son, the news was losing their minds, and everything was just...awful.
"Sure thing."
"Yeah...probably the way he asked where Francis was."
He opened the door and let her step in first. He caught her looking down for some reason. It wasn't like his old apartment. But it was an apartment. Brick walls, a fireplace. A kitchen, two bathrooms, two bedrooms, a living room. Not so much a dining room, but he had chairs at the bar. It was neat. He liked to keep things clean. He didn't want her to feel that pressure though.
"We should go." Maggie took three steps forward.
"What kind of danger is it? Are we talking mortal danger or paper-cut danger?"
Peter frowned. Maggie had been off all week. If she needed help he was going to meet her. The girl had been dealing with something...and then on top of it her 'he's not my dad, Peter' dad was on the other side of the world fighting a bad guy that wouldn't stop. She had to be upset. He frowned and quickly texted back.
"Here's the couch, sweetie. Want to sit down?"
"It was, but I think it's okay. Mr. Stark is just a bit stressed is all. He doesn't normally get like that. We talked about it, it's cool." Peter shrugged and turned to his work.
Maggie's hand snapped out once more and grabbed Strange's. "Check...please check. Go back and look. I'm not crazy. He was there."
"Shit." Tony huffed, then realized someone was behind him. He whirled and held up his hands. Only to find Dr. Strange hovering across from him. Cape flowing behind him.
"You've been up all night working."
"SHIT!" Peter ducked and webbed the shield to the wall before ducking under a punch from Nat. The last thing he wanted was to get a taste of those widow bites...again. They weren't pleasant. He used a web to pull him up to the other side of the room, hiding in the obstacle course. He needed to get the two split up. He could take Nat, but not when Steve was there to back her up. Steve would...be another problem, but Peter'd figure that out when he got to it.
"Uh, I'll handle it. Dr. Cho gets paid...quite a bit do be the Avenger's doctor, along with this guy and myself." Tony poked Peter's shoulder. "We'll just group you in on the hero plan."
"A back-stabbing, wife-stealing asshole?"
"It was her. May was right there. I just...I wanted to see her and I couldn't get to her. I tried, but she...she was gone like last time." Peter began to sob again.
"What? What about the girl though? We have a good set up here."
Maggie shrugged. "Didn't know him. I met the lady who was sorceress supreme before him. She and I stumbled upon each other. She was there when I used my powers for the first time. I was...maybe six or seven? It blurs. Anyway...after my whole fiasco and Wade got me out. I went to my special school and...somewhere in there she was training Strange...told him about me. When I came back to New York, he found me."
"Ness and I think you're more like... a slightly younger, red-headed Elle Fanning."
"Hey, it's fine." Peter assured her. She tended to be hard on herself. They weren't in 'professional' ballet classes. They were more in the 'advanced recreational' classes. It wasn't like it was a dance or get kicked to the curb situation. They were just there to have fun. "Don't worry. You need to get better, so no stress on that, okay?"
The metal bands around Peter snapped open.
"No." Peter shook his head and climbed down, hiding quickly in the space as his spidersense buzzed vaguely. "I'm not safe." Were they watching? He glanced around. He needed to get out of here.
Tony took a deep breath. "Yeah. J, keep cycling through. Do you two know if Maggie carries anything else? Any electronic or something? I could track her if she has something."
"Hey, hey." Strange got up and wrapped his arms around her. "Honey, are you okay? Hey, I've got you. It's okay." He kissed the top of her head.
A faint voice. Strange's. And his footsteps. "You need to find the balance between things. You can't let your powers consume you. You need to control them. It isn't a trade-off, it's balance. You need to focus and find that point. To do that you need to understand your powers and their effects. You need balance."
A small twitch of a smile. She coughed. She looked like she was trying to move her right hand to cover her mouth, but it was covered in tubes.
She took a step back and watched as he moved his hand. Bright golden light filled the air in front of him. It wasn't an exact replication, and it faded from the air, fizzling out. He nodded.
"He's...hurt. Quiet. Um...I stepped away. Maggie gave me enough detail to identify the guy behind this."
"Love you too." Peter knew well enough that neither of his new parents were thrilled to see him vigilante-ing. They both understood, of course, why Peter wanted to do it, why he felt the need to go out there and help. Neither of them wanted that stress and pain for Peter. Peter'd heard them talk about it. He'd also heard how reluctant they were to let him go out, given his age. But, Peter, back before they were even going to foster him, had made it very clear he wouldn't stay if he couldn't be Spiderman. He loved them...so much...but he had to be Spiderman. He knew from experience that he had the power to stop bad things from happening...and if they happened it was on him. They'd had many reservations...but as far as Peter was concerned, they'd struck a good deal with him. If he had to follow more rules...then he would if it meant he could keep people safe.
Maggie learned from that not to hesitate to protect herself. Her dad hesitated, she couldn't. Would he be ashamed of her, think her cold and unfeeling? She never aimed to kill. She'd stabbed people before. She knew where people were vulnerable, where to attack them to make sure they could never hurt her. She didn't though. She just slowed them down. Except...in the future she might kill someone...on purpose. What would her father think of her? He'd served his community and given his life for it. What was she?
Take care.
"I know we're not him, kiddo. I'm sorry."
He frowned. "It was just a nightmare." He soothed. "There's no one in here."
"Why wasn't I informed?!" Strange said, fury in his voice. Fury and concern.
Tony raised his hands in the 'what are you gonna do about it' gesture. "Brat deserves it."
"I'm gonna go get all the food. I'll try to save some for you. No promises." She poked her dad's arm.
"Natasha Romanoff is asking for entrance." Strange said suddenly.
"Well, if you ever need help or it's too much, let us know. I know...things are crazy right now."
"What?"
Tony huffed, but nodded. "Yeah."
"Let's go make a couple tweaks to the specs, huh?" Tony asked.
Maggie let out a soft, pained laughed.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you...we always used to tell each other everything." Peter whispered.
"What? I really like those things." Thor grumbled as he stepped out of the pantry. "Why is the young Peter on the ceiling? How is the young Peter on the ceiling?"
"Well, my spidersense went crazy, if that's what you're asking. I really didn't like him." Peter folded his arms over his chest.
"Deal." Maggie smiled and waved, walking away with Vanessa.
Maggie nodded at him. "This thing won't do much to him, but I can slow him down for you or speed you up. Let me know. I've got you."
"Hey, what's going on?"
"Nope."
Strange nodded. "You have the capacity for so much, Margaret. I promise it won't be all...death and despair."
He knocked on the door.
I own nothing.
Her powers snapped, unable to hold on anymore, whatever it had been slowing was no longer slowed. It had resumed its full speed. The pain was so much worse now.
"Yes. I'm fine. Didn't even have to break out my inner badass." Peter tried to laugh.
"You gotta rest sometimes, Maggie. I know I'm a hypocrite...I don't like sitting still. We have to sometimes though."
"Dad?" Peter asked in a sleepy voice.
Dr. Strange looked down at himself. T-shirt and sweatpants. "And?"
"You're kind of an asshole, aren't you?" Tony asked, half-teasing. Then he realized he might have just offended the man who helped get his son back to full health, sans three fingers.
"Yup." Maggie grabbed her phone with her free hand and put shuffle on her stretching playlist for dance.
Peter caught himself and rolled across the floor. He stayed knelt on the ground and watched as the shield met Steve's arm again.
"You stay safe out there, bud. Remember the training we did. If anything gets too dodgy, you call for back up or you run, okay, Queens?"
Peter gently reached out and patted the cape. It seemed like a very nice...sentient...floaty...piece of fabric. "I thought my kind of weird was...strange."
"Really?"
Right again. Spidermanning must put that energy around him, plus whatever Stane had planned. Peter was pretty glad that it wasn't mortal danger, but why hadn't she said that about his dad too? Was Tony in some sort of mortal danger? Or did she just sense that Obie would kill Tony if he had the chance? He wished he could question her further on her powers.
A loud creak echoed in her room. Floorboards shifting under the weight of SOMEONE who was in her room.
Peter screamed when the man squeezed the stubs that were once his fingers.
Though he had a firm set to his face, there was some amusement and fondness in his sharp gray-blue eyes. "What is it this time, Margaret? Aren't you supposed to be at school? Are you alright?" His voice was dry, but there was a slight hint of concern.
"Tony, you okay?" Steve asked.
Thankfully...no one and nothing was there. For the first time in however many days, his spidersense was quiet.
"Same thing we told you to do if there's a hostage situation." Steve nodded. "Comply, don't kick up a fuss, and don't dig yourself into more trouble. Find an escape route if it's safe to, don't be a hero." It hadn't been a pleasant conversation, but they'd all had it as a family. As a superhero, kidnapping was already plausible. As the adopted son of Captain America and Tony Stark, Peter'd have a huge target on his back once the news got out. They'd talked about possible ransom situations...among other things.
Christine nodded. "Yeah, you do." She teased, then her face fell. "Someone came to the hospital for Margaret."
Maggie curled up on the bed, holding herself tightly. She felt dizzy. Disoriented. She couldn't see very well, her sight blurred. She didn't feel well, she didn't know these people around her. People who wanted her to take off her jacket and mask. She couldn't do that. It didn't matter that she hurt. She didn't want them touching her. She didn't feel safe. She grabbed her phone and, with shaky hands, held the button. No amount of focus would allow her to read at the moment. She heard a beep.
Tony felt dizzy as the world shifted around him.
"Fair warning, if you don't want to feel sick, don't watch the kid eat. He can pack it in." Tony shook his head.
(718)624-4437:
She looked away, but that didn't stop the sting of the needle from hurting. And she thought the pressure her elbow was applying to the gauze covering the wound on her side was bad, the needle was worse.
She closed her eyes, took a deep breath and waited. Her head was throbbing. It had been since the last time her head had been smashed against the wall. Her head hurt worse than she'd ever felt it hurt before. But she couldn't worry about it for now, nor could she worry about the slow drain of her powers that hadn't stopped since.
"Hey, hey." Tony's voice said. "Hey, you're safe, bambino. You're safe, Roo."
"Why do you call me Margaret?" Maggie wondered. He was the only person who called her that. Almost everyone else called her Mags or Maggie or Reese. He'd only ever called her Maggie once that she could recall, and it seemed that he'd only used it to try to get her attention. Always, though, he called her by her full name.
"Don't knock it 'til you try it, jerk."
She rolled her eyes and gave him her phone.
There was more, but he didn't say it, she could tell.
"Seems to be managing though, she's tough."
"We're on our way. You armed, Legolas?"
Maggie laughed. "I don't think he'd let me. But I'll try. He really likes that trick. Does it when people annoy him. It's kinda funny."
"Yeah, well, I'm married to the boss. I claim some bossiness."
Maggie heard a slight edge to his tone, not sure what it meant. She walked around the sofa and sat down. "It's never really been a priority to me. We found out a couple months before dad died. He came home from work and take off his gun belt and start doing flash cards with me. Used to give me M&Ms every card I got right. Silly things at first, numbers and letters. Then words and big numbers." She gently pulled her legs up onto the sofa. "My powers had just started. Dad told me about his. He could always tell when someone was lying. And I was starting to sense danger. The colors were just starting to show up... The last flashcard he showed me was 3,000. I told him it was a big number. He said it was the biggest number..." She frowned. "I told him not to leave. I told him something bad would happen. He told me it was his job, that he had to go. He said he loved my 3,000. I never saw him again...alive.
"'Yeah'? That's all?" Tony asked. "We have rules for a reason, Peter. To keep you safe." Tony did not like the way Peter's jaw flexed and his eyes rolled, but he kept talking as calm as he could. "If it weren't for Karen, we wouldn't have known where you were tonight. You're supposed to tell us when you leave, and it's a school night, Peter. Why didn't you tell us?"
Wednesday was another internship day. Peter was a little nervous for it. Thankfully, even in the lower labs he'd made friends and he knew that if any of his friends decided to sell him out to Stane, his sense would warn him, but still, he didn't like feeling the need to look over his shoulder. Peter got onto the elevator. "Sixteen, JARVIS."
Vanessa wrapped Maggie up in a hug and gently pried her from her grip on Strange's shirt.
Peter did another sit-up as Ned held his feet. "Dude are you still doing the internship? Like, for real?" Ned asked.
Peter blushed, but then straightened up and folded his arms over his chest. "Yes, yes I did. So what?"
"I've done plenty of long shifts before. Think my record was fifty-four hours."
Strange looked at Maggie. "I'm not leaving you without a doctor. But I'll help." He squeezed her hand.
"He always is." Maggie sighed.
"It's just...I should've stuck closer to her. She shouldn't have been alone. She doesn't just...bounce back. She's not like me." Peter winced, realizing he'd just outted himself to the wizard, but the wizard didn't seem surprised at all.
"Sleep alright?"
Maggie felt relief at that. "Peter?" She needed to make sure he was okay. They found him right?
"I'm not her parent." Strange protested. "She had a vision where she was alone and scared. If she ends up in a place where tech can't find her, I want something I can trust to get the job done."
Maggie wasn't going to argue with that. She was tired. She usually was. Didn't mean she got much sleep. "Goodnight."
His Dad's armor was coming back on.
"Big mood. Maybe I'll have a tide pod, I hear they taste like Gushers." Peter joked. "I don't think I wanna know what an angry Miss Potts looks like."
Steve threw his head back and laughed from the belly. "Yup. Totally. But you'd better be ready for a real workout."
"Fine, I'll help. But if it backfires, I hope you have someone else to call as backup."
"I'm glad you'll still get to dance. Tony and I are super excited to see it, bud." Steve smiled gently and ruffled his hair. He took a deep breath and then sighed.
"It's not you, J. Someone...someone is very good. We'll be better though."
The press conference went...surprisingly well. Though Tony'd been unable to attend, Steve managed to handle the press very well, announcing that he and Tony were in fact engaged and that they hadn't set a date. He'd talked about how happy they were, talked about working through the current injuries Tony had. Steve may have even insinuated that it wasn't alright for the media to keep smearing Tony's character. And Tony didn't know how Steve could come across as polite and still make people feel like absolute shit.
"See you next week." She waved and went on her way.
"What?" Steve asked.
Peter frowned, wishing he could REALLY talk to his friend. "He's okay, a bit banged up is all." Peter's jaw tightened and he did his sit-ups a little faster. He couldn't stand Mr. Stane. He'd give him a visit as Spiderman if Tony AND Steve hadn't expressly forbidden it.
Strange swallowed. "You really like Mads, but I'm still on the fence."
Dr. Strange stood and put one hand on her shoulder, the other on her chin.
Maggie couldn't speak, if she opened her mouth, she thought she might puke.
"It's kinda creepy that you just...get it." Peter wrinkled his nose.
Peter laughed. Things were...really perfect.
"Oh! I won't be in trouble, don't worry. He says as long as I'm making progress and getting better. I don't have a set deadline, not really. It's been fun working with coding. It's so different. I'm not great at it, but it's fun." Peter grinned and wow, it was nice to not have his spider sense going off like crazy. "I like learning new things."
"It was just a run. What are you doing up this early?"
"'Bye, sweetie."
"Steve would win, sorry, Tony." Nat chuckled. "Unless you've got some sort of anti-cap weapon hidden in your lab, he's got you. Nice try though, you're just not that intimidating."
When she made it to their normal room, incense was already burning, the usual stuff. She couldn't put a label on the smell, but it was calming. Instead of the usual cushions, two armchairs were in the room. She sat down and sighed. "The usual?"
"What?"
"I didn't take calculus until I was in college."
So...OC development and later-on plot stuff. Yay.
"Awesome. How's your friend?"
Thor didn't listen. "Why's the baby elephant so upset?" Once Clint had started to call Peter 'baby elephant' the nickname had spread. Though, Thor had to be taught what the phrase 'elephant in the room' meant before he understood it.
"That's cheating, you lured him with food." Happy frowned.
Peter took the half hug, careful not to touch his Dad's injured side as they embraced. He listened to the metallic sound of his Dad's heartbeat and relaxed a little. This was normal, it was right. "I'm sorry."
"That wasn't so bad." Peter brushed himself off as he sat on the edge of the roof. "Kinda broke my rules, there was a bit more knives than anticipated..."
Peter laughed with her. "It's gonna be sunny today." He said, flexing the prosthetics. "School's starting soon, not sure I'm ready."
"Nope. Spider bite. Felt really sick for a few days, then it was fine." Peter shrugged.
"Dad? 'M fine."
"Victim blaming much?" Maggie asked. When she saw the flash of panic on Strange's face she laughed hysterically. Had he thought he'd offended her or something? She had her sensitive spots, sure, she knew that. But that was funny. "Look, the one on my leg was probably unavoidable, but the other two...yeah, I probably could have dodged the TWO assassins that were fighting me." She teased.
There are mentions of child abuse and past sexual assault of a minor in this chapter.
"Yeah, you should probably stick to your blue." He teased. "Green ain't your color."
Now, she had to survive.
Going to be some more fluff and character development for a time, because I need that now and we gotta set up for You-Know-Who.
But the bad guys had known that...hadn't they? That's why they'd been distracting him. Was Hong Kong still on fire or had it stopped once he'd left? He...didn't have the energy yet to check in with Wong. He wanted to be there for Maggie.
"Alright. Make sure you take your antibiotics first."
"And tomorrow we've got a lab day, kid. It's a date." Tony stated.
"Mmhm. Bad guy...mus' be smar'. They...so real." She tried to explain it. Were her brains completely scrambled or something? Was it the medicine or the injury that was making her feel so off? She hoped Strange wasn't just trying to comfort her. She wanted to help though. Even though Peter got away, the bad guys were still out there. Still able to hurt people. Make more monsters.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't sell yourself too short, kid. By the sounds of Tracy's praise, you're one hell of an engineer. Isn't that how you got the internship?"
"And Peter?"
-We got here first. See you on the the seven o'clock news, Stark.-
"And you can cry if you want to, but don't squish my baby elephant." Clint finished.
"And dessert." Tony chuckled, ruffling his hair. "You get to pick, Mr. Fancy-Dancer, you've earned it."
"Hey, sweetie. I'm just going to run a couple tests. I know you're tired and we want you to get lots of rest, so we'll make this quick, okay?"
"And your source?" Tony asked.
Peter tried to dance, but as he did, his body shifted. It was almost like people were hitting him, shoulder to shoulder, making him unsteady. He fell to the ground and didn't get up, curling in on himself.
"I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry. I've got you, bambino." Tony promised. It was all he could do. He couldn't fix PTSD. Couldn't stop the sadness or anything. He could only be there and hold his kid. "You, me, Steve. Cuddle session. Yeah?"
"Come on, tell me that it isn't partly satisfying?"
"You find something?" Tony's voice asked.
"Because he's a doctor and he cares about you. We know you aren't comfortable with most people, so we called for back-up, just in case." Vanessa frowned. "What's that look on your face for?"
"Me too." Tony whispered, resting head against Peter's. "He's too good for this world."
She looked concerned. "Yeah, I'm real."
Strange smiled gently and kissed her forehead, chastely.
"I don't...slow objects down. I mean...it looks like that and it's easier to say that because...that's what it looks like. But... The bottle wasn't falling slower. It still maintains its velocity. I just change time relative to it. Stretch the seconds. It's still being acted upon by all the same forces, just over a longer period of time relative to our time. So even if I 'slowed it down' all the way to the floor, it's still going to shatter the same way. It's physics. I don't change the force. Just the amount of time it takes. It's still going to hit the floor in half a second, that half a second is just...longer relative to ours... Same force...longer time frame...relatively. Time's confusing. It's a mess...trust me...I know. Sorry...Mr. Stark."
Peter stretched slowly. Something felt wrong. His spidersense had been going off ever since he left school and headed to dance. He glanced at Maggie. She was standing by the mirrored wall, not stretching at all. Her eyes were darting between herself, Peter, then somewhere beyond the walls quickly. Her danger sense must've been going haywire too, not a good sign.
Maggie groaned as her head hit the wall again. She kept her back pressed to the wall, so they couldn't see that she'd been digging into it. The brick was nearly loose. Her fingertips were bloody, her nails broken. She couldn't stop though. She felt some of her hair get ripped from her skull as the man yanked on it. "What are you doing with those powers of yours?"
Beck's eyes widened then he disappeared.
Peter grinned and leaned against the wall. Even though he was the only one in the elevator, the lights hadn't dimmed, which was a little weird, but didn't bug him. "How are you doing, J?"
Steve nodded. Without moving perceptively, to normal people anyway, he made a series of noises with small taps and brushes of his finger.
The principal glared at him. "Teenagers will give out their medications to their friends. We're stopping them from sharing their medications with other students."
"Sh." Peter shook his head. "Be cool."
"What? What are the extra minutes for?" Thor asked.
"Papa..." Peter started crying anew. He wanted to throw his arms around his papa, but he couldn't.
"Reduced to property, am I?"
"Oh, just because your step-daddy is dead, doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people who wouldn't jump at the opportunity to hurt you. Be good or we'll send someone in who's eager to meet you...and unlike step-daddy, he'll be REAL, Magnolia."
"Oh my God. Who could do this to a child?" Christine took a breath and schooled her face. "Okay. Let's...fix this."
Take care.
"Wait a moment...just...in case." Strange said. Then he leaned a little closer. "Margaret, I have to ask you a tough question. I'm sorry about that..."
"The hands 'ouched me...tha's how I knew they weren't real. They didn' feel like you. The hands were wrong."
"They're indoctrinated and end up working for the pigs."
"I'm a genius, I can figure out Gen-Z humor. I think you're all idiots, but I get it. But you're right, the media's going to be storming the tower. Lovely. Pep's going to be in a mood." Tony sighed.
"Thanks for being ahead of me, JARVIS." Tony sighed. "Dammit, we just got you settled back in too. I wanted things to get more normal not more crazy."
"I hate you." Maggie said, then her head snapped to the side. "So...I can't go to your side, Queens. Can you come to Brooklyn? Something big's about to go down."
"I'll wash dishes while you read, then you can dry them when I read?"
"Because your nice?" Peter asked.
Dr. Cho looked over at her. "She's good. No bad reactions with her transfusion, no clots or anything. Once she's awake, I'll probably suggest some pain meds and antibiotics and let her go home too."
"Comes with the territory. You and I both have that problem. We sense danger all the time. If we didn't have over thinking problems or anxiety, I think we'd have something really wrong with us."
"Can you wait until we're outside of the city limits, kid, or do we want to stop now?" Happy asked casually.
"I heard you had a project put on hold by Stark."
"If not for you, for me?" Steve asked.
"Until you can reliably do it, yes. The usual."
"Forget the girl. We have a real shot at taking down Iron Man. Get to the roof. Between you, Thor, and this new guy we might be able to bring him down."
Three, two, one.
"Yeah, tell him I'm helping him a friend. If things get crazy we'll call for bigger backup."
"It's not on you." Wade, surprisingly, said. "Bad guys do bad things, that's what they do. If it's not these guys, it would be Hydra or Francis or some other asshole. These douchebags snagged those kids, not you. So it isn't on you. We don't have the luxury of the blame game. We need to get Maggie and Peter back." He looked at Tony and Steve. "Now we need to find them." Then he looked at Vanessa. "Any luck yet?"
"It's not your fault, Strange."
"Alright, I'll take it. You let us know if you want more, okay? We'll get it for you." She got up and took the dishes away.
"Wow, never thought I'd see it. Got to see both Dr. Strange and Captain America's dark sides. Keep that up and you could be in the DCU." Wade grinned then sat next to Maggie. "Well, look at you all bright-eyed and bushytailed. How's my girl?"
"Right, made-up names. I'm Spiderman."
"I know a concerned dad when I see one, Strange." Christine patted his shoulders. "Go. You promised not to leave her. Don't steal ALL of my equipment."
"Yup."
"Thank you."
"Afraid not." Strange drawled.
You look like a loser either way.
"The attack ended moments after you left. It vanished. No sightings of the thing anywhere." Wong answered, his face fell. "You look like shit."
"Yes!" He cheered. "You're free to go annoy him on your own now. You pick the next artist when you head out, deal?"
He was only three streets from the church. He could rest once he got there.
"Of course."
"I've got you. I've got you." He wrapped his arm around her, his other hand still in hers. "You're safe. I've got you." He promised, before he lifted her in his arms.
He rubbed her head and neck, trying to help ease her pain.
"I agree."
"Give me three hours." Nat said, lifting her head suddenly from the table. "I'll get it. And if I don't, I'll just need a couple more minutes than that." She pushed herself back from the table.
Peter took another breath and nodded. He took out his phone and called his dad. It hadn't gotten through the full ring before it was picked up.
The song changed, one Peter didn't know.
Right?
He didn't know what he was expecting, but that was the BEST possible answer. Peter rolled backwards onto the roof and lost it. He wasn't sure his voice came out right, but between giggles he said, "You got grounded by Dr. Dad."
"Vanessa!" Maggie looked close to exploding.
"But what if there's trouble...you can't protect yourself now." She couldn't go back again. Peter knew that. If she tried, she'd likely just pass out, which would make whatever bad situation she was trying to get out of worse.
"It's my tower. That's why the name's up there, kid."
Steve pulled away. "Love you, bud."
Take care. <3
"Yes, you did, Trace." He rolled his eyes. "Well, good for you, kid. Getting a head start like this is really valuable. I hope we work on a project together sometime. Bet we could one-up Tracy on her coding."
"Look at that! Those are some pretty eyes, aren't they? Strange?"
"Fair enough."
Maggie turned and grinned up at her dad, stepping free of Peter's grip from when he'd carried her. "Hi, Dad." She smiled.
Maggie got up and the whole room spun. The girl next to her got up in a flash and put a hand on her shoulder.
They barely got started, then JARVIS spoke. "Captain, Peter, dinner is upstairs."
"Early implies a normal day-night cycle. I haven't slept so it's technically late for me." Tony snorted and finished his coffee. "You leave your old man in the dust, did you?"
Tony was brought out a little bit later, loopy on drugs. He didn't look too bad. Peter and Steve both curled up near Tony, glad that everyone was close. "It's over, right?" Peter asked Steve in a whisper.
"Well next time, don't worry about it." He nodded. "Get all your meds?"
"I didn' take any'ing else."
"It's the coldest winter on record. My suit has heaters, I don't think yours does." Her cringed and sat next to her.
"Eh...come in."
"Good, oh, I passed that APUSH test."
Peter thought about it. She did have a fair point. "Right. Must be cool to avoid leaving evidence."
'Egg rolls, enough to sink a ship. And kung pao.'
"Peter, you're getting a call from a Margaret Wilson, would you like to answer?"
"I know. We're just trying to all stay safe now, and I know it's rough. The hits keep coming, huh?"
"He's your son." Strange said in understanding. "Trust me, I'll let you know if he's in danger."
"Left hand or right?" The voice said. The audio quality was slightly different. Recorded on a different mike?
Steve smiled. "Yeah. Anything in particular you want?"
"Great. That's...not creepy at all."
"Stephen..."
"I'll walk her." The girl said, her voice low.
"I'm a doctor. I...sometimes stalk medical histories for fun." The last time she'd been injured he may have glanced at her chart. Maybe. He was a doctor, he got nosy. "It's even more fun when it's rare blood types."
"I heard about that. You're Maggie's new guardian, correct."
Peter slid backwards. "You're not Papa. Dad he's not Papa." Peter warned. Then he looked at his Dad. Was it just him or...was the sound a little off? The metallic heartbeat was coming from the wrong spot. Like it was...being played through a speaker, not coming from the man directly. That wasn't his Dad either, was it?
"What's up?" Ned asked in a hushed voice.
"Takes time." Maggie echoed. "I guess."
"Um...not really?" Maggie looked between the two of them. "What's up?"
"Stop teasing me." She punched his shoulder lightly. "It's just...it's nice there."
Tony and Steve sat next to each other by Peter's bed. Steve had changed in the bathroom and Strange handed him a beanie when he'd asked for a hat. Maggie didn't look like she'd wake up any time soon, but after what she'd been through, he was going to do everything he could to make sure not to freak her out...but he wasn't going to leave Peter.
"Yes. My revenge senses are tingling. I'm angry and ready to fight. Aren't you?"
Maggie giggled.
"Okay."
"I agree. Stane is ruthless. I don't think he'll pull punches just because you're a kid. If he thinks he can get something from you or hurt you to get to Tony. I almost don't want you at school for now but..."
"Don't worry at all. Now, June, July...who cares? As long as you feel better."
Dr. Strange looked at her like she was an idiot.
"Hey." Maggie called with a wave. "We're all friends here. Sorry."
"I thought... you might be mad."
"Noted, Karen."
"Riiiiight." Maggie deadpanned. She knew she could. She knew there was a brick that she could loosen... Would she really kill someone to escape this room? Could she? "What do you want?"
"Why would I ever let that go? Blackmail of any kind should be kept forever, didn't you know?" Tony poked at him.
Pain flashed in the inside of her skull. She couldn't move for a moment, everything hurt. Maggie cried against the floor and spat up blood. The lights, every noise. It all hurt. She felt her powers working, but she couldn't tell what they were doing, she was too disoriented. Something told her, whatever her powers were doing, it was important.
"Staying at the Sanctum this weekend. I've got finals next week. Strange is better at helping me study than Wade or Vanessa. Kinda a long cram session."
"Well, shit. This means war." Peter pointed to her. He thought for a moment. Then proceeded to dance the Single Ladies.
"Dad?" Peter's eyes widened.
"Already paid for, Peter."
"Yeah." Maggie quietly returned to her food.
"Hey, sweetheart, can you open your eyes for me?"
A severed pinky finger was in the box.
Tony rolled his eyes but agreed to the terms as he got up. "Thanks, Cho."
"Fuck the curfew. I need some air."
Maggie smiled shyly. "I'm glad you liked it. I just got Dad to play Pokemon for the first time. It was great."
Strange glared at him.
Maggie laughed. Then looked at it. He'd thought to make sure that she'd be safe, even if her powers acted up. If he hadn't done that... She would have been dead and Peter...he might not have been found.
"I'm here, my girl." Vanessa promised, taking Maggie's hand easily.
"Okay. Laertes; time be thine, and thy best graces spend it at thy will. But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son."
"Good."
What was real anymore aside from the pain and constant mind-fuck? How many days had it been? Had it been a week? Weeks?
Peter took a few deep breaths and hid his hands in his hoodie pockets. A gloved hand landed on his shoulder. "Hey." He turned and smiled at Maggie. "You did great out there."
"Or I could watch you get yourself hurt when it backfires and then I can heroically save the day." Wong suggested.
Maggie smiled and leaned against her pillow again. Her arm was tugged on by the needle in it.
"Sorry, I tend to talk in weird silences. I haven't shut up yet, am I bothering you?"
"It's okay." Nat promised. "You can finish the food, okay?"
Then he saw two people step in front of him.
She took a deep, shaky breath...then lunged. The brick hit his temple. The man stumbled and staggered for a moment. But quickly regained himself and tackled her. Maggie screamed when the brick was knocked from her hand.
That was the wrong answer. Peter smiled though and pulled his phone from his pocket, dialing Steve's number.
"No. But you are trending on youtube."
"Again. I would like to state my disagreement with your judgement."
"What's a dance you haven't done that you want to?"
Peter walked down three steps. His spidersense screamed at him.
Ned had not been totally cool about it. Once they both got in the back of Happy's car, he started asking questions. Peter just sighed and smiled, listening to Ned theorize about all sorts of weird things. "Do you lay eggs?"
Beck rubbed his face. All in all, not to bad for a test run. His research had paid off. He could wait just a little bit longer to make sure his last problem wasn't around. He knew, in theory, who Dr. Strange was. The only problem was that while Beck could make it look like reality was bending. Strange actually COULD. And by the looks of things he had a close relationship with the girl.
Steve looked down at the long line of calculations. "Looks like you've put in quite a bit of work. Time to rest for a little while. You can get back to it after a break."
"Thank Lizzy for that, I told her what I wanted to portray and she really did great designing it." Peter blushed.
Steve let go of the metal and looked up at Peter, tears spilling from his eyes. He cupped Peter's face in his hands and gently began to tap on his face. The same pattern in Morse. Over and over.
"Peter's been on the news for his internship, dumbass. But I know you aren't smart enough to read headlines, so next time just look at the pictures." MJ said, shoving her own shoulder into Flash's as she walked by. "Hey, losers." She nodded to them before going down the rest of the stairs and holding her hand out to Gwen.
Tony and Steve broke into raucous laughter.
"This building?" Tony asked.
Steve nodded. "I'm coming with you."
It was just so...real, so reflective of Peter's life. Tony felt his heart break, remembering the sad boy, the one he'd had to chase after to get him to come home, to get off the streets.
"Fair enough." Tony agreed.
"Hey, Thor? Could you bring the lightning?" Clint asked.
"Her phone is." Karen answered.
Alright, guys. Here's some warnings. Kidnapping, torture, physical violence, mental and psychological torture, threat of sexual assault (none takes place but it is threatened), and in general just some not nice imagery of death and suffering.
"Sounds fair." Maggie shrugged. "So, not that I'm bothered, but why are you following me?"
His gray-blue eyes widened, then his face fell a little. "No. You're fine." He sighed and squeezed her hand. "Perfectly healthy...aside from the fact that your flesh is being held together artificially. We're all here looking after you."
Tony felt his eyes water and he passed the open booklet to Steve. Steve looked at it and his eyes too, shimmered with tears. Steve leaned over and kissed Tony's temple. "We have a good kid."
"Okay. If anyone approaches you, let me know. I'll take care of it."
"Dr. Strange went there with nothing." Maggie protested. He'd done okay.
Maggie's eyes blinked. She shook her head as if to clear a daze. Then she met Peter's eyes and ran forward. She grabbed his hand and pulled him out of the building, grabbing her their bags as she ran.
"The first time I confronted them, there was a sixth man, he stabbed me while I was confronting the others. I fought them off for a time. Then you showed up. They shot at me and you just...jumped in front of me. Everything went sideways so I reset everything, went back ten minutes, took out the sixth man first this time."
"I'm guessing there's a toothbrush on the bathroom counter."
"Okay." Strange nodded. "But, you need to talk to Wilson about working on long range attacks."
"It's only because all the blood is in your head."
"Of course." She nodded against him. "She's going to be alright. Is she...do you know her? She a student of yours or...something else?"
"Think fast." Tony said.
Peter made a noise, he wasn't sure what it meant.
Something weird crossed his face, but he schooled it before she knew what it was. "Super healing, isn't a gift you can learn. Though, I may be able to teach you...something like it. If you keep practicing." He looked back down and gently began to clean the area.
Maggie squinted at the other lady. "Are you real?"
"Thanks, J. Five more minutes." Peter commented.
"Dr. Christine Palmer, used to work with Dr. Strange. Now...I'm taking care of children in an alternate dimension and I'm...so very confused, but here for it." She shrugged, pulling the needle and heading to wash up. "Alright. Let's see the damage."
"Call from Ms. Potts, sir."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Exactly. Who is Jessie?"
"Refusing treatment at the moment. She doesn't seem comfortable. Do you know someone who might ease her mind? Help her relax?" The nurse asked. "She won't even let us look and see what's hurt. I don't know the extent of her injuries...but I don't like the look of her face...or the blood on her clothes. I don't know how much of it is hers."
"True." Maggie nodded. "Sorry. I'll cast a good luck spell."
Strange looked up at it and with a twist of his wrist, the glass repaired itself.
"He was holding me down. I...I know he's an Avenger, but he scared me."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hello, Peter. It is so nice to finally meet you." A warm woman's voice said.
"Ooh, coffee. You're the best." Tony grabbed it with his right hand and took a sip. "That's not coffee."
"Karen?"
Steve felt his heart plummet. "Stane must not like that."
Peter raised an eyebrow at him. A whole bottle of Advil would do nothing except make his stomach turn.
Peter waved and JARVIS let him into the lab. "Hey, Dad, I've got Maggie with me. That alright?"
"Um, she seems in good spirits. How did you know it was me?"
Peter laughed and pulled away from Tony. "Thank you."
"What would you do? Oh strategic one?" Tony demanded.
"You don't have to go see him if you don't want to. You're what, fourteen like me? I'm sure you won't burn down your place."
Dr. Strange blinked and looked at her. "What do you mean drones?"
Peter didn't look toward his dad. He wouldn't lose focus. He couldn't attack Steve's legs. He'd expect that, because it worked. Peter KNEW he could take down Steve if he went for the legs, that meant Steve would be guarding them.
Tony laughed and looked down at his watch. "Shit, Pep's gonna be pissed. We're supposed to meet her for wedding stuff."
"You're no fun." Peter huffed. They walked in silence for a few minutes. And Peter started to recognize the area. "Best of luck with your studying and all."
"That should be front page news. You and I should call the Paparazzi."
Peter didn't listen, as best as one could with super hearing. If Maggie needed help, she'd call. And Doctor Strange was bossing around a couple of nurses, not even in a mean way, but in a concerned-doctor way. "Order me two units, if you've got them. If you don't have it, I'll do with two of the O-. Have a third on standby, just in case, I don't know how much was in her clothes. And nothing funky in it. I know you deal with radioactive up here, but she's not. Normal, human, blood will work." He started talking specific pain meds and technical terms Peter didn't understand, but he figured Maggie was going to be well taken care of.
"For you, Mr., always."
"I did manage to stab the guy." Maggie muttered. That was the wrong move.
"Oh, this is a movie?" Steve asked.
"JARVIS, I need my systems back, buddy."
Tony stood on the porch, coffee in hand, his hair an utter mess.
"What're you hungry for, Bud?" Steve called.
That was weird. She was always at practice. They'd been working on this for a month. The performance was in two weeks. Peter was hoping to get this down, it would be the first one his parents could see. And he'd picked the song for them. Isabelle had let him take control over their project. He'd said he wanted to tell a sad story with a happy ending, she'd suggested songs and let him pace it once Peter'd talked about his story. He hadn't told her all the details, only that it was sort of a love story to both the family he'd lost and his found family. She'd picked the song Ashes and they were really starting to come up with something.
"Yeah, let's go."
"Oh?" Peter frowned. "Where are you going?"
"Mr. Wilson. This is a medical ward." Dr. Strange intercepted him and Vanessa.
"Thanks, Aaron."
"Yeah." Tony shook his head. "Sometimes I forget how much you don't know."
"I only stepped on your foot twice today." Steve defended with a put-on pout.
"What's going on up there?"
"Jesus..."
"I would just like to point out that I'm not the crazy one. For the first time, I'm the fucking sane one." Tony shook his head.
"Great things." Tony agreed. "Karen should talk to JARVIS and give me feedback on how the suit worked, but if you think of anything you need or want, let me know."
"Show me the room." That was Dr. Strange's voice.
"Hm. I've always been able to tell if good or bad things will happen. When I was young my powers kicked in when I walked by someone in a weird fight. My mutation developed earlier than most, probably because I was exposed to an... a source of a lot of power. I'm not very good in school."
"I can do that." Strange raised his hands.
"Believe me, I'll know if it's not you." Tony smiled.
"What do those incense things do?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Mood." Peter said as Steve laughed.
It's not an excuse, but it is what's been going on. I've missed ya'll. <3
Tony laughed. "Huh. Nice. Didn't know that about your powers. Good grasp of physics, young lady."
Vanessa rubbed her shoulders gently. "Okay. Well, Dr. Strange will definitely look after you. We can be there any time and you can come back any time."
Steve swallowed.
Maggie rolled her eyes.
Also, this chapter was almost titled Meet Cute. :-D
The woman in blue disarmed all of the men.
"Oh, so they can hear me? Yeah, all adorable. Best looking family award goes to the Starks. Stark-Rogers? Rogers-Starks? Do they hyphenate? No, I bet Tony's got them all as Starks."
"I don't need the girl anymore. Allen, get me everything you can on this church. Everyone else, go to location three...get the chair ready."
"Oh...hell."
"She did not!" Peter glared over his shoulder at Lizzy, who shrugged and waved with a smirk.
Tony gave him a 'don't know, don't care' look and waved him off.
Ben's voice filled the air and Peter felt tears well up in his eyes.
"Nope. I'm not telling you shit until you talk to me. Why are you ignoring me?" She demanded.
Strange reached a shaky hand and grabbed the necklace on the bedside table. "Thought it might be weird... I hoped to never have to use it, but you were getting stronger and I though 'what if she gets stuck in a time loop or end up in the future or past?' so... I wanted to be able to find you if something happened with your powers...turns out it worked for something else." He frowned.
The video ended.
"SHIELD has me saying it's a bodyguard that I outfitted. I'm going to run with it. Don't need more people coming down on our family." Tony nodded.
"An archaic curse word."
Most teens seemed to have a hard time with the Bard, he couldn't imagine trying to get through it with a learning disability on top of it. "Read it aloud."
Tony frowned at looked at Steve. "That poor girl has been through a lot."
Peter didn't need to debate. "Talk to you later, Karen." He sighed before taking his mask off and shaking his hair out.
"Sorry, I'm late."
"Yup. You figured out my secret identity. I'm Natalie Portman."
In other words, Beck's a heartless asshole.
"I'm alright, you?" Peter asked.
"No-"
"You haven't headed out?"
Tony opened his mouth.
"And believe me, this is only the beginning." Beck said enthusiastically.
"Fine. If you don't want me here. Fine." Peter snatched up his bag. "I'm heading out. I need some air." Peter couldn't stand there and take any more jabs. His brain was slipping. The last thing Peter wanted was to deal with more trauma. His life was stressful as it was.
"Could use a break, actually. Haven't read this much since starting my training in the mystic arts." He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his forehead with a shaky hand. "What's your problem?"
"You've got it, kid." Steve smiled. "See you in the morning."
"Wha'?" Maggie would have raised her eyebrows if it didn't hurt so much. Four hours of surgery?
Wong looked up at him, then pulled his headphones off. "Yeah, Strange. Sounds like a great idea. Next time I'll blast the next frightening little girl who shows up here to Bermuda. Ask questions later, am I right?"
Maggie couldn't even question what the men were talking about, because Ness squeezed her into a tight embrace. "God, you're gonna suffocate me."
"Hey, Pete." Steve walked across the porch and stood above him. "Couldn't sleep?"
"Hey." Vanessa said, her voice soft. "It's okay. He's safe here." She promised. "Christine helped Strange with Maggie's surgery. Christine's safe, she's good people."
"She's in room four-thirty-one." Christine said. "I've got stitches to put in a Mr. Aaron Davis. Apparently got stabbed. Would be nice to have a neurosurgeon check on the head trauma." She said, then walked away. She headed toward Aaron Davis' room, but heard Not-Dr. West's angry tone.
Peter let his suit fall away and quickly got changed into some warmer clothes. He took off his prosthetics and headed into the living room.
"I could...my focus is off though. Things are just sort of...jumping into my head. Not e-e-exactly fool p-proof at the moment. Just guessed some random-ass numbers." She shrugged. "I think Nat knew, she laughed at him."
"That wasn't the answer I was looking for. So I'll just have to guestimate, won't I?"
"Think Cape-y's more loyal to you than to me." Strange said dryly.
"H-hi."
"'Sup, dude?"
"We're family Stark. We got your back. Go be with Cap and Peter."
"Yes, you can, you'll balance better if you do."
"I dunno. It's genius." Maggie shrugged. Then there it was. That huge moment. She adored Mads because he could say a million things with the tiniest expression. The sheer relief and adoration in that simple look Hannibal gave Will. If the series didn't end with those two actually together, she didn't know what she'd do...maybe find a way to alter time.
Take care.
"Still nothing, Beck."
"And I told you Dolly was a great choice, though, there was decidedly a lack of swords, you got to step up your game, Mags. Next time, I expect weaponry to be involved. I can give you a few tips. Dubstep is great with weapons." The merc turned when Maggie waved to Peter. "Oh, hello, Peter." Wade said, smirking at Peter. "You did good out there, cutie."
"I'm not time's bitch." Maggie laughed and handed it over.
"Of course, Little Miss Pool."
"No shame in finding someone attractive. That Tony Stark is my favorite, definitely on me and Wade's cheat list...oh my God, he is YUMMY and you can bet your ass he knows how to treat people."
"Hope you like hot chocolate." His nose wrinkled a little at the smell of peppermint. Maggie liked mint though. He figured he was fine as long as he didn't have any of it.
Maggie's face pinched in confusion and tears filled her eyes. "But..." Her face pinched and tears rolled down her face.
"I know. One day it'll be normal again. Right now we all got to be on the same team, alright?"
Maggie quickly looked away. The oxygen was starting to feel nice, soothing her lungs. Her head still felt light, really light.
Maggie was surprised nothing hurt, she imagined it was the painkillers still in her system. She walked through the portal, glad that Wade was supporting her, even though she didn't feel pain. Her head felt light. Wade helped her through the living room and into her room. "Thanks."
"Did you put him up to it?"
Strange sighed again, somewhere in that sigh, his breath choked, a sob breaking through.
Maggie knew she was supposed to laugh, she didn't have the energy to.
Peter frowned. This was...not good.
"How's the rest of the team?"
"I'm glad you're okay too." Peter curled a little closer. "I tried to stay more on the defensive with Stane. I know you didn't want me fighting him alone, but I had to keep him away from you."
Peter considered throwing a punch. The bell rang. He let out a breath. He must've been really stressed out to almost punch Flash at some lighter-than-normal bullying. "See ya." Peter turned and held a hand out to Ned to help him up. "Time to go."
That's when Maggie noticed the red on her legs. "Cape-y."
"I think God has abandoned our timeline." Peter grinned.
"Plus they're both adorable." Tony shrugged.
Peter started a conversation with Tony, hoping it would help her feel more at ease. When Steve came back, wearing a cap, Peter glanced at Maggie. She lifted her head to look at him, blushed a little, then held out her hand. Steve took it and shook it.
Peter finished his food quietly then got up, gathering some for Steve. "Um, well...I'll be going."
"Yes." Strange nodded. "You shouldn't be out here unarmed, Stark."
"Opening sealed doors to other dimensions."
"Holy shit, you really were de-aged."
Steve followed him into the hotel. There were people all around. And they were shouting. Then there was something bursting up through the building. A large fire-y creature. "Wasn't this thing in Hong Kong?"
"How long have you been working on that?" Maggie asked.
"Well, they don't have JARVIS."
"Of course."
Steve ran faster than he had in his life. He needed to get to Tony, to help him before the Avengers turned the fight against him. The team would think Iron Man was the real threat, not Stane. Steve needed to get there first to try to do something, to...intervene before the rest of the Avengers did.
"Yeah, if I need to come home early, I'll let you know. I feel...alright at the moment."
"Well, duh. He thinks he's alone with Karen, but there's no way I'm taking JARVIS out of that suit. The kid's on training wheels." Tony snorted. "But I'm still glad he took it easy."
"Are you okay?" Peter asked.
All of his things were gone, except for some of the lights. He was glad it was late spring, he wouldn't freeze, but he wished he'd left a pillow. He curled up away from the leaky part of the ceiling and curled into a ball. He needed some rest. He just needed to close his eyes for a little bit, then he could go get help. Maybe Pastor Aaron would help him.
It was so on.
"Please tell me we've got good news from Hong Kong." Beck said, glaring. "I've got everything else ready, so you'd better not be slowing our progress."
"French?"
Maggie made another sound of protest. "Noise, it hurts."
"What? I'm kind of busy with an experiment."
Maggie laughed. "We should call you weatherman."
"I'm going to start sending pieces to you, Stark. Scraps of your son. That's how it works with you, right? You take what isn't yours and leave behind the scraps? I'm thinking...fingers, hands, arms, feet, legs... Then do we drop the rest in the river or let him starve? That depends, I suppose. Both feel appropriate. Both feel similar to how you stole from me, from us. Be talking soon, Stark. We'll send further gifts directly to you, is that alright?"
The teacher snatched her phone away and shut it off. "You can have it after class. Stop disrupting."
As a weird note, I just want to say I haven't plotted ANYTHING in this, but Peter's invention worked out to be needed for the sequel and the thing that Peter is missing has been mentioned in the first story several times. So much little things have actually worked story and plot wise. Apparently no plotting is great.
Clint sighed. "Do all buildings from the fifties that are set to be demolished have Stark locks on the front door?" He asked, continuing his casual walk down the street.
Maggie lifted hers and touched his tentatively, as if checking on something, then she lowered her hand and relaxed. "Yeah?"
Peter sent him a heart and crossed the street, rushing to Maggie. He turned the corner. "Maggie, are you okay?"
Within minutes. Maggie was passed out. Vanessa and Wade sat on one side of her, Vanessa held her hand. Strange on her other side, keeping a silent, calm vigil.
"What?" Strange asked.
Strange looked confused. He hadn't gotten any calls. No texts, no messages. Nothing. "I haven't gotten any calls." Strange said, his eyes wide, glossy. He strode forward and looked at the images. His eyes lingered on Maggie and his hands formed tight fists. He'd never felt anything so consuming before. All at once, more anger and concern than he'd ever known in his life hit him like a freight train. Love. He loved Margaret. And thinking of her in pain hurt. What if she'd died and he'd never known? She was suffering and he wasn't helping. It hurt more than any pain he'd known, his time in the dark dimension included. And he was furious, murderous at the people who'd hurt her.
Strange tilted his head in gratitude. "Find Peter... I hope he's okay." Strange said.
Peter nodded. "Call me if you need me."
Maggie blinked and turned to look at him. "Do you seriously have all his lines memorized? The guy never stops gabbing."
Peter frowned. Nothing weird had happened today. In fact, it was a good day. Aside from the press, Peter didn't even feel like he was being watched. It was the first time in a long time he hadn't felt watched. He didn't know if he could tell her anything. There was nothing weird about any of his day. Not at all. Not even his spidersense went off, well, aside from the usual 'loud noise here' and 'there's a fly in the vent' warnings that always happened. He shrugged and rolled over. He'd talk to her about it later. He wondered what was bothering her and prayed it wasn't anything too bad.
"We still don't have everything on Stane." Steve sighed. "We know he's working with terrorist groups, but he keeps all that somewhere we can't access it. Even JARVIS can't. We've, well, Tony's been trying to get dirt on him for a long time."
"Damn right you do, underoos."
"Do you think you're fooling me with that sass?"
Dr. Strange huffed out a breath. "Right. I'm going to go get some meds. She should have some pain relief and rest."
Maggie fiddled with her gloves. "Do you think it's possible?"
Peter closed his eyes so he wouldn't have to see May. And when he opened them, he was in an empty room. What the fuck? His aunt had been there, dead, broken at his feet, just as broken as she'd been after her accident. But now there was nothing, but a room. His hands were bound behind his back.
Maggie raised her hand and knocked on the door of 177 Bleeker Street. There was no answer, so she pushed open the door and stepped in. The air inside the Sanctum, as always, was electric. Maggie knew it wasn't the sanctum itself. She always felt stronger, more powerful when she was around Doctor Strange, and it wasn't him that did it. It was that thing he wore around his neck. Though, there was a comfort to being around the man himself, not just the stone. She'd seen the stone once, back when the other lady had worn it. The stone glowed the same color that she did when she used her powers. She liked being around it, it made her feel strong, but it also made her mind a little fuzzy, a little less logical and more chaotic.
"Will do." Steve smiled.
"You alright?" Steve whispered in the dark.
"You're alright, Margaret."
"But-"
Awkward, trembling hands rubbed her shoulders and her hair.
"Glad you like it. And since you got through most of the first act, what do you like to watch. Doctor Who, maybe?"
"What?" Strange's eyebrows pulled together. "Uh, you're going to want...more probably. This isn't going to be just a couple days."
She didn't say anything, her eyes still empty.
"If these numbers are right-"
"Let the arachnid fall for a while longer or 'un-woosh' him...? Hmm." Strange puzzled.
She picked up the necklace and turned it over in her hands. It was cute. The patterns in the metal almost reminded her of a Celtic knot. The gray stone had ripples of faint color in it. It didn't really match anything. But nothing Maggie ever wore matched. Her gloves never matched her outfits. Her watch, with its worn military green band, didn't match anything ever. She didn't care. She wore what she liked. The sorta funky necklace was cool. She put it on over her head before she changed. Then she headed out to the kitchen again.
"It's okay. Learning new stuff is fun. Tracy's been teaching me coding. Mr. Stark's been teaching me a lot about engineering. Though, I think the best day ever was getting to work with Dr. Banner. We did some awesome bio-chem experiments. Totally up my ally."
"That particular section of the brain is responsible for quite a bit. But we'll get back to that. There's some normal things that'll happen with head trauma. Blurry vision, disorientation, dizziness, confusion, speech issues, haziness, memory problems, headaches, nausea. Those things are going to be normal. It's okay. Rest is going to help a lot with those things. Those are just general things that will crop up." He nodded. "Then there are specific things connected to that spot. These are some of the things we're going to have to pay attention to. The front most part of that section that was damaged helps with moderating emotions. If you feel a lot of emotions or more than normal, that could be because of the trauma, it could also go the other way and leave you feeling numb or...emotionless. The backmost part that was effected has to deal with mobility. I can already see some improvements in that, so that's good. The most impacted spot, the middle of that area, controls focus...sort of your ability to zone in on one task at a time or prioritize your tasks."
"Training exercises." Tony shrugged.
"Is she...?" The nurse stood to look at Maggie.
"Why?" Steve asked. "They're robots."
"That's normal." He stood. "Just eyeballing the blood here, and you're probably down at least a unit of it, you need stitches and you need to get cleaned up so you don't get an infection. You need some air too." He stepped forward and put a hand gently on her shoulder. "I can stay here with you and let them do their job, or I can do it myself."
"The little red-haired girl? Oh, see, how it works is: when you don't need something anymore...well, you don't need it. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't sell you out, we found you on our own. Her body is probably bobbing past the Brooklyn Navy Yard at this point."
"Yeah. What are these spells for?"
"I can't."
"That's a good mindset, but be cautious. Press can make your life a living hell. Best to maintain at least a semi-neutral place with them." Tony sighed. "Doesn't matter. The facts will come out soon."
Ned patted Peter's shoulder and gave him a thumbs up.
That WASN'T his Dad.
Peter knew exactly how she felt. He grinned at her. "Thank you."
"And that is?" Tony asked.
"Straight from heaven." Vanessa laughed. "That's my girl."
Everything was ready. He'd found out how to trick both of their abilities. They'd never see the danger coming until they were already deep in the trap.
"Sorry." Maggie frowned. "I turned it on silent for meditation. Haven't looked at it. My fault."
"Here, so I added this section to the coding, want to look at it for me?"
"Good." Strange nodded. "Would you like to do some training?"
"Um, I caught a car thief. I got this kid a new ice cream from the truck when he dropped his. I helped a lady home, she was being stalked so I helped stop her stalker too. It was pretty calm. Glad it wasn't too crazy."
When Vanessa walked into the living room with a bag of snacks and Maggie's prescriptions, she met Wade's eyes. "So...are we going to talk about what happened?"
Tony laughed and got to work. He felt safer with Steve at his side. "You're going to have a hell of a time explaining this to your team."
Peter could be Spiderman, but the Friendly Neighborhood sort...not the 'taking down Iron Man' sort.
"Oh, this? It's keeping pressure on my wrist. Might be a small fracture there." Tony smirked.
"Mmhm." Strange fixed up two plates.
"You're getting better. We can do some more studying tomorrow. Okay?"
"You've got some mad talent, buddy." Steve said proudly.
The anchor was discussing a picture, then a film taken on a phone. Steve sighed. It was of him, in the restaurant. His own phone illuminated his face as he smiled and texted Peter. The ring on his left hand was clearly visible by how he held his phone. "Well, shit."
Five updates in one day might be my max. But, hey, it was a good run.
Also, I'm not a doctor. I did research and made some shit up as I went. Hopefully it's close.
"Sorry, can't help with that." Maggie smiled. "Your wizard is in a different universe."
"Hey, kid." Tony came through and ruffled his hair. "I hope that's water and not sweat, kiddo." He leaned forward and sniffed. "Shampoo. I'm good. How was today?"
Maggie wasn't going to try them on. It would require her to take off her current set. "I'm sure they're perfect." Her phone went off. "Um, sorry." She picked it up. She'd set an alert on her phone for any update from Hong Kong. After the few hours of reprieve...it was under attack again. An image showed a fiery beast standing in the streets. In the background she could see a whole blown in the side of a building with a familiar window. She felt her eyes water, and dabbed at the corners of them quickly. "Sorry."
Tony soaked up what was on the page, because Peter had kept his dance very hush-hush. The song was one Tony had never heard of before, at least he didn't recognize it by name, it was called Ashes and apparently had an intro added to it. But then he saw the description, written by Peter.
Then Strange heard it. A loud creak. He turned. A man APPEARED in her room. He'd seen that man before...that monster in the news. He WAS in her room. Strange froze time and walked forward.
"Thanks. I'm finally done. Now no more worrying about assigned stories." She smiled. There was something off about her smile. She'd seemed a little...off for the last few days. She looked like she hadn't slept. Maybe it was finals that bugged her. Peter wasn't going to ask if she didn't want to talk about it.
"I'll let it slide." The shirt and pants were seamless. She could probably wear them under most of her normal clothes without them showing through. "Real question here?"
"He's a sweetie. Give him to me. I'll carry him, then you need to hop on my back, like a piggyback ride, okay? I'll carry you both, you gotta be brave though, okay?"
"Mmhm."
"You look fine, Roo." Tony kissed his temple. "We're here for you."
None of this was real, was it? Peter wondered. The screams that came from Maggie now...didn't sound quite right. Like they'd been recorded. Had they ever had her? Had they killed her already? Were they just recordings to keep him scared? His parents weren't real. May wasn't real. Ben wasn't real. Maybe it ALL wasn't real.
"Always." Peter promised, but didn't move to get up.
"Were you seriously going to leave without your favorite workout clothes? Jeez, kid." Vanessa worked like a whirlwind and shoved one more bag into Maggie's hands. "There, that's more reasonable. Now you won't have to do laundry every two days, dummy."
"I'll second that." Maggie looked at her gloves and briefly saw the blood come back. She shook her head and took them off before dabbing her eyes dry.
Peter turned. The whole world was still to his eyes. The bad guy's body was still, but the arms were still moving, coming at him, thankfully a little slower. Peter ran forward, ducked under them. He wrapped the man tightly in webs, then looked at the harness on the baddie's back.
It was a little insensitive. Usually Peter'd be upstairs working with Tony in his lab. He was only downstairs so much because of the injuries Tony'd gotten. "Um...?" It wasn't like Tracy to make comments like that. She liked everyone. Yeah, she always teased about wanting to keep Peter on her floor, but she wouldn't go that far. Never say anything happy about her boss getting hurt.
"These ones can come out..." Strange said as he looked at the sutures on her shoulder.
"My assessment precisely."
"Fair enough."
There was a knock again. "Sweetie...?"
Steve turned red. "Tony!" He scolded.
Peter tried to tear open the harness. The arms were moving toward him again, shifting directions. He couldn't find a way to get it open.
"Hate it." Maggie huffed. Her dad hadn't turned away from helping others. Even when he was off the clock, he'd helped people. "And I miss dancing."
"Don't listen to anything he says, he's lying." Tony said. "This game is totally in my favor. I own most of the properties and...oops, is that another hotel you landed on, Pete? Pay up."
Maggie's number is made up. Took a Brooklyn area code from the area I imagine she lives. Then spelled out Maggie with the corresponding keypad-numbers. The 7 is a bonus little nod to my future plans. Annnyways, he's a chapter. Along with more foreshadowing hidden in fluff.
Maggie got up and looked in the bag her clothes had been shoved in. Even the gloves were ruined. The only thing she found that wasn't soaked in blood or torn was the necklace she'd been wearing. She pulled it from the bag and put it on. Her shoulder felt tight and she felt her stitches pull at the actions. So she gave up the clothes and got into bed. She could do with some rest.
"Mostly good. Forgotten a few things. Still struggle with talking sometimes when I'm multitasking. Actually all multitasking sucks. I can't focus on much, but Strange is helping me with it. He says he'll fast-forward my hair once my head heals a bit more... I can't wait for that. I miss my hair." She played with the short strands. "How are you doing?"
Take care. <3
"First need to find them, sir." JARVIS responded.
"Take it that's a call for you?" Aaron wondered.
Tony cried quietly in relief, in anger, in sadness, in mourning, in joy... It was all of it. He leaned against Steve for support and Steve leaned back against them as the both held onto Peter's arm. Across the bed they could see his left hand. Thumb and forefinger next to three wrapped stubs. The bruises on his face were fading slowly. His chest was wrapped up on his shoulder.
Peter stopped and listened. "Dad?" That was his heartbeat, not a recording. "Papa..."
She sighed. "You're welcome. You keep your daughter safe."
"Margie."
"Back off, asshole!" Ned shouted.
"Got any classic ones you know?" Peter did in his best Elvis voice, which was NOT good.
"YES!" She sprinted away, up the stairs.
"Huh, guess more than Queens knows I exist."
"Thank you."
"Can't imagine he likes emojis."
Peter lifted his head. A figure in a gold suit and...smoke-filled fish bowl on his head.
"Done?" But she hadn't felt anything.
"They said he broke his wrist, said it'll only be a few weeks in a splint. Said he's going to be fine, a bit bruised up though." Peter told him.
"Any time." She promised with a nod. Then her head swiveled sharply. "Wade?"
"Welcome home, Peter."
She jolted and took a sharp breath.
Peter ran forward.
"I get headaches sometimes... I find doing more than one thing at a time bugs me. Like walking and chewing gum. Before all this, that was easy. Now, I feel like it takes all my focus. I think that's why I stutter too sometimes. If I'm thinking too much my mouth forgets what I'm saying mid-way through. It gets worse when I'm stressed. There are some things I don't remember very well, but I'm okay. I'm healing." Maggie frowned.
"I'm going to try to...simplify this so we can all be on the same page. The big words I've got will just leave us both confused and we don't need that, okay?" He forced a smile, then leaned forward.
"No sharpness?" He asked seriously.
"Take it." Peter insisted. "What's happening?"
Peter moved the quickest. He jumped between here and Steve. The staff pressed against his chest instead of Steve's. "Hey, you're okay. We're all friends. Good guys. We're good guys."
"You're good, though, right?"
"Hey, kiddo." Tony called. "Cold out?"
"A signal maybe?" Steve asked. "They could overhear words if they're somehow watching us."
"We weren't doing anything." Steve grinned. "Got my hands above the belt and everything."
"Right behind you." Maggie nodded.
Maggie groaned and leaned her head against the wall.
Ness grinned and kept massaging her feet and ankles.
Peter huffed, but landed on the side of a building. He saw his Dad struggling. There was no one to help him. Thor and Stane were fighting him. It was stupid, as if Thor assumed the enemy of his enemy was a good guy. Peter needed to stop this.
"See you, my dude." Ned waved.
"Okay."
Maggie shrugged and got up. "Okay."
So, Maggie didn't just have a 'danger sense' like Peter did. She could manipulate time and fly as well. Cool. "It was nothing."
Aaron smiled. "People deal with stress in all sorts of ways. Some lash out and regret what they say. I've met your dad, he loves you very much, Peter. I don't think he'd ever want to intentionally hurt you. So give it some time to cool off. I'm sure things'll get clearer."
Strange smiled. "Learning and accepting I wasn't doing everything right."
"That's good thinking, kiddo." Beck squeezed his shoulder. "You're a good kid and a smart one. This is only the beginning of what you're capable of. Drink up the moment, okay?"
The doors opened and Tony looked up. "Hey, honey."
"I can try, but sometimes the powers just don't work with me."
"Is he serious?" Maggie asked after Tony left.
"He's a KID, a blameless child. And you took Maggie Wilson too, she has nothing to do with anything you have against me. You don't need to hurt those kids."
"It was a good message." Peter nodded and turned to Aaron, not taking his mask off. There were too many cameras around for him to do so safely. No one was looking up, but he didn't want to chance it.
"He was here...he had to be. Where did he go?" Tony asked. It didn't look like they'd taken Peter. It looked like he'd fought and gotten away. But...where were the bad guys?
"Ugh... I think I blacked out for a moment." Maggie grunted, then opened her eyes.
"Lizzy?" Peter stopped everything he was doing to go help her to the bench. "Oh my gosh, are you okay?"
Maggie looked at the books. "What's yours?"
Peter's eyes widened. "Where is she?"
It took a solid second before the applause started, as if no one wanted to break the moment. The man, likely Maggie's father, let out a loud woot again, so Tony joined him. It had been absolutely beautiful and an homage to the struggles they'd been through. Peter'd lost his family, tried to make it on his own, and eventually found a support system, a family that could lift him when he stumbled.
"Stark Tower? You've got connections."
"Hello, Beck." Wade said, sitting on the roof of a car. He waved a hand. "Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?" He couldn't even force a smile under his mask. It had been a week. A week too long. Wade had barely been able to rest. He'd seen Maggie a couple times. The last time he'd seen her, she was up and walking, still a little dazed and dizzy, her speech a bit off. But she wasn't on machines anymore, she had painkillers, but not much else.
"Peter!"
Though, gotta say, these two chapter titles were fun.
Vanessa and Wade slowly crossed the room, looking almost frightened to look at Maggie.
"You two make me tired." Tony huffed before downing a gulp.
"Well, there's the option of prosthetics. I know a guy who started making them. Might work out."
"Young lady paid for you three minutes before you walked in." Delmar pointed to the doorway.
Cho nodded, then walked over to Peter. "Hey, my favorite patient. Your dad is on the good stuff. We're going to start working. Just wanted to let you know he's going to be absolutely fine, okay? So you can relax and worry about healing for yourself, okay?"
"I don't think I've had it."
Peter ignored her hand and wiped his face, pushing himself up. He danced well, but not perfect, pure ballet. Meanwhile, Maggie started her own dance, more pristine, perfect in form. She kept reaching out for Peter, but Peter kept dancing away from her.
"He was an adult. You are a teenager and you have to do more than just study the mystic arts, so no. Just no." Vanessa cupped her cheek. "Do you have Hunter?"
"I agree with her." Peter nodded. "I don't want to be scarred for life."
"They do?" Steve asked.
"Yup."
Steve went silent and so did the room. Until Strange slid his seat closer to Maggie and opened a book. Quietly, he started to read. "'Chapter ten. Halloween.'"
"Psh, Tony offered me twelve, one is chump change. Call me when you have a better offer." She winked. "Now go, you've got this."
"Takes one to know one." Strange responded dryly with no hint of offense. "Shall I let her in?"
"He w-was here. He was in the room. He came back for me."
Maggie took a shaky breath, still unsure of why she felt so warm or tingly. But she managed three pivots with no shaking. She actually made the forth one work. She stumbled on the fifth.
"Fucking left arm...every time." Tony huffed.
"Well, we're going to have to put you under. There will be some implants. We can use artificial nerves to connect you to the prosthesis. Once we have those in, along with some caps...you'll be able to put on whatever set feels best for you, from what you and your dad make." Dr. Cho nodded. "I've been with a few people who've gotten your dad's prosthetics. They say it feels as close to the real thing as they know. But it's all your choice."
"We'll use sound dampening."
It was the first official day of summer for Maggie. She was ready for it, early. She opened her door and caught herself in the mirror. Had she worn this outfit before? She couldn't remember. Something...something gave her a vague sense of danger, but she couldn't pinpoint it. "Oh, shit." She turned and went back to her room, putting on the necklace that had just...appeared one day. She really liked it. But she didn't like wearing it in the shower. She hid it under her shirt, the cool weight was comforting somehow, especially today. She didn't know why. She stepped back out and hopped down the hall while putting on her shoes.
"Hello, Peter. Captain Rogers has requested that you go straight home today."
This time, Strange rolled his eyes. "Get to class. And don't be late this Saturday."
Tony kissed his forehead. "It wasn't you...just a weird coincidence..." Tony frowned. He'd read up on Maggie back when Peter'd first said he was fighting crime with her. He didn't want Peter hanging around an unknown entity. Margaret Wilson was not her birth name. In fact, she was Magnolia Chase and still considered a missing person in a cold case. Tony wouldn't bring it up. The little girl had gone through hell as a child, but she'd made it, and though the family who'd taken her in was...questionable...Tony deemed her safe company for Peter. "She's a survivor. I'm sure she doesn't hold anything against you, just because you've got blond hair." Tony sighed. "So, how was the A-team?"
Maggie sighed in relief as he walked away. He didn't act like it, of course, but she felt like an intruder. It wasn't a comfortable feeling. She got up and cleaned the dishes before she headed upstairs. If she were allowed to fly, she would. Walking the stairs took far too long for her liking. She'd always been athletic, it was hard to NOT be mobile.
