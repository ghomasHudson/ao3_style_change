One hand braced and holding the baby, Steve leaned forward a little and brushed his lips against the back of her head as he reached out his other hand and pressed the cutter into the dough, and Olivia made a 'baa!' sound and slapped her hands on the countertop, presumably in an attempt to get at the dough.
Now, and speaking of those barnacles, why the hell weren't they making themselves at home in his penthouse like they did every other hour of the day? Oh, right. Because it was going for eight o'clock on a Friday night, and they all had lives.
Tony folded his arms, nestling them just beneath his breasts. "I don't know what you're talking about. I'm average."
Barton looked up from where he was dumping a spoonful of sugar into coffee. "Little warm for sweatpants, isn't it, Cap?"
"I know you're joking, but I'm starting to think there might be something to that. OK, I love you, man, but you're starting to cut off my circulation. I know you're used to hugging a really-built super soldier, but not all of us are forged from steel."
Steve shook his head once more. "I don't care. No showers. No parties. Not until afterward. Not until we know everything's OK for
Barton shrugged. "He'll live." He nodded at the powerless Iron Man suit. "What are we supposed to do with that?"
When Barton showed his face in the penthouse later that afternoon — the first time he'd been up there since the great living room re-arrange — he took one look around the place then turned to Tony and said, "You've got it
He stared at it a moment more before he went back to the one taken at Rockefeller Center, and strangely or perhaps sadly enough, he must have been getting old because the only thing he could think when he looked at this photograph of these two attractive young women with their long legs and mini dresses was, "
He thought for certain Steve was going to deflect, but instead, he said, "It's just hard, you know? After all these years. To—"
"I don't know," Wilson said with a sigh. "I guess I just thought they would have grown out of it by now."
"Yeah, my stomach's doing somersaults, but other than that, just hunky dory," he said, and they arrived at the penthouse not a moment too soon. He ran up the stairs and into the bedroom, and he made a mad dash for the bathroom and hit the toilet just as he threw up. He was coughing and gagging by the time he felt a presence behind him, and a large, familiar hand settled on his back and said, "Crackers?"
She put her hand on his forearm and gave it a gentle squeeze. "You knew what he was like when you started this."
ashamed at what he'd just said. However, Rhodey didn't help matters as he said, "To be fair, Tones, you are the one in the white dress."
But the guy just hummed, some disgustingly intrigued smile on his face, as he said, "Mmm...a fighter. I like your kind. Like the kind that makes me work for it."
He maybe hadn't thought about it at the time, but looking back, he was pretty sure his mother had had a suspicion that he didn't just like girls. He did like girls. He'd always liked girls. It was just... he liked fellas, too. But it was easier to hide that and tamp those feelings down because he liked girls and he was just as happy to go out on a date with a girl (however...little...that happened). But he was pretty sure his mother knew that he'd looked at fellas, too (he maybe had left a tablet of sketches out in the open one time, and he was pretty sure that she'd found it — and this was before art school, so he couldn't even play it off as that), and so he was pretty sure she wouldn't be entirely surprised by the fact that Steve had taken up with a fella. Maybe a little disappointed, but not surprised. He was sure she'd like Tony, though — sure she'd like that Tony was sweet and kind and had a good head on his shoulders. And more than that, he was sure she'd like that Tony didn't take any of his shit and gave back as good as Steve gave him.
Steve could only sigh, and against his better judgment, he did as Tony suggested, climbing up the stairs and making headway to the nursery where he'd last seen Olivia.
He felt like shit— Oh, not in the way that meant he was pregnant again. Fuck, no, not that way. But he felt… He felt…
He crunched on it then turned back to meet Steve's gaze, and Steve smiled a little and shook his head but didn't press the issue.
"I'll buy you another one," Tony said and pushed the maroon fabric away from Steve's broad shoulders. Steve was the type to wear an undershirt, and as he finished pulling the dress shirt away, Tony ran his hands underneath his white t-shirt and felt up to Steve's pectorals, grinning a little as he played with Steve's nipples and earned the quiet moan of want he'd been looking for.
Steve motioned back toward the living room. "You mean the ones in there watching that... weird...Christmas thing on TV?"
Tony sniffed in annoyance and went over toward the elevator, bypassing the scattered pile of drawings on the coffee table.
She just grinned at him, broadly, green eyes twinkling. "Oh, I think you already know the answer to that, Captain."
Pepper turned on him, and Tony winced at the anger and anguish he saw staring back at him. She was quiet a moment before she finally said, "I can't take it anymore."
"Yeah. Maybe even get my hair done. Makeup. More than the half-assed job I did last night. I'm really starting to feel like I've been given the opportunity of a lifetime here, and I've been squandering it. I admire the way women look when they get dressed up. Now I can see what actually goes into it."
"They're going to be all over us for this," Pepper murmured. "There's going to be an injunction now. No question."
"Fuck, I hate you," Tony breathed, but Steve could feel the tension emanating from him, and not the 'bad' kind of tension— well, it was 'bad' in the sense that it was liable to get a fella thrown out of the service for it.
and made a dash for the steps, but not before the elevator opened, and Pepper came storming off wearing a fitted cream-colored suit, those six-inch killer heels she was so fond of, and a face that read she was out for blood. She stopped dead in her tracks the moment she saw Tony, and Tony grimaced a little and said, "Oh, that's your angry face. I don't like your— Wait—"
"Remove the spell," he said in a voice that would have had almost anyone quaking in their boots. Anyone except screwy goddesses from other realms.
"Merry Christmas," Steve replied and didn't fight it as Jim scooped Olivia up off his lap and settled her into his arms.
"Good boy," he murmured and pet the 'bot on his support strut. "Go mix me up something good. Daddy's not feeling too good."
Doctor Ganford nodded her understanding then pointed to something on the screen, and Bruce moved the wand over in the direction she'd pointed.
familiar with that expression. Oh, but the Man of Iron wishes to be changed back, and contrary to popular belief — I think that's another one of your expressions — you are not the only pair of bondmates I have to deal with. Again, I am not your cosmic personal assistant, so—" she motioned at Tony, "—if you would be so kind as to dispose yourself of your infant, we can proceed."
"Uh, I don't know," Barnes said, "maybe by getting frozen and unfrozen a gazillion times over the last sixty years."
Steve stretched his back until it cracked, and he made to go over to the windows to gaze out at the city below when Tony reappeared from the kitchen, two glasses of something in his grasp. Steve frowned and turned and waited for Tony to make his way over to him, and as he did, he motioned to the glasses Tony held in his hand and said, "What's this?"
expected from life. For so, so long he'd just been winging it, floating along with the breeze and letting it take him where it may. He hadn't given much thought to his legacy or anything beyond the instant gratification that satiated him at the moment of experience but left him cold and empty once the initial euphoria had passed. He was relatively content to be, as he'd once described himself, a 'genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist' and not worry about anything beyond that.
"Is that a problem?" Steve asked and glanced up at him a moment. "Also, she is my child, and I am being useful," he added and set the tree cutter down and picked up a candy cane.
"I mean, I guess you don't have a choice," the voice from his past continued then went quiet as he took a sip. He hadn't turned around from the coffee machine yet, and Steve was
"The others were saying," he said, unsure of whether or not this was something he should even broach, "that you're having a hard time not seeing me as I am. That on some level you can't not see me as a woman that's carrying your child."
"It's possible no one else would ever find them?" Natasha said, more of a question than a statement.
He smiled and nodded his thanks to her then turned to Bruce and said, "Seriously, she could do wonders with you."
a regular feeding schedule, and Tony was still leaking all over the place and having to express the extra just to give himself some relief. The first time he'd tried to do it back when he'd thought he was only doing it for science, he'd ended up squirting himself in the face, and Steve had been there at the time — of course he had — and had almost burst an artery because he'd laughed so hard at it. He shut up real quick once Tony figured how to angle it to squirt at him, and, wiping the splatter of milk from his cheek, said with the utmost seriousness, "That is your daughter's only means of nourishment. You shouldn't be playing around with it like that."
"Yeah, well," he said, breezy and cool as he typed in the last code, "sometimes Steve doesn't know what he's talking about."
"Goodnight, honey," Steve said and leaned over him to kiss his cheek. Tony made a lazy kissing motion in his direction and then snuggled down, and the bed dipped and moved behind him some as Steve leaned back over onto his side and shut the light off then bedded down for the night.
Steve's eyes narrowed in suspicion at Tony's last comment. Just what did that mean? Was it a code of some kind? And he knew Hydra was pure evil, but to involve a child in whatever insane gag they'd cooked up for him? That was taking the ruse just a little too far.
"Papa?" Steve said as he turned his attention away from inspecting a beveled glass-paneled cabinet door. "You're 'Papa'?"
"Buck knew. About me. About…that fella. Told me it was stupid and dangerous and I was just going to get hurt or thrown in jail or worse. I…knew he was right." He shrugged. "I listened to him."
Steve sucked in a breath and pushed himself up to sit beside Tony, and he looked up at Natasha and said, "It's a just-in-case. The boy's name was easy. We knew what we wanted—"
Tony made a face and a hesitant, guttural sound, and Steve was pulled out of his memories for the second time that day as Tony scratched the back of his head and said, "Uh, yeah, I wanted to, ah… Look, you, uh, you didn't happen to see the news within the last twenty-four hours, did you?"
The guy just laughed, using his strength against Tony as he just pushed right back, holding him against the wall by his hips. "Not an exhibitionist, huh?"
Steve sat, seemingly contemplating this before he said, "Wasn't, uh— Wasn't that the, uh, name of the daughter — your daughter? The, ah, one from the future, I mean?"
acknowledgement of his existence beyond whatever the hell that bullshit was on the side of the road.
make the most sense for Tony to endure this. Because he did create, and he did bring things to life, and he'd already done so in the past. His 'bots, his suits, his AI were all kind of like metal and computerized children he'd given birth to…in a weird way.
JARVIS didn't say anything, and Steve directed Olivia's attention to the rain droplets splattered on the window for only a moment before he felt her tense up in his arms a little, and he looked down at her and said, "Really?"
He held up a red-toenailed food. "Look at me. Barefoot and pregnant," he said through his laughs. Pepper groaned and rolled her eyes, and he nudged her and said, "Oh, come on! You've got to find that a little funny!"
Barnes stared at him a moment, his mouth dropping open like he wanted to say something before he seemingly thought the better of it and shook his head, closing his mouth before voicing the thought.
Tony choked on his second bite of muesli. He coughed and coughed and thumped his chest a couple times then asked a strained, "
Because, of course, this wasn't just your standard class. No, he thought as he sat there on the floor, wondering how in the hell he was going to get back up again without embarrassing himself, this was bordering on New Age crap of a 'soothing' and 'comforting' environment with pillows and soft colors. Bruce had to have recommended this place to Diane or Donna or whatever the hell her name was because it was awash in hippy-drippy crap like soft lighting and flouncy cushions and emotions. The nurse — Tony supposed she was a nurse only because she said she was — wanted to run a welcoming and open atmosphere and after chirping that they were all first-time parents there, she suggested a stupid meet and greet so that all the happy couples could get to know each other better.
" he heard Steve ask as the doors began to close, panic lacing in his voice, and just as the doors slid closed, he watched as Steve turned around to look in his direction.
Tony thought about this a moment before he hummed a bit then said, "Look, it was always going to come to this, wasn't it? Even if we'd kept quiet about this whole thing, and I'd gone this whole…pregnancy…without anyone outside of the Avengers knowing about it, I don't think we'd be able to hide a kid for very long. We'd always
But Barton was intrigued, and he quirked his head some and said, "I have to pay taxes on something like that?"
He groaned and pressed the heel of his palm into his eye, stretching out beneath the covers as he willed himself to wake up. Contrary to popular belief, he wasn't that much of a morning person. More than Tony, maybe, but it wasn't that he enjoyed getting up so early. That was just the easiest time of day to get his run in. He thought that belief about him probably developed in the few months after he'd woken up — that horrible time in his life when he'd been miserable and unable to sleep and had, secretly, wished for some way to end it all.
But Tony reached out and patted Steve's hand. "It's OK, babe. You're a pathetic sap. We knew the secret would come out someday."
"You can never have enough toys for a kid," Bucky continued, and Sam nodded his serious-faced agreement before he seemed to think better of it and said, "Well, yeah, that's not true."
He looked down at his purple tank top and black yoga pants as Natasha dropped her hand from his mouth. "Why? What's wrong with this?"
Wanda and Viz, now that I think about it, too, but that…" He made a face and scratched at his jaw. "There's something they're not telling us, and I'm not sure I want to know what it is. Thor doesn't count. He says it's natural for soul mates to feel that way about each other, but he's a fucking alien."
"Yeah," he replied, quiet and with more meaning to it than Tony had the means to process at the moment.
He swallowed and nodded toward her shirt. "So, uh — just checking to make sure you're still OK — you want to show me who 'Daddy' is?"
"That's OK. We'll manage," he replied and then nudged his knee in between Tony's legs. "Spread your legs like a good girl, Antonia," he said.
Tony melted into him at that, sliding his arms around Steve's narrow waist as he fell into the embrace, Steve's tongue in his mouth and his growing interest in the situation pressing into his hip. He moaned a little, suddenly desperate once again to have this man inside of him — he wasn't sure that feeling would ever go away for him — and he broke the kiss and said a soft but choked, "
"So, the serum is an unknown quantity in this equation," the doctor said but didn't type anything down. "It could have no effect, or it could have a great deal of effect." She nodded her understanding then said, "I think that might be something you should ask Bruce to look into — for your own information as well as your own safety."
"Pepper and Nat think it would be a good idea for us to get out of town for a few days," Steve said as he went back to his dinner. "Until this blows over, anyway."
"There's a diner around here," Tony said, and the vision of earlier times dissipated, replaced by the here-and-now. "They stay open all night. Thought maybe you could use a cup of joe that doesn't taste too much like used motor oil."
Tony swallowed. He didn't want to say it, he didn't want to mean it, but it seemed there was no other alternative. Not now. Not anymore. Not after all this.
He woke up the next morning feeling like a million bucks (well, maybe billion, in his case), refreshed, rested, and alert. For the first time in what felt like forever, he didn't have that annoying wave of nausea that hit him as soon as he sat up, and he stretched out wide and yawned and slunk into the bathroom to take care of that morning's business.
Tony felt the dam breaking, and before he could help himself, he leaned forward and fell into Steve's arms, pressing his face into his shoulder and inhaling that safe, secure scent of soap and stubbornness that was Steve Rogers. Steve returned the embrace in kind, hugging fast to him, and turning his head to better be able to press a kiss to Tony's temple.
ther! This fellow they got for Tony sure deserved some sort of Academy Award for his performance. Steve had almost bought it several times over the course of his little speech. The only thing that had kept him from falling over the ledge was the sheer absurdity of the whole thing. Waking up in 2015.
Tony frowned as he considered this, and he reached out and took hold of Steve by his chin and turned his face toward him.
He rolled his eyes. "Yeah, lady, maybe to you. But here on Earth, there's a lot to be said about identity and sex and gender."
Steve tapped his bottle at his forehead in salute then went back upstairs, and Tony sighed and turned to Barton.
Steve just closed his eyes and shook his head a little, but he opened them back up and said, "He didn't recognize Nat, did he?"
wallet, the one he'd been using even before this whole thing had started — and yanked out a bunch of cards.
"Yeah, well, they didn't have baby sex detectors back in his day. You kind of had to wait until they popped out before you knew what you were getting."
Steve let go of one thigh to shove his fingers into him, mouthing and licking around the clit as he curled his fingers and began to stroke and flex them, stretching him, and Tony arched his back and let out a desperate whimper, clutching hold of the sheets again as though they could ground him or help him or keep him from going mad with want.
"I don't know. Is it?" Steve asked, but the elevator door opened, and the next words out of Steve's mouth were to Sam.
They showered, and Steve was very good about washing all the muck off of Tony, running the cloth over his body and murmuring about how well he'd done and how good he was, and Tony just leaned into his touch and let him, loving the feel of his fingers as he massaged the shampoo into his scalp.
"Er, yeah, I think I'll go with June Cleaver over there instead of the creepy cafeteria guy from that show — you remember that kids' show that was on, like, thirty years ago?" he asked to blank and tired stares. "What? On Nickelodeon. I used to watch it at my friend's house." At their continued blank and tired silence, Wilson put his hands up and sat back and said, "OK, you people were totally deprived of a lot is all I'm saying."
He nodded once more, smiling in resigned teary gratitude, and she gave him another hug and said, "Just worry about having this baby. We'll worry about everything else, OK?"
"You can't. You're worse than Bucky when you go on one of your tirades. You're what we like to call a 'hypocrite.'"
"Like I said, it's really not that bad. It doesn't hurt — at least not aside from the general tenderness and malaise that, from what I understand, is part and parcel of this whole thing — and Steve hasn't run off on me yet, so that's another tick in the plus column. I mean it… It could be worse, is what I'm saying."
"What? She is. That's a good trait to have especially with the lunatics running the asylum known as 'The Avengers.' Plus, it would make Wilson happy, though, depending on how you view their pissing match, it would also add another layer of torment to that weird thing he and Barnes have going on between them, and honestly, would not put it past those four to have some Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice thing going on between them. Which, actually, could be kind of hot or uncomfortable depending on how they go about it."
He went to reach for the coffee carafe again only to have it moved out of his reach by Bruce. He glared at him, though Bruce just shrugged and went back to his half-a-slice of grapefruit — seriously
"That'll never happen," Barton said as he pushed in between where Natasha and Bruce stood. Thor brought up the rear and dropped the Iron Man suit with a loud thunk before he met up with the rest of them. "See?" Barton crowed. "Told you he wasn't dead."
Bruce continued to shuffle about his station, but he said, "Didn't I hear you and Steve were discussing names?"
"Yeah? You know what Steve's going to show up wearing, right? A pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, and a backwards baseball cap like he's some frat-boy dude-bro. You know that, right?"
Steve pulled up to the designated area then put the car into 'park.' He glanced over to Tony and said, "You ready?"
"Uh," Bruce said and scratched at the back of his head, and if Tony didn't know better, he'd think there was something a little nervous or fishy about the way Bruce was suddenly holding himself. "Dunno. Few days, I think? Few weeks? I wasn't here when they left. I got the news from you, so…"
"When everybody gets here," Tony grumbled and padded through the living room. "That had better be freshly-brewed coffee that I'm smelling!" he called back in Steve and Thor's general direction, but Steve knew the words had been intended solely for him.
Steve motioned over the seating area and said, "Look, it's kind of busy. Why don't you go find us some seats?"
, but it still… There was a certain sting about it that would never go away. He usually tried not to think about his mother if only because that pain would always be much rawer. He'd actually loved his mother.
He broke his gaze with Steve, and Tony watched as he looked over to Natasha, who stared right back at him, something like pain and understanding coming over her face before she was able to school it away in a sort of blasé calm again.
Ella's confusion remained a moment more before it seemingly abated as she shook her head to clear her mind of the weirdness, and her face lit up as she came into her element. "
Steve laughed but said, "Oh? You don't look like you partake in anything but blended grass smoothies."
Without a word, the lights went down, the gleam from the city casting dark shadows over the broad, open space of the living area, and after Tony's eyes had adjusted to the darkness, he sat there and watched some other Tony Stark's daughter slumber contentedly and wondered if that Tony Stark knew how lucky a son-of-a-bitch he really was.
He stabbed another bite of pancakes and shoved them in his mouth, and Steve was quiet a moment as he scanned through whatever was on his tablet and said, "I was serious before."
It wasn't lost on him that, gifted with this appearance, he bore a superficial similarity to Steve's first love. And, as the saying went, you never forget your first. But the height, the coloring, the build, the attitude — he was a poor man's Peggy Carter. Of course Steve would be attracted to him this way. Of course Steve would like him this way. Of course Steve would probably want him to stay this way.
Barnes looked up at him, and Tony winced at the haunted horror he saw staring back at him. "I killed him."
show, Tony supposed, but not as nice as he might have liked (or been able to pay for himself) — and Natasha insisted she and the others could clean up if he and Steve wanted to retire for the night. Steve tried to be noble about it and stay behind to clean up, but Tony just shoved at his chest to push him over toward the elevator and said, "Steven, they are volunteering to clean up. Let them earn their keep."
He swallowed, taking in the surrounding sight of Tony's gift to him — a gift he didn't think he could ever top — and he opened and closed his mouth a few times before he said a quiet, "Tony, I can't... I can't accept this."
"I really don't think I'm the reason—" he started to say when Natasha cut in and said, "Oh, yeah, Stark's coming."
a day or two before they decided to tear apart the very fabric of the country for their own stupid aims and gains. Goddamn it, he hated them. He hated them so much, and when all this was over, he was going to root them all out and make them pay for this — make them pay for taking Steve away from him when he needed him the most.
Again, the gathered crowd went silent, and after a few moments of uncomfortable tension, the man that was either a friend or hired as a photographer for the event held his camera up some.
Natasha looked between Bruce and Tony and the 'jet, and though it seemed she was talking to Bruce, Tony knew she was directing the question to him.
"What? No. I just… Not that it's any of your business, but I just…have to empty my bladder, all right?"
There was no question about it. It hadn't been a dream — it had been a...oh, who knew what it was. Some sort of weird time displacement thing. He supposed he'd find out in due time. Until then, the most he could definitively say was that it hadn't been a dream and he had seen his future and interacted with his future and met his husband and his daughter years before, well, either one of them had even been born. Sort of. From his perspective, anyway.
"Completely different," Tony replied. "Alternate universe. This Cap is so fucking straight you could set your watch to him."
. But I just want… I just want to try this. Once. If you don't like it, we stop immediately. I tell you 'good girl,' and you can't handle that, we stop. I'm not going to force you to do anything you don't want. But I want… I want you to be my Antonia. I want you to
Steve just shot him a pitiful and abashed look, but Tony turned to the assembled crowd and said from out of nowhere, "Hey, what name do you think 'Maddie' is short for?"
The guy just grinned and stood up, taking hold of Tony's hand to lead the way down the steps and toward the dance floor. Tony grit his teeth and tried to walk without stumbling too much, and he made it down the steps and to the hot, sweaty floor without making too much of an idiot out of himself.
Steve just held his gaze a moment longer before he nodded like he understood what Tony was saying and went back to cleaning up the mess the others had left behind.
And suddenly, Tony seemed to understand what Steve was suggesting, a broad, knowing smile spreading over his lips.
"Well," she said, dabbing a cotton ball with some nail polish remover before she went about cleaning up the side of Tony's toe, "they have to set, and then I thought I'd give him a manicure, too."
Steve had just shrugged and said, "Whatever baby wants, baby gets," as he handed over a credit card with a false name on it.
Barton just sighed and rolled his eyes and said, "I need a vacation. After this, I'm getting out of here for a bit, OK? Tell your husband, if he's still talking to you after this."
"You could have worn a tux, I suppose," Natasha said, and Tony quietly shushed the voice in his head that trilled at wearing a dress. Instead, he went for bland and bored.
"I mean, not how I imagined you'd look on your wedding day, but still fucking good." Tony smiled in appreciation, and Rhodey added, "My baby boy's all grown up."
found out about this! We didn't know this was her intention back when she turned me back the first time!"
"They just got married. Give it six months. They honeymoon'll be over by then. Marriage kills the romance for
He stared at the ring, moving his hand to get the diamonds and sapphires to catch the light, and wondered why it bothered him so much that Steve was so seemingly disinterested in him all of a sudden. Look, he couldn't entirely blame the guy. Barnes had been his best friend. After his mother had died, Barnes and his family had been all Steve had had until he'd joined the army — until he'd set his sights on Peggy Carter. He couldn't blame the guy for wanting to get some of that back, some of that life that had been taken away from him.
"Tony, come on," Bruce said with a sigh. "It's not going to hurt. At most, it'll be uncomfortable. Like last time, remember?"
Tony shrugged, and Pepper said, "I'm sorry Steve. You pay your dues, you get to attend. God knows what he'd print if we kept him off the guest list."
Steve frowned at him and raised his hands a little like he was making a move to do as much. "Uh, OK." He stopped cold and added. "Where?"
"Just keep in mind," Esmeralda said, sounding bored and like she was short on time, "this is the last time I'll see you for quite a while." She smiled a little and added, "Though, if I leave you like this, I suppose I won't have to come back for even longer, now will I?"
"You're not a giant ass," Cap said with a shake of his head and a firm tone in his voice. "You're a bit of an ass, but you're not a giant one," he added with just a hint of a smile.
Tony sat up some again and focused in on the monitor. He squinted his eyes and tilted his head, but it was Barton that said, "Holy fuck," like he recognized what was on the screen.
Hill merely shrugged and picked up her drink. "I'm not," she said blandly and took a sip, and Tony couldn't tell if that implied that she already knew she found the image of two women fondling each other enticing or it hadn't done a thing for her.
"Not filling it out for you," Steve said with a shake of his head. And, to further drive home his point, he just turned the page on his magazine.
Barnes's face went a little soft at that, and Tony would go so far as to say it looked like the son-of-a-bitch was smiling.
He didn't give Tony a chance to respond to that in any way, instead wrapping the soft, silky cloth over his eyes and tying it at the back.
"Yeah, but it…" she said then trailed off, evidently as she tried to figure out just exactly how Tab A fit into Slot B.
He sat back in his seat as the driver pulled into traffic, and he smirked in pride at Tony, who pulled his oversized sunglasses off only to show Steve how hard he was rolling his eyes at him. Yeah, nice tough-guy act, you overgrown boy scout. Though he guess he should count himself lucky. Steve could have offered to
Bruce made a face and scratched the back of his neck. "I would rather you stay down here. There's at least some equipment here I can use if I need to. Besides it— It's messy, Tony. I mean it can be really, really messy. I don't think you want
Every single rational thought flew out of Steve's head at that, and suddenly, his hands were on Tony — feeling, grasping, touching — his mouth nipping and sucking and licking and kissing and tasting every bit that he could get. Tony, with his suddenly more delicate but no less firm hands, matched him touch-for-touch and nip-for-nip, and Steve ran his hands down Tony's body — his shoulders then his breasts (soft and full and weighty, fitting perfectly within his grip) then his abdomen and finally his ass. He kneaded his fingers into the soft, rounded flesh, his mouth now sucking a mark at the pulse point of Tony's neck, his body seeming to act on instinct as he thrust into Tony, the difference in their heights meaning his cock was shoving into Tony's lower abdomen.
thought was the proper way to do something, and Natasha stood at Tony's elbow and said, "She's a charming one, isn't she?"
Steve looked between Sam and Bucky, and he stuttered out a few confused non-replies before he all but sputtered, "
He shook his head. "Nope, you brought this one on yourself. You said you'd go if I went with you, and I agreed to go with you, so—"
your property. I am not someone you own. I have had my body fucked with against my will. I've been forced into being a fucking human
— convincing Tony of the earnestness of his words — was more important than keeping secrets from Hydra.
Natasha scowled a bit like she was more annoyed at their intrusion than Tony was, and she looked up at them and said a somewhat annoyed, "
This newest pain was sharper than the previous ones had been, and he slapped a hand against the wall and dug his nails into the sand-colored tile that surrounded him. He closed his eyes and squeezed them tight, and he gritted his teeth yet again and tried to imagine his happy place. Tried to imagine his lab. Working. Steve sitting on the couch. Sketching. Humoring DUM-E by tossing balled-up pieces of paper and having him 'fetch' them. Light banter back and forth. Steve smiling at him, that soft one he gave to him, the one Tony had never seen him give to anyone else. No, that one was his. That one was special for him. Steve getting up from the couch, leaving the sketchpad on the table, striding over to him, a tight pair of jeans and an even tighter t-shirt. Gray— no, blue— no, maybe gray. Maybe red? Coming up behind him. Putting his arms around his waist. Nuzzling his neck. Letting his hand slide down to Tony's groin, pressing the heel of his palm in, rubbing it against his half-hard shaft. Tony moaning in pleas—
Steve Rogers — Captain America — was Olivia's 'Daddy.' He was 'Papa,' and Cap — Steve — was 'Daddy.'
He held his breath, waiting for Tony to say something about it, and Tony, clearly sensing Steve standing behind him, said, "You know, that wasn't the first time I'd thought about you."
Tony considered him a moment, peering at him, before he shrugged and seemed to decide if wasn't worth the effort.
." Natasha rolled her eyes, but there was a hint of a smile on her lips as she watched the antics, and Barton grinned and propped his elbow up on the table to rest his chin in his palm.
thinking about then or ever), and then made Barnes and Wilson help him light the candles and then the sparklers so they would all burn relatively evenly before going out or being blown out.
of ways, forcing him to take this pleasure that was nothing short of mind-blowing. God, he didn't think a tongue could feel so good!
He opened his eyes, and in his peripheral vision, he could see Tony frown in concern at him. "Babe? Honey? What's wrong? OK, maybe not the video I should have shown you, but—"
Steve let out a heavy breath. "Anthony Edward," he said, not even attempting to hide the disappointment in his voice.
"Mmm… I could buy them a presidential election. Just don't know who would run as president and who would run as vice pres."
The kitchen door opened and slammed into the back of Steve's chair, and after jolting at the hit, Steve squeezed his eyes shut and plastered a tight smile over his face then took a deep breath and opened his eyes again, taking in the sight of Tony sitting across from him.
Saying 'focused' was better than saying he was prone to being a single-minded pain-in-the-ass, right?
She huffed out a breath and said, "OK," almost like she was consigning herself to her fate. Bruce just laughed a little and shook his head, and Rhodey snorted a laugh and said, "She's going to be a handful in a few years."
"Guess I just couldn't sleep," Cap finally said. "I'll let you get back to your, uh, television, I guess."
Tony shrugged and twisted back and forth on his chair somewhat. "No, don't worry about it. I mean, hell, if I were in your shoes, I'd find the whole thing disgusting, too."
Tony sat back a little, and he put a finger beneath Steve's chin to tip his head up so he could look him in the eye.
"I know," Tony said, "but you know the media, Steve. You've dealt with them. You know what vultures they are. And you know what the public is like. Wouldn't you rather it be something under our control rather than something that's taken from us against our will?"
"No," Steve countered, setting down the green shaker to pick up the red one. "Just asking a question."
"—lithe, neurotic brunettes with the absolutely most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. I used to sketch them. Who am I kidding? I still do. But even before we got together I used to sketch them, tried to get the contours right and the lashes right."
God, it was so confusing. It was so fucking confusing. Maybe if this had been an abomination of an experience. Maybe if it had been the worst thing imaginable. Maybe if it had been nothing but misery he could have said without pause that he couldn't wait to get back to his male body and never wanted to look back.
"That's terrible," he said, unable to stop the angry furrowing of his brow. "I'm not some wide-eyed farm boy that's too naïve to not get himself taken advantage of by some city slicker. I was like this long before I ever met you. It's just… It's not something you went around broadcasting. Not if you didn't want to end up beaten or jailed or…dead."
"Livestock. Produce. Generally just the things we eat. I mean unless, of course, it's a Christmas tree farm. You can't
the one that left the note with the receipt shaming them for putting a table next to the kitchen doors?"
"Yeah, and we had a fucking downpour. Clearly that means we're in for a lifetime of bliss," Tony said and turned back to the mirror to look at his profile again. He stood a little straighter, trying to see if that made a difference and made the swell either more or less noticeable, and he considered what that swell was, what that swell meant, what was growing beneath that swell, and said, "You know they used to call me the Merchant of Death."
Steve muttered in a quiet exhale, but Thor just said, "It matters most gravely. She does not expend her powers needlessly. I fear there is more to this than meets the eye."
have a baby!" Steve reiterated. "I don't know how it is on Asgard, but here on Earth, Tony — a human male —
This fetus didn't just have the potential to be a child with his eyes and Steve's never-say-die attitude. This fetus could very much be a weapon. Wasn't Steve, when it came down to it, a weapon? One with autonomy and free will, maybe, but still a weapon. He was designed as a weapon. A super soldier, the pinnacle of human perfection, a man with one job and one mission in life: to soldier, to kill. It was a miracle no one had yet nabbed him and tried to stud him for a little legion of super soldiers, ones with Steve's strength but none of his will. That could be programmed out of them.
"No," Bucky said and grumbled as he slapped Sam's twenty bucks into his waiting palm. "But you're a fucking idiot. He said go out with him. You said you had to work. He asked what time you get off."
"Yeah, great, you look gorgeous, Tony," Pepper said, striding out of the bedroom in her crisp, tailored ensemble, a chic-but-casual Natasha following right behind. She marched right over to Tony and took hold of his arm and said, "Come on. We should have been down there fifteen minutes ago."
She slept through the night now in her own room, which meant Steve didn't have to get up in the middle of the night to calm her down anymore, and there was a tiny part of him that missed that — that missed that time they had together when the sky was dark and the building was asleep and it was just the two of them in the living room, JARVIS playing quiet music as he tried to rock his fussy little baby girl back to sleep. He didn't miss the crying and the fussing at two o'clock in the morning — Tony, even after turning back to his original form, had still been so tired that he slept right through it — but he did miss the swaying and the music, did miss that time they spent together. Through the hushes and the shushing, he would tell her stories about himself when he was younger — things he'd done or things he'd wanted to do but was unable because he was confined to a bed, scrapes he and Bucky had gotten into, his mother—
Tony just smiled and nodded a little, appreciating the gesture. Even after all this time since New York, it was weird having people worried about him and concerned for him — people that weren't named James Rhodes or Pepper Potts. All the same, it was also kind of nice.
He motioned for Rhodey to follow him over to the elevator, and they went down to the workshop, Tony taking a seat at his workstation while Rhodey sat down in the free chair on the other side of it.
Tony snorted a laugh. "Sure, honey," he said and reached up to pat Steve's cheek. "Of course they do."
"If I was more of an ass than I am, I would purposely mishear that as, 'Sex for Tony Stark?' and the answer would be, 'Yes, please.'
"On it!" he said and set the cover over the box then struggled a bit to his feet, Thor eventually helping him, before he took off for his lab. That was probably the safest hiding place for this, right?
He shut down his progress on...whatever it was he was working on...then changed into something appropriate for going out for coffee — OK, it was just a band shirt and yoga pants — and he climbed into the waiting car with Pepper then panicked when he realized that this was probably someone that wouldn't—
He met Bruce's gaze, staring at him, glaring at him, almost daring him to continue his train of thought.
"Well," Tony said with a shrug. "Rome wasn't built in a day. Now—" he turned to his band of hungry little avengers, "—who wants what?"
"Well, there's no time to lose!" he said and walked at such a brisk pace that Tony struggled to keep up.
Steve gave a slight nod, a little smile on his face. "Seriously. This counts toward your twelve ounces, though."
"This is scary. I get that. I'm not going to let you get hurt. We're going to figure it out. Whatever happens, we're going to figure it out, and it's going to be OK."
"Steve in particular," she said, almost marveling at the very idea of it. "I can't understand why. I mean, usually
Natasha shook her head some, not letting up at all on the soothing strokes over his back. "No, I don't think he's mad at all. I think he feels absolutely terrible, and I know he's up there now blaming himself for everything that you're going through—"
"Of course," Steve replied and brushed his lips over his temple just as the car arrived at the penthouse, announcing its arrival with a 'ding.' The door slid open, and Steve took Tony's hand to lead him off, and he made to go over to the couch, but Tony tugged on his hand and said, "Come here."
"No there's not. I heard about how much you whined when we got married and they wouldn't let us see each other until the ceremony."
"He's right," Hill said, still standing at Steve's elbow. "As far as they know, Tony Stark disappeared several months ago and Steve Rogers has been seen around town —
So, Steve just stood there, hands still tucked into his armpits, staring at the floor, and said, "I think we're definitely gonna have to tell them the truth now. And soon — sooner than I might have liked."
He hadn't wanted to say anything, but he'd noticed some odd changes as of late. His face had softened just the slightest, and he was pretty sure his beard wasn't growing in as regularly as it once had. There was a tenderness to his pectorals, something he'd thought had been nothing more than dead nerves finally coming back online after his reactor surgery. His pants were slightly tighter, almost like his hips had spread just the slightest amount. It was all stuff that, separate, he wouldn't have given much thought to. But together? Oh, god, together…
He rolled his eyes and pushed his way into her pad. "No, I mean—" Bagel still in hand, he motioned over himself. "With this."
"Punching you in the junk?" he muttered as he rubbed his shin, but clearly he wasn't loud enough because the guy just said, "Give me five minutes on the floor. I'll rock your world."
The nurse pointed to the hard vinyl exam table, the vinyl done up in a powder lavender-y type of color, and said, "OK, if you can take off all your clothes and set them on that chair there. Then put that smock over you. The top leave open in the front. The bottom put over your lap. The doctor will be in to see you shortly."
Steve looked at Tony for explanation as to what that meant, but Tony shrugged, not understanding what it meant himself.
He trailed off and shook his head but he continued to laugh to himself. Tony watched him a moment before he scowled a little and closed up the access panel to the arm.
, and yet he was standing there with a goddamned shiny party hat and a fucking noisemaker hanging out of his mouth.
"Thanks," he replied and kissed Steve's cheek in return. And then, when Steve had pulled away, he added, "I mean, you'd… You'd be OK with me staying like this the rest of my life, right? I mean, you'd be OK with me
(Having once had the life kissed out of him by an alternate universe Cap also didn't exactly hurt matters, either.)
"But they don't know that, Tony! They don't know it's you. They only know that Tony Stark hasn't been seen
," Steve muttered from behind him, a slight tinge of horror lacing his voice. Tony thought the verbiage fit, but the sentiment was completely off. Steve, clearly, was slightly nervous about what Tony might say. Tony, on the other hand, couldn't believe he was wasting a weekend here when he could have been doing something
Tony turned to Steve, who turned to him, and Steve smiled at him and leaned down a little to nose at Tony's face, brushing the tip of his nose against the fine hairs of Tony's van dyke. He hummed a little and said, "Nice to have you back."
"He loves you," Barnes said simply. "Went crazy when you wouldn't take his calls the other day. Thought he was gonna tear his hair out. Wouldn't stop talking about you the entire time. Had to talk him down from stealing a car and chasing after you."
, and she fucking tried to take his hand for some fucking stupid reason. He was able to wrench his arm away in time, leveling her with the most murderous glare he could muster, and she frowned, her brows drawing together in hurt as she shrunk into herself a little.
Tony blinked his eyes open and heaved out a sigh. "Yeah," he said and rubbed his cheek on Steve's shoulder. "Not sure I'm ready to think about
"Maria," he replied, his voice thicker with emotion than he'd intended, and Cap nodded his understanding. "My mother was—"
the day he shipped me off to boarding school. My daughter is never going to wonder for one second if I love her or care about her. She is going to know her father is there for her. Always."
Steve and Tony exchanged looks again, and Tony once more just shrugged at Steve's confusion before Steve turned back to him and again asked, "What do you want?"
Tony slapped his hands on the arms of the chair. "OK, whelp, that makes me feel better. Glad we had this consult. So, uh, six more months until the next visit, right? Right. OK, thanks again. Nice to meet you—"
: There is a part of a scene in this chapter that some may consider to be transphobic. It is not intended to be. At most, it is intended to be read as Tony using some creep's transphobia to put him in his place. But please be aware that some may consider it transphobic. Also, there is also some derogatory language and a hefty amount of sexual harassment. If any of that makes you uneasy, you may want to skip this chapter.
don't think we're meeting again. Sorry. I'm sure you're tons of fun at parties, but, yeah, got a life to live here."
Steve, who should have been there more than any of them. Who was the only one he really wanted there. Goddamn him and his selfless 'the world needs him more than I do' bullshit. He should have yanked Steve off that fucking 'jet himself and handcuffed the son-of-a-bitch to his wrist.
He did exactly as he'd explained to thin air, setting the dishes to wash and dry, and he turned back to the baby that had awoken and was blinking sleepily at him.
No, this is an outrage. I put in a communal floor for you people, and no one uses it. The only time it gets used is when we have parties, and we haven't had one of those since New Year's."
"No," Steve said, a slightly deprecating tone to his voice. "No, it just… It scares me that I could lose this the same as I lost all that. I could close my eyes again and find my entire life gone once more. But I wouldn't lose a 'what might be.' I would lose a 'what was and what could never be again.'"
"They mean well," Steve murmured in reply and stroked his thumbs against Tony's cheekbones. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow?"
"I don't know," the woman said. "Is he?" She leaned back in her chair. "I read about Captain America in high school. It was a big part of his story that he went from draft board to draft board trying to enlist,
Tony followed after the half-track and waited for Steve to make some sort of comment about saving the jokes for later, but nothing came, and Tony called out in a slight panic, "Who's closest to Steve?"
getting out of the shower, parading out of the bathroom with nothing but a towel around his waist and his hair wet and slicked back from his forehead.
He blinked and went to ask what her game was, but she just winked at him coyly enough that it would have gone over the other guy's head and said, annoyance lacing her voice, "I thought it was just about you and me tonight? Isn't that what you said back at the house?"
He sighed a little. "I…I've had to fight for everything I've ever gotten my whole life. Before I went into the army — well, really, I guess before I got that—"
"He's hankering for the good ol' days of the sixteenth century," Tony said, and Steve turned to him in a little confusion as he pocketed the picture again.
Tony hummed in thought then said, "Prevailing theory is it's rooted in that, but that's not what it means nowadays, no. And I
Bruce pressed down onto his abdomen with the wand, and yeah, it did feel a little funny, especially as he moved it around, his concentration — and confusion, if he was being honest — splayed over his face. He went about this for several minutes before he began to look from the screen down to Tony's abdomen and back to the screen again.
"I don't think any of them are working together," Steve said with a curt shake of his head. "This is about becoming high man on the totem pole. They'd step over their own mothers to get to the top."
OK, no, not the time to freak out. He kept his eyes open so that he could use his surroundings to ground him, and he took several short, panicked breaths as he tried to get control of himself. He couldn't close his eyes. If he did, he'd see it, and he couldn't— he didn't—
He swallowed and turned the deadbolt to lock the door so that he couldn't be disturbed, and he went over to the sink and made to splash cold water on his face to try and temper some of the desire, but he caught the ridiculous tenting of his pants, remembered
His heart raced so fast and beat so hard Steve thought it was about to burst right out of his chest, and he swallowed and took slow, measured steps to grab his chocolate bar and get the hell out of there without his companion noticing.
"I don't know," he said and scoffed a little. "The grocery store, I think. It was right before I came back here."
. If that wasn't a good enough reason to be in pajamas at seven-thirty on a Friday night in May then what was?
"Well," he finally said, blinking several times as his eyebrows raised in unison, "I might have— It would have been nice to have that information sooner. Do we know
Steve gave him a funny look like he wasn't sure how to take Tony's comment, and Tony smiled a little and shrugged then turned to look out the window to watch the passing scenery and traffic of Midtown. It was only a moment before he felt another hand slide over his abdomen and give it a gentle rub, and then there were warm, soft lips pressing against the exposed flesh at the crook of his neck.
"No, something's wrong. What's wrong? You never pass up a chance to argue with me, and I just said something you would ordinarily consider a bald-faced lie."
read the splash at the top, and below that was a stunning recent picture of the billionaire, who looked fit, and trim, and tanned, decked out in a black suit and burgundy dress shirt that had probably cost the equivalent of a month's salary for Steve — from
"Do you want to see?" Bruce then asked, and Tony realized DUM-E had helpfully retrieved a mirror from somewhere.
"Way to have your bases covered, J. And yeah, with that last one, not taking any chances on this one. Think of it like the palladium poisoning to the nth degree. We're at ten weeks now, which means we've got about twenty-six to thirty weeks to get through, and I want to make sure everything is as it should be just in case…"
"This is why I said you need to go to an actual medical doctor, Tony," he finally said, frustration rampant in his tone.
Bruce looked up from his motions and met Tony's gaze. "It's OK to actually enjoy the fact that you're having a baby. It's OK to be excited by the fact that you and Steve are going to be parents. It's OK to embrace this part of you. You don't have to keep up appearances for any of us."
"Papa had 'mesia, 'member?" she said, not letting him get his question out. She sat up with her knees on the seat of the chair and put her hands on her hips. "He didn't know who I was!" she said like it was an affront to humanity. To her, it probably had been. "He had to go out and be Iron Man, and he got hurt real bad. Daddy cried 'cuz it took Papa a long time to wake up, and when he did, he didn't know who we were. He knew Daddy was Capt'in 'merica, but he didn't know he was married to Daddy."
"Why is that always everyone's question?" Tony muttered as he turned back to the crowd. "Look, they both have their pluses and their minuses, all right? I don't— I can't say for absolute certain which one is better than the other because they both have their merits, OK? I mean, clearly, they're
Steve had been on his run when he'd seen everyone else, and so he'd gone down to his lab to play with the toys he was building for his new comrades and had gotten pretty lost and distracted in the whole endeavor, forgetting that he needed to remind Steve that he was going to have to put on the dancing monkey routine again. It was something that he'd confessed to Tony one night when it was just they two, a bottle of peach schnapps (don't judge; it was the only thing left in the bar), and a bonding session that had started out forced and had ended with them commiserating over their mutual experience of being thrust into a limelight that neither one really craved. Just because Tony was a natural at it didn't mean he loved it. He was just good at it because he'd been trained to be good at it from a young age. Steve had had a crash course in it during the war. It was something only they and they alone could understand. Barton and Romanoff were spies and, as such, were sheltered from it; Thor was a prince of some far away land, but Tony had the suspicion that his exposure to that limelight wasn't anything similar to what was seen on Earth; Bruce shied away from it. Only he and Steve had ever really known the limelight, the press, and the soul- crushing that went along with it.
Steve snorted a laugh — it wasn't true, but yeah, OK, maybe he could be as corny as that sometimes — and Tony finished shaking sugar crystals onto the cookies then slid the sheet into the oven to bake. After he'd closed the oven door and set the timer, Steve smiled more fully at him and said, "Come on. It's not that bad is it? Celebrating Christmas, I mean."
He shivered involuntarily, and he took a breath before Steve lined himself up and pushed into Tony's mouth, one hand firm at the back of Tony's head to hold him still. Tony moaned and gasped a little as he felt Steve plunder his mouth without mercy, felt the hot weight of Steve's cock on his tongue, and he relaxed his throat and allowed Steve to push in all the way until Tony's nose brushed against the coarse hairs at the base, Steve's scrotum hitting against his chin.
Tony Stark. There's a reason that he's like this that I can't get into, but do you honestly think Captain America is sitting here trying to con you into issuing a marriage license under false pretenses?"
Steve had looked up from his menu as soon as Tony had uttered the word 'asshole.' "Tony, stop," he said looking equal parts saddened and incensed. "That's not true."
"Anyway," she said lightly and breezily, "duty calls, and as I've told you time and again, you're not my only charges." But then her face softened into something exuding honesty, her eyes losing some of their harsh focus as she looked him over and tweaked a small, delicate smile at him.
He folded his arms tight across his chest and shrugged. "I don't know. Just…never thought it was in the cards for me, that's all. I mean, I
Bruce had intended to take her up to the common floor but for some reason, the words, "Tony's floor," came out of his mouth as soon as they got on the elevator, and JARVIS didn't even question his choice. The doors opened to the penthouse, still in the midst of being rebuilt after the trashing it had gotten during the Battle, and Olivia bounded off and ran into the living room, stopping only a moment to question it like the placement of things looked unfamiliar to her before she dashed off toward the kitchen. Bruce sighed and followed after her, and she was just climbing up onto one of the high chairs at the island when he got to the kitchen.
He shrugged and stood up to grab a tablet, casual, like he wasn't about to put his heart out on his sleeve for Steve to, quite possibly, stab, maim, and destroy.
He felt Barton, Bruce, and Steve all set their sights on him, and Natasha just looked at him in slight confusion and said, "Why?"
"Not sure," Hill said as she ended her call. "As far as we can tell, it's a blackout, but no one seems to be able to pinpoint where it started."
"Yeah, Dream-date Ken? It's not a child so much as a thing about this big—" Tony held his fingers a little over an inch apart, "—that is
Ella hummed in agreement and was about to say something more when the arrival of some other friends caught her attention, and she excused herself and left to greet them, promising she'd come back around in time. Tony and Bruce watched her leave before Bruce nudged him and motioned him over to another panel and said, "Come on. I want to go see if it's here."
But he was, to some degree, a selfish man. He couldn't have Tony the way he wanted him, so he would take him any way he got him: meetings, sparring sessions, equipment test-runs, uniform fittings. Sometimes, as of late, he would just sit down in the workshop or in the lab and sketch as Tony or Tony and Bruce worked their science magic (and Tony had taken umbrage when Steve had called it that, cursing the very existence of the word 'magic'). More often than not, he would sketch the scene playing out in front of him, Tony always as the focal point. Even those times that he worked with Bruce, Tony was the focal point and Bruce barely more than a blurry background image.
He looked to Steve, who shrugged and continued to page through the magazine as he said, "Tell 'em you forgot what it is."
"There's a catch on your left side between the seat and the console. Look for the thing with the red button."
," he amended with a roll of his eyes, "to me has never stopped you before. In fact, I think you've kind of used it to your advantage."
to say? He'd crashed a plane in the Arctic in 1945, convinced he was giving his life for the greater good, and now; here he was, in New York, in the year 2012 —
Steve pressed his face into the back of Tony's neck, and he hummed, his dick hardening by the moment, and said, "Could you go again?"
"What was that about?" Tony asked as the band went through the last few bars of the standard they'd been playing.
"Hmm?" he asked and pulled up a chair to sit in front of Steve and Olivia. "Her nails are getting a little long. I need to clip them before she hurts anyone with them."
"So, as I was saying," he said and adjusted himself on the hard mattress of the gurney, "When Steve comes back — because he's going to come back — he's going to be pissed at you guys for buying these things. He's afraid it's bad luck."
"OK," he said with a groan and sat up with her, settling her to the cushion next to him as the blanket fell away from them. "Can't sit on Papa's gut like that no matter how soft it is."
Barnes blew out a breath and shook his head. "Only you, Steve. Only you could simultaneously end up with someone both too old and too young for you. It's like something out of Ripley's."
He always felt like he was intruding on a private moment when he came upon that — no doubt he was — and so he would duck away quietly and either climb into bed or go poke his head in their daughter's room to make sure she was OK. When he met up with Tony later, he pretended to be none-the-wiser, and Tony never breathed a word of what he'd been doing, but Steve hated that he had to struggle with it — struggle alone with it. But he didn't want to overstep. They were married, and if some crazy space creature was right, they were soul mates whose lives had been intertwined for a very long time, but that didn't give him the right to force Tony to tell him what was bothering him. If Tony wanted to talk about it, he would — or he'd make those weird overtures where he didn't want to be the one to bring it up, but he would act so odd that Steve would have no choice but to ask him what was wrong. But he hadn't done anything like that yet, and if it really was bothering him the way Steve thought it was, he would bring it up when he was good and ready to discuss it.
Steve glanced down at his legs and saw how his pants were soaked through to just above his ankle. He hadn't noticed the cold before, but now that he thought about it— He felt a burst of hot air hit his legs, and he knew then that whatever Tony had done had been for his benefit. He could almost believe everything Tony had said and done this morning had been sincere.
She groaned and rolled her eyes once more. "My goodness," she muttered with a shake of her head before she looked pointedly at him. "Did you feel yourself age before you were turned into the peak of human perfection?"
Steve went to protest this, but Hill said, "Getting ahead of the story would put some of the power back in our hands. There's rampant speculation out there now. The more you do this, the more questions people are going to ask, and the worse they're going to make everything seem."
The doubter didn't look any more convinced than he had been previously, but that seemed to placate the rest of their audience. Tony honestly didn't care. He knew what the truth was, he knew he was telling the truth, and that was as much as was owed to anyone.
He glanced up, snuffling, and he caught Bruce and Rhodey giving each other wary looks, but Tony shook his head and said, "It's fine."
He pulled the cup from his lips and glared at it, smacking his lips as he tried to figure out why it was so…
He shook his head a little then turned and began the ascent, moving over to his bedroom once he'd hit the landing. He stepped in and carried Olivia over to the bassinette, and as he set her down, he murmured, "You know, one of these days, you're going to have to start sleeping in your own room."
in damn near seventy years, Steve! I know for you it's only been a couple of years — a couple of years you've spent with
"Mmm… That's right, you haven't. Well—" He lifted his hips and slid his sleep pants down. "First time for everything, Captain."
"I have not physically changed your form. I have merely allowed for you to age," she said breezily, like that made all the difference in the world.
Tony just nodded, swallowing, blinking as he tried to come back to himself from that short otherworldly trip he'd just taken, and he rolled to his side so that he was flush with Steve's sweat- slicked body and said, "Yeah, that... That's definitely happening again."
She gazed upon him, considering him. "Your kind desires nothing more than eternal youth and beauty, and here you are — a man in possession of such a blessing but desires nothing more than the chance to grow old with your bonded."
part of him knew to be embarrassed by that fact — before he said, "It might have gotten overlooked."
"OK, goodnight," Steve said and turned over to kiss his cheek then turned back and tried to get comfortable.
"Bucky is my friend. He was there for me… He was always there when I needed him. He was always there to pull me out of the fire. The one time he needed me to pull him out, I couldn't. I failed him. I couldn't watch out for him the way he'd watched out for me.
"OK, ow," was the first thing out of his mouth, and Natasha stopped her humming and turned to glance at him, continuing to bounce the baby ever-so-gently as she did so.
Tony ended up ordering the same thing Steve did, telling the waitress in all seriousness that he didn't want any of that health-food crap and throw some extra grease on before yelling this same demand to the short-order cook in the kitchen.
Steve stepped back, dropping his arms as he went to take a defensive stance, and he reached out a hand to try to put Tony behind him, but Bruce and Rhodey grabbed hold of Tony and pulled him away from Steve while Thor, without preamble, made for Steve, grabbing him and throwing him over his shoulder in such an easy and fluid motion it was like he'd done it a thousand times before.
The elevator stopped at the penthouse floor, and the doors slid open. "What are you talking about? I've got you, so right away, I've got a doctor and I've got drugs."
Steve sighed a little but pulled away from Tony, and he kept his attention on Natasha and said, "How much longer are you going to be?"
"You won't do a goddamned thing except piss and moan for six months," Barton said and grabbed another slice of bacon. "You're the textbook definition of 'all bark and no bite.'"
enough to catch the person, nor was the angle, so he settled for making his selection and pressed the buttons as he heard whoever it was pour himself a cup of coffee from the pot. Maybe it wasn't Bucky or Sam then? Wouldn't they have antagonized him by now?
"Uh, yeah, don't think either one of us is kosher with that," Tony said, but Bruce squeezed his eyes shut and took what looked to be a deep, calming breath — the kind where you counted to ten before you either bit someone's head off or, well,
She nodded at the baby. "But you don't deny that she's brought you even closer together — that your bond has grown and strengthened through her."
"Hey," he said in a soft voice and reached a hand out to Tony's arm. "You OK? You hurt? She didn't do anything else to you, did she?"
"You never used to be this sensitive about your appearance," she murmured, an odd smile on her face before she said, "
He turned and left before either Steve or Tony could say a word, and Steve turned to Tony and said, "I hope he doesn't think—"
Bruce shook his head a little more — evidently still disheartened by Tony's insistence that their team leader had not perished in battle — then said, "I want to keep you down here for a little while longer. It's easier for me to come check on you when you're down here rather than up in the penthouse."
"Wasn't it?" He led him over to the elevator, and Barton called out to him from the 'jet, "Hey, you want us to cart the armor off or you want to leave it here?"
He actually did have to pee, and so he relieved himself and washed up in the sink, and he stopped a moment to look at himself in the mirror — the blonde hair and the way his sunglasses were pushed back atop his head to create a slight cascading effect with the hair. Again, not unattractive as a blonde, but he was definitely more suited to being a brunette.
"No," he said earnestly. "Just saying." He glanced down to his right to see Olivia holding the receiver up to him. "Oh, my turn, huh?" He took the receiver from her and pretended to put it up to his ear. "Yes? What's that? Tony's grumpy act is all for show? He's actually got a gooey marshmallow center? Well, stop the presses! Looks like we've got a new headline to print."
"I swear to god, J," he muttered under his breath and took a few halting steps forward, tears continuing to sting his eyes from the miserable, radiating ache. "If you dropped me off here only to—"
Bruce shrugged. "It's one of two things: she's either from the future or she's from another dimension."
the meme, all right?" he said and pulled his phone from Tony's view and turned to show Hill, who took one glance at it and rolled her eyes in disgust. "I just found it. Don't shoot the messenger. Or don't take the messenger's job away from him, at least."
"Seriously?" he muttered as Steve went over to the dresser. Steve chuckled a little and glanced over to him.
Steve pulled one hand away from his chocolate and scratched at his forehead. "I mean, it's not— I don't know how—"
When the flash dimmed, and the dust settled, Tony saw standing in his living room a tall, elegant- looking woman with long, honey-kissed hair and emerald-green eyes. She was lank but firm, her gown pale gossamer and pooling on the floor at her feet. There was an air of regality and innocence about her, an earnest curve to her rouged-tinted lips that made Tony want to run for the hills because the last time he'd seen that look — that face — he'd, well, been turned into a woman.
Tony looked to see that Rhodey was right and Olivia had somehow gotten sticky maple syrup down the front of the shirt but he shrugged. "What can I say?" he said and took a sip of coffee.
"This — this thing. This baby. Is it just a baby? It's not something… It's not something more evil than that, right? Is there any way to tell? I'm not just an incubator for one of Hydra's more deranged plots, am I?"
He met her earnest and hopeful gaze from where she lay there on the bed, and he exhaled a slight breath through his nose and said, "How 'bout I stay with you until you fall asleep? Uncle Rhodey's still downstairs. I don't want to be rude to him."
He looked up just as Rhodey — evidently back from his hastily-arranged lunch with 'a friend' that was unquestionably a meet-up with Pepper — came into his line of sight, blocking the couch's view of the TV, and Olivia grumbled and bounced around, trying to see around him, before she finally said, "Unca Rhodey, tryin'a watch TV!"
The first few he flipped back through were of him and Olivia — sweet and innocent things like feeding or bath time or cuddling. There was one of Olivia sleeping in her bassinette and another of her resting in her highchair. He flipped back a few more pages and came face-to-face with himself as he'd looked in his later days of pregnancy — big breasts, big belly, and, well, in one picture a tub of gelato in one hand, a spoon in the other, and one hell of a scowl on his face. He flipped back a few more and realized he'd gone into the more 'R' bordering on 'X' rated drawings, Steve's imagination clearly having gone into overdrive from the lingerie Tony had sported around the time they'd gotten married. Tony saw himself in these pictures trussed up in tight lingerie and light bondage, pouty lips and bedroom eyes. Though these were nothing compared to the ones where he was completely naked, knees bent, one hand between his legs, the other fondling one of his breasts, and his head thrown back, dark hair flowing and ecstasy on his face, and— Fuck, was that a vulva? Wait, was that his— Was that what he'd looked like down there?
He was just starting to get into the teasing nips and grunts when Steve's phone began to ring, that obnoxious tune from that '60s 'Captain America' cartoon that he'd watched as a kid blaring into the previous silence of the room. Steve groaned into his neck but still pulled away to glance over to the table to check to see who or what it was.
Tony had wanted to kill him before the emotion of the moment took over, and he almost burst into tears. He'd thought then it was just that he was feeling ill. Looking back…oh, it was for another reason entirely.
He hummed but didn't say anything beyond that, and she tweaked a small smile at him and said, "Nothing I own will fit you. We'll have to go out and find something that works."
"We're not smart enough to sense it," Steve said, mouth flat as Tony reached into the cabinet for the bread. "Hey, don't you want any bacon?"
Bruce winced and pulled away from her, but Thor stepped forward and said, "Why should we not do that? Why should we not attempt to save the Man of Iron?"
"Shit!" he said and jumped up. "Don't move!" he said, putting his hands out as though to push Steve back into the chair he hadn't even attempted to vacate, and Steve watched as he went around the couch and made a mad dash out into the foyer and then up the stairs.
"Well," he said, blowing out a breath and dropping his hand, "I don't know. I thought it might be kind of nice for a change? Just for tonight if you don't like it. I mean, I didn't even take you on a honeymoon, and I know this doesn't exactly make up for that, but… I don't know. If you don't want to stay, we don't—"
He expected a laugh and something teasing. He expected a joke. What he didn't expect was a warm wetness to brush against his neck as Steve seemingly blinked away some tears — of happiness, of remorse, he couldn't say — and he took a deep breath and swallowed to keep his own emotions in check because he was starting to do that thing where he'd cry at the drop of a fucking hat, and seeing Steve cry was a surefire way of getting his own waterworks going.
When push came to shove, they'd been able to fight side-by-side, and the good Captain had even looked relieved and had smiled a little when Tony hadn't died and had started rambling on about shawarma. They'd come to a sort of truce by the end of it, and Tony had offered to put him up at the tower whenever he came back to town.
"Well, I'm not sure how comfortable you girls are with sharing that kind of information with each other."
"Wait," Steve said and put a hand out to stop him. Something told him to do this or else miss his chance, and so with Olivia curled against Tony's chest, Steve brushed his hand over the top of her head one more time and whispered a quiet, "Good night, doll baby," and kissed her forehead. He lingered, brushing the tip of his nose against her forehead and inhaling that sweet baby scent then sat back and nodded that he was done. Tony tweaked a sad smile at him then got up and switched off the television, leaving Steve alone on the couch.
was there — his Steve, his Steve back from the dead (where he never really had been) there with him and hold him and watch him tend to their newborn daughter and…
to say that they couldn't — clearly — but, yeah, I just don't think they're right for each other. Plus, I mean, Thor's got Jane, and you know I love Brucie and all, but yeah, thinking he might be a slight step down from the brilliant and gorgeous Dr. Foster."
"You said assembling the chair was 'idiot-proof,'" Rhodey explained, "meaning that even idiots could do it."
. Who wanted to be tied down to Captain Anachronism for the rest of their life and dealing with his brats? Not him, that was for sure! No siree. It didn't matter how adorable and precocious Olivia was, and it didn't matter how fucking fantastic a kisser the Cap was. That was life best left to some other Tony Stark that was stupid enough or desperate enough for it.
Tony shrugged. "Well, granted they are better at taking things apart than putting them together, but it can't be that difficult."
"So, look, how 'bout we eat, OK? I know it's not… I know it won't fix everything. I know you still feel…" He tightened his arms some and rubbed his hands over Tony's back. "I do love you. I'm not good at saying it. I know that. But I do love you, and I'd do anything for you, and if it means letting go of Bucky—"
Steve just raised an eyebrow at him as he adjusted the baby in his arms, cradling her for feeding. "But you don't deny I have a point."
He gasped as he came, hot streaks of pearly-white painting his abdomen and hand, and he opened his eyes and looked at the mess that he'd made and said a quiet, "
Bruce, however, snorted a laugh and said, "Honestly? I'm thinking a little annoyed but not distressed in any way. I'm telling you, this is… This is just amazingly perfect."
They coasted up the roadway, the traffic a steady flow even at this time of evening. The Friday evening rush was all but over, and the tunnels and bridges were presumably pretty clear by that point, not that Tony knew exactly where Steve was taking them. 'Upstate' really could mean anything from Westchester to Buffalo to Albany and everything in between. Knowing SHIELD, it was probably in the bumfuckiest part of the state.
Tony pulled back to glare at him, but the mixture of love and teasing he saw staring back at him softened him a bit, and he sighed a little and admitted aloud what he'd already admitted to himself.
He shook his head at the waste of colorful and expensive-looking wrapping paper and turned his attention to the fireplace mantle, where three stockings hung: an almost-generic-looking one with the name 'Steve' written in glitter, an older one that looked a little worn and well-used with 'Tony' sewn onto it, and finally the most personal-looking one, a hand-crocheted job with 'Olivia' etched into it. Only Olivia's stocking had anything in it (Steve would go so far as to say hers was over- stuffed). His and Tony's were completely empty and evidently there only for show.
Tony smiled and reached up and pressed a kiss to his lips, and from somewhere behind him, he heard Barton groan and muttered, "Well, that's it. I've finally gotten diabetes from those two. If you'll excuse me, I have to go get a shot of insulin before I go into some sort of sugar shock."
"Whatever," he muttered then said, "So this means she probably has traces of the serum in her, too, huh?"
"So long as you were attesting to the fact that you are, in fact, Anthony Stark," the main clerk said.
Now, the bigger question: Who topped, and who bottomed? Or did they take turns? He had to admit that he himself probably wouldn't really
"All right," Steve said then motioned between himself and Tony. "We'll talk about it. Let you know what we decide. You had anyone asking for interviews?"
"Europe, yeah, I know. The war." Tony sighed again and motioned to the couch. "Sit down, Steve. We have to talk." He rolled his eyes at Steve's hesitance and reached for the little girl in Steve's arms. Steve pulled back, unwilling to let this stranger lay one finger on her, but Tony was determined, and he muttered, "Goddamn it, Steve," and snatched her out of his arms before he could pull further away.
Tony patted him on the back. "Those are stockings, babe, not leggings. Style of the times. Mini dresses were all the rage. Think I've even seen a picture of my mother wearing one. I mean clearly these ladies have the legs to pull it off and
"No," he reiterated, trying to be as breezy and nonchalant as he could, "I'm definitely not dying. I'm just... First Christmas I've had with a family — with my own family — that I've had in a very long time." He shrugged and set the cutter down to pick up a snowman cutter. "Kinda nice."
he would know what really kind of anyone's guess. Would he just keel over right then and there? Would he start to bleed from every orifice? Would he disintegrate?
He must have sensed that his words had made Steve a bit ill-at-ease, because his expression softened, and he even smiled some as he spoke his next words.
The line for service was ridiculous, and Tony whined a little as they came upon the scene of a hungry dinner mob. He bumped his forehead into Steve's shoulder, and Steve reached over and patted his head and said, "Why don't you find us a seat? I'll get the food. What do you want?"
The Councilors shared looks with each other at that, those words having not been spoken to anyone outside of private meetings deep within the confines of the castle.
"I might be, Tony. That's why I said go to an actual medical professional that does this on a regular—"
Natasha glared daggers at Bruce, who shrank away some, then turned softer eyes back to Tony. "Tony, do you want him? I'll go get him. But you know he knows Hydra's out there planning something, and you know how he gets — especially about Hydra."
"Wait," Tony said and looked from one to the next, "you're proud of yourselves for beating a bunch of college students?" His gaze settled on Bruce, and he blinked at him a moment then said, "Wait,
Steve let go of the counter, and he put gentle and tender hands at Tony's waist and moved him away so they could better face each other.
(Which was not something Steve would even tolerate hearing, much to Barnes' frustration. Tony had a sneaking suspicion Steve was happily living in denial about things that had happened in the course of the past seventy years, and he suspected even more that Barnes was growing more and more annoyed with this but was reluctant to say anything.)
"That's OK, dolly. Don't try to fight it. Just let the sleep come over you. Makes it a lot easier for both of us."
child," Steve muttered but sat up some, and he reached out and put his hand to Tony's abdomen and grinned like a fool as he felt the fluttering through the layers of skin and clothing. Tony rolled his eyes and muttered, "Sap," as Steve kept his hand there until the fluttering subsided.
"Is that what we're calling staring at my nether regions and waiting for a human head to pop out from inside of there?"
"I don't doubt it," Steve murmured then got to his feet. He leaned down and kissed Tony's forehead. "Just don't hurt yourself, all right?"
— She didn't turn me pregnant, all right? She turned me into a woman." He glanced at Steve then added to the crowd, "We
"Yeah," Tony said dumbly as Hill bent over and smiled at the sleeping newborn, cooing at her and reaching out to brush a finger lightly against her cheek.
He waited a moment for Steve to feel what he felt, and his eyebrows shot up in surprise and said, "Is that supposed to happen?"
Rhodey made a face and said, "Look, Tones, I love Pepper. You know I love Pepper. I think she's fantastic, and she is so good at getting your ass into gear that she deserves a damned award for it. I just don't think she's the girl for you."
a reflection on you. That's all on me. But I can jerk you off. I've done it before, and as I recall, it went over pretty well."
Tony just stroked his hair a few more quiet moments, and the clouds that had been hanging over the city all day — hey, he'd listened to the weather report JARVIS had given him earlier! — finally opened to a torrent of rainfall, droplets hitting against the windows and cascading down in rivulets that made the lights of the city look fractured and blurry.
"Tony, what do you think happens when the Avengers come to these events?" Pepper asked, exasperation sliding into her voice at that, though Tony couldn't understand how it could be directed at him seeing as this was the first time they'd even spoken tonight. Which totally sucked. He really had to make an effort to talk to Pepper more often.
"Anyway," Sam said, pulling Steve out of his thoughts, "so clearly you don't think any of us are good enough to take charge of your precious little magic baby in the event of your early demise —"
"No, no, nothing at all. Just that in the last half-hour that I've been down here, twenty-five of those minutes have been spent on you talking about everything from Cap's slang problems to the fact that he didn't get one of your admittedly pretty
He blinked and shook his head to pull himself out of his soft, happy thoughts — later, he could watch her sleep
"Relax," Bucky said as he sat back down. "He's still in the building somewhere. Jesus, I know you're quick, but you're not
"Yeah," he said and got up from the chair. "I don't know about this whole 'soul mates' business. First of all, I don't believe in that. Second of all, if it were true, don't you think we would know about it?"
"What?" Tony asked, pulling his hands back because maybe Steve wasn't in the mood to have his shoulders rubbed?
"Tony?" Steve asked, pushing in a little more and trying to peek around the door. "What are you doing?"
Only now was he able to sit back and think about it — regret the fact that Steve hadn't been there with him. Steve hadn't been the one to see him through it. Steve hadn't been the one to look… down there…when he was pushing his child out of him. He was thankful he'd had someone there with him — someone to help him through it — and he was thankful that Barnes and Natasha hadn't both run screaming the other way when it had all gone down but had stood there beside him and held him and told him how well he was doing—
Pepper nodded like Tony had just made her point. "And I'm surprised Steve would put so much faith in that then."
"Why does Jarbus sound like Vision?" she asked and looked at him. Again, with that 'Vision.' Maybe Tony was right. Maybe she was from another dimension.
realize there are other people in the room here, right? Married people flirting is, like, the grossest kind of flirting."
"You got it, boss," Hill said then tilted her head to the side a little and said, "Did I hear there's a picture?"
Barnes shrugged. "It's the principle of the thing. It looks… It looks like you're going to a lot of trouble for him."
"You love us, Stark," Barton said and picked up his orange juice. "Don't even pretend you don't. You didn't want us here, you would have sent us packing a long time ago."
Tony hummed in understanding and nodded as he hit a drawer with his hip to close it and set a small assortment of spoons and knives beside the plate of bagels. "Yeah," he said, "you're 'Daddy.' I'm 'Papa.'"
"Good Lord," he said with a laugh, "Howard would never believe it. Me, being that important to the universe."
Pepper's face went pale, her mouth parting slightly in shock and disbelief, and she stammered out a few non-responses until she was able to get out, "How could—? Why even—? But
Bruce burst out laughing. He couldn't help it. The revulsion on her face and in her voice was too funny for words. "They do, do they?" he asked through his laughs.
"Oh," Tony said with a knowing nod. He exhaled a breath then unfolded his arms and reached out to take Steve's hands in his. "Honey, I've told you a
"Lab," they both said in unison then turned to each other in surprise. Tony then started to say, "I said I would show him—" while Steve said, "Tony said he wanted to show me—" and they turned to each other in surprise again as Natasha said, "Maybe there's something to this 'soul mate' business after all?"
So, even though he knew they'd end up with a few oddballs, he went with just the usual crew and then went about organizing the bash, demanding it be like a Fourth of July Picnic but awesomer and with more razzmatazz. Barton, for some dumb fuck reason, said he had 'other plans.' Bruce asked if he was moonlighting for the Justice League (what was it with people mentioning the Justice League so much?), which confused Thor, who thought there really was such a league and wondered if it was in the Avengers' best interest to aid their brothers in arms, but Barton said no, he just had somewhere else to be that day.
Barnes sucked in a breath through his nose and flexed his fingers around the gun but still couldn't bring himself to squeeze the trigger.
"Yeah, well," he said and patted Tony's shoulders, "what he meant it as and what I took it as are two entirely different things."
"Well, I like to think if anything happens, they'd have the full force of the Avengers breathing down their necks."
He grabbed what he needed, making sure Olivia didn't do something stupid like roll off the table, and he set everything up so he could easily grab and set about changing the diaper, stifling a gag as he pulled the dirty one off and set it aside.
He felt her stroke her hands over his face, and he put his hands over hers and finally looked up to meet her eyes, and he realized she wasn't the one he needed.
He had just finished scraping his plate when he saw Steve still had a good half of his entrée left, and figuring that marriage meant 'share and share alike' — plus the whole being
"Don't believe everything you read in the history books, Tony," he finally appeared to settle on. "It's not always as true as you might think."
Tony took her hand and said, "Natasha Carbonell," in return, but Bruce shook his head and said, "No, it's not."
Tony watched the screen go black before he stretched again and set the phone on the nightstand. Good lord, did he feel
"Yeah, but we all had to listen to you before because you're the oldest. I mean, not counting Thor, but he doesn't count 'cause he's an alien. You're not the oldest any longer, so we don't have to listen to you."
He missed some of what was said after that, but he didn't miss the next line from Carrie or…what was her name again?
OK, inconvenient and very, very attractive. Hey, what could he say? He was only human, after all. And Tony was very, very good-looking. Man or woman.
He just nodded, and she squeezed his arms and made to turn until he said, "Do we all have tells or just Steve?"
Steve was quiet a moment as he scrolled through whatever he was reading on his tablet, and he sounded almost blasé as he said, "You know, those aren't necessarily the same thing."
He didn't bother to notice when Bruce left. Probably when he'd stopped talking. He spent his time curled up on the couch and bookmarking possible selections, and he didn't realize how long he'd been sitting there until he heard a small voice call from the top of the stairs, "Papa?"
Steve pursed his lips and shook his head. "I don't understand that. I mean, I guess I understand it in theory, but how do you keep any feelings from forming? Wouldn't they, you know, have a better chance of forming that way?"
"So, a farm, huh?" Tony continued like he hadn't gone into a slight tree tangent. "I just assumed for some reason that this Clint would be more into, I don't know, spy work or something."
Bruce weighed his response to this before he said, "Yeah, I do. I think you're covering up the fact that you
But Steve had just sat there, happily sketching away, and so Tony had gone back to his projects. After a while, he forgot that Steve was even there, but a cursory glance in the direction he'd last seen him had shown Steve to be marveling at some prototype or another Tony'd had stationed there. He didn't say anything to him, and Steve never asked anything — just looked over the prototype and began to sketch it, brow furrowed in concentration as he evidently tried to get the contours right.
him to do it — 'disgusting' or 'unmanly' or some other equally stupid pejorative. But Tony knew — and Tony especially knew now — that Howard just…well, wasn't
"You know," Rhodey said, digging into his slice of chocolate heaven, "would it kill you to say 'thank you for looking out for me' once in your life?"
"I don't know why you're so funny about saying it," he said after he'd pulled back. "You've watched me jerk myself off before."
"I understand that, but we're not testing it. We shouldn't— Not until tomorrow. Not until after the clerk says we're married."
Mr. Mom. I'm not fucking him. I like Michael Keaton as an actor, but not really my type, if you know what I—"
"Game five of the World Series," Steve muttered like he was still bitter over the events. "It was a Subway Series that year. Against the Yankees. Whit Wyatt and Joe DiMaggio almost got into it in the fifth." He looked at Barnes. "Should've known then that was the end."
"He loves me," Tony said with a shrug and glanced back up to Wilson, who was standing and shaking his head a little, but there was a tiny smile on his mouth.
"Then go to an actual doctor," Bruce said and pushed past him as he made his way over to one of his computer models. "I'm not a general practitioner. I wouldn't even know what to look for."
So, he plastered a tight smile over his face and hoped it would be enough, but Steve just frowned and said again, "What's wrong?"
He noticed that Steve had flushed a little like he was embarrassed, his lips thinning and his eyes looking everywhere but at Tony, and he finally said, "Just…thinking."
"Well, when you do call, make sure you put in enough for the kinfolk. They're threatening to make a return visit later in the afternoon."
"Sacrilegious," he replied without thinking. "I mean, can you blame him? That shield's like his security blanket or like his child or something. Probably sits there polishing it every night until it shines— And no, that was not bad innuendo about him polishing other things like his knob or something, OK? I mean like he sits there with a rag and a bottle of whatever you'd use on vibranium and just works at it into the night. Again, not innuendo."
I'm her dad — her 'papa.' I can feel it, Jim. I can honest-to- god feel it in my bones. She looks like me, for god's sake! You can't deny that."
much," he replied and sat down at the island and grabbed the tablet Steve had left there. He considered the bitten half of bagel he held in his hand and added, "Jesus, this tastes like fucking perfection."
Steve stopped what he was doing, and he turned back to Tony, and, taking in what little he could see in the dark, he simply said, "You need a hand?"
"What are we calling me now?" Tony asked as Steve wiped Olivia's mouth off and steeled himself for one more go with the bottle.
And yet, he was pretty sure Steve was on everything he owned as a co-owner now. He wondered if Steve was aware of that.
They both stared at him, and Steve's mouth quirked up some in a small little smirk. "I know she didn't mean to be offensive, but harassment's harassment any way you slice it."
"No," Steve said as he handed his own over for Tony to hang up. "Not at all. It was…kind of nice, actually."
Her grin broadened into a warm and knowing smile. "I don't know," she said somewhat cryptically. "Am I? And I think the word you're looking for is
He stuck his head under the shower head and felt the water beat against his scalp, wetting and weighing down his hair as it trickled over and down him, the slight tingle he felt as the water dripped from his hair onto his shoulders and back. He watched the water as it circled the drain and then disappeared, a slight whirlpool effect that he found equal parts mesmerizing and contenting. He remembered for only a brief moment that he was supposed to have been pleasuring himself at some point that afternoon — pleasuring himself for Steve's pleasure — but he couldn't even bring himself to touch himself in the privacy of the bathroom and for his own sake. It was hard to think about pleasure when his husband, the father of the little creature that grew inside of him, and the man that some cosmic goddess had assured him was his 'soul mate,' was probably now in the middle of recalling happier times with the last tangible vestige of his former life. Of course he was recalling happier times. Why wouldn't he? What was there to be happy about here? This was the life he'd gotten stuck with, wasn't it? Not the life he'd wanted.
"Give me 'til ten," he said and ducked out of the room, closing the door behind him, and Tony just stared at the door and drummed his fingers on the mattress and wondered if he should be an ass about the whole thing and intentionally fall asleep before then.
Tony quirked his lips into an amused half-smile. "Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show you what you're in for."
Tony made a 'whoop-de-do' motion with his hand, but Steve sucked in an audible breath. "What's that mean for us?" he asked, all business as always.
He thought then about the overwhelming relief he'd seen on that other Cap's face, the way he'd clung to Olivia and cradled her tight and kissed her and promised her all her fears were for naught. Yes, her papa adored her, but he could definitely say Olivia's daddy adored her, too.
He shook his head and led the car out of the tunnel and onto Manhattan city streets. He bore to the left for Midtown and followed the roads back to the Tower.
Tony glowered and grumbled, but he wasn't too proud to reach out and snatch the bagel from the plate and take a large savory bite of it. God, he loved bagels.
He took a sip of champagne, and Steve said, "Yeah, not because it has anything to do with being horribly sexist or derogatory."
"It wasn't— I didn't— I didn't mean—" he stuttered out, but Tony just grabbed a washcloth from the shower, and he wet it in the sink then went about wiping off Steve's abdomen.
It actually wasn't that debauched an experience, their first shower together in years. Tony expected Steve to literally wash him off, standing there and refusing to budge an inch until Steve had soaped him and cleaned him, and Steve took extreme care to gently massage the shampoo into Tony's hair — Tony probably used expensive salon stuff, but all Steve could afford was the value- sized Suave from the grocery store — and Tony closed his eyes and moaned and let Steve take care of him like he had once upon a time, and Steve found it odd how easily they could slip back into these roles, how easily they could pretend like the last seven years had never happened, how Steve could once again become Tony's defender and protector and champion.
"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it," he said and hopped off the chair. The hell he was ever, ever going to have to worry about anything like
"This is a bit more complicated than a tumor. Cap's right. There is no surgeon in the world that we're aware of that has any experience in this sort of thing. They wouldn't know the first thing of how to operate. You'd be a…test subject for them. A test case. Those don't usually go well, and I don't think I'd feel comfortable leaving you in the hands of a butcher. I can't even imagine how the Cap feels about it."
It was quieter down here, the sounds of the public areas upstairs not even a distant echo. There was the buzz of the overhead lights and the hum of the snack and soda machines, and he exchanged pleasantries with one of the afternoon janitors that had probably been working here since before Steve was born. He went into the lunchroom and stowed his bag in the fridge that hadn't been cleaned out in probably five years or more, and he spotted Bucky's lunch on a shelf with a yellow post-it attached to it reading
" JARVIS replied, and Tony nodded and tapped his hands on the steering wheel, grimacing at the continued ache in his right wrist.
She rolled her eyes. "That's what they say," she muttered like she'd heard that excuse a thousand times before and was sick of it.
But Tony pursed his lips and shook his head. "Honey, I don't care who you are. I don't think even Captain America has carte blanche to look through other people's medical records."
"Good," he said and began to struggle to his feet. Barnes made a face like he wasn't quite sure what to do in that situation before he sighed and grumbled something, and then he was at Tony's side, bracing him and helping him out of the chair. "Thanks," he said, and Barnes nodded and dropped his arms away. "Anyway, I was about to tell you I was about two days away from telling you to get a haircut, you hippy."
Steve latched on and squeezed his hand so hard he swore his bones began to grind together, and Steve must have sensed there was something amiss, as he pulled Tony's hand up and looked at it.
"Well, the dawn of the Avengers, anyway." He watched as Steve set his coffee down and went over to the fridge. "It doesn't strike you as at least a
"Yeah?" Tony asked and tilted his head to the side. "You stole that baby away from your friends, and now you're in here trying to be 'useful.'"
"Nope! Not allowed. You said. Can't go. Someone might ambush me. Wouldn't want any vulture with a camera or a microphone ambushing me, would you, Steve? I thought you loved me. Would you really want me to go out there and get caught? There'll be pictures of me all over the internet Steve — really
Unfortunately, the yutz didn't seem to get the message, and Tony heard him say, "Now there's a sandwich I wouldn't mind being in the middle of." Natasha broke the kiss, slow and languid and with a smile on her face, and Tony tried to return it, but when he couldn't quite manage it, Natasha frowned at him and said, "Was that not good enough?"
For some reason, he thought of Steve's hard, thick cock in his hand at that — the other night when he'd jerked Steve off again and actually been very, very close to sucking him off if only that stupid nausea hadn't fucked it up for him. Look, he did like having Steve's cock in his mouth, all right? He liked the weight, liked the girth, liked the feel of it, and liked how used he felt once Steve was done with him.
Tony hummed then said, "Well, better get used to it, honeydew, it's going to be with us for a long, long time."
Tony stared at him for all of a second before he ran off to grab his tablet, Steve muttering, "The hell?" as he ran past him. He found where he'd left it on the table, snatched it up, and was already loading up the requisite web page by the time he walked back into the kitchen.
"She's good and distracted. Less of a chance of mishaps," Tony replied and took hold of Olivia's small left hand.
Steve just shook his head and got up. "I'll go do rounds. Try not to let too many people make off with precious artifacts while I'm gone."
The guy just looked at him and made a face like he wasn't sure why Tony would need to know that, but Steve said from behind him in his utmost Captain America voice, "We can't make you believe anything. We can only lay out the facts of the matter as they exist. Tony Stark was turned into a woman. Tony and I… I got Tony… We conceived a…"
"That was fun. I wanna be a flower girl again. Papa, when Anna Tasha 'n' Unca Bucky get married again, can I be the flower girl again?"
Steve frowned at this, unsure why Welch was directing his disgust at him, and even Tony thought it was a bit odd but then remembered Welch hadn't made sense about anything since the early days of the Reagan administration. Even Howard hadn't thought much of him.
"Is anything I said untrue? Are you really going to sit there and deny you're Steve's princess and he's not up there right now giving Thor the third-degree over whether that space-broad that did this to you is really dead and if there's anyone else that could change you back or turn back time to stop this from happening in the first place?"
Steve blew out a breath, and he stared at the floor a moment and blinked a couple times before he said, "I feel like I
But then Nick Fury had broken into a house that was now at the bottom of an ocean and said he wanted to talk to him about something called the 'Avengers Initiative.' He'd listened, laughed it off, and said it wasn't worth his time. Besides, he worked better alone. Why the hell would he want to join some stupid super-secret boy band? What could he possibly gain from that experience? He was Iron Man, and Iron Man didn't have a sidekick let alone a bunch of hangers- on that would just slow him down.
She handed the clipboard over, and Tony looked at the white sheets of paper and frowned. Shit. He didn't know the answers to this stuff. That's what he had Pepper and Steve for.
in the penthouse. Seriously, you act like you live up here, and now, all of a sudden, you can't get out of here fast enough?"
"Hmm...well, the sentiment remains. You are a troll. You are not a good-hearted little boy scout. You are a devious little rule-breaker obsessed with worming your way out on technicalities."
"Yeah," Steve murmured and, one arm carrying the weight, he reached up with his free hand and snagged a hold of the tiny fist she was waving in the air. "Kinda rambunctious for a newborn, aren't you?"
Tony didn't make it to the bedroom. He only went as far as the couch, found his phone, checked for any messages, saw there were none, and ended up falling asleep on the couch, snug under a blanket that smelled like Steve. He dozed until he was startled awake by his phone buzzing on the coffee table, and he frowned and blinked at it then reached out and picked it up, seeing he had a new message.
He took a sip of coffee and stared at Steve like he just dared him to fight him on that, and Steve stared right back and thought very hard about defending the practices of the medical profession from when he was a kid, but even he could admit that their methods had been...somewhat lacking, at least in comparison to how they practiced today.
Hill nodded and turned to leave, and Tony called after her, "Make sure they put some fruit in it! And one of those little straws! Make it look like a real drink!"
"Doesn't…doesn’t that strike you as suspicious? Either that shirt she's wearing is completely out of date or golden-boy Cap is too good to hang out with the proletarians."
Steve picked his head back up, and he put his mouth by Tony's ear and whispered, "I love you no matter what form you're in, but I'm always going to have a weakness for the man I fell in love with, wrinkles and gray hair and hard muscles and all."
"Friends! You have arrived! I was sent out to make sure our Man of Iron did not, as the Captain put it, 'get cold feet.'" He glanced down to Tony's feet and frowned at the delicate lace-fabric pumps he saw there. "I fear your footwear does not protect you against the elements as well as they could."
Still, there was something almost comforting about the movement, something that told him he wasn't completely alone, and he reached down and rubbed a gentle hand over his abdomen, pausing to poke back at a jab of movement against his right side.
"You're not fine. You haven't eaten anything since you threw up last night. You need to eat something."
Steve just laughed and tugged on his hands. "Come on! Exercise is good, especially for someone in your condition."
He cut into his toast and took another bite. "This morning while you were still passed out. Little store a couple miles down the road. Don't worry. I don't think they recognized me at all. I don't think they cared."
Steve eyed the shape that was clearly the end of a plug covered by tight, teal silk, and he reached out and pressed a finger against it, pushing the plug deeper into Stark, eliciting a desperate keen from the man bent over beneath him.
"Uh, thanks," Bruce said, perplexed, like he wasn't sure whether to be insulted or not. "It's… I mean, is there some sort of polymer that maybe you could work out? Something that would grow and shrink as needed—"
But Natasha just squeezed her eyes shut like she couldn't bear witness to Tony's delusion any longer, and she murmured a quiet and sad, "
Natasha considered this, tilting her head as she looked him over, and she reached out and touched the dark tendrils of hair that fell over his shoulders and said, "You already are pretty. You need a little touching up here and there, but to be honest, Stark, you really do make for a good-looking woman."
With Steve watching the traffic, Tony reached out and pressed the button on the dashboard to go back to the other preset, and Steve groaned audibly as the sound of the previous song blared out of the speakers.
"Don't worry," Natasha said and patted his arm again. "You don't turn back after all this goes down, we'll clue you in. There's a lot about it we probably have to catch you up on."
Thor shook his head and gladly took another plate of freshly burned bacon from Steve. Tony's nose twitched at the scent, his stomach doing a flip, and he swallowed the bile down and thought about getting himself some dry toast.
opportune moment? Maybe when the right chime was sounded? Maybe when the right series of words was whispered? Maybe Barnes himself didn't even know? Maybe Barnes himself was laboring under the delusion that he was safe, that he'd been freed from Hydra's clutches only to have actually had his agency and his humanity stripped from him long ago without him knowing it?
The 'Frozen' thing he figured was a piece of fiction, but the 'Star Wars' thing didn't exactly set him at ease.
He balled up the wrap and tossed it aside, and Thor frowned a little and said, "I am sorry. I thought for certain I had heard our friend Bruce discuss the fact that your body does not age in the same way as your fellow Midgardians — a product of the potion that gave you the physical strength and endurance that you were not born with."
"No," he replied, none-too-happy about it. "We can't. The others would kill us. And I don't mean figuratively. They would
Tony looked to Natasha, who glanced up at him and said, "Depends on if you want them to smudge or not."
, under any circumstances, want to join you for a threesome. And before you try to parse my words and say I have something against threesomes, I don't. Not my thing, but I don't care what anyone else does. And you two are looking for something to spice up the bedroom, which
Steve judged it to be a girl from the color of the sleeper she was dressed in. Her eyes, large and brown, lit up as soon as he stepped into the room, and she let go of the railing then bent down to the mattress beneath her and picked something up, a weird-shaped stuffed animal of some kind, half-blue and half-red. She stood back up and, one arm around the animal, reached out her free hand and said, "Daddy!"
"—probably one of the first times after New York that we went out as a team. Had to call a 'Code Green' — that's what we call it when we have to call in the big guy — and, uh, afterward, Bruce was…having a bit of a hard time coming down from it. Wanted to know if he'd hurt anyone."
He stepped aside and made a sweeping motion with his hand, and Tony smiled at him but couldn't help think to himself,
His arms still around Steve's shoulders, he began to play with the hair at the back of his head and said, "What's the matter, Steve? What are you thinking about?"
" the commentator cried out, and Tony wished he could say he was surprised at how brazenly hateful the man was about the whole thing. It was like he had taken lessons from David Welch but lacked his intellectual flair for reason and subtlety. Good god, this man clearly was awful if he'd made him resort to thinking positive thoughts about David Welch.
Tony hadn't gotten that from it. The sweet, yes, but not vanilla. "So, not terrible?" he said, and Steve shook his head.
Oh, thank god. Steve was still having a harder time of it than he was. He still had control over the situation.
Cap fan. He, like, worshipped the ground you walked on. Tones pretty much broke the spine of his copy of that book, he read it so many times."
It seemed odd, maybe, that she would choose to bring up Howard, and it was something that made him sadly realize yet again that she was from an alternate universe because he would have assumed he'd have drilled it into his kids' heads that Howard Stark was what they called 'off limits.'
"Steve!" Tony's voice called from downstairs, and, startled, Steve nearly dropped the frame. He set it down and went over to the door.
Yeah, now that he thought about it, he kind of remembered Thor standing pretty near to him as he'd stared back at Bruce, completely stuck for anything to say other than, "
Tony folded his arms, but again, the pose probably looked more humorous than intimidating. "And you would know that
