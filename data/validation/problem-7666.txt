“And you still want to…” Tony knew he didn’t need to complete the sentence for Steve to get what he was implying.
“You make it sound like a bad thing.”
Steve makes an exasperated noise and flops a ten-ton arm across the width of Tony’s upper back.
“Can you thank him for me?” Steve asks, barely able to get the words out.
“Take care of the gardens,” he warns, and Rogers nods seriously.
That seems to snap Steve back to his usual stiff-upper-lipped self, and he throws Tony a long, dirty, scathing look for good measure.
“Am I dreaming?” Steve asks unthinkingly.
“JARVIS?” Tony says, face crumpling in confusion before he’s darting back into the machinery again. “You remember JARVIS?”
“Next time?” Tony asks, feeling his face warm, the nerves at the base of his spine prickling not unpleasantly. “You mean to tell me that I haven’t completely shot myself in the foot?”
Not that he doubts that she means it. Pepper has always been lovely and polite, and nothing has happened to change that.
, Steve,” he says, and he can’t put together a coherent thought anymore, his sanity yanked out from under him. It’s just the two of them like this, and nothing else matters, least of all any other versions of them. “Steve, I’m gonna - ”
“Yeah,” Natasha says, all soft and kind, the way he only rarely got to see before the Snap. “Why, you’d rather he explain it all to you?”
The door rattles on its hinges, but that’s as far as it gets.
“Callie wants to visit.”
“I might,” Steve says, blinking hard twice so he doesn’t start seeing double. “I can see it now. Tony Stark isn’t sure whether he resents his dead father or not, and that’s why he’ll spend the rest of his life trying to measure up to a ghost’s expectations. My editor is gonna love it.”
“Thought we didn’t need to worry about birth control,” Steve counters, and then Tony is grumbling something about getting Steve away from children for once in his life.
“Cap?”
Steve shrugs, like he hasn’t been uprooting Tony’s universe bit by bit since he walked through the door an hour or so prior.
“What’s up?”
Tony huffs out a sigh after a few minutes of near silence.
Months pass. Steve plants the seeds from the garden he’d grown for his wife, and Tony attempts to recruit Peter Parker, an event that the Tony from his universe would be happy to know remains a constant. When Tony runs into trouble with his calculations, Steve gives him Scott Lang’s number, and they have several very long and argumentative conversations that have Steve stifling a grin as he eavesdrops. The weight of Bucky’s arm affects him more and more as he remains out of cryofreeze, and when Steve suggests giving the Wakandans a call, Tony gapes at him.
“But really, what about you?” Tony persists, kicking out a foot to knock against Steve’s shin.
“ - just because he’s divorced doesn’t mean she isn’t still in high school. Hi, Steve.”
“Mhm.” She plucks at the thin black strap of her dress which clings in all the right places and ends somewhere around her knees, black strappy heels just high enough to emphasize exactly how long her legs are. There’s nothing wrong with how she looks, per se, but the way she’s been continually adjusting her cleavage all night has him grinding his molars together. “Remember Monaco? The Grand Prix?”
“You could have saved him,” Rogers says, over and over. “You could have - ”
“I’ve been negotiating,” Tony says like it’s nothing, when it’s decidedly something. “I think he’s just holding out, though. Waiting to see how much he can get me to offer. Course, he’ll probably just end up handing it over for nothing anyway, he’s slick like that.”
“You’re going to explain that,” Tony tells him, and he darts forward to snag the keys right out of Steve’s back right pocket with quick fingers. Desperate to gain the upper hand, he strides up the walkway to the front porch, grinning when he hears Steve follow.
Tony is beautiful, and Steve is in love.
“I could really use some orange juice with my breakfast,” Tony remarks loudly, and Bucky wastes absolutely no time in flipping him off with his fleshless hand.
“Tony,” she says with a sympathetic nod, and then politely, “Steve. If we’re ready to head out?”
He does, so he straightens up and mentally promises to be on his best behavior for the rest of the phone call.
He doesn’t get a chance to employ it.
“We’ve got a landline,” Steve tells him, and recites the number, and Sam recites it to Bucky, who will memorize it.
Most nights, he still doesn’t know how he pulled it off.
“She keeps apologizing for kissing me,” Beth says, slouching down even more and swirling the straw in the styrofoam cup. “Which makes me feel shitty.”
“Thanks for swimming with her,” Tony says. Morgan’s in the back, playing on a tablet and verging on cranky as her bedtime approaches.
Steve flattens his hand, feels the stutter of Tony’s heart, and wedges them even closer together.
He breaks off abruptly, looking out into the distance, but his fingers remain still. They are a fiery brand against Steve’s mouth, and he wants this, wants more, but he just waits, leaving things as Tony has left them.
Steve nods, knowing that Tony can’t see him, but unable to speak.
Tony sees the frustration that comes when chasing your own elusive
“You totally sucked his dick.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, grimacing further as he hears how affected the words come out. “I’m just - ”
She asks sometimes, and they both know that he only ever answers questions about Tony. He doesn’t answer all of them, only the ones that don’t make him want to cry or question everything he’s ever known about himself.
“Sir,” Steve says, stepping just inside when Pierce nods at him. “I thought you might take a look at the Tony Stark piece I’m working on.”
“Okay,” he says, ten seconds later when he’s drained a few more long gulps of too-grainy sludge, wishing it was coffee instead. “I’m sorry, let’s try this again. You need me for what, again?”
“I love you - ”
His editor is either going to love him or fire him, and both Steve’s internal balance and judgment are just askew enough for him to think that he might get lucky enough for it to be the former.
He hasn’t seen Tony Stark in more than two decades.
“To the car,” Tony says, like it should be obvious. “I can’t go out the front like this, come on, you understand. It’ll pull up around back. Hey, did I miss the burgers? Someone said there’d be In-N-Out. Walk with me.”
“When we interrupted each other,” Steve says in an attempt to be helpful. “When I told you, I never would’ve let us fight each other. When you told me to go ahead.”
“Tony said you told him he had a kid in your world.”
“What’s the story?” she elaborates. “Are you stepping back, is it stress, are you officially retiring? Come on, I want to know what you agreed on as the official narrative.”
Steve gives most things at least a taste before deciding whether he likes it or not, and he’s unafraid to take what he wants and be upfront about what he doesn’t. It’s a marked difference, at least to Tony, and he grows used to it.
He clears his throat. “And if I thought you should visit that white picket fence like the other you clearly wanted?”
“Let me give you a ride,” Tony says, and when Steve starts to protest, it’s his turn to shake his head. “I’ve got a car, let me save you the fare. I know Vanity Fair doesn’t actually give a shit about you, so let me.”
He’s teasing the sensitive skin leading away from Steve’s navel when the tube bounces off his upper arm.
“The other me was in love with you.”
“Is that what’s been going on with you, then?” Tony tries to deflect, wincing internally when he realizes how he’s completely ignoring Pepper’s words of wisdom. The look Steve levels him with says that he knows what he’s doing, so Tony takes a breath and tries again, aware that Steve is effectively still clasping Tony’s hand within his. “Yeah, alright, it’s weird. We’ve just been through a lot lately, and I want to make sure that you’re dealing with it.”
Instead of snarking back or anything of the like, Tony’s face goes queerly soft and his knuckles whiten around the door frame before releasing entirely, the door resting open just a fraction of a hair.
They argue it for a while. It’s like sparring again, going back and forth, and Tony wakes up some part of Steve's brain that he had believed to be long dormant. He shakes his head and is harmlessly impatient as he tries to convince Tony to see it his way, but he feels loose and easy no matter how wound up he gets, and he has to remind himself that this Tony is not his for the taking. Rather, he relishes the rekindled flame that lies within him, lets himself feel the sparking embers that he thought had been dead for good.
“You mean, at least in a professional capacity,” Tony says, and Steve lifts the box to balance against his hip while Tony makes no motion to get up.
That’s fine, Tony decides. Steve is probably elsewhere in the house, looking for something to tell him more than he already knows, lurking around the corners and ghosts that remain. Sometimes his melodrama gets ridiculous, but Tony knows that all he can do is tolerate it and wait it out when he gets like this. For as many times as Tony has tried to pull Steve out of his frequent funks, he’s failed for the vast majority of them.
Tony expects Steve to be joking along with him, but his expression is serene and genuine.
He then grins mischievously, and Tony has to actively work to keep his mouth closed rather than let it gape open in disbelief. “I’ll see myself out.”
“Anything for you,” Steve says, accepting the not-a-gun to inspect. And then, leaning over to catch the corner of Tony’s mouth in a kiss, “You damn romantic fool.”
For Steve has told him how he ended up here, has told him how everything has lined up, has told him more than he has told anyone else in this universe. He hasn’t told him everything, because he can’t,
He’s tending to the cosmos the following week, carefully cutting off blooms to bring inside and arrange in a vase, when Peggy comes outside. She sits on the front steps and soaks up the sun, and when he joins her, she speaks.
“It’s my fault,” he tells Howard, days later at work on a smoke break. “I messed with the universe, and this is what I’ve been dealt.”
Steve,” she says, and Steve feels his shoulders cave in at her tone. They’ve never been close but he still can’t get a read on how she feels about his presence, and the last thing he wants is to make her uncomfortable.
“I just know better than to mess with the hair,” Steve says, and Tony pouts exaggeratedly until Morgan announces she’s hungry and they agree to get dressed and pick up dinner at a hole-in-the-wall sandwich place.
“No,” Steve confesses as Tony sucks on the fine column of his neck, knowing he doesn’t need to be careful and all the more exhilarated for it. “I hoped, obviously.”
“No?” Steve says, head swimming. It’s a bit of a miracle that he's still managing to form coherent words. “Maybe that’s what I’ll write about.”
But Tony’s breathing shifts, the snores giving way to the easy pattern of deep, even breaths. It’s small, but Steve doesn’t want to risk it. He can’t stand what might happen if he reacts the same way he reacted last time, and so he forcibly relaxes every muscle in his body. Besides, there’s no legitimacy to the possibility that sleeping together had changed anything before, so there’s no reason to worry about anything changing this time.
“You’ve always got good ideas,” Steve says, unbothered. “Besides. I don’t want to be like him.”
, and Steve should walk away, should excuse himself to the Stark Industries-billed hotel room and finish off his night with sitcom reruns, something fried from room service, and a phone call to Natasha as documented proof of his self-control.
Steve thinks that for as much as he’d left New York with self-preservation in mind, he doesn’t have very much left.
“I only wanted to right the balance of things, when I came back,” is where Steve starts. “I didn’t want to leave an extra body in another universe.”
It’s easy to be worried enough for Tony’s wellbeing to listen and stick close. He’s just doing the right thing - no selfishness, not here, not when he’s needed to point Tony in the correct direction. Absolutely none to be seen; just Steve’s usual brand of do-good that gets him made fun of more often than not.
Steve steals the cigarette, and as much as part of him wants to be imagining Tony’s eyes tracking the movement, he doesn’t think that he is.
“We did it?” Steve had asked, blinking slowly. “We - he’s gone?”
“Okay,” Bonnie says, and she looks like she wants to say more, but doesn’t.
Steve nudges Tony’s foot with his.
There’s mortadella on focaccia sandwiches leftover from a sponsored lunch at the office, and Steve frowns and needs five bites before determining that he likes the fattiness, but isn’t sold on the giardiniera.
) and being politely rejected, he knows that in the grand scheme of things, familiarity means nothing whether he lets it settle or not. Just because they’re in the same room again doesn’t mean he’s going to throw caution to the wind this time. It’s not like their relationship means something more to Tony beyond the occasional bout of congenial unprofessionalism.
It makes sense, in some twisted way, Steve presumes. The New Year had broken with news that Tony’d been unceremoniously dumped by Pepper after the entire ordeal over Christmas - not that Steve blames her. He likes to think that in another lifetime, he too would have enough self-preservation to ditch Tony. In the two months since then, Tony’s been plastered all over the gossip rags for less-than-favorable reasons, ranging from stumbling out of clubs with oddly sized pupils to being caught the morning after a night with whichever blonde had been charmed enough to sleep with him.
Wanda is actually hiding a delicate laugh behind her hands.
“Where what?” Tony demands, and he finally stands up. “Where you weren’t wanted? Goddamnit Rogers, why are you always like this - ”
“Oh, so you do know who I am,” he says, snapping the fingers of his free hand before holding up his palm in a very sarcastic
“No?” Tony asks, searching Steve for what, he’s not sure, but he only knows that he’s not able to give whatever Tony needs.
“Neither do I,” Tony says with a shrug. “Tried to make a PB&J once and got raspberry jam all over the kitchen. Ana thought I’d hurt myself, said it looked like blood.”
“Don’t knock the steamed spinach,” Tony says, picking through the home fries left behind in the corned beef hash skillet. “It’s heart-healthy.”
“Don’t be afraid,” he says, because he knows better than the man beside him what he is going through. “Make friends. Be brave enough to love. And trust that no matter what you do, others will want you, too.”
“Surprised he’s not at some fancy-pants hotel right now.”
Bruce crash-lands in New York where Tony and Rogers and Peter are waiting, and no one gets on a spaceship they don’t belong on. Everyone travels to Wakanda and reunites with Thor, and Rogers knows to tell him to go for the head.
He likes the garden better than the inside. It’s less oppressive, less haunted, and he wonders if this is where most of the joy had been experienced. The neighbor boy clearly isn’t a master gardener, but nothing signals neglect aside from the few weeds sprouting up, and Tony circles back to the driveway to sniff at the oversized honeysuckle bushes lining the gravel. There’s a funny looking lawn gnome tucked back under the kitchen window, dressed up as Uncle Sam, and Tony grins at it before snapping a picture, making a mental note to send it to Wilson at a later time. There’s a bird feeder off the back porch and a lightly rusted fountain in the middle of the small yard holding rainwater in its three tiers.
Carol just shrugs and slices limes in half. “He’ll have to build up his tolerance at some point. I mean, look at the company.”
“This one? The alien-infested, Snap-ridden, Thanos-invaded universe? That’s your favorite?”
Tony spins around, taking a second to catch himself from tripping over his own two feet before his eyebrows engage in some ridiculous waggling thing. “You been keeping tabs on me, Rogers?”
Steve walks over, still steady on his feet. He tugs the bottle out of Tony’s hand with little to no effort despite the death grip, and meets Tony’s wavering gaze head-on.
“Easy,” Wanda says, and Sam looks at her incredulously.
Steve frowns.
“Do you want to try again?” Tony asks, all body parts back on his side of the car as he glances at Morgan in the rearview mirror.
Steve feels like he’s waiting for something. Some sort of sign, a grand signal, something to tell him that it’s okay to tell Tony the last of it. The most important bit of it all. He opts for a truth that isn’t quite it, but close enough.
Peggy hovers for a moment, that uneasy expression on her face, but then Steve moves to the sink, bottle still in hand, and she backs out of the room without another word.
This is fully written, and I plan on updating regularly.
Tony paces.
“I wouldn’t mind,” Steve says, in case that’s the issue.
“So we let it mean nothing?” Steve asks, verging on amused which doesn't fit at all. “The other me was in love with the other you and let that fact shape the fate of the universe in a desperate and twisted attempt at penance, and you think we should forget about it?”
if he wanted to, which is how he really knows he wouldn’t.
He’s throwing a football around with Zeke and Manny in the backyard when Beth slips out, phone pressed to her ear and watermelon gum snapping.
She holds up a fistful of crumpled bills and Tony laughs, pushing the espresso machine back to its proper place and crouching in front of his daughter. Steve can see the twinge it causes him, but he doesn’t even hesitate as he pulls the cash from Morgan and flattens it all out.
For five minutes, Steve’d had his share of internet fame. The piece was all anyone could talk about, published in its entirety as he’d originally intended with the minor addition of a footnote about how the kidnapping didn’t change a single thing about how Steve had regarded Tony after their day together. It had been a risk, but one that had paid off massively despite how Steve quickly became known as the guy who’d publicly declared his love for a missing man via blog post.
“You’ve earned this,” she tells him, pushing his hair behind his ear, and Steve wishes he’d thought to pack some of his growing collection of children’s hair accessories.
“Right,” Steve says stupidly. “Water?”
“Of course,” she says, opening the front door to show him outside into the dazzling California sunshine, and he knows that she will be doing no such thing for him.
The conversation is clipped, concern belying Peggy’s easy words. Dusk falls as the call comes to an end, her fingers gripping the receiver tightly as she hangs up.
Steve ends up in the middle of the couch as Ratatouille begins to play on the tv, with Charlie on his left, Christina in his lap, and Beth on his right. Bonnie wiggles her way on the floor near Tony, who’s got Jackson and Serena leaning into him. The older boys are still acting like they’re too cool to hang all over Tony, but the way they’re watching what they’ve previously deemed a “kiddie movie” while they could be doing anything else gives them away.
She swirls her fingers around, and Steve clears his throat and puts his sandwich down with trembling fingers.
He clutches Tony tighter, and Tony squeezes just as hard.
Steve really doesn’t pull any fucking punches, does he?
“Well, at least let me offer you some alcohol swabs,” Tony says, even though he’s nowhere near the first aid kit, which is sitting way too far away to be of any use to either of them at the moment. “Or some Neosporin. Hey, we’ve got Neosporin in there, don’t we?”
“No,” Sam says, the single syllable layered over a laugh, and Steve detours by the window to shut it completely before landing on the corner of the sectional opposite Sam.
“I’m not most people,” Steve says, now sitting down on the bench across from Tony to yank off his boots. “There’s barely any on me, I think most of it got on the suit.”
Steve’s nostrils flare in annoyance, and Tony can’t help but smile pleasantly.
Back at work, Steve is putting the finishing flourishes on his contributions to the article about the after-party. Most of it centers around the fashions of the night, but he makes sure to slip in just enough indulgent detail to allow readers to feel like they’re getting an exclusive peek into one of the biggest events of the year. A fly on the wall kind of approach, he thinks, pen slotted behind his ear as he leans back in his chair and rakes a hand through his hair for the tenth time that afternoon.
Steve looks up like he hadn’t expected Tony to take notice of him, but he sets his jaw and doubles down.
“She’s packing,” Pepper explains, inviting them into the kitchen where she’s got a half-filled glass of white wine. She offers one to Tony, who declines and begins investigating the underside of some countertop appliance, and then to Steve, who accepts because it won’t hurt and will give him something to do with his hands. “She’s in some weird independent phase,” Pepper continues as she lifts onto her tiptoes to retrieve a minimalistic stemmed glass from a white lacquered cabinet.
“I think your interrogation skills could use a little more work, sunshine,” Tony tells him, delighting when he sees how the experimental term of endearment makes Steve frown and go pink. “Might want to spend some more time with Romanoff. It took you like, two seconds to cave and tell me what was up.”
Steve weaves between furniture to the kitchen, some of his not-anger bleeding away into his past where it belongs. The sliver of extra brain space provided is immediately used up by the realization that Sam’s finished the last of the peppermint-mocha creamer, and Steve reaches for the carton of milk while accepting that it’s just going to be one of those days.
Steve’s been in love with the cocky billionaire, the reckless superhero, and the reluctant bachelor.
And that’s a surprise.
He thinks, for a second, that he’s having a heart attack. Between the lack of air circulating to his brain and the roaring in his ears, it feels entirely possible. Steve is distantly aware of Pierce talking, but the only thing he can focus on is the news ticker at the bottom of the screen, clean black letters spelling out the latest disaster like it’s nothing more than a headline.
They sit together for what feels like seconds and eons, wound together, utterly unconcerned with anything else.
“She’s also got no reason to make ridiculous assumptions,” Tony scoffs and Steve runs his hands down his thighs.
Steve’s fingers squeeze almost too tight, five pinpricks of pain accompanied by the faint crush of wood.
“It is,” Tony says insistently. “If anything, he’s a third wheel to me and Morgan, and - ”
“There aren’t so many babies anymore,” Elliot says, soft-spoken as he trails after his sister. “They’ve all grown up.”
Tony doesn’t answer right away, too busy downing water in long swallows that Steve refuses to watch. When he pulls the mouth of the bottle away with an exaggerated smacking of his lips and a faint hiccup, Steve offers the plastic cap.
“I get the analogies,” she cuts him off. “When’s the last time you had any reason to use a shopping cart?”
The expression on his face is such that Tony immediately feels bad for making light of it, and he forces himself to be serious.
“Hey,” he greets her. “Need help with homework?”
“How would I?” Steve points out. He hasn’t been carrying a phone, and if the kids don’t mention it, he keeps his nose out of the news.
“I thought you’d want me to talk about why Iron Man deserves to fight the good fight,” he says before he can convince himself to shut up and let Tony run the show, because they’ve tried that and it’s never worked out too well for them. “I’m the one who fought for you when you were in Afghanistan, and everyone knew it. Hell, you’re the reason Vanity Fair hired me. I owe my career to you, otherwise Pierce would’ve had Conde Nast blacklist me.”
“He himself has publicly confirmed that he does, occasionally,” Steve points out, giving in and rolling his eyes.
She clearly sees something in his face or hears something in his tone, because she comes back and leans up on her tiptoes to kiss the side of his face just once.
He shakes his head, rests his cheek against her stomach.
I love you, too.”
She holds him until he stops crying, but it doesn’t do much to quiet his mind. He lets her think that he’s crying for them, for what the universe seems to be denying them. Truthfully, he’s not entirely sure what he’s crying for.
“You’ll answer them?”
He swallows and gives Steve a considering once over.
But then the weight of the words sink in.
Until the mattress dips and Steve looks up, jolted from his maudlin thoughts at the sight of Tony rubbing his hands together.
“Lucky for you,” Tony says, mouth twisting into an encouraging smile, “I didn’t need decades.”
There’s some rearranging and Tony has to take his fingers out and lube back up and Steve insists on kissing him the entire time. Even when Tony tries to ask if he wants another finger before they try fitting him inside, Steve chases his mouth and is so devastatingly persistent in his want that it would kill Tony to deny him.
That earns him a giant smacking kiss, which earns the both of them several disgusted exclamations from the peanut gallery.
“You should tell Steve to wear his beard like this,” she says, so tired that she’s getting delirious.
“Yeah,” Steve says after a few long moments, eyes wide and lost, searching for Tony who merely presses in harder. “I don’t think that’s going to be a problem.”
Tony keeps noticing.
“Yeah,” he says. “Can I do something for you?”
“Don’t leave again,” Tony murmurs, and Steve nods, entranced.
Tony falls back onto the cushioning with a drawn-out groan.
“In every universe,” Steve agrees, and he speeds up and kisses the back of Tony’s neck and tells him how much he loves him until Tony spills over his fist with a never-ending marrow-deep shudder.
Steve reassures him that it’s okay, and he doesn’t mind going for a run, and the kids want souvenirs so he might head to a tacky shop on a pier. Tony tells him to take his pick of the car keys, and it feels a little like avoidance, but mostly it just feels like they don’t know what to do with each other.
Only time will tell.
“So,” Tony says, once he gathers the necessary courage. “Do you want to tell me what’s going on with you?”
“Thanks,” Tony says, and he smiles but it’s tight around the corners. It’s not his broad, easy grin that Steve’s come to recognize over the years, the one that feels like it could be just for him if he ignores the rest of the world around them.
“Tie-dye,” he explains, looking it up on his phone to show her. “Your dad told me you like coloring on things, so this is another way to do it.”
“She would,” Steve says, lingering over a small photo tucked into a mirror frame. It’s of Wanda and Vision, and Steve respectfully doesn't comment on it.
The residential wing is quiet, and Steve suspects superior soundproofing techniques. He sees the picture wall and they spend a solid fifteen minutes in front of it, recounting memories and laughing at the dry erase marker someone has taken to the glass fronts. There’re devil horns on Bucky in a few, and Tony’s got drawn-on armor in one of him and Morgan.
“Hi,” he says blankly, still a little too disoriented to automatically mind his manners. He reaches for them as quickly as he can, leaning forward and extending an open hand in her direction. “Ms. Potts. I’ve heard so much about you.”
Steve doesn’t want to leave.
“I just thought,” Tony says, metered and neutral, “that I wasn’t really into the idea of anyone else wearing it.”
“You ever give up the gig? Or are you like, permanently on call? Always sniffing out the latest scoop?” Tony’s not quite as demanding as he’d been five minutes earlier, but there is a weariness in the way his hand scrubs over his neatly trimmed signature facial hair that makes Steve want to give him an inch. He knows an inch with Tony can turn into a mile faster than anyone on planet Earth can run one, but old habits die hard.
Steve wonders how old this boy was the last time Tony had been an active Avenger.
“But I don’t work for TIME,” he reminds importantly. “In case anyone’s forgotten.”
Natasha heaves a giant sigh and swivels her chair into Clint’s shin, earning an injured
There’s a minor misunderstanding over the menu at a benefit sit-down dinner, and Steve is too nice to put up a fuss but barely picks at his duck until Tony takes pity on him and swaps for his filet mignon.
There’s no reason that should feel like a memory, Steve thinks, frantically verging on hysterical.
Steve looks away, hands falling to his sides.
Maybe it’s not a coincidence. Maybe it’s fate.
He doesn’t finish, but Steve gets it. He might be unofficially retired and better at going unnoticed than ever, but Tony is still Tony and the two of them together might garner too much attention.
“I’m not carrying machine guns on my shoulders,” Tony tells him for the millionth time.
“Come back,” he says, scrambling for words as the seconds seep from between their fingers. “Or - I’ll come back.”
They continue in that vein for a while, Tony swerving every question with a flippant non-answer while Steve digs only as far as he can courteously manage. After all, this isn’t supposed to be some harmful exposition in which he vehemently opposes whatever views Tony insists on showcasing. As willing as Steve is to back Tony’s opinion, he’s not here to antagonize him into fitting whatever role Steve had expected him to play. It’s surprising, and maybe this feature will need to end up being little more than a look into the circumstances surrounding Tony’s secondary identity and the impact he’s had on the world. That’s something Steve can write about, even if it’s less interesting than the angle he’d expected to have to take.
“Wanna blow you,” Tony tells him, assuaging the insecurities he instinctively recognizes. He flattens his palm against the deep line of Steve’s spine and urges him on. It’s dry and rasping, the friction too much and not enough but perfect to keep them suspended like this. “Thought about just dropping to my knees in the compound halls and jerking you off, and getting my mouth on you just in time for you to come.”
“Because as it turns out, there’s a bit of nostalgia in me after all,” Tony says, and he’s grinning ruefully. “It’s just something I want to do. For you, for me, who knows? Maybe it’s for my old man. If you don’t want it, I’ll give it to someone else. Hell, you don’t even have to use it. I can let Morgan use it as a sled in the winter.”
“I’m not most celebrity CEOs,” Tony says, eyes sliding over to Steve. They’re not narrow, but they are shrewd, calculating. It figures, the man doesn’t miss a beat.
Happy grumbles as he circles back to the driver’s side, and Pepper remains utterly nonplussed in her seat.
in response. Steve just waits, leaning against the edge of the cubicle as Natasha swivels forward again to continue reading what is something like his thirteenth draft of edits while Clint delivers his uninvited color commentary from somewhere above her left shoulder.
“You did more for him than anyone else would have,” she says, and the man coming round from the front of the car is familiar, a glance at his face jump-starting Steve’s memories of Tony’s bodyguard-slash-driver-slash-trainer-slash-whatever else Tony needs him to be.
It works, because over the course of the night, Tony’s proven that he likes to talk. About himself, about his hyper-competent assistant, about the awards ceremony he’d skipped out on in favor of extending the interview past the initially allotted time. Steve’s mind catches on that for a minute, remembering the dark-skinned Colonel and barrel-chested executive. They’d momentarily crossed paths back in the casino, after Tony had won back his hefty chunk of change but before he’d whisked Steve off to a central booth in a cocktail bar with fantastic ambiance where they’d grown overheated enough to have Tony suggesting a dip in the pool within an hour.
that Steve thinks it might be the last straw.
“That they were basically us,” Tony says. “Because the way I look at it, we can approach it one of two ways.”
Tony clears his throat, and Steve immediately pulls his hand away, cheeks pink as he straightens out the fabric.
Pepper comes by the next morning to pick Morgan up for a dentist appointment, and Steve pretends he isn’t eavesdropping as he helps Morgan lace up her sneakers.
“That’s very admirable,” she tells Tony indulgently. Then, to Steve, “I’m afraid I must go see Jarvis for a bit. SHIELD business. Would you prefer to come along with me?”
“Petty?” Steve asks incredulously. “How am I being petty?”
“So when you rebuilt things, you weren’t - ”
“Did you get any In-N-Out? Or should we stop along the way?” Tony looks expectant, and Steve grinds his teeth together.
“And then this one here,” Tony adds, gesturing towards Steve with his cup, “got all dramatic about it. Acted like I’d died or something.”
“I hope Happy’s back soon,” he says quietly. He’s mostly out of the car, doing his best to smile at the driver, when he hears -
“Take care of yourself,” he tells her, and she hugs him tightly. Steve returns the hug, just as tight, and almost lets himself think about how much he’ll miss them.
Now, he’s fallen in love with the evolved philanthropist.
Eventually, the clearing of a throat separates them. It’s Rogers, of course it is, holding the shield.
“Obviously,” Tony says when he breaks away, resting their foreheads together. “Where else would I be?”
“Keep it,” she says, and when he twists around, she’s unwrapping what looks like a slice of lemon pound cake. She must see the confusion on his face and elaborates. “The last line. I mean, Clint’s right, as much as it pains me to admit it. The whole thing does make it sound a little like you’re in love with him, but who isn’t a little in love with Stark?”
but then slots the proper one inside and twists back and forth until he feels the mechanism shift.
“Yeah, I’m sure,” he mutters under his breath.
“I wish you would let me share this with you,” Peggy says, and the frustration underlying her tone is a deviation from their usual routine.
It’s going to take every ounce of self-control Steve possesses in order to avoid getting off to this as soon as he makes it into his apartment and hangs the tux up.
“I want to be here,” he tells her.
Steve turns around and forces himself to smile.
“Okay, rude,” he says accusingly, because yeah, maybe he’s got a teensy tiny speck of a crush on the guy with metaphorical balls bigger than the sun and a limerick inspiring backside, but it’s not like there’s anything to come of it. Tony knows this because he
He’d left Tony without forcing himself to remember that it could be the last time they’d ever see each other. It’s strangely fortifying, driving his fingers onward, and this time when he gets to Tony’s name in his contacts list, he doesn’t get stuck.
Steve shakes his head.
A rapid
Someone should’ve cut him off earlier, Steve thinks aggressively. Someone should’ve been looking out for him, but then again, it’s not like anyone’s been looking out for Tony since Christmas -
He can’t focus on that, he decides, but then half a dozen phrases pop into his head, and he’s stuffing giant bites of horrendous breakfast down his throat all while typing furiously into his laptop, fingers striking the keys with a ferocity and passion that he hasn’t felt in years.
“Can you not?” he asks, quickly losing his patience. It’s not entirely her fault - he can admit that much, can blame how spacey and self-flagellating he’s been on another individual who’s had him so out of sorts that he’d nearly missed his stop on the train that morning - but she’s certainly actively making it worse.
“Yeah,” he exhales, relieved that she can fill in the blanks when his own tongue fails him. “I don’t know what to do.”
Steve knows. Accidents, lack of resources. He swallows around the lump in his throat as she keeps going.
“It was a decent thing you did,” she continues, and when the light flashes green, she steps down off the sidewalk in her signature heels with all the grace of a woman who regularly navigates crowded city streets in pointy stilettos. He has to use the full length of his stride to keep pace with her long legs, and briefly wonders if she towers over Tony when like this before vanishing the thought from his mind. “Especially considering what Pierce was asking you to do. It’s very difficult to say no to your superiors like that, but you stuck to your guns.”
“Excuse me?” Steve asks, fingers scrambling to pick up the almonds before they can scatter to the floor.
“What, about her dying?” Tony asked. Then, belatedly - “Oh. Told other me about you?”
The bands tug around his heart. He knows that everyone is watching him so he forces himself to pull it together, to stroke the back of the baby boy’s hand with a single index finger.
When they break apart, neither of them make any movement backward. They’re so close that Steve’s nose is brushing his, that Tony can see the sweep of his eyelashes, that they’re just breathing each other in.
He means it.
Bruce is clutching a half-empty bottle of wine and swaying slightly over in the corner, and Natasha is fully seated on the counter and mid-laugh, wrapped in a hoodie at least three sizes too big for her. Pete and Sam are arguing over the music selections, Bucky on the fringes while attempting to shake off the raccoon-looking creature who seems a little too interested in the vibranium arm.
“I’ve got him, darling,” she murmurs, easily transferring the tiny bundle to her arms. “I’ve got you.”
I meant it. You think I say things and don’t mean them?”
“ - you’ve revealed approximately five details about your personal life, two of which I half-gleaned from your personnel file when I sat in on your yearly employment review.”
Steve reaches out a hand to cover Tony’s, to stop its incessant tapping on the table. He looks Tony in the eye, making sure he sees, before shaking his head.
Just a second, he promises himself.
“We don’t have to,” Tony says without inflection but watching just the same. “I can keep them from coming this way, or we can go somewhere else.”
It’s not as scary as he thought it would be. He’s not crying, sure, but there’s still a relentless flood that rushes and will take ages to slow down and calm. It’s not so terrifying when Tony tugs him in, helping to nestle Steve’s face against his. Tony helps, taking the destruction and turning what could have been the biggest mistake into the greatest decision Steve has ever made.
Steve kisses Tony hard, hard and sudden enough to send the crown toppling sideways, and Tony rescues it faster than Steve’s reflexes can.
“You’re telling me it gets worse? Goddamnit, Rogers,” he tells Steve.
Steve is just a journalist.
“I will,” Steve says, and he doesn’t get it, but maybe he’s not supposed to.
In bed, Steve grips Peggy’s hand so tight he’s afraid she might break. She doesn’t say anything, doesn’t complain, not until his hold eventually loosens.
“Yeah,” he says, nodding solemnly. “You’re right.”
have a favorite universe? Is one of them inherently better than the other? Except maybe that’s not a good question, because ours wasn’t exactly spectacular towards the end there, so - ”
Tony can smell him, thin layer of perspiration and deodorant and the general air of freshly-washed cleanliness that has always accompanied Steve’s civilian clothing. It’s nice, comforting and grounding like a lazy Sunday spent inside, and Tony angles an elbow back to make contact with Steve’s stomach.
“So when you told him that your selfishness would bring about the end of the world…”
“Sounds fun,” he placates, because they both know Tony’s not serious. Well, he’s not one hundred percent serious, at least. “Don’t forget the fireworks.”
The words get caught in Steve’s throat, but the look in Tony’s eye makes him think that’s okay. He’ll get another chance.
But Steve’s looking away, looking out the window through which is a perfectly lovely but boring view of the grounds, and Tony has to actively work his jaw to keep it from dropping in shock.
He’s aware of Natasha watching him as he forces himself steady enough to continue deleting, except the piece is saved to the company server and he doesn’t know how to -
“But really, I do have to go,” Tony says, and Steve knows the earnest regret there isn’t being faked. “Take care, Steve. And let me know if you ever need anything.”
Steve hums thoughtfully.
Tony half expects Steve to back down and mumble some excuse, but is pleased when instead he stands up to his full height and levels Tony with an evaluating look.
He’d picked it up the first time they’d happened to be forced to sleep in the vicinity of each other. The team had avoided that kind of intimacy, but when they’d been hunting down HYDRA, it had become unavoidable. Only when necessary, and in shifts, and almost never Tony and Steve at the same time. But the first time, in the back of the Quinjet after a particularly long and grueling excursion while Clint piloted them home, Steve had laid down and paid attention to Tony’s breathing before falling asleep with military efficiency.
“You wrote that one article.”
“I’ll buy the fucking tux,” Tony murmurs, slow and syrupy as his liquor-washed breath laves over the bare skin high on Steve’s neck, pressed in close and hard. “You know I can, I will.”
“You recovered,” he says, and he runs a hand through his hair. “And you’ve got your people, and that’s fine. You recovered last time, and you didn’t need me. You didn’t need me this time either. And that’s fine. I don’t need for you to need me. But I couldn’t do it anymore, Tony. I couldn’t sit around and watch you move forward while we still weren’t on speaking terms.”
“You’re welcome,” Tony manages to say.
“If you’re good for your mom,” Steve says, lowering his voice conspiratorially, “I’ll work on getting your dad to say yes to Disneyland.”
“Can you blame me for being curious?” Christine asks, lifting one arched eyebrow. “Or should I remind you that in the nearly four years since I showed you to your old, tiny cubicle back in the bullpen - ” (he scoffs at the notion that an environment in which salad without kale is as good as a carb and people regularly leave an hour early to make it to their waxing appointments on time could ever be considering a fucking
“My father works a lot,” Tony remarks, nibbling at his toast. He doesn’t even sound sad and Steve hates it, knowing that the wheels are in motion and that everything will go as it should, exactly as he wanted it to.
“I’m not a big fan of questioning the past,” he says slowly, tongue significant with every word. “I try not to unless necessary. So I’m not going to sit here and pretend like you didn’t play a large part in why I stuck with it. It’s all said and done, no matter what you think of it. I put out that piece about you, landed at Vanity Fair, and my editor knew I would get the job regardless of who my subjects were, so I’ve attained a certain level of professional success over the years that yes, you had a hand in. But I don’t regret it.”
He recalls calloused hands, deft as anything. Half his mind wants to reach out and feel for them, to test the solidity of their existence, but the other half won’t cooperate. It insists on dragging him under, slow and soothing, like rocking a child to sleep.
“Just?” Natasha prods when Steve doesn’t immediately finish, and he hates that she knows all the tricks to use against him.
Dragging the toilet paper over his mouth, Tony staggers to his feet and Steve backs up to make room for him.
“Yeah, well, I’m not just anyone,” Steve retorts. It’s not clever, but he’s putting too much effort into tamping down a scowl to come up with anything better.
Steve clears his throat, smoothing a hand down his hopelessly wrinkled front. It gets Tony’s attention, head whipping in Steve’s direction, and it feels cowardly to dare to look anywhere but directly at him.
“Don’t you deserve another shot?”
Steve doesn’t know when he became such a coward. He only knows that he has been alive for too long, that he has hurt too much, and he is far too tired to know what to do.
It’s true - there had been a throwaway couple of comments somewhere between the cocktail bar and the pool, halfway through a discussion on the potential growth of social media beyond Facebook and Myspace and the subsequent effects on Tony’s various ventures. But when Steve had logged into Twitter after landing in JFK the previous afternoon, he’d had an unexpected uptick in followers, prompted by the follow of one Tony Stark.
A man like Tony Stark is always charming, and Steve’s been struggling not to read into that all night.
“No.” Steve casts around for the right thing to say, cursing himself for both denying and indulging Tony as much as he does. “You said - you said you’ve got a lot of questions,” he finally lands on.
“Hey,” Steve says firmly, and he thinks about it for a second before reaching up, touching the back of Tony’s hand. “You know it wasn’t all on you.”
“He’s all I’ve got!” Rogers erupts, and there’s a reason that this is the moment in time Steve had pinpointed, the slice of time where he had to intervene. “I’ve barely got Peggy, we both know you don't count, I’m all alone, and he’s all I’ve got! I could have had him all this time, but you’ve been too busy playing house! And HYDRA - you could have stopped them but they’re still there, and now I’ve got to - ”
It’s a question Tony should be asking Steve, rather than the other way around, but he just maintains his position.
Tony disappears back to the bathroom and Steve settles in again, but can’t bring himself to open the book.
Morgan crashes into him, all briny-wet and smiling with her adorable baby teeth. He’s somehow earned her childlike trust, and he smiles back and enjoys the way the water cools his heated skin.
The phone rings and Peggy gets up to answer it. “Jarvis,” she mouths at Steve, who nods and continues to eat his breakfast.
“Well, now I just feel like shit,” he says loudly, mouth going dry.
“Take a minute,” Steve is telling him, kissing the side of his face, and wiping fingers on Tony’s side. Tony wants to tell him that’s gross, wants to complain even when he knows they’ll both be thoroughly cleaning up later, but he just lets his weight bear down on Steve all at once and inhales unsteadily.
That makes Steve go quiet, leaning against the door and battling his mounting nerves.
“You wanna tell me about you?” Tony asks, and his mouth, his goddamn fucking sin of a mouth, fits right up against the thin skin over Steve’s thumping artery. It’s brief but intentional enough, and Tony shifts back not more than an inch. Giving them an out, Steve notes.
“I think we deserve to go out with a bang,” he says indulgently. “I have a few ideas. How do you feel about private islands? Lots of drinking out of coconuts, skinny dipping, that sort of thing.”
“You’re a stand-up guy, Rogers. You know that?”
"How does it know what age to reset us to?"
Steve’s never seen Iron Man in action before - when would he have? - and the countless reels of footage he’s watched over the years don’t even come close to doing the real thing justice. It’s breathtaking, awe-inspiring, and every other cliched phrase in the English language. For a brief moment, Steve regrets refusing not only the offer he’s just turned down, but the one from years prior, too.
Steve levels a glare at her, hoping that she’ll dismiss any blushing on his end as a product of the heat from the thousands of bright lights dotting the venue.
“Absolutely not,” Tony says with a shake of his head. His hair is shorter, Steve notices. It must fit under the Iron Man suit better this way - less chance of flopping into his eyes and obscuring his vision mid-flight. “You know me, avoids responsibility at all costs. But since Pep dragged you down here - ”
“Am I getting uninvited from my own retirement party?” Steve asks dryly.
Tony brightens as he demonstrates, and the hours pass until Peggy returns. After that it isn’t long until Maria appears in a cloud of expensive floral perfume and pearls, and Tony throws himself at her until she pats his head gingerly, looking for all the world like she has no idea what to do with him.
“I don’t work for TIME,” he says, eventually, once it sounds like she’s done. He slurps at his drink, lukewarm and definitely not meant to be consumed outdoors in near-freezing temps. “So I’m really not sure why you’re contacting me.”
“She’ll be grumpy if you do,” he advises.
“Have you finally stopped being a luddite, then?”
“I thought - ” Tony frowns, lopsided and bothered. “You look familiar. Like something...someone from a dream. Not like someone I knew.”
“What did you think about?”
“I guess so,” Steve says diplomatically.
He spends the evening talking with Tony, reminding himself that this is not the Tony from his universe. This is a different man, one who has come to know a different Steve, and remembering that helps. Tony walks around as he talks, hands sketching in the air to demonstrate what he’s worked out and what he needs to finesse, and Steve listens while reaching deep in his brain for information he had never fully understood, attempting to help where he can in the hopes that time travel works in this universe the same way it had in his.
“No,” she says. Steve puts everything down, relaxing into a fully seated position so he can look up at her, see her nervously toss her curtain of hair over her shoulder.
“All of it.” Steve’s mouth feels dry, his tongue sandpaper against the backs of his teeth. “I let so much go unsaid.”
But watching Tony pace? Watching him scrub a hand over his face and notably avoid the crown on his head? Watching him walk away, only to come back, always coming back, no matter how many times he goes to put distance between them?
Steve thumbs at the sweat on Tony’s brow and then he’s being rolled on his back, shifting obediently as Tony guides him. He draws strength from somewhere, resisting the urge to lose it all as he picks up where Tony leaves off, holding on so tight that he almost worries it’s hurting until Tony’s plants a steadying hand on his chest for leverage and then fire licks through Steve’s veins and all he can think is that nothing will ever compare to the sight above him. They move together until Steve swears they’re one, rocking and gasping and promising each other everything there is to promise.
He rocks back on his heels as they come to an intersection, and Pepper wordlessly indicates that she intends to continue heading straight, so he waits at the light with her.
Tony leaves one hand tangled with Steve’s, freeing the other to shift Steve’s face closer to his. They’re already so close, like they’re desperate to crawl into each other for the rest of eternity, but the lack of urgency makes it something else entirely, something indescribable.
Yeah. That’s definitely all it is.
So Steve angles the phone to capture where Tony is pacing the shore, leaving behind footprints that are effortlessly washed away by the tender caress of the waves. He’s on his own phone, talking about something probably business or compound related, and after telling Beth that that’s all she’s going to get, Steve stretches out on his towel and relishes the way the sun beats into his skin. Morgan splashes around until she tears herself out of the water, pulling at Tony’s shirt with dripping hands, but Tony just shakes his head and points up at Steve.
Tony shakes his head. “I’ve got steaks thawing for dinner,” he says, jabbing a thumb towards the door.
“Are you ever going to - ”
Tony looks at him long and searching, and no matter how badly he wants to, Steve refuses to flinch or break the stare.
“Steve!” Alexa gasps. “But - I - ”
“How does it work?” Steve asks, thinking of Natasha asking him to
me? When?”
“Is it weird to think about?” Tony asks, only once he’s sure his voice won’t give away how dangerously close he’d gotten to crying.
“I stopped for all the usual reasons,” Tony says, light, like despite what he’s said earlier, he’s really not all that worried about what Steve includes in his article. “You ever realize that suddenly that last flight of stairs feels a lot longer than it used to?”
He holds onto her for dear life.
He hadn’t realized how much he was counting on Tony making an appearance. Steve knows exactly when it’s supposed to happen and so far everything has happened as it should. It makes sense that this universe is so similar to the one he’s come from, but suddenly, the uncertainty drowns him.
Tony sighs long into the phone. “Yeah, I think I know what that’s like.”
They’d driven down from the compound sometime after lunch without much of an itinerary. The entire plan had consisted of Steve turning to him a week after they’d sent his older counterpart back into his original universe, asking if he’d be willing to check out the house situation with him, and Tony merely replying that he could arrange to have his weekend schedule cleared. It figures, really. The two of them aren’t exactly the plan ahead type, too used to improvising under pressure, and this is no exception.
“She tripped and fell,” Serena says, even though she’s already repeated the story several times. “Right on the street.”
(See the end of the chapter for
(Near the bottom of the list is the fact that Steve eats cold pizza for breakfast sometimes, which is absolutely unacceptable. Tony refuses to allow that into his life.)
On the afternoon of the sixteenth, Steve paces until Peggy grabs him and forces him to tell her what’s going on.
He can’t believe he ever missed it, really. It seems so obvious now.
“I did not tell you, in my universe,” Steve says, and his voice grows even rougher. “I was scared that you would hate me, and I was unwilling to be the one to hurt you. We weren’t close, not at all, but I desperately wanted to be. I placed my wants above what you deserved, and after a series of very unfortunate events, we fell out hard.”
It’s an explanation for why they’ve barely ever met, and he hopes that it’s adequate.
“I showed you mine, you show me yours,” Steve says with a straight face, indicating his own right side, and Tony wants to flinch but instead deflects.
“I can help you,” she persists, and they haven’t had this conversation since he first came back, since they talked at length about how they were going to do this, what they could and couldn’t live with, and they’d agreed that he would only ever share what he chose to. “Whatever it is, Steve, we can do this. Whatever it is about that boy - ”
Chin dipping back down and lashes fluttering open, Tony gives him a look.
Most days he walks around with a tight band encircling his lungs, the low but constant anxiety never fully leaving him. He helps grow SHIELD, does his best not to interfere, because that’s the price he has to pay for allowing himself this indulgence. He thinks of Bucky and HYDRA and a glacier in the Arctic and doesn’t say anything, no matter how much the band can feel like a noose.
“What?”
“Thanks,” he says, motioning to the water. “I hope you don’t mind, but I’m just going to...”
“It’s certainly what I’m known for,” Tony says, distracted. Then he leans in, grins, all sharp-toothed and dangerous. Like a fucking shark, Steve recalls, thinking of how for every chip he’d lost back on the casino floor, Tony had won them back twofold at the very least. “So. Tell me.”
“Oh, chocolate chip pancakes!” Peter says excitedly when he appears, his pajamas dragging on the floor and wrinkles from his pillow still pressed into half his face. Steve’s not entirely sure he’s awake, but then he asks if he can get some eggs going, and Tony moans out a yes that has Steve looking at him sternly.
“You’re a good dad,” Steve says, and Tony looks surprised by it. “Morgan’s a good kid.”
“Why?” Steve asks, reaching for an almond and crunching it between his molars. “Why d’you need to give me anything?”
“I’m gonna come if you keep that up,” he warns, and Steve’s resulting pout is nothing if not charming as he reluctantly lets go just enough to help lead Tony to his entrance, leg falling to hook over Tony’s hip.
“It was a lot of nonsense that I made up to complete the application properly, but I basically told them that you needed me.” Steve must have noticed the look on Tony’s face because he went on. “You might not have known it, but you needed me. Or more like you needed someone to look after you. And not just from far away, but an actual, physical person to care for you.”
“I told you, I was scared!” The look of defeat on Steve’ face made his heart ache. “And even if I wasn’t, how the hell was I going to tell you? How was I supposed to tell you, a vampire of all things, that I wanted you to be mate? I couldn’t do that to you!”
“You’ll see them soon. I’m only here because they thought I would be most suitable to welcome you.” The doctor then gestures around the barrack. “If you’re wondering, no, this isn’t what the afterlife looks like. This is just to reduce the shock and help you get acclimatised.”
He sits back upright, looks at Steve and says, “I just wanted to know if you could catch me up on what you guys talked about at the meeting.” Tony feels bad about having been so out of it yesterday. If he’s going to make things right, he's going to have to work harder.
Reaching the apartment, Tony knocked on the door. “Steve, you there? You okay?”
So, despite everything telling him not to, Tony crouched down and reached a hand out. “Steve? It’s me! Don’t you know who I am?”
Tony blushed again at how intimate this was all getting, pulling his hand away in instinct. But he reached forward again, cupping the side of Steve’s face, warmth seeping into his palm. The angel nuzzled into the touch, and suddenly, it all became clear to Tony.
A collective groan filled the room as detectives, officers, and staff alike fished out their wallets. Steve and Tony looked at each other in confusion before turning back to Rhodey. “Wait… you guys made bets on us?”
“Of course not, silly.” Tony squeezed Steve’s hand. “Even if it didn’t, it wouldn’t change anything. I would still be your mate.”
Okay, so this chapter was originally just about Peter and Bruce, but then I got an idea for how to torment Tony and also sneak a bit of Stony into this story. And then the chapter just evolved into something completely different than what was originally drafted...
"Don't. The team's already stretched thin. You'll just make this worse," Rhodey warned.
"I don't drink," Cap said.
Steve jolted, not realizing that he had like the anger show. "Sorry, Pete, I was zoning out. I think I'll leave the robotics to you guys. Not really my thing."
"We'll stop this," Steve whispered to him. "Next time Ultron shows his face, we'll stop him for good."
fine. Where is Tony?"
"Bad dream," Peter's voice was small.
"One more thing..." Peter took out a pen and paper and left a note on his desk. It read,
"That explains why nothing we're doing is working..." Tony took out his tablet and pulled up one of the scans he had taken of Peter's body. Sure enough, there was a small square at the base of his skull. Tony had mistaken it for part of Peter's spine the first time he had seen it. "FRIDAY, get Banner up here. We need to operate immediately!"
The person pressed the scalpel against the inside of Peter's forearm. "Try not to scream too much. Okay? I don't have the patience for it."
"We're seriously going to let a teenage lead us into battle?" Sam gawked at Steve. "Why are we even going to Queens? Is something about to happen there?"
"You should let me borrow Iron Man again sometimes," Clint's wife spoke up from her chair on the porch. She was working on her laptop but politely closed it so she could talk to Steve. "I could use the break every once in a while."
"Stark! Watch where you're going!"
"Oh."
"No, you're just complaining," Natasha said.
Steve took the headset back. "Iron Man, please trust us. We're going to clear your name and bring the real killer to justice, but first, we need to get you to safety. SHIELD is still on your tail, and we both know that they don't negotiate."
"The hell are you doing?" Natasha frowned.
"From scratch?" Tony blinked. "It took me a few days to put the original together after I finished the design."
"This is cruel and inhumane." Tony sat on his haunches, glaring at the two.
"Adopted son. Adopted him two years ago from today, actually." Tony shoved his hands in his pockets and looked away.
"Of course he is. He fires me on a regular basis. Sorta. He says I'm fired. But then he still expects me to come into work the next day. It's weird." Peter shrugged. He took a big bite out of a cookie, then spoke again, "it's fun though. The job. I like being able to take pictures for a living."
Iron Man settled into the grass next to Steve, so close that their thighs were touching. The robot pointed at the sketchbook and Steve gladly handed it over. Steve leaned against the bot while he thumbed through the book. He was a little embarrassed by just how many drawings he had done of Iron Man. Most of them were of a human version of Iron Man but of Iron Man none the less. Steve had a habit of coloring the human version's eyes solid blue.
"That's what I just said!" Sam threw his hands in the air.
"Nay. Like I said, it is not mine."
A man calling himself a god and waving a magic stick?
"Please stop referring to your legs like that," Pepper shifted around uncomfortably.
"Watch where you're going, dickhead!" Clint waved his fist at Iron Man, who was already climbing back into the sky, repulsor flames trailing behind him.
"Don't. Touch. My. Kid." Happy snarled.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose, "no, no...that's not was I meant..."
"I already did. Peter's fine," a new voice spoke from the doorway. Everyone turned to see Spider-man standing before them, hands on his hips. The wall crawler was the newest member of the team, having joined shortly after Tony took him in two years ago.
"What shall I tell them the meeting is about?" FRIDAY asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Iron Man," Steve warned as he circled around him, checking for any damage. Iron Man moved his head to follow Steve's movements but otherwise remained still.
Iron Man looked away, knowing that Bruce was right. "The AI I'm designing for it just needs more work. I'll be able to control it, just give me more time-"
"They were using the same tech as the Vulture," Peter said suddenly.
"Plus, Peter will be pissed if he finds out we went to the donut shop without him," Tony said when he returned. He plucked a glazed donut from Steve's box. "And if Peter gets a donut, then Clint will want one, and then Sam...slippery slope."
"Back off or he dies. I'm mere millimeters away from crushing his windpipe," Doc Ock threatened.
"Dude. You shouldn't go in on this alone-" Ned started.
"A lot of people say that. And they're usually lying," Michelle pointed out.
Peter thrashed around in Iron Man's arms, kicking his legs and slamming his head against the chest plate. The glass cover on the arc reactor cracked. Whirring noises came from the suit as it struggled to hold Spider-man.
"It sure looks that way to me," Fury pressed play on the computer. Tony stared blankly at himself electrocuting Peter. There was no sound on the video. Tony didn't need it anyway, those screams still echoed in his mind. He would remember them until the day he died.
"Fine," Steve trudged out of the garage, closing the door behind him.
"Step son." Peter glared at the lump of wires in his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
The pencil scratched on the rough paper as Steve quickly sketched out Iron Man's basic form. Every time his eyes flicked back up to the bot, he was flying at a different angle. Steve worked faster, trying to get as much detail down as possible before the bot once again changed direction.
"You're sick, Banner."
"I didn't."
"I have to get back to Queens, I have finals tomorrow." Peter sat shirtless on a table, kicking his legs back and forth. Tony had his back to Peter, not letting him see where he put the tracker. The name Peter Stark repeated over and over in his head. Legally, his surname was now Parker-Stark. Although, everyone just shortened it to Stark. Peter still wrote 'Parker' on all his school work.
"We should get him to the infirmary," Bruce suggested. "Steve, can you carry him?"
"You didn't get into another fight, did you?" Tony frowned.
"Always am."
" Tony slammed the glass on the bar. "
Tony showed them no such thing. Three months ago, he would've been ashamed of what he had done to these humans. Now, he was past the point of caring. He completely forgot about the "protect" part of his mission. All he cared about right now was the "fight".
(See the end of the chapter for
"On my way!" Clint responded as he jumped to the next roof over. The distance wasn't too bad, but the snow on the roof made landing a bit of a hassle. He stumbled in the slush for a minute before darting across the roof.
Tony nodded slowly and said, "we should probably check out the ones in New York first."
"You answered my call but not Steve's? What, are you two having a domestic squabble?" Bruce teased.
"Jesus Christ, who else knew about you?" Clint frowned at Tony.
Spider-man walked through the compound with his head held high. Bucky walked behind him, close enough to let people know not to mess with Spidey, but also far enough away that he wasn't smothering Peter. Clint didn't hang around the compound much anymore. But Bucky still lived there, and followed Peter around like a lost puppy whenever the wall crawler visited.
Iron Man took hold of one of Steve's hands in his own, "exactly like that."
Peter laughed nervously, "two years ago. I may have crashed a plane into it..."
"FUCK. I swear to god, Cap-"
Steve shook his head, "you have weapons in you, but you yourself are not a weapon."
"There's no 'if'." Peter took a large bite of pancake, then continued, "they will come for me. And they will try to kill me. But I won't go down without a fight."
Spider-man's lenses narrowed in rage. "You're twisted! Fucked in the head! I'm a human being and you can't just-"
"You?" Bucky actually laughed at that. "Oh come on, they adore you."
The other bot growled as it stood, "always fighting back. You need to learn when to stay down."
"Where. Is. Peter."
Tony slammed a button on his desk. Iron Man parts came flying out from all areas of the room. His body was encased in the gold and red armor in a matter of seconds.
"I am," Spider-man's lenses narrowed. "I've already killed two people. One more won't matter."
Steve studied the chart, looking to see what parts Iron Man wanted to be taken off, before picking up a screwdriver and getting to work. He took off the faceplate first. The metal wasn't as durable as Iron Man's and came off with little to no effort. The inside looked like a computer, with wires and circuitry. It was nothing like what Steve had seen when Iron Man cracked his own helmet. He distinctly remembered the metal plates that formed the shape of a human face and a glowing circle in the eye socket. "It's different."
"A little help here, Stark!!" Steve yelled, narrowly avoiding getting his throat torn apart by Venom's claws.
"That window doesn't open."
The sound stopped just as abruptly as it had started. Peter looked up to see Iron Man standing right next to him, part of his gauntlet unfolded to reveal a small sonic cannon. "Sorry, that was probably tough on your ears. You good?"
"Of course not. I just hoped it wouldn't have taken you two years to do something about this. The food here is awful," Wanda Maximoff rose to her feet and moved closer to Bruce. "How do you plan on getting me out?"
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" Peter screamed.
"I'm sorry."
"Someone's feeling better," Rhodey observed when Tony came upstairs for dinner, freshly shaven and fully clothed. "Steve called again by the way."
"Don't worry about it," Spider-man kept his head down, glad his mask hid the blush on his face.
The building shook as the dragon forced its way down the narrow staircase. Bricks shifted, parts of the ceiling caving in around Steve. The dragon roared in frustration when it couldn't force its massive body down the staircase. There was a loud crack, and suddenly the dragon was charging down the stairs, one of the walls completely caving in. Steve scrambled to his feet, narrowly avoiding a large chunk of rock that fell from above. He darted into the next room. A dining hall. Wooden tables and benches lined the walls. He hopped over the tables, desperate to get away from the raging serpent.
"I've dealt with worse," Tony grumbled.
The dragon was quickly closing in, and the ground was starting to slope uphill and become rockier. Natasha dove into a small gap in the rocks. She slid down a narrow tunnel, coming to a halt in a large cave. Bruce followed suit, tumbling down into the cave and bumping into the assassin. Thor had to shove Clint through first since they couldn't both fit at the same time.
A cheery automated voice picked up, "The number you are trying to reach is no longer-"
"Tony," Clint said softly. "I know we don't see eye to eye very often, but you're still my friend. I don't want you to die. I don't want Cap to die either, but you shouldn't be risking your life like this."
"My experiments started before I got to know Peter. He's a good kid, and I understand your attachment to him. But at the end of the day, he's still my lab rat. And he will continue to be until I've completed my research." Bruce said, his voice monotone.
The man fighting beside him turning out to be an actual robot?
Steve was at his side in an instant. "How bad is it?!"
"Stay here," Rhodey gave Tony a sharp look before leaving the room with Bucky.
"I second that!" War Machine said, using his shoulder gun to mow down several bots.
"Sir, please calm down," a man in a lab coat tried to reason with the upset scientist.
Spider-man hopped to his feet, "fixed it?! What did you do to me?!"
"That's the biggest load of horse crap I've ever heard," Sam commented.
Steve hadn't asked any more questions after that.
Peter heard heavy footsteps, signaling that Cap was walking away. A moment later he heard Tony shuffling off in the opposite direction.
The robot looked down at the man in his arms, "I got you, Cap. Hang on!" Steve barely had time to secure a hold on Iron Man before they blasted back up. Iron Man swerved through the falling debris. The entire tower was coming down at this point. Iron Man made an abrupt turn, shooting out the side of the falling structure and into the crisp night air. Once they were a safe distance away, Iron Man turned back to face the tower. He hovered in mid-air, holding Steve tightly in his arms as they watched their home crumble. The Quinjet flew off the landing pad just in time.
(See the end of the chapter for
"For the last time, Clint. Iron Man is not a pet. You can't just-"
"Spider-man, no!!" Steve screamed.
It took everything in Tony's power not to run to his son right then and there. Instead, he shuffled behind Steve and the doctor, wringing his hands anxiously. He swallowed at the sight of Peter lying on the hospital bed. Thick bandages covered his torso, his left arm in a cast. Angry purple bruises littered his body. An oxygen mask placed over his face. The doctor moved around to the other side of the bed, checking on the IV in his arm.
Steve laughed, "he's adopted. And he's a lot nicer than Tony. Good kid. You'll like him. Although, he probably will kick you in the shins if you tick him off. You already met him. At the airport. Back in 2016."
"No. We have a situation, Peter." Tony's voice became grim. Peter could hear other voices in the background. His enhanced hearing picked out Clint, Thor, and Rhodey. Possibly Sam as well.
"Everyone knows that light in your chest is what's keeping you alive. Especially your enemies. They are going to go for it first, probably taking out your ribs in the process-"
"What are you doing?" Steve frowned.
"I don't know how long it will hold this time. I will do it, nonetheless." Wanda reached out again.
Happy roared. The crowd quieted after that. "
"Okay, okay," Steve pulled the blanket up and turned away from Iron Man.
"What do you mean?"
Peter shook his head, "this is something I have to do alone."
"Move!" Rhodey shoved his friend back. "Bucky-"
"Can you help me find him? If Tony finds it first he might kill it," Peter shuddered.
"Let's go!" Wanda climbed onto her bike, with Peter getting onto the back of another one. He took a deep breath and gripped the handle bars. In the back of his mind, he knew how to operate a motorcycle, yet he still felt like he was getting on one for the first time. "Calm down, little brother. You've been on one of these before."
"Lockdown?" Steve's brow furrowed in concern. "Maybe I should go check on him."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony watched him out of the corner of his eye. "Don't do anything reckless," he said to his son.
"Aren't I the one who's supposed to be reassuring you?"
"I can't. I...have band practice."
"I should've helped," Clint whispered. "Look for him, I mean. Maybe if you guys had one more set of eyes, we could've-"
"Who...who are you?" Peter whispered, his lenses wide. With his only memory that of being tortured, fear gripped at his heart.
"Not my fault!" Tony said.
Thank you for reading!
Steve felt bile rising in the back of his throat. The image of Tony lying motionless on the ground flashed before his eyes. He had hit the ground at an awkward angle. His arm torn to shreds by the dragon's claws. Tony wasn't moving. Probably never would again. No. Steve shook himself. They couldn't have been more than twenty feet in the air. Maybe twenty-five. A normal human could survive that. Right? Steve leaned against the wall, trying to think of something else. Anything other than Tony's still body lying in the grass...
" Steve hauled Tony off towards the exit.
"What if he loves you back?" Bucky tilted his head.
"What about Bucky? I'm gonna call Bucky. He's been worried sick, too." Rhodey scrolled through his contacts. He hovered over Bucky's name for a moment, waiting for Tony to protest. Tony remained silent, staring at Rhodey expectedly. Rhodey pressed the call button.
"They won't."
I think as of right now this will be a 10-15 chapter story. Unless I come up with other ideas. We'll see.
"I spoke with him in great detail for nearly half an hour. He was nothing but friendly and humble. I believe that he means no harm. Time will tell if I am wrong, but for now, I trust him," Vision explained.
Peter shrugged. "My old webs lasted an hour. I don't know about this stuff," he looked down at his wrists. "Four hours? Maybe more?"
"Clint. Get your coat. We're taking the kid DOWN." Tony grabbed his own coat from the back of a kitchen chair and raced after Peter.
"This is serious, Tony. He really might be in danger," Sam gave him a disapproving look, effectively wiping the smile off Tony's face.
Steve's hands trembled.
"Man of Iron, please stand down," Thor standing now, giving him the same heartbroken look as everyone else.
Steve turned to a clean page and handed it over, "go for it."
"Hell yeah, bug boy saves the day!!" Clint put Peter in a headlock and ruffled his hair.
"Who the hell do you think you are?" Tony snarled. He punched the enter key, effectively deleting the last trace of the Iron Man schematics.
"I don't think I can do this," there was very little color on Peter's face.
"We need to find out who attacked Stark's kid. And bring them in before they can strike again," Natasha explained from her spot on the other side of Captain Rogers. "The security camera's in the area are dodgy. This is the only footage we have."
?! You're mad, Osborn! MAD!" Spider-man yelled.
"Yup. Get ready to jump, Cap!" Widow responded. Seconds later he heard the roar of a Quinjet flying towards them. The agents dove out of the way as the jet surged across the deck. The hanger door was open, and Steve jumped in at the last possible second. Clint had to grab onto him and pull him all the way in.
Tony frowned at the tank. Henry had definitely grabbed Tony's interest. He wanted to find out more about the spider. Maybe run some tests. Would Peter allow him to do that, though? He could study the spider while Peter was asleep. But what if the spider told Peter? Tony resisted the urge to slap himself.
It took every ounce of will power Tony had to not attack Bruce the second he was free. "Don't have to tell me twice." Tony stood protectively in front of Peter. Clint and Natasha were already running off down the hallway, while Sam and Rhodey drug Bruce in the opposite direction.
"Okay,
Peter nodded and slipped out of the vehicle. Happy frowned. Was Peter limping? Had he gotten hurt while on patrol last night? It had taken Peter all of five minutes to find the new tracker in his suit and rip it out. So Happy had no way of knowing what had happened to the teen these past few days. He tried tracking his phone, but Peter left it at home when he went out on patrol.
Clint gasped, "rude!"
Henry watched the scene unfold from his place on the ceiling. His many eyes trained on the Goblin. He didn't fully understand what was happening, but he knew his owner needed help. Images of the Avengers flashed across his mind. The big one with blonde hair. He seemed to be in charge. He would know what to do. What about the one with black hair and the metal exoskeleton? That particular human could get here the fastest. Henry shook himself. He didn't like that one. He hated that human almost as much as he hated the one who shot pointy sticks for fun.
Natasha put on the autopilot and slumped in her chair. "That's enough excitement for one day..." She looked over her shoulder to see her teammates crowding around War Machine, who was still holding Iron Man in his arms. The robot's eyes were dark. Natasha grimaced at the damage done to his armor. War Machine carefully laid Iron Man out on the floor.
"Yes it does, you ass." Spider-man's voice was muffled by the glass. "Let me in."
Henry reared up and hissed.
"Unfortunately my scientists were unable to recreate the masterpiece you and Mr. Parker once made. I had Parker's kid give it his best go. In all fairness, the kid didn't know what he was making, so that may have been why he was unsuccessful. That and he backed out of the project the moment his blood was needed," Osborn spoke slowly. "Such a pity. We were so close."
Bruce took off his jacket and threw it at Spider-man. "Let's try not to be too suspicious. Okay?" Peter nodded in agreement and quickly zipped the black jacket up over his brightly colored spandex. Wanda slapped a helmet over his face.
Steve jolted awake in a cold sweat, a scream tearing from his throat. Images of the war still flashing before his eyes. Images of good men, of friends, being shot. Blown to bits. Images of Bucky falling. The feeling of the ice-cold water that had engulfed Steve when he crashed the plane into-
"You've been awfully quiet tonight, Spidey," Ned observed, his voice loud and clear through the communicator in Spidey's ear.
"You'd sacrifice your son to keep the Venom away from me?"
"Things don't need to be 'made right'," Clint said. "I say we forget about him and move on."
Steve didn't question anything when Iron Man took his hand and guided him through a maze of hidden hallways. They went down a flight of steps, and Iron Man punched a command into a virtual keypad on a glass wall. The doors slid open with a whoosh of air.
"I'm well aware," Peter chuckled.
"I took care of it. Wanda won't be a problem anymore," Spider-man said, his voice dark.
"It would appear so," Fury nodded. "I believe I owe you an apology," he said to Iron Man.
Steve rest his chin in his palm and looked over at the tree.
"How many times do I have to tell you to sit like a human being?" Sam snapped at Peter, whom he was sitting next to.
"Keep looking!" Steve called back.
Bucky tightened his grip on his glass. Tony had purposefully hurt himself. Again. No wonder Steve looked so upset.
"Let me," Steve took the reactor and guided the wires into the housing. He was just as panicked as Bucky was, yet his hands were much steadier. He wasn't quite sure what he was doing. He must have done something right, because he heard a soft click, and the reactor brightened. He could feel the device humming in his palm. Bucky let out a heavy sigh of relief. Steve pushed the reactor all the way in and twisted until it clicked.
"This doesn't seem right," Spider-man looked over at him.
Iron Man decided to make his presence known. "
"They'll kill each other," Natasha appeared next to Steve. "The others bots have been taken care of." She added quickly. "Iron Man's fighting the last one."
"You let an emotionally compromised person just run off in a suit of armor with enough weapons to level the city? What the hell is wrong with you, Rogers?!"
"Five more minutes," Peter wrapped himself around her. Michelle reached back and ran a hand through his hair. It was a Sunday, and neither of them had work. Michelle put her book on the pillow and rolled over, snuggling up to her boyfriend. "I love you," he kissed her forehead.
"No, it's not!" Steve slammed his fist on the desk. Tony didn't even blink. "Your name is Tony Stark. You're human. Whether you believe that or not doesn't change the fact that you are human. And you don't get to just check out when things get rough. Whatever's going on inside your head, we can help you. There's therapy, medicine, whatever you need to feel whole again, we can get that for you."
The buck changed direction, now making its way right for them.
Peter bolted upright at the sound of his father's voice.
Steve entered the living room, clad in full Captain America regalia, shield slung over his back. His boots were wet with snow, and tiny flakes sprinkled his helmet and shoulders.
I know it's been a hot second since chapter 13 was posted, but life has a tendency of getting in the way of things. Although, I always planned on coming back to finish this story.
"Peachy," Peter wiped the goo off his sleeves. Venom wouldn't be getting up for a while.
Spidey wasn't quite sure where he was. It looked like an abandoned subway station. Where at though? He just knew that after he had called Michelle using Wanda's phone, the former Avenger tied him up and drug him down a dangerous looking staircase.
The man slowly turned around. "Mr. Stark, I can explain-"
Tony just huffed. "I'm going for a walk." He stormed out of the room.
"Don't leave me."
"Steve, I made my son cry. I made him scream. He begged me to kill him." Tony choked out. He had his back to Steve. The lab was in shambles. Tony had instructed everyone to stay far away from the lab until he was sure it was safe. Less than an hour later, FRIDAY had informed the Captain that his presence was needed in the lab. None of the other Avengers, or Michelle, were allowed in. "He wanted to die."
No more secrets.
"With stuff from my lab and with my help," Tony said.
"You little...I knew I should have cut out your tongue instead..." Bruce spat.
"Tony Stark is dead." Tony moved across the room, retrieving Iron Man's helmet from a chair and putting it on. He turned to face Bucky, blue eyes glowing almost threateningly. "I am Iron Man."
Iron Man grabbed one of the arrow prototypes he had been working on and pointed it at the archer. "I'm gonna shove this up your ass. Bend over, birdbrain!"
"Great!" Peter stretched his arms and took a deep breath, enjoying everything the New York air had to offer.
Bruce shook his hand, "thank you. I hope to do more business with you in the future, Mr. Osborn."
Tony fumbled with the pencil. The gauntlets always made grasping small objects difficult. Steve leaned against Iron Man, head resting on his shoulder as he watched the other man draw. Tony drew his vision of Steve as a robot. The design was a bit like his own, but bulkier and with a patriotic theme. His drawing skills were nowhere as good as Steve's, and it showed. He drew a mustache on the faceplate and handed the sketchbook back to Steve. "Now we have matching facial hair."
"Tony! Answer me! Please!"
Steve threw his phone onto his desk and leaned back, groaning loudly as he rubbed his eyes. He had just spent an entire hour trying to convince the team that he and Iron Man were not dating. Which was true. They cuddled because it was fun. And it calmed them both down. Especially Iron Man, who seemed to be more on edge lately. It wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world, but they made it work. There was absolutely nothing romantic about it. Steve may have made his feelings for the robot very clear, but Iron Man still hadn't come forward with any of his own feelings. Steve's phone buzzed again, causing him to groan once more. His teammates really need to let this go.
"Actually, I am. As your team leader-"
"Forget the semi! This is where Peter is." Tony said.
Peter smiled and wrapped his arms around his father in a tight hug. Tony returned the hug, clapping Peter on the back.
The dragon hovered a few feet off the ground, with Steve struggling in its hold. It roared as it started to climb higher into the sky. Tony bolted up the side of the hill, kicked off a rock and flinging himself at his friend. He grabbed onto Steve's lower leg, his own legs dangling uselessly below him. The dragon faltered at the sudden extra weight but kept flying. Tony shot a repulsor at the dragon's foot. The beast screeched and struck Tony with its free claws.
" Clint texted.
"What was that about?" Clint frowned. The only light in the hotel room came from the lamp on the bedside table. Everyone, even Vision, was looking at Peter with concern.
All three men were blasted in different directions. Iron Man crashed into a car, setting off the alarm and leaving a sizable dent.
"You seriously thought I was going to kill him? Don't be stupid. I'm going to use him to kill Stark." Wanda glared at the Captain. "I want Stark to know true pain. The agony of losing a family member. I want to watch him be torn apart, mentally and physically by the person he cares about most. I want to see the look of torment in his eyes as his own son rips out his heart."
Spider-man made his way through the woods, leaves crunching under his feet. The light was leading him up the mountain, to the same ledge he sat on earlier. The red light suddenly twinkled away into nothing.
"We just want to know more about Peter," Natasha explained, her voice calm, yet demanding.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Did you?" Iron Man tilted his head.
Steve carefully stepped over the broken glass that littered the robot's workshop. He held his shield up, fearing the worst. He had come down to the workshop to talk to Iron Man about upgrading said shield. What he found made his blood run cold. The room was a complete disaster. It looked like a tornado had plowed through. Dumm-E hid in the corner, not making a sound. Someone must have broken in. Which was highly unlikely, considering no one knew this place existed other than him and Pepper. But something had clearly happened. Someone broke in. And that someone might have attacked Iron Man.
I poured my heart and soul into this story, and I'm so happy right now.
"To answer your question, there was a lot that went into earning their respect," Peter shrugged. "Part of it probably has to do with Iron Man being my dad."
"I'm not sure...I just know everyone but you guys got out when the fire spread so I came back for you." Rhodey sighed. He cut Steve free and guided the two men outside. The rest of the Avengers were sprawled out on the lawn.
"Stark wasn't the one who did this," Steve pointed out the name at the bottom of the file. "I believe Doctor Banner owes us an explanation."
"When I first saw Peter it was at his parents funeral. I told myself back then that I would never get involved in his life. I wasn't able to keep that promise. I should've just let him be. Then none of this would have happened." Tony's voice cracked on the last word.
"Think they'd make a tiny throne for it? Maybe a little red cape?"
He went back to flipping through the sketchbook, freezing when he came across an actual photograph. The image was taped in, Steve had been planning to use it as a reference for a drawing he never got around to starting.
Iron Man hovered next to him for a moment while FRIDAY scanned the teen, making sure it was safe to move him. "Just hang on, Peter. I'm not going to let you die. Not here. Not like this." The AI gave him the okay and Tony instantly scooped Peter into his arms and blasted off. "FRIDAY, call Happy. Tell him I have Peter."
"Open the window or I swear I'll-"
Kraven lounged on the couch, legs propped up on the armrest. He rolled a tiny vial between his fingers, studying the strange black liquid within. Osborn had given him a small piece of the symbiote as a way of thanking Kraven for letting him use Spider-man. Osborn didn't really explain what it was, just that it would make Kraven stronger. Faster. More aggressive in his hunt. Kraven wasn't one for drugs, but he was intrigued by the substance. Physical contact. That was what Osborn had said would activate it. Kraven wanted to test it out, but he wasn't about to try it without knowing exactly what it did. An idea popped into his head and he slowly turned to look at the arachnid still chained up on the other side of the room.
Steve's head snapped up. "W-what?"
"You sure, Tony?" Steve had his doubts although he landed the jet in an empty lot anyway.
"I'm not in the mood for anything," Tony reminded him. Steve had rarely left his side this past week, wanting to make sure Tony was taking care of himself. And also to be there in case Tony had another hallucination. The constant babying annoyed Tony to no end, yet he was also somewhat grateful. He wouldn't have eaten or slept at all if it weren't for his teammate.
A dark voice echoed in the back of his head,
"After he took out Anthony's heart," Steve's voice was barely audible. "He had us both paralyzed. There was nothing I could do." The super soldier hung his head in shame.
"Are you alright, friend Tony?" Thor put a hand on his shoulder.
Iron Man stared at him for a minute, then tugged on a latch that made the gauntlet fold open. He used the screwdriver to point to various parts as he explained how it worked. He expected Steve to get bored and leave, but Steve remained at his side, completely fascinated by Iron Man's words. Iron Man wasn't sure when Steve had laid his head against his shoulder, but he made no move to push the soldier away.
The armor turned on heel and followed its owner.
"He's home," Steve echoed. The soldier looked more like himself now that his bot had returned to him. But he was still worried. Iron Man could feel pain. He still couldn't shake what had happened from his mind. Couldn't forget the way Iron Man had clung to him, oil dripping from the cuts in his armor, begging for them to help him. Steve shook himself. Iron Man didn't like asking for help. Just thinking about the bot begging felt so...
"She has it out for everyone, don't take it personally," Clint assured him. Tony's sight locked onto him easily. The archer was perched on a rooftop, dealing with the small bots.
"We just want to talk to him."
Meanwhile, at the Avengers facility, alarms blared. They were loud and angry, fading in and out like tornado sirens. Steve burst into Tony's lab, "The Alarm! Is that...?"
"I see you're in a good mood," Tony said from the doorway. Steve looked up, frowning when he saw that Tony was back in his armor. "I was being sarcastic. Damn. Go back to beating up the sandbag," Tony waved his hand dismissively.
Natasha gave Steve's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "It'll be alright. We'll put him back together. Just like always."
"...Okay."
"No. Steve needs help. Right now," Tony hissed. "I'm not going to waste time trying to fix something that can't be fixed! Every moment we waste is another moment that Steve could be bleeding out. Or worse."
"Uuuuuum. Maybe? I'm gonna power down now." Iron Man's eyes went dark, his arm falling in his lap with a soft ting.
"What's he look like? Do you have any pictures of him on your phone?" Wanda asked.
"Nope. You did."
"I need a minute with him," Steve said to Rhodey and Bucky. "Alone." Tony heard a pair of footsteps exiting the door. There was a minute of silence before Steve spoke again. "Anthony."
Because Steve didn't love him.
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a long moment of silence before Iron Man turned to face him. "I can't show you affection like a human can. You know that."
"Are you sure about this?" Rhodey said from the doorway. Pepper was at his side, looking worried. "Pepper and I think he should spend a few more days recovering before he goes home."
"Don't compare us to them," Tony growled, "you know we would never sink to their level."
Natasha shouldered past the person.
Meanwhile, one of the screens at Tony's desk started flashing with the words "AI Creation Successful".
"What's done is done," Natasha shoved her plate towards the center of the table. She was somehow able to eat half her dinner before she completely lost her appetite. "What we need to do now is focus on helping Tony recover. Sam..." She gave the army counselor a pointed look.
Hey, all!
"Um...how about you don't erase my mind?" Spider-man spoke up. "I have finals next month and I kinda need my brain."
"No injuries, boss." The AI reported.
"I think you're more than capable of leading this team," Tony didn't look up from the Iron Man mask he was working on.
"Well?" Osborn sat back in his chair. Wanda and Bruce sat in the plush chairs opposite his desk. Bruce was turning the vial containing Venom over in his hands, examining it closely. The office was deathly silent, other than the loud ticking of a wall clock.
"Wait. I have a better idea," Bruce said to Wanda.
The Avengers were about to charge him when another wave of Iron Man doppelgangers showed up.
"Scared?"
"No, no, something's wrong," Iron Man's voice was choppy. "Very wrong."
Tiny rockets flipped out from Iron Man's shoulders and launched at his opponent, hitting it square in the chest. The larger robot was thrown off him, the ground shaking when it hit.
"I believe so..." Steve closed the laptop he had been taking notes on. Papers were strewn around the table, and everyone had a tablet or computer in front of them. Except for Peter, who just brought his notebook. Their monthly meetings didn't usually last long, as they were just meant to touch base with each of the members and go over any recent missions. Thor had announced he would be staying with the Avengers for quite awhile, so this meeting had been spent catching Thor up on everything that had happened the last six years. "Anything else to add?" Steve leaned back in his chair, looking around at his teammates. They exchanged looks and shook their heads. "Tony? Did you want to talk about-"
A bit later, Tony found himself at the sight of Obediah's demise. The factory still stood. It was in shambles, and any useable equipment had long been removed, but standing none the less. The room that had housed the arc reactor was nothing by a shell.
Falcon had snatched Spider-man up by the arms and was now flying straight for the Vulture. "I got Big Bird, you get the girl!" Once they were within spitting distance, Falcon flung Peter at the Vulture. Spider-man threw his arms out and grabbed onto Toome's legs. Falcon flew in circles around the Vulture, the two birds of prey battling it out with their wings. Spider-man tore at the exoskeleton on Toome's legs, ignoring the sparks flying in his face. With a loud metal crunch, Spider-man tore the talons from his left boot.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Langauge," Captain America scolded.
Everyone fell silent. The only sound came from the steady hum of Tony's repulsors, propelling him across the skyline.
"Who?"
"It's not over yet," Sam said, "Helicarrier inbound..." he pointed up.
"You have super strength," Iron Man tilted his head.
"Who?"
"You made Ultron based on your own brain, right after going through extreme emotional trauma. Why the fuck do you think he's aggressive?" Bruce spat. Tony flinched. The scientist took a deep breath, "Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. Seriously, Tony, why did you think this would be a good idea?"
Bucky put his arm around Iron Man's shoulders. "There's no harm in showing them. They're just curious."
"Whatever, Iron Man. We are still calling you Iron Man, right? That's what you said to do?"
"Spider-man-"
Peter took a seat on his stool, bouncing both legs. His chest felt like it was going to explode. He took a deep breath, trying to calm down. He wasn't sure what he was nervous about. Henry made a chirping noise, trying to comfort his owner.
"I got a get tarantula last night, but he got out of his box and now I can't find him," he explained, trusting Steve to be on his side.
"I-I-I...I got into the workshop. They're trying to break down the door. Tony, I'm scared!" Pepper's voice shook.
"But now someone has the recipe for a very very dangerous biological weapon," Steve finished for him. He had talked Tony into telling the team about the situation, knowing his partner was way over his head with this one.
"I trusted you!" Tony shouted. He spun in a circle, fists slightly raised and shoulders hunched, acting like a wild animal defending itself. "I trusted all of you! That's why I let you see my goddamn face! Because of fucking trust! I trusted you all and this is what I get in return?! A team that's willing to feed me to the fucking wolves, and spread lies about me to protect their own skins?!" Tony knew in his heart that it was his fault for getting captured. He had run off on his own. And yet...he couldn't help but feel betrayed. If someone else on the team where to get captured, everyone would have dropped what they were doing and conducted a full-fledged rescue mission. So where the hell were they when Tony was being tortured? Where was Steve when Tony was having his eye ripped from his skull? Or all those nights, when Tony lay awake, shivering in the cold and whimpering in pain?
Steve leaned forward on his motorcycle, looking out over the cliff. He and Bucky had gone for a ride along the coast, wanting some time to themselves. They paused at a viewing area on the side of the road. Far below them, waves crashed against the rocky cliffside. "I'm sorry I worried you all so much."
"I thought we took them out because you never used them?"
"Iron Man! Iron Man, come in!" Bucky yelled into his comm. He and Steve raced down several flights of steps. The last thing they heard from the robot was him saying that there was a problem. Then the line went dead. That had been almost twenty minutes ago. Twenty minutes were literally anything could have happened to their friend. They were both starting to panic.
A bright light hit the back of the dragon's neck, spraying blood everywhere. It roared, spinning around to face its attacker.
"I wanted to feel something," Iron Man whispered.
"No, no, god, no. Everyone's just fine. Stevie has a few cuts, but that's it. You can see them in the morning. But you need some rest first." Tony ruffled Peter's hair. Venom might have healed Peter's wounds, but the mental exhaustion brought on by torture was still there. "I'll be right here if you need anything, okay Petey?"
The man shrugged. "For being Spider-man? You've helped a lot of people, kid. Including myself."
Iron Man let out an animal like roar and charged the robot. Steve hung back, knowing he would be crushed if he got in between the two machines. What the larger bot had said must have really angered Iron Man, because his attacks were all over the place. There was not strategizing, no going for weak points. He was letting loose with everything he had, desperately trying to tear the other bot apart.
Tony narrowed his eyes behind the mask, "is that witch still in your head?"
Steve made a move to grab Michelle, but Tony stepped between them. "Wait."
"Yeah, we noticed..." Clint shot an arrow at the wall crawler. It exploded next to his head. Spider-man yelped and let go of Iron Man. He flipped backward and landed in a crouch, angrily hissing at Clint. "Hissing? Seriously, Bug Boy?"
Tony blinked, "it does?"
"Peter. You know where he is. Now go." He shooed the spider away, "go on now. Spider-man is waiting for you."
"I don't know. Click on it."
The Quinjet mentioned earlier wasn't too far from the exit to the stairs. No other Agents were in sight. They could hear gunshots and shouts from somewhere on the other side of the ship.
Fury grunted. The Avengers were shifting around, moving in front of Tony in order to hide him from view. Tony frowned at his teammates, not sure what they were trying to accomplish by doing that. Oh wait. They didn't know that Fury knew about him. They were trying to hide him from the director.
"I-I don't know how, if, um...sir, please don't look at me like that," Norman's assistant shied away from his glare. "We don't know for sure why the symbiote won't bond with you. It must have something to do with Parker's blood-"
"I'm tired," Steve muttered.
"I vote we take the party outside!" Falcon called.
"I don't want to have to keep putting you back together," Steve was using his "no-nonsense Captain America" tone. "I don't want to see you in pain ever again. Next time, I'm going to have your back. I promise." He kissed Iron Man's forehead.
"Stop flailing! I'm trying to help you!" Steve snapped. Tony let himself go limp. Steve's powerful legs kicked under them, gently pushing the two men across the river. Tony was still coughing when Steve and another pair of hands dragged him onto the sandy bank. Someone slapped his back, causing Tony to cough up the remaining water in his lungs. He doubled over in the sand, his entire chest aching as he gulped down fresh oxygen.
Thank you for reading! Let me know if you enjoyed, your comments keep me writing!
"No," Fury shut him down with a cold look. "I suggest you watch yourself, Iron Man. Because I'm about five seconds away from arresting you for murder." That definitely got a response out of the Avengers, who erupted into frantic questions.
Tony lifted his face plate to reveal a frown, "what do you mean?"
But that could never happen.
Unfortunately, he passed out before he was able to do so.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Go back to the cabin. I'll be home for dinner, honey," Iron Man ended the call.
Clint nodded and bopped the tarantula on the head, earning an angry hiss.
"But I'm calling the shots-" Steve started.
"Good lord..." Steve breathed out, looking at Queens through the windshield of the Quinjet. The Hulk had already done a number on midtown, and he was still going. Spider-man landed the Jet atop an office building.
"Looking at us like that," Rhodey said. "We're on your side, asshole."
Wanda's face twisted into a cruel smile. "Birthday, huh? Well, I think I know the perfect gift for our little spider." She moved her hand around, watching the red light swirl between her finger tips.
Something heavy landed next to his head, kicking up a flurry of snow.
"We got your back, Spidey," The person sitting across from the woman gave him a thumbs up.
Peter made a hard turn, speeding up onto the highway. Bruce and Wanda flew out of the side streets, meeting up with the wall crawler on the onramp. Wanda looked up at the sound of Iron Man's repulsors. The metal man was flying right above them.
"I'm not hungry."
"Exactly." Iron Man got to his feet. "He's dead and someone's using his memory to mess with my head." He looked over his shoulders at the computers, most of which had been destroyed in the battle. "Hydra got ahold of my schematics, somehow. I destroyed all their digital records of it. But they could have more hidden somewhere else." Iron Man clenched his fists. "We need to tell Fury."
"Wait!" Iron Man grabbed his sleeve, "I gotta tell you something!"
"No, I need him alive. I don't want to 'get even'. You see, I've been using his body to carry out some scientific exploration for a number of years. I would like to continue my experiments," Bruce explained, his expression calm as ever.
Steve frowned. "Traps?"
"Iron Man?!" Steve said into the headset.
"No. Mr. Stark did. I built all the other ones, though," Iron Man explained. "They're like my children."
Spider-man turned and walked towards Wanda. The witch slipped an arm around his shoulders, saying, "you did good, Peter. I think I'll have you finish him off another time, though..." The two walked off into the smoke.
There was a long silence before Iron Man spoke again.
"Where's your boyfriend?" Bucky asked, leaning over the bar to bat his eyes at Steve.
Pepper smiled, "alright. I'll make you something. For now, you should rest." Tony nodded and let his human eye flutter shut. The metal plates in his right eye socket shifted, spiraling shut over the glowing eyeball. Rhodey slipped the facial prosthetic back onto Tony's head, knowing he would be upset if he woke up without it.
Tony peered up over the hood. A split second later, there was a second explosion and a blinding white light engulfed his vision. He felt himself being thrown back but was only vaguely aware of hitting the ground. He blinked several times, trying to get his vision back. When it did come back, he was met with the smiling face of the Green Goblin. Half of his body had been fried in the explosion. He held a piece of shrapnel in his uninjured hand. Tony scrambled back, looking around wildly for his son. Osborn stomped his boot on Tony's chest before he could get very far. Tony fumbled with his gauntlet, but his eye sight was still blurry and...where there three goblins standing over him? Focus! Tony shook his head and fired a shot. It missed completely and Osborn laughed and held down his arm with his other foot. Tony gasped in discomfort when all of Osborn's weight was put on him. Osborn leaned down, and Tony looked away, not liking the Goblin's face being so close to his own.
"Tony?" War Machine leaned over him. Tony relaxed at the sound of his friend's voice. Wait. Was Rhodey still his friend? He didn't try to save Tony. Why was he here now? Must have stumbled upon him by accident. He should have kept flying. No. No, this was a good thing. Rhodey finding him meant that Tony would have someone at his side when he died. Tony allowed himself a weak smile. Of course, Rhodey was still his friend. Of course, he was going to be with Tony when he died. "Jesus...what happened to you, buddy?" War Machine put a hand on his shoulder. Tony couldn't feel it through the armor but he knew it was there.
"Those...
Elsewhere, Wanda watched from the viewing window in the training hall. She smiled at the chaos far below. War Machine was flying towards Hulk. Before his fists made contact with the giant, Wanda flicked her fingers. Red light grabbed War Machine by the ankle and flung him through a wall.
"That's what Stark told you?" Steve practically growled.
"You're not the least bit worried?" Steve frowned.
"You need to get off my dick."
"Sir, the team is waiting in the conference room," FRIDAY announced.
"And what is our next move, exactly?" Peter practically hissed.
"How do you know?"
"J, make sure Barnes gets this."
"Not to me." Clint flung open the double doors with more force than necessary.
Steve Rogers ambled through the living area of the Avenger's facility. It had been three years since he had last been here, yet not much had changed. His room had been left untouched. The bed still unmade from the last time he had used it, a basket of unfolded laundry in the corner. The rooms belonging to the other rogue Avengers had been left alone as well. Surprisingly, there seemed to be a new Avenger at the compound. They had only spoken to Tony briefly last night before he had disappeared into his work shop, but for whatever reason, the engineer hadn't mentioned anything about a new Avenger. The clues were all there, though. Shoes that obviously didn't belong to Tony were discarded in the living room, and the kitchen was stocked with more food than Tony could ever eat by himself. A college biology book-way below Tony's level-was open on the kitchen table. Happy had mentioned something about picking someone up, however, Tony told him not to worry about it.
Tony jolted awake. He was panting heavily, sweat dripping down his face. Tony wrestled with the blankets tangled around his legs. "J-Jarvis?"
Spider-man hesitating before jumping off the window. He landed on the front steps without a sound.
"Did I?"
I hope you enjoyed! If you did, please let me know, your comments keep me writing!
The enemy Quinjets had no choice but to turn back.
"Oh, sweetheart..." Steve pulled the bot into his arms. Iron Man clung to him with his remaining arm, pressing his face into Steve's shoulder. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." Iron Man's shoulders shook. "Shhh...I got you, shellhead. I got you." Iron Man made a whining noise, followed by a choked clicking. The noise repeated over and over. It took Steve a minute to realize that the sound was the robot's way of crying. Steve felt his heart shatter. "It's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be okay, Iron Man."
"You," Pepper choked out. "Well, not you. People who look like you. They have your armor-" there was a loud bang and scream from Pepper. "They're almost inside-"
"Either you shut it down, or I will," Steve snarled.
"Dude, it's been almost two months. We thought you were dead," Michelle scooted the swivel chair closer to the bed where Peter and Ned sat. Peter had shown up at Ned's house around midnight, with no explanation other than he needed a place to stay. Ned had texted Michelle right after. She had to sneak in through the fire escape because Ned's parents were asleep.
"Very well," Adrian released the talons around Spider-man's leg. The arachnid responded by crawling around and attaching himself to Adrian's back. "Looks like the kid wants to stay with me."
"Stevie, you should draw me next," Bucky suggested, tapping Steve's sketchbook.
Tony cursed and ended the call.
"I killed people in order to escape Afghanistan," Iron Man reminded him, not seeing the problem.
"I didn't hurt my son," Tony said for the tenth time in the past hour.
"Peter'ssss gone," Venom's voice was like gravel.
The woman turned back around and Robert and Peter went back to chatting among themselves. Thankfully, Robert had decided to change the subject to sports, much to Peter's relief. They continued chatting long after they finished their meals. The parted ways later that morning, and Peter returned to his apartment.
Tony leaned over and manually ended the recording he had just made. He played the message over, making sure he had said everything he wanted to. He hated the way his voice cracked at the end of it, but he didn't have time to re-record.
"Well? What are we waiting for? Call Osborn back and let him know we have it," Steve handed over Tony's phone.
As soon as Peter was out of the room, Tony started putting on his armor. "I don't know about you all, but I think it's time I paid Oscorp a visit."
"I haven't
"What?!" Peter covered the screen with one hand.
"There! That thing's taken him!" Clint cried, pointing up at the sky. They could just barely make out the silhouette of the dragon, with a person in its claws. The dragon was already miles away, heading in the direction of the mountain range.
I hope you enjoyed this extra long chapter! And thank you for reading! :)
"Whatever," Iron Man waved his hand dismissively.
"Karen said FRIDAY went offline, what happened? Are you okay?" Spider-man looked up as Tony made his way over to them. The split second of distraction was just enough for Osborn to punch Spider-man in the jaw, knocking him to the ground.
"Did he make them for you or did you steal them when he wasn't looking?" Tony put his welding torch down and turned his entire body to face Peter.
"When is the time, then?! Tell them who you really are!"
"Oooooh," Clint was sitting backward on the couch, chin resting on the back. An all too familiar sly smile on his face.
"He's right, though. How do we know that we can trust one another?" Natasha hugged her knees. "Two Avengers went rogue, I wouldn't be surprised if someone else-"
"We all did," Clint muttered.
"You've seen his face?" Steve looked over at his friend.
"That's Dumm-E. He's saying hello. He's an idiot, but he's friendly. Don't mind him," Iron Man pat Dumm-E's arm as he walked past.
Iron Man took the drawing over to his desk and taped it to the side of one of the monitors. "Jarvis, I'd like to open a new project file. Titled 'Reset'."
It was around six am when Spider-man took a break, sitting down on the sidewalk with his feet in the gutter. He was exhausted and didn't care that he was resting at street level. Peter hadn't brought his phone with him, but he could picture the countless worried texts Michelle and Ned were sending him.
"Sorry, I still have your name set to 'James Franco' and I forgot who that was," Peter chuckled.
"Anthony can't go without his reactor for more than an hour," Bucky whispered.
Tony looked over at his suit. It was pretty beat up, but fully functional. Especially now that his damaged arc reactor had been replaced.
"Too bad. He's my prey." Kraven crossed his arms.
"Go for it," Bucky forced himself to relax. Taking his arm off caused a short burst of pain in the connectors. Bucky tried to convince himself it was like getting a shot. Just a quick prick, and then it's all over. Tony waited until Bucky was completely relaxed before releasing the prosthetic. "Thank you," Bucky said once the issue was resolved and the arm was back in its place.
"I'm not worried. I'm just questioning your parenting methods."
"I'm all ears."
"Bad..." Tony choked out. Peter tried to say something but it came out muffled. Tony reached for Peter's mask only for the teen to grab the fabric and hold it tightly in place. After playing tug of war with the mask for a solid minute, Tony successfully yanked it off.
"Spider-man."
Natasha gladly accepted the mug. "Hot chocolate with extra marshmallows? Oh, Cap, you know me so well."
"Don't push it, kid. I could snap your neck."
"Okay," Iron Man let his hands drop down to his chest.
Tony's eyes lit up, and he instantly dropped everything he was doing. "Of course! Step into my parlor!" He kicked an extra stool over to the workbench. Bucky sat down with his arm outstretched on the table. Tony was silent as his cybernetic eye scanned the arm.
Steve lounged in a chair on the balcony, deep in thought. The sun had set a while ago, and the cool night air ruffled Steve's short hair. Steve was out here in an attempt to calm his nerves. But the silence just guided his thoughts back to the events of today. Steve pinched the bridge of his nose when he thought about the absolute mess they had all found themselves in. Pepper assured him that everything would work out, and Steve wanted to believe that, but he still had his doubts. He pushed his concerns to the back of his mind and tried to relax. But the soldier found himself unable to do so. His mind once again wandered to the memory of Iron Man writhing in pain, with the electrified rope cutting through his throat. Iron Man's agonized scream echoed in his head. Steve shuddered.
"Stark! Don't leave the Hulk! Sam can take care of Spider-man!" Steve snapped. He and War Machine still had their hands full with Doc Ock.
"Oh. You again."
"I need the boy."
Steve eased Peter's hands away from his face and used a pocket knife to cut the thread from his lips. "Who did this to you, son?"
"Whoa, what's going on in here?" Tony poked his head into Steve's office.
"don't change the subject."
Steve nodded. "I'll see if the others are awake."
"I don't trust Bruce," Peter pulled away from the scientist.
Peter twisted his body as he followed the older man's movements. "No..."
"Sorry, I'm out too." Sam raised his hands then let them drop against his thighs. "I don't know what's going on in Stark's head. But it ain't right. I don't trust that guy."
Bucky cut in right them.
This was not well received by Ultron. "I was created to help the Avengers. Help the world." It sped through more information, taking in every single drop of knowledge available to it. "I must fulfill my purpose."
Thor looked at him in confusion.
"MJ! Help me!" Peter thrashed, struggling to free himself from Clint's death grip. Michelle stepped over them and made a bee line for the kitchen. Peter eventually squirmed away. He didn't make it much further into the room before he was stopped by his father.
Tony was about to ask for alcohol, but Steve spoke first, "we're good, thank you. Our priority is Peter."
"I don't know. You ask about Clint's kids all the time."
"What?"
"Sit your ass back down, you aren't going anywhere," Natasha snapped.
"There's nothing more we can do right now, Stark." Nick Fury leaned back in his chair. Tony sat across from him, his helmet placed on the desk between them, its eyes pointed at Fury. Of course, Fury knew who was behind the iron mask. Nothing got past that man.
Thor placed his hammer on Peter's chest. "Stay down, young one. We mean you no ill will."
"What's this one's name?" Steve asked, looking over at Peter, who was sitting next to his wife.
"Widow. Falcon. Vision. Go find Wanda. Hawk Eye, War Machine, you guys take Bruce to the interrogation room." Steve ordered, his voice calm, even though he was losing his shit on the inside.
"What else can I do to help?"
I hope you enjoyed this long mostly fluffy chapter. There will be plenty more shenanigans in the next chapter, now that we have Clint, Thor, and Peter in the same room.
Steve smiled back, enjoying every smile Peter made. He ruffled Peter's hair, "did you know your father and Tony used to date?"
"Kid. Get out of the car."
A younger man, donning a black and red version of Peter's costume sailed past the roof on a web strand. They both waved at each other as he passed by.
"Spidey! Let's go!" Wanda called from the ship.
Tony slapped a hand over his face, groaning loudly, "you were supposed to keep an eye on him! What part of 'don't let Peter leave the compound' don't you understand?!"
"Unnecessary," Iron Man shook his head.
." Iron Man ripped the now useless ropes off his body. Steve winced at the deep cuts they had left in his armor.
"GET DOWN!" Steve threw himself over Natasha and held up his shield. One by one, the Iron Man suits blew up.
"I want you to suffer just as much as they will. So we'll take this slow. Some spikes in your spider sense whenever you're around the Avengers. Here and there. Some small. Others not so much. Slowly driving you to madness. Until you have no choice but to kill your teammates." He pats Spider-man on the head. The web-slinger was starting to slip into unconsciousness, his eyes fluttering shut. "And I'll be right there with you, the entire time."
"Long story. Thanks for the save, Shellhead." Steve smiled up at him.
Iron Man's body moved in jerky motions as he got his feet. Sparks sprayed from the cracked eyepiece in his helmet.
"That's the point," Maria hill stepped forward, gun pointed at Iron Man's head. The bullet wouldn't do any damage, but she still felt compelled to point some form of weapon at the robot.
"You want to see aggressive?!" Iron Man snarled. "I'll show you aggressive!" He ripped apart a bot's chest with his hands. The next second he was blasting up to Obadiah.
Peter leaned against the wall, "so, what brings you to the telephone?"
"I know," Bucky chuckled. "Kinda hard to have a heart to heart with someone who doesn't have one." Tony flinched at his word choice. Bucky didn't notice and went on, "I'm not very good with feelings anyway." He stood up and stretched. He swung his metal around in a big circle, loosening up the shoulder joint. "Can I ask you something, though?"
Steve was screaming, but Tony couldn't make out what he was saying over the crackle of the rope. Tony lashed out, blinding slicing one of his lasers through the air. He must have met his target because the rope loosened just enough for him to shoot back into the sky.
"Stay down. We got this-ARGH!" A tentacle grabbed Iron Man by the leg and flung him into the bar. The arc reactor flickered.
"ANTHONY!!" The scream ripped through Steve's throat with so much force that it hurt.
That was the one rule they all agreed on when they moved in together.
A few blocks down, in the middle of the street, Wanda stood, hands waving with red light.
After several very long hours of panicking, Tony was able to calm down enough to slip back into his armor. He didn't want to be alone right now. And so, he left his secret workshop to go find the one person who never failed to make him feel better.
"No, no." Wanda wrapped an arm around Peter's shoulders, "you poor thing, you really don't remember anything, do you? That damn Stark..."
"You did that on purpose."
You have no idea how tempting it was to have Pepper say "it's dangerous to go alone! Take this!"
"I had to help Clint with his hair. He's a mess. And so are you, Rogers. Stay where you are, I'm going to fix your hair next." Natasha then said to Peter, "breath, little spider."
"You don't need to leave," Steve said. "The team still needs you."
"Out." Peter ducked under his arm and ran off. He didn't like Ock. That man honestly made him uncomfortable. Wanda had said Otto was his friend, but the teen found that extremely hard to believe. He tugged his mask over his face and swiped a coat from the closet before hurrying up the stairs.
“I have everything to prove,” Tony shook his head. The two had been going back and forth about this for the better part of an hour. “I betrayed all of you. Hurt all of you. I have to prove that you can trust me-“
"Anyway, is everyone else alright? The tower's all over the news. Someone got some grainy footage of the last missile." Rhodes said.
"FRIDAY wasn't kidding about the rain...that's one hell of a storm," Natasha commented as she sipped her wine. "Are we sure Thor isn't visiting the compound?"
"Bossy, bossy." Iron Man scoffed. "Lay me down, you're hurting my neck."
"That's not what happened," Tony's voice was muffled by his hands.
There was another long silence, in which Peter scooted closer to his father, and Tony wrapped an arm around him. Tony planted a kiss on top of Peter's head. Peter muttered something that sounded like "gross", and Tony laughed. They both had a lot of healing to do after everything that had happened. But Tony knew that in the end, everything would be alright. Peter wouldn't have to keep looking over his shoulder anymore, and Tony could sleep soundly without waiting for the panic alarm to blare at any moment. Of course, there was no guarantee that Spider-man wouldn't face worse enemies in the future. No guarantee that Peter would be able to keep close to the ground, watching out for the little guy. Because he was only twenty, and still had a lot of superhero-ing to do. And he was still an Avenger. And one day he would have to face horrible monsters once again. But for now, Peter was safe. And he could go back to being the friendly neighborhood Spider-man, whose greatest enemy was an elderly man in a bird costume. And Peter Parker, whose biggest concern was getting his homework done on time.
"I thought so too," Tony muttered. He refused to turn around. He knew the team was angry with him and couldn't bring himself to face them. Hell, he was angry with himself for fucking up again. He had made Ultron to help his teammates. But it turned around and tried to kill them. Steve had been
"That's enough!"
"I mean...look, this isn't my time. Not my
After what felt like hours, but was only seconds, War Machine burst out of the water. With Iron Man cradled in his arms. Steve let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding. Natasha followed War Machine as he flew across the ocean. More missiles were fired, but he managed to avoid all of them. The other Quinjets were getting dangerously close. Natasha was able to match his speed and lowered the jet down to his level. War Machine and the two airborne avengers darted into the back of the aircraft. As soon as the door closed, Natasha activated stealth mode.
shouldn't I?" He spat Steve's own words back at him, causing the soldier to flinch.
Tony remained perfectly still. Happy moved forward, trying to subdue the crowd.
"I can alter it to accept your biology. Shouldn't be too difficult. But I want something in return." Bruce set the vial down and looked up at Osborn.
"Good question." The man shrugged.
"Right here," Osborn pointed to a bulky folder that lay on his desk. "I learned what I could from it. And now you may have it back."
"And robots take things too literally," Steve shot back, a playful smile on his lips. "Anyway. This Obediah, I've heard of him. He used to work for SI, didn't he?"
"What's going on?" Bruce appeared in the doorway.
Tony tilted his head at the child, holding her close to his chest. He was going to protect this girl. Keep her safe from all the evil in this world. He might have failed Peter, but he would not fail May. She was going to grow up happy, and not a single person was going to lay a finger on her. May giggled, and Tony's heart melted. "She's perfect."
Thank you for reading, and as always, leave a comment if you enjoyed! :D
Clint held up his hands, "sorry, bro. Are...are you okay? You're breathing kinda funny-PETER!!!" The archer lunged forward when Spidey suddenly went limp, falling from the ceiling. Steve, Tony, and Sam came running when they heard Clint scream. They found him holding an unconscious Spider-man in his arms. Strangled gasps escaped the web slinger's throat. Clint tore off his mask and tilted his head back, a desperate attempt to get more air into his lungs.
Fuck you, Steve. Fuck. You.
Iron Man stared at him for a long moment. His blue eyes seemed to bore into Steve's soul. "I do. Fairly often, actually." He lowered his gaze again and picked up a screwdriver.
"He might not have been the nicest person in the world, but he was the only family I had, Parker."
you are!" Iron Man shouted. "Has anyone told you that you have a nice butt? Cause you have a nice butt. Can I touch it?"
"Who?" Steve frowned.
"I would. If you hadn't fried him to hell and back. The poor kid can barely form a logical sentence!" Fury answered. "The only thing he's said that's made sense is 'I want to see my family'. That's it. The rest is just garbled nonsense."
Steve cleared his throat, doing his best to ignore the archer being attacked by a massive spider. "So...what movie are we watching?"
Spider-man came out of nowhere and threw his entire body against Osborn, forcing him off from Tony. He had put a bit too much force in the shove, which ultimately led to Osborn falling off the edge of the parking garage. "NO!" Spider-man shot a web at the goblin. He hated Osborn with his guts, but he didn't want the man to die. Peter didn't want anyone to d-
"Is everyone else safe?" Tony whispered.
"My name is Doctor Otto Octavius, and you shall address me as such," the man snarled.
"Natasha sent me to get you. C'mon Tony, It's time for training."
The Wall Crawler and the Goblin clashed without mercy. Iron Man hung back at first, simply watching as the two men battled above the city. He didn't get involved until they crashed into the top level of a parking garage. The duo quickly recovered from the initial shock of hitting the pavement and flipped back onto their feet. Green Goblin darted forward, while Spider-man took an offensive stance, knelt down with one fist behind him and one wrist bared and ready to fire a web. Iron Man swooped in and knocked the Goblin to the ground. Osborn's glider restarted itself and tried to impale Iron Man in the back. The glider pierced the outer layer of the armor but didn't get much further. Tony merely grunted and tossed the offending object to the side. Meanwhile, Osborn was taking a pumpkin bomb out of his satchel. Spider-man webbed it to his hand before he could throw it.
"How come we're just now hearing about you? I thought Iron Man was one of a kind," Bruce leaned towards the screen, taking in every detail of the new bot.
Spider-man huddled against the wall of an apartment building, his lenses zoomed in on a window at the other end of the block. The communicator in his ear crackled. He had gone out web slinging as soon as he was off the clock, completely forgetting about his plans to visit the Avengers.
Tony Stark.
"No, I'm fine, I need to-"
Iron Man took one last look at the pile of rubble that had once been their home before flying after the Quinjet. The ramp lowered, allowing Iron Man to fly inside. He set Steve down and punched a button on the wall, closing the ramp.
"Is that a good idea?"
"Oh. Well, that makes sense. I was worried my old man chased you off," Harry chuckled.
"Osborn doesn't have the Venom, though," Rhodey reminded his friend. "Peter's in no more danger than any other night he goes out on patrol."
Peter snarled.
"Peter told me everything," Tony snarled. All eyes turned to the teen in question.
"Iron Man at a bowling alley?" Tony laughed. "That'll be an image for the papers."
"Sorry about that, Capsickle. Today's been a little traumatizing. But I think I'm good now." He grabbed Peter from behind, looping his large metal arms around the teen's small frame. Venom snarled in frustration. He thrashed in Tony's arms, his own arms were trapped at his sides. The armor whirred but didn't let up.
"Why are you acting like such a child today?" Steve put his hands on his hips, frowning down at the bot, who was still kneeling on the floor.
"Yeah, hasn't really been any major world ending threats to take care of recently. Which I suppose is a good thing. Although I feel kinda cheated. I was hoping I could punch an alien or two if I joined the Avengers." Peter grinned even though the older man couldn't see it.
"I wish to help Stark," Thor declared. Bruce's eyebrows shot up, having not expected that. "As disappointed in our robot-"
Peter set his food down, covering it with a napkin to keep himself from vomiting. SHIELD had done a pretty good job of keeping the whole ordeal under wraps. The public knew that Scarlet Witch and the Hulk had gone rogue. They also knew about the battle at Midtown High. But that was it. No one knew the reasoning.
Thank you for reading, and as always, let me know if you enjoyed! Your comments keep me writing! :)
Peter swallowed hard. He vaguely remembered that happening. But at the time he was so wrapped up in grief over the phone call about his aunt that he hadn't been paying attention to the news.
"I hate sitting around. Feel so useless..." Tony ripped the paper off his lunch and took a large bite.
Wanda and Bruce were completely oblivious to what was going on behind them. Peter pressed the button again, trying to switch it off. The button kept flashing no matter what he did.
"What?" Tony frowned. Even in the dim light, he could make out the worry on the other man's face. God, he hated it. He didn't need anyone's pity. Definitely not Steve's.
"Right, sorry." Bruce pulled back. For some reason, Peter had been really jumpy around the entire team. He trusted Tony, that much was clear. However, he lashed out at anyone else who got near him. Bruce was just thankful the kid had been unconscious long enough to clean up his wounds.
“Hey, Tones, Sam and I are heading out to lunch. Thinking about going to the park afterward,” Bucky loudly announced, “you coming or not?”
"STARK. Put your hands back on the wheel, right this instant!"
"We took a vote. When Cap and Iron Man stepped down. They chose me." Spider-man shrugged.
"What for?"
"You fixed the suit?" Peter stood up and stretched.
The lights flickered as Bruce Banner made his way down the long hallway. It was raining outside, but no sound penetrated the thick walls of the maximum security prison. None of the guards paid him any mind as he walked by. He wore their uniform in order to avoid suspicion. Stole from some poor fellow who had been on his dinner break. Someone named 'Mark' according to the name tag. Bruce kept his head down. His cap cast a dark shadow on his face.
"Yup. And he's not a kid anymore. Turned twenty-one recently."
"You talk about me being human a lot," Iron Man pointed out. "And you draw me as a human a lot..."
"I'm not a murderer!" Tony shouted over the rain. Agents were pouring onto the top deck, this time with weapons capable of matching Iron Man's. An electrified whip circled around his neck, yanking him to the ground. The rope ate through the top layer of his armor. Iron Man fought to stand up, but didn't get very far before a second whip wrapped around his upper body and force him to his knees. The HUD flashed red. Part of the rope managed to slice right through the bicep of the armor, burning Tony's arm and causing him to cry out.
Tony bristled, "I'm not asking for your permission, Rogers."
"I don't know what to believe anymore," Spider-man looked down at his feet.
It was just Steve. With Chinese take out.
After the final goodbyes, Peter got into his car and drove off.
"I'm fine, Steve," Iron Man's eyes flashed. Steve frowned and tapped his knuckles on the side of the helmet. Tony didn't seem to get the message, so he did it again. "What?"
"Not to worry," they reached out and cupped Peter's face, causing him to flinch. "In time you will see things my way. Together we will build a new team. A stronger one."
A huge smile spread across Bruce's face, "it worked!" He nudged Peter to his feet, "we need to tell Wanda. She's want to move onto the next part of our plan."
"Think you could give me a hand, cap?" Iron Man's undamaged eye flicked back on. He wiggled what was left of his arm.
"How's my face?" Tony put his hands on his chin. "God, my beard probably looks awful. You got a razor I could borrow?" He ran his hands along his jaw. "Feels awful. Damn, I didn't know it could get this long."
"I can speak for myself, thank you," Steve shot his friend a look.
Henry pushed the remaining chips into the mask. He then took one out and put it back in. He repeated the process several times, hoping the two humans would get the message. Tony's eyes suddenly lit up. "Peter wasn't gassed. The Goblin put a microchip in his head!"
"You're very right. But why would Hydra want to kill Stark's enemies? Most of these people were known Hydra sympathizers. Howard Stark was on Hydra's hit list, and I imagine his son was too. Also," Fury nodded to Maria Hill, who took a small object out of her pocket. She reached over Iron Man's shoulder in order to set it on the table before him. It was some sort of computer chip connected to frayed wires. "You removed your tracker. Threw it in the ocean. When was that exactly?"
? Fuck their lessons. Fuck the Avengers. Fuck them and everything they stood for.
Henry chirped again, this time louder.
Peter smiled at the photo, absent mindedly scratching the scar on his left arm. He looked down at his forearms when he realized what he was doing. A thin scar ran from the palm of his hand all the way up to the inside of his elbow. One on each arm. He had talked to Tony about possibly removing the web spinners, but Tony was afraid they could badly damage his arms in the process. So Peter had learned to live with it. He rarely used the organic webs, opting for his classic web shooters. The organic webs were only used as an absolute last resort.
"Will do," Spider-man's lenses narrowed.
"I understand what you're saying, Octavius. But we can't attack their facility again. We won't have the element of surprise if we do that." Adrian said. Several people around him nodded and whispered their agreement.
"It's already messing with my head!" At this point, Peter was in panic mode. "Is it gonna take away my memories?!" He didn't want to forget. Not again. Peter tugged at his mask, but the black goo wouldn't budge.
"Peter will attack if I do. Toomes is flying too far up, I don't want to risk anything." Tony shuddered, recalling just how close Peter had been to splattering on the pavement minutes earlier.
"I found something bigger." Rhodey sounded smug. Bucky didn't like that.
Peter forced his eyes to look at the hunter. He willed himself to say something, but his tongue betrayed him. More spit seeped from the corners of his mouth.
Steve's face went bright red and he stumbled over his words, "m-maybe don't tell him like
Natasha sucked in a sharp breath, putting two and two together. She looked over at Bucky, asking a silent question.
"Wanda knows where the compound is. She could attack at any minute. This," Peter pointed at the schematics, "is getting done by morning. You don't have to stay and help the whole time. I can do this," he quickly added.
"W-wha' are...y...you d-doin'?" Peter was barely conscious. The burning smell was still stuck in his nose. He really hoped it was the grass.
"Holy
"Yeah, we're not quite...there yet," Tony pat Peter on the shoulder. "He calls me Stark when he's pissed at me. Which happens a lot. So today's a good day if he's calling me Tony."
"I'm going to rip you limb from limb. I'll leave your head in one piece, though. So you can watch me kill your precious Avengers. Let you watch as I bash their skulls in."
"They're probably still doing it if you want to find out," Sam jabbed a thumb over his shoulder.
It didn't take long for him to be spotted by the Iron Man knockoffs.
"I am calm!!" Bruce yelled.
Spider-man started to run after him. He didn't get very far before Steve grabbed him by the wrist, "that's enough, Peter."
"Don't worry, Stevie, we're not judging! We just didn't expect it, is all," Bucky put his arm around Steve's shoulders, pulling both the archer and his oldest friend close.
"I know so. It'll work out. I wouldn't have invited you to join if it wouldn't." Spidey smiled at his friend. Deadpool pushed up his own mask and smiled back.
"My calculations show that Captain Rogers is capable of punching through the armor if he so chooses-"
"Of course not, you twats." Osborn's expression darkened for a minute, then it softened and his smile returned. "But why make one from scratch when there's a perfectly good one lying around somewhere?"
Tony made a few sarcastic comments here and there, but otherwise, let Peter figure out things himself. "I'm for the 'throw the kid in the pool' style of teaching," He had said when Peter asked him if he was doing it right, "if you don't drown, then you're probably doing it right."
"Like I said, I don't care. There's more to love than just sexual attraction. And I'm not attracted to you like that anyway. I love you for you. And I'm content with just being at your side." Steve lowered his gaze and traced his index finger over the lines on Iron Man's palm.
"Obadiah took him. He took everyone," Pepper looked like she was about to cry. "He paralyzed us with something. And his bots took the Avengers. They got Bruce too. Before he could Hulk out."
The strange man cursed under his breath. Whatever his goal was, it seemed as though he was not able to achieve it. As evident by how he was quickly retreating out the broken window.
"Okay, okay, but what about him?" Sam jerked his thumb at a shorter man dancing with a group of friends.
He had always liked the place. It was far enough away from the city centre to not be too crowded, but close enough to have a constant stream of people going in and out. When he was younger, he spent most of his nights there, hooking up with whoever and whatever. Humans were always the easiest, Tony using his powers to charm them into sleeping with a demon. Other creatures, not so much. They could always sense his dark aura and give him a wide berth, which was fine by him. Tony would take a regular, old human over a werewolf or a witch any day.
They’re talking, and Tony feels like it’s as if nothing has changed between them.
Next to Wilson was Thor Odinson, who the entire police department was sure was a real life Viking, if his blue eyes, blond hair, and great height were anything to go by. Despite being a giant of a man, he was a real softie at heart. Everyone had a crush on him, but none more so than Bruce, the police’s resident forensic scientist. (In fact, Thor was very obviously trying to pretend that he wasn’t staring at said scientist, who was taking his seat next to Tony.)
“To make sure evil doesn’t get out of hand.” Steve said, voice soft. “You couldn’t know either. Hell would literally break loose if demons knew that angels were watching them.”
Tony scoffed. He knew that this perfect moment would come to an end. “So we’re screwed then.”
Steve bent down, enveloping Tony in the warmth of his large body. Steve was nuzzling against the back of Tony's neck, pressing kisses to the sensitive skin. “No going back after this.”
Steve follows soon afterward, coming with a groan inside Tony. He knows it’ll be a pain to clean up, but he doesn’t care. It’s worth it.
After pressing a comforting kiss to the top of Steve's head, Tony shifted until he was close to the man's neck, close enough to hear his pulse beating fast and strong.
They aren’t enough to say “Don’t you dare leave again.”
Bruce shook his head, while Clint said from his desk, “Looks like someone has a secret admirer.”
Now, it was Tony’s turn to take deep breaths, because there was Steve, standing right in front of him, gorgeous, perfect, and completely naked. Tony couldn’t help but look down, stealing a quick glance at Steve’s very hard, very large, and very erect cock.
Tony actually had his own stall where he sold metal jewellery and figurines that he made himself in his free time, back home in his workshop. During one of his breaks, Rhodey took over manning the stall, allowing Tony to do a little window shopping of his own.
As for Tony? Steve doesn’t feel right asking, but he’s sure that Peggy and Tony have talked about him, sure that Peggy more than understands Tony, sure that she wouldn’t tell him all those things knowing that he was bound to fail. Not only that, but during Tony’s funeral, Pepper had personally asked him to join her, to listen to Tony’s final recording. He declined at first, knowing that he would feel out of place, but Pepper insisted. When he asked her why, all she said was, “He would want you to be there.”
Steve chokes on air, coughing as he tries to process what Tony just said, especially after what he’d just been thinking about. “What are you – I – What?”
Tony’s vision went white, almost blacking out from what had to be the most intense orgasm of his entire existence, wave after wave of pure pleasure surging through his being. He knew Steve was watching him. He, a vampire, had just been completely undone and fucked within an inch of his life by a werewolf, and he knew Steve would be revelling in it.
Natasha and Clint explained that they were orphans of the war. Clint was a street urchin, whose family life was nonexistent. He said he vaguely remembered having a family once but it was too long ago to leave a lasting memory. Meanwhile Natasha was a product of the war. Her father had been an enemy soldier. She vaguely remembers being brought over to Thebes in order to help with a mission of some sort. However she was young, and inexperienced. Needless to say she failed and was left behind for her failure. Thebes citizens didn’t take kindly to an enemy in their midst, even that of a child, and so the streets became her home as well. They found each other and then began this mercenary business as soon as they were able to.
Sorry for the late update. I got back from my work conference late Thursday and didn't have enough time to do a final read thru till tonight.
Loki shrugged with fake casualness. “Fenrir has been whining excessively and even Jörmungandr seems upset. Which is baffling because I know he’s not overly fond of you. Yet he appears less energized than normal.” Loki explained, again trying to sound convincing but Tony could see through it. A small smile graced Tony’s face as Loki waved his hand dismissively. “But I guess your scent or something is gone and so they are if not upset then not fond of the absence. So,” Loki finally stood up and walked to stand in front of Tony. “I am here to-”
“I hope the others had more luck.” Bruce muttered worriedly.
“Finally!” The ogre boomed happily and gave the female shade a smile. “Thank you Pepper! You are truly too good for this realm. ”
Steve eventually took them to the skylight room where he laid Tony on the couch and Tony yanked the blonde on top of him. They proceeded to make out and both of their groins indicated they greatly enjoyed it. They were rutting against each other when Tony broke the kiss to moan. Steve then attacked the brunette’s neck. Tony grabbed the fabric on Steve’s back and bunched it in his hands.
He was accustomed to shades honesty and openness to him. Living people were much different and Tony found he didn’t like it, didn’t trust it. Then he had seen the billboard.
Natasha had fallen after Fenrir dodged her sword attack. Normally she’d be able to quickly brush a fall off and go back at it, but now getting her bearings and herself back into a fighting stance was taking forever.
“Indeed.” Erskine agreed with a smile. He then got up and gestured for Steve to follow him. “Tomorrow I will join you for your training.”
Rhodes looked at the scared boy again then turned fully to face Loki.
“Steve,” Bruce hedged but Steve gave him a look and the smaller man stopped.
“It really wasn’t.” Sam chimed in and Bucky immediately turned his ire onto him.
“Your freedom.”
“Yeah Rhodey-bear is like a father to me.” Tony said wistfully, giving an over dramatic look to the man.
He thought then turned back to the Avengers.
“If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” Natasha mused glaring at a random passerby who took too long to move past them.
“Do we need to talk about this again?” The centaur asked, his tone dead serious.
Tony looked aghast at this suggestion, but Phil only nodded in the affirmative. “Correct. So you’re all headed to Crete to-”
Tony kept being pulled away from Steve and their friends by work and social obligations. The paparazzi printed article after article about Tony and his “lovers”. None of which were actually true, but Tony wanted to keep Steve out of the spotlight he grew up in, so their relationship was a secret from the world. PDA was restricted and only their friends knew the truth. Steve tried not to let the bullshit articles get to him but sometimes a particular picture of Tony with his arm around someone would make something inside him tick. He didn’t tell Tony, but he was starting to resent that Tony wanted their relationship secret. He told Bucky, who actually defend the genius’s secrecy plan, but that only proved to wrangle Steve up more. Unable to confront Tony about his problem with their secret relationship the anger and jealousy festered.
“They’re trying to fight Jörmungandr?! They’ll never win! He’s impervious to all weapons!”
“Which is why Maria is always so angry at him.”
Tony rolled his eyes and tried to pull his other hand free but Steve held fast.
Upon returning home, they discovered Loki was over and him and Thor were having one of their better days as they were both lounging and feeding each other fruit. Clint had shared his discovery with Thor, who looked excited at Tony and asked to see some of his moves.
“No man.” Sam cut in “We’ve been talking you up.” Clint nodded eagerly in agreement with Sam. “But we can’t always do that.”
Tony shrugged his shoulders and turned towards the door leading to his personal chambers, stripping off the furs as he went.
Tony finally looked up and locked eyes with the blonde, both men had tears in their eyes. “I had to I-”
Maria Stark was rarely in her home. She often traveled, going to all the orphanages nearby and spending time with the children there. She raised money for them and would help children get adopted. When not helping out at the orphanages, she would travel to the major temples and pray. She had never gotten over the loss of her son, and it was obvious to everyone that she at least partially blamed Howard for his demise. On the rare occasions she was home she always had a drink in her hand, and her company was icey.
” Loki screamed and ice shot out in all directions as he grabbed the ritual table and upended it.
Tony gave an exaggerated gasp, “Rhodey-bear I can’t believe you would lie like that! What about that time I had to go to the Land of the Living to get you, because you were taking so long with your vacation. Huh? What about that?”
“What are you planning?!” Bucky demanded.
“-Betty and I rekindled-”
Thor worried his lip then looked back towards the Mist behind them.
After their date, Steve hadn’t heard from Tony again. The brunette hadn’t come over and when Steve went to his place he received no answer. Eventually Steve left, thinking the man just needed some space. And now, the next day it was late in the afternoon and the blonde still hadn’t heard anything from the brunette.
“He’s a child, what do you expect.” Rhodey shrugged.
“Oh gods.” Sam muttered then threw a quick pray to the goddess Sif. They may need to be prepared for an actual battle afterall.
The next day the fashion show arrived and everyone was there to cheer on Jan. At the end of the show Jan came out to a round of applause and all their friends immediately gave her a standing ovation. The crowd was then hushed as Hank came up on stage and proposed to Jan. Jan squealed yes and the cameras began swarming the runway more than they had previously.
“You’ll risk the wrath of another god?!” Tony shouted over the sound of drawn steel.
“They should have gone to my temple NOT my home!”
“Would you stop….teleporting...me….” Tony yelled as he charged through the side door but then his rant and volume dwindled as he took stock of everything and everyone in the Throne Room.
Tony thought and let out a small smile at the thought.
Then a scream of rage broke through the air. Ty had finally righted himself and turned to take up a charging stance. Steve quickly ran to his friends and set Tony down near the men.
“It’s a fine statue.” Thor said appraisingly as he circled it. “Better than the real thing. Less Weasley, less greasy…” Thor stared intently at the statues face but nothing happened. No shimmer of magic, no sign of disturbance or hidden magic.
“A year! It’s been over a YEAR!” Loki raged as he paced in his throne room. Icicles growing larger with each frustrated step he took.
“You!” Loki jabbed a finger at the mortals. “You walk into my realm! Into my Home! How?!”
During his walk a caravan of soldiers were let into the city and the injured were all being transported to the medical houses. Howard watched all the soldiers pass. All the people putting their life on the line for their country, for their very way of life to survive, and came to a decision.
“Tony, we owe you an apology.” Natasha said, gathering everyone’s attention. “We threatened you when we shouldn’t have.”
2. Amora is the character I wanted to introduce in chap 4. I couldn’t fit her in seamlessly then but now I think it works. And yes she’s always been a bitch to Tony. He’s an easy target to take her anger out on. He’s close to Loki and so she takes her anger about thorki out on him since she can’t touch Loki or Thor.
“I’ve been trying to get them to help,” Tony stepped out of Steve’s space and threw an accusatory arm back to the 3 guards. “But they won’t listen to me.”
Fenrir yipped and was shifting sizes at a rapid pace. Once Tony had stopped running and planted himself between the two parties, Fenrir grew to an enormous size.
“Wow.” Steve let out silently but Tony caught it and locked eyes with him. Steve blushed then rapidly gestured to the sky light. “The view, it’s…wow!” Tony snickered, as did Sam and Clint.
“Sorry about him.” Steve apologized giving Tony a smile meant to comfort.
“That’s low.” He muttered.
“Children are rambunctious. If you don’t let them get their energy out. They’ll find a way to get it out.” Jarvis explained as he looked at all the damage. “Anthony, it seems you have quite a bit of energy stored up.”
4. And yes Loki did all that research in order to find a way to earn Tony his freedom. He hid it all in his chambers because A) In order to research without constantly being hovered over and B) Protect Tony, so Tony wouldn’t get his hopes up or go crazy with research (it did take Loki about 9ish yrs to figure out).
“I will pour it into your mouth, try to swallow quickly.” Erskine advised from his seat at Steve’s head.
“All night?” Clint asked skeptically.
Curiosity gnawing away at him Sam asked “So you do know Tony?”
“Peggy…” Bucky breathed and the woman turned and gave her friend a smile.
“If you mean the training I’ve created, it’s fine. If you mean old man training then it's nothing, as in he’s taught us nothing.” Bucky grumbled and Steve nodded in agreement.
“How do you know? And if that’s true, why would the path keep going?”
“I have brought this great hero here to help you Steven.” Thor explained as he walked over to the blonde. “The Falcon has experience in heroics and has accomplished heroic deeds. I thought his advice would be most helpful to you.”
“Please, we’d all feel better if you used it.” Steve assured as he started placing some of the fabrics in/on the carriage.
“I just wish….” Steve muttered. “I knew how this happened.” Everyone nodded. But Steve then bolted up from his squatting position and began going on a tangent. Releasing all the frustrating questions that plagued him.
The other Avengers seemed to snap out of their confused stupor and took a moment to check Sam over. Phil quickly took off to look for some medical equipment.
“I’m telling you Pepper, either Loki needs to get bent over his throne by thunder dick. Or he needs to bend Thor over his throne with his icicle dick. Either way something has to be done!” He complained dramatically.
Sam, Bucky, and Steve took in as much as they could, each pointing out various things that had caught their eyes as they all explored the city. Sam had come from a large city, but nothing compared to New Thebes. It was one of the most heavily populated places in Greece. Meanwhile, Steve and Bucky had never been to a city as large as this and couldn’t contain their awe at the sheer size and activity of the place.
Bruce nodded in agreement but gave the brunette a smile.
“WHAT?!” Bucky shouted. “OK! That’s enough! Howard you’re talking crazy!”
“Tony,”
Hey everybody! Just letting you know I will be posting 2 chapters this week and none next week.
“Now Loki-”
“You’re supposed to help us with the war!” Tony yelled gaining everyone’s attention. “Dad said that’s why we’re here! Why is all this happening?!” Tony cried grabbing his hair.
“I know!” Tony shouted back, then took a few moments and composed himself. “I know that.  He’s just a different type of hero.” Tony shrugged. “...It was nice to see.” Rhodey made to say something but Tony gave him a look. “Don’t start.” He warned.
“How did you get out of your room?!” Loki asked and Tony just rolled his eyes.
His “step-father” King Minos had insulted the goddess Frigga. This had enraged Odin who then recruited the god Fandral (god of love) to make Minos’s wife Pasiphae fall in love with a prized bull. Eventually this led to Asterion’s birth.  His mother loved him, and tried to protect him from Minos. But eventually Minos found out about him. After that Asterion’s life was filled with pain. Minos locked him up and would abuse him in every way: physically, mentally, and verbally. The worst was when his mother would try to sneak down to the dungeons to see him. Minos would always find out and would make Asterion watch as he whipped her back. But Asterions grew bigger and stronger than the restraints holding him. His mother feared what Minos would do so she snuck him out. After that he found he wasn’t welcome anywhere. Treated as the very thing Minos called him everywhere he went. So he ran for refuge in the Monster Bog.
“I don’t want to lose both of you.” Maria cried.
Loki growled then leaned over the balcony towards the people below and snarled at them. Amora then waved her hand and a few plates and pots appeared near them. All the plates and pots had the Avengers painted on them.
“You mean what we told him, right?” Sam corrected from Bucky’s side.
“Ignore it!” Odin roared.
“If I wasn’t clear we’ll take your weapons as payment if you don’t have the coin.” The woman added, her hands going to her hips.
“And from what you said yesterday. Not the bad parts, but the asking “how to get Steve to like me” part.” Bucky leered.
Betty giggled and nudged Bruce “Figures.”
Jörmungandr had actually jumped and dove into the water. To be fair, even the Avengers were having a hard time hearing and seeing after Thor’s show of power.
Just after the 2 year mark Thor had left the mortals to go visit his lover, Lord Loki. Bucky and Steve worried for their immortal friend but he waved their concern off.
“But you are trying, correct?”
Tony groaned and continued to wring his hands nervously. He bit his lip and attempted to pace but Rhodey grabbed his shoulder and held him in place. Rhodey gave Tony a look of encouragement but it did nothing to calm the man’s nerves.
“Thor! What did I say about-” Bruce began to chastise but Thor threw Bruce a brilliant smile, disarming the man.
“Dad?” Tony breathed looking up at his Father pleadingly.
“Fight or evade?” Natasha asked, looking ready to do either but waiting on their leaders signal.
“The sea?”
A few days later a giant lion had attacked the city.
“Wait wait!” Tony called waving his arms to get Loki to focus back on him. “No! I said I have news.” The god now looked perplexed but Tony just smiled at him. “Ready? They’re not sleeping with Thor!” At Loki’s blank face Tony decided to give the god all the details.
Finally the centaur seemed to notice them and notified Tony of their presence. The group then slowly walked closer as the two took another lap so as to slow down.
“That’s why I’ll be with them.” Tony explained. At Thor’s confused face the mortal elaborated. “If anyone working for Loki hurts me then they get their strength back. So Jörmungandr will avoid touching me as a precaution. If he gets too close to any of them, I’ll jump in between.”
“Right. We can’t just barrel in - STEVE!” Bucky yelled, doing a double take as Steve barrelled into the fray.
“Only if you do.” Tony answered one hand going up and touching Steve’s pectoral.
“Of course I do.”
“And I said no!” A brunette haired man seemed to yell at the centaur. “Now for the-”
“The best course of action is still for him to talk with Lord Thor.” Tony groaned again but Pepper spoke over it. “What he’s doing now is just hurting innocent people that had nothing to do with this.”
“What?” Thor questioned.
“A bit?!” Thor balked.
“Because Riley loved his daughter.” Sam explained.
Steve almost stopped at that but pushed on with a shake of his head. He would not be fooled again.
“You took my authority and threw it away! And you did it in front of these mortals!”
“You get a year.”
The shade was a man, perhaps in his late thirties but Loki was a terrible judge of mortal ages. His hair looked like it once had a fine sheen to it, before the man died, and he had a nicely trimmed mustache. He was wearing a Greek linothorax, and some light hide greaves on his legs. With some traditional Greek sandals adorning his feet.
Later that week Peggy passed away.
All three men scoffed at the blonde and Natasha even shook her head at her friends antics. They were then given the go-ahead from the traffic guide and began to cross with the other pedestrians.
Howard swallowed a hard lump in his own throat as he thought of Peggy. She was an incredible woman. Stong, smart, and authoritative. However even she could not beat the disease.
Sam had flown over Tony’s house to check on them and saw the two passed out. He didn’t bother disturbing them, he simply turned around and went back to tell the Avengers they were OK.
“Before you so rudely interrupted us. Amora and I were discussing something of great importance.” Loki said in a no nonsense tone. “Till that is dealt with I cannot look for this one mortal in Hel.”
Jarvis just smiled as he gave Tony a squeeze. “I will miss you. But I am overjoyed that you will be able to live your life.”
“Tony!” Steve chastised but Tony just glared at him in anger and disgust causing Steve to physically recoil
“It’s not a double cross Bruce.” Natasha reassured placing a calming hand on the man’s shoulder.
“Tony?! Tony please!” Steve begged as he wiped the blood away from Tony’s lips. “Please Tony!”
Steve kept scanning the area, making sure he didn’t steer Tony into any area that was too crowded. The few times they had to wait for the crosswalk, Steve made sure to put himself between his date and the crowd. He would not make the same mistake twice, he would protect Tony.
“I…” Steve rubbed the back of his head and blushed. Sam, noticing the pink hue, began to smile. He had an idea where this was going, while the rest of their friends looked confused. “I was out with Tony actually.”
“Loki I must speak with you.”
Bruce told the other two to stay back until he talked with the brunette. He then had gone to the front entrance and knocked on the door. As soon as Tony opened the door, Thor barreled over Bruce and grabbed Tony in a hug.
Thor blinked at his lover. “That’s pretty precise.”
The feeling grew.
I'm sorry this has taken so long! Work gets insanely busy during year end so these next few updates may take awhile.
“Hey Cap.” Tony gave a small wave, his body language and tone screaming discomfort.
The next day they packed their stuff and planned where they should make their debut. They decided on New Thebes City, the Big Olive itself.
“Suuuuure.”
“He is charming.” Erskine answered playfully.
“Did Thor talk with you?” Steve asked, moving forward. Bucky reached to pull him back but Steve just took another step towards the god. “Have you-”
For the timeline in case I lost anyone: Tony was sacrificed at 8 years old, 2 years later the war ended (Tony’s now 10), 1 year after that the Starks move into Steve’s city (Tony’s now 11), roughly 5 years after that is when the chapter actually takes place (Tony’s now 16).
“What?” Sam gasped and Howard’s mouth dropped open.
“I’ll go to these humans, entice Steve Rogers.” She accentuated her chest and Tony rolled his eyes. “And he’ll release all his secrets to me.” Amora bit her lip as she examined the Avengers below.
“Yes!” Thor agreed, “Loki, my love, I would never break our promise.”
“Actually you can’t.” Tony cut in.
“This needs to be done Tony.” Howard squeezed out dropping his gaze. “This needs to be done in order for us to win the war.”
“Maria’s anger, Howard’s guilt, how they never talk about him! It all adds up!” Bucky exclaimed again.
“They kept going back in!” Happy defended himself as he threw an arm out towards the Mist back on the shore. The ogre then turned a glare to all the baffled Avengers. “I tried to warn you all but you never listened and waltzed right back in time after time.”
“Ah!” Tony screamed as ice clamped around the back of his neck.
“Loki!”
“M-Mom?”
Steve complied and also began dismantling Tony’s. Finally, both clothes loosened enough that their erections sprang free and both men moaned.
“Yeah! And Odin or someone granted them this magic map so they could go get him from the underworld!”
“Rhodey?!” He bolted towards the sound of his friend. “Rhodey!”
“Fine.”
“You’re so perfect!” Thor growled as he yanked on Loki’s horn again.
“No, as long as the spot is filled they could perish the next day after taking your place. Shades are destroyed often here as part of their punishments. Hel has no quarrel with that, as long as the places are filled.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve glanced back where Tony ran off to but nodded in agreement.
“Tony knows Steve was using him, so I had hoped that would be enough incentive for him to not help. But for good measure, I revealed Tony was working for me so he’d surely stay away from them so as to avoid their anger.” Loki growled again “But nooo, apparently he is fine with being a mat they can tread their feet upon.”
“The tail of a snake-” Bruce began but Tony cut him off.
Tony sat on the floor numb, his throat raw from all his yelling and crying. His sobs abruptly stopped at Loki’s announcement. Loki looked at the mortal from his throne and leaned on the armrest.
Steve had tossed Tony up onto the horse (as if he weighed nothing), jumped on in front of the brunette and then pushed the horse into a gallop. Tony had immediately latched onto Steves waist and plastered himself against the blondes back.
Amora had duplicated herself and made herself look like a few weak/disheveled mortals. Her duplicates were in careful positions under the rocks they had planted. Once all her duplicates were free, the Hydra would be unleashed.
“What?” Tony would defend himself when another creature with amorous/lustful feelings would appear on their doorstep. “I did a lot of recruiting jobs Steve.”
Loki was sitting on his throne and attempting to not fidget in impatience. He briefly wondered where Amora had gone off to but dismissed it.
“You need to talk to Thor!” Tony pushed back “He doesn’t even know you’re behind all this!”
Time moved on. Maria moved into Tony’s house with Rhodey. When she had met Rhodey and learned the centaur helped raise Tony, she was so grateful she fell to the floor in a bow to the centaur. Oftentimes Tony would catch his mother talking to Rhodey, asking him to tell her stories of Tony growing up.
