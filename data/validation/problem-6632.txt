“Tony you have to understand, we all love you. Losing you was horrible.” He said, pulling Tony onto his lap so they were face to face and as close as can be. “Anthony Edward Stark, don’t think for a second that the recording you heard was true. I absolutely adore you and love you so fucking much. I was empty without you. Do you understand?” He said, fully crying now.
Tony immediately tensed, out of fear of his friends reaction and out of Steve possibly not wanting them to know.
Tony melted into his embrace, he had been wanting a hug for so long. And he was here, with Steve finally. He thought he wouldn’t live to have a chance to hug his boyfriend again.
“Mr. Stark had just finished working on a project for SI when he became distracted by the coding for the robot from the last battle.” Jarvis explained. “It was the same robot that took him.”
They would allow him to get up and go to the restroom, but that was all the mobility he got before he was strapped back onto the table. They fed him the bare minimum of three meals a day. Then they forced another drug in his system that would make him sleep.
“Oh darn it! You figured me out.” Steve said face palming, “Now I have to go to Fury and come clean.”
The pain was completely unbearable, he felt as if someone was sucking the life out of him and shocking him with the most intense electricity all at the same time. He couldn’t hold back his screams then.
The next day the team were all lounging around in the common room. They were about to all start a training exercise together when Pepper walked in the room.
“Cap, I’m trying to contain these aliens but they are making their way outside of our secured perimeter.” Tony said, sounding stressed. “Send the Hulk my way please.”
Tony was back at it again in his lab working on the last of tech for the Avengers. He was happy, recently things with his team had been taking a turn for the better, they were starting to become something like family to him. He quickly shook himself out of those thoughts, he couldn’t dare to hope for anything like that. If things with Pepper lately were any indication, he’d just end up an irritant and a disappointment.
Natasha’s jaw dropped, no one beat her. However she quickly schooled her expression into one of practiced indifference.
“I’m sorry Pepper, I’ve been busy with the Avengers business. I have been working on it believe me, I’m almost done.” Tony supplied
The theory of having a Gala with the Avengers might seem like a good one, in practice Tony was realizing that he was becoming more and more nervous at the thought.
“Director I just wanted to make sure what happened yesterday truly isn’t a problem.” Steve said looking down.
Tony moaned obscenely at the taste, exaggerating to mess with Steve. “This is the best burger I have ever tasted, thank you Steve. Now you’ll always have to cook for me because no place even comes close.”
It was the next morning. Steve was pleasantly surprised when Tony had shown up in the common room. He assumed Stark would just hide out in the workshop as soon as he was up. It was really nice though, Tony had come down and enjoyed his company. Truth be told he was surprised that the other man had opened up to him, but he was even more surprised that he has opened up to Tony. Talking to Tony had been really… nice.
“Steve, this is what Jarvis told us to do. He did the math. Trust him and me. If he needs more then we will give it to him but his body needs this now.”
But then in a serious tone he said, “Seriously though, you’re the best captain, and friend that I could ever ask for. Thank you Steve.” He said smiling.
The next morning Rhodey came by to the tower. He had spent the last few days hanging out with Pepper and he wanted to see Tony. He knew he owed his friend a visit.
“Of course sweetheart.” Natasha said, “We love you and we wanted you back the second you were gone.” She came up to him and kissed his forehead, then hugged him
Tony looked up at where he had put the painting that Steve made for him. He smiled fondly, but then frowned, he had to keep his team safe, “Sorry Jarvis but no can do. I have to start more upgrades for tech. Can’t risk anyone getting hurt when I could’ve prevented it.” Tony sighed, rubbing his eyes, “Besides I’ve got to keep those Avengers happy.”
“Are you sure this was a smart move? Why aren’t you guys thinking? We all are the faces of the Avengers and we can’t be out there doing stupid stuff!” He said looking a mix or stressed and….hurt...?
“Oh my god….mmm fuck Tony, you feel amazing. You’re so amazing, love you.” He half moaned and shouted. Tony looked up at Steve through lust filled eyes, he would never forget the noises that Steve was making. They both were getting closer.
Steve backed down, he knew how badly Tony needed help, despite the supplies they had in the quinjet, it wouldn’t be enough.
The battle had gone downhill fast. Hulk was able to take on some of the aliens, but it took so much time to take them down. Tony was surrounding the perimeter and shooting the aliens with his repulsors but they weren’t doing as much damage as he liked.
Donald grabbed Tony’s face in his hand, “Yes. You are going to lie here and power this weapon. You have no choice.” He spat.
Tony grabbed Steve’s wrists as Steve said, “You feel that? It’s my heartbeat Tony and we are going to get yours to match mine. In order to do that I need you to help me and breathe with me.”
“It’s not that I don’t care, Pepper, I love working and inventing for the company.” Tony explained, “I just have other priorities now, especially with being co-leader of the Avengers.” He said, trying to get through to her.
“But we already know Steve’s serum and blood has to be somewhat compatible with humans, because Steve was a normal sickly human before he got it.”
They both smiled at each other until Steve pulled Tony onto him. So the other man was lying on top of him, back to chest. Steve rubbed at Tony’s back, massaging him. Tony nuzzled into the touch and sighed contentedly.
“What are you talking about Rhodey? I build them tech and I care so much about my team.” He said defensively.
Steve walked up to Tony after they finished, “Hey Tony I just wanted to say thanks for the other night. I had a lot of fun.” Steve said rubbing the back of his neck, then added “You’re so generous Tony, you work so hard.”
“Now to everyone who’s listening, I understand if you don’t agree with the way we go about saving and helping people, however no one is to speak to us like they did Tony. Our job as Avengers is to protect the world, but to do that we have each other’s backs.” Steve said to the room.
“I have all the ingredients ready.” Steve said, but then smiled mischievously, “But I’ll only make my world famous burgers if you’re good.”
“Very well Avengers, don’t stop on my account.” Fury said. “I look forward to seeing our hyper verbal inventor even if he is a pain in my ass.”
Both men were amazed at how it felt to kiss the other again. Tony pushed his tongue into Steve’s mouth and Steve moaned out and threaded his fingers through Tony’s brown curls.
“Tony I’m gonna cum.” He warned, just as he tried to pull out, Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist.
“Oh Tony you know that I don’t care about that stuff right?” He said, pulling him in by the waist, “Plus I think it’s kinda cute. I love the fact that you don’t actually love flashy, just homey.”
“Well in this case it can, the longer I wait to make improvements for The Avengers the world is at risk. I have to do it.” Tony said sternly and before Steve could say anything else Tony walked away.
“This is your official change of status.” Steve said, “We talked to Fury, made him understand.” And then added, “Because you are one of us Tony, we take care of our own.”
Tony just sat and uttered out “Yeah...I’ll see you later.” He didn’t expect things with Steve to go so well.
“Dude I’m so mad! But it will only be for a couple of days. You should still watch the movie though.” Clint grumbled.
A second later he brought the knife to Tony’s stomach, hard, just above the metal strap. He carved in a D and a J, Donald and Justin’s initials.
Halfway through the movie Tony decided to open up a bit, hugging his knees to his chest, “You know, my best Christmas was with Jarvis. Not my AI but my butler. He took me to his family’s house and Rhodey ended up meeting us there after with some of his family. We talked and laughed and shared a bunch of funny stories. One of the best nights of my life.” Tony ended quietly.
Steve laughed at that, “Sorry to bother you I was just wondering if you knew anything about an email that Pepper sent? Something about us having to go to a Gala?” Steve asked.
With their popcorn and hot chocolate in hand they began to watch the movie, Tony had little commentary here and there, naturally he loved the movie because of the robots.
“Brother this is amazing! A fine piece of art that will be treasured for the rest of my days.” He said then have him a huge hug.
Tony held up a finger, he was finishing up a phone call “Yes yes, that is perfect thank you so much.”
“Look how about no more meetings, press or presentations.” Pepper said. “If there’s something really important we can video chat or I can tell you way in advance. But I’ll summarize and bring all the important things for you to sign and just have you focus on the inventing part of SI.”
Tony was moved beyond words. Everyone he had ever been with always hated the reactor and so did he. Tony knew it was a lasting reminder of all the lives he took. Apparently, Steve didn’t see it that way.
That evening when Tony returned from SI, he immediately went to the team. He was a bit worried when Jarvis had told him that they wanted to speak to him right away.
Tony immediately tensed at that and looked down, “Oh um, yeah Pepper wants us to attend because it’s to raise money for rebuild projects and a lot of good charities. She thinks if the Avengers show face they might donate much more.” And yes, Tony did read the information Pepper sent after their little spat.
Steve turned and saw him, smiling even more brightly than before. “Tony!” He said excitedly, getting up to hug him.
The team was upset and devastated to say the least. They all had different ways of coping but they needed each other for this, they lost one of their own. However that didn’t stop them all from having their mini breakdowns in private.
Coulson had called them all in because apparently there were some bizzare octopus looking aliens who were attacking New York. Basically the Avengers were needed since the police couldn’t contain them any longer.
It was a day later when Thor final arrived from Asgard. The team was in the middle of discussing the specifics of the Gala when a roar of thunder broke through their conversation. Not a minute later, Thor walked through the door.
Tony simply let himself be hugged and then afterwards went to go see Steve. They hadn’t talked much since Steve had been sleeping practically the whole time he was recovering.
“It’s beautiful, Tony. Absolutely stunning.” Steve said, grabbing Tony’s hand, “Thank you for everything Tony. We don’t deserve you.”
“Wow, Thor…this is beautiful.” Steve said as Tony came and sat down next to Steve on the couch, taking his hand in his.
So this chapter is a bit longer and I hope you guys like! Clint and Thor are back and next chapter we might see Tony and Steve get a bit more closer ;)
So this is where the smut actually happens. It doesn’t happen until later in the chapter but I did want to warm you.  This is my first time writing smut so I hope you like it! The —- are longer separating those scenes so you can skip it if that’s not your thing. I really hope you guys like it!
Agent Coulson has briefed them, apparently they had been tracking some bad guys who had been buying supplies for bombs, but they didn’t know who they were working for. These guys weren’t smart enough to know what it took to do it on their own.
“Ugh you wouldn’t believe how many idiots there are on the board, you explain why things are wrong over and over again and they just don’t ever seem to get it.” Tony said running a hand over his face and sitting down at the counter.
“That doesn’t matter! I’m supposed to be the first to know, especially if it involves the Avengers. It’s your job to tell me.” Tony tried not to yell.
“You never really talk about it.” Steve said slowly, “I mean I wouldn’t but if you ever need someone to listen…” he trailed off.
“This just in, folks.” The anchorwoman said sadly, “The search for Tony Stark ends as his blood is found at a crime scene. The infamous Iron Man is gone. The Avengers have yet to comment on the matter.”
“So Thor,” Steve said, “It’s good you got here. We were just talking about a party that the whole team has to go to in a few days.”
“Yeah, Tony is special to us all.” Bruce said, “I don’t think even he realizes how important he is to this team.”
“Being co-leader.” She said, “Did Steve really approve of that?” Pepper asked, emphasizing Steve’s name.
Steve couldn’t hold off another second as he thrust one last time inside Tony and filled him with his seed.
“Of course Tony, I have a few things I need to bring in here but I honestly can’t wait to officially move in with you.” Steve smiled.
“Whenever things get too stressful at SI, with Avengers or just with life I want you to tell me. I want to be apart of every aspect of my boyfriends life. The good and the bad, all of it.”
“Look Steve… I just want to try my best to keep everyone safe. You say I’m vital to the team but so is everyone.” Tony paused and took a breath, “But… uh, thank you for being concerned, it means a lot.” Tony said while barely being able to maintain eye contact. He wasn’t used to gratitude, much less praise.
“Oh… okay, well it’s safe and it’s for a good cause so with your thumbs up we’d be good to go.” Tony said and then looked down.
Tony stayed in his workshop the night after the mission. He was trying to add a program in his suit that could effectively disable bombs quicker than today.
He eventually passed out on his workbench due to exhaustion. The only reason he woke up was because Jarvis was speaking to him.
“Yes… maybe it could. I’ll use a similar formula that I did for me.” Bruce smiled, “But guys this is a long shot and we don’t know how Steve’s blood will affect Tony. There might be mutations or Tony’s body could reject the blood.”
“Oh well Nat and Clint got called in from Fury about a possible mission and Bruce said something about a meditation day and I haven’t seen him since.” Steve replied.
He quickly shook himself out of those thoughts and decided to check his phone. He frowned in surprise when he saw that he had an email from Pepper Potts that said all of the Avengers were supposed to attend some big Gala in the middle of New York.
“So just out of curiosity… your drawing, it looked like the inside of an old house. Was that your old home?” Tony asked hesitantly.
“Well I wouldn’t be if I were him, but you know Stark. He’s allergic to any type of responsibility.” Clint retorted.
“Yeah I’m installing new upgrades don’t worry. And your suit is now bullet and flame proof.” Tony supplied quickly.
About an hour later Tony was released from Medical. Bruce said it was fine but just to be sure Jarvis scanned him one last time. However it just confirmed what they already knew: Tony was healthier and stronger than ever.
“My, oh my!” Hammer began, tapping his temple, “What to do with you. We have so much time!” He boasted, “The possibilities are endless.”
Tony looked down at the first paper, it was his original assessment except this time it said, “Iron Man: Yes, Tony Stark: Recommended and very much needed.” Tony read in a shaky voice as his eyes started to blur.
“Well it’s good to see you two are getting along just fine. Thought you were busy on missions and that’s why you couldn’t talk. And yes things have been strained but it’s not my fault.” Tony said defensively.
This is how Steve ended up painting something for Tony, technically it was two paintings. The first, was of the Iron Man armor in the midst of a recent battle that they had won. Tony had come in and swooped up Natasha and Clint at the perfect moment and saved them. Steve had been so relieved that everyone was okay, afterwards they ended their victory with all of them getting rides on the Iron Man armor. It was a night they’d never forget.
“What?” Steve asked shocked, “Tony it’s not ugly or wrong. I think it’s beautiful and it’s a part of you. Anything part of my Tony is gorgeous and it shows just how far you’ve come.” He said, then he planted a kiss right at the center of the reactor, bringing a hand up to worship and explore.
“I can’t thank you guys enough for coming in when you did. If you hadn’t, I have no idea what would have happened.” Tony told Clint and Thor gratefully.
They sat with their legs close again, despite the abundance of room, before they finally made it to the museum.
Tony was writhing underneath him, his dick leaking precum against his stomach. “Steve, I’m ready, I promise.” He cried out, “I want this.”
“I didn’t know that you built them tech Tony, I thought SHIELD or Fury did that.” Pepper said. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
So he found himself sitting against Steve’s side smiling softly. They were all gathered around in a circle, sitting on pillows on the carpet. He had no idea how he got so lucky, to have a family like this meant the world to him. When he became a member of the Avengers he thought he would become teammates at best, he never pictured a family that he always wanted.
“Um clearly he doesn't go for looks,” he said staring pointedly at Tony. “He goes for intelligence and I for one happen to be the smartest in the room.” Clint said confidently.
They both laughed a little more and Steve enjoyed seeing the light in Tony’s eyes, he had a hard time remembering seeing him this happy and Steve couldn’t remember being this carefree.
“Would you… would you want me to explain it to you? Show you how it works?” Tony asked hesitantly, like he was expediting an immediate rejection.
A week after blissful living in the tower-a week that included Tony taking Steve and Thor to several secluded areas of New York; as well as a trip to First Friday where Steve and Thor tried everything every food truck had to offer-it was unfortunately necessary for the Avengers to step in for a mission.
Tony perked up a little at that. “So anyways I have to go back to the lab now.” He said, he just wanted to deal-no sulk- over his crush in peace.
“It’s okay Tony, it’s normal.” Steve sighed “You care about us and we care about you so if course you are gonna worry.”
After a few minutes of holding each other, Steve spoke up. “So I was thinking,” Steve said as he ran a hand up and down Tony’s back soothingly, “That since you’ve had such a rough day, I could make you your favorite: cheeseburgers.” Steve smiled.
Fury scoffed, “Stark really said that?” He said rolling his eye, “If anyone is going to do that to the team it’s him.”
“Of course.” Thor said “It is a shame we couldn’t arrive before our Captain was injured.” He added sadly.
After about an hour or so of Tony being an angel of massaging Steve and talking to him, Tony said there was something he wanted to show Steve.
He sat in the common room sketching, he had a dinner date already in mind but it was much too early to start cooking. He wanted to make Tony his favorite: cheeseburgers.
Of course they tasked Steve with getting Tony out of his workshop, saying that “If anyone could do it, it’s you” with smirks on their faces.
The next morning Steve made breakfast for the the remaining Avengers. Steve, Bruce and Natasha all sat around the kitchen island conversing.
Tony shifted in Thor’s hold so he was lying on top of him and Steve reached to grab Tony’s feet so they rested on his lap.
“Yes, it should only be a few more minutes… there’s something familiar about the coding in the robot.” Tony said as an afterthought.
“Hey Steve I was wondering if I could see you in my lab for a moment?” He asked, “I need to draw some blood from you. I figured out a serum that could help delay the Hulk. He reacts to danger and if I could extract some healing capabilities from the serum and put it into me, then Hulk wouldn’t need to come out for less severe situations.” He explained.
“I mean come on guys this was a huge win for us! And Thor blasted that jerks car, if that isn’t a reason to celebrate then I don’t know what is!”
“Oh okay great well that’s pretty much what it said in the email but I just wanted to check in with you.” Steve smiled “Looks like I have to bust out my fancy suit.” He joked.
Steve was about to ask him to help the Hulk when a giant octopus alien managed to grab him with his tentacles. They wrapped around him fast and immediately began to crush him.
“Hello everyone, I hope I’m not bothering but I just need to grab Tony for a moment.” She said kindly.
Bruce suppressed a gasp as soon as he saw Tony, he had to be professional about this. He had to see Tony as just another patient so he wouldn’t Hulk out. Yes, he had the serum to help him but the state Tony was in was way beyond upsetting.
Tony sat there completely in shock. He couldn’t believe what Steve had said, much less form an articulate reply… “I… um….” he looked down and rubbed the back of his neck, he knew he owed Steve a thanks. He wasn’t expecting such upfront honesty and he definitely didn’t think that’s what Steve and the others actually thought. He quickly swallowed down any emotion that he may-he definitely wasn’t feeling.
“Sir I really advice that you take a break. Your body scans are showing that if you don’t rest within the next few hours you’ll collapse from exhaustion.”
Tony fully intended to simply take a few hours for a quick nap and then go back to work...unfortunately life had other plans. He slept through the rest of the night and the entire morning and woke around 4:30 pm.
Pepper went steely at that, before replying, “I don’t understand why you are making such a huge deal out of this. Steve is the captain of the Avengers, not you. Secondly I let him know because I know he won’t ignore me or make up excuses. He is the leader of a team to protect the world for a reason, he is responsible and reliable.” She all but spat at him.
They both broke into a fit of giggles and then Tony launched himself into Steve’s lap, kissing Steve all over his face. “Go on another date with me?” Tony asked shyly, as if he was  uncertain if Steve would agree.
Then, Donald began hooking up the wires to Tony’s arc reactor. One wire went on the reactor itself and then the other, into the skin next to it.
“No, actually I do.” Tony said, starting to get angry, “I get that you’re ashamed to have people know that you’re in a relationship with me.” Tony snapped, “So don’t worry I’ll get Pepper to set up a conference immediately so we can repair your now tarnished image.” Tony growled out, then quickly turned away.
“Remember how I told you I could play instruments? Well my mom taught me piano and I wrote this for you.” Tony said looking nervous.
“I’ve been noticing Tony looks tired when he thinks we aren’t looking.” Natasha replied neutrally, with just a hint of concern under the surface.
“It is a huge deal Tony!” Steve said upset, “I will have words with him. No one threatens to kick any of my teammates off, serious or not.” Steve said with finality. Then something else occurred to him.
“I think I’m going to skip movie night, if that’s okay. I really want to work on this, and I may call you down for more blood if I need it.” He said apologetically, “It’s just this is very time sensitive and I really need to get it right.” He tried to justify.
“Clint, we don’t know how this will work.” Bruce said, however there was a slight smile threatening to appear.
Steve took a moment before replying, he could see that Tony was stressed but he knew he couldn’t just let this go. There was clearly a major misunderstanding that needed to be cleared up. However this was Tony, he needed to choose his words carefully otherwise the result would be the same as yesterday.
“Good.” Tony said, moving up to straddle him while also taking Steve’s face in his hands, “I just want to make sure, I don’t want you to feel pressured or—”
Steve placed an arm on Bruce’s shoulder, “Bruce I would do anything to help you. I want to help, I promise it’s no trouble at all.” Steve smiled, “And it’s kinda cool being part of lab action, lord knows I barely come in here because I can’t keep up.” He said ruefully.
Tony had no idea what to make of that, “Okay… well just give me a few more minutes down here to finish up and then I’ll meet you upstairs.”
“Shush now Legolas.” Tony continued, “As you know, I have been in Japan for the past few weeks, and of course you have missed me dearly.” Tony said overconfident.
Steve momentarily pulled away to grab the supplies but then stopped, “Um Tony, I’m not trying to make you uncomfortable or anything but, do you want to use a condom?” He asked, when met with silence he hastened to explain, “I can’t catch anything and I can’t give you anything either. I’m clean but still I don’t want you to feel obligated—”
“I can’t he’s already trying to deal with two rogue aliens.” Steve said breathlessly, while punching an alien to the ground.
“Tony… it’s no big deal. I already talked to Fury, he says aside from us being covered in mud it’s not that bad. It’s good for the public to see the more human side of the Avengers.” Steve said, feeling silly trying to defend himself covered in mud.
After Tony was finished, Steve made quick work of kissing every inch of Tony’s chest, however when he got to the arc reactor he felt Tony freeze.
“Well maybe we can all go out sometime. There’s some places I wanna show you, a lot with good food.” Tony said excitedly.
“I’ll have you know, Donald, that this event was organized by Pepper and if you actually had listened to anything anyone has said tonight, no profits will be going to Stark Industries, only to charities and rebuilding organizations.”
Tony did smile a little then, “Yeah well it wasn’t all horrible, I mean I turned out fine didn’t I?” Tony said joking a bit.
Once Tony was finished with the work for SI he was about to get up and leave before he remembered he wanted to look at the coding for the robot from the last battle. Something had seemed really familiar about it and he had yet to figure it out.
“Well you missed breakfast but don’t worry I saved you some. And believe me it was quite a feat considering Clint is keen on eating everything in this kitchen.” Steve said smiling, handing him the plate of food.
He went to the living room and was about to ask Jarvis if Steve was awake when he saw Steve talking to Clint.
Tony sighed running a frustrated hand over his face, “Jarvis I already told you I can’t take a break, I need to get the equipment for the Avengers updated. I can’t risk them getting hurt in the field just because I need a little nap.”
“Yeah it is.” Tony said smiling bright. “Steve went in and made Fury change my status. I have a picture framed of Furys ‘scared shitless face’, it’s probably the most valuable thing I own.” Tony said laughing.
Tony didn’t like the idea of two of his closest friends talking-what felt like-behind his back. Besides he thought one of the reasons Rhodes didn’t reach out was because he was busy. Turns out he just didn’t want to talk to Tony.
“No Tony you can’t have the fries, besides the burgers will be ready in just a few minutes.” Steve said, trying not to laugh at Tony’s antics.
“Yes Sir, they are still at the beginning of the first Lord of the Rings movie. Glad to see you will be joining them.” The AI sounded way too pleased with himself.
“Are you serious Tony? That’s amazing yes of course I would love to go! Wow I can’t wait, let me just go change my clothes to something fancier.” And just like that Steve was off.
“I just wanted you to know.” Tony said, half awkwardly, “Of course I can come back in case of an emergency.”
“Director,” Steve said, by the tone of his voice, Fury could tell he was speaking to Captain America, “We need to talk to you about Stark.”
“You look like you could use some whipped cream with that.” Steve tried to joke, but it just fell flat.
That had been hours ago. Now everyone was asleep or waiting, or both. Natasha was asleep sitting up, Clint sleeping against her side and Thor managed to pass out on top of both of them.
“Yes, it was used in many battles by one of my most beloved comrades. It seemed appropriate that you should have it as our leader.” He said seriously.
“Sir you programmed me to assist you, I was simply trying to aid your health” the AI responded rather sassily.
He let out a long sigh as he entered the common room. He was greeted by the sight of Pepper and Tony hugging goodbye, he was happy to see that they were getting along better.
“Well yes. Due to my super soldier hearing. I heard what she said.” Steve grimaced, “She was harsh. She said some things. She called Tony selfish and said that he pretty much does whatever he wants.”
Seriously, come on! All the Avengers in one very crowded place with alcohol being served was probably the conditions for a perfect storm. But it was too late to go back now as they were all going to meet up in the lobby for Happy to drive them.
“It’s uh, I’m renaming the tower. It’s the Avengers tower now. Seemed appropriate with us being a team and all. ‘Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ deserve their name up there, not just me.” Tony said with a small smile.
Tony broke free of the kiss to catch his breath and then nipped at Steve’s neck. Planting kisses all over the other man. Steve chuckled and then took Tony’s hand in his and raised it to his mouth to kiss.
Tony looked down but closed his eyes when he felt the needle hit his skin. He locked his jaw and refused to give Donald the satisfaction of looking afraid.
Steve always tries to do his best to be the leader. He was luckily enough to cheat death, when all of his family had to die, he was the one who woke up with a new life. Steve refuses to take that for granted, he needs to save lives and be the best leader he can be.
“Since I’ll love to hear you scream. It’s not like anyone can hear you out here anyways.” He laughed.
Besides the nervousness all he felt was happiness, he was about to become one with the person he absolutely adored. One look at Steve’s beautiful smile, and all the nervousness was out the window.
“That’s what you think?” Tony asked incredulously, looking to Steve’s worried face. “Steve, baby I’m completely amazed and happy in ways I can’t even describe. I thought I would have damage forever and now you’re telling me that I have your blood in my veins. Honey I couldn’t be happier.” He said.
Suddenly the top to the trunk was thrown open and he was grabbed roughly from the car. He struggled to find his footing as the two guards Justin had with him kept pulling him forward.
Tony was very tempted to just dismiss himself and retreat down to the workshop, but Steve had been making an effort lately. He thought he should at least try to return the favor.
In that moment they both understood the gravity of the situation. They were meant to be together and they were finally one. They locked eyes, looking at each other with such adoration
Steve chuckled in response and then slowly pushed a finger into Tony, making sure not to go too fast and also looked for any signs of discomfort.
They held close, basking in the happiness of the other. Tony smiled up at Steve and lifted up to give him a kiss. They laughed when Steve removed a piece of pie crust from Tony’s hair, and then leaned in touching by their foreheads.
They both were smiling, high off of pure happiness. They couldn’t believe how lucky they were to have each other.
Tony began to shake his head, “No no no. No more please.” He mumbled, “Too much, can’t… can’t power anymore.”
It wasn’t even the fact that they showed the picture, which admittedly was annoying. No, it was the fact that Steve raced out of the room as soon as humanly possible. It showed that Steve hated the fact that the public knew, he was ashamed that his name was tied to his.
Tony woke up the next morning with a happy sigh. He thought back to the night before, the unexpected reciprocation of his feelings. He and Steve had made out happily until Jarvis reminded Tony that he had a meeting to attend to the next morning. Tony had honestly thought of donating Jarvis to MIT in that moment, but Steve simply kissed his cheek and told him that he would wait for him after his meeting.
“So Tony, I realize it is just me and my two guys and that might give you some funny ideas about running away.” He said grabbing Tony’s chin in his hands. “However if you so much as try to escape I have a bomb rigged in your tower and I will activate it if I can’t find you.” Tony’s eyes widened and he started panting behind the gag. “That way if you ever try to leave me you will be responsible for all those deaths, maybe even some avengers. I mean you may be gone but they’ll stay, that bitch Pepper will insist that they stay, and they will because all they’ve ever wanted is your money. And all you’d be doing by leaving is being selfish, because no one would want you back anyways.” He spat.
“Don’t worry, Steve. We will find him, he means too much to all of us.” Bruce said kindly, grabbing his arm.
He continued gasping as Donald began to speak, “Do you understand me now Tony? I know all about your adventures in Afghanistan and we can continue this for forever if this is how you want to act.” He said in a reprimanding tone.
“Hey, hey there tiger slow down it’s 3:30 in the morning.” He said as Steve sat back down, “We can plot to overthrow SHIELD, but it has to at least be at a reasonable hour like 11am.”
Tony paled and began to breathe deeply. He willed himself to be strong. It was just pain, he had dealt with it before. He just had to be strong until the Avengers found him.
“Missions have been going well. I think I’ll have a week of so off at the end of the month. Hopefully I can see you.” Rhodey said smiling.
“Yeah gotta get that workout in early.” Steve replied awkwardly. “But I can see you both are very busy and hard at work so I’ll leave you too it.” Steve added in just wanting to leave.
“Look the reason we have been so hard on you is because we should’ve been harder on you in the past. A lot of mistakes could’ve been prevented and we just didn’t want you to go back to your old ways I guess.” Rhodey said.
As Tony scooped rather generous amounts of ice cream in a bowl he thought back on what had happened. He was in the workshop when he finally decided to listen to Jarvis and succumb to sleep. However, there was a reason he avoided it, he had a horrible nightmare about the team dying and then Howard had showed up and told him what a failure he was, how he was still a murder. Then he woke up screaming which resulted in an anxiety attack…
The others, excluding Steve and Bruce had long since passed out on the couch. They were exhausted from battle and Thor had gone to Asgard and back to bring back their medicine, just in case Steve’s serum didn’t work.
“I’ve been really good lately. Things with the team have been great. Wait how did you know I’m here? Aren’t you usually away on some super secret mission?”
Tony tried to protest but Clint wouldn’t budge so they all ended up falling asleep on top of each other.
After an hour or so, Tony barely held onto consciousness. He felt like he was dying. Breathing became harder and his breaths were more shallow. He didn’t know how Hammer thought he was going to last another day if he kept this up.
“It’s okay man,” he said with shiny eyes, “I understand. We all miss him and love him. But at least now we get him back.” He said with a pat on his shoulder.
As Tony cried, he buried his face in Steve’s chest. Steve stroked his back and began speaking softly, “God Tony, to hear what they did to you…” he said at a loss. “You didn’t deserve any of it. And none of it was true, we looked for you every second you were gone. And the only word that could come close to describe what we felt, when we heard you were gone…” he stopped, taking a breath, “Was absolute devastation.” Steve managed to get out, years running down his eyes.
Tony sat back, shocked at what he had just seen and heard. A mix of pure happiness and disbelief flowed through him. Happy tears streamed down his face, a part of him still couldn’t believe what he witnessed was real.
“Shit shit shit shit!” Tony cursed. He was about to blast the alien with energy from the rector in his chest when he looked up.
“Oh my god of course I know who she is! A badass, powerful female Samurai. Thank you Tony, this is incredible.”
Tony tried to fuck himself on Steve’s tongue and face but Steve held his thighs down firmly. Tony whined at that but didn’t do anything other than moan and writhe.
Steve just ruffled Tony’s hair fondly which proceeded to lead to a leaf fight. Then Steve challenged Tony to climb the tree, and they both weren’t playing fair, pushing and pulling each other’s legs to keep the other from wining.
“Oh” Tony deflated. “Well that’s too bad.” He said rubbing the back of his neck. “Well maybe we have something here.”
“If it were a problem, trust me I would’ve told it to you straight away.” Fury said sitting down and motioning for Steve to do the same, “Any reason you’re asking me again?”
Tony found himself for once, to be caught up with work, with the exception of one project for SI. He decided to venture out to go find Steve, when he didn’t find him in the common room he asked Jarvis,
Steve just laughed in response, “It’s nothing, Shellhead.” Pecking Tony’s cheeks, “I know how hard you work and how stressful things get for you.”
“What? Who me? Never, Rhodey Bear.” Tony said in mock innocence. “Just making sure they’re treating you right Honey Bun.” He joked.
He was a bit confused as to why he was supposed attend, he decided to go down and ask Tony if he knew anything about it.
“I know it’s hard to believe, but we did exist back then too.” Steve smiled “And I know people would like to think of Captain America as a straight man but I can’t help who I am. I met too many amazing men during the war, I quickly figured out I wasn’t limited to gender.”
Pepper immediately shot him an award winning smile, “Good Morning Steve, back from a run I see.” Tony just rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest.
Steve continued to kiss Tony, loving the prick of Tony’s stubble on his face, and the sweet taste of his lips. He pulled away only to nip at Tony’s neck and then peck his cheeks.
Tony had never felt so full, Steve was big and stretched him out so nicely. Tony shifted and then it was a new angle and Steve went in deeper and found that magical spot inside of Tony.
“Yeah well whatever” Tony grumbled “Thanks for the meal Cap. Gotta keep your resident genius up and running, I get it.” Tony meant for it to sound like a joke but it came out more as a statement of fact.
This doubt lasted until Steve and the rest of the team saw him. They all smiled at the same time and Thor immediately got up and ran to him, “Brother of Iron, how wonderful for you to join us!” He yelled as he gave him a bear hug that knocked the wind out of Tony.
“Cap you aren’t going to lose us the way you lost your family from before.” Nat, added, placing her hand on his knee, “You can take a breath, we are all a team and we all will look out for each other.”
At that moment he heard Tony walk into the common room and all the nervousness came rushing back. What if his paintings weren’t good enough? Tony bought rare, priceless pieces of art all the time. The man was the world's most successful businessman, he had probably seen it all.
Tony was the first one down as he was the most experienced with getting ready quickly for these things.
Tony really couldn’t believe that he was nervous—well actually he could. Even though he had a reputation of being a playboy, it really wasn’t all that true. With the exception of Pepper, all he had was a string of one night stands of meaningless sex. And well, everyone knew how things ended with Pepper.
“Sorry but not sorry, Tony.” He said patting his head, “You're to stay like this until the weapons are powered.” He said glancing at the camera, “And that’s going to be a while.”
“I’m sorry Thor, I know you must’ve been through a lot.” Steve said sadly. Then he smiled mischievously “Hey how's about you and me try to bake a cake together?”
After that they managed to move most of Steve’s possessions to-now his and Tony’s-penthouse. The team had seen them in passing and had quickly caught wind of the situation. They decided to help Steve and Tony move the boxes up, with a bunch of teasing as payment of course.
While this was happening Tony tried to control his breathing. He knew whatever was going to happen wasn’t going to be good. He tried to hold back his thrashing and was only partially successful.
Thor and Steve bonded in those weeks, they went out sightseeing in New York. Thor was very fun to hangout with and he was a hilarious tourist. They went to restaurants and saw new sights together. Steve wished Tony could be there but he would be home soon enough.
Currently it seemed as if Natasha was going to win, but Tony knew just how good Steve was. He smiled as he knew what was coming.
“God how could anyone love you?” Hammer seethed, “You're a horrible person who’s done horrible things. You sure Captain America isn’t some secret Hydra goon? How else could he even stand to be near you.” He spat.
Tony sat irritated at the meeting, he was ready for it to be over and wanted to go see Steve already. It was stupid that he even had to go to these things, all people did was talk out of their ass, it was just a waste of his time.
“It’s okay Steve, I agree, besides I’m clean anyways. I want this.” Tony said resolutely and filled with love.
“That’s awful Tony, I’m sorry. So you got to spend the holidays with Jarvis from there on out, some good came out of the bad.” Steve smiled.
Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist, leaning into his side, and then asked, “So where are we going?”
“Does matter? It’s Stark we are talking about, he’s irresponsible and selfish and it’s only a matter of time before he screws up.” Fury said shaking his head. “Now if you’ll excuse me I have other matters to attend to.”
At this point Tony just walked away, muttering “Well nice to see you too and I’ll see you in two weeks, I guess.”
They kept on talking until Jarvis interrupted, “Captain, you asked me to alert you when Ms. Romanoff and Mr. Barton arrived back from the mission.”
“Really? Because I wasn’t. I thought you were gone baby. I missed you more than anything and I can’t imagine what those monsters did to you.” Steve said angry, but then sighed and stroked Tony’s face, “But it’s okay if you don’t want to talk right away, just know I’m here to help you, and I always will be because I love you.”
He would spend more time with Steve, the idea of a press conference now seemed like a cake walk. He would spend more time with his family, take them on vacations. He would invent more but also sleep more. He would be more healthy because life is too precious for other nonsense.
“Ah then we must partake!” He said joyously, “It is a good way to aid the mind in forgetting our fallen brothers” he added sadly.
Donald went to grab a needle and a length of tubing and brought it back to the table. Tony flinched away from Donald as far as the restraints would let him.
Tony moaned in response and trusted towards Steve’s fingers, clearly inviting him to do more. “God Steve, you’re such a tease.”
Steve woke up in the late morning next to Tony, he couldn’t help the smile that crept up on his face. Yesterday had been so special and now he and Tony were sharing a bed. He didn’t know how he ended up this lucky, but here he was.
Tony looked at him shocked and with watery eyes. And in that moment Steve lost his self control and grabbed Tony into a huge hug.
Tony quickly realized that he slept the day away so instead of immediately going down to the workshop something compelled him to go down to the common floor.
“You haven’t Tony.” Steve said vehemently. “You have saved the world, given so much back to it. And you saved me too.” Steve said looking down.
The AI knew better than to argue so Tony just continued to work and worry. He was in the middle of trying to make Clint’s arrows explode by voice command when Jarvis spoke up again.
He tried not to think of the recording. He knew it was their voices, but deep down he knew they had been tricking him. He needed to believe that.
Steve pulled Bruce aside, “I’m sorry Bruce but this is going to be a code green. We’re already two men down and from the looks of it, the aliens have done some serious damage.”
After the battle had finished, everyone came out tired but relatively okay. Overall the team had performed as a unit. Natasha came out with a sprained ankle but luckily that was the worst of it.
“Tony, look at me now. Please.” He said, then reached out and carefully placed his hand on Tony’s arm to guide him around.
Hammer eventually stopped and Tony took stock of his body. He was bleeding all over from the whip, his body was bruising horribly from where Hammer had hit him and his rib hurt terribly. He could barely breathe because Hammer had been brutal.
“So Tony, here’s how things are going to go, this weapon has yet to be powered, and well your arc reactor would be perfect. The wires will attach to your reactor and will suck out the energy.” He explained. “That in itself will be painful but since it’s you I made it so it will send ripples of electricity from the grenades to your whole body as the energy flows.” He smiled. One wire was red and the other was black, almost as if someone was going to electrocute him.
Later that evening the team was in the middle of an intense poker match. Well, some of them were heavily invested (Clint and Thor). Tony opted out of playing, stating that none of them could afford to play against him.
Then he walked away for a minute. Tony took the moment to try to catch his breath. He took careful breaths because he didn’t want his rib to poke his lungs. He felt more tears fall when his breaths became painful.
“Pep that would be a lifesaver.” Tony said as he got up to hug her. “I’m sorry for calling you selfish.”
The guards lifted him up from the table and stood him up. After that, they took out chains that locked around his wrists and then connected it to more chains that locked around his ankles.
“Why would you say that Fury? He’s done nothing but save our asses, and besides Thor and I were the ones who screwed up yesterday.” He said, starting to get angry.
“You uh, look great Steve.” said Tony before quickly looking away “And as for the rest of ya, maybe we should stop defending the world and take up modeling.” Tony said in perfect Stark bravado.
Tony woke up feeling… well better than he had in as long as he could remember. Which was strange considering the recent turn of events.
The AI stayed silent after that, he knew that was the closest thing to an admission as he was going to get.
“What? That makes no sense!” Yelled Clint, “He never does whatever he wants.” Clint shrugged looking down, “I mean I know I joke a lot about Stark. But I know what he does for us. I see how he works to make our equipment top of the line. I know he cares and tries to protect us.”
Everyone looked a mix of astonished and appropriately awed. That is, until a loud and large lightning bolt struck right outside the building.
Thanks to the super serum, Steve naturally didn’t need as much sleep as the average person. Unfortunately that meant that some nights he simply wasn’t tired and that allowed his mind to wander.
Tony spent the next half hour whimpering and moaning out in pain. He tried to keep his breathing level, the last thing he needed was an anxiety attack. The cuts had thankfully stopped bleating but they still hurt, and the letters became more visible, much to Tony’s dismay.
“What’s going on Pepper? Is there something you need me to sign?” Tony asked, crossing his arms, subconsciously defending himself.
Tony felt as if his heart was ripped out of his chest. He turned away as much as he could and sobbed, he cried for the life that was taken away from him and the life he would never get to have now.
“Well I was wondering if maybe you’d want to… christen our bed? I mean there’s no pressure and I don’t want you thinking that I wanted you to move in with the expectation that we sleep together but I was thinking a little-well actually a lot that it would be really nice to be closer to you and you know what? Just forget it. Fuck Steve I’m sorry I don’t want you to think that this was what the whole writing a song and asking you to move in was about and—”
Tony hadn’t felt anything so sexually satisfying before in his life. He felt Steve’s warm spend fill him up and felt marked in the best possible way.
“None of that, Tony.” Steve said, “We don’t deserve you, you’re one of the most giving people I know and you do so much without expecting anything back. God you saved all of us.” Steve said, voice full of wonder, “I’m the lucky one here, the world doesn’t deserve you.” He said, holding Tony close and running his fingers through the other man's hair.
He made his way up to the kitchen and honestly would probably have won an award for most realistic zombie.
“Oh well thanks Steve. I appreciate that.” Tony said, “Sometimes trying to balance everything out… especially for SI can be just so stressful. Sometimes it’s hard to please everyone.” He said looking down. “If you need me I’ll just be down in the lab.
“Open your eyes, or we break two” Hammer growled as he grabbed Tony’s face, “Remember try anything and I blow the building. Try anything else and I’ll plant another explosive.” He threatened, “Oh yeah and don’t forget to scream.” He smiled, then nodded to the guard.
“Anyways I need to let you know that I will be gone for about a week or two.” Thor said seriously, “I have some business back at Asgard that I must attend to.”
“No it’s fine…” he said looking away, “Doubt he would even stop by to see me if he had the whole year off.”
Steve sighed, “Tony why do you think we all love movie nights so much? We hate being alone with nightmares so we spend the time together in order to minimize the fear.” Steve gently turned his hands over to properly hold Tony’s, “Sadly, nightmares are just part of being a hero.”
“Hahaha. Be gone evil beasts!” Thor shouted, “You attack my comrades, then you must deal with the God of Thunder!” Immediately blasting a large sum of aliens with his lighting, killing them instantly.
“Oh hell yes! Let me make popcorn and oh! I can melt chocolate over it, trust me it’s the best!” Tony said excited.
“The serum, disintegrated-for lack of a better word-the shrapnel in your heart. And your heart is stronger than ever. But we didn’t want to take the arc out without your consent and we didn’t want to do anything to deter your healing.”
Before tonight, they both never understood the term “lovemaking”. They both thought the concept to be a bit absurd, but that night it was as if they were a single soul. They understood it then, and hoped they always would.
Needless to say he lost track of time. He felt as if he had been down there for years, the pain and sleep all bled into one.
What felt like hours of endless screaming, morning and crying passed by. Tony’s breathing became ragged and constant tears were flowing out of his eyes.
“That doesn’t change the fact that it was irresponsible, people could’ve gotten hurt and you two look like idiots!” Tony said growing more angry. “And of course Fury gives you two a free pass, if it were me he would’ve had my head.” He said and walked away.
They were in Steve’s room, trying to figure out what to take to Tony’s penthouse. Steve didn’t have many possessions, a few photos, a lot of paintings and a few miscellaneous items. There wasn’t an issue until they had reached his closet, which Tony decided needed to be redone with a whole new design.
“I know babe, but Fury called and said that it had to do with Hydra. It’s not dangerous, I’m just going to find information that they may have left behind. Fury wants me to go because he doesn’t want to let anything get out.”
“Tony listen to me.” Steve said trying to get through to him, “You do so much to protect this team, you saved all of our asses more times than I can count. You do so much, trust me when I say that you can take a break. Not because we think you’re a liability but because you are our friend. We care about you more than the suit and the upgrades. Iron man is a huge asset to the team, that’s true, but Tony is vital. You are one of us, we care about you. End of story. We want you to be well because you deserve it more than anyone.” Steve ended his mini rant with a hand through his hair and one question, “The only question is why can’t you see that?”
“Yeah I may have noticed that Fury has been unfair to Tony. I wanted to tell you guys sooner but wasn’t sure what to do.” Clint said
They all were beginning to sit around the dinner table to enjoy Bruce’s homemade chili. Tony pulled on Steve’s arm and told him to sit with him. His excuse being, “Hey if you made me come here you’re gonna have to keep me company.”
Steve sighed, “Tony come on, we are good friends. I know somethings wrong. What is it? Please tell me so I can fix it.”
“Yes, love. I promise I’m here, I’m real. I love you and we got you. Just hold on for a little bit longer and we will fix you up.” He said as he got the last cuff off Tony’s hand. “Don’t worry love you’re coming home.” He said thickly as his own tears fell down his cheeks, his expression hardened when he saw all of Tony’s injuries. But mostly Tony could only see love and relief.
Tony broke away, on account of needing to breathe and smiled hugely, making the corners of his eyes crinkle a bit when he was genuinely happy.
Could you blame him? These past two weeks he had pretty much been a slave and couldn’t even walk or move when he wanted. The whole ordeal was becoming infuriating. He was Iron Man, he was supposed to be strong!
“Oh Tony I know. It’s real to me too, besides I never put too much stock in the media.” He said, smiling.
Feeling a bit awkward and out of place, Steve just went for it, “Good morning Ms. Potts, and hi Tony.”
They talked more about nothing in particular as they ate. By the time they were finished it was evening. And they laid down next to each other to look at the stars.
“We heard about the explosion at the tower. We assumed you all made it out fine.” Fury said, a hint of concern in his words.
This is how, Bruce, Natasha, Tony and Steve ended up attending the fair in New York. They all played different games and it was nice to be silly, though Thor and Clint were missed.
“Wait. How did this go from not even having a second date to a relationship?” Steve asked in fake innocence.
“Oh please, could you be anymore obvious?” Clint said scoffing, “Anymore gooey eyes and I might actually vomit.”
“Tony it’s fine if we go now.” Steve said enthusiastically, “Besides we have team dinner and poker night tonight.” He smirked, clearly looking forward to beating them.
His eyes watered as he pictured it, however he shook his head to clear his thoughts. He needed to think straight and figure out a way to escape. In the meantime he hoped the Avengers were looking for him.
“Well look what we got here.” Donald said, “The bars are still yellow. I’d say it’s about twenty five percent charged.” He said clicking his tongue, “You still have a ways to go.”
His breathing quickened as he realized he was stuck here. God, he just wanted Steve. It was so childish and weak but all he wanted was Steve to rescue him and hug him.
One time, Steve couldn’t sleep so he made his way down to Tony’s workshop (he asked Jarvis if Tony was up) and then mumbled something about not being able to sleep.
Steve wrapped his arms tightly around Tony, “Oh Tony, I’m sorry. Sweetheart it’s okay, you have to look at that experience as you saving the world. I can never know what you experienced, but I do understand sacrificing everything so the world can live. You’re a hero. Don’t wear the wormhole as a chip on your shoulder, wear it as a badge of honor.” He kissed Tony. “And I’m terrified of leaving you and the team or losing you, but we all have each other. We can beat anything, and if we can’t, we will go down together.”
“We have,” Said Natasha, “We want to change his recommendation in his file and we are going to change his status from consultant to co-leader.”
Things at the tower had been going…well they had been going. The team had been getting along more and even had become closer in the time that had passed. Even still Tony decided to keep his distance, he didn’t want to become too attached. What with them being full time superheroes they were always in danger, besides anyone that Tony got close to always got hurt or ended up pushing him away. He thought idly back to his dating life with Pepper and his strained friendship with Rhodey. It wasn’t that they didn’t care about him, it was just that well... Tony was a handful at best and they...they came around when they could.
“Tony you needed to be here, to be present.” Pepper sighed, “I really don’t understand why you can’t see that.”
Tony was at the back near the bar, constantly keeping tabs on his team. Currently, Natasha and Bruce were on the dance floor, they were quite the pair, Clint was busy talking some potential donors and Thor was talking with Steve…and they were laughing. Tony didn’t know why that bothered him as much as it did.
Rhodey just rolled his eyes in reply, “Haha very funny Tones,” then he added, “Also, I knew because Pepper told me. We’ve been talking regularly, she keeps me updated on everything. I’m actually supposed to tell you to behave please. Things have been… complicated lately haven’t they?”
Tony just scoffed, “Wow Rogers, you come here and manage to get one of my bots to pick you as the favorite.” Tony said smiling, “What’s up Steve?”
Tony nodded his head and pulled away from Natasha. However a second later, he gripped Steve’s hand like a lifeline.
Steve had never left Tony’s side through the whole transfusion. He had been hoping and praying for a miracle. If Tony made it he vowed not to waste it. He would never take anything for granted again and he would be more romantic with Tony.
They smiled like idiots to each other and Clint just rolled his eyes, mumbling, “Jeez, can’t they just get a room already.”
“Sir that will take time, we won’t be able to figure all that out tonight. However I will get started on a program now.”
There are a few nights where they all huddle together in one massive clump, having  sleepover in the living room of the tower.
Later that night, Tony wandered out into the common area. He was so glad the team loved the gifts, he wanted to show them that he cared.
“No footage containing Donald Henderson at the tower, on or near the time of the explosion.” Jarvis reported.
“Tony what’s wrong? Did Pepper say something?” Steve asked as he sat them both on the couch. Interestingly enough he asked if Pepper said something, not if Tony had done something wrong.
When there was no reply, Tony quickly stood up. He was about to find the Avengers and get his suit when the wall to the workshop was blown to pieces.
“So on a scale from one to Loki, how disastrous do you think this night will go?” asked Happy, smirking. He obviously sensed Tony’s nervousness.
“Well there’s supposed to be this fair, it should be lowkey. I thought it would be fun to get out.” Bruce replied.
Tony melted him in after that. He looked up and Steve and smiled shyly, “I’m sorry about that, I don’t know what came over me.”
“Yeah,” Clint said, growing excited, “What if we give Tony some of Steve’s blood to help heal his heart, he’s a super soldier and one of his powers is super healing!”
The training session went great and by the end of it Tony was feeling much better. It felt good to do something right.
“Shit Steve!” Tony yelled bringing his hand up to his heart, “What did I tell you about wearing a damn bell?”
“Is it about the Hulk?” Natasha asked, “I’ve tried talking to him but he seems very light lipped about it.”
“Morning.” Tony replied shyly, grabbing Steve’s hand and then leaning in and kissing each other lightly on the mouth.
“It still is to an extent, I tend to be more private but I’ll support this cause as long as I am alive.”
“None of those files even say all the good Tony has done. And he can’t hold Tony to his past, he doesn’t with any of us.” Steve said.
“Well he sounds like a fine warrior but an even more honorable man.” Thor said resting his hand on Steve’s shoulder, “I’m sorry for your loss, Steve.”
He began to panic and cry as he realized he was in for another round of torture. He was beyond caring what Donald and Justin thought about him.
It had been four days since Steve left and Tony was missing him. He had busied himself with lab work but eventually came back up to the common area for food.
“Whatever.” Tony said hopping off the counter, “I guess I’ll just go down to the workshop and starve then.” He said smiling.
Apparently they had successfully managed to create a killer robot that was set to explode. That’s when Fury decided to call in the Avengers.
Steve couldn’t believe it. One that Hammer was alive but most importantly that they would find Tony, alive.
“There would be no Avengers without him.” Steve said, “Or at least we would be a shell of what we are now.”
“They will find me!” Tony shouted, “They’re smart, they will figure it out! You’re an idiot and so is Donald. That’s why you hate me right? You knew that I knew you were never good enough or smart enough.” Tony sassed.
He was taking a rare nap when he woke up screaming from a nightmare about Steve dying. He gasped for breath in bed and then got up to find Steve. He would feel better once he saw that he was okay.
As he went back up to the common room, he was vibrating with anticipation. He knew he needed to talk to Tony and explain.
Tony was completely terrified, he had never experienced anything like this. He wasn’t sure if he could take it, he needed Steve so badly.
Tony quickly lit up with a wicked grin, “Wait that is a wonderful idea.” He said with excitement, “Steve you have to pretend to quit, I mean Fury would totally shit himself and I could have Jarvis record his panic. Then I could use it for blackmail whatever he threatens to quick me off the team.” He said smiling.
“Well when we got you here, you had been hurt really badly. And the arc reactor… well it had been so damaged that it wasn’t working properly and the area around your chest was deeply bruised. Your heart was working triple time to keep you alive.” Bruce paused, taking a breath, “We didn’t have that many options but as a team we came up with a solution.” He looked around to the others, Tony noticed they were all smiling, “We decided to take some of  Steve’s blood and give it to you, in the hopes that it could heal the severe damage. And it looks like it worked better than we were hoping. The reason you don’t feel any pain now is because your injuries are all gone. The serum healed it all and you might end up with your own powers. We won’t know until the next few weeks, as the serum fully mutates your blood.”
“That doesn’t matter. Letting him die is not the way.” Steve said, in his full Captain America voice.
That night after the training session Steve and the rest of the Avengers-bar one Tony Stark-were in the common room.
“Let me take him” Thor said, walking up to Steve, “Bruce is ready back at the facility.” At Steve’s frown he added, “Please Steven, he needs treatment now and I can get him there in a matter of seconds.”
Tony just stared up at him, overwhelming happiness filling him up, “Well I’m glad I could help you Steve, you are aren’t so bad yourself.” He said teasingly.
“Hey I was trying to do something nice for him, he deserves it.” Tony said starting to get angry “Besides I deserve my own life.”
Before he could let the memory of Steve saying “I love you” to him play over in his mind, the wall furthest to him blew to pieces.
Once the weapon was finally finished, Tony felt like the life was sucked out of him. He couldn’t tell if he was imagining things or not but he felt as if the arc was short circuiting, it felt harder to breathe. Although that could be the emotional pain weighing him down as well.
“Oh Tony,” he said hugging him tighter, “I promise that I am not going anywhere, okay you are stuck with all of us.”
The whole group just rolled their eyes at that, there was no need to give Clint more ammunition by replying.
“In my defense I wasn’t down here looking to bother you. I was actually doing what you told me to do and trying to get some sleep.” He said looking down, “However life has different plans and I just can’t sleep without getting nightmares.” He said, running his hands through his hair and gripping it tightly.
Steve got up and hugged him, “This is absolutely incredible. You did not have to do this.” He said with a smile.
Tony laid back on the bed, even more dejected than before. He sighed and ran his hand over his face, he really couldn’t wait to get home.
Pepper just sighed, “I mean really Tony, you can’t even manage a company, I had to take over for you.”
“So I was thinking, that maybe the four of us could all go out and do something together?” Bruce said.
His breath caught when he felt his foot hit a hard rock. The road they were walking on was dirt but then he felt cement.
“Wow, of course I would want to!” Steve exclaimed, “I mean I was going to ask you the same thing pretty soon anyways but I would love too.” Steve said happily.
Steve winced and looked down, “Yeah… I lost a really good friend. He was my brother but not by blood.” Steve paused, “He died trying to save me.”
Steve rolled his eyes fondly, “Okay relax now, we are here.” He said pulling them both down to sit at the base of the tree.
“God Steve I never knew you could make Stark as old as you. You’re basically an old married couple now. Should we get you walkers for our next mission?” Clint asked.
They removed the chains from Tony’s wrists and ankles and brought him to a metal chair that was bolted to the floor. They cuffed his hands to the arms of the chair and his feet to the legs. As they did that Tony took stock of his surroundings, definitely a warehouse with… a lot of tools. He tried to suppress a shudder.
Steve dropped his hands to his sides, “Oh he was just telling me that Fury called him on a last minute mission, he was upset because tonight we agreed that he would be the first person to show me some movie called Wall-e? He says it’s the best Pixar film.”
As they made it to the elevator, Tony stopped and turned to Bruce, “Seriously though, thank you for everything.”
They all wrapped Tony in one giant hug, looking like one massive clump. Hugs were interesting with a super soldier, a hulk and a God in the mix.
“Don’t worry about it Steve, first one is free.” She smiled smoothly, “Besides it’s nice to play someone who poses an actual challenge to me.” She smirked.
“Tony love, don’t worry we are helping you. You are going to make it, I know you can do it. You just need to fight.”
Steve picked up a photograph, the one from when they went to the fair in New York. It brought tears to his eyes, “Don't worry love, I’ll find you. I promise.”
“Hey they’re Tones!” Justin said enthusiastically, “We are going to have so much fun together. As soon as my friend Donald is finished with you here, you are going to come live with me. And believe me, I’m nowhere near as nice as him.” He said, throwing an arm around Donald’s shoulder.
Tony flopped around in Steve’s hold, so that his front was pressed to Steve’s, “Thank you, for just being you.”
Tony also thought it would be easier to shop online but Steve insisted that they go out in person. Tony didn’t get why, especially when the paparazzi could spot them.
The event didn’t last very much longer after that and the Avengers all decided to go home. On the way Clint demanded a celebratory movie night.
Three more thrusts was all it took and Tony was cumming, “Steve!” He shouted, “I’m gonna—” and then he clenched around Steve with white hot cum splattering on his stomach as he cried out loudly in pure bliss.
He was waiting in the elevator going up to the common floor, he just wanted to go see Steve. Steve always made him feel better, even way before they became so close.
“Last night was… I can’t even put it into words, Tony.” Steve said, shaking his head, “I just…. have never felt so alive and I am the luckiest man on the planet to call you mine.”
“Wow Tony congratulations!” Justin yelled, obnoxiously. “You have helped Donald power his first weapon to destroy the Avengers.”
“Okay.” Fury said, “I’ll have our agents review security footage around the tower and we will have all hands on deck to get him back as soon as possible.” He said with finality.
“Thanks Rhodey.” Tony said, “So I was thinking we could go out to my favorite burger place-or wherever you want- and then we could come back here to catch up.” Tony said enthusiastically.
“The hardest part was knowing I was responsible for putting all of those people’s lives in harm's way, just because I was careless.” Tony said solemnly
Jarvis had pulled up a hologram, which showed a live feed of what the Avengers had just said about him.
“No it’s okay,” Pepper said. “Look I don’t know what Tony has told you but the long and short of it is that we need him to be more responsible and he feels as if he can act out however he wants.”
“Tony…” Steve sighed. “You have been through so much. And although I know you feel fine physically, it’s okay if you’re still not okay.”
“Well that’s not surprising, you have Steve’s serum and he has enhanced vision and hearing. We also think that you won’t get sick anymore just like Steve.” Bruce supplied.
Clint and Natasha had taken care of the guards and Hammer was dead. They all were on edge, not knowing what they were going to find in the warehouse. And there was still Donald to deal with.
He trashed on the table, his fingers reaching towards his arc, as if trying to touch the wires to take them out. He was trapped, stuck in an endless void of firey pain. God he couldn’t even pass out, he was forced to endure it.
After that they piled into the limo and before they knew it they were walking in front of a million flashing lights and into the building.
“No Tones it was my fault!” Rhodey said “I was trying to tell you something and it came off the wrong way, plus it was a stressful time for you.”
“Okay, okay Thor I need to breathe!” Tony said and Thor finally let go. Tony quickly tried to rid himself of his watery eyes at the nickname.
However nothing in life could be that simple, as he found his happiness in his new life he couldn’t help but feel that he was betraying his old one. He felt almost disloyal, by being happy in this new life and not being sad that his loved ones were gone.
“Tony it’s fine, I understand. It was childish and we weren’t sure how Fury was going to take it. It’s all good, no worries, we are fine.” He said smiling.
Tony lifted his faceplate up, “Easy, baby you have three broken ribs. You have to take slower breaths.” He said gently, grabbing Steve’s hand, “you’re going to be fine.”
At that moment, Tony and Bruce walked in the kitchen, Tony seemed to eyeing the two of them standing together, frowning.
“Please Donald make it stop!” He panted with a sweat slicked forehead, brown curls sticking to his face.
“Jarvis run everything we know about him now.” Steve commanded, “Maybe there’s some footage or a clue we could find.”
Steve ignored him, taking the cup and faking a sip, “Wooow Dum-E this is delicious, great job!” Steve smiled.
“You’ll know why we need this for later.” Donald smiled as he walked out of the room taking Tony’s blood with him.
Tony was working away in the lab as per usual. He finally was able to finish the stabilizer and then he emailed Pepper.
Tony was still bolted down to the table. He had no idea what to do, everyone thought he was dead. No one was looking for him, or coming for him.
“Tony, when I came out of the ice I felt like I had lost everything.” Steve said sadly “By you being such a caring friend, giving us a place to live, updating our tech and spending time with us-with me, you gave me a place to call home, you helped me feel alive again.” Steve said smiling at the end, “Yinsen would be so proud of you.”
He took in deep breaths and then whispered out, “I still hope you find me Steve… I love you… please come find me, I know you can.”
“Tony go help Thor and see if there are any civilians in the building. Your suit can detect heat so please go.” Steve said.
Tony hadn’t gotten to hangout with Steve for a few days and it was starting to affect his mood. Whenever he wanted to hangout with Steve something always came up. The one time he managed to find Steve alone, he was on the phone with Thor. A phone call-may he just add-that lasted hours. As much as he wanted to he mad, he knew Steve deserved the best. He saw how happy Steve got when he received a message from Thor.
“Rhodey!” Tony said, Immediately going to hug his friend. Yes they had fought, but he was still one of Tony’s oldest friends.
A few minutes later Steve went back upstairs. He was greeted with the sight of Thor and Natasha on the couch and Steve and Tony making popcorn in the kitchen.
“Don’t you dare ever do that to me again.” Justin spat out, “Why do you think the Avengers aren’t already here? It isn’t as if we are hard to find! They just don’t want you around, they are probably relieved we took you. Now they don’t have to deal with you.”
“Of course Doctor Banner, however I feel that everything will be alright.” He said, sounding pleased.
“It’s not even just that.” Said Natasha, “I know how good of a person he is. He just cares so much, but people don’t bother to look behind the mask.”
“Now Tony, as you know I no longer need you.” Donald sighed, “So I’ll be giving you over to Justin. In order to make this transition as smooth as possible we have to make sure no one will be looking for you anymore.”
“No Tony it’s nothing serious,” Steve hesitated before adding, “It’s more of a ‘thank you for everything that you do for us’.” Steve said looking down, cheeks tinted pink.
Tony smiled and handed Thor his gift, “Here you go Point Break. It’s an old Japanese hammer. It has a dragon carved into the head and I had the handle carved in with your title in it.” He said, “Hope you like it big guy.”
Tony finally let it all out, the devastation, the frustration, the relief and love. He cried his heart out and Steve was there to hold him through it all. He let Tony fall only to be there to catch him. A solid reassurance of love.
Whether or not Hammer was telling the truth, Tony knew he couldn’t risk it. Not until he found the control to the bomb. He closed his eyes as Hammer began to remove the gag.
“Wow that sounds wonderful Tony. Can I ask why you weren’t with Howard and Maria? I pictured you having grand Christmas celebrations.”
“Glad to have your approval.” Tony said dryly, getting up. “Oh and by the way I’m the one who made the first move so you pay up to Natasha or you can have her come for you. I’m fine with either option.” Tony smiled.
“Steve! You’re back.” Tony exclaimed, walking towards him and kissing him on the mouth. “You look exhausted.” He said concerned.
Steve walked towards Tony until he was right in front of him. Tony glanced up at him, a cross between confused and uncomfortable.
He tried to shake himself out of the rapidly downhill train of thought but he just couldn’t, as if he needed another reminder of why he was a failure and a burden.
Once they sat down, Tony immediately began playing footsie. They both played around until Tony finally took a bite of the burger.
“Well, um, I just want to start off by saying no pressure and technically you already live with me in the tower, but uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to move in with me? Like in my room, I mean we can share a room that is…?” Tony trailed off, nervous.
“Why would you do that?” Tony asked “Neither of you have a clue of what to do.” He said crossing his arms.
Well everyone but Clint who waited until everyone was seated and then jumped on top of all of them so that he managed to lay across them.
Tony’s head snapped up in excitement, “Seriously??? I’ve been dying for those.” His grip around Steve tightened.
After they had managed to somewhat clear the park of mud Thor and Steve were laughing hysterically at what just happened. Even Steve has a sense of humor, at it was nice to make memories with his new family.
“I have a thing about names, the way that guy spoke to Stark...it rubbed me the wrong way, not just because he was rude.” He said.
A few minutes later Natasha walked in. “Cap, What are you up to?” She asked, sitting down next to him on the couch.
“Tony that is no way to speak to the future owner.” Justin said coldly. He took something from his pocket, looking at Donald, “May I?” He asked.
Steve was having none of it however because he quickly cupped Tony’s face, “Tony it’s okay, I want this.” He murmured and quickly joined their two faces.
Steve instantly raced to the medical facility  where he found Bruce walking out of one the operating room.
Steve found out that Tony was an excellent piano player and had even written some of how own music. He said it was because his mom had spent whatever time she could to teach him. She also taught him to speak Italian.
Steve sat at the kitchen table sketching, it was one of those nights. The clock read 3:15 am and Steve sighed, time seemed to be moving incredibly slow.
“Wait a minute, the last time I went to SHIELD I noticed they had Stark tech.” He said realization dawning, “Does he demand you make tech for him? Does he pressure you with the threat of being kicked off?” His question was practically rhetorical.
“I don’t take anyone for granted.” Murmured Tony, “You know what I have to go, I need some rest, I’ll talk to you later Rhodey.”
“I’m so glad we are doing this, I know it will mean a lot to Tony.” Bruce said smiling gently, “I know the big guy will be happy to support.”
Just think of Steve, he thought. He pictured Steve and him kissing on the couch. He pictured them shopping for furniture for the tower. He pictured Steve’s face when he said he loved him for the first time.
One night Steve and Thor bake a triple layer  chocolate cake for everyone to eat at 2 am… or more like they attempt and Bruce rescues them.
“Hammer carved their initials in my stomach and then… they played a recording of you guys. Supposedly after the explosion. In it you said… you said you hated me and the Avengers would be better if without me. Everyone else didn’t want to save me either. Natasha said I was too broken to be fixed.” He sobbed, “They made me think you guys were glad I was gone.” He cried.
Steve hated the idea of fighting aliens again, especially without his whole team. Since he and Tony got together, he worried about the other man even more. Despite his feelings he promised himself that he wouldn’t change the way he treated him on the field. It was a tough promise to keep but he knew it would be better in the long run.
As Tony entered the living room a twinge of doubt twisted his gut. He could hear the ghost of his Father’s voice telling him he wasn’t good enough, specifically that Captain America would even find him to be a disappointment.
“I thought he was okay, then I got to know him.” Steve said, “He’s just a pathetic excuse of a hero. The only reason he’s on our team is for the money, I hate him. I’m glad I don’t have to do that stupid conference.” Tony’s heart stuttered at that… could Steve really think that?
“He’s more than earned it. And he has the support of me and the big guy.” Bruce said, smiling wickedly.
“They are archaic and a disgrace.” Tony said dramatically, “Besides, you’re dating me now and that comes with the bonus of having the best designer brands at your disposal.”
He was already on edge due to stupid board members talking out of their asses, having being forced to be polite was not something Tony particularly enjoyed.
Tony frowned at that, in order to change that subject he said, “So Steve, I just wanted to let you know that I’m working on a code to disable bombs that will be part of my suit. I was working on it last night.”
“Well it sounds to me that Pepper is frustrated with you because she feels like you aren’t doing what she’s asking, but she isn’t going to the effort to see what you’re schedule is like outside of SI. You all need to sit down and talk, trust me Tony they love you and care about you, if they didn’t then they wouldn’t have stuck by you all these years.” Steve said planting a kiss to Tony’s temple.
“Maybe it would be more humane for him.” Bruce tried to justify, “If he woke up and realized he had to stay in bed forever—”
“Mmm” Tony hummed, then pulled Steve in for a deep kiss. When they pulled away they both spoke at the same time,
“Masks or not, I know I would die for my brother of Iron.” Thor said putting a hand to his chest. The rest of the Avengers all agreed they would do the same.
When they let go Tony said, “Steve, this is the first time in a long time that anyone has been this thoughtful and caring towards me. The paintings are beautiful, I’m going to keep them in my workshop and room. Thank you so much.” Tony said while looking right at him, smiling widely.
Tony didn’t reply and that was all the confirmation Steve needed. He was about to march over to Fury himself and show him the wrath of Captain America when Tony stopped him and grabbed his arm,
They were all huddled in the common room trying to figure out a game plan. Even though they doubted it, part of them still held hope that Tony could be alive. The one thing they managed to do was get Jarvis back online.
“Okay fine Tony. Why haven’t you told me that you’ve been working on the energy stabilizer for SI?” She asked, “There is no communication! Why haven’t you learned how to balance your time and tell me what’s going on? It’s like you intentionally try to make things harder than they need to be.” Pepper said, angrily, “You need to learn that there are things that come before you. Stop being so selfish all the time and realize you can’t do whatever you want whenever you want.” And with that she walked away.
Tony felt like shit to say the least. This is why he wanted to go at night, he knew the paparazzi would catch them and this is what he wanted to avoid.
A few minutes later Rhodey and Pepper walked into the common room. They sat down across from Steve and Tony on the couch.
“I’m not sure you’ll even like this, but here goes.” Then Steve pulled out two paintings and handed them to Tony.
After that Steve went up to shower and then started to cook his team breakfast in the communal kitchen. He wasn’t sure if Tony would be back in time for it but he wanted to do something nice for his team no matter how small. Back before the serum his family was always doing things for him, he wanted a chance to give back, even if he couldn’t give to them directly. As he was finishing up pancakes members of the team began to make their way down, the smell of food being too good to resist.
Tony was miserable in Japan. Meetings were a bore, but what’s worse was that things were strained as ever between him and Pepper. Tony wanted to fix it but he didn’t know how.
“Yeah, Rogers no need to apologize. How about we just forgive and forget.” Tony said in a dismissive tone. When Steve didn’t move Tony looked back up, “Listen Cap, as much as I would love to chit chat right now I can’t, I have loads of work to finish.”
