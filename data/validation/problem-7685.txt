“Don't,” Steve said. He stood, coming to his feet slowly and deliberately. He looked up at Tony, and a spark of life was back in his eyes now. “I understand why we're doing this. I know it has to happen. But if you try to publicly take the blame for this behind my back-”
"Why are there bowls involved, do you like dirtying dishes, what purpose would-" Tony started, and Steve glanced at him, his face so full of affection that the words died unsaid in Tony's throat.
He looked at Obie.  “I know you loved my father.  Maybe more than I did, because, after all, you knew him better than I did,” he admitted.  “And you’ve always done your best to protect his memory, his legacy.  And I appreciate that, I do.”
"I don't see any reason to get up," Tony said, his eyes sliding closed.  "The floor is my-" He waved a hand through the air.  "This is a good floor.  It's cool here.  Comfortable."
Steve stepped into the hall, pulling the bedroom door shut behind him.  He was on his second lap of the house and his third of the grounds.  He was going stir crazy, and every time he looked at the walls that surrounded the property, he felt that same prickle of unease.
Steve stared down at her, weighing his options, and from behind him, Bobbi sighed.  “We know where you live,” she said.  “And you might’ve noticed that Happy and Hawkeye have vanished.  They’re the back up.  In case you do something stupid.”
Tony's head bobbed in something like a nod, and his fingers fumbled at the hem of his shirt.  “Okay,” he said, the word pulled like taffy from his lips, slow and sweet.  Before Steve could stop him, he stripped the t-shirt over his head, the fabric sliding over his skin.  The shirt fluttered to the floor, and Tony leaned back, his back arching as he ran a hand through his hair.
“Drink your tea.”
Rhodey’s eyes went wide.  “Ah.  Right.”  He set the coffee cup down in front of him, the movement careful.  “That.”
“You need an intervention,” Jess said, now going through her phone with one hand and Carol’s with the other.
“Can you hold this for me?” he asked, with a smile.  “I can come back tonight with-”
“Don’t line up,” Tony agreed.  He gestured at the screen and if Steve turned his head just the smallest amount, he’d be able to kiss Tony’s neck, and that way lay madness.  He stared straight ahead, hands braced on his thighs, shoulders a hard line.
“We don't have time for this,” Tony pointed out.  He glanced at his watch.  They  100 percent did not have time for these games.  “Seriously.  Pep.  Can I just-”
“Ah, yes.  Scapegoat.  How could I have forgotten?” Jarvis said.  “We shall lock him in the basement until you have a disaster that he can absorb for you.”
Fury gave him a level look.  “More than we can handle.”
Clint grinned at him, his hands tucked in his pockets, a black overnight bag thrown over one shoulder.  “Sorry,” he said.
“Right, I don’t-”
“We could elope,” Phil said, and that was a stupid thing to say, that was not the direction he wanted the conversation to go in, especially when Clint burst out laughing.  Phil scowled at him.  “I fail to see the humor here.”
Nakia tipped a look in his direction.  “Your Majesty, your negotiations have been attempted under less than ideal circumstances.”
“If you want us to just watch the movie, I'll make her, it's okay if you want to be left alone, DJ.” Franklin turned to face the tv, politely giving DJ some privacy.  “We're happy to just be here with you.  It's...”  His voice trailed away.  “Home's hard now.”
"Twenty-four ounces," Jan said.
There was a long pause.  “Fair enough,” Tony said.
“He's a very busy man,” Tony explained to the gathered crowd.  “You should see his calendar.  It's-”
Left on his own, Steve shifted the shield higher onto his shoulder.  It was lighter than his old one, but it fit just as well against his back, a comforting, centering weight.   A well-dressed man brushed past him, barely sparing him a glance, and Steve stepped out of the way.
“The same thing that’s happening now,” Tony said.   He shrugged. “For all intents and purposes, Pepper’s been running the company for years.”
Light flickered around her fingertips, like sparks falling from a child’s sparkler.  She stepped around Harris, her hand coming up, and he couldn’t look away from her fingers.  The light seemed to settle on his skin, in his eyes, on his lips.  It was…
“Steven Grant Rogers!”
“Are we done?” Darcy asked, gnawing on the end of her churro.  “We’re supposed to meet back up in like-”
“And that’s why he cares.” Tony pushed himself away from the truck.  “Sure, he can put on a mean face when staring down a six term Republican senator who cut funding for school lunches three terms in a row-”
Attempt twenty-nine.
“Thor and Hulk are assisting with the clean-up,” Coulson said, his voice expressionless.   “If you'd like to help, we can-”
“Thor has taken Jane and Darcy back to Asgard for a visit,” Jarvis said.
"It's a good plan," Steve agreed.  "Rock solid plan, that."
“Would I what?” Steve asked.  “Lie to Jan for you?  Not if it means I’m stuck at this thing by myself.”
“I will have you know that I’m the absolute soul of discretion,” Tony told her.  “Any secrets you may have heard from me are my own, and that just makes them funny, self-depreciating stories.”
“You shouldn’t be late to dinner,” Obie said, refilling his glass.  “It’s disrespectful, Anthony.”
Jesse took the picture out of her hand and held it out in front of her.  "Look closer," she said.  She braced a hand on the edge of the bed, her short hair falling forward over her forehead.  "Look at the goatee."
Harris opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “For…  Who, exactly?” he asked carefully.
“No.”  DJ’s voice came floating down the hallway.  “Gonna charge.”
“I had a budget,” Tony said.  “And I ignored it.”
"You're the equipment," Jan said to him.  Clint's mouth opened.  Then closed.  His head dipped in a slightly drunken nod, and held out a hand.
“Tony?”
“No,” Tony said, holding the box out of reach. “Not a chance.  I ordered half the damn menu, find something else.”
He didn’t have to ask who ‘he’ was.  Steve took a deep breath, ignoring the way his chest ached.  “He sent you.”
“That's my oldest friend,” Steve said, rolling onto his stomach.  Naked except for his socks and shorts, he folded his arms under his chin, grinning at Tony.  “I'm going to consider Sam my 'best friend.'”
“It's only 'not a reception' when Tony is listening, I see no point in pretending otherwise,” Jan told her.  To Steve, she said, “You don't HAVE to dance, I'm not going to force you into a first dance or anything like that, not unless you want to, honey.”
“Jan,” he said, amused despite himself.
Steve rolled to the edge of the bed, doing his best not to jostle Tony any more than was absolutely necessary.  “Stay here,” he said.  “I’ll get the coffee going.”
The sound of chair legs scraping across the polished floor snapped Tony out of his thoughts.  He looked up as DJ hopped off of his chair.  “And where are you going?” he asked, as DJ collected his pad of paper.
“And this time, I figured I’d be ready.”  He met Tony’s eyes, his chin up.  “Staying in New York would’ve been too risky.  But I have some savings.  Enough to get us started somewhere else.”
“Gotcha.”  Another rattle of keys.  “Off the record, though?  I agree with you.”
“We know,” Steve said.  “But-”
“It's Steve,” he said.  And then, just in case, “Steve Rogers?”
“Afternoon, Pepper.  What's, uh, what's going on?”
Tony pressed a hand to his face.  “Why do I need to be presentable?” he asked, because he wasn’t quite willing to let go of his petulance just yet.  “He’s the one who left.  Let him try to win his way back into my good graces.”
Natasha looked down.  Bruce was hovering at the base of the wall, his shoulders almost up against the stone.  He peered around a neatly trimmed bush, and backed up a little further, trying to stay out of sight.  He glanced up at Natasha and Bobbi.  “What, what is he doing?” he repeated, his voice tense.
Steve leaned over, his fingers gentle on the line of Tony's jaw.  “On you, it works,” he said, making Tony laugh.  “Here.  Sit up.”
“Shoot it,” Clint said, and Phil struggled to keep a straight face.
“I'm going to end up in jeans and a t-shirt,” Jessica said.  “The same as any other day.”
“You don’t have to do-”
“I’ll stop by Sam’s truck on our way across the road and see if he’s up for a drink, but I don’t need you setting up playdates, thank you,” Tony said. “Besides, any benefit that we might get from Sam’s presence will be immediately negated if Bucky’s hanging around looking for leftovers.”  He braced a hand on the counter.  “Add Bucky to the mix and we might as well hire a PR firm right now.”
“That's so clearly a lie I can't even bother to mock you for it,” Tony said.  He wrapped the towel around his waist and stomped towards the closet door.  “Remind me to keep a suit of armor in here for future disasters, Jay.”
Steve paused in the act of sitting down.  “Good?”
“And I don’t hear you objecting, so I’m guessing you do, too,” Steve said.
Bucky blinked hard, turning his face towards the fire.  “Wasn’t going to cry,” he said, his voice rough.  “I just…  Want to remember.”  He pressed a hand to his eyes, going quiet for a moment.  Steve stared him down, unmoved.  Bucky peeked at him from between his fingers. “I just think hearing the story might help.”
Returning to the prep station, he set it down, pulling the lid off.  Thank God he’d prepped.  Because right now, he wasn’t capable of doing much more than combining a few already prepared ingredients.  He collected a plate from the stack at his station, the perfect, gleaming white canvas, and reached for the bottle of puree.
Steve laughed.  “Garlic bread,” he said, the words breathy.  “Che-” Tony's thigh slid between his, and the word died with a stutter of breath.  His hips jerked forward, and he tried again. “Cheesy garlic bread.”
“Yes, well, neither do you, so I don't know why we're focusing on me here, we both know I'm a disaster, so-” He turned off the flame with a flick of his wrist.  “I'll text him, and then you can go guilt him into actually showing up, because you know he's not going to do it for me, he hates these kind of things.”
He was warm.
“No.”  Tony tried to glare at him, but it was hard, it was so hard, because it was Steve, smiling down at him like Tony was something remarkable.  It was Steve, with his laughing blue eyes and his flushed cheeks and a dusting of flour across his skin.  It was Steve and that was all that mattered.  Tony pushed himself upright.
“I really can,” Bruce said.  “It's, uh, it's remarkably effective.”
“Yes,” DJ said, his voice vibrating with the force of that one word.
Steve huffed out a breath.  "Right."  He grabbed the seatbelt and buckled Tony in, and gave the belt a pat.  "There.  Let's see you get out of that."
Another beat.  “You don’t have any idea who I am, do you?”
"Yeah, the flu's a bitch, isn't it?" Steve said.  He slid his arms under Tony's arms, and braced his feet.  "Okay, up we go."
“Many, many stiff cups of tea,” Pepper said.  “And the occasional box of Swiss chocolates.”
“Understandable,” Bucky said.  His bowl was empty and he was just sitting, an easy smile on his face, his arms folded on the table.
“Where's the kid?” Tony twisted around.  “DJ!  Where-”
“Love you,” DJ said.
“Uh-huh, and the rest of us probably wouldn’t be very happy with that,” Steve pointed out.  “So is there anything you’d like to eat for dinner tonight that we haven’t eaten in the last, let’s say…  Five days?”
“Yeah?  Me, too,” Clint said, scanning the walls, hoping for a door that might lead to an access tunnel, or at the least, a reinforced utility room.  “Bad home life?”
“Ah, of course,” Okoye said, her head bobbing in a nod.  “And what will we be using this vacation to do?”
“Steve knows what I mean,” she said, and Sam looked at Steve.
“Oh!” Pepper pulled up short, her face splitting in a bright smile.  “Steve! How're you-”
Steve was silent for a long moment, just taking in the full ridiculousness of the situation.  "I don't even know where to start with this," he said, bracing his hands on the back.  "I don't...  I don't even."
Tony frowned.  "I know that name, why do I know that-"
“Don’t give him the phone.”  The woman’s voice again, and it sounded familiar, but the connection wasn’t good enough for Steve to identify it.  “I’d like to live through the day.”
“Yeah, well, why are you on my couch, I have a guest bedroom, I’m, like, 90% sure I have a guest bedroom here,” Tony said.  “Got a bed and everything.”
“Hey, we don't-” Tony started, and both women ignored him.
Trip smiled, and Steve took a deep breath, his chest aching.  “May your love lead you ever on, may it provide a safe harbor in turbulent seas, may it provide warmth in the depths of winter, and may it be the light that guides you home in the darkest night.”
"Look." O'Brien stabbed the cigar against the ash tray, his mouth taking on a sarcastic smile.  "Stark's a shining beacon that any man can make it in this cold, cruel world we live in, Rogers.  You got enough gumption, and enough smarts, and you can drag yourself out of the gutter and out to a mansion on Long Island."  He slumped back into his chair.  "Makes sense that the communists and anarchists would want him dead, don't it?"
The words were almost inaudible, but they were enough.  Enough to remind Tony that he wasn't here for himself.  He was here because Steve needed him.  Because Steve was in pain, was suffering.
Jan’s cheeks puffed out.  “It’s not going to work.”
“Traitor,” Tony said, but some of the strain had gone out of his voice.
Peter made a grab for the book.  “Actually, I think I should just study quietly.  On my own.”
“Coffee,” Tony repeated.
Obie waved him off.  “Yes.  That would be important.”  He considered Tony over the top of his glass.  “Did you finish the repairs to the smokehouse?”
“Dude, I've heard a lot about you, and you seem sketchy, honestly.” Eli dug a mug out of the cabinet next to the gleaming, massive fridge.  “'Sides, I don't trust any man around Steve's pastry.”
"Yeah, but you can't pull off hers."  There was a pause, then, "You okay?" Tony asked, his voice soft, and Steve looked up at him.
“I haven’t told him that you’re taking lessons from Doctor Strange, that’s dangerous enough for me,” Steve said.  He stood, collecting the empty plate.  “You’ll be home for dinner?”
Shuri rocked forward in her seat, her spoon sweeping through the air.  “So.  The first mistake was letting him into the city at all.  I tried to warn them, I want that noted.  That we have strict rules about letting outsiders into Wakanda, and those rules are in place for a reason.”
Phil gave him a look.  “Are we hungry?”
“I’m leaving both of you by the side of the road, I swear to God I am,” Tony grumbled.
Rhodey stood.  “Once.  Just once.  Can we go small?”  He crossed the room and lowered himself down onto the couch next to Tony.  “How're we doing?”
“Challenge accepted,” he said.
“You have got to find some chill, girl.”
Slowly, carefully, Tony forced himself to his feet, his hands braced on top of his desk as he forced his knees to lock into place.  He hadn’t drank much.  Enough.  But maybe not enough.  For now, Obie wanted him alive.  Wanted him alive until he’d gotten the signatures he needed.  The longer Tony could stall, the better off he’d be.
“Oh.” Tony leaned back in his chair, one hand cradling the back of DJ’s head. “Are you surrendering, then?”
“Tell me he's not going after him,” Coulson said, and he sounded exhausted.  He rubbed his forehead.  “Please.  Someone tell me that.”
She watched him, her face unreadable.  Tony made a horrible, frustrated sound, half growl, half scream.  “Just-  Just GET OUT.”
“Ignoring you now.  The main buffet will be set up in the formal dining room, snacks, drinks and desserts will be in the living room,” Jan continued.  “The media room will be set up with a rotation of holiday specials and movies, and Jarvis has the ‘on demand’ requests ready to go.  Please check the floor plan that’s in your packet, and be prepared to move any personal affects out of the ‘splash zone,’ or don’t complain if something ends up being used as a chair which shouldn’t be.”
He looked back.  “We have other avenues of assistance.”
“He moved in yet?” Pepper asked.
“We’re going to get him back, Tony.”  He let go of Tony’s arm, his hand falling away with great amounts of reluctance, and he grabbed the strap of his shield instead, his fingers locking in place.  Without another word, he slipped out the front door, doing a quick check of the hall before he let Tony follow him.
The boy stared at her, big dark eyes curious under the tumbled mop of dark curls.  He was barefoot, his shoes tied together by the laces and thrown over his shoulder.  The ragged cuffs of his too-short pants ending well above his bony ankles, his shirt was torn at the hem.  His fingers, dark with dirt, clung to the ragged wood of windowframe, and as she watched, he swayed back and forth, finding his balance against the side of the building.  But his gaze never broke from hers, his dark eyes unblinking as he studied her, as if confused by her presence.
She gave Isaiah a faint smile.  “He’s going to ruin that nice suit of his.”
Martin Morrison's voice preceded him into the room by about two minutes. By the time he caught up to his bombast, everyone was staring in the direction of the door. He was, Steve admitted, a handsome figure of a man, everything sharp and clean, from his well-cut hair to the tips of his polished shoes. He barely glanced in their direction.
DJ nodded.  “Yes,” he said, his head falling onto Steve’s shoulder.
Jesse sighed.  “I haven't even clicked 'send' yet, Ellen.”
Phil gave up.  “Agent Barton,” he said, folding his hands on his desk in front of him, and Clint’s eyebrows arched.  Phil ignored that.  “What is the SHIELD rule about interdimensional or temporal incursions?”
DJ considered that, his head tipping to the side.  After a moment of weighty silence, he looked back at Tony.  "Good."
Tony grinned at her.  “I could start reciting poetry, if you’d like, but it’s not going to work.”
“No.  You're not.  Because we're going to do everything possible to make sure you're not,” Pepper said.  She glanced back at Rogers.  “At the very least, maybe he'll make someone think twice about trying again.”
“And that’s something I always support,” Steve said.  “I just like to…” He gave Tony a lopsided smile.  “Be there to support it.”
"Yeah, but they took all the points with them," Ellen said, wiggling her fingers at him as she headed for the elevator. "Gonna take your money."
“It certainly can’t hurt.”  Obie stood. “Tony. You’re not taking this seriously.”
“The USPS wants us to do everything now,” Tony said.  “I mean.  Pure laziness.”
“I’m going to say words no one has ever said in this bar, and which no one ever expected to hear from me,” Clint said, leaning back on his chair.  “Do you get CSpan?  And can we watch it?”
He looked up, and Harris looked worried.  DJ tried to smile.  “Loud,” he said.  And that wasn’t enough.  He brought his hands up, covering his ears, and then dropped them back down.  “Everything.  Is loud.  And…”  His fingers fluttered, and he forced them still, flat, on the top of his legs.  “Too much.”
“Does this... Happen to you a lot?”
“Tony.”  A hand grabbed his, fingers tangling together.  “Tony.  It’s Rhodey.  It’s Rhodey.  Look at me.  You’re safe.  Tony.”
Isaiah shrugged.  “Most of the time, you don’t.”
Steve's arm clamped around Tony's waist with a speed and a force that Tony hadn't thought was possible.  In a second, he went from standing on his own to being pinned against Steve's chest, his feet barely on the ground.  "Hi," he whispered, amusement sweeping over him.  "What're we doing?"
“Honestly,” Steve said, rubbing a hand on the back of his neck, “I find not much can shock me any more.”  It was a lie, but one he'd grown comfortable with.  “Still...  Let's not do this right now, okay?”
“Enjoying myself,” he said, his lips hovering just over Tony’s.  Tony laughed, and Steve brushed a kiss against his jaw, his neck.  He let go of one of Tony’s wrists, and Tony didn’t even bother putting his arm back down.  Steve slid his hand along Tony’s chest, down towards the waistband of his trousers.
"A common reaction to the very special decorating aesthetic around these parts," Tony said, amused.  He scrubbed a hand over his face.  "Do you like your room?  It's...  Better."
In the babble of words that followed, Tony met DJ’s eyes in the rearview mirror.  DJ smiled, a game, struggling smile, but a smile nonetheless.  Tony smiled back.  “You okay?” he mouthed.
"There is nothing wrong with my shorts," he said, and he was trying not to smile now.  Trying, and mostly failing.  "Get off."
"Sir-"
“Right,” DJ said, and headed for the stairs at a run.
“He can do better,” Steve said.
“No,” Steve bit out.  The locker room was empty, and he was grateful for that small mercy.  Sam ducked around him, and Steve jerked to a stop.  He took a deep breath, and let it out from between clenched teeth.  “Sam.  I'm about to go hit something, as hard as I possibly can, and if you don't want it to be you, I'd suggest you back the hell off.”
Steve stepped into the doorway, shield up and at the ready.
“We'll discuss it,” she said, even as Steve grabbed Tony's hand, dragging him into the dance line.
Steve looked up at him, and some of the pinched, tired look was gone from his face.  “What can go wrong?” he asked, with a ghost of a smile.
Tony's fingers flexed against his chest, the tips sliding across the fabric, and the skin beneath, and it was barely a touch, barely contact.  But the intimacy of it, the way Tony leaned in, the way his head tipped to the side, his lips open, his breath warm on the angle of Steve's jaw, on his cheek, and he was losing his mind.
Tony folded the bills and dropped them in the box, earning himself a pleased smile and a nod from the woman.  Steve reached out and took a black mask from the boy.  “Thank you.” Tony reached around him, taking a red one with glitter swirls along the edges.  “Subtle.”
“Are we invited?” Rhodey asked, shutting the notebook.
“That's right.  You're not.”  Sam reached for his backpack.  He reached into the front pocket and came up with a red, white, and blue silly straw.  Sam dropped it into the water cup with a flourish.  “Ta-da!”
Tony did his best to slow him down, just purely for the pleasure of it, nuzzling his neck and kissing the line of his throat, moving down to his collarbone.  “Bed,” Steve mumbled against Tony’s hair, determined and distracted all at once.
“Trouble,” she agreed, giving him a kiss on the forehead.  “Go ahead, Steve, you can get changed in the powder room there on-”
He stepped back with a nod.  “There.  Now, that we’ve taken care of that…” The young man stepped back towards the middle of the shop, making a magician’s pass with his fingers.  “I can fix this.”
“Yeah, that's the number one Yelp review I get,” Steve said.  Just in case it was more booze and less food, he fished a bottle of water from the cooler under the counter.  “Here.  On the house.”
“Sure, but when food is your-  When it’s that central, you are full of associations.”  He held up the croissant.  “You didn’t learn to make these from a book.”
Steve spun to face the new threat, his shield coming up in front of him.  The man who stepped out of the shadows was tall and lean, dressed in an expensive looking coat and well-tailored suit.  The fog swirled around his polished shoes, and one gloved hand reached up, adjusting the angle of his hat.
“Merry Christmas,” he repeated, and he entered the building at a pace that absolutely wasn't a run.
Tony choked on a laugh.  "Right.  Right."  He pointed the screwdriver at DJ again.  "No."
“But she’d bet on her employer?” Tony asked, trying to work up some indignation about that..
“Okay, or-”
She blinked up at Steve, black lashes sweeping over golden eyes.  “You’re the one he talks to.  Everyone else talks to him, but you’re-  You’re the only one he really talks to.” She smiled.  “You’re the one he trusts.”
“I thought we threw those away,” Steve said. To Jesse, he added, “I'll email you.”
“The legal kind,” she said, one boot heel bouncing against the floor.  “So.  No.  I can’t.”  She looked up.  I do have a question, though.”  She looked at Tony.  “How did he end up here?”
“You are full of terrible lies, I know you are, but yes, please tell me you have something with a lemon curd,” Pepper said, and Jess held out a plate to her, filled with tiny tarts.
“Don’t know what you mean,” Tony said.  He took a sip of water.  “Your father hasn’t found a way for me to take your tests.”  He paused.  “Yet.  But I suppose necessity is the mother of invention, so-”
“It’s entirely possible,” Clea said with a bright smile.  The pages ripped free of the spine with a sound like a scream.  She tossed them cheerfully over her shoulder.  “I’m rather hoping he’ll find Wong.”
“A couple of months, we'll figure out a time when it's convenient, and make sure we're on the low ebb of the news cycle, and Marcy'll take care of the rest,” Tony said. He kept his voice brisk. Businesslike. “Until then, you can stay in the penthouse, if you like, and-”
work well together. They’d made it through more than half of the documentation from Wakanda already, and Tony had been incredibly effective at translating some of the more poetic and technical materials into language that Steve understood.
The Avengers await the coming storm while Tony re-discovers his hatred of mornings. (Well, most mornings.)
“But not you,” Coulson said shrewdly.
“I’m keeping her,” Tony decided. “We’ll be in the lab. Come get us at five.”
I'm hoping to get some AskStrange responses posted tonight too, so feel free to keep those questions for the Doctor coming!
“Sure,” Tony shrugged.
Bemused to find himself trembling slightly, Steve slid a mitt onto his right hand. It was covered in soft grey fur on one side, while the other was covered in sensuous suede punctuated by rubber nubs. He started with the furry side, running it gently up and down the sculpted mass of muscle that was Thor’s shoulders, chest and abdomen. Thor moaned, eyes opening to a wideness that looked almost painful.
“STARK!” Taskmaster spat, casting his eyes around the room in a panicked attempt to locate the ‘real’ Iron Man amidst a sea of nearly identical armours. Seconds later, he found Tony himself leaning against the bar in jeans and a Captain America tee shirt, entirely unharmed. (Steve breathed his own sigh of relief at the sight. Knowing that this Tony didn’t need the arc reactor to keep his heart functioning safely hadn’t made it any less unnerving to watch someone take it from him.) Taskmaster made to move in, but in seconds Tony had tapped the glowing reactor on his chest; while the Bleeding Edge armour emerged to cover him, those same crescent-shaped shields Tony had used so effectively during his little showcase in the gym encircled his enemy, sparking menacingly. Next to Steve, Natasha stepped out of her own armour, her Widow’s Bites trained unerringly on Taskmaster’s jugular.
“Alright, who had ‘Steve gets distracted from the issue to rant about the amorality of class-discrimination?’ Everybody else pay up!” Money was exchanged with a hefty dose of good-natured grumbling, as it often was on movie nights. Tonight the pot went to Coulson, who always bet on the most idealized version of Steve. Bucky, loose-limbed and content after going down for Natasha the previous evening, was in the middle of calling Steve a communist when it happened.
Thank you, as always, for your comments and kudos. They mean the absolute world to me.
“Then it’ll be a thousand and one. I’ll be in the front, on the right. If there’s something you don’t know, or don’t want to answer, cough twice. If you need to end things earlier than is scheduled, yawn.” Tony nodded impatiently, making a ‘get on with it’ gesture which was abruptly stopped when Pepper seized his hand in her own. Her mouth opened and shut several times, and then she shook her head and bent down to press a kiss to the back of Tony’s hand in lieu of whatever she’d tried and failed to say.
When Tony had finally found the Tesseract inside a safe keyed to Maria Stark’s birthday (a sentimental detail he was still surprised by), it had not been alone. There had been another notebook. He’d taken it out because it had been stored with the case, so it had seemed logical to assume that whatever was inside was related to the power stone. (Plus, if Tony was being entirely honest, he still got kind of a thrill over encountering bits of his dad’s handwriting. A stupid, sentimental thing he should have grown out of by now, but losing a parent young did things to you.)
This Steve took the time to observe. Tony had learned that just under a week ago when he’d challenged Steve’s interest in his as an individual rather than a permutation of a previous lover. But after spending so much longer with a version of the man who seemed to actively avoid seeing the people and world around him for what they were, it still came as a shock sometimes. He pressed his forehead against the broad expanse of Steve’s back.
(Author’s Note: I am so delighted this question got asked! I had a version of this scene written ages ago, but couldn’t make it work with Tony and Steve as our only POV characters in the main verse. Thank you, anon!)
“Recognize it, huh? One of my very helpful benefactors at Stark Industries found footage of that ol’ baldie takin’ the first one outta you, and I figured if it was good enough for him it should suit me fine too. I made a few upgrades, of course, since baldie didn’t have to deal with the suit but the general point…” With a sudden jerking motion he pressed the device against the armour. Steve heard a soft hissing noise followed by groaning protests from the metal of the suit as the arc reactor was torn away. Steve watched, unable to look away from the dark, cavernous space it left behind in the Iron Man armour, and for the first time since the other version of the man he loved had died, he prayed.
Having a muzzled version of the world’s most powerful AI on his side was frustrating as hell, but the very last thing Steve wanted to come out of any of this was for Tony to feel as if he were truly alone. He agreed to JARVIS’ terms, he made what felt like dozens of plans and contingencies and alternates with Natasha. And then they waited. Each day the anniversary drew closer, Steve started to feel more and more desperate. He started pondering the viability of truly disturbing methods like kidnapping Tony; when he confessed to Natasha, sure he would face scorn and judgement about his dwindling sense of ethics, she shook her head impatiently.
The whole thing, Tony would always insist, would never have even happened in the first place if Sunset fucking Baine hadn’t been at the fundraiser. It was his first public event since being outed as a sub, so the whole thing was charged and shitty enough without having his ex girlfriend walk in all cat-9 and covered in leather. He’d tried to refuse her a dance, but she’d bet (correctly) on the fact that he hadn’t told the team anything about her; when she’d ‘shyly’ requested to cut in on Steve's dance with Tony, Cap had been more than willing to hand him off.
“He wanted to talk to me about an upcoming mission. It’s absolutely fine for me to ask him to wait, I need you to know that. But what you said earlier…I don’t mind if he’s here, Tony. He’s our partner and I’d let him see anything you want him to see. You don’t have to listen to what we’re saying, you don’t have to care at all. If it’s something you want, you can just be seen. Would you like that?”
“You will. You are. By giving him space to handle an important problem, by showing him that you’re not just going to change everything on him because he submitted to you once, you’re doing that. Not the way you want, not the way you’d prefer, but his submission isn’t supposed to be about you anyway. You’re a good Dom, Clint.” Clint was far from relaxed by the end of Steve’s little speech, but he looked a little less like he was seconds away from taking the shortcut through the vents and into the range, so Steve was counting it as a win. “Bruce’s notes say that when hand feeding isn’t an option Tony seems to do better with food just being left out rather than directed specifically to him like during a meal. So help me get some more of these vegetables cut up so we can get something into your submissive, hmm?”
While I suspect Stark’s conversation with Dr. Banner in the chapter that followed touched on some of this, I will still expand in case it is helpful. Yes, a person can certainly have periods, however brief or long, where submission does not appeal to them or is not necessary. For much of this story, the team has been in what Banner called ‘crisis mode,’ first using the submission because Stark had to ‘pass’ as his alternate-self, and then because it was the only thing they knew how to do that seemed to help keep him steady.
“No?”
“This is entirely rational.”
Tony’s head swam. The very prospect of leaving the labs without a real orgasm made him want to scream in frustration, but there was a dark edge to Bruce’s lecturing, dispassionate tone that ignited something deep in his belly. He squirmed against the leather of the examination bench, and oh that friction felt amazing, he could just come right here and avoid having to make the choice altogether…
Less than a minute later, the elevator doors slid open and and a red-faced Peter Parker stepped out. He was around the same height as Tony, but he had the stretched air Steve recognized all too well of someone going through growth spurts while also not getting enough to eat. His face was red and splotchy, which Steve didn’t know whether to attribute to the insufficient protection of his thin jacket against New York winter air or his very clear anger. Even as pissed off as he clearly was, Peter stalked across the room with a grace Steve recognized from seeing footage of the kid fight.
“Sorry ‘bout those deflector shields, Legolas.”
One of Rhodey's non-sexual Domming techniques involves having Tony exercise with him. This is not remotely a fat-shaming nor any other kind of negative assessment of Tony on his part, but I wanted to flag it since I know some bodies have fraught relationships with exercise being forced. If you want to avoid, skip the last section.
“Nononono MJ it’s not like that. I mean, it is sort of like that. But I would have done it anyway, and I’m pretty sure he said, not during the fight but after, that Steve probably wasn’t even trying to hurt me anyway.” At this point, Peter inexplicably decided the best way to make his case was to show MJ the vlog entries he’d made on the trip. They did not have the effect he had hoped. MJ was incandescent with rage, and she alternated between cursing Tony’s name and berating Peter for ever having given the man anything except a series of lawsuits. Her fury was terrifying and magnificent. Peter’s drunken, syrupy brain couldn’t decide whether the ferocity with which she was ready to protect him eclipsed the impulse to defend his mentor. At least, he didn’t until MJ spat something about how Tony’s death had perhaps been some kind of cosmic karma.
They trooped toward the playroom together, Bucky in a reluctant lead next to Tony, who seemed sleepily bewildered by the whole thing. Both of them kept sending glances backwards towards Rhodey as they went; this was unsurprising from Tony, who might always look to Rhodes first in moments where he felt uncertain or unsure of what was coming next with the rest of the team, but for Bucky, who usually responded to ‘outsiders’ with either aggression or withdrawal, it was nothing less than a stunning development. Rhodes had earned not just Bucky’s trust, but that of the Solider, and he’d done it so quickly and seemingly with very little effort. (Who the hell was this man?)
Tony was ashamed, even before he opened his mouth, of what he asked next. Whatever else Barnes was, this version of him was suffering. Mark II’s loss had cut him deeply, and he was still offering these deeply personal accounts of the time that had immediately followed without complaint.
“Jay?” The reply came as it always had, smoothly and immediately.
His AI did, thank all the science gods, let Tony into the shop, where the first thing he was confronted with was a bastardized version of the War Machine armour.
The kink checklist was at least simpler, requiring only a Yes or No about whether he’d experienced something, and then a ranking of his interest in the activity from 1-5. There was also space allotted for him to make any additional notes or clarifications.
“Ms. Potts arrived in the Tower late yesterday afternoon. She and Sir both requested that I allow you to rest as long as was possible, but as they are now discussing information directly relevant to active SHIELD projects, my protocols dictate that you must be informed. And Sir, Ms. Potts and Agent Barton agree that your attendance is likely necessary for their conversation to move forward.”
“And how do we know what that is?”
“Well, you’d have to help me build it. And get the word out to anyone who might need it.” He didn’t tell her outright that he knew Kamala was in contact with at least three other powered kids. No need to freak her out this early, especially since he had no intentions of making the offer conditional on her bringing all of those people in with her. Instead, he let the thumb of his left hand reach across his palm and seek out the band on his ring finger. (It really had taken zero time for that to become a soothing habit. Being married was awesome.)
“Now, in hindsight I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised at just how hard you obviously get off on praise. Because really, your contract told a story about someone who is absolutely desperate to serve. To please someone else, to be exactly what they want at precisely the moment they want it. You’re open to at least considering a huge number of things, but that’s really what they all have in common, isn’t it? It’s so fucking sweet, Tony, and all I could think about reading it was how easily I could use that to break you into pieces for me.”
He expected Clint to be happy, maybe even to take on that amused intensity that seemed to characterize his Dom headspace, which Tony had gotten off to imagining more than once this week. Instead, Clint frowned and took a long sip of his water.
Tony’s hair was windswept beyond repair, his clothes were wrinkled and smelled heavily of smoke, and he probably looked just as wild-eyed as he did after days in the workshop with little to no sleep. And he didn’t care even a little bit.
“We need to look at the mission statement again.”
Heather Knight, “How Humans Respond to Robotics: Building Public Policy Through Good Design.”
“I don’t know how to do this,” he whispered into Rhodey’s thigh.
“…yes.”
“We need Steve,” Bruce said confidently. “I mean, he's not the only thing, but things will definitely get easier and more stable once we're all together again. Those two are enough to try even my patience, I swear. But Steve is doing a lot better these days. Shouldn’t be too much longer.”
“You might fight differently enough from our Tony that Taskmaster will notice something’s off. That’s something we can try to analyze and account for in the future, but for right now—well, he’s annoying, but from what we know of the situation as it stands, he’s not a significant enough threat for it to be worth the risk. I’ll be the first to let you know if that changes.”
“You need to stay right here and hang out with us,” Natasha decreed. As she was perhaps the most sober all of them, she managed to make this sound highly authoritative. “You can start whatever your plan is for dealing with Tony tomorrow. I’ll even help if you want.”
Now, apologies for the posting delay, but this was a day late in part because of how big and important this chapter is. I wanted it to be perfect, or as close to it as I could get, and I really really hope it delivered! Please let me know what you thought. Your comments and kudos are always a highlight and they make writing this verse a joy.
Your questions and comments continue to delight, inspire, and challenge me. Two scenes in this particular chapter were inspired by readers: the discussion about regional distinctions in D/s practices came from a comment from dixiehellcat. Bruce being the one to start trying to take on Tony's food issues was inspired by ihearttwojacks. I love hearing all of your thoughts and feelings and predictions! (There's at least one #AskStrange response in the works too, so remember that that's an option if you'd like to get some insight from the Doctor rather than or in addition to myself!)
“But then why not just have Taskmaster move in and try to go more directly for Tony the way he as much as told us he’s planning?” Steve had asked.
“I could not leave Wakanda entirely.”

The night that followed was a hazy mess of sleep, nightmares, and at least one moderate panic attack. (This Rhodey and Pepper were obviously far less familiar with the latter than Tony’s own versions, and there had been a harried conversation between the two of them about doctors or medication before JARVIS, wonderful JARVIS, had given them a few suggestions to try before resorting to more extreme methods.) But the first time Tony would have said he was truly awake and fully conscious came the next morning, when he heard the sound of raised voices from outside the bedroom door.
“Was about the only thing we could do without bickering there at first,” Clint added ruefully. Phil wrote down their latest supposition and added a question mark next to it.
Well, that was actually fairly easy. Tony had liked a lot about last night: Steve’s crop, his tortuously wonderful glass toys, the way he fucked like a machine…
“I don’t mean it that way. I mean..look, the thing I said was shitty, okay? You do know me, you’re not just using me to fill a gap, and part of me knew that. I’m sorry I said it.”
Ah, more astute notes regarding those aspects of his life Stark continues to be somewhat recalcitrant to share.
“I love you,” he whispered. Because he couldn’t not say it, not then when she somehow knew precisely what Tony needed to hear. She smiled and leaned in to kiss his forehead.
“I…have no idea what you mean,” Steve confessed. She smiled, but there was no joy in the expression. It was full of a resigned sadness that reminded Steve oddly of his mother.
“I think they stuffed enough food into us last night that we should be allowed to abstain, personally.” Bucky chuckled.
“Tony? Is that, are you,
Whelp, that one might not have been the format a lot of you were expecting, I know! And of course we'll be checking in a little more intimately with our people in the chapters to come. But getting a sense of the broader view of their actions seemed like a fun and useful way to go this time around.
“Steve.” Domen brought two fingers up to pinch at her nose, and seemed to struggle with herself for several seconds. “You and I have talked a couple of times about some of the patterns you have exhibited during grieving thus far. We’re working on your tendencies to compare and idealize, and that’s going to get us a long way. But we also need to confront and name the outcome of those processes when they go unchecked. Not because I want to shame or embarrass you, but because my impression is that I don’t think you’ve ever been totally honest with yourself about this particular aspect of your psyche.”
Steve’s grip on his book relaxed just slightly and he nodded, sucking in a long breath.
As always, feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns about tagging or anything else.
Edited to add: a paragraph from the Steve/Talia conversation that somehow vanished during the initial copy/paste.
“Just answer the question please, Steve. I assure you that it is relevant.”
“So if I re-write those sections—” he started to offer, desire to escape warring with the equally strong urge to stay and find out exactly what Phil was capable of.
“The submissive sleeps deeply. He does not normally do so during day,” Bucky observed, his cadence and diction somewhere between the Soldier and himself. Rhodes smiled, everything about his body language loose and languid the way other Dominants would be after an intense scene.
For all that Tony’s parting instructions had been forbidding to the extreme, Peter spent most of the next two or so hours playing games on his phone and tossing a ball to Butterfingers. The biggest danger he faced was the increasing discomfort of being in the suit for so long. By the time JARVIS announced Tony’s imminent arrival, Peter had sweat through the t-shirt he had on under the suit. He’d definitely need to stop at home before the party tonight.
“I’m sorry to interrupt, Masdee, but I do have some information that will have bearing on that aspect of things. May I continue?” Masdee nodded at Steve, though her gaze never left Talia, who was staring at the other woman as if she was her only lifeline. “SHIELD operates within a sort of legal grey-zone. We are within United States jurisdiction for the most part, but we’re also ruled in some respects by global and international statutes like the Accords. We have to be, or nothing could ever get done. These past few weeks…the effect you have on Talia is not lost on me. Being able to be submissive in the workplace, even to consider it…she is calmer, more careful, and more deliberate. It makes her a better agent.”
“Well, I’d remind everyone gathered that I have several partners, all of whom I care for deeply and am grateful to find myself back with.” He held a hand up when the chores of ‘yes, buts’ rang out in near unison. “No, seriously. Listen, I have…I have admired Steve Rogers since before I ever really thought I would meet him in person. That hasn’t and will never change.” The fierceness of the declaration caught even Tony off guard; Steve found his gaze again, holding it until the camera flashes made it virtually impossible for them to see one another. Then Tony let his eyes fall over the rest of the team, lingering on both Coulson and Natasha for a few seconds apiece. “But no relationship that’s worth a damn needs to make everything around it smaller just to feel whole or important. So going forward I won’t be responding to any questions that take as a given the irrelevance of the other members of our relationship.”
They allowed the subs to doze against once another until dinner; the trio grumbled about being woken when their delivery arrived, but gradually brightened with careful administration of spring rolls and ginger beef. The team was in the middle of a debate over what movie to watch—it was down to a documentary on Netflix and a classic Disney movie that had somehow escaped Steve’s efforts to catch up—when JARVIS’s cool tones broke through.
Gradually the team trickled up to join him, and Tony did his best to feign some level of normalcy while they ate greasy take-out and watched a Pixar movie marathon that had been Natasha’s surprising choice. (It was, at least, far better than spending the time immediately following a battle alone.) After a while, though, he started to notice two things. The first was that Phil never joined them. While a little disheartening, this was not altogether surprising; from what Tony now understood of the handler position, the bulk of Coulson’s work typically took place in the before and after of a fight. What was surprising, though, was the fact that one additional member of the team kept vanishing, only to reappear and send another teammate . There was little predictable about the how, or why, or when of it; they were gone for varying lengths of time, and though there seemed to be a clear order to who departed when, it had apparently been decided long in advance since none of them spoke their intentions aloud. One by one someone would stand, wordlessly leave the room, and then return looking far more settled than when they had left.
hands,
“Uh, no. She was pretty twitchy when she left the Tower in that way she only gets when she’s really falling behind on work. Leave her be, and pull up everything reliable you can give me about how I should be helping Rogers through this.” JARVIS said nothing, but the requested countdown (one hour, seventeen minutes, thirty four seconds) appeared in the requested spot, and seconds later the projections of the ongoing battle were joined by a host of scholarly and popular media articles about managing Dominant-deprivation.
But Steve had worked hard and long enough to recognize that feeling for what it was. If he gave in to it now then one of them, he or Tony, would be lost: either Tony would succumb to the overwhelming force of Steve’s will bending his own, until he woke up one day not knowing who he was anymore, or Steve would lose himself in another version of Tony Stark, their world shrinking down to nothing but each other and their team. It was tempting, it was far more of a temptation than the Tessaract or any version of control or domination that had ever been presented to Steve, but he’d already seen how that version of their story ended, knew how empty it would leave him them when they lost each other one way or another.
Peter is momentarily baffled. Then he remembers that Rhodey had asked Peter for a copy of the code containing AI Tony. In the fog of hurt and disbelief he’d felt after receiving Tony’s missive, Peter hadn’t given it much thought. If he had, he would have assumed Rhodes was double-checking the source of the code, making sure there was nothing malicious or fragmented in there. Instead, it sounds like AI-Tony is now running War Machine. For Peter, who hasn’t been able to put on his own suit since installing the new AI, it’s nothing short of outrageous.
“When you said you’d stolen booze I assumed you had raided the wine cellar or something. What even is this writing?”
But there had been a sense of anticipation building in Tony all day. It had been clear from fairly early on that they intended to have him scene with the entire team; Rhodey’s presence made that particularly clear. He needed to know, like an itch underneath his skin, how they’d planned for this to end.
“I know you do, sweetheart. One more day. Keep telling me the truth, keep letting me get the information I need to keep you safe and healthy, and it’ll only be one more day.”
“Put him through.” A soft click was the only audible indication that the call had been transferred from JARVIS’s private line to that of the Tower; Tony didn’t say anything, though Steve could hear the faint sound of a glass being set down roughly on top of something and skidding. “Tony?”
He was also incredibly tactile. Out of the entire team only Steve tended to touch Tony less than Bucky did, but tonight the other man was all over him, pressing himself up against Tony’s side, ruffling his hair whenever Tony said something that amused him, even holding his hand under a blanket at one point like they were teenagers hiding from their parents.
"And I don’t think you’ve fixed your suit yet,” Steve continued as if Tony hadn’t interjected at all, “which…I’m not asking you to explain before you’re ready, because I promised you rest and you’ll have every form of it I can give you. But I don’t, I can’t sleep, not like this. Not while it’s your life on the line.”
“There’s no chance, that is, the stones are scattered here. Thanos is dead, Ultron helped us take him down pretty easily, but that’s no guarantee someone won’t find them. There’s no danger to you, right, if someone else gets their hands on the Soul Stone?”
Peter’s entire world felt like it had shifted violently on its axis. His brain had still been adjusting to the prospect of other powered teens. Now here in front of him was another spider-person? It was almost unthinkable.
Generally, Bucky liked that Dr. Gagnon was willing to revise his theories about the mess that was Bucky’s psyche. So many of the shrinks that he’d tried working with after surrendering to SHIELD had been so desperate to make him fit molds they already had that he hadn’t felt like they were really willing to hear him, or to account for all of the truly unique circumstances that had brought him to where he was. (Either that or they were entirely too eager to get their names on papers about the very specific and new conditions they wanted to attribute to and name after Bucky.) Gagnon was nothing like any of them. He seemed entirely uninterested in naming or classifying things for one, and he was imminently practical in a way that reminded Bucky weirdly of Steve’s Mom. He didn’t stir things up just for the sake of it; he focused only on the goals Bucky had said were important to him as markers of his recovery.
this to be true more than anything. He wanted to be exactly what Steve needed, for as long as he possibly could. So he laid his head back against Steve’s broad chest, feeling the vibrations of the pleased little rumble that produced in his Dominant.
“I thought—you said no orientation stuff before, and then Bruce wouldn’t do check-in this morning. Thought maybe I had to earn most of it back or something, the submission.” Steve frowned, unsure how to begin addressing that level of renewed insecurity on top of everything else they needed to cover. After days of wanting nothing but to be able to have these conversations, actually starting them suddenly felt daunting.
“And go where?” The tone Steve used wasn’t unkind. It wasn’t even the half-confused, half-frustrated grumble that had been common in their earliest interactions. But that didn’t mean Peter enjoyed having it pointed out to him that, on top of facing the world’s worst hangover, he also had no real home to recover in. In lieu of replying, he began eyeing the room for his clothes. Then he remembered just how much he’d vomited last night.
“Starkly Sub-lime Cheesecake?” she offered. Tony had a moment to ponder whether or not it was worth being annoyed that even the Ben & Jerry’s flavour named after him on this side had to reference Mark II’s orientation, but that internal debate was largely settled when he tasted the bright, bold flavour of the dessert. (Truth be told, Stark Raving Hazlenuts was chalky, even if he would never permit Strange the satisfaction of admitting it.)
“I'll remember this betrayal,” Tony told him.
“Go?  Go where?” Tony asked, but the timer went off, and he couldn't think about that now.  He couldn't think of anything now.  He had six more courses to go.
“They couldn’t take care of him then, and that is a shame,” he said.  “I’m not going to judge them for leaving him where he’d at least be warm and fed, however poorly.  They did what they had to do.  They probably did what they thought was best for him.”
“What happens when we find it?” Harris asked.
Tony made a show of rolling his eyes.  "Yes, agreed, this is all your fault."
“Not to that gate,” Natasha said.  “And both Jarvis’ key and the one kept in the house collection are both accounted for.”  Her head tipped towards Tony.  “No sign of forced entry so far.  Bobbi and Clint checked the main floor and are moving up from there.”
DJ thought about that.  And decided he didn’t want to think about it.  “Me, too,” he said instead, and there was nothing here but bad choices.  But the third floor landing looked remarkably intact, and the main foyer-
“Yes,” DJ repeated, and hopped off his stool.  “Clean up time.”
“It absolutely is not,” Tony said.
“Okay, so, Steve is doing a live teleconference. With this...” He mouth worked. “Group.”
“Promise?” DJ asked, and Steve peeked out from under the edge of the pillow.
“Billy,” Steve called, and the tallest of the boys turned. “Where's Seamus?”
“I generally do what she tells me to do,” Peter admitted.  “Spider pecking order.”
“Then perhaps a slice of Mrs. Parker's excellent apple strudel with clotted cream?” he offered.
“The United States government,” Gyrich said, and Tony had been kind of afraid of that.
“Figured he could talk you around,” Steve said with a smile.  “He’s good at that.”
Tony jumped, and Steve realized that had come out too loud, too hard, the words forced past the lump in his throat, past clenched teeth.  It echoed in the empty kitchen, leaving a strange, pained silence in its wake.
“She's not the only one,” Bobbi said.  She gave the spoon a lick.  “Rhodes was mad enough to spit bullets last night.”
"It's not, there's not-"  Steve's shoulder slumped.  "Tony-"
"I can do it," Tony said, even as Steve pried him off the floor.  Tony swayed on his feet, his head wobbling on his neck.  "See?  I told you I could-"  That was as far as he got before his knees buckled, his body tipping forward.  Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist, pinning Tony to his chest.
“Yeah, but we have to live with him, so we pretend,” Peter said.  Tony gave him a look, and Peter turned his attention back to his danish.  “Right.  The… The shutting up thing.”
“Yeah.”  Tony grinned.  “Point of pride, actually.  So-”
This nod was slower.  Tony nodded back.  “Was this the first time you’ve seen a movie?”
“But you’re also not going to acknowledge me?” Bobbi asked.  She seemed amused.
Peter blinked at him, all huge eyes and confusion.  "She-  She caught him?" he tried.
Tony considered them, his lips pursed.  “They're not going to approve of my cuisine, are they?” he stage whispered to Steve.
Steve nodded, and he was so right, so perfect, that Tony had to let go of him now, or he’d never manage it.  He relaxed his hand, one finger at a time.  “Find the kid.”
“You're a pain in my ass, you know that?”  His eyes closed.  “The two of you.  Pains.  In.  My.  Ass.”
“Well, fuck,” Harris said aloud.  Neither of them seemed to hear.  Or care.  He pulled his phone out.  Opened up his texts, and stared down at a selfie of Darcy, Wanda, Clint and DJ in wildly overblown flower crowns.
“Definitely someone from Asgard,” Carol said, grinning.
"We didn't talk about the people who preyed on the new arrivals, the people with literally nothing to their names and everything to lose. We didn't talk about the race lines in the city, the way the cops'd take a kickback from just about anyone to look the other way. We didn't talk about the political machines that ran the city, that ran everything, and stole from everyone. We didn't talk about the graft and the protection money and the kids working in dark, cramped, hot rooms and women doing piecework by inadequate light at all hours of the night for starvation wages."
“That’s quite the blaze you’ve got going there.”
DJ shifted against his shoulder, his breath hot through the fabric of Clint's t-shirt.  “Clint?”
"Is that what you're calling it?  An elopement?" he asked, his recorder up and ready.
“All the usual.” Tony straightened his shirt as the elevator came to smooth stop.  “Decorate the place, put up a tree, realize that we should've bought presents already, pick out something far too expensive off a website just because they promise to deliver by the next day, shove it in a gift bag-”
“But he's made this choice without all the information,” Jan said. She huffed out a breath, blowing her hair away from her forehead. “Steve? Do you trust me?”
“Add fuel to the fire?”Agatha asked, blowing on a spoonful of soup.
A beat of pause.  “Was he?”
Steve smiled at her. “I never told you no,” he said. He tapped the tip of his pencil against the page. “I encouraged it.” He glanced at her, his expression going wry. “You might've come up with the idea, but I was with you the entire way.”
Tony’s chin dipped.  “You, we need right now.”
“Can you stop gaslighting him for a second here?” Carol said, her arms crossed over her chest.  “And also, I think there's a difference between people we hook up with and people we get into relationships with.  Not just Tony.”  One of her shoulders rose and fell in a half shrug.   “Are we going for a one shot or-”
She paused.  “DJ has done neither.”  She leaned back.  “And I think that it’s because he’s afraid.”
He looked at Rogers.  “You can read the newspaper.”
“I’m not going to eat it,” Tony said.  Jarvis paused next to his chair, his head tipped in Tony’s direction, his eyebrows arching in an expression of quiet reproach.  Tony gritted his teeth, doing his best to hold his ground.  “I won’t.”
DJ looked at Steve, who smiled at him.  “Thank you, Thor,” he said.  “Deej, would you like to play with it?”
Peter nodded, and he was still crying, but it was slower now, without the hard, labored breaths under it. “Yes, ma’am.”  He glanced at Tony.  “I should’ve gotten to him sooner, Mr. Stark.”
“Wait, that's what Jarvis said?” Rhodey echoed.  “Tony, didn't you talk to him?”
Pepper raised one hand, wiggling her fingers in a half wave, and his head tipped to the side, the gesture quick and almost birdlike.  But he raised one of his hands, waving back with a quick, gamine smile.
“What do you expect me to do?” Tony asked, his brow furrowing.  “I don’t suppose you’ve noticed, but I haven’t a coin to my name, Jan, it’s not like I can-”  She was smiling up at him, and Tony’s stomach sank. “No.”
Steve grinned down at his feet.  “I think I can find a sweatshirt somewhere.”
“I won't fire him.  Today,” Tony agreed.  He waited until everyone had been served, glasses of water and wine poured, baskets of steaming bread set along the table.  “Thank you, Jarvis.”
"Thank you, so much, for that vote of confidence."  Sue pulled out a pack of baby wipes and held them up.  "Come here, I'll clean you up without water.”
“He’d be very proud of you,” Steve said.  He sat back on his side of the bed, and Tony reached out, resting a hand on Steve’s knee.  Steve covered his hand with his own, lacing their fingers together.
“Yeah, and Tony was joking with, I think it was Carol?  And he was a mess, just like everyone else, and he pulled the hem of his t-shirt up to wipe his face, and-”
“You’re engaged.  Tell me you’ve kissed.”
Tony shook his head, and Steve met Happy’s eyes as he opened the back door of the car.  “We were, ya know, hoping that maybe he was here,” Happy said, as Tony slid into the car.  “Sure, it’d be a long trip, but-” He gave Steve a lopsided smile.  “He’s a clever one.”
Steve stared at him, his pulse still pounding in his ears.  “He’s fine?  What do you mean, ‘he’s fine’?”
“What made it certified?”
Steve smiled.  “It’s over now,” he said, which seemed easier than confirming that or denying it.  He picked up his bag, settling the weight against his shoulder.  Something dug into his arm, and he paused.  “Here.”  He swung it around in front of him, pulling out the tin Jarvis had given to him.  He held it out to her.  “It’s gingerbread.”
He had nothing left.  But a job he didn’t want.
"My door," Steve said.  "I finally got permission from my landlord, so I can finally get rid of the green."
A gum wrapper stuck out of the pages of 'Cat's Eye,' and a torn pieces of sketchbook paper marked half a dozen spots in 'American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America.'  The edge of a battered photograph was visible along the top of 'The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark.'
“For now?  Neither,” Steve said.  “Where’s DJ?”
"Nooooooooooo," DJ said, throwing the full weight of his body against Tony's side.  "Fine."
DJ's eyes darted from Tony to Jarvis and back, his face unreadable.
Tony paused, his first cup halfway to his mouth. “I…  Never sleep,” he said.
“You’re mad at Steve,” DJ said.
"The china we use for cocktail parties or buffet style dinners," Tony said.
“Knock, knock!”  Rhodey’s voice echoed from the back door.  “Anyone home?”
Jan sucked in a breath.  “Right,” she said, and then, again, “Right.”  She reached up, scrubbing delicately at the corners of her eyes with the heel of her hand.  She blinked hard.  “We can handle this.”
"What're we painting?"
Tony scowled at her.  “I tried that tonight.  Movie.  Socializing. And you know what happened?”
“You need to think about this rationally,” Obie said.  “You need to stop being so-”  He shook his head.  “Emotion cannot factor into this, Tony, it’s-”
Steve shook his head  "I'm fine, ma'am."
"Yes, ouch.  Rhodey was handsome and kind and warm and open, and Tony had been in a truly horrible boarding school situation since he was seven, surrounded by boys from families as rich, and as messed up as his was, so...”  She shrugged, and there was something sad in her eyes.  Something resigned.  “It's easy to confuse kindness, and friendship, for something more, when your frame of reference is that skewed.”
“You’re back.”
He swayed, just an inch or two, his shoulder brushing against Steve's.  “No amount of wanting it is going to make it reality, Steve.  Just because you fantasized about a thing, or a situation, or-” He shrugged.  “Or a person.”
Billy frowned, his face crumpling up.  “Seamus?  That little weasel can’t-”  He stopped, his eyes going wide.  “Oh, right.  Right.”  He straightened up.  “I remember.  Big fella, booming voice, the same kind of false cheer that the social workers have when they come poking around.  After he left, Hammer was in a real good mood, the kind of good mood that only comes with a payout.”
Tony made a face.  “And it’ll be forgotten in a week,” he said.  “I’m not the only rich man who’s having problems with an angry public, Obie.”
“Okay, then, be diplomatic,” Steve said, his head tipped back.  The ceiling of the ballroom was arrayed with swaths of almost transparent fabric, a silvery-white silk that seemed to glitter in the light.
“I want to die,” Tony said, as Steve wrapped a blanket around his shoulders.  “Hey, I-” Steve took hold of his shoulders, pushing him down onto the couch.  “I'll fight you, Rogers.  I will fucking fight you.”
“So, you're taking him back to your place?” Sam asked, his voice angelic.
“He's MOVING,” Jessica said.  “If you eat it, he doesn't have to throw it out or move it.”
“All right.”  Steve straightened up, holding a hand out to DJ.  “Let’s go.  We can patrol together.  Maybe we’ll be a little more tired when we’re done.”
“If you fold that into a paper airplane, you will never see me coming,” she said.  She leaned over, the rest of the papers hugged to her chest, to whisper directly in his ear.  “I know where you sleep.”
May nodded.  “And as for you, Officer Rogers, perhaps you should be going?”
"We have a fundamental difference of opinion on this," Steve said.  "And since I'm rational and you're not, I guess I'm gonna win."  He threw his hands in the air in celebration.  "Had to happen at some point in this relationship!"
“Thank you,” he said, sliding out of the car.  He leaned down.  “You coming in?”
“And she will,” Bucky grumbled, even as he checked her horse’s bridle.
“I was going to be up soon anyway,” Steve said.  “So-”
But where ever the damn Sentinels were today, they were not hovering above Avengers Tower.  They weren't waiting at the edge of the property, looming over the street like grotesque, modern gargoyles.  The world went on, as it always did, cars creeping along through the congested streets and people hustling along the sidewalks, often outpacing the vehicle traffic.
Steve looked away. “And that’s what everyone wants.”
Steve glanced in his direction, his jaw tight.  “I don’t think he does.”
“Speaking of dangerous, where is our guest?” Tony asked, rolling his head back towards Natasha.  “Do I need to call out the dogs?”
Another nod. “For you,” DJ said with a grin.  “And Peter.  And Jarvis.”
Peter gave a full body flinch, holding his milkshake cup up in front of his face like he could hide behind it.  Everyone looked at him with varying degrees of amusement and pity.  Natasha reached out, and pushed the cup down.  “Take your medicine, Peter,” she said, and next to her, Clint had both their super long straws shoved under his upper lip.  She looked at him.  “What-”
“Shock and awe tactics,” Tony said, before Gyrich could feed them whatever line of bullshit he had cooked up and ready to go.  “You decided to announce your existence in a big way.”  Out of the corner of his eye, he could still see the faces, pale and fearful, behind every window, each one tight with remembered trauma.  Tony's jaw locked.  “This is a threat.”
"Absolutely."
And if couldn’t, what could he say?
Her eyes went wide for a moment, a look of pure pleasure sweeping over her face, and for an instant, he could see how young she really was, beneath the weight of her life.  Her smile was bright as she took the box from him.  She braced her baby on one hip, weighing the tin with her others.  “Are you sure?” she asked, looking up at him.  “Gingerbread’ll keep, if you make sure it’s sealed tight.”
Odinson waved him off.  "Call me Thor; truth be told, one of the best things of this city is not being 'my lorded.'"  He slapped Steve on the shoulder, with so much force that Steve swayed on his feet.  But his attention had already passed on. “And this must be the young one.”
“Can we tell him today?” Steve asked, his blue eyes wicked and bright.  “Preferably over a meal?”
“No.  Something-”  DJ’s face scrunched up.  “There’s something hidden.”  His thumb smoothed against the paper, wrinkling it.  “Something-”
The thug swung the cudgel against his palm, the wood hitting flesh with a crack.  “Guess so,” he said, taking a darting step forward.  Steve shifted his weight, centering the shield in front of him, bracing himself for the coming rush.
Bruce nodded, very slowly.  “It’s about the bakery leftovers,” he said, looking around the kitchen.  He was holding his coffee cup in front of him in both hands, looking vaguely out of place.
Tony pulled back.  “Fine,” he said, catching the edge of the tub with one hand and pushing himself up.  “If you’re going to be like that…”
“Where’s DJ?”
Tony grinned.  “Ah.  A family heirloom?” He tipped the watch casing to the light.  “If so, it’s a relatively recent one, this can’t be more than-”  He squinted at it, his dark eyes sparking beneath the line of his brows.  “No makers mark that I can see, but I’m guessing… Fifty years old?  Maybe sixty?”
Steve weighed the box in his hands, his eyes narrowed.  “I could beat you to death with this, you realize that, right?”
Agent Sitwell piled his plates onto his tray.  “Have you ever been cursed?” he asked, his tone conversational.  “I have.  I have been cursed.  It was-”  He gave Harris a stern look over the rims of his glasses.  “It was not pleasant.  It is not a situation I want to repeat.”  He paused.  “Ever.”
“I'm going to do some aerial sweeps,” Carol said.  “Sam?  Wanna join me?”
“Sorry, you gave them to Jan for the buffet table, and I learned my lesson, never doing that again,” Steve said, grinning at him.  “I nearly had a heart attack when I saw the price tag on that bouquet, and you just…”  He was laughing again, laughing so hard he couldn’t get the words out.  “Gave them to Jan.”
“You’re going to go drinking with Tony,” Pepper told him.
“Mmm.” Tony went to stand, and Steve moved to intercept him.  “I’ve got him, it’s-”
Tony’s face relaxed.  “Tell me the truth, Rogers,” he said, his hand coming up to cover Steve’s.  “Have you ever had a bed large enough to make a ‘favorite side’ necessary?”
His nails bit into Tony’s skin, pain cutting through the haze that Tony clouded Tony’s mind.  He stared at Obie, confusion giving way to nausea as Obie considered him with the sort of expression one would use when reviewing a failed experiment.  “I really wish you didn’t force me to do this,” Obie said.  “We had been getting along just fine, weren’t we, Tony?  You were so clever, and so uninterested.  You gave me everything I needed, all the clever little improvements, all the brilliant breakthroughs, and as long as there was still money flowing, you never did look too closely at just how much that flow contained.
"I feel I'm not getting the respect I deserve here," Tony said, holding up a ball bearing.  He rolled it back and forth between his fingertips, studying the play of light along the surface.  "I feel that-"
Another beat of silence as he considered that.  "Hello," he said at last, and then the heavy tread of footsteps in the hall brought his head up.  He glanced down, at the street below him, and Pepper came half out of her chair.
He tried not to see the crowd they'd attracted, people piling up around the edges of the platform.  He was used to being a spectacle, but trust Steve to take 'making a scene' to an entirely new level.  Because Steve was still smiling at him, and if he was concerned, or embarrassed, it didn't show on his face.  Tony supposed not everyone had the extensive experience to cultivate a 'complete disaster' sense the way he had.
“Steve, you were holding it in one hand,” Sam said.  “You popped a basketball with ONE HAND.  I don’t think I could pop a beach ball with one hand, and yet-”
“He’s very fast.” Tony’s hands came up in front of him, his fingers flexing into fists before relaxing.  “He’s…  Very fast.”
Steve set the cat in the hallway.  “Mean what?” he asked, shutting the door behind the cat.
DJ forced a nod.  “I-  This is my fault,” he said.
She took his hand between both of hers, squeezing his fingers.  “We don't know how long he's been gone, but we're fairly certain he hasn't left the grounds.”
Tony stared at him.  “Wow.  You've found a really clever way to cover 'we've built a giant robot and we plan on using it to hunt down mutants.'”  He nodded.  “That's...  That's some excellent PR babble.  Makes you sound almost noble.”
Steve looked up, his palm still resting on the curve of the fender.  “I thought you were his driver?”
“Except I’m not,” Steve said.  “I’m-” He shook his head.  “I am a soldier, sir.  Your Majesty.  I’m not equipped for court or nobility.”
Right.  Because Tony was wearing exactly the same stupid outfit.  Which took a little bit of the sting out of his cutting bon mots.
“Never.”  Tony held out a hand and Steve caught it.  “What have you done with our child?”
DJ stopped.  Held the pamphlet in front of him, and then opened it.  “No.  It was right.  It was...”  He pulled the coupon out and held it up to the light.  Without looking up from his careful consideration, he held the pamphlet out to Tony, who took it.  DJ brought the page up, sniffing at it.
“Two things,” Tony said, licking his straw.  “One?  I’m right.  And two?  If they’re taking offense then they were doing something offensive.” He spread his hands.  “How is that my fucking problem?”
Ellen paused. “You... Planning on picking it up?”
“Then what the hell are you still doing here?” Tony asked, playing with the soft, spiky hairs at the nape of Steve’s neck.
“Your parents married yet?” Harris asked and the look Tony gave him was equal parts betrayed and traumatized.
“Stark's bi, you know he is,” Ellen said.  “He's had relationships with other men before, not as public, not as-”
“Then let’s get this party started.”  She set a certificate down on the desk.  “Sign here, you’ll be taking it with you.  Registry is right to your left, feel free to put a pseudonym, but honestly, people’ll think it’s a joke either way.” Clint held out a name tag to her, and she took it.  “What’s this?”
“To Maaagicon!” she said.  He nodded.  She nodded back.  “Aren’t…  You here for the convention?”
Smiling to herself, Pepper turned in her chair, reaching for the cup she'd left sitting on the edge of Hammer's desk.  Halfway there, her hand hovering in mid-air, she froze.
He seemed to be waiting for a response, so Steve nodded.  "Yes, Mr. Stark."
“It’s a ‘I doubt I could stop you, even if I tried,’” Tony said.  He jammed a whole cookie in his mouth.  “I’m accepting my fate.”
He watched as people passed, and it sure looked like SHIELD.  But if it was SHIELD, he should be able to reach Jarvis.  There’s no way he’d lose the connection, not just across the length of New York City.  He craned his head, trying to see if there was a window nearby.  Maybe a SHIELD facility somewhere else in the world.  Not the helicarrier, he didn’t think, he’d be able to feel the vibrations if it was-
“The Rhino threw me through a WALL.  That had a mural on it,” Peter said, his voice dark.  “The 'destruction' was a side effect.  So yeah.” He spread his hands.  “I got zero problems with lying to the press.”
DJ nodded.  “When?”  His fingers latched onto the hem of his shirt, tugging hard at the fabric.  Sue sipped her smoothie, curious.
SHIELD.
Sue held up a hand.  “I'm well aware,” she said.  “And you're not sorry.”
She balanced the bowl between her palms.  “It means something.  Still.  Even after all this time.” She handed him the bowl and turned her attention back to her kettle, steam curling around her face.  “Be careful with that shield, boy.  I won’t be the only one to remember it.
“I don’t-”
Harris nodded.  “Do you need some water?  Or something to eat?”
“Go to bed, Tony,” Steve said, and, laughing, Tony headed for the door.
He looked at Tony, still smiling that slight, lopsided smile.  “You are the adult, you are the parent.  The one who’s supposed to be in charge, and when you realize that you have a child that is smarter than you? It all changes.  Because you cannot outthink him.  You can’t reason with him, you can’t make him do what you need him to do.
He settled back in his chair. "Yes. There is a lot of things we didn't used to talk about." He met her eyes square on. "Like how Mrs. O'Malley up on the third floor always had a split lip or a black eye, and it wasn't because she walked into doors. Sure, folks talked about how the Ferguson kids across the block got picked up by the cops for stealing, but no one wanted to mention it's because their parents couldn't feed 'em all." He looked up, squinting into the lights. "We didn't talk about the people getting lynched down in the South. We didn't talk about how you couldn't get a job down on the docks unless you were willing to kick back half your salary to the fixer who got you the job.
A simple woman who loved her son.”
“I don't think that Steve likes Ty.”
It was clearly a photo printed off of a social media site.  Steve and Tony, in the green room of NYNN, both smiling as they kissed, their hands tangled together.  Written below it, in heavy black letters, it read, “Good job, both of you!  P.S. Dance class is now on the official team calendar.  See you on Tuesday!”  It wasn’t signed, but Steve knew Jan’s handwriting by now.
And he wasn’t asking about the bus, but Harris pretended to think about it.  “I’d say the driver, but honestly, with traffic being what it is, that’s not really true, either.”  That won him a small smile, and Harris leaned forward.  “C’mon.  What do you want to do?”
“Most of them are food,” Steve said, spreading his hands wide.
Laughing, Steve peeled back the flap.  “If I get in trouble for this, I'm blaming you,” he said.
“You were robbing him,” Steve repeated, more amused by this than he should’ve been.  “And how, exactly, did that result in-” He waved a hand at the kitchen.  “This?”
She grinned at him, her hair in tousled curls around her face.  “Let me redecorate.”
Harris glanced at Darcy, who shrugged.  “Hey, let’s take a moment,” she said, coming up next to DJ.  “We’ll figure it out.”
“You pickpocketed him,” the watchmaker pointed out, going back to his work.  “I think he gets to be a little tense.”
“Think this is your stop.”
Sam stopped, his eyes wide.  “Ooooookay,” he said, drawing the word out.  “Is there a reason-”
No matter how he reached out, his palm was carefully turned away.
"As an officer of the law, I would assume you're required to handle reports of potential crimes."
“What government, exactly, are we talking about here?” Clint asked.  “'Cause, there's a bunch that I can think of that might do this, and really, I need clarification before-”
He never hit.
“When I left my old life, Tony, I walked away from something that very few people ever manage to achieve,” Steve said.  “I rejected something that a lot of other people desperately want, and will never manage to get, because the deck is stacked against them, because they don't get lucky, because they don't have the advantages I have.
“Me?” T’Challa asked, with a lopsided smile.
"Mostly they seemed drunk." Steve reached up, his fingers catching on the hand towel that was thrown over one of Tony's shoulders.  "Drunk and confused."
“What is he doing?”
“Noble of you.” Steve rolled over, glancing at the clock.  “Want breakfast before we go down to open presents?”
Walking across the lobby actually helped.  He had a destination, a clear goal.  Something to think about other than the confusing mix of things in his head.  He could boil everything down to crossing the lobby and avoiding being knocked over by a courier in a rush or an executive hurrying back from a late lunch.  He concentrated on keeping the cup still between his hands, on slipping through narrow gaps between people who looked right past him.
From the living room, there was silence.  Then, “I'd argue, but I find this dominating side of you to be very attractive for some reason.”
“They were on sale,” Steve said.  “Lie back down.”
"Who doesn't like 'Bambi?'" Steve asked, and Tony raised his hand.  "Speaking of liars."
"But of all the things I lie for or lie about, you're my favorite." Tony stroked a thumb over Steve's lips before pulling away.  "Besides.  This is important to you."
Drew waved him off.  “I got it.  Just don’t do anything stupid before we get back.”
“Yes,” Tony said.  He paused as Steve shrugged into his shirt.  “Peter ran into one of them.”  Steve’s head snapped up, his heart lodging in his throat, but before he could say a word, Tony rushed on.  “He took a couple of hard knocks, but he’s fine.  Bruce’s keeping an eye on him.”
“I knew you’d take care of him.”  And to his surprise, he realized it was true.  He met Jarvis’ eyes.  “Thank you, he’s…”  His voice trailed away.
“No sorry,” Harris said, taking a step back as Strange reopened the portal.  The air shifted, and Harris had to brace his feet to keep himself from being dragged forward, straight at it.  It crackled and swirled, reality seeming to die at the very edges, where the portal cut through it.  He tore his eyes away, his hearbeat pounding in his ears.  “Be safe.  And if you ever have to come back, well, you can crash with me.  Okay?”
Isaiah smiled.  “Steve Grant Rogers,” he said, his voice amused, “I know you better than anyone alive, with the possible exception of that Barnes boy.”
“You’re sure?” he asked, stepping past Tony to grab his shirt from the end of the bed.
Steve laughed, and Tony felt it through his entire body.  “Are you implying this is out of character?”
He leaned forward, his head tilted towards DJ.  “Do you want to leave?”
The door to the greenhouse was open.
“Reopen just in time for Mother’s Day?” Steve whispered back.  “Brave.  Stupid.  But brave.”
Giving in with something close to grace, he ladled himself out a bowl, closing up the pot before he headed back to the counter.  Miss Potts had returned to her ledgers, the pages open in front of her, but her eyes lingered on him as he took a seat.  “That's a Stark pistol, isn't it?”
“Do I?”  She shook her head.  “Glad to know that my mask is holding.  Because I'm glad.  I'm glad that even though Franklin is a mutant, I'm glad that he looks...”  Her mouth worked for a second, then she spat the word out, venomous and sharp.  “Normal.  He's white and male and from a family that can protect him, he's a mutant that won the genetic lottery, Steve.  He's middle class and whatever he can do, whatever his powers end up being, they're controllable.  He's not a visible threat, he's not a visible problem, he's a good, attractive, white boy from a family with money.”
“I was always even dumber than I look,” Clint said.  “I just-”  He shook his head.  “I was sick of running.  And I can cook.  Nothing fancy, but breakfast doesn't have to be fancy, does it?” He kicked the range with the side of one foot.  “Took me a bit to figure this thing out.  To find the baking powder and the lard in the pantry.  And Nat hung back for a while.  Just watched me.  Because just because I was going to try this, didn’t mean she had to.
“My ma raised me right, I guess,” Bucky said.  He balanced the plate on his hip.  “Look, Stark?  You have this weird thing going where you seem to think that you're the only one who's trying to figure out the whole relationship thing.”
Bruce saluted him with his coffee cup.  “Carson’s Carnival of Wonders,” he said.
“Yes, you know, the-” She straightened up. “'I have a shovel and no one will miss you'?” Steve stared at her. Jan looked at Sam. “He's never gotten the shovel talk.”
She laughed as Steve handed over the napkin wrapped cookie and a bottle of water.  “Right.”  She reached for her purse.  “Allison Blair. I’m with-”
“I’m going to have to ask you not to encourage her,” Tony said to Steve, who was struggling hard to keep a straight face.  “No matter how much fun it might be.”
“Because a surprising number of them live there,” DJ said.  “And the ones that don’t, love it.”  His head tipped forward.  “Have you ever seen Owovalrahk, scourge of six realms, destroyer of the dark dimension of Vorkas, first among the ancient ones do card tricks?”
Steve looked like he wanted to put his fist through something.  “Why didn't anyone tell me this was happening?” he gritted out.
Steve stared at him.  “She's okay?” he managed.
“Get your own account, you mooch, or shut up about my queue.”  Ellen shifted in her chair, drawing one leg up to brace her heel against the seat.  She leaned forward and rewound the footage.  “Yes.  I'm watching it.”
Jane was already shaking her head.  “No.  No, actually, I-”
“Yeah.  If the host had asked him, as a point of conversation, if he was a quote-unquote good father, what would he have said?”
He twisted around and found Jan standing there, staring up at him, her arms full of fluffy white towels.  He opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “Uh-” he managed.
DJ was halfway through another tray of cookies when the front door opened again. “Nat had powdered sugar, God only knows why.”  Clint tossed the bag of sugar in the general direction of the counter.  He paused, looking at the briefcase on the counter.  “Phil home?”
Peter stared down at the fifty.  “This was a mistake, wasn’t it?”
“For something I'll be wearing one night and trying not to spill on?” Steve gave the sleeve a tug, trying to get it over his wrist, but it was a losing battle.  "It's close enough.”
DJ reached out, moving the hands on the clock until it indicated one am.  “Button,” he said, pointing.
Judging by the look on Strange’s face, he was better off for it.
"Elisabeth Kubler-Ross wrote the groundbreaking book 'On Death and Dying,' where she outlines the five primary stages of grief," Steve said, because he liked being helpful, and he also got far more pleasure out of watching Tony and Sam bicker than was probably healthy.
"Oh, great, you want to talk about love lives?" Steve tossed his bag at the bench with a bit more force than was strictly necessary.  It skimmed off the top of the well-worn wood and slammed into the wall of lockers with a bang.  Steve sucked in a breath, and let it out, trying to get himself under control.  "Fantastic.  How's yours going?"
DJ nodded.  “Water them.”
“Riiiiiiiight,” Darcy said.  “Can you hold it together for another five minutes?  I can see your building from here, and I’m still a bit concerned that-”
She stood up, dusting off her skirt with quick, efficient movements. “Steve, I think you said it best at the beginning of this conversation.” She met his eyes, a slight smile on her lips. “I don't think anyone has ever made Tony Stark do anything he doesn't actually want to do.” She leaned over, pressing a soft kiss to his hair. “I love you both, but you're both dumbasses.” She braced her hands on her hips. “You're goddamn Captain fucking America. Start acting like it.”
DJ landed so gently that his feet didn’t even disturb the sand beneath his sneakers.  His face flushed, his eyes bright, he was laughing as he came to rest, high and bright and loud.  An instant later, Iron Man landed behind him, the repulsors cutting out with startling suddenness.
A clatter brought his head up, and he watched the church key bounce across the workbench, Tony’s hand still hanging in midair.  There was a strange, strained look on his face, and Steve gave him an apologetic smile.  “Sorry,” he said, and his voice sounded raw.  “Dignified, huh?”
“Sam admitting the two of you are dating yet?” Tony asked.
“Sorry, I'll try to be shorter in the future,” Steve said, amused, as the woman reappeared, dragging a young man by the arm.  His glasses were crooked on his nose, and his hair had been bleached and the tips frosted in pale blue.
“You have no idea,” he said, with a wry smile.  “Clint, do we have-”
Revealing a stone staircase that stretched down, down, down into the darkness.
“Are you open?”
Jan studied him, her mouth a flat line.  “You’re getting a bail fund for Christmas, that’s what you’re getting.”
“Yeah, but once I’m home, that’ll no longer be my problem,” Tony said.  “I mean, technically even while I’m still here, it’s not my problem.”
“Not that I know of, but he’s been a fixture in that house longer than any of us, and I got no idea the last time the locks were changed,” Happy said.  His hands flexed on the steering wheel, his knuckles going white.  “And he sure as hell has something to lose if the boss’s will changes.”
Harris lay there, gasping for breath, one leg tangled in an upturned chair, his shoulder lying in an upturned bowl of tomato soup. His head spinning, his chest aching, he tried to push himself up.  The thing that had hit him, human sized and human shaped, but red and silver and metal, was rolling now, across the floor, under a table, and it was better at this than he was, finding cover, finding its balance, and he had an instant to see the light gleaming across its surface, and then it was gone.
Steve's eyes slid shut.  "Oh, dammit."
“Last night, she told us that she had book club today.”  Peter’s voice was almost startlingly loud in the sudden silence.  “And then, Jess asked about the book club.  And then she told us that she’d introduced you to them when you first came to New York and now you get your tattoos done here, and while you were explaining this, you yelled ‘I have a really good idea,’ and then you made us all leave.”
"Could you even recognize an Applebees?" Steve asked, his chin braced on one fisted hand.
Steve let out a noise that was half laugh, half cough, and Sam reached for the water pitcher to refill his cup.  Steve waved him off.  "I'm fine," he managed, trying to get his breathing back under control.  "Just a-"
Tony turned his attention to someone who was waving a recorder in his direction, barely noticing as Steve was handed one softball question after another.  Until, suddenly, "Captain Rogers, aren't  you concerned about the possibility of cheating?"
Tony looked up from his paperwork.  “What can I do for you, Jarvis?”  He handed a contract to Pepper.  “How many more of these do we have?”
"Marcy's right, Steve.  This changes everything," Tony said, and there was a sharp edge to the words.  "It shouldn't.  You're still you and you're still-"  He stopped, flapping a hand in Steve's direction.  Steve hid a smile behind his hand, but wasn't fast enough.  Tony gave him a look, his lips twitching.  "You're still you," he repeated, and Steve didn't know what he meant, but he nodded anyway.
“You are about as threatening as a slightly confused baby duck, stop it,” Tony said, almost amused by this.  But mostly concerned.  “I do not need to explain to your supervisor or your girlfriend how a knockoff Captain America threw you through a display of out of print commemorative plates.  Get-”
“Yes, sir.” Justin bent his head over his food, concentrating very hard on cutting his potatoes in perfect pieces.
It's like you're disappearing.  Like you were never there to begin with.
“I’m not going to-”
“Right.  Options.  We can make a break for the field,” Tony said, his head swinging to the side.  The wind caught his hair, his expression pensive.  “And there’s a cliff somewhere beyond that-”
Jarvis’ lips twitched, the smallest little flicker of amusement crossing over his face.  “Because you do.”  Tony snorted in disdain, and Jarvis gave him a look.  “You might be able to fool the others,” he said, a faint barb to the words, “but I’ve known you from the time you were in short pants, and despite how much time you spend denying it, you do have a plan.”
“We're already swimming, Tony,” Rhodey said, not bothering to open his eyes.  “You're the one who's late.”
Officer Rogers stared at him, his face unreadable.  "Yes," he said at last.  "You should get used to that."
As everyone got to their feet, Tony clung stubbornly to his seat.  “No.  I’m not moving until DJ opens at least one-”  There was a rattle, and something slipped over his head.  Tony looked down.  “Is this…  Pasta?” he asked.  “Is this spray painted ziti on a ribbon?”
“That is, one supposes, up to the interpretation of the speaker,” Jarvis said.
“It seems too coincidental, otherwise,” Jarvis said, as calm and collected despite the hour and the situation.  “Bobbi and Natasha are checking on the gates and the walls, to make sure everything’s still secure, and Dr. Banner has escorted sir downstairs, but they’re concerned about DJ.”
He marched DJ across the lobby over to the hallway.  He stopped there, one arm wrapped around DJ’s shoulders.  “There is no way this is the right place,” he said, as the door at the end of the hallway opened, revealing a bustling ballroom full of tables and people.  A group of people dressed in what he could only describe as multicolored genie outfits came out, laughing and chatting with each other.  In their midst was a single person who seemed to be wearing a pumpkin.
"If everyone's so fucking fine, why are we in goddamn SHIELD medical?" he snapped, and Bruce wrapped a hard, solid arm across his chest jerking him to a hard stop.
"Disabled my spacial reasoning parameters," DJ said.  He blinked, slow and careful.  "So I could ram him.  In the leg."  Tony stared at him, not sure how to process that information.  DJ blinked again.  "Tried to break his leg."  He frowned, and bent back over his work.  "Not enough force, didn't break.  But I hurt him." He gave a single, firm nod, a satisfied smile curling his lips.  "It was worth it.  Hurt him.  It was worth it."
The coffee tasted off, like copper or ash, like the beans had been roasted for too long.  He swallowed, trying not to let it linger on his tongue.  “Because he knew I’d tell him no?  And then ground him for a very long time for asking?” he said with a pleasant smile.  “Just a guess on my part, but I’m going with that.  And just so you know, the grounding is still on the table.  It’s…  Front and center on the table.”
“Never again,” Tony said, rinsing away the last of the soap suds.  He turned off the shower.  “You're no help at all, I don't know why I bother keeping your number in my contact list.”
He didn't see his bow, it was either still back on the street or buried under the debris, but his quiver was still on his hip.  And judging by the way Nat was still cursing him out in Russian over the comms, she would be willing to dig him out with her bare hands just so she could have the pleasure of killing him.
Another shrug.  “Asked him not to.”  DJ's mouth twisted in a fierce frown.  “Shouldn't be in the workshop.  Not without you.” He paused, his frown deepening, his jaw tight.  “Shouldn't be in the workshop at all.”
“He's not, but I definitely am,” Tony said.  He glared at her.  “I thought you were supposed to keep aliens off of the surface, Agent Chase.”
Steve gave her a look. “Can you?” he asked, his voice polite.
Jan buried her face in her hands.  “Or, you know, you could go one night without flexing,” she mumbled into her fingers.
“Nothing excuses what he did,” Jarvis said.  “Nothing makes it right.  No one is required to forgive him.  But I do believe that he regretted what he did, as much as he was capable of regretting anything.  And knowing I was watching him?  I truly believe it helped him not to repeat that mistake.”
She stared at him, her opal eyes gleaming.  “He is a child of magic, Tony, and you are not comfortable with that.  And that means, he is not comfortable with it.  He is not comfortable with reminding you that it even exists.  On his most elemental level, he is at war with himself, because being too much of what he is, too obvious, too visible, then he has to run the risk that you hate magic more than you love him.”
“Me neither,” Tony agreed absently. “Hey, speaking of Rhodey—”
“Sorry, what?”
Steve, he’d discovered over the past several days, had the most delicious reaction Tony calling him Sir. It didn’t seem to matter how irreverent Tony was being about it (and actually sometimes Steve seemed to respond more strongly when Tony was being playful and silly with the title); Steve always licked his lips and shivered just a little. Every time. Tony mentally pictured him stopping in the middle of campus as he read Tony’s text, that adorable quiver running down the length of his spine. (Would it be creepy to try to find security footage later?)
“I’ll see a Dom over the weekend and have the paperwork on your desk by next Monday. May I be excused, Director?” He wanted to make her stay, he really did. But the things he wanted to say, the assurances and support he wanted to offer, he didn’t trust himself to be speaking to her just as her supervisor—it was possible he wouldn’t really be speaking to her at all, or at least not exclusively. And the last thing the beautiful, brave woman in front of him needed was to feel was that any further boundaries between her professional and personal lives were being violated. That was the very least he could do.
If the moment hadn’t been so intense, Steve would have wished for a camera to capture the almost dopey look of surprise that came across Bucky’s face then; it was right out of a comic book or a silent film, right down to the slack jaw and the huge, wide eyes. Bucky was often as guarded as Natasha with his expressions, but then Tony Stark had always been something a little different, hadn’t he?
“From the sounds of it, they didn’t come together again as quickly. I was the first one back—cut my trip short when I found out that Tony was taking on all the clean up himself. Is it possible that his didn’t, and that maybe that had a kind of ripple effect where the whole team was delayed in getting back together?”
“Yeah.” Recalling Bruce’s parting demand, that he tell the team if he needed or wanted anything in between the aftercare and their meeting, he grudgingly added, “Just. Maybe stay there while you tell me about this. For reasons. Who’s Jessica Drew?”
“I’d assumed you’d want me naked,” he commented, mainly trying to redirect his own attention away from the scrap of fabric in his hands. “I mean, they usually—”
Dummy, who had been circling the island, sped over to Steve and began beeping furiously. Steve was not nearly as skilled as Bucky had become with translating the robot’s noises, but they were too low in pitch and slow to sound like his usual happy greetings. There was some kind of distress woven in there, and a few seconds later they were accompanied by Tony muttering,
After extracting no less than five promises from Tony that they would spend more time together soon, the Hulk consented with relatively good grace to giving Bruce back control of his body. Tony could easily have spent an additional few hours quizzing Bruce on all the details of how he was going about training the Hulk to share a consciousness without provoking a physical transformation, but Bruce impatiently herded him into the elevators, mumbling about Hulk having already put them behind.
“I…I don’t remember much about the fight. She…she had us separated for most of it, spread across the city chasing our own tails. I was in Queens, I remember because she was all for symbolism, so she had me running through Flushing Meadows by all the old Wold’s Fair relics. But I don’t remember how many guys I fought or—I mean, the Fridge was
Tony had taken more selfies in the past several days than he had for the rest of his life in total. It was one of the weirder aspects of his new routine: the team had asked him to send pictures at regular intervals to update them about his day, especially if they were spending most of it apart. He’d expected it to wear off quickly, and had tried to at least manage the silliness of it by sending the pictures to a different person every day instead of bombarding them all in a group message.
Steve was damn near in love with Rhodes by the time lunch was over. He’d always liked the guy fine, of course, and he’d been excited, mainly for Tony’s sake, to see what he would bring to their dynamic. He just hadn’t expected to find himself caring so deeply and so quickly for the other man himself.
“Stop unless you want to kill us all.”
(See the end of the chapter for
No one had had any clue how Tony might respond to their first group scene, so there had been a number of plans and alternatives depending on how long and how far it seemed like the submissive would be able and willing to go. Bruce, however, seemed to be reaching the same conclusion that Steve himself was, which was that to push Tony much further today might put him down further than he was really prepared to go. He shook his head in Natasha, Clint, and Phil’s direction; far from seeming bothered by the news that they wouldn’t get a chance with Tony, the three of them immediately got busy with one another, kissing and petting and caressing as they watched the scene in front of them play out. Bruce, meanwhile, stepped forward and rapped his hand around Tony’s dick, thumbing lightly at the head.
anywhere than at Talia, whose rapt gaze alternated between the window of the plane and the woman standing next to her.
of all people refilling Tony’s coffee while chatting happily away about some book they’d both decided to read about algorithms and systemic oppression. Natasha had teasingly called their plan to get back together and discuss it after reading a book club, and Phil had jumped on the idea, arguing that having an external push to make time for non-SHIELD related reading would be welcome. By the time Steve had made a hurried exit back to his own floor, several of them had been planning on making a whole evening of it early next week. It wasn’t togetherness in the same way it had been with their own Tony, of course; even aside from the absence of orientational dynamics, there was still the occasional awkward pause or conversational misstep. But those were fewer and farther between compared to when Steve had left for Wakanda, and tempered by unmistakable signs of affection and understanding on both sides.
“Uh oh. Trying to run around the block again?”
It would have been easier, he guessed, if he and Tony had been attracted to each other, if they could have just been everything the other needed. If Rhodey was the guy to use that kind of language, he certainly would have called Tony his soulmate in every way that mattered. But even after Tony had come of age, James had never been able to entirely let go of the image of a scared, sick fourteen year old, sobbing at his feet and begging to be told, "just one time, Rhodey, promise, just once," that he was good. Tony, likewise, had never seemed to regard James as anything beyond a kind of big-brother figure.
“Natasha.” She came awake suddenly and completely, the way that most soldiers Tony knew did. “Help me?” Her face was warm concern and complete, focused attention as she nodded, reaching out to brush a strand of hair away from his face.
Other than a general warning for angst, I don't think there are any specific warnings needed for this chapter. As always, feel free to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
“I went to the Dom as promised. The shrink has the paperwork to prove it. So if this is some kind of babysitting exercise it’s really not necessary, Director.”
“That…that is not reassuring.”
Finally,
“Then stop trying to make me come in under two minutes like a damn frat boy!” Tony yelped. Clint retaliated with a long, slow swirl of his tongue around the head of Tony’s cock, and that was it, this was going to be the end of Tony’s ability to make words, or sense of any kind. He started pulling at the restraints with more intent than usual, half-formed, panicky thoughts about not wrecking a scene that had barely had a chance to start chasing through his mind.

Even if Steve didn’t know that this woman had level ten clearance, or that everyone in SHIELD who had worked with her spoke of Dr. Domen with nothing but reverence bordering on fear, he would have known she was not quite as unthreading as she appeared. Nat would never have chosen somehow who’d go easy on him, plus there was a quiet air of absolutely precision about this woman (the angle at which she’d rearranged the chairs, the way she sat still without seeing stiff) that was too encompassing to be an accident or an act. Typically, Steve liked people who were capable of upsetting expectations like that, but today…well, today he was not remotely in the mood.
“We really need to get some food and water into him. And Pepper wants to speak to Nat at some point, whenever we trade shifts.”
Content Notes: Okay, the first half of this chapter is a lot of porn. It picks up immediately after where last chapter ended, so we're dealing with the after-effects of the safeword (all of which are handled safely and ethically, at least to my mind.) The actual sex includes cockwarming, objectification and a bit of exhibitionism, both fantasy and real. If you wish to skip the section, pick up reading after the section break. And as always, let me know if you have questions or concerns.
“Any grievances to add to Clint’s list?” Natasha asked, tracing her fingers leisurely through his Tony’s hair. Steve couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen her so openly proud of herself; Tony’s trust and submission meant everything to Nat, and to be the first to receive such a public show of it had her flying enough that she wasn’t even trying to hide it. “SI has kept you busy this week. Has the the transition been bad?”
“Bruce, I can’t, I can’t, hnnng—”
just the one time though, Stark?” Strange asked. The scorn and annoyance that had coloured most of his conversations with Tony were absent now.Strange had asked, it seemed, because he seemed to genuinely want to know what Tony thought, which was enough to make him tamp down on his urge to snark rather than give the inquiry any real thought.
Your comments and kudos are the most delightful motivation. I am loving hearing everyone's theories, speculation, and questions. Please keep them coming!
After Tony damn near had a breakdown at the sound of JARVIS’s voice things got a little…weird. Well, okay, the weirdness had started before that, like when a dead man fell out of a hole that opened up in Avenger’s Tower’s penthouse. The point is that once the AI had confirmed the presence of
But it, too, had been left in good and familiar hands, like those of Talia, who currently stood at the front of the conference room. A slender collar was nestled around her neck; Steve would have called the black leather simple, except for the fact that he suspected what looked like silver stitching was in fact thin layers of vibranium or an alloy. She wore it proudly, her head high and her shoulders back as she lectured about finding a balance between submission and agency.
“Of course, the problem we then ran into was the unpredictable interactions between the alien and human materials. Add to that the fact that Natasha threatened to burn SHIELD to the ground herself when she found out about the program and we decided to investigate other avenues.” Tony was strongly considering whether or not to offer information about Extremis when Coulson’s text alert sounded from beside him. (And was it Tony’s own ego making things up, or did Phil look almost regretful as he wiped the juice and seeds from his hands with a cloth, like he didn’t want to stop talking to Tony?)
The recipe also continues to evolve. He has experimented with different herb inclusions, including mint, and has promised to attempt a variation on a recipe Agent Barton found involving both strawberries and poprocks.
“The thing that’s in a couple of days. I want you to do it.”
“Well that’s up to you, Bucky. You don’t
Despite Tony’s fears about the murmured threat of multiple orgasms, Clint didn’t seem to be in a hurry after that. He wouldn’t even let Tony do anything about his hard-on, which didn’t abate much even as they sprawled out on the playroom bed.
“You wouldn’t have to. If the King is willing to accommodate SHIELD trainees, with compensation of course, we could easily have you split your time between here and New York.”
Once, Tony had thought Steve to be selfish in his grief, too. After Coulson, he’d stormed away, refused to take solace in being hailed as Phil’s fellow soldier. We aren’t soldiers, he’d spat. So when it was Tony who came to Steve as he sat staring blankly out at the haunting beauty of their setting, so eerily silent with half of the sounds of the natural world absent, he was grateful.
“I thought we could discuss how we’ll be spending the next few weeks before we all break off and start heading off to bed. Are you in a place to be able to do that, Tony?” A low, lazy grunt was the only reply their submissive gave them. “We thought a lot about how we would spend this time if we were lucky enough to get it. There are a few priority areas, we think, that all deserve some dedicated attention while we’re here, so we tried to develop a schedule that would see to all of those needs. In the mornings, you would have your check-ins with Bruce. For the first week you’ll spend the hour that follows with me, completing the homework you owe me as well as some additional writing tasks.” Tony muttered something anxious-sounding about Phil not needing pain to punish, and Coulson nodded unrepentantly. “In the afternoons, we thought we’d spend some time exploring your submission with you. Some days those might just be conversations—updating your contract, giving you space to ask any questions you have—but a lot of times we imagined more hands-on training. The kind of thing you would have received if you’d grown up here.”
“Please, Sir,” he pleaded, unsure if he was allowed to just sink down onto his Dominant the way his body was screaming out to do. Steve didn’t give a verbal answer; he lifted Tony bodily by the hips and eased him down onto his cock all on his own. His precise control over the speed of Tony's descent was incredible. It felt like he sank down by millimeters, and by the time Steve was finally fully seated, Tony was very nearly sobbing. “Holy god, Steve, Sir, you’re—fuck you’re big, you feel—pleeeeease Steve I need it, need you—holy FUCK Steve!” he swore as Steve lifted him again, then slammed him back down onto his cock, viciously spearing his prostate.
He found the object of his ire working not at his usual desk but on the penthouse couch. Phil was also wearing jeans, which Tony had never before seen him in (which looked to be a crime judging from the way they hugged Phil’s impressive thighs even sitting down), paired with a sinfully soft-looking black pullover. The sight was unexpected and distracting enough that it was several beats before he remembered why he had stomped his way there in the first place.
“Thought you might be hungry. We haven’t kept the fridge and pantry up here very well stocked lately.” And oh fuck, they were from Peter Pan and the light layer of condensation leaking through the bottom of the cardboard box meant they were still slightly warm. If there was a damn cruller in there Tony might weep.
Steve said her name then, in warning and alarm and out of reflex, because gags had been a very hard limit of the other Tony’s. He hadn’t minded the rest of the team using them around him, but even as some of his other needs and desires had shifted over the course of their relationship, Tony had remained steadfastly against being gagged under any circumstances. Natasha ignored Steve, and the rest of the team who were by now avidly watching what was unfolding, until she had settled the pillow in front of one of the long white couches, and placed the rest of the supplies she had gathered next to her.
When he could manage to speak again, he offered what explanation he could. He spoke of Natasha’s efforts to keep the team together after the Snap. He managed a brief explanation of her orphanage, how much she’d loved those kids and had been loved in return. He gasped his way through Vormir, explaining the decision his Natasha had made to give up her own life to save the world, and Clint in particular so that he would be able to go home to his wife and children. Bruce and Natasha listened without interrupting, though they both maintained constant contact with some part of Tony, whether it came in the form of wiping tears from his face or pressing kisses to his shoulder. When Tony had finished offering another apology, Natasha lifted his chin so she could stare him squarely in the face.
“The 31st floor is now locked down. Proceed to conference room 3-B for further instructions.” None of this was remotely similar to any of the protocols Tony had established in his own world to handle internal or external threats to the Tower. It was possible that the team had changed some of those things in the wake of their Tony’s death, but it still didn’t make sense for JARVIS to be giving them so little to go on, or directing them to a specific room rather than…than…
“Did you see him, yourself?’ Harley wanted to know as he wiped his nose on his coat. Strange winced and conjured a box of tissues. “Is he really okay?”
“Because I didn’t fucking know I could!” Tony had finally snapped back on the third day of back and forth on this exhausting topic. That, at least, took the righteous wind out of Steve’s sails, though seeing the heartbroken look on his face as he all but collapsed into the nearest chair was hardly much better. For once, Tony didn’t fight the instinct to curl up at Steve’s feet, leaning his body against his Dominant’s with a heavy sigh.
It was a slight and subtle movement. Hell, his body was so out of practice with orientation-based interactions that he was surprised he didn't creak like the Tin Man pre getting oil in his joints. When he dared look back at Gwen, he found the space she had just been occupying a moment ago empty. On the low table in front of him sat a brightly coloured flyer, inviting him to a house party at Liz’s in three days time where Gwen’s band Fridged would apparently be providing the live entertainment.
going to ask to kneel, dammit. They tried to keep orientation stuff out of dates, and besides, it had only been a couple of days since he’d last had much time for submission. There was no reason for his mind to convince itself he was in such desperate need for it.)
“Only JARVIS told you, or at least he damn well better have, that I locked all of that information down before I left.” JARVIS confirmed in his haughtiest tone that he had done just this, which made Rhodey lose at least some of the attitude and apologize to the AI. (Good. Tony hated it when they fought.)
And as always, let me know if you have other questions or concerns or would like to see a tag added.
“I loved my time at SHIELD. It felt…it was the first time I’d really gotten the chance to build something up instead of just tearing it down. I wasn’t sure until that point, until I saw it really starting to work, that I was even capable of that, you know? But it’s time. SHIELD needs someone like Tony, now, someone who revels in—maintenance, I guess. Constantly refining something. He’s never, ever satisfied, never lets himself off the hook, and that’s exactly what SHIELD needs now.” Somewhere around halfway through this rambling explanation, Steve realized that Dr. Domen’s tablet wasn’t in her hands. For the first time, it hadn’t even come out of her bag. “Wait, no notes? Am I boring now?” She smiled and took a sip from the steaming cup of peppermint tea he’d made her at the start of their session.
loss had all but torn Tony’s mind and heart in two; as the boy had lay dying, pleading for his life (
The return of Steve’s forties drawl paired with what Tony knew to be an outright bit of fiction about how Steve had spent his day was enough to finally clue Tony in. This was a game Steve was playing, one that built directly on how hot it had made both of them the day Tony had confessed that he wanted to retire his role as Iron Man. At that point, Tony had been desperate to reassure Steve that he didn’t want to be some kind of kept man, watching everyone else go off to work while he lazed around the Tower, but now it seemed Steve wanted to role-play exactly that dynamic, casting himself as the dutiful working man, and Tony as his voluntarily unemployed, doted-on partner.
(See the end of the chapter for
This…this was different. The scale of the destruction was impossible for her to even comprehend; it stretched in every direction she looked, as far as she could see. There were open portals and the lingering traces of other magic, bodies strewn across the ground with no care or ceremony…several of which vanished to dust in front of Natasha’s eyes.
of stuff about moose.
the Hulk instead of the amalgam that he and Bruce had formed to fight Thanos. It was also a sudden and harsh reminder that Tony had no idea at all where Bruce and Hulk stood in this universe. They functioned well enough in a fight, that much Tony had been able to tell watching them the other day. Outside those situations where they agreed to focus on an immediate threat, though, what was their relationship like? Did Bruce still despise and resent the Hulk, the way he had those first few years in Tony’s universe? Was he working on different ways to reign in the Hulk’s power and rage? Had this version of Bruce taken another approach entirely?
I am imminently surprised this question has not yet come up, though the focus rather does seem to be on Stark, doesn’t it? (Surprise surprise…)
“Mmm. Lots of very dull meetings that made me wish I was here with you instead.” Tony frowned, unreasonably irritated with these fictional people who had bored Steve and kept him from Tony. He pressed himself closer to his Dominant, as if he could make up for the minor irritations of Steve’s week through touch alone. “I watched you on the cameras sometimes, whenever I could get away with being a little distracted.”
“Oh please, I know exactly what Clint would do if we swapped bodies, and it definitely does not involve cartoons. Listen, we can still do the fancy date thing if that’s what you would prefer, but it’s been a hell of a few days. I thought you might like to just relax a little. Rhodes said you all used to watch cartoons in your dorms on Saturday mornings, and, well…” Coulson waved a hand toward the cereal and the Scooby Gang, and Tony loved every inch of the guy in that second, right down to his pink-slippered feet. He still wasn’t entirely clear on some of the details of why, but he knew it was sometimes hard on the team that he was closer to Rhodey and Pepper than Mark II had been. And yet Phil had asked for Rhodey’s help, and had gone so far out of his own comfort zone in planning this date, solely to make Tony smile at the end of an endlessly long week.
“It was an open declaration of war, and I knew that caving on that would mean setting a precedent to either become nothing but a figurehead, or find myself out of a job in under a year. After that their methods got…more creative.” Tony was positive she hadn’t mentioned this part before, because it was impossible to miss the way her body closed in on itself, becoming smaller before his eyes. Even if Tony’s brain was all the way broken he would never miss anything that made Pepper look like that, because it made him instantly, powerfully murderous.
“Is that…is that what you like?” he asked, tipping his head back and allowing her to carefully wet his hair down.
“You…warm.” This was not the first complaint Steve had ever received from a partner about the serum’s impact on his base body temperature, and he regretfully made to roll over and put a bit of distance between he and Tony; the second he tried Tony was reaching out to clutch almost desperately at him.
“Yes,” DJ said.  He moved the plate a little closer to himself, and away from Tony.
“It's my fault,” Steve said, his voice quiet.  “I'm the one who-”
There was a long moment of silence, and then, a small, high pitched giggle.
“I’m too tired to get turned on,” Tony said, which was absolutely, totally, 100% a lie, and judging by the way that Steve’s eyes danced, he knew it  “Okay, so I’m rather painfully aroused, I’m too tired to do anything about it.”
Tony paused.  "I honestly don't know," he said, his hands propped on his hips.  "I just know that there's china.  And some of it is 'good.'"  He looked at Steve.  "That's what the caterers use when I'm throwing a sit down dinner party."
Steve caught his waist, his breath hitching in his throat.  “Oh, will you?” he asked, amused.
“I tried reading the SHIELD one.  Think I nodded off around page three,” Jess said.  “What'd they do, just copy and paste their HR policy on inter-department relationships?”
“Safe.”  He exhaled, and his breath curled in front of him, like the air had gone cold in an instant.  “Somewhere safe,” he said, and his fingers were burning, right down to the bone.
“Tony?”  She leaned in, her hands smoothing over his cheeks. “Tony.  Breathe.”
Steve stared at them.  "But why-"
Everything will be okay, though.  It's a damn musical, guys, it's gotta have a happy ending.  I mean.  It's not a SONDHEIM musical, so it's gotta have a happy ending. 8D
Morrison's face twitched. “You know what-”
Steve nodded.  “Not at all,” he said.
He flew around a corner, his shoes skidding along the floor, and he rocked back, trying to keep his balance without slowing down.  The crowd had thinned out to almost nothing, a boy in a wizard’s robe sitting against the wall with his phone plugged into the wall, and a woman with two kids sitting in an alcove with a lunch box and crayons scattered across the floor in front of her.  She looked up as Harris passed, a faint frown chasing itself across her face, a flicker of concern, but all she did was reach out, tugging one of the little girls to sit closer to her.
Tony tried his best to stare him down.  He was not successful.  Heaving a sigh, he waved a languid hand at the room.  “Fine.  Truth.  Honesty.  All that jazz.”
“I agree, it’s not something that is any of my business,” Peter rushed on, the words bumping up against each other.
Trip looked at the kid, who wasn’t looking at either of them.  His fingers were hovering over the wood of the chapel’s doorway, almost but not quite touching.  Her gaze swung back to the blonde, and she opened the bottom drawer on the desk.  “Look,” she said, her voice pitched low.  “You didn’t get this from me, but here.”  She pulled a card from the drawer and put it on the desk, printed side down.  She slid it across the desk with one fingertip.  “Call this number.  They do good work for people who need help with immegration and naturalization, they can provide a measure of protection until-”
“It's a proportional response,” Gyrich said.  “Something that I specialize in.  Which is why I'm not having you all detained for damage to government property.”
“Where?”
Rogers sighed.  “Please don't let him-”
Steve looked at Natasha, not sure what to say.  “Maybe make him some fried eggs and bacon?” she said to Clint.  She gave Steve a once over, her eyes sliding over him.  “And some potatoes?”
He crossed to the bed, and reached out, one hand brushing gently over DJ’s head.  When his eyes fluttered open, Tony smiled down at him, his expression warm and open for an instant.  “Wake up, sleepyhead,” he said, his voice soft.  “He’s back.”
Stark's lips twitched.  "Try harder," he said, and Steve hid his smile behind his book.
She nodded again.  "Why him?”
"He had a nightmare," Jarvis said.  "And when he woke up, he was...  Smaller."
“Occasionally, you do a better job of pacifying them,” Coulson said.  “Tell me what you did.”
As they pulled up in front of house, Bobbi leaned forward, bracing one arm on the back of the seat in front of her.  “I’ll put it in the garage.”
One of Steve's shoulders rose and fell, a half shrug.  “You're going to fire me eventually, sir  Probably because I piss off someone above you.  At least this, I feel like I'm being fired for the right reasons.”
"No," he repeated, giving Steve a look.  Steve just grinned at him.  "Do not encourage her."  To Jan, he said, "If you want plates, you can rent them."
“I mean, less good, but still a step up from-” Harris’ eyes jerked down towards Darcy’s sleeping form, then back up.  “A lot of things.”  His fingers were gentle on her hair, separating the strands into soft waves.  “A whole lot of things.”
"Not a problem.  Just unexpected."  He rocked back on his heels, his arms crossed over his chest.  Even when he was still, he gave the impression of being in motion.  Like there was some sort of energy churning in him that was barely under control.  "I wasn't aware that drafting was a skill taught by the police force."
Tony gave him a look.  "Please.  You've worn a few in your time, too." He put his hands up on either side of his head, his thumbs planted on his temples and his fingers wiggling.  "And wings.  Tiny, adorable wings."
“But I learned my lesson the last time,” Bruce finished.  “I, uh, I still have no idea what happened to my shoes or either of my melon ballers.”
Then DJ threw his juice box at Strange’s head.
“You think that PARKER can keep me in line?” Tony asked, incredulous.  “PARKER?”
He stared at her, wondering if this conversation was supposed to make sense.  "But I don't NEED-"
“No girls allowed,” Val said, and her foot thumped against the side of the workbench.  “That IS what you meant.”
DJ's face fell, and Peter straightened up.  "I can help him take care of it," he said.  Tony gave him a look, and Peter didn't seem to notice.  "And he'll be good, he'll be useful, I mean, there's always going to be mice, and maybe with this, all we have to do-"
Stark looked at him, his face relaxing into a lopsided smile.  Without thinking, Tony smiled back, a mirror image of that smile.  “Know what?” Stark asked.  “This Parent Trap shit’s growing on me.”  He slid into the back seat.
The door slammed shut, and Tony found himself staring at nothing in particular.  “Did you set me up?” he asked, from behind his armload of flowers.
“Right,” Clint said, because Clint didn’t get thrown by much  “Glad to see you in one piece.”
“Get your own, Barton.” She opened up the packing box, pulling out chia pet after chia pet.  “Some of these are…”
Tony would take it.
“Hey!” Clint spread his hands.  “I'm up, I'm going, and fuck you, anyway, because any time anyone's asked me for something for that kid, I have shown up.”  He snatched a shirt from the basket and stomped towards the door.  “I might be useless, but I'm always there.”
“This is the most Catholic thing I’ve ever seen you do, and that’s, that is saying something,” Tony pointed out.
“Nowhere fast, I suspect,” Tony shot back.  He turned on his heel and stomped back down the hallway to the registration desk.  The girl in the appalling hat looked up from her phone with a bright smile.  Tony tried to smile back. “Hi-”
Tony took a deep breath. “He’s not simple,” he said, and Obie threw his hands in the air.  “He’s not.  He’s almost done with his clock, did I tell you that?  Put it back together, without instruction, without plans, by memory, it’s-”
“I never want to see food again,” Rhodey said.  “I don’t know what hurts more, my neck or my stomach.”
He met Steve’s eyes.  “Which results in another, even more difficult problem: when these children do find someone they want to…”  He paused.  “Associate with, then the answer, to them, is simple.  If everyone in the world is after them for their money, well, then…” He spread his hands.  “Why not give it to them?”
“Ah-” Rogers started, and Tony shook his head.
“You have a better relationship with your ex-girlfriend than most people have with their spouses,” Steve pointed out.
“Uh-” he said, which was almost a word, it was as close as he could get to a word, because Tony was working the damp fabric away from his skin, cursing under his breath as he peeled the top of the suit away from his shoulders.  The muscles of his chest and shoulders flexed, and Steve turned away, desperate for something, anything else to look at.
“He looked good in the curly thing she did,” Ellen said.  She held up a picture.  “Where did you get this one?”
“Bien,” Tony said, setting the timer on the broccoli.
“Understatement of the year,” Happy said.  He picked up his toolbox.  “Jarvis wants you to drive Rogers back to the city?”
“How bad was it?” Bucky asked, moving his legs out of reach.
"As it turns out, he thinks that the trellis is easier to climb than a fire escape ladder," Tony said.  "If he's on the roof, I'm going to-"
*Meanwhile, across the universe divide*
"It's different with grass and trees and clean air,” Rogers said.  “But if it's easier for you to handle, then no.” He smiled.  “We don't have sunlight in Manhattan.  So why not experience it now?”
“Coney Island,” DJ said.  “Yes.”
“Maybe,” Carol said.
Tony grinned at him.  "Excuse me, that's my job."  Steve's hand fell away, and Tony caught it before he could withdraw it completely.  Gently, he wove their fingers together, giving Steve room and space to pull away, if he wanted to.  Instead, Steve hooked his fingers through Tony's, just as cautious, just as tentative.
Steve’s lips twitched.  “You were, were you?”
The elevator came to a stop with a soft ding, and she slipped out, bracing her bag on her hip. "Hey, Celia," she said, pausing halfway to her desk. "Have you seen-"
“Right, I do that, I probably shouldn’t, but I’m sure I didn’t mean for you to use it.”  Tony wondered if he’d survive a trip to the kitchen.  Coffee might be worth dying for.
The color leeched out of his Bruce's face.  “No,” he repeated, but it had taken on a desperate note.  “Jane, that was-”
"Of course, sir," Jarvis said.  He didn't move.
"He's very, very good at picking up non-verbal cues, it's true," Tony said. "And he does get a raise every time he makes a problem disappear."
Tony took a breath, and his chest ached with the force of it.  “No one leaves the grounds until further notice,” he said, his voice quiet.  “Make sure the foreman knows, if he can’t account for his men, he’ll be held responsible in their stead.”
Steve stared up at it, stymied.  It was flanked on all sides by huge metal tables, piled high with boxes of bottles and tubs of glassware.  There were other tables, there, smaller ones covered with a variety of unfamiliar equipment, and racks upon racks of seedlings.  There were round glass jugs labeled with rows of what seemed like random letters, and metal tins stacked on wooden shelves.
"It's for Tony," she said, and he stopped.
And a kid he was never going to see again.
"How old are you?" Tony asked. He was struggling not to smile, his eyes dancing.
“We need plates,” Bruce said, the words a little too close together, a little too rushed.  “I’ll go get some.”  And before Tony could do anything more than draw a breath, Bruce was through the door and gone, slipping into the elevator doors before Jarvis could get them closed.
“Book club,” Okoye said.
The smell of powdered ink.  The slight scent of decay, a quick, damp scent that made him think of mold.  The faint hint of smoke that lingered in every room of the old brownstone, sulfur and brimstone and the smell of dry leaves in the depths of fall.
Clint shrugged again.  “Does it hurt?”  He held up a shirt emblazoned with the logo ‘Old Enough to Know Better, Still Young Enough to Do It.’   “What do you think?”
Peter was still nodding. “I…  Don’t remember five MINUTES ago,” he admitted.
DJ smiled.  “Yes.”
Tony glanced back at him, a smile curling his lips.  “Probably,” he said, his voice laconic.  “It’s your room, after all.” He held up an arm, watching as the sleeve slid back to settle against his elbow, the fireplace poker held almost like a sword. “It would make perfect sense that this is your shirt.”
“I suspect he expects nothing less,” Pepper said.  She reached for her bag.  “Which is why this contains about twenty legible words.”
“Yeah, you told me all right,” he said.  He pushed himself upright.  “In my defense-”  He paused.  “Atlantic City.”
Steve didn't move.  “Nope.”
“Of course not.”  Tony glanced around the room. “There’s no reason to…”  His voice trailed away as he tried to think.  He shoved a hand through is hair, and his fingers were shaking.  “The guards know he’s still here.  And every delivery man who’s come to the kitchen in the last month or so has seen him.”
“Stop hurting her,” DJ said, and both of them went silent.
Steve looked up, meeting Jarvis’s eyes.  “I can wake him if something’s-”
“Tell me no.”  Stark shrugged.  “Pretty sure I owe you.”
“Of course,” Jarvis said, as if that made sense.
“We were barely expecting these people for dinner,” Stark told him.  “We were expecting roughly half of these people.”
He reached for the handle of the door, and Tony realized that Steve had straightened up outside, his hands falling to his sides.  Beyond him, Harris was coming up the sidewalk, DJ darting back and forth in front of him.  He stumbled on the edge of the curb, and Harris snagged him by the back of his hoodie, hauling him back to his feet.
“Yes,” he said, leaning over the railing.  “Yes, it is, and perhaps we can avoid breaking it again before I even manage to collect my fee?”
“You don't know-” Peter started and Tony turned a gimlet gaze on him, and he swallowed the word mid-syllable.  “Right, Chef.  I'll just-”  He waved at the door, his feet tangling as he scrambled in that direction.  “I'll just go and, and do that, I'll be-”
"None at all," DJ said, the words careful.  He gave Tony a hopeful look.  "Stay?"
Benito’s shoulders were shaking, despite maintaining a straight face.  He leaned over, digging through the refrigerator behind the sandwich station.  “Here.” He came back up, holding a cup of fruit salad in one big hand.  There was a piece of masking tape on the top, Darcy’s name hand printed across it.  “I put some aside before we added the grapes.”
“Really.”  Shuri looked at him, her eyes wide.  “Where did-”
Steve managed to get the jacket buttoned, ducking his head to hide his smile.  "Jarvis, with me?  'Close enough' is about as fashionable as I'm likely to get."
“Do I look pleased?” Steve asked.  “Because that’s not-”
Carol leaned back against the lockers, her hips canted forward.  “Next time?  Ask us.” She gave a firm nod.  “We have lots of advice.”
Steve picked his way up the main aisle, frowning down at the beds of delicate greens and vegetables he had no name for.  Everything smelled faintly of wet soil, that thick smell that came in the wake of a heavy rainstorm, and the floor was still damp. He glanced up, staring at the network of pipes that ran along just under the glass panes of the ceiling.  There were sprinkler heads there, some of them still dripping.
Pepper struggled not to smile.  “I don’t think that burying you under the furnace is a sustainable solution, Tony.”
“In as many words.”  They rounded the house, heading back to the front door.  “Anyway, they got me out of the station and into the car, and I was almost rabid by that point, I was wondering if I could punch him in the throat and make a run for it, and I probably would’ve tried it, but Happy had me by the back of my collar and-”
He picked up his phone before it could finish the first ring.  "You're late."
The way his shoulders and arms flexed when he slung the massive piles of dough certainly didn't hurt Tony's mood either.
Tony looked up.  His AI sounded tired.  That was never a good sign.  “And I have an answering machine.” He reached for his coffee cup, pointing it at the camera before taking a sip of the cold contents.  Apparently, he’d been working longer than he’d thought  “It’s you.”
Tony reached out, separating one stem from the bunch.  “For obvious reasons,” Tony said.  He rolled the stem between his fingertips, letting the light of the lobby skylights play over the bloom.  “How many did you buy?”
And the beginnings of a plan.  A terrible, horrible plan.
Steve took a breath.  And another.  There was blood on the pavement, dark spots smeared by dozens of panicked feet.  But Steve could smell it, metallic and clangy, he could nearly taste it in the back of his throat.
Tony stared at him blankly.  "We did?" he asked at last.
Bucky slid down the ladder, rattling the rungs on the way.  “No, seriously-” he started, as a raggedy looking black and white cat with one lopsided ear came scrambling down the ladder after him, leaping neatly onto his shoulder.  Bucky did his best not to flinch, but he wasn’t entirely successful.  His head tipped as far away from it as he could get, he gritted out, “Get it off of me.”
“Even if you can’t,” Steve repeated, “I can’t imagine not having it.”
“I know.  But you know me, and you know Tony, and if both of us trust her...” Pepper said.
Tony wandered around the table.  "Well, that's what I get for trying to be subtle," he said, his voice flippant.  Steve started to say something else and Tony cut him off, leaning his hips back against the table.  "Do you really want to do this?"
She smiled at him.  “That one was Tony's design,” she said, nodding towards his holster.  “I'm sure he'd be glad to know it's served you well.”
“You know you can just ask Hank for a kiss, right?” Tony asked.
“Shears?” Clint asked.
“You absolutely can not,” Harris said, and she was laughing as she wiggled across the bed towards him.  He took a deep breath, and she was so close that she was breathing the same air, her lips almost brushing his.  “But I”m looking forward to the attempt.”
Laughing, she walked around the couch and settled down on the floor next to Clint’s legs.  DJ waited for her to settle down, the silk of her silver pajamas rustling as she tucked her feet under her, before he pushed a large box over next to her.  She reached out, smoothing his hair back with gentle hand.  “Thank you,” she said.
Sam tilted his head in Steve's direction.  "Steve?"
“You should’ve stopped him before he got this far,” May said.  “Pardon me, Mr. Stane.”
“Wow.  No.”  Which was a lie.  A lie that he was comfortable with.
“How long?” Tony asked, and Steve stopped.  Tony leaned in.  “How long?”  Steve opened his mouth, and Tony’s hand shot up, his index and middle fingers pressing against Steve’s lips.  “Don’t answer that. Don’t-”  He leaned in.  “Kiss me.”
"Human shield, that's me," Carol said, her hands on her hips.  “And Nat's bringing Clint, he's used to being collateral damage.”
“We talking physically or mentally?”
The lights were glowing inside the little cottage, smoke curling from the top of the chimney.
Hammer came to his feet so fast that his chair rolled back to hit the wall with a thump.  “You-” he started, and Pepper turned a wide-eyed, innocent look in his direction.  He pulled himself up short.  “Ah.  Miss Potts.”  He straightened his tie with fingers that weren't quite steady.  “This...”  His teeth dug in on the words.  “Young man missed morning roll call.  So.  He's been-”
"I wiped it down first," Tony said, just to make Steve wince.  He balanced the salad on one hip as he pulled out plates and bowls.  "You're awfully squeamish for a man who was fed by the US Army during wartime."
DJ narrowed his eyes.  “Murder,” he said, his voice firm, and Tony pressed a hand to his face.
Steve’s arms tightened, an involuntary flex of his muscles, and Tony stroked the nape of his neck, rubbing the tense muscles there.  “Yes,” Steve said, and Tony nodded.
“Really.”  Tony’s eyes flicked from side to side, studying Steve’s face for something, something that Steve couldn’t define.  “And what, exactly, am I?”
“Donut float is mine,” DJ told Hulk, who nodded.
“And what do you want?” Tony wanted anger, he wanted rage, he grasped desperately for that.  Anger like a heavy coat that he could wrap around himself, rage that could shelter him, that could be a shield.  But his voice sounded broken, empty.
“No,” Tony said.
“And what would those be?” Steve asked.
“It's 'let my tech rock your world,' actually,” Tony said.  Steve stared at him, his mouth hanging open just a little.  Tony grinned at him.  “What?”
Tony considered that.  “It’s a very long list,” he said.  He leaned his head back against the headrest, pressing the hot cup to his forehead.  “And I suspect it’s about to get a hell of a lot longer.  Did anyone see you?”
“What?” Clint glanced at her. “No.  No, it's not.  It's not going to-”  He gave her hand a little tug.  “It's not going to kill you.  We're not going to let that happen.”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said.  “Especially not with me.”  He reached in front of Tony, collecting the plate.  Tony had no idea what had happened to the sandwich that had been on it.  “After all, what would I possibly know about unexpectedly finding oneself charged with the care and keeping of a child?”
"Committed," she said.
Tony smiled.  “I’d call it a war room,” he said.  “Or a conference room.”
DJ blinked up at him.  "Cat," he said, with a great deal of confidence.
“But mostly tequila,” Tony agreed with a grin.  He drained the cup and tossed it over his shoulder.  “Like I said.” He stood, ignoring the way the world shifted under him.  “I gave up.”
“Question,” Clint said, his chin leaning on the back of his chair.  “Does anyone in this room feel the need to be in any way truthful with the press?”
“No,” everyone said at once.
“Yes.  Yes, I did,” Natasha said.  “However, if you were better at being a distraction, you wouldn’t have gotten caught.”
“I’m sure she would’ve preferred that,” Tony said.  “In that she could blame you for it, and invest well in wigs.” He flicked at the hair that curled against her cheek.  It swung right back into place, and she gave him a smug smile.  Tony smiled back.  “Has she gotten you fitted for one yet?”
DJ nodded.  “Me, too.”
How strange could a place be, how alien, how foreign could it be, after all, if Tony was there, his shoulder brushing against Steve's, smiling in that way he did when he was happy.  When nothing was perfect, but that was fine.
Obie frowned, taking a sip from his glass.  “Tastes just fine to me,” he said.  He arched an eyebrow.  “Want a fresh cup?”
This might’ve been a mistake.
“Yeah?” Steve said.  “Do you like it?”
“Really?” Steve reached around him, snagging a pea pod from the box  on the other side of his hips.  “Good to know.”
“Ever evolving, sir, and might well be different tomorrow night.”  Jarvis opened the connecting door, revealing DJ waiting on the other side.  Jarvis smiled down at him.  “A case in point.”
Tony rolled over, his legs tangling in the fabric of the blankets as he struggled into a upright position.  Bruce was in one of the chairs next to the windows, a book open on his lap.  He pulled off his glasses, squinting in Tony’s direction. “Steve went to take a look at DJ’s room,” he said with a faint, apologetic smile.  “How’re you feeling?”
There, standing in the mouth of the alley, a slim, elegant figure in all black was holding onto the front of the mob leader’s shirt.  He hung, limp and silent from her hand, and her fingers uncurled, letting him fall to the pier with a muted thump.  Around her feet, there were half a dozen still forms, and in the distance, Steve could hear the echoes of footsteps and curses as the last fragments of the mob fled.
He had to stall.
“Don’t pick customer’s pockets,” he said, his voice hard.  To Steve, he said, “I’m sorry, my apprentice is a bit…”  His mouth worked.  “Impetuous.”
