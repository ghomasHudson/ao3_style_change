Steve nods gingerly as Tony walks past him and toward the exit, and takes a few deep breaths in hopes of gaining enough composure to be able to follow. It’s not as if Steve didn’t know that Commander Stark is handsome, smart, and charming; Steve had gathered as much from his file, although he looks even better in person. It’s just that some rather life-changing information that Steve's just found out was not mentioned in his personnel file.
“It’s ok buddy, I never thought you might be a corporate spy or something. You look too innocent for that, to be honest.” and his smile goes lopsided again making Steve smile too.
“Thank you,” Steve said, his eyes fastened to the floor before him. Tony looked down too and the holes in Steve’s shoes caught his eyes like always. Who wore shoes with holes in them when they could wear new ones? Who returned a simple gift like Italian shoes? ‘The Art of Keeping Your Omega Content’ was definitely written by an ignorant alpha who would burn in hell for the lies he'd published in a book that cost a small fortune.
Tony’s face twitches into a shadow of a lopsided smile. “I had no one else to call. Can you believe it? Pepper’s in Malibu with her shiny new job and Rhodey’s deployed somewhere top secret, he calls every other week to tell me he’s alive.”
. He sat on Tony’s bed and was  very gentle when he told Tony that he needs to be more respectful. That he needs to shut the fuck up, smile and never say no. That Tony was lucky to have Ty to take care of him and his company, and he should try to do better next time because Ty was all he had left after his parents' deaths.
It feels like a foreign language at first, as Tony has never had to deal with anything to do with microbiology, but the thrill of learning something new wins him over after the first few articles, and he loses track of time reading about virus strains, genomes and the million different methods of isolation and characterization, and the relationship between the original virus genetic and vaccine development. He writes some modeling codes and calls Bruce after JARVIS’s fifth failed attempt at rendering it, for an hour-long chat that leaves him with a fried brain leaking out of his ears. He has to read through a full course of vaccinology references tomorrow if he actually wants to make some sense of what Bruce is portraying as their only chance of developing a vaccine.
It’s just hormones, he tells himself, the stupid alpha protectiveness, the urge to knot the omega and break him in. It’s nothing other than the alpha need to keep the omega safe and happy, to just keep the omega, forever and ever, to just have and to just hold.
“You are not allergic to peanuts, Tony?” Tony turns and Sam’s face is as calming as his voice. He shakes his head and Sam taps on Captain Rogers’ shoulder a couple of times before he walks around the bed to stand next to Nat and Clint. “Strawberry jam? You should buy some blueberry jam, Steve.”
Steve’s grip tight around Bucky’s back, Bucky’s face buried in Steve’s chest, Steve’s body sliding on Bucky’s just the way it always moved on top of his. Tony was suddenly burning all over.
He points to his strained neck, and watches Tony as he tilts his head to brush his lips against that spot. It’s chaste and gentle and it burns from the point of contact right down to Steve’s heart. He then trails up Steve’s throat, to kiss the spot Steve has pointed to on his chin, then his cheek, then his nose, all the way to his painful, possibly-bloody temple.
erect cock.
He is still hungry but he can’t eat more than a bite of the tiramisu cheesecake. The cheesecake is probably delicious though; Ty has finished his and Captain Rogers is scraping the last bits of it off his plate.
Was this all Tony’s imagination, though? The way Steve went pale before blushing all over and loosening his grip on Bucky’s shoulders? Bucky jumped, literally, off the bed as soon as he saw Tony at the door and shoved his hands into his pocket. The air in the room stilled for a second before Steve turned and smiled at Tony.
Easy. Full.
Tony caresses Steve’s hair and brushes the side of his face. “Don’t say that sweetheart, you need some alien grade glue to get selfish to stick to you.”
The door swings open right then as if Steve has sensed Tony’s miserable presence. He nods, and a tightness in Tony’s chest goes loose, and his smile shines a little light on the dark gloomy world.
It’s amazing how Tony’s hands start to shake when they reach Steve’s ass. It’s a novel moment for Tony as much as it would be for Steve, and Tony is thrilled and terrified at the same time. He does his best to be especially careful, as he slides his palm on Steve’s ass, and God, it’s firm and smooth and so fucking perfect that Tony wants to squeal with joy. He runs his palm on each of Steve’s cheeks, in small circles and watches the way Steve’s body tremors from the start to the end of each motion. Tony wraps his other hand around Steve to keep him still and he goes on drawing small circles on Steve’s ass. It’s just a breathtaking scene to witness;  the way Steve is coming apart in Tony’s arms, hard and blushing, from Tony's touch alone, with just one hand.
It never gets old, after two years, that first brush of Steve’s fingers against Tony’s cock. The thrill that tingles down Steve’s spine from the slick already soaking Tony’s thong, the pure bliss of slipping his two fingers into Tony’s warm inviting hole, and the way Tony goes pliant, completely. The rare moment of having him not fight back, even if it’s too short; it’s blink and you miss it.
“That’s a cheap shot, Johnny, even for FOX News,” Tony smirks and shakes his head. “In the middle of a rapidly evolving global crisis that we had no idea existed 4 days ago, all you care about is if I’ve picked up someone from a bar or if I’m getting any as I’m staying here for two weeks.” Tony looks above the camera right to where Steve is standing and it might all be the games in Steve’s brain, but he smiles and nods to Steve, and the blood starts to flow up in Steve’s veins again.
Steve loosens his grip for Tony to take his hand away and he opens his mouth again to attempt at making words one more time. “No, no, everything is perfect, Commander. I’m glad to finally meet you too,” he manages to get out while punctuating his short breaths between the words. “Any issues around here? You’ve done a fantastic job with your state-of-the-art engines,” he adds and pats himself on the back mentally because Tony’s face opens up into a bright smile that makes Steve’s heart skip a beat and do a flip all at the same time.
“I’m sorry you have to deal with stupid people like me instead of doing cool technology things.”
“Yes, himself. As in me. Tony Stark.”
“God, no, it’s nothing like that,” Steve almost yells, as if taking the modern age impotence treatment is something way more horrible compared to his current situation.
Steve can do this.
“I’m not avoiding you.”
Thoughts are rushing to slot in place, now that Steve’s fully awake. There is a virus sample to be retrieved from a Hydra base in the international waters somewhere east of Texas, SHIELD has known all along that Tony is Iron Man, well of course, and now…
Invisibility seems to be the most awesome superpower a person could have. It makes a strange kind of sense, Steve thinks, because invisible people do not end up in the Emergency Department on the 4th of July for being so stupidly strong, and they certainly don’t produce so much pre-come that would be enough to make a small puddle. And even if they did, they wouldn’t turn cherry red during a medical examination, just like Steve must be now, with the way his skin is burning all over.
“Of course,” Steve says, fully aware that he's staring at Tony and he might look somewhat creepy with the smile plastered on his face, making his cheeks hurt a little. “It’s amazing,” he adds, doing his best to tear his eyes off Tony’s face, and failing miserably. “You’re— your work is just amazing.” He coughs, feeling really hot suddenly, as Tony steps forward and places a hand on his shoulder.
“Complete,” he finally replies, and he falls into a dreamless, deep sleep.
He is not ready yet. He just can’t, here, to these people, as nice as they seem and as worried as they are. He would choose a slow, painful death over saying the words for the first time and making it real in this situation if he could. But he can’t. As with every other fucking thing in his fucking stupid life, he doesn’t get to choose. Whatever the half-baked plan did or did not include does not really matter. All that matters is this invisible force that is driving him away from the hell he knows like the back of his hand into this new reality, foreign and unknown.
Thank you for coming along with this fic so far and please let me know what you think. Comments including emoji reactions are highly and truly appreciated.
“And that’s how the length of these tubes increases the efficiency of the Deuterium combustion, so the overall weight of the fuel required decreases significantly.”
Tony’s hands slide down and start to unbuckle Steve’s belt. “You’re just beautiful. Firm and strong and so perfectly muscled and yet it takes a gentle touch to that perfect hair, to make you blush to the back of your neck.” Steve can’t decide what he needs to focus on; Tony’s words, or the way he sucks at the base of Steve’s neck, his fingers rolling over the tip of Steve’s cock or the dishes that he has magically managed to wash and pile up on top of each other and are waiting to be rinsed.
Steve kisses the top of Tony’s head and Tony thinks about the astonishment of sleeping in Steve’s arms. Steve, who is caring and gentle with people he hasn’t even met and hates throwing stuff away. Who can turn a line on a piece of paper, into a fully fleshed international treaty proposal in half a day and is not afraid of using big words like admiration and jealousy. Tony loves being around him. He has a way, a different way, Tony thinks, a bit old fashioned and too serious maybe sometimes, but also adorably sharp and awkwardly funny. He is brave and smart and so heartwarmingly kind, and he reminds Tony of someone but he is too tired now, and he can’t quite remember.
Something feels funny in Tony’s chest. His heart is clenching, or breaking, and the urge to caress the golden hair away from Steve’s beautiful, now-wrinkled forehead is painful in his fingers. Running a hand on the back of Steve’s neck to calm him down had become so natural, it was almost a reflex until half an hour ago, and now closing the two-inch gap between Steve’s hands and his seems suddenly impossible.
He's life itself.
He leaves the plates on any and all empty, flat surfaces he can find, between all the notes and gadgets and things he doesn’t recognize. He pauses behind the bathroom door and his hand hovers on the doorknob. The image of Tony’s naked body sparkling with drops of water burns through his skin and a now-familiar heat swirls low in his body. The desire that’s been buzzing in the back of his mind since last night takes over him all of a sudden and he almost knocks, almost turns that knob, almost walks in.
He tries to think, to come up with a new plan, but his brain cells are busy panicking. He can’t see anything. He can’t really move and his right hand is unlikely to be able to maneuver any buttons and levers right now or anytime soon. He tries to shift a little but his back is apparently spasmed. It’s not even ironic that he can absolutely do nothing at this moment. He just waits. Waits and hopes for the best.
His cock twitches and leaks in anticipation of what’s coming next and something prickles the base of his spine as Tony’s hands smooth the insides of his thighs. Heat builds up under his skin, bit by bit, as Tony’s fingers inch closer to the crease of his ass. The jolt of want that explodes all over his body knocks the breath out of him as Tony’s slicked fingers press gently on his hole.
Tony tilts his head to the side and a vanilla scent Steve’s never smelled before fills the air.
Tony looks up from his StarkPad and his eyes find Steve’s face.
“Nat, go to the gallery and take over the final prep for the show tomorrow because we can’t possibly mess with that and get Clint to come to Brooklyn Family Court ASAP as I might need him there as a witness.”
“I’m gonna strap your feet to the stirrups now. Just as a reminder that you will need to keep your legs apart for me, because we know you’re too strong for them. I don’t want you to get hurt, and I’d prefer if I didn’t choke to death by these.” He laughs and taps on Steve’s left thigh playfully, exactly once, before fastening one of the straps. It’s probably the ring of his laughter, the click of the buckle of the other strap, and the skin-to-skin contact that makes a splash of liquid fire run from Steve’s thigh to his cock and spill like a volcano all over his body, and God, oh God, his hole clenches pathetically around nothing and opens up again.
Tony asks Steve to stay the night, because he did such an amazing job with the dishes, and Steve bursts into laughter before accepting on one condition. The condition makes Tony laugh and blush which Steve has never seen before, and he makes a mental note: blushing is a perfect look on Tony.
“Oh of course you will!”
“Your fella’s home, Stevie, so ’m gonna get going,” Bucky said as he turned on his heels to walk out.
. I’m a huge fan of your designs and I swear by StarkLit 17 magazine system. I’d make all semi-automatics the same if I could. Or I’d make SL17 mandatory on the field."
for providing mask sewing essentials to volunteer households that he emails to Pepper around midday is just flawless and the initial approval of $100k funding from Scholastic to start the ‘Kids at Home’ educational video channel that shows up in Tony’s inbox shortly after is kinda impossible. The way Steve never forgets to include his gratitude for Amy’s help in each and every one of his 18 unbelievably polite but sharp emails, makes Tony’s heart do a happy dance and Tony makes a mental note: Steve does not take shit from anyone, even if they happen to be the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America.
Tony takes a deep breath in and nods, his eyes a little hurt, still. Steve watches him leave and his heart clenches with the pain of failure.
The song referenced in this chapter is
Steve’s doing okay. He’s doing absolutely amazing.
Soooo, surprise??
For a few long seconds, Tony can’t think. He can’t move or speak and seems unable to even breathe. How on earth does this mountain of beautiful softness not belong to someone already? How could one meet Steve and not want to keep his hair and his lips and his beautiful caring heart and the way he opens his body and soul, just like right now, all to himself? How on earth has this become possible, that he has dropped from the sky right behind the counter of that bar, and decided to give all of that to Tony, just randomly? It can’t be random, Tony chants to himself, as he breathes in and out and he can’t quite tell if it’s the astonishing sensation of Steve’s thighs around his cock that blows his mind as soon as he pushes in or the realization that it might not be random, that there might be something special about Tony, at least as far as Steve’s concerned.
“Pay for sex or be paid for sex?”
Together.
He can do this.
“Oh I’ve read the theory in your Engineering Journal article from two years ago. Genius, Commander Stark, it’s genius.”
“I am not afraid of being rejected, Jarvis. I have had my fair share of rejections in life. More than fair. My own father never liked me.”
Steve has never had before, even when he was playing with the plug before all of this happened. He’s never been this open, this stretched, and it’s mind-blowing, the roaring of blood in his ears as his hole squeezes Dr. Stark’s fingers, his breath trapped in his chest, and the way he arches his back, the words that slip out of their own accord, as he covers his mouth with one hand, meaningless and muffled and so very loud.
Tony stares at Steve, eyes narrowed and mouth twisted. He then smiles as he raises an eyebrow, his eyes getting darker in a way Steve has learned to read perfectly, and a swirl of heat starts to coil low in Steve's body. "I think I just happen to know a way to test that.”
Tony shows up at the shop, late on a Saturday night a week later, after another long day of TA.
“Right, Tony?”
“You keep track of my hours?” Tony stands up, and makes an annoyed face, but his tone is mostly playful.
that about Tony. Among many other things, like his whole-faced smile and his scarred chest, his smart mouth and fantastic brain, his selflessness and the never-ending quest for growth even in the times of a pandemic and the way he doesn’t think twice before giving himself away if it helps someone else, piece by piece and bit by bit.
The wind howls and the rain starts battering at the window like it’s a scene out of a horror movie. Or a nightmare, Tony thinks, as if the reality of what’s going on is not surreal enough.
Omegas in Tony’s situation can disappear one day, Tony thinks, like ‘OneMatchExplosion’ from the forum, who never updated his status after that last message, ‘I’m terrified for my safety’. They can also end up in prison with a life sentence, like ‘kissed_by_a_fist’, when her efforts to stop her alpha from hurting her had gone horribly wrong.
Tony chuckles, as he rests his forehead on Steve’s. “Someone who knows about the deal, has the president indebted to this extent
Definitely not.
“Looks like we’ve found Mr. Barnes,” Tony said and handed the telegram to Steve, without taking his eyes off the crashing waves. He didn’t need to turn and look at Steve to know that his bottom lip was trembling from the cold sea breeze, not that he could do anything about it. Steve would not agree to wear Tony’s jacket over his too-large, thin shirt, or head back to the barracks and stay in the residence anyway. The stubborn little thing, Tony thought fondly, half of his weight fire and the other thunder with a burning spirit that would spill out of that beautiful mouth as burning words from between those thin, parched lips that Tony would never get to press to his own.
Steve can’t be awake. This - all of this - has to be a long-winded exhausting dream since going down with Valkyrie in 1945. He must still be asleep somewhere unknown, deep in the Arctic, and waking up in the hospital, the lonely nights and pointless days, and the unbearable constant pain have to be the episodes of one endless nightmare. He can’t quite believe that deciding to walk into that bar and falling into Tony’s arms, the little heaven in the hell that’s been Steve’s life in the past 18 months, are not even real; that everything is part of the same nightmare, Steve can't imagine having to go back to.
He locks himself up in the Captain’s Ready Room for the rest of the day and tries to work out a way to minimize this effect with no luck. Alpha suppressants are not as effective as the ones for omegas - that seem to work perfectly for Tony as he’s not even aware of Steve’s agony - and behavior therapy theories remain theories for now, as they’re found mostly unethical.
Tony looks into Steve’s eyes. “Who knew that Captain America would be into exhibitionism?” And he wiggles his eyebrow, his face lighting up into an easy smile. “Not that I am shaming or objecting sweetheart, your kink is my kink and it’s okay.”
Tony walks the distance between the kitchen entrance and the sink and puts a quick kiss on Steve’s nose. “Well, not the same. I seriously wanted to watch you wash the dishes wearing an apron, but I guess we have to do with what we got,” and he wraps his hands around Steve’s waist and leans in for a long kiss, that is soft and slow but leaves Steve hot all over and panting for air.
“About 10 hours then.” Dr. Stark narrows his eyes. “Did you, by any chance, use sexual enhancing drugs?”
Steve is busy. He’s not hiding away, he’s just too busy to go to Santa Maria rescue celebration. Or the gym. Or team lunches.
Tony takes dare this time.
“You’re avoiding me.”
A quick light angst warning for the first part of the chapter, in case you don't want to read angst at all these days. I hope you give it a try anyway, because it kinda gets better from there :))
Steve takes a deep breath and puts the design sheet on the tattoo trolley. He takes his latex gloves off, one by one, and repeats to himself that punching clients is not a good idea. Not only because he needs this job, but also because he’s a human being, and one must use his words before his fists in all situations.
He slid his hand up from the bitemark and cupped Steve’s cheek. “We’ll ask Mr. Barnes to stay for a little while and you can show him all the gun work you said he would enjoy, down at the fort.”
It feels like being seasick while sailing in his dad’s yacht in the ocean, or that tractor ride in the valley on his seventh birthday. The car is shaking too much, and Tony’s head is swimming frantically, without reaching anywhere to hold on to, to stop, to take a breath.
Dance.
was holding up 18 months after Afghanistan? Wallowing in the misery of being betrayed by someone I thought loved me like a father, unable to hold a meaningful conversation with people closest to me? Do you know how many times I woke up screaming Yinsen’s name, and wished that I had died instead of him? You think you’re a mess? I almost died and I almost did nothing about it. I know how it feels to be eaten up by a secret, with the weight of the world on your shoulders and no one to share it with.”
‘Let you do the dishes’? Really? This must be the most stupid thing he has said asking someone out, (and he has said some very stupid things, which Rhodey is keeping a list of) and he is not even asking Steve out. It’s just a pasta that Tony is planning to make, from his mom’s special recipe he has only ever made for Pepper once on their first anniversary. It’s not a big deal, not at all, and why can’t he just say something else to gloss over the stupid dishes comment? Why, why, why is Steve taking so long to say something?
Would Steve finally lose his patience if Tony uses the cliche of ‘it’s complicated’? That’s the truth and supposedly the noble option but never the wise one, especially when it comes to talking about one’s feelings. “Whatever you want to do, you can give it a go. I’m game, sweetheart, I can do whatever you want me to.” There. Truth is overrated.
"Hey, hey, nothing to be sorry about. I'm glad I heard you." His fingers trail up Steve’s spine, resting on his nape, making Steve’s breath hitch along the way.
(See the end of the chapter for
The alpha glares at Steve and presses his lips together. Steve looks at the omega, who hasn’t made a single noise since he’s entered the room. “So, are
“Right,” Tony says and rubs his chest. “Right,” he repeats as he starts to walk away and turns back a few times as he goes down the stairs, mouthing the word over and over again. Downstairs, Tony stands in the middle of the crowd for a few minutes, as if he doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do, the image being what finally brings some sensation back to Steve’s limbs as the blood flows back up to his head so he can finally start to move slowly at first and then run down the stairs to get to Tony.
Or at least it doesn't look that way, because he’s still in a hospital bed, and in a lot of pain when he wakes up. The room is dim and quiet, except for noises one’s unlikely to hear in the afterlife, beeping of monitors, and soft rhythmic breathing for example that’s coming from someone’s sleeping in a chair next to his bed. It’s Nat, curled under a large jacket with a giant red star on the back that means Bucky’s here too, most probably.
They’re still here, and they might still have a chance of pulling through. Steve’s still holding on to Tony as if he’s the most important thing in the whole world, and even though the storm is still raging outside their window, he is not shaking anymore. There is still hope, even after decades of fear and sorrow, and their life may not turn out like the love songs, but they can try to fix their broken pieces, one nightmare at a time.
“It’s a shame really because now I need to sign off to go check on the unidentified person I’ve apparently been groping in the elevator, and I can’t answer any more questions,” and he taps on his watch and the noises in the room and in Steve’s head die down immediately.
Remember the plan? That was
and their tiny flat, or the fact that he doesn’t ignore the help like every other person Tony has ever dined with, but Tony’s heart does a flip flop in his chest and a warm wave of calm washes over him. He smiles back almost involuntarily and for a moment forgets where he is and what he is doing here.
at 7.
“No, God no, I just have to--” And this is it. This is the second. The perfect time. He can do it. “I need to tell you something too.”
The urge of being close, even closer than this, swirls in his body and sits low in his core, making his cock leak and jerk and suddenly all he wants to do in the world is to feel Steve around him. He leans forward a bit to press his lips to Steve’s ears and he hopes that Steve can hear and understand his breathless question. “May I?”
Tony takes a deep breath. Why on earth can’t he take pain killers? The idea of having a mystery job that requires being beaten up all the time and not being able to take pain killers doesn’t sit well together, and Tony does not like the picture one bit. He sighs again and kisses Steve’s hair. “I am sorry, sweetheart, I am so sorry. It must be awful to be the toughest guy in the room when no one can seem to understand how hard it is to hold it together.” Tony runs his fingers on Steve’s back, drawing soothing circles, as he plans a chat with Bruce and emailing Dr. Cho in hopes of finding something that might help Steve, at least a little bit.
Steve’s breath hitches, and he shivers, fully aware that his cock is leaking into Dr. Stark’s hand. He tries to reply, he really does, but his brain is not capable of forming words, proper ones at least, because there are some highly inappropriate things at the back of his mind, ready to be voiced. He just shakes his head instead, and hisses with strained breath when Dr. Stark presses on the base of his cock.
Steve’s heart starts to beat fast and the anger starts to flame up from somewhere in his chest. “No. But I’m gonna call the police. What you’re doing here fits the criteria for endangering an omega, and I’m obligated to report it.”
” Steve asks, with wide eyes, as he takes a step back, and drags a hand out of Tony’s.
“You’re serious?”
This chapter took a bit longer than I expected for some reason, I hope it is worth the wait :)
This is not the end. A cold liquid feeling flows inside his veins and the drops push the darkness away inch by inch. Voices sharpen, scents detangle and light creeps through the darkness. Tony breathes and blinks and the first thing he sees is a blurry image of a red-haired omega who looks back at him and smiles with her whole face.
and for the love of God… winks at Tony.
burns in his throat and makes his toes go cold, but he manages to bite his bottom lip as Tony leans forward to place the lightest of the kisses on his lips.
, in case you wanted to reblog it!
There are beers on the coffee table in front of the TV, and a giant pizza box that Tony puts on Steve’s lap as soon as he sits down. Bollo is allegedly the best pizza in all of Texas, and Tony would have gotten more if he was not worried about already being on Steve’s bad side today, not willing to make it any worse by overspending. Steve pretends to not feel the slight sting of the words but his hands go cold for a second when he is opening the pizza box.
Steve tightens his grip around Tony’s fingers slightly and takes a deep, deep breath. He then brushes the back of Tony’s hand gently, before he turns to the unwelcome, loud jerk, who is, as expected, Ty fucking Stone.
He is grateful for not collapsing as he goes through the hallway and walks up the stairs. He also smiles at the image of comedic horror in Captain Rogers’ eyes as Tony marches out of the room.
He kisses Steve’s hair and pulls the covers over them as joy bubbles up within his chest and spills over his skin like tiny sparks. It’s
So Tony does as Steve says, as he promised. It’s just a touch, a brush, same as when he caresses Steve’s cheek or the back of his neck, but it’s there, Tony’s finger is there, moving and pushing gently but consistently and the circular pointed motion is lightning and thunder turning Steve’s whole body into one exposed nerve.
He is not your omega, Tony repeated to himself, grasping a fistful of bed linen and digging his heels into the mattress. No matter what that piece of paper they got from the Department of Omegas’ Affairs said; no matter how conspicuous the bite mark still was. Steve Rogers was not Tony’s omega, because it was not what he wanted to be.
“Uncomfortable?”
Steve blinks again before the flash of lightning illuminates his features, and the way he trembles with the thunder tightens Tony’s chest. Or his words, the pieces of a dark puzzle slotting into place, the understanding that’s starting to settle in, yet bringing along more confusion.
Tony walks around as they watch the video of the first time Iron Man’s caught on camera, flying over Afghanistan. He paces the room during the Netflix documentary and he yells at the screen right after Steve, as soon as the narrator mixes up Mark VI and Mark VII. Tony explains the Mark VII firepower improvements with a mind-blowing amount of details and sketches the new thrusters at Steve’s request to the best of his knowledge. He smiles the whole time, watching on his feet, as Iron Man rescues the passengers of the Staten Island Ferry, and cheers and claps for the last few passengers, excited to see the ‘ending show’ from this particular angle.
Tony nibbles at Steve’s neck, and kisses his Adam’s apple. “Oh Batman is awesome, don’t get me wrong,” he says, suddenly tired with the roller coaster ride that’s been the last day of week one of self-isolation, “but he is nowhere and let me repeat this, nowhere as brave, and kind, and smart, and amazing as my guy.” And he yawns against Steve’s shoulder.
It might be the way Steve puts these things together, with repetitive questions that quiz the same concept from different angles. Or the fact that he doesn’t seem disappointed, ever, even when Tony blurts out ‘no way’ at the mention of pain play, or that he doesn’t mock Tony, at all, even if his breath hitches when a magnificent thin leather collar, that can easily pass as a fashionable choker, shows up on the screen.
“I know that it’s something you’re into… so... I really want to give it a go. See if I can make you feel… make you…” And he trails off ducking his head, making Tony’s heart flutter a little.
“Wait until I step on all your toes,” Steve tries casually, as he follows Tony’s gentle tug, and Tony laughs with his whole face, the candlelight sparkling in his eyes.
“I am hoping to be spared by the hideousness of whatever you are about to say.”
Jarvis was not Tony’s dad, though, and Nat, this room, this whole fantasy island where he’s magically landed, does not belong to him. Captain Rogers, as charitable and decent as he might be, is not Tony’s friend; he’s an alpha, who has no fucking reason to be in Tony’s corner.
Tony snaps out of the baby scent haze, when Ty squeezes his arm with one hand and his fingers with the other. He looks at Ty, who is not looking at him, and then looks at their guest. Captain Rogers is in fact looking at Tony, at least for a few short seconds, and Tony might be making this up but his eyes are a little worried. Tony can’t quite figure out why, and it doesn’t really matter anyway, because Captain Rogers is now looking at Ty again, continuing his infomercial about his charity,
(I'm planning an epilogue too but that might take a little bit longer.)
Steve is blushing, so adorably, and Tony can pretty much guess what he’s been reading about.
He almost goes crazy waiting. Part of him wants the wait to never end, not looking forward to what will be next. The other part wants to get this over with. To peel the bandage off and deal with the bleeding and move on. He doesn’t know how long he circles in his mind going back and forth about how stupid he is to even be here. A second maybe, or five  hours, but he finally hears some noise. There is an intense movement followed by violent pain all over his body, and for a second, he wishes he could simply disappear from the face of the earth, right in this moment, so he wouldn't have to go through with the rest of it. Then there is fresh air and a blinding light that moves a bit before it freezes on Tony’s face so Tony brings up his left hand that he can still move to shield his eyes.
to find Tony.
Tony swallows another half-egg and shoves some tomato on top. He knows for a fact that no such act existed in any state when he still had access to free internet, and other than the rare common practices in Vermont and Massachusetts, no courts had processes in place to grant temporary relief of bond duties for omegas urgently. Will he get sick if he takes one sip of the hot chocolate? The idea of warm milk makes his insides twist, but it’s not an easy decision to pick between disappointing an alpha who’s gone into trouble of making hot chocolate in a pot just for Tony - the grownups are having coffee, of course - or keep what’s in his stomach right where it is. He stares at Captain Rogers’s long fingers unwrapping another granola bar and dipping it into his coffee mug, and does his absolute best not to come up with too many vivid images of the events that must have happened to Nebula over the past year, so fucking horrifying to have made alpha-dominated bodies of legislators even consider passing a bill named after an omega. Photos of graphic injuries perhaps, he thinks anyway, or recordings of a terrified voice in multiple 911 calls, her friends’ testimonies - if she had any friends left - or stories by her devastated family believing her finally when it was too late to do anything at all. Captain Rogers’s Adam’s apple bobs up and down and Tony wraps his fingers around his mug. He can’t think about this anymore - he just can’t go lower in this hole - so he might as well drink some hot chocolate for the first time in ten years, and focus on keeping it down instead of heart wrenching speculations about this other omega’s pain and despair.
Tony’s voice is low and his words are gentle. His fingers are drawing little circles on Steve’s chest, leaving fuzzy trails on his skin. Warmth spreads from the tip of his fingers through Steve's chest and all over his body and a thrill starts low in his belly and fires up his spine.
Thank you so much to Bae and Seri for betaing this one, guys I love you so much <3
What would happen if he asked for the car to be stopped? To take a walk to breathe fresh air, assuming he can stand on his feet? Would Captain Rogers be one of those alphas who get antsy when someone touches the window handle?
Steve’s still smiling while Tony turns around to leave. It takes him a moment longer, his usual 'in Tony’s presence fogginess' slowly dissipating, before he catches up. Did Tony say that
“I just don’t know how to dance.”
Nat rolls her eyes and sits next to him. “Bullshit. Omegas should be treated as equals.”
Tony takes another deep breath and rubs his chest. It’s getting harder to breathe and the few tears on Steve’s cheeks, that Tony is dying to wipe away, are not helping at all. Steve stuck in a plane that’s sinking into a frozen ocean is too terrible to think about even once, and yet, the image is replaying in Tony’s mind, over and over and over again.
“I’ll … um...check up on the food. Kitchen. Dinner ... need to check on it. Excuse me.” He looks at Captain Rogers and then at Ty. Ty nods, still not looking at him, so Tony turns to the door and walks out of the room.
Then, the light gets closer, this time not right into his eyes, and Tony can finally see the distinctive figure of the person holding the flashlight. Captain Rogers is still covering his mouth and the horror in his eyes is not comedic anymore.
Tony shakes his head. Again. And then one more time. He feels like he is losing consciousness as things seem to get away from him, like he is soaring up or being pushed back. His brain reprocesses the words he has just heard but there is no other possible meaning to them. Something blocks his airway and his mouth suddenly feels like a desert. He can vauguly feel Ty’s hold tightening around his arm, yet instead of the usual shiver a fire line runs through his chest and burns his heart.
Steve kisses Tony’s lips back, sending a prickle down Tony’s spine. “A secret admirer then?”
No one is counting so they can’t tell if it’s been five minutes or not, and Steve doesn’t seem to mind Tony’s weight the slightest bit, so they stay like that for many many minutes, with Steve’s hands digging into Tony’s sides, his body holding Tony against the wall, weightless and breezy; the way things need to be all the time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve walks around the desk and stands in front of Tony. “It wasn’t bad. And I’m not embarrassed. All I can think about, all the time, is how wonderful and amazing it was to share that with you. I just can’t stop thinking about it. I just didn't want to make
Tony kisses Steve’s neck, before his hands slide back up to cup Steve’s face and he pulls back to look into Steve’s eyes. “It is an honor to dance with you, and I’m thrilled that you’re considering coming home with me.” Tony gently tugs Steve’s face closer. “It is an honor to know what’s making you hurt, to hear about your nightmares, to be the person you let in.” He brushes his lips against Steve’s, just barely but the electric touch burns Steve’s lips anyway. “I don’t want you to beat yourself up for last night. I want you to be proud.” He traces his lips from Steve’s nose up to his forehead and his fingers dig into the muscles of Steve’s back. “You think you can do that for me?”
Tony is on the phone on the other side of the room by the window, naked, and Steve lets out a breath he has been holding as he is not the only naked person in the room. He doesn’t get a chance to worry about anything else though; his phone starts ringing in the pocket of his jeans. And thank god, because Tony grabs them from the couch, walks over and drops them on Steve’s lap so he doesn’t have to do the naked walk of shame across the room. Tony smiles at Steve and bends down to leave a quick kiss on Steve’s hair absentmindedly before turning back to the window and butterflies flutter in Steve’s stomach again. He takes his phone out, which has now stopped ringing, and wonders what has gone wrong, because he has 22 missed calls, 14 messages, and five voice mails.
“No. It’s okay.” Steve practically slaps Tony’s hand away. He is not upset, Tony is sure, if the way he looks at Tony, all soft and awed as if Tony has moved some sort of mountain, is anything to go by. Or, how tight his hand is still wrapped around Tony’s waist, holding him close, and not letting go.
He’s suddenly very tired.
on the bed next to Bucky, pressing him to the wall with his side. Bucky was struggling to push Steve back and Steve was not moving, and they were so worked up pushing and laughing that it took them a minute to notice Tony at all.
It’s not him.
It was just the two of them tangled to each other, in a mess of kisses, and touches, and tears, and for once Steve was exactly where he wanted to be - in Tony’s arms and maybe, just maybe, he would be able to stay here, forever.
He gives up, and lets go; because he doesn’t have to hold back, he doesn’t have to keep it together, he doesn't have to pretend.
We are discussing COVID-19 pandemic, as usual, without mentioning the name, so if you don't want to be exposed to that topic, please take care of yourself and don't read this one.
This must be a dream.
Tony doesn’t
Tony stays awake, long after Steve’s breathing evens out, and he goes over the events of the night over and over again. Nothing had gone as planned - not that Tony had planned any of what happened after the second dance - and yet, he still has Steve in his arms, feeling his warmth, listening to his soft breaths. He’s beat, tired, and wrung out, but he’s finally through the mill, and against all odds, has come out of it in one piece.
He rubs the shampoo onto Steve's hair, the one that smells like lavender because Steve smells like that one all the time. He is shy and careful at first, worried that he might make Steve uncomfortable, but Steve doesn’t seem to mind, because he smiles and tilts his head a little to give Tony better access. Tony presses his forehead to Steve’s, now that he can reach it, and giggles between the small kisses he plants on Steve’s nose when the shampoo runs into his eyes as he rinses Steve’s hair.
bullies. I can do this all day.”
Steve laughed softly and laid his head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony nodded to Barnes, relieved that he did not feel the urge to punch his face anymore, and smiled at Jarvis’s face glowing with his ‘I told you so’ expression that was well familiar.
“He owns a house in the eastern suburbs. I’ll be Bucky’s burden for a while,” Steve said and his voice was too sad for Tony’s liking.
Tony loosened his tie and stepped out of the elevator.
He feels exhausted as if he'd run for miles in extreme heat. He feels hollow, pointless - he could really use some sleep.
“It is what's happening to you, Tony,” Steve says as gently as his shaking voice allows. “You might be the first omega I’ve seen in my life, but I can feel it. I know it like I know you’re sitting here with me.”
“I’m honored that you feel that way, Steve. I truly am. I’m just hoping-- just let me show my absolute gratitude for how crazy hot it was for me, too.”
Steve looks around the room and swallows. “This is not about training or capability…” He ducks his head and shuffles on his feet, wishing so bad for his rational, civilized brain to take over at a very near point in the future.
Mornings are spent on bringing some order back to the city: clearing the abandoned cars from the roads, organizing volunteers for hospitals, planning for security measures, and dealing with unaccompanied children wandering around in every unexpected corner. In the afternoons, Steve just walks in the streets. He goes from one street to another and listens to people. Some cry on his shoulders. Some yell. Some even throw a punch at him, which he takes without a blink. He needs to be there for the people he has let down so fucking spectacularly— not that he can undo any of the harm, not that it makes him feel better the slightest bit, but he’s at least doing what needs to be done; he is at least doing something.
“Tony?” The alpha -Ty - squeezes the omega’s shoulder. “Come on, babe, gonna make some noise here, like the chatty little bitch that you are?”
There are lists to check through and surveys to fill. There are face-to-face sessions at pre-set times which are different from all the other times that they do ‘unofficial’ chats, and Steve even makes Tony write a 2000 words essay about non-sexual submission. It’s weird and gets more and more absurd every time a notification blinks on Tony’s phone, every time JARVIS lets Tony know that Captain Rogers needs to speak to him urgently about something super specific that Tony has to do his best to elaborate on ‘as honestly as he possibly can’.
,” said someone else, before they laughed, buzzing and loud and Tony’s heart dropped to his feet like a stone.
Steve repeats to himself as if there is anyone else around for thousands of lightyears, and
Right now, though, Tony is floating in a pain-induced haze. He has no mental capacity to worry about the fact that it’s been way more than 40 minutes since the phone call, that CaptainRogers has asked the girl on the other end and a few others to meet him at
In theory.
, but stops talking as he covers his face, as soon as Tony’s lips touch his toes.
Tony cries, sobs, as Steve’s mouth moves up and down his cock, soft and tight, and Tony is not sure if he orders or begs but Steve doesn’t hesitate to touch himself, as soon as the words are spoken. They come together, at the exact same second, and it’s not bizarre even the slightest bit. It’s just magic; unearthly, not explainable, pure, like every other thing that happened in the past 10 days, that led them here, right to this moment.
“Look, Mr. Stone;
, in case you wanted to reblog it!
“Good,” Tony whispers against Steve’s forehead, before he eases his hold and pulls back. He takes another sip of his coffee and considers Steve, eyes shining with a familiar spark that stirs something low in Steve’s gut. “Now, put this mug away because I see no reason to endure this painful wait any longer.”
“Unfortunately,” he says slowly, “I can’t do this tattoo tonight. He’s not lucid enough to consent to a glass of water, let alone get something inked on his body that might make him wear turtlenecks for the rest of his life.”
Being cheeky is a good look on Tony and Steve makes a mental note; Tony can turn anything into a charity opportunity.
strong then,” Dr. Stark says, his voice a little too hoarse maybe, something sounding off that Steve can’t quite put a finger on.
If Tony was still 18, his heart would melt into a stinky puddle of pink goo with the way Captain Rogers's gaze is so impossibly soft. If he was the same glorious romantic who used to listen to love songs while sketching StarkPhone I design drafts, he would believe, in a heartbeat, that this stranger guy with that hair and that honey coated voice is telling the truth. He would lay his head on the alpha’s knees, and cry until he would fall asleep. If he was still that Tony, he would bask in the protectiveness that’s making the air in the car too thick to easily breathe in.
Steve’s hand darts forward on its own accord as his body goes hot on the surface and starts to shiver inside.
Steve wants to look away, but he doesn’t seem to be able to. Dr. Stark’s eyes are a unique color, a golden brown, like chocolate, or dark honey maybe, and Steve doesn’t expect it, the way they’re holding him in place, warming him up and calming him down.
He can’t do this.
Steve looks pale, more than he usually does and he sounds too hesitant, too worried, as his voice breaks a little with every word.
He moves his fingers in and out a few more times, as he watches Steve, waiting for his confirmation before he pulls them out quickly but gently. It’s just surreal that Steve misses his fingers almost instantly, as if they’re a part of Steve now, how he can
This alpha is not old. He is not small and he is definitely not bald. He actually has a very nice head of hair, blond and, well, beautiful.
It’s just impossible for it to be real, the way Steve melts under Tony’s touch, trembling with the brush of Tony’s lips, or the way the blush spreads from the tip of his nose to the back of his neck, as soon as Tony pulls the t-shirt over Steve’s head, and the back of his hand brushes over Steve’s nipples along the way. The way he just goes with Tony’s gentle nudge, the blush spreading down on his chest, smiling at Tony soft and pliant as Tony strips out of his clothes. How he holds his hands out and pulls Tony under the stream of the warm water that’s washing all the black stains from Steve’s body.
“It’s silicone. I did research. It wasn’t supposed to be breakable.” Steve says, finally looking down, and his voice is small, so small he almost hates himself for it.
“There was this practice in place, though.” He fiddles with the gear stick, and turns the volume down and up again. “The Hierarchy of Alphas Rule, to allow an alpha claim an omega based on the fact that a living present alpha takes precedence over one who’s been away for a long time. A rule from the 1860s, and yeah, maybe it was a political push to take these omegas off the government's hands but it became pretty common at the time. The only thing that the authorities would enforce was for the bond to be temporary, so they could hand the omega back in case their preceding mate showed up. You know, to prevent alphas from breaking each other's necks, not that it worked every time.”
“Handcuff or blindfold?” Tony asks and the image of Steve handcuffed to Tony’s bed - his actual bedroom in the penthouse of Stark Tower - makes his hands go numb. It will be glamorous, if Steve ever gives Tony the honor, the third most beautiful thing in the world probably, right after his smile and his adorable, perfect blush.
Tony is gentle and relentless and Steve can’t quite figure out how those two things can be true at the same time. He is smaller than Steve, height and build and all, but Steve feels absolutely powerless in his hands. He allows Tony to drag him along to the bedroom of what seems to be a luxurious penthouse and goes easily as Tony pushes him onto the enormous white bed, gentle but firm.
Steve smiles back. “I just want people to know that you can hold Captain America down, and touch him, whenever and wherever you want.”
in public, even if the alley is empty and dark, and the images reel in Steve’s mind, and knock the breath out of his lungs. Iron Man pins Captain America to the ground, holding his wrists with one gauntlet, and Steve is trembling already as Iron Man asks if the Captain does not mind him removing the groin plate because
“Um… coffee?”
“I don’t have clearance to disclose my own identity, so for what they know you have no idea who I am,” he sighs too, and wonders how messy his own hair is, as he combs his fingers through them. “What if I haven’t told you already?”
"I'm sorry."
Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed it.
The beautiful lines of his body, the muscle tone in his abs, his mighty fingers that can set Steve on fire and calm him at the same time. Those laugh lines, so ridiculously adorable, and his chest, the scars Steve has loved from the beginning without even knowing why, the hollow where his face fits perfectly.
once again, too deep that his usual ‘mental replay and remember function’ is not working either. He tries to guess what the question might have been, and watches Captain Rogers's back muscles flex through the ridiculously tight t-shirt - which means the alpha is a hundred sizes larger than him - as he turns to look over his shoulder. He doesn’t look angry, Tony thinks, his heart starting to race already, but he didn’t look angry last night when he shattered a tall glass with his bare hands either. It’s not like Tony has ever been a good judge when it comes to an alpha’s instant mood change, as much as he has tried over the years, and he can’t fool himself to think that the alphas are too concerned with his genuine answer to what seems to be a rhetorical question anyway.
Tony turned over to lie on his stomach and pressed his aching body into the mattress, hopeful that the pillow would silence his sobs and swallow his tears. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to think about the only time he'd had Steve close. Not enough, but almost, dizzy with the sweetest scent in the world, Steve’s hair caressing the side of his face, the soft pale skin coloring under Tony’s lips. How Tony had completely lost himself, quite shamelessly despite the circumstances, and forgotten about the presence of the immigration officer in the room, or Mr. Murdock for that matter; how all that existed in the world was Steve and the soft low moan that took Tony’s breath away and made him sink his teeth in the delicate flesh of Steve’s neck so intensely that the mark had not faded the slightest bit after 143 days.
“Hey, hey, hey, breathe,” Steve says, too commanding maybe, but there is only so much of the growling dragon inside that he can keep from bursting out. “I’m not leaving, and you’re not a loser. You kicked him out, and I’d be honored to help you clean up the mess, as much as I can.”
? Why has Steve decided to trust Tony in the first place? He can’t play the ‘being drunk’ card, at least with himself.
He is not depressed and he has not lost his will to live. There is this gigantic piece of rock he’s carrying around, while ironically feeling hollow all the time, but otherwise, he is fine.
It takes forever to get to Brooklyn; or at least much longer than Tony has expected. The back seat is way more comfortable than the trunk, and that’s a comparison no one should ever make, but Tony is still in as much pain and even more.
“Tony, honey, this is not the place. We will talk about this later, alright baby? I did what I had to do. You know that’s always for the best, sweetheart.”
Tony chuckles. “Hmmm, Jude Law? Tom Hiddleston. No, no, wait. I got it. Chris Evans.”
on Tumblr, come talk to me :)
Steve then swallows him down in one smooth move, and Tony’s hands shoot forward to run through Steve’s hair, too rough perhaps, but it’s not like Tony has any command.
Time freezes and the world stops turning when Tony’s lips touch Steve’s cock. He is melting. He might actually have evaporated somehow and the only part of him that's still there is the point of contact between his body and Tony’s. He can’t see. He can’t breathe. He can’t think. All that there is, is Tony and his lips moving on Steve, up and down in an insanely slow rhythm. It’s soft and gentle, like his kisses and his touch, and it’s firm and tight, as he has held Steve over the past two days.
Going through the empty rooms of Building 3 after that, he went to his old room and sat on the edge of the bed. It had been a while since a ship with third-class passengers had arrived at the port so the building had been empty. Part of him was grateful beyond measure that he wasn't still stuck in these rooms, like during the long months after the end of his 40-day quarantine, before he met Tony behind Building 1. The other part, however, couldn’t help but wonder if it would’ve been easier to stay here, waiting for his eventual deportation followed by catching the flu on the return voyage. Would it have been less torturous to make it to Ireland only to end up with no food and money in the middle of a civil war and no family or friend to help him out? Would counting the days until his probable death make his heart clench this painfully or make breathing this damn hard?
Tony flinches visibly but doesn’t move an inch.
Steve chews the inside of this cheek and cracks his knuckles. “It’s too dangerous, I can’t possibly allow you to jeopardize yourself like that.”
Steve kisses the tip of Tony’s cock. He then licks the length on one side, and slides down Tony’s balls, making Tony float in a sudden nothingness, before he goes around the balls and back up, licking the other side of Tony’s length till he gets back to the tip.
All of this is another spectacular failure.
Tony hisses under the slight pressure of water and closes his eyes to let the sudden wave of nausea settle as blood from who knows where taints the water running under his feet. There is no modesty, no shame, not even a shred of dignity. There is push and pull of pain instead, and tears that are getting washed down the drain so they can both pretend they don’t exist.
No, it is the opposite of hurt, Steve thinks as he shakes his head and watches Dr. Stark focus back on pressing his fingers into Steve’s stomach. It’s pleasant, despite all odds, to have this nice smelling person so close, touching Steve’s body, caring and gentle, even if the context is all wrong. Steve can’t help but breathe it in, because no one should smell this good, and that wavy dark hair would probably feel soft if Steve ran his hands through it.
Dr. Stark looks at Steve, finally, and there, his smile is even more beautiful than before. “Hey, sleeping beauty. How are we feeling?”
Tony takes off an item of clothing at
Tony is lying on his back, sending the last of the endless emails, trying to approve everything for the gathering of funds tomorrow. He has almost lost his voice, with surprise squeakings on the phone, one call after the other, after the other. It’s amazing that no one has a clue who convinced the president and funnily enough everyone thinks it’s one of Tony’s magic tricks that has finally worked out. Rhodey has a few people in mind but none of them could have possibly known about any of this, and Pepper has no idea but keeps screaming many nice things about their unidentified superhero.
“I love you,” Tony chants as he speeds up and his thrusts get more forceful.
“I call it a win. Your idea worked miracles. Well done.”
“Are you listening to a word I’m saying?” Steve breathes out miserably, “there’s no way that you would still want me if you were.”
“Steve,” Tony says, surprised that he still has a voice, and he tries to go on, wishing to be as verbose as he usually is, to chatter away and make Steve smile, but that Tony seems so far away and so does that Steve; so does their little bubble of joy that’s been surrounding this quarantine room for the past days.
Steve nods and holds onto the handle. “Engage!”
Steve’s mind goes blank for a second. He wonders if pretty has other meanings too, as the idea of Tony hiding a photo of
He sits on the edge of the chair by the dressing table and holds his head in his palms. He has 6 minutes exactly to come up with a plan on how to lay things out without freaking Tony out. He can alternatively keep his head in his hands and pray hard for a miracle to spare him from having to say the dreadful words out loud, at least for tonight.
Tony leans back and lays his chin on his palms. “Santa Maria passengers are safe and sound, they will be at the space station in no time.”
Tony takes a bite of the bread and stabs one of the boiled eggs with his fork. Words can look plain white with a shade of gray, but pull them apart and you will find a dull yellow crumbly ball inside.
Simple; just like that.
He looks at his hand and brings it down slower than he’s expected as if he’s in a movie that’s gone suddenly in slow motion mode. “I can’t stand back when you look distressed like that, Tony, I—”
Steve knew that he had wanted this, from the first day, but never in his wildest dreams had he imagined that having Tony’s lips on his would feel like this. Tony’s body was warm and solid against his, so close that his scent was making Steve’s head spin. And the kiss was nothing like the quick gentle pecks Steve had seen in the cinema. It was a tingle turning into swirling waves, a rush of heat that ran over his chest and pooled low in his gut, so passionate, so safe, so breathtakingly real, that it soon melted all of his fears away.
“You’re here? God, I panicked for a second, I thought--” and he cuts himself off, rubs his face and his hands start to fiddle with his t-shirt, straightening wrinkles that seem to be invisible.
what Steve’s doing to him, without saying a word. He tightens his hold on the edge of the desk and does his best to stay still as if he is holding something fragile in his hand that could break with the tiniest of trembles or be disrupted by the lowest whispers.
Steve is still thinking about nibbling at Tony’s throat when he feels the blood start to leave his head. He freezes up for a second and his breath seems to get quick and short. He can’t see the press, as they can’t see him standing behind the camera and the screen that came in one of Tony’s boxes, either, but he can imagine the guy’s pathetic face, sweating in his oversized suit. Steve is now fully accustomed to the video-conferencing technology, but his body still wants to punch the guy through the screen. He clenches his fists and takes a deep breath, thankful that he has put his water glass down on the coffee table, so he doesn’t have to clean up a sea of shattered and bloody glass pieces after.
Steve shifts a little, easing into Tony’s hold, and Tony feels that breathing becomes a bit easier from then on. “I’m damaged goods, Tony,” he whispers into Tony’s neck, and his breath tingles a line across Tony’s shoulder, “and you--”
he adds to himself, casually.
He has a couple of fractured ribs so he will be in pain with every single breath for a while, which is nothing new. It has been so long since Tony’s chest has not hurt with every fucking breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah, she is lovely. Sorta. If you go past the stone-cold exterior and the fact that she will cut your dick off if she catches you in the wrong. That’s actually a good thing though, so yeah she is my lifesaver. I would have been dead or bankrupt or both if it wasn’t for her.” Tony says with a fond smile, and he reaches for the coffee pot which Steve grabs first and pours Tony another cup.
“It’s okay. We’ve got this. If you lie down on the table for me, I’ll take care of everything.” Dr. Stark bends forward to tap on the table and his scrubs brush against Steve’s gown, close, so close that if Steve moves an inch forward, he can rub his nipples against Dr. Stark’s arm. He doesn’t move an inch forward though; he just holds still, trembling inside, and he inhales, wondering how inappropriate it will be to ask if he can smell Dr. Stark’s hair right now.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, I will do my best to post the next chapter mid Jan ( and it's not because I am taking a break, because I will be writing a holiday fic based on the movie
Steve’s coming apart. He’s gasping for air, unable to get enough, and the intensity of the moment is breaking him in two. It doesn't hurt, not in the very least, it just feels like Tony’s opening his body and reaching into his soul, with each thrust, each bolt of electricity that curls Steve’s toes and sweeps through his core, all the way up to prickle his scalp. He’s present with every nerve in his body, each somehow taking in the feelings thousands of times more than they rightfully should and there is absolutely no room left for anything else in the world, the concepts that are supposed to hurt, the memories, the nightmares, the regrets.
He bends.
Tony rubs Steve’s back, as gently as he can with shaking hands. Steve can’t get drunk. He can’t even take painkillers, and he’s been in so much pain that he’s had to cling to a fantasy to be able to sleep for a few hours. He’s been alone, and lonely for fuck’s sake, in some shabby government-managed shithole that Tony can’t wait to find the authority in charge of.
He is sitting on the kitchen counter and Steve reasons with his heart to slow down, now that he can see Tony and he doesn't seem to be hurt. “It’s okay, and please don’t say that,” he says in the most comforting voice he can muster, with the way his heart is still shaking in his chest when he finally gets to Tony’s side.“It’s okay, it’s fine, we’ll fix this.”
I left Melbourne— I’m sorry. I wrote home with my new address as soon as I got my own place in Sydney, but it was obviously too late.” Bucky wrapped an arm around Steve’s shoulders and Steve laid his head on Bucky’s chest. He smelled like home, like the slow comfortable afternoons of their childhood. He smelled like a time when life was simpler and no one died from the flu, the days that civil wars were not leaving houses in ruins, and no one had to flee their hometowns to put food on the table and find a shelter from the rain.
He reads every word and studies every picture front to back and back to front and it’s starting to get dark outside when he finally looks up, with a stiff neck from the many hours of looking down. Tony is yelling at someone on the phone, this time in disbelief that there seems to be a toilet paper shortage in every supermarket across the US, and he is eating something, as Steve can hear him chew and swallow between broken screams. Steve stares at Tony through the bedroom door, trying to process the concept of toilet paper shortages but all he can think about is the perfect combination of red and gold metal with a shining blue light. The fact that Tony is going to investigate the production lines that could be repurposed to help essential item shortages is not graspable right now. Or the way his own stomach is rumbling, as he has not eaten since lunch.
He keeps his forehead on Steve’s a little longer, as they kiss and whimper in each other's arms and Tony could swear that this must be what heaven feels like, figuratively, the way Steve parts his lips and Tony’s tongue gets to taste his mouth. Steve rubs his hands up and down Tony’s back then, and it feels like fireworks along Tony’s skin. Tony might need to change his last statement after all, because this, this must be what heaven feels like, literally and figuratively.
“I’m happy to stay, Mr. Stark,” Barnes said, and coughed again demonstratively, “if you take on the responsibility of unloading your omega’s belongings from the carriage and back into the house.”
brushes his lips over Steve’s chest and bites his left nipple. They kiss with Steve’s t-shirt stuck above his head and Tony can’t help but press their naked skin together when Steve’s finally shirtless too.
into the room, beating so fast that it feels like a minor earthquake inside his ribs.
The loud thud of the door slamming open startles them both and Nat jumps to her feet, still clutching Tony’s hand, holding it awkwardly in the air. Tony’s heart drops to his feet, as Captain Rogers
Steve’s eyes pop out for a second before he shakes his head with a bit of fake judgment. “Let’s go with the new for now?”
Tony nods and caresses the back of Steve’s palm that’s trembling in Tony’s hands. “I love your brain and all of your toy— gadgets, and robots. I love it all, even when you spit things in my face that makes my ears burn from rage… I just love you so so much.”
This is definitely not Brooklyn.
He remembers waking up in the middle of the night after one of those nightmares his subconscious can craft perfectly to maximum hurt level. The shady images that run through his brain, the absolute terror of waking up in the dark, confused and lost, the ache of seeing Bucky’s face in the white background, screaming and getting away from him.
“Can I help?”
The thing about wearing a mask more often than not is that you get used to it. You get used to hiding your face, your expressions, your identity. You become less important each day and the mask, as much as you get used to hiding behind it, does not become more important, even a single little bit. You get used to not having a choice, not being yourself, not being the mask. The thing is, you get used to hiding, altogether.
Tony kisses Steve’s neck and nibbles on the perfect patch of pale skin under his ear. He tastes like honey for some reason, and it’s just not fair, because no one is supposed to taste this good even right after a shower. Steve’s humming turns into low moans, as Tony moves to lick his throat, and he closes his eyes and bites his bottom lip.
my engineering degree.” He looks up at Steve, and Steve’s heart misses a beat like always. “I’ve done tons of away missions and I have a medal of honor for Planet-X. What could possibly make you think I’m not capable of joining you on this mission?”
He loves Tony.
He does see heaven, just after that, or whatever it's called; the bliss, the deafening silence, the coming together of his senses and his body in one point, before it all goes running, exploding into a million tiny pieces.
Tony runs his palm up Steve’s chest, massaging the line between his pecs. “Oh yes you were,” he whispers, and watches Steve close his eyes, as Tony’s fingers caress their way up Steve’ neck and brush over his lips. “See. Just like now.” And he has to close his own eyes and take a deep breath too, with the way Steve’s blush darkens and spreads to his navel.
“Please, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think anyone should spend this much money on luxurious items. There are people out there right now in this same situation as us who probably can’t afford any sort of accommodation. Or food for that matter.”
Steve has never felt this way before.
Tony looks at Steve with wide eyes and bursts into laughter. “And you saved my neck, literally, despite everything,” he finally says, the ring of laughter carrying on to his voice. “You didn’t have to care. You definitely did not have to drag me to your place, even if it’s only three floors above the tattoo shop.”
Steve waits three whole days before he calls Tony. Two days, twenty hours and four minutes to be precise, and he almost pulls off being cool and casual and having called to just
He can’t go to sleep. He checks his emails on his laptop that arrived earlier that afternoon, right before the press conference. He replies to a couple, but he can’t focus, and even finding the box of Zaro's black and white cookies with Nat and Clint's silly note doesn’t make him feel any better. He is jittery and unsettled. He feels horrible.
For a few long seconds, nothing moves. Tony wonders if he has imagined the words coming out of his mouth because no one blinks and no one breathes.Then in the blink of an eye, scents around him shift and a hypothetical storm starts pounding at the door. Nat reaches for his hand, holds it in both of hers and whispers something that Tony can’t hear. Something is being shattered on the other side of the bed, so Tony turns back to his right and for a second his brain cannot find the relation between the image, the sound and the concept. Then the storm slams the door open, his blood starts to freeze and his brain can finally process what’s happening right in front of him.
He should at least try.
“I would’ve died on the ship if they deported me.”
It would've been easier if Tony was a horrible person. Or just average for that matter with some characteristics that Steve could come to hate. It would have really helped if he wasn’t just amazing.
That’s all that matters, really, and who cares if Captain Rogers walks a couple of steps backwards, sits back on the edge of the bed and continues to watch Tony with that very same shiny smile.
He is ready, more than he ever knew he could be; he wants this with every cell in his body and every bit of his soul. He’s been waiting for the right moment and the right one, his whole unexpectedly long life, even if he had no idea himself. The world, cruel and crazy and unyielding as it has been, has finally put Steve here, against all odds.
starving himself.
There are more details of Tony's abuse but not too graphic.
“What, you don’t appreciate the daily propaganda briefings?” Steve chuckles, and Tony can’t quite decide which one he loves more; the wit of what he says or the sweet ring of his tone as he says it.
It’s dark outside when they are finally naked and it’s only because of the flickering lights of the TV, that Tony can revel in the sight that is Steve’s full-body blush, Or his slightest trembles as Tony kisses his throat, his neck, and his chest. Steve lifts his head to look at Tony with the most endearing blend of confusion and despair when Tony takes them both in hand and Steve’s breathing gets short and heavy as he falls back onto the couch when Tony’s strokes quicken. Tony’s vision is blurry by that point. He is hazy and dazed, but he does his best to take in the way Steve closes his eyes and throws his head back, moaning and shaking and how he opens them to look at Tony just before he comes undone. It’s right then, when Tony finally lets go too, as Steve pulls him in, placing sloppy kisses on Tony’s lips and cheeks and hair as they come, tangled in each other and the colors dancing in Steve’s eyes take Tony’s breath away, although he has no breath left in him anyway. It’s a bliss, a joy, a different kind of content. It’s a flood of warmth that washes over Tony instead of washing him up because Steve is holding on to him, like Tony’s the only one, like Tony’s all he’s got in the world.
Tony wonders if there is a limit for a person’s humiliation. He’s been thinking about that all night, thinking this is it, this is the breaking point that he would come apart and stop existing but he has not.
So he does that. He washes Steve.
He takes all Tony’s clothes off and kisses his body, inch by inch, before resting his head on Tony’s chest to kiss and lick the stunning scars. Tony’s breath hitches and his words become unintelligible as Steve’s fingers move around his cock and he comes in Steve’s hand moaning and shaking, as he clings to Steve like Steve is the only one, like Steve is all he’s got in the world.
Tony scratches his beard as he squints at the screen as well. “Does it have it to be someone new, or could it be someone I’ve already banged?”
clothes is not that humiliating anymore.
And Steve knows what it means to be stuck in a shell others foist upon you. He absolutely does.
“Oh sorry, am I distracting you? I should probably stop then, don’t want to keep you from it, really,” and he chuckles, as he gives Steve’s nipple a gentle pinch before letting go.
is a board game that is apparently very fun and is rather new which Tony doesn't know of, hence he calls it quirks of quenching, quenching being an engineering term!
Tony ruffles Steve’s hair gently. “I think you have not read enough about Captain America then, son.” He kisses the back of Steve’s neck. “Did you know that he once jumped on a live grenade to save his team,
Steve in past tense. He breathes through the pain as Tony declares to the world that he has no trust for Steve. He takes each of Tony’s words, one stab after the other right into his heart, and doesn’t break into tears when Tony passes out and crumbles onto the floor, even if he fails to catch Tony, one more time.
Fuck.
“Steve,” Tony tries, and reaches over the table to hold Steve’s hand, “make me what sweetheart?”
Ready is a big word, Steve thinks hazily. It means composed and prepared, and in the right state of mind, and Steve is not any of those, but if Dr. Stark thinks he’s ready, then he must be, so he nods and does something with his face that hopefully looks like some sort of smile.
Kudos and comments are greatly appreciated. <3
, he repeats to himself, as he takes his suit and shield out from the back of the closet, smiling at the way his hands had shaken when he hid them there, the first day. He puts the suit on and takes a minute to look at his reflection in the mirror, before putting on the helmet.
It probably is, Tony tells himself, as it’s time to stop dreaming and wake up, anytime now. Especially if the guy he loves happens to be Steve Rogers; pure concentrated perfection.
that he is, on the other hand, makes him feel like curling into a ball or slipping under the table. Or disappearing altogether.
This is the
The morning meeting with his SI team is almost a breeze. The fact that he has an actual Stark Industries team, ‘Pandemic Emergency Response’, or purr as Tony likes to call it, has not lost its novelty yet, and he’s still surprised from time to time at how competent his interns are, despite their unconventional hairstyles and semi-questionable fashion choices. The meeting with Nat and Clint is even more engaging, as they debrief Steve on their recent intelligence operation on potential sources of the original virus. Steve does his best not to be salty about being left out and reads through pages of Dr. Cho’s report on a research by a Dr. Banner, who seems to be getting somewhere with making a vaccine if they manage to find the original version of the virus.
Captain Rogers shakes his head, his eyes fixed on Tony, and reaches out so Tony can grab his hand. “Tony’s with me. I’ve got him.”
to touch Tony.
‘Iron Man, One Year after Gulmira’, Steve reads to himself as he runs his fingers over the red and gold letters. He can’t quite believe it. TIME has done an 83 page issue on Iron Man from 2009, and Steve had no idea.
“How’s it looking?” Steve asks, unstrapping.
He lies down with his chest pressed to Steve’s back and doesn’t stop drawing small circles on Steve’s back long after Steve falls asleep. He pulls the covers over them, makes sure Steve’s tucked in and warm, and falls into a dreamless, deep sleep.
Tony looks up from his phone and blinks at the sight of the guy, fresh out of the shower. His hair’s still damp and his cheeks are flushed from the heat of the shower. Tony can’t decide if he looks more perfect naked, or framed in those unbelievably skinny jeans and a plain white t-shirt that’s almost see-through for being this stretched over those amazing pecs. Tony swallows, thankful for the genius idea of putting his jeans back on a minute ago, because as uncomfortable as it feels with his dick twitching against the rough fabric right now, it would have been way more uncomfortable to deal with the embarrassment of getting hard at the sight of the guy, in front of the guy himself.
The boys discuss some kinks, just talking, but please read the updated tags!
Iron Man, and is willing to share his smile, his touch and his home with Steve.
“Viagra, for instance, you know, the little blue pill?”
Steve kisses Tony’s forehead again and trails down, slowly, as he kisses the line of Tony’s nose. “A friend maybe?”
also has bits about following
It’s still pitch black outside when Steve opens his eyes.
Steve opens his mouth to say something, but he seems to have lost that ability in full, so he closes his mouth, shakes Tony’s hand again, and smiles even wider than before.
He will be here, Steve tells himself, his palm involuntarily pressing over his groin, because he said it loud and clear, ‘I have a date’, which has been their code since that unfortunate night Steve doesn’t even want to think about, two years ago.
This will be the same, Steve repeats to himself, ignoring the way his cock is straining and leaking even more, unsure how that’s even possible at this stage, and he does as Dr. Stark says. He takes a very deep breath, because he’s got this, despite the unfortunate incident, being on display and spreading wide, despite the blinding embarrassment. He has got this.
“I am sure you would have managed,” Steve says, deciding to eat some fruit salad instead. He casually offers some to Tony before putting some on his plate. Tony nods, and Steve fails to wipe the triumphant grin off his face.
He even smiles at himself in the mirror.
Steve tries to look away. He wants to be polite and not stare, he wants to at least take a sip from the drink the guy bought him but he just can’t. He looks at the guy and his dark fluffy hair and wonders if that third drink has actually got to him because he seems to have a hard time keeping his hands to himself. He suddenly has this urge to touch this man; those eyes, that hair, and the perfect mesmerizing whole-face smile.
Steve thought about the bite mark the most. He would touch it to feel the tingle that ran through his spine every chance he got. Every time he had felt desperate to touch Tony in the past months, every single night he spent in this bed listening to Tony’s breaths, and wondering what his life would be like if Tony loved him back at least a little bit.
“But he takes one look at me, and I go completely bananas, it’s pathetic, no joke,” he mumbles as he keeps smashing his breakfast and Steve has to flex his fingers to keep from reaching over the table and wrapping them around Tony’s fingers. “It’s the stupid alpha scent and years of co-dependency. I end up doing whatever he asks me to do. And yet, he goes on and does-” he points to the side of his neck “-this.”
“Do not call him that,” Steve snaps, and his lips stay parted in exasperation.
Dr. Stark taps a finger on his bottom lip. “Has this happened to you before?”
He doesn’t cease to exist, at least for another few minutes, as Tony slides his finger inside further and further and further and all that Steve can feel, is just that, the way he is opening up to let Tony in, no control, no thoughts, just the sensation; intense, incredible, extraordinary.
Tony spends hours on the phone, conferencing with so many people he loses count. Pepper orders changes of clothes online before his personal things arrive and some for Steve, too, although she doesn’t approve of the gesture.
He cradles the back of Steve’s head and runs his fingers through his hair. “Did you see that?! How on earth did that happen? My phone must be ringing mad right now, good thing it’s on silent, but there is literally no one I could think of that could have won this dickhead over.”
Steve narrows his eyes too. “So is that what we are, now? ” and he reaches forward to caress Tony’s cheek.
Tony’s been asleep for a while, curled into Steve, his hair brushing on Steve’s lips and his breath warm and rhythmic on Steve’s neck.  Steve smells Tony’s hair absentmindedly and thinks about his question.
He puts both of his hands around Steve, slowly reaching back to clasp them together, and starts caressing Steve’s back in soothing circles. He whispers reassuring words into his ear and his own heart starts to slow down as Steve’s body warms up, until neither of them is shaking anymore.
Captain Rogers pulls the stone face mask he’d rushed into the room with back down and Nat’s fingers around Tony’s tighten a little. Tony presses his thumb to the back of her palm, stroking gently and Nat brings her other hand to wrap around their intertwined fingers. An unspoken message that apparently calms them both, that they’re okay, they’re safe, that alphas scaring them even when they don’t mean to is nothing to worry too much about.
This chapter has mpreg which is not tagged for spoiler reasons. No description of pregnancy really, just the fact that Tony is pregnant. There is mention of blood and injuries and I don't think they are too graphic but definitely a little graphic. There is description of emotional abusive behavior but in the form of honeymoon phase of the abusive cycle as in Ty being nice to Tony after he has been physically abusive.
Dr. Stark understands though. “Perfect. I’m putting the speculum in now. Just relax. It will be okay, done before you know it.”
Steve’s home.
“I love you,” he continues, “I don’t care about the numbers, not this time. I just want you.”
Something. Is. Definitely. Wrong.
War superhero? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Rhodey is obviously a war hero but last time Tony checked he was not on speaking terms with the president, at all.
Please let me know what you think, in any shape way or form, your nice words make me keep going with this one, as it gets harder and harder to tie things together as I am going forward.
It’s suddenly a little hard to breathe.
It’s a delight to watch Tony sleep.
right?
Tony narrows his eyes for a second and takes a step back. “You’re asking me? You’re the one so uncomfortable with being in my proximity that you’ve gone through extreme measures to avoid any contact with me, and
Steve holds on to the wall and leans on Clint. “What did the doctors say? Is he gonna make it? Was what I heard when he was thrown out of the window the sound of all of his bones being crushed?”
I am pretty sure you knew this was coming right?! :)
“I do feel lucky,” he whispers, his voice suddenly hoarse, his skin burning all over, “can’t even begin to tell you how much.”
The playlist that Steve plays is
The other meetings do not go as smoothly. Steve finds himself going over his speech all through the financial report presentation of ‘Doctors without Borders’ and stumbles on his words at least three times when explaining the details of SI’s ‘Prisons and Correction Centers’ Emergency Help’ plan to the director of BOP’s Health Services Division.
And Steve … he feels that he has been a total dick about it. He feels that he needs to kick his own ass right now, as he has been a self-centered prick, too overwhelmed all the time, that he has not taken a second to do something for anyone else, especially the man who’s held his hand through the ups and downs of the roller coaster that’s been the past couple of days.
Wait, what package is this? It’s not their 3+1 fund package that the president would
From that first look, the first touch, the very first time Steve came apart under Tony’s hands, and along the way, how Steve has opened up to Tony, slowly but surely, how Tony has peeled the covers and taken off the mask, how he’s kept Steve’s nightmares away and soothed his pain, one kiss after the other.
on Tumblr, come talk to me :)
“Okay then,” Steve whispers as he smiles against Tony’s hair. “Just this once.” He pulls the covers over them, making sure Tony’s tucked in and warm, and presses Tony to his chest, gentle but firm. Tony closes his eyes, listening to Steve breathe in and out, and falls into a dreamless, deep sleep.
An omega.
crematorium?”
Tony slams the door shut and Steve snaps out of what feels like a magnetic field, finally able to stop staring at the now wide shut door.
Captain Rogers keeps his gaze on Ty for a long second, and Tony wonders if pressing to Ty's side might help to push the shiver away, before Captain Rogers turns to Tony and holds out his hand. “Steve. Nice to meet you, Tony.”
Tony takes a couple of slow steps ahead. The fact that this guy’s not willing to accept Tony’s money is refreshing. Or to be precise, pretty much unprecedented as far as Tony remembers, except for a couple of people.
“But it’s not just for you,” Tony sighs. “I kinda… really like to… you know … touch you.” and he presses his nose to Steve’s shoulder, “It feels like an honor, to tell you the truth, that I’ve been allowed to in the first place. So anymore of it, is … kinda … yeah. I’d love to.”
Steve had made a wish and had kissed Tony, and there was something in his eyes that was making Tony unsettled. There was something that Tony couldn’t quite place, that Steve was— the loud thump of the door startled him. He opened his eyes to the empty room and Steve was gone; for good.
“Put me down, you son of a bitch,” Tony says from between his teeth, and Steve regrets taking his fingers out of Tony’s mouth all of a sudden.
Tony takes a look around as if everyone in the crowded diner is suddenly watching him. He tries to say something, to buy some time to get a hang of himself, to ask what Steve means by a ‘scene’ but he decides not to. He knows exactly what a scene is - far too well and way more than he prefers, and what’s making his heart speed up and rattle in his chest is not the thrill and anticipation of something new as much as he wants it to be.
Nat’s face is not neutral and calm. Her hands are shaking as she unbuttons Tony’s shirt so Bruce can take a look at the bruises on Tony’s chest and back. She doesn’t flinch from the bruises and the fucking bloody shirt though. She grabs Tony’s hand when Bruce gently presses on Tony’s ribs and it’s surreal and Tony has never felt that way before but her face softens as Tony presses her hand back.
Someone gasps and Nat digs her fingers into the flesh of Steve’s arm which does nothing to keep him in place, obviously, as he finds himself right back in Tony’s space, with Nat practically dangling along. Steve’s aware, vaguely, that punching Tony is a horrible idea, and that’s what makes him keep it together within an inch of raising his hand. That, and the faint citrus scent that comes like a slap in the face, to bring him to his senses, a reminder that he will never hit an omega, no matter what.
“I won’t be imposing on you? You know, taking up your space? I am generally organized and I clean up after myself but I'd still be around, you know… all the time.”
Tony is flying. He might also be sinking because he struggles for air with each breath and every small movement sends a wave of pain all over his body. This doesn’t seem like a good idea anymore, but to be fair, it wasn't a particularly good idea an hour ago either. It was the only idea, a vision that came to him when Ty left the room to get back to their guest without locking the door and a strand of hope that he had five minutes to hang on to before it was gone forever. It seemed crazy and impossible to even get to Captain Rogers' vintage Camaro parked at the front without being seen and Tony is still not sure how he has managed to fit into what must be the tiniest trunk of all American-made cars. But now, the adrenaline that rushed him down the stairs and out of the back door is gone and all that is left is doubt, pain and horror. He is stuck in a practical coffin that some people hide dead bodies in and wonders if he will end up as one, before he sees the sky ever again.
“I’m really sorry, Tony. I am really really sorry.”
He brushes his fingers on Tony's face before he fucks off and Steve follows his figure going down the stairs and looks back at Tony who’s looking the other way as if he’s looking for something.
happy?!
Thank you to fiftyshadesofstony, and JehBeeEh for beta, guys you make my work readable and I really really appreciate your help <3<3<3 so many nice things upon youuuu :))
before he straddles Steve’s hips, pressing him to the cold rough concrete.
The pressure is sharp and feels like something's cutting into him. It’s hard and steady, and Steve breathes deep, as something gives and unclenches in his body, and lets Tony in.
Steve takes a step forward as Tony walks into the briefing room and his hands ball into fists on their own accord. “I’m nuts? I’m nuts? You’re the brainless person who’s apparently deleted his brain after uploading it to one of those AIs.”
That he got beaten up in every alleyway in Brooklyn because he hated bullies?” He runs his fingers on Steve’s scalp, and a shudder runs down Steve’s spine. “Have you seen him when he was skinny and pretty? I have his enlisting photo somewhere in my confidential data storage because I can’t really keep stolen data on my phone, and let me tell you, he has the fieriest eyes I have ever seen in my life.”
“Don’t beat yourself up, Steve. It’s perfectly normal to be aroused in this situation, and man, I promise you, compared to what I usually hear in this room, between pained cries and frustrated insults, this-” he looks up and gestures to Steve “-is much preferred and a nice change of pace. It’s okay. You’re okay.” And he winks, or that’s what Steve’s mind makes up, he can’t be sure, but the lightning that runs through Steve’s spine is real, for sure, because it burns all the way from the back of his neck down to the tip of his toes.
He is numb.
Thank you for giving this a try, I hope you enjoyed it. Sorry it is really sad right now but I promise it gets better
“I want to be one.”
“I’m Dr. Tony Stark, and I will be your doctor today,” the doctor says, finally looking up from his tablet. Steve hopes that he’s making this up, but it’s too obvious, how the doctor pauses, and his eyes stumble down to Steve’s crotch, where a bulge is sticking out from under the too short medical gown that Steve just changed into.
Steve turns over his shoulder to look at him before he turns back to catch the last seconds of the video. “For a guy who has a crush on Captain America, you sound extremely judgmental, Mr. Stark.”
Please let me know what you think, comments, and kudos are very much appreciated!
He is hot. He is lightheaded. He is exhilarated. He is safe and he feels that he can let go. That he can finally let go.
Everything moves into place after that. Tony can’t think about anything else, even when he tries to, and his brain is quiet, completely, for what might be the first time in forever. It’s all Steve and the way his body feels so close to Tony’s. The way his thighs envelop Tony’s cock as he slides back and forth between them, the way he moans and gasps for air as Tony’s hand picks up speed around his cock, how they are close, so close that it feels they are one. How it’s pleasure and nothing but pleasure, from the point where their bodies meet all the way through to eternity.
“Civilian market? Semi-automatic StarkLites with my multi-bore system are sold in Walmart?”
“Okay then. I appreciate it. I’ll contact my friend and have her arrange some things for me.”
Tony’s heart pounds painfully, his body numb but on fire, and his mind is running a mile a minute but still not getting there. There is an idea right at the back of his mind, a miracle, a tragedy, or both, and it’s right there, just out of reach and Tony can’t get the hang of it; not just yet. “Steve, honey, you’re not going to lose me. I’m right here,
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to Jeh and fiftyshades, guys, this is your work as much as mine, I could not have done it without you guys <3333
Tony brings his other hand over to cover Steve’s and the sight of post-surgery needle bruises on the back makes it hard for Steve to hold his tears back. “That’s too much death talk for the occasion, Rogers,” Tony says in between scattered coughs and Steve starts to laugh because of course Tony is the funniest person in the room in every situation.
The alpha turns to him and puffs out his chest as he slips his hand lower and wraps it around Tony’s waist. “Can’t see how that’s any of your business?”
“Careful.” Tony blinks at Steve, and his face twitches into the smallest smile Steve’s ever seen but it sets something right, like a cool breeze over Steve’s flushed cheeks, warmth radiating at his frozen skin.
Clean up. Right.
Wait. Just wait a minute.
It’s ridiculous. There is no way that Steve would understand what Tony is asking permission for. Tony barely knows himself and there is no chance in hell he can word what’s in his mind right now, maybe not ever. As it turns out, though, Steve seems to actually understand. Amazing, beautiful Steve that leaves snacks around Tony’s room and makes him look much better than what he actually does in that perfect little drawing; the guy who can move all seven boxes of Tony’s things into the penthouse by himself but turns into a mass of flushed warmth under Tony’s hands in a heartbeat. He understands and nods, his cheek moving against Tony’s in the most soothing way and holy fucking mother of fuck; he bends down a little and parts his legs.
Steve laughs as Tony tries to take Steve’s shirt off with his teeth and mouth as the pink and black wheel suggests and he squirms and whimpers as Tony
“And then I met you,” Steve continues, his voice small and wistful, like he's talking about something that’s not there anymore, “a perfect stranger, a random guy from a random bar I wasn’t even supposed to walk into. I can’t even get drunk for God’s sake, I just wanted to… be like normal people for a couple of hours.”
There are mentions of severe abuse against orother omegas, which ends up with one missing and one imprisoned, but it's pretty brief.
“I’m sorry, for being a jerk that night at the bar,” Steve says and buries his nose into Tony’s hair.
Captain Rogers talks about his charity as the entree is served. He goes on about the shelter in Brooklyn over the orange braised chicken and explains his plans for their facility in upstate New York that is still under development as he finishes the risotto.
Tony laughs and Steve wonders if a celebratory hug would be an appropriate course of action.
The time to do the damn scene has come too quickly - it feels like the night in the diner back in November was just a week ago - and Tony’s pounding heart and numb fingers contradict the ‘absolutely ready’ statement he’s made 30 times in the past day in response to Steve’s concerned looks and pointed questions.
Tony wishes that there was a definitive way of discussing things that did not require words. Especially now, as Steve has undone Tony’s zipper and is pressing his nose to Tony’s briefs, and the only sounds Tony can manage are meaningless, broken syllables. Stopping Steve is the last thing he wants to do right now, the bottom of the list after dealing with board members and suffering a horrible death. He will kick himself for this, for stopping Steve and possibly talking him out of it, but he just
and extremely emotional at that point but he has been through this mill enough times to know that this is part of the same play anyway. It’s excruciatingly hard though; for Tony not to lean into his touch, not to breathe in his remorse and not to wipe his tears away. Tony needs this to stay sane. He just so desperately needs to believe him.
Thank you to Ria Rose and Succubus Kayko for beta.
He might not need to hold water in his hands after all. All he might need to do is take the mask off, show himself, the skinny broken boy from Brooklyn, and hope for the best. It feels right to do it. It feels right to at least try.
"Brooklyn. ’m mad in love with Brooklyn. I was born and raised there.” Captain Rogers looks at Tony and smiles. “Moved back two years ago. Live and work there like a true local.”
is an old board game very popular in the 30s when Steve was a kid and it was discontinued from print in the 60s. It was reprinted as Inside Moves in the 1980s so Tony got one for his birthday from Jarvis, and he loves it so much so he knows it was called Camelot before. Too complicated. sorry :)))
He couldn’t do any of that. Not tonight, and not ever, because Steve was about to leave to be with someone he actually wanted to be with. Someone who would get to touch Steve and love him and keep him safe, someone who was not Tony and was about to come and gather Tony’s omega in his arms and take him away for good.
Tony swallows, blinks, and pushes both of his hands in his pockets because he’s now standing in front of Steve and he doesn’t want to ‘accidentally’ touch Steve’s breathtaking biceps.
“No, not really, never this long.”
He only needs a fraction of his concentration to keep on with the important bits really. The hardship Ty has gone through to buy Monet and the fact that he might use Captain Rogers’ art gallery, Marvelous something, for his future purchases, or Captain Rogers’ fascination with the fact that they own "14 Small Electric Chairs Reversal Series" because he has been under the impression that it is still owned by Bruno Bischofberger. Tony even makes a joke about how moving to a new house has created an opportunity for them to start collecting  because empty walls need multi-million-dollar art works, so he doesn’t come off as
“Now one foot behind the other one, to the side, twist a little, and one foot in front, perfect. Now spin.” And the rosy world spins with a flick of Tony’s hand as he lets go of Steve’s back. Steve’s heart beats fast suddenly as Tony pushes him away, and it slows back down as Tony pulls him back in, so close that their bodies meet and he can kiss Steve’s nose before breaking away.
He doesn’t pass by Tony’s door on his way to the kitchen, around 27 times, as he does each day on average, and doesn’t go back with some sort of edible things on a plate. He doesn’t sit at the dining table with his sketchbook, and there is no listening to him humming absentmindedly as he runs the pencil against the paper. He doesn’t stretch in the living room, in the spot between the coffee table and TV, that Tony likes to think Steve usually uses because it’s in Tony’s direct line of sight. No push-ups, no chest presses, and no mouth-watering amazing pecs showing through sweaty t-shirts, regrettably.
He doesn’t remember when he stops to dance, but the sun is shining in the sky when he opens his eyes. There is a woolen throw covering his feet and chest, and something is lingering in the air, a warm presence maybe, a vague feeling of a kiss that someone had placed on Steve's cheek, that doesn't seem to have happened in the dancing dream.
Tony stops fidgeting. He stops moving at all, at least for a second. Something changes in the air, a hint of vanilla coming across on top of the hibiscus scent, and finally, he smiles. “You don’t have to stay. Or help. You just—”
have to tell you why?”
Captain Rogers does not look gentle though. He does not look calm or compassionate and the smile he was wearing  all night is gone. Clouds have mostly covered the moon and the car is dimly lit by the the car lamp, but Tony can’t be making this up. He can even smell the way his alpha scent has shifted from the gentle black tea to  a sharp woodsy thing. Well, Tony can never tell the scents apart properly because he has been
He hands the bag to Nat, walks around the bed and sits next to Bruce who is now examining Tony’s fingers. He gestures to Captain Rogers without looking up from Tony’s swollen fingers and a familiar shudder of fear runs through Tony's chest and stabs his heart. Captain Rogers cannot care less about the
Tony’s first text to Steve comes in about 10 hours.
“Really?” Steve asks, taking one more step toward Tony. “You actually miss me?”
This is the
The only problem with using the shiny new StarkPad your quarantine husband has left in your room overnight as your new mask is that, he can show up after so many hours, leaning against the desk with a lopsided smile, and well, take it off you. Literally.
; the t-shirt obviously because it’s the first thing one removes when they undress, or at least that's what Tony thinks before Steve’s fingers trace the scars on his chest so gently and make Tony stop breathing altogether.
With Ty’s cue,
Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed it.
Tony laughs, and something flutters in Steve’s heart. “Captain America was literally the peak of human perfection. He freed 400 prisoners that the army had given up on with his bare hands and drew an exact map of all the other HYDRA bases by looking at the original map
Steve shuffles closer to Tony. “You tell me first. I was almost jealous of Batman for no reason apparently.”
and Steve’s socks too, just for kicks. Steve objects, just as Tony expected, because
All he gets right now is being
on Tumblr, come talk to me :)
“You were saying, Stark?” Steve teases. “Any chance you can whistle for me now?” Tony growls around Steve’s fingers and his hole clenches around Steve’s cock. “No?” he slams his hip against Tony’s, so hard that the door thuds and rattles, but hopefully not hard enough to make a dent. Tony clenches Steve’s flesh between his fingers and tightens his feet around Steve’s waist, his eyes full of fire but his body limp. He purrs once, so low that Steve wonders if he’s imagined it as soon as it’s done, but something swirls in his belly anyway as he picks up speed, pumping his fist around Tony’s cock, thrusting inside his hole, and moving his fingers, all in harmony. He can’t quite tell who first gives up and lets go but for a minute or two, all there is in the world is just them, Tony’s body enveloping Steve’s as if there is no distance in between, as if Steve can’t tell where he ends and Tony begins, shaking and breathless, washed over by wave after wave of pleasure and relief.
The words spill out like the magnitude of water rushing through a broken dam. Tears he didn’t know he was holding back for years, well up and overflow.
He falls apart.
He can do that. Maybe just this once, and so carefully so he doesn’t get used to it, but right here and right now, he will take this one. Happily.
He thinks about Rhodey who will no doubt become a captain someday. A colonel even, because he is fucking brilliant. He thinks about the Malibu house and the top shelf of the closet in his childhood room, how he would kill to get his hand on that black box before someone buys the house and movers start to pack their things. About Pepper and how he has been missing her so much, especially the past few weeks. How he wishes he could just call and listen to her rant about her idiot boss, how the fucking alpha is so handsy she had almost kicked his ass a couple of times, and how her new shoes are pinching her feet but look absolutely adorable.
Tony is now truly blushing. It's not that big a deal really, it's not like he has not been praised for what he does, or
He has nowhere else to go.
This chapter feels more intense to me, maybe because of Tony's state of mind?
Steve’s fingers find Tony’s hair, trying not to pull or push but he is unable to control himself completely. He can’t contain the way he moans and trembles as Tony swallows him down, wondering if this is the last bit of life before he can see heaven when Tony starts to suck his cock.
Tony kisses Steve’s cheek. He kisses his ear and his hair and the soft spot on the side of his neck. Steve turns to press his lips to Tony’s and his soft murmurs turn into broken whimpers when Tony’s fingers wrap around his cock, rubbing gently. Tony’s heart is racing in his chest, the blood roaring in his ears as he starts to move as slowly as he possibly can and stops beating altogether, at least for some time, when Steve starts to move in the same rhythm, slow but certain.
