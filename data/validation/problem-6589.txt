“I knew about that. However, it’s not true, actually. The face is covered because back then they made it, they didn’t know where the Nile’s source was.” Steve answered lightly as they stood there, admiring the fountain. “And…the church was made after the fountain. But Bernini was a flashy guy; he probably loved and encouraged the story.” He added.
“Stan really likes your character. He did you justice in Bruce’s comic, did he not? Did you have fun scaring Ross away?”
Tony gave him a sad look and Steve swore to himself he would have to make it up to him somehow. He made Tony’s life way too hard. He should have a few victories.
Tony reached for his hand. “Come swim with me.” He encouraged. “And we can take a run, and make love all night. No treatments here, no issues.”
“T-Tony…” He moaned, breathless and felt delicate lips pressing against his own, against his cheeks.
Tony grinned and kissed him on the lips in return. “C’mon, let’s take a walk. I’m all stiff from the flight.” He said, tucking himself against Steve’s side as they started to explore the city.
Steve smirked, kicking off his pants all the way and moving over, straddling his lap and pulling him in a deep kiss. Tony gladly kissed back, hands stroking the other’s back, down to his panties and along his strong thighs.
“You wouldn’t be thirsty if you stopped talking. And singing.” He chided, holding the bottle just out of reach from the cell and smiling. “I’m gonna go upstairs to get supper.”
But Bruce looks like he’d rather be anywhere but here that moment and Steve makes a mental note to warn him so he’s more careful when he asks.
Somewhere between her apology and mention of Phil Coulson, Steve noticed that something big and shiny was missing from Sharon’s left hand.
Without a word, without any effort, Steve rolled up and off the couch to land on his knees in front of Tony. Tony stared down at him shamelessly, momentarily stunned by the look of desire in his eyes, and the way the silk robe framed his strong shoulders and his sculpted chest. A gentle squeeze of Tony’s knee brought him back to the present, and it was all the encouragement Tony needed; he obliged Steve easily by spreading his legs to make room for him between his thighs. Steve’s swept his hands under Tony’s legs, pulling him forward and positioning him just as he liked. Tony sat up to pull his own t-shirt off over his head; Steve stretched up on his knees and took Tony by the chin, tugging gently and angling Tony’s head down for a kiss before he even registered tossing his shirt aside.
Much too quickly they had picked their way through their afternoon tea and a bottle of pricey champagne. Since Happy was in no condition to drive, Steve insisted on getting him a room there for the night. He thanked Happy again for joining him for dinner and wished him a good night before booking it back to the spa to make his appointment at the Guerlain.
“We’re across the hall,” he heard Tony say through the door. “Why are we meeting downstairs? You ready?”
“You didn’t worship them growing up,” Tony reminded him with a frown. He grimaced at a thought, but then he took a final, calming breath and moved on to the point he wanted to make all along.
“No!” Bruce and Tony shouted as one, startling Thor into silence. The stricken look of betrayal in his big, watery eyes made startling a drunk Thor feel like kicking a puppy, but given the circumstances they didn’t have time for his recounting of any glorious sexcapades.
Tony was standing beside Dummy, unharmed. Both the horse and rider were exhausted and panting from exertion. Neither of them moved. Tony was still holding on to Dummy, still gripping the horse's mane like a lifeline, but he was unharmed.
He could make his life easier by passing the phone to Tony, Steve thought. That was part of relationships, right? Sharing the burden of nosey friends?
sabotaged them every year; Tony never asked to confirm, but it didn’t matter. Now he looked forward to his annual tumble into his husband’s embrace.
With careful, gentle fingers, Steve worked on the knots in Tony’s back, pressing soft, adoring kisses to his temple now and then as he reached a particularly tough one to comfort Tony until the knot would finally give and fade away under Steve’s hands.
Even though Tony hadn’t looked away from him once while Steve talked, that last admission left Tony wide-eyed with color rising in his cheeks. “Really?” he breathed in disbelief.
Warmth radiated off of Steve’s body like a gentle summer breeze, and Tony did his best to focus on its comfort as Steve reached around his body to guide his legs apart for the masters’ benefit. Steve pressed a gentle paw against Tony’s thigh to widen his stance, then swept his warm palms up Tony’s flanks until Tony stood spread eagle before the other aliens with his hands behind his head and his legs wide apart. By now Tony was past the embarrassment of his cock hanging between his legs, exposed, disinterest, and limp. No-one cared about his cock anyway; to them, it was only a means to easily drinking down his come.
“Tony,” Dr. Odinson said gently, then making a show of crossing his legs and setting his pen down on his journal. “You were the one who wanted this appointment, were you not?”
“Don’t bother unpacking, Steve. I’m finding us a place tomorrow,” Tony whispered, his voice already sounding hoarse from overuse. “By Friday, we’ll christen the hell out of it.”
“And you know exactly what you did,” Steve pointed out without sympathy. Tony giggled shamelessly at the reminder of what an asshole he could be to work with, mostly because everyone but Steve had no choice but to deal with him, and Steve held his breath to listen. He could have basked in the warmth of Tony’s laughter all day.
“Medic!” Steve shouted at the people who milled around him without offering any help. “Medic! He needs a medic!”
When Steve wanted to end the night by sharing a memory of his Christmas tradition, Tony had kissed his husband to within an inch of his life. The kitchen had been a plot twist - Tony had never visited the palace kitchens longer than to thank people for their good work - but standing around the table with Steve and their friends, rolling dough and frying it up, Tony could have burst with gladness.
Erin had texted from herself and Paulette to ask if he was okay—they clearly remembered Steve and Tony had intended to keep their shotgun wedding under wraps, and wanted to be sure he was okay. Around the same time, a call from Sam had come in and he’d left a brief voicemail to let Steve know he’d be home all day if he needed company.
There was no strength left in Steve’s limbs. He was a boneless heap. He couldn’t even open his eyes, but he privately thrilled to hear Tony’s dark, uneven voice stuttering curses and praise in turn. Handsome, brave, generous Tony, who wasn’t afraid of anything, but hurting Steve. He wanted to do something, wanted to tell Tony how he never thought sex could be this way, but it would have to wait, because all Steve was good for at this point was panting, open-mouthed and drooling, into his soaked pillow.
“You’ve been saying you want to buy a car for years,” Bucky replied half-heartedly, absolutely unmoved by Steve’s rationale. “This is a bank. Figure it out.”
He moved into his bedroom where he could turn out the mirror from his wardrobe for a nice angle. Tony planted the dildo to the hardwood floor, and even when he tugged or slapped the damn thing, the suction cup at the base swayed and bounced, but remained firmly anchored for Tony's use. He hauled a chair over and set up the camera phone so he could captured the reflection of himself through the mirror without including the chair or the phone itself. It took some maneuvering, but he wasn’t in the engineering program for nothing.
“I missed you, too, mom,” Tony replied with a smile, and both he and Steve wished his parents goodnight when Howard and Maria left them to turn in for the night.
Steve carefully moved closer a moment later, this time to apologize and soothe with feather-light kisses, but Tony tugged more insistently on Steve’s hair.
Slowly, he turned around to face Tony and his beautiful smile, the one that could light up a room with that dazzling mischief and made Steve forget the world around him.
“I couldn’t tell—all I heard him say before the FBI packed him up in a car was that he didn’t do it, he was just getting breakfast burritos or something.”
Steve laughs loudly at that, ignoring Tony’s pout and just doubles over. Tony keeps the frown for exactly two seconds but then he joins Steve.
Tony blushes deep, down to his chest and groans as he hides his face. He feels Steve’s chest rumble with laughter and lets Steve carry him into their room.
Loving Steve Rogers is flying the nuke into the space. It opens up to infinity and endless unsolvable mysteries that he’s just not smart enough to figure out. It makes him sweat and wake up screaming with nightmares. But it saves the world, so Tony sucks it up.
“You’re lucky you’re cute,” Steve deadpanned but he looked fond more than anything else. His eyes were getting glassy with sleep and Tony couldn’t stop himself from craning his neck to kiss him chastely on the lips, his hand curling around Steve’s neck. “I’m lucky you love me.”
“Morning,” she mumbles, watching him over her mug with puffy eyes. She is not her brightest self yet, but she feels comfortable enough around Tony that she doesn’t fake it anymore. Tony smiles at her warmly, a real one that reaches up to his eyes, which means Steve managed to get him into bed at a reasonable hour. How, she knows but she would like to see it firsthand anyway. No one would be surprised to hear she’d like to see two hot guys fuck. One day, she’ll ask.
It was on the news after Tony went ahead and destroyed all of his suits, obviously. Of course it was. He felt that old awful creature awaken as he watched the news for two days straight, only moving to change the channel. He thought the creature was gone, that he managed to have his peace with Tony. (He had even gone ahead and confessed to Natasha that he admired Tony in uncertain terms when the two of them where hanging out after Chitauri. Natasha’s face had crumbled for a second when he said, “He is the most human out of all of us, isn’t he?”)
He doesn’t say “I’ll always be into this more than you are and you’ll hurt me. And I’ll hurt you back, because that’s who I am. You’ll heal with an ugly scar but my wound will always stay raw and open because I’ll keep poking it with my dirty hands. It’ll get infected and I won’t see the doctor, so I’ll die and you’ll know you killed me. Maybe it’ll finally hurt you as much as you hurt me.”
He gives up the fight as the elevator reaches the third floor and runs to the elevator. Watching the elevator rise up, way too slow and outdated for his Tower, he plasters himself to the glass and grins wildly when Steve jumps in the air when he sees him.
Which was probably nicer than Steve would expect from Tony and he wonders if his low expectations of Tony is why he doesn’t have him anymore.
Tony groaned at loud, pushing him down to grin devilishly. He knew Steve loved to watch him on top, Tony losing himself in the sensations, being full with his cock, his own flushed and hard cock bouncing with every up and down but Steve almost always took over the fucking in five minutes, always impatient.
“I’m going up to shower, Steve,” Tony calls out to him one foot already out of the door, his amused voice startling him out of his endless one sided war with the punching bag. He catches it to his chest, his feet taking two steps back to keep his balance. Tony’s mouth quirks to the side but it doesn’t erase the exhaustion. He hears the unsaid
It is hurricanes and broken homes, children holding onto their mother as they find their way through dead bodies of their neighbours.
“Everything about you is hot,” Steve tries to say but he can’t because his mouth has better things to do.
He caught Tony in the kitchen one day, after a two week absence. He had a plastic spoon in his mouth and a tray of food he seemed  to be smuggling out. He winced when he spotted Steve and wow, no one should be this uncomfortable in their own home. He kind of felt like those bullies for turning Tony into a terrified deer.
“Sounds like a man who has a lot to lose,” Natasha says mildly, but her eyes are suspiciously bright under the sunlight streaming through the open windows. She understands, feeling so unworthy that you hide from anyone else in the world, telling yourself other people are just burden. She understands holding onto what you find with both hands and you can’t even get distracted for one second or they’ll take it from you.
“I know you didn’t sign up for this. I’m sorry,” he says but doesn’t sound apologetic at all and Tony’s so grateful for it, for his shamelessness, because he can’t deal with Steve regretting them. Whatever the reason may be.
“Suck him off,” Tony orders and it takes Steve back in old days, where Bucky would pin him down on the bed, only place where he’d let him and suck his cock until he spilled his semen down his throat. He’d never done that for Bucky but he’s done it for Tony thousand times and he takes the boxer off, not taking his eyes off Tony.
It’s a challenge, to not fight back and just take it, take everything from Steve so Tony is all he’s left with. He wants to break Steve and hide him in boxes, so no one else can have as a whole.
It took them less than twenty seconds before they were both naked and Tony straddled him, rubbing his ass over Steve’s cock, giving his own oversensitive cock a few playful rugs to see Steve’s eyes fixate on his hands.
“Jesus Tony,” he mutters but grabs him by his bare thighs so he can wrap his legs around his slim waist. He giggles like a high schooler with a crush but it doesn’t matter because Steve’s hands roam over his back, and his ass which is only covered by Steve’s boxers, stretching tight around his fuller bottom. He sighs in pleasure when Steve peppers kisses from the bottom of his throat to his temple.
The constant pressure on his cock and the way Steve fucked him in the ass with his thick fingers, two at first, then three, brought Tony to the edge of an orgasm quick as light. He was squirming but Steve kept him in place even as Tony started to jack them off fast and hard. Tony wanted to feel Steve come first but Steve seemed to have the same idea and god, he was going to have a sore
Tony’s eyes crack open, looking at Steve like he wants to give Steve what he wants already. But he’s hung up on the idea that he is still paying off his debts.
Steve gave a long, high moan at that and got behind him in less than a second. He grabbed handfuls of Tony’s ass to knead it, making Tony congratulate himself for never giving up on squats. It was so worth it, considering how much Steve loved his ass and thighs.
Tony looks at him sharply. Steve huffs but he is rubbing circles on his back, not elaborating. “I think you’d run away if could hear my thoughts. Codependency at its best.”
He grasped fistfuls of Steve’s silky hair in his shaking hands to crash their open mouths together, feeling a dribble of saliva escape and trail down his chin as they gasped into each other and god, he loved that he couldn’t tell whose it was.
There was pre-Wanda Tony and post-Wanda Tony. For everyone who knew him at all, it was obvious. How Tony flinched any time Wanda is within touching distance or how he seemed to lock himself in his workshop when he was in tower and he was hardly at home anyway. He hardly said anything to them, just fought alongside them silently, sent them upgrades.
Steve’s hands trail up his arms to hold his shoulders and he hides his face in the crook his neck. “Which ones are me?”
She closes the door quietly and motions for Tony to sit on the couch. She crouches in front of her mini fridge and eyes the contents with disgust. “Hungry?”
Tony’s eyes dart around, betraying that he is already entertaining the idea. The fact that he’s so tired that he’s accepting he needs to rest is the evidence that this has gone on for too long. “What about you?” he says at last and Steve doesn’t bother hiding his smile as he throws himself next to Tony.
“I bet he still thinks you’re the most attractive person in existence, Thor included,” she declares, pressing her lips together to suppress a grin. “Does he still pop boners left and right around you?”
“It’s not forever,” Steve protests and his insides go clammy again. Steve realises his reaction instantly and shakes his head madly, explaining himself. “One of us is going to die first.”
Steve blindfolded him in their room with a black silk scarf and Tony indulged him, pretended he hadn’t figured it out where they were, as if he couldn’t smell the dust in the air, feel the texture of the floor beneath his bare feet. (He should get this place cleaned up. He’d hate to be a bad host.)
“I feel like I should ground them. Make them go to bed at certain hours so I can just hide when they are awake.”
Bu he’s a futurist, he knows everything is about to blow up in his face. So he chooses to keep his blinkers on, and Steve stays with him. Then he rationalises with himself that it doesn’t make a difference that he didn’t put a stop to two of them when he had the chance.
Tony thrusts his hand into the box of fries, the sleeves covering his hands entirely. He sees this one coming too, but he doesn’t do anything to stop it either. Tony looks at the ketchup on his sleeve with a groan as he stuff his food in his mouth and dabs at it with a napkin half heartedly.
There is only a few people who can keep up with his mind, even less with his emotions. Steve has always been better at understanding Tony’s emotions. From the beginning, he thinks they understood each other better than anyone. Too well maybe. That was why every word found the thinnest place to strike. Every word made the other bleed.
Well, in his defence, he always thought it was a weird antic of Steve’s to ask him if he had dirty clothes every few days. “Three years and we’re still learning about each other,” Tony grinned, his hand finding its’ way to Steve’s chest and patting him.
Tony laughs mirthlessly, “I always thought I’d die as Iron Man,” he says, and it’s nothing Steve doesn’t know because Tony never held back, never hesitated back then. His eyes always said
“I was ready to give up on everything for you and you made me,” Tony screams, getting into his face, his hands hovering next to Steve’s head, shaking with the effort not to hold him. “I gave you everything and now I just don’t want it back Steve. Keep it or throw it in the bin, shit on it, I don’t fucking care. It’s all yours. Do whatever the fuck you want. I’m done.”
You think you should’ve taken the last right, or least changed lines when you realise your car doesn’t have a steering wheel or brakes, just a gas pedal and you were driving way above speed limit.
. “I didn’t think I’d make it to my sixties. And now I’m sixty two and I have no idea what awaits me.”
“Is it because I’m from the past? Man out of his time,” Steve stammers when they lie side by side, his chest heaving with his shaky breaths. Like his body just remembered he used to asthmatic.
Tony looks up, carefree and smug and pats the girl on the ass, “Off you go, gorgeous,” he says and ignores the seductive pout she sends his way.
He doesn’t even have to knock on the door, he doesn’t have time to collect himself because the door is open and Tony is not alone as he’d expected. Bucky grins at him from the bed he’s lying on with only a tight boxer on his ass. He clears his throat, diverting his eyes away because Bucky has love bites all around his chest and Tony’s familiar fingers are massaging his scalp.
“Sometimes I really don’t get you,” Tony snaps, and yeah, that was what he was expecting in the first place. “What the fuck is this all about anyway?”
“I wasn’t here to see these lines form,” Steve says at last and Tony feels like crying, tries to shake him off but with every tug, Steve pulls him closer.
Bruce doesn’t tell him Tony will come around and Steve accepts his tense, secret smiles, as if he doesn’t want anyone to know he’s trying to comfort him. He asks Bucky and him out for a lunch one day and it’s pleasant and light as it could be these days until Bucky “casually” asks how Tony’s doing. Steve winces at the tactless question but that’s how Bucky’s always been before the war, before he was Winter Soldier and it makes him glad that the real Bucky is not buried that deep.
“Doesn’t sound very practical if it’s the only reason you want me naked,” he pants, and Steve sits back on his heels, face flushed and breathing hard. Tony whines, trying to bring him closer but Steve just catches his wrists in one hand and then rips his boxers with the other. Tony laughs delighted and mouths “Caveman.” before Steve swallows him whole.
“Sorry,” he apologises instantly, face hot with guilt and he bites into his sandwich but swallowing is hard with the lump in his throat. Natasha silently hands him a bottle of water and he drinks it gratefully.
“I can take anything from anyone but not from you,” Tony whispered one night, eyes far away. Their legs were tangled under the covers and Tony’s nimble fingers were drumming on Steve’s chest. They had been together for six months then, and every single day Steve was mourning the years they’ve missed. “I really hate that you have that power over me.”
It was a thing that lurked around in his mind as long as he knew himself, a part of his earliest memories and for a long time he thought it must be Howard, whispering into his little ears when he held Tony in his arms that one time, out of obligation, maybe. But later in life he realises this is his mother. His mother, who loved Tony more than she loved herself, so she stayed with Howard, even though they weren’t happy together.
Tony laughs shrilly, words too close to his own thoughts. Almost like Steve can read his mind. “All you ever saw was the television version of me. ”
Bruce has his arms full of greasy food when his eyes catch Tony. He narrows his eyes, wondering if he forgot to clean his glasses again.
“You gave the world so many bright, amazing kids,” he kisses his shoulder, digging his thumb in a particularly tense spot, “you deserve a break.”
“Why are you wearing this?” he asks again and now he can hear the thinly veiled hysteria in his voice. Tony arches a brow at his tone but finally he got his attention.
He holds onto this thoughts because if he doesn’t he’s going to crumble. He is so out of it, he remembers a flying woman, a bit like a disco ball but then, it’s all Steve, Steve, Steve. His whole body screams at him in exhaustion, knees shaking, breaths coming short. The last time he felt like this, he had his arc reactor smashed and... Not going there.
Steve huffs, probably mistaking his feelings as something it isn’t. “I know it’s not healthy, spare me the pity, alright?”
It’s more than he ever believed possible after Siberia, when Tony brings his other hand to caress his face.
Tony replies almost spitting hate before even Steve can close his mouth. “Why? Are you gonna land another blow?” It is the first time Tony ever said anything about their fight, war, whatever that was and Steve knew they shouldn’t have asked for Tony’s help when they’ve left his best friend unable to walk, when it was out he kept his parents’ murder a secret, when he crushed his heart with his shield. Steve doesn’t ask forgiveness but God knows it’s the only thing he ever wishes for these days.
But Tony loves giving Steve everything. His time, his body, his ideas, his heart. He thinks, I get everything back and it’s in a Steve form so it’s a sweet deal, isn’t it? He gives Tony and gets Steve back.
“We should move back to the Tower,” Tony offers giddily, eyes lightening up with the idea. They had their best times there, both as a couple and as a team, even the idea of living there again makes his head spin. “You know, try to remember how it felt to be that person, naïve and optimistic?”
“Oh-kay, I’ll take it from here. We’ll send you some postcards, it was nice knowing you,” Steve shots back with an on point imitation of Tony and Tony splutters, distinctly aware that he should be more insulted by being made fun of but there are more important matters he needs to draw attention to. “We will not send her postcards Steve, I don’t think they even sell them anymore.”
“Back to oversized hoodies?” is the first thing Rhodey asks. Tony huffs and throws his hands in the air in protest. “Why is this so important? Everyone’s been harassing me.”
It is so easy to be charmed by him, to be caught in his spell. For Steve, it’s as natural as blinking to love him, even if he hadn’t realised it for so long. But he is also not an easy man to understand. He was the epitome of everything about future that made him want to curl and hide back then. Everything Tony said went over his head and he was too proud to ask for clarifications, afraid to be mocked. Tony was capable of driving a saint crazy on his tame days but he seemed to lash out whenever it came to Steve and Steve, who never backed down from anything, was afraid of what Tony Stark might say to him.
“Why is that?” He asks on autopilot, using a bare minimum of his brain capacity for this conversation.
“Tony,” Steve approaches him carefully, like he’s approaching a wounded stray cat. “I’ve never told you I’m sorry.”
Tony knew Steve chose Thor’s quarters to lay it easy on him. After all, the demigod hadn’t been to Earth for at least a year now and it didn’t seem he was coming back anytime soon. He knew Steve can sneak around Natasha if he wanted, but still, he appreciated Steve introducing this step by step. For some reason, Natasha seemed oblivious to Steve’s bullshit. Or she just played them, which was much more likely.
Tony’s breath shuttered when he felt two of Steve’s fingers in his hole, promptly finding his prostate and grazing it gently. Steve’s hand left his hair, so he could caress the skin he probably left red and Tony chuckled breathlessly.
"Mr. Stark why are you whispering and why don't you just ask FRIDAY to just send you an Iron Man suit to bring you back home." Happy asked.
"Happy, I need you to work with FRIDAY to figure out my precise location and send someone over to pick me up from the hotel and drive me to the airport to fly back to New York," Tony whispered.
After being able to reserve two rooms which they each paid for separately Tony helped Steve into his room. Since Steve had trouble walking. As Tony was helping Steve get into bed. Tony slips and Tony falls on top of Steve. Tony then looked into Steve’s eyes, and Steve looked into Tony’s. After a good long minute of starring at each other’s eyes and a lot of heavy breathing between the two of them. Tony kissed Steve, and there begins a night of passionate sex.
He'd spend hours in the chair next to Steve, waiting for him to wake up again while he stared at the cast on Steve’s hand and relived every hit Steve took, his broken ribs, his fractured arm, and the hand that with great luck and a life-time of therapy might recover. All because he listened to Steve and didn't throw in the towel. And sure, Steve wanted that championship, and he probably meant it when he told Tony he wasn't going to end this because if Vanko's a cheater, then he doesn't deserve to win any more titles. Cheaters have no right to stand on a winner's podium.  But there'd also be that slight possibility that some of Steve's decision was because of Tony, that Steve wouldn't have wanted to let him down. That possibility is enough to make Tony sick to his stomach. Once Steve comes to after surgery, after the the doctors and therapists take a look at him and finally determine that, with hard work, he has a promising chance of recovery, Tony would be at his side long enough to let him know that he has arranged for Sam Wilson to join their staff in his place. That Tony will be leaving Steve's team indefinitely. He can't handle another match like that, he can't see Steve do what he did again. Tony left for good after that, leaving Steve in Sam’s hands regardless of what Steve tried to argue from the confinement of his hospital bed.
- They arrive in Lisbon, and Tony falls in love at first sight. Until he meets Benedita, Steve’s romantic costar in this spy movie who is so beautiful and sweet and nice and lovely that it makes him see red.
“Who isn’t?” Natasha rhetorically wondered, while Sam crossed his arms over his chest and, with a little less sympathy, muttered, “Who isn’t?”
“That’s the smartest thing you’ve said since you walked in here.” Howard informed him as he turned back to look at him. “So don’t come to me with words like love and stable job and the sobbing story of how my relationship with my son is hurting Tony.” He told him. “You might not need the influence my son has to support yourself but it surely helps.” He smirked. “You paid your mother’s bills on your own, I agree. But would’ve you been able to if my son didn’t pay half the bills of your Boston apartment for years?” He asked. “You can’t even afford a suit of the right size to come here to talk to your…father-in-law.”
“No no.” Steve immediately told him. “No, you didn’t miss any special occasion. I just had a video interview with some boring press guy and put on something nice for it. And then I figured my pretty boyfriend would be hungry after a long day working and once he’s done I could take him out to that Chinese place that’s open late to eat a bunch of dumplings and get a tad tipsy on black beer.”
They got in the car and Tony leaned over to buckle Steve’s seatbelt, stealing the tiniest of kisses before starting the engine and driving off towards the sunset.
Tony almost felt guilty. Almost. “We wanted a wedding that would be about me and Steve, not about his money or your decisions or her attitude.” He replied, pointing to his father, mother and mother-in-law in the order. “No rich people to entertain, no long lost cousins that don’t even know the husband name.” He continued, looking again to Maria and Sarah. “And that doesn’t mean we don’t love you. We do and we’re gonna get married and have you two arrange all the big circus and do it the ‘proper’ way for the families and the press and everyone.” He reassured. “But the moment we said yes to one another? We wanted no drama there.”
.” He felt his throat close up and paused a minute, gratefully accepting the bottle of water his mother handed him and taking a couple sips before he unintentionally mirrored his father’s position, scratching  the label nervously. “My boyfriend came to you to ask you permission to marry me and you got him shot.”
He really thought Tony wanted more than what they had right now but clearly he had misread the signals. All the flirting and the touching. Steve thought it meant something but clearly, he fooled himself.
When the two of them moved officially together in Tony’s penthouse apartment in New York, Steve found a job drawing comic stripes for a magazine and collaborating with a small graphic design society.
Tony’s lips moved to his own, rewarding him before he sat up, hands moving back to Steve’s chest, to his abdomen, holding onto him as he sensually moved, seeking his own pleasure, using him.
“Like hell you will.” She growled. “It’s my son; I will take care of him. I do not want to see a single dollar from you. You’re the reason my baby nearly died today!”
Steve nodded, grabbing Tony’s wrist quickly and leading him away before the other could make any witty remark, continuing to walk until he was sure they were far away enough then stopping and pressing Tony against a wall, returning to kiss him until they were both breathless and panting, pulling back just enough to breath.
He kept his gaze down on the box of noodles, trying to find the courage to speak up those scary seven words.
for them, giving your heart on a platter, the power to crush you and hope they don’t step on you like an insect they can’t be bothered to put outside the window. It’s like dying every damn second and you have your whole life to think about it.
He walked back toward the king sized bed and sat down on it, careful not drop Tony. Then he smirked at him, one that he saves for private, the one that the world hadn’t seen. “Ride me.”
It isn’t long before Tony stands up without a word and locks himself in a room, which is too small for anyone, let alone the suit. But apparently it’s better than seeing their faces and he doesn’t make a noise or show up at all and he’s long gone when they land.
He envied him there for being brave enough to handle it, an ugly, volatile creature brewing under his sternum.
“Can you bring him back?” Natasha asks Carol Danvers, her bloody hands on her impeccable uniform. She is pleading, Steve realises. Danvers looks younger than Natasha but she has this bitter smile like she’s about to break a kid’s heart.
Instead Tony’s back in his floor with a couple and Steve’s already broken a glass thinking about the man’s large hands on the curve of his waist, Tony’s mouth on her cunt, making her whimper and thrash on his silk sheets.
,” and that was it, Tony hardly punched back after that, just let the two of them bring him to his knees. Steve knew Bucky thought there was a real fight going on but he was there to watch Tony work on his suit, he knows what it was capable of.
“Everyone was texting me photos of you,” Steve admits and he pushes Tony down to mattress, who goes way too willingly. He puts his elbows next to his ears and half lies on top of him, knocking the breath out of Tony for a second. Tony wraps his arms around Steve before he can get away and cranes his neck to press a kiss to his cheek.
They’re still Avengers, they still take their enemies down together but they don’t go for shawarma and there isn’t a party where Tony gives Natasha a lap dance and Tony doesn’t make Steve fall apart under his touch, kissing every inch of his soft skin, murmuring “I love you”s.
“Bucky asked me if I was okay with you being together,” Steve exclaims, an accusing finger stabbing at Bucky’s chest.
Tony head snapped up to him at that and stared at him as if he was a puzzle he was stuck on and Steve realised this is the first time he had swore in front of Tony. He cleared his throat, “Do you mind me hanging out in the workshop with you for a while?”
Starks grins at him, not at all bothered by his response. “Just make an ass out of yourself, that’s what I do.”
They both shake their heads no with terrifying image of Bucky trying to make Tony understand (Steve knows Tony actually understands Bucky’s situation and that’s why he’s being so generous with them).
He flailed for a moment when Steve thrust between his thighs, just below his throbbing balls, their cocks rubbing on each other maddeningly. He reached for his cock but Steve beat him to it, letting his weight drive Tony onto his chest on the bed, ass in the air. He got his fingers around both of their cocks and gave a tight squeeze from root to tip, then holding his thumb on the tip of Tony’s cock, the rest of his fingers half a ring around both of them as he thrust in and out. All Tony could do was to join his hand next to Steve’s and hide his whimpers into a pillow.
He paces the room until Steve gets into the elevator, shooting impatient glares at the door like he dares Steve to just teleport into the room.
So he does the smart thing and kisses him. “You’re going to break me,” he says bitterly, “And I’m going to let you.”
“We’re not soldiers,” Tony had snarled back then, a blow to the mountains he made up from denial and ignorance. A deep crack in his façade. He looked at Tony, his uneeringly beautiful eyes bright with unshed tears and he thought,
“When will you have to stop attending these threesomes?” she asks professionally, clearly pleased that her plan worked out so well.
“Just gossiping about you,” she says with a straight face. “I mean, wow, Steve, give the guy a rest, will you?”
Tony winks at him, fluttering his eyelashes. Rhodey shakes his head at his antics. “You usually bring out the hoodies when you’re feeling like shit,” he says and Tony nods in agreement. The last bad hoodie incident was after the Chitauri.
“God, I wish we could do this in every square of this place,” Steve growled into his ear and Tony’s brain was already malfunctioning, his IQ down by forty points at least by that point, so he couldn’t even register the meaning. He cried out when a particularly hard thrust slammed into his prostate. He tried to open his eyes to look at his lover but it was hard to see even with his eyes wide open, vision blurry at best. “Like fuck me in their rooms?” At this Steve’s became more erratic, something primal, a part of him that he couldn’t shake off taking over him. “Yeah,” he choked out as he completely laid down on Tony to harden his thrusts, wrapping an arm around his throat as Tony heaved for a breath, mostly because of the sudden increase of onslaught on his nerves. His eyes was blackening out in the edges, Steve’s strong arm cutting his air way and even if it wasn’t, all of Tony’s neurons were busy making sure he felt Steve’s body all around him. Not trivial things like breathing.
“I missed you Tony,” he said honestly, because this might be the only chance to see Tony in months, if the way Tony kept disappearing for longer periods indicated anything.
“I identify mostly as a Tony Stark man,” Steve corrected him, with a crooked grin, the one that made his left eye close and wow, this kind of stuff should’ve stopped affecting him thirty something years ago.
“Tones,” Rhodey objects but his eyes are fixed on his hands and there isn’t any heat behind his warning and Steve knows it’s hurting him so fucking much, much more than Steve hurts and Rhodey is actually blaming him.
Tony was very, very experienced when it came to sex. He was very experienced in public sex as well, a gift from 90s’, and it was just a gross understatement to say that it brought out some nasty memories.
Tony shakes his head in amusement but his smile slips when he sees some new wrinkles around her eyes that wasn’t there the last time they were alone. Of course, Natasha catches it and fixes him with a stern look. “Again?”
Steve just smiles at him, keeping their eye contact for once, not afraid of the things they might reveal. He cradles Tony’s hand between his larger hands and kisses each knuckle before he nuzzles it to his cheek.
Tony yelps upon hearing his voice, knocking over the blowtorch with his elbow. “Stop sneaking up on me. I have a heart condition,” he exclaims, a hand over his... hoodie? “Be gentle, Bruce or I’m gonna have to demote you from being my favorite brunette.”
“I’m sorry,” he wants to say but Tony beats him to it, “Just go Rogers,” he says in a low voice, heat gone and Steve hates this tone even more than the accusing one.
“That’s really not very eco friendly,” Tony gasps, and he instinctively start to thrust between Steve’s denim clad thighs when Steve’s hand somehow finds his perineum to press against his prostate from outside. His hands find their way into Steve’s hair, tugging him in for a kiss.
Tony’s shaking briefly, arms around his now skinny legs. The t-shirt he has on is almost see-through, his scapulas jutting. Steve hesitates for a minute before he decides fuck it, and sits beside him on the cold floor. He hears the small hitch in Tony’s breath and that’s enough to shake him through his core. He’s so weak when it comes to this man. If it was anyone else he’d put it as surprise or discomfort but he knows Tony reacts to him just as he reacts to Tony.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Steve stares at him sternly, grinding his teeth together and while his muscles were exceptionally stronger since the serum, he doesn’t think his skeleton matches it.
Seeing a bus coming at you doesn’t lessen the pain of your bones breaking. Maybe you could’ve hit the breaks and maybe you get to turn the wheel to the side but you still break your neck and you’re still paralysed neck down and having a conscious open heart surgery doesn’t have anything on seeing the man you love walk away when you can’t move a finger to save yourself.
Tony doesn’t look at him, “I know you are.” They both hear the unsaid “but it doesn’t change what you did to me.”
Steve had been teasing him for longer than an hour when he asked if he wanted to go somewhere else. Which was the only reason he could get it up for the second time that night after the spectacular orgasm Steve gave him.
you. I’m pitying us both,” he tells truthfully, but softly, putting his hand over Steve’s on his abdomen.
It has become easier, being together, as natural as breathing in five years. Coping with the aftermath of the snap has been more bearable but not less painful when they had each other to come back to. This is the first time they are breathing without the guilt of letting down half of the universe, without their breath on their necks.
“What did you think when you saw us making love, Steve?” Tony asks, an almost cruel glint in his eyes and his hands travel down to Bucky’s chest, fingers curling over nipples to twist them. Steve feels like his head might explode from confusion and anger but he also feels blood rush to his groin as Tony’s hands explores Bucky’s chest and he feels his breathing get quicker when Bucky rests his head on Tony’s shoulder, blown eyes on Steve. “Come closer, Steve,” he whispers with a encouraging smile, “You know you want to.”
“Nothing,” he says neutrally, which makes Steve arch his brows. Tony rolls his eyes but pops his pills and gulps them down.
Bucky winks at Tony when they walk behind them and gives him a thumbs up, accompanied by a obscene hand gesture, which makes everyone but Tony choke, even Natasha.
. Steve didn’t hold back as he basically assaulted his prostate, strong fingers jabbing and rubbing that he drove Tony over the edge before Steve. Just as Tony started pulsing and shooting in his hand, Steve let himself follow him, their comes mixing in their hands.
“I’ll wash the sheets,” Steve assured him distractedly, still breathing a little harshly. His fingers were drawing lines on his back and Tony’s smile grew when he realised it said Tony. Like Steve couldn’t get enough of him, even though they were touching everywhere.
Tony chuckles, “It’s okay now, I’ve got you and you’ve got me,” he says with conviction he doesn’t feel.
Tony had looked baffled at best and suspicious at worst. He had narrowed his eyes at him as if he was trying to understand the joke. “Busy times,” he had said, smiling but it’s his talking-about-Howard smile. “Hey, you can always let me know if you need anything. Just tell FRIDAY.”
The rest of coffee only fills half of his cup and he starts preparing for himself, feeling like an intruder.
Steve grabs Tony’s hand before he can start tickling, entwining their fingers. “You know I like seeing you age, right?”
He grits his teeth, because death was never talked aloud with the Avengers. The threat was imminent, it always filled the silences through the cracks and danced over their heads without a care but talking about it made everyone uneasy, so they avoided it for many years.
He finds Tony in the small balcony of his room. It’s a small one, hardly big enough to put two chairs on the marble. It’s almost absurd, finding him under open skies with his feet on the ground. The Tony he remembers is always flying high enough that he disappears to his enhanced eyes, bantering with him, eyes meeting over others’ heads, always something to drink in his hands. His repulsive smoothies because he can’t be arsed to chew, a coffee, some expensive scotch.
The positive thing was that the biggest side effect was sleep. He wasn’t sick in Tony’s world. He could exercise and take Tony on hikes and picnics; they could travel the world in just a blink. Steve started praying to wake up one day in that universe for good.
“Perfect, you’re perfect.” He praised, leaning down to kiss Steve’s jaw and cheeks as the soldier shuddered under him. “I got you. Just a moment.” He reassured as he stood up, leaving him long enough to grab his shirt from the ground, using it to clean up the mess before he undid the knots on Steve’s wrists, massaging them softly and wrapping his arms around him, stroking his damp hair, kissing him. “I got you. I’m here.”
Steve leaned against the headboard and took his time looking over the pictures. “Mh…wax doesn’t portray very nicely on digital. It’s like taking a picture of an impressionist painting…it looks amazing to capture the details of the strokes and the paints but to get the right illusion you need a little blurriness.”
Steve wandered over to the deputy, pulling a chair and sitting down there beside Bucky, lifting his feet up on the edge of the windowsill, continuing to sip his water as he moved his head in time with Starks’ voice.
“Mh, that’d be complicated considering he lives in the 40’s…but maybe with time travel or…I got an idea!”
Bucky smiled and started to get up before he stopped. “You sure you don’t need me here?” He asked. “What about supper?”
“The same way you dare accusing me to manipulate your son after you paid five thousand dollars to my high school girlfriend to tell him I cheated on him.” Steve informed. “Peggy would like to thank you, about that. She apologized and told Tony it was all bullshit the moment she got your check and that she needed the money for her honeymoon. Japan, lovely location.” He said lightly. “I was thinking of something calm and tropical for myself and Tony. Less activities and places to see and more drinks on the beach and sex.”
“No, I mean… in the song there’s this man who travels to the future and sees a killing robot so he comes back, tries to save humanity but nobody believes him and he turns evil, turns to vengeance and becomes the very same monster he saw in the future.” Steve continues, bullshitting his way through homework had always been sort of a talent. He was just good at giving speeches. ‘Ma said he could’ve been a politician if he wasn’t that honest. “Iron Man is a hero that has given up on his humanity, pretty much. Nobody knows his alter ego, nobody knows that there’s a human inside the armor. He just---he carries the weight of his past on his shoulders, knows that his hands are dirty and that people could never see him as the hero so he became the robot, became the Iron Man to try and make amends for his sins.”
Steve shrugs because it doesn’t matter where they go first, he has no intention of coming back to States for a long time. “Helsinki?”
Steve wants to scream and throw the fucking television on their heads for fucking with his head but Tony’s hand disappears under Bucky’s boxers and Bucky’s hips thrust forward in shock and suddenly he thinks fuck it and closes the space between the in two huge steps.
Tony would’ve been a lot more gentler with him, he imagines, if he had just called him Iron Man, or Sir, or even Tony. Anything other than Mr. Stark. He would’ve explained the modern technology with simpler terms than the incompetent SHIELD agents, not bombard him with latest inventions that he just can’t keep up with without any basics. He’d talk to him about what went right and what went wrong in the last 70 years, objectively. Steve would’ve been probably be a lot more horrified about American history, because even if Tony’s a patriot in his own way, his true love is the earth, as a whole. He would take him sightseeing, not the regular walking tours for tourists but a ticket to see glimpses of Tony’s life. He’d start calling him Steve instead of Cap.
It’s been three months since they last saw Tony (or Rhodey). So when Bucky sees Tony with a blonde dame on his lap, he stops short reaching for coffee machine. “Iron Man?” he says, as if trying the words.
Natasha seemed the most sympathetic towards him out of everyone, probably because she was as unhappy about Wanda as him, if not more. She was always muttering something under her breath around Wanda in various languages. A few times Wanda had the courage to tell her to say it to her face and after a few sessions of Natasha chewing out Wanda and absolutely wrecking her, they just let Natasha have at Wanda in her own terms. She was touching Tony comfortingly all the time, hands caressing his hair gently, a kiss on the cheek. They looked magical together, like Adam and Eve, a bit too intimate to be friends. He’d have been jealous (he was, god he was) if hadn’t been there to witness their dynamic for years.
“Oh Steve,” Tony thinks hysterically. “You haven’t got a fucking clue. If you’d know how much of me is you, how much I let it consume me, you’d run the other way. You’d be disgusted by the lengths I’d go to erase that sadness in your eyes. I’d spend all eternity in anguish for you to be happy. Sometimes I wish our atoms to collide, so we can make a new universe with just two of us. So I get to keep you just for myself.”
“I love you,” he mumbles with his mouth full and Bruce nods calmly before he pops a fry in his mouth. “What’s it with the hoodie?” he tries again but Tony shrugs, all attention on the food, probably not even hearing him. Bruce watches the sauce drip on the gray sweater (?) with a sense of detachment, like he’s watching a movie in slow motion. There’s a moment where he questions his morality because he could’ve prevented this, but shakes it off. He has been becoming quite dramatic lately.
She hums, and she still can’t draw her eyes off him. “It’s cute,” she says after a few minutes and Tony just grins, from one ear to another.
The suggestion that Steve might die before him quickens his heart rate more than healthy for a guy with his history and his nails bite into Steve’s skin where he’s holding onto his arm. “Not necessarily,” Tony murmurs.
In his worst moments, which happens far too frequently to set aside as occasional slips, his treacherous mind replays their death in a loop, vivid and sparing no detail. Their last words remain a desperate call for each other and Tony wonders if they were actually in love. If he was the one to put the sad look in his mother’s eyes. If Howard was the one she stayed for.
Tony hears himself gasp and tries to muffle it into Steve’s shoulder. Steve shivers when his breath hits his skin, fingers tightening over his.
“Are you my babysitter or my husband?” Tony murmurs into the pillow, averting his eyes. Steve huffs, “You didn’t, did you?”
Steve grabbed him under his ass with one arm and easily pulled him off the ground. Tony whimpered as his cock rubbed against Steve’s, still too sensitive after having his ass played with far too long after an orgasm. He sometimes wished he was back to his twenties, or thirties, so he could keep up with his boyfriend better. Not to say that it didn’t do wonders to his self esteem to see Steve go mad for his forty something body.
Steve instantly grabbed his cheeks apart and pushed two thick fingers in despite stretching him out just before they came here.
It was a matter of time after that, for two of them to disappear for days at a time. No one had ever said anything but I was hung up in the air: “It’s going to end in a disaster.”
Tony smiles dopily, still a bit high on endorphins, “Guess we’ll just have to trust each other on that one.”
He got like this sometimes, couldn’t relax enough to take Steve, even though they had done it so many times. He remembered being horrified about it, the first time it happened but Steve had been nothing but calm and understanding about it back then and he was just as sweet now.
He sits when he decides he would’ve left himself if he didn’t want to be in his company and stares at him without saying anything, as usual.
He had slid down to the floor to take off Steve’s shoes when they heard some voices, Natasha and Clint, and Tony hid his grin into Steve’s knee. There weren’t actually anyone outside, it was just some recording Tony made Jarvis play to make this more... authentic.
He didn’t have the guts to look him in the eye after that and see the trust and love there. He knew every moment he didn’t tell Tony about his parents he was going down a road that was hard to recover from.
Tony’s lips twitched amusedly, and his fingers found their way into Steve’s hair, gently carding through them until he was sure Steve had fallen asleep.
“I heard the news,” Natasha says instead of a greeting, brushing against his shoulder intentionally on her way and Tony falls into step with her. It was something she picked up from self help books she borrowed from Sam. For a long time, Tony didn’t get why she insisted on this when it clearly made her itchy, but now he knows Natasha just wants them to know what they mean to her. She’s still uncomfortable with it, still looks like an amateur performing in front of thousands of people but it’s the thought that counts.
“I wanted a part of you,” he mumbles, hiding his face in his other shoulder. He can feel the moment Tony turns to him, his breath tickling his neck, that’s how much they’re close, that’s how hard he’s breathing.
“But you do. You did back then and it hasn’t changed,” Steve whispers softly, his hand catching Tony’s tiny wrist gently, and he runs his fingers until their fingers are interlaced.
“I don’t get younger, you know,” he hisses, hating the burn in his eyes. Pretends there aren’t any tears streaming down his cheek. “You were the one to fuck off while I was still a bit attractive.”
She glares at her own sandwich before she sits down beside him, “Other than being healthy and green?”
“I’d like to believe the former,” Steve says smiling tenderly, “fucking everything up and still coming back to each other. Would’ve made a nice novel.”
He looks confused when Tony aims at him with the repulsor, which is ridiculous because it happened before. Many, many times. Thor just likes to troll people by playing the dumb blonde from another planet.
Steve crawls until his face is inches away from it, patting the sheets with one hand to find the oil while the other grabs his cock to give a few experimental tugs. Tony looks flushed all the way down to his chest but he is biting his lips unconsciously, like he’s more embarrassed than aroused. “I don’t know if I can come today.”
He tongues the head, closing his eyes at the taste, trying to code it to his memory in case this is the last time, then opens to watch them. He takes the head in his mouth, sucking gently, teasing, then going down on him slowly, and caressing the underside with his tongue and Bucky gives an involuntary thrust, making him gag suddenly. Tony whispers in his ear and grips his hips with one hand while his other hand is around the base of his cock to stop him from coming.
With Pepper it was always her giving more, until she decided to take more than he was willing to give. When he destroyed the suits, it was the beginning of the end for them. He hated giving up a part of him, a part that resembled Steve more than anything, so he could keep her.
“We’ve been here for almost three years,” Steve says slowly, like talking to a toddler. Tony shrugs, “Yeah, I know, but now there is also Wanda and Clint is still snappy with me whenever he’s here…”
“Tony told me you used to fuck.” Bucky says offhandedly. Steve feels like he’s been shot in the head. “Is this what he said?” he asks, trying to keep his voice casual. He feels Bucky’s metal arm scratch against his arm when he shrugs, “He said you had a complicated relationship.”
Barnes is even quieter. He stares at Tony for a long time as if he’s trying to solve a puzzle until Tony sends him a disdainful glare and shuts down the face plate loudly.
“I don’t see the problem there, except Steve getting jealous and murdering you both,” Rhodey grins and well, it’s obvious Tony’s not getting any help from him.
It was easy to predict what was going to happen after he finally told the truth to that question. He went into a robot mode, only goal being keep Bucky alive. He could see that Tony was pulling his punches back, considering they still weren’t blown to hell.
“Where do we go first?” Tony asks in that tone that says his mind had already taken off but he’s waiting for Steve to catch up. Steve’s hand starts roaming his slick back, going lower until he meets the swell of his ass, fingers dipping into his crack deeper and deeper each time, making Tony thrust back into his hands.
Tony’s smile dims a bit but he shakes it off. “Everyone will think you’re my sugar baby,” he says teasingly and the tight knot in Steve’s chest dissolves hearing his light tone.
“Hello, Colonel,” he says with a small voice, his eyes flickering to his crutches. He clears his throat and takes a deep breath to force the words out. “How’s the treatment going?”
He watched Pepper and Tony, sickeningly in love and he hated them both, because he wanted to be them, either of them. But he didn’t have the heart to be Tony and what he had wasn’t enough for Tony to love him.
“I know what I was getting into Rogers. I basically jumped into it,” he laughs, “I knew you’d be my destruction and I was okay with it. I’m still okay with it. It’s all on me baby.”
“How bout you make good on your promise?” He smiles seductively, as he wrapped his legs around his waist.
He shifts towards him, particularly loud in the vast openness before them, when Tony is not making any noises. He doesn’t stop until their sides are pressed together.
Bucky watches as Tony smiles at Steve, not as large as the ones in photos but genuine and he can swear Tony isn’t even thinking about his “treason” anymore. There’s still some tension between them, with usually shows itself in bedroom, when Tony takes him hard and furious at the same time he kisses him lovingly on the mouth, muttering things he can only hear because of his heightened senses like “I missed you”, “You feel so good Steve”, “I want to feel you tomorrow, forever”.
A knock puts a stop to Natasha’s teasing and Steve’s head appear from the hallway, face brightening with a smile when he spots them.
When Steve first blurted out his tiny secret fantasy (definitely deliberately), there was no two ways about it, Tony lost it. Steve had him on his stomach, elbows next to his ears to hold his weight from crushing Tony. He was mouthing at his neck, his panting breaths broken only by some indecipherable words. He was thrusting into Tony so furiously that it promised him a week of careful sitting down, and it made everything just hotter.
His hand goes to his throat when Tony releases him and he falls back on his ass on the floor. He can’t take his eyes off Bucky, who’s breathing so deeply and Tony is kissing his cheek and Steve wonders if it’s just been a game of Tony’s.
“Tell me you missed me,” Tony tries to say it coyly, playfully but instead it sounds desperate. He kisses Steve deep, making Steve extend his neck under his fervor to take both of their minds off his stupid demand but Steve has known him far too long to be fall for it.
“After all these years I still can’t decide if these all happened because we were meant to be or not meant to be,” Tony says in a small voice. It’s not far from a slap to his face but also kinder than he deserves.
Loving Steve makes Tony fall in love with himself. Because he is so fucking brave, allowing himself be vulnerable with this man who’s bound to break him. He doesn’t even have to give him a gun to shoot him, he has his eyes and his mouth and his hands.
Tony looks down on himself and makes a surprised sound, then laughs. “There was a minor accident and all my clothes are burned. I’m borrowing from Steve.”
Tony laughs quietly at that, fingers drawing mindless figures on his thigh. And despite the guilt, and the whole universe hanging from their shoulders, he thinks, this is the moment I want to live in.
She sends him a death glare, with goes straight to his cock. She smirks smugly when she detects the small movement of his hips and her hands cup his balls lightly first, then hard enough to make him jumps with shock and pain.
“You think he’ll smell us when we’re done?” Tony asked coyly, playing his part, the blushing virgin. Steve hummed, with an amused glint in his eyes like he knew Tony was just humouring him and grabbed his hair to bare his throat. “Oh, he will,” he said, kissing his way up from the bottom of his throat gently. His grip on his waist was strong, at odds with the softness of his mouth and Tony arched into him, slamming their hips together in the progress.
“Cheesy,” Steve choked out, eyes rolling back on his skull as he breached the first ring of muscles, still a tight fit after years. He was going down slowly, pain cutting through pleasure at times. Tony was jacking himself off as he rolled his hips to get used to the sensation, willing his body to relax to take him fully when Steve reached out for his hand.
Steve has been gone for two days and Tony misses him like a limb. He misses the bad cooking and his weird feet and sheet hogging.
“I know,” Tony says softly and Bucky feels a delicate truce form between them. And maybe it’s still too soon, to stupid of him but he hates to see his best friend hurt so he can help but add, “About Steve…”
Steve knows it’s not about them anymore, it’s about Peter and he missed that too, didn’t he? He could’ve been there with Tony for that kid.
Steve nudges him back on the bed and coats his hands with massage oil. They always come in scents Steve loves somehow. He slaps his hand down on the flesh of his ass and kisses him quickly on the cheek with a huge grin when Tony turns to glare at him. He straddles Tony’s thighs and starts working his way up from the top of his ass, making him abandon his pretence at being annoyed. His rigid muscles melt under his hands, his breathing slows and evens out in less than five minutes.
“I can’t do this” Steve said with his back against Bucky. Steve didn’t want to make eye contact with Bucky.
“I’m not following this. How could I get pregnant when you had vasectomy years ago? It’s one of the reasons Pepper called off the engagement.” Steve asked.
“I was afraid of that… I’m sorry your first time had to be like this. I never wanted to disrespect you.” Tony said apologetically
"Classic Stark," Tony said congratulating himself on such achievement. He had banged a hot guy last night and by the looks of it the hottest guy who had ever lived too. Tony then crossed his arms behind his head to relax and relish in his glory.
